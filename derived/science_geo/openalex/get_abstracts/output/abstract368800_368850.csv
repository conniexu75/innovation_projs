https://openalex.org/W2156523992,"After a long history of overexploitation, increasing efforts to restore marine ecosystems and rebuild fisheries are under way. Here, we analyze current trends from a fisheries and conservation perspective. In 5 of 10 well-studied ecosystems, the average exploitation rate has recently declined and is now at or below the rate predicted to achieve maximum sustainable yield for seven systems. Yet 63% of assessed fish stocks worldwide still require rebuilding, and even lower exploitation rates are needed to reverse the collapse of vulnerable species. Combined fisheries and conservation objectives can be achieved by merging diverse management actions, including catch restrictions, gear modification, and closed areas, depending on local context. Impacts of international fleets and the lack of alternatives to fishing complicate prospects for rebuilding fisheries in many poorer regions, highlighting the need for a global perspective on rebuilding marine resources."
https://openalex.org/W2003870922,"Monitoring Monocyte Reservoirs Monocytes are cells of the immune system that are recruited to sites of tissue injury and inflammation where they help to resolve the infection and are important for tissue repair. The bone marrow and blood are believed to be the primary reservoirs from which monocytes are mobilized after injury. Swirski et al. (p. 612 ; see the Perspective by Jia and Pamer ) now demonstrate that the spleen also serves as a critical reservoir of monocytes that are recruited during ischemic myocardial injury. Monocytes in the spleen are very similar in phenotype to blood-derived monocytes and are mobilized to the injured heart, where they represent a large fraction of the total monocytes that are recruited. The chemoattractant, angiotensin II, is required for optimal monocyte mobilization from the spleen and emigration into injured tissue."
https://openalex.org/W2047386154,"Surface plasmons are electromagnetic waves that can exist at metal interfaces because of coupling between light and free electrons. Restricted to travel along the interface, these waves can be channeled, concentrated, or otherwise manipulated by surface patterning. However, because surface roughness and other inhomogeneities have so far limited surface-plasmon propagation in real plasmonic devices, simple high-throughput methods are needed to fabricate high-quality patterned metals. We combined template stripping with precisely patterned silicon substrates to obtain ultrasmooth pure metal films with grooves, bumps, pyramids, ridges, and holes. Measured surface-plasmon-propagation lengths on the resulting surfaces approach theoretical values for perfectly flat films. With the use of our method, we demonstrated structures that exhibit Raman scattering enhancements above 10(7) for sensing applications and multilayer films for optical metamaterials."

Stress-induced deficits in spatial reference, working memory, and behavioral flexibility are associated with synaptic and dendritic reorganization in both the hippocampus and the medial prefrontal cortex. However, the effects of chronic stress on action selection strategies are unclear. Dias-Ferreira et al. (p. 621 ) examined whether chronic stress affects the ability of animals to select the appropriate actions based on the consequences of their choice, and found that rats exposed to chronic unpredictable stress rapidly shift toward using habitual strategies. The shift in behavioral strategies observed in chronically stressed animals corresponded to dramatic and divergent changes in connectivity in the associative and sensorimotor corticostriatal circuits underlying these behaviors."
https://openalex.org/W2069298307,"Tissue-Specific Control The effect of genetic variation on gene expression and phenotype among individuals is largely unknown. Dimas et al. (p. 1246 , published online 30 July 2009) show that in humans there are several genes whose allelic expression varies in a tissue-specific manner and are apparently controlled by cis elements. Up to 80% of variants seem to have tissue-specific functions when compared in fibroblasts, as well as B cells and T cells. This variation among regulatory variants correlated with transcript complexity, which suggests that some of the observed regulatory variation is due to genotype-specific use of transcripts and transcription start sites."
https://openalex.org/W2111173087,"Tracing Mantle Oxidation The chemical composition of the Earth's mantle varies with tectonic setting. For example, basaltic melts near subduction zones are more oxidized than magma near divergent plate boundaries. Kelley and Cottrell (p. 605 ; see the Perspective by Hirschmann ) examined melts formed in different tectonic environments, using highly sensitive synchrotron-based analytical methods. The oxidation state of Fe increased with water content and mobile trace elements concentrations. Thus, fluids released from wet subducting plates drive mantle oxidation above subduction zones, which may help to explain the spatial differences in oxygen fugacity of the mantle."
https://openalex.org/W1981889147,"Ecological history plays many roles in ecological restoration, most notably as a tool to identify and characterize appropriate targets for restoration efforts. However, ecological history also reveals deep human imprints on many ecological systems and indicates that secular climate change has kept many targets moving at centennial to millennial time scales. Past and ongoing environmental changes ensure that many historical restoration targets will be unsustainable in the coming decades. Ecological restoration efforts should aim to conserve and restore historical ecosystems where viable, while simultaneously preparing to design or steer emerging novel ecosystems to ensure maintenance of ecological goods and services."
https://openalex.org/W2148403724,"The nuclear receptor PPARalpha is activated by drugs to treat human disorders of lipid metabolism. Its endogenous ligand is unknown. PPARalpha-dependent gene expression is impaired with inactivation of fatty acid synthase (FAS), suggesting that FAS is involved in generation of a PPARalpha ligand. Here we demonstrate the FAS-dependent presence of a phospholipid bound to PPARalpha isolated from mouse liver. Binding was increased under conditions that induce FAS activity and displaced by systemic injection of a PPARalpha agonist. Mass spectrometry identified the species as 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycerol-3-phosphocholine (16:0/18:1-GPC). Knockdown of Cept1, required for phosphatidylcholine synthesis, suppressed PPARalpha-dependent gene expression. Interaction of 16:0/18:1-GPC with the PPARalpha ligand-binding domain and coactivator peptide motifs was comparable to PPARalpha agonists, but interactions with PPARdelta were weak and none were detected with PPARgamma. Portal vein infusion of 16:0/18:1-GPC induced PPARalpha-dependent gene expression and decreased hepatic steatosis. These data suggest that 16:0/18:1-GPC is a physiologically relevant endogenous PPARalpha ligand."

These roles are important in reestablishing function and biodiversity in ecosystem restoration. Measurement of the community indicates the status of the system in relation to restoration targets and the effectiveness of management interventions, and manipulation of the community shows promise in the enhancement of the rate of recovery of degraded systems."
https://openalex.org/W2064399682,"The saturated fatty acids acylated on Lipid A of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or bacterial lipoproteins play critical roles in ligand recognition and receptor activation for Toll-like Receptor 4 (TLR4) and TLR2. The results from our previous studies demonstrated that saturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids reciprocally modulate the activation of TLR4. However, the underlying mechanism has not been understood. Here, we report for the first time that the saturated fatty acid lauric acid induced dimerization and recruitment of TLR4 into lipid rafts, however, dimerization was not observed in non-lipid raft fractions. Similarly, LPS and lauric acid enhanced the association of TLR4 with MD-2 and downstream adaptor molecules, TRIF and MyD88, into lipid rafts leading to the activation of downstream signaling pathways and target gene expression. However, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), an n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid, inhibited LPS- or lauric acid-induced dimerization and recruitment of TLR4 into lipid raft fractions. Together, these results demonstrate that lauric acid and DHA reciprocally modulate TLR4 activation by regulation of the dimerization and recruitment of TLR4 into lipid rafts. In addition, we showed that TLR4 recruitment to lipid rafts and dimerization were coupled events mediated at least in part by NADPH oxidase-dependent reactive oxygen species generation. These results provide a new insight in understanding the mechanism by which fatty acids differentially modulate TLR4-mediated signaling pathway and consequent inflammatory responses which are implicated in the development and progression of many chronic diseases.

So far, at least thirteen TLRs have been identified in mammalian species (1Uematsu S. Akira S. J. Mol. Med. 2006; 84: 712-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar, 2Kawai T. Akira S. Trends Mol. Med. 2007; 13: 460-469Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1596) Google Scholar).Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from Gram-negative bacteria is the ligand for the TLR4 complex (3Poltorak A. He X. Smirnova I. Liu M.Y. Van Huffel C. Du X. Birdwell D. Alejos E. Silva M. Galanos C. Freudenberg M. Ricciardi-Castagnoli P. Layton B. Beutler B. Science. 1998; 282: 2085-2088Crossref PubMed Scopus (6382) Google Scholar), whereas, TLR2 can recognize lipoproteins/lipopeptides of Gram-positive bacteria and mycoplasma (1Uematsu S. Akira S. J. Mol. Med. 2006; 84: 712-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar, 2Kawai T. Akira S. Trends Mol. Med. 2007; 13: 460-469Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1596) Google Scholar). LPS forms a complex with LPS-binding protein in serum leading to the conversion of oligomeric micelles of LPS to monomers, which are delivered to CD14. Monomeric LPS is known to bind TLR4/MD-2/CD14 complex (4Saitoh S. Miyake K. Chem. Rec. 2006; 6: 311-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Lipid A, which possesses most of the biological activities of LPS, is acylated with hydroxy saturated fatty acids. The 3-hydroxyl groups of these saturated fatty acids are further 3-Ο-acylated by saturated fatty acids. Removal of these Ο-acylated saturated fatty acids from Lipid A not only results in complete loss of endotoxic activity, but also makes Lipid A act as an antagonist against the native Lipid A (5Munford R.S. Hall C.L. Science. 1986; 234: 203-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 6Kitchens R.L. Ulevitch R.J. Munford R.S. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 176: 485-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). One or more Lipid As containing unsaturated fatty acids are known to be non-toxic and act as an antagonist against endotoxin (7Krauss J.H. Seydel U. Weckesser J. Mayer H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 180: 519-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 8Qureshi N. Takayama K. Kurtz R. Infect. Immun. 1991; 59: 441-444Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, deacylated lipoproteins are unable to activate TLR2 and to induce cytokine expression in monocytes (9Brightbill H.D. Libraty D.H. Krutzik S.R. Yang R.B. Belisle J.T. Bleharski J.R. Maitland M. Norgard M.V. Plevy S.E. Smale S.T. Brennan P.J. Bloom B.R. Godowski P.J. Modlin R.L. Science. 1999; 285: 732-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (1400) Google Scholar). Together, these results suggest that saturated fatty acids acylated on Lipid A or bacterial lipoproteins play critical roles in ligand recognition and receptor activation for TLR4 and TLR2. Indeed, it is suggested that the rapid interaction of bacterial lipopeptides with plasma membrane of macrophages occurs via insertion of their acylated saturated fatty acids as determined by electron energy loss spectroscopy and freeze-fracture techniques (10Wolf B. Hauschildt S. Uhl B. Metzger J. Jung G. Bessler W.G. Immunol. Lett. 1989; 20: 121-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 11Uhl B. Speth V. Wolf B. Jung G. Bessler W.G. Hauschildt S. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 58: 90-98PubMed Google Scholar). TLR2 can form a heterodimer with TLR1 or TLR6, which can discriminate the molecular structure of triacyl or diacyl lipopeptides (12Takeuchi O. Kawai T. Mühlradt P.F. Morr M. Radolf J.D. Zychlinsky A. Takeda K. Akira S. Int. Immunol. 2001; 13: 933-940Crossref PubMed Scopus (1001) Google Scholar, 13Takeuchi O. Sato S. Horiuchi T. Hoshino K.

Fikrig E. Flavell R.A. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 878-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). So far there is no evidence that microbial ligands for other TLRs are acylated by saturated fatty acids.Results from our previous studies demonstrated that saturated fatty acids activate TLR4 and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) inhibit both saturated fatty acid- and LPS-induced activation of TLR4 (15Lee J.Y.

Lee W.H. Heikkinen A. Chanmugam P. Bray G. Hwang D.H. J. Lipid Res. 2003; 44: 479-486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). In addition, the saturated fatty acid lauric acid potentiates, but the n-3 PUFA docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) inhibits lipopeptide (TLR2 agonist)-induced TLR2 activation (17Lee J.Y. Zhao L. Youn H.S. Weatherill A.R. Tapping R. Feng L. Lee W.H. Fitzgerald K.A. Hwang D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 16971-16979Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). Together, these results suggest that both TLR2 and TLR4 signaling pathways and target gene expression are reciprocally modulated by saturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids. However, the mechanism for this modulation by fatty acids is not understood.TLR4 is recruited to lipid raft factions after cells are treated with LPS and subsequently induces tumor necrosis factor-α expression in RAW264.7 cells (18Triantafilou M. Miyake K. Golenbock D.T. Triantafilou K. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 2603-2611Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This process occurs in an ROS-dependent manner because inhibition of NADPH oxidase suppresses TLR4 recruitment to lipid rafts (19Nakahira K. Kim H.P. Geng X.H. Nakao A. Wang X. Murase N. Drain P.F. Wang X. Sasidhar M. Nabel E.G. Takahashi T. Lukacs N.W. Ryter S.W. Morita K. Choi A.M. J. Exp. Med. 2006; 203: 2377-2389Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Methyl-β-dextrin, a lipid raft inhibitor, significantly inhibits the LPS-induced expression of cytokine (19Nakahira K. Kim H.P. Geng X.H. Nakao A. Wang X. Murase N. Drain P.F. Wang X. Sasidhar M. Nabel E.G. Takahashi T. Lukacs N.W. Ryter S.W. Morita K. Choi A.M. J. Exp. Med. 2006; 203: 2377-2389Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar), suggesting that lipid rafts are essential for TLR4-mediated signal transduction and target gene expression. Lipid rafts are a collection of lipid membrane microdomains characterized by insolubility in non-ionic detergents. Lipid rafts serve as a platform where receptor-mediated signal transduction is initiated (20Simons K. Toomre D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 1: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (5110) Google Scholar). Lipid rafts have a special lipid composition that is rich in cholesterol, sphingomyelin, and glycolipids (21Anderson R.G. Jacobson K. Science. 2002; 296: 1821-1825Crossref PubMed Scopus (999) Google Scholar). The polar lipids in detergent-resistant membrane contain predominantly saturated fatty acyl residues with underrepresented PUFAs (22Hanada K. Nishijima M. Akamatsu Y. Pagano R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6254-6260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 23Schroeder R. London E. Brown D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1994; 91: 12130-12134Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar, 24Brown D.A. London E. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 111-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (2542) Google Scholar), suggesting that saturated fatty acyl chains favor lipid raft association. On the other hand, n-3 PUFAs displace signaling proteins from lipid rafts by altering lipid composition, and the displacement leads to the suppression of T-cell receptor-mediated signaling (25Stulnig T.M. Huber J. Leitinger N. Imre E.M. Angelisova P. Nowotny P. Waldhausl W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37335-37340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). It is now well documented that TLRs form homo- or hetero-oligomers (1Uematsu S. Akira S. J. Mol. Med. 2006; 84: 712-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar, 2Kawai T. Akira S. Trends Mol. Med. 2007; 13: 460-469Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1596) Google Scholar). TLR4 homodimerization is the initial step of the receptor activation. Results from our previous studies suggest that the molecular target by which saturated fatty acids and n-3 PUFAs reciprocally modulate TLR4 activation is the receptor complex itself or the event leading to the receptor activation instead of the downstream signaling components (15Lee J.Y. Ye J. Gao Z. Youn H.S. Lee W.H. Zhao L. Sizemore N. Hwang D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 37041-37051Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar, 16Lee J.Y. Plakidas A. Lee W.H. Heikkinen A. Chanmugam P. Bray G. Hwang D.H. J. Lipid Res. 2003; 44: 479-486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). Therefore, we determined whether the reciprocal modulation of TLR4 activation is mediated by regulation of the dimerization and recruitment of TLR4 into lipid rafts, and if these processes occur in an ROS-dependent manner.DISCUSSIONIt is now recognized that chronic inflammation is one of the key etiological conditions for the development and progression of many chronic diseases, including cancer, atherosclerosis, and insulin resistance, suggesting that the inhibition of inflammation can reduce the risk of development of such diseases. Inflammation can be induced by microbial infection. Toll-like receptors mediate infection-induced inflammation by recognizing invading pathogens and activating downstream signaling pathways that lead to the expression of diverse arrays of pro-inflammatory marker gene products (1Uematsu S. Akira S. J. Mol. Med. 2006; 84: 712-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar, 2Kawai T. Akira S. Trends Mol. Med. 2007; 13: 460-469Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1596) Google Scholar). However, it is not well understood what causes and mediates “sterile inflammation”: inflammation from a non-infectious origin. Recent evidence now suggests that certain TLRs can be activated by endogenous molecules derived from tissue injury and saturated fatty acids (17Lee J.Y. Zhao L. Youn H.S. Weatherill A.R. Tapping R. Feng L. Lee W.H. Fitzgerald K.A. Hwang D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 16971-16979Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar, 35Brunn G.J. Bungum M.K. Johnson G.B. Platt J.L. FASEB J. 2005; 19: 872-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). This suggests that TLRs mediate not only infection-induced inflammation but also sterile inflammation induced by endogenous molecules. It further suggests that TLRs and their downstream signaling pathways can provide important targets for preventive and therapeutic strategies against the chronic diseases. Results from epidemiological and genetic studies linked TLRs to the development and progression of many chronic diseases, including insulin resistance, atherosclerosis, and cancer (17Lee J.Y. Zhao L.

However, the molecular mechanism by which these fatty acids modulate the activation of TLRs is not known.Results from our previous studies further suggest that the molecular target of the n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid DHA in inhibiting TLR4 activation is the receptor itself or the upstream events (instead of downstream components) leading to the activation of TLR4 (14Alexopoulou L.

It was demonstrated that TLR4 is recruited to lipid raft fractions after cells are treated with the LPS (18Triantafilou M. Miyake K. Golenbock D.T. Triantafilou K. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 2603-2611Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The activation of TLR leads to recruitment of immediate downstream adaptor protein MyD88 (42Medzhitov R. Janeway Jr., C.A.

Therefore, if TLRs are activated after being recruited to lipid rafts, this activation can be assessed by enhanced recruitment of MyD88 into lipid raft, which can be determined by co-immunoprecipitation of MyD88 and TLRs.

TLR4 homodimerizes, whereas TLR2 heterodimerizes with TLR6 or TLR1. The TLR2/6 dimer recognizes peptidoglycan and diacylated lipopeptide (MALP-2), whereas TLR2/1 dimer recognizes triacylated lipopeptides (12Takeuchi O. Kawai T. Mühlradt P.F. Morr M. Radolf J.D.

Thus, receptor dimerization and recruitment of TLR4 into lipid rafts appear to be two of the initial events leading to the activation of TLR4 signaling pathways.Our results presented here demonstrate that saturated fatty acid lauric acid stimulates, but the n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid DHA inhibits the dimerization and recruitment of TLR4 into lipid rafts. In addition, lauric acid stimulates but DHA inhibits the association of TLR4 with MD-2 and downstream adaptor molecules, and the activation of NF-κB and target gene expression. The treatment of cells with the lipid raft disrupting agent nystatin caused significant reduction of the amount of TLR4 homodimer in whole cell lysates and lipid rafts. Nystatin also inhibited LPS- or lauric acid-induced activation of NF-κB and the expression of TLR4 target genes. Lauric acid, like LPS, activated NADPH oxidase and increased ROS generation while DHA inhibited NADPH oxidase. Inhibiting NADPH oxidase with DPI and NAc suppressed TLR4 dimerization induced by LPS or lauric acid. Together, these results suggest that the recruitment and dimerization of TLR4 into lipid rafts are the initial steps required for the activation of the downstream signaling pathways and that lauric acid and DHA reciprocally modulate these processes. Dimerized TLR4 was not detected in non-lipid raft fractions even when stimulated with LPS or lauric acid, suggesting that agonist-induced dimerization of TLR4 occurs in the lipid rafts rather than the non-lipid raft compartment. These results further suggest that the recruitment of TLR4 into lipid rafts is coupled with the dimerization of TLR4. The results from our previous studies also showed that saturated fatty acids and n-3 PUFAs reciprocally modulate the dimerization of cytoplasmic pattern recognition receptor family Nod2 that also recognizes bacterial components (48Zhao L.

Kim H.P. Geng X.H. Nakao A. Wang X. Murase N. Drain P.F. Wang X. Sasidhar M. Nabel E.G. Takahashi T. Lukacs N.W. Ryter S.W. Morita K. Choi A.M. J. Exp. Med. 2006; 203: 2377-2389Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). It was also shown that oxidative stress generated by hemorrhagic shock recruits TLR4 to lipid rafts in macrophages (50Powers K.A. Szászi K. Khadaroo R.G. Tawadros P.S. Marshall J.C. Kapus A. Rotstein O.D. J. Exp. Med. 2006; 203: 1951-1961Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). In our studies, lauric acid, like LPS, activated, but DHA inhibited NADPH oxidase. The NADPH oxidase inhibitor DPI or the antioxidant NAc abrogated TLR4 dimerization induced by LPS or lauric acid. These results suggest that lauric acid, like LPS, induces, but DHA inhibits dimerization and recruitment of TLR4 to lipid rafts in a ROS-dependent manner. It was shown that NADPH oxidase 4 isozyme directly interacts with TLR4 in human embryonic kidney cells transfected with TLR4, MD-2, and CD14 (51Park H.S. Jung H.Y. Park E.Y. Kim J. Lee W.J. Bae Y.S. J. Immunol. 2004; 173: 3589-3593Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). However, it was shown that MyD88, the downstream component of TLR4, controls NADPH oxidase function in primary macrophages (52Laroux F.S. Romero X. Wetzler L. Engel P. Terhorst C. J. Immunol. 2005; 175: 5596-5600Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Thus, it is not clear where NADPH oxidase is located in the hierarchical order of TLR4 signaling pathways. Because both DPI and NAc inhibit dimerization and recruitment of TLR4 to lipid rafts induced by LPS or lauric acid, it is conceivable that these one or more enzymes may be a part of the signaling complex directly interacting with TLR4 in lipid rafts.How the saturated fatty acid lauric acid induces, but DHA inhibits dimerization and recruitment of TLR4 to lipid rafts, and how lauric acid and DHA reciprocally modulate NADPH oxidase are intriguing questions. The facts that Lipid A is acylated with saturated fatty acids, that removal of saturated fatty acids from Lipid A results in complete loss of endotoxic activity (15Lee J.Y. Ye J. Gao Z. Youn H.S.

Unlike phospholipids in plasma membrane, polar lipids in lipid rafts are predominantly acylated with saturated fatty acids that facilitate the formation of liquid-ordered lipid rafts. Our results showing that both LPS and lauric acid induce dimerization and recruitment of TLR4 to lipid rafts suggest the possibility that the saturated fatty acids acylated in Lipid A may help initiate the formation of lipid rafts, and thereby, recruit TLR4 to lipid rafts where TLR4 interacts with other signaling molecules to activate the downstream signaling pathways.It was demonstrated that treatment of cells with n-3 PUFA eicosapentaenoic acid causes incorporation of this fatty acid into lipids in lipid rafts, which are highly enriched with saturated fatty acids (25Stulnig T.M.

Such an alteration of the fatty acid composition of lipids in lipid rafts by n-3 PUFAs leads to displacement of signaling molecules from lipid rafts, and thus inhibits downstream signaling pathways (25Stulnig T.M.

Our results demonstrate that DHA inhibits LPS- or saturated fatty acid-induced dimerization and recruitment of TLR4 to lipid rafts, which is the initial step of TLR4 signaling pathways, suggesting a possibility that n-3 PUFAs inhibit the formation of lipid rafts by altering the fatty acid composition of polar lipids that are required to be acylated with saturated fatty acid for the formation of liquid-ordered lipid rafts. Therefore, the inhibition of the formation of lipid rafts by DHA may lead to reduction of signaling molecules recruited to lipid rafts.Our results provide a new paradigm in understanding the mechanism by which saturated fatty acids and n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids differentially modulate TLR4-induced inflammatory responses through the regulation of ROS-dependent dimerization and recruitment of TLR4 to lipid rafts.

We investigated the relative importance of different immune mechanisms in limiting the spread of the intestinal microbiota. Here, we reveal a flexible continuum between innate and adaptive immune function in containing commensal microbes. Mice deficient in critical innate immune functions such as Toll-like receptor signaling or oxidative burst production spontaneously produce high-titer serum antibodies against their commensal microbiota. These antibody responses are functionally essential to maintain host-commensal mutualism in vivo in the face of innate immune deficiency. Spontaneous hyper-activation of adaptive immunity against the intestinal microbiota, secondary to innate immune deficiency, may clarify the underlying mechanisms of inflammatory diseases where immune dysfunction is implicated."

This packaging material presents a barrier to accessing the genome by the various machineries that need to deal with the DNA: replication, recombination, repair, and transcription complexes, for example. Hodges et al. (p. 626 ; see the Perspective by Otterstrom and van Oijen ) use single-molecule techniques to analyze how a yeast RNA polymerase II ternary elongation complex copes when it encounters a single nucleosome directly in its path. The polymerase does not actively peel the DNA from the nucleosome's surface but, instead, waits patiently until the DNA fluctuates off the nucleosome and then advances, increment by increment, until the nucleosome is destabilized. Under certain conditions the destabilized nucleosome, rather than being lost entirely from the DNA, can be passed back to the DNA behind the polymerase."

The separation performance is partly governed by the selectivity for one species over another, and this can be compromised by defects, which allow for easy diffusion pathways. To create the porosity, structure-directing agents are used, which need to be removed during a long thermal treatment that can generate defects. Choi et al.

https://openalex.org/W2079386976,"In mammals, a family of five acyl-CoA synthetases (ACSLs), each the product of a separate gene, activates long chain fatty acids to form acyl-CoAs. Because the ACSL isoforms have overlapping preferences for fatty acid chain length and saturation and are expressed in many of the same tissues, the individual function of each isoform has remained uncertain. Thus, we constructed a mouse model with a liver-specific knock-out of ACSL1, a major ACSL isoform in liver. Eliminating ACSL1 in liver resulted in a 50% decrease in total hepatic ACSL activity and a 25-35% decrease in long chain acyl-CoA content. Although the content of triacylglycerol was unchanged in Acsl1(L)(-/-) liver after mice were fed either low or high fat diets, in isolated primary hepatocytes the absence of ACSL1 diminished the incorporation of [(14)C]oleate into triacylglycerol. Further, small but consistent increases were observed in the percentage of 16:0 in phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine and of 18:1 in phosphatidylethanolamine and lysophosphatidylcholine, whereas concomitant decreases were seen in 18:0 in phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylserine, and lysophosphatidylcholine. In addition, decreases in long chain acylcarnitine content and diminished production of acid-soluble metabolites from [(14)C]oleate suggested that hepatic ACSL1 is important for mitochondrial beta-oxidation of long chain fatty acids. Because the Acsl1(L)(-/-) mice were not protected from developing either high fat diet-induced hepatic steatosis or insulin resistance, our study suggests that lowering the content of hepatic acyl-CoA without a concomitant decrease in triacylglycerol and other lipid intermediates is insufficient to protect against hepatic insulin resistance."

https://openalex.org/W2003718497,"The telosome/shelterin, a six-protein complex formed by TRF1, TRF2, RAP1, TIN2, POT1, and TPP1, functions as the core of the telomere interactome, acting as the molecular platform for the assembly of higher order complexes and coordinating cross-talks between various protein subcomplexes. Within the telosome, there are two oligonucleotide- or oligosaccharide-binding (OB) fold-containing proteins, TPP1 and POT1. They can form heterodimers that bind to the telomeric single-stranded DNA, an activity that is central for telomere end capping and telomerase recruitment. Through proteomic analyses, we found that in addition to POT1, TPP1 can associate with another OB fold-containing protein, OBFC1/AAF44. The yeast homolog of OBFC1 is Stn1, which plays a critical role in telomere regulation. We show here that OBFC1/AAF44 can localize to telomeres in human cells and bind to telomeric single-stranded DNA in vitro. Furthermore, overexpression of an OBFC1 mutant resulted in elongated telomeres in human cells, implicating OBFC1/AAF4 in telomere length regulation. Taken together, our studies suggest that OBFC1/AAF44 represents a new player in the telomere interactome for telomere maintenance."
https://openalex.org/W2069372817,"Acting via the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), glucocorticoids exert potent anti-inflammatory effects partly by repressing inflammatory gene transcription occurring via factors such as NF-kappaB. In the present study, the synthetic glucocorticoid, dexamethasone, induces expression of MKP-1 (mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) phosphatase-1) in human bronchial epithelial (BEAS-2B) and pulmonary (A549) cells. This correlates with reduced TNFalpha-stimulated p38 MAPK phosphorylation. Since NF-kappaB-dependent transcription and IL-8 protein, mRNA, and unspliced RNA (a surrogate of transcription rate) are sensitive to p38 MAPK inhibitors (SB203580 and SB239063), we explored the role of MKP-1 in repression of these outputs. Repression of TNFalpha-induced p38 MAPK phosphorylation, NF-kappaB-dependent transcription, and IL-8 expression by dexamethasone are sensitive to transcriptional or translational inhibitors. This indicates a role for de novo gene synthesis. Adenoviral expression of MKP-1 profoundly reduces p38 MAPK phosphorylation and IL-8 expression. Similarly, NF-kappaB-dependent transcription is significantly reduced to levels consistent with maximal p38 MAPK inhibition. Thus, MKP-1 attenuates TNFalpha-dependent activation of p38 MAPK, induction of IL-8 expression, and NF-kappaB-dependent transcription. Small interfering RNA knockdown of dexamethasone-induced MKP-1 expression partially reverses the repression of TNFalpha-activated p38 MAPK, demonstrating that MKP-1 participates in the dexamethasone-dependent repression of this pathway. In the presence of MKK6 (MAPK kinase 6), a p38 MAPK activator, dexamethasone dramatically represses TNFalpha-induced NF-kappaB-dependent transcription, and this is significantly reversed by MKP-1-targeting small interfering RNA. This reveals an important and novel role for transcriptional activation (transactivation) of MKP-1 in the repression of NF-kappaB-dependent transcription by glucocorticoids. We conclude that GR transactivation is essential to the anti-inflammatory properties of GR ligands."
https://openalex.org/W2022916608,"Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is an important regulator of neuronal development and functions. Although it was reported recently that mTOR signaling is critical for neuronal polarity, the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Here, we describe the molecular pathway of mTOR-dependent axon specification, in which the collapsing response mediator protein 2 (CRMP2) and Tau are major downstream targets. The activity of mTOR effector 70-kDa ribosomal protein S6 kinase (p70S6K) specifically increases in the axon during neuronal polarity formation. The mTOR inhibitor rapamycin suppresses the translation of some neuronal polarity proteins, including CRMP2 and Tau, thereby inhibiting axon formation. In contrast, constitutively active p70S6K up-regulates the translation of these molecules, thus inducing multiple axons. Exogenous CRMP2 and Tau facilitate axon formation, even in the presence of rapamycin. In the 5′-untranslated region of Tau and CRMP2 mRNAs, we identified a 5′-terminal oligopyrimidine tract, which mediates mTOR-governed protein synthesis. The 5′-terminal oligopyrimidine tract sequences of CRMP2 and Tau mRNAs strongly contribute to the up-regulation of their translation in the axon in response to the axonal activation of the mTOR-p70S6K pathway. Taken together, we conclude that the local translation of CRMP2 and Tau, regulated by mTOR-p70S6K, is critical for the specification of neuronal polarity."

Within a few hours, the elementary bodies differentiate into larger, metabolically active reticulate bodies, which proliferate but are noninfectious. Depending on the strain of C. trachomatis, the reticulate bodies transform back into elementary bodies after 1–3 days and are released into the extracellular medium to infect other cells (11Wyrick P.B.

Chlamydial species possess a type III secretion (T3S) system that secretes bacterial virulence factors into host cell cytosol and may control interactions between the inclusion and host-cell compartments (26Peters J. Wilson D.P. Myers G. Timms P. Bavoil P.M. Trends Microbiol. 2007; 15: 241-251Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Long before the adaptive immune response is activated, infected epithelial cells produce proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, including interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (27Rasmussen S.J. Eckmann L. Quayle A.J. Shen L. Zhang Y.X. Anderson D.J. Fierer J. Stephens R.S. Kagnoff M.F. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 77-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar), which recruit neutrophils to the site of infection and activate other immune effector cells. However, in many cases the immune system fails to clear the infection, and the chronic release of cytokines becomes a major contributor to the scarring and damage associated with the infection (28Darville T.

The innate immune response during C. trachomatis infection is initiated by chlamydial pathogen-associated molecular patterns, including lipopolysaccharides, which bind to pattern recognition receptors such as Toll-like receptors and cytosolic NOD-like receptors (NLRs), ultimately promoting pro-inflammatory cytokine gene expression and secretion of the cytokine proteins (31Darville T.

However, secretion of the key pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-1β is tightly regulated (38Dinarello C.A. Am. J. Clin. Nutr. 2006; 83: 447S-455SCrossref PubMed Google Scholar). First, pro-IL-1β is produced following activation of pattern recognition receptor, and the precursor is then cleaved into the mature form by the pro-inflammatory cysteine protease, caspase-1 (also known as interleukin-1 converting enzyme or ICE). The mechanism by which caspase-1 is activated in response to infection or tissue damage was found to be modulated by a macromolecular protein complex termed the “inflammasome,” which consists of an NLR family member, an adaptor protein (apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a caspase activation recruitment domain or ASC), and an inactive caspase-1 precursor (pro-caspase-1) (39Martinon F.

Previous studies demonstrated that IL-1β is produced in response to chlamydial infection in dendritic cells, macrophages, and monocytes (41Entrican G. Wilkie R. McWaters P. Scheerlinck J. Wood P.R.

Schachter J. Lavrich P. Lipsitz E.C. Francus T. Infect. Immun. 1989; 57: 2705-2711Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, C. trachomatis or Chlamydia caviae infection activates caspase-1 in epithelial cells or monocytes (43Ojcius D.M. Souque P. Perfettini J.L. Dautry-Varsat A. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 4220-4226PubMed Google Scholar, 45Cheng W. Shivshankar P. Li Z. Chen L. Yeh I.T. Zhong G. Infect. Immun. 2008; 76: 515-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 46Lu H. Shen C. Brunham R.C. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 1463-1469Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). However, whether caspase-1 activation during chlamydial infection requires the formation of an inflammasome remains unclear. Previous studies have shown that different pathogens can cause inflammasome-mediated caspase-1 activation in macrophages and monocytes (47Yu H.B. Finlay B.B. Cell Host Microbe. 2008; 4: 198-208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). However, epithelial cells lining mucosal surfaces are not only the preferred target for chlamydial infection and other intracellular pathogens but also play an important role in early host immune response to infection by secreting proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines (27Rasmussen S.J. Eckmann L. Quayle A.J. Shen L. Zhang Y.X. Anderson D.J. Fierer J. Stephens R.S. Kagnoff M.F. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 77-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). Although epithelial cells are not known to secrete large amounts of IL-1β, inflammasome-dependent caspase-1 activation in epithelial cells is known to contribute to lipid metabolism and membrane regeneration in epithelial cells damaged by the membrane-disrupting toxin, aerolysin (48Gurcel L. Abrami L. Girardin S. Tschopp J. van der Goot F.G. Cell. 2006; 126: 1135-1145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). As lipids are sorted from the Golgi apparatus to the chlamydial inclusion (13Hackstadt T. Fischer E.R. Scidmore M.A. Rockey D.D. Heinzen R.A.

U.S.A. 1995; 92: 4877-4881Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar), we therefore investigated whether C. trachomatis induces caspase-1 activation in epithelial cells via the assembly of an inflammasome. We demonstrated that C. trachomatis-induced caspase-1 activation is mediated by an inflammasome containing the NLR member, NLRP3. Several studies have demonstrated the involvement of T3S apparatus in inflammasome-mediated caspase-1 activation by different pathogens in macrophages and monocytes (50Franchi L. Stoolman J.

Therefore, we further investigated the mechanism by which C. trachomatis triggers the formation of the NLRP3 inflammasome. Our results showed that metabolically active chlamydiae, relying on their T3S apparatus, cause K+ efflux, which in turn leads to formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and ultimately NLRP3-dependent caspase-1 activation. Epithelial cells do not typically secrete large amounts of IL-1β; instead, caspase-1 activation in cervical epithelial cells contributes to development of the chlamydial inclusion. Cervical epithelial cells (HeLa 229 cells) and the LGV/L2 strain of C. trachomatis were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). HeLa cells were cultured in a humidified incubator at 37 °C with 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12) (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (Invitrogen), and 10 μg/ml gentamycin (Omega Scientific, Tarzana, CA). The number of bacterial inclusion forming units was determined as described previously (18Ojcius D.M. Degani H. Mispelter J. Dautry-Varsat A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7052-7058Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). N-Acetylcysteine (NAC), glibenclamide, penicillin G, and cycloheximide were from Sigma. KCl was from Fisher; chloramphenicol was from Calbiochem, and Z-YVAD-fmk was from Biovision (Mountain View, CA). Z-WEHD-fmk was purchased from R & D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). INPs (0341 and 0406) were kind gifts from Dr. Pia Keyser (Innate Pharmaceuticals, Umeå, Sweden). HeLa cells growing at 50% confluency on tissue culture flasks (Costar, Corning, NY) were infected with the LGV/L2 strain of C. trachomatis at a multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) of 3.0, unless specified otherwise, and incubated for the indicated times in an incubator at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Treatment with inhibitors or other reagents was performed at the indicated times and concentrations. HeLa cells stably expressing shRNA against NLRP3 and ASC were obtained by transducing HeLa cells with lentiviral particles. The sequences 5′-CCGGGCGTTAGAAACACTTCAAGAACTCGAGTTCTTGAAGTGTTTCTAACGCTTTTTG-3′ for human NLRP3 (Sigma; catalog number NM_004895) and 5′-CCGGCGGAAGCTCTTCAGTTTCACACTCGAGTGTGAAACTGAAGAGCTTCCGTTTTTG-3′ for human ASC (Sigma; catalog number NM_013258) were used separately to silence gene expression following the manufacturer's instructions. Nontarget shRNA control cells were also generated using an irrelevant sequence (Sigma; catalog number SHC002V). During the last hour of incubation, cells were labeled with FAM-YVAD-fmk caspase-1 FLICATM kit (Immunochemistry, Bloomington, IN), which binds activated caspase-1. Flow cytometric analysis was performed according to manufacturer's manual. In brief, cells were detached using TrypLETM Express (Invitrogen) and then incubated with 1× FLICA for 1 h followed by two washes and analyzed with a Guava EasyCyte (Guava Technologies, Hayward, CA). Samples were lysed using RIPA Lysis Buffer (Millipore) and loaded onto a 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and then transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore). Blots were blocked for 1 h with 5% (w/v) nonfat dried milk in TBST. The membrane was incubated overnight at 4 °C with rabbit anti-human caspase-1 antibody (Millipore) and then incubated again with conjugated anti-rabbit IgG horseradish peroxidase (Millipore). For confirmation of NLRP3 depletion by RNA interference, a 9% gel was used, and the blot was incubated with rabbit anti-human NLRP3 antibody (Sigma; catalog number HPA012878). Immunoreactive proteins were detected with ECL Plus Western blotting detection reagents (Amersham Biosciences) using a gel doc system (Bio-Rad). Cells were labeled with the cell-permeant ROS indicator dihydrocalcein-AM (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR), following the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, cells were plated in phenol red-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) and then infected and/or treated for the indicated times. Cells were loaded with 10 μm dihydrocalcein-AM in phosphate-buffered saline for 45 min at 37 °C, then recovered in growth media for 20 min, and finally analyzed by flow cytometry with a Guava EasyCyte. mRNA was isolated from HeLa cells using the Qiagen RNeasy kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) following the manufacturer's instructions, and total RNA was converted into cDNA by standard reverse transcription with Taqman® reverse transcriptase kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Quantitative PCR was performed with 1:50 of the cDNA preparation in the Mx3000P (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) in a 25-μl final volume with Brilliant QPCR master mix (Stratagene). The primers for human GAPDH were 5′-CTTCTCTGATGAGGCCCAAG-3′ forward and 5′-GCAGCAAACTGGAAAGGAAG-3′ reverse. Primers for human NLRP3 were 5′-CTTCCTTTCCAGTTTGCTGC-3′ forward and 5′-TCTCGCAGTCCACTTCCTTT-3′ reverse. Primers for human ASC were 5′-AGTTTCACACCAGCCTGGAA-3′ forward and 5′-TTTTCAAGCTGGCTTTTCGT-3′ reverse. Real time PCR included initial denaturation at 95 °C for 10 min, followed by 40 cycles of 95 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 1 min, 72 °C for 1 min, and one cycle of 95 °C for 1 min, 55 °C for 30 s, 95 °C for 30 s. Following 24 h of infection, cells were harvested using a cell scraper, frozen at −80 °C, thawed, and thoroughly vortexed before titrating on 50% confluent HeLa cells. Cells were then stained by Hoechst stain (Sigma) and anti-chlamydial antibody (Argene, North Massapequa, NY), mounted on slides, and quantified by immunofluorescence on a wide field fluorescence microscope (Leica, Deerfield, IL). The statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Instat software (GraphPad Software Inc, La Jolla, CA) by Student's t test and was considered significant at p < 0.05. Flow cytometry data were analyzed using FlowJo® software (Tree Star Inc, Ashland, OR). To characterize caspase-1 activation during C. trachomatis infection, we infected human cervical epithelial (HeLa) cells with C. trachomatis (L2) at a multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) of 3 for 12, 24, and 36 h. The 45-kDa procaspase-1 was cleaved into the active 20-kDa caspase-1 at 24 h post infection, and processing was further increased at 36 h post infection, as shown by the disappearance of the procaspase-1 zymogen and the concomitant appearance of the active caspase-1 (Fig. 1A). Similar results were obtained when we quantified caspase-1 activation in HeLa cells using a cell-permeable fluorescent reagent, FLICACasp1, which can specifically bind to the active form of caspase-1 (Fig. 1, B and C). Caspase-1 activation was barely noticeable at 12 h post infection but became significant after a day of infection (Fig. 1C), in agreement with recent studies (45Cheng W. Shivshankar P. Li Z. Chen L. Yeh I.T. Zhong G. Infect. Immun. 2008; 76: 515-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Next we sought to determine whether an inflammasome may be required for caspase-1 activation. The adaptor protein ASC can be coupled to different NLR family members and therefore seemed likely to play a role in inflammasome activation during C. trachomatis infection. As IPAF (also known as NLRC4 (57Ting J.P. Lovering R.C. Alnemri E.S. Bertin J. Boss J.M. Davis B.K. Flavell R.A. Girardin S.E. Godzik A. Harton J.A. Hoffman H.M. Hugot J.P. Inohara N. Mackenzie A.

Olinger L. Tatusov R.L. Zhao Q. Koonin E.V. Davis R.W. Science. 1998; 23: 754-759Crossref Scopus (1279) Google Scholar), we focused our initial attention on NLRP3 (also known as cryopyrin and Nalp3 (57Ting J.P. Lovering R.C. Alnemri E.S. Bertin J. Boss J.M. Davis B.K. Flavell R.A. Girardin S.E. Godzik A. Harton J.A. Hoffman H.M. Hugot J.P. Inohara N. Mackenzie A. Maltais L.J. Nunez G. Ogura Y. Otten L.A. Philpott D. Reed J.C. Reith W. Schreiber S. Steimle V. Ward P.A. Immunity. 2008; 28: 285-287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar)). A role for either ASC or NLRP3 during chlamydial infection was determined by silencing NLRP3 or ASC by shRNA in HeLa cells. mRNA expression of either inflammasome component was significantly reduced in comparison with nontarget shRNA, as measured by real time PCR (Fig. 2A), although higher levels of NLRP3 protein depletion were observed by Western blotting (Fig. 2A). Consistent with a role for the NLRP3 inflammasome in caspase-1 activation, individual knockdown of NLRP3 or ASC caused a reduction of ∼50% in the activation of caspase-1 after 24 h of C. trachomatis infection, when compared with wild type HeLa cells or cells that were transfected with nontarget shRNA (Fig. 2B). The reduction of caspase-1 activation was not complete (Fig. 2B) and was similar to the level of mRNA depletion by shRNA but lower than the level of NLRP3 protein depletion (Fig. 2A). These results imply that C. trachomatis infection induces caspase-1 activation through a process that requires, at least partially, the assembly of the NLRP3 inflammasome. We investigated the mechanism by which C. trachomatis induces caspase-1 activation in HeLa cells. Previous studies have shown that ATP-dependent ROS production in macrophages can activate caspase-1 (61Cruz C.M. Rinna A. Forman H.J. Ventura A.L. Persechini P.M. Ojcius D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 2871-2879Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar), and that asbestos and silica can activate the NLRP3 inflammasome by increasing ROS production (62Dostert C. Pétrilli V. Van Bruggen R. Steele C. Mossman B.T. Tschopp J. Science. 2008; 320: 674-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (2016) Google Scholar, 63Pétrilli V. Papin S. Dostert C. Mayor A. Martinon F. Tschopp J. Cell Death Differ. 2007; 14: 1583-1589Crossref PubMed Scopus (1072) Google Scholar). We therefore evaluated whether C. trachomatis increases ROS production in HeLa cells, using a commercially available fluorescent reagent, dihydrocalcein, to measure intracellular ROS production. Similarly to the time course for caspase-1 activation, there was essentially no ROS production during the first 12 h of chlamydial infection, but ROS production increased at 20 h post infection and continued to increase at 24 h post infection. However, unlike the case for caspase-1 activation, ROS levels returned to basal levels at 36 h post infection (Fig. 3A). To confirm whether chlamydia-induced ROS production may be involved in activation of caspase-1, we used the anti-oxidant NAC, which was previously shown to inhibit caspase-1 activation and NLRP3 assembly (61Cruz C.M. Rinna A. Forman H.J. Ventura A.L. Persechini P.M. Ojcius D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 2871-2879Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar, 63Pétrilli V. Papin S. Dostert C. Mayor A. Martinon F. Tschopp J. Cell Death Differ. 2007; 14: 1583-1589Crossref PubMed Scopus (1072) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the antioxidant NAC significantly diminished both ROS production and caspase-1 activation induced by 24 h of chlamydial infection (Fig. 3, B and C), suggesting that ROS production is upstream from caspase-1 activation. Besides ATP binding to the purinergic receptor, P2X7, the NLRP3 inflammasome can be activated by ligands as varied as asbestos, alum, monosodium urate, bacterial toxins, and K+ ionophores (64Martinon F. Mayor A. Tschopp J. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2009; 27: 229-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (1863) Google Scholar, 65Benko S. Philpott D.J. Girardin S.E. Cytokine. 2008; 43: 368-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). What all of these disparate ligands have in common is their ability to induce K+ efflux from cells (63Pétrilli V. Papin S. Dostert C. Mayor A. Martinon F. Tschopp J. Cell Death Differ. 2007; 14: 1583-1589Crossref PubMed Scopus (1072) Google Scholar, 66Franchi L. Kanneganti T.D. Dubyak G.R. Núñez G. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 18810-18818Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Given that an older study had shown that chlamydial infection causes loss of intracellular potassium (67Chang G.T. Moulder J.W. Infect. Immun. 1978; 19: 827-832Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we examined whether K+ efflux results in ROS production and/or caspase-1 activation during chlamydial infection. Indeed, specifically blocking potassium channels with glibenclamide or limiting K+ release by addition of extracellular potassium (KCl) was able not only to significantly reduce caspase-1 activation but also to diminish ROS production induced by 24 h of infection with C. trachomatis (Fig. 3, B and C). Thus, our results demonstrate that C. trachomatis infection leads to loss of intracellular potassium, which in turn causes production of ROS a"

These thresholds may be difficult to reverse and will have long-term consequences for restoration because of invasion legacies such as extinctions; because most invasive species cannot be eliminated given current technology and resources; and because even when controlled to low levels, invasive species continue to exert substantial pressure on native biodiversity. Restoration outcomes in the face of biological invasions are likely to be novel and will require long-term resource commitment, as any letup in invasive species management will result in the loss of the conservation gains achieved."
https://openalex.org/W1995584991,"Melanocortin-4 receptor (MC4R)-induced anorexigenic signaling in the hypothalamus controls body weight and energy homeostasis. So far, MC4R-induced signaling has been exclusively attributed to its coupling to G(s) proteins. In line with this monogamous G protein coupling profile, most MC4R mutants isolated from obese individuals showed a reduced ability to activate G(s). However, some mutants displayed enhanced G(s) coupling, suggesting that signaling pathways independent of G(s) may be involved in MC4R-mediated anorexigenic signaling. Here we report that the G(s) signaling-deficient MC4R-D90N mutant activates G proteins in a pertussis toxin-sensitive manner, indicating that this mutant is able to selectively interact with G(i/o) proteins. Analyzing a hypothalamic cell line (GT1-7 cells), we observed activation of pertussis toxin-sensitive G proteins by the wild-type MC4R as well, reflecting multiple coupling of the MC4R to G(s) and G(i/o) proteins in an endogenous cell system. Surprisingly, the agouti-related protein, which has been classified as a MC4R antagonist, selectively activates G(i/o) signaling in GT1-7 cells. Thus, the agouti-related protein antagonizes melanocortin-dependent G(s) activation not only by competitive antagonism but additionally by initiating G(i/o) protein-induced signaling as a biased agonist."
https://openalex.org/W2005909763,"Inside Oort Long-period comets are thought to come from the outermost region of the solar system, the Oort Cloud, where a large number of icy bodies orbit the Sun. Outer Oort Cloud bodies are more likely to penetrate the inner planetary region of the solar system as comets, because they experience stronger external gravitational perturbations. Inner Oort Cloud bodies, by contrast, are thought to be ejected before they reach observable orbits. Using numerical simulations that followed the orbital histories of bodies in the inner Oort Cloud, Kaib and Quinn (p. 1234 , published online 30 July 2009; see the Perspective by Duncan ) identified a dynamical pathway that allows comets in the inner Oort Cloud to move to the outer Oort Cloud, where they can be perturbed and enter the visible region in great numbers. According to this mechanism, the amount of mass in this region is consistent with the material needed to form the giant planets."
https://openalex.org/W2091974182,"SLC26 proteins function as anion exchangers, channels, and sensors. Previous cellular studies have shown that Slc26a3 and Slc26a6 interact with the R-region of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), (R)CFTR, via the Slc26-STAS (sulfate transporter anti-sigma) domain, resulting in mutual transport activation. We recently showed that Slc26a9 has both nCl−-HCO3− exchanger and Cl− channel function. In this study, we show that the purified STAS domain of Slc26a9 (a9STAS) binds purified (R)CFTR. When Slc26a9 and (R)CFTR fragments are co-expressed in Xenopus oocytes, both Slc26a9-mediated nCl−-HCO3− exchange and Cl− currents are almost fully inhibited. Deletion of the Slc26a9 STAS domain (a9-ΔSTAS) virtually eliminated the Cl− currents with only a modest affect on nCl−-HCO3− exchange activity. Co-expression of a9-ΔSTAS and the (R)CFTR fragment did not alter the residual a9-ΔSTAS function. Replacing the Slc26a9 STAS domain with the Slc26a6 STAS domain (a6-a9-a6) does not change Slc26a9 function and is no longer inhibited by (R)CFTR. These data indicate that the Slc26a9-STAS domain, like other Slc26-STAS domains, binds CFTR in the R-region. However, unlike previously reported data, this binding interaction inhibits Slc26a9 ion transport activity. These results imply that Slc26-STAS domains may all interact with (R)CFTR but that the physiological outcome is specific to differing Slc26 proteins, allowing for dynamic and acute fine tuning of ion transport for various epithelia.

Slc26 genes and proteins have attracted the attention of physiologists and geneticists. Why? Slc26a1 (Sat-1) was characterized as a Na+-independent SO42− transporter (1Bissig M. Hagenbuch B. Stieger B. Koller T. Meier P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3017-3021Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Given the transport characteristics of the founding member of the gene family, Slc26 proteins were assumed to be sulfate transporters. Disease phenotypes, clone characterization, and family additions demonstrate that the Slc26 proteins are anion transporters or channels (2Mount D.B. Romero M.F.

At one extreme, Slc26a5 in mammals is found in the hair cells of the inner ear (5Liu X.Z. Ouyang X.M. Xia X.J. Zheng J. Pandya A. Li F. Du L.L. Welch K.O. Petit C. Smith R.J. Webb B.T. Yan D.

Several Slc26 proteins are found in the epithelia of the lung, intestine, stomach, pancreas, and kidney, usually in apical membranes. Interestingly these are also tissues and membranes in which the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) 5The abbreviations used are: CFTRcystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulatorHAhemagglutininPKAprotein kinase AMBPmaltose-binding proteinwtwild-typeaaamino acid(s)pHiintracellular pHSTASsulfate transporter anti-sigma. 5The abbreviations used are: CFTRcystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulatorHAhemagglutininPKAprotein kinase AMBPmaltose-binding proteinwtwild-typeaaamino acid(s)pHiintracellular pHSTASsulfate transporter anti-sigma. has been found functionally or by immunohistochemistry.

In particular, these studies indicate that in expression systems, there is a reciprocal-stimulatory interaction of the STAS (sulfate transporter anti-sigma) domains of Slc26a3 and Slc26a6 with the regulatory region (R-region) of CFTR. These investigators hypothesized that this stimulatory interaction could account for the differences in pancreatic insufficiency and sufficiency observed in cystic fibrosis patients.

Two other groups have indicated that the Cl− conductance is not affected by the presence of HCO3− (10Chang M.H. Plata C. Zandi-Nejad K. Sindic A. Sussman C.R. Mercado A. Broumand V. Raghuram V.

We have recently demonstrated that Slc26a9 functions as both an electrogenic nCl−-HCO3− exchanger and a Cl− channel (10Chang M.H. Plata C. Zandi-Nejad K. Sindic A. Sussman C.R. Mercado A. Broumand V.

J. Physiol. 2007; 584: 333-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) found that WNK kinases inhibited the SLC26A9 Cl− conductance but that this effect was independent of kinase activity. One group has a preliminary report indicating that WNK3 decreased Cl− uptake, whereas WNK4 increased Cl− uptake via Slc26a9 expressed in Xenopus oocytes (13Plata C. Vázquez N. Romero M.F. Gamba G. FASEB J. 2008; 22 (abstr): 1202.9Google Scholar). Slc26a9 and CFTR are also co-expressed in several tissues. Slc26a9 protein has been localized to epithelia of the stomach and lung (9Xu J.

The R-region of CFTR was previously shown to increase the activity of Slc26a3 and Slc26a6 by interaction with STAS domains (6Ko S.B. Shcheynikov N. Choi J.Y. Luo X. Ishibashi K. Thomas P.J. Kim J.Y.

Chem. 2008; 283: 8711-8722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Because Slc26a9 displays several different modes of ion transport, we asked if the R-region of CFTR would also increase the activity of Slc26a9. Our results indicate that the R-region of CFTR does interact with the STAS domain of Slc26a9. However, in the case of Slc26a9 this apparently similar interaction results in inhibition of Slc26a9 ion transport. Xenopus laevis were housed and cared for in accordance and approval of the Institutional Care and Use Committees of Case Western Reserve University (Xenopus) and the Mayo Clinic (Xenopus). Cloning and characterization of Slc26a9 was recently reported by our group (10Chang M.H. Plata C. Zandi-Nejad K. Sindic A. Sussman C.R. Mercado A. Broumand V. Raghuram V. Mount D.B. Romero M.F. J. Membr. Biol. 2009; 228: 125-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). All of the Slc26a9 constructs used for functional expression were subcloned into the X. laevis expression vector pGEMHE. We engineered BssHII sites flanking the “STAS domain” of Slc26a9 (BssHII 5′ site: bp 1516–1521; BssHII 3′ site, bp 2221–2226), which also maintained the correct reading frame. The intermediate Slc26a9 point mutation construct (R524Q-Slc26a9) when expressed in Xenopus oocytes had wild-type Slc26a9 function (not shown). The STAS region (bp 1528–2199, “…YNRAQEI…FPSIHDA…”) was removed by restriction digest with BssHII and agarose gel purification of the major product. The resulting fragment was religated resulting in Slc26a9-ΔSTAS. The resulting clone was verified by sequencing prior to experiments. We made cassette constructions of Slc26a6 and Slc26a9, of which silent mutations encoding NurI (5′ of transmembrane span) and MunI sites (3′ of transmembrane span) at conserved residues were engineered. From cassette Slc26a6, the transmembrane domain (NurI-Slc26a6-MunI) was excised and discarded. From cassette Slc26a9, the transmembrane domain (NurI-Slc26a9-MunI) was excised and ligated between the Slc26a6 N and C termini to result in “a6-a9-a6.” CFTR construct boundaries were according to the previous definitions of Chan and co-workers (17Chan K.W. Csanády L. Seto-Young D. Nairn A.C. Gadsby D.C. J. Gen. Physiol. 2000; 116: 163-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar): nucleotide-binding domain (NBD1)CFTR (433–633 aa); R-region (R)CFTR (634–835 aa); (NBD1+R)CFTR (433–835 aa); and (NBD1+RΔ3)CFTR (433–707 aa). These regions were subcloned into a Xenopus oocyte expression plasmid, cRNA were made and injected into oocytes. The C terminus of each construct was tagged with an HA epitope. After 3–5 days, membrane and supernatants were isolated and resolved on 12% SDS-PAGE. Proteins transferred to nitrocellulose membrane for Western blots was performed using an anti-HA antibody. The predicted sizes for the R-region, NBD1+R, NBD1+RΔ3, and NBD1 are ∼23, 45, 31, and 22 kDa, respectively (see Fig. 2). Construction of the vector (pGEVII) encodes the immunoglobin-binding domain of streptococcal protein G (GB1 domain) and was linked to the N terminus of the mouse Slc26a9-STAS domain (18Huth J.R. Bewley C.A. Jackson B.M. Hinnebusch A.G. Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 2359-2364Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). The mouse GB1-Slc26a9-STAS fusion was generated by using a similar PCR strategy for generating the mouse Slc26a9-STAS fragment with in-frame restriction sites, i.e. forward STAS GEVII BamHI (StasGB1BamF; 5′-CGGGATCCCAGGTCATGGACACGGACATCTAT-3′) and reverse STAS GEVII Xho (StasGB1XhoR; 5′-CCGCTCGAGAGCATTTGCTTGGGCAAAGAGGAC-3′). After restriction digest with BamHI and XhoI, this fragment was ligated into pGEVII (18Huth J.R. Bewley C.A. Jackson B.M. Hinnebusch A.G. Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 2359-2364Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) also cut with BamHI and XhoI using a QuickLigation reaction (New England BioLabs). The resulting construct (GB1-a9STAS) was sequenced in its entirety (W. M. Keck Sequencing, Yale University, New Haven, CT) to verify that the resulting fusion was in-frame. BL21(DE3) Escherichia coli, codon plus, were transformed with the GB1-Slc26a9-STAS construct and small-scale expressions were examined for induction and solubility. GB1-a9STAS protein was best expressed in BL21(DE3) cells (Stratagene) in YT(2X) media at 37 °C after induction at OD (600 nm) = 0.5 with 0.4 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalctopyranoside. The culture was left overnight with temperatures reduced to 25 °C after isopropyl β-d-thiogalctopyranoside induction. Cultures of 6 liter of YT(2X) media generate a cell pellet of ∼50 g, which was immediately used for purification of GB1-a9STAS. The cell pellet was suspended in buffer A (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 200 mm KCl, and 10% glycerol) with a protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma) according to the manufacturer's protocol. B-Per reagent (Fisher) was added to lyse the cells, and cell suspension was maintained at room temperature for 5–20 min to allow complete lysis. The cell lysate was cleared by centrifugation at 19,000 × g for 30 min. Cleared lysate was loaded onto a pre-equilibrated nickel-affinity resin (Qiagen) in buffer A. The lysate was gently equilibrated with resin for 1 h at 4 °C using a rotational orbiter. The resin was washed 3–4 times with buffer A, and again by buffer A containing 20 mm imidazole to elute nonspecific proteins bound to the resin. GB1-a9STAS was eluted from the nickel resin after pouring the resin into a column and then adding 250 mm imidazole in buffer A. The protein fractions were collected and concentrated to 500 μl using Amicon filters (Amicon). The salt concentration of the protein solution was reduced to 25 mm. The protein solution was then loaded onto an anion exchange column (Mono-Q, GE Healthcare), and the protein bound to the Mono-Q column at a flow rate of 0.25 ml/min. The Mono-Q column was washed with 250 mm, 500 mm, and 1 m NaCl containing buffer B (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 25 mm KCl, and 10% glycerol), and elution fractions were collected. GB1-a9STAS eluted at 500 mm NaCl (buffer B) as analyzed by Coomassie-stained SDS-PAGE. The GB1-a9STAS protein fractions were pooled and concentrated. Concentrated GB1-a9STAS protein was loaded onto a Sephadex 75 size exclusion column (GE Healthcare), and fractions were analyzed using SDS-PAGE. The a9STAS protein without the GB1 sequence was cloned into pMCSG19c plasmid, along with a maltose-binding protein (MBP) fusion for enhanced solubility during expression in E. coli (19Donnelly M.I. Zhou M. Millard C.S. Clancy S. Stols L. Eschenfeldt W.H. Collart F.R. Joachimiak A. Protein Expr. Purif. 2006; 47: 446-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The MBP was removed by co-expression of tobacco vein mottling virus protease from pRK1037 plasmid (both plasmids were gifts from Dr. Mark Donnelly). The plasmids were cotransformed into BL21(DE3) codon plus cells (Novagen). The MBP-a9STAS fusion protein was expressed and autocleavage of MBP was initiated by induction with 0.5 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalctopyranoside. The purification procedure for a9STAS is similar to the GB1-a9STAS purification (above). (R)CFTR was isolated and purified (by the Forman-Kay laboratory) as previously reported (20Baker J.M. Hudson R.P. Kanelis V. Choy W.Y. Thibodeau P.H. Thomas P.J. Forman-Kay J.D. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2007; 14: 738-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Briefly, (R)CFTR was purified using denaturing conditions and suspended in buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 400 mm NaCl, 6 m guanidine HCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol) (20Baker J.M. Hudson R.P. Kanelis V. Choy W.Y. Thibodeau P.H. Thomas P.J. Forman-Kay J.D. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2007; 14: 738-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). For these experiments, this (R)CFTR solution was dialyzed in 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 200 mm KCl, 10% glycerol to fold into the native protein form (20Baker J.M. Hudson R.P. Kanelis V. Choy W.Y. Thibodeau P.H. Thomas P.J. Forman-Kay J.D. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2007; 14: 738-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar), although the polypeptide likely remains largely unstructured. “Native (R)CFTR” was used for binding experiments as described below. An equimolar amount of dialyzed (R)CFTR and a9STAS were mixed, and the mixture was incubated at 4 °C overnight. The incubated protein mixture was then loaded onto a pre-equilibrated nickel-affinity resin in buffer A (see above). The resin/protein mixture was incubated at 4 °C for 1 h using an orbitor, loaded onto a small column, and the column was washed 3–4 times with buffer A. Proteins were eluted using 250 mm imidazole in buffer A. For the control experiments, (R)CFTR and a9STAS (not shown) were separately bound to the resin and eluted as above. Complexes isolated by nickel affinity pull-down, with and without the GB1 fusion domain, were then loaded onto a Sephadex 75 size exclusion column at a flow rate of 0.25 ml/min. After separation, protein fractions were analyzed by Coomassie-stained SDS-PAGE. Female X. laevis were purchased from Xenopus Express (Beverly Hills, FL). Slc26 clones were subcloned into the pGEMHE Xenopus expression vector (21Liman E.R. Tytgat J. Hess P. Neuron. 1992; 9: 861-871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (979) Google Scholar). Oocytes were collagenase dissociated (22Romero M.F. Fong P. Berger U.V. Hediger M.A. Boron W.F. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: F425-F432Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Capped cRNA was synthesized using the T7 mMessage mMachine kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). Oocytes were injected with 50 nl of cRNA as previously for Slc26a9 (for Cl−-HCO3− exchange mode, 0.5 μg/μl, 25 ng/oocyte; for Cl− channel mode, 1 ng/oocyte) (10Chang M.H. Plata C. Zandi-Nejad K.

Electrophysiology protocols were performed as previously reported for Slc26a9 (10Chang M.H. Plata C. Zandi-Nejad K. Sindic A. Sussman C.R. Mercado A. Broumand V. Raghuram V. Mount D.B. Romero M.F. J.

All solutions were either ND96 (96 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.5) or iso-osmotic ion replacements (23Sciortino C.M. Romero M.F. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 1999; 277: F611-F623Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The Na+ replacement was choline; and the Cl− replacement was gluconate. For HCO3− solutions, we used 5% CO2, 33 mm HCO3−, pH 7.5. For these experiments, oocytes were injected with 0.5 ng of cRNA and membrane currents were recorded with an OC-725C voltage clamp (Warner Instruments, Hamden, CT), filtered at 2–5 kHz, digitized at 10 kHz. I-V protocols consisted of 40-ms steps from Vh (−60 mV) to −160 and +60 mV in 20-mV steps (23Sciortino C.M. Romero M.F. Am. J. Physiol.

Ion selective microelectrodes were used to monitor pHi and intracellular Cl− ([Cl−]i) of oocytes (22Romero M.F. Fong P. Berger U.V. Hediger M.A. Boron W.F. Am. J.

Intracellular pH, Cl−, and Na+ microelectrodes had slopes of at least −54 mV/pH unit or decade, respectively. The a9STAS protein was expressed and purified to near homogeneity using nickel-affinity chromatography, anion exchange chromatography, and gel filtration chromatography (see “Experimental Procedures”). Purified a9STAS exists as two forms: 67 and 33 kDa, presumed dimer and monomer, respectively (seen in Fig. 1, B and C). Both protein forms were found to be a9STAS as confirmed by MS-MS analysis (Mayo Clinic Proteomic Core), and the 67 kDa appears to be a homodimer resistant to the SDS and reductants used. We used the larger 67-kDa protein fraction for binding/interaction experiments. The (R)CFTR protein region (21 kDa) was purified using denaturing conditions then renatured as instructed by the Forman-Kay procedures (20Baker J.M. Hudson R.P. Kanelis V. Choy W.Y. Thibodeau P.H. Thomas P.J. Forman-Kay J.D. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2007; 14: 738-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). This procedure ensures proper folding of the (R)CFTR protein (20Baker J.M. Hudson R.P. Kanelis V. Choy W.Y. Thibodeau P.H. Thomas P.J. Forman-Kay J.D. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2007; 14: 738-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). To examine the possibility that the Slc26a9-STAS (a9STAS) protein and (R)CFTR might interact, we used a pulldown assay utilizing nickel-affinity resin binding (Fig. 1A). The a9STAS with a COOH-terminal (His)6 tag was incubated with (R)CFTR (no tag) in equimolar amounts then bound to nickel affinity resin. The nickel resin was washed extensively (buffer A) to remove unbound (R)CFTR before the protein was eluted (Fig. 1B). As a control, (R)CFTR was shown to not bind nickel resin. As Fig. 1A illustrates, (R)CFTR and a9STAS interact because eluted protein fractions contain both a9STAS and (R)CFTR. To determine which oligomeric form of a9STAS interacts with (R)CFTR, we separated the a9STAS-(R)CFTR fraction isolated in pull-downs using gel filtration chromatography (Fig. 1D); eluted fractions are indicated as 10, 11, etc. for GB1-a9STAS (Fig. 1B) and a9STAS (Fig. 1C). The first protein off the column was observed as a 67-kDa a9STAS band by SDS-PAGE, then a very small amount of 67-kDa a9STAS and (R)CFTR, indicating that this interaction appears to be very weak to non-existent (Fig. 1, B, lane 10, C, lane 10). Later eluting fractions show that the monomeric, 33-kDa a9STAS predominantly associates with (R)CFTR (Fig. 1, B, lane 11, C, lane 12). These are the only proteins that elute from the column (Fig. 1D). Molecular mass estimates (determined by calibration curve) are 204 kDa (peak in fx-10) and 51.3 kDa (peak in fx-11). 204 kDa is consistent with 6×-(GB1)a9STAS, and 51.3 kDa is consistent with 1 (GB1)a9STAS (33.5 kDa) plus 1 (R)CFTR (21 kDa). To rule out any involvement of GB1 domain in the interaction, we purified the a9STAS without the GB1 domain (24 kDa) attached and re-performed the binding experiment (Fig. 1C). As Fig. 1C indicates, a9STAS alone and (R)CFTR bind strongly and clearly the GB1 fusion domain is not required. These data also indicate that some structural changes in a9STAS could occur to control the Slc26a9 channel activity (see “Discussion”). To determine whether (R)CFTR or (NBD1+R)CFTR might interact functionally with Slc26a9, we first expressed these pieces in Xenopus oocytes (Fig. 2). As noted these boundaries were previously functionally designated by Chan and co-workers (17Chan K.W. Csanády L. Seto-Young D. Nairn A.C. Gadsby D.C. J. Gen. Physiol. 2000; 116: 163-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). As the Western blots in Fig. 2 illustrate, (R)CFTR and (NBD1+R)CFTR are made by Xenopus oocytes and are found in both the membrane (m) and supernatant (s) fractions. Because Ko and co-workers (6Ko S.B. Shcheynikov N. Choi J.Y. Luo X. Ishibashi K. Thomas P.J. Kim J.Y. Kim K.H. Lee M.G. Naruse S. Muallem S. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5662-5672Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar) previously found that Slc26a3 and Slc26a6 can interact with the R-region of CFTR, we co-expressed (NBD1+R)CFTR (Fig. 1) with Slc26a9. Fig. 3 shows two experiments measuring intracellular pH (pHi) in the presence of CO2/HCO3−. As we have shown previously for Slc26a9 (10Chang M.H. Plata C. Zandi-Nejad K. Sindic A. Sussman C.R. Mercado A. Broumand V. Raghuram V. Mount D.B. Romero M.F. J. Membr. Biol. 2009; 228: 125-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), removal of Cl− in CO2/HCO3− results in an alkalinization (↑pHi) and depolarization (Fig. 3A), i.e. nCl−-HCO3−, exchange. Importantly, when (NBD1+R)CFTR was co-expressed with Slc26a9 (Fig. 3B), this nCl−-HCO3− exchange activity disappears. When CO2/HCO3− was removed, only Slc26a9 alone (Fig. 3A) results in a “pHi overshoot” (dotted blue line and bracket), which is also diagnostic of cellular HCO3− loading (3Romero M.F. Chang M.H. Plata C. Zandi-Nejad K. Broumand V. Sussman C.R. Mount D.B. Novartis Found. Symp. 2006; 273 (discussion 138–147, 261–264): 126-138Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In other experiments, we voltage clamped Xenopus oocytes to examine the Slc26a9 Cl− currents. Again as we previously reported for Slc26a9, in the presence of Cl− the currents are large (10Chang M.H. Plata C. Zandi-Nejad K. Sindic A. Sussman C.R. Mercado A. Broumand V. Raghuram V. Mount D.B. Romero M.F. J. Membr. Biol. 2009; 228: 125-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4A). Cl− removal decreases these currents (Fig. 4B). Co-expression of (NBD1+R)CFTR with Slc26a9 dramatically reduces the currents in the presence (Fig. 4C) or absence of Cl− (Fig. 4D). This inhibition of Slc26a9 Cl− channel activity occurs over the entire voltage range tested (Fig. 4E). Next, we sought to determine whether the (NBD1+R)CFTR inhibition of Slc26a9 function was due to an interaction with the Slc26a9-STAS domain. For these experiments, we deleted the STAS domain of Slc26a9 (a9-ΔSTAS, see diagram in Fig. 7, top). Deletion of the STAS domain did not generate a “dead” transporter/channel (Figs. 5 and 6). The Slc26a9 currents are dramatically reduced (<80%), yet still present and still responsive to alterations of bath Cl− (Fig. 5, B and D–G, red). These a9-ΔSTAS currents are small but are clearly different from the water-injected control cells (Fig. 5, C–G, blue). Although there is some variation in the Slc26a9 and a9-ΔSTAS anion currents in the absence (Fig. 5, squares) or presence of CO2/HCO3− (Fig. 5, triangles), these differences are not statistically significant. To highlight that a9-ΔSTAS currents are different from the water-injected control currents, currents are plotted at −160, −60, and +60 mV (Fig. 5, E–G). These data indicate that the small a9-ΔSTAS currents measured are still anion selective and can be distinguished from the water-injected controls.FIGURE 5The Slc26a9-STAS domain is needed for Slc26a9 currents.

https://openalex.org/W2012907914,"The simultaneous activation of many distinct G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and heterotrimeric G proteins play a major role in various pathological conditions. Pan-inhibition of GPCR signaling by small molecules thus represents a novel strategy to treat various diseases. To better understand such therapeutic approach, we have characterized the biomolecular target of BIM-46187, a small molecule pan-inhibitor of GPCR signaling. Combining bioluminescence and fluorescence resonance energy transfer techniques in living cells as well as in reconstituted receptor-G protein complexes, we observed that, by direct binding to the Galpha subunit, BIM-46187 prevents the conformational changes of the receptor-G protein complex associated with GPCR activation. Such a binding prevents the proper interaction of receptors with the G protein heterotrimer and inhibits the agonist-promoted GDP/GTP exchange. These observations bring further evidence that inhibiting G protein activation through direct binding to the Galpha subunit is feasible and should constitute a new strategy for therapeutic intervention."
https://openalex.org/W2054971453,"AMBN (ameloblastin) is an enamel matrix protein that regulates cell adhesion, proliferation, and differentiation of ameloblasts. In AMBN-deficient mice, ameloblasts are detached from the enamel matrix, continue to proliferate, and form a multiple cell layer; often, odontogenic tumors develop in the maxilla with age. However, the mechanism of AMBN functions in these biological processes remains unclear. By using recombinant AMBN proteins, we found that AMBN had heparin binding domains at the C-terminal half and that these domains were critical for AMBN binding to dental epithelial cells. Overexpression of full-length AMBN protein inhibited proliferation of human ameloblastoma AM-1 cells, but overexpression of heparin binding domain-deficient AMBN protein had no inhibitory effect. In full-length AMBN-overexpressing AM-1 cells, the expression of Msx2, which is involved in the dental epithelial progenitor phenotype, was decreased, whereas the expression of cell proliferation inhibitors p21 and p27 was increased. We also found that the expression of enamelin, a marker of differentiated ameloblasts, was induced, suggesting that AMBN promotes odontogenic tumor differentiation. Thus, our results suggest that AMBN promotes cell binding through the heparin binding sites and plays an important role in preventing odontogenic tumor development by suppressing cell proliferation and maintaining differentiation phenotype through Msx2, p21, and p27."

Our results not only reveal conformational changes of E3 during ubiquitin transfer but also provide a promising approach to custom-made E3 for targeted proteolysis. Protein modification by ubiquitin and ubiquitin-like proteins is a common mechanism through which numerous cellular pathways are regulated (1Pickart C.M. Eddins M.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1695: 55-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (1020) Google Scholar). The canonical cascade of ubiquitination involves the action of three enzymes, termed E1, E2, and E3, which activate and then conjugate ubiquitin to its substrates (2Glickman M.H. Ciechanover A. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 373-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (3340) Google Scholar, 3Kerscher O. Felberbaum R. Hochstrasser M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2006; 22: 159-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (1219) Google Scholar). The E3 ligase catalyzes the final step in ubiquitin transfer in a substrate-specific manner. Despite advances in understanding the enzymatic cascade of ubiquitination, the mechanism of ubiquitin transfer to the substrate remains an outstanding issue (4Hochstrasser M. Cell. 2006; 124: 27-34Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). In particular, the role of E3 ubiquitin ligases and how they adapt to progressively modified substrates to maintain specific ubiquitin chain topology is still a mystery. The known E3s belong to three protein families: HECT, RING, and U-box. HECT domain enzymes form a covalent intermediate with ubiquitin before the final transfer of ubiquitin to substrates. In contrast, RING and U-box E3s have been suggested to function as adaptors that position the substrate in close proximity to the E2-ubiquitin thioester (E2-Ub) (5Pickart C.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 503-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (2909) Google Scholar). It has become common “wisdom” that the substrate has to be precisely positioned to get ubiquitinated (6Passmore L.A. Barford D. Biochem. J. 2004; 379: 513-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). The positioning hypothesis originally predicted that E3 substrates would have a specific ubiquitination site. However, the absence of “consensus” ubiquitination sites has become apparent in an increasing list of E3 substrates (7Cardozo T. Pagano M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 5: 739-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (881) Google Scholar, 8Paltoglou S. Roberts B.J. Oncogene. 2007; 26: 604-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 9Wang X. Herr R.A. Chua W.J. Lybarger L. Wiertz E.J. Hansen T.H. J. Cell Biol. 2007; 177: 613-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). In addition, the crystal structures of several ubiquitination machinery components have revealed a puzzling gap (∼50 Å) between the substrate binding sites and the E2 active sites (10Zheng N. Schulman B.A. Song L. Miller J.J. Jeffrey P.D. Wang P. Chu C. Koepp D.M. Elledge S.J. Pagano M. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. Harper J.W. Pavletich N.P.

Cell. 2000; 102: 533-539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar). This raises a fundamental question in ubiquitin transfer. How does the ubiquitin molecule shuttle from the E2 to substrates? Though several interesting models for ubiquitin transfer have been proposed, only limited explicit experimental evidence support these models (4Hochstrasser M. Cell. 2006; 124: 27-34Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). We used carboxyl terminus of Hsc70-interacting protein (CHIP) 3The abbreviations used are: CHIPcarboxyl terminus of Hsc70-interacting proteinTPRtetratricopeptide repeatUbubiquitinE2-Ububiquitin-conjugated E2GFPgreen fluorescent proteinDTTdithiothreitolFKBPFK506 binding proteinFRBFKBP12-rapamycin binding domainTEVtobacco etch virus. 3The abbreviations used are: CHIPcarboxyl terminus of Hsc70-interacting proteinTPRtetratricopeptide repeatUbubiquitinE2-Ububiquitin-conjugated E2GFPgreen fluorescent proteinDTTdithiothreitolFKBPFK506 binding proteinFRBFKBP12-rapamycin binding domainTEVtobacco etch virus. as a model E3 system to investigate the role of substrate positioning in its ubiquitination. CHIP is a protein quality control E3 that consists of an NH2-terminal tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domain, a helical linker domain, and a COOH-terminal U-box domain (12Ballinger C.A. Connell P. Wu Y. Hu Z. Thompson L.J. Yin L.Y. Patterson C. Mol. Cell Biol. 1999; 19: 4535-4545Crossref PubMed Scopus (750) Google Scholar, 13Patterson C. Sci. STKE. 2002; 2002: PE4PubMed Google Scholar). The TPR domain of CHIP binds directly to EEVD motifs located at the COOH termini of Hsc/Hsp70 and Hsp90, whereas the U-box domains possess ubiquitin ligase activity. CHIP recruits E2 enzymes of the Ubc4/5 family to ubiquitinate misfolded proteins that occupy the chaperone substrate-binding sites, thus remodeling the chaperones from protein-refolding complexes to complexes that promote degradation (14McDonough H. Patterson C. Cell Stress Chaperones. 2003; 8: 303-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). Using the chaperone as an adaptor, CHIP targets a variety of substrates for ubiquitination (15Cyr D.M. Hohfeld J. Patterson C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 368-375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). In the absence of substrates, CHIP is also able to ubiquitinate the bound chaperones (16Qian S.B. McDonough H. Boellmann F. Cyr D.M. Patterson C. Nature. 2006; 440: 551-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Thus, there is apparent substrate diversity for CHIP-mediated ubiquitination. Insights into the mechanism of action of CHIP have been provided by an x-ray crystal structure which reveals a remarkable, highly asymmetric dimer (25Zhang M. Windheim M. Roe S.M. Peggie M. Cohen P. Prodomou C. Pearl L.H. Mol. Cell. 2005; 20: 525-538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). Here, we demonstrate the existence of intrinsic structural flexibility in the CHIP homodimer that is required for substrate polyubiquitination. The flexible orientation allows CHIP to accommodate substrates with different sizes and structures. Mutations that restrict the flexibility of CHIP markedly decrease substrate ubiquitination, whereas maintaining flexibility enables us to rebuild a functional ubiquitin ligase with altered substrate specificity. Our results provide evidence for the importance of structural flexibility in E3 ligases, which we propose is of general importance to orchestrate progressive ubiquitin conjugation on substrates. carboxyl terminus of Hsc70-interacting protein tetratricopeptide repeat ubiquitin ubiquitin-conjugated E2 green fluorescent protein dithiothreitol FK506 binding protein FKBP12-rapamycin binding domain tobacco etch virus. carboxyl terminus of Hsc70-interacting protein tetratricopeptide repeat ubiquitin ubiquitin-conjugated E2 green fluorescent protein dithiothreitol FK506 binding protein FKBP12-rapamycin binding domain tobacco etch virus. Prokaryotic constructs expressing glutathione S-transferase or His6-tagged CHIP, CHIP(K30A), CHIP(H260Q), CHIP(ΔTPR), UbcH5a, UbcH5a(C85A) were described previously. FK506 binding protein (FKBP) and FKBP12-rapamycin binding domain (FRB) domains were amplified by PCR from constructs pC4EN-F1 and pC4-RHE, respectively (provided by ARIAD Pharmaceuticals, Inc). Green fluorescent protein (GFP) and U-box fusion constructs were made using standard cloning techniques and were subcloned into pET vector (Novagen). Monoclonal anti-Hsp70 (SPA810) and Hsp70 purified protein were purchased from Stressgen. Polyclonal anti-UbcH5 antibody was from Boston Biochem. Monoclonal anti-FLAG was from Sigma, anti-hemagglutinin from Roche Applied Science, anti-His6 from BD Biosciences. Rabbit E1 and Ub(K0) were purchased from Boston Biochem. All proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) (Stratagene). His-tagged proteins were purified via nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid agarose (BD Biosciences) and glutathione S-transferase-tagged proteins were purified using glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). For untagged proteins, the purified proteins were subject to cleavage by thrombin (Novagen). Proteins were dialyzed against Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4). In vitro ubiquitination assays were performed in the presence of 0.1 μm purified rabbit E1 (BioMol), 2 μm UbcH5a, 3 μm CHIP, 50 μm ubiquitin (Sigma), 1 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), 2 mm MgCl2, and 4 mm ATP. Reactions were carried out at 37 °C, and samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting using appropriate antibodies. A typical ubiquitination reaction involves E1, E2, E3, and substrates, with the products of ubiquitin conjugation varying from free ubiquitin chains, ubiquitin conjugated substrates, and autoubiquitination products of E2 and E3 (1Pickart C.M. Eddins M.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1695: 55-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (1020) Google Scholar). It is thus important to differentiate the substrate ubiquitination from the other ubiquitin conjugates to fully analyze the functionality of E3. E3 autoubiquitination has been treated as a hallmark activity for single subunit E3s (2Glickman M.H. Ciechanover A. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 373-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (3340) Google Scholar). How this process is coordinated with substrate ubiquitination remains unexplored. To evaluate CHIP-mediated ubiquitin conjugation, we performed a reconstituted in vitro ubiquitination assay using UbcH5 as E2 and Hsp70 as the substrate of CHIP. Consistent with our previous report (3Kerscher O. Felberbaum R. Hochstrasser M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2006; 22: 159-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (1219) Google Scholar), we observed nearly complete polyubiquitination of Hsp70 in the presence of wild-type CHIP (Fig. 1A, top panel). Notably, CHIP autoubiquitination was restricted predominantly to monoubiquitination under these circumstances (Fig. 1A, middle panel). This was not due to the competition with Hsp70, as we observed a similar ubiquitination pattern with CHIP(K30A), a TPR mutant that does not bind chaperones (Fig. 1A). In fact, the pattern of CHIP autoubiquitination was unchanged in the absence or presence of Hsp70 (supplemental Fig. S1). Unexpectedly, UbcH5a underwent autoubiquitination in a substrate-independent, E3-dependent manner (Fig. 1A, bottom panel). To separate isopeptide conjugates (UbcH5a-Ub) from UbcH5a-Ub thioesters, we treated samples with DTT and found that the DTT-sensitive thioesters migrate faster on SDS-PAGE (17Ozkan E. Yu H. Deisenhofer J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 18890-18895Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) (supplemental Fig. S2). By using a low concentration of DTT, we were able to detect both UbcH5a-Ub and UbcH5a-Ub thioester species on the same gel. Unlike some E2s that are capable of assembling ubiquitin chains without E3 (1Pickart C.M. Eddins M.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1695: 55-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (1020) Google Scholar, 18Chen Z.J. Niles E.G. Pickart C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15698-15704Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), UbcH5a requires the presence of E3 to mediate ubiquitin transfer. A U-box mutant of CHIP, H260Q, failed to generate any ubiquitin conjugates, resulting in accumulation of UbcH5a-Ub thioesters (Fig. 1A, bottom panel). Therefore, the ratio of UbcH5a-Ub and UbcH5a-Ub thioester species can be used as an indicator of the relative efficiency of ubiquitin transfer. E2 autoubiquitination could be due to an intramolecular transfer of ubiquitin from its own thioester bond, or to an intermolecular transfer. To distinguish these possibilities, we mixed nontagged wild-type UbcH5a and His6-tagged UbcH5a(C85A), an active site mutant that cannot load ubiquitin via the thioester bond. In the absence of CHIP, no ubiquitin transfer occurred, confirming that ubiquitin transfer by UbcH5a is E3-dependent (Fig. 1B). In the presence of CHIP, both wild-type UbcH5a and the C85A mutant were ubiquitinated (Fig. 1B). These results are consistent with an intermolecular transfer from one activated E2-Ub thioester to another molecule of UbcH5a, which do not need to be in the form of an E2-Ub thioester. Therefore, the E3 not only recruits an E2-Ub thioester but also plays a critical role in the activation of E2. The variations of ubiquitin conjugates in CHIP-mediated reactions share one important feature. The formation of ubiquitin isopeptide conjugates requires the presence of a functional U-box. In the presence of CHIP(H260Q), a U-box mutant that abolishes E2 binding, we did not detect any ubiquitin conjugates (Fig. 1A). Thus, the labile thioesters of UbcH5a-Ub do not automatically lead to ubiquitin transfer. Further supporting this notion, we failed to observe any ubiquitin transfer from UbcH5-Ub to C85A mutant in the absence of CHIP (Fig. 1B). In contrast, CHIP(K30A), a TPR domain mutant that abolishes chaperone binding, maintains the capacity to mediate the formation of ubiquitin isopeptide conjugates of UbcH5 (Fig. 1A). Our results are in line with the recent report that the RING E3 triggers subtle conformation changes in the bound E2, stimulating ubiquitin release from the E2 cysteine and transfer to the substrate (4Hochstrasser M. Cell. 2006; 124: 27-34Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). The E2 is at the center of a cascade of ubiquitin transfer, linking activation of the ubiquitin by E1 to its eventual E3-catalyzed attachment to substrates (5Pickart C.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 503-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (2909) Google Scholar). In the CHIP-mediated ubiquitination reaction, we considered UbcH5 autoubiquitination as the by-product of molecular collision, similar to Cdc34 in a SCF-mediated ubiquitination reaction (6Passmore L.A. Barford D. Biochem. J. 2004; 379: 513-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Because the catalytic activity of UbcH5-Ub strictly requires functional binding with the U-box domain, the formation of ubiquitin isopeptide conjugates of UbcH5 provides an independent assessment of E3 ligase activity. This is especially useful to evaluate the ligase activity of E3 mutants with altered or no substrate binding, because no direct measurement of the thioester bond reactivity in E2-Ub is currently available. Therefore, the nonprocessive UbcH5 autoubiquitination is a substrate-independent index of E3 ligase activity. Based on the requisite role of U- box binding in triggering the catalytic activity of UbcH5, we asked whether the U-box alone is sufficient to trigger ubiquitin transfer from E2. In contrast to full-length CHIP, the presence of the U-box domain alone did not lead to any conversion from UbcH5a-Ub thioesters to the UbcH5a-Ub species (Fig. 2A). Because E2 autoubiquitination is substrate-independent, we asked whether the substrate-binding domain TPR is dispensable for E2 activation. However, deletion of the TPR domain completely abolished the ubiquitin transfer from E2 (Fig. 2B). Interestingly, removal of the helical linker region between the TPR and U-box also significantly reduced the ligase activity of CHIP (Fig. 2B). These results indicated that regions of the E3 other than the U-box alone play critical roles in mediating ubiquitin transfer from the bound E2. For many single subunit RING or U-box E3s, there is accumulating evidence indicating that oligomerization is required for function (21Brzovic P.S. Keeffe J.R. Nishikawa H. Miyamoto K. Fox 3rd, D.

CHIP forms a homodimer, and the helical linker that connects the TPR and U-box domains is required for dimer assembly (24Nikolay R. Wiederkehr T. Rist W. Kramer G. Mayer M.P. Bukau B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 2673-2678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). A striking feature of the available atomic structure of full-length CHIP homodimer is a radical asymmetry that arises because the helical linker adopts two different conformations (25Zhang M.

The asymmetric arrangement of TPR domains leaves only one U-box of a dimer accessible to the E2 (Ref. 25Zhang M. Windheim M. Roe S.M. Peggie M. Cohen P. Prodomou C. Pearl L.H. Mol. Cell. 2005; 20: 525-538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar and Fig. 3). Because neither the TPR domain nor the helical linker appears to make direct contact with the bound E2 (25Zhang M. Windheim M. Roe S.M. Peggie M. Cohen P. Prodomou C. Pearl L.H. Mol. Cell. 2005; 20: 525-538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar), we speculated that a concerted and cooperative mechanism underlies the activation of E2 by CHIP homodimer. We propose a dynamic asymmetry model in which a CHIP homodimer is capable of converting between symmetric and asymmetric conformations without violating structural constraints. We animated the putative conformational transition of the CHIP homodimer using the three-dimensional morphing software Blender (see supplemental Movie S1). Importantly, the modeled conformational switch involving the two helical linkers does not disturb their dimerization interface (Fig. 3). Interestingly, the model passes through a symmetric conformation in the middle of the transition that is strikingly similar to the symmetric structure of CHIP lacking the TPR domain (Fig. 3, middle panel, and Ref. 26Xu Z. Devlin K.I. Ford M.G. Nix J.C. Qin J. Misra S. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 4749-4759Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The conformation at the end point of the transition is identical to the starting point but rotated 180°, consistent with the observation that only one conformation for the full-length CHIP was found in the x-ray crystal structure (25Zhang M. Windheim M. Roe S.M. Peggie M. Cohen P. Prodomou C. Pearl L.H. Mol. Cell. 2005; 20: 525-538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). An immediate consequence of this dynamic asymmetry is that the E2 binding site of each U-box cycles between “on” and “off” due to the recurring unmasking/masking by the TPR domain. This molecular switch would provide an alternating access mechanism for TPR-attached substrates to approach the U-box-bound E2, followed by refilling with subsequent E2 molecules. The dynamic asymmetry model of the CHIP homodimer predicts that the TPR domain plays dual roles in ubiquitination: recruiting substrates and regulating E2 binding and activation. As the substrate-binding-defective CHIP mutant K30A retains its ability to activate E2 (Fig. 1A), the two putative roles of the TPR domain appear to be uncoupled. We therefore asked whether the TPR domain could be replaced by other domains without affecting E2 activation. To this end, we replaced the TPR domain with FKBP. Remarkably, this chimeric protein FKBP(LU) retained the same capacity as wild-type CHIP to activate E2 (Fig. 4A). In addition, we observed similar results with a different domain swap using FRB. FKBP and FRB domains dimerize with high affinity in the presence of rapamycin (27Clackson T. Yang W. Rozamus L.W. Hatada M. Amara J.F. Rollins C.T. Stevenson L.F. Magari S.R. Wood S.A. Courage N.L. Lu X. Cerasoli Jr, F. Gilman M. Holt D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1998; 95: 10437-10442Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). This property allowed us to test whether the ligase activity of the chimeric E3 can be redirected toward new substrates. We constructed FRB-fused GFP, which can be recruited to FKBP(LU) by rapamycin (supplemental Fig. S3). Remarkably, addition of rapamycin induced efficient ubiquitin conjugation on FRB(GFP) (Fig. 3A). Reciprocal experiments that swapped FKBP and FRB domains showed similar patterns of ubiquitin conjugation. Notably, the chimeric proteins faithfully recapitulate the E3 properties of the full-length CHIP. For example, the autoubiquitination of FKBP(LU) and FRB(LU) was independent of the ubiquitination of GFP substrates (Fig. 4A). The successful redesign of a ubiquitin ligase allowed us to further substantiate the finding that structural flexibility is required for CHIP-mediated ubiquitination. Consistent with the results using the deletion mutant of CHIP lacking the helical domain, which eradicates CHIP structural flexibility, the corresponding deletion mutation completely abolished the ligase activity of recombinant E3 (FKBP-U and FRB-U) (Fig. 4B and supplemental Fig. S4). For these experiments, we used the FKBP-FRB dimerization approach, positioning the GFP proteins bearing FRB domain (FRB-GFP) in the vicinity of recombinant ligase FKBP-U by adding rapamycin. No ubiquitin conjugation on FRB-GFP was detected (Fig. 4B and supplemental Fig. S4). Using a similar approach, we further tested the functionality of an artificial U-box dimer FKBP(U)/FRB(U) and again found no evidence of E2 activation. To mimic the asymmetry of the CHIP dimer that exhibits half-of-sites E2-binding activity but without structural flexibility, we prepared a U-box heterodimer by dimerizing a wild-type U-box and H260Q mutant within the FKBP/FRB system. Once again, neither FKBP(U)/FRB(HQ) nor FKBP(HQ)/FRB(U) triggered ubiquitin transfer (Fig. 3B and supplemental Fig. S4). Taken together, these results indicate that the full functionality of the U-box in the context of full-length of CHIP cannot be replicated in the form of U-box monomer, U-box dimer, or half-of-sites heterodimer. Instead, it relies on the presence of both the helical linker and the TPR domain, and the function of the TPR domain can be substituted by similarly positioned but unrelated structures. Several lines of evidence suggest that transient E2/E3 interactions are required for repeated ubiquitin conjugation to attached substrates. For example, the mutually exclusive binding of E1s and E3s to E2s necessitates a recycling of E2s for addition of successive ubiquitins to substrates (28Eletr Z.M. Huang D.T. Duda D.M. Schulman B.A. Kuhlman B. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 933-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Dynamic E2/E3 interactions also provide a mechanism for E3 enzymes to accomplish a challenging task: targeting a substrate of continuously increasing size (due to the growing ubiquitin chain) and of different character, particularly at the initial stages. The dynamic model of CHIP we propose here coordinates substrate approach, E2 activation, and subsequent reloading. The intrinsic structural flexibility of CHIP enables E2 molecules to target acceptor lysines on multiple substrates with varied distances. To rigorously test the structural flexibility of CHIP in ubiquitin transfer, we constructed a fusion protein comprised of tandem GFPs with FRB at the NH2 terminus to permit its recruitment to the recombinant ligase FKBP-LU (Fig. 5A). To differentiate the ubiquitination of GFP1 from that of GFP2, we inserted a tobacco etch virus (TEV) cleavage site between GFP1 and GFP2. After FKBP(LU)-mediated ubiquitination in the presence of rapamycin, the reaction products were treated with the AcTEV enzyme. The separated GFP proteins were resolved on SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting using antibodies recognizing distinct epitope tags located at GFP1 or GFP2 respectively. Remarkably, both GFP proteins were ubiquitinated by the recombinant ubiquitin ligase (Fig. 5B). GFP forms a cylindrical structure that has a diameter of 30 Å and a length of 40 Å. Thus, even a distance of about 100 Å (for tandem GFPs plus FRB) does not prevent the substrate from accepting ubiquitin. Our results demonstrate a striking flexibility within the CHIP dimer that facilitates ubiquitin transfer and provides a mechanism to accommodate substrates of diverse size and structure for ubiquitination. Although multiple E2 and E3 enzyme structures have been determined, including several E2-E3 complexes, it is becoming increasingly apparent that static structural snapshots are not sufficient to explain E3 catalysis (4Hochstrasser M. Cell. 2006; 124: 27-34Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). The prevailing view of the function of RING finger (or U-box) E3s is that they provide a scaffold that brings ubiquitin-charged E2 and substrate into close proximity. However the hypothesis of “catalysis by proximity” is not readily aligned with ubiquitination of substrates of varied sizes. In addition, it remains unanswered how ubiquitin shuttles from E2 to substrates. Our results reveal structural flexibility of the E3 CHIP is required for the activation of a bound E2 and the subsequent ubiquitin transfer. There is growing evidence that structural flexibility is an intrinsic property of E3s. Conformational flexibility has been described in a HECT E3 WWP1/AIP5 (29Verdecia M.A. Joazeiro C.A. Wells N.J. Ferrer J.L. Bowman M.E. Hunter T. Noel J.P. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 249-259Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar) and, via cryo-electron microscopy, in the multi-subunit RING E3 APC/C (30Dube P. Herzog F. Gieffers C. Sander B. Riedel D. Müller S.A. Engel A. Peters J.M. Stark H. Mol. Cell. 2005; 20: 867-879Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), although a causal link of flexibility to E3 activity has until now been elusive. Analogous to the ribosome, where structural flexibility is required for elongation factor delivery and GTPase activation in the synthesis of polypeptide (31Diaconu M. Kothe U. Schlünzen F. Fischer N. Harms J.M. Tonevitsky A.G. Stark H. Rodnina M.V. Wahl M.C. Cell. 2005; 121: 991-1004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar), it may be that E3 cycling through different conformational states is a common feature when ubiquitin is assembled on a substrate molecule in a progressive manner. In addition to conformational flexibility, ligase asymmetry is also a common theme. In the BRCA1/BARD1 heterodimer, only the RING domain in BRCA1 is responsible for recruiting E2 (21Brzovic P.S. Keeffe J.R. Nishikawa H. Miyamoto K. Fox 3rd, D. Fukuda M. Ohta T. Klevit R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 5646-5651Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). MDM2, the E3 designated for p53 ubiquitination, has a close partner, MDMX, whose RING domain is not functional in E2 binding (22Marine J.C. Jochemsen A.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 331: 750-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, the central acidic domain of MDM2 plays a critical role in p53 ubiquitination (32Kawai H. Wiederschain D. Yuan Z.M. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 23: 4939-4947Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 33Meulmeester E. Frenk R. Stad R. de Graaf P. Marine J.C. Vousden K.H. Jochemsen A.G. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 23: 4929-4938Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The observation that the RING domains of MDM2 and MDMX are swappable only in the presence of the acidic domain not only suggests asymmetric features similar to those described here for CHIP but also indicates the importance of structural flexibility. The successful engineering of ubiquitin ligases implies a novel approach to achieving specific protein knock-out. Researchers have explored the possibility of modifying the ubiquitin pathway to accelerate degradation of specific cellular proteins (34Zhou P. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2005; 9: 51-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). However, the approaches based on the substrate-binding protein F-box require endogenous Skp1-Cullin1-F-box-protein core machinery to achieve ubiquitination. High levels of the F-box chimera may squelch the core Skp1-Cullin1-F-box-protein and thus cripple the degradation of both the intended and native substrates. Here, we demonstrate activity for an engineered single-chain ubiquitin ligase, which is cell friendly because it does not rely on other subunits for its functionality. Moreover, we showed the novel E3 ligase can be readily engineered into a small molecule-inducible version. This strategy suggests a powerful and versatile tool to control protein ubiquitination and degradation. Download .zip (.24 MB) Help with zip files"
https://openalex.org/W2017163862,"Receptor guanylyl cyclases are multidomain proteins, and ligand binding to the extracellular domain increases the levels of intracellular cGMP. The intracellular domain of these receptors is composed of a kinase homology domain (KHD), a linker of approximately 70 amino acids, followed by the C-terminal guanylyl cyclase domain. Mechanisms by which these receptors are allosterically regulated by ligand binding to the extracellular domain and ATP binding to the KHD are not completely understood. Here we examine the role of the linker region in receptor guanylyl cyclases by a series of point mutations in receptor guanylyl cyclase C. The linker region is predicted to adopt a coiled coil structure and aid in dimerization, but we find that the effects of mutations neither follow a pattern predicted for a coiled coil peptide nor abrogate dimerization. Importantly, this region is critical for repressing the guanylyl cyclase activity of the receptor in the absence of ligand and permitting ligand-mediated activation of the cyclase domain. Mutant receptors with high basal guanylyl cyclase activity show no further activation in the presence of non-ionic detergents, suggesting that hydrophobic interactions in the basal and inactive conformation of the guanylyl cyclase domain are disrupted by mutation. Equivalent mutations in the linker region of guanylyl cyclase A also elevated the basal activity and abolished ligand- and detergent-mediated activation. We, therefore, have defined a key regulatory role for the linker region of receptor guanylyl cyclases which serves as a transducer of information from the extracellular domain via the KHD to the catalytic domain."

Pre-mRNA splicing is critical in the regulation of gene expression and is carried out by a large ribonucleoprotein complex called the spliceosome, which includes the five major snRNPs, 2The abbreviations used are: snRNPsmall nuclear ribonucleoproteinNi-NTAnickel-nitrilotriacetic acidGSTglutathione S-transferaseRTreverse transcriptionSSsplice siteWTwild typeEMSAelectrophoretic mobility shift assay.

In addition, there is a group of essential non-snRNP splicing factors, known as the SR (serine/arginine) family of splicing factors, that play multiple roles in splicing and have the unusual property of functioning as essential factors in constitutive splicing and as regulators of alternative splicing (9Graveley B.R. RNA. 2000; 6: 1197-1211Crossref PubMed Scopus (880) Google Scholar, 10Tacke R. Manley J.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 358-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). The SR proteins are highly conserved throughout metazoa and contain one or two N-terminal RNP-type RNA recognition motifs as well as a C-terminal signature motif region that consists largely of multiple Arg/Ser dipeptide repeats (RS domain) involved in protein-protein interactions (10Tacke R. Manley J.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 358-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). SC35 is a prototype of an expanding list of SR proteins and has been shown to be an essential splicing factor involved in spliceosome assembly in constitutive splicing and as a regulator of alternative splicing (9Graveley B.R.

Purified normal goat IgG was cross-linked to protein A/G-Sepharose beads and used as a negative control. A co-immunoprecipitation assay was also carried out by co-transfecting HeLa cells with expression plasmids for FLAG-tagged TBX5 and 6xHis-SC35 as described previously (6Fan C. Liu M. Wang Q. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 8780-8785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 22Tian X.L. Kadaba R. You S.A. Liu M. Timur A.A. Yang L. Chen Q. Szafranski P. Rao S. Wu L. Housman D.E.

HeLa cells did not show detectable expression of TBX5 but had a moderate level of SC35 expression (supplemental Fig. 1). For in vitro protein-protein interaction assays, purified bacterially expressed GST-TBX5 and baculovirally expressed 6xHis-SC35 were incubated in the presence or absence of 0.1 mg/ml RNase A for 1–2 h on ice, and then Sepharose 4B beads were added to the mixture. After extensive washing with phosphate-buffered saline, bound proteins were eluted with sample buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE, and transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was probed with an anti-His antibody to detect SC35. Protein signal was visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Biosciences). The membrane was also probed with an anti-GST antibody to ensure that similar amounts of GST-TBX5 or control GST were used in different treatments. The TBX5-RNA binding assay was performed as described previously (23Inoue A. Takahashi K.P. Kimura M. Watanabe T. Morisawa S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 2990-2997Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In brief, 35S-labeled TBX5 protein was prepared by in vitro transcription/translation using the T7 TnT-coupled transcription/translation system (Promega), and incubated with RNA homopolymers in a total of 0.5 ml of binding buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 2.5 mm MgCl2, and 0.5% Triton X-100) for 15 min at 4 °C. RNA homopolymers (Sigma) were previously bound to Sepharose 4B (poly(A), P2769), agarose (poly(G), P1908; poly(C),P9827), or to polyacrylhydrazido-agarose (poly(U), P8563). The binding mixture was centrifuged at 4 °C, and the pellets were washed five times with cold binding buffer before resuspending in 20 μl of SDS-PAGE loading buffer. The sample was boiled at 96 °C for 6 min and loaded onto a 7.0% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The gel was dried and exposed to x-ray film at −80 °C overnight. RNA binding assays were also performed using the RNA electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA), which is a simple and rapid method for detecting the existence of specific RNA-protein interaction. For the EMSA, an α-32P-labeled single strand ANF RNA probe was incubated with 1 μg of purified TBX5 and/or SC35 in a total of 20 μl of binding buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 150 mm NaCl, and 1.25 μg of poly(dI-dC)) for 30 min on ice. The mixture was loaded onto a 6% native polyacrylamide gel to separate the RNA-protein complex from the free probe. The gel was transferred to filter paper, dried, and exposed to x-ray film. The empty expression vector pcDNA3, pcDNA- TBX5, or pcDNA-SC35 (varying from 100 to 500 ng as specified in each experiment) was co-transfected with 1 μg of the splicing reporter genes mini-ANF or pCS3-MT-E1A minigene in HeLa cells using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Splicing products were analyzed by RT-PCR with a 32P-labeled primer. In brief, total RNA was isolated from transfected cells with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen), treated with DNase (Sigma), and ensured of no DNA contamination by PCR analysis using the primers listed below, and 1 μg of total RNA was reverse-transcribed to single-stranded cDNA using Superscript II RNase H-reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) and random primers in a volume of 20 μl. RT-PCR was then carried out to assay the efficiency of splicing. The primers for RT-PCR were as follows: ANF forward, 5′-AGCTCCTTCTCCACCACC-3′, and ANF reverse, 5′- AAGCTGTTACAGCCCAGT-3′;E1A forward, T7 5′-TAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAGA-3′, and E1A reverse R67, 5′-GAGCTTGGGACCTCA-3′. The forward PCR primer was labeled using [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase and used in radioactive PCR in a volume of 50 μl containing the 1:50 volume of reverse transcription reaction, 2 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.4, 5 mm KCl, 0.15 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm dNTPs, 0.4 mm of each cold primer, and 0.5 units of Taq polymerase (ABI). PCR products were separated using 5% native polyacrylamide gels. The gels were run at 200 V for 40 min, dried, and exposed to x-ray films. Relative intensity of each splicing band was quantified. RT-PCR for human ICAM-1 was used to ensure the cDNA quality and loading accuracy (forward primer, 5′-CGTGCCGCACTGAACTGGAC-3′; reverse primer, 5′-CCTCACACTTCACTGTCACCT-3′). Splicing products were also analyzed using regular RT-PCR and 2% agarose gels (data not shown). We used a proteomic approach to identify candidate proteins that can form a protein complex with TBX5 as shown in Fig. 1A. His-tagged TBX5 protein (6xHis-TBX5) was purified and used in the Ni2+-NTA affinity bead pulldown experiment (Fig. 1A) to capture novel proteins associated with TBX5. A 35-kDa protein in the P19CL6 nuclear extracts was identified by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1B) as a candidate that formed a complex with TBX5. The protein band was excised from the gel, and its identity was defined by mass spectrometry. The protein sequence analysis revealed that the 35-kDa band contains the SC35 protein, a well studied splicing factor that is a member of the SR protein family of splicing factors (13Fu X.D. Maniatis T. Science. 1992; 256: 535-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). The complex formation between TBX5 and SC35 was confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation assays using mouse cardiac cells. Mouse cardiomyocytes were isolated using the Langendorff perfusion method (21Tian X.L. Yong S.L. Wan X. Wu L. Chung M.K. Tchou P.J. Rosenbaum D.S. Van Wagoner D.R. Kirsch G.E. Wang Q. Cardiovasc. Res. 2004; 61: 256-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), and total protein extracts were prepared. Both TBX5 and SC35 proteins were abundantly expressed in cardiac cells and detected by Western blot analysis (Fig. 1C, lanes 3 and 6). Proteins in isolated mouse cardiomyocyte extracts were precipitated with a polyclonal antibody against TBX5 (Fig. 1C, lane 2). Normal goat IgG was used as a negative control (Fig. 1C, lane 1). The bound proteins were then detected by immunoblot analysis. The TBX5 antibody precipitated a 35-kDa protein that was recognized by an antibody against SC35 (Fig. 1C, lane 2). Similar experiments revealed that the anti-SC35 antibody could precipitate TBX5 from mouse cardiac cell extracts (Fig. 1C, lane 5). These results indicate that TBX5 forms a complex with SC35 in cardiomyocytes. The association between TBX5 and SC35 was also studied in HeLa cells. TBX5 is not expressed in HeLa and HEK-293 cells, but SC35 is expressed in all cell types, including P19CL6, HeLa, HEK-293, THP1, and COS-7 cells (see supplemental Fig. 1 and some data not shown). Human TBX5 tagged with a FLAG epitope and human SC35 tagged with His6 were co-expressed in HeLa cells, and their association was examined using co-immunoprecipitation. As show in Fig. 1D, the anti-FLAG M2 antibody (for FLAG-TBX5) precipitated His-SC35 that was recognized by the anti-His antibody (lane 8). The anti-His antibody (for SC35) precipitated FLAG-TBX5 that was recognized by the anti-FLAG antibody (Fig. 1D, lane 11). These results indicate that TBX5 forms a complex with SC35 in HeLa cells. Interestingly, strong association between TBX5 and SC35 required the presence of RNA. Purified GST-TBX5 fusion protein (Fig. 2A) was incubated with 6xHis-SC35 purified from a baculoviral expression system (Fig. 2A) and immobilized onto glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads. Bound proteins were eluted and separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and analyzed by Western blot using a monoclonal anti-His antibody to detect SC35. Consistent with the data from co-immunoprecipitation assays, a strong complex formation was detected between GST-TBX5 and His-SC35 (Fig. 2B). GST-TBX5, but not GST alone, easily pulled down His-SC35. Pretreatment of prepared TBX5 and SC35 with RNase A reduced the association of TBX5 with SC35 (Fig. 2B). These results suggest that RNA is involved in the formation of the TBX5-SC35 complex. Because TBX5 forms a complex with a splicing factor SC35, we hypothesized that TBX5 could mediate pre-mRNA splicing. To test this hypothesis, we performed mRNA splicing assays in HeLa cells using a mini-ANF splicing gene we constructed (Fig. 3). ANF (atrial natriuretic factor) is a cardiac gene that has been shown to be transcriptionally regulated by TBX5 (6Fan C. Liu M. Wang Q. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 8780-8785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 25Bruneau B.G. Nemer G. Schmitt J.P. Charron F. Robitaille L. Caron S. Conner D.A. Gessler M. Nemer M.

Genet. 2001; 28: 276-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). The mini-ANF gene consists of the CMV promoter, T7 promoter, a portion of exon 1 that starts with the start codon ATG (but mutated to TTG to prevent translation), complete intron I, and complete exon II connected directly to complete exon III (Fig. 3). The mini-ANF gene (1 μg) was co-transfected with an expression plasmid for TBX5 (100 ng), SC35 (100 ng), or a combination of TBX5 and SC35 (100 ng each), and the splicing products of mini-ANF were analyzed by RT-PCR with one of the primers labeled by 32P. As shown in Fig. 4A, transient transfection of the mini-ANF gene in HeLa cells resulted in a basal level of splicing (Fig. 4A, lane 2). Co-transfection of the mini-ANF gene and a TBX5 expression construct increased the splicing activity (Fig. 4A, lane 3), suggesting that TBX5 increase the efficiency of splicing of its target gene ANF. Transfection of a mutant TBX5 protein with the deletion of the C terminus (TBX5 ΔC with amino acid residues 1–278 retained) had a similar splicing activity as wild type TBX5 in HeLa cells (Fig. 4, lane 6), suggesting that the TBX5 domain responsible for splicing is located at the N terminus. Co-transfection of SC35 with the mini-ANF gene also resulted in an increase in splicing of ANF (Fig. 4A, lane 4), which is consistent with previously reported results that SC35 facilitates splicing (13Fu X.D. Maniatis T. Science. 1992; 256: 535-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 27Gallego M.E. Gattoni R. Stévenin J. Marie J. Expert-Bezançon A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1772-1784Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, co-expression of both TBX5 and SC35 resulted in inhibition of splicing to the basal splicing level (Fig. 4A, lane 5). The inhibitory effect of TBX5 on SC35-mediated splicing was investigated with varying concentrations of TBX5, and the inhibition appeared to be concentration-dependent (Fig. 4B). Similarly, SC35 antagonized the positive effect of TBX5 in splicing, and the effect was also concentration-dependent (Fig. 4B). These results suggest that co-expression of TBX5 and SC35 antagonizes each other in pre-mRNA splicing in HeLa cells. The inhibitory effect on pre-mRNA splicing disappeared with co-expression of SC35 and mutant TBX5 ΔC (Fig. 4A, lane 7). The result suggests that the C terminus of TBX5 is involved in antagonizing the splicing activity of SC35. The functional significance of the TBX5-SC35 complex formation was also studied in the alternative splicing process using an E1A minigene (19Yang L. Embree L.J. Tsai S. Hickstein D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27761-27764Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). The adenovirus E1A pre-mRNA minigene is a well established in vivo splicing system to monitor concentration-dependent changes of the splicing patterns by SR proteins (utilization of different splicing sites results in five isoforms as follows: 13S, 12S, 11S, 10S, and 9S; Fig. 5A) (19Yang L. Embree L.J. Tsai S. Hickstein D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27761-27764Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 28Cáceres J.F. Misteli T. Screaton G.R. Spector D.L. Krainer A.R. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 225-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). The E1A minigene was co-transfected with varying concentrations of an expression construct for TBX5. The in vivo alternative splicing assay detected five RT-PCR bands at high concentrations of TBX5 (Fig. 5B). The five RT-PCR bands were isolated from the gel and sequenced using the forward T7 primer. The direct DNA sequence analysis indicates that the five bands from 9S to 13S represent the five alternatively spliced isoforms of the mini-E1A pre-mRNA as shown in Fig. 5A (data not shown). As the concentration of TBX5 increased, the amount of the 12S splicing product decreased, although amount of the 9S splicing form increased (Fig. 5, B and C). These results suggest that TBX5 can regulate the selection of alternative splice sites during splicing. Overexpression of SC35 in HeLa cells also led to the formation of the five alternative splicing forms (Fig. 5D, lane 4). Surprisingly, co-expression of TBX5 and SC35 resulted in a dramatic decrease in the amount of the 9S form of mRNA, whereas an increase in the amount of the 11S forms was detected (Fig. 5D). These results suggest that the complex formation between TBX5 and SC35 alters the selection of splice sites of the adenovirus E1A pre-mRNA during splicing. The effect of six pathogenic missense mutations of TBX5 on splicing was examined. The mini-ANF gene was co-transfected with wild type or mutant TBX5 expression constructs in HeLa cells, and in vivo splicing was monitored by RT-PCR of the spliced products. Compared with the vector, wild type TBX5 markedly increased the splicing of the mini-ANF gene (Fig. 6A). Mutations Q49K, I54T, G169R, R237Q, R237W, and S252I acted similarly to wild type TBX5 and promoted splicing to the same level as the wild type protein (Fig. 6A). However, TBX5 with mutation G80R lost its splicing activity (Fig. 6A). The splicing activity of TBX5 appears to be concentration-dependent as increased TBX5 resulted in significant increases of the spliced mRNA of the mini-ANF gene (Fig. 6B, WT and R237Q). Increased concentrations of mutant TBX5 with mutation G80R led to gradual decreases of the spliced products (Fig. 6B, G80R), suggesting that suppression of TBX5-mediated splicing activity by mutation G80R was concentration-dependent. The results suggest that TBX5 mutation G80R led to reduced splicing efficiency of TBX5. Because TBX5 plays a role in pre-mRNA slicing, we tested the hypothesis that TBX5 may be an RNA-binding protein using standard binding assays with RNA homopolymers. We demonstrated that 35S-labeled TBX5 was able to bind to various RNA homopolymers (Fig. 7, A and B). The binding of TBX5 to poly(U) and poly(C) RNA was stronger than that to poly(A) and poly(G) RNA (Fig. 7B). Binding of TBX5 to poly(U) RNA was competed more strongly by poly(U) a"
https://openalex.org/W2076631139,"Nucleostemin (NS) is a nucleolar protein involved in the regulation of cell proliferation. Both overexpression and knockdown of NS increase the activity of the tumor suppressor protein p53, resulting in cell cycle arrest. In addition, NS regulates processing of pre-rRNA and consequently the level of total protein synthesis. Here, we describe a previously uncharacterized function of NS in the maintenance of the tripartite nucleolar structure as well as the integrity of small nucleolar ribonucleoproteins (snoRNPs). NS is also necessary to maintain the telomerase complex which shares common protein subunits with the H/ACA box snoRNPs. First, immunofluorescence microscopy and electron microscopy demonstrated that knockdown of NS disorganized the nucleolar architecture, in particular, the dense fibrillar component where snoRNPs are localized. Second, gel filtration chromatography and immunoprecipitation indicated that NS depletion leads to dissociation of the components of snoRNPs and the telomerase complex. Third, NS depletion reduced both telomerase activity and the cellular level of pseudouridine, an H/ACA snoRNP-mediated modification of rRNA and other RNAs that are important for their folding and stability. These morphological, biochemical and functional studies demonstrate that NS plays an important role to maintain nucleolar structure and function on a more fundamental level than previously thought."

Nucleoside analogues are antimetabolites that play a pivotal role in the treatment of a spectrum of hematological malignancies. Our laboratory has extensively characterized the novel purine nucleoside analogues 8-chloroadenosine and congener 8-aminoadenosine (8-NH2-Ado) (3Halgren R.G. Traynor A.E. Pillay S. Zell J.L.

Cancer Ther. 2004; 3: 1411-1420PubMed Google Scholar), which are highly effective in tissue culture models of multiple myeloma as well as a spectrum of other hematological and solid cancers. 8-Chloroadenosine is currently in phase I clinical trial. The general mechanism of action of these antimetabolites involves RNA and/or DNA termination, ATP depletion, and subsequent induction of apoptosis (6Ghias K. Ma C. Gandhi V. Platanias L.C. Krett N.L. Rosen S.T. Mol. Cancer Ther. 2005; 4: 569-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), but a comprehensive analysis of their cellular effects has not been reported. In this study, we describe a novel feature in the mechanism of action of purine nucleoside analogue 8-NH2-Ado. We find that 8-NH2-Ado inhibits glucose consumption that is associated with an activation of autophagy. This ability to reduce glucose consumption is particularly important, given the dependence of many tumor cells on aerobic glycolysis and the ensuing increase in glucose consumption to meet energetic and biosynthetic demands. Normal cells typically rely on oxygen to metabolize glucose via the glycolytic and oxidative phosphorylation pathways to generate ATP. In contrast, many tumor cells demonstrate enhanced glycolysis and lactate production, utilizing the less efficient mode of ATP production even in the presence of oxygen (7Gatenby R.A. Gillies R.J. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2004; 4: 891-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (3544) Google Scholar). This phenomenon, termed aerobic glycolysis, was first described by Otto Warburg in the 1930s and was originally thought to be a result of defects in oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) (8Warburg O. Science. 1956; 123: 309-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (9143) Google Scholar). Recent studies have shown that tumor cells do contain functional mitochondria (9Fantin V.R. St-Pierre J. Leder P. Cancer Cell. 2006; 9: 425-434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1180) Google Scholar) yet still produce excessive lactate, suggesting that the enhanced glycolytic flux may confer a growth advantage. In support of this notion, tumor cells forced to revert to oxidative phosphorylation display reduced tumorigenicity (9Fantin V.R. St-Pierre J. Leder P. Cancer Cell. 2006; 9: 425-434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1180) Google Scholar). Clinicians have capitalized on the ubiquity of these metabolic alterations in cancer (7Gatenby R.A. Gillies R.J. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2004; 4: 891-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (3544) Google Scholar), including myeloma (10Durie B.G. Waxman A.D. D'Agnolo A. Williams C.M. J. Nucl. Med. 2002; 43: 1457-1463PubMed Google Scholar, 11Bredella M.A. Steinbach L. Caputo G. Segall G. Hawkins R. AJR Am. J. Roentgenol. 2005; 184: 1199-1204Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar), for diagnostic and prognostic purposes through the use of [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography. The significance of the glycolytic phenotype in neoplastic pathogenesis has been explored in a variety of studies. Large scale gene expression analyses reveal the selective up-regulation of genes encoding constituents of the glycolytic pathway across numerous forms of cancer, including myeloma (12Altenberg B. Greulich K.O. Genomics. 2004; 84: 1014-1020Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar). An intimate association between transcriptional control of metabolic genes and the activity of classical oncogenes and tumor suppressors, including Myc, p53, and Hif1α, is well documented (13Osthus R.C. Shim H. Kim S. Li Q. Reddy R. Mukherjee M. Xu Y. Wonsey D. Lee L.A. Dang C.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21797-21800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar). Recently, requisite events preceding the switch from OXPHOS to aerobic glycolysis in immortalized cells have been shown to involve expression of the embryonic form of pyruvate kinase, correlating with the ability to form tumors in xenograft studies (14Christofk H.R. Vander Heiden M.G. Harris M.H. Ramanathan A. Gerszten R.E. Wei R. Fleming M.D. Schreiber S.L. Cantley L.C. Nature. 2008; 452: 230-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (2036) Google Scholar). These studies have stimulated a renewed interest in strategies that target metabolism and cellular bioenergetics unique to cancer cells. Here we report that 8-NH2-Ado acutely regulates glucose uptake prior to loss of mitochondrial membrane potential. Glucose deprivation-induced bioenergetic stress is buffered by the cellular activation of autophagy, providing the rationale for combining 8-NH2-Ado with inhibitors of autophagy. In cells more resistant to 8-NH2-Ado, artificial reduction of glucose consumption robustly sensitizes these cells to 8-NH2-Ado without the activation of autophagy. This finding suggests that tumor cells with deficient autophagic responses may be uniquely susceptible to interference with glucose utilization pathways. The MM.1S cell line was developed in our laboratory. U266, ARH 77, and RPMI 8226 cell lines were from ATCC.

After vortexing tubes were kept on ice for 15 min. Acidic supernatant was isolated by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 30 s and neutralized with 100 μl of 0.5 n KOH. Samples were stored at −80 °C and eluted isocratically from a TSK gel DEAE-2 SW (240 × 4.6 mm, 5-μm particle size, (TOSOH Corp. Tokyo, Japan) with a 0.06 m Na2HPO4 (pH 6.9) acetonitrile buffer (60:40) at a flow of 1.0 ml/min. The eluant was monitored at 261 nm, and concentrations of ATP and 8-NH2-ATP were determined from an external standard curve, which was linear from 0.01 to 10 mm for both compounds. Intracellular concentrations were calculated by determination of cell volume. The volume of cells was determined by measuring mean cell diameter using a Beckman Coulter Vi-CellTM XR cell viability analyzer. 0.5 × 106 cells were treated with 3 μm 8-NH2-Ado for the indicated times. 30 min prior to the harvest time, potentiometric dye tetramethylrhodamine ethyl ester perchlorate was added to all wells at a final concentration of 100 nm. Cells were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min, followed by PBS wash, and resuspended in PBS containing 2% fetal bovine serum and 20 nm tetramethylrhodamine ethyl ester perchlorate, and samples were analyzed by flow cytometry. The respiration rate was measured with an Oxygraph (Hansatech Instruments) in 2 × 106 (MM.1S) or 5 × 106 (U266) cells/ml of PBS. After obtaining a stable rate, sodium cyanide was added at a concentration of 5 μm, and the resulting respiration rate was recorded. Oxygen consumption rates were expressed in nmol of oxygen consumed/106 cells. Cellular glucose consumption correlating to [3H]2-deoxyglucose uptake was determined by modification of the protocol described previously (16Kawakami K. Onaka T. Iwase M. Homma I. Ikeda K. Obes. Res. 2005; 13: 1661-1671Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Briefly 5 × 106 MM.1S cells were left untreated or treated with 3 μm 8-NH2-Ado for 5 h. Cells were then harvested and resuspended in glucose-free medium with or without drug. And the end of 5 h, cells were harvested and resuspended in 1 ml of glucose-free RPMI 1640 containing 0.2 μCi/ml 2-deoxy-d-[1-3H]glucose (specific activity 8 Ci/mmol; GE Healthcare) and 0.5 μm 2-deoxyglucose, with or without cytochalasin B (5 μm final concentration), for 25 min. The uptake was stopped by pelleting cells and resuspending them in ice-cold PBS supplemented with 5 mm 2-deoxyglucose. Cell pellets were lysed in 3% SDS, and 3H counts/min in the total lysate were measured using a liquid scintillation counter. The rate of cellular glucose consumption was also determined using the Amplex Red® glucose/glucose oxidase kit (Invitrogen) following manufacturer's instructions. Glucose concentrations in medium samples taken at the start and end of the experiments were used to determine cellular uptake. Cellular lysates were prepared with the Complete Lysis-M buffer (Roche Applied Science) supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitor mixture tablets (Roche Applied Science) prepared according to the manufacturer's instructions. Protein concentrations were determined by a Bio-Rad protein assay. Proteins were separated on precast Tris-glycine gels (Invitrogen) transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Immobilon-P; Millipore, Bedford, MA), following which membranes were blocked in casein. Primary antibody incubations were overnight at 4 °C, followed by 1-h room temperature incubations with horseradish peroxidase-linked anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Cell Signaling Technology, Inc., Danvers, MA) or anti-mouse secondary antibody (Amersham Biosciences). Blots were developed using the Enhanced Chemiluminescence Plus Western blotting detection reagent (Amersham Biosciences). Cells were washed once in PBS, and ∼65,000 cells were spun onto coated microscope slides (Shandon CytoslideTM) using a Shandon CytospinTM 2 cytocentrifuge (Thermo Electron Corp., Pittsburgh, PA). Slides were fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.03% saponin in PBS, and blocked with 10% normal goat serum. All primary and secondary antibody dilutions were made in PBS containing 10% normal goat serum and 0.03% saponin. Cells were stained overnight with 1:100 dilutions of antibodies to human GLUT1, GLUT4, LC3, or Golgin-97 with detection using anti-rabbit IgG-Alexa Fluor 594 or anti-mouse IgG-Alexa 488 (Invitrogen) for 60 min. Cells were mounted with Ultra Cruz mounting medium (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) containing DAPI for counterstaining. Cells were visualized with a 63× (1.4 numerical aperture) oil objective LSM-510 Meta Carl Zeiss confocal microscope. Image analysis was performed using the Zeiss Axiovision LE image browser. Acidic vesicular organelles (AVOs) were detected by incubating cells with acridine orange (17Traganos F. Darzynkiewicz Z. Methods Cell Biol. 1994; 41: 185-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). In stained cells, acidic compartments fluoresced in bright red, quantified using fl3 mode (>650 nm), and base-line green/fluorescein isothiocyanate fluorescence was measured utilizing the fl1 channel (500–550 nm). To assess the percentage of cells forming AVOs, cells were incubated with 0.1 μg/ml acridine orange (Molecular Probes) for 15 min at 37 °C just prior to harvesting at the end of a treatment period. MM.1S cells were transiently cotransfected with 0.5 μg of mCherry RFP vector (obtained from Drs. C. Clevenger, F. Fang, and J. Koblinski, Northwestern University, Chicago, IL) and either 2.5 μg of GLUT1 (GeneCopoeiaTM, Germantown, MD) or empty vector pCDNA 3.0 (Invitrogen). Transfections were carried out using Amaxa Nucleofector kit V (Amaxa Biosystems, Cologne, Germany). Cells were incubated for 24 h before RFP-positive cells were sorted by Dako Moflo cell sorter. All data presented are derived from at least three independent determinations, unless otherwise noted. Two-tailed p values were calculated using paired or unpaired t tests as indicated, with GraphPad Prism software (San Diego, CA). p values of <0.05 were considered to be statistically significant. Sensitivity to 8-NH2-Ado was determined by assessment of cellular proliferation (Fig. 1, A1) in response to a range of concentrations of 8-NH2-Ado in the MM.1S, RPMI 8226, U266 (myeloma) and ARH 77 (B lymphoblastoid) cell lines. The MM.1S cells were most sensitive to the growth-inhibitory effects of 8-NH2-Ado followed by ARH 77, RPMI 8226 and U266 cells. Studying two differentially sensitive cell lines represents an ideal system to investigate unappreciated aspects of the mechanism of action of 8-NH2-Ado, particularly those that directly influence cell death. Therefore, we selected U266 and MM.1S cells for further study and verified the differential toxicity of 8-NH2-Ado by directly measuring cell death with the same dose range of 8-NH2-Ado (Fig. 1, A2). The IC50 in MM.1S and U266 cells is 1.5 and 8.88 μm, respectively. We have previously shown in MM.1S cells that 8-NH2-Ado rapidly decreases intracellular ATP with a concomitant accumulation of 8-NH2-ATP (5Krett N.L. Davies K.M. Ayres M. Ma C. Nabhan C. Gandhi V. Rosen S.T. Mol. Cancer Ther. 2004; 3: 1411-1420PubMed Google Scholar). Studies in adenosine kinase-deficient cells indicate that the toxic effects of 8-NH2-Ado require adenosine kinase activity to convert 8-NH2-Ado to 8-NH2-ATP (5Krett N.L. Davies K.M. Ayres M. Ma C. Nabhan C. Gandhi V. Rosen S.T. Mol. Cancer Ther. 2004; 3: 1411-1420PubMed Google Scholar). To ensure that decreased accumulation of the active compound was not responsible for the relative resistance of the U266 cell line, we first measured ATP and 8-NH2-ATP levels following treatment in both cell lines. We determined intracellular 8-NH2-ATP and ATP levels in a time course assay of MM.1S and U266 cells treated with 3 μm 8-NH2-Ado. Although the intracellular concentration of 8-NH2-ATP reaches similar levels in both cell types, we observed a greater drop in ATP levels in the MM.1S cells (Fig. 1, B1 and B2). The similar accumulation of 8-NH2-ATP in the less sensitive U266 cells rules out the possibility that deficient uptake of pro-drug and subsequent conversion to 8-NH2-ATP accounts for lower toxicity. However, we were interested in determining the cause of the steeper drop in ATP levels in the MM.1S cells. Competition between phosphoderivatives of 8-NH2-Ado and their corresponding endogenous counterparts (e.g. ADP and AMP) for enzymes involved in adenosine phosphorylation probably accounts for the decreased ATP levels in U266 cells. The observation that 8-NH2-ATP accumulation is mirrored in the MM.1S cells while ATP levels decline to a greater extent suggested to us that a bioenergetic pathway may be additionally and selectively impaired in the MM.1S cells. Therefore, we investigated the effects of 8-NH2-Ado on two other ATP-generating pathways: OXPHOS and glycolysis. To ask whether a selective inhibition of oxidative phosphorylation may account for the steeper drop in ATP levels in the MM.1S cells, we evaluated mitochondrial functionality by measuring mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψm) during a time course of 8-NH2-Ado treatment. At 5 h post-drug treatment, a time point at which there is significant loss of intracellular ATP in both cell lines, there was no observed reduction of Δψm (Fig. 1C). At later time points, there was a selective decrease in Δψm in the MM.1S cells, which was probably a secondary effect of cell death caused by mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization and cytochrome c release. The observation that ATP concentrations decrease before Δψm declines suggests that loss of mitochondrial function is not the cause of the bioenergetic deficit. To validate this conclusion, we also measured oxygen consumption in MM.1S and U266 cells treated with 8-NH2-Ado. At 5 h of 8-NH2-Ado treatment, we observed no change in base-line oxygen consumption (Fig. 1, D1 and D3) in both the MM.1S and U266 cells, in accordance with the Δψm studies. Additionally, to confirm that there is no change in mitochondrial respiration in the MM.1S and U266 cells, we measured oxygen consumption following cyanide treatment. Cyanide is a potent inhibitor of mitochondrial respiration, and any oxygen consumption measured post-cyanide treatment is considered non-mitochondrial. Utilizing cyanide, we calculated the ratio of mitochondrial oxygen consumption to total oxygen consumption for untreated and 8-NH2-Ado-treated cells. This ratio was not significantly different between treated and untreated cells (Fig. 1, D2 and D4) in either MM.1S or U266 cells. These results confirm that changes in mitochondrial respiration are not responsible for the greater decline in intracellular ATP seen in the MM.1S cells. An alternative mechanism that could explain this occurrence could be changes in flux through the glycolytic pathway. Glucose metabolism via glycolysis is thought to provide a rapid (albeit inefficient) supply of ATP to proliferating tumor cells. To investigate whether 8-NH2-Ado elicits changes in glucose metabolism, we measured glucose consumption in MM.1S and U266 cells treated with 8-NH2-Ado. To evaluate glucose uptake, we treated MM.1S cells with 3 μm 8-NH2-Ado for 5 h. Glucose consumption was measured by the uptake of [3H]2-deoxyglucose. We observed that 5 h of 8-NH2-Ado treatment caused a 50% reduction in glucose consumption (Fig. 2A) in comparison with untreated MM.1S cells. Cytochalasin B treatment nonspecifically blocks glucose transporter activity and is included to measure the contribution of transporter-independent glucose uptake, which is minimal. We assessed the 8-NH2-Ado-induced regulation of glucose consumption in the panel of cell lines previously characterized for their sensitivity to 8-NH2-Ado. Glucose uptake was analyzed in the four cell lines at 5 and 17 h after 8-NH2-Ado treatment. Glucose consumption was determined by measuring glucose depletion from media by cells cultured in the absence or presence of 8-NH2-Ado. A 40% decline in glucose consumption was observed in MM.1S cells treated with 3 μm 8-NH2-Ado for 5 h (Fig. 2, B1), thus corroborating previous results evaluating [3H]2-deoxyglucose uptake. RPMI 8226 and ARH 77 cells (Fig. 2, B2 and B4), which are more resistant to 8-NH2-Ado, required higher concentrations of 8-NH2-Ado (i.e. 6 μm) to induce decreases in glucose consumption comparable with those seen in the sensitive MM.1S cells. Even at the higher 6 μm dosage of 8-NH2-Ado, the U266 cells exhibited only a slight decrease in glucose consumption, which diminished over time (Fig. 2, B3), consistent with the observed resistance to 8-NH2-Ado. Given the connections between ATP generation and glucose consumption within the context of malignancy, these observations suggest that 8-NH2-Ado-induced glucose limitation could facilitate the greater decline in ATP in the sensitive MM.1S cells. To determine if the reduction in glucose consumption is a generalized phenomenon preceding myeloma cell death or represents a unique property of 8-NH2-Ado, we examined glucose uptake in the presence of clinically relevant therapeutics that act through distinct mechanisms. We examined the effect of the myeloma therapeutic bortezomib (Velcade; PS-341) and the nucleoside analogue gemcitabine on glucose transport rates in comparison with 8-NH2-Ado. At the concentrations used, these compounds elicit higher toxicity than 8-NH2-Ado (18Nabhan C. Krett N. Gandhi V. Rosen S. Curr. Opin. Oncol. 2001; 13: 514-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 19Hideshima T. Richardson P. Chauhan D. Palombella V.J. Elliott P.J. Adams J. Anderson K.C. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 3071-3076PubMed Google Scholar) but do not demonstrate an inhibition of glucose consumption comparable with that seen with 8-NH2-Ado (Fig. 2C), thereby suggesting that regulation of glucose consumption is not a generalized phenomenon associated with cytotoxic therapeutics. To examine the functional role of diminished glucose consumption in the toxicity of 8-NH2Ado, we first investigated potential mechanisms that may be responsible for the decline in glucose consumption in the MM.1S cell line. We examined expression and subcellular localization of GLUT1 and GLUT4, two key glucose transporters present in B cells. Immunoblot analysis of whole cell lysates of MM.1S cells treated with 8-NH2-Ado for 5 and 24 h indicates a time-dependent decrease in GLUT1 expression at 5 h, whereas at 24 h there was a down-regulation of both transporters (Fig. 3, A1 and A2). Given the rapid, robust inhibition of glucose uptake and the relatively modest reduction in GLUT1 protein levels at early time points, we hypothesized that another regulatory mechanism may be involved. We then determined the subcellular localization of GLUT1 and -4 by immunofluorescence microscopy, since the trafficking of these proteins to the cell surface also impacts their functionality. Untreated MM.1S (Fig. 3, B1) and U266 cells (Fig. 3, B2) showed a homogenous cytoplasmic and plasma membrane distribution of GLUT1 and -4. Treatment of MM.1S cells with 8-NH2-Ado caused the selective aggregation of GLUT4 within the trans-Golgi network, as evidenced by co-localization of GLUT4 with anti-Golgin-97, a trans-Golgi network protein (20Kjer-Nielsen L. Teasdale R.D. van Vliet C. Gleeson P.A. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 385-388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3, B1). A corresponding reduction in the plasma membrane and cytoplasmic distribution of GLUT4 in MM.1S cells was also detected. Conversely, we detected minimal translocation of GLUT1 (Fig. 3, B1) in the MM.1S cells. The localizations of GLUT1 and -4 were not regulated by 8-NH2-Ado in the U266 cells at either time (Fig. 4, A1, A2, and B2). Therefore, abrogation of GLUT4 plasma membrane localization is temporally associated with the selective decrease in glucose uptake seen in the MM.1S cell line, suggesting a causal relationship between these events.FIGURE 4Overexpression of GLUT1 in MM.1S cells does not impact 8-NH2-Ado toxicity. MM.1S cells were co-transfected with a plasmid encoding GLUT1 or empty vector along with an RFP control vector. A, GLUT1 overexpression by immunoblot analysis in total transfected population. Representative immunoblot is demonstrated (n = 2). B, rescue of glucose consumption in GLUT1-transfected cells. Glucose uptake 5 h post-8-NH2-Ado treatment was measured in the total transfected cell population as described previously (n = 3, ±S.E.). C, cell death in GLUT1-transfected, 8-NH2-Ado-treated MM.1S cells. RFP-positive cells were sorted, treated with 1 μm 8-NH2-Ado for 24 h, and analyzed for cell death by flow cytometric determination of AnnexinV/DAPI-positive cells (n = 3, ±S.E.).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To directly assess the role of the 8-NH2-Ado-induced decrease in glucose consumption in the MM.1S cells, we overexpressed GLUT1 to reverse this effect during treatment. We chose to exogenously express GLUT1 to restore glucose transport rates due to the sustained plasma membrane localization of this protein during 8-NH2-Ado treatment. If GLUT4 were overexpressed, this protein would presumably aggregate similarly to the endogenous protein and not affect glucose uptake. Furthermore, we utilized a lower concentration of 8-NH2-Ado, which was more suitable for the extended duration of these experiments. Increased GLUT1 expression (Fig. 4A) effectively reversed the 8-NH2-Ado-induced decline in glucose consumption (Fig. 4B). Given the strong connections in the literature between glycolytic inhibition and tumor cell death, we anticipated that restoration of glucose consumption during 8-NH2-Ado treatment would partially abrogate the toxicity of the drug in the MM.1S cells. This result would have indicated that regulation of glucose transporter functionality accounts for the relative sensitivity of the MM.1S cells compared with the U266 cells.

In the nervous system, heart, and for some cancer cells, part of this communication requires signaling by soluble and membrane-bound factors produced by the NRG1 gene. We have previously shown that glial-derived neurotrophic factors activate a rapid, localized release of soluble neuregulin from neuronal axons that can, in turn promote proper axoglial development (Esper, R. M., and Loeb, J. A. (2004) J. Neurosci. 24, 6218–6227). Here we elucidate the mechanism of this localized, regulated release by implicating the delta isoform of protein kinase C (PKC). Blocking the PKC delta isoform with either rottlerin, a selective antagonist, or small interference RNA blocks the regulated release of neuregulin from both transfected cells and primary neuronal cultures. PKC activation also leads to the rapid phosphorylation of the pro-NRG1 cytoplasmic tail on serine residues adjacent to the membrane-spanning segment, that, when mutated markedly reduce the rate of NRG1 activity release. These findings implicate this specific PKC isoform as an important factor for the cleavage and neurotrophin-regulated release of soluble NRG1 forms that have important effects in nervous system development and disease.

While many of the biological functions of type I/II NRG1 forms are less clear, their ability to be released from axons in the peripheral and central nervous systems in a regulated manner provides the potential for long range cell-cell communication not possible from membrane-bound forms. Studies examining the regulation of type I NRG1 release from neuronal axons have implicated protein kinase C (PKC) as a mediator of NRG1 release from pro-NRG1 in transfected cell lines (32Loeb J.A. Susanto E.T. Fischbach G.D. Mol. Cell Neurosci. 1998; 11: 77-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Subsequent studies in intact neurons found that PKC activation was sufficient to release NRG1 from sensory and motor neuron axons and that NRG1 could also be released by Schwann cell-derived neurotrophic factors, such as BDNF and GDNF (1Esper R.M. Loeb J.A. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 6218-6227Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Recently, the β-secretase protease BACE1 has been suggested to cleave these NRG1 forms so that when it is knocked out in mice, deficits similar to those seen in NRG1 knockouts are seen (33Hu X. Hicks C.W. He W. Wong P. Macklin W.B. Trapp B.D. Yan R. Nat. Neurosci. 2006; 9: 1520-1525Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar, 34Willem M. Garratt A.N. Novak B. Citron M. Kaufmann S. Rittger A. DeStrooper B. Saftig P. Birchmeier C. Haass C. Science. 2006; 314: 664-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that reciprocal communication between NRG1s and neurotrophins could be an important mechanisms for local axoglial communication that is critical for normal peripheral nerve development. Consistently, PKC has been implicated as a key mediator for the electrically mediated release of NRG1 from cultured cerebellar granule cells and pontine nucleus neurons (35Ozaki M. Itoh K. Miyakawa Y. Kishida H. Hashikawa T. J. Neurochem. 2004; 91: 176-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The PKC family consists of 10 serine/threonine kinases isoforms (α, βI, βII, γ, δ, ϵ, ζ, θ, λ, and η) each with a unique cellular distribution, target specificity, mechanism of activation, and function (36Goekjian P.G. Jirousek M.R. Curr. Med. Chem. 1999; 6: 877-903PubMed Google Scholar). One of these functions promotes the cleavage and release of soluble signaling proteins that are initially synthesized as membrane-spanning precursors. In addition to NRG1, other proteins released upon PKC activation include epidermal growth factor, transforming growth factor-α, amyloid precursor protein, l-selectin, and interleukins (1Esper R.M. Loeb J.A. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 6218-6227Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 37Black R.A. Rauch C.T. Kozlosky C.J. Peschon J.J. Slack J.L. Wolfson M.F. Castner B.J. Stocking K.L. Reddy P.

We hypothesize that neurotrophic factors induce the cleavage and release of NRG1 from pro-NRG1 through PKC activation. This hypothesis seems reasonable, because neurotrophin binding to the Trk family of neurotrophin receptor tyrosine kinases, but not the low affinity neurotrophin receptor p75 (44Plo I. Bono F. Bezombes C. Alam A. Bruno A. Laurent G. J. Neurosci. Res. 2004; 77: 465-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), activates phospholipase Cγ-mediated conversion of membrane-bound phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate to inositol triphosphate and diacylglycerol, which in turn, can activate PKC (45Patapoutian A. Reichardt L.F. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2001; 11: 272-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (923) Google Scholar, 46Kikkawa U. Matsuzaki H. Yamamoto T. J.

Saito N. J. Biochem. 2002; 132: 663-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Although this can be achieved using phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), a diacylglycerol analog sufficient to activate most PKC isozymes (48Shirai Y. Saito N. J. Biochem. 2002; 132: 663-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), the exact PKC isoform and mechanism by which this occurs is not known. Here, we demonstrate NRG1 is released from cells through direct activation of the PKCδ isoform using siRNA and PKC isoform-specific inhibitors in transfected Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, PC12, and primary neuronal cultures. We further demonstrate that PKC activation induces rapid phosphorylation of the cytoplasmic tail of pro-NRG1 on specific serine residues that are required for efficient NRG1 activity release. These findings provide mechanistic insights into how highly localized, reciprocal signaling occurs along neuronal axons, which has important implications for normal development and disease. Sensory neurons were cultured from E12 chicken dorsal root ganglia as previously described in serum-free media (L15, penicillin/streptomycin, 0.6% glucose, 2 mm glutamine, 0.06% NaHCO3) supplemented with N2, B27, and 10 ng/ml NGF (Invitrogen) (1Esper R.M. Loeb J.A. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 6218-6227Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 49Banker G.G.K. Culturing Nerve Cells. 2nd Ed. MIT Press, Cambridge1998Google Scholar). The cultures were treated with 1.75 mm Ara-C (Sigma) on alternate days (24 h on, 24 h off, 24 h on, then 24 h off) to remove contaminating fibroblasts and glia. PC12TrkB cells were a generous gift from Dr. Moses Chao. This rat pheochromocytoma cell line expresses both the NGF receptor (TrkA) and the BDNF receptor (TrkB), but no detectable endogenous neuregulin, and can be induced to differentiate into neuron-like cells with neurotrophic factor stimulation. Stably-transfected CHO cell lines were prepared using the Flp-In system CHOFRT cell line from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA). The gene encoding chicken pro-NRG1 was amplified by PCR from pCDNAI/λ12.7 to introduce flanking restriction sites and cloned into the multiple cloning site of the pCDNA5/FRT vector (Invitrogen). The new pro-NRG1 vector was then co-transfected with the Flip Recombinase vector (pOG44) into the CHOFRT cells to create stable pro-NRG1-expressing fibroblast cell lines, which were selected with 400 μg/ml hygromycin, according to the manufacturer's instructions. The pro-NRG1 vectors were transiently transfected into PC12TrkB cells using Lipofectamine/PLUS (Invitrogen). NRG1 activity released from cells was measured with a sensitive and highly specific biological assay as previously described (1Esper R.M. Loeb J.A. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 6218-6227Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In brief, L6 myoblasts were plated into 48-well plates (Corning Costar), incubated at 37 °C, and allowed to fuse and differentiate for 7–8 days. The L6 culture media was removed and replaced with the test sample, and the cells were incubated for 45 min at 37 °C, after which the cells were placed on ice and lysed. Following immunoprecipitation with erbB2 and erbB3 antibodies (Neomarkers), proteins were resolved on a 6% reducing acrylamide gel and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Western blots were performed using an antibody against phosphotyrosine (pY, 4G10) as described previously (28Li Q. Loeb J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38068-38075Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and then stripped and re-probed with a mixture of the erbB2 and erbB3 antibodies to measure the total amount of erbB protein present in each lysate. Specificity has been shown by blocking this activity with NRG antibodies, heparin, and a soluble NRG1 antagonist. Band intensity was quantified on a flatbed scanner with a transparency adapter using Metamorph image analysis software as previously described (28Li Q. Loeb J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38068-38075Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The calculated ratio of tyrosine-phosphorylated erbB protein to total erbB protein provides a quantitative linear measurement of NRG1 concentration. Recombinant NGF was purchased from Invitrogen, and recombinant human BDNF was a gift from Regeneron. Recombinant NRGβ1-(1–246) was from Amgen. Antibodies specific for pro-NRG1 (sc348), PKCδ (sc937), and erbB (sc284 and sc285) were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA), and the β-actin antibody (AC-15) was from Sigma. A second anti-NRG1 antibody that recognizes the truncated cytoplasmic tail of the c isoform, 1310, was provided by Amgen (27Loeb J.A. Khurana T.S. Robbins J.T. Yee A.G. Fischbach G.D. Development. 1999; 126: 781-791Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Additional erbB antibodies were from Neomarkers (Fremont, CA). For Western blots, each antibody was used at 1:5000 dilution, and the pro-NRG1 antibody was used at 1:100 for immunoprecipitation. Rottlerin and PMA were from Sigma. Go6976 and GF109203X (bisindolylmaleimide I) were from Calbiochem. Multiple PKCδ siRNAs and non-silencing control siRNA were from Qiagen (Valencia, CA) and designed by Internet-based software provided by Qiagen. To knockdown the delta (δ) isoform of PKC, 2.5 μg of siRNA was transfected into CHO or PC12 cell lines, or primary chicken dorsal root ganglia sensory neurons (in 12-well plates at 4.0 × 105 cells/well) with 5 μl of Lipofectamine2000 (Invitrogen). The cells were incubated for 4 days, which was required for complete protein knockdown as assessed by Western blot of cell lysates. [32P]orthophosphate (H3PO4) was purchased from MP Biomedicals (formerly ICN, Irvine, CA), and used for in vitro phosphoprotein labeling as described (50Boyle W.J. van der Geer P. Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 110-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1276) Google Scholar). Briefly, CHO fibroblasts expressing pro-NRG1 were plated in 12-well plates (Costar) at a density of 1.25 × 105 cells/dish and allowed to grow overnight. The next day, the media was changed, and the cells were washed three times in 1 ml of phosphate-free DMEM, and incubated in phosphate-free DMEM for 1 h at 37 °C. The cells were washed twice in phosphate-free DMEM, and incubated with 250 μCi/ml [32P]orthophosphate in 500 μl of phosphate-free DMEM for 2 h at 37 °C. Some cells were treated with 12.5 μm rottlerin for 15 min prior to PMA treatment. PMA (10 nm) was added to the cells for variable periods of time before placing the cells on ice. The radioactive media was removed and discarded, and the cells were washed in 1 ml of ice-cold DMEM, lysed in 1 ml of ice-cold radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholic acid, 0.1% SDS, 0.15 m NaCl, 0.05 m Tris, 0.05 m EDTA, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, and 10 mm sodium o-vanadate), and immunoprecipitated overnight with the pro-NRG1 antibody (sc348) at 1:100 dilution with Protein-A-Sepharose beads (Sigma). The immunoprecipitated proteins were resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, which was then exposed to Kodak XAR-5 film at −80 °C with an enhancer screen. Parallel wild-type and pro-NRG1-expressing CHO cell cultures were lysed in 2× dithiothreitol sample buffer and run on the same gel without immunoprecipitation to serve as controls. A Western blot was performed by probing the membrane with the pro-NRG1 antibody (sc348) to confirm the identity of the 32P-incorporated protein bands. This antibody is directed against the C-terminal region of pro-NRG1 and detects both pro-NRG1 and cleaved tail fragments. TLC for phosphoamino acid analysis was performed essentially as described (50Boyle W.J. van der Geer P. Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 110-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1276) Google Scholar). Specifically, protein bands corresponding to the pro-NRG1 precursor and the proteolytic tail fragments were excised from the membrane and hydrolyzed with 6 n HCl at 110 °C for 1 h, and concentrated in a SpeedVac to near dryness. Samples were reconstituted to 10 μl in pH 1.9 TLC buffer (25:87:897 formic acid, glacial acetic acid, water) and separated on 100-μm cellulose TLC plates (Fisher, Pittsburgh, PA) with non-radioactive phosphoamino acid standards (Sigma) in PAA Buffer (75:50:15:60 n-butanol, pyridine, glacial acetic acid, water), followed by amine staining with ninhydrin (Fisher). TLC plates were then exposed to Kodak XAR-5 film at −80 °C with enhancer screens. Specific serine residues of the pro-NRGβ1c cytoplasmic tail were mutated to alanine using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA), per the manufacturer's instructions. PCR primers for the specific regions to be mutated were designed using the Stratagene Codon Replacement strategy. After PCR amplification of the mutated pro-NRG DNA sequences, they were inserted into the pCDNA5/FRT vector (Invitrogen) and sequenced for verification. The new pro-NRG1 vectors were then co-transfected with the Flip Recombinase vector (pOG44) into the CHOFRT cells to create stable pro-NRG1-expressing fibroblast cell lines, which were selected with 400 μg/ml hygromycin, according to the manufacturer's instructions. Additional site-specific mutant pro-NRGβ1c sequences in the pCDNA/FRT vector were purchased from Genscript (Piscataway, NJ) and co-transfected with the Flip Recombinase vector to create stable CHOFRT cell lines. The pro-NRG1-expressing CHO cells were plated into 12-well plates and treated with 10 nm PMA for increasing amounts of time. The cells were placed on ice and lysed. Cell lysates were separated on a 10% polyacrylamide gel. Western blot of the resulting membranes was done with the 1310 antibody, specific for the pro-NRG cytoplasmic tail. Activation of PKC with the phorbol ester, PMA, causes the release of NRG1 activity from neurons and transfected cells (1Esper R.M. Loeb J.A. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 6218-6227Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 32Loeb J.A. Susanto E.T. Fischbach G.D. Mol. Cell Neurosci. 1998; 11: 77-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). To determine the optimal concentration of PMA to promote NRG1 activity release from the Type I (β1a) chicken pro-NRG1 precursor, stably transfected CHO cells treated with increasing concentrations of PMA, and released NRG1 activity was measured with a sensitive and specific biological assay measuring phosphorylation of erbB receptors in cultured myotubes (Fig. 1A). This quantitative bioassay was used instead of Western blotting due to the absence of sufficiently sensitive and specific antibodies for soluble NRG1 (1Esper R.M. Loeb J.A. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 6218-6227Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Increasing amounts of NRG1 activity were released from these cells in response to increasing concentrations of PMA, with a maximal level achieved at 1 μm. 10 nm PMA was determined to be approximately half-maximal to promote NRG1 activity release from these cells. The kinetics of PKC-mediated NRG1 activity release was determined using 10 nm PMA (Fig. 1, B and C). The amount of pro-NRG1 and its cleavage products were determined by Western blot of total cell lysates using an antibody against the cytoplasmic tail of pro-NRG1. pro-NRG1 appears as two distinct bands on Western blots due to variable N-linked glycosylation of the extracellular domain (51Pankonin M.S. Gallagher J.T. Loeb J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 383-388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Within 30 s of PKC activation, pro-NRG1 cytoplasmic tail fragments (CT) begin to appear and reach a maximum concentration by 5 min after PKC activation before decreasing to an approximately half-maximal steady level (Fig. 1C). This observation correlated with the disappearance of mature (upper/higher glycosylated) pro-NRG1 from the cells and the appearance of soluble NRG1 activity in the culture media, as detected by erbB receptor phosphorylation in L6 myotubes. Thus, PKC activation was sufficient to promote the cleavage of pro-NRG1 and subsequent release of soluble NRG1 activity in a process that is rapid and saturable. To determine the specific isoform of PKC responsible for pro-NRG1 cleavage and release, we tested a series of isoform-specific PKC antagonists, because PMA activates all isoforms of PKC. GF109203X (bisindolylmaleimide I) is a broad spectrum antagonist with strongest activity against the α, βI, βII, γ, and ϵ, but not δ forms, whereas Go6976 is more specific against the α, βI, and βII forms (52Davies S.P. Reddy H. Caivano M. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 95-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (3957) Google Scholar). Rottlerin is a selective antagonist for the δ isoform (53Gschwendt M. Muller H.J. Kielbassa K. Zang R. Kittstein W. Rincke G. Marks F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 199: 93-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (762) Google Scholar, 54Jayasuriya H. McChesney J.D. Swanson S.M. Pezzuto J.M. J. Nat.

In dose-response studies with each of these PKC inhibitors only rottlerin blocked PMA-stimulated NRG1 activity release from transfected fibroblasts, demonstrating a potentially specific role for PKCδ in the release of NRG1 (Fig. 2A). When CHO cells expressing pro-NRG1 were pre-treated with the PKCδ antagonist, rottlerin, stimulation with PMA failed to promote pro-NRG1 cleavage as shown by Western blot in Fig. 2B. Although there are loading differences, this clearly shows a significantly reduced ratio of the cleaved cytoplasmic tail, which we have repeated in three other experiments (not shown). Consistently, the more heavily glycosylated upper pro-NRG1 band is only minimally reduced with the antagonist (ratio of 0.5 to 0.4, with the antagonist). This strongly suggests that the δ isoform of PKC works in part through promoting the pro-NRG1 cleavage event, which is a prerequisite for the release of soluble NRG1. As a complementary approach to using pharmacological inhibitors, we asked whether three distinct siRNAs against PKCδ would have a similar effect on pro-NRG1 cleavage and release. Each of these siRNAs that was first shown to effectively reduce the levels of PKCδ by Western blotting markedly reduced NRG1 activity release from transfected CHO cells following PKC activation (data shown only for one of these siRNAs) (Fig. 2C). Thus, using a combination of pharmacologic and genetic approaches, we demonstrate that the δ isoform of PKC is necessary for the release of NRG1 activity by PMA. Because neurotrophins promote NRG1 activity release from axons as well as activate PKC through Trk receptors (44Plo I. Bono F. Bezombes C. Alam A. Bruno A. Laurent G. J. Neurosci. Res. 2004; 77: 465-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 56Arevalo J.C. Wu S.H. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2006; 63: 1523-1537Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 57Zirrgiebel U. Ohga Y.

Mice totally lacking in SPT are embryonic lethal. The liver is the major site for plasma lipoprotein biosynthesis, secretion, and degradation, and in this study we utilized a liver-specific knock-out approach for evaluating liver SPT activity and also its role in plasma SM and lipoprotein metabolism. We found that a deficiency of liver-specific Sptlc2 (a subunit of SPT) decreased liver SPT protein mass and activity by 95 and 92%, respectively, but had no effect on other tissues. Liver Sptlc2 deficiency decreased plasma SM levels (in both high density lipoprotein and non-high density lipoprotein fractions) by 36 and 35% (p < 0.01), respectively, and increased phosphatidylcholine levels by 19% (p < 0.05), thus increasing the phosphatidylcholine/SM ratio by 77% (p < 0.001), compared with controls. This deficiency also decreased SM levels in the liver by 38% (p < 0.01) and in the hepatocyte plasma membranes (based on a lysenin-mediated cell lysis assay). Liver-specific Sptlc2 deficiency significantly increased hepatocyte apoE secretion and thus increased plasma apoE levels 3.5-fold (p < 0.0001). Furthermore, plasma from Sptlc2 knock-out mice had a significantly stronger potential for promoting cholesterol efflux from macrophages than from wild-type mice (p < 0.01) because of a greater amount of apoE in the circulation. As a result of these findings, we believe that the ability to control liver SPT activity could result in regulation of lipoprotein metabolism and might have an impact on the development of atherosclerosis.

There have been reports that SM affects the structure of discoidal and spherical HDL (5Rye K.A. Hime N.J. Barter P.J. J. Biol.

Sphingomyelinase deficiency diminishes lipoprotein retention within early atheromata and prevents lesion progression (14Devlin C.M. Leventhal A.R. Kuriakose G. Schuchman E.H. Williams K.J. Tabas I.

The ratio of SM to PC is increased 5-fold in very low density lipoprotein from hypercholesterolemic rabbits (15Rodriguez J.L. Ghiselli G.C. Torreggiani D. Sirtori C.R. Atherosclerosis. 1976; 23: 73-83Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). ApoE knock-out (KO) mice are a well known atherogenic model. It has been shown that plasma SM levels in these mice are 4-fold higher than in WT animals (16Jeong Ts. Schissel S.L. Tabas I. Pownall H.J. Tall A.R. Jiang X. J. Clin.

All these data suggest that plasma SM plays a critical role in the development of atherosclerosis.The interaction of SM, cholesterol, and glycosphingolipids drives the formation of plasma membrane rafts (21Simons K. Ikonen E. Nature. 1997; 387: 569-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (8010) Google Scholar). These rafts, formed in the Golgi apparatus, are targeted to the plasma membranes, where they are thought to exist as islands within the sea of bulk membrane. Although there is disagreement as to their content, rafts are considered in most reports to include about 3500 lipid molecules and 30 proteins (22Simons K. Ikonen E. Science. 2000; 290: 1721-1726Crossref PubMed Scopus (1053) Google Scholar). As much as 65% of the total cellular SM is located in these rafts (23Li Z. Hailemariam T.K. Zhou H. Li Y. Duckworth D.C. Peake D.A. Zhang Y. Kuo M.S. Cao G. Jiang X.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2007; 1771: 1186-1194Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Manipulation of membrane SM levels by sphingomyelinase can alter lipid raft composition, thus modifying cell function. For example, cholesterol efflux from macrophage foam cells, a key step in reverse cholesterol transport, requires trafficking of cholesterol from intracellular sites to the plasma membranes. Sphingomyelinase deficiency decreases cholesterol efflux through promoting cholesterol sequestration by SM (24Leventhal A.R. Chen W. Tall A.R. Tabas I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44976-44983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar).The biochemical synthesis of SM occurs through the actions of serine palmitoyl-CoA transferase (SPT), 3-ketosphinganine reductase, ceramide synthase, dihydroceramide desaturase, and sphingomyelin synthase. Located in the endoplasmic reticulum membranes, SPT is the rate-limiting enzyme in the pathway (25Merrill Jr., A.H. Jones D.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1044: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). Mammalian SPT contains two subunits, Sptlc1 and Sptlc2, encoding 53- and 63-kDa proteins, respectively (26Weiss B. Stoffel W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 249: 239-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 27Hanada K. Hara T. Nishijima M. Kuge O. Dickson R.C. Nagiec M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32108-32114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Data from in vivo and in vitro studies suggest that each subunit is stabilized by forming a dimer (or possibly larger multimer) with the other (28Yasuda S. Nishijima M. Hanada K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 4176-4183Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Another subunit, Sptlc3, has been reported (29Hornemann T. Richard S. Rütti M.F. Wei Y. von Eckardstein A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 37275-37281Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), and it is important that its functions be further characterized.Mice totally lacking Sptlc1 or Sptlc2 are embryonic lethal (30Hojjati M.R. Li Z. Jiang X.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1737: 44-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Because the liver is the major site for plasma lipoprotein biosynthesis, secretion, and degradation, we utilized a liver-specific knock-out approach for evaluating liver SPT activity and its role in plasma SM and lipoprotein metabolism. We found that Sptlc2 deficiency in the liver decreases plasma SM and increases apoE levels.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESReagentsBovine brain l-α-phosphatidylcholine (PC), 12-(N-methyl-N-(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl))-C6-ceramide, and lysenin were purchased from Sigma. [35S]Methionine was from Amersham Biosciences. WST-1 cell proliferation reagent was from Roche Applied Science. The 16:0, 18:0, 20:0, 24:0, and 24:1 ceramides, 17:0 sphingomyelin, and 14:0 phosphatidylcholine were from Avanti. Labeled 18:0 and 24:0 ceramides were synthesized internally at Eli Lilly and Co. The 15:0 1,3-dipentadecanoin was from Sigma.Liver-specific Sptlc2 KO Mouse PreparationThe overall strategy for gene targeting was to delete exon 1 from Sptlc2. Because exon 1 contains the translation codon ATG, its deletion would be expected to create a null Sptlc2 mouse model.Sptlc2Flox-FRT Mouse PreparationThrough homologous recombination in mouse embryonic stem cells (with a C57BL/6 background), we inserted an Loxp site in the 5′-flanking region of the Sptlc2 gene and then a neomycin resistance gene (Neo) cassette, flanking with one pair of Loxp and one pair of FRT (Fig. 1A), into intron 1. Five positive clones were identified out of 210 screened (Fig. 1B), and were injected into blastocysts. Chimeric males were mated with WT females. Ten heterozygous Sptlc2Flox-FRT mice were obtained with a C57BL/6 background.Sptlc2ΔNeo Mouse PreparationWe deleted the Neo cassette by crossing heterozygous Sptlc2Flox-FRT mice with Flp transgenic ones (Fig. 2A) (31Farley F.W. Soriano P. Steffen L.S. Dymecki S.M. Genesis. 2000; 28: 106-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar, 32Jones J.R. Shelton K.D. Magnuson M.A. Methods Mol. Med. 2005; 103: 245-257PubMed Google Scholar) from The Jackson Laboratory. We obtained 10 mosaic mice with Sptlc2ΔNeo (Fig. 2B) and crossed them with WT animals to establish 100% heterozygous Sptlc2ΔNeo animals (Fig. 2C).FIGURE 2Liver-specific Sptlc2 KO mouse preparation. A, strategy. A 250-bp fragment was used as a probe for Southern blot analysis. B and C, preparation of Sptlc2ΔNeo mice. To delete the Neo cassette in the Sptlc2Flox/Frt mice, we crossed heterozygous Sptlc2Flox-FRT animals with Flp transgenic ones. To facilitate screening for success of the deletion, we designed an internal 250-bp probe for Southern blot analysis. The mosaic (WT + Flox-FRT + ΔNeo) animal has 5.0-, 2.7-, and 0.5-kb signals (B); and the heterozygous mouse (WT/Flox-FRT) has 5.0- and 2.7-kb EcoRI digested signals (C). D, preparation of Sptlc2-Flox mice. Heterozygous Sptlc2ΔNeo ones were crossed with each other, thus creating Sptlc2-Flox (homozygous for Sptlc2ΔNeo) animals. E, Sptlc2-Flox mice were injected with AAV-Cre and AAV-LacZ, respectively. One month later, total genomic DNA was extracted from the liver, and Southern blot was performed to confirm deletion of the Sptlc2 gene. F, Western blot analysis of Sptlc1 and Sptlc2 in different tissues to indicate liver specificity. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was a loading control.

Marchadier D.H. Miller G.C. Gao G.P. Wilson J.M. Rader D.J. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2006; 26: 1852-1857Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). One month later, we sacrificed the animals and carried out our study. During this period, all animals were normal in terms of body weight gain, daily activity, eating, and drinking. We also carried out lipid analysis 2 months after AAV injection.Western Blot for Mouse Liver Sptlc1 and Sptlc2SDS-PAGE was performed on 4–15% SDS-polyacrylamide gradient gel, using mouse liver homogenate (200 μg of protein), and the separated proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. Western blot analysis for Sptlc1 was performed, using polyclonal anti-mouse Sptlc1 antibody (Pharmingen). Analysis for Sptlc2 was done with polyclonal anti-rabbit Sptlc2 antibody generated by Proteintech Group, Inc., according to the mouse Sptlc2 peptide sequence, 536KYSRHRLVPLLDRPFDETTYEETED560. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated rabbit polyclonal antibody to mouse IgG (Novus Biologicals) was used as a secondary antibody for Sptlc1, and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat polyclonal antibody to rabbit IgG (Novus Biologicals) was used for Sptlc2. The SuperSignal West detection kit (Pierce) was used for detection. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase was used as a loading control. The maximum intensity of each band was measured by Image-Pro Plus version 4.5 software (Media Cybernetics Inc.) and used for analysis.Tissue SPT Activity AssayMouse liver (0.2 g) was homogenized in 0.5 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 5 mm EDTA, and 250 mm sucrose. SPT activity in the homogenates was measured with [14C]serine and palmitoyl-CoA as substrates, as described previously (30Hojjati M.R. Li Z. Jiang X.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1737: 44-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar).Lipid and Lipoprotein MeasurementsFasting plasma was collected for FPLC separation and lipid measurement. Total cholesterol, phospholipids, and triglyceride in plasma and lipoproteins were assayed by enzymatic methods (Wako Pure Chemical Industries Ltd., Osaka, Japan). Plasma SM was measured as described previously (34Hojjati M.R. Jiang X.C. J. Lipid Res. 2006; 47: 673-676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar).Apolipoprotein MeasurementPlasma apoE, apoB, and apoA-I levels were determined as described previously (35Rohlmann A. Gotthardt M. Hammer R.E. Herz J. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 689-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). Briefly, 0.2 μl of plasma were separated by 4–15% SDS-gel electrophoresis and immunoblotted with polyclonal antibodies against apoE (Abcam), apoB (United States Biological), and apoA-I (Abcam).Lipid AnalysisLC/ESI/MS/MS analysis of sphingolipids was performed, using a TSQ Quantum Ultra-triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher, San Jose, CA) equipped with an ESI probe and interfaced with an Agilent 1100 HPLC (Agilent Technologies, Wilmington, DE). Lipid extracts were separated with an XBridge C8 (Waters). Mobile phase A was methanol/water/formic acid (80:20:0.4% by v/v); mobile phase B was methanol/acetonitrile (50:50% by v/v). Mass spectrometric analyses were performed on line using electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry in the positive multiple reaction monitoring mode. Samples were extracted using the one-phase extraction method (methanol/chloroform) with internal standards. Ceramides, sphingosines, sphingosine 1-phosphate, and dihydrosphingosine 1-phosphate levels were quantified by the ratio of analyte and internal standard and calibration curves obtained by serial dilution of a mixture of sphingolipids.Phosphatidylcholine and sphingomyelin levels were measured by a flow injection ESI-MS/MS method, adapted from the work of Liebisch et al. (36Liebisch G. Lieser B. Rathenberg J. Drobnik W. Schmitz G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1686: 108-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar), suitable for rapid monitoring of PC and SM present at micromoles/liter to millimoles/liter levels in plasma, tissue, or cell extracts. The flow injection MS/MS system consisted of a Quattro Ultima triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (Waters) interfaced to an 1100 binary HPLC (Agilent Technologies) and a CTC PAL autosampler (LEAP Technologies, Carrboro, NC) equipped with an active wash station and cycle composer control software.Protonated molecular ions of PC/SM species were selected by precursor ion scans of m/z 184, the fragment ion containing the positively charged phosphocholine lipid headgroup. The ion intensities across the flow injection profile were summed together, and after isotope correction, the concentrations of each PC/SM species were then calculated relative to PC and SM internal standards, as well as mean response factors obtained from serial dilution of equimolar mixtures containing 12 different PC and 3 SM standards.Samples (20 μl of plasma or 20 mg of tissue homogenate in deionized water) were increased by 5 nmol each of 14:0 PC, 21:0 PC, and 17:0 SM internal standards prior to extraction. Sample aliquots were diluted into a total of 0.45 ml of water, containing HCl, and 1.5 ml of 2:1 methanol/chloroform. After mixing thoroughly, 0.5 ml of water and 0.5 ml of chloroform were added. The samples were mixed and centrifuged (4000 rpm, 5 °C) for 15 min. The chloroform layer was removed, evaporated under a stream of warm nitrogen, and reconstituted in 1.00 ml of 75% methanol, 25% chloroform (v/v), 10 mm ammonium acetate, and 10 μl of the lipid extract was analyzed in duplicate/triplicate.Lysenin Treatment and Cell Mortality MeasurementHepatocytes were isolated as described previously (37Jiang X.C. Li Z. Liu R. Yang X.P. Pan M. Lagrost L. Fisher E.A. Williams K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 18336-18340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Monolayer cells were washed twice with PBS and incubated with 200 ng/ml lysenin, or without it as a control, at 37 °C for 2 h. Cell mortality was measured using WST-1 cell proliferation reagent, according to manufacturer's instructions (Roche Applied Science). Briefly, WST-1 cell proliferation reagent was added to monitor cell mortality. After continuous incubation at 37 °C for 15 min, the solution was transferred to an Eppendorf tube and spun (12,000 rpm) to pellet cell debris. Supernatant was then measured by absorbance at 450 nm, a reading for viable cells.Cholesterol EffluxWild-type macrophages (105 cells/well) were grown in DMEM with 10% FBS for 24 h to reach a confluency of about 80%. Cell labeling was done by growing the cells overnight in DMEM with 10% FBS containing 50 μg/ml acetylated LDL and 1 μCi/ml of [3H]cholesterol. Cells were washed three times with PBS to remove excess label and equilibrated for 2 h with DMEM without FBS. The medium was replaced with DMEM containing 10% plasma from WT and liver-specific Sptlc2 KO mice. We measured [3H]cholesterol radioactivity in the medium at 4 and 8 h. We also measured radioactivity inside the cells. The percentage of cholesterol efflux was calculated by dividing the radioactive amounts in the extracellular media by the total of the radioactive amounts in the medium and cell fractions.Tissue StainingHematoxylin and Eosin StainingAll tissues were dissected out and put into 4% paraformaldehyde for fixation overnight. Tissues were paraffin-embedded. All tissues were then sliced (10 μm thick). Each slice was deparaffinized and stained with hematoxylin and eosin according to the standard procedure.Oil Red O StainingFrozen liver sections were stained with Oil Red O working solution for 30 min. The slides were washed with water and then stained with hematoxylin solution for 2 min.X-gal StainingLiver sections were stained using an X-gal staining kit (Millipore) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, frozen liver sections were fixed with cold fixative. The sections were washed and incubated in X-gal working solution at 37 °C in the dark for 24 h. They were then rinsed with PBS and subsequently distilled water. Finally, the sections were mounted directly with aqueous mounting medium.β-Galactosidase ImmunostainingFrozen liver sections were incubated with anti-β-galactosidase antibody (1:500 dilution) at 4 °C overnight. The sections were washed two times in Tris/saline buffer for 5 min and then incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate secondary antibody (1:200 dilution) at room temperature in the dark for 1 h. Again in the dark, sections were washed twice with Tris/saline buffer for 5 min. Finally, they were examined under a fluorescent microscope.Primary Hepatocyte Culture and Immunoprecipitation of ApoE from Culture Medium or Cell LysateTo investigate the effect of SPT deficiency on apoE secretion, a pulse-chase experiment was used in the study. Mouse primary hepatocytes were isolated and cultured as described previously (37Jiang X.C. Li Z. Liu R. Yang X.P. Pan M. Lagrost L. Fisher E.A. Williams K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 18336-18340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Cells were pulse-labeled with [35S]methionine for 30 min and chased for 1 or 2 h. The newly synthesized apoE was immunoprecipitated from cell homogenates and culture medium and analyzed on SDS-PAGE as described previously (37Jiang X.C. Li Z. Liu R. Yang X.P. Pan M. Lagrost L. Fisher E.A. Williams K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 18336-18340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar).Statistical AnalysisEach experiment was conducted at least five times. Data were typically expressed as mean ± S.D. Data between two groups were analyzed by Student's t test. Values for p of less than 0.05 were considered significant.DISCUSSIONIn this study, we have demonstrated for the first time that Cre-Lox system disruption of the Sptlc2 gene in the liver resulted in the following: 1) loss of SPT activity in the liver, although Sptlc1 protein levels were not influenced; 2) significant reduction of plasma SM and ceramide levels; 3) significant reduction of liver and hepatocyte plasma membrane SM levels; 4) significant increase of plasma apoE levels in the circulation, but not of apoA-1 and apoB; and 5) significant increase of cholesterol efflux from macrophages into the plasma. Thus, liver-specific SPT deficiency produces an anti-atherogenic phenotype in mice.SM, a phospholipid located in the surface monolayer of all classes of plasma lipoproteins (1Nilsson A. Duan R.D. J. Lipid Res. 2006; 47: 154-171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar), has significant effects on lipoprotein metabolism. The liver is the major site for lipoprotein production, and this study shows that liver SPT, a key enzyme for SM biosynthesis, contributes roughly 36% to plasma SM levels (Tables 1 and 2).We found that higher plasma SM levels and SM/PC ratios are independent risk factors for coronary heart disease (19Jiang X.C. Paultre F. Pearson T.A. Reed R.G. Francis C.K. Lin M. Berglund L. Tall A.R. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2000; 20: 2614-2618Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar, 20Schlitt A.

We believe that LDL retained in atherosclerotic lesions is acted on by an arterial wall sphingomyelinase, which promotes aggregation by converting SM to ceramide (10Hoff H.F. Morton R.E. Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci. 1985; 454: 183-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 11Guyton J.R. Klemp K.F. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc.

Invest. 1996; 98: 1455-1464Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). There are two ways of preventing this atherogenic event, the first being reduction of sphingomyelinase levels. Indeed, it has recently been reported that apoE KO mice lacking in sphingomyelinase have decreased development of early atherosclerotic lesions and, more important, decreased retention of atherogenic lipoproteins, compared with apoE KO matched for similar plasma lipoprotein levels (14Devlin C.M. Leventhal A.R. Kuriakose G. Schuchman E.H. Williams K.J. Tabas I. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2008; 28: 1723-1730Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The second approach for preventing the atherogenic event cited above is through reduction of SM levels in the atherogenic lipoproteins. This can be done by inhibiting the SM biosynthesis pathway in the lipoprotein-producing tissues, the liver and small intestine. We have found that liver-specific SPT deficiency can significantly decrease SM in the circulation. We observed that a liver SPT deficiency caused a 36% reduction of plasma SM levels (Table 1 and 2). There are three possible explanations for our not observing a larger effect as follows: 1) there may still have been some residual SPT activity after AAV-LacZ treatment (Fig. 2G) in the liver; 2) other organs, for example, the"
https://openalex.org/W2074950378,"Proinflammatory cytokines induce nitric oxide-dependent DNA damage and ultimately beta-cell death. Not only does nitric oxide cause beta-cell damage, it also activates a functional repair process. In this study, the mechanisms activated by nitric oxide that facilitate the repair of damaged beta-cell DNA are examined. JNK plays a central regulatory role because inhibition of this kinase attenuates the repair of nitric oxide-induced DNA damage. p53 is a logical target of JNK-dependent DNA repair; however, nitric oxide does not stimulate p53 activation or accumulation in beta-cells. Further, knockdown of basal p53 levels does not affect DNA repair. In contrast, expression of growth arrest and DNA damage (GADD) 45alpha, a DNA repair gene that can be regulated by p53-dependent and p53-independent pathways, is stimulated by nitric oxide in a JNK-dependent manner, and knockdown of GADD45alpha expression attenuates the repair of nitric oxide-induced beta-cell DNA damage. These findings show that beta-cells have the ability to repair nitric oxide-damaged DNA and that JNK and GADD45alpha mediate the p53-independent repair of this DNA damage."
https://openalex.org/W2005213788,"The efficacy of agonists at Cys-loop ion channel receptors is determined by the rate they isomerize receptors to a pre-open flip state. Once the flip state is reached, the shut-open reaction is similar for low and high efficacy agonists. The present study sought to identify a conformational change associated with the closed-flip transition in the alpha1-glycine receptor. We employed voltage-clamp fluorometry to compare ligand-binding domain conformational changes induced by the following agonists, listed from highest to lowest affinity and efficacy: glycine > beta-alanine > taurine. Voltage-clamp fluorometry involves labeling introduced cysteines with environmentally sensitive fluorophores and inferring structural rearrangements from ligand-induced fluorescence changes. Agonist affinity and efficacy correlated inversely with maximum fluorescence magnitudes at labeled residues in ligand-binding domain loops D and E, suggesting that large conformational changes in this region preclude efficacious gating. However, agonist affinity and efficacy correlated directly with maximum fluorescence magnitudes from a label attached to A52C in loop 2, near the transmembrane domain interface. Because glycine experiences the largest affinity increase between closed and flip states, we propose that the magnitude of this fluorescence signal is directly proportional to the agonist affinity increase. In contrast, labeled residues in loops C, F, and the pre-M1 domain yielded agonist-independent fluorescence responses. Our results support the conclusion that a closed-flip conformation change, with a magnitude proportional to the agonist affinity increase from closed to flip states, occurs in the microenvironment of Ala-52."

https://openalex.org/W2074778020,"The retinoblastoma protein (Rb) plays a pivotal role in regulating cell proliferation and apoptosis. Nutlin-3, a small molecule MDM2 antagonist blocking interaction between MDM2 and p53, activates p53 resulting in cell growth arrest or apoptosis in various cancer cells. However, the molecular basis for the different cellular responses upon nutlin-3 treatment is not fully understood. In this study, we show that nutlin-3 activates p53 resulting in a dramatic increase in MDM2 expression and a marked reduction in total Rb protein levels. Interestingly, nutlin-3 reduces the levels of hypophosphorylated Rb and induces massive apoptosis in SJSA-1 cells, which can be largely rescued by knockdown of MDM2 or by expression of constitutively active Rb. By contrast, nutlin-3 treatment of several human cancer cells, including A549, U2-OS, and HCT116, results in an accumulation of hypophosphorylated Rb and cell cycle arrest but not apoptosis. Furthermore, we show that down-regulation of Rb by nutlin-3 does not lead to E2F1 activation nor does E2F1 play a critical role for nutlin-3-induced apoptosis in SJSA-1 cells. Taken together, these results suggest that Rb plays a critical role in influencing cellular response to activation of p53 pathway by nutlin-3.

By contrast, nutlin-3 treatment of several human cancer cells, including A549, U2-OS, and HCT116, results in an accumulation of hypophosphorylated Rb and cell cycle arrest but not apoptosis. Furthermore, we show that down-regulation of Rb by nutlin-3 does not lead to E2F1 activation nor does E2F1 play a critical role for nutlin-3-induced apoptosis in SJSA-1 cells. Taken together, these results suggest that Rb plays a critical role in influencing cellular response to activation of p53 pathway by nutlin-3. Retinoblastoma protein (Rb) 2The abbreviations used are: Rbretinoblastoma proteinPARPpoly ADP-ribose polymeraseFACSfluorescent-activated cell sorting. has been shown to play a pivotal role in regulating cell proliferation, DNA damage response, apoptosis, and differentiation. One major function of Rb is to interact with E2F transcription factors in assembly of transcription repressor complexes to repress expression of E2F downstream target genes involved in cell cycle progression and apoptosis (1Stevaux O.

Hypophosphorylated Rb has been shown to possess growth suppression function through interaction with a set of cellular proteins including the E2F transcription factors. Notably, MDM2 preferentially binds to hypophosphorylated Rb and facilitates proteasome-mediated Rb protein degradation (8Sdek P. Ying H. Zheng H. Margulis A. Tang X. Tian K. Xiao Z.X. J. Biol.

Recently, several potent small molecule MDM2 antagonists, the nutlins, have been identified (10Vassilev L.T. Vu B.T. Graves B. Carvajal D. Podlaski F. Filipovic Z. Kong N. Kammlott U. Lukacs C.

Nutlin-3 specifically binds to MDM2 in the p53-binding pocket and blocks MDM2-p53 interaction, resulting in a dramatic stabilization of p53 and activation of the p53 pathway.

Oncogene. 2008; 27: 5277-5287Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) and cellular senescence (15Kumamoto K. Spillare E.A. Fujita K. Horikawa I. Yamashita T. Appella E. Nagashima M.

It has been shown that an array of factors affects the outcome of nutlin-3 treatment, including the single nucleotide polymorphism of MDM2 (16Arva N.C. Talbott K.E. Okoro D.R. Brekman A. Qiu W.G.

Because activation of p53 up-regulates p21 and MDM2, both of which are important regulators for Rb, we investigated whether Rb is affected upon nutlin-3 treatment and whether Rb plays a role in cellular response to nutlin-3. In this study, we show that nultin-3 affects both Rb protein levels and Rb phosphorylation, which significantly impact the cellular responses to nutlin-3. Human IMR90, WI-38, A549, MCF-7, SJSA-1, U2-OS, H1299, and HCT116 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin in a humidified incubator at 37 °C and 5% CO2. HCT116, HCT116-p53−/−, and HCT116-p21−/− cell lines were kindly provided by Dr. Vogelstein (John Hopkins University). Stock solutions were prepared as follows: Nutlin-3 (Cayman chemical), 10 mm in DMSO; camptothecin (Sigma), 10 mm in DMSO; MG132 (Peptide Institute), 20 mm in DMSO. Exponentially growing cells were treated with either DMSO or nutlin-3 as indicated. Retrovirus infection was performed as described previously (23Chang D.L. Qiu W. Ying H. Zhang Y. Chen C.Y. Xiao Z.X. Oncogene. 2007; 26: 4627-4634Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Briefly, 293FT cells were transfected using retroviral vector or plasmid encoding p53shRNA (kindly provided by Dr. Scott Lowe, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory) and accessory plasmids by Lipofectamine2000. At 48 h after transfection, the media were collected and filtered through a 0.45-μm filter to remove debris. The retroviral particles were then concentrated by ultra-centrifugation (27,000 rpm, 1 h 45 min at 4 °C), resuspended in fresh medium supplemented with polybrene (10 μg/ml) and used to infect cells. 48 h after infection, cells were selected in growth medium supplemented with puromycin (4 μg/ml). Cells were collected, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and resuspended in EBC250 lysis buffer (250 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, and 2 μg/ml leupeptin). Protein concentration was determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay reagent (Bio-Rad). An equal amount of protein was loaded, separated on a 10% SDS-PAGE, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore), and hybridized to an appropriate primary antibody and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody for subsequent detection by ECL. Monoclonal antibody DO-1 specific for p53 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was used at a dilution of 1:250. Monoclonal antibody SXM30 specific for p21 (PharMingen) was used at 1:200 and goat polyclonal C-11 for actin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was used at 1: 1000. Monoclonal antibody SMP14 specific or MDM2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was used at 1:200 dilutions. Cleaved PARP-specific monoclonal antibodies (Cell Signaling Technology) were used at 1:1000. Rb antibodies: monoclonal antibodies G3–245 (BD PharMingen) were used at 1:400; monoclonal antibodies for hypophosphorylated Rb (BD PharMingen) were used at 1: 200. Polyclonal antibodies specific for hyperphosphorylated Rb were a mixture (1:1000) of antibodies specific for phospho-Rb Ser-780, Ser-795, or Ser-807/811 (Cell Signaling). SJSA-1 cells were transiently transfected with siRNA oligos (Qiagen Inc) using Lipofectamine2000 (Invitrogen) for 16 h. Cells were then treated with 10 μm nutlin-3 for 48 h. Cells were subjected to FACS analysis or Western blot analysis. The siRNA oligonucleotide sequence for human MDM2: 5′-r(GCCUGGCUCUGUGUGUAAU)dTdT-3′ control (lamin) siRNA oligonucleotide sequence; 5′-r(CUGGACUUCCAGAAGAACA)dTdT-3′; E2F1, 5′-r(GGCCCGAUCGAUGUUUUCC)dTdT-3′. AllStars Neg. control siRNA were purchased from Qiagen. Cells were trypsinized, washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline, and fixed in 70% ethanol at 4 °C overnight. 1 × 106 cells were stained with propidium iodide (50 μg/ml) supplemented with RNase A (100 μg/ml) at room temperature in dark for 1 h. Cells were then subjected to FACS analysis by FACScan Flow Cytometer (Becton Dickson). Data were analyzed using the Cell Quest program. It is well established that nutlin-3 activates p53 leading to accumulation of MDM2. On the other hand, MDM2 has been shown to play a direct role in inhibition of Rb (8Sdek P. Ying H. Zheng H.

Yasuda H. Kitagawa M. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 160-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). We wanted to examine whether nutlin-3 has an impact on Rb. To do that, we randomly selected p53 positive cancer cells: U2OS, MCF7, HCT116, A549, and SJSA-1 or p53-deficient H1299 cells. These cells were treated with nutlin-3, and the expression levels of p53, MDM2, p21, and Rb protein were examined. Consistent with previous reports (11Tovar C. Rosinski J. Filipovic Z. Higgins B. Kolinsky K. Hilton H. Zhao X. Vu B.T. Qing W. Packman K. Myklebost O. Heimbrook D.C. Vassilev L.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 1888-1893Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar), treatment of nutlin-3 led to stabilized and activated p53, concomitant with a dramatic increase in p21 and MDM2 expression. Nutlin-3 had no effects on p53, MDM2, and p21 in p53-null H1299 cells, as expected. Strikingly, nutlin-3 also significantly down-regulated Rb protein levels in the p53+ cancer cells (Fig. 1). The nutlin-3-induced down-regulation of Rb is dependent on p53 because nutlin-3 had no effect on Rb protein levels in H1299 cells (Fig. 1B). Because Rb function is critically regulated by phosphorylation, and the hypophosphorylated Rb is biologically active in binding to E2F transcription factors, we investigated more vigorously whether nutlin-3 affects Rb phosphorylation. Various human cancer cells (HCT116, U2-OS, A549, MCF-7, SJSA-1, and H1299) or untransformed cells (IMR90 and WI38) were treated with nutlin-3 and subjected to Western blot analysis using antibodies specific for either hypophosphorylated, hyperphosphorylated, or total Rb. In these p53-positive cancer cells, the protein levels of total Rb as well as hyperphosphorylated Rb were dramatically decreased upon treatment with nulin-3 (Fig. 2, A and B). Interestingly, the levels of hypophosphorylated Rb were significantly increased in all of these p53+ cancer cells with the exception of SJSA-1, which harbors about 25 fold of MDM2 gene amplification (11Tovar C. Rosinski J. Filipovic Z. Higgins B. Kolinsky K. Hilton H. Zhao X. Vu B.T. Qing W. Packman K. Myklebost O. Heimbrook D.C. Vassilev L.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 1888-1893Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar). In sharp contrast, nutlin-3 led to a clear down-regulation of hypophosphorylated Rb in SJSA-1 cells (Fig. 2B). Again, nutlin-3 did not alter Rb protein levels or Rb phosphorylation status in p53-null H1299 cells (Fig. 2B). Those data indicate that nutlin-3 affects both Rb phosphorylation and Rb protein levels. We next examined in more detail as to how nutlin-3 affects Rb phosphorylation in these cancer cells. We carefully compared the effects of nutlin-3 on Rb in A549 cells to that of SJSA-1 cells. As shown in Fig. 3A, nutlin-3 had profound effects on activation of p53 in SJSA-1 cells, as evidenced by a robust induction of MDM2 and p21, even at lower doses (0.5 or 2 μm) of nutlin-3. Again, hypophosphorylated Rb is down-regulated in SJSA-1 cells in sharp contrast to up-regulation of hypophosphorylated Rb in A549 cells. The alteration of Rb phosphorylation and protein levels upon nutlin-3 treatment is likely dependent on p53 because Rb was not affected in the p53-null H1299 cells (Figs. 1 and 2). To examine this possibility, we generated stable U2-OS cells expressing short hairpin RNA specific for p53 (U2OS-p53shRNA) and the vector control stable cells (U2OS-V). In parallel, we used HCT116 and the derivative, HCT116-p53−/−, which lack endogenous p53. We treated these two matched pairs (HCT116 and HCT116-p53−/−; U2OS-V and U2OS-p53shRNA) with nutlin-3 and examined Rb protein status. Again, nultin-3 effectively down regulated total Rb protein levels while inducing hypophosphorylated Rb in both HCT116 and U2OS cells. However, nutlin-3 had either little effect (HCT116-p53−/−) or much less effect (U2OS-p53shRNA) on Rb in cells with depleted p53 (Fig. 3B). In addition, hyperphosphorylated Rb was dramatically accumulated in cells lacking p53 or p21 in the absence of nutlin-3, as expected. Under similar experimental settings, nutlin-3 was markedly less potent in inducing accumulation of hypophosphorylated Rb in HCT116-p21−/− cells, indicating that up-regulation of p21 contributes significantly to the accumulation of hypophosphorylated Rb in response to nutlin-3. However, hypophosphorylated Rb was still increased to some extent, suggesting a p21-independent mechanism (Fig. 3B). Interestingly, total Rb protein levels were elevated in cells lacking p53 or p21. Because hypophosphorylated Rb is preferably targeted for proteasome-mediated degradation (27Wang J. Sampath A. Raychaudhuri P. Bagchi S. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 4740-4749Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), it is possible that hyperphosphorylated Rb is more stable due to its inability to bind to MDM2 (8Sdek P. Ying H. Zheng H. Margulis A. Tang X. Tian K. Xiao Z.X. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 53317-53322Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 9Sdek P. Ying H. Chang D.L. Qiu W. Zheng H. Touitou R. Allday M.J. Xiao Z.X. Mol. Cell. 2005; 20: 699-708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Taken together, these data suggest that nutlin-3 affects the levels of hypophosphorylated Rb in a p53-dependent manner, in which p21 plays a major role. Our data suggest that nutlin-3 dramatically down-regulates Rb protein levels. Because MDM2 can promote Rb degradation through a proteasome-dependent pathway (9Sdek P. Ying H. Chang D.L. Qiu W. Zheng H. Touitou R. Allday M.J. Xiao Z.X. Mol. Cell. 2005; 20: 699-708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 26Uchida C. Miwa S. Kitagawa K. Hattori T. Isobe T. Otani S. Oda T. Sugimura H. Kamijo T. Ookawa K. Yasuda H. Kitagawa M. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 160-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), we tested whether Rb is down-regulated though the proteasome-dependent pathway. As shown in Fig. 4, nutlin-3 treatment of U2-OS and HCT116 cells reduced total Rb protein levels, which was markedly reversed in the presence of a proteasome inhibitor, MG132 (Fig. 4, A and B, supplemental Fig. S3). Again, nutlin-3 induced hypophosphorylated Rb in those cells, which was further enhanced by proteasome inhibitors. In SJSA-1 cells, inhibition of the proteasome led to an effective reverse in nutlin-3-mediated reduction of hypophosphorylated Rb (Fig. 4C). Together, these data suggest that proteasome-mediated degradation of Rb is an important mechanism with which nutlin-3a regulates Rb. Because nutlin-3 regulates hypophosphorylated Rb differentially in different cancer cells, we asked whether this differential regulation servers as a causative factor affecting cell fate in response to nutlin-3. A549 and SJSA-1 cells were treated with nutlin-3 for 48 h. Cells were then subjected to FACS analysis or Western blot analysis. Consistent with previous reports, nutlin-3 potently induced cell cycle arrest of A549 cells (Fig. 5A) and of most cancer cell lines tested including U2-OS, HCT116, and MCF7 (data not shown), while nutlin-3 induced massive apoptosis in SJSA-1 cells (Fig. 5A), as shown by FACS analysis. In keeping with the data from FACS analysis, nutlin-3 induced cleavage of poly ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP), a biochemical marker for apoptosis, in SJSA-1 cells but not in A549 or H1299 cells (Fig. 5B). Notably, the nutlin-3-induced outcomes correlated tightly with nutlin-3-mediated differential regulation of hypophosphorylated Rb status, in which hypophosphorylated Rb was increased in A549 cells while decreased in SJSA-1 cells upon nutlin-3 treatment (Figs. 2 and 3). We next examined the effects of nultin-3 on prostate cancer LNCaP cells, which have been shown to undergo apoptosis upon nutlin-3 treatment (11Tovar C. Rosinski J. Filipovic Z. Higgins B. Kolinsky K. Hilton H. Zhao X. Vu B.T. Qing W. Packman K. Myklebost O. Heimbrook D.C. Vassilev L.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 1888-1893Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar). Similar to SJSA-1 cells, nutlin-3 significantly induced apoptosis in LNCaP cells, as evidenced by the cleavage of PARP, with tight correlation to down-regulation of hypophosphorylated Rb. These data are consistent with a previous report that depletion of Rb by siRNA together with nutlin-3 synergistically increases apoptosis (22Kitagawa M. Aonuma M. Lee S.H. Fukutake S. McCormick F. Oncogene. 2008; 27: 5303-5314Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Together, these observations suggest that alteration of hypophosphorylated Rb protein levels might be critical for cell fate in response to nutlin-3. SJSA-1 cells harbor MDM2 gene amplification that results in MDM2 protein overexpression. Because MDM2 negatively regulates Rb, we investigated whether MDM2-Rb pathway is important for nutlin-3 effects, using siRNA oligos to knockdown MDM2 expression prior to nutlin-3 treatment. Cells were then subjected to FACS analysis or Western blot analysis. In SJSA-1 cells transfected with siRNA oligos specific for MDM2, nutlin-3-activated p53 and its targets p21 and MDM2, as expected. However, nutlin-3 was unable to fully down-regulate hypophosphorylated Rb and failed to induce apoptosis (Fig. 6, A and B), suggesting that MDM2 is indeed critical for down-regulation of hypophosphorylated Rb upon nutin-3 treatment. To further investigate the role of hypophosphorylated Rb in cellular response to nutlin-3, we used a constitutively active murine Rb mutant, RbΔp34, that is resistant to phosphorylation (28Xiao Z.X. Fitzgerald-Hayes M. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 248: 255-263PubMed Google Scholar). SJSA-1 cells were transiently transfected with RbΔp34 followed by nutlin-3 treatment. Cell lysates were then subjected to Western blot analysis. Nutlin-3 activated p53 similarly in SJSA-1 cells expressing RbΔp34. However, RbΔp34 significantly suppressed apoptosis of SJSA-1, as shown by dramatically reduced cleavage of PARP (Fig. 6C). Therefore, these data again suggest that down-regulation of hypophosphorylated Rb is necessary for nutlin-3 to trigger apoptosis in SJSA-1 cells. In addition, ectopic expression of wild-type Rb was able to block nutlin-3-induced apoptosis in SJSA-1 cells (supplemental Fig. S2). We next examined the camptothecin (CPT)-induced apoptosis in Rb-knocked-down A549 cells. As shown in Fig. 6D, knockdown of Rb significantly increased CPT-induced apoptosis as evidenced by a dose-dependent increase of PARP cleavage, suggesting that Rb may play an important role in p53-based cancer therapy. It has been well documented that Rb interacts with E2F transcription factors and represses E2F transcription activity. Notably, activation of E2F1 can potently induce expression of genes involved in apoptosis. We therefore investigated whether E2F1 is responsible for nutlin-3-induced apoptosis in our experimental setting. We first examined effects of nutlin-3 on E2F1 protein levels and E2F transactivation activity. As shown in Fig. 7A, several p53+ cancer cells displayed significant down-regulation of E2F1 protein levels upon treatment of nutlin-3, in keeping with a previous report (22Kitagawa M. Aonuma M. Lee S.H. Fukutake S. McCormick F. Oncogene. 2008; 27: 5303-5314Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). In addition, nutlin-3 dramatically inhibited E2F transcription activity in both SJSA-1 and A549 cells as evidenced by E2F-luciferase reporter activity (DHFR-Luc) assay (Fig. 7B). Furthermore, Apaf-1, an important downstream target of E2F1 involved in apoptotic pathway, was not activated in these cancer cells (Fig. 7A), although both SJSA-1 and LNCaP cells underwent intensive apoptosis upon treatment of nutlin-3. Next, we examined the effects of knockdown of E2F1 by specific siRNA oligos on nutlin-3-induced apoptosis. SJSA-1 cells were transiently transfected with E2F1 siRNA oligos or control oligos prior to nutlin-3 treatment. As shown in Fig. 7C, nutlin-3 activated p53 and MDM2, and reduced the expression of hypophosphorylated Rb and E2F1, concomitant with PARP cleavage and apoptosis regardless of the presence or absence of E2F1 knockdown. FACS analysis also indicated that knockdown of E2F1 was unable to block nutlin-3-induced apoptosis in SJSA-1 cells (Fig. 7D). These data indicate that E2F1 is not responsible for nutlin-3-induced apoptosis. Because the CDK4 gene is co-amplified with MDM2 in cancers, we examined whether nutlin-3 affects the expression levels of CDK4. As shown in Fig. 7A, CDK4 protein expression was clearly elevated in SJSA-1 cells, as expected. However, nutlin-3 did not significantly affect CDK4 protein levels. Knockdown of CDK4 by siRNA did not alter hypophosphorylation of Rb nor apoptosis upon nutlin-3 treatment (Fig. 7, E and F). Nutlin-3 is a recently developed small molecule that blocks MDM2-p53 interaction, stabilizes p53, and activates p53 target gene expression (13Vassilev L.T. Trends Mol. Med. 2007; 13: 23-31Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the cellular response to nultin-3 seems to be context-specific. Only in a few cancer cell lines, nutlin-3 triggers a potent apoptotic response. While in most cases, nutlin-3 induces cell cycle arrest. It has been reported that, in addition to p53 and MDM2, MDMX (17Patton J.T. Mayo L.D. Singhi A.D. Gudkov A.V. Stark G.R. Jackson M.W.

Oncogene. 2008; 27: 5303-5314Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) contribute to determination of cell fate upon nutlin-3 treatment in various tumor cells. In this study, we show that nutlin-3 significantly affects Rb protein levels and Rb phosphorylation, in which p21 and MDM2 play significant roles. Nutlin-3 induces p21 expression through p53, leading to accumulation of active hypophosphorylated Rb. Although p21 is primarily responsible for accumulation of hypophosphorylated Rb, HCT116 cells lacking p21 still exhibited accumulation of hypophosphorylated Rb (Fig. 3B), suggesting that nutlin-3 can also inhibit Rb kinase independent of p21. Nutlin-3 also induces proteasome-mediated degradation of Rb. In the majority of cancer cell lines tested, such as A549 lung cancer cells, nutlin-3 markedly up-regulated hypophosphorylated Rb while in SJSA-1 cells, nutlin-3 down-regulated hypophosphorylated Rb. It is unlikely due to a compromised p21-mediated inhibition of Rb phosphorylation, since nutlin-3 induces p21 production extremely well in these cells. It is possible that the robust accumulation of MDM2 facilitates protein turnover of hypophosphorylated Rb. Work from others (11Tovar C. Rosinski J. Filipovic Z. Higgins B. Kolinsky K. Hilton H. Zhao X. Vu B.T. Qing W. Packman K. Myklebost O. Heimbrook D.C. Vassilev L.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 1888-1893Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar) and data from this study clearly indicate that MDM2 is much more dramatically induced by p53 upon nutlin-3 treatment in SJSA-1 cells, which contain ∼25-fold MDM2 gene amplification, compared with cancer cells containing a single MDM2 gene locus. On the other hand, nutlin-3 significantly reduces hypophosphorylated Rb and potently induces apoptosis in LNCaP cells although LNCaP cells do not have MDM2 amplification. Furthermore, nutlin-3 does not reduce the levels of hypophosphorylated Rb and does not significantly induce apoptosis of JAR cells that harbor MDM2 amplification (supplemental Fig. S1) (22Kitagawa M. Aonuma M. Lee S.H. Fukutake S. McCormick F. Oncogene. 2008; 27: 5303-5314Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Together, these observations strongly correlate the ability of nulitin-3 in reducing hypophosphorylated Rb to its potency in inducing apoptosis. It is highly likely that the balance of Rb protein turnover and the inhibition of Rb phosphorylation by p21 determines the final outcome of the biologically active Rb species, which functions to inhibit cell cycle progression and apoptosis. In SJSA-1 cells, massive activation of MDM2 by nutlin-3 likely facilitates degradation of hypophosphorylated Rb that renders cells susceptible for apoptosis. This notion is strongly supported by the observation that knockdown of MDM2 in SJSA-1 cells leads to the retention of hypophosphorylated Rb upon nutlin-3 treatment, which leads to inhibition of apoptotic response. In addition, ectopic expression of Rb significantly inhibits nutlin-3 induced apoptosis in SJSA-1 cells. However, how nutlin-3 regulates the levels of hypophosphorylated Rb in other cancer cells, such as LNCaP and JAR, must wait for further investigation. It is possible that MDM2 expression or MDM2 activity are abnormal in LNCaP cells via other means, such as single nucleotide polymorphism of MDM2 (16Arva N.C. Talbott K.E. Okoro D.R. Brekman A. Qiu W.G. Bargonetti J. Ethn. Dis. 2008; 18: S2-1-8Google Scholar), or factors affecting Rb kinase activities such as cycling D1 (29Kan C.E. Patton J.T. Stark G.R. Jackson M.W.

Cell Biol. 2007; 27: 4166-4178Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), all of which have impacts on the outcome of nutlin-3 treatment. In addition, other factors such as MDM4 (17Patton J.T.

Oncogene. 2008; 27: 997-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) may also contribute to the sensitivity of nutlin-3-induced apoptosis in the absence of amplification of MDM2. How does reduction in hypophosphorylated Rb in cells lead to apoptosis? It is conceivable that hypophosphorylated Rb binds E2F1 with high affinity. Thus, inhibition of Rb expression or Rb phosphorylation leads to release of E2F1 from Rb repression and that activated E2F1 triggers apoptotic responses. It is reported that E2F1 transcriptional activity correlates with the apoptotic response to nutlin-3 (22Kitagawa M. Aonuma M. Lee S.H. Fukutake S. McCormick F. Oncogene. 2008; 27: 5303-5314Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). However, our data indicate that E2F1 is unlikely to be responsible to nutlin-3-induced apoptosis. First, nutlin-3 significantly reduces E2F1 protein levels and E2F transactivation activity. In addition, knockdown of E2F1 does not block nutlin-3-mediated apoptosis. How reduction of hypophosphorylated Rb leads to apoptosis independent of E2F1 upon nutlin-3 treatment is not clear. In summary, this study suggests that upon activation of the p53 pathway by nutlin-3, Rb status is a critical factor influencing cellular response. In most p53+ Rb+ cancer cells, nutlin-3 induces Rb hypophosphorylation, and cells undergo cell cycle arrest. While in a subset of cancer cells, nutlin-3 down-regulates hypophosphorylated Rb and cells undergo apoptosis. Further understanding how Rb modulates cancer cell sensitivity to chemotherapy will help contribute to a better and more specific anticancer therapy.

It belongs to a new, plant-specific class of short-chain dehydrogenases, which are characterized by their monomeric nature and increased length compared with related enzymes. Homology modeling and substrate docking suggested that additional amino acids form a novel α-helical element, which is involved in substrate binding. Site-directed mutagenesis and subsequent studies on enzyme kinetics revealed the importance of three residues in this element for substrate binding. Further replacement of eight additional residues led to the characterization of the entire substrate binding pocket. In addition, a specific role in salutaridine binding by either hydrogen bond formation or hydrophobic interactions was assigned to each amino acid. Substrate docking also revealed an alternative mode for salutaridine binding, which could explain the strong substrate inhibition of SalR. An alternate arrangement of salutaridine in the enzyme was corroborated by the effect of various amino acid substitutions on substrate inhibition. In most cases, the complete removal of substrate inhibition was accompanied by a substantial loss in enzyme activity. However, some mutations greatly reduced substrate inhibition while maintaining or even increasing the maximal velocity. Based on these results, a double mutant of SalR was created that exhibited the complete absence of substrate inhibition and higher activity compared with wild-type SalR.

The benzylisoquinoline alkaloids (BIAs) 3The abbreviations used are: BIAbenzylisoquinoline alkaloidCDcircular dichroismSalRsalutaridine reductaseSDRshort chain dehydrogenase/reductaseHPLChigh pressure liquid chromatography. comprise a large and diverse group of nitrogen-containing secondary metabolites with about 2500 compounds identified in plants (1Ziegler J. Facchini P.J. Annu. Rev. Plant Biol. 2008; 59: 735-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). Among them are several important pharmaceuticals, such as the antimicrobials berberine and sanguinarine, and the vasodilator papaverine. The most prominent compounds of this class are the antitussive codeine, the analgesic morphine, and their biosynthetic precursor thebaine. The latter is used as the starting molecule for the production of a variety of semi-synthetic analgesics including oxycontin and buprenorphine. Pentacyclic morphinan alkaloids possess several chiral centers, which preclude chemical synthesis as an option for the efficient production of these widely used pharmaceuticals. Therefore, the worldwide supply of these narcotic compounds is still achieved by their isolation mainly from the opium poppy, Papaver somniferum L. With the availability of an increasing number of isolated genes encoding several pathway enzymes, recent interest has focused on the qualitative and quantitative modulation of the alkaloid profile in transgenic opium poppy plants (2Allen R.S.

U.S.A. 2008; 105: 7393-7398Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar), and de novo synthesis by a combination of chemical and biochemical conversions. BIA biosynthesis begins with the condensation of the tyrosine-derived precursors dopamine and p-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde to (S)-norcoclaurine (see Fig. 1) (1Ziegler J. Facchini P.J. Annu. Rev. Plant Biol. 2008; 59: 735-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). Subsequent regiospecific O- and N-methylations and aromatic ring hydroxylation lead to (S)-reticuline, which is the central intermediate for almost all BIAs. For morphinan alkaloid biosynthesis, (S)-reticuline undergoes an inversion of stereochemistry to (R)-reticuline, followed by C-C phenol coupling catalyzed by a unique cytochrome P450-dependent monooxygenase to yield salutaridine. Subsequent stereospecific reduction to 7(S)-salutaridinol is required for the attachment of an acetyl moiety to produce salutaridinol-7-O-acetate, which spontaneously rearranges to thebaine (9Grothe T. Lenz R. Kutchan T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30717-30723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The O-demethylation of thebaine and the reduction of codeinone to codeine represent the penultimate steps in morphine biosynthesis. Cognate cDNAs have been isolated for all of the enzymes leading to (S)-reticuline, as well as those involved in the conversion of (R)-reticuline to salutaridine-7-O-acetate (1Ziegler J. Facchini P.J. Annu. Rev. Plant Biol. 2008; 59: 735-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). Salutaridine reductase (SalR, EC 1.1.1.248) catalyzes the stereospecific, NADPH-dependent reduction of salutaridine to 7(S)-salutaridinol and is a member of the classical subgroup of the short chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) protein family (10Gerardy R. Zenk M.H. Phytochemistry. 1993; 34: 125-132Crossref Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 11Ziegler J. Voigtländer S. Schmidt J. Kramell R. Miersch O. Ammer C. Gesell A. Kutchan T.M. Plant J. 2006; 48: 177-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The main characteristics of this category of SDRs are the largely conserved TGXXXGhG motif for cofactor binding and the YXXXK motif, which together with an upstream Ser residue represent the catalytic center (12Oppermann U.C. Filling C. Berndt K.D. Persson B. Benach J. Ladenstein R. Jörnvall H. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 34-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). In this catalytic triad, Lys forms hydrogen bonds with the ribose moiety of the cofactor, which itself is hydrogen bonded to Tyr. This hydrogen bond network is presumed to lower the pKa of the Tyr hydroxyl group, which functions as the catalytic base. Ser has been suggested to either stabilize the substrate (13Jörnvall H.

Structure. 1994; 2: 629-640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Additionally, an Asn residue has been proposed to stabilize the position of the Lys residue, thereby forming a proton relay system involving water (16Filling C. Berndt K.D. Benach J. Knapp S.

Most other members of the SDR protein family are categorized into three additional subgroups (i.e. divergent, intermediate, or complex) exhibiting different overall sizes and slight amino acid sequence variations in conserved regions (17Persson B. Kallberg Y. Oppermann U. Jörnvall H. Chem. Biol. Interact. 2003; 143–144: 271-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Non-classical SDRs predominantly consist of isomerases (EC 5.-.-.-), such as galactose epimerase, and lyases (EC 4.-.-.-), such as glucose dehydratase, whereas classical SDRs encompass oxidoreductases (EC 1.-.-.-), such as SalR. Although classical SDRs are typically multimeric, SalR is a monomer because of an additional stretch of 40 amino acids preceding the YXXXK catalytic motif. In porcine testicular carbonyl reductase, these amino acids form a helix blocking the dimer interface (18Ghosh D. Sawicki M. Pletnev V. Erman M. Ohno S. Nakajin S. Duax W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18457-18463Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) and homology modeling revealed a similar feature in SalR (19Geissler R. Brandt W. Ziegler J. Plant Physiol. 2007; 143: 1493-1503Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In contrast with porcine testicular carbonyl reductase, SalR exhibits an additional stretch of 40 amino acids that have only been detected in some SDRs from plants (11Ziegler J. Voigtländer S. Schmidt J. Kramell R. Miersch O. Ammer C. Gesell A. Kutchan T.M. Plant J. 2006; 48: 177-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 20Choi H.W. Lee B.G. Kim N.H. Park Y. Lim C.W. Song H.K.

Biophys. 2003; 418: 80-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Although attempts to obtain a crystal structure for SalR have so far been unsuccessful, homology modeling using porcine testicular carbonyl reductase as a template produced a tertiary structure in which the additional amino acids form an additional helix (19Geissler R. Brandt W. Ziegler J. Plant Physiol. 2007; 143: 1493-1503Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The subsequent docking of salutaridine into the active site of this model suggested the involvement of this structural element in substrate binding, which was supported by preliminary site-directed mutagenesis. benzylisoquinoline alkaloid circular dichroism salutaridine reductase short chain dehydrogenase/reductase high pressure liquid chromatography. SalR from the Persian poppy Papaver bracteatum L. shows strong substrate inhibition with a Ki around 150 μm (19Geissler R. Brandt W. Ziegler J. Plant Physiol. 2007; 143: 1493-1503Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Substrate inhibition can substantially and negatively impact chemical engineering strategies by limiting the quantity of substrate that can be fed into a system, which reduces overall efficiency. The strong substrate inhibition exhibited by SalR could limit its biotechnological application in plant, microbial, or enzyme-based systems. To investigate the structural basis of substrate inhibition, we substituted all amino acids putatively involved in salutaridine binding and analyzed various kinetic parameters. Over the course of these experiments, substrate docking required modification because some mutations had unexpected consequences that did not fully agree with the original docking. The discrepancy was mainly due to the side chain arrangements of amino acids residing in the new helix. Precise prediction of this domain is difficult because of the lack of an equivalent crystal structure. In this report, we present a revised substrate docking for salutaridine into SalR, supported by comprehensive site-directed mutagenesis, which facilitated the creation of an enzyme variant devoid of substrate inhibition. (−)-Menthone and tropinone were obtained from Fluka, cyclohexanone, 2-cyclohexen-1-one, (R)-(−)-carvone, (S)-(+)-carvone, berberine, sanguinarine, NADP+, and NADPH were obtained from Sigma, 2H-1,4-benzoxazine-3(H)-one, 2H-1,4-benzothiazine-(4H)-one, and plumbagin were obtained from Indofine (Hillsborough, NJ). Salutaridine was synthesized by bisulfite conversion of thebaine, followed by methylation with diazomethane (23Bjeldanes L.F. Rapoport H. J. Org. Chem. 1972; 37: 1453-1454Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 24Rearick D.E. Gates M. Tetrahedron Lett. 1970; 7: 507-508Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar). HPLC analyses were performed on a Beckman System Gold HPLC system equipped with the 126 solvent module and the 168 diode array detector. Samples were separated on a Lichrospher RP-Select B column (5 μm particle size, 150 × 4.6 mm, Merck KGaA) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min with: solvent A, 2% (v/v) acetonitrile, 98% (v/v) water, 0.01% (v/v) phosphoric acid; and solvent B, 98% (v/v) acetonitrile, 2% (v/v) water, 0.01% (v/v) phosphoric acid. For the standard SalR enzyme assay using salutaridine as substrate, elution conditions consisted of a gradient from 2% B to 35% B over 13 min, a hold for 2 min at 35% B, and re-equilibration for 6 min at 2% B. Assays containing berberine, sanguinarine, benzoxazine, benzothiazine, and plumbagin were separated using a gradient from 2% B to 65% B over 25 min, followed by an increase in B to 100% in 1 min, subsequently holding at 100% B for 7 min, and re-equilibrating for 5 min at 2% B. The detection wavelength was set to 210 nm. Samples from menthone, cyclohexanone, 2-cyclohexen-1-one, (R)-(−)-carvone, (S)-(+)-carvone, and tropinone containing enzyme assays were analyzed on an Agilent Technologies 6890N Network GC System. Separation was performed on a HP-5 column (J & W Scientific) of 30 m × 0.32-mm inner diameter, coated with 5% phenyl methyl siloxane (0.25-μm film thickness). Helium was the carrier flow gas (flow rate of 1 ml/min), and splitless injection (injection volume of 5 μl, injection temperature 250 °C) was used. Temperature gradients were 80 °C (1 min hold), 5 °C/min to 130 °C followed by 100 °C/min to 150 °C. Primer pairs used to introduce point mutations into the SalR open reading frame are listed in supplemental Table S1. These primers were used together with the pQE31-SalR plasmid and the proofreading Pfu-DNA polymerase (Fermentas, Burlington, ON, Canada) for PCR (94 °C for 30s, followed by 12 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 1 min, 68 °C for 5 min). Subsequently, the PCR was digested with DpnI (Fermentas) for 2 h at 37 °C, and 1 μl was used to transform Escherichia coli strain XL1BlueMRF′. Plasmids were purified, sequenced, and introduced for protein overexpression into SG13009 (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) strains. Overexpression and extraction of the recombinant proteins were performed as described (11Ziegler J. Voigtländer S. Schmidt J. Kramell R. Miersch O. Ammer C. Gesell A. Kutchan T.M. Plant J. 2006; 48: 177-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). For protein characterization, the fraction eluting between 10 and 60 mm imidazole from the cobalt affinity column (Talon, Clontech, Mountain View, CA) was used after buffer exchange to 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5. Purity of the enzymes was checked by SDS-PAGE (12% (w/v) polyacrylamide) according to Laemmli (25Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207509) Google Scholar). Because the protein was purified to homogeneity according to SDS-PAGE (supplemental Fig. S1), the concentration was determined at 280 nm using the molar absorption coefficient determined on the basis of the amino acid sequence. The reaction mixture to assay the reduction of substrates consisted of 150 mm potassium phosphate, pH 6.0, and different concentrations of NADPH, salutaridine, and protein in a total volume of 200 μl. Reactions were terminated by addition of 800 μl of methanol, centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 5 min, and 100 μl of the supernatant was subjected to HPLC analysis. For analysis by GC, reactions were extracted with 200 μl of chloroform and 5 μl of the organic phase were injected. Assays for the determination of substrate specificity contained benzoxazine, benzothiazole, plumbagine, or berberine at a concentration of 500 μm, or 250 μm for sanguinarine. All other substrates were tested at a concentration of 1000 μm (see supplemental Fig. S2 for structures). The cofactor NADPH was included at a concentration of 250 μm, and the assays were incubated for 30 min at room temperature. Data for the calculation of the kinetic parameters were collected during the initial linear phase of the enzyme reaction showing less than 10% substrate conversion, which was either achieved by adjusting the incubation times or the amount of enzyme. Typically, the enzyme assays contained 0.5–3.9 μg of purified protein and were incubated at 30 °C between 30 s and 10 min (the incubation times and protein amounts for each mutant are shown in supplemental Table S2). Salutaridine concentrations varied between 2 and 1000 μm in the presence of 250 μm NADPH, whereas NADPH concentrations varied between 2.5 and 250 μm at constant salutaridine concentrations as indicated in Table 1. NADP+ inhibition studies were performed at a concentration range from 2.5 to 250 μm. Each measurement was conducted at least three times. The apparent kinetic data for the cofactor and the mutants exhibiting no substrate inhibition at a concentration up to 1 mm salutaridine were calculated using the Michaelis-Menten equation: v = Vmax × S/(S + Km), or when substrate inhibition was observed: v = Vmax/(1 + Km/S + S/Ki), where S denotes the substrate or cofactor concentration, respectively. Optimal velocity was determined by Vopt = Vmax/(1 + 2(Km/Ki)1/2).

Open table in a new tab Homology modeling of SalR was based on the x-ray structure of human CBR1 (PDB code 1wma) (26Tanaka M. Ohno S. Adachi S. Nakajin S. Shinoda M. Nagahama Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13451-13455Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and has been described in detail (19Geissler R. Brandt W. Ziegler J. Plant Physiol. 2007; 143: 1493-1503Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Because new experiments were not completely consistent with the model and a coil structure from Asn98 to Phe111 was previously uncertain, 100-ps molecular dynamic simulations at 300 K were performed for the NADPH-protein complex using the molecular modeling program MOE (Molecular Operating Environment, Chem. Comp. Group Inc., Montreal, Canada). The remaining part of the protein structure was fixed during the simulation. Subsequently, the structure was energy minimized using Charmm22 (27MacKerell A.D.

The resulting, slightly modified structure was used for the docking of salutaridine using PLANTS (29Korb O. Stützle T. Exner T.E. J. Chem. Inf. Model. 2009; 49: 84-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (892) Google Scholar). For all subsequent docking arrangements the complex consisting of the ligand, NADPH, and the protein was energy optimized. The stereochemical quality of the model was checked using Procheck (30Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). In the Ramachandran plot, 90.4% of backbone dihedral angles were located in the most favored area, and 8.6% were found in additionally allowable regions. The only outlier occurred in a loop. PROSA II was used to analyze the native fold of the model (31Sippl M.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 213: 859-883Crossref PubMed Scopus (958) Google Scholar). The energy plot showed that almost all residues were in the negative energy range with a combined energy z-score of −10.0, which is close to the average value of −10.9 for a protein with 320 amino acids. Altogether these analyses are consistent with a reasonable protein model. CD spectra were recorded at room temperature on a Jasco J-715 spectropolarimeter in a cylindrical quartz cuvette with a path length of 0.1 cm and a volume of 400 μl consisting of 10 μm protein in 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5. Within 185 to 260 nm the parameters were: step resolution 0.2 nm, speed 100 nm/min, response time 2.0 s, bandwidth 1.0 nm, and sensitivity 20 mdeg. All spectra represent the average of 10 scans with the background subtracted. The data were smoothed and converted to molar ellipticity using the Jasco software. The exchange of residues, especially Asp107 and Ile275, resulted in effects on the kinetic parameters of SalR that could not be adequately explained by the original model and substrate docking. Therefore, molecular dynamic simulations were performed for the coil region between amino acids Asn98 and Phe111, which resulted in minor modifications in several side chain arrangements. Subsequently, salutaridine was docked into the active site. The major changes in the orientation of amino acid side chains occurred on a stretch of residues between β-sheet D and the new α-helix E′. The side chain of Asp107 was turned toward the substrate binding pocket, which caused a repositioning of the Val106 side chain more perpendicular to the substrate binding pocket as a means of avoiding spatial interference with Asp107 (Fig. 2A). Additionally, the side chain of Ile275 was rotated around the Cα-Cβ bond so that Cδ1 points more toward the substrate binding pocket. These new amino acid arrangements led to a change in the conformation of the substrate in the active site yielding a more realistic docking arrangement than reported previously. The revised arrangement is established by the distances between: 1) the Oδ2 of Asp107 and the isoquinoline nitrogen; 2) the hydroxyl group of Ser181 and the oxygen of the 6-methoxy group; 3) the hydroxyl group of Thr182 and the 3′-hydroxyl; and 4) the Nϵ of Lys186 and the 3′-hydroxyl as well as the oxygen of the 4′-methoxy group, all of which are within hydrogen bonding range. The catalytic residues (Ser180, Tyr236, Lys240), the nicotinamide of the cofactor NADPH, and the keto group of the substrate are all in an arrangement consistent with catalysis. Comparable with the previous docking (19Geissler R. Brandt W. Ziegler J. Plant Physiol. 2007; 143: 1493-1503Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), there are strong π-π interactions and shape-dependent van der Waals interactions, respectively. However, in the new docking, these interactions take place between ring A and Phe104, and between the ring C-piperidine ring system and Leu266. Further hydrophobic interactions occur between Cγ2 of Val106 and both the N-methyl and Cα, between Cδ1 of Leu185 and the 6-methoxy, and between Cγ1 and Cδ1 of Ile275 and the heterocyclic ring of the isoquinoline moiety (Fig. 2A). Amino acids putatively involved in substrate binding were substituted (mostly for Ala) by site-directed mutagenesis. Generally, all mutations resulted in enzymes exhibiting lower catalytic efficiencies (Table 1). Replacement of Phe104 and Leu266 with Ala had been shown previously to decrease the affinity by a factor of more than 15. This was accompanied by an increase in kcat for F104A and a decrease in kcat for L266A (19Geissler R. Brandt W. Ziegler J. Plant Physiol. 2007; 143: 1493-1503Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Substantial increases in Km values were also observed for D107A, L185A, M271A, N272A, and I275A. For L185A, M271A, and N272A, the turnover number was reduced to values below 2% of the wild-type level. D107A only exhibited a 2-fold decrease in kcat, whereas I275A showed an increase of velocity by a factor"
https://openalex.org/W2036452212,"Substantial evidence suggests roles of TSC2 and PTEN in the development of cancer predisposition syndromes. Loss of TSC2 results in benign tumors, neurological disorders, and angiomyolipomas. We found that PTEN mRNA and protein levels are elevated in Tsc2(-/-) mouse embryo fibroblasts with concomitant reduction in Akt phosphorylation. Reconstitution of TSC2 in Tsc2(-/-) mouse embryo fibroblasts decreases PTEN levels. Interestingly, increased HIF1alpha activity present in Tsc2 null cells is required for PTEN transcription and protein expression. We identified a canonical hypoxia-responsive element in the PTEN promoter, which regulates the transcription of this tumor suppressor protein in a TSC2-dependent manner. Finally, we demonstrate a positive correlation between expression of HIF1alpha and PTEN in renal angiomyolipomas from TSC patients. Our results reveal a unique function of HIF1alpha in up-regulation of PTEN and provide a new mechanism of reduced Akt phosphorylation in Tsc2 null cells. These data suggest that PTEN may safeguard against developing malignant tumors in patients with TSC deficiency."

https://openalex.org/W2016789838,"Receptor internalization is recognized as an important mechanism for controlling numerous cell surface receptors. This event contributes not only to regulate signal transduction but also to adjust the amount of cell surface receptors. Frizzleds (Fzds) are seven-pass transmembrane receptor family proteins for Wnt ligands. Recent studies indicated that Fzd5 is internalized in response to Wnt stimulation to activate downstream signaling pathways. After internalization, it appears that Fzd5 is recycled back to the plasma membrane. However, whether internalized Fzd5 is sorted to lysosomes for protein degradation remains unclear. We here report that a coated vesicle-associated kinase of 104 kDa (CVAK104) selectively induces lysosomal degradation of Fzd5. We identify CVAK104 as a novel binding partner of Dishevelled (Dvl), a scaffold protein in the Wnt signaling pathway. Interestingly, we find that CVAK104 also interacts with Fzd5 but not with Fzd1 or Fzd4. CVAK104 selectively induces intracellular accumulation of Fzd5 via the clathrin-mediated pathway, which is suppressed by coexpression of a dominant negative form of Rab5. Fzd5 is subsequently degraded by a lysosomal pathway. Indeed, knockdown of endogenous CVAK104 by RNA interference results in an increase in the amount of Fzd5. In contrast, Wnt treatment induces Fzd5 internalization but does not stimulate its degradation. Overexpression or knockdown of CVAK104 results in a significant suppression or activation of the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway, respectively. These results suggest that CVAK104 regulates the amount of Fzd5 by inducing lysosomal degradation, which probably contributes to the suppression of the Wnt signaling pathway."

LIM domain-containing proteins regulate skeletal muscle development and cytoarchitecture and, when mutated, cause human myopathy. The LIM domain comprises a double zinc-finger motif, which mediates protein-protein interactions (12Kadrmas J.L. Beckerle M.C. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 5: 920-931Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar) and functions as a molecular scaffold/adaptor linking signaling and structural complexes with gene transcription. The four-and- a-half LIM (FHL) family of proteins is expressed from five mammalian genes (FHL1–4 and ACT). FHL proteins contain an N-terminal half-LIM motif or single zinc-finger followed by four complete LIM domains (13Fimia G.M. De Cesare D. Sassone-Corsi P. Mol. Cell.

The yeast-2-hybrid constructs pGBKT7, pGBKT7-p53, pGADT7-SV40T, and pACT2 human skeletal muscle library were from Clontech. Yeast baits were PCR-amplified and cloned into pGBKT7 (EcoRI site). Murine KyoT2 sequence was from pEFBOS-myc-KyoT2 (16Taniguchi Y. Furukawa T. Tun T. Han H. Honjo T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 644-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), a gift from Dr. Tasuku Honjo (Kyoto University, Japan). pET-30a(+) (Novagen), pET-30a(+)-(LIM3+ER) was generated by direct cloning from pGBKT7-(LIM3+ER) into the EcoRI site. pACT2-Siva-1 was isolated from the Y2H library. Siva-1 was PCR-amplified from pACT2-Siva-1 and cloned into pGEX-5x-1 (Amersham Biosciences) (EcoRI site) and into pEFBOS-FLAG (27Mizushima S. Nagata S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 5322Crossref PubMed Scopus (1490) Google Scholar) (MluI site) (from Dr. Tracey Wilson, Walter and Eliza Hall Institute). pTrio12R-HEN was generated by replacing the GST cassette in pTrio12R-HGN (26McGrath M.J.

This vector encodes a tricistronic mRNA using internal ribosome reentry sequences to direct expression of separate HA- and GFP-tagged proteins and G418 resistance. pTrio12R-HEN retains the XbaI site of the parental pCGN plasmid, facilitating direct cloning of β-gal and SLIMMER sequences to generate pTrio12R-HA-β-gal-EN and pTrio12R- HA-SLIMMER-EN. pTrio12R-HA-SLIMMER-GFP-Siva-1-N was cloned by adding the Siva-1 sequence from pEFBOS-FLAG-Siva-1 into pTrio12R-HA-SLIMMER-EN (MluI site). Likewise pTrio12R-HA-β-gal-GFP-Siva-1-N was cloned in the same manner. Sequence size upstream of an internal ribosome reentry sequence can alter the expression level of downstream cistrons, so the larger β-gal mRNA sequence was C-terminally truncated to equalize expression of GFP-Siva-1 between β-gal and SLIMMER vectors. Truncation was achieved by EcoRV (internal β-gal site) and SmaI (3′ to β-gal) digestion and religation of the major fragment. The following antibodies were used: mouse anti-HA.11 clone 16B12 (1:5000 WB, 1:1000 IF, Covance), mouse anti-polyhistidine clone HIS-1 (1:3000 WB, Sigma- Aldrich), goat anti-GST polyclonal (1:1000 WB, Amersham Biosciences), mouse anti-FLAG clone M2 (1:5000 WB, 3 μl immunoprecipitation, Sigma-Aldrich), rabbit anti-FLAG (1:500 IF, Sigma Aldrich), mouse anti-myc (3 μl of non-immune antibody solution, Invitrogen), goat anti-SLIMMER (1:50 IF-myoblasts/myotubes, 1:100 IF, skeletal muscle sections, 1:1000 WB, Abcam raised to the SLIMMER unique sequence 231KRTVSRVSHPVSKARK246 (15Brown S.

A unique peptide sequence of SLIMMER 284YRKNRSLAAPRGPG297 (human GenBankTM accession number AAC72886.1) and Siva-1 82ARGQMLIGPDGRL94 (human GenBank accession number NP_006418) were synthesized (Mimotopes), and each was conjugated to diphtheria toxoid by a linking N-terminal cysteine. The conjugated peptide was injected subcutaneously into New Zealand White rabbits. SLIMMER and Siva-1 antibodies were purified by affinity chromatography using their respective immunizing peptide-coupled thiopropyl-Sepharose resin (Mimotopes) and eluted in 0.1 m glycine HCl, pH 2.5. The Matchmaker 3 GAL4-based yeast two-hybrid system was used. The yeast strain AH109, was transformed with pGBKT7-(LIM3+ER) encoding the GAL4 DNA-binding domain (GAL4DBD) fused with the LIM3 plus extra region (LIM3+ER) of SLIMMER. Yeast expressing pGBKT7-(LIM3+ER) were transformed with pACT2 human skeletal muscle cDNA library fused to the GAL4 activation domain (GAL4AD) following the manufacturer's instructions (Clontech). Plasmids from positive clones were extracted and characterized. Y187 yeast were transformed with pACT2-Siva-1, mated with AH109 yeast expressing bait plasmids of the LIM and other domains from FHL1, SLIMMER, and KyoT2, and then plated onto selective media according to the manufacturer's instructions (Clontech). Murine C2C12 myoblasts were maintained in growth media (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 20% fetal calf serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 0.1% streptomycin). COS-1 cells were maintained in media (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal or newborn calf serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 0.1% streptomycin). Following transfection, cells were grown in media without antibiotics. Cells were washed twice in PBS and scraped into HEPES lysis buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 8, 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, Roche Complete mini protease mixture inhibitor tablet) or Triton X-100 lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, Roche Complete mini protease mixture inhibitor tablet).

Lysates were extracted for 1 h and pelleted for 10 min. Precleared lysates were immunoprecipitated with 3 μg of antibody as indicated together with 60 μl of protein A-Sepharose for 2 h at 4 °C. Bound fraction was washed six times with Tris-saline buffer, and precipitated protein was eluted with SDS-PAGE reducing buffer. Recombinant GST or GST-Siva-1 were produced by auto-induction of E. coli BL21 DE3 pLysS (Novagen) transformed with pGEX-5×1 (Amersham Biosciences) or pGEX-5×1-Siva-1 as described (28Cottle D.L.

C2C12 myoblasts (6.25 × 105) were seeded in 10-cm dishes for 24 h and then treated with 10 μm camptothecin (or DMSO vehicle) for 20 h or, alternatively, transfected with 25 μg of pTrio12R-based plasmid DNA using Lipofectamine 2000 and analyzed 30 h later. Cell media containing floating cells were collected and pooled with dislodged cells from a single PBS rinse and adherent cells that were detached by incubation with 2 ml of trypsin for 5 min. The cell pellet, collected by centrifugation at 1,200 rpm 15 min at 4 °C, was resuspended in 2 ml of PBS(+). Cells were counted using a hemocytometer, and aliquots of 2 × 106 cells were resuspended in 0.5 ml of annexin V binding buffer (Roche Applied Science) plus 1% bovine serum albumin (filtered), 0.5 μl of annexin V-PE (Molecular Probes), and 2.5 μl of 1 mg/ml 7AAD (Sigma-Aldrich) and incubated for 2 min at room temperature. The labeled cells were pelleted, resuspended in 0.5 ml of PBS(+), and analyzed immediately on a FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences) flow cytometer. Initial forward and side scatter gating was set to encompass all cells except for undissociated large cell clusters; when applicable, GFP fluorescent cells were gated for analysis with GFP gating established by comparison to GST-transfected cells. Appropriate nonlabeled, single, double, and triple labeled controls were used to calibrate and compensate channel bleed-through. The protocol for fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis of apoptosis in GFP-positive cells using 7AAD and annexin V-PE was adapted from a previously published source (30Ljungberg K.

Sections were washed extensively with PBS and blocked (1% bovine serum albumin, 5% horse serum in PBS) for 15 min. Sections were stained with primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C and secondary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature as listed under “Antibodies.” For detection of myonuclei, sections were pretreated with RNase A (10 mg/ml) overnight at 4 °C and stained with To-Pro-3 (1:100) for 5 min. Apoptotic nuclei were detected using TUNEL staining (in situ cell death detection kit, TMR red; Roche Applied Science) according to manufacturer's instructions.

FHL1 contains an N-terminal half-LIM domain followed by four complete LIM domains derived from exons 1–5. KyoT2 contains the N-terminal two and one-half LIM domains identical to FHL1; however, alternate splicing and removal of exon 4 leads to a frameshift and a novel C terminus encoding an RBP-J-binding site (16Taniguchi Y. Furukawa T. Tun T. Han H. Honjo T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 644-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). SLIMMER is generated by inclusion of an alternative exon 4b, leading to a 200-bp insert and frameshift after LIM domain 3. SLIMMER contains the FHL1 N-terminal three-and-a-half LIM domains, followed by a unique C terminus with bipartite nuclear localization signals, a leucine-rich nuclear export sequence, and an RBP-J-binding site (15Brown S.

Proteins that bind to and are regulated by FHL1 and KyoT2 have been identified; however, SLIMMER-specific binding partners have not been reported, and the specific function of this spliced isoform is unknown. To identify SLIMMER-interacting proteins, a yeast two-hybrid screen was performed. To this end a truncated SLIMMER bait comprising LIM domain 3 followed by the nuclear import and export sequences and the RBP-J-binding domain, designated SLIMMER (LIM3+ER) (Figs. 1B and 2A), was expressed in AH109 yeast and co-transformed with a pACT2 human skeletal muscle library. After screening and sequence analysis, one putative interacting clone was identified as the full-length coding sequence for the proapoptotic protein Siva-1 (Fig. 2B).

According to a recent estimate, each U.S. adult had a 66% chance of experiencing at least one data exposure in 2008 and a 30% chance of experiencing multiple such exposures (1). A key motivator for cyber attackers is financial gain; a study of the underground economy observed advertisements for over $276 million in total “goods” (such as stolen credit card information) during a recent 1-year period (2). The annual cost to companies due to intellectual property theft and repair after data breaches has been estimated at over $1 trillion globally (3). Yet, in a study of consumer's personal computers, only 37% had up-to-date anti-malicious software (malware) protection; of those, 23% had active malware infections (4).
