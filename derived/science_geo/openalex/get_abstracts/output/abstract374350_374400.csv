https://openalex.org/W1981307611,"Background Circadian rhythms govern a large array of physiological and metabolic functions. To achieve plasticity in circadian regulation, proteins constituting the molecular clock machinery undergo various post-translational modifications (PTMs), which influence their activity and intracellular localization. The core clock protein BMAL1 undergoes several PTMs. Here we report that the Akt-GSK3β signaling pathway regulates BMAL1 protein stability and activity. Principal Findings GSK3β phosphorylates BMAL1 specifically on Ser 17 and Thr 21 and primes it for ubiquitylation. In the absence of GSK3β-mediated phosphorylation, BMAL1 becomes stabilized and BMAL1 dependent circadian gene expression is dampened. Dopamine D2 receptor mediated signaling, known to control the Akt-GSK3β pathway, influences BMAL1 stability and in vivo circadian gene expression in striatal neurons. Conclusions These findings uncover a previously unknown mechanism of circadian clock control. The GSK3β kinase phosphorylates BMAL1, an event that controls the stability of the protein and the amplitude of circadian oscillation. BMAL1 phosphorylation appears to be an important regulatory step in maintaining the robustness of the circadian clock."
https://openalex.org/W2094843483,"The chemokine receptor CXCR4 is a widely expressed G protein-coupled receptor that has been implicated in a number of diseases including human immunodeficiency virus, cancer, and WHIM syndrome, with the latter two involving dysregulation of CXCR4 signaling. To better understand the role of phosphorylation in regulating CXCR4 signaling, tandem mass spectrometry and phospho-specific antibodies were used to identify sites of agonist-promoted phosphorylation. These studies demonstrated that Ser-321, Ser-324, Ser-325, Ser-330, Ser-339, and two sites between Ser-346 and Ser-352 were phosphorylated in HEK293 cells. We show that Ser-324/5 was rapidly phosphorylated by protein kinase C and G protein-coupled receptor kinase 6 (GRK6) upon CXCL12 treatment, whereas Ser-339 was specifically and rapidly phosphorylated by GRK6. Ser-330 was also phosphorylated by GRK6, albeit with slower kinetics. Similar results were observed in human astroglia cells, where endogenous CXCR4 was rapidly phosphorylated on Ser-324/5 by protein kinase C after CXCL12 treatment, whereas Ser-330 was slowly phosphorylated. Analysis of CXCR4 signaling in HEK293 cells revealed that calcium mobilization was primarily negatively regulated by GRK2, GRK6, and arrestin3, whereas GRK3, GRK6, and arrestin2 played a primary role in positively regulating ERK1/2 activation. In contrast, GRK2 appeared to play a negative role in ERK1/2 activation. Finally, we show that arrestin association with CXCR4 is primarily driven by the phosphorylation of far C-terminal residues on the receptor. These studies reveal that site-specific phosphorylation of CXCR4 is dynamically regulated by multiple kinases resulting in both positive and negative modulation of CXCR4 signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2006328604,"RANKL (receptor activator of NF-κB ligand) induces osteoclastogenesis by activating multiple signaling pathways in osteoclast precursor cells, chief among which is induction of long lasting oscillations in the intracellular concentration of Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i). The [Ca2+]i oscillations activate calcineurin, which activates the transcription factor NFATc1. The pathway by which RANKL induces [Ca2+]i oscillations and osteoclastogenesis is poorly understood. Here we report the discovery of a novel pathway induced by RANKL to cause a long lasting increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) and [Ca2+]i oscillations that is essential for differentiation of bone marrow-derived monocytes into osteoclasts. The pathway includes RANKL-mediated stimulation of Rac1 to generate ROS, which stimulate phospholipase Cγ1 to evoke [Ca2+]i oscillations by stimulating Ca2+ release from the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate pool and STIM1-regulated Ca2+ influx. Induction and activation of the pathway is observed only after 24-h stimulation with RANKL and lasts for at least 3 days. The physiological role of the pathway is demonstrated in mice with deletion of the Peroxiredoxin II gene and results in a mark increase is ROS and, consequently, a decrease in bone density. Moreover, bone marrow-derived monocytes in PrxII−/− primary culture show increased ROS and spontaneous [Ca2+]i oscillations. These findings identify the primary RANKL-stimulated pathway to trigger the late stages of osteoclastogenesis and regulate bone resorption.

Bone is a dynamic tissue that is constantly being remodeled. The remodeling process is a delicate balance between the activities of osteoblasts and osteoclasts. Interference with this balance results in serious human pathologies that affect bone integrity. Tipping the balance in favor of osteoclasts leads to pathological bone resorption, which is observed in autoimmune arthritis, osteoporosis, and periodontitis (1.Rodan G.A. Martin T.J.

Moreover, the binding of RANKL to its receptor results in the recruitment of the TNF receptor-associated factor (TRAF) family of proteins, e.g. TRAF6, which are linked to the NF-κB and JNK pathways (13.Kobayashi N.

Of particular importance, a series of signals following RANK activation induce oscillations in the free intracellular concentration of Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i), which trigger the late stage of osteoclast differentiation by activating the nuclear factor of activated T cells type c1 (NFATc1) (16.Takayanagi H.

Unique aspects of these RANKL-stimulated Ca2+ oscillations is that they are observed only 24–48 h post-stimulation, indicating the need for induction of the pathway responsible for the Ca2+ oscillations.

Ca2+ is a ubiquitous intracellular messenger that mediates a wide variety of cellular functions and is involved in the fundamental cellular processes of proliferation, differentiation, and programmed cell death (17.Berridge M.J. Bootman M.D. Lipp P. Nature. 1998; 395: 645-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (1780) Google Scholar). In the case of osteoclast differentiation, Ca2+ plays an important role by sequentially activating calcineurin and NFATc1 (16.Takayanagi H. Kim S. Koga T. Nishina H. Isshiki M. Yoshida H. Saiura A.

Members of the NFAT family are among the most strongly induced transcription factors following RANKL stimulation. During osteoclastogenesis, costimulatory signals mediated by the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif and the activation of phospholipase Cγ1 (PLCγ1) are involved in RANKL-induced [Ca2+]i oscillations and activation of NFATc1 (18.Koga T. Inui M. Inoue K. Kim S. Suematsu A. Kobayashi E. Iwata T. Ohnishi H. Matozaki T. Kodama T. Taniguchi T. Takayanagi H. Takai T. Nature. 2004; 428: 758-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar). The tyrosine kinases Btk and Tec are also involved in the activation of PLCγ1 by linking the RANK and immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif signals (19.Shinohara M. Koga T. Okamoto K. Sakaguchi S. Arai K. Yasuda H. Takai T. Kodama T. Morio T. Geha R.S. Kitamura D. Kurosaki T. Ellmeier W. Takayanagi H.

However, the signals upstream and downstream of PLCγ1 that are stimulated by RANKL to generate [Ca2+]i oscillations and the mechanism for generation of the [Ca2+]i oscillations are not known. We report here the discovery of a novel redox pathway activated by RANKL that is upstream of PLCγ1 and is essential for RANKL-induced [Ca2+]i oscillations and osteoclastogenesis. This study originated with the observation that mice with knock-out of peroxiredoxin II (PrxII), a thiol-based peroxide reductase that clears cellular H2O2, develop severe bone loss and osteoporosis. We were able to track the phenotype to altered long term RANKL-generated reactive oxygen species (ROS) and consequently osteoclast differentiation. ROS, including the superoxide anion (O2̇̄) and H2O2, are well recognized second messengers that participate in a variety of cellular functions (20.Harris M.L. Schiller H.J. Reilly P.M. Donowitz M. Grisham M.B. Bulkley G.B. Pharmacol. Ther. 1992; 53: 375-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Through the use of BMMs in wild type and PrxII knock-out mice and through genetic and pharmacological manipulation of Rac1, PrxII, PLCγ1, Ca2+ release from stores, and the store-operated Ca2+ influx channel (SOC) regulator stromal interacting molecule 1 (STIM1), we identified the pathway induced by RANKL to generate Ca2+ oscillations and regulate osteoclastogenesis and bone metabolism. RAW264.7 (Korean Cell Line Bank, South Korea) and primary cultured BMMs were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) and α-minimum essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) and incubated in 5% CO2. To maintain BMMs, α-minimum essential medium was supplemented with 50 ng/ml M-CSF. Receptor activator of RANKL and M-CSF were purchased from KOMA Biotech (South Korea). Fura-2/AM was purchased from Teflabs (Austin, TX). Xestospongin C (Xest C), gadolinium chloride (Gd3+), U73122, U73343, 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein diacetate, diphenylene iodonium (DPI), and N-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC) were from Sigma-Aldrich. The STIM1–1140 RNA interference and scramble RNA interference were purchased from Dharmacon (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Lafayette, CO). Polyclonal antibody for phospho-PLCγ1 (p-PLCγ1, Tyr783) was from Millipore (Billerica, MA). Monoclonal antibodies for NFATc1 and plasma membrane Ca2+ ATPase (PMCA-5F10) were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA) and Affinity Bioreagents (Golden, CO), respectively. Monoclonal antibodies for PLCγ1 and p-SUPER-PLCγ1 siRNA were generous gifts from Dr. Yun Soo Bae (Ewha University, Seoul, South Korea). The PrxII−/− mice (21.Choi M.H. Lee I.K. Kim G.W. Kim B.U.

The cells derived from the bone marrow of femur and tibia were collected and cultured in α-minimum essential medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 10 ng/ml M-CSF. The following day, nonadherent cells were collected and seeded in 6-well plates and treated with M-CSF (50 ng/ml). After 2 days the nonadherent cells were washed out, and the adherent cells were used as BMMs. Approximately 1–5 × 105 cells were seeded on a 35-mm dish and incubated in antibiotic-free medium, and after 24 h, the cells were replated. Plasmids in 250 μl of Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) were diluted with 250 μl of Opti-MEM. The mixtures were incubated for 20 min at room temperature before adding the cell. siRNA-transfected cells were assayed by reverse transcription-PCR and compared with cells transfected with scrambled siRNA. Green fluorescent protein-positive cells were identified and used for [Ca2+]i measurements. The cells were seeded on cover glass in a 35-mm dish (5 × 104 cells/coverslip) and stimulated with RANKL (50 ng/ml) for the indicated times. When necessary, cells were pretreated with the required agents (U73122, U73343, Xest C, Gd3+, NAC, and DPI), and the agents were also included in the perfusate. The cells were incubated with 5 μm Fura-2/AM for 40 min at room temperature and washed with bath solution (140 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, 1 mm CaCl2, 10 mm glucose, 310 mOsm, pH 7.4). The coverslips were transferred to a perfusion chamber, and the cells were continuously perfused with prewarmed (37 °C) bath solution. Fura-2 fluorescence intensity was measured using excitation wavelengths of 340 and 380 nm, and the emitted fluorescence at 510 nm (Ratio = F340/F380) was monitored using a CCD camera (Universal Imaging Co., Downingtown, PA). The images were digitized and analyzed by MetaFluor software (Universal Imaging). RAW264.7 cells were stimulated with RANKL (50 ng/ml) for the indicated times. The cells were lysed with ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma-Aldrich)). Whole cell lysates were then incubated with 10 μg of glutathione S-transferase-CRIB (Cdc42 and Rac interaction binding region) overnight at 4 °C. The following day, the cell lysates were centrifuged for 5 min at 13,000 rpm, and the supernatant was incubated with glutathione-Sepharose beads for 2 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed with washing buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm dithiothreitol), and the bound proteins were eluted in Laemmli sample buffer and separated by 15% SDS-PAGE. Monoclonal antibody for Rac1 was used to detect GTP-bound Rac1. BMMs were seeded in 48-well plates at a density of 2 × 104 cells/well and pretreated with the indicated compounds. The cells were then stimulated with RANKL (50 ng/ml) supplemented with M-CSF. Six days later osteoclastogenesis was confirmed by TRAP staining. Cytochemical staining of TRAP-positive cells was with the leukocyte acid phosphate assay kit (Sigma-Aldrich), following the manufacturer's procedure. TRAP+ multinucleated (≥3 nuclei) cells were then counted. The cells were seeded in 35-mm dishes at a density of 5 × 104. Confluent cells were washed with Hanks' balanced salt solution and incubated for 5 min in the dark at 37 °C in the same solution containing 5 μm 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescin diacetate. The cells were then examined with a laser-scanning confocal microscope (model LSM 510; Carl Zeiss) equipped with an argon laser. Four fields were randomly selected from each sample, and the mean relative fluorescence intensity for each field was measured with a Zeiss vision system and averaged. All of the experiments were repeated at least four times. Whole cell lysates were prepared by extracting cells with radioimmune precipitation assay lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 250 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.01 mg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.4 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 4 mm NaVO4), and the extracts were spun at 12,000 rpm for 10 min to remove insoluble material. Cleared extracts (50∼100 μg of protein/well) were subjected to 6–12% SDS-PAGE, and the proteins were electrotransferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, blocked with 6% skimmed milk, and probed with antibodies against p-PLCγ1 (1:1000), PLCγ1 (1:3000), and Rac1 (1:1000). The blots were washed, exposed to horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies for 1 h, and detected by chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). Femur and tibia were removed from WT and PrxII−/− mice. To exclude differences caused by threshold resolution set-up, samples from WT and PrxII−/− were set in one polystyrene holder. Bone density was then measured with a three-dimensional Micro-CT (SkyScan-1076 high resolution in vivo micro-CT system; SkyScan, Aartselaar, Belgium) and analyzed with CTAn and Cone beam reconstruction software. Histological examination was performed as described elsewhere (22.Mayingi J. Hélary G. Noirclere F. Bacroix B. Migonney V. Conf. Proc. IEEE Eng. Med. Biol.

Briefly, 4-week-old male mice were injected twice with calcein (15 mg/kg intraperitoneally) 2 days apart. The animals were sacrificed on day 4, and undeclacified bones were embedded in methyl methacrylate. Longitudinal sections (10-μm thickness) of the tibiae were prepared, and new bone formation was assessed by confocal microscopy of calcein green. The results are expressed as the means ± S.E. from at least three independent experiments. The statistical significances of differences between groups were determined using Student's t test (+, p < 0.05; *, p < 0.01; **, p < 0.005). PrxII is a thiol-based peroxide reductase that clears cellular H2O2 and other free radicals to reduce cellular ROS (25.Roos J. DiGregorio P.J. Yeromin A.V. Ohlsen K. Lioudyno M. Zhang S. Safrina O. Kozak J.A. Wagner S.L. Cahalan M.D. Veliçelebi G. Stauderman K.A. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 169: 435-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (1526) Google Scholar). In this study we first examined whether deletion of PrxII alters Ca2+ signaling, osteoclastogenesis, and bone remodeling and its relation to ROS. To determine the specific role of PrxII in osteoclastogenesis, the tibiae of WT and PrxII−/− mice were dissected, and bone density was measured by microradiographical and histological analyses. The bone density of PrxII−/− tibiae was reduced by ∼31% compared with WT tibiae (Fig. 1A). To further analyze the effect of PrxII deletion on bone formation, we performed dynamic histomorphometric measurement on 4-week-old mice injected twice with calcein. Osteoblast function was not influenced by deletion of PrxII, as reported by similar calcein labeling (Fig. 1B). To determine the effect of PrxII deletion on ROS and osteoclastogenesis, we measured intracellular ROS in WT and PrxII−/− BMMs. The level of ROS in BMMs from PrxII−/− mice was 2.5-fold higher than in WT BMMs and did not increase further upon 48 h of treatment with RANKL (Fig. 1C). RANKL controls osteoclastogenesis by induction of long lasting Ca2+ oscillations that starts ∼24–48 h after RANKL treatment (see below and Ref. 16.Takayanagi H. Kim S. Koga T. Nishina H. Isshiki M. Yoshida H. Saiura A. Isobe M. Yokochi T. Inoue J. Wagner E.F. Mak T.W. Kodama T. Taniguchi T. Dev. Cell. 2002; 3: 889-901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2003) Google Scholar). [Ca2+]i oscillations in WT cells were observed 48 h after RANKL treatment. By contrast, only spontaneous Ca2+ oscillations were observed in PrxII−/− BMM cells, and most importantly, neither the frequency nor the amplitude of the Ca2+ oscillations was affected by RANKL stimulation (Fig. 1D). To verify the chronic effects of deleting PrxII on signaling and bone homeostasis observed in the mice and to develop an experimental system to study the molecular characteristics of the pathway linking RANKL, ROS, Ca2+ oscillations, and osteoclastogenesis, we determined the effect of overexpressing a dominant negative PrxII (DN-PrxII) in RAW264.7 cells. Fig. 2A shows that overexpression of DN-PrxII caused an increase in the steady-state level of ROS and induced [Ca2+]i oscillations in the absence of RANKL stimulation, as was found in BMMs obtained from the PrxII−/− mice. On the other hand, overexpression of WT PrxII reduced the RANKL-evoked ROS production and [Ca2+]i oscillations (Fig. 2B). Hence, the in vitro system recapitulates the effects observed in the PrxII−/− mice and indicates that deletion of PrxII causes a decrease in bone density by inducing autonomous generation of ROS to induce Ca2+ oscillations that are similar to the RANKL-evoked Ca2+ oscillations. To further probe the signaling pathway linking RANKL and ROS to osteoclastogenesis, we tested the role of Rac1, which was reported to function upstream of receptor-mediated ROS generation (26.Park H.S. Lee S.H. Park D. Lee J.S. Ryu S.H. Lee W.J. Rhee S.G. Bae Y.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 4384-4394Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). We assayed the long term activation of Rac1 by RANKL, at the time when RANKL-induced ROS activation and Ca2+ oscillations are observed. RANKL-mediated activation of Rac1 is evident after 1 day and peaks after 2 days of stimulation with RANKL (Fig. 2C). In parallel, the effect of a constitutively active form of Rac1 (RacV12) was examined to determine whether Rac1 is located upstream of and is involved in the generation of ROS and Ca2+ oscillations. Expression of RacV12 resulted in an increased level of ROS production and in spontaneous Ca2+ oscillations, equivalent to those induced by RANKL stimulation (Fig. 2D). Moreover, the dominant negative form of Rac1 (RacN17) significantly inhibited RANKL-stimulated ROS production and reduced the frequency of the associated Ca2+ oscillations (Fig. 2E). To explore the pathway downstream of ROS that induces the Ca2+ oscillations, we examined whether RANKL induces long term activation of PLCγ1 (as revealed by PLCγ1 phosphorylation) and the Ca2+ transporting pathways mediating the oscillations. First, we confirmed the phosphorylation of PLCγ1 that was simultaneous with the generation of RANKL-induced Ca2+ oscillations. PLCγ1 was phosphorylated after 1 day of RANKL stimulation and remained phosphorylated for at least 2 days (Fig. 3A). This is the first demonstration of long term activation of PLCγ1 by RANKL. The essential role of PLCγ1 in RANKL-induced Ca2+ oscillations is shown by marked inhibition of the oscillations in cells in which PLCγ1 was knocked down with PLCγ1 siRNA (Fig. 3B). To examine the role of PLCγ1 in RANKL-induced Ca2+ oscillations in native cells, we tested the effect of inhibition of PLC activity on the oscillations. Inhibition of PLC activity with the PLC inhibitor U73122 inhibited RANKL-induced Ca2+ oscillations in WT BMM cells. The inactive analogue U73343 had no effect (Fig. 3C). Importantly, the spontaneous Ca2+ oscillations in BMMs from PrxII−/− mice are also inhibited by inhibition of PLC (Fig. 3C), indicating that deletion of PrxII resulted in sustained activation of PLC to induce the spontaneous long lasting Ca2+ oscillations. RANKL-induced [Ca2+]i oscillations were examined next. To probe the role of Ca2+ release from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), cells were treated with the IP3 receptor inhibitor Xest C. Acute inhibition of the IP3 receptors by 10 μm Xest C eliminated both the RANKL-induced and spontaneous Ca2+ oscillations in BMMs from WT and PrxII−/− mice (Fig. 4A). Ca2+ oscillations require a continued supply of Ca2+ to reload the stores between Ca2+ spikes. Potential Ca2+ influx channels can be the transient receptor potential (TRP) channels TRPM2 and TRPC3 that were reported to be activated by ROS and nitric oxide, respectively (27.Kraft R. Grimm C.

Romanin C. Kahr H. Zhu M.X. Groschner K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48149-48158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). However, reverse transcription-PCR analysis revealed that RAW264.7 cells or BMMs do not express these channels (not shown). Other Ca2+ influx channels related to Ca2+ oscillations are the SOCs, which are activated in response to Ca2+ release from the ER (29.Kiselyov K. Wang X. Shin D.M. Zang W. Muallem S. Cell Calcium. 2006; 40: 451-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 30.Parekh A.B. Putney Jr., J.W. Physiol. Rev. 2005; 85: 757-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (1807) Google Scholar). Indeed, the removal of extracellular Ca2+ and the SOC blocker Gd3+ (1 μm) rapidly terminated both types of Ca2+ oscillations (Fig. 4B). Recent work identified the ER-resident Ca2+-binding protein STIM1 as the ER Ca2+ content sensor that conveys the ER Ca2+ load to the plasma membrane SOCs (25.Roos J. DiGregorio P.J. Yeromin A.V. Ohlsen K. Lioudyno M. Zhang S. Safrina O. Kozak J.A. Wagner S.L. Cahalan M.D. Veliçelebi G. Stauderman K.A. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 169: 435-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (1526) Google Scholar, 31.Huang G.N. Zeng W. Kim J.Y. Yuan J.P. Han L. Muallem S. Worley P.F. Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 1003-1010Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar). In response to Ca2+ release from the ER, STIM1 clusters into punctae at the ER/plasma membrane junctions, interacts with the SOCs, and activates them (32.Gwack Y. Feske S. Srikanth S. Hogan P.G. Rao A. Cell Calcium. 2007; 42: 145-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 33.Wu M.M. Luik R.M. Lewis R.S. Cell Calcium. 2007; 42: 163-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). To determine the role STIM1-regulated SOCs in Ca2+ oscillations, STIM1 was knocked down with hSTIM1–1140 siRNA. Knockdown of STIM1 attenuated the RANKL-induced Ca2+ oscillations in WT BMMs and the spontaneous Ca2+ oscillations in PrxII−/− BMMs (Fig. 4C). Ca2+ oscillations appear only after ∼1 day of stimulation with RANKL and last for up to 3 days to allow completion of osteoclastogenesis. If production of ROS mediates the oscillations, then RANKL-mediated ROS production must persist for at least 3 days. We examined this prediction by measuring the time course of ROS production in response to RANKL stimulation using 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein diacetate fluorescence. RANKL-induced ROS production is observed during 3 days of RANKL stimulation (Fig. 5A). These results are the first to show that the time course of RANKL-induced ROS production is similar to the time course of RANKL-induced Ca2+ oscillations. To test whether ROS production is required only for induction or also for sustaining the Ca2+ oscillations, we determined the effect of inhibiting ROS production at different times before or after RANKL stimulation. The cells were either pretreated with 10 mm of the antioxidant NAC for 30 min before RANKL stimulation or exposed acutely to NAC and to DPI, a NAD(P)H oxidase inhibitor, during the oscillations. No Ca2+ response was observed in cells pretreated with NAC (Fig. 5B). Moreover, exposing oscillating cells to NAC or DPI inhibited ongoing Ca2+ oscillations (Fig. 5C), indicating the nee"
https://openalex.org/W2002109952,"The pandemic influenza virus (2009 H1N1) was recently introduced into the human population. The hemagglutinin (HA) gene of 2009 H1N1 is derived from “classical swine H1N1” virus, which likely shares a common ancestor with the human H1N1 virus that caused the pandemic in 1918, whose descendant viruses are still circulating in the human population with highly altered antigenicity of HA. However, information on the structural basis to compare the HA antigenicity among 2009 H1N1, the 1918 pandemic, and seasonal human H1N1 viruses has been lacking. By homology modeling of the HA structure, here we show that HAs of 2009 H1N1 and the 1918 pandemic virus share a significant number of amino acid residues in known antigenic sites, suggesting the existence of common epitopes for neutralizing antibodies cross-reactive to both HAs. It was noted that the early human H1N1 viruses isolated in the 1930s–1940s still harbored some of the original epitopes that are also found in 2009 H1N1. Interestingly, while 2009 H1N1 HA lacks the multiple N-glycosylations that have been found to be associated with an antigenic change of the human H1N1 virus during the early epidemic of this virus, 2009 H1N1 HA still retains unique three-codon motifs, some of which became N-glycosylation sites via a single nucleotide mutation in the human H1N1 virus. We thus hypothesize that the 2009 H1N1 HA antigenic sites involving the conserved amino acids will soon be targeted by antibody-mediated selection pressure in humans. Indeed, amino acid substitutions predicted here are occurring in the recent 2009 H1N1 variants. The present study suggests that antibodies elicited by natural infection with the 1918 pandemic or its early descendant viruses play a role in specific immunity against 2009 H1N1, and provides an insight into future likely antigenic changes in the evolutionary process of 2009 H1N1 in the human population."
https://openalex.org/W1967476518,"Transient receptor potential melastatin 7 (TRPM7) channels are novel Ca2+-permeable non-selective cation channels ubiquitously expressed. Activation of TRPM7 channels has been shown to be involved in cellular Mg2+ homeostasis, diseases caused by abnormal magnesium absorption, and in Ca2+-mediated neuronal injury under ischemic conditions. Here we show strong evidence suggesting that TRPM7 channels also play an important role in cellular Zn2+ homeostasis and in Zn2+-mediated neuronal injury. Using a combination of fluorescent Zn2+ imaging, small interfering RNA, pharmacological analysis, and cell injury assays, we show that activation of TRPM7 channels augmented Zn2+-induced injury of cultured mouse cortical neurons. The Zn2+-mediated neurotoxicity was inhibited by nonspecific TRPM7 blockers Gd3+ or 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate, and by knockdown of TRPM7 channels with small interfering RNA. In addition, Zn2+-mediated neuronal injury under oxygen-glucose deprivation conditions was also diminished by silencing TRPM7. Furthermore, we show that overexpression of TRPM7 channels in HEK293 cells increased intracellular Zn2+ accumulation and Zn2+-induced cell injury, while silencing TRPM7 by small interfering RNA attenuated the Zn2+-mediated cell toxicity. Thus, TRPM7 channels may represent a novel target for neurological disorders where Zn2+ toxicity plays an important role.

Despite a number of studies that have clearly demonstrated the role of Ca2+ toxicity in ischemic neuronal death, clinical trials targeting the Ca2+ entry pathways, e.g. by using glutamate antagonists, have had inconclusive results (2.Birmingham K. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 5Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 3.Ikonomidou C. Turski L. Lancet Neurol. 2002; 1: 383-386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar). Although the importance of [Ca2+]i accumulation in neuronal cell death cannot be denied, certain results with [Ca2+]i measurement have been questionable. For example, previous studies reported that some indicators commonly used for calcium imaging, e.g. Calcium Green-1 and fura-2, are responsive to zinc with an extremely high affinity, and that specific zinc chelators reduced the intensity of calcium indicators (4.Cheng C. Reynolds I.J. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 2401-2410Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 5.Stork C.J. Li Y.V. J.

These findings suggest that some of the biological effects previously assumed to be mediated by Ca2+ may be mediated, at least partially, by zinc ions. Like calcium, recent studies have demonstrated that zinc ions play an important role in neuronal injuries associated with various neurological conditions (8.Calderone A. Jover T. Mashiko T. Noh K.M. Tanaka H. Bennett M.V. Zukin R.S. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 9903-9913Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 9.Koh J.Y. Suh S.W. Gwag B.J. He Y.Y. Hsu C.Y. Choi D.W. Science. 1996; 272: 1013-1016Crossref PubMed Scopus (935) Google Scholar). The exact pathways mediating intracellular zinc accumulations and toxicity are, however, not clear. Zinc is one of the most crucial trace metals in cells. For example, zinc is required for the function of a broad range of enzymes involved in transcription, protein synthesis, and signal transductions (10.Beyersmann D. Haase H. Biometals. 2001; 14: 331-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). Although there are low levels of free zinc in cells, most zinc ions are bound to intracellular proteins (11.Cuajungco M.P. Lees G.J. Neurobiol. Dis. 1997; 4: 137-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). The mechanisms that affect the free zinc concentration are, therefore, pivotal for maintaining normal brain function. Although the extracellular fluid may contain up to several micromolar of zinc, intracellular zinc concentration ([Zn2+]i) is generally maintained at 10−9–10−10m (10.Beyersmann D. Haase H. Biometals. 2001; 14: 331-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar, 12.Frederickson C.J. Koh J.Y. Bush A.I. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2005; 6: 449-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (1470) Google Scholar, 13.Palm R. Sjöström R. Hallmans G. Clin. Chem. 1983; 29: 486-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). This steep gradient across the cell membrane is maintained primarily by zinc extrusion systems such as zinc transporters (ZnTs). At least 10 members of ZnTs, with different tissue distribution, have been identified in the ZnTs family. They promote the efflux of intracellular zinc into extracellular space or uptake of zinc into vesicles (14.Liuzzi J.P. Cousins R.J. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 2004; 24: 151-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar, 15.Lichten L.A. Cousins R.J. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 2009; 29: 153-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar). In contrast to ZnTs, Zrt- and Irt-like proteins, or ZIPs, are known to transport zinc into the cells (14.Liuzzi J.P. Cousins R.J. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 2004; 24: 151-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar, 15.Lichten L.A. Cousins R.J. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 2009; 29: 153-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar). In addition, some calcium channels, e.g. voltage-dependent calcium channels (VDCCs), N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptors, and amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazol propionate (AMPA)/kinate receptors have been reported to be zinc permeable (16.Sensi S.L.

Neurosci. 1999; 19: RC31Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The activities of these channels thus affect intracellular zinc homeostasis and toxicity. Unfortunately, clinical trials using the antagonists of these channels failed to provide satisfactory neuroprotection (2.Birmingham K. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 5Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 3.Ikonomidou C. Turski L. Lancet Neurol. 2002; 1: 383-386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar). Transient receptor potential melastatin 7 (TRPM7) is a member of the large TRP channel superfamily expressed in almost every tissue and cell type (18.Clapham D.E. Nature. 2003; 426: 517-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (2138) Google Scholar, 19.Nadler M.J. Hermosura M.C. Inabe K. Perraud A.L. Zhu Q. Stokes A.J. Kurosaki T. Kinet J.P. Penner R. Scharenberg A.M.

Increasing evidence suggests that activation of TRPM7 channels contributes to various physiological and pathophysiological processes (21.Jin J. Desai B.N. Navarro B. Donovan A. Andrews N.C. Clapham D.E. Science. 2008; 322: 756-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar, 22.Jiang J. Li M.H. Inoue K. Chu X.P. Seeds J. Xiong Z.G.

Cell. 2003; 114: 191-200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar). Notably, we demonstrated that activation of TRPM7 channels by oxygen-free radicals plays a critical role in hypoxia-induced, glutamate-independent, neuronal injury (24.Aarts M. Iihara K. Wei W.L. Xiong Z.G. Arundine M. Cerwinski W. MacDonald J.F. Tymianski M. Cell. 2003; 115: 863-877Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar). In addition to well established Ca2+ permeability, TRPM7 is, at present, the only known zinc permeable channel among the TRP family of ion channels (18.Clapham D.E. Nature. 2003; 426: 517-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (2138) Google Scholar, 25.Monteilh-Zoller M.K. Hermosura M.C. Nadler M.J. Scharenberg A.M. Penner R. Fleig A. J. Gen. Physiol. 2003; 121: 49-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). It is reported that zinc permeability for TRPM7 channels is 4-fold higher than Ca2+ (25.Monteilh-Zoller M.K. Hermosura M.C. Nadler M.J. Scharenberg A.M. Penner R. Fleig A. J. Gen. Physiol. 2003; 121: 49-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). Despite these facts, it has not been established whether TRPM7 channels play a role in intracellular zinc dynamics at physiological/pathological relevant concentrations, and more importantly, in zinc-mediated neurotoxicity. Using a combination of fluorescent zinc imaging, metal response element-based reporter gene assay, cell injury analysis, and small interfering RNA techniques, we show strong evidence suggesting that TRPM7 channels represent a novel pathway for intracellular zinc accumulation and zinc-mediated neurotoxicity. Mouse cortical neurons were cultured as described previously (26.Chu X.P. Wemmie J.A. Wang W.Z. Zhu X.M. Saugstad J.A. Price M.P. Simon R.P. Xiong Z.G. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 8678-8689Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The protocol for the use of mice for neuronal cultures was reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Legacy Clinical Research and Technology Center. Briefly, time-pregnant (embryonic day 16) Swiss mice (Charles River Laboratories) were anesthetized with halothane followed by cervical dislocation. Brains of fetuses were removed rapidly and placed in Ca2+/Mg2+-free cold phosphate-buffered saline. Cerebral cortices were dissected under a dissection microscope and incubated with 0.05% trypsin-EDTA for 10 min at 37 °C, followed by trituration with fire-polished glass pipettes. Cells were counted and plated in poly-l-ornithine-coated culture dishes or 24-well plates at a density of 1 × 106 cells/dish or 2 × 105 cells/well, respectively. Neurons were cultured with Neurobasal medium supplemented with B-27 (Invitrogen), and maintained at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere incubator. Cultures were fed twice a week. Neurons were used for the experiments between days 11 and 15 in vitro. Human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cells, with inducible expression of human TRPM7 channels (HEK:TRPM7 cells), were cultured in minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics (19.Nadler M.J. Hermosura M.C. Inabe K. Perraud A.L. Zhu Q. Stokes A.J. Kurosaki T. Kinet J.P. Penner R. Scharenberg A.M. Fleig A. Nature. 2001; 411: 590-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (798) Google Scholar). For the induction of TRPM7, the cells were treated with 1 μg/ml of tetracycline, as described in our previous studies (22.Jiang J. Li M.H. Inoue K. Chu X.P. Seeds J. Xiong Z.G. Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 10929-10938Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Immunoblotting was performed as described previously (27.Inoue K. Ueno S. Fukuda A. FEBS Lett. 2004; 564: 131-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Cells cultured in 35-mm dishes or 6-well plates were lysed in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, and protease inhibitors (Roche Diagnostics)). After centrifugation at 12,000 × g at 4 °C for 30 min the lysates were collected. The aliquots were then mixed with Laemmli sample buffer and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. The samples were resolved by 7.5% SDS-PAGE, followed by electrotransfer to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. For visualization, blots were probed with antibodies against TRPM7 (1:250; Abgent) or β-actin (1:2000; Abcam), and detected using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:1000; Cell Signaling) and an ECL kit (GE Healthcare). The intensity of the protein band was densitometrically quantified. The plasmid containing short hairpin RNA (shRNA) for silencing human TRPM7 was described previously (22.Jiang J. Li M.H. Inoue K. Chu X.P. Seeds J. Xiong Z.G. Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 10929-10938Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). To construct the plasmid for silencing mouse TRPM7, two oligonucleotides were annealed and inserted into pSilencer 1.0-U6 (Ambion) according to manufacturer's instructions. The target sequence for TRPM7 corresponded to coding region 5152–5172 (GenBank accession number NM021450 (28.Wei W.L. Sun H.S. Olah M.E. Sun X. Czerwinska E. Czerwinski W. Mori Y.

A fragment cut with BamHI was excised and inserted into the BamHI site of pCAGGS-eGFP (kindly provided by Dr. J. Miyazaki, Division of Stem Cell Regulation Research, Osaka University Medical School, Osaka, Japan) to express both enhanced green fluorescence protein (eGFP) and shRNA (TRPM7-shRNA/eGFP) (29.Niwa H. Yamamura K. Miyazaki J. Gene. 1991; 108: 193-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (4584) Google Scholar). For the negative control, a fragment cut with BamHI from pSilencer 1.0-U6 was inserted into pCAGGS-eGFP (control/eGFP). For transfection, FuGENE HD (Roche Diagnostics) and NeuroFect (Genlantis) were used for HEK:TRPM7 cells, and for cortical neurons (between days 8 and 11 in vitro) in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. The transfection efficiencies, as determined by eGFP-positive cells, were 2–5% for cultured mouse cortical neurons. LDH measurement was performed as described in our previous studies (30.Xiong Z.G. Zhu X.M. Chu X.P. Minami M. Hey J. Wei W.L. MacDonald J.F. Wemmie J.A. Price M.P. Welsh M.J. Simon R.P.

Stroke. 2007; 38: 670-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Cells grown on 24-well plates were first washed with phosphate-buffered saline. 50 μl of the culture medium was taken from each well and placed into a 96-well plate for background LDH measurement. Cells were then treated with zinc containing medium for 1 or 2 h, followed by a wash and incubation in normal culture medium for 23 or 22 h, respectively. 50 μl of the medium was transferred from each well to 96-well plates for measurement of injury-mediated LDH release. For measurement of the maximal releasable LDH, cells were incubated with Triton X-100 (final concentration 0.5%) for 30 min at the end of each experiment. 50 μl of assay reagent from the cytotoxicity detection kit (Roche Diagnostics) was added to each sample according to the manufacturer's instructions. 30 min later, the absorbance at 492 and 620 nm was examined by a spectrometer (SpectraMax Plus, Molecular Devices). The values of the absorbance at 492 nm were subtracted by those at 620 nm to yield the value of LDH release. Cells grown on 24-well plates were transfected with p(MREa)6-Luc (kindly provided by Dr. C. Seguin, Centre de Recherche en Cancerologie de l'Universite Laval) together with pRL-TK (Promega) to measure transfection efficiency (32.LaRochelle O. Gagné V. Charron J. Soh J.W. Séguin C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41879-41888Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Expression plasmids were transfected in the following amounts per well: 0.3 μg of p(MREa)6-Luc and 0.1 μg of pLR-TK for HEK:TRPM7 cells; 0.8 μg of shRNA-containing pCAGGS-eGFP, 0.9 μg of p(MREa)6-Luc, and 0.3 μg of pLR-TK for cortical neurons. Luciferase assays were performed using the Dual-Luciferase Reporter System (Promega) with a microplate luminometer (VeritasTM, Turner Biosystems), in which relative firefly luciferase activity was calculated by normalizing the transfection efficiency according Renilla luciferase activity. Relative firefly luciferase activity detected in the cell lysates was presented (33.Inoue K. Zama T. Kamimoto T. Aoki R. Ikeda Y. Kimura H. Hagiwara M. Genes Cells. 2004; 9: 59-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The intracellular zinc level of HEK:TRPM7 cells or mouse cortical neurons was imaged using a zinc-sensitive fluorescent dye, FluoZin-3 (Invitrogen). Cells were incubated with 5 μm FluoZin-3-AM in standard extracellular fluid (ECF) for 30 min at 37 °C, followed by de-esterification of the dye for another 30 min at room temperature (22–25 °C). The coverslips containing dye-loaded cells were held in a recording chamber placed on the stage of an inverted microscope (Eclipse TE2000-U; Nikon), and superfused with standard ECF at room temperature for at least 10 min prior to experiments. FluoZin-3 was excited at a wavelength of 490 nm, and emitted light was filtered with a 500–550-nm band pass filter. Zinc fluorescence was detected with a ×40 objective lens (Super Fluor ×40, numerical aperture = 0.90; Nikon) and a CCD camera (CoolSNAP ES2; Photometrics), using Imaging Workbench software (INDEC BioSystems). Fluorescence intensities (ΔF) were normalized to the resting values (F, average of five-data points recorded immediately before the change of solutions). For electrophysiology recording and zinc imaging, cells were superfused with a standard ECF containing (in mm) 140 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, 33 glucose, 20 HEPES (pH 7.4, adjusted with NaOH, and 320–335 mosmol with sucrose). For cortical neurons, MK-801 (10 μm; Sigma), 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (20 μm; Sigma), and nimodipine (5 μm; Sigma) were included in the extracellular solutions to block potential zinc entry through NMDA and AMPA/kinate receptors, and VDCCs. OGD was performed as described in our previous studies (30.Xiong Z.G. Zhu X.M. Chu X.P. Minami M. Hey J. Wei W.L. MacDonald J.F. Wemmie J.A. Price M.P. Welsh M.J. Simon R.P. Cell. 2004; 118: 687-698Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (865) Google Scholar). The cultured cells were treated with glucose-free ECF containing (in mm) 140 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, 33 N-methyl-d-glucamine (or N-methyl-d-glucammonium at physiological pH), and 20 HEPES (pH 7.4, 320–335 mosmol), and then transferred to an anaerobic chamber containing 5% CO2 and 95% N2 atmosphere for 1 h. Cells were then washed with phosphate-buffered saline and placed in a normal cell culture incubator. All OGD experiments were carried out at 37 °C. Cortical neurons were cultured on etched coverslips (Bellco Biotechnology) for monitoring the same cells before and after treatments. Three days after transfection, cells were treated with the indicated conditions for 1 h and then incubated in normal culture medium for 23 h. PI was added to the culture medium to a final concentration of 5 μg/ml. Images of the eGFP-positive cells were taken with the same fluorescent microscope used for zinc imaging. PI-positive cells were regarded as injured cells. PI was excited at a wavelength of 540 nm, and emitted light was filtered with a 550–660-nm band pass filter. 6–20 cells were evaluated in each culture, and 3–5 independent cultures were included for each group. Whole cell patch clamp recordings were performed as described previously (22.Jiang J. Li M.H. Inoue K. Chu X.P. Seeds J. Xiong Z.G. Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 10929-10938Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 34.Inoue K. Xiong Z.G. Cardiovasc. Res. 2009; 83: 547-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). 3–4 days after transfection, cells were set on the stage of the microscope and continuously superfused with ECF at room temperature. Patch electrodes were fabricated from borosilicate capillary tubing of 1.5-mm diameter (WPI) using a Narishige PP-83 vertical puller (Narishige). The electrode resistance ranged from 3 to 4 megohms when filled with the intracellular solution. Membrane currents were recorded using an Axopatch 200B amplifier. Data were filtered at 2 kHz and digitized at 5 kHz using a Digidata 1322A data acquisition system (Molecular Devices). Pipettes were filled with a solution containing (in mm) 140 CsF, 11 EGTA, 5 tetraethylammonium chloride, and 10 HEPES (pH 7.3, adjusted with CsOH). A multibarrel perfusion system (SF-77B, Warner Instrument) was employed for rapid exchange of solutions. Data were expressed as mean ± S.E. Groups were compared using one-way analysis of variance followed by Dunnett's test or unpaired Student's t test as appropriate. p < 0.05 was regarded as statistically significant (*, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01). Functional TRPM7 channels are expressed in neuronal cells where they play important roles in both physiological and pathological conditions (24.Aarts M. Iihara K. Wei W.L. Xiong Z.G. Arundine M.

Clapham D.E. Neuron. 2006; 52: 485-496Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Also, zinc ions have been reported to permeate through TRPM7 channels in heterologous expression systems (25.Monteilh-Zoller M.K. Hermosura M.C. Nadler M.J. Scharenberg A.M. Penner R. Fleig A. J. Gen. Physiol. 2003; 121: 49-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). However, whether TRPM7 channels play a role in neuronal zinc dynamics and zinc-mediated neurotoxicity has never been explored. Therefore, we first examined whether promoting the activation of these channels affects zinc-induced injury of cultured mouse cortical neurons. In all experiments, the blockers for NMDA receptors, AMPA/kinate receptors, and VDCCs were included in the extracellular solutions to eliminate the potential zinc entry through these pathways (see “Experimental Procedures”). When 30 μm zinc was added to the extracellular solution to mimic brain ischemia (12.Frederickson C.J. Koh J.Y. Bush A.I. Nat. Rev.

This zinc-induced cell injury was, however, dramatically exacerbated by Ca2+/Mg2+ removal (Fig. 1, A and B), a condition known to activate TRPM7 channels (22.Jiang J. Li M.H. Inoue K. Chu X.P. Seeds J. Xiong Z.G. Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 10929-10938Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 24.Aarts M. Iihara K. Wei W.L. Xiong Z.G. Arundine M. Cerwinski W. MacDonald J.F. Tymianski M.

These results suggest that activation of TRPM7 channels promotes zinc toxicity in native neurons. Consistent with an involvement of TRPM7 channels, addition of Gd3+ and 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate, nonspecific inhibitors of TRPM7 channels (22.Jiang J. Li M.H. Inoue K. Chu X.P. Seeds J.

We next examined whether altering the function of TRPM7 channels affects intracellular zinc accumulation in cultured mouse cortical neurons using a zinc indicator FluoZin-3 (38.Gee K.R. Zhou Z.L. Qian W.J. Kennedy R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002; 124: 776-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2, A and B, application of 30 μm zinc in normal ECF slightly increased FluoZin-3 fluorescence intensity in cortical neurons (Fig. 2, A and B, blue circle). Activation of TRPM7 channels by removing Ca2+/Mg2+ from the ECF induced a dramatic increase of FluoZin-3 fluorescence intensity (Fig. 2, A and B, red circle). Addition of Gd3+ (10 μm) dramatically attenuated the increase of FluoZin-3 fluorescence induced by Ca2+/Mg2+ removal (Fig. 2, A and B, green triangle). In contrast, addition of Gd3+ did not affect the baseline FluoZin-3 fluorescence intensity (n = 9, supplemental Fig. S1A). Addition of (2-pyridylmethyl)ethylenediamine (TPEN), a high affinity zinc chelator (31.Hey J.G. Chu X.P. Seeds J. Simon R.P. Xiong Z.G. Stroke. 2007; 38: 670-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), completely eliminated the increase of FluoZin-3 fluorescence intensity (supplemental Fig. S2A). Together, these data suggest that activation of TRPM7 channels can cause increases of [Zn2+]i in mouse cortical neurons. To provide further evidence supporting the contribution of TRPM7 channels to zinc toxicity, we investigated if changing the expression levels of TRPM7 channels influences the zinc-mediated cell injury. We used HEK293 cells with inducible expression of TRPM7 channels (19.Nadler M.J. Hermosura M.C. Inabe K."
https://openalex.org/W2074828584,"Activation of Src family kinases (SFK) and the subsequent phosphorylation of VE-cadherin have been proposed as major regulatory steps leading to increases in vascular permeability in response to inflammatory mediators and growth factors. To investigate Src signaling in the absence of parallel signaling pathways initiated by growth factors or inflammatory mediators, we activated Src and SFKs by expression of dominant negative Csk, expression of constitutively active Src, or knockdown of Csk. Activation of SFK by overexpression of dominant negative Csk induced VE-cadherin phosphorylation at tyrosines 658, 685, and 731. However, dominant negative Csk expression was unable to induce changes in the monolayer permeability. In contrast, expression of constitutively active Src decreased barrier function and promoted VE-cadherin phosphorylation on tyrosines 658 and 731, although the increase in VE-cadherin phosphorylation preceded the increase in permeability by 4–6 h. Csk knockdown induced VE-cadherin phosphorylation at sites 658 and 731 but did not induce a loss in barrier function. Co-immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence studies suggest that phosphorylation of those sites did not impair VE-cadherin ability to bind p120 and β-catenin or the ability of these proteins to localize at the plasma membrane. Taken together, our data show that Src-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of VE-cadherin is not sufficient to promote an increase in endothelial cell monolayer permeability and suggest that signaling leading to changes in vascular permeability in response to inflammatory mediators or growth factors may require VE-cadherin tyrosine phosphorylation concurrently with other signaling pathways to promote loss of barrier function.

https://openalex.org/W2026644865,"Background The most well known reproductive consequence of residence at high altitude (HA >2700 m) is reduction in fetal growth. Reduced fetoplacental oxygenation is an underlying cause of pregnancy pathologies, including intrauterine growth restriction and preeclampsia, which are more common at HA. Therefore, altitude is a natural experimental model to study the etiology of pregnancy pathophysiologies. We have shown that the proximate cause of decreased fetal growth is not reduced oxygen availability, delivery, or consumption. We therefore asked whether glucose, the primary substrate for fetal growth, might be decreased and/or whether altered fetoplacental glucose metabolism might account for reduced fetal growth at HA. Methods Doppler and ultrasound were used to measure maternal uterine and fetal umbilical blood flows in 69 and 58 residents of 400 vs 3600 m. Arterial and venous blood samples from mother and fetus were collected at elective cesarean delivery and analyzed for glucose, lactate and insulin. Maternal delivery and fetal uptakes for oxygen and glucose were calculated. Principal Findings The maternal arterial – venous glucose concentration difference was greater at HA. However, umbilical venous and arterial glucose concentrations were markedly decreased, resulting in lower glucose delivery at 3600 m. Fetal glucose consumption was reduced by >28%, but strongly correlated with glucose delivery, highlighting the relevance of glucose concentration to fetal uptake. At altitude, fetal lactate levels were increased, insulin concentrations decreased, and the expression of GLUT1 glucose transporter protein in the placental basal membrane was reduced. Conclusion/Significance Our results support that preferential anaerobic consumption of glucose by the placenta at high altitude spares oxygen for fetal use, but limits glucose availability for fetal growth. Thus reduced fetal growth at high altitude is associated with fetal hypoglycemia, hypoinsulinemia and a trend towards lactacidemia. Our data support that placentally-mediated reduction in glucose transport is an initiating factor for reduced fetal growth under conditions of chronic hypoxemia."

Here, we report the crystal structures of the N-terminal bromodomain of human BRD2 (BRD2-BD1; residues 74–194) in complex with each of three different Lys-12-acetylated H4 peptides. The BRD2-BD1 recognizes the H4 tail acetylated at Lys-12 (H4K12ac), whereas the side chain of hypoacetylated Lys-8 of H4 binds at the cavity of the dimer interface of BRD2-BD1. From binding studies, we identified the BRD2-BD1 residues that are responsible for recognition of the Lys-12-acetylated H4 tail. In addition, mutation to Lys-8 in the Lys-12-acetylated H4 tail decreased the binding to BRD2-BD1, implicating the critical role of Lys-8 in the Lys-12-acetylated H4 tail for the recognition by BRD2-BD1. Our findings provide a structural basis for deciphering the histone code by the BET bromodomain through the binding with a long segment of the histone H4 tail, which presumably prevents erasure of the histone code during the cell cycle.

https://openalex.org/W1980903620,"Background A greater reduction in cardiovascular risk and vascular protection associated with diet rich in polyphenols are generally accepted; however, the molecular targets for polyphenols effects remain unknown. Meanwhile evidences in the literature have enlightened, not only structural similarities between estrogens and polyphenols known as phytoestrogens, but also in their vascular effects. We hypothesized that alpha isoform of estrogen receptor (ERα) could be involved in the transduction of the vascular benefits of polyphenols. Methodology/Principal Findings Here, we used ERα deficient mice to show that endothelium-dependent vasorelaxation induced either by red wine polyphenol extract, Provinols™, or delphinidin, an anthocyanin that possesses similar pharmacological profile, is mediated by ERα. Indeed, Provinols™, delphinidin and ERα agonists, 17-beta-estradiol and PPT, are able to induce endothelial vasodilatation in aorta from ERα Wild-Type but not from Knock-Out mice, by activation of nitric oxide (NO) pathway in endothelial cells. Besides, silencing the effects of ERα completely prevented the effects of Provinols™ and delphinidin to activate NO pathway (Src, ERK 1/2, eNOS, caveolin-1) leading to NO production. Furthermore, direct interaction between delphinidin and ERα activator site is demonstrated using both binding assay and docking. Most interestingly, the ability of short term oral administration of Provinols™ to decrease response to serotonin and to enhance sensitivity of the endothelium-dependent relaxation to acetylcholine, associated with concomitant increased NO production and decreased superoxide anions, was completely blunted in ERα deficient mice. Conclusions/Significance This study provides evidence that red wine polyphenols, especially delphinidin, exert their endothelial benefits via ERα activation. It is a major breakthrough bringing new insights of the potential therapeutic of polyphenols against cardiovascular pathologies."

Angiogenesis is a physiological process that encompasses the growth of capillary blood vessels, and the disturbance of angiogenesis contributes to the pathogenesis of numerous disorders, including cancer (1.Carmeliet P. Nature. 2005; 438: 932-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (2840) Google Scholar). Indeed, different types of antiangiogenic agents targeting endothelial cells have been developed as anticancer treatments (2.Folkman J. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2007; 6: 273-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (1900) Google Scholar). Pathological angiogenesis is predominantly driven by vascular endothelial growth factor, a proangiogenic growth factor expressed by many solid tumors (3.Ferrara N. Hillan K.J. Gerber H.P. Novotny W.

For integrin activation, a mechanosensory complex composed of PECAM, VE-cadherin, and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 causes the initial response (5.Tzima E. Irani-Tehrani M.

PECAM was originally identified as a major endothelial cell adhesion molecule, but it has recently been recognized to play important roles in controlling the activation and survival of endothelial cells (6.Newman P.J. Newman D.K. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2003; 23: 953-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). PECAM is considered to be an inhibitory receptor, and its cytoplasmic region possesses an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif that becomes tyrosine-phosphorylated and subsequently recruits and activates Src homology 2 domain-containing protein-tyrosine phosphatase 2 (SHP2) for the transduction of inhibitory signals to the cell (7.Newman P.J.

Protein concentrations were determined with BCA protein assay reagents (Pierce). For detection of proteins after SDS-PAGE, 2D-Silver Stain-II (Cosmo Bio) was used. All animal experiments were performed in compliance with the Institutional Guidelines for Animal Experiments of RIKEN. Fc-tagged PECAM (Fc-PECAM) was generated by inserting mouse PECAM amino acids 1–590 into the EcoRV and SpeI sites of pEF encoding the hinge and constant region (Fc) of human IgG1 in-frame. Fc-tagged mPECAMR90A was generated using a QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). A ViraPower adenoviral expression system (Invitrogen) was used to produce recombinant adenoviruses carrying rat ST6Gal I or control LacZ according to the manufacturer's protocol. To achieve this, a rat ST6Gal I-FLAG pcDNA was subcloned into the pENTR TOPO vector (Invitrogen). The ST6Gal I entry clone vector was used in LR clonase recombination reactions (Invitrogen) with the Gateway adenoviral backbone vector pAd/CMV/V5-DEST (Invitrogen). Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs; Takara) were cultured in EBM-2 (Takara) containing 2% fetal bovine serum and EGMTM-2 SingleQuots (Takara) and used within four passages. Viral titers were determined using an Adeno-XTM rapid titer kit (Clontech). Primary liver sinusoidal endothelial cells were prepared from the livers of wild-type and ST6Gal I-deficient mice using CD146 MicroBeads (Miltenyi Biotec), according to the manufacturer's protocol, cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 50 μg/ml endothelial mitogen (Biomedical Technologies Inc.), and used within three passages. Mouse endothelial cells or HUVECs were grown on type I collagen-coated chamber slides (Iwaki). After fixation with 4% paraformaldehyde, treatment with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 15 min, and blocking with 5% goat serum in PBS, the cells were incubated with anti-PECAM (MEC13.3; 1:100 dilution; BD Biosciences) and anti-adaptin γ (1:100 dilution; BD Transduction Laboratories) or anti-EEA-1 (1:100 dilution; BD Transduction Laboratories) antibodies or an anti-lysobisphosphatidic acid antibody. The cells were then incubated with Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated anti-rat IgG (1:100 dilution; Invitrogen) and Alexa Fluor 546-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (1:100 dilution; Invitrogen), respectively. For the HUVECs, an anti-human PECAM antibody (H-300; 1:100 dilution; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and Sambucus sieboldiana agglutinin (SSA)-biotin (1:100 dilution; Honen Co.) were used, followed by Alexa Fluor 546-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (1:100 dilution; Invitrogen) and Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated streptavidin (1:100 dilution; Invitrogen). After washing with PBS, the samples were mounted in ProLong Gold antifade reagent containing 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Invitrogen) and observed using an FV1000-D laser scanning confocal microscope (Olympus). To prepare brain sections, mice were perfused transcardially with 0.1 m phosphate-buffered 4% paraformaldehyde, sequentially immersed in the same fixative for 16 h, phosphate-buffered 20% sucrose for 6 h, and phosphate-buffered 40% sucrose for 16 h at 4 °C, and then frozen. Sections (10-μm thickness) were mounted on aminopropyltriethoxysilane-coated glass slides and air-dried for 15 min. For TJA-I lectin staining, we performed fluorescence-indirect tyramide signal amplification. Briefly, brain sections were incubated with 0.3% hydrogen peroxidase in methanol, treated with the blocking solutions supplied in a tyramide signal amplification kit (TSA Biotin System; PerkinElmer Life Sciences), and then incubated with anti-PECAM antibodies MEC13.3 (BD Biosciences) or M-20 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) diluted 1:500 in TBS (0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.15 m NaCl) overnight at 4 °C. After three rinses with TNT buffer (TBS containing 0.05% Tween 20) for 5 min each, the sections were incubated with biotinylated TJA-I lectin (1:1000 dilution; Honen Co.) plus Alexa Fluor 546-conjugated goat anti-rat IgG (1:100 dilution; Molecular Probes) for 45 min. After three rinses with TNT buffer, tyramide-enhanced immunoreactivity was visualized with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin (1:100 dilution; Invitrogen) for 45 min and Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated tyramide (1:10 dilution; Molecular Probes) for 10 min. When we performed single staining for TJA-I lectin or PECAM, each staining pattern was identical to that obtained in the double staining. To detect ST6Gal I, we performed the tyramide signal amplification method using an anti-ST6Gal I antibody (1:100 dilution; IBL-Japan Co.) and biotinylated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:100 dilution; GE Healthcare). Total RNA was isolated from mouse lung tissues using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen), and 5–10 μg of the RNA was reverse-transcribed with random hexamers using a SuperScript II reverse transcription kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Amplifications of the cDNA and the PCR conditions were described previously (16.Sugimoto I. Futakawa S. Oka R. Ogawa K. Marth J.D. Miyoshi E. Taniguchi N. Hashimoto Y. Kitazume S. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 34896-34903Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The probes for PECAM were labeled with the fluorescent reporter dye FAMTM. The probes for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) were labeled with VICTM at their 5′ ends and the quencher dye TAMRATM at their 3′ ends. The expression levels of the target gene were measured in duplicate and normalized by the corresponding GAPDH expression levels. Lung tissues from mice and HUVEC lysates were homogenized in T-PER Tissue Protein Extraction Reagent (Pierce) containing a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). The lung homogenates (10 μg of protein), HUVEC lysates (10 μg of protein), or immunoprecipitated samples were separated by SDS-PAGE using 4–20% gradient gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were incubated with an anti-PECAM antibody (M-20; 1:2000 dilution; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (6E10; 1:1000 dilution; Roche Applied Science). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-goat and anti-mouse IgG (1:1000 dilution; Jackson ImmunoResearch) were used as the secondary antibodies and a SuperSignal chemiluminescent substrate (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.) was used for detection. As a loading control, we detected GAPDH on the same membranes using an anti-GAPDH antibody (1:1000 dilution; Chemicon) and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (1:1000 dilution; Amersham Biosciences). The detected bands for PECAM and GAPDH were quantified using a Luminoimage Analyzer LAS-1000 PLUS (Fuji Film). Liver sinusoidal endothelial cells grown on 60-mm culture plates were labeled with Sulfo-NHS-LC-Biotin (Pierce; 1 ml/ml ice-cold PBS, pH 8.0) for 30 min at 4 °C. After three washes with 0.1 m glycine in PBS, pH 8.0, and one wash with PBS, culture medium was added to the plates, and the cells were cultured for defined periods of time (0, 3, 6, 12, and 24 h). Transfection of endothelial cells was achieved by infection with adenovirus preparations for ST6Gal I or LacZ using equivalent plaque-forming units/cell. 48 h after infection, the cells were detached with 20 mm EDTA in PBS and resuspended as single cell suspensions in FACS buffer (PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin and 0.05% sodium azide). The cells (5 × 105) were incubated with SSA-fluorescein isothiocyanate (10 μg/ml) or an anti-PECAM-PE antibody (5 μg/ml; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 30 min on ice, washed three times, and suspended in FACS buffer. Flow cytometry data were acquired using an EPICS XL cytometer (Beckman Coulter) and analyzed using the Expo32 software (Beckman Coulter). Lung lysates were prepared from wild-type and ST6Gal I-deficient mice. To release the PECAM complexes, the lysates were boiled in the presence of 0.5% SDS and then diluted to 0.1% SDS before immunoprecipitation. The lysates (1 mg/ml) were precleared with protein G-agarose for 30 min. After centrifugation to remove insoluble material, the supernatants (100 μl) were incubated with 2.5 μg of an anti-PECAM antibody (M-20) or 30 μl of SSA-agarose (Honen Co.) for 16 h. For PECAM precipitation, 30 μl of protein G-Sepharose was added. The precipitates were washed four times, separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and probed with an anti-PECAM antibody (M-20). Fc-PECAM or Fc-PECAMR90A protein was purified from culture media obtained from COS cells transiently expressing the protein. Fc-PECAM (200 ng) absorbed onto 15 μl of protein A-Sepharose was incubated with His-tagged PECAM (PECAM-His, 1 μg; R&D Systems) in the presence or absence of 2 milliunits of Vibrio cholerae sialidase (Nacalai Tesque) in PBS for 1 h. Alternatively, Fc-PECAM that was incubated with sialidase for 1 h was washed to remove sialidase and then incubated with PECAM-His in PBS for another 1 h. The reaction mixtures were analyzed by Western blotting with an anti-PECAM antibody (M-185; Santa Cruz Biotechnology). After the incubation, the proteins absorbed on the Sepharose beads were analyzed by Western blotting with an anti-His6 antibody (Roche Applied Science) for His-tagged PECAM or an anti-human IgG antibody (Southern Biotech) for Fc-PECAM. Confluent mouse endothelial cells grown on 24-well plates were treated with 0.5 μm staurosporine to induce apoptosis (10.Gao C. Sun W. Christofidou-Solomidou M. Sawada M. Newman D.K. Bergom C. Albelda S.M. Matsuyama S. Newman P.J. Blood. 2003; 102: 169-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). At 0, 2, 4, and 8 h after the addition of staurosporine, the cells were measured for their caspase-3/-7 activities using a Caspase-Glo 3/7 assay kit (Promega). Briefly, a luminogenic substrate containing an Asp-Glu-Val-Asp sequence was added and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h, followed by analysis using a multiwell luminometer. Based on previous reports that endothelial cells express significant levels of α2,6-linked sialic acid, which are increased by inflammatory cytokines (15.Hanasaki K. Varki A. Stamenkovic I. Bevilacqua M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10637-10643Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17.Hanasaki K. Varki A. Powell L.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7533-7542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), we tried to elucidate a role for α2,6-linked sialic acid in endothelial functions. First, we performed immunohistochemical analyses of brain sections from wild-type and ST6Gal I-deficient mice using an anti-ST6Gal I antibody or TJA-I lectin that recognizes Siaα2,6Galβ1,4GlcNAc residues. In the brain sections from wild-type mice, blood vessels were exclusively detected by TJA-I lectin, because all of the TJA-I positive signals were perfectly matched with those of PECAM as an endothelial marker (Fig. 1A). The specificity of the TJA-I staining was confirmed by the fact that this staining was totally abolished in the brain sections from ST6Gal I-deficient mice (Fig. 1B). Furthermore, we found that ST6Gal I itself was exclusively detected in the blood vessels. Our findings that ST6Gal I products were not present in the brain parenchyma are consistent with a previous report that brain N-glycans predominantly carry α2,3-linked sialic acid, with little or no α2,6-linked sialic acid (18.Kleene R. Schachner M. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2004; 5: 195-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). Even though ST6Gal I-deficient mice grow normally and exhibit no tissue abnormalities (19.Hennet T. Chui D. Paulson J.C. Marth J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1998; 95: 4504-4509Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar), immunostaining of PECAM was also abolished in the brain sections from ST6Gal I-deficient mice (Fig. 1B). We confirmed that PECAM itself contained α2,6-linked sialic acid residues added by ST6Gal I, because agarose coupled with the Siaα2,6-Gal-binding SSA lectin pulled down almost all of the PECAM in tissue lysates from wild-type mice but was unable to pull down PECAM in tissue lysates from ST6Gal I-deficient mice (Fig. 1C), in which PECAM was modified with other types of sialic acids (supplemental Fig. S1). Because the glycosylation-independent anti-PECAM antibody raised against a peptide at the C terminus of PECAM did not stain the brain sections from ST6Gal I-deficient mice (supplemental Fig. S2), defective PECAM glycosylation was not related to this result. On the contrary, the levels of PECAM mRNA were almost the same in the two types of mice (Fig. 1D). Furthermore, Western blot analyses of tissue lysates from ST6Gal I-deficient mice revealed that the total level of PECAM was reduced to only about 70% of the normal level in the lung (Fig. 1E). N-Glycan chain multivalency has been proven to enhance the cell-surface residency of growth-modulating receptors (20.Lau K.S. Partridge E.A. Grigorian A. Silvescu C.I. Reinhold V.N. Demetriou M. Dennis J.W. Cell. 2007; 129: 123-134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined whether ST6Gal I overexpression in endothelial cells could enhance the level of cell-surface PECAM. Overexpression of ST6Gal I in HUVECs using an adenovirus method for gene delivery resulted in an ∼40% increase in cell-surface α2,6-linked sialic acid compared with the control LacZ vector (Fig. 2A). Even though the total PECAM level was not affected by this ST6Gal I overexpression (Fig. 2B), the cell-surface PECAM was increased to ∼140% in response to the increased cell-surface α2,6-linked sialic acid (Fig. 2, A and C). In addition, PECAM immunoreactivity was detected in tissue sections from ST6Gal I-deficient mice after autoclave treatment for antigen retrieval (supplemental Fig. S2). Because the level of cell-surface VE-cadherin, which contains α2,6-linked sialic acid (21.Geyer H. Geyer R. Odenthal-Schnittler M. Schnittler H.J. Glycobiology. 1999; 9: 915-925Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), was not affected by ST6Gal I overexpression (Fig. 2C), there appeared to be selectivity for the correlation between ST6Gal I expression and the cell-surface residency of membrane glycoproteins. To explore the intracellular behavior of endothelial PECAM, we isolated liver sinusoidal endothelial cells from the livers of wild-type and ST6Gal I-deficient mice using an established method (supplemental Fig. S3). Immunostaining analyses revealed that PECAM was localized at the cell borders in the endothelial cells from wild-type mice (Fig. 3A, left panels). In the ST6Gal I-deficient cells, however, this junctional PECAM localization was absent and instead an increased level of intracellular PECAM was colocalized with the early endosome marker EEA-1 (Fig. 3A, right panels) and the late endosome marker lysobisphosphatidic acid (supplemental Fig. S4). These results indicate that more PECAM was endocytosed under ST6Gal I deficiency. After overexpression of ST6Gal I in ST6Gal I-deficient cells, the intracellular PECAM was returned to the cell borders (Fig. 3B). Based on these results, we suspected that the cell-surface half-life of PECAM was decreased, similar to the case for other N-glycan mutations in which the cell-surface expressions of growth factor receptors and glucose transporters are greatly diminished under highly branching GlcNAcT glycosyltransferase deficiency (22.Partridge E.A.

Minowa M.T. Yoshida A. Takeuchi M. Marth J.D. Cell. 2005; 123: 1307-1321Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). The kinetics of the cell-surface retention of PECAM revealed that the PECAM half-life at the cell surface was decreased by 2-fold in the absence of ST6Gal I (Fig. 3C).FIGURE 3Altered PECAM expression in ST6Gal I-deficient endothelial cells.A, primary liver sinusoidal endothelial cells were prepared from wild-type (WT) and ST6Gal I-deficient (KO) mice, fixed, and stained with an anti-PECAM antibody (green) and antibodies against a trans-Golgi marker (γ-adaptin; red) or an early endosome marker (EEA-1; red). Scale bar, 20 μm. B, primary liver sinusoidal endothelial cells from ST6Gal I-deficient mice were infected with adenovirus preparations for ST6Gal I (ST-Ad) or LacZ (LacZ-Ad) using 50 plaque-forming units/cell. 48 h after infection, the cells were fixed and stained with SSA lectin (green), an anti-PECAM antibody (MEC13.3, red), and 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) (blue). Scale bar, 20 μm. C, half-lives of PECAM cell-surface expression on endothelial cells from wild-type and ST6Gal I-deficient mice were determined after cell-surface biotinylation and incubation for 3, 6, 12, and 24 h. Data are presented as the means ± S.E. from three separate experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Even though the precise mechanism by which PECAM transduces inhibitory signals to the cell remains to be determined, an important step appears to be the tyrosine phosphorylation within the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif of PECAM, which leads to SHP2 recruitment and translocation to cell junctions (7.Newman P.J. Berndt M.C. Gorski J. White 2nd, G.C. Lyman S. Paddock C. Muller W.A. Science. 1990; 247: 1219-1222Crossref PubMed Scopus (829) Google Scholar, 10.Gao C. Sun W. Christofidou-Solomidou M. Sawada M.

Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 773-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). In ST6Gal I-deficient mice, the level of tyrosine phosphorylation of PECAM was significantly decreased (Fig. 4A) and fewer PECAM·SHP2 complexes were detected (Fig. 4B), implying that ST6Gal I-dependent cell-surface PECAM localization is required for the formation of PECAM·SHP2 complexes to confer cell signaling to endothelial cells. Indeed, the level of phosphotyrosine in the endothelial cells from ST6Gal I-deficient mice was significantly higher than that in the corresponding cells from wild-type mice (Fig. 4C). Even though PECAM is regarded as a multifunctional molecule (6.Newman P.J. Newman D.K. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2003; 23: 953-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar, 25.Woodfin A. Voisin M.B. Nourshargh S. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2007; 27: 2514-2523Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar), several reports have highlighted that PECAM functions as an inhibitor of mitochondrion-dependent apoptosis (8.Bird I.N. Taylor V. Newton J.P. Spragg J.H. Simmons D.L. Salmon M. Buckley C.D. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 1989-1997PubMed Google Scholar, 9.Noble K.E. Wickremasinghe R.G. DeCornet C. Panayiotidis P. Yong K.L. J.

Blood. 2003; 102: 169-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). We therefore speculated that ST6Gal I deficiency would increase the sensitivity of endothelial cells to mitochondrion-dependent apoptotic stimuli, because of the lack of functional PECAM. To directly examine whether ST6Gal I-deficient endothelial cells were more sensitive to apoptotic stimuli, we treated endothelial cells from wild-type and ST6Gal I-deficient mice with staurosporine, a trigger for mitochondrion-dependent apoptosis. The ST6Gal-deficient endothelial cells were indeed more sensitive to staurosporine treatment than the wild-type endothelial cells (Fig. 4D). Given that cell-surface retention of PECAM is greatly decreased by ST6Gal I deficiency, it is possible that an α2,6-linked sialic acid-binding protein exists at the cell surface. It is generally accepted that the cell-surface residency of glycoproteins is partly supported by galectin, a galactose-binding protein (20.Lau K.S. Partridge E.A. Grigorian A. Silvescu C.I. Reinhold V.N. Demetriou M. Dennis J.W. Cell. 2007; 129: 123-134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, recognition of N-glycans by galectin was found to be disrupted by modification of N-glycans by ST6Gal I (26.Amano M. Galvan M. He J. Baum L.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7469-7475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 27.Cha S.K. Ortega B. Kurosu H. Rosenblatt K.P. Kuro-O M. Huang C.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

A well known α2,6-linked sialic acid-recognizing Ig superfamily member, CD22, is restricted to the B-cell lineage (29.Powell L.D. Sgroi D. Sjoberg E.R. Stamenkovic I. Varki A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7019-7027Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30.Poe J.C. Fujimoto Y. Hasegawa M. Haas K.M. Miller A.S. Sanford I.G. Bock C.B. Fujimoto M. Tedder T.F. Nat.

Because accumulating data support the idea that PECAM homophilic interactions are requisite for its proper functions (8.Bird I.N. Taylor V. Newton J.P. Spragg J.H. Simmons D.L. Salmon M. Buckley C.D. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 1989-1997PubMed Google Scholar, 33.Newton J.P. Buckley C.D. Jones E.Y. Simmons D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20555-20563Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), we speculated that sialic acids would mediate homophilic PECAM interactions. Consequently, we performed in vitro assays using Fc-tagged PECAM (PECAM-Fc) and His-tagged PECAM (PECAM-His). Fc-PECAM immobilized onto protein A-Sepharose was able to pull down PECAM-His, and this interaction was abolished by sialidase treatment of either or both PECAM-Fc and PECAM-His, or only PECAM-Fc (Fig. 5, A and B), thereby providing direct evidence of sialic acid-dependent homophilic PECAM interactions. Because a conserved Arg in the N-terminal Ig domain is essential in sialic acid recognition by Siglec (34.Crocker P.R. Varki A. Trends Immunol. 2001; 22: 337-342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar), we constructed the PECAM mutant, PECAMR90A, in which highly conserved Arg-90 in the first Ig domain was replaced with Ala. Homophilic interaction of PECAM was markedly lost in the PECAMR90A-Fc mutant (Fig. 5C), indicating that Arg-90 is an interaction site on PECAM. When we stained HUVECs with SSA lectin and an anti-PECAM antibody, both the SSA epitopes and PECAM were more concentrated at cell-cell junctions than in the peripheral regions (Fig. 5, D and E), further suggesting a role for α2,6-sialic acid in the PECAM interactions. Based on our present findings, a model for sialic acid-dependent homophilic PECAM interactions was developed (Fig. 6). PECAM with normal sialic acids mediates homophilic interactions at the cell surface to recruit SHP2 phosphatase to transduce inhibitory signals, such as antiapoptotic signals, to the cell. Under ST6Gal I deficiency, PECAM fails to mediate homophilic interactions, thus leading to an inability to transduce signals to the cell. As an underlying mechanism of the sialic acid-based homophilic PECAM interactions, we speculated that PECAM itself would be an α2,6-linked sialic acid-binding protein because PECAM also belongs to the Ig superfamily that includes a subfamily of sialic acid-binding Ig-like lectins (Siglecs). Even though PECAM is not likely to possess an N-terminal V-set Ig domain that plays a role in sialic acid binding in Siglec (34.Crocker P.R. Varki A. Trends Immunol. 2001; 22: 337-342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar), replacement of conserved Arg-90 in the first Ig domain of PECAM with Ala greatly reduced the homophilic binding activity, indicating that Arg-90 is an interaction site of PECAM. A detailed molecular structural study to elucidate how and which part of PECAM exhibits its sialic acid-binding activity is a challenging issue for the future. Endothelial cells from ST6Gal I-deficient mice show an overlapping phenotype with the corresponding cells from PECAM-deficient mice, in terms of their increased sensitivity to mitochondrion-dependent apoptotic stimuli (8.Bird I.N. Taylor V. Newton J.P. Spragg J.H. Simmons D.L. Salmon M. Buckley C.D. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 1989-1997PubMed Google Scholar, 9.Noble K.E. Wickremasinghe R.G. DeCornet C. Panayiotidis P. Yong K.L. J.

Blood. 2003; 102: 169-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Interestingly, stressed conditions enhance the endothelial cell-surface expression of PECAM without changing the level of PECAM mRNA, thereby leading to enhanced cell survival signals (12.Limaye V. Li X. Hahn C. Xia P. Berndt M.C. Vadas M.A. Gamble J.R. Blood. 2005; 105: 3169-3177Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Glycan modification of PECAM may be responsible for regulating various pathological situations. Nevertheless, because ST6Gal I acts on various endothelial glycoproteins, the identification of key molecules other than PECAM whose functions are regulated by ST6Gal I remains one of our ongoing projects. Finally, our findings that ST6Gal I-deficient endothelial cells exhibit increased sensitivity to apoptotic signals provide new possibilities for the development of glycan-targeted antiangiogenesis strategies.

https://openalex.org/W2114192621,"The KCNE3 beta-subunit constitutively opens outwardly rectifying KCNQ1 (Kv7.1) K(+) channels by abolishing their voltage-dependent gating. The resulting KCNQ1/KCNE3 heteromers display enhanced sensitivity to K(+) channel inhibitors like chromanol 293B. KCNE3 was also suggested to modify biophysical properties of several other K(+) channels, and a mutation in KCNE3 was proposed to underlie forms of human periodic paralysis. To investigate physiological roles of KCNE3, we now disrupted its gene in mice. kcne3(-/-) mice were viable and fertile and displayed neither periodic paralysis nor other obvious skeletal muscle abnormalities. KCNQ1/KCNE3 heteromers are present in basolateral membranes of intestinal and tracheal epithelial cells where they might facilitate transepithelial Cl(-) secretion through basolateral recycling of K(+) ions and by increasing the electrochemical driving force for apical Cl(-) exit. Indeed, cAMP-stimulated electrogenic Cl(-) secretion across tracheal and intestinal epithelia was drastically reduced in kcne3(-/-) mice. Because the abundance and subcellular localization of KCNQ1 was unchanged in kcne3(-/-) mice, the modification of biophysical properties of KCNQ1 by KCNE3 is essential for its role in intestinal and tracheal transport. Further, these results suggest KCNE3 as a potential modifier gene in cystic fibrosis."
https://openalex.org/W2126833846,"The Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome (HPS) is a genetic hypopigmentation and bleeding disorder caused by defective biogenesis of lysosome-related organelles (LROs) such as melanosomes and platelet dense bodies. HPS arises from mutations in any of 8 genes in humans and 16 genes in mice. Two of these genes, HPS1 and HPS4, encode components of the biogenesis of lysosome-related organelles complex-3 (BLOC-3). Herein we show that recombinant HPS1-HPS4 produced in insect cells can be efficiently isolated as a 1:1 heterodimer. Analytical ultracentrifugation reveals that this complex has a molecular mass of 146 kDa, equivalent to that of the native complex and to the sum of the predicted molecular masses of HPS1 and HPS4. This indicates that HPS1 and HPS4 interact directly in the absence of any other protein as part of BLOC-3. Limited proteolysis and deletion analyses show that both subunits interact with one another throughout most of their lengths with the sole exception of a long, unstructured loop in the central part of HPS4. An interaction screen reveals a specific and strong interaction of BLOC-3 with the GTP-bound form of the endosomal GTPase, Rab9. This interaction is mediated by HPS4 and the switch I and II regions of Rab9. These characteristics indicate that BLOC-3 might function as a Rab9 effector in the biogenesis of LROs.

These symptoms result from respective defects in melanosomes and platelet dense bodies, which are members of the diverse family of “lysosome-related organelles” (LROs) (2.Huizing M. Helip-Wooley A.

Some HPS patients present additional symptoms, including pulmonary fibrosis and granulomatous colitis, which probably result from dysfunction of other LROs (2.Huizing M. Helip-Wooley A. Westbroek W.

Genetic studies have shown that HPS is caused by mutations in any of 8 genes in humans and 16 genes in mouse (2.Huizing M. Helip-Wooley A. Westbroek W. Gunay-Aygun M. Gahl W.A. Annu. Rev.

Some of these HPS genes encode subunits of well-characterized cytosolic complexes (e.g. AP-3, HOPS) that participate in vesicular transport steps in the endosomal-lysosomal system (7.Dell'Angelica E.C. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2004; 16: 458-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Other HPS genes, however, encode novel proteins of unknown structure and function (7.Dell'Angelica E.C. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2004; 16: 458-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Biochemical analyses have shown that a subset of these proteins are components of three additional cytosolic complexes named biogenesis of lysosome-related organelles complex-1, -2, and -3 (BLOC-1, -2, and -3) (7.Dell'Angelica E.C. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2004; 16: 458-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Like AP-3 and HOPS, the BLOCs are expected to mediate vesicular transport events in the biogenesis of LROs.

This is particularly the case in Puerto Rico, where a founder effect makes HPS1 the most common single gene inherited disorder in the general population (2.Huizing M. Helip-Wooley A. Westbroek W.

HPS1 and HPS4 are the only types of HPS that present with lung fibrosis, a symptom that often leads to mortality in the fourth or fifth decade of life (2.Huizing M. Helip-Wooley A. Westbroek W.

Although the most visible manifestations of HPS1 or HPS4 deficiency derive from LRO defects, both proteins are expressed in all cell types, including those that normally lack LROs (11.Oh J. Bailin T.

Human HPS1 has 700 amino acids and a predicted molecular mass of 79 kDa (11.Oh J. Bailin T. Fukai K. Feng G.H. Ho L. Mao J.I. Frenk E. Tamura N. Spritz R.A. Nat. Genet. 1996; 14: 300-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar), whereas human HPS4 has 708 amino acids and a predicted molecular mass of 77 kDa (14.Suzuki T. Li W. Zhang Q. Karim A. Novak E.K. Sviderskaya E.V. Hill S.P. Bennett D.C. Levin A.V. Nieuwenhuis H.K. Fong C.T. Castellan C. Miterski B. Swank R.T. Spritz R.A. Nat. Genet. 2002; 30: 321-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Their similar sizes notwithstanding, HPS1 and HPS4 exhibit no significant sequence homology to each other (18% overall identity with 39.5% gaps, according to the EMBOSS Needle program). Recent bioinformatics analyses have suggested that the N-terminal ∼200 amino acids of both proteins might encompass a CHiPS (15.Hoffman-Sommer M. Grynberg M. Kucharczyk R. Rytka J. Traffic. 2005; 6: 534-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) or longin (16.Kinch L.N. Grishin N.V. Protein Sci. 2006; 15: 2669-2674Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) domain, but this finding remains to be verified experimentally. The biochemical evidence that HPS1 and HPS4 are part of BLOC-3 comes mainly from experiments involving co-immunoprecipitation from whole cell extracts (8.Chiang P.W. Oiso N. Gautam R. Suzuki T.

U.S.A. 2003; 100: 8770-8775Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). In addition, combined sedimentation velocity and gel filtration analyses of whole cell extracts showed that both proteins migrate together as part of a 140–175-kDa species (9.Martina J.A. Moriyama K. Bonifacino J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 29376-29384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 10.Nazarian R. Falcón-Pérez J.M. Dell'Angelica E.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Metab. 2008; 93: 134-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), roughly equivalent to the sum of the HPS1 and HPS4 molecular masses. However, only a small fraction of epitope-tagged forms of HPS1 and HPS4 expressed by transfection into cells occur as a complex, the rest remaining as unassembled proteins (9.Martina J.A. Moriyama K. Bonifacino J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 29376-29384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Moreover, yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) assays failed to show interaction of HPS1 with HPS4 (8.Chiang P.W. Oiso N. Gautam R. Suzuki T. Swank R.T. Spritz R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 20332-20337Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 9.Martina J.A. Moriyama K. Bonifacino J.S. J. Biol.

U.S.A. 2003; 100: 8770-8775Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). These observations led to speculation that an additional small subunit might be required for assembly of these proteins. Adding to the uncertainty as to the oligomerization state of these proteins, Y2H assays showed an interaction of HPS4 with itself (8.Chiang P.W. Oiso N. Gautam R. Suzuki T. Swank R.T. Spritz R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 20332-20337Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), suggesting that BLOC-3 could have more than copy of this protein. Finally, additional species of ∼200 kDa containing only HPS1 and ∼500 kDa containing both HPS1 and HPS4 were also detected in gel filtration analyses (8.Chiang P.W. Oiso N. Gautam R. Suzuki T. Swank R.T. Spritz R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 20332-20337Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 18.Oh J. Liu Z.X. Feng G.H. Raposo G. Spritz R.A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 375-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). To date, no other proteins have been found to interact with HPS1 and HPS4 (6.Li W. Feng Y. Hao C. Guo X. Cui Y. He M. He X. J. Genet. Genomics. 2007; 34: 669-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Thus, the exact composition of BLOC-3 and its connection to other cellular components remain to be established. To determine the composition and properties of BLOC-3, we produced the recombinant complex by co-expression of human HPS1 and HPS4 in insect cells using a baculovirus system. We found that this complex can be efficiently isolated as a monodisperse assembly of HPS1 and HPS4 in the absence of any other protein. Analytical ultracentrifugation analyses showed that this recombinant complex has a molecular mass of 146 ± 5 kDa, similar to that of the native complex (9.Martina J.A. Moriyama K. Bonifacino J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 29376-29384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 10.Nazarian R. Falcón-Pérez J.M. Dell'Angelica E.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 8770-8775Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 17.Nazarian R. Huizing M. Helip-Wooley A. Starcevic M. Gahl W.A. Dell'Angelica E.C. Mol. Genet. Metab. 2008; 93: 134-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). This size is consistent with BLOC-3 being a 1:1 heterodimer of HPS1 and HPS4. Deletion analyses showed that assembly involves the entire HPS1 and HPS4 sequences, with the sole exception of a long central loop in HPS4. Both subunits are thus intimately connected with one another throughout most of their length. An interaction screen revealed that both the recombinant and native BLOC-3 specifically interact with the GTP-bound form of Rab9, a small GTPase localized to endosomes (19.Lombardi D. Soldati T. Riederer M.A. Goda Y. Zerial M. Pfeffer S.R. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 677-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). These observations raise the possibility that BLOC-3 could function as a Rab9 effector. For expression of BLOC-3 using the baculovirus system, the genes for full-length human HPS4 carrying an N-terminal GST tag followed by a TEV site and untagged human HPS1 were ligated into the PH and p10 cassettes of pFastBacDual (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), respectively. Recombinant baculovirus was generated using Escherichia coli DH10multibac cells, which contain a viral genome lacking chitinase and cathepsin genes for increased expression (20.Berger I. Fitzgerald D.J. Richmond T.J. Nat. Biotechnol. 2004; 22: 1583-1587Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). Subsequent steps of baculovirus amplification were performed following the procedure in the Bac-to-Bac system manual (Invitrogen). For protein production, Sf9 cells in Sf-900 III serum-free medium (Invitrogen) were infected at a density of 2 × 106 cells/ml and incubated for 72 h at 27 °C before harvesting. Cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline containing 5 mm benzamidine and frozen at −80 °C. The frozen cell pellets were lysed by resuspension in buffer A (50 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm TCEP, 5% (w/v) glycerol, and 1 mm EDTA pH 7.3) containing DNase I (Sigma) and protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma). After lysis, cell debris was removed by centrifugation (43,000 × g, 40 min) and the supernatant applied to glutathione-Sepharose 4B (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ) equilibrated in buffer A. After 2 h, the resin was washed twice in lysis buffer and twice in buffer B (50 mm HEPES, 250 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm TCEP, 0.6% (w/v) β-octylglucopyranoside (β-OG) pH 7.3). Bound proteins were eluted in buffer B containing 20 mm reduced glutathione. The GST tag was removed with TEV protease and BLOC-3 purified further by gel filtration on a Superose 6 column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated in buffer B. BLOC3(ΔHPS4275–533) was produced by replacing residues 269–275 and 528–534 of HPS4 with TEV recognition sites using site-directed mutagenesis, allowing residues 275–533 of HPS4 to be removed together with the N-terminal GST tag during TEV cleavage. For E. coli expression of truncated forms of HPS4, the corresponding DNA fragments were ligated into pGST2 (21.Sheffield P. Garrard S. Derewenda Z. Protein Expr. Purif. 1999; 15: 34-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar) and transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3). Cells were grown at 20 °C in ZYM-5052 autoinduction medium (22.Studier F.W. Protein Expr. Purif. 2005; 41: 207-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (4050) Google Scholar) containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin and harvested by centrifugation when the culture reached saturation. Cell pellets were resuspended in buffer A, lysed using an Emulsiflex homogenizer (Avestin, Ottawa, Canada) and cleared by centrifugation (40 min, 43,000 × g). Soluble GST fusion proteins were purified further as described for the full-length complex. A rabbit polyclonal antibody to BLOC-3 was generated using the purified full-length recombinant complex for immunization (Covance, Denver, PA). The antibody was subsequently affinity purified using recombinant BLOC-3 immobilized on NHS-Sepharose (GE Healthcare) following the manufacturer's instructions. Sedimentation velocity experiments were conducted at 4.0 °C on a Beckman Optima XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge. 400 μl of a 2.7 μm solution of BLOC-3 in buffer B was loaded in a double sector centerpiece cell. 130 scans were acquired at 5-min intervals and rotor speeds of 50 krpm as single absorbance measurements at 280 nm using a radial spacing of 0.003 cm. Data were analyzed in SEDFIT version 11.8 (20.Berger I. Fitzgerald D.J. Richmond T.J. Nat. Biotechnol. 2004; 22: 1583-1587Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar) in terms of a continuous c(s) distribution. Solution densities ρ and viscosities η were calculated using the program SEDNTERP 1.2 (John Philo, Software Consultant, Thousand Oaks, CA) (23.Cole J.L. Lary J.W. Moody T.P. Laue T.M. Methods Cell Biol. 2008; 84: 143-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar), as were values for the partial specific volume v of the protein. c(s) analyses were carried out using an s20,w range of 2 to 12 with a linear resolution of 100 and a confidence level (F-ratio) of 0.68; excellent fits were observed with a root mean square deviation of 0.0037 absorbance units. Sedimentation coefficients were corrected to s20,w. The genes for human Rab4a, canine Rab5a, and human Rab27a were ligated into pGEX expression vectors (GE Healthcare) and human Rab7a and Rab9a (residues 1–177) into pGST2. GST-Rab fusion proteins were produced in E. coli BL21(DE3) cells in ZYM-5052 autoinduction medium at 20 °C as described above. Cells were lysed in buffer C (50 mm Tris, 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm TCEP pH 8.0) containing 50 μg/ml AEBSF. GST-Rab proteins were then purified by glutathione affinity chromatography and eluted in buffer C containing 20 mm reduced glutathione. Eluted proteins were subsequently purified by gel filtration on a Superdex 75 column (GE Healthcare). Fractions containing pure GST-Rab fusion protein were pooled, concentrated, supplemented with 10% (w/v) glycerol, and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen. Nucleotide exchange of wild-type GST-Rab fusion proteins was performed as described (24.Christoforidis S. Zerial M. Methods. 2000; 20: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Briefly, GST-Rabs were first immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose 4B resin and washed with NS buffer (20 mm HEPES, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), pH 7.2). The bound nucleotide was exchanged by washing the resin in NE buffer (20 mm HEPES, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT pH 7.2) containing 20 μm of either GDP, GMP-PNP, GTPγS, or GTP followed by a 30-min incubation in the same buffer containing 1 mm nucleotide. After repeating the exchange procedure, bound nucleotide was stabilized by washing the resin in NS buffer containing 20 μm nucleotide followed by a 30-min incubation with 1 mm nucleotide. All exchange steps were carried out at room temperature. For GST pulldown experiments with recombinant BLOC-3, 50 pmol of GST-Rab fusion protein was immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose 4B and washed in NS buffer containing 0.5% β-OG (assay buffer) and 1 mm GDP, GMP-PNP, or GTPγS. Recombinant BLOC-3 was added, and the volume adjusted to 500 μl with assay buffer. After incubation for 2 h at 4 °C, the resin was washed four times with 500 μl of assay buffer. Bound proteins were eluted with Laemmli sample buffer and separated by SDS-PAGE. Gels were stained with colloidal Coomassie Blue G250 dye and quantified by measuring Coomassie Blue fluorescence on a Typhoon Trio scanner (GE Healthcare) using an excitation wavelength of 532 nm and no emission filter. Integration of band intensities was performed using ImageQuant TL image-analysis software (GE Healthcare). The intensities of BLOC-3 bands were normalized to the intensity of the GST-Rab band in each lane to account for loading variations. Binding constants were obtained by non-linear curve fitting in Microcal Origin (Northampton, MA). For pulldown from cytosol, pig spleen cytosol was prepared as described (25.van der Sluijs P. Neeft M. van Vlijmen T. Elstak E. Wieffer M. Methods Enzymol. 2008; 438: 185-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Immobilized GST-Rab proteins charged with GMP-PNP or GDP were incubated with cytosol at 4 °C by end-over-end rotation. After 2 h, the beads were washed (26.Rojas R. van Vlijmen T. Mardones G.A. Prabhu Y. Rojas A.L. Mohammed S. Heck A.J. Raposo G. van der Sluijs P. Bonifacino J.S. J. Cell Biol. 2008; 183: 513-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar), and bound protein was eluted by boiling for 5 min in Laemmli sample buffer. Bound protein was then detected by immunoblotting with an antibody to HPS4 (9.Martina J.A. Moriyama K. Bonifacino J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 29376-29384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). For pulldown from cell lysates, COS-7 cells were transfected with pCIneo-HA-HPS1, and/or pCIneo-Myc-HPS4 (9.Martina J.A. Moriyama K. Bonifacino J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 29376-29384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) using Lipofectamine-2000 (Invitrogen). After 24 h, the cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, and 0.2% (w/v) Triton X-100 for 10 min on ice. Lysates were spun for 10 min at 15,700 × g in a refrigerated benchtop centrifuge (Eppendorf, Nijmegen, The Netherlands). Supernatants were collected and incubated with GST-Rab9a-GMP-PNP (or GST or GST-Rab9a-GDP as negative controls) bound to glutathione-agarose beads for 2 h by end-over-end rotation. Samples were subsequently washed six times with lysis buffer; the excess buffer was drained with a 30.5-gauge needle, and bound proteins were eluted by boiling in Laemmli sample buffer. Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with rabbit polyclonal antibodies to the Myc (Upstate Cell Signaling, Huissen, The Netherlands) and HA tags (Sigma). The pGBKT7-Rab9aWT or -Rab9bWT constructs were generated by PCR amplification of cDNAs encoding wild-type human Rab9a or Rab9b, followed by in-frame cloning into the EcoRI-SmaI sites or the EcoRI-SalI sites of the pGBKT7 (TRP1) vector (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA), respectively. Mutagenesis of these constructs was performed by using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). All the constructs were sequenced to confirm their identity and the presence of the desired mutations. Cloning of full-length human HPS4 and HPS1 into the pGADT7 (LEU2) vector (Clontech) has been described before (9.Martina J.A. Moriyama K. Bonifacino J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 29376-29384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The pGADT7-pallidin construct was generated by PCR amplification of a cDNA-encoding human pallidin, followed by in-frame cloning into the EcoRI-SalI sites of the pGADT7 vector. The Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain AH109 (Clontech) was co-transformed with pGBKT7-Rab9aWT (or pGBKT7-Rab9a(Q66L)) and pGADT7-HPS4, pGADT7-HPS1 or pGADT7-pallidin by the lithium acetate method as described in the instructions for the MATCHMAKER two-hybrid kit (Clontech). As negative controls, AH109 cells were co-transformed with pGBKT7-Rab9aWT (or Rab9a(Q66L)) and pGADT7-SV40, or the empty vector pGADT7. AH109 cells were also co-transformed with pGADT-HPS4 and pGBKT7-p53, and the empty vector pGBKT7. Similar control experiments were performed with the pGBKT7-Rab9b and pGBKT7-Rab9b(Q66L) constructs. AH109 transformants were resuspended in water to 0.2 A600/ml, and 5 μl were spotted on plates in the presence or absence of histidine (His) with or without the histidine biosynthesis inhibitor 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole (3AT). Plates were incubated at 30 °C for 3–4 days. As a positive control for growth on -His (with or without 3AT) plates, AH109 cells were co-transformed with pGBKT7-p53 and pGADT7-SV40. To gain insight into the assembly of BLOC-3, we co-expressed human HPS1 and HPS4 in Sf9 insect cells using a baculovirus expression system. A GST tag and TEV protease cleavage site were added to the N terminus of HPS4 to aid purification. After capture on glutathione-Sepharose, HPS1 remained tightly associated with GST-HPS4 (data not shown, see below). Upon removal of the GST tag with TEV protease, BLOC-3 remained soluble at low ionic strength. However, aggregates began to form at concentrations of the complex above 0.5 mg/ml, and most of it eluted in the void volume during gel filtration on Superose 6. The solubility of BLOC-3 decreased further with increasing ionic strength, indicating exposure of hydrophobic surface patches as a possible cause of aggregation. Therefore, we screened detergents and other buffer additives for their ability to stabilize the complex after removal of the GST tag. Among the detergents tested, β-OG at 0.6% (w/v), roughly twice the critical micelle concentration, proved the most effective at stabilizing BLOC-3 in its native state, allowing it to be concentrated to several mg/ml without aggregation. Gel filtration analysis showed that most of BLOC-3 eluted as a species with a hydrodynamic radius (RH) of 6.1 nm, corresponding to an apparent molecular mass of 440 kDa assuming a globular shape (Fig. 1A). SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining of the peak fractions revealed the presence of both HPS1 and HPS4 in roughly equimolar quantities (Fig. 1B). Given the predicted molecular masses of 79 and 77 kDa for the HPS1 and HPS4 polypeptides, respectively, the apparent molecular mass of 440 kDa suggests either a multimeric assembly or an elongated 1:1 complex. To determine more accurately the stoichiometry of the complex, we further analyzed BLOC-3 by analytical ultracentrifugation. Sedimentation velocity experiments were carried out at a single loading concentration of 2.7 μm in the presence of β-OG. Data analysis in terms of a continuous c(s) distribution returned excellent fits, showing the presence of 96% of the loading absorbance as a monodisperse species with a sedimentation coefficient (s20,w) of 6.11 ± 0.03 S and a frictional ratio (f/fo) of 1.65 ± 0.05 (Fig. 1C). From these values, we calculated a molecular mass of 146 ± 5 kDa for the recombinant complex. Taken together, these experiments demonstrated that HPS1 and HPS4 interact directly to form a 1:1 heterodimer with an asymmetric shape. The hydrodynamic parameters of the recombinant BLOC-3 are in good agreement with those previously reported for the endogenous complex in various cell lines (9.Martina J.A. Moriyama K. Bonifacino J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 29376-29384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 17.Nazarian R. Huizing M. Helip-Wooley A. Starcevic M. Gahl W.A. Dell'Angelica E.C. Mol.

In the course of purification, BLOC-3, and in particular the HPS4 subunit, was found to be prone to degradation. HPS4 degradation was already observed during baculovirus infection, and could be reduced by adding leupeptin to the culture medium or using a baculovirus lacking v-cath, the gene for viral cathepsin protease (Fig. 2A). Therefore, we attempted to map the protease-sensitive regions in BLOC-3 and determine whether their removal might produce a stable subcomplex. First, a sample of purified BLOC-3 was incubated at 4 °C without protease inhibito"
https://openalex.org/W2010298069,"Background Prion diseases are a family of rare, progressive, neurodegenerative disorders that affect humans and animals. The most common form of human prion disease, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), occurs worldwide. Variant CJD (vCJD), a recently emerged human prion disease, is a zoonotic foodborne disorder that occurs almost exclusively in countries with outbreaks of bovine spongiform encephalopathy. This study describes the occurrence and epidemiology of CJD and vCJD in the United States. Methodology/Principal Findings Analysis of CJD and vCJD deaths using death certificates of US residents for 1979–2006, and those identified through other surveillance mechanisms during 1996–2008. Since CJD is invariably fatal and illness duration is usually less than one year, the CJD incidence is estimated as the death rate. During 1979 through 2006, an estimated 6,917 deaths with CJD as a cause of death were reported in the United States, an annual average of approximately 247 deaths (range 172–304 deaths). The average annual age-adjusted incidence for CJD was 0.97 per 1,000,000 persons. Most (61.8%) of the CJD deaths occurred among persons ≥65 years of age for an average annual incidence of 4.8 per 1,000,000 persons in this population. Most deaths were among whites (94.6%); the age-adjusted incidence for whites was 2.7 times higher than that for blacks (1.04 and 0.40, respectively). Three patients who died since 2004 were reported with vCJD; epidemiologic evidence indicated that their infection was acquired outside of the United States. Conclusion/Significance Surveillance continues to show an annual CJD incidence rate of about 1 case per 1,000,000 persons and marked differences in CJD rates by age and race in the United States. Ongoing surveillance remains important for monitoring the stability of the CJD incidence rates, and detecting occurrences of vCJD and possibly other novel prion diseases in the United States."
https://openalex.org/W2091698674,"The Neuromutagenesis Facility at the Jackson Laboratory generated a mouse model of retinal vasculopathy, nmf223, which is characterized clinically by vitreal fibroplasia and vessel tortuosity. nmf223 homozygotes also have reduced electroretinogram responses, which are coupled histologically with a thinning of the inner nuclear layer. The nmf223 locus was mapped to chromosome 17, and a missense mutation was identified in Lama1 that leads to the substitution of cysteine for a tyrosine at amino acid 265 of laminin α1, a basement membrane protein. Despite normal localization of laminin α1 and other components of the inner limiting membrane, a reduced integrity of this structure was suggested by ectopic cells and blood vessels within the vitreous. Immunohistochemical characterization of nmf223 homozygous retinas demonstrated the abnormal migration of retinal astrocytes into the vitreous along with the persistence of hyaloid vasculature. The Y265C mutation significantly reduced laminin N-terminal domain (LN) interactions in a bacterial two-hybrid system. Therefore, this mutation could affect interactions between laminin α1 and other laminin chains. To expand upon these findings, a Lama1 null mutant, Lama1tm1.1Olf, was generated that exhibits a similar but more severe retinal phenotype than that seen in nmf223 homozygotes. The increased severity of the Lama1 null mutant phenotype is probably due to the complete loss of the inner limiting membrane in these mice.

The 15 known laminin isoforms each contain one of the five α, three β, and three γ chains and have distinct functions and tissue expression patterns. Although α1 is the first α chain to appear during embryonic development and is widely expressed during organogenesis (3.Dziadek M. Timpl R. Dev.

Within the eye, laminin α1 is expressed in the inner limiting membrane as well as the ciliary body and lens (5.Falk M. Ferletta M. Forsberg E. Ekblom P.

It has been difficult to study the functional role of this gene beyond embryogenesis, because all Lama1 mouse mutants generated to date die by embryonic day 7 (10.Alpy F. Jivkov I. Sorokin L.

Zebrafish produced with lama1 knockdown morpholinos were shown to develop severe lens degeneration by 48 h postfertilization with apparent reduction in eye size by 72 h (16.Zinkevich N.S. Bosenko D.V. Link B.A. Semina E.V. BMC Dev. Biol. 2006; 6: 13Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In separate studies, zebrafish with mutations in lama1 were shown to have defects in axonal guidance (13.Karlstrom R.O. Trowe T. Klostermann S. Baier H. Brand M. Crawford A.D. Grunewald B. Haffter P.

Another study identified a zebrafish lama1 mutant, lama1a69, in a forward genetic screen that carries a cysteine to serine substitution at amino acid 56 (15.Semina E.V. Bosenko D.V. Zinkevich N.C. Soules K.A. Hyde D.R. Vihtelic T.S. Willer G.B. Gregg R.G. Link B.A. Dev. Biol. 2006; 299: 63-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). At 10 days postfertilization, lama1a69 zebrafish have a reduced body axis and early lens degeneration as well as defects of retinal ganglion cells and of hyaloid vessels, which provide nutrients to the retina prior to its vascularization. Lama1 zebrafish mutants also exhibit inner limiting membrane disruptions and shortened Müller cell end-feet (12.Biehlmaier O. Makhankov Y. Neuhauss S.C. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2007; 48: 2887-2894Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Although these studies indicate the importance of lama1 in retinal development, the effects of these mutations in the adult retina could not be determined because they are larval lethal. In particular, the potential involvement of lama1 in retinal vascular development could not be discerned because zebrafish models die prior to the initiation of this process. The present study reports a mouse mutant in which a missense mutation generated by chemical mutagenesis in the Lama1 gene disrupts retinal development. In order to better understand the functional consequences of this mutation, a Lama1 null mouse was generated using Cre-lox technology. The normal life span of the Lama1 mouse mutants discussed herein allowed the investigation of the role(s) that laminin α 1 plays in retinal vessel and inner limiting membrane development. C57BL/6J (B6) male mice (G0) were administered N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea in three intraperitoneal injections at 80 mg/kg over a period of 3–4 weeks. After returning to fertility, the G0 mice were mated to B6 females to produce G1 male mice, which were subsequently mated to B6 females to generate G2 progeny. G3 mice, generated by backcrossing G2 females to G1 sires, were screened for retinal abnormalities by indirect ophthalmoscopy at 12 weeks of age. Mice with the mutant phenotype, named nmf223, were outcrossed to B6 animals, and the resultant F1 mice were intercrossed to determine the mode of heritability. Generation of the Lama1tm1.1Olf (herein referred to as Lama1Δ) heterozygous and Lama1tm1Olf (herein referred to as Lama1floxed) homozygous mice has been described previously (10.Alpy F. Jivkov I. Sorokin L. Klein A. Arnold C. Huss Y. Kedinger M. Simon-Assmann P. Lefebvre O. Genesis. 2005; 43: 59-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Heterozygous Lama1Δ mice carrying the Tg(Sox2-cre)1Amc transgene were generated by crossing Lama1Δ heterozygotes to mice carrying the Tg(Sox2-cre)1Amc transgene (17.Hayashi S. Lewis P. Pevny L. McMahon A.P. Mech. Dev. 2002; 119: S97-S101Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). F1 progeny heterozygous for Lama1Δ and hemizygous for Tg(Sox2-cre)1Amc were crossed to Lama1floxed homozygotes to generate mice homozygous for Lama1Δ and hemizygous for Tg(Sox2-cre)1Amc. The Tg(Sox2-cre)1Amc mice were on a mixed B6, CBA, and Swiss Webster background, and the Lama1floxed mice were on a CD1 background. Genomic DNA was extracted from various organs, and genotypes were analyzed by PCR.

The nmf223 mice were bred and housed at The Jackson Laboratory, and all experimental procedures were performed according to Animal Care and Use Committee-approved protocols. Mice were fed a National Institutes of Health 6% fat diet and acidified water with a 12-h light/12-h dark cycle. The colony was maintained by homozygous and heterozygous matings, and affected animals were identified by indirect ophthalmoscopy. Lama1Δ and Lama1floxed animals at INSERM were maintained under similar conditions with the exception that they were fed a 3.1% fat diet. For all experiments, a minimum of three control and three mutant mice were investigated. B6-nmf223 homozygotes were mated to DBA/2J mice to generate F1 progeny, which were subsequently intercrossed. F2 progeny were phenotyped at 4 weeks of age by indirect ophthalmoscopy. DNA was isolated from tail snips using a modified version of previously described methods (18.Buffone G.J. Darlington G.J. Clin. Chem. 1985; 31: 164-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). A genome-wide scan using simple sequence length polymorphic markers to determine the map position of nmf223 was performed by The Jackson Laboratory Fine Mapping Facility. Additional simple sequence length polymorphic markers and single nucleotide polymorphisms were used to narrow the critical region encompassing the nmf223 mutation. All unaffected recombinant mice were progeny-tested by mating them to B6-nmf223 homozygotes to determine if they carried the nmf223 mutation. A minimum of 20 offspring from each progeny test were genotyped and phenotyped. PCR amplification was carried out as follows: 94 °C for 2 min, 94 °C for 30 s, annealing temperature of 55 °C for 45 s, and 72 °C for 1 min. Steps 2–4 were repeated for 35 cycles, followed by one cycle at 72 °C for 2 min. PCR products were separated by electrophoresis on a 4% MetaPhor-agarose (Lonza) gel, stained with ethidium bromide, and visualized under UV light. For sequencing of candidate genes, total RNA was prepared from three mutant mice and three control, B6 mice. RNA was isolated from snap-frozen eyes using TRIzol (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's instructions. The Retroscript kit (Ambion) was used to generate cDNA. All genes within the critical region were amplified from cDNA using PCR assays, and purified products were sequenced by The Jackson Laboratory Allele Typing and Sequencing Service. In order to verify that the mutation identified in Lama1 was the nmf223 disease-causing mutation, a complementation test was performed with the previously described Lama1Δ heterozygotes. In vitro fertilization technology was used to generate offspring from female nmf223 homozygotes and male Lama1Δ heterozygotes. Progeny from the in vitro fertilization procedure were genotyped for the Lama1Δ allele and examined clinically by indirect ophthalmoscopy. A minimum of three mice with each genotype were examined. Mice were phenotyped by indirect ophthalmoscopy and by fluorescein angiography according to previously described methods (19.Lee Y. Kameya S. Cox G.A. Hsu J. Hicks W. Maddatu T.P. Smith R.S. Naggert J.K. Peachey N.S. Nishina P.M. Mol. Cell Neurosci. 2005; 30: 160-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Two systems were used to examine ERGs in nmf223 and Lama1Δ mice. In both cases, responses of mutant mice were compared with those obtained from WT littermates, and a minimum of five mice per genotype were tested. The ERG system used to test nmf223 mutants has been described previously (19.Lee Y. Kameya S. Cox G.A. Hsu J. Hicks W. Maddatu T.P. Smith R.S. Naggert J.K. Peachey N.S. Nishina P.M. Mol. Cell Neurosci. 2005; 30: 160-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). For Lama1Δ mice, the following procedure was used. Mice were dark-adapted for at least 12 h and subsequently handled under dim red light. Anesthesia was achieved through intramuscular injection of a mixture of ketamine (120 mg/kg) and xylazine (14 mg/kg) diluted in saline solution. The left pupil was dilated with a drop of 1% atropine on the cornea and vibrissae were trimmed. Animals were placed on a heating plate to prevent anesthesia-induced hypothermia. The reference and ground electrodes were placed in the cheek and in the tail, respectively. The measuring gold electrode was positioned onto the cornea with a drop of methylcellulose. ERGs were recorded using VisioSystem and a Ganzfeld stimulator (SIEM Bio-Médicale, Nîmes, France). Signals were low pass-filtered at 300 Hz prior to digitization. For dark-adapted ERGs, 5–12 responses were averaged, depending on the stimulus intensity (12 for 0.001, 0.0032, 0.01, and 0.032 cd s/m2 and 5 for 0.1, 0.32, 1, and 1.5 cd s/m2). Flashes were separated by 10 s for lower intensities and by 1 min for the higher stimulus intensities. All flashes were 3 ms in duration, except for 1.5 cd s/m2, for which flash duration was increased to 5 ms. To extract the a- and b-waves, dark-adapted ERG data were band pass-filtered at 1–70 Hz. The a-wave amplitude was measured from the base line to the first negative peak, whereas the b-wave amplitude was measured from the a-wave to the next positive peak. After a 5-min adaptation to a background light of 24 cd/m2, light-adapted ERGs were recorded with flash durations of 10 ms (1 and 3.2 cd s/m2) or 30 ms (10 cd s/m2), and five responses were averaged. Optomotor responses were obtained and analyzed as described previously (20.Abdeljalil J. Hamid M. Abdel-Mouttalib O. Stéphane R. Raymond R. Johan A. José S. Pierre C. Serge P. Vision Res. 2005; 45: 1439-1446Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). For immunofluorescence staining of cryosections, tissues were embedded in Tissue-Tek (Sakura) and frozen on dry ice. Seven-μm cryosections were incubated for 2 h at room temperature with primary antibodies in a moist chamber. Tissues were then washed three times in phosphate-buffered saline and incubated for 1 h with secondary antibodies Alexa 488 anti-rat IgG (Jackson Immunoresearch) and cyanine 3-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Molecular Probes). Primary antibodies used on cryosections included anti-laminin α1 (1:100; antibody no. 200) (21.Sorokin L.M. Conzelmann S. Ekblom P. Battaglia C. Aumailley M. Timpl R. Exp.

After washing, nuclei were counterstained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dye (Vector Laboratories). Slides were mounted in Aqua Polymount (PolySciences). Control sections were processed as above with the omission of the primary antibody. Observations of kidney and testes were made with a DMIRE2 fluorescence microscope (Leica) equipped with a Cool Snap HQ digital camera (Roper Scientific). Images of the retina inner limiting membrane were obtained using a Provis AX60 Olympus fluorescence microscope equipped with an Olympus F-view digital camera (Olympus Corp.) or with a Zeiss Axio Imager Z2 fluorescence microscope equipped with a Zeiss AxioCam MRm digital camera (Zeiss). To better understand the vascular abnormalities observed, retinal vessel development in WT and Lama1nmf223 homozygotes was examined longitudinally using marker analysis of retinal whole mounts. The development of retinal astrocytes was also investigated because these glial cells are known to guide endothelial cell migration and retinal vascular development (24.Dorrell M.I. Aguilar E. Friedlander M. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2002; 43: 3500-3510PubMed Google Scholar). Astrocytes were labeled using anti-GFAP, whereas endothelial cells and developing blood vessels were visualized with Griffonia simplicifolia isolectin conjugated with Alexa Fluor® 594, which also binds to endothelial cells as well as macrophages. Hyaloid vessels were distinguished from retinal vasculature by the plane of focus, a more intense G. simplicifolia isolectin staining, and staining with anti-endostatin (25.Fukai N. Eklund L. Marneros A.G. Oh S.P. Keene D.R. Tamarkin L. Niemelä M. Ilves M. Li E. Pihlajaniemi T. Olsen B.R. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1535-1544Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 26.Ohlmann A.V. Adamek E. Ohlmann A. Lütjen-Drecoll E. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2004; 45: 2384-2390Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). For whole mount experiments, all eyes were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min prior to the dissection of retinas in phosphate-buffered saline. For staining of retinal vessels, G. simplicifolia isolectin (1:200; Molecular Probes) was applied simultaneously with the secondary antibody onto retinal whole mounts. Previously described methods were used for all other histological and immunohistochemical assessments, including electron microscopy (19.Lee Y. Kameya S. Cox G.A. Hsu J. Hicks W. Maddatu T.P. Smith R.S. Naggert J.K. Peachey N.S. Nishina P.M. Mol. Cell Neurosci. 2005; 30: 160-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Labeling was visualized by fluorescence microscopy using a Leica DMLB microscope equipped with a SPOT™ CCD camera (Diagnostic Instruments). A Polaroid™ digital microscope camera model PDMC1 (Polaroid Corp.) was used to photograph hematoxylin and eosin (H/E)-stained sections. Primary antibodies used for paraffin section and whole mount retina staining included the following: glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP; 1:200; Dako Z0334), glutamine synthetase (1:1000; Chemicon, Millipore catalog number MAB302), endostatin (1:200; Chemicon, Millipore catalog number AB1880); calbindin (1:100; Abcam catalog number AB11426), TH1 (tyrosine hydroxylase 1) (1:100; Chemicon catalog number AB152), and VSX2 (visual system homeobox 2) (1:100; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA) catalog number sc-21690). ADPase histochemistry, which labels endothelial cells as well as angioblasts and vascular buds, was also used to visualize developing vessels. This was performed using a modification of the method described by Lutty and McLeod (27.Lutty G.A. McLeod D.S. Arch. Ophthalmol. 1992; 110: 267-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Images were taken under dark field using a Leica DFC 300 FX cooled-CCD color camera attached to a Leica Upright DMRXE. The mouse laminin α1 LN (from amino acid 25 to 274, accession number ENSMUSP00000043957 in the Ensembl data base) was amplified in 30 cycles by PCR using the Platinum Taq polymerase High Fidelity, according to the manufacturer's instruction (Invitrogen), with the primers Lama1 Nt up HindIII (5′-AAGCTTGCAGAGAGGCTTGTTCCCTGCC-3′) and Lama1 Nt down BamHI (5′-GGATCCCCGCCTCCAACGGAAATGTCTTT-3′) using 0.1 ng of plasmid pCIS mouse laminin α1 (a kind gift from Dr. Peter Yurchenco, Piscataway, NJ). The mouse laminin β1 LN (from amino acid 69 to 316, accession number ENSMUSG00000002900; primers Lamb1 LN up HindIII (5′-AAGCTTGCAGGAACCGGAGTTCAGCTAT-3′) and Lamb1 LN down BamHI (5′-GGATCCCCCCCTCGAACCACCATATCATA-3′)) and the γ1 LN (from amino acid 42 to 280, accession number ENSMUSG00000026478; primers Lamc1 LN up HindIII (5′-AAGCTTGGGGCGGCCGCAGCGCTGCATG-3′) and Lamc1 LN down BamHI (5′-GGATCCCCGCCCACAGCAAAGTCTGAGAT03′)) were amplified by PCR using the same procedure from mouse colon cDNA. The different PCR fragments were cloned in the pCRII-TOPO vector, according to the manufacturer's instruction (Invitrogen), to generate the plasmids pCRII-TOPO Lama1, Lamb1, or Lamc1 LN. The GeneEditor in vitro site-directed mutagenesis system (Promega) with the primer Lama1NT LNnmf223 (5′-AGACCTTGACCCCATTGTCACGCGTCGTTATTGCTATTCGATAAAAGACATTTCC-3′) was used to introduce a point mutation changing the tyrosine at position 265 to a cysteine (in order to generate the nmf223 mutation), according to the manufacturer's instructions to generate the plasmid containing the pCRII-TOPO Lama1 LNnmf223 domain. The different plasmids were then digested with HindIII + BamHI restriction enzymes. Inserts were gel-purified using the Ultra agarose spin kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (ABgene, Courtaboeuf, France) and subcloned in gel-purified vector pUT18 or pKNT25 from the bacterial double hybrid (BACTH) system kit (Euromedex) that were restriction-digested with HindIII + BamHI to generate constructs pUT18 Lama1 LN, Lama1 LNnmf223, Lamb1 LN, or Lamc1 LN and pKNT25 Lama1 LN, Lama1 LNnmf223, Lamb1 LN, or Lamc1 LN fragments. All constructs were verified by sequencing at the IGBMC (Illkirch, France) sequencing facility. The BACTH system kit (28.Karimova G. Pidoux J. Ullmann A. Ladant D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1998; 95: 5752-5756Crossref PubMed Scopus (1182) Google Scholar) was chosen because it permits an evaluation of the strength between two interacting proteins. The system is based on the interaction-mediated reconstitution of the adenylate cyclase activity in Escherichia coli, which allows cyclic AMP to bind with the catabolite activator protein. Given that the cAMP-catabolite activator protein complex is a pleiotropic regulator of gene transcription in E. coli, its formation turns on the expression of several resident genes, including genes of the lac operon involved in lactose catabolism. The efficiency of complementation between the two-hybrid proteins can then be quantified by assaying the β-galactosidase enzymatic activities in bacterial extracts, which is correlated with cAMP levels produced in the bacteria. 0.5 ng of different combinations of pUT18 plus pKNT25-derived constructs were electroporated into the bacterial strain BTH101 (F−, cya-99, araD139, galE15, galK16, rpsL1, hsdR2, mcrA1, mcrB1) and selected on a Luria-Bertani (LB) medium agar plate containing ampicillin (100 μg/ml), kanamycin (50 μg/ml), in the presence of 50 μl of 2% 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (X-gal) and 10 μl of 100 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, at 30 °C for 48–72 h. Blue colonies (white for the empty vectors and the combination of β1 LN plus β1 LN or γ1 LN plus γ1 LN) were cultured in 3 ml of LB medium containing ampicillin (100 μg/ml), kanamycin (50 μg/ml), and 0.5 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside overnight at 30 °C. The different samples were then diluted to obtain an absorbance at 600 nm of 0.6. After centrifugation at 4000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, the pellets were resuspended in 50 μl of lysis buffer from the β-galactosidase assay kit (Invitrogen), frozen on dry ice, and thawed at 37 °C three times in order to rupture bacterial membranes. After removing insoluble materials by centrifugation at 4000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, the amount of protein present in the supernatant was measured using the protein assay kit (Bio-Rad). β-Galactosidase activity was then measured using the β-galactosidase assay kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen) and calculated as the nmol of orthonitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyrannoside hydrolyzed/mg of protein. Four independent electoporation experiments with at least three clones per condition were analyzed. The results are presented as the mean -fold change of the Lama1 LNnmf223 domain compared with the wild type Lama1 LN. The results were analyzed using GraphPad Prism version 5.0. The Shapiro-Wilk normality test was used to confirm the normality of the data, the difference in variance was analyzed using the F-test, and the statistical difference of the mean was analyzed using Student's unpaired two-tailed t test with Welch's correction in case of unequal variances. The one-way analysis of variance Kruskal-Wallis test following by Dunn's multiple comparison post-test was used for multiple data comparison. Indirect ophthalmoscopy of nmf223 homozygotes revealed abnormalities, including small white retinal spots, vitreal fibroplasia (which presents as cobweb-like material covering the retina), and vessel tortuosity, that were not seen in WT littermates (Fig. 1, A and B). Fluorescein angiography further demonstrated the vascular tortuosity and also revealed hypervascularization of the retina in nmf223 mutants (Fig. 1, C and D). These features were observed as early as 3 weeks of age, the earliest time point investigated, and remained unchanged in mice as old as 2 years, indicating that the clinical phenotype of nmf223 homozygotes is stable. When mice bearing the nmf223 phenotype were outcrossed to B6 animals, the resulting F1 mice were phenotypically normal. When F1 progeny were intercrossed ∼25% of F2 progeny were affected, consistent with a single recessive mutation. The nmf223 locus was mapped to mouse chromosome 17, between microsatellite markers D17Mit89 and D17Mit160. Identification of critical genetic recombinants and progeny testing of potentially informative, unaffected animals refined the minimal genomic region to 2.6 Mb between single nucleotide polymorphisms RS13483075 and RS33491771 (Fig. 2, A and B). Sequence analysis of Lama1, contained in the critical region, revealed an A to G missense mutation at nucleotide 794 that is predicted to change amino acid 265 from a hydrophilic tyrosine to a hydrophobic cysteine residue (Y265C). This mutation was confirmed by comparing sequence from genomic DNA in affected, control, and F1 animals (Fig. 2C). Both the original nucleotide and the am"
https://openalex.org/W2053378001,"Satellite cells (SCs) represent a distinct lineage of myogenic progenitors responsible for the postnatal growth, repair and maintenance of skeletal muscle. Distinguished on the basis of their unique position in mature skeletal muscle, SCs were considered unipotent stem cells with the ability of generating a unique specialized phenotype. Subsequently, it was demonstrated in mice that opposite differentiation towards osteogenic and adipogenic pathways was also possible. Even though the pool of SCs is accepted as the major, and possibly the only, source of myonuclei in postnatal muscle, it is likely that SCs are not all multipotent stem cells and evidences for diversities within the myogenic compartment have been described both in vitro and in vivo. Here, by isolating single fibers from rat flexor digitorum brevis (FDB) muscle we were able to identify and clonally characterize two main subpopulations of SCs: the low proliferative clones (LPC) present in major proportion (∼75%) and the high proliferative clones (HPC), present instead in minor amount (∼25%). LPC spontaneously generate myotubes whilst HPC differentiate into adipocytes even though they may skip the adipogenic program if co-cultured with LPC. LPC and HPC differ also for mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm), ATP balance and Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) generation underlying diversities in metabolism that precede differentiation. Notably, SCs heterogeneity is retained in vivo. SCs may therefore be comprised of two distinct, though not irreversibly committed, populations of cells distinguishable for prominent differences in basal biological features such as proliferation, metabolism and differentiation. By these means, novel insights on SCs heterogeneity are provided and evidences for biological readouts potentially relevant for diagnostic purposes described."
https://openalex.org/W2044316029,"RNA interference screen previously revealed that a HECT-domain E3 ubiquitin ligase, neuronal precursor cell expressed, developmentally down-regulated 4-2 (Nedd4-2), is necessary for ubiquitination and endocytosis of the dopamine transporter (DAT) induced by the activation of protein kinase C (PKC). To further confirm the role of Nedd4-2 in DAT ubiquitination and endocytosis, we demonstrated that the depletion of Nedd4-2 by two different small interfering RNA (siRNA) duplexes suppressed PKC-dependent ubiquitination and endocytosis of DAT in human and porcine cells, whereas knock-down of a highly homologous E3 ligase, Nedd4-1, had no effect on DAT. The abolished DAT ubiquitination in Nedd4-2-depleted cells was rescued by expression of recombinant Nedd4-2. Moreover, overexpression of Nedd4-2 resulted in increased PKC-dependent ubiquitination of DAT. Mutational inactivation of the HECT domain of Nedd4-2 inhibited DAT ubiquitination and endocytosis. Structure-function analysis of Nedd4-2-mediated DAT ubiquitination revealed that the intact WW4 domain and to a lesser extent WW3 domain are necessary for PKC-dependent DAT ubiquitination. Moreover, a fragment of the Nedd4-2 molecule containing WW3, WW4, and HECT domains was sufficient for fully potentiating PKC-dependent ubiquitination of DAT. Analysis of DAT ubiquitination using polyubiquitin chain-specific antibodies showed that DAT is mainly conjugated with Lys(63)-linked ubiquitin chains. siRNA analysis demonstrated that this polyubiquitination is mediated by Nedd4-2 cooperation with UBE2D and UBE2L3 E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes. The model is proposed whereby each ubiquitinated DAT molecule is modified by a single four-ubiquitin Lys(63)-linked chain that can be conjugated to various lysine residues of DAT."
https://openalex.org/W1970989847,"Gliosis is a biological process that occurs during injury repair in the central nervous system and is characterized by the overexpression of the intermediate filaments (IFs) glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and vimentin. A common thread in many retinal diseases is reactive Müller cell gliosis, an untreatable condition that leads to tissue scarring and even blindness. Here, we demonstrate that the vimentin-targeting small molecule withaferin A (WFA) is a novel chemical probe of GFAP. Using molecular modeling studies that build on the x-ray crystal structure of tetrameric vimentin rod 2B domain we reveal that the WFA binding site is conserved in the corresponding domain of tetrameric GFAP. Consequently, we demonstrate that WFA covalently binds soluble recombinant tetrameric human GFAP at cysteine 294. In cultured primary astrocytes, WFA binds to and down-regulates soluble vimentin and GFAP expression to cause cell cycle G0/G1 arrest. Exploiting a chemical injury model that overexpresses vimentin and GFAP in retinal Müller glia, we demonstrate that systemic delivery of WFA down-regulates soluble vimentin and GFAP expression in mouse retinas. This pharmacological knockdown of soluble IFs results in the impairment of GFAP filament assembly and inhibition of cell proliferative response in Müller glia. We further show that a more severe GFAP filament assembly deficit manifests in vimentin-deficient mice, which is partly rescued by WFA. These findings illustrate WFA as a chemical probe of type III IFs and illuminate this class of withanolide as a potential treatment for diverse gliosis-dependent central nervous system traumatic injury conditions and diseases, and for orphan IF-dependent pathologies.

https://openalex.org/W1987175610,"Host cells respond to viral infections by synthesizing and producing antiviral molecules such as type I interferons (IFN). The Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) encodes multiple proteins expressed during the lytic replication cycle that alter the antiviral response of the host. Considering that in Kaposi sarcoma lesions and primary effusion lymphoma cells KSHV is latent in the vast majority of cells, we were interested in determining whether latently expressed viral proteins have the ability to modulate IFN synthesis. The latency-associated nuclear antigen (LANA-1) is a large nuclear protein that plays a role in the establishment and maintenance of latent KSHV episome in the nucleus of infected cells. LANA-1 is also described to modulate the cellular transcription. Here, we report that LANA-1 inhibits IFN-β transcription and synthesis by competing with the binding of interferon regulatory factor-3 (IRF3) to the IFNB promoter. Using mutants of LANA-1, we have identified the central acidic repeated region as the domain essential for interfering with the binding of IRF3 to the positive regulatory domains I–III of the IFNB promoter. In addition, the nuclear localization of LANA-1 proved essential for IFN-β inhibition. Thus, LANA-1 interferes with the formation of IFN-β enhanceosome by competing with the fixation of IRF3 and by inhibiting the expression of the CREB-binding protein.

Chang Y. Moore P.S. Said J.W. Knowles D.M. N. Engl. J. Med. 1995; 332: 1186-1191Crossref PubMed Scopus (2515) Google Scholar). Most (>90%) cells recovered from these tumors are latently infected with KSHV and express only a small subset of viral genes (2.Zhong W. Wang H. Herndier B. Ganem D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1996; 93: 6641-6646Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). One such gene product, encoded by ORF73, is the latency-associated nuclear antigen (LANA-1). LANA-1 is a large (1162 amino acids) multifunctional and constitutively expressed protein that plays critical roles during the KSHV life cycle. LANA-1 is required for viral episome maintenance in proliferating cells (3.Ballestas M.E. Chatis P.A. Kaye K.M. Science. 1999; 284: 641-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar). LANA-1 modulates the cellular transcription program by altering the functions of various transcription factors, like mSin3A (4.Krithivas A. Young D.B. Liao G. Greene D. Hayward S.D. J.

Virol. 2000; 81: 2645-2652Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). LANA-1 also functions as a potent transcriptional repressor and can suppress activation of heterologous promoters, suggesting that LANA-1 can act on chromatin structure and/or general transcriptional machinery (9.Schwam D.R. Luciano R.L. Mahajan S.S. Wong L. Wilson A.C. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 8532-8540Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). LANA-1 inhibits p53-mediated apoptosis (10.Friborg Jr., J. Kong W.

Oncogene. 2007; 26: 4979-4986Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Within the KSHV genome, LANA-1 up-regulates its own promoter (12.Jeong J.H. Orvis J. Kim J.W. McMurtrey C.P. Renne R.

The early innate host response to viral infections is characterized by production of interferon (IFN) as well as pro-inflammatory chemokines and cytokines that exert direct antiviral activity and regulate cellular processes important for antiviral host defense (14.Malmgaard L. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 2004; 24: 439-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar, 15.Rasmussen S.B. Jensen S.B. Nielsen C. Quartin E. Kato H. Chen Z.J. Silverman R.H. Akira S. Paludan S.R. J. Gen. Virol. 2009; 90: 74-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The antiviral response is initiated by cellular sensors that recognize viral molecules (RNA or DNA) and activate an intracellular signal transduction cascade leading to activation of genes having antiviral functions (16.Kawai T. Akira S. Nat. Immunol. 2006; 7: 131-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (1442) Google Scholar). Such cellular sensors include the cytoplasmic RNA helicases (retinoic acid-inducible gene I and melanoma differentiation antigen 5), the cytoplasmic dsDNA-dependent activator of IFN regulatory factors, and the Toll-like receptors. Although several pathways are activated following recognition of viral nucleic acids, three principal cellular pathways are known to coordinate the activity of type I IFNs as follows: the nuclear factor (NF)-κB, the mitogen-activated protein kinase, and the IFN regulatory factor (IRF) pathways (16.Kawai T. Akira S. Nat. Immunol. 2006; 7: 131-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (1442) Google Scholar). Members of Herpesviridae virus are sensitive to the antiviral effects of IFN-α/β. To minimize the antiviral responses triggered following viral entry, these viruses have evolved various mechanisms to counteract the cellular reaction. Microarray analysis performed during early KSHV infection revealed that several IFN-responsive genes were rapidly up-regulated (17.Naranatt P.P. Krishnan H.H. Svojanovsky S.R. Bloomer C. Mathur S. Chandran B. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 72-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Interestingly, innate immune response gene activation is induced following contact between recombinant KSHV gpK8.1 and cellular receptors, but such an antiviral response was not observed when cells are challenged with infectious KSHV virions (18.Perry S.T. Compton T. J. Virol. 2006; 80: 11105-11114Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). This suggests that KSHV possesses mechanisms to differently modulate the expression of IFN. Because KSHV LANA-1 is constantly expressed in infected cells and known to modulate the cellular transcription program, we have examined the effects of LANA-1 expression on the synthesis of type I IFN. We report that by itself LANA-1 has no effect on IFNB gene activation. However, we observed that LANA-1 could efficiently block IFNB gene induction when known inducers of IFN synthesis were used. LANA-1 does not affect the phosphorylation status of IRF3 but prevents the binding of this transcription factor to the IFNB promoter. The central acidic region of LANA-1 is required for the inhibition of IFNB synthesis. HEK-293T cells (ATCC, Manassas, VA) and HEC-IB cells (ATCC), which lack a functional α/β interferon receptor (19.Fuse A. Ashino-Fuse H. Kuwata T. Gann. 1984; 75: 379-384PubMed Google Scholar), were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma) containing 10% fetal bovine serum. HEK-Blue IFN-α/β cells (InvivoGen, San Diego) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 30 μg/ml blasticidin and 100 μg/ml Zeocin. HEK-293T-E1 were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum supplemented with 150 μg/ml hygromycin (20.Zhou F.C. Zhang Y.J. Deng J.H. Wang X.P. Pan H.Y. Hettler E. Gao S.J. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 6185-6196Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). A549 cells (ATCC) were cultured in F-12K/Ham's medium (Hyclone, Quebec, Canada) containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Sendai virus (SeV) (Cantell strain) was obtained from Charles River Laboratories (St-Constant, Quebec, Canada). The primers used to generate LANA-1 WT and mutant vectors are listed in supplemental Table 1. Full-length LANA-1 sequence corresponding to nucleotides 123793 to 127300 (GenBankTMU75698) was amplified from genomic DNA of BC3 cells by PCR and digested by EcoRI and XbaI. This PCR product was cloned in-frame with three N-terminal hemagglutinin (HA) tags into the pCMV3T vector digested by EcoRI and XbaI. The pCMV3T vector represents a modified pCMV2N3T (a kind gift from Didier Trouche, University Paul Sabatier, Toulouse, France) in which the two nuclear localization signals (NLS) were removed. Three C-terminal deletion mutants were generated by introducing a stop codon by site-directed mutagenesis according to the manufacturer's instructions (QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit, Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) as follows: G996X (LANA-1 1–996), E875X (LANA-1 1–875), and C300X (LANA-1 1–300). Three others mutants were made by PCR amplification of specific LANA-1 domains as follows: LANA-1 319–1162, LANA-1 854–1162, and LANA-1 888–1162. In brief, 50 nm of each primer, 20 μm dNTPs, 1× Expand buffer, and 1 unit of Expand DNA polymerase (Roche Applied Science) were mixed with 50 ng of pCMV3T-LANA-1, followed by PCR amplification. These PCR products were digested by EcoRI and XbaI and cloned into the same restriction enzyme sites in-frame with the three HA tags into pCMV2N3T vector containing two NLS signals. Another mutant was generated by site-directed mutagenesis from LANA-1 319–1162 to create LANA-1 319–892 and was cloned in-frame with the three HA tags into pCMV2N3T vector. pIFN-β-Luc and positive regulatory domain (PRD)-I–III-Luc were obtained from Tom Maniatis (Harvard University) (21.Fitzgerald K.A.

One hundred pmol of each LANA-1-specific oligonucleotide (5′-GTC CCA CAG TGT TCA CAT CCG GGC-3′) was phosphorylated using T4 polynucleotide kinase in a total volume of 50 μl for 30 min. To anneal the oligonucleotides, the mixture was incubated at 95 °C for 5 min and allowed to cool to room temperature. One μl of this mixture was ligated into pTER vector (27.van de Wetering M. Oving I. Muncan V. Pon Fong M.T. Brantjes H. van Leenen D. Holstege F.C. Brummelkamp T.R. Agami R. Clevers H.

Cells were transfected using the TransiT-LT reagent (Mirus Corp.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. 24 h post-transfection, cells were infected with 20 HAU/ml SeV for 8 h. HEK-293T cells were seeded at 75,000 cells/well of a 24-well plate 1 day prior to transfection using the calcium phosphate precipitation procedure. For some experiments, HEK-293T cells were co-transfected with IFNB gene activators, such as TBK1 or IRF3–5D plasmids, together with increasing quantities of LANA-1 expression vector. The level of DNA was kept constant at 1.25 μg by the addition of the empty pCMV3T vector. In some experiments, cells were infected with 10 HAU/ml of SeV or transfected 10 μg of polydeoxyadenosine-deoxythymidine (poly(dA-dT)) DNA (Amersham Biosciences) by using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) 24 h after transfection with pCMV3T-LANA-1. HEK-293T-E1 were seeded and transfected as HEK-293T cells. Total RNA was extracted from HEK-293T, HEK-293T-E1, or A549 cells using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). All RNA samples were treated with DNase I to eliminate residual genomic DNA prior to amplification. cDNA was synthesized, and real time quantitative PCR analysis was performed using a Rotorgene apparatus (Montreal Biotech Inc., Canada) and QuantiTect Multiplex PCR kit (Qiagen, Ontario, Canada) for GAPDH and IFNB gene expressions. The following primer pairs have been used: GAPDH forward (5′-CGA GAT CCC TCC AAA ATC AA-3′), GAPDH reverse (5′-TTC ACA CCC ATG ACG AAC AT-3′), and GAPDH gene probe (5′-hexachloro-6-carboxyfluorescein-TGG AGA AGG CTG GGG CTC AT-black hole quencher 1–3′); IFNB forward (5′-AAA CTC ATG AGC AGT CTG CA-3′), IFNB reverse (5′-AGG AGA TCT TCA GTT TCG GAG G-3′), IFNB gene probe (5′-hexachloro-6-carboxyfluorescein-ATG GTC CAG GCA CAG TGA CTG TCC TC-black hole quencher 1–3′). Levels of ISG15 mRNA were determined by using SYBR Green dye and the following primer pair: ISG15 forward (5′-CAT GGG CTG GGA CCT GAC G-3′) and ISG15 reverse (5′-CGC CAA TCT TCT GGG TGA TCT G-3′). HEK-293T cells were co-transfected with HA-LANA-1 and TBK1 expression vectors with total DNA levels kept constant at 1.25 μg per well by the addition of pCMV3T control plasmid. Forty eight hours after transfection, supernatant was collected and used for IFN-β detection. According to the manufacturer's instructions, 20 μl of each sample was added to a flat bottom 96-well plate containing 50,000 HEK-Blue IFN-α/β cells per well and incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. Forty μl of induced HEK-Blue IFN-α/β supernatant were then collected and incubated with 160 μl of QUANTI-Blue (InvivoGen) per well for 1 h at 37 °C. The activation of the IFN pathway is made through the inclusion of a reporter gene expressing a secreted form of embryonic alkaline phosphatase under the control of the IFN-responsive ISG54 promoter. Secreted embryonic alkaline phosphatase levels were determined using a spectrophotometer at 650 nm and compared with a standard curve made by serial dilutions of the IFN-β protein. HEK-293T were transfected with Myc-IRF3, p50, CBP, and HA-LANA-1 expression vectors in 10-cm plates. One day after transfection, cells were infected with 10 HAU of SeV. After 18 h, cells were collected, and the pellets were resuspended in 400 μl of buffer A (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 1 mm DTT, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and incubated for 10 min on ice. Twenty five μl of 10% Nonidet P-40 were added, and nuclei were sedimented by centrifuging the samples at 12,000 × g for 30 s. The nuclear pellets were resuspended in 50 μl of buffer B (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 0.4 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm DTT, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and incubated on a rocker for 15 min at 4 °C. The suspensions were clarified by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 5 min. The supernatants containing nuclear extracts were collected, and the protein content was determined using the Pierce BCA protein assay kit. A549 cells were transfected with the expression vector of LANA-1 for 36 h, infected with 20 HAU of SeV for 8 h, lysed in 150 μl of lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, Complete-Lysis tablets (Roche Applied Science), 0.1 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mm DTT) and 50 μl of 3× Laemmli buffer, and resolved by SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting. HEC-1B cells were transfected with LANA-1 and IRF3 expression vectors for 36 h and infected with 200 HAU/ml SeV for 6 h. Cells were collected and frozen at −80 °C. Frozen cell pellets were resuspended in 4 volumes of lysis buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm EGTA, 10% glycerol, 10 mm sodium molybdate, 2 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 2 mm sodium orthovanadate, 0.5 mm spermidine, 0.15 mm spermine, 50 μml-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone, 25 μm 1-chloro-3-tosylamido-7-amino-2-heptanone, 1 μg/ml each of aprotinin, pepstatin A, and leupeptin, 0.5 mm benzamidine, 1 mm DTT, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). KCl was added to 400 mm final, and the extracts were rotated at 4 °C for 30 min and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 5 min. The protein content was determined using the Pierce BCA protein assay kit. Samples were lysed in Laemmli buffer, boiled, and electrophoresed on SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and separated proteins were transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Membranes were incubated in 5% dry milk in TBS-T saline (0.25 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 0.19 m NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20) for 1 h to block nonspecific sites. Blots were then incubated in 0.2% milk/TBST solution containing either mouse anti-HA (12CA5), mouse anti-Myc (9E10), mouse anti-p50, rabbit anti-ATF2, rabbit anti-c-Jun/AP1, rabbit anti-CBP, mouse anti-actin antibodies (all from Santa Cruz Biotechnology), rat anti-LANA-1 (Advanced Biotechnology), and mouse anti-PARP-1 (31.Lamarre D. Talbot B. de Murcia G. Laplante C. Leduc Y. Mazen A. Poirier G.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 950: 147-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Some blots were incubated in 5% bovine serum albumin/TBST solution containing anti-rabbit IRF3 serine 396 (a kind gift of Nathalie Grandvaux, University of Montreal, Montreal, Canada). Membranes were washed twice with TBS-T and treated with either a horseradish peroxidase-linked goat anti-mouse or anti-rabbit or anti-rat antibody. Reactive proteins were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The DNA affinity binding assay method was described previously by Severa et al. (32.Severa M. Coccia E.M. Fitzgerald K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 26188-26195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) and adapted by Lefort et al. (33.Lefort S. Soucy-Faulkner A. Grandvaux N.

Briefly, biotinylated oligonucleotides containing the IFNB promoter sequence (5′-Bio-CCC CCC AAA TGA CAT AGG AAA ACT GAA AGG GAG AAG TGA AAG TGG GAA ATT CC-3′) or the PRD of the IFNB promoter (PRD-I–III, 5′-Bio-CCC CCC GAA AAC TGA AAG GGA GAA GTG AAA GTG-3′; PRD-II, 5′-Bio-CCC CCC AGT GGG AAA TTC CTC TGA-3′; and PRD-IV, 5′-Bio-CCC CCC AAA TGT AAA TGA CAT AGG-3′) were annealed with the corresponding antisense oligonucleotides in 1× SSC buffer (0.15 m NaCl and 15 mm sodium citrate). Biotinylated DNA oligonucleotides were mixed with 150 μg of nuclear extracts in 500 μl of binding buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 75 mm KCl, 1 mm DTT, 5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 13% glycerol). Twenty μg of poly(dI-dC) were added, and samples were incubated for 25 min at room temperature. Streptavidin magnetic beads (Roche Applied Science), washed three times with binding buffer, were added to the reaction mixtures and incubated for 30 min at 4 °C and for 10 min at room temperature with mixing by rotation. The beads were collected using a magnet and washed three times. The bound proteins were eluted from the beads by boiling in Laemmli sample buffer and were resolved by SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting. The methodology used was as described by Wathelet et al. (34.Wathelet M.G. Lin C.H. Parekh B.S. Ronco L.V. Howley P.M. Maniatis T. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 507-518Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar). EMSA were performed using 10 μg of cell extracts from HEC-1B cells transfected with pCMV3T-LANA-1 and FLAG-IRF3 vectors and infected or not with SeV. Extracts were incubated with 40 fmol of 32P-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotides corresponding to the ISG15 promoter (5′-CCT AGG GCC TCG GGA AAG GGA AAC CGA AAC TGA A-3′). For the competition experiments, excess unlabeled ISG15 promoter double-stranded oligonucleotides were used. For supershift experiments, 2 μg of anti-FLAG (IRF3) were added to the binding reactions. Protein-DNA complexes were resolved on 5% polyacrylamide gel (acrylamide/bisacrylamide, 75:1) at 4 °C in 1% glycerol, 0.5× TBE. The amount of IRF3 capable of binding to the consensus IRF3-binding site in the absence or presence of LANA-1 was measured by TransAMTM IRF3 transcription factor ELISA (Active Motif). The amount of LANA-1 capable of binding to consensus IRF3-binding site was measured by substituting the anti-IRF3 primary antibody for a rat anti-LANA-1 (Advanced Biotechnology) diluted 1:1000. Extracts from LANA-1-transfected and/or SeV-infected 293T cells were prepared using the protocol provided (Active Motif). HEK-293T cells were co-transfected with 50 ng of reporter plasmids and expression vectors with total DNA levels kept constant at 1.25 μg per well by the addition of pCMV3T control plasmid. Cells were lysed 48 h after transfection, and the luciferase activity was measured using an MLX Microtiter plate luminometer (Dynex Technologies, Chantilly, VA). Values were normalized using Pierce BCA protein assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Rockford, IL). HEK-293T cells were cultured on coverslips in 6-well plates for 24 h (600,000 cells/well) and transfected using TransiT-LT reagent (Mirus Corp.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Twenty four hours post-transfection, coverslips were washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline and fixed with cold acetone for 5 min. The slides were then incubated with mouse anti-HA (12CA5) for 1 h at room temperature, washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline, and incubated with Alexa 488-labeled goat anti-mouse antibody (Invitrogen) in phosphate-buffered saline for 1 h at room temperature. Slides were washed three times in phosphate-buffered saline and mounted with SlowFade antifade with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Invitrogen) before examination. Images were captured by a CoolSNAP HQ camera mounted on an Olympus BX-51 upright microscope (Olympus America, Melville, NY) using a ×60 objective and processed with ImagePro 4.5.1 software (Media Cybernetics, Silver Spring, MD). Statistical analysis was performed with the aid of GraphPad InStat software using unpaired Student's t test. All experiments were done in triplicate and repeated at least three times. KSHV LANA-1 is described as a nuclear protein able to modulate the transcriptional activity of the human immunodeficiency virus-long terminal repeat promoter and to inhibit KSHV viral lytic replication by inhibiting the expression and the functions of Rta (13.Lan K. Kuppers D.A. Verma S.C. Robertson E.S. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 6585-6594Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Considering that LANA-1 is constitutively expressed in infected cells during latent as well as lytic infection (36.Dittmer D. Lagunoff M. Renne R. Staskus K. Haase A. Ganem D. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 8309-8315Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the fact that neither IFN-β expression nor a functional antiviral response is observed in cells infected with KSHV virions (18.Perry S.T. Compton T. J. Virol. 2006; 80: 11105-11114Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that LANA-1 protein may interfere with IFNB gene induction. To determine whether LANA-1 influences IFNB gene expression, we transfected a LANA-1 expression vector into HEK-293T cells and studied IFNB gene expression in response to a variety of stimuli, including expression of TBK1 or IRF3–5D, transfection of poly(dA-dT), or infection with Sendai virus. Total RNA was extracted, and endogenous IFNB gene expression was monitored by RT-QPCR. As shown in Fig. 1A, in the absence of LANA-1, IFNB gene induction was efficiently triggered by all of the inducers tested. By itself, LANA-1 did not modulate the IFNB synthesis. In contrast, in LANA-1-expressing cells, IFNB gene activation in response to all IFN-β inducers tested was strongly reduced. These results indicated that LANA-1 could efficiently block IFNB gene induction when the IFN pathway is triggered through different mechanisms. We next confirmed that the reduced IFNB mRNA levels observed correlated with a reduction in biologically active IFN-β protein being secreted. HEK-293T cells were co-transfected with LANA-1, and TBK1 expression vectors and the supernatant were collected and assayed for IFN secretion using HEK-Blue IFN-α/β cells (Fig. 1B). These cells were engineered to monitor the activation of the JAK-STAT pathway upon type I IFN stimulation. In the absence of LANA-1, the JAK-STAT pathway was strongly activated by TBK1 indicating that biologically active IFN was present in the supernatant. In contrast, in LANA-1-expressing cells, the signaling pathway was reduced to basal levels indicating that only a small amount of IFN was present (Fig. 1B). To confirm that physiological levels of LANA-1 were capable of reducing IFNB mRNA expression, we transfected varying quantities of pCMV3T-LANA-1 in HEK-293T cells (0.5, 5, and 20 ng) and studied IFNB gene expression in response to TBK1 (Fig. 1C). With as little as 5 ng of LANA-1 vector, we were able to reduce IFNB gene expression, and statistically sign"

Two functional genes, SP-A1 (SFTPA1) and SP-A2 (SFTPA2), are present in humans and primates (rodents have one gene). Single gene SP-A1 or SP-A2 proteins expressed in vitro are functional. To study their role in vivo, we generated humanized transgenic (hTG) C57BL/6 mice, SP-A1(6A4) and SP-A2(1A3). The SP-A cDNA in experimental constructs was driven by the 3.7-kb SP-C promoter. Positive hTG mice were bred with SP-A knock-out mice to generate F8 offspring for study. Epithelial alveolar type II cells were SP-A-positive, and Clara cells were negative by immunohistochemistry in hTG mice. The levels of SP-A in lungs of two hTG lines used were comparable with those in human lungs. Southern blot analysis indicated that two cDNA copies of either SP-A1(6A4) or SP-A2(1A3) were integrated as a concatemer into the genome of each of the two hTG lines. Electron microscopy analysis revealed that hTG mice with a single SP-A1(6A4) or SP-A2(1A3) gene product lacked tubular myelin (TM), but hTG mice carrying both had TM. Furthermore, TM was observed in human bronchoalveolar lavage fluid only if both SP-A1 and SP-A2 gene products were present and not in those containing primarily (>99.7%) either SP-A1 or SP-A2 gene products. In vivo rescue study confirmed that TM can only be restored after administering exogenous SP-A containing both SP-A1 and SP-A2 into the lungs of SP-A knock-out mice. These observations indicate that SP-A1 and SP-A2 diverged functionally at least in terms of TM formation.

SP-A1 and SP-A2 are expressed in the type II cells; SP-A2 is expressed in human tracheal and bronchial submucosal gland cells (15Goss K.L. Kumar A.R. Snyder J.M. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol.

Cytochem. 2002; 50: 993-996Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Although a 2:1 ratio of SP-A1 to SP-A2 was suggested in a model of SP-A oligomerization by Voss et al. (23Voss T. Melchers K. Scheirle G. Schäfer K.P. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1991; 4: 88-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), experimental data have indicated a range beyond the proposed 2:1 ratio at the mRNA (24Karinch A.M. deMello D.E. Floros J. Biochem.

Phelps D.S. Floros J. Am. J. Physiol. Lung Cell Mol. Physiol. 2007; 292: L1052-L1063Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The latter showed that the ratio of SP-A1 to total SP-A in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid varies as a function of age and health status of the lung (25Tagaram H.R. Wang G. Umstead T.M. Mikerov A.N. Thomas N.J. Graff G.R. Hess J.C. Thomassen M.J. Kavuru M.S. Phelps D.S. Floros J. Am. J. Physiol. Lung Cell Mol. Physiol. 2007; 292: L1052-L1063Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Studies with SP-A1 and SP-A2 variants from in vitro expressed cell systems have demonstrated functional differences between SP-A1 and SP-A2, with SP-A2 variants exhibiting higher activity than SP-A1 variants in numerous assays. These include differences in their ability to stimulate THP-1 cells to produce TNF-α (26Huang W. Wang G. Phelps D.S. Al-Mondhiry H. Floros J. Am. J. Physiol. Lung Cell Mol.

Physiol. 2003; 284: L871-L881Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The pattern of oligomerization also differs between SP-A1 and SP-A2; oligomers of SP-A1 variants were identified with higher sizes compared with those of SP-A2 under non-reducing conditions (29Wang G. Bates-Kenney S.R. Tao J.Q. Phelps D.S. Floros J. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 4227-4239Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 34García-Verdugo I. Wang G. Floros J. Casals C. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 14041-14053Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). One major contributor to the differences observed appears to be amino acid 85 present in the collagen-like domain, where SP-A1 has a cysteine and SP-A2 has an arginine. Site-directed mutagenesis experiments (35Wang G. Myers C. Mikerov A. Floros J. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 8425-8435Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) revealed that replacement of the Cys85 of SP-A1 with arginine or the Arg85 of SP-A2 with cysteine was sufficient to reverse the pattern of SP-A oligomerization and the functional activity of both mutants of SP-A1 and SP-A2 (35Wang G. Myers C. Mikerov A. Floros J. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 8425-8435Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Differences have been observed between SP-A1 and SP-A2 in their ability to induce phospholipid aggregation (34García-Verdugo I. Wang G. Floros J. Casals C. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 14041-14053Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) as well as in the characteristics of phospholipid monolayers with surfactant protein B (SP-B) (36Wang G. Taneva S. Keough K.M. Floros J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2007; 1768: 2060-2069Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The latter indicates that differences may exist in the interaction of SP-B and human SP-A variants. In vitro studies indicated that SP-A is an essential component for the formation of a surfactant-specific lattice-like structure, named tubular myelin (TM) (37Williams M.C. Hawgood S. Hamilton R.L. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1991; 5: 41-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 38Poulain F.R. Allen L. Williams M.C. Hamilton R.L. Hawgood S. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 262: L730-L739PubMed Google Scholar). Through mixing SP-A and lipids in the presence of SP-B, a lattice-like TM structure could be produced, and the structure and dimensions of TM were similar to those of natural TM found in pulmonary alveoli (37Williams M.C. Hawgood S. Hamilton R.L. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1991; 5: 41-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). The role of SP-A in TM formation could not be replaced by other surfactant protein, such as SP-D or SP-C (37Williams M.C. Hawgood S. Hamilton R.L. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1991; 5: 41-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 38Poulain F.R. Allen L. Williams M.C. Hamilton R.L. Hawgood S. Am. J.

Biol. 1999; 20: 1049-1058Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Furthermore, two distinct SP-A populations (APP I and APP II) from BAL of a patient with alveolar proteinosis were separated by gel filtration chromatography (40Hattori A. Kuroki Y. Sohma H. Ogasawara Y. Akino T. Biochem. J. 1996; 317: 939-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The APP I and APP II consisted primarily of multimeric and octadecameric forms, respectively, and exhibited distinct effects in the in vitro formation of TM with lipids (APP II fraction formed TM but not APP I) (41Hattori A. Kuroki Y. Katoh T. Takahashi H. Shen H.Q. Suzuki Y. Akino T. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1996; 14: 608-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), indicating that a certain oligomeric form of SP-A is required for a lattice-like TM structure. SP-A was found to be localized at the corners of the TM lattice (42Voorhout W.F. Veenendaal T. Haagsman H.P. Verkleij A.J. van Golde L.M. Geuze H.J. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1991; 39: 1331-1336Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Although the physiological importance of TM is not clear under either health or disease, an increase of TM-associated SP-A was recently observed to correlate with improved lung preservation in ischemia/reperfusion lung injury (43Fehrenbach H. Tews S. Fehrenbach A. Ochs M. Wittwer T. Wahlers T. Richter J. Respir. Res. 2005; 6: 60Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). However, until the present study, it was unknown whether either SP-A1 or SP-A2 or both are necessary for TM formation. Humanized mouse techniques have provided a powerful tool in the study of many human biological processes and in the preclinical testing (44Shultz L.D. Ishikawa F. Greiner D.L. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2007; 7: 118-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (1036) Google Scholar, 45Gonzalez F.J. Yu A.M. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2006; 46: 41-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Humanized mice include two types of mice: 1) immunodeficient mice engrafted with human hematopoietic cells and tissues and 2) mice that transgenically express human gene(s) (i.e. humanized transgenic (hTG) mice) (44Shultz L.D. Ishikawa F. Greiner D.L. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2007; 7: 118-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (1036) Google Scholar). hTG mouse models have helped overcome a severe limitation of the study of human biology in vivo. By means of the hTG mouse method, physiological and pathological functions of human genetic gene/variants (alleles) could be investigated in complex biological processes, so that in vivo difference (even subtle) on phenotypes caused by the transgenic gene/allele can be elucidated (46Reaume A.G. Howland D.S. Trusko S.P. Savage M.J. Lang D.M. Greenberg B.D. Siman R. Scott R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23380-23388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 47Taneja V.

Invest. 2008; 118: 3228-3239Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Thus, hTG mice may be an ideal in vivo system to study biologically functional differences of human SP-A1 and SP-A2. SP-A KO mice have been generated by two independent groups, either in the NIH Swiss black strain (3Korfhagen T.R. Bruno M.D. Ross G.F. Huelsman K.M. Ikegami M. Jobe A.H. Wert S.E. Stripp B.R.

These SP-A KO mice have been used for investigation of overexpressing the rat SP-A gene (49Elhalwagi B.M. Zhang M. Ikegami M. Iwamoto H.S. Morris R.E. Miller M.L. Dienger K. McCormack F.X. Am. J.

Information from these studies indicated that the collagen-like domain of rat SP-A is required for the correction of structural and functional defects of surfactant in the SP-A KO mouse (4Ikegami M.

Collectively, these studies have provided both the technical and biological basis for generating hTG SP-A1 and SP-A2 mice described in the present study. In the present study, we investigated the hypothesis that human SP-A1 and SP-A2 exhibit differences in their biological effects in vivo with emphasis on surfactant structure. Toward this goal, we first generated humanized TG in the wild-type (WT) background of the C57BL/6 and then backcrossed these with the SP-A KO C57BL/6 mice to obtain mice that were negative for mouse SP-A, and each was positive for the human SP-A1(6A4) or SP-A2(1A3) cDNA or positive for both human SP-A1(6A4) and SP-A2(1A3). These hTG mice were characterized with regard to the copy number of the transgene, expression of the transgene SP-A1 or SP-A2, oligomerization of SP-A1 and SP-A2 in vivo, and functional effects of the transgene with regard to their role in the tubular myelin (TM) formation. Furthermore, by studying surfactant large aggregates from human BAL fluid, we confirmed a novel observation regarding TM formation via the study of this humanized transgenic mouse model. Wild-type C57BL/6 mice used in this study were purchased from the Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). SP-A KO mice were kindly provided by Dr. Samuel Hawgood (University of California, San Francisco) and propagated in the animal core facility of the Pennsylvania State University College of Medicine. These SP-A KO mice contained the C57BL/6 background after a more than 10-generation backcross with C57BL/6, although the original SP-A KO founder was created with F1 BL6/129Sv embryonic stem cells (5Jain D. Dodia C. Bates S.R. Hawgood S. Poulain F.R. Fisher A.B. Am. J. Physiol. Lung Cell Mol. Physiol. 2003; 284: L759-L765Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 6Li G. Siddiqui J. Hendry M. Akiyama J.

Mice used in this study were handled using protocols approved by the institutional animal care and use committee at the Pennsylvania State University College of Medicine. All mice were maintained in bubble facilities under pathogen-free conditions or barrier containment facilities. A 5.4-kb DNA fragment shown in Fig. 1A was used for DNA microinjection. This DNA fragment was excised from a recombinant plasmid with two restriction enzymes, NotI and NdeI, and consisted of a 3.7-kb human SP-C promoter, 1.3-kb human SP-A cDNA (i.e. either SP-A1(6A4) or SP-A2(1A3)), and a 0.4-kb SV40 small t-intron poly(A) sequence. In order to prepare this recombinant construct, we used a basic 3.7-hSP-C/SV40 vector, which was kindly provided by Drs. Stephan W. Glasser and Jeffrey A. Whitsett (Cincinnati Children's Research Foundation, Cincinnati, OH) (50Glasser S.W. Burhans M.S. Eszterhas S.K. Bruno M.D. Korfhagen T.R. Am. J. Physiol. Lung Cell Mol. Physiol. 2000; 278: L933-L945Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It has been demonstrated that the vector could drive alveolar type II cell-specific expression of the transgene in mice (4Ikegami M. Elhalwagi B.M. Palaniyar N. Dienger K. Korfhagen T. Whitsett J.A. McCormack F.X. J. Biol.

Because two restriction enzyme sites (NotI and NdeI) were chosen to excise the 5.4-kb DNA fragment from the recombinant construct, the restriction enzyme site of either NotI and NdeI in human SP-A cDNA sequence had to be removed before the human SP-A cDNA fragment was cloned into the vector. Thus, first, the NotI site was eliminated in the coding region of hSP-A cDNA using a site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) with primers 1244/1245, and then with primers 1246/1247, the NdeI site of the hSP-A cDNA sequence was eliminated according to a previous method (35Wang G. Myers C. Mikerov A. Floros J. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 8425-8435Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The primers used in this study are shown in Table 1. These mutations only changed one nucleotide at each site of either NotI or NdeI and did not change the amino acid of hSP-A. Following site-directed mutagenesis, an hSP-A cDNA fragment (1.3 kb), containing about 0.06 kb of 5′-UTR, 0.74 kb of SP-A coding region, and 0.5 kb of 3′-UTR, was amplified through PCR with primers 1242/1243, and the PCR products were then digested with SalI. The 1.3-kb hSP-A cDNA fragment was cloned into 3.7SP-C/SV40 vector. Recombinant constructs were sequenced, and the orientation of human SP-A cDNA was confirmed by DNA sequencing. The processes of recombinant DNA were carried out according to standard molecular cloning methods.TABLE 1Primers used in this studyPrimerSequence (5′ to 3′)Comments1458GGAGGGCCAGGAACAAACAGGHuman SP-C promoter, sense1459CCAGGAGTGCCGGGGATACCAGHuman SP-A exon I, antisense1433CACATATAAGACCCTGGTCACACCTHuman SP-C promoter, sense292CCATTATTCCCAGGAGGACTAGGTGHuman SP-A2 antisense at exon II293CCATCATTTCCAGGAGGACTAGGCAHuman SP-A1 antisense at exon II68CAGGTCGACTGCCACAGAGACCTCAGAGTHuman SP-A antisense at 3′-UTR1549CCTGTCTGGTAGCAAGTAGAGCTMouse SP-A sense1542CCAGTGACATCGGGAGGAAATCCMouse SP-A antisense1280GTGGGGTGGGATTAGATAAATGCMouse SP-A for SP-A (−/−) KO mouse1242GGCCCGGGgtcgacTGGAGGCTCTGTGTGTGGGHuman SP-A, sense with SalI site1243GGCCCGGGgtcgacTGCCACAGAGACCTCAGAGTHuman SP-A, antisense with SalI site1244ATGTGCCAGAGCAGGAGGCCGCATTGCTGTCHuman SP-A, sense with a mutated nucleotide1245GACAGCAATGCGGCCTCCTGCTCTGGCACATHuman SP-A, antisense with a mutated nucleotide1246GTGAAGAAGTACAACACCTATGCCTATGTAGGCHuman SP-A, sense with a mutated nucleotide1247GCCTACATAGGCATAGGTGTTGTACTTCTTCACHuman SP-A, antisense with a mutated nucleotide1634CCTTGCCCCGTGCCTATGAGHuman SP-C 5′-flanking region, antisense1636TGAGCAACTCTGGCCAAGCATAAHuman SP-A 3′-UTR, sense Open table in a new tab The generation of hTG mice was carried out via contractual agreement in the transgenic mouse facility of the University of California, Irvine. DNA was prepared for microinjection into fertilized oocytes as follows. A 5.4-kb DNA fragment (see Fig. 1A) was excised from the construct with both restriction enzymes NotI and NdeI. The DNA fragment was subjected to electrophoresis of lower melting agarose gel, and the appropriate DNA band at the gel was purified according to the protocol for DNA to be used for the generation of hTG mice. The quality and quantity of DNA was examined by an agarose gel and QC 2100 bioanalyzer method, and DNA was diluted to 20 ng/μl. Fertilized oocytes were prepared from wild-type C57BL/6 mice. The DNA was directly microinjected into fertilized C57BL/6 oocytes, and the injected oocytes were immediately delivered into the uterus of WT C57BL/6 mice. The transgenic status of the pups was determined by genotyping analysis of DNA from mouse tails. For identification of positive hSP-A TG mice, genomic DNA was extracted from mouse tail (about 0.6 cm) according to the protocol of the Qiagen DNeasy tissue kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). The quality of the genomic DNA (5 μl) was assessed by the pattern seen on 0.8% agarose gel electrophoresis. λDNA/HindIII digest was used as a molecular marker. Only high quality genomic DNA was used further for genotyping. Several PCR amplifications were performed with total genomic DNA and appropriate primers (see Table 1), and the PCR products were examined by 1 or 2% agarose gel electrophoresis to determine whether the potential TG mice were positive or negative for the transgene. For example, primer pair 1458/1459 was used to screen transgenic mice for both SP-A1 and SP-A2, and primer pairs 1433/292 and 1433/293 were used to identify SP-A2(1A3)- and SP-A1(6A4)-specific TG mice, respectively. The primers used are shown in Table 1. A positive TG mouse had one DNA band of PCR products of about 340 bp in a 2% agarose gel. For the above three primer pairs, the PCR conditions were as follows: 1) 94 °C for 2 min; 2) 35 cycles at 94 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 1 min; and 3) the final extension step at 72 °C for 7 min. To examine whether intact 1.3-kb hSP-A cDNA was integrated in the genome of potential transgenic mice, the primer pair 1433/68 for PCR was utilized. This PCR product (about 1.35 kb) should contain the entire hSP-A cDNA as well as a partial region of the human SP-C promoter. The conditions for PCR amplification were as follows: 94 °C for 2 min and 35 cycles at 94 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 1.5 min and then the final extension step at 72 °C for 7 min. Positive PCR results indicated that the genome of the TG mouse contained an intact hSP-A cDNA, and the 1.35-kb DNA PCR products were confirmed as hSP-A sequence by sequencing. The conditions for the above PCR amplification were as follows. The 50-μl reaction buffer contained 35.25 μl of distilled H2O, 2 μl of mouse DNA, 1 μl of primer 1, and 1 μl of primer 2, 2.5 μl of PCR 10× buffer 1, 2.5 μl of PCR 10× buffer 2, 5 μl of dNTP"
https://openalex.org/W2137710360,"Corticosterone, the major stress hormone, plays an important role in regulating neuronal functions of the limbic system, although the cellular targets and molecular mechanisms of corticosteroid signaling are largely unknown. Here we show that a short treatment of corticosterone significantly increases α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor (AMPAR)-mediated synaptic transmission and AMPAR membrane trafficking in pyramidal neurons of prefrontal cortex, a key region involved in cognition and emotion. This enhancing effect of corticosterone is through a mechanism dependent on Rab4, the small GTPase-controlling receptor recycling between early endosome and plasma membrane. Guanosine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor (GDI), which regulates the cycle of Rab proteins between membrane and cytosol, forms an increased complex with Rab4 after corticosterone treatment. Corticosterone also triggers an increased GDI phosphorylation at Ser-213 by the serum- and glucocorticoid-inducible kinase (SGK). Moreover, AMPAR synaptic currents and surface expression and their regulation by corticosterone are altered by mutating Ser-213 on GDI. These results suggest that corticosterone, via SGK phosphorylation of GDI at Ser-213, increases the formation of GDI-Rab4 complex, facilitating the functional cycle of Rab4 and Rab4-mediated recycling of AMPARs to the synaptic membrane. It provides a potential mechanism underlying the role of corticosteroid stress hormone in up-regulating excitatory synaptic efficacy in cortical neurons. Corticosterone, the major stress hormone, plays an important role in regulating neuronal functions of the limbic system, although the cellular targets and molecular mechanisms of corticosteroid signaling are largely unknown. Here we show that a short treatment of corticosterone significantly increases α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor (AMPAR)-mediated synaptic transmission and AMPAR membrane trafficking in pyramidal neurons of prefrontal cortex, a key region involved in cognition and emotion. This enhancing effect of corticosterone is through a mechanism dependent on Rab4, the small GTPase-controlling receptor recycling between early endosome and plasma membrane. Guanosine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor (GDI), which regulates the cycle of Rab proteins between membrane and cytosol, forms an increased complex with Rab4 after corticosterone treatment. Corticosterone also triggers an increased GDI phosphorylation at Ser-213 by the serum- and glucocorticoid-inducible kinase (SGK). Moreover, AMPAR synaptic currents and surface expression and their regulation by corticosterone are altered by mutating Ser-213 on GDI. These results suggest that corticosterone, via SGK phosphorylation of GDI at Ser-213, increases the formation of GDI-Rab4 complex, facilitating the functional cycle of Rab4 and Rab4-mediated recycling of AMPARs to the synaptic membrane. It provides a potential mechanism underlying the role of corticosteroid stress hormone in up-regulating excitatory synaptic efficacy in cortical neurons."
https://openalex.org/W1990685907,"The zinc finger antiviral protein (ZAP) is an interferon-stimulated gene that restricts the replication of retroviruses, alphaviruses, and filoviruses. Relatively little is known, however, regarding the detailed mechanism of ZAP induction during viral infections. We show that, although being inducible by either interferon or virus, expression of ZAP is more efficiently activated by virus than are several other classical interferon-stimulated genes and that viral induction of ZAP occurs under the direct control of interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) independent of interferon paracrine/autocrine signaling. ZAP was up-regulated in cells unresponsive to type I and III interferons upon engagement of TLR3, retinoic inducible gene I/melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 pathways, or ectopic expression of a constitutively active IRF3 mutant. Conversely, induction of ZAP by virus or dsRNA was severely impaired in cells expressing a dominant-negative mutant IRF3 and completely abrogated in cells lacking IRF3. In contrast to IRF3, ZAP induction was independent of NF-kappaB activity. Mutational analysis of the human ZAP promoter revealed that multiple interferon-stimulated response elements far distal to the transcription start site serve redundantly to control IRF3-dependent induction of ZAP transcription. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated that IRF3 selectively binds the distal interferon-stimulated response elements in human ZAP promoter following viral infection. Collectively, these data suggest that ZAP is a direct target gene of IRF3 action in cellular antiviral responses."
https://openalex.org/W2039964675,"Background Anaemia is a common disorder. Most health providers in resource poor settings rely on physical signs to diagnose anaemia. We aimed to determine the diagnostic accuracy of pallor for anaemia by using haemoglobin as the reference standard. Methodology/Principal Findings In May 2007, we enrolled consecutive patients over 12 years of age, able to consent and willing to participate and who had a haemoglobin measurement taken within a day of assessment of clinical pallor from outpatient and medicine inpatient department of a teaching hospital. We did a blind and independent comparison of physical signs (examination of conjunctivae, tongue, palms and nailbed for pallor) and the reference standard (haemoglobin estimation by an electronic cell counter). Diagnostic accuracy was measured by calculating likelihood ratio values and 95% confidence intervals (CI) at different haemoglobin thresholds and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. Two observers examined a subset of patients (n = 128) to determine the inter-observer agreement, calculated by kappa statistics. We studied 390 patients (mean age 40.1 [SD 17.08] years); of whom 48% were women. The haemoglobin was <7 g/dL in 8% (95% confidence interval, 5, 10) patients; <9 g/dL in 21% (17, 26) patients and <12 g/dL in 64% (60, 70) patients. Among patients with haemoglobin <7 g/dL, presence of severe tongue pallor yielded a LR of 9.87 (2.81, 34.6) and its absence yielded a LR of 0. The tongue pallor outperformed other pallor sites and was also the best discriminator of anaemia at haemoglobin thresholds of 7 g/dL and 9 g/dL (area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (ROC area = 0.84 [0.77, 0.90] and 0.71[0.64, 0.76]) respectively. The agreement between the two observers for detection of anaemia was poor (kappa values = 0.07 for conjunctival pallor and 0.20 for tongue pallor). Conclusions/Significance Clinical assessment of pallor can rule out and modestly rule in severe anaemia."
https://openalex.org/W2058530820,"Recent epidemiological studies have found that androgen deficiency is associated with a higher incidence of cardiovascular disease in men. However, little is known about the mechanism underlying the cardioprotective effects of androgens. Here we show the inhibitory effects of testosterone on vascular calcification and a critical role of androgen receptor (AR)-dependent transactivation of growth arrest-specific gene 6 (Gas6), a key regulator of inorganic phosphate (Pi)-induced calcification of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC). Testosterone and nonaromatizable androgen dihydrotestosterone inhibited Pi-induced calcification of human aortic VSMC in a concentration-dependent manner. Androgen inhibited Pi-induced VSMC apoptosis, an essential process for VSMC calcification. The effects on VSMC calcification were mediated by restoration of Pi-induced down-regulation of Gas6 expression and a subsequent reduction of Akt phosphorylation. These effects of androgen were blocked by an AR antagonist, flutamide, but not by an estrogen receptor antagonist, ICI 182,780. We then explored the mechanistic role of the AR in Gas6 expression and found an abundant expression of AR predominantly in the nucleus of VSMC and two consensus ARE sequences in the Gas6 promoter region. Dihydrotestosterone stimulated Gas6 promoter activity, and this effect was abrogated by flutamide and by AR siRNA. Site-specific mutation revealed that the proximal ARE was essential for androgen-dependent transactivation of Gas6. Furthermore, chromatin immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated ligand-dependent binding of the AR to the proximal ARE of Gas6. These results indicate that AR signaling directly regulates Gas6 transcription, which leads to inhibition of vascular calcification, and provides a mechanistic insight into the cardioprotective action of androgens.

https://openalex.org/W2023216836,"Experiments in the late 19th century sought to define the host specificity of the causative agents of tuberculosis in mammals. Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the human tubercle bacillus, was independently shown by Smith, Koch, and von Behring to be avirulent in cattle. This finding was erroneously used by Koch to argue the converse, namely that Mycobacterium bovis, the agent of bovine tuberculosis, was avirulent for man, a view that was subsequently discredited. However, reports in the literature of M. tuberculosis isolation from cattle with tuberculoid lesions suggests that the virulence of M. tuberculosis for cattle needs to be readdressed. We used an experimental bovine infection model to test the virulence of well-characterized strains of M. tuberculosis and M. bovis in cattle, choosing the genome-sequenced strains M. tuberculosis H37Rv and M. bovis 2122/97. Cattle were infected with approximately 106 CFU of M. tuberculosis H37Rv or M. bovis 2122/97, and sacrificed 17 weeks post-infection. IFN-γ and tuberculin skin tests indicated that both M. bovis 2122 and M. tuberculosis H37Rv were equally infective and triggered strong cell-mediated immune responses, albeit with some indication of differential antigen-specific responses. Postmortem examination revealed that while M. bovis 2122/97–infected animals all showed clear pathology indicative of bovine tuberculosis, the M. tuberculosis–infected animals showed no pathology. Culturing of infected tissues revealed that M. tuberculosis was able to persist in the majority of animals, albeit at relatively low bacillary loads. In revisiting the early work on host preference across the M. tuberculosis complex, we have shown M. tuberculosis H37Rv is avirulent for cattle, and propose that the immune status of the animal, or genotype of the infecting bacillus, may have significant bearing on the virulence of a strain for cattle. This work will serve as a baseline for future studies into the genetic basis of host preference, and in particular the molecular basis of virulence in M. bovis."
https://openalex.org/W2030922603,"Expression of the cytokine interleukin-13 (<i>IL13</i>) is critical for Th2 immune responses and Th2-mediated allergic diseases. Activation of human <i>IL13</i> expression involves chromatin remodeling and formation of multiple DNase I-hypersensitive sites throughout the locus. Among these, HS4 is detected in the distal <i>IL13</i> promoter in both naive and polarized CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. We show herein that HS4 acts as a position-independent, orientation-dependent positive regulator of <i>IL13</i> proximal promoter activity in transiently transfected, activated human CD4<sup>+</sup> Jurkat T cells and primary murine Th2 cells. The 3′-half of HS4 (HS4-3′) was responsible for <i>IL13</i> up-regulation and bound nuclear factor (NF) 90 and NF45, as demonstrated by DNA affinity chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry, chromatin immunoprecipitation, and gel shift analysis. Notably, the CTGTT NF45/NF90-binding motif within HS4-3′ was critical for HS4-dependent up-regulation of <i>IL13</i> expression. Moreover, transfection of HS4-<i>IL13</i> reporter vectors into primary, <i>in vitro</i> differentiated Th2 cells from wild-type, NF45<sup>+/−</sup>, or NF90<sup>+/−</sup> mice showed that HS4 activity was exquisitely dependent on the levels of endogenous NF45 (and to a lesser degree NF90), because HS4-dependent <i>IL13</i> expression was virtually abrogated in NF45<sup>+/−</sup> cells and reduced in NF90<sup>+/−</sup> cells. Collectively, our results identify NF45 and NF90 as novel regulators of HS4-dependent human <i>IL13</i> transcription in response to T cell activation."
https://openalex.org/W2031952392,"Streptococcus pneumoniae is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. The ability of this bacterium to adhere to epithelial cells is considered as an essential early step in colonization and infection. By screening a whole genome phage display library with sera from infected patients, we previously identified three antigenic fragments matching open reading frame spr0075 of the strain R6 genome. This locus encodes for an ∼120-kDa protein, herein referred to as plasminogen- and fibronectin-binding protein B (PfbB), which displays an LPXTG cell wall anchoring motif and six repetitive domains. In this study, by using isogenic pfbB-deleted mutants of the encapsulated D39 and of the unencapsulated DP1004 type 2 pneumococcal strains, we show that PfbB is involved in S. pneumoniae adherence to various epithelial respiratory tract cell lines. Our data suggest that PfbB directly mediates bacterial adhesion, because fluorescent beads coated with the recombinant PfbB sp17 fragment (encompassing one of the six repetitive domains and the C-terminal region) efficiently bound to epithelial cells. Mutants lacking PfbB bound to fibronectin and plasminogen considerably less efficiently than wild type bacteria, whereas sp17-coated beads specifically bound to both of these substrates.

Although it is frequently found as a harmless colonizer of the human upper respiratory tract, Streptococcus pneumoniae (the pneumococcus) can cause local infections, such as otitis, as well as invasive life-threatening diseases, such as sepsis and meningitis (1.Sinha A. Levine O. Knoll M.D. Muhib F. Lieu T.A. Lancet. 2007; 369: 389-396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Pneumococci cause at least 1–2 million deaths worldwide every year, mostly as a result of community-acquired pneumonia (2.File T.M. Lancet. 2003; 362: 1991-2001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). One of the most promising strategies to control pneumococcal diseases is targeting the colonization factors that promote pathogen adhesion to human tissues (3.Kline K.A. Fälker S. Dahlberg S. Normark S. Henriques-Normark B. Cell Host Microbe. 2009; 5: 580-592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). Although knowledge of the mechanisms leading to pneumococcal colonization is still limited, it appears that a critical step in this process is the binding of human host proteins by a complex array of bacterial adhesins (3.Kline K.A.

Choline-binding proteins, such as PspC and PsaA, which are noncovalently attached to the cell wall, are likely involved in the adherence to mucosal cells. PspC, for example, binds to the polymeric immunoglobulin receptor of respiratory epithelial cells and may be at least partially responsible also for transcytosis across the human mucosa (5.Hammerschmidt S.

The ability to bind to host fibronectin (Fn) 3The abbreviations used are: FnfibronectinFCSfetal calf serumPBSphosphate-buffered salineTRITCtetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanateCFUcolony-forming unitGSTglutathione S-transferase. is a characteristic shared by many pathogens, especially by Gram-positive cocci, and is considered as a critical early step in the infection process (11.Schwarz-Linek U. Höök M. Potts J.R. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 52: 631-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Fn is a large glycoprotein present in soluble form (e.g. in plasma, cerebrospinal, and amniotic fluids) or in insoluble form on the cell surface, in the extracellular matrix, and in basement membranes. Fn, whose amino acid sequence is highly conserved among vertebrates, is involved in a number of essential biological processes, including embryogenesis and wound healing (11.Schwarz-Linek U. Höök M. Potts J.R. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 52: 631-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Therefore, targeting of Fn is considered a basic strategy by which invading pathogens exploit essential host processes to establish or disseminate infection (12.Knodler L.A. Celli J. Finlay B.B. Nat.

Although pneumococci strongly bind Fn (13.van der Flier M. Chhun N. Wizemann T.M. Min J. McCarthy J.B. Tuomanen E.I. Infect. Immun. 1995; 63: 4317-4322Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the molecular mechanisms governing this interaction are as yet little understood. PavA is one of the proteins involved in this process, because pavA mutants show decreased ability to bind to Fn (14.Holmes A.R. McNab R. Millsap K.W. Rohde M. Hammerschmidt S. Mawdsley J.L. Jenkinson H.F. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 41: 1395-1408Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Although PavA is homologous to Fn-binding proteins of other pathogens (e.g. Fbp54 of Streptococcus pyogenes or FbpA of Listeria monocytogenes), it is likely that PavA does not bind directly to Fn but rather modulates the surface expression of other adhesins that are directly responsible for this interaction (15.Pracht D.

Recently, a protein designated as PfbA (standing for plasmin- and fibronectin-binding protein A) was reported to bind to Fn, plasminogen, plasmin, and human serum albumin (16.Yamaguchi M. Terao Y. Mori Y. Hamada S. Kawabata S. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 36272-36279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). A mutant strain lacking this protein had reduced ability to adhere to lung and laryngeal cell lines compared with the parental strain. By screening of a whole genome display library, we have previously identified an ∼120-kDa immunogenic protein (encoded by open reading frame spr0075 in the annotated genome of the serotype 2 R6 strain) displaying an LPXTG cell wall anchoring motif and six repetitive domains (17.Beghetto E.

In this study, we show that this protein, herein referred to as plasminogen- and fibronectin-binding protein B or PfbB, has a significant role in mediating pneumococcal adhesion to human respiratory epithelial cells. We also show that some recombinant fragments of PfbB can directly bind plasminogen and Fn. The pneumococcal strains used in this study were the encapsulated serotype 2 D39 strain (18.Iannelli F. Pearce B.J. Pozzi G. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 2652-2654Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and its unencapsulated derivative DP1004 (19.Shoemaker N.B. Guild W.R. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1974; 128: 283-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The FP228 strain, a DP1004 mutant deleted for pfbB (spr0075), has been described previously (17.Beghetto E. Gargano N. Ricci S. Garufi G. Peppoloni S. Montagnani F. Oggioni M. Pozzi G. Felici F. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2006; 262: 14-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The FP242 strain, a D39 pfbB-deleted mutant, was constructed by transformation of D39 with a cassette amplified from FP228 genomic DNA using the external primers 0075_1 (CTTCAGCAGGTCAAGACCATGT) and 0075_4 (CAGTTAAATCCAGCATTTCTT) (17.Beghetto E.

Kanamycin (500 μg/ml) was used as a selection agent. All bacteria were grown at 37 °C in Todd-Hewitt broth (Oxoid). When necessary, kanamycin was added to a final concentration of 500 μg/ml. The sp4 and sp17 recombinant PfbB fragments were produced as described previously (17.Beghetto E. Gargano N. Ricci S. Garufi G. Peppoloni S. Montagnani F. Oggioni M. Pozzi G. Felici F. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2006; 262: 14-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Briefly, DNA inserts from λ phage clones SP-cl.4 and SP-cl.17 (17.Beghetto E. Gargano N. Ricci S. Garufi G.

Similarly, to produce the sp17 fragments RD6 (amino acids 899–1053 of the PfbB protein) and C terminus (amino acids 1054–1133), the corresponding DNA sequences were amplified from pGEX-SNsp17 and cloned into pGEX-SN. After induction of the fusion proteins, these were purified from the cytoplasm of bacterial cells by affinity chromatography (17.Beghetto E. Gargano N. Ricci S. Garufi G. Peppoloni S. Montagnani F. Oggioni M. Pozzi G. Felici F. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2006; 262: 14-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Recombinant GST, to be used as a control, was also produced using the same procedures. In some experiments, the GST tag was removed enzymatically using factor Xa (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions, followed by removal of free GST by affinity chromatography. Mouse antisera were produced by immunizing 6-week-old specific pathogen-free CD1 mice (Charles River Laboratories, Italia) by the intraperitoneal injection of recombinant sp17-GST or GST (50 μg) in complete Freund's adjuvant on day 0 and in incomplete Freund's adjuvant on days 14 and 28. The use of complete Freund adjuvant in the first immunization was justified by our previous observations that high titered sera were more consistently obtained with this adjuvant, as compared with other less “inflammatory” adjuvants such as alum. However, care was taken to minimize discomfort to the animals by injecting a low volume of the emulsion (0.1 ml containing 0.05 mg of mycobacteria) and by using sterile solutions and techniques to prepare it. Under these conditions, no significant abdominal distension or complications at the injection site were observed throughout the experimental period. To obtain anti-pneumococcal immune sera, to be used as positive controls, an additional group of mice was immunized with a choline-binding protein-enriched fraction designated as CCR6. This mixture was obtained from strain DP1004 cells grown to the early exponential phase (A600 = 0.2), washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; pH 7.2), and incubated in the presence of 2% choline chloride (Sigma) at 20 °C for 10 min. The supernatant was dialyzed, concentrated, and used as described above to immunize mice using 50 μg (total protein content) for each immunization. All immunizations were conducted at the animal facilities of the Metchnikoff Department of the University of Messina according to the European Union guidelines for the handling of laboratory animals and were approved by the relevant national authority (Istituto Superiore di Sanità). S. pneumoniae strains grown to the early log phase (A600 = 0.2) were harvested by centrifugation, washed three times with PBS, and blocked for 20 min at 20 °C with PBS containing 2% fetal calf serum (FCS). Mouse antisera were diluted 1:100 in FCS-supplemented PBS (PBS/FCS) and incubated with bacterial cells for 40 min at 4 °C. Phycoerythrin-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch), diluted 1:50 was then added to the cells and incubated at 4 °C for an additional 30 min. Bacteria were then washed and analyzed with an LSR Flow Cytometer using the CellQuest software (both from BD Biosciences). The human respiratory cell lines A549 (alveolar), Chang (conjunctival), and Hep-2 (laryngeal) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% FCS in 7% CO2 and dispensed into 24-well plates at a density of 1 × 105/ml. The cells were cultured for 24 h before the adherence assay. Before use, the monolayers were washed twice with PBS. Bacteria were grown to the early log phase (A600 = 0.2), washed, resuspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without FCS, and applied to the monolayers at a multiplicity of infection of 1:20. For adherence assays, infected monolayers were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C and washed three times to remove nonadherent bacteria. After the addition 1 ml of cold H2O and gentle scraping, cell lysates were serially diluted and plated in triplicate onto tryptic soy agar plates supplemented with 3% defibrinated sheep blood (Oxoid) for the enumeration of CFUs. Adherence results were expressed as the percentage of CFUs recovered in lysates relative to the CFUs initially added to the monolayers. Pneumococcal adherence to A549 cells was also assessed microscopically. Experimental conditions were as detailed above, except that cells were grown on glass coverslips, and infected monolayers were not lysed but rather fixed with paraformaldehyde (3.7% in PBS for 10 min at 4 °C) and permeabilized with PBS/Triton X-100 (0.25% for 10 min). After blocking with PBS/bovine serum albumin for 1 h at 20 °C, the monolayers were exposed to anti-CCR6 mouse serum (diluted 1:400) followed by fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG diluted 1:1000 (Sigma). TRITC-conjugated phalloidin (Sigma) was used at a 1:80 dilution for cytosolic F-actin staining. 4′,6-Diamidino-2-phenylindole (Molecular Probes) was used for nuclear staining according to the manufacturer's instructions. At least 300 cells were counted using a fluorescence microscope (Axio Observer) equipped with a structured illumination apparatus (Apotome) and with the Axiovision software (all from Carl Zeiss). Results were expressed as the number of bacteria per cell. Under the conditions described here for the adherence assays (specifically at 1 h after the addition of bacteria), all cell-associated pneumococci were localized to the cell surface with no detectable internalization, as assessed in preliminary immunofluorescence microscopy experiments using permeabilized and nonpermeabilized cells (data not shown). Fluorescent beads (Fluoresbrite YG 1.00-μm microspheres, Polysciences) were conjugated with recombinant PfbB fragments (or with GST, as a control) according to the manufacturer's instructions using a protein concentration of 300 μg/ml. The amount of protein coupled on beads was calculated by subtracting the amount of protein present in the supernatant after adsorption. Care was taken to use in each experiment beads with similar amounts of coupled proteins. A549 cells were prepared as described above under “bacterial adhesion assays,” and protein-coupled beads were added in serum-free medium at a concentration of 108 beads/ml. After 30 min of incubation at 37 °C, monolayers were washed three times, and attached beads were counted by using a fluorescent microscope. At least 300 cells were counted. For competitive inhibition binding assays, the monolayers were incubated with increasing concentrations of soluble sp17-GST or GST for 30 min and washed, and the assay was performed as described above. For the microsphere adhesion assay, silane-treated 18-mm2 glass coverslips were incubated overnight at 4 °C with the proteins indicated below (10 μg/ml in PBS), blocked with PBS supplemented with 2% casein for 1 h at 20 °C, and exposed to 108 beads in 1 ml of FCS-free PBS. After incubation at 20 °C overnight, the slides were washed and observed under a fluorescent microscope. To examine the binding of pneumococci to human proteins, similarly prepared coverslips were exposed to bacteria. Briefly, pneumococci were grown to the early log phase (A600 = 0.2), washed, and resuspended in PBS without serum and applied to the coverslips (1 × 105 CFU/ml). Slides were then Gram-stained and observed under a bright field microscope. Results were expressed as number of particles per field of vision at the indicated magnification. At least 20 different fields per slide were counted. The following substrates (all from Sigma) were used: human fibronectin; human serum albumin; human collagen type 1; human chondroitin sulfate B; human plasminogen, and bovine serum albumin. By using a whole genome phage display library, we have previously identified several antigenic pneumococcal fragments based on their ability to bind antibodies in convalescent sera. Three of these fragments matched the sequence of open reading frame spr0075 in the R6 strain genome. The protein encoded by spr0075, herein referred to as PfbB, is predicted to contain a putative signal peptide, six adjoining repeated regions (each composed of a 150–152-amino acid-long domain), and an LPXTG motif, characteristic of surface proteins that are covalently bound to peptidoglycan (Fig. 1). To assess whether PfbB is indeed expressed on the bacterial surface, we expressed the recombinant sp17 fragment of PfbB (Fig. 1) and used it to immunize mice. Fig. 2A shows that sera from mice immunized with sp17 fused to GST, but not sera from mice immunized with the GST control, bound to the surface of the unencapsulated strain DP1004. Anti-sp17-GST sera also bound weakly to the surface of the encapsulated D39 strain (Fig. 2B). Weaker binding to the encapsulated strain relative to the unencapsulated one was not surprising, because it is known that the polysaccharide capsule can mask surface expression of cell wall-linked proteins (20.Bootsma H.J. Egmont-Petersen M. Hermans P.W. Infect. Immun. 2007; 75: 5489-5499Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). As expected, anti-sp17 sera did not bind the pfbB-deleted mutants FP228 and FP242 (data not shown). This evidence indicated that PfbB is expressed on the surface of both encapsulated and unencapsulated strains.FIGURE 2Presence of PfbB on the bacterial surface as assessed by immunofluorescence flow cytometry analysis of the unencapsulated DP1004 strain (A) and of the encapsulated D39 strain (B). Bacteria were exposed to mouse antisera raised against GST (α-GST, used as a negative control), against a choline-binding protein-enriched fraction (α-CCR6, used as a positive control), or against the sp17 fragment of PfbB fused to GST (sp17-GST). Antibody binding was detected with phycoerythrin-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To investigate whether PfbB is involved in adherence to human cells, we compared the adhesion capabilities of DP1004 and D39 with those of the corresponding pfbB-deleted mutants. In these experiments, the numbers of adhering bacteria were determined using three different human epithelial cell lines (namely, A549, Chang and Hep-2, derived from lung, conjunctiva, and larynx tissues, respectively). As expected, the unencapsulated DP1004 strain (Fig. 3, right panels) adhered to the cells more efficiently than the encapsulated parental D39 strain (Fig. 3, left panels), in agreement with the known ability of the capsule to mask adhesins in pneumococci (4.Hammerschmidt S. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2006; 9: 12-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 20.Bootsma H.J. Egmont-Petersen M. Hermans P.W. Infect. Immun. 2007; 75: 5489-5499Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Notably, the pfbB-deleted strains adhered less efficiently than the corresponding parental strains to all tested cell lines. For example, the adherence of the pfbB-deleted FP228 strain was 68–88% lower than that observed with the parental DP1004 strain. Interestingly, even in the presence of the capsule, PfbB was required for efficient adherence, because adherence of the pfbB-deleted FP242 strain was significantly reduced compared with that of the wild type D39 strain. The poor adherence of pneumococci in the absence of PfbB was further confirmed by microscopic analysis (Fig. 4). Altogether, these findings suggested that PfbB plays a significant role in the ability of S. pneumoniae to adhere to human epithelial cells and that this effect is not masked by the presence of a polysaccharide capsule.FIGURE 4Role of PfbB in adherence to A549 cells, as evidenced by microscopic analysis. Cells grown on coverslips were incubated with S. pneumoniae strain DP1004 (A) and its isogenic ΔpfbB mutant strain FP228 (B). Bacteria were labeled green using mouse anti-pneumococcal antibodies followed by fluorescein isothiocyanate-goat anti-mouse IgG. A549 cells were labeled with TRITC-phalloidin for cytosolic F-actin staining and by 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole for nuclear staining. C, adherence to A549 cells of strain DP1004 and its isogenic ΔpfbB mutant strain FP228, as determined by microscopic counts.

Statistical analysis was performed using Student's t test.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The above data did not clarify whether PfbB is directly involved in adhesion or merely participates in this process by modulating, for example, the expression of “true” adhesins. To discriminate between these two possibilities, we evaluated the ability of two recombinant PfbB fragments to bind to epithelial cells. As depicted in Fig. 5, beads coated with sp17-GST, in contrast to beads coated with sp4-GST or GST, strongly adhered to A549 alveolar epithelial cells. Moreover, adherence of sp17-GST-coated beads was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by pretreatment of cells with soluble sp17-GST, but not with GST, thus further confirming the specificity of sp17 binding (Fig. 5C). These data suggested that PfbB directly binds to the surface of human epithelial cells. The above data indicated that PfbB is expressed on the surface of S. pneumoniae and directly interacts with host molecules. To determine whether this protein can interact with human proteins, we evaluated the ability of the sp17 and sp4 fragments to bind several extracellular matrix or plasma components, including chondroitin sulfate B, collagen, Fn, plasminogen, and albumin. To this end, we measured binding of the fragments to substrates immobilized on glass coverslips. Fig. 6A shows that beads coated with sp17-GST or sp4-GST, but not with GST, bound to immobilized Fn or plasminogen. Neither sp4- nor sp17-coated beads bound to chondroitin sulfate B, collagen, or human serum albumin. These data indicated that both of the PfbB fragments examined adhered to immobilized plasminogen or Fn, although there was a tendency for the sp17 fragment to bind more efficiently than the sp4 fragment to Fn. Because sp17 differs from sp4 for containing an 80-amino acid-long sequence located at the C terminus of PfbB outside of the repeat domain region (Fig. 1), it was of interest to ascertain whether this C-terminal region played a significant role in the binding of sp17 to immobilized Fn. To this end, we produced two separate fragments encompassing the whole length of sp17 and consisting of, respectively, the RD6 domain (amino acids 899–1053 of PfbB) and the C terminus (C-terminal amino acids 1054–1133). Next, we assessed binding to immobilized Fn of beads coated with these fragments, in comparison with sp17-coated beads. To avoid possible interfering effects of the relatively bulky GST tag, in these experiments we used polypeptides from which GST had been enzymatically removed. Fig. 6B shows that the RD6 domain could bind to Fn, although the C-terminal portion showed no binding. There was a tendency for sp17 to bind to Fn more efficiently than RD6 (Fig. 6B), but this difference was not statistically significant. These data suggest a model whereby repeat domains are sufficient for specific binding and thus appear mainly responsible for the interaction between PfbB and Fn. Finally, we investigated whether PfbB contributed significantly to the ability of bacteria to adhere to immobilized Fn or plasminogen. To this end, we compared the DP1004 strain with its pfbB-defective mutant (FP228) for binding to these substrates. Fig. 6B shows that wild type pneumococci strongly bound to Fn and plasminogen but not to bovine serum albumin, used as a control. Notably, binding to fibronectin and plasminogen was markedly reduced in the strain lacking PfbB. These data suggested that PfbB significantly contributes to the overall activity of pneumococci to bind Fn and plasminogen. It is well established that binding to cell surface Fn is a fundamental step in the ability of several Gram-positive bacterial pathogens to adhere to host epithelial barriers and to invade them (3.Kline K.A. Fälker S. Dahlberg S. Normark S. Henriques-Normark B. Cell Host Microbe. 2009; 5: 580-592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar, 11.Schwarz-Linek U. Höök M. Potts J.R. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 52: 631-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Considerable insight into the molecular mechanisms of bacteria-Fn interactions has come from studies on Fn-binding proteins of S. pyogenes and Staphylococcus aureus, although comparatively little is known of the mechanisms and functional significance of Fn binding by pneumococci (11.Schwarz-Linek U. Höök M. Potts J.R. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 52: 631-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). This study describes the ability of a surface protein, designated as PfbB, to promote Fn binding of pneumococci, as well as their adherence to human epithelial cells. PfbB, which was previously identified based on its ability to induce specific antibodies during pneumococcal infections (17.Beghetto E. Gargano N. Ricci S. Garufi G. Peppoloni S. Montagnani F. Oggioni M. Pozzi G. Felici F. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2006; 262: 14-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), contains a typical LPXTG motif for peptidoglycan attachment at its C terminus, and six repeats of 150–152 amino acid residues. Although orthologs of this protein are present in all of the sequenced genomes of S. pneumoniae strains, the number of repeats may vary. For example, SP0082, the TIGR4 strain ortholog of PfbB, contains only four of such repeats (21.Tettelin H. Nelson K.E. Paulsen I.T. Eisen J.A. Read T.D. Peterson S. Heidelberg J. DeBoy R.T. Haft D.H. Dodson R.J. Durkin A.S. Gwinn M. Kolonay J.F. Nelson W.C. Peterson J.D. Umayam L.A. White O. Salzberg S.L. Lewis M.R. Radune D. Holtzapple E. Khouri H. Wolf A.M. Utterback T.R. Hansen C.L. McDonald L.A. Feldblyum T.V. Angiuoli S. Dickinson T. Hickey E.K. Holt I.E. Loftus B.J. Yang F. Smith H.O. Venter J.C. Dougherty B.A. Morrison D.A. Hollingshead S.K. Fraser C.M. Science. 2001; 293: 498-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (1124) Google Scholar). A detailed bioinformatics analysis of SP0082 was performed by Bumbaca et al. (22.Bumbaca D. Littlejohn J.E. Nayakanti H. Rigden D.J. Galperin M.Y. Jedrzejas M.J. OMICS. 2004; 8: 341-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), who recombinantly expressed the repeat domain and described its ability to interact with Fn, although high concentrations (>100 μg/ml) of the recombinant domain were needed to detect some degree of binding. Because Δsp0082 mutants were not generated by these authors, the functional role of this protein or its contribution to the overall Fn binding activity of pneumococci could not be discerned from their data. In this study, we showed that pneumococci adhered to immobilized Fn with a considerably lower efficiency in the absence of PfbB. Notably, we also found that PfbB significantly contributed to the ability of S. pneumoniae to adhere to human cells. For example, using the alveolar A549 cell line, the adherence of the pfbB-defective mutant was reduced by ∼90%, as compared with the parental unencapsulated DP1004 strain. Genetic evidence was complemented biochemically by showing that sp17, a recombinant PfbB fragment, bound efficiently to A549 cells and to immobilized Fn. It is well known that the presence of a thick capsule can hinder pneumococcal adherence, due to a “masking” effects on surface adhesins (4.Hammerschmidt S. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2006; 9: 12-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 20.Bootsma H.J. Egmont-Petersen M. Hermans P.W. Infect. Immun. 2007; 75: 5489-5499Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Accordingly, we found that the encapsulated D39 strain adhered to epithelial cells severalfold less efficiently than its unencapsulated derivatives. Thus, it was of interest to ascertain whether PfbB played a role in adherence even in the presence of a capsule. Our data indicate that this was indeed the case, because the PfbB-defective isogenic mutant of the encapsulated D39 strain also showed significantly decreased adherence compared with the wild type parental strain. This agreed with the detectable, albeit weakly reactive, presence of PfbB on the D39 surface, as determined by immunofluorescence flow cytometry. The occurrence of repetitive domains in PfbB is reminiscent of Fn-binding proteins of other bacteria, such as those of S. aureus, Streptococcus dysgalactiae, and S. pyogenes (11.Schwarz-Linek U. Höök M. Potts J.R. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 52: 631-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Although, in the latter adhesins, the primary sites of Fn interaction have been localized to the repeat domains, it is now evident that regions outside of these domains may also contribute to high affinity interactions (11.Schwarz-Linek U. Höök M. Potts J.R. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 52: 631-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). We investigated here whether the C-terminal portion of PfbB, located outside of the repeat domain region, can directly interact with Fn. This, however, did not seem to be the case. In contrast, a single recombinant repeat domain was able to bind to immobilized Fn. Collectively, our data are compatible with a model whereby PfbB binding to Fn is primarily mediated by the repeat domains, although an involvement of the C-terminal region in this process cannot be categorically excluded. Although PfbB appears to significantly contribute to the ability of pneumococci to bind Fn and to adhere to epithelial cells, other adhesins may also play an important role in this process. It is well known that adherence and colonization to mucosal surfaces requires the coordinated action of several bacterial components. Like PfbB, the recently described PfbA binds Fn and plasminogen and is expressed on the surface of the R6 strain, an unencapsulated derivative of the D39 strain (16.Yamaguchi M. Terao Y. Mori Y. Hamada S. Kawabata S. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 36272-36279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In the same study, a ΔpfbA mutant strain lost ∼50% of the ability of the parental R6 strain to bind to epithelial cells. At variance with PfbB, PfbA is devoid of repetitive domains and displays a 19-amino acid-long region homologous to Fn-type III repeat, which may be responsible for interactions with host Fn type I repeats. Therefore, it is possible that by using different mechanisms to interact with Fn, PfbB and PfbA cooperate in enabling S. pneumoniae to bind to this molecule. It should be noted that in our study, as well in the one by Yamaguchi et al. (16.Yamaguchi M. Terao Y. Mori Y. Hamada S. Kawabata S. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 36272-36279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), strains were used that are devoid of the pili that have been recently described in pneumococci (8.Bagnoli F. Moschioni M. Donati C. Dimitrovska V. Ferlenghi I. Facciotti C. Muzzi A. Giusti F. Emolo C. Sinisi A. Hilleringmann M. Pansegrau W. Censini S. Rappuoli R. Covacci A. Masignani V. Barocchi M.A. J.

Indeed, because these structures may be crucial in mediating the adherence to epithelial cells of a significant proportion of S. pneumoniae strains, it remains to be determined if and to what extent PfbB or PfbA contribute to the adherence of piliated strains. We found here that PfbB fragments, particularly sp17, bind to plasminogen, in addition to Fn. Moreover, PfbB appeared to significantly contribute to the ability of whole bacteria to bind plasminogen, as shown by experiments using a pfbB-deleted mutant. Such ability is considered an important virulence factor because, by this mechanism, pneumococci may acquire potent proteolytic activity, which would enable them to degrade the extracellular matrix and fibrin and thereby to disseminate within the body (4.Hammerschmidt S. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2006; 9: 12-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 23.Attali C. Durmort C. Vernet T. Di Guilmi A.M. Infect. Immun. 2008; 76: 5350-5356Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 24.Attali C. Frolet C. Durmort C. Offant J. Vernet T. Di Guilmi A.M. Infect. Immun. 2008; 76: 466-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). It was recently proposed that pneumococci covered with active plasmin degrade intercellular junction proteins and migrate, by this process, through epithelial barriers using a pericellular route (24.Attali C. Frolet C. Durmort C. Offant J. Vernet T. Di Guilmi A.M. Infect. Immun. 2008; 76: 466-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Moreover, plasminogen could promote pneumococcal adherence to epithelial cells, because this protein is present not only in plasma but also (albeit at considerably lower concentrations) in bronchoalveolar fluid, from which it could be captured by pneumococci and used to interact with the plasminogen receptors expressed by epithelial cells (24.Attali C. Frolet C. Durmort C. Offant J. Vernet T. Di Guilmi A.M. Infect. Immun. 2008; 76: 466-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Further studies are underway to evaluate this possibility. The best characterized plasmin(-ogen) binding factors in pneumococci are surface glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (25.Bergmann S. Rohde M. Hammerschmidt S. Infect. Immun. 2004; 72: 2416-2419Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar) and enolase (26.Bergmann S. Rohde M. Chhatwal G.S. Hammerschmidt S. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 40: 1273-1287Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). The latter enzyme displays a nonameric peptide, which is directly responsible for interaction with plasminogen (27.Bergmann S. Rohde M. Preissner K.T. Hammerschmidt S. Thromb. Haemost. 2005; 94: 304-311PubMed Google Scholar). This peptide, however, is not present in PfbB. Therefore, future studies on the mechanisms of plasminogen binding by this molecule, as well as on its functional significance, may provide new insights into the pathogenesis of pneumococcal infections. In conclusion, in this work we have described some functional properties of a surface pneumococcal protein capable of interacting with host components, particularly Fn. It has been clearly demonstrated that immunization with the several Fn-binding proteins of S. pyogenes, such as Sfb1 (28.Guzmán C.A. Talay S.R. Molinari G. Medina E. Chhatwal G.S. J. Infect. Dis. 1999; 179: 901-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), Fbp54 (29.Kawabata S. Kunitomo E. Terao Y. Nakagawa I. Kikuchi K. Totsuka K. Hamada S. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 924-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), and FbaA (30.Terao Y. Okamoto S. Kataoka K. Hamada S. Kawabata S. J. Infect. Dis. 2005; 192: 2081-2091Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), can protect mice against infection with this pathogen. Therefore, the identification of surface-exposed Fn-binding proteins of pneumococci, such as the one described here, may be potentially useful in the development of protein vaccines and/or of novel therapeutic approaches against S. pneumoniae. We are deeply grateful to Gianni Pozzi and Marco R. Oggioni for helpful discussions."

Here, we reveal that Gbetagamma subunits of heterotrimeric G proteins regulate cell-matrix adhesiveness by activating Rap1a-dependent inside-out signals and integrin activation. We show that Gbetagamma subunits enter in a protein complex with activated Rap1a and its effector Radil and establish that this complex is required downstream of receptor stimulation for the activation of integrins and the positive modulation of cell-matrix adhesiveness. Moreover, we demonstrate that Gbetagamma and activated Rap1a promote the translocation of Radil to the plasma membrane at sites of cell-matrix contacts. These results add to the molecular understanding of how G protein-coupled receptors impinge on cell adhesion and suggest that the Gbetagamma x Rap1 x Radil complex plays important roles in this process."
https://openalex.org/W2073070253,"We have established a proteoliposome system as an osteoblast-derived matrix vesicle (MV) biomimetic to facilitate the study of the interplay of tissue-nonspecific alkaline phosphatase (TNAP) and NPP1 (nucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase-1) during catalysis of biomineralization substrates. First, we studied the incorporation of TNAP into liposomes of various lipid compositions (i.e. in pure dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine (DPPC), DPPC/dipalmitoyl phosphatidylserine (9:1 and 8:2), and DPPC/dioctadecyl-dimethylammonium bromide (9:1 and 8:2) mixtures. TNAP reconstitution proved virtually complete in DPPC liposomes. Next, proteoliposomes containing either recombinant TNAP, recombinant NPP1, or both together were reconstituted in DPPC, and the hydrolysis of ATP, ADP, AMP, pyridoxal-5'-phosphate (PLP), p-nitrophenyl phosphate, p-nitrophenylthymidine 5'-monophosphate, and PP(i) by these proteoliposomes was studied at physiological pH. p-Nitrophenylthymidine 5'-monophosphate and PLP were exclusively hydrolyzed by NPP1-containing and TNAP-containing proteoliposomes, respectively. In contrast, ATP, ADP, AMP, PLP, p-nitrophenyl phosphate, and PP(i) were hydrolyzed by TNAP-, NPP1-, and TNAP plus NPP1-containing proteoliposomes. NPP1 plus TNAP additively hydrolyzed ATP, but TNAP appeared more active in AMP formation than NPP1. Hydrolysis of PP(i) by TNAP-, and TNAP plus NPP1-containing proteoliposomes occurred with catalytic efficiencies and mild cooperativity, effects comparable with those manifested by murine osteoblast-derived MVs. The reconstitution of TNAP and NPP1 into proteoliposome membranes generates a phospholipid microenvironment that allows the kinetic study of phosphosubstrate catabolism in a manner that recapitulates the native MV microenvironment."
https://openalex.org/W2022712113,"Brill-Zinsser disease, the relapsing form of epidemic typhus, typically occurs in a susceptible host years or decades after the primary infection; however, the mechanisms of reactivation and the cellular reservoir during latency are poorly understood. Herein we describe a murine model for Brill-Zinsser disease, and use PCR and cell culture to show transient rickettsemia in mice treated with dexamethasone >3 months after clinical recovery from the primary infection. Treatment of similarly infected mice with cyclosporine failed to produce recrudescent bacteremia. Therapy with doxycycline for the primary infection prevented recrudescent bacteremia in most of these mice following treatment with dexamethasone. Rickettsia prowazekii (the etiologic agent of epidemic typhus) was detected by PCR, cell culture, and immunostaining methods in murine adipose tissue, but not in liver, spleen, lung, or central nervous system tissues of mice 4 months after recovery from the primary infection. The lungs of dexamethasone-treated mice showed impaired expression of beta-defensin transcripts that may be involved in the pathogenesis of pulmonary lesions. In vitro, R. prowazekii rickettsiae infected and replicated in the murine adipocyte cell line 3T3-L1. Collectively these data suggest a role for adipose tissue as a potential reservoir for dormant infections with R. prowazekii."

The presence of LOX-PP in the cell layers of phenotypically normal osteoblast cultures led us to investigate the effects of LOX-PP on osteoblast differentiation. Data indicate that LOX-PP inhibits terminal mineralization in primary calvaria osteoblast cultures when added at early stages of differentiation, with no effects seen when present at later stages. LOX-PP was found to inhibit serum- and FGF-2-stimulated DNA synthesis and FGF-2-stimulated cell growth. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and Western blot analyses show that LOX-PP inhibits FGF-2-induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation, signaling events that mediate the FGF-2-induced proliferative response. LOX-PP inhibits FGF-2-stimulated phosphorylation of FRS2α and FGF-2-stimulated DNA synthesis, even after inhibition of sulfation of heparan sulfate proteoglycans. These data point to a LOX-PP target at or near the level of fibroblast growth factor receptor binding or activation.

C/EBPbeta expression also predominantly co-localizes with GADD45beta in the embryonic growth plate. Moreover, GADD45beta enhances C/EBPbeta activation via MTK1, MKK3, and MKK6, and dominant-negative p38alphaapf, but not JNKapf, disrupts the combined trans-activating effect of GADD45beta and C/EBPbeta on the Col10a1 promoter. Importantly, GADD45beta knockdown prevents p38 phosphorylation while decreasing Col10a1 mRNA levels but does not affect C/EBPbeta binding to the Col10a1 promoter in vivo, indicating that GADD45beta influences the transactivation function of DNA-bound C/EBPbeta. In support of this conclusion, we show that the evolutionarily conserved TAD4 domain of C/EBPbeta is the target of the GADD45beta-dependent signaling. Collectively, we have uncovered a novel molecular mechanism linking GADD45beta via the MTK1/MKK3/6/p38 axis to C/EBPbeta-TAD4 activation of Col10a1 transcription in terminally differentiating chondrocytes."
https://openalex.org/W2115245514,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a chronic neurodegenerative disorder and the most common form of dementia. The major molecular risk factor for late-onset AD is expression of the epsilon-4 allele of apolipoprotein E (apoE), the major cholesterol transporter in the brain. The low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) has the highest affinity for apoE and plays an important role in brain cholesterol metabolism.Using RT-PCR and western blotting techniques we found that over-expression of APP caused increases in both LDLR mRNA and protein levels in APP transfected H4 neuroglioma cells compared to H4 controls. Furthermore, immunohistochemical experiments showed aberrant localization of LDLR in H4-APP neuroglioma cells, Abeta-treated primary neurons, and in the PSAPP transgenic mouse model of AD. Finally, immunofluorescent staining of LDLR and of gamma- and alpha-tubulin showed a change in LDLR localization preferentially away from the plasma membrane that was paralleled by and likely the result of a disruption of the microtubule-organizing center and associated microtubule network.These data suggest that increased APP expression and Abeta exposure alters microtubule function, leading to reduced transport of LDLR to the plasma membrane. Consequent deleterious effects on apoE uptake and function will have implications for AD pathogenesis and/or progression."
https://openalex.org/W2102622708,"Myofibrillogenesis requires the correct folding and assembly of sarcomeric proteins into highly organized sarcomeres. Heat shock protein 90alpha1 (Hsp90alpha1) has been implicated as a myosin chaperone that plays a key role in myofibrillogenesis. Knockdown or mutation of hsp90alpha1 resulted in complete disorganization of thick and thin filaments and M- and Z-line structures. It is not clear whether the disorganization of these sarcomeric structures is due to a direct effect from loss of Hsp90alpha1 function or indirectly through the disorganization of myosin thick filaments.In this study, we carried out a loss-of-function analysis of myosin thick filaments via gene-specific knockdown or using a myosin ATPase inhibitor BTS (N-benzyl-p-toluene sulphonamide) in zebrafish embryos. We demonstrated that knockdown of myosin heavy chain 1 (myhc1) resulted in sarcomeric defects in the thick and thin filaments and defective alignment of Z-lines. Similarly, treating zebrafish embryos with BTS disrupted thick and thin filament organization, with little effect on the M- and Z-lines. In contrast, loss of Hsp90alpha1 function completely disrupted all sarcomeric structures including both thick and thin filaments as well as the M- and Z-lines.Together, these studies indicate that the hsp90alpha1 mutant phenotype is not simply due to disruption of myosin folding and assembly, suggesting that Hsp90alpha1 may play a role in the assembly and organization of other sarcomeric structures."
https://openalex.org/W2082074903,"Human short-time perception shows diurnal variation. In general, short-time perception fluctuates in parallel with circadian clock parameters, while diurnal variation seems to be modulated by sleep deprivation per se. Functional imaging studies have reported that short-time perception recruits a neural network that includes subcortical structures, as well as cortical areas involving the prefrontal cortex (PFC). It has also been reported that the PFC is vulnerable to sleep deprivation, which has an influence on various cognitive functions. The present study is aimed at elucidating the influence of PFC vulnerability to sleep deprivation on short-time perception, using the optical imaging technique of functional near-infrared spectroscopy. Eighteen participants performed 10-s time production tasks before (at 21:00) and after (at 09:00) experimental nights both in sleep-controlled and sleep-deprived conditions in a 4-day laboratory-based crossover study. Compared to the sleep-controlled condition, one-night sleep deprivation induced a significant reduction in the produced time simultaneous with an increased hemodynamic response in the left PFC at 09:00. These results suggest that activation of the left PFC, which possibly reflects functional compensation under a sleep-deprived condition, is associated with alteration of short-time perception."
https://openalex.org/W2068014407,"We consider the problem of optimizing a liposomal drug formulation: a complex chemical system with many components (e.g., elements of a lipid library) that interact nonlinearly and synergistically in ways that cannot be predicted from first principles.The optimization criterion in our experiments was the percent encapsulation of a target drug, Amphotericin B, detected experimentally via spectrophotometric assay. Optimization of such a complex system requires strategies that efficiently discover solutions in extremely large volumes of potential experimental space. We have designed and implemented a new strategy of evolutionary design of experiments (Evo-DoE), that efficiently explores high-dimensional spaces by coupling the power of computer and statistical modeling with experimentally measured responses in an iterative loop.We demonstrate how iterative looping of modeling and experimentation can quickly produce new discoveries with significantly better experimental response, and how such looping can discover the chemical landscape underlying complex chemical systems."

The predictions made were experimentally tested using whole-cell patch clamp. Drugs previously classified as NCX or NHE inhibitors are shown to also inhibit hASIC-1. Potential docking sites were re-examined against experimental data to remove spurious interaction sites. The voltage sensitivity of inhibitors was also examined. Using the aggregated data from these computational and experimental experiments, putative interaction sites for amiloride and hASIC-1 have been defined.

The regulatory volume increase (RVI) occurs through uptake of NaCl and osmotically obliged water after osmotic shrinkage. However, apoptotic cells undergo persistent cell shrinkage without showing signs of RVI. Persistence of the apoptotic volume decrease is a prerequisite to apoptosis induction. We previously demonstrated that volume regulation is inhibited in human epithelial HeLa cells stimulated with the apoptosis inducer. Here, we studied signaling mechanisms underlying the apoptotic inhibition of RVI in HeLa cells. Hypertonic stimulation was found to induce phosphorylation of a Ser/Thr protein kinase Akt (protein kinase B). Shrinkage-induced Akt activation was essential for RVI induction because RVI was suppressed by an Akt inhibitor, expression of a dominant negative form of Akt, or small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of Akt1 (but not Akt2). Staurosporine, tumor necrosis factor-α, or a Fas ligand inhibited both RVI and hypertonicity-induced Akt activation in a manner sensitive to a scavenger for reactive oxygen species (ROS). Any of apoptosis inducers also induced phosphorylation of apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1) in a ROS-dependent manner. Suppression of (ASK1) expression blocked the effects of apoptosis, in hypertonic conditions, on both RVI induction and Akt activation.

The initial goal of the current study was to determine whether Ca2+ binding to sites III or IV in the C-domain of CaM was responsible for affecting the kinetics of binding PEP-19. EF-hand Ca2+-binding sites were selectively inactivated by the common strategy of changing Asp to Ala at the X-coordination position. Although Ca2+ binding to both sites III and IV appeared necessary for native-like interactions with PEP-19, the data also indicated that the mutations caused undesirable structural alterations as evidenced by significant changes in amide chemical shifts for apoCaM. Mutations in the C-domain also affected chemical shifts in the unmodified N-domain, and altered the Ca2+ binding properties of the N-domain. Conversion of Asp93 to Ala caused the greatest structural perturbations, possibly due to the loss of stabilizing hydrogen bonds between the side chain of Asp93 and backbone amides in apo loop III. Thus, although these mutations inhibit binding of Ca2+, the mutated CaM may not be able to support potentially important native-like activity of the apoprotein.

Although PEP-19 has no known intrinsic activity other than binding to CaM, expression of PEP-19 can protect cells from apoptosis (2.Erhardt J.A. Legos J.J. Johanson R.A. Slemmon J.R. Wang X.

The proteins CaM1,2, CaM3, CaM4, and CaM3,4 correspond to mutations: D20A/D56A, D93A, D129A, and D93A/D129A, respectively.Our initial experiments indicated that Ca2+ binding to both sites III and IV in the C-domain of CaM are necessary for native-like interactions with PEP-19. However, the data also pointed to undesirable structural alterations due to mutation of Asp93 and Asp129 to Ala. For example, the affinity of apoCaM and apoCaM3,4 for PEP-19 should be the same if the mutations do not greatly alter the structure of CaM, however, apoCaM3,4 and the other apo mutant CaM proteins had lower affinity for PEP-19 than native apoCaM. Thus, we investigated the structural consequence of these mutations. The data show that, whereas conversion of Asp93 and Asp129 to Ala effectively inhibits Ca2+ binding to sites III and IV, the resulting mutated C-domain exhibits extensive structural perturbations. This has implications for cell expression studies because the C-domain of CaM3,4 may not support important native-like activities of the apo C-domain of CaM.DISCUSSIONThe original goal of this study was to determine whether Ca2+ binding to sites III or IV in the C-domain of CaM has dominant effects on the characteristics of binding PEP-19.

Although the data in FIGURE 2, FIGURE 3 indicate that Ca2+ binding to both sites III and IV of CaM is important for native-like interactions with PEP-19, apparent structural perturbations induced by the mutations complicated interpretation of the data. This led us to characterize the effect of these mutations on the Ca2+ binding properties and structure of CaM.Data in FIGURE 5, FIGURE 6 and TABLE 1, TABLE 2 show that mutation of Ca2+-binding sites in the C-domain increases the Ca2+ binding affinity of the N-domain by decreasing the rate of Ca2+ dissociation, but that mutation of sites in the N-domain has no apparent effect on the C-domain. This interdomain effect is consistent with other studies showing that mutation of the 1st or 12th ligand positions in sites III and IV decreased the rate of Ca2+ dissociation from the N-domain (37.Martin S.R. Maune J.F. Beckingham K. Bayley P.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 205: 1107-1114Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 38.Dodd R. Peracchia C. Stolady D. Török K. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 26911-26920Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), and that mutation of Val136 to Gly in site IV increases the Ca2+ binding affinity of the N-domain (39.Fefeu S. Biekofsky R.R. McCormick J.E. Martin S.R. Bayley P.M. Feeney J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 15920-15931Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar).NMR analyses in FIGURE 7, FIGURE 8, FIGURE 9 show that mutation of Ca2+-binding sites in the C-domain causes significant changes in amide chemical shifts that are consistent with a loss of structure. In addition, mutations in the C-domain affect amide chemical shifts in the N-domain. There are at least two general mechanisms for this observation. One involves a specific interaction between domains that are disrupted by mutations. A recent crystal structure of Ca2+-CaM shows a collapsed structure in which helix A in the N-domain makes significant H-bonding interactions with helices G and H in the C-domain (40.Fallon J.L. Quiocho F.A. Structure. 2003; 11: 1303-1307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Such a conformation would undoubtedly be a minor species in solution. Moreover, the apparent KCa50 for Ca2+ binding to isolated N and C domains of CaM are very similar (<1.5-fold different) to those determined for the intact protein (35.Linse S. Helmersson A. Forsén S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8050-8054Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36.Bayley P.M. Findlay W.A. Martin S.R.

This would not be expected if the Ca2+ binding properties of the N- and C-domains of intact CaM experience an intrinsic effect of domain-domain interactions.A second mechanism for interdomain effects of mutations involves relatively nonspecific interactions between the N-domain and the mutated C-domain. Even though a highly flexible tether links these domains, it is reasonable that random arcing motions would allow nonspecific collisions. Changes in the surface chemistry due to mutations could lead to enhanced interactions between domains. Fig. 9 shows that residues in the hydrophobic pocket of the Ca2+-bound N-domain are most affected by mutation of Asp93 and Asp129 in the C-domain. This supports a model in which exposed surfaces in the mutated C-domain associate with the N-terminal hydrophobic pocket in the presence of Ca2+ to stabilize the Ca2+ bound form, and increase Ca2+ binding affinity by decreasing the koff.Interestingly, inactivation of sites I and II in CaM1,2 does not affect Ca2+ binding to the C-domain. Because the overall affinity of Ca2+ binding to the C-domain (kIIIkIV) is about 30-fold stronger than the N-domain (kIkII) (5.Putkey J.A. Waxham M.N. Gaertner T.R. Brewer K.J. Goldsmith M. Kubota Y.

Thus, inhibition of Ca2+ binding to the N-domain would not be expected to affect binding to the C-domain. The relative structural stability of the N- and C-domains may also contribute to interdomain effects of mutations. The apo N-domain has a defined hydrophobic core and a single conformation, but the apo C-domain has an ill-defined aromatic hydrophobic core (44.Zhang M. Tanaka T. Ikura M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 758-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar, 45.Kuboniwa H. Tjandra N. Grzesiek S. Ren H. Klee C.B. Bax A. Nat. Struct.

Thus, mutation in the C-domain may have a greater effect on structural stability than similar mutations in the N-domain.Comparison of 15N HSQC spectra for native apoCaM, CaM3, and CaM4 shows that conversion of Asp93 to Ala in CaM3 has the greatest effect on structure of the C-domain. Structures of apo Ca2+-binding loops in Fig. 10 provide a mechanistic basis for this observation. The side chains of Asp129 in loop IV, and the corresponding Asp56 in loop II (not shown) are both solvent exposed. Thus, significant structural effects would not be predicted from mutation of these residues. In contrast, Fig. 10 shows that the side chain carboxyl group of Asp93 points toward the backbone of other residues in the Ca2+-binding loop of EF-hand III and is 2–3 Å from backbone amides of Asp95, Gly96, Asn97, and Gly98 as shown by the yellow lines. A similar conformation is seen for Asp20 of loop I in the N-domain. This suggests that the apo forms of loops I and III are stabilized by hydrogen bonds between side chains of Asp at position 1, and backbone amides of residues at positions 3 to 6. Conversion of Asp93 or Asp20 to Ala would eliminate these hydrogen bonds. The extent of structural perturbation in the N- and C-domains may depend on differences in stability in the apo state as summarized above. Specifically, the apo C-domain is less stable than the N-domain and may be more sensitive to mutations.FIGURE 10NMR solution structures for apoCa2+-binding loops III and VI. Solution structure coordinates were taken from Kuboniwa et al. (45.Kuboniwa H. Tjandra N. Grzesiek S. Ren H. Klee C.B. Bax A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 768-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar). Asp93 and Asp129 are the first amino acids in loops III and IV, respectively, and provide the X Ca2+ coordination ligand. Glu104 and Glu140 are the 12 amino acids in the loops and provide the −Z coordination position. Yellow lines indicate backbone amide hydrogens that are within 2 to 3 Å of carboxyl side chain of Asp93.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)This raises the question of what is the best way to mutate Ca2+-binding sites of EF-hand proteins for in vivo and in vitro studies? Mutation strategies must inhibit Ca2+ binding, but should also maintain structural integrity of the apo form to allow productive interactions with target proteins that require the apo state. The data presented here argue that mutation of the first ligand is not the best choice for inactivation of EF-hands III and IV in the C-domain of CaM. However, similar mutations may be suitable for the N-domain, which has greater intrinsic stability in the apo form.Mutation of Glu at loop position 12 (see FIGURE 1, FIGURE 2, FIGURE 3, FIGURE 4, FIGURE 5, FIGURE 6, FIGURE 7, FIGURE 8, FIGURE 9, FIGURE 10) has been used to inhibit Ca2+ binding to CaM (7.Maune J.F.

Biochem. 1989; 58: 951-998Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (see Fig. 1) and it is solvent exposed in the apo form (44.Zhang M. Tanaka T. Ikura M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 758-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar, 45.Kuboniwa H. Tjandra N. Grzesiek S. Ren H. Klee C.B. Bax A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 768-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar). Mutation of Glu104 or Glu140 to Gln in sites III and IV, respectively, does not abolish Ca2+ binding, but greatly reduces affinity (50.Evenäs J. Malmendal A. Thulin E. Carlström G. Forsén S. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 13744-13754Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 51.Evenäs J. Thulin E. Malmendal A. Forsén S. Carlström G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 3448-3457Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). This is consistent with an analogous mutation in site I of skeletal troponin C, which allows weak Ca2+ binding via the first 5 coordination positions, but the EF-hand does not undergo a conformational change (52.Gagné S.M. Li M.X. Sykes B.D. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4386-4392Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Relative to CaM3 or CaM4, published NMR spectra of CaM with E104Q or E140Q mutations show fewer and less dramatic changes in amide chemical shifts in the C-domain (50.Evenäs J. Malmendal A. Thulin E. Carlström G. Forsén S. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 13744-13754Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 51.Evenäs J. Thulin E. Malmendal A. Forsén S. Carlström G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 3448-3457Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Although this is desirable, it was shown that CaM E140Q regained Ca2+ binding activity in the presence of a high affinity CaM binding peptide (53.Haiech J. Kilhoffer M.C. Lukas T.J. Craig T.A. Roberts D.M. Watterson D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3427-3431Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We see no evidence for recovery of Ca2+ binding to mutated sites in CaM1,2 or CaM3,4 upon association with a high affinity CaM binding peptide from CaM kinase II, CaMKII-(293–312) (data not shown).The potential to recover Ca2+ binding at mutated EF-hands is an important consideration, and this potential will likely depend on the nature of the mutation, the EF-hand protein being studied and its putative target proteins. For example, conversion of Asp to Ala at the Y coordination position in sites II, III, or IV of cardiac troponin C inhibited Ca2+ binding to the free protein, however, Ca2+ binding activity was recovered at sites III and IV, but not site II, when the mutant proteins were incorporated into a troponin complex (54.Dotson D.G. Putkey J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24067-24073Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).In summary, mutation strategies for inhibition of Ca2+ binding to EF-hands must balance retention of structural integrity against the potential for recovery of Ca2+ binding activity upon interaction with native protein binding partners. This is especially problematic if the mutated proteins are to be expressed in cell culture where there is the potential for interaction with multiple binding proteins.

We investigated the mechanism of DNA unwinding by the Escherichia coli RecQ helicase using a new sensitive helicase assay based on fluorescence cross-correlation spectroscopy (FCCS) with two-photon excitation. The FCCS-based assay can be used to measure the unwinding activity under both single and multiple turnover conditions with no limitation related to the size of the DNA strands constituting the DNA substrate. We found that the monomeric helicase was sufficient to perform the unwinding of short DNA substrates. However, a significant increase in the activity was observed using longer DNA substrates, under single turnover conditions, originating from the simultaneous binding of multiple helicase monomers to the same DNA molecule. This functional cooperativity was strongly dependent on several factors, including DNA substrate length, the number and size of single-stranded 3′-tails, and the temperature. Regarding the latter parameter, a strong cooperativity was observed at 37 °C, whereas only modest or no cooperativity was observed at 25 °C regardless of the nature of the DNA substrate. Consistently, the functional cooperativity was found to be tightly associated with a cooperative DNA binding mode. We also showed that the cooperative binding of helicase to the DNA substrate indirectly accounts for the sigmoidal dependence of unwinding activity on ATP concentration, which also occurs only at 37 °C but not at 25 °C. Finally, we further examined the influences of spontaneous DNA rehybridization (after helicase translocation) and the single-stranded DNA binding property of helicase on the unwinding activity as detected in the FCCS assay.

Helicases are molecular motor enzymes that unwind and translocate nucleic acids in an ATP hydrolysis-dependent manner (1.Patel S.S. Donmez I. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 18265-18268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 2.Singleton M.R. Dillingham M.S. Wigley D.B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2007; 76: 23-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (917) Google Scholar). RecQ DNA helicases constitute a ubiquitous family of helicases that play a key role in maintaining genome stability in a wide range of organisms from bacteria to higher eukaryotes (for a review, see Ref. 3.Killoran M.P. Keck J.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: 4098-4105Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). These enzymes are involved in many of the processes of DNA metabolism, including recombination, DNA replication, and DNA repair (3.Killoran M.P. Keck J.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: 4098-4105Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 4.Brosh Jr., R.M. Bohr V.A.

In humans, defects in RecQ family helicases, encoded by the blm, wrn, and RecQ4 genes, give rise to the Bloom, Werner, and Rothmund-Thomson syndromes, respectively, characterized by genomic instability and susceptibility to cancer. The Escherichia coli RecQ helicase, the prototype enzyme of this family, is involved in various processes, including the homologous recombination and double strand break repair mediated by the RecF machinery (6.Nakayama H. Nakayama K. Nakayama R. Irino N. Nakayama Y. Hanawalt P.C. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1984; 195: 474-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar) as well as suppression of illegitimate recombination (7.Hanada K. Ukita T. Kohno Y. Saito K. Kato J. Ikeda H. Proc. Natl. Acad.

The structure-function relationship of helicases is difficult to understand at the molecular level, because proteins with different organizations may have similar activities. For example, the need for an oligomeric structure for helicase activity strongly varies between helicase families. Hexameric rings are required for active E. coli DnaB and Rho and bacteriophages T4 gp41 and T7 gp4 (8.Galletto R. Jezewska M.J. Bujalowski W. J. Mol.

Some controversy remains in the literature concerning the oligomeric status of active PcrA and UvrD helicases, which is not well defined. It has been proposed that these helicases are active as monomers (16.Soultanas P. Dillingham M.S. Wiley P. Webb M.R. Wigley D.B.

Different multimeric states corresponding to catalytically active forms have been identified, including hexamers, tetramers, and monomers (22.Compton S.A. Tolun G. Kamath-Loeb A.S. Loeb L.A.

The exact reasons for these discrepancies are unclear, and the possibility that distinct oligomeric states could be compatible with unwinding activity for a given helicase remains open to debate. Despite extensive biochemical and structural studies of helicases, the mechanism of DNA unwinding remains obscure, and several enzymatic features of the RecQ family helicases are not clearly understood. As mentioned above for other helicases, the oligomeric status of the active E. coli RecQ helicase is unclear, because enzymologic studies of the unwinding reaction in pre-steady-state conditions have strongly suggested that the active form is monomeric (26.Zhang X.D.

Kowalczykowski S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 232-243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Other difficulties in the interpretation of enzymatic parameters are related to side phenomena that strongly influence the measurement of helicase activity, such as: (i) the DNA rehybridization that occurs after the unwinding process; and (ii) the ability of helicase to bind to the single-stranded DNA product, reducing subsequent turnover. The relative impact of these intrinsic properties of the DNA and helicase molecules, respectively, may be difficult to estimate depending on the method used for monitoring unwinding activity (28.Xu H.Q. Zhang A.H. Auclair C. Xi X.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: e70Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar).

However, this approach, based on the determination of the diffusion coefficient, is not very sensitive for measuring interactions between molecules or dissociation events when the two interacting entities have similar molecular sizes. This major limitation can be overcome by dual color fluorescence cross-correlation spectroscopy (FCCS), which can be used to monitor the cross-correlation of the fluorescence fluctuations of the two interacting species, labeled by spectrally distinct fluorophores, and then to quantify the amount of fluorescently double-labeled species. A maximal cross-correlation amplitude is obtained when the two molecular species diffuse simultaneously and in a systematic manner through the observed volume, indicating a physical interaction, whereas a decrease in this amplitude accounts for independent diffusion due to a dissociation event. This approach has been shown suitable for monitoring various enzymatic activities or processes, including proteolysis (32.Kohl T. Haustein E. Schwille P. Biophys. J. 2005; 89: 2770-2782Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), endonucleolytic cleavage by restriction enzymes (33.Rarbach M. Kettling U. Koltermann A. Eigen M.

We describe here the use of two-photon excitation FCCS to monitor helicase unwinding activity. This assay is sensitive and suitable for studies of unwinding activity, as it can be used for real-time kinetic studies in the low nanomolar range, is compatible with both single and multiple turnover enzymatic conditions, and does not require separation of the single-stranded (ss) DNA product from the double-stranded (ds) DNA substrate by gel electrophoresis. As mentioned above, the cross-correlation of the two fluorescence signals in FCCS is related to the concomitant diffusion of the two fluorescently labeled molecules. Thus, with double-labeled dsDNA substrates, a significant decrease in the amplitude of the cross-correlation function is expected upon DNA unwinding, due to the physical separation of the two labeled DNA strands (the principle of the FCCS-based helicase assay is explained in Fig. 1A). Unlike the fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) approach, FCCS is not sensitive to fluorophore orientation and/or interfluorophore distance. The loss of the cross-correlation signal is sensitive to helicase-mediated strand separation only, with no influence of other phenomena such as unrelated local motions of fluorophores at the DNA ends, which may also affect the donor-acceptor distance. A helicase assay based on fluorescence anisotropy was recently described, but real-time kinetic studies suffer from inherent problems because of the ability of helicase to bind to the ssDNA product (28.Xu H.Q. Zhang A.H. Auclair C. Xi X.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: e70Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Moreover, this assay was compatible with single turnover conditions only (i.e. enzyme concentration exceeding DNA substrate). The FCCS assay has no such limitations because it is not based on a difference in size between the substrate and the reaction product but on the extent of the concomitant diffusion of the two DNA strands. In this work, we studied the unwinding activity of E. coli RecQ helicase, under both single and multiple turnover conditions, by FCCS. We found that RecQ helicase monomers may function cooperatively or non-cooperatively. Their mode of functioning depends on several parameters, including the length of the DNA substrate (with significant influence from both the duplex and the 3′-ssDNA-flanking regions) and the temperature at which the DNA binding step occurs. Remarkably, the cooperative properties of helicase at the DNA binding level, i.e. helicase binding to the DNA substrate, were found to be predictive, at least qualitatively, of subsequent cooperative effects observed at the catalytic level. Additionally, a post-catalytic event, i.e. helicase binding to newly unwound ssDNA products, was shown also to contribute to the observed functional cooperativity. We also found that the cooperative dependence of the unwinding activity on ATP concentration originated indirectly from the cooperative DNA binding mode of RecQ helicase, reconciling apparently conflicting published results concerning the possibility of an active monomeric form, whereas the activity displays a strong cooperativity on ATP concentration (Hill coefficient ≈ 3), which was interpreted previously as compelling evidence for a multimeric active form (minimally trimeric) (27.Harmon F.G. Kowalczykowski S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 232-243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Altogether, our data indicate that oligomerization is not a prerequisite for RecQ helicase activity. Nevertheless, in certain conditions, the cooperative assembly of the helicase-DNA complex makes it possible for multiple monomers to align along the same DNA substrate and function in a cooperative manner. Finally, we further examined the influences on the unwinding activity (as measured in our assay) of both spontaneous DNA rehybridization (following helicase translocation) and the ssDNA binding property of helicase. We addressed these questions by evaluating the effects of short single-stranded oligodeoxyribonucleotides (ssODN) and of the single-stranded DNA-binding protein (SSB) on the catalytic rate constant of RecQ helicase. The E. coli RecQ helicases, wild-type and mutant proteins K53A and D146A, were purified as described previously (28.Xu H.Q. Zhang A.H. Auclair C. Xi X.G.

Unlabeled and fluorescently labeled oligonucleotides (Table 1) were purchased from Eurogentec (Liege, Belgium) and further purified by electrophoresis in a denaturing 12 or 15% acrylamide/urea gel for long (>10 mer) and short (7 and 10 mer) oligonucleotides, respectively. Double-stranded DNAs were obtained by mixing equimolar amounts of complementary DNA strands in 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.2), 100 mm NaCl. The mixture was heated at 85 °C for 5 min and allowed to anneal by slow cooling to 25 °C.TABLE 1Nomenclature and sequences of oligonucleotides used in this studyNameaThe size of the ss-3′-tail is indicated in parentheses.LengthSequencebBases corresponding to non-complementary ss-3′-tails are underlined.A7*Al75′-GTC AGT G-3′-AlB775′-GTC AGT G-3′B′775′-CGT GAT G-3′C10*Al105′-TTA GTC AGT G-3′-AlD10105′-TTA GTC AGT G-3′D′10105′-TTG CGT GAT A-3′E22*Al225′-AAT CCG TCG AGC AGA GTT AGG G-3′-AlF13*Al(10)235′-CAG ACT CCC TAG A AGTTAGGGTT-3′-AlG13*Te(10)235′-TCT AGG GAG TCT G GATTGTTATT-3′-TeH13(10)235′-TCT AGG GAG TCT G GATTGTTATT-3′I22*Al(10)cI22*Al(20), I22*Al(30), Q45*Al(20), and Q45*Al(30) are the equivalent oligonucleotides with a longer ss-3′-tail: 20 nucleotides (AGTTAGGGTTTTTTTTTTTA-3′) for I22*Al(20)and Q45*Al(20) and 30 nucleotides (AGTTAGGGTTTTTTTTTTTAAGTTAGGGTA-3′) for I22*Al(30) and Q45*Al(30).325′-AAT CCG TCG AGC AGA GTT AGG G AGTTAGGGTT-3′-AlJ22*Te(10)dJ22*Te(20), J22*Te(30), R45*Te(20), and R45*Te(30) are the equivalent oligonucleotides with a longer ss-3′-tail: 20 nucleotides (GATTGTTATTTTTTTTTTTA-3′) for J22*Te(20)and R45*Te(20) and 30 nucleotides (GATTGTTATTTTTTTTTTTAGATTGTTATA-3′) for J22*Te(30) and R45*Te(30).325′-CCC TAA CTC TGC TCG ACG GAT T GATTGTTATT-3′-TeK22(10)325′-AAT CCG TCG AGC AGA GTT AGG G AGTTAGGGTT-3′L22(10)325′-CCC TAA CTC TGC TCG ACG GAT T GATTGTTATT-3′M32325′-AAT CCG TCG AGC AGA GTT AGG AGA TCC CTC AG-3′N45*Al455′-AGA TCC CTC AGA CCC TTT TAG TCA GTG TGG AAA ATC TCT AGC AGT-3′-AlO45*Te455′-ACT GCT AGA GAT TTT CCA CAC TGA CTA AAA GGG TCT GAG GGA TCT-3′-TeP45455′-ACT GCT AGA GAT TTT CCA CAC TGA CTA AAA GGG TCT GAG GGA TCT-3′Q45*Al(10)cI22*Al(20), I22*Al(30), Q45*Al(20), and Q45*Al(30) are the equivalent oligonucleotides with a longer ss-3′-tail: 20 nucleotides (AGTTAGGGTTTTTTTTTTTA-3′) for I22*Al(20)and Q45*Al(20) and 30 nucleotides (AGTTAGGGTTTTTTTTTTTAAGTTAGGGTA-3′) for I22*Al(30) and Q45*Al(30).555′-AGA TCC CTC AGA CCC TTT TAG TCA GTG TGG AAA ATC TCT AGC AGT AGTTAGGGTT-3′-AlR45*Te(10)dJ22*Te(20), J22*Te(30), R45*Te(20), and R45*Te(30) are the equivalent oligonucleotides with a longer ss-3′-tail: 20 nucleotides (GATTGTTATTTTTTTTTTTA-3′) for J22*Te(20)and R45*Te(20) and 30 nucleotides (GATTGTTATTTTTTTTTTTAGATTGTTATA-3′) for J22*Te(30) and R45*Te(30).555′-ACT GCT AGA GAT TTT CCA CAC TGA CTA AAA GGG TCT GAG GGA TCT GATTGTTATT-3′-TeS45(10)555′-ACT GCT AGA GAT TTT CCA CAC TGA CTA AAA GGG TCT GAG GGA TCT GATTGTTATT-3′T66*Al665′-AAT CCG TCG AGC AGA GTT AGG AGA TCC CTC AGA CCC TTT TAG TCA GTG TGG AAA ATC TCT AGC AGT-3′-AlU66*Te665′-ACT GCT AGA GAT TTT CCA CAC TGA CTA AAA GGG TCT GAG GGA TCT CCT AAC TCT GCT CGA CGG ATT-3′-TeV66665′-ACT GCT AGA GAT TTT CCA CAC TGA CTA AAA GGG TCT GAG GGA TCT CCT AAC TCT GCT CGA CGG ATT-3′W66*Al(10)765′-AAT CCG TCG AGC AGA GTT AGG AGA TCC CTC AGA CCC TTT TAG TCA GTG TGG AAA ATC TCT AGC AGT AGTTAGGGTT-3′-AlX66*Te(10)765′-ACT GCT AGA GAT TTT CCA CAC TGA CTA AAA GGG TCT GAG GGA TCT CCT AAC TCT GCT CGA CGG ATT GATTGTTATT-3′-TeY66(10)765′-AAT CCG TCG AGC AGA GTT AGG AGA TCC CTC AGA CCC TTT TAG TCA GTG TGG AAA ATC TCT AGC AGT AGTTAGGGTT-3′Z66(10)765′-ACT GCT AGA GAT TTT CCA CAC TGA CTA AAA GGG TCT GAG GGA TCT CCT AAC TCT GCT CGA CGG ATT GATTGTTATT-3′a The size of the ss-3′-tail is indicated in parentheses.b Bases corresponding to non-complementary ss-3′-tails are underlined.c I22*Al(20), I22*Al(30), Q45*Al(20), and Q45*Al(30) are the equivalent oligonucleotides with a longer ss-3′-tail: 20 nucleotides (AGTTAGGGTTTTTTTTTTTA-3′) for I22*Al(20)and Q45*Al(20) and 30 nucleotides (AGTTAGGGTTTTTTTTTTTAAGTTAGGGTA-3′) for I22*Al(30) and Q45*Al(30).d J22*Te(20), J22*Te(30), R45*Te(20), and R45*Te(30) are the equivalent oligonucleotides with a longer ss-3′-tail: 20 nucleotides (GATTGTTATTTTTTTTTTTA-3′) for J22*Te(20)and R45*Te(20) and 30 nucleotides (GATTGTTATTTTTTTTTTTAGATTGTTATA-3′) for J22*Te(30) and R45*Te(30). Open table in a new tab Dual color FCCS measurements were performed by two-photon excitation using a single laser line on a home-built system (described previously in Ref. 38.Delelis O. Carayon K.

Briefly, the laser beam was expanded with a two-lens afocal system to overfill the back aperture of the objective (Nikon, Plan Apo, ×100, N.A. 1.4, oil immersion) before its entry via the epifluorescence port of the microscope. The setup was optimized to obtain a diffraction-limited focal spot. Measurements were typically carried out in 50 μl of solution dropped onto a coverslip treated with dimethyldichlorosilane. The fluorescence signals from Alexa Fluor 488 (Alexa488 (Al)) and Texas Red (Te) were collected with the same objective and separated from the excitation by a dichroic mirror (Chroma 700DCSPXR). The output signal from the microscope was further filtered with a Chroma E700SP-2p filter to reject the residual excitation light and split by a dichroic mirror (Chroma 580dcxr). Additional filters (Chroma HQ510/50 and HQ630/60m-2p for Alexa488 and Texas Red, respectively) were used to minimize cross-talk (Fig. 1B), and the split fluorescence signal was focused on two avalanche photodiodes (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, SPCM-AQR-14 single photon counting module with less than 90 dark counts/s) mounted at right angle. The detectors were connected to a digital correlator (ALV 6000, ALV-GmbH, Langen, Germany) for calculation of the normalized cross-correlation function gAl/Te(τ) (or g(τ)) of the two fluorescence intensity fluctuations, according to Equation 1, gA1/Te(τ)=⟨lG(t)⋅lR(t+τ)⟩⟨lG(t)⋅lR(t)⟩(Eq. 1) where IG(t) and IR(t) are the number of detected fluorescence photons per time unit for the green (Alexa488) and red (Texas Red) channels, respectively. Assuming a three-dimensional Gaussian distribution of excitation intensity, the cross-correlation function for a free Brownian diffusion process is given by Equation 2, gA11Te(τ)=1n⋅1(1+ττo)⋅1+ω02Z02⋅ττD(Eq. 2) with1n=CA1/TeV(CA1+CA1/Te)×(CTe+CA1/Te) where CAl and CTe are the concentrations of singly labeled species, CAl/Te is the concentration of doubly fluorescently labeled species, and τD is the corresponding translational diffusion time. ω0 and z0 are the lateral and axial dimensions of the excitation volume (V), respectively. The excitation volume was calibrated with a 5 nm aqueous solution of Alexa Fluor 488 (succinimidyl ester, Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR; diffusion coefficient, D = 426.3 μm2/s at 21 °C). The excitation wavelength was 780 nm, and the excitation power was 25 milliwatts. Assuming a Gaussian beam shape and according to Equation 2 and τD = ω02/8D, the lateral ω0 and axial z0 dimensions were estimated at 0.380 and 1.40 μm, respectively. The optimal two-photon excitation wavelength for the FCCS experiments using Alexa488 and Texas Red was found to be 780 nm. In this study, we found that an excitation power of 25 milliwatts was suitable for the two-photon excitation of both Alexa488 and Texas Red (fluorescence intensities displayed quadratic dependences and τD values were constant as a function of incident power below 30 milliwatts. Photobleaching occurred principally above 30 milliwatts). The excitation power was adjusted with a variable attenuator consisting of an achromatic half-wave plate and a polarizing beam splitter (Micro-Controle Spectra-Physics, Evry, France). Recording times were typically between 2.5 and 5 min (average of 5–10 cycles of 30 s each). The cross-correlation curves were fitted with a Levenberg-Marquardt nonlinear least-squares fitting algorithm according to the analytical model (Equation 2) using Igor software (WaveMetrics). The decrease in the amplitude of the cross-correlation, g(0) value, was used to calculate unwinding activity as a function of time, according to Equation 3, [DNA]unwound[DNA]total=g(0)t=0−g(0)tg(0)t=0−g(0)t→∞(Eq. 3) with g(0)t=0 and g(0)t→∞ corresponding to the cross-correlation amplitudes at the beginning (zero time) and at the end (infinite time) of the reaction, respectively. The unwinding activity of the RecQ helicase was measured by dual color FCCS (description of the FCCS setup given above) in 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.2), 40 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, and 0.3 mm dithiothreitol (reaction buffer). The concentration of the double-labeled DNA substrate was typically 5 nm. The DNA binding step (performed at T°binding = 25 or 37 °C) corresponded to the addition of RecQ helicase to the DNA solution. The unwinding reaction was initiated by adding 1 mm ATP and recorded at T°reaction = 25 °C (unless otherwise stated). For multiple turnover experiments ([DNA substrate] > [RecQ helicase]), the various concentrations of total DNA substrate were obtained by mixing double-labeled DNA substrate (constant concentration of 5 nm) with different concentrations of the corresponding unlabeled DNA substrate. ̃nACT, the Hill coefficient characterizing the functional cooperativity, was calculated by fitting the sigmoidal dependence of unwinding activity on the enzyme concentration using the Hill function of Origin 6.0 software. The interaction between RecQ helicase and Alexa488-labeled DNA (either double- or single-stranded) was detected by determining steady-state fluorescence anisotropy on a Beacon 2000 instrument (PanVera, Madison, WI) (28.Xu H.Q.

The apparent Kd value (Kd,app) was determined by incubating Alexa488-labeled DNA (5 nm) with increasing concentrations of RecQ helicase in 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.2), 40 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, and 0.3 mm dithiothreitol. Steady-state anisotropy (r) was then recorded. Fractional saturation was calculated as Δr/Δrmax = (r − rfree)/(rbound − rfree), where rbound and rfree represent bound and free DNA anisotropy, respectively. The Hill coefficient, ̃nBIND, was calculated by directly fitting the titration curve using the Hill function of Origin 6.0 software. Kd,app represents the concentration of RecQ helicase required to titrate the DNA to half saturation.

https://openalex.org/W2006453814,"Small molecule regulation of cell function is an understudied area of trypanosomatid biology. In Trypanosoma brucei diacylglycerol (DAG) stimulates endocytosis of transferrin (Tf). However, it is not known whether other trypanosomatidae respond similarly to the lipid. Further, the biochemical pathways involved in DAG signaling to the endocytic system in T. brucei are unknown, as the parasite genome does not encode canonical DAG receptors (e.g. C1-domains). We established that DAG stimulates endocytosis of Tf in Leishmania major, and we evaluated possible effector enzymes in the pathway with multiple approaches. First, a heterologously expressed glycosylphosphatidylinositol phospholipase C (GPI-PLC) activated endocytosis of Tf 300% in L. major. Second, exogenous phorbol ester and DAGs promoted Tf endocytosis in L. major. In search of possible effectors of DAG signaling, we discovered a novel C1-like domain (i.e. C1_5) in trypanosomatids, and we identified protein Tyr kinases (PTKs) linked with C1_5 domains in T. brucei, T. cruzi, and L. major. Consequently, we hypothesized that trypanosome PTKs might be effector enzymes for DAG signaling. General uptake of Tf was reduced by inhibitors of either Ser/Thr or Tyr kinases. However, DAG-stimulated endocytosis of Tf was blocked only by an inhibitor of PTKs, in both T. brucei and L. major. We conclude that (i) DAG activates Tf endocytosis in L. major, and that (ii) PTKs are effectors of DAG-stimulated endocytosis of Tf in trypanosomatids. DAG-stimulated endocytosis of Tf may be a T. brucei adaptation to compete effectively with host cells for vertebrate Tf in blood, since DAG does not enhance endocytosis of Tf in human cells."
https://openalex.org/W2079359832,"Background Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a metabolic disorder characterized by disturbances of carbohydrate, fat and protein metabolism and insulin resistance. The majority of T2D patients are obese and obesity by itself may be a cause of insulin resistance. Our aim was to evaluate whether the recently identified T2D risk alleles are associated with human measures of fatness as characterized with Dual Energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DEXA). Methodology/Principal Findings Genotypes and phenotypes of approximately 3,000 participants from cross-sectional ERF study were analyzed. Nine single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in CDKN2AB, CDKAL1, FTO, HHEX, IGF2BP2, KCNJ11, PPARG, SLC30A8 and TCF7L2 were genotyped. We used linear regression to study association between individual SNPs and the combined allelic risk score with body mass index (BMI), fat mass index (FMI), fat percentage (FAT), waist circumference (WC) and waist to hip ratio (WHR). Significant association was observed between rs8050136 (FTO) and BMI (p = 0.003), FMI (p = 0.007) and WC (p = 0.03); fat percentage was borderline significant (p = 0.053). No other SNPs alone or combined in a risk score demonstrated significant association to the measures of fatness. Conclusions/Significance From the recently identified T2D risk variants only the risk variant of the FTO gene (rs8050136) showed statistically significant association with BMI, FMI, and WC."

These studies were conducted to determine how p66(shc) alters IGF-I-stimulated Src activation, leading to decreased IGF-I actions. Our results show that p66(shc) binds to Src through a polyproline sequence motif contained in the CH2 domain, a unique domain in p66(shc), and IGF-I stimulates this interaction. Disruption of this interaction using a synthetic peptide containing the p66(shc) polyproline domain or expression of a p66(shc) mutant containing substitutions for the proline residues (P47A/P48A/P50A) resulted in enhanced Src kinase activity, p52(shc) phosphorylation, MAPK activation, and cell proliferation in response to IGF-I. To determine the mechanism of inhibition, the full-length CH2 domain and intact p66(shc) were tested for their ability to directly inhibit Src kinase activation in vitro. The CH2 domain peptide was clearly inhibitory, but full-length p66(shc) had a greater effect. Deletion of the C-terminal Src homology 2 domain in p66(shc) reduced its ability to inhibit Src kinase activation. These findings demonstrate that p66(shc) utilizes a novel mechanism for modulating Src kinase activation and that this interaction is mediated through both its collagen homologous region 2 and Src homology 2 domains."
https://openalex.org/W2004593059,"Saccharomyces cerevisiae Esc2p is a member of a conserved family of proteins that contain small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO)-like domains. It has been implicated in transcriptional silencing and shown to interact with the silencing protein Sir2p in a two-hybrid analysis. However, little is known about how Esc2p regulates the structure of silent chromatin. We demonstrate here that ESC2 differentially regulates silent chromatin at telomeric, rDNA, and HM loci. Specifically, ESC2 is required for efficient telomeric silencing and Sir2p association with telomeric silent chromatin and for silencing and maintenance of silent chromatin structure at rDNA. On the other hand, ESC2 negatively regulates silencing at HML and HMR and destabilizes HML silent chromatin without affecting Sir2p association with chromatin. We present evidence that Esc2p is associated with both transcriptionally silent and active loci in the genome, and the abundance of Esc2p is not correlated with the chromatin state at a particular locus. Using affinity pull-down analyses, we show that Esc2p and Sir2p interact in vivo, and recombinant Esc2p and Sir2p interact directly. Moreover, we dissect Esc2p and identify a putative SUMO-binding motif that is necessary and sufficient for interacting with Sir2p and SUMO and is required for the function of Esc2p in transcriptional silencing."
https://openalex.org/W2056731649,"Long-term influenza evolution has been well studied, but the patterns of sequence diversity within seasons are less clear. H3N2 influenza genomes sampled from New York State over ten years indicated intraseasonal changes in evolutionary dynamics. Using the mean Hamming distance of a set of amino acid or nucleotide sequences as an indicator of its diversity, we found that influenza sequence diversity was significantly higher during the early epidemic period than later in the influenza season. Diversity was lowest during the peak of the epidemic, most likely due to the high prevalence of a single dominant amino acid sequence or very few dominant sequences during the peak epidemic period, corresponding with rapid expansion of the viral population. The frequency and duration of dominant sequences varied by influenza protein, but all proteins had an abundance of one distinct sequence during the peak epidemic period. In New York State from 1995 to 2005, high sequence diversity during the early epidemic suggested that seasonal antigenic drift could have occurred primarily in this period, followed by a clonal expansion of typically one clade during the peak of the epidemic, possibly indicating a shift to neutral drift or purifying selection."

Substitution of the activation loop phosphorylation site (Ser-221) in the NTK with the negatively charged Asp residue abrogated the association between RSK1 and PKARIalpha. This explains the lack of an interaction between active RSK1 and PKARIalpha. Full-length RSK1 bound to PKARIalpha with an affinity of 0.8 nm. The NTK domain of RSK1 competed with PKAc for binding to the pseudosubstrate region (amino acids 93-99) of PKARIalpha. Overexpressed RSK1 dissociated PKAc from PKARIalpha, increasing PKAc activity, whereas silencing of RSK1 increased PKAc/PKARIalpha interactions and decreased PKAc activity. Unlike PKAc, which requires Arg-95 and -96 in the pseudosubstrate region of PKARIalpha for their interactions, RSK1/PKARIalpha association requires all four Arg residues (Arg-93-96) in the pseudosubstrate site of PKARIalpha. A peptide (Wt-PS) corresponding to residues 91-99 of PKARIalpha competed for binding of RSK1 with PKARIalpha both in vitro and in intact cells. Furthermore, peptide Wt-PS (but not control peptide Mut-PS), by dissociating RSK1 from PKARIalpha, activated RSK1 in the absence of any growth factors and protected cells from apoptosis. Thus, by competing for binding to the pseudosubstrate region of PKARIalpha, RSK1 regulates PKAc activity in a cAMP-independent manner, and PKARIalpha by associating with RSK1 regulates its activation and its biological functions."

Cowpea bruchids dramatically induce CmCatB expression when major digestive proteases are inactivated by dietary scN, which is presumably an adaptive strategy that insects use to minimize effects of nutrient deficiency. In this study, we cloned the cowpea bruchid hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 (CmHNF-4) and demonstrated its involvement in transcriptional activation of CmCatB in the digestive tract of scN-adapted bruchids. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays demonstrated that CmHNF-4 binds to a CmCatB promoter region containing two tandem chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter (COUP) sites, which is also the cis-element for Seven-up (CmSvp), a previously identified transcriptional repressor of CmCatB. Although CmSvp is predominantly expressed in unadapted insect midgut, CmHNF-4 is more abundant in adapted bruchids. When transiently expressed in Drosophila S2 cells, CmHNF-4 substantially increased CmCatB expression through COUP binding. CmSvp inhibited CmHNF-4-mediated transcriptional activation even in the absence of its DNA-binding domain. Thus antagonism resulted, at least in part, from protein-protein interactions between CmSvp and CmHNF-4. Association of the two transcription factors was subsequently confirmed by glutathione S-transferase pulldown assays. Interestingly, anti-CmHNF-4 serum caused a supershift not only with nuclear extracts of scN-adapted insect midgut but with that of unadapted control insects as well. The presence of CmHNF-4 in unadapted insects further supported the idea that interplay between CmSvp and CmHNF-4 controls CmCatB transcription activation. Together, these results suggest that coordination between CmHNF-4 and CmSvp is important in counter-defense gene regulation in insects.

IntroductionThe battle between plants and herbivorous insects employs a variety of defense and counter-defense strategies. Insect feeding elicits synthesis of a wide array of plant-defensive compounds, which in turn induce insect counteractive tactics to minimize the impact of plant defense. Analysis of these plant-pest interactions has become a research hotspot for understanding insect counter-defense mechanisms. Many insect survival mechanisms involve remodeling of the insect digestive system. Adjustments in cells lining the digestive tract allow pests to deal with a variety of plant toxins and anti-nutritional metabolites and are crucial for insect survival.A number of studies on insect response to plant protease inhibitors indicate that one of the tactics used by insects is activation of inhibitor-insensitive digestive enzymes (1.Bolter C.J.

Under regular growth conditions, these inhibitor-insensitive enzymes are often in low abundance, accounting for only a minor portion of the entire proteolytic activity. They can be strongly induced, however, and play an important role in protein degradation once the major digestive enzyme function is blocked. The cowpea bruchid (Callosobruchus maculatus) cathepsin B-like cysteine protease (CmCatB) 2The abbreviations used are: CmCatBC. maculatus cathepsin B-like cysteine proteaseCOUPchicken ovalbumin upstream promoter elementCOUP-TFCOUP-transcription factorscNsoybean cysteine protease inhibitorSvpSeven-upHNF-4hepatocyte nuclear factor 4EMSAelectrophoretic mobility shift assayDTTdithiothreitolDBDDNA-binding domainLBDligand-binding E domainRACErapid amplification of cDNA endsRTreverse transcriptionqRTquantitative RTCATchloramphenicol acetyltransferaseS2Schneider 2 cellGSTglutathione S-transferase. has been shown to be such an enzyme. The cowpea bruchid is a grain storage insect pest; its larvae feed and develop inside seeds. Adults no longer feed after emergence from infested seeds but mate and lay eggs on the surface of cowpea seeds. Multiple generations of the insect per year lead to severe grain damage.CmCatB, which is solely expressed in larvae (6.Koo Y.D. Ahn J.E. Salzman R.A. Moon J. Chi Y.H. Yun D.J. Lee S.Y. Koiwa H. Zhu-Salzman K. Insect Mol. Biol. 2008; 17: 235-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), was identified as one of the midgut genes that was most highly induced by dietary scN in a cDNA microarray, although it was undetectable in insects feeding on regular diet (8.Moon J. Salzman R.A. Ahn J.E. Koiwa H. Zhu-Salzman K. Insect Mol. Biol. 2004; 13: 283-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Expression of CmCatB protein revealed that it possesses cathepsin B-like cysteine protease activity. Interestingly, this proteolytic activity was unaffected by scN, in marked contrast to the major cathepsin L-like digestive enzymes that share similar tertiary structures with CmCatB (6.Koo Y.D.

Most likely, the occluding loop in CmCatB blocked access of inhibitor to the enzyme catalytic site, which has been demonstrated for its human ortholog (10.Illy C. Quraishi O. Wang J. Purisima E.

Protease activity that is insensitive to scN no doubt helps to alleviate nutrient deficiency when major digestive enzymes are inhibited by scN, thus enabling insects to regain normal feeding and development (7.Zhu-Salzman K. Koiwa H. Salzman R.A. Shade R.E. Ahn J.E. Insect Mol. Biol. 2003; 12: 135-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar).The scN-induced expression pattern and scN-insensitive proteolytic activity suggest that CmCatB has a unique role in insect adaptation to the effect of dietary scN. In an effort to understand CmCatB transcriptional regulation, we cloned a CmCatB promoter and adopted electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) to identify potential regulatory elements using nuclear extracts from bruchid midgut tissue (12.Ahn J.E. Guarino L.A. Zhu-Salzman K. FEBS J. 2007; 274: 2800-2814Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). We detected retarded bands of different mobility in control (scN-unadapted) and scN-fed (-adapted) insects, which implies that different binding proteins might be interacting with the CmCatB promoter in the two insect groups. In unchallenged control insects, we demonstrated that specific association of a COUP-element and CmSvp, a homolog of the COUP-interacting transcription factor (COUP-TF), resulted in repression of CmCatB (12.Ahn J.E. Guarino L.A. Zhu-Salzman K. FEBS J. 2007; 274: 2800-2814Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Its high abundance in unadapted insects and reduced expression in adapted insects supported the repressor function. Identities of the cis- and trans-regulators in scN-adapted insect midgut remained to be elucidated.Because CmSvp is apparently involved in negative regulation of the insect counter-defense gene, we speculated that the binding protein detected in nuclear extracts of scN-adapted insect midgut was an activator that promoted CmCatB expression. This hypothesis would be consistent with the observed high induction of CmCatB in scN-adapted bruchid midgut. To test this hypothesis and to obtain a more comprehensive understanding of insect adaptive mechanisms, we herein report on our investigation of this potential positive regulator, which appears to be a hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 (HNF-4). In addition, we have gained insight into the intimate relationship and coordinated activities of CmHNF-4 and CmSvp.DISCUSSIONHNF-4 is a transcription factor that belongs to the nuclear receptor superfamily. It is most abundant in liver, kidney, and small intestine in vertebrates and in the functionally analogous fat body, malpighian tubules, and midgut in insects. The conserved sequences and tissue preference from insects to mammals reflects its conserved function through evolution. HNF-4 activates a large number of genes that are crucial for development (18.Kapitskaya M.Z. Dittmer N.T. Deitsch K.W. Cho W.L. Taylor D.G. Leff T. Raikhel A.S. J. Biol.

It is also a key regulator of metabolic pathways that involve lipid and glucose homeostasis (15.Sladek F.M. Seidel S.D. Burris T.P. McCabe E.R.B. Nuclear Receptors and Genetic Disease. Academic Press, San Diego, CA2001: 309-361Google Scholar). In addition, it modulates transcriptional expression of cytochrome P450 genes functional in detoxification of foreign chemical compounds (25.Cairns W. Smith C.A. McLaren A.W. Wolf C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25269-25276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 35.Holloway M.G. Miles G.D. Dombkowski A.A. Waxman D.J. Mol.

Our results revealed a new aspect to the already widespread impacts of HNF-4. We found that HNF-4 contributes to reconfiguration of insect counter-defense genes in the midgut under dietary challenge, and that it does so in coordination with another transcription factor Svp.We hypothesized that CmHNF-4 was a positive regulator of CmCatB, after the cis-element was identified, based on several factors. First, HNF-4 is known to regulate many genes essential for nutrient metabolism and chemical detoxification (15.Sladek F.M. Seidel S.D. Burris T.P. McCabe E.R.B. Nuclear Receptors and Genetic Disease. Academic Press, San Diego, CA2001: 309-361Google Scholar). Although not previously investigated for its regulatory action on proteases, we believe that CmHNF-4 could potentially target CmCatB. Induction of CmCatB facilitates food protein degradation and amino acid assimilation in insects that are under dietary challenge, consistent with a metabolic role of the transcription factor. Second, the COUP-element identified in the CmCatB promoter exhibits the important features of an ideal binding site for HNF-4 (15.Sladek F.M. Seidel S.D. Burris T.P. McCabe E.R.B. Nuclear Receptors and Genetic Disease. Academic Press, San Diego, CA2001: 309-361Google Scholar). These features include 1) two direct repeats of a half-site are separated by one nucleotide, 2) triple adenines forming the center of the site, and 3) a conserved guanine in the second positions of all half-sites (Fig. 1A). Third, HNF-4 is a positive regulator that shares closely related binding specificities with COUP-TF (or Svp in insects). Several genes have been shown to be coordinately regulated by the two transcription factors (14.Ktistaki E. Talianidis I. Mol. Cell.

Guarino L.A. Zhu-Salzman K. FEBS J. 2007; 274: 2800-2814Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Here we showed that, although CmSvp inhibited CmCatB expression, CmHNF-4 promoted its transcription when transiently expressed in Drosophila S2 cells (Fig. 6). This activity, however, was repressed by CmSvp (Fig. 7). The inverse relationship of CmHNF-4 and CmSvp protein abundance in the two insect groups (Fig. 4) is in agreement with their antagonistic function in CmCatB regulation.Competing for occupancy of the common binding sites has been the typical inhibitory mechanism of HNF-4-mediated transcriptional activation by COUP-TF/Svp (25.Cairns W.

Biophys. 2002; 398: 79-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). For instance, HNF-4 and COUP-TF bind to the C3P site of apolipoprotein CIII promoter in a mutually exclusive manner. Replacing the DNA-binding domain of COUP-TF resulted in the loss of antagonism of HNF-4 transactivation of a lipid-binding protein apoCIII (28.Mietus-Snyder M. Sladek F.M. Ginsburg G.S. Kuo C.F. Ladias J.A. Darnell Jr., J.E. Karathanasis S.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1708-1718Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Similarly, activation of the hypoxia-specific erythropoietin gene via HNF-4 is repressed by COUP-TF (26.Galson D.L. Tsuchiya T. Tendler D.S. Huang L.E. Ren Y. Ogura T. Bunn H.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2135-2144Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). The promoter and enhancer regions of rat ornithine transcarbamylase consist of four cis-elements that interact with both HNF-4 and COUP-TF, which have opposing effects (27.Kimura A. Nishiyori A. Murakami T. Tsukamoto T. Hata S. Osumi T. Okamura R. Mori M. Takiguchi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11125-11133Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Balancing positive HNF-4 and negative COUP-TF regulators that bind the common cis-element was also considered a predominant mechanism regulating human P450 CYP2D6 gene expression (25.Cairns W. Smith C.A. McLaren A.W. Wolf C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25269-25276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Cowpea bruchids may have adopted a similar mechanism of regulation; that is, in unchallenged insect midgut, when CmCatB is not needed, the COUP-element was occupied by repressor CmSvp due to its relatively high concentration (Fig. 4C), but in nuclear extracts from adapted insects where CmSvp is scarce, increased CmHNF-4 could replace CmSvp and activate CmCatB. Expression of CmCatB enables food protein degradation even in the presence of the inhibitor scN. However, the DNA binding domain was not required for CmSvp to repress CmHNF-4-mediated activation; even in the absence of CmSvp binding to COUP-element, protein-protein interaction between CmSvp and CmHNF-4 was able to repress transcription (Fig. 8). Thus competition for the same cis-element, a well known antagonistic mode of action between HNF-4 and COUP-TF/Svp, need not be the sole mechanism for CmCatB regulation. Protein-protein interaction presumably at least in part contributes to modulation of CmCatB promoter activity in cowpea bruchids (FIGURE 8, FIGURE 9, FIGURE 10).CmSvp repression of CmHNF-4 function through protein-protein interaction is supported by supershift assays using anti-CmHNF-4 antibody (Fig. 9A). Apparently, rather than being excluded from the cis-element, CmHNF-4 was a component of the DNA-protein complex in unchallenged insects. Protein association between COUP-TF/Svp and HNF-4 has so far only been known to enhance HNF-4 transactivation where COUP-TF acts as an auxiliary coactivator (14.Ktistaki E. Talianidis I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2790-2797Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 41.Eeckhoute J. Oxombre B. Formstecher P. Lefebvre P. Laine B. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 6640-6650Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). In these cases, COUP-TF itself did not bind to the promoters, but oriented HNF-4 through the HNF-4 LBD in a more efficient configuration to elicit synergistic transcriptional activity. In our experiment, protein-protein interaction apparently led to a silencing effect, opposite to these reported studies. In vitro experiments suggested that CmHNF-4 interacted with CmSvp through its LBD domain upstream AF2 activation domain (Fig. 10D). Helix H7 of human HNF-4, corresponding to amino acid residues 294–310 in CmHNF-4, has been shown to be important for recruitment of coactivators. Deletion of the Glu in H7 (Glu302 in CmHNF-4) abolished recruitment COUP-TF (41.Eeckhoute J. Oxombre B. Formstecher P. Lefebvre P. Laine B. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 6640-6650Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The significance of Glu302 is not yet known, and more experiments are needed to locate the exact interacting residues in CmHNF-4.It should be noted that, although protein contact alone is sufficient for CmSvp to repress CmHNF-4 function (Fig. 8), it does not exclude binding of CmSvp to the COUP site. Indeed, the presence of two adjacent COUP-elements renders the possibility of each transcription factor binding to one element, and the closeness of the two cis-elements could enable protein contact while binding. CmSvp without a COUP-binding domain, i.e. Gal4-CmSvp(D,E,F), exhibited basal CAT activity, whereas unaltered CmSvp showed further repression. Therefore, although the DNA binding domain was not essential for CmSvp to repress CmHNF-4-mediated activation, it certainly enhances the impact of CmSvp's negative regulation of CmCatB. In the model shown in Fig. 11, we incorporated DNA-protein and protein-protein combined interactions to illustrate the molecular antagonistic mechanism; binding to the COUP site could help anchor CmSvp and stabilize its association with CmHNF-4. Such association likely masks the activation surface of CmHNF-4, resulting in transcription inhibition in unadapted insects. Binding to DNA near a DNA-bound activator and preventing transcription initiation, although unreported in HNF-4-Svp interactions, has been recognized as a transcription inhibitory mechanism (42.Johnson A.D. Cell. 1995; 81: 655-658Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). In adapted insects, decreased CmSvp abundance was insufficient to sustain this interaction, leading to transcriptional activation.Although it is unclear how insects sense the presence of scN and how the signal of amino acid shortage was transduced, activation of CmCatB appears to be controlled by the intracellular balance of CmHNF-4 and CmSvp. The effect of upstream stress signals may be largely mediated by CmSvp. This reminded us of the control of gluconeogenesis in mammals. The key regulator of glucose synthesis PGC-1 works with HNF-4 to regulate downstream gluconeogenic enzymes (43.Yoon J.C. Puigserver P. Chen G. Donovan J. Wu Z. Rhee J. Adelmant G. Stafford J. Kahn C.R. Granner D.K. Newgard C.B. Spiegelman B.M. Nature. 2001; 413: 131-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (1496) Google Scholar). Similarly, the intrinsic activating role of CmHNF-4 may be altered by cofactors it partners with in the regulatory complex, even as its own expression is also adjusted. A balance between transcription activators and repressors enables achievement of the full regulatory potential for CmCatB transcription.The fact that anti-AaSvp serum diminished the DNA-protein complexes formed between COUP probe and unadapated insect midgut nuclear extracts (Fig. 9B) but had no impact on the complex of adapted insects (Fig. 2) indicates that CmSvp is not a component in the activation machinery. The vacant COUP-site may be replaced by CmHNF-4, which is more abundant in adapted insects. Alternatively, other coactivators could also bind to the cis-element previously occupied by CmSvp, when insects were not under dietary challenge. It has been reported that co-factors are able to engage HNF-4 in a constitutively active configuration (24.Iordanidou P. Aggelidou E. Demetriades C. Hadzopoulou-Cladaras M. J. Biol.

In another scenario, because HNF-4 has been reported to cooperate with other transcription factors in regulating gene expression, CmHNF-4 could also serve as one of the coactivators facilitating another nuclear receptor, as in the case of human CYP3A4 (37.Li T. Chiang J.Y. Drug Metab. Dispos. 2006; 34: 756-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Such a factor could even influence the CmSvp-CmHNF-4 interactions.Eukaryotic gene transcription is complicated not only because of the involvement of multiple transcription factors that control expression of genes of diverse function, but also because of the interplay of transcription factors possessing related structural motifs that recognize common target DNA sequences. We have demonstrated another facet of HNF-4 in metabolic processes particularly under nutrient stress; it is not only important for lipid and glucose homeostasis but also has a role in maintaining the supply of amino acids. By networking with various cofactors, HNF-4 orchestrates complex transcriptional responses. Such a regulatory mode of action helps us understand how insects readjust gene expression in the alimentary tract to mitigate the impact of dietary toxins and anti-nutritional factors, which is crucial for insect health and survival. IntroductionThe battle between plants and herbivorous insects employs a variety of defense and counter-defense strategies. Insect feeding elicits synthesis of a wide array of plant-defensive compounds, which in turn induce insect counteractive tactics to minimize the impact of plant defense. Analysis of these plant-pest interactions has become a research hotspot for understanding insect counter-defense mechanisms. Many insect survival mechanisms involve remodeling of the insect digestive system. Adjustments in cells lining the digestive tract allow pests to deal with a variety of plant toxins and anti-nutritional metabolites and are crucial for insect survival.A number of studies on insect response to plant protease inhibitors indicate that one of the tactics used by insects is activation of inhibitor-insensitive digestive enzymes (1.Bolter C.J.

Under regular growth conditions, these inhibitor-insensitive enzymes are often in low abundance, accounting for only a minor portion of the entire proteolytic activity. They can be strongly induced, however, and play an important role in protein degradation once the major digestive enzyme function is blocked.

https://openalex.org/W2027992596,"The RB and p53 tumor suppressors are mediators of DNA damage response, and compound inactivation of RB and p53 is a common occurrence in human cancers. Surprisingly, their cooperation in DNA damage signaling in relation to tumorigenesis and therapeutic response remains enigmatic. In the context of individuals with heritable retinoblastoma, there is a predilection for secondary tumor development, which has been associated with the use of radiation-therapy to treat the primary tumor. Furthermore, while germline mutations of the p53 gene are critical drivers for cancer predisposition syndromes, it is postulated that extrinsic stresses play a major role in promoting varying tumor spectrums and disease severities. In light of these studies, we examined the tumor suppressor functions of these proteins when challenged by exposure to therapeutic stress. To examine the cooperation of RB and p53 in tumorigenesis, and in response to therapy-induced DNA damage, a combination of genetic deletion and dominant negative strategies was employed. Results indicate that loss/inactivation of RB and p53 is not sufficient for cellular transformation. However, these proteins played distinct roles in response to therapy-induced DNA damage and subsequent tumorigenesis. Specifically, RB status was critical for cellular response to damage and senescence, irrespective of p53 function. Loss of RB resulted in a dramatic evolution of gene expression as a result of alterations in epigenetic programming. Critically, the observed changes in gene expression have been specifically associated with tumorigenesis, and RB-deficient, recurred cells displayed oncogenic characteristics, as well as increased resistance to subsequent challenge with discrete therapeutic agents. Taken together, these findings indicate that tumor suppressor functions of RB and p53 are particularly manifest when challenged by cellular stress. In the face of such challenge, RB is a critical suppressor of tumorigenesis beyond p53, and RB-deficiency could promote significant cellular evolution, ultimately contributing to a more aggressive disease."
