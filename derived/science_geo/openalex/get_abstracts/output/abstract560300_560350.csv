https://openalex.org/W2402470851,"Changes in pupil diameter can reflect high-level cognitive signals that depend on central neuromodulatory mechanisms. However, brain mechanisms that adjust pupil size are also exquisitely sensitive to changes in luminance and other events that would be considered a nuisance in cognitive experiments recording pupil size. We implemented a simple auditory experiment involving no changes in visual stimulation. Using finite impulse-response fitting we found pupil responses triggered by different types of events. Among these are pupil responses to auditory events and associated surprise: cognitive effects. However, these cognitive responses were overshadowed by pupil responses associated with blinks and eye movements, both inevitable nuisance factors that lead to changes in effective luminance. Of note, these latter pupil responses were not recording artifacts caused by blinks and eye movements, but endogenous pupil responses that occurred in the wake of these events. Furthermore, we identified slow (tonic) changes in pupil size that differentially influenced faster (phasic) pupil responses. Fitting all pupil responses using gamma functions, we provide accurate characterisations of cognitive and non-cognitive response shapes, and quantify each response's dependence on tonic pupil size. These results allow us to create a set of recommendations for pupil size analysis in cognitive neuroscience, which we have implemented in freely available software."
https://openalex.org/W2396711057,"Pyrolysis of organic waste or woody materials yields charcoal, a stable carbonaceous product that can be used for cooking or mixed into soil, in the latter case often termed ""biochar"". Traditional kiln technologies for charcoal production are slow and without treatment of the pyrolysis gases, resulting in emissions of gases (mainly methane and carbon monoxide) and aerosols that are both toxic and contribute to greenhouse gas emissions. In retort kilns pyrolysis gases are led back to a combustion chamber. This can reduce emissions substantially, but is costly and consumes a considerable amount of valuable ignition material such as wood during start-up. To overcome these problems, a novel type of technology, the Kon-Tiki flame curtain pyrolysis, is proposed. This technology combines the simplicity of the traditional kiln with the combustion of pyrolysis gases in the flame curtain (similar to retort kilns), also avoiding use of external fuel for start-up.A field study in Nepal using various feedstocks showed char yields of 22 ± 5% on a dry weight basis and 40 ± 11% on a C basis. Biochars with high C contents (76 ± 9%; n = 57), average surface areas (11 to 215 m(2) g(-1)), low EPA16-PAHs (2.3 to 6.6 mg kg(-1)) and high CECs (43 to 217 cmolc/kg)(average for all feedstocks, mainly woody shrubs) were obtained, in compliance with the European Biochar Certificate (EBC).Mean emission factors for the flame curtain kilns were (g kg(-1) biochar for all feedstocks); CO2 = 4300 ± 1700, CO = 54 ± 35, non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOC) = 6 ± 3, CH4 = 30 ± 60, aerosols (PM10) = 11 ± 15, total products of incomplete combustion (PIC) = 100 ± 83 and NOx = 0.4 ± 0.3. The flame curtain kilns emitted statistically significantly (p<0.05) lower amounts of CO, PIC and NOx than retort and traditional kilns, and higher amounts of CO2.With benefits such as high quality biochar, low emission, no need for start-up fuel, fast pyrolysis time and, importantly, easy and cheap construction and operation the flame curtain technology represent a promising possibility for sustainable rural biochar production."

Four treatments were as follows: no fertilization (CK), application of inorganic fertilizer (NPK), combined application of inorganic fertilizer with maize straw (NPK+S) and addition of biochar with inorganic fertilizer (NPK+B). Our results showed that after three consecutive years of application, the values of soil bulk density were significantly lower in both organic amendment-treated plots than in unamended (CK and NPK) plots. Compared with NPK, NPK+B more effectively increased the contents of soil organic carbon, improved the relative proportion of soil macro-aggregates and mean weight diameter, and enhanced field capacity as well as plant available water. Organic amendments had no obvious effect on soil C/N ratio or wilting coefficient. The results of linear regression indicated that the improvement in soil water retention could be attributed to the increases in soil organic carbon and aggregate stability."
https://openalex.org/W2408734345,"The parasitic mite Varroa destructor has a significant worldwide impact on bee colony health. In the absence of control measures, parasitized colonies invariably collapse within 3 years. The synthetic pyrethroids tau-fluvalinate and flumethrin have proven very effective at managing this mite within apiaries, but intensive control programs based mainly on one active ingredient have led to many reports of pyrethroid resistance. In Europe, a modification of leucine to valine at position 925 (L925V) of the V. destructor voltage-gated sodium channel was correlated with resistance, the mutation being found at high frequency exclusively in hives with a recent history of pyrethroid treatment. Here, we identify two novel mutations, L925M and L925I, in tau-fluvalinate resistant V. destructor collected at seven sites across Florida and Georgia in the Southeastern region of the USA. Using a multiplexed TaqMan® allelic discrimination assay, these mutations were found to be present in 98% of the mites surviving tau-fluvalinate treatment. The mutations were also found in 45% of the non-treated mites, suggesting a high potential for resistance evolution if selection pressure is applied. The results from a more extensive monitoring programme, using the Taqman® assay described here, would clearly help beekeepers with their decision making as to when to include or exclude pyrethroid control products and thereby facilitate more effective mite management programmes."

https://openalex.org/W2362672802,"Cryptochromes constitute a group of flavin-binding blue light receptors in bacteria, fungi, plants, and insects. Recently, the response of cryptochromes to light was extended to nearly the entire visible spectral region on the basis of the activity of the animal-like cryptochrome aCRY in the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. This finding was explained by the absorption of red light by the flavin neutral radical as the dark state of the receptor, which then forms the anionic fully reduced state. In this study, time-resolved UV-visible spectroscopy on the full-length aCRY revealed an unusually long-lived tyrosyl radical with a lifetime of 2.6 s, which is present already 1 μs after red light illumination of the flavin radical. Mutational studies disclosed the tyrosine 373 close to the surface to form the long-lived radical and to be essential for photoreduction. This residue is conserved exclusively in the sequences of other putative aCRY proteins distinguishing them from conventional (6–4) photolyases. Size exclusion chromatography showed the full-length aCRY to be a dimer in the dark at 0.5 mm injected concentration with the C-terminal extension as the dimerization site. Upon illumination, partial oligomerization was observed via disulfide bridge formation at cysteine 482 in close proximity to tyrosine 373. The lack of any light response in the C-terminal extension as evidenced by FTIR spectroscopy differentiates aCRY from plant and Drosophila cryptochromes. These findings imply that aCRY might have evolved a different signaling mechanism via a light-triggered redox cascade culminating in photooxidation of a yet unknown substrate or binding partner.

Cryptochromes represent a group of diverse sensory photoreceptors present in all kingdoms of life (1.Chaves I. Pokorny R. Byrdin M. Hoang N. Ritz T. Brettel K. Essen L.O. van der Horst G.T.

Together with the UV-light-dependent DNA repair enzymes, the photolyases (3.Sancar A. Structure and function of DNA photolyase and cryptochrome blue-light photoreceptors.Chem. Rev. 2003; 103: 2203-2237Crossref PubMed Scopus (1026) Google Scholar), they constitute the cryptochrome/photolyase family. Members of this family share a highly conserved photolyase homology region (PHR) 2The abbreviations used are: PHRphotolyase homology regionFADoxoxidized flavin adenine dinucleotideCCTC-terminal extensionAtCRY1Arabidopsis thaliana cryptochrome 1CPDcyclobutane pyrimidine dimersaCRYanimal-like cryptochromeFADH•FAD neutral radicalFADH−anionic fully reduced state of FADUV-visUV-visibleTrp•tryptophan neutral radicalTyrO•tyrosyl radicalSECsize exclusion chromatographyRNRribonucleotide reductasePSIIphotosystem II. , which comprises ∼500 amino acids and carries a non-covalently bound flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) as a chromophore. The C-terminal extension (CCT) present in many cryptochromes and photolyases is strongly variable in amino acid composition and length and has been shown to be crucial for signal transduction in the Arabidopsis cryptochrome AtCRY1 (4.Yang H.Q. Wu Y.J. Tang R.H. Liu D. Liu Y. Cashmore A.R. The C termini of Arabidopsis cryptochromes mediate a constitutive light response.Cell. 2000; 103: 815-827Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). The diverse subfamilies of cryptochromes comprise proteins acting as central blue light sensors in bacteria, fungi, plants, and insects (animal type I CRY) (1.Chaves I. Pokorny R. Byrdin M. Hoang N. Ritz T. Brettel K. Essen L.O. van der Horst G.T. Batschauer A. Ahmad M. The cryptochromes: blue light photoreceptors in plants and animals.Annu. Rev. Plant Biol. 2011; 62: 335-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar). Moreover, CRYs are also found as the light-independent, central part of the oscillator of the biological clock in mammals (animal type II CRY) (5.Etchegaray J.P. Lee C. Wade P.A. Reppert S.M. Rhythmic histone acetylation underlies transcription in the mammalian circadian clock.Nature. 2003; 421: 177-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar) and as a mediator for light-dependent magnetosensitivity in flies (6.Gegear R.J. Casselman A. Waddell S. Reppert S.M. Cryptochrome mediates light-dependent magnetosensitivity in Drosophila.Nature. 2008; 454: 1014-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Opposed to these findings, DASH cryptochromes have been found to repair lesions in single-stranded DNA and double-stranded loop-structured DNA in vitro (7.Pokorny R. Klar T. Hennecke U. Carell T. Batschauer A. Essen L.O. Recognition and repair of UV lesions in loop structures of duplex DNA by DASH-type cryptochrome.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 17696-17700Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Therefore, DASH cryptochromes are more similar in terms of functionality to photolyases than cryptochromes. Among the photolyases, two different types are separated depending on their ability to either repair cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPD) (9.Rupert C.S. Photoreactivation of transforming DNA by an enzyme from bakers' yeast.J. Gen. Physiol. 1960; 43: 573-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) or (6–4) photoproducts (10.Todo T. Takemori H.

A new photoreactivating enzyme that specifically repairs ultraviolet light-induced (6–4) photoproducts.Nature. 1993; 361: 371-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Animal type II CRY are closely related to eukaryotic (6–4) photolyases whereas plant cryptochromes are homologous to CPD photolyases. In contrast, prokaryotic (6–4) photolyases (11.Zhang F.

The paradigm of cryptochromes and other flavoproteins as classical blue light receptors has been challenged recently by the finding that the animal-like cryptochrome (aCRY) from the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii strongly influences gene expression not only in response to blue but also to yellow and red light in vivo (13.Beel B. Prager K. Spexard M. Sasso S. Weiss D. Müller N. Heinnickel M. Dewez D. Ikoma D. Grossman A.R. Kottke T. Mittag M. A flavin binding cryptochrome photoreceptor responds to both blue and red light in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii.Plant Cell. 2012; 24: 2992-3008Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). These genes code for proteins involved in chlorophyll and carotenoid biosynthesis, light-harvesting complexes, nitrogen metabolism, cell cycle control, and the circadian clock. The extended spectral sensitivity was explained by the presence of the flavin neutral radical (FADH•) in the dark form of the receptor (Fig. 1A) (13.Beel B. Prager K. Spexard M. Sasso S. Weiss D. Müller N. Heinnickel M. Dewez D. Ikoma D. Grossman A.R. Kottke T. Mittag M.

Chem. 2007; 282: 9383-9391Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). The absorption spectrum of FADH• covers almost the full visible spectrum of light extending up to 680 nm in agreement with the action spectrum of aCRY (13.Beel B. Prager K. Spexard M. Sasso S. Weiss D. Müller N. Heinnickel M. Dewez D. Ikoma D. Grossman A.R. Kottke T. Mittag M. A flavin binding cryptochrome photoreceptor responds to both blue and red light in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii.Plant Cell. 2012; 24: 2992-3008Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). In vitro, the predominant part of aCRY was found in the oxidized state after purification. Accordingly, formation of FADH• requires a pre-illumination with blue light which was not applied in the in vivo experiments (13.Beel B. Prager K. Spexard M. Sasso S. Weiss D. Müller N. Heinnickel M. Dewez D. Ikoma D. Grossman A.R. Kottke T. Mittag M. A flavin binding cryptochrome photoreceptor responds to both blue and red light in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii.Plant Cell. 2012; 24: 2992-3008Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). However, FTIR spectroscopy revealed structural changes in the protein moiety only in the transition from FADH• to the anionic fully reduced state (FADH−) of aCRY providing further support for FADH• as the dark state of the chromophore (16.Spexard M. Thöing C. Beel B. Mittag M. Kottke T. Response of the sensory animal-like cryptochrome aCRY to blue and red light as revealed by infrared difference spectroscopy.Biochemistry. 2014; 53: 1041-1050Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Strikingly, these changes in turn structures were not detected in the closely related Xenopus laevis (6–4) photolyase (17.Yamada D. Zhang Y. Iwata T. Hitomi K. Getzoff E.D. Kandori H. Fourier-transform infrared study of the photoactivation process of Xenopus (6–4) photolyase.Biochemistry. 2012; 51: 5774-5783Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The lifetime of FADH• state in vitro was strongly sensitive to alterations of the pH but not of the oxygen level in contrast to other cryptochromes (18.Berndt A. Kottke T. Breitkreuz H. Dvorsky R.

The molecular mechanisms underlying these extraordinary characteristics of aCRY have remained undisclosed up to now because of missing time-resolved information on the early events after red light illumination. Previously, time-resolved UV-visible (UV-vis) spectroscopy on cryptochromes and photolyases has revealed the involvement of transient radical species formed from FAD, tryptophan, and tyrosine as part of the electron transfer cascade (21.Aubert C.

Moreover, the formation of these amino acid radicals in the electron transfer cascade has been disclosed by time-resolved EPR studies (31.Biskup T. Schleicher E. Okafuji A. Link G. Hitomi K.

However, to date the photoreduction process of the FADH• has not been studied time-resolved in the cryptochrome as well as (6–4) photolyase families. In this study, we focused on resolving the events in aCRY starting from the FADH• state by its selective induction using illumination with red light, because the blue light-induced conversion of FADox in aCRY is not considered to be physiologically relevant (13.Beel B. Prager K. Spexard M. Sasso S. Weiss D. Müller N. Heinnickel M. Dewez D. Ikoma D. Grossman A.R. Kottke T. Mittag M. A flavin binding cryptochrome photoreceptor responds to both blue and red light in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii.Plant Cell. 2012; 24: 2992-3008Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). To elucidate the red light-induced processes, we employed transient UV-vis spectroscopy, size exclusion chromatography (SEC), and FTIR difference spectroscopy on the full-length aCRY as well as on point mutants Y393A, Y373F, C482A (Fig. 1B), and aCRYΔCCT lacking the 99 residues of the CCT. We identified the contribution from a remarkably long-lived TyrO• formed by Tyr-373 close to the surface (Fig. 1B), which is conserved in aCRY homologues but not in any other subfamily of cryptochromes and photolyases. Furthermore, we investigated the role of the CCT in the light-induced structural response and the oligomerization of aCRY. aCRYΔCCT coding for amino acids 1 to 496 of the aCRY gene, lacking the 99 amino acids of its CCT, was codon-adapted for E. coli (synthesized by Geneart) and cloned into pET28a(+) (Novagen), providing a 6x His-Tag at the C terminus by using the restriction enzyme sites NcoI and HindIII. Mutation Y393A was inserted into the full-length codon-adapted sequence of aCRY (synthesized by Geneart (13.Beel B. Prager K. Spexard M. Sasso S. Weiss D. Müller N. Heinnickel M. Dewez D. Ikoma D. Grossman A.R. Kottke T. Mittag M. A flavin binding cryptochrome photoreceptor responds to both blue and red light in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii.Plant Cell. 2012; 24: 2992-3008Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar)) by the replacement of a 739 bp BstEII and HindIII fragment with a fragment containing the codon-adapted sequence for the substituted amino acid Y393A. Full-length aCRY-Y393A was ligated via NcoI and HindIII restriction sites into vector pET28a(+). The Y373F and C482A mutations were inserted into the full-length aCRY gene in the pET28a(+) vector using phosphorylated back-to-back primers, of which one primer contained the mutation. To amplify the whole plasmid, Phusion DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs) was used in the polymerase chain reaction. The reaction products were ligated afterward. The amino acid exchanges in all resulting plasmids were verified by dideoxy sequencing. Expression and purification of aCRY and its variants were conducted following published procedures (13.Beel B. Prager K. Spexard M. Sasso S. Weiss D. Müller N. Heinnickel M. Dewez D. Ikoma D. Grossman A.R. Kottke T. Mittag M.

Finally, the proteins were obtained in a 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, 100 mm NaCl, 20% (v/v) glycerol. The concentration of the sample was adjusted to A447 = 0.3. An HR2000+ spectrometer with DH-2000-BAL light source (Ocean Optics) was used for experiments in the millisecond to second time regime modified with a mesh filter with 35% transmission to avoid sample conversion by the probe light. For illumination, a 451 nm LED (Luxeon Star, Lumileds) with an intensity of 67 milliwatt/cm2 (full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 20 nm) and a 632 nm LED (Luxeon Star, Lumileds) with an intensity of 95 milliwatt/cm2 (FWHM of 15 nm) at the sample were attached to the sample holder perpendicular to the measuring beam. For the generation of FADH•, aCRY was illuminated for 10 s at 451 nm in a 2 × 10 mm fluorescence cuvette (Helma). FADH− was produced by illuminating the sample for 2 s or 10 s at 632 nm. A continuous series of spectra were recorded before, during and after illumination with an integration time of 2 ms and a time resolution of ∼40 ms. Difference spectra were calculated and summarized on a logarithmic time scale to increase the signal-to-noise ratio using MATLAB (The Mathworks). The concentration of the sample was adjusted to A447 = 0.5. The experimental setup for time-resolved UV-vis spectroscopy on slowly recovering systems has been described previously (29.Thöing C. Oldemeyer S. Kottke T. Microsecond deprotonation of aspartic acid and response of the α/β subdomain precede C-terminal signaling in the blue light sensor plant cryptochrome.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2015; 137: 5990-5999Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). aCRY was pre-illuminated for 15 s under stirring to generate FADH• using a 455 nm LED (Luxeon Star, Lumileds) with an intensity of 10 milliwatt/cm2 at the sample (FWHM of 20 nm). For excitation of FADH•, a 630 nm pulse with 10 ns duration and 2 mJ/cm2 energy density was generated by a tunable optical parametric oscillator (Opta), which was pumped by the 355-nm third harmonic of a Nd:YAG laser (Quanta-Ray GCR-12, Spectra Physics). Laser pulses with a repetition rate of (1.6 s)−1 were selected by a shutter. Multiple excitations were minimized by rotating a magnetic stirring bar inside the cuvette for 450 ms after each detection. A fast sample exchange within a total volume of 2.5 ml was ensured by a horizontal geometry of the excitation beam. Moreover, contributions from previous excitations were avoided by alternating the recording of reference and signal spectra. All experiments were conducted at 20 °C. Spectra were recorded at 1 μs, 10 μs, 100 μs, and 20 ms after excitation with an integration time of 1 μs, 5 μs, 100 μs, and 100 μs, respectively. Each spectrum was obtained by averaging 10–61 separate experiments, in which each sample was excited 15 times. For the comparison of the wild type and the Y373F mutant of aCRY, ascorbic acid was added as a reducing agent to a final concentration of 3 mm. The samples were pre-illuminated with blue light for 1 s and 45 s for wild type and Y373F mutant, respectively. For excitation, the 532 nm second harmonic of a Nd:YAG laser (Ultra 100, Quantel) was used at a repetition rate of (1.6 s)−1 with a pulse duration of 10 ns and an energy density of 15 mJ/cm2 and 30 mJ/cm2 for wild type and mutant, respectively. The integration time was set to 500 ns for the difference spectra recorded at 500 ns. Each spectrum of aCRY was obtained by averaging 8–20 separate experiments, in which each sample was excited 15 times. The samples were concentrated to an A447 ∼27 by ultrafiltration using Vivaspin 500 filter devices (Sartorius, 50 kDa cutoff). During centrifugation at 15,000 × g, the protein was washed three times with 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.8, 100 mm NaCl, 1% (v/v) glycerol. A 1.8-μl droplet of the sample solution was applied to a BaF2 window (20 mm diameter) and kept at 20 °C and atmospheric pressure for up to 30 s to gently reduce the water content. The samples were sealed with a second BaF2 window. Thus, a well-hydrated film with an absorbance ratio of amide I/water (1650 cm−1) to amide II (1550 cm−1) of 2.3–2.5 was obtained. An appropriate hydration of the sample is essential to ensure that the full extent of changes in secondary structure of the protein is detected. IR experiments were performed on an IFS 66v spectrometer (Bruker) equipped with a photoconductive mercury cadmium telluride (MCT) detector at a spectral resolution of 2 cm−1. The difference spectra were obtained with a long wave pass filter (OCLI) cutting off infrared light above 2256 cm−1. The experiments were performed at 20 °C. The blue light response of aCRY was induced by illumination for 1 s with a 451-nm LED equipped with a diffusion disc and yielding an intensity of 32 milliwatt/cm2 at the sample. Red light illumination was conducted for 10 s with a 632-nm LED with an intensity of 40 milliwatt/cm2 at the sample. To obtain a representative difference spectrum, 512 scans were averaged. SEC was performed using an Äkta purifier (GE Healthcare) with a Superdex200 10/300 GL column (GE Healthcare) at 4 °C. For equilibration and elution, 50 mm phosphate buffer at pH 7.0 and 150 mm NaCl were used. Aliquots of 100 μl with a protein concentration of 0.5 mm were centrifuged at 21,400 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. For the investigation of aCRY carrying FADox and FADH•, loading of the samples and the SEC were performed in the dark. FADH• was obtained by illuminating the sample for 10 s with two 451 nm LEDs (Luxeon Star, Lumileds) with an intensity of 67 milliwatt/cm2 each at the sample. The elution profiles were recorded at 447 and 630 nm to ensure that only protein with the flavin bound contributes. For the generation of FADH−, samples were illuminated for 45 s with the two 451 nm LEDs followed by 30 s in darkness and illumination for 20 s with a 451 nm LED and a 632 nm LED with an intensity of 64 milliwatt/cm2. Alternatively, the latter two LEDs were used to illuminate the sample for 45 s. This variation in illumination did not have any detectable effect on the elution profiles of the proteins recorded at 447 and 370 nm. Standard marker proteins (GE Healthcare) were used to determine the apparent molecular mass of the sample by calibration. Representative traces are shown from the experiments, which were repeated at least three times for each of 2–3 independent preparations. Phylogenetic analyses were conducted using the MEGA software package version 6 (33.Tamura K. Dudley J. Nei M. Kumar S. MEGA4: Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis (MEGA) Software Version 4.0.Mol. Biol. Evol. 2007; 24: 1596-1599Crossref PubMed Scopus (25548) Google Scholar). The protein sequences used for the alignment were selected according to the results of the NCBI BLASTP 2.3.0 (34.Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schäffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Gapped BLAST and PSI-BLAST: a new generation of protein database search programs.Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (59759) Google Scholar) using the sequences with the highest identity to aCRY. Additionally, sequences of closely related and well characterized cryptochromes and photolyases were included (supplemental Table S1). The protein sequences were aligned with the ClustalW algorithm. The UV-vis spectrum of aCRY recorded after purification revealed FADox to be present in aCRY in vitro (Fig. 1C). Blue light illumination then generated FADH• with characteristic bands at 585 and 633 nm. We noticed an additional small band at 416 nm with a shoulder at 410 nm in the absorption spectrum after illumination, which was only present for a few seconds (Fig. 1C). Such contribution is indicative for transient accumulation of an amino acid radical, but usually detected on a much shorter time scale. Therefore, this finding was scrutinized in a time-resolved manner in the context of the physiologically more relevant reduction of FADH• to FADH−. Time-resolved UV-vis experiments have revealed the involvement of tryptophan and tyrosyl radicals in the photoreaction of cryptochromes in vitro starting from FADox. Here, flash photolysis was applied to detect possible amino acid radicals involved in the red light-induced photoreduction of FADH• in aCRY. Previous steady-state experiments have shown only the formation of FADH− (16.Spexard M. Thöing C. Beel B. Mittag M. Kottke T. Response of the sensory animal-like cryptochrome aCRY to blue and red light as revealed by infrared difference spectroscopy.Biochemistry. 2014; 53: 1041-1050Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Samples containing FADox were pre-illuminated with blue light for 15 s to generate a sufficient amount of FADH•, which was stabilized by adjusting the pH to 7.0 (16.Spexard M. Thöing C. Beel B.

To selectively convert FADH• to FADH−, nanosecond laser pulses at 630 nm were used. Time-resolved UV-vis difference spectra were recorded at time points from 1 μs to 2 ms (Fig. 2A). All difference spectra show the characteristic negative band pattern of the bleaching of FADH• with two broad maxima at 590 nm and 630 nm. Additionally, a small positive contribution from the formation of FADH− is"

Through 2655 face-to-face interviews conducted between August 2012 and July 2014, we used fishers' recall of past catch rates of reef-associated finfish to infer species disappearances from catches in five marine key biodiversity areas (Lanuza Bay, Danajon Bank, Verde Island Passage, Polillo Islands and Honda Bay). We modeled temporal trends in perceived catch per unit effort (CPUE) based on fishers' reports of typical good days' catches using Generalized Linear Mixed Modelling. Fifty-nine different finfish disappeared from catches between the 1950s and 2014; 42 fish were identified to species level, two to genus, seven to family and eight to local name only. Five species occurring at all sites with the greatest number of fishers reporting zero catches were the green bumphead parrotfish (Bolbometopon muricatum), humphead wrasse (Cheilinus undulatus), African pompano (Alectis ciliaris), giant grouper (Epinephelus lanceolatus) and mangrove red snapper (Lutjanus argentimaculatus). Between the 1950s and 2014, the mean perceived CPUE of bumphead parrotfish declined by 88%, that of humphead wrasse by 82%, African pompano by 66%, giant grouper by 74% and mangrove red snapper by 64%. These declines were mainly associated with excess and uncontrolled fishing, fish life-history traits like maximum body size and socio-economic factors like access to market infrastructure and services, and overpopulation. The fishers' knowledge is indicative of extirpations where evidence for these losses was otherwise lacking. Our models provide information as basis for area-based conservation and regional resource management particularly for the more vulnerable, once common, large, yet wide-ranging reef finfish species."

CT is predominantly produced in C cells of the thyroid gland and it is secreted upon increases in the serum calcium concentration preventing hypercalcemia. Salmon CT (sCT) has been utilized for 40 years as a therapeutic agent for treatment of metabolic bone diseases such as osteoporosis and Paget’s disease, due to its high potency; 40–50 times higher compared with human CT.

Class B GPCRs are characterized by having a large ectodomain (ECD) of 100–160 amino acid residues with a conserved tertiary structure stabilized by three conserved disulfide bridges. The ECD binds the carboxyl-terminal region of the peptide ligand and thereby positions the amino-terminal part of the ligand for binding to the transmembrane domain to initiate signaling, a mechanism referred to as the two-domain binding model (reviewed in Ref. 4Hoare S.R.

The pharmacology of the CT family of peptides is complex due to heterodimerization of CTR or CLR with a membrane-bound receptor activity-modifying protein (RAMP). There are three different variants of RAMPs: RAMP-1, RAMP-2, and RAMP-3, which have ∼30% amino acid sequence identity and the ligand specificity of CTR and CLR is determined by the interaction (or not) with the RAMPs. CTR is on its own the receptor for CT, whereas in combination with RAMP-1 or RAMP-3 it changes ligand specificity and becomes the amylin receptor (14Christopoulos G. Perry K.J. Morfis M.

The heterodimer of CLR and RAMP-1 is the receptor for CGRP, whereas the heterodimer of CLR and RAMP-2 or RAMP-3 are the receptors for AM. Previously, crystal structures of the CLR ECD in complex with the RAMP-1 ECD have been determined, both as a heterodimer and as ternary complexes with two different small molecule receptor antagonists (10ter Haar E.

More recently, the crystal structures of the peptide ligand-bound CGRP receptor ECD (CLR/RAMP-1ECD) and AM receptor ECD (CLR/RAMP-2ECD) were published (16Booe J.M. Walker C.S. Barwell J. Kuteyi G.

These structures provided the first molecular insights into ligand binding and specificity of this subclass of Class B GPCRs. The molecular details that govern ligand binding and specificity of CTR have not previously been clarified by high resolution structure determination. Likewise the change of ligand specificity of CTR enforced by the interaction with RAMP is not fully understood. In this study we determined the crystal structure of the CTR ECD in complex with the peptide ligand [BrPhe22]sCT8–32 ([BrPhe22] = 4-bromo-l-phenylalanine at position 22). The molecular details of the interaction between sCT and the CTR ECD is revealed by the structure and provides new information regarding the structure of sCT in the receptor-bound state and the molecular determinants of ligand specificity of this Class B receptor subclass, in particular the receptors for calcitonin and amylin. Human calcitonin was acquired from Sigma (H-2250). All other peptides were synthesized on a Liberty (CEM) or a Prelude (PTI) synthesizer by standard Fmoc chemistry on Rink-AM or Rink-ChemMatrix resins using Fmoc-amino acids with standard protecting groups, diisopropylcarbodiimide/HOAt for coupling, and 20% piperidine for deprotection. For the peptides with a disulfide bond, Cys was incorporated as Fmoc-Cys(Trt)-OH, and after completion of the synthesis, the disulfide was formed on-resin by treatment with an excess of 1% iodine in N-methylpyrrolidone for 15 min. Cleavage was performed with trifluoroacetic acid/water/triisopropylsilane (95:2.5:2.5) for 1 h followed by precipitation with diethyl ether. The peptides were purified by RP-HPLC on a C18 column in TFA-acetonitrile and characterized by LC-MS and UPLC. An oligonucleotide sequence encoding the 120-aa ECD part of the human CTR (Isoform II) was designed, codon optimized for expression in Escherichia coli, and ordered from GeneArt (GmbH Germany). A His6 purification tag was introduced in the amino-terminal of the CTR ECD sequence using PCR with forward and reverse oligonucleotide primers, to introduce NdeI/BamHI restriction enzyme sites. The PCR product was ligated into a TOPOBlunt-End vector (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions and the sequence was verified by DNA sequencing (DNA Technology). The NdeI/BamHI fragment comprising His6-CTR ECD was ligated into a pET11a E. coli expression vector (pACSH438)(Novagen) resulting in fusion protein with the following sequence: MGSSHHHHHHSSGLVPRGSAFSNQTYPTIEPKPFLYVVGRKKMMDAQYKCYDRMQQLPAYQGEGPYCNRTWDGWLCWDDTPAGVLSYQFCPDYFPDFDPSEKVTKYCDEKGVWFKHPENNRTWSNYTMCNAFTPEKLKN. Due to the location of the thrombin cleavage site (underlined), two residues, Gly-Ser, were introduced in the amino terminus of the CTR ECD. E. coli BL21(DE3) were transfected with pACSH438 and plated on AMP containing LB Agar plates to obtain the expression strain (eMD712). Expression in a 1-liter shaker flask was performed using LB medium with 100 mg/ml of AMP for 3 h at 37 °C and using 0.5 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and expression of a 14-kDa insoluble protein corresponding to His6-CTR ECD was verified using Coomassie-stained SDS-PAGE gels. Strain emD712 was propagated on a solid agar surface (LB-agar + 100 mg/liter of AMP) at 30 °C overnight. A 10-liter fed-batch fermentation was subsequently performed in a 20-liter stainless steel bioreactor using a complex medium with glycerol feeding according to a predefined feeding profile ensuring glycerol-limited growth. Throughout the fermentation, pH was kept at 6.9 by titration of 10% H3PO4 and 10% NH4OH, and the temperature was controlled at 37 °C. The culture was aerated at a flow of 2 vessel/volume/min of air and a backpressure of 0.3–0.45 bar. After 16 h of elapsed fermentation time, at A600 of around 50, isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (0.5 mm) was added to induce expression of His6-CTR ECD. Approximately 6 h after induction, the fermentation was terminated. The final biomass concentration was A600 = 80.5 or 30.65 g/liter cell dry weight. The culture broth was directly homogenized at 1500 bar at a single pass through the APV2000 high-pressure homogenizer. A total of 253 g of inclusion bodies were sedimented by centrifugation of the homogenate for 40 min at 4500 rpm (6056 × g) and 4 °C. The CTR ECD inclusion bodies were isolated, denatured, and refolded as previously described for the glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor ECD (17Runge S. Schimmer S. Oschmann J. Schiødt C.B. Knudsen S.M.

The refolded protein was purified using Ni2+ affinity chromatography using the following procedure: 1) buffer exchange using a Sephadex G25 XK 50/100 column running in binding buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.1 m Na2SO4, 0.1 m l-Arg, 20 mm imidazole); 2) Ni2+ affinity chromatography using a 5-ml HisTrap column eluted in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.1 m Na2SO4, 0.1 m l-Arg, 500 mm imidazole; and 3) buffer exchange using a Sephadex G25 XK 50/100 column running in binding buffer. For binding studies the protein was further purified by size exclusion chromatography (SEC) using a Superdex 75 26/60 column running in 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.1 m Na2SO4, 2% glycerol. For structural studies the amino-terminal His tag was cleaved off by thrombin and the protein was further purified by ligand affinity chromatography as follows: 1) the ligand-affinity column was prepared by loading a biotinylated analogue of sCT onto a streptavidin column (HiTrap Streptavidin HP) and equilibrated in 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.1 m Na2SO4, 2% glycerol; 2) 10 mg of CTR ECD was loaded on the ligand-affinity column and equilibrated in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl; and 3) the nCTR ECD was eluted in a ligand-bound form by loading of the ligand [BrPhe22]sCT(8–32), at a high concentration (500 μm) resulting in an excess of free ligand in the eluted sample. All columns were from GE Healthcare. The eluted sample was prone to aggregate at temperatures higher than 4 °C and was hard to concentrate without massive precipitation. The addition of freshly prepared urea to a final concentration of 2 m solved the solubility problem and this protein solution was concentrated on an ultrafiltration centrifugation device with 3000-kDa cutoff to 10 mg/ml. The binding assay was performed using a BHK cell line stably transfected with the human CTR, and a CREB-binding protein-responsive luciferase reporter gene. The day before the assay the cells were seeded into poly-d-lysine-coated 384W Opaque White, BD BioCoat plates (10000 cells/well) and incubated overnight at 37 °C, 5% CO2, 95% humidity. Then, the cells were washed in Hanks’ balanced salt solution (4 °C), and incubated overnight at 4 °C in a binding buffer containing test compounds, 25 pm 125I-sCT (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, catalog number NEX423), a calcitonin, Dulbecco medium without phenol red (500 ml) (Gibco, 11880-028), 0.1% ovalbumin (5 ml of 10% ovalbumin) (Sigma number A5503), 10 mm Hepes (5 ml, 1 m) (Gibco number 15630-056) 1× glutamine (5 ml, ×100) (Gibco number 35050087) 1% penicillin-streptomycin (5 ml, 100%) (Gibco number 15140-122), Complete (1 tablet/50 ml) (Roche number 5056489001) 0.1% Pluronic F68® (Gibco number 24040-032). The morning after, the plates were washed three times in Hanks’ balanced salt solution (4 °C), and lysed in Lysis buffer (0.1 m NaOH (VWR number 1.09136.1000), 1% SDS (Cayman Chemical Company number 600216). Then MicroScint40 was added and the plates were shaken at 500 rpm for a short period. The plate was then incubated at room temperature in the dark for 1 h and read on a TopCounter. The IC50 was calculated using (one site binding competition analysis) GraphPad Prism5. Binding to the CTR ECD was assessed in a bead-based proximity assay (AlphaScreen®) with His6-CTR ECD binding to Ni Chelate Acceptor beads and biotinylated sCT binding to Streptavidin Donor Beads (PerkinElmer, catalog number 6760619C). When biotinylated sCT binds to His6-CTR ECD, acceptor and donor beads are brought close together and a signal is created. The binding of compounds to CTR ECD was assessed indirectly by the ability to displace binding between CTR ECD and biotinylated sCT. The CTR ECD, biotinylated sCT, and compounds were diluted in buffer containing 25 mm Hepes, 0.1 m NaCl, 0.1% BSA (Sigma A-7888), pH 7.4. 5 μl of compound, 5 μl of CTR ECD (final concentration 10 nm), and 5 μl of biotinylated sCT (final concentration 10 nm) was added per well in a 384-well plate and the plate incubated for 1 h at room temperature. 5 μl of acceptor beads (final concentration 20 μg/ml) and 5 μl of donor beads (final concentration 20 μg/ml) were added to the wells and the plate was incubated at 4 °C overnight. The plate was read on Envision and results drawn using GraphPad Prism. Crystals of the CTR ECD·[BrPhe22]sCT(8–32) complex were grown at 18 °C using sitting drop vapor diffusion, mixing equal volumes of protein (10 mg/ml of protein complex in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 50 mm sodium chloride, 2 m urea) and precipitant (0.1 m Hepes, pH 7.5, 4.3 m sodium chloride). The crystal was cooled in liquid nitrogen using a cryoprotectant consisting of a 1:4 (v/v) mixture of ethylene glycol and precipitant. Diffraction data were collected at 100 K on a CCD detector from MAR Research using a MicroMaxTM-007 HF x-ray generator. Autoindexing, integration, and scaling were performed using the HKL suite (18Otwinowski Z. Minor W.

A solution with three CTR ECD chains in the asymmetric unit was found, the side chains were altered to the CTR ECD amino acid sequence and the structure was further refined and model built using PHENIX and COOT (21Emsley P.

For each CTR ECD molecule, there was a clear difference electron density for amino acid residues from the [BrPhe22]sCT(8–32) peptide that could be model built (residues 21–32 in two of the chains and residues 24–32 in the third). All graphical illustrations of structures were made using PyMol (Schrödinger). The coordinates and the structure factors have been deposited in the PDB with accession number 5II0. A hybrid model of the CTR ECD-bound antagonistic peptide sCT(8–32) was made by combining residues 8–23 from a sCT NMR structure (PDB entry 2GLH (31Andreotti G. Méndez B.L. Amodeo P.

The area covered on the GPCR Class B ECDs due to binding of their respective peptide ligands were calculated for the CTR ECD·[BrPhe22]sCT(8–32) (chain A and D), corticotropin-releasing factor receptor 2α ECD·urocortin 1 (PDB entry 3N96, chain A and G), CLR·AM (PDB entry 4RWF, chains A and B), and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor ECD·glucagon-like peptide-1 (PDB entry 3IOL, chain A and B) complexes.

The interaction area was calculated as (AR + AL − ARL)/2. The crystal structure of the CTR ECD in complex with [BrPhe22]sCT(8–32) was determined and refined to 2.1-Å resolution (Fig. 1a, statistics of the model are found in Table 1). The [BrPhe22]sCT(8–32) analogue was originally chosen for phasing of the crystal structure. This was not applicable, probably due to disorder of the 4-bromophenylalanine residue of the analogue, and molecular replacement was instead applied for phasing. The CLR ECD was used as the model for molecular replacement (CLR ECD PDB entry 3N7S, chain A only), and it shares ∼60% amino acid residue sequence identity with the crystallized CTR ECD of this study. The overall structures of the CTR and CLR ECDs are very similar with a root mean square deviation of 1.03 Å for 92 aligned Cα atoms as determined using default parameters in the program COOT (PDB code 3N7S chain A aligned with CTR ECD, chain A). The CTR ECD shares the fold with the other Class B GPCR ECD structures as illustrated in Fig. 2. The structure of the ECD-bound [BrPhe22]sCT(8–32) is most similar to the structure of a CGRP analogue bound to the CLR·RAMP-1 ECD complex, which on the other hand is quite different from the structure of other receptor-bound peptides of Class B GPCRs, such as glucagon-like peptide-1, glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide, and parathyroid hormone. The only secondary structure element of ECD-bound [BrPhe22]sCT(8–32) is a type II β turn, which consists of residues Gly28-Thr31. Specifically, the backbone carbonyl oxygen of Gly28 forms a hydrogen bond across the turn structure with the hydroxyl group of Thr31 and the glycine residue at position 30 is compatible with the type II turn conformation (Fig. 3).TABLE 1Diffraction data and refinement statisticsSpace groupC2Unit cell a, b, c (Å)96.6, 113.2, 55.4 α, β, γ (°)90, 114.8, 90Resolution (Å)24.94–2.097 (2.172–2.097)aValues within parentheses refer to the highest resolution shell.Total reflections238,084 (23,266)Unique reflections31,627 (2,878)Multiplicity7.5 (7.4)Completeness (%)97 (100)«I»/σ(I)15.99 (2.86)Wilson B-factor29.59Rmerge (%)8.1 (54.4)Rmeas (%)8.7 (58.5)Reflections used in refinement30,547 (2878)Reflections used for Rfree1,935 (185)Rwork (%)16.98 (21.24)Rfree (%)20.55 (24.33)Number of non-hydrogen atoms3088Room mean square (bonds)0.008Room mean square (angles)1.11Ramachandran favored (%)98Ramachandran allowed (%)1.5Ramachandran outliers (%)0Average B-factor (Å2)39.55Average B-factor protein atoms (Å2)39.26Average B-factor solvent (Å2)42.48a Values within parentheses refer to the highest resolution shell.

https://openalex.org/W2400730724,"Vitamin A bound to retinol binding protein 4 (RBP4) constitutes the major transport mode for retinoids in fasting circulation. Emerging evidence suggests that membrane protein, STRA6 (stimulated by retinoic acid 6), is the RBP4 receptor and vitamin A channel; however, the role of STRA6 in vitamin A homeostasis remains to be defined in vivo. We subjected Stra6-knockout mice to diets sufficient and insufficient for vitamin A and used heterozygous siblings as controls. We determined vitamin A levels of the eyes, brain, and testis, which highly express Stra6, as well as of tissues with low expression, such as lung and fat. We also studied the consequence of STRA6 deficiency on retinoid-dependent processes in tissues. Furthermore, we examined how STRA6 deficiency affected retinoid homeostasis of the aging mouse. The picture that emerged indicates a critical role for STRA6 in the transport of vitamin A across blood-tissue barriers in the eyes, brain, and testis. Concurrently, fat and lung rely on dietary vitamin A. In testis and brain, Stra6 expression was regulated by vitamin A. In controls, this regulation reduced vitamin A consumption when the dietary supply was limited, sequestering it for the eye. Thus, STRA6 is critical for vitamin A homeostasis and the adaption of this process to the fluctuating supply of the vitamin.—Kelly, M., Widjaja-Adhi, M. A. K., Palczewski, G., von Lintig, J.

https://openalex.org/W2408218503,"Understanding how communities respond to environmental variation is a central goal in ecology. Plant communities respond to environmental gradients via intraspecific and/or interspecific variation in plant functional traits. However, the relative contribution of these two responses to environmental factors remains poorly tested. We measured six functional traits (height, leaf thickness, specific leaf area (SLA), leaf carbon concentration (LCC), leaf nitrogen concentration (LNC) and leaf phosphorus concentration (LPC)) for 55 tree species occurring at five elevations across a 1200 m elevational gradient of subalpine forests in Yulong Mountain, Southwest China. We examined the relative contribution of interspecific and intraspecific traits variability based on community weighted mean trait values and functional diversity, and tested how different components of trait variation respond to different environmental axes (climate and soil variables). Species turnover explained the largest amount of variation in leaf morphological traits (leaf thickness and SLA) across the elevational gradient. However, intraspecific variability explained a large amount of variation (49.3%–76.3%) in three other traits (height, LNC and LPC) despite high levels of species turnover. The detection of limiting similarity in community assembly was improved when accounting for both intraspecific and interspecific variability. Different components of trait variation respond to different environmental axes, especially soil water content and climatic variables. Our results indicate that intraspecific variation is critical for understanding community assembly and evaluating community response to environmental change."
https://openalex.org/W2402671157,"This study reports on a new ceratopsid, Spiclypeus shipporum gen et sp. nov., from the lower Coal Ridge Member of the Judith River Formation in Montana, USA, which dates to ~76 Ma (upper Campanian). The species is distinguished by rugose dorsal contacts on the premaxillae for the nasals, laterally projecting postorbital horncores, fully fused and anteriorly curled P1 and P2 epiparietals, and a posterodorsally projecting P3 epiparietal. The holotype specimen is also notable for its pathological left squamosal and humerus, which show varied signs of osteomyelitis and osteoarthritis. Although the postorbital horncores of Spiclypeus closely resemble those of the contemporaneous ‘Ceratops’, the horncores of both genera are nevertheless indistinguishable from those of some other horned dinosaurs, including Albertaceratops and Kosmoceratops; ‘Ceratops’ is therefore maintained as a nomen dubium. Cladistic analysis recovers Spiclypeus as the sister taxon to the clade Vagaceratops + Kosmoceratops, and appears transitional in the morphology of its epiparietals. The discovery of Spiclypeus adds to the poorly known dinosaur fauna of the Judith River Formation, and suggests faunal turnover within the formation."
https://openalex.org/W2395451939,"There appears to be little doubt as to the existence of an intentional technological resolve to produce convergent tools during the Middle Palaeolithic. However, the use of these pieces as pointed tools is still subject to debate: i.e., handheld tool vs. hafted tool. Present-day technological analysis has begun to apply new methodologies in order to quantify shape variability and to decipher the role of the morphology of these pieces in relation to function; for instance, geometric morphometric analyses have recently been applied with successful results. This paper presents a study of this type of analysis on 37 convergent tools from level Ga of Payre site (France), dated to MIS 8-7. These pieces are non-standardized knapping products produced by discoidal and orthogonal core technologies. Moreover, macro-wear studies attest to various activities on diverse materials with no evidence of hafting or projectile use. The aim of this paper is to test the geometric morphometric approach on non-standardized artefacts applying the Elliptical Fourier analysis (EFA) to 3D contours and to assess the potential relationship between size and shape, technology and function. This study is innovative in that it is the first time that this method, considered to be a valuable complement for describing technological and functional attributes, is applied to 3D contours of lithic products. Our results show that this methodology ensures a very good degree of accuracy in describing shape variations of the sharp edges of technologically non-standardized convergent tools. EFA on 3D contours indicates variations in deviations of the outline along the third dimension (i.e., dorso-ventrally) and yields quantitative and insightful information on the actual shape variations of tools. Several statistically significant relationships are found between shape variation and use-wear attributes, though the results emphasize the large variability of the shape of the convergent tools, which, in general, does not show a strong direct association with technological features and function. This is in good agreement with the technological context of this chronological period, characterized by a wide diversity of non-standardized tools adapted to multipurpose functions for varied subsistence activities."
https://openalex.org/W2355952544,"X-ray crystallography has shown that an antibody paratope typically binds 15–22 amino acids (aa) of an epitope, of which 2–5 randomly distributed amino acids contribute most of the binding energy. In contrast, researchers typically choose for B-cell epitope mapping short peptide antigens in antibody binding assays. Furthermore, short 6–11-aa epitopes, and in particular non-epitopes, are over-represented in published B-cell epitope datasets that are commonly used for development of B-cell epitope prediction approaches from protein antigen sequences. We hypothesized that such suboptimal length peptides result in weak antibody binding and cause false-negative results. We tested the influence of peptide antigen length on antibody binding by analyzing data on more than 900 peptides used for B-cell epitope mapping of immunodominant proteins of Chlamydia spp. We demonstrate that short 7–12-aa peptides of B-cell epitopes bind antibodies poorly; thus, epitope mapping with short peptide antigens falsely classifies many B-cell epitopes as non-epitopes. We also show in published datasets of confirmed epitopes and non-epitopes a direct correlation between length of peptide antigens and antibody binding. Elimination of short, ≤11-aa epitope/non-epitope sequences improved datasets for evaluation of in silico B-cell epitope prediction. Achieving up to 86% accuracy, protein disorder tendency is the best indicator of B-cell epitope regions for chlamydial and published datasets. For B-cell epitope prediction, the most effective approach is plotting disorder of protein sequences with the IUPred-L scale, followed by antibody reactivity testing of 16–30-aa peptides from peak regions.

Knowledge of B-cell epitopes of proteins is essential in many fields of applied biomedical research, such as antibody diagnostics and therapeutics, vaccines, as well basic research. Laboratory methods for identification of such epitopes are time-consuming and labor-intensive. Hence, any reduction in the need for discovery and confirmatory wet-lab research by epitope prediction algorithms is highly desirable. Among in silico predictive methods from primary sequence information, epitope prediction algorithms are distinguished for their lack of reliability (1Blythe M.J. Flower D.R. Benchmarking B-cell epitope prediction: underperformance of existing methods.Protein Sci. 2005; 14: 246-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). This underperformance prompted us to examine current approaches to B-cell epitope prediction by use of extensive data on epitopes and confirmed non-epitope regions of the Chlamydia spp. proteome, accumulated in research on chlamydial molecular serology (2Rahman K.S.

Among these 15–22 structural epitope residues, about 2–5 aa, termed functional residues, contribute most of the total binding energy to antibodies (6Sivalingam G.N. Shepherd A.J. An analysis of B-cell epitope discontinuity.Mol. Immunol. 2012; 51: 304-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). These functional residues lie only in a very small fraction of B-cell epitopes closely spaced to each other and embedded among the structural residues, representing the classical concept of continuous B-cell epitopes. In the vast majority (≥90%) of B-cell epitopes, functional as well as structural residues are randomly distributed within 15–150-aa linear antigen sequences, essentially representing discontinuous epitopes. Thus, a peptide antigen can effectively bind an antibody only if it contains the majority of the functional residues, and only a small fraction of the short peptides of 4–11 aa will contain sufficient functional residues for high affinity binding (6Sivalingam G.N. Shepherd A.J. An analysis of B-cell epitope discontinuity.Mol. Immunol. 2012; 51: 304-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Therefore, short peptide targets in B-cell epitope mapping and prediction may represent an inherent, unsolvable conundrum, because most of these short peptides, even from proven dominant epitope regions, will fail to bind antibodies strongly and therefore will give many false-negative (non-epitope) results. amino acid complementarity-determining region area under the curve receiver operating characteristic Immune Epitope Database relative light unit not tested positive negative confidence interval. Mammalian immune systems can be forced to generate antibodies against virtually any molecule, regardless of antigen origin, by using excessive amounts of adjuvants and antigens. However, the antibody response did evolve in response to infections that generate much lower antigen exposure, thus antibodies may be preferentially directed toward proteins and peptide regions with certain biological, structural, and physiochemical properties that determine optimal epitopes. Antibody formation during an immune response to any given epitope is inherently stochastic due to the random availability of a cognate B-cell receptor within the large pool of circulating B-cells, all with different B-cell receptors generated by recombination of the immunoglobulin gene (8Brack C. Hirama M. Lenhard-Schuller R. Tonegawa S. A complete immunoglobulin gene is created by somatic recombination.Cell. 1978; 15: 1-14Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). Another level of stochasticity in the antibody response to any given protein is the exposure of a protein to the immune system. Wang et al. (9Wang J. Zhang Y. Lu C. Lei L. Yu P. Zhong G. A genome-wide profiling of the humoral immune response to Chlamydia trachomatis infection reveals vaccine candidate antigens expressed in humans.J. Immunol. 2010; 185: 1670-1680Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) report that only 4.2% of about 900 Chlamydia trachomatis (Ctr) proteins induce natural antibody responses in ≥40% of human hosts. Therefore, any peptide of the remaining 95.8% non-immunodominant proteins is unlikely to elicit antibodies, regardless of its B-cell epitope properties. Hence, for accurate evaluation of epitope prediction methods, epitope/non-epitope data should be derived from testing of known immunodominant proteins, with multiple rather than single sera to account for the stochasticity of the antibody response. B-cell epitope prediction has been first based on various properties of individual amino acids (aa) such as hydrophilicity, hydrophobicity, solvent accessibility, flexibility, or β-turn propensity, and combinations thereof (10Hopp T.P.

With the availability of B-cell epitope databases, antigenicity scales (17Kolaskar A.S. Tongaonkar P.C.

Improved method for linear B-cell epitope prediction using antigen's primary sequence.PLoS ONE. 2013; 8: e62216Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar) have been attempted, and improved prediction accuracy has been reported. Nevertheless, due to epitope redundancy (20El-Manzalawy Y. Dobbs D. Honavar V. Predicting linear B-cell epitopes using string kernels.J. Mol. Recognit. 2008; 21: 243-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar), the predictive power may have been overestimated because these algorithms performed poorly on independent data (24Singh H. Ansari H.R. Raghava G.P. Improved method for linear B-cell epitope prediction using antigen's primary sequence.PLoS ONE. 2013; 8: e62216Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Therefore, B-cell epitope prediction algorithms must be evaluated on independent datasets that had not been used to train/develop the algorithms/scales. The ever increasing number of solved three-dimensional protein structures has allowed the development and testing of numerous complex algorithms for prediction of physicochemical and structural properties of proteins directly from the aa sequences. Among these properties (scales), disorder tendency describes protein regions without defined three-dimensional structure that are inherently flexible, hydrophilic, solvent accessible, and thermally mobile (high B-factor) (25Uversky V.N. Unusual biophysics of intrinsically disordered proteins.Biochim Biophys Acta. 2013; 1834: 932-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar, 26Uversky V.N. A decade and a half of protein intrinsic disorder: biology still waits for physics.Protein Sci. 2013; 22: 693-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). Incidentally, all of these properties are shared with B-cell epitopes (16Ponomarenko J.V. Van Regenmortel M.H. Bourne P.E. Gu J. Structural Bioinformatics. 2nd Ed. John Wiley, Hoboken, NJ2009: 849-879Google Scholar); thus, protein disorder tendency is a prime candidate scale for B-cell epitope prediction due to its multifaceted properties (27Liu Z. Huang Y. Advantages of proteins being disordered.Protein Sci. 2014; 23: 539-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). This investigation is an extension of a comprehensive study that identified immunodominant B-cell epitopes of Chlamydia spp. (2Rahman K.S. Chowdhury E.U. Poudel A. Ruettger A. Sachse K. Kaltenboeck B. Defining species-specific immunodominant B-cell epitopes for molecular serology of Chlamydia species.Clin. Vaccine Immunol. 2015; 22: 539-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). After encountering numerous failures of in silico B-cell epitope prediction, we used the first principles established above to analyze the shortcomings of B-cell prediction methodology. Using pools of hyperimmune mouse sera, we determined epitope/non-epitope regions of immunodominant Chlamydia spp. proteins by use of long 16–40-aa peptide antigens. These data created epitope/non-epitope datasets for accurate testing of numerous B-cell epitope prediction or aa/protein property algorithms/scales (henceforth termed scales). Subsequent testing revealed that public datasets were biased toward short epitope/non-epitope antigens, and removal of these short antigens dramatically increased prediction accuracy of most scales. We show that in general machine learning methods cannot predict epitopes with high accuracy; rather, many scales designed for prediction of protein properties, particularly disorder tendency, identify B-cell epitopes with better accuracy. Hyperimmune sera were raised in mice as described previously (2Rahman K.S. Chowdhury E.U. Poudel A. Ruettger A. Sachse K. Kaltenboeck B. Defining species-specific immunodominant B-cell epitopes for molecular serology of Chlamydia species.Clin. Vaccine Immunol. 2015; 22: 539-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Briefly, 9–50 mice were challenged three times with high but non-lethal intranasal chlamydial inocula, to mimic antibody production following natural infections. Bovine sera used were obtained from animals with PCR-confirmed natural Chlamydia spp. infection (2Rahman K.S. Chowdhury E.U. Poudel A. Ruettger A. Sachse K. Kaltenboeck B. Defining species-specific immunodominant B-cell epitopes for molecular serology of Chlamydia species.Clin. Vaccine Immunol. 2015; 22: 539-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Peptide antigens were chemically synthesized with N-terminal biotin, captured onto streptavidin-coated microtiter plates, and incubated with hyperimmune sera. Primary antibodies were detected with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies in chemiluminescent ELISA, and data were expressed as relative light units/s (rlu/s) and for ease of display were divided by 1,000 (rlu/s × 10−3) (2Rahman K.S. Chowdhury E.U. Poudel A. Ruettger A. Sachse K. Kaltenboeck B. Defining species-specific immunodominant B-cell epitopes for molecular serology of Chlamydia species.Clin. Vaccine Immunol. 2015; 22: 539-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). All peptides were analyzed on white microtiter plates by use of specific positive pooled hyperimmune sera as well as negative control sera in wells coated with specific peptides and in a non-coated well. For the final background-corrected results, 150% of the background signal (mean + 2 S.D.) in the non-coated well of each serum was subtracted from its specific peptide signals. To avoid false-positive results in quantitative evaluation of the reactivity of any peptide with individual mouse sera, and with bovine sera from naturally infected cattle, we used a more stringent cutoff of 10,000 rlu/s. Overall methods are described in detail by Rahman et al. (2Rahman K.S. Chowdhury E.U. Poudel A. Ruettger A. Sachse K. Kaltenboeck B. Defining species-specific immunodominant B-cell epitopes for molecular serology of Chlamydia species.Clin. Vaccine Immunol. 2015; 22: 539-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). These datasets are described briefly below, and a detailed description is provided in supplemental Table S1, and sequences are provided in the supplemental Appendix. Epitopes and non-epitopes of the Lbtope_Fixed_non_redundant and Lbtope_ Confirm datasets (24Singh H. Ansari H.R. Raghava G.P. Improved method for linear B-cell epitope prediction using antigen's primary sequence.PLoS ONE. 2013; 8: e62216Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar) were grouped by sequence length. Concatenated polyproteins of the sequences of each group were constructed by randomly combining all sequences. Similarly, concatenated polyproteins of Swiss-Prot sequences were constructed by randomly combining all sequences of the BCP12, BCP14, or BCP18 datasets (20El-Manzalawy Y. Dobbs D. Honavar V. Predicting linear B-cell epitopes using string kernels.J. Mol. Recognit. 2008; 21: 243-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar). All 16–20-aa epitopes of Lbtope_Confirm and fbcpred.pos.nr80 datasets were extended symmetrically to 50 aa with source protein sequences. These fragments were interspersed with random 150-aa Swiss-Prot sequences into a concatenated virtual polyprotein. Similar polyproteins were assembled from all 16–33-aa non-epitopes of the Lbtope_Confirm dataset and all epitopes/non-epitopes of the Chl_18Prot and Chl_43Prot datasets. For assembly of additional non-epitope datasets, random 50-aa peptides of the Bcpreds epitope source proteins (Bcpreds_Prot), Swiss-Prot proteins, and the C. trachomatis proteome (28Stephens R.S. Kalman S. Lammel C. Fan J. Marathe R. Aravind L. Mitchell W. Olinger L. Tatusov R.L. Zhao Q. Koonin E.V. Davis R.W. Genome sequence of an obligate intracellular pathogen of humans: Chlamydia trachomatis.Science. 1998; 282: 754-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (1283) Google Scholar) were similarly linked with 150-aa interspacing sequences into concatenated polyproteins. All residues of 18 immunodominant proteins of Chlamydia spp. were annotated in the Chl_18Prot dataset as Pos (positive, epitope), Neg (negative, non-epitope), or NT (not tested, unknown epitope status). The annotation is based on the reactivity of 16–20-aa peptide antigens with murine and/or bovine sera. For peptide datasets, 10-aa-spaced peptides of these proteins were used.

https://openalex.org/W2407902626,"Human neutrophils have been known to release neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), antimicrobial DNA structures capable of capturing and killing microbes. Recently, a similar phenomenon has been reported in macrophages infected with various pathogens. However, a role for macrophages extracellular traps (METs) in host defense responses against Mycobacterium massiliense (M. mass) has yet to be described. In this study, we show that M. mass, a rapid growing mycobacterium (RGM), also induces the release of METs from PMA-differentiated THP-1 cells. Intriguingly, this process is not dependent on NADPH oxidase activity, which regulates NET formation. Instead, M. mass-induced MET formation partially depends on calcium influx and requires phagocytosis of high bacterial load. The METs consist of a DNA backbone embedded with microbicidal proteins such as histone, MPO and elastase. Released METs entrap M. mass and prevent their dissemination, but do not have bactericidal activity. Instead, they result in enhanced bacterial growth. In this regard, METs were considered to provide interaction of M. mass with cells and an environment for bacterial aggregation, which may facilitate mycobacterial survival and growth. In conclusion, our results demonstrate METs as an innate defense response against M. mass infection, and suggest that extracellular traps play a multifaceted role in the interplay between host and bacteria."
https://openalex.org/W2402306925,"Ocelots (Leopardus pardalis) are presumed to be the most abundant of the wild cats throughout their distribution range and to play an important role in the dynamics of sympatric small-felid populations. However, ocelot ecological information is limited, particularly for the Amazon. We conducted three camera-trap surveys during three consecutive dry seasons to estimate ocelot density in Amanã Reserve, Central Amazonia, Brazil. We implemented a spatial capture-recapture (SCR) model that shared detection parameters among surveys. A total effort of 7020 camera-trap days resulted in 93 independent ocelot records. The estimate of ocelot density in Amanã Reserve (24.84 ± SE 6.27 ocelots per 100 km2) was lower than at other sites in the Amazon and also lower than that expected from a correlation of density with latitude and rainfall. We also discuss the importance of using common parameters for survey scenarios with low recapture rates. This is the first density estimate for ocelots in the Brazilian Amazon, which is an important stronghold for the species."
https://openalex.org/W2403838837,"Antiretrovirals suppress HIV-1 production yet spare the sites of HIV-1 production, the HIV-1 DNA-harboring cells that evade immune detection and enable viral resistance on-drug and viral rebound off-drug. Therapeutic ablation of pathogenic cells markedly improves the outcome of many diseases. We extend this strategy to HIV-1 infection. Using drug-based lead discovery, we report the concentration threshold-dependent antiretroviral action of the medicinal chelator deferiprone and validate preclinical findings by a proof-of-concept double-blind trial. In isolate-infected primary cultures, supra-threshold concentrations during deferiprone monotherapy caused decline of HIV-1 RNA and HIV-1 DNA; did not allow viral breakthrough for up to 35 days on-drug, indicating resiliency against viral resistance; and prevented, for at least 87 days off-drug, viral rebound. Displaying a steep dose-effect curve, deferiprone produced infection-independent deficiency of hydroxylated hypusyl-eIF5A. However, unhydroxylated deoxyhypusyl-eIF5A accumulated particularly in HIV-infected cells; they preferentially underwent apoptotic DNA fragmentation. Since the threshold, ascertained at about 150 μM, is achievable in deferiprone-treated patients, we proceeded from cell culture directly to an exploratory trial. HIV-1 RNA was measured after 7 days on-drug and after 28 and 56 days off-drug. Subjects who attained supra-threshold concentrations in serum and completed the protocol of 17 oral doses, experienced a zidovudine-like decline of HIV-1 RNA on-drug that was maintained off-drug without statistically significant rebound for 8 weeks, over 670 times the drug’s half-life and thus clearance from circulation. The uniform deferiprone threshold is in agreement with mapping of, and crystallographic 3D-data on, the active site of deoxyhypusyl hydroxylase (DOHH), the eIF5A-hydroxylating enzyme. We propose that deficiency of hypusine-containing eIF5A impedes the translation of mRNAs encoding proline cluster (‘polyproline’)-containing proteins, exemplified by Gag/p24, and facilitated by the excess of deoxyhypusine-containing eIF5A, releases the innate apoptotic defense of HIV-infected cells from viral blockade, thus depleting the cellular reservoir of HIV-1 DNA that drives breakthrough and rebound.

https://openalex.org/W2403984453,"To determine the frequency of different types of spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) scan artifacts and errors in ganglion cell algorithm (GCA) in healthy eyes.Infrared image, color-coded map and each of the 128 horizontal b-scans acquired in the macular ganglion cell-inner plexiform layer scans using the Cirrus HD-OCT (Carl Zeiss Meditec, Dublin, CA) macular cube 512 × 128 protocol in 30 healthy normal eyes were evaluated. The frequency and pattern of each artifact was determined. Deviation of the segmentation line was classified into mild (less than 10 microns), moderate (10-50 microns) and severe (more than 50 microns). Each deviation, if present, was noted as upward or downward deviation. Each artifact was further described as per location on the scan and zones in the total scan area.A total of 1029 (26.8%) out of total 3840 scans had scan errors. The most common scan error was segmentation error (100%), followed by degraded images (6.70%), blink artifacts (0.09%) and out of register artifacts (3.3%). Misidentification of the inner retinal layers was most frequent (62%). Upward Deviation of the segmentation line (47.91%) and severe deviation (40.3%) were more often noted. Artifacts were mostly located in the central scan area (16.8%). The average number of scans with artifacts per eye was 34.3% and was not related to signal strength on Spearman correlation (p = 0.36).This study reveals that image artifacts and scan errors in SD-OCT GCA analysis are common and frequently involve segmentation errors. These errors may affect inner retinal thickness measurements in a clinically significant manner. Careful review of scans for artifacts is important when using this feature of SD-OCT device."
https://openalex.org/W2407578119,"The increasing prevalence of respiratory diseases in Chinese children has focused attention on indoor environmental quality. We investigated associations between perceived air quality in domestic environments and children’s allergic diseases with a questionnaire survey study. A total of 4017 children aged 1–8 years old from 23 kindergartens in urban, suburban and industrial areas in Nanjing were randomly recruited for this study. Parents’ perceived odors, including stuffy odor, unpleasant odor, pungent odor, moldy odor, humid air and dry air were found to be associated with asthma, wheeze, dry cough and rhinitis (P < 0.05). Both perceived dry and humid air were found to be positively associated with dampness indices, and we present evidence that the sensation of dryness may not be due to the actual indoor relative humidity, but rather to indoor air irritants. Parents’ perception of odors and relative humidity may be indicators of environment pollutants, which are likely the real factors associated with children’s allergic diseases."

https://openalex.org/W2406745862,"We developed the Sussex Cognitive Styles Questionnaire (SCSQ) to investigate visual and verbal processing preferences and incorporate global/local processing orientations and systemising into a single, comprehensive measure. In Study 1 (N = 1542), factor analysis revealed six reliable subscales to the final 60 item questionnaire: Imagery Ability (relating to the use of visual mental imagery in everyday life); Technical/Spatial (relating to spatial mental imagery, and numerical and technical cognition); Language & Word Forms; Need for Organisation; Global Bias; and Systemising Tendency. Thus, we replicate previous findings that visual and verbal styles are separable, and that types of imagery can be subdivided. We extend previous research by showing that spatial imagery clusters with other abstract cognitive skills, and demonstrate that global/local bias can be separated from systemising. Study 2 validated the Technical/Spatial and Language & Word Forms factors by showing that they affect performance on memory tasks. In Study 3, we validated Imagery Ability, Technical/Spatial, Language & Word Forms, Global Bias, and Systemising Tendency by issuing the SCSQ to a sample of synaesthetes (N = 121) who report atypical cognitive profiles on these subscales. Thus, the SCSQ consolidates research from traditionally disparate areas of cognitive science into a comprehensive cognitive style measure, which can be used in the general population, and special populations."
https://openalex.org/W2399122498,"In a number of crop species hybrids are able to outperform line varieties. The anthers of the autogamous bread wheat plant are normally extruded post anthesis, a trait which is unfavourable for the production of F1 hybrid grain. Higher anther extrusion (AE) promotes cross fertilization for more efficient hybrid seed production. Therefore, this study aimed at the genetic dissection of AE by genome wide association studies (GWAS) and determination of the main effect QTL. We applied GWAS approach to identify DArT markers potentially linked to AE to unfold its genetic basis in a panel of spring wheat accessions. Phenotypic data were collected for three years and best linear unbiased estimate (BLUE) values were calculated across all years. The extent of the AE correlation between growing years and BLUE values ranged from r = +0.56 (2013 vs 2015) to 0.91 (2014 vs BLUE values). The broad sense heritability was 0.84 across all years. Six accessions displayed stable AE >80% across all the years. Genotyping data included 2,575 DArT markers (with minimum of 0.05 minor allele frequency applied). AE was influenced both by genotype and by the growing environment. In all, 131 significant marker trait associations (MTAs) (|log10 (P)| >FDR) were established for AE. AE behaved as a quantitative trait, with five consistently significant markers (significant across at least two years with a significant BLUE value) contributing a minor to modest proportion (4.29% to 8.61%) of the phenotypic variance and affecting the trait either positively or negatively. For this reason, there is potential for breeding for improved AE by gene pyramiding. The consistently significant markers linked to AE could be helpful for marker assisted selection to transfer AE to high yielding varieties allowing to promote the exploitation of hybrid-heterosis in the key crop wheat."
https://openalex.org/W2394718970,"Objective To study the prevalence of primary monosymptopomatic nocturnal enuresis (PMNE) in children aged 5–10 year and to find its association with sleep disordered breathing (SDB) by using a 22 item pediatric sleep related breathing disorder (SRBD) scale. Methods This was a school based cross sectional epidemiological study from July 2015 to November 2015. A questionnaire seeking information on socio-demographic variables, nocturnal enuresis (NE) frequency, school performance and a validated 22 item pediatric sleep related breathing disorder scale (SRBDs) was distributed to 1820 pupils in three primary schools. Results A total of 1528(83.95%) questionnaires were retrieved. Out of 1528 forms, 182(11.9%) forms were incomplete for requested information and hence 1346 (73.9%) questionnaires were finally analyzed. The prevalence of NE was found to be 12.7% (95% CI; 11–14.6), whereas prevalence of primary nocturnal enuresis (PMNE) was 8.2% (95% CI; 7.1–10.1). SRBD scale score >0.33 (adjusted OR: 2.87; 95%CI: 1.67–4.92), paternal history of enuresis in childhood (adjusted OR:4.96; 95% CI: 2.36–10.45), and inappropriate toilet training (adjusted OR: 1.64; 95% CI: 1.01–2.66) were independently associated with PMNE. Conclusion Sleep disordered breathing, inappropriate toilet training and a history of childhood NE in father were found to be significant risk factors for PMNE in the present study. Thus, these findings suggest that it is imperative to rule out SDB in PMNE patients as they may require different therapeutic interventions."
https://openalex.org/W2397044562,"Pseudomonas putida DLL-E4 can efficiently degrade para-nitrophenol and its intermediate metabolite hydroquinone. The regulation of para-nitrophenol degradation was studied, and PNP induced a global change in the transcriptome of P. putida DLL-E4. When grown on PNP, the wild-type strain exhibited significant downregulation of 2912 genes and upregulation of 845 genes, whereas 2927 genes were downregulated and 891 genes upregulated in a pnpR-deleted strain. Genes related to two non-coding RNAs (ins1 and ins2), para-nitrophenol metabolism, the tricarboxylic acid cycle, the outer membrane porin OprB, glucose dehydrogenase Gcd, and carbon catabolite repression were significantly upregulated when cells were grown on para-nitrophenol plus glucose. pnpA, pnpR, pnpC1C2DECX1X2, and pnpR1 are key genes in para-nitrophenol degradation, whereas pnpAb and pnpC1bC2bDbEbCbX1bX2b have lost the ability to degrade para-nitrophenol. Multiple components including transcriptional regulators and other unknown factors regulate para-nitrophenol degradation, and the transcriptional regulation of para-nitrophenol degradation is complex. Glucose utilization was enhanced at early stages of para-nitrophenol supplementation. However, it was inhibited after the total consumption of para-nitrophenol. The addition of glucose led to a significant enhancement in para-nitrophenol degradation and up-regulation in the expression of genes involved in para-nitrophenol degradation and carbon catabolite repression (CCR). It seemed that para-nitrophenol degradation can be regulated by CCR, and relief of CCR might contribute to enhanced para-nitrophenol degradation. In brief, the regulation of para-nitrophenol degradation seems to be controlled by multiple factors and requires further study."
https://openalex.org/W2404269891,"A number of mammals and birds are known to be capable of visually discriminating between familiar and unfamiliar individuals, depending on facial patterns in some species. Many fish also visually recognize other conspecifics individually, and previous studies report that facial color patterns can be an initial signal for individual recognition. For example, a cichlid fish and a damselfish will use individual-specific color patterns that develop only in the facial area. However, it remains to be determined whether the facial area is an especially favorable site for visual signals in fish, and if so why? The monogamous discus fish, Symphysopdon aequifasciatus (Cichlidae), is capable of visually distinguishing its pair-partner from other conspecifics. Discus fish have individual-specific coloration patterns on entire body including the facial area, frontal head, trunk and vertical fins. If the facial area is an inherently important site for the visual cues, this species will use facial patterns for individual recognition, but otherwise they will use patterns on other body parts as well. We used modified digital models to examine whether discus fish use only facial coloration for individual recognition. Digital models of four different combinations of familiar and unfamiliar fish faces and bodies were displayed in frontal and lateral views. Focal fish frequently performed partner-specific displays towards partner-face models, and did aggressive displays towards models of non-partner's faces. We conclude that to identify individuals this fish does not depend on frontal color patterns but does on lateral facial color patterns, although they have unique color patterns on the other parts of body. We discuss the significance of facial coloration for individual recognition in fish compared with birds and mammals."
https://openalex.org/W2397794644,"Over half of adults are seropositive for JC polyomavirus (JCV), but rare individuals develop progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), a demyelinating JCV infection of the central nervous system. Previously, PML was primarily seen in immunosuppressed patients with AIDS or certain cancers, but it has recently emerged as a drug safety issue through its association with diverse immunomodulatory therapies. To better understand the relationship between the JCV life cycle and PML pathology, we studied autopsy brain tissue from a 70-year-old psoriasis patient on the integrin alpha-L inhibitor efalizumab following a ~2 month clinical course of PML. Sequence analysis of lesional brain tissue identified PML-associated viral mutations in regulatory (non-coding control region) DNA, capsid protein VP1, and the regulatory agnoprotein, as well as 9 novel mutations in capsid protein VP2, indicating rampant viral evolution. Nine samples, including three gross PML lesions and normal-appearing adjacent tissues, were characterized by histopathology and subject to quantitative genomic, proteomic, and molecular localization analyses. We observed a striking correlation between the spatial extent of demyelination, axonal destruction, and dispersion of JCV along white matter myelin sheath. Our observations in this case, as well as in a case of PML-like disease in an immunocompromised rhesus macaque, suggest that long-range spread of polyomavirus and axonal destruction in PML might involve extracellular association between virus and the white matter myelin sheath."
https://openalex.org/W2398300918,"We report generation of induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines from ten Parkinson’s disease (PD) patients carrying SNCA, PARK2, LRRK2, and GBA mutations, and one age-matched control. After validation of pluripotency, long-term genome stability, and integration-free reprogramming, eight of these lines (one of each SNCA, LRRK2 and GBA, four PARK2 lines, and the control) were differentiated into neural stem cells (NSC) and subsequently to dopaminergic cultures. We did not observe significant differences in the timeline of neural induction and NSC derivation between the patient and control line, nor amongst the patient lines, although we report considerable variability in the efficiency of dopaminergic differentiation among patient lines. We performed whole genome expression analyses of the lines at each stage of differentiation (fibroblast, iPSC, NSC, and dopaminergic culture) in an attempt to identify alterations by large-scale evaluation. While gene expression profiling clearly distinguished cells at different stages of differentiation, no mutation-specific clustering or difference was observed, though consistent changes in patient lines were detected in genes associated mitochondrial biology. We further examined gene expression in a stress model (MPTP-induced dopaminergic neuronal death) using two clones from the SNCA triplication line, and detected changes in genes associated with mitophagy. Our data suggested that even a well-characterized line of a monogenic disease may not be sufficient to determine the cause or mechanism of the disease, and highlights the need to use more focused strategies for large-scale data analysis."
https://openalex.org/W2469780996,"An elaborate network of dynamic lipid membranes, termed tubular recycling endosomes (TRE), coordinates the process of endocytic recycling in mammalian cells. The C-terminal Eps15 homology domain (EHD)-containing proteins have been implicated in the bending and fission of TRE, thus regulating endocytic recycling. EHD proteins have an EH domain that interacts with proteins containing an NPF motif. We found that NPF-containing EHD1 interaction partners such as molecules interacting with CasL-like1 (MICAL-L1) and Syndapin2 are essential for TRE biogenesis. Also crucial for TRE biogenesis is the generation of phosphatidic acid, an essential lipid component of TRE that serves as a docking point for MICAL-L1 and Syndapin2. EHD1 and EHD3 have 86% amino acid identity; they homo- and heterodimerize and partially co-localize to TRE. Despite their remarkable identity, they have distinct mechanistic functions. EHD1 induces membrane vesiculation, whereas EHD3 supports TRE biogenesis and/or stabilization by an unknown mechanism. While using phospholipase D inhibitors (which block the conversion of glycerophospholipids to phosphatidic acid) to deplete cellular TRE, we observed that, upon inhibitor washout, there was a rapid and dramatic regeneration of MICAL-L1-marked TRE. Using this synchronized TRE biogenesis system, we determined that EHD3 is involved in the stabilization of TRE rather than in their biogenesis. Moreover, we identify the residues Ala-519/Asp-520 of EHD1 and Asn-519/Glu-520 of EHD3 as defining the selectivity of these two paralogs for NPF-containing binding partners, and we present a model to explain the atomic mechanism and provide new insight for their differential roles in vesiculation and tubulation, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W2352584037,"NADPH-cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase transfers electrons from NADPH to cytochromes P450 via its FAD and FMN. To understand the biochemical and structural basis of electron transfer from FMN-hydroquinone to its partners, three deletion mutants in a conserved loop near the FMN were characterized. Comparison of oxidized and reduced wild type and mutant structures reveals that the basis for the air stability of the neutral blue semiquinone is protonation of the flavin N5 and strong H-bond formation with the Gly-141 carbonyl. The ΔGly-143 protein had moderately decreased activity with cytochrome P450 and cytochrome c. It formed a flexible loop, which transiently interacts with the flavin N5, resulting in the generation of both an unstable neutral blue semiquinone and hydroquinone. The ΔGly-141 and ΔG141/E142N mutants were inactive with cytochrome P450 but fully active in reducing cytochrome c. In the ΔGly-141 mutants, the backbone amide of Glu/Asn-142 forms an H-bond to the N5 of the oxidized flavin, which leads to formation of an unstable red anionic semiquinone with a more negative potential than the hydroquinone. The semiquinone of ΔG141/E142N was slightly more stable than that of ΔGly-141, consistent with its crystallographically demonstrated more rigid loop. Nonetheless, both ΔGly-141 red semiquinones were less stable than those of the corresponding loop in cytochrome P450 BM3 and the neuronal NOS mutant (ΔGly-810). Our results indicate that the catalytic activity of cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase is a function of the length, sequence, and flexibility of the 140s loop and illustrate the sophisticated variety of biochemical mechanisms employed in fine-tuning its redox properties and function.

https://openalex.org/W2396600651,"Among mammals, individuals form strong social bonds preferentially with their kin. Differences in these relationships are linked to differential kin availability due to sex-specific dispersal patterns, but there is some indication that differential bonding among sexes already occurs prior to maturation. However, little is known about how these patterns arise during individual development. Here we investigated sex differences in the development of mother-offspring bonds in rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta). Our results revealed that mothers showed sex-biased bonding toward their offspring. Sons had a distinctly higher probability of receiving aggression from their mothers than did daughters in the first year of life, while no differences were found with respect to affiliative interactions. After the first year, probabilities of all affiliative and aggressive behaviours investigated were higher for daughters than for sons, although generally declining. Furthermore, sons spending less time with their mother and receiving more maternal aggression tended to disperse earlier. The results of our study suggest that mothers influence their bonding strength with offspring by interacting less affiliative with sons than daughters."

PimA belongs to a large family of membrane-associated glycosyltransferases for which the understanding of the molecular mechanism and conformational changes that govern substrate/membrane recognition and catalysis remains a major challenge. Here, we determined that PimA preferentially binds to negatively charged phosphatidyl-myo-inositol substrate and non-substrate membrane model systems (small unilamellar vesicle) through its N-terminal domain, inducing an important structural reorganization of anionic phospholipids. By using a combination of single-point mutagenesis, circular dichroism, and a variety of fluorescence spectroscopy techniques, we determined that this interaction is mainly mediated by an amphipathic α-helix (α2), which undergoes a substantial conformational change and localizes in the vicinity of the negatively charged lipid headgroups and the very first carbon atoms of the acyl chains, at the PimA-phospholipid interface. Interestingly, a flexible region within the N-terminal domain, which undergoes β-strand-to-α-helix and α-helix-to-β-strand transitions during catalysis, interacts with anionic phospholipids; however, the effect is markedly less pronounced to that observed for the amphipathic α2, likely reflecting structural plasticity/variability.

The largest differences are localized in the flexible region corresponding to residues 118–163, which represent a substantial portion of the N-terminal “Rossmann-fold” domain. The extended and compact apo-forms of PimA display a conserved anti-parallel β-strand (β6) and the two flexible α-helices (α4 and α5), whereas the PimA-GDP-Man conformation exhibits the equivalent β-strand in a parallel orientation and three α-helices, α41 (residues 122–132), α42 (residues 134–140), and α5 (residues 148–160), with a novel structural arrangement (Fig. 1, B and C). Importantly, a detailed inspection of the crystal structures of the apo-forms of PimA suggested that they correspond to an inactive conformation. This interpretation was supported by mutagenesis studies in which the two different conformations, apo-form and GDP-Man-bound forms, have been locked with disulfide bridges and then used for isothermal titration calorimetry and enzyme activity assays in the presence and absence of reducing agents (12.Giganti D.

Another key aspect of the mode of action of PimA is its interaction with the lipid acceptor PI and the mycobacterial membrane. A close association of PimA with the lipid bilayer is likely to be a strict requirement for PI modification (5.Korduláková J. Gilleron M. Mikusova K. Puzo G. Brennan P.J. Gicquel B. Jackson M.

Despite the fact that sugar transfer is catalyzed between the mannosyl group of the GDP-Man donor and the myo-inositol ring of PI (11.Guerin M.E. Kordulakova J. Schaeffer F. Svetlikova Z.

Interestingly, PimA was able to interact with a mono-disperse PI analog with shorter acyl chains (1,2-dioctanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoinositol), for which the critical micellar concentration (CMC) has been experimentally reported as 60 μm (16.Rebecchi M.J.

However, its transferase activity was stimulated by diC8PI at a concentration of 300 μm (i.e. five times the CMC) or high concentrations of non-substrate anionic surfactants, such as cardiolipin or 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphate, but not with the zwitterion phosphatidylethanolamine or 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycerol, indicating that the reaction requires a lipid-water interface (11.Guerin M.E.

Inspection of the crystal structure of PimA suggested that the presence of an amphipathic α-helix (α2-helix; residues 72–87) and surface-exposed hydrophobic residues in the N-terminal domain of the protein could mediate the association of PimA with anionic phospholipids via electrostatic interactions (11.Guerin M.E.

The crystal structure of PimA in the presence of GDP and diC8PI at 500 μm (∼10 times its CMC) revealed remarkable structural differences located in the dynamic region of the N-terminal domain, suggesting that diC8PI micelles could act as an inducer of the observed conformational changes. The near-UV CD spectrum of PimA in solution exhibited a broad positive signal characteristic of constrained aromatic side chains in the protein. The addition of diC8PI at sub-CMC concentrations did not change the spectrum. In contrast, the addition of diC8PI micelles induced a loss of the tertiary structure constraints on aromatic side chains, as indicated by the absence of dichroic signal. This result clearly indicates that PimA aromatic side chains gain freedom in the presence of diC8PI micelles. This lipid-induced destabilization was also observed in thermal unfolding experiments followed by CD in the far-UV region (12.Giganti D. Albesa-Jové D. Urresti S. Rodrigo-Unzueta A.

Such a loss of cooperativity upon diC8PI binding is characteristic of membrane-bound proteins lacking tertiary structure interactions (17.Lindeberg M. Zakharov S.D. Cramer W.A.

In line with these results, limited proteolysis experiments in the presence of diC8PI micelles or anionic SUVs increased the susceptibility of PimA to proteolysis (12.Giganti D. Albesa-Jové D.

To further advance the molecular mechanism of PimA association to the lipid acceptor PI and to the membrane, we have used a combination of single-point mutagenesis, circular dichroism, and several spectroscopy techniques, including microscale technology (MST), intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence, tryptophan fluorescence anisotropy, and fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET). We propose a plausible model for PI and membrane interaction, which might prove useful for the comprehension of the peripheral membrane-associated GT-Bs at the molecular level.

Hexanoyl-1-hexadecanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (HPC) labeled with 2-(6-(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl)amino) (NBD) at C6 (NBD-C6-HPC) or C12 (NBD-C12-HPC) positions along the acyl chain were used for fluorescence anisotropy experiments. Stock solutions at 12.5 mm of each NBD-HPC were prepared in 100% ethanol. NBD-C6-HPC or NBD-C12-HPC was incorporated at 0.5% into 2 mm DOPC, DOPC/DOPG, or DOPC/PI preformed SUVs, vortexing vigorously, and incubating for 30 min at room temperature. To perform FRET experiments, N-(5-dimethylaminonaphthalene-1-sulfonyl)-1,2-dihexadecanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (dansyl-DHPE; Invitrogen), was mixedwith methanol and dissolved by sonication to give a 12.5 mm stock solution. SUVs containing dansyl were prepared from dansyl-DHPE/DOPC at 9.5:0.5 and DOPC/DOPG and DOPC/PI at a 4.25:4.25:0.5 molar ratio. MST analyses were carried out with a Monolith NT LabelFree instrument (Nano Temper, Munich, Germany). A titration series was prepared, in which the concentration of PimA WT was kept constant at 1 μm. The concentrations of the titrants (DOPC, DOPC/DOPG (50:50), and DOPC/PI (50:50) SUVs) were varied (60 nm to 2 mm) in 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 33 mm NaCl. MST measurements were performed at room temperature after 5 min of incubation. Standard treated capillaries (K002 Monolith NT.115) were loaded with the samples, and all measurements were performed three times. For each measurement, the laser was switched on for 30 s and off for 5 s. Binding curves were obtained from the thermophoresis T-jump phase, with IR laser power at 10%. The average Kd values were calculated after analysis of the data with KaleidaGraph software. Measurements were performed with an FP-6200 spectrofluorometer (Jasco, Japan) equipped with a Peltier-thermostated cell holder, using 0.1-ml samples in 1-cm path length quartz cells (111-QS from Hellma). A bandwidth of 5 nm was used for the excitation and emission beams. The excitation wavelength was fixed at 290 nm, and the emission spectra were recorded at 25 °C from 300 to 400 nm at a scan rate of 125 nm/min. PimA concentration was 1 μm in 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, and it was added to 1 mm SUVs prepared in the same buffer from DOPC for neutral vesicles, and DOPC/PI or DOPC/DOPG at a 50:50 molar ratio. For the three double mutants a 3 μm concentration was used to have similar intensity signals compared with those from the PimA wild type. The ratio of fluorescence intensities emitted at 320 and 360 nm (FIR320/360) represents the average of three replicates obtained from emission spectra that were previously corrected for buffer effects. Measurements were performed in the same equipment and in the same experimental conditions described under “Intrinsic Tryptophan Fluorescence.” A bandwidth of 5 nm was used for the excitation and emission beams. For the Trp excitation the wavelength was fixed at 290 nm, and the emission spectra were recorded at 25 °C with a scan rate of 500 nm/min. Emission spectra were recorded from 300 to 400 nm. PimA and three double mutant concentration was 5 μm in 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, and it was added to 1 mm SUVs. Steady-state fluorescence anisotropy experiments were performed with vertically (V) and horizontally (H) polarized beam light using FDP-223 polarizers at both excitation (x) and emission (m) apertures. Anisotropy (r) was calculated as shown in Equation 1, r = V x V m - H x V m H x H m V x V m V x V m + 2 H x V m H x H m V x H m (Eq. 1) The r values represent the average of three replicates obtained from emission spectra that were previously corrected for buffer effects. An unpaired t test (p < 0.0001) was performed between data sets. The intensity values were recorded from 300 to 400 nm with one value per wavelength and in triplicate, hence n = 303. The kinetic mode was used to follow the intensity of maximum emission for the dansyl group at 515 nm during 1,000 s. A bandwidth of 5 nm was used for the excitation and emission beams. The excitation wavelength was fixed at 280 nm to excite the Trp, and the emission was recorded at 25 °C. The intensity coming from dansylated SUVs at 1 mm lipid concentration was recorded during 200 s. The intensity coming from 1 mm dansylated SUVs was recorded during 200 s.

https://openalex.org/W2398978968,"Background Tuberculosis (TB) is the leading cause of death from an infectious pathogen worldwide and the most prevalent opportunistic infection in people living with HIV. Isoniazid preventive therapy (IPT) reduces the incidence of active TB and reduces morbidity and mortality in HIV-infected patients independently of antiretroviral therapy. However, treatment of latent or active TB is lengthy and inter-patient variability in pharmacokinetics and adherence common. Current methods of assessing adherence to TB treatment using drug levels in plasma or urine assess short-term exposure and pose logistical challenges. Drug concentrations in hair assess long-term exposure and have demonstrated pharmacodynamic relevance in HIV. Methods A large hair sample from a patient with active TB was obtained for assay development. Methods to pulverize hair and extract isoniazid were optimized and then the drug detected by liquid chromatography/ tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS-MS). The method was validated for specificity, accuracy, precision, recovery, linearity and stability to establish the assay’s suitability for therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM). Hair samples from patients on directly-observe isoniazid-based latent or active TB therapy from the San Francisco Department of Public Health TB clinic were then tested. Results Our LC/MS-MS-based assay detected isoniazid in quantities as low as 0.02ng/mg using 10–25 strands hair. Concentrations in spiked samples demonstrated linearity from 0.05–50ng/mg. Assay precision and accuracy for spiked quality-control samples were high, with an overall recovery rate of 79.5%. In 18 patients with latent or active TB on treatment, isoniazid was detected across a wide linear dynamic range. Conclusions An LC-MS/MS-based assay to quantify isoniazid levels in hair with performance characteristics suitable for TDM was developed and validated. Hair concentrations of isoniazid assess long-term exposure and may be useful for monitoring adherence to latent or active TB treatment in the setting of HIV."
https://openalex.org/W2399937873,"Presentation of music as vibration to the skin has the potential to facilitate interaction between musicians with hearing impairments and other musicians during group performance. Vibrotactile thresholds have been determined to assess the potential for vibrotactile presentation of music to the glabrous skin of the fingertip, forefoot and heel. No significant differences were found between the thresholds for sinusoids representing notes between C1 and C6 when presented to the fingertip of participants with normal hearing and with a severe or profound hearing loss. For participants with normal hearing, thresholds for notes between C1 and C6 showed the characteristic U-shape curve for the fingertip, but not for the forefoot and heel. Compared to the fingertip, the forefoot had lower thresholds between C1 and C3, and the heel had lower thresholds between C1 and G2; this is attributed to spatial summation from the Pacinian receptors over the larger contactor area used for the forefoot and heel. Participants with normal hearing assessed the perception of high-frequency vibration using 1s sinusoids presented to the fingertip and were found to be more aware of transient vibration at the beginning and/or end of notes between G4 and C6 when stimuli were presented 10dB above threshold, rather than at threshold. An average of 94% of these participants reported feeling continuous vibration between G4 and G5 with stimuli presented 10dB above threshold. Based on the experimental findings and consideration of health effects relating to vibration exposure, a suitable range of notes for vibrotactile presentation of music is identified as being from C1 to G5. This is more limited than for human hearing but the fundamental frequencies of the human voice, and the notes played by many instruments, lie within it. However, the dynamic range might require compression to avoid the negative effects of amplitude on pitch perception."
https://openalex.org/W2402074876,"Hippocampal long-term depression (LTD) is an active form of synaptic plasticity that is necessary for consolidation of spatial memory, contextual fear memory, and novelty acquisition. Recent studies have shown that caspases (CASPs) play an important role in NMDA receptor-dependent LTD and are involved in postsynaptic remodeling and synaptic maturation. In the present study, we examined the role of X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis (XIAP), a putative endogenous CASP inhibitor, in synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus. Analysis in acute brain slices and in cultured hippocampal neurons revealed that XIAP deletion increases CASP-3 activity, enhances α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptor internalization, sharply increases LTD, and significantly reduces synapse density. In vivo behaviors related to memory were also altered in XIAP(-/-) mice, with faster acquisition of spatial object location and increased fear memory observed. Together, these results indicate that XIAP plays an important physiologic role in regulating sublethal CASP-3 activity within central neurons and thereby facilitates synaptic plasticity and memory acquisition.-Gibon, J., Unsain, N., Gamache, K., Thomas, R.

https://openalex.org/W2395853642,"In this study, we sought to investigate the oral microbiota structure of children with cleft lip and palate (CLP) and explore the pre-operative oral bacterial composition related to the prognosis of alveolar bone grafting. In total, 28 patients (19 boys, 9 girls) with CLP who were scheduled to undergo alveolar bone grafting for the first time were recruited. According to the clinical examination of operative sites at the third month after the operation, the individuals were divided into a non-inflammation group (n = 15) and an inflammation group (n = 13). In all, 56 unstimulated saliva samples were collected before and after the operation. The v3-v4 hypervariable regions of the 16S rRNA gene were sequenced using an Illumina MiSeq sequencing platform. Based on the beta diversity of the operational taxonomic units (OTUs) in the inflammation and non-inflammation samples, the microbial variation in the oral cavity differed significantly between the two groups before and after the operation (P < 0.05). Analysis of the relative abundances of pre-operative OTUs revealed 26 OTUs with a relative abundance higher than 0.01%, reflecting a significant difference of the relative abundance between groups (P < 0.05). According to a principal component analysis of the pre-operative samples, the inflammation-related OTUs included Tannerella sp., Porphyromonas sp., Gemella sp., Moraxella sp., Prevotella nigrescens, and Prevotella intermedia, most of which were enriched in the inflammation group and showed a significant positive correlation. A cross-validated random forest model based on the 26 different OTUs before the operation was able to fit the post-operative status of grafted sites and yielded a good classification result. The sensitivity and specificity of this classified model were 76.9% and 86.7%, respectively. These findings show that the oral microbiota profile before alveolar bone grafting may be related to the risk of post-operative inflammation at grafted sites."
https://openalex.org/W2345797746,"Mechanotransduction in Caenorhabditis elegans touch receptor neurons is mediated by an ion channel formed by MEC-4, MEC-10, and accessory proteins. To define the role of these subunits in the channel's response to mechanical force, we expressed degenerin channels comprising MEC-4 and MEC-10 in Xenopus oocytes and examined their response to laminar shear stress (LSS). Shear stress evoked a rapid increase in whole cell currents in oocytes expressing degenerin channels as well as channels with a MEC-4 degenerin mutation (MEC-4d), suggesting that C. elegans degenerin channels are sensitive to LSS. MEC-10 is required for a robust LSS response as the response was largely blunted in oocytes expressing homomeric MEC-4 or MEC-4d channels. We examined a series of MEC-10/MEC-4 chimeras to identify specific domains (amino terminus, first transmembrane domain, and extracellular domain) and sites (residues 130–132 and 134–137) within MEC-10 that are required for a robust response to shear stress. In addition, the LSS response was largely abolished by MEC-10 mutations encoded by a touch-insensitive mec-10 allele, providing a correlation between the channel's responses to two different mechanical forces. Our findings suggest that MEC-10 has an important role in the channel's response to mechanical forces."
https://openalex.org/W2407180974,"Antimicrobial treatments result in the host's enteric bacteria being exposed to the antimicrobials. Pharmacodynamic models can describe how this exposure affects the enteric bacteria and their antimicrobial resistance. The models utilize measurements of bacterial antimicrobial susceptibility traditionally obtained in vitro in aerobic conditions. However, in vivo enteric bacteria are exposed to antimicrobials in anaerobic conditions of the lower intestine. Some of enteric bacteria of food animals are potential foodborne pathogens, e.g., Gram-negative bacilli Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica. These are facultative anaerobes; their physiology and growth rates change in anaerobic conditions. We hypothesized that their antimicrobial susceptibility also changes, and evaluated differences in the susceptibility in aerobic vs. anaerobic conditions of generic E. coli and Salmonella enterica of diverse serovars isolated from cattle feces. Susceptibility of an isolate was evaluated as its minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) measured by E-Test® following 24 hours of adaptation to the conditions on Mueller-Hinton agar, and on a more complex tryptic soy agar with 5% sheep blood (BAP) media. We considered all major antimicrobial drug classes used in the U.S. to treat cattle: β-lactams (specifically, ampicillin and ceftriaxone E-Test®), aminoglycosides (gentamicin and kanamycin), fluoroquinolones (enrofloxacin), classical macrolides (erythromycin), azalides (azithromycin), sulfanomides (sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim), and tetracyclines (tetracycline). Statistical analyses were conducted for the isolates (n≥30) interpreted as susceptible to the antimicrobials based on the clinical breakpoint interpretation for human infection. Bacterial susceptibility to every antimicrobial tested was statistically significantly different in anaerobic vs. aerobic conditions on both media, except for no difference in susceptibility to ceftriaxone on BAP agar. A satellite experiment suggested that during first days in anaerobic conditions the susceptibility changes with time. The results demonstrate that assessing effects of antimicrobial treatments on resistance in the host's enteric bacteria that are Gram negative facultative Anaerobe Bacilli requires data on the bacterial antimicrobial susceptibility in the conditions resembling those in the intestine."

Despite the presence of complex N-glycans in this organism, no homologues of the canonical N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase I or II genes can be found in the T. brucei genome. These genes encode the activities that initiate the elaboration of the Manα1–3 and Manα1–6 arms, respectively, of the conserved trimannosyl-N-acetylchitobiosyl core of N-linked glycans. Previously, we identified a highly divergent T. brucei N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase I (TbGnTI) among a set of putative T. brucei glycosyltransferase genes belonging to the β3-glycosyltransferase superfamily (Damerow, M., Rodrigues, J. A., Wu, D., Güther, M. L., Mehlert, A., and Ferguson, M. A. (2014) J. Biol. Chem. 289, 9328–9339). Here, we demonstrate that TbGT15, another member of the same β3-glycosyltransferase family, encodes an equally divergent N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase II (TbGnTII) activity. In contrast to multicellular organisms, where GnTII activity is essential, TbGnTII null mutants of T. brucei grow in culture and are still infectious to animals. Characterization of the large poly-N-acetyllactosamine containing N-glycans of the TbGnTII null mutants by methylation linkage analysis suggests that, in wild-type parasites, the Manα1–6 arm of the conserved trimannosyl core may carry predominantly linear poly-N-acetyllactosamine chains, whereas the Manα1–3 arm may carry predominantly branched poly-N-acetyllactosamine chains. These results provide further detail on the structure and biosynthesis of complex N-glycans in an important human pathogen and provide a second example of the adaptation by trypanosomes of β3-glycosyltransferase family members to catalyze β1–2 glycosidic linkages. The bloodstream form of the human pathogen Trypanosoma brucei expresses oligomannose, paucimannose, and complex N-linked glycans, including some exceptionally large poly-N-acetyllactosamine-containing structures.

Previously, we identified a highly divergent T. brucei N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase I (TbGnTI) among a set of putative T. brucei glycosyltransferase genes belonging to the β3-glycosyltransferase superfamily (Damerow, M., Rodrigues, J. A., Wu, D., Güther, M. L., Mehlert, A., and Ferguson, M. A. (2014) J. Biol. Chem. 289, 9328–9339). Here, we demonstrate that TbGT15, another member of the same β3-glycosyltransferase family, encodes an equally divergent N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase II (TbGnTII) activity. In contrast to multicellular organisms, where GnTII activity is essential, TbGnTII null mutants of T. brucei grow in culture and are still infectious to animals. Characterization of the large poly-N-acetyllactosamine containing N-glycans of the TbGnTII null mutants by methylation linkage analysis suggests that, in wild-type parasites, the Manα1–6 arm of the conserved trimannosyl core may carry predominantly linear poly-N-acetyllactosamine chains, whereas the Manα1–3 arm may carry predominantly branched poly-N-acetyllactosamine chains. These results provide further detail on the structure and biosynthesis of complex N-glycans in an important human pathogen and provide a second example of the adaptation by trypanosomes of β3-glycosyltransferase family members to catalyze β1–2 glycosidic linkages."
https://openalex.org/W2405744007,"Background Yin Yang 2 (YY2) is a zinc finger protein closely related to the well-characterized Yin Yang 1 (YY1). YY1 is a DNA-binding transcription factor, with defined functions in multiple developmental processes, such as implantation, cell differentiation, X inactivation, imprinting and organogenesis. Yy2 has been treated as a largely immaterial duplication of Yy1, as they share high homology in the Zinc Finger-region and similar if not identical in vitro binding sites. In contrast to these similarities, gene expression alterations in HeLa cells with attenuated levels of either Yy1 or Yy2 were to some extent gene-specific. Moreover, the chromatin binding sites for YY2, except for its association with transposable retroviral elements (RE) and Endogenous Retroviral Elements (ERVs), remain to be identified. As a first step towards defining potential Yy2 functions matching or complementary to Yy1, we considered in vivo DNA binding sites of YY2 in trophoblast stem (TS) cells. Results We report the presence of YY2 protein in mouse-derived embryonic stem (ES) and TS cell lines. Following up on our previous report on ERV binding by YY2 in TS cells, we investigated the tissue-specificity of REX1 and YY2 binding and confirm binding to RE/ERV targets in both ES cells and TS cells. Because of the higher levels of expression, we chose TS cells to understand the role of Yy2 in gene and chromatin regulation. We used in vivo YY2 association as a measure to identify potential target genes. Sequencing of chromatin obtained in chromatin-immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays carried out with αYY2 serum allowed us to identify a limited number of chromatin targets for YY2. Some putative binding sites were validated in regular ChIP assays and gene expression of genes nearby was altered in the absence of Yy2. Conclusions YY2 binding to ERVs is not confined to TS cells. In vivo binding sites share the presence of a consensus binding motif. Selected sites were uniquely bound by YY2 as opposed to YY1, suggesting that YY2 exerts unique contributions to gene regulation. YY2 binding was not generally associated with gene promoters. However, several YY2 binding sites are linked to long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) genes and we show that the expression levels of a few of those are Yy2-dependent."
https://openalex.org/W2406170272,"Previous studies have demonstrated that pharmaceutical equivalence and pharmacokinetic equivalence of generic antibiotics are necessary but not sufficient conditions to guarantee therapeutic equivalence (better called pharmacodynamic equivalence). In addition, there is scientific evidence suggesting a direct link between pharmacodynamic nonequivalence of generic vancomycin and promotion of resistance in Staphylococcus aureus. To find out if even subtle deviations from the expected pharmacodynamic behavior with respect to the innovator could favor resistance, we studied a generic product of piperacillin-tazobactam characterized by pharmaceutical and pharmacokinetic equivalence but a faulty fit of Hill's Emax sigmoid model that could be interpreted as pharmacodynamic nonequivalence. We determined the impact in vivo of this generic product on the resistance of a mixed Escherichia coli population composed of ∼99% susceptible cells (ATCC 35218 strain) and a ∼1% isogenic resistant subpopulation that overproduces TEM-1 β-lactamase. After only 24 hours of treatment in the neutropenic murine thigh infection model, the generic amplified the resistant subpopulation up to 20-times compared with the innovator, following an inverted-U dose-response relationship. These findings highlight the critical role of therapeutic nonequivalence of generic antibiotics as a key factor contributing to the global problem of bacterial resistance."

MTC28 is a 28-kDa proline-rich secretary antigen of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and is only conserved in pathogenic strains of mycobacteria. Here we report the crystal structure of MTC28 at 2.8- and 2.15-A resolutions for the structure-based epitope design. MTC28 shares a mog1p-fold consisting of seven antiparallel β strands stacked between α helices. Five probable epitopes have been located on a solvent-accessible flexible region by computational analysis of the structure of MTC28. Simultaneously, the protein is digested with trypsin and the resulting fragments are purified by HPLC. Such 10 purified peptide fragments are screened against sera from patients infected with pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB). Two of these 10 fragments, namely (127)ALDITLPMPPR(137) and (138)WTQVPDPNVPDAFVVIADR(156),are found to be major immunogenic epitopes that are localized on the outer surface of the protein molecule and are part of a single continuous epitope that have been predicted in silico Mutagenesis and antibody inhibition studies are in accordance with the results obtained from epitope mapping."

The VP3 protein of WPV is a major structural protein that induces neutralizing antibodies in the waterfowl. However, B-cell epitopes on the VP3 protein of WPV have not been characterized.To understand the antigenic determinants of the VP3 protein, we used the monoclonal antibody (mAb) 4A6 to screen a set of eight partially expressed overlapping peptides spanning VP3. Using western blotting and an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), we localized the VP3 epitope between amino acids (aa) 57 and 112. To identify the essential epitope residues, a phage library displaying 12-mer random peptides was screened with mAb 4A6. Phage clone peptides displayed a consensus sequence of YxRFHxH that mimicked the sequence 82Y/FNRFHCH88, which corresponded to amino acid residues 82 to 88 of VP3 protein of WPVs. mAb 4A6 binding to biotinylated fragments corresponding to amino acid residues 82 to 88 of the VP3 protein verified that the 82FxRFHxH88 was the VP3 epitope and that amino acids 82F is necessary to retain maximal binding to mAb 4A6. Parvovirus-positive goose and duck sera reacted with the epitope peptide by dot blotting assay, revealing the importance of these amino acids of the epitope in antibody-epitope binding reactivity.We identified the motif FxRFHxH as a VP3-specific B-cell epitope that is recognized by the neutralizing mAb 4A6. This finding might be valuable in understanding of the antigenic topology of VP3 of WPV."

https://openalex.org/W2407657471,"Databases of organismal traits that aggregate information from one or multiple sources can be leveraged for large-scale analyses in biology. Yet the differences among these data streams and how well they capture trait diversity have never been explored. We present the first analysis of the differences between phenotypes captured in free text of descriptive publications ('monographs') and those used in phylogenetic analyses ('matrices'). We focus our analysis on osteological phenotypes of the limbs of four extinct vertebrate taxa critical to our understanding of the fin-to-limb transition. We find that there is low overlap between the anatomical entities used in these two sources of phenotype data, indicating that phenotypes represented in matrices are not simply a subset of those found in monographic descriptions. Perhaps as expected, compared to characters found in matrices, phenotypes in monographs tend to emphasize descriptive and positional morphology, be somewhat more complex, and relate to fewer additional taxa. While based on a small set of focal taxa, these qualitative and quantitative data suggest that either source of phenotypes alone will result in incomplete knowledge of variation for a given taxon. As a broader community develops to use and expand databases characterizing organismal trait diversity, it is important to recognize the limitations of the data sources and develop strategies to more fully characterize variation both within species and across the tree of life."

Nucleoside triphosphate phosphohydrolase I (NPH I) is an essential component of the early gene transcription complex. NPH I hydrolyzes ATP to release transcripts during transcription termination. The ATPase activity of NPH I requires single-stranded (ss) DNA as a cofactor; however, the source of this cofactor within the transcription complex is not known. Based on available structures of transcription complexes it has been hypothesized that the ssDNA cofactor is obtained from the unpaired non-template strand within the transcription bubble.

Complementarity between the template and non-template strands in this region is also required for NPH I-mediated transcript release. This observation complicates locating the source of the ssDNA cofactor within the transcription complex because removal of the non-template strand also disrupts transcription bubble reannealing.

Vaccinia virus is a member of the poxvirus family, which are large double-stranded DNA viruses that conduct their entire infective cycle within the cytoplasm of the infected cell.

In this study, we investigated the role of the non-template strand in transcript release. We found that release, both NPH I-dependent and -independent, requires the presence of the non-template strand in the upstream portion of the transcription bubble. Moreover, complementarity between the two strands in this region of the bubble is also required for transcript release. By using chimeric transcription templates containing segments of ribonucleotides in the non-template strand, we show that the ssDNA cofactor for NPH I is obtained from the upstream region of the non-template strand. We also show that isolated NPH I acts as a 5′ to 3′ translocase on single-stranded DNA. All templates for in vitro transcription used in these studies were based on the dsDNA Ter29 template, which was designed by Dr. Stewart Shuman and co-worker (18Deng L. Shuman S.

Ter29 contains a strong early promoter joined to a 20-base G-less cassette followed by 4 G residues from positions +21 to +24. The G-less cassette is followed by a 57-base A-less cassette. Within the A-less cassette, a series of 9 T residues in the non-template strand serve as the termination signal when transcribed into 9 Us in the nascent RNA. The A-less cassette is followed by 4 A residues from positions +78 to +81 and then an additional 108 bp of DNA. Ter29 transcription templates were prepared by PCR as described previously and bound to streptavidin-coated magnetic beads (Promega) via a biotin on the 5′ end of the template strand (8Luo Y. Mao X.

The DS oligos for the NT strand contained variations for each transcription template. For the deletion series of transcription templates, the DS oligos comprised +31 to either +90 or to various truncated 3′ ends (Fig. 1B, NT90 to NT57). In some cases, the DS oligos for the NT strand contained altered sequences to generate mismatches with the template strand (Fig. 1B, NC66–68 to NC73–75). In other cases, the DS oligos contained segments of ribonucleotides (Fig. 1B). The 5′ end of the US oligo for the NT strand was biotinylated to allow binding of the completed dsDNA transcription templates to streptavidin-coated paramagnetic beads. For oligo-based transcription templates that lacked non-template DNA or contained mismatches, the sequence of the completed template strand was identical to Ter29 (18Deng L. Shuman S. An ATPase component of the transcription elongation complex is required for factor-dependent transcription termination by vaccinia RNA polymerase.J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29386-29392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) except that the termination signal was moved downstream to +46, and the sequence following the end of the A-less cassette was shortened. For each pair of oligos that were ligated to generate a T or NT strand, the 5′ end of one oligo was phosphorylated using T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs), 20 μm ATP, and 1μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) as indicated in Fig. 1. Radiolabeling facilitated visualizing the ligated products in polyacrylamide gels during the construction process as well as quantification of each strand. Each pair of US or DS oligos were annealed to a 30-mer bridging oligo complementary to 15 nucleotides at the 3′ end of the US oligo and 15 nucleotides at the 5′ end of the DS oligo (i.e. the bridging oligo is complementary to +15 to +45). One nanomole of each oligo (US, DS, and bridge) was mixed in 60 μl of H2O, heated to 95 °C for 15 min, and then slowly cooled over 60 min to room temperature (≈25 °C). T4 DNA ligase (New England Biolabs) was then added to the annealed oligos in T4 DNA ligase buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm ATP) and incubated for 3 h at 20 °C. The products of the ligation reactions were separated on 8% (19:1 bis) polyacrylamide gels containing 8 m urea in 1× Tris borate-EDTA. The gels were exposed to a phosphor storage screen (GE Healthcare) developed with a Storm phosphorimaging system using ImageQuant software (GE Healthcare). Bands corresponding to full-length T and NT strands were excised from the gels, and the DNA was extracted by a crush and soak procedure (24Milligan J.F. Uhlenbeck O.C. Determination of RNA-protein contacts using thiophosphate substitutions.Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 2849-2855Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The purified NT and T strands were resuspended in diethylpyrocarbonate-treated H2O and quantified by liquid scintillation (Beckman). 30 picomoles of each strand were mixed and annealed by heating and slow cooling as described above. The double-stranded oligo-based transcription templates were then bound to streptavidin-coated paramagnetic particles as directed by the manufacturer. Transcription templates that contained mismatches between the T and NT strands were based on the sequence of NT90. Mismatches were generated by changing C to G, G to C, T to A, or A to T in the NT strand within the regions indicated (Fig. 1B). Templates with ribonucleotides in the non-template strand were based on the NT112 dsDNA template, which is identical to Ter29 except that it spans from −30 to +112. Ribonucleotides containing T and NT strands were assembled from two oligonucleotides spanning −30 to +58 and +59 to +112 (Midland Certified Reagent Co.). The US NT oligonucleotide was biotinylated on the 5′ end. The DS NT oligonucleotide contained ribonucleotides corresponding to the positions in the name of each transcription template (Fig. 1). The bridging oligonucleotides for ligating both pairs of US and DS oligonucleotides for the T and NT strands spanned from +44 to +74. Contaminating ATP was removed from dATP stocks by periodate treatment as described previously (25Mitra S.K. Mehler A.H. Reaction of amino acid-tRNA synthetases with 2′-deoxyadenosine triphosphate.Eur. J. Biochem. 1969; 9: 79-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). 5 micromoles of dATP (12.5 mm) were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min in 40 mm potassium acetate (pH 5.5) with 50 mm NaIO in a total volume of 400 μl. Following incubation, 200 μmol of glucose (500 mm) were added to inactivate the excess periodate. Vaccinia virions were purified from infected HeLa cells using sucrose density gradients (11Tate J. Gollnick P. Role of forward translocation in nucleoside triphosphate phosphohydrolase I (NPH I)-mediated transcription termination of vaccinia virus early genes.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 44764-44775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Viral cores were prepared from 5–10 mg of virions by incubation in 50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8.5), 10 mm DTT, and 0.05% Nonidet P-40 at 37 °C for 10 min. Viral cores were collected by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, and transcription extracts were then prepared as described previously (11Tate J. Gollnick P.

N-MR assays were conducted in two steps. In the first step, 1 μl of virion extract was incubated with 100 fmol of bead-bound dsDNA template (5 nm), 1 mm ATP, 1 mm CTP, 0.25 mm 3′-O-methyl-GTP, and 5 μCi of [α32P]UTP for 15 min at 30 °C in 20 μl of transcription buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 6 mm MgCl2, 2 mm DTT, and 8% glycerol). This step produces stable TECs paused at G21. Bead-bound TECs were pulled down using a magnet and washed three times in 100 μl of transcription buffer to remove capping enzyme and unincorporated nucleotides. In the second step of the assay, transcription was resumed in 20 μl of transcription buffer containing 1 mm CTP, 1 mm UTP, and 1 mm GTP, which yields transcription complexes stalled at C77 at the end of the A-less cassette. Where indicated, 1 mm periodate-treated dATP was added to stimulate NPH I function while preventing transcription elongation past the end of the A-less cassette. The 77-nucleotide transcripts that were released from the TEC were separated from those remaining bound to the TEC by pulling down the DNA template using a magnet. 20 μl of 95% formamide were added to each sample, which were then boiled for 5 min and electrophoresed through 12% (19:1) polyacrylamide gels containing 8 m urea and 1× Tris borate-EDTA. Gels were exposed to phosphor storage screens and scanned using a Storm phosphorimaging system. The radiolabeled RNA products were quantified using ImageQuant software. Percent release was calculated by dividing the quantity of RNA released into the supernatant by the sum of RNA retained in the ternary complex and released RNA. O-MR assays were conducted similarly to NPH I-mediated transcript release assays except that dATP was excluded from the second step of transcription and 2 pmol (10 μm) of an oligonucleotide complementary to the nascent RNA from +51 to +77 were added where indicated. Transcription termination assays were conducted in two steps as described previously (11Tate J. Gollnick P. Role of forward translocation in nucleoside triphosphate phosphohydrolase I (NPH I)-mediated transcription termination of vaccinia virus early genes.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 44764-44775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar, 18Deng L. Shuman S.

Chem. 1996; 271: 29386-29392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Briefly, the first step transcription was initiated in the same way as for the transcript release assays described above to produce TECs paused at G21. Bead-bound TECs were washed with transcription buffer as described for transcript release assays above. The second step of the termination assays contained all four NTPs and 10 μm CE (VTF). The second step of transcription produces transcripts that either read through to the end of the template or terminate at approximately +75. Samples were boiled with an equal volume 95% formamide and electrophoresed through 12% (19:1) polyacrylamide gels containing 8 m urea and 1× Tris borate-EDTA. Gels were exposed to phosphor storage screens and scanned using a Storm phosphorimaging system. The radiolabeled RNA products were quantified using ImageQuant software. Percent termination was calculated by dividing the quantity of the terminated transcripts by the sum of the terminated and readthrough RNA. The ability of NPH I to disrupt the streptavidin-biotin interaction was tested on ssDNAs that were biotinylated at either the 5′ or 3′ end.

https://openalex.org/W2402842806,"The Mandarin Tone Identification Test (MTIT) is a new test designed to assess the tone identification abilities of children with hearing impairment (HI). Evidence for reliability and sensitivity has been reported. The present study aimed to evaluate the known-groups and concurrent validity of the MTIT.The MTIT and Mandarin Pediatric Speech Intelligibility test (MPSI) were administered in quiet and in noise conditions. The known-groups validity was evaluated by comparing the performance of the MTIT on children with two different levels of HI. The MPSI was included to evaluate the concurrent validity of the MTIT.81 children with HI were recruited in the present study. They were Mandarin-speaking children with profound HI (mean age = 9; 0, n = 41) and with moderate to severe HI (mean age = 8; 9, n = 40).Scores on the MTIT differed between the two groups with different hearing levels suggesting good known-groups validity. A strong relationship between tone and sentence perception both in quiet and in noise provided preliminary evidence for concurrent validity.The present study confirmed that the MTIT has good known-groups validity and provided preliminary evidence for concurrent validity. The MTIT could be used to evaluate tone identification ability in children with HI with confidence."
