https://openalex.org/W2063218600,"Some previous studies have identified bacteria in semen as being a potential factor in male infertility. However, only few types of bacteria were taken into consideration while using PCR-based or culturing methods. Here we present an analysis approach using next-generation sequencing technology and bioinformatics analysis to investigate the associations between bacterial communities and semen quality. Ninety-six semen samples collected were examined for bacterial communities, measuring seven clinical criteria for semen quality (semen volume, sperm concentration, motility, Kruger's strict morphology, antisperm antibody (IgA), Atypical, and leukocytes). Computer-assisted semen analysis (CASA) was also performed. Results showed that the most abundant genera among all samples were Lactobacillus (19.9%), Pseudomonas (9.85%), Prevotella (8.51%) and Gardnerella (4.21%). The proportion of Lactobacillus and Gardnerella was significantly higher in the normal samples, while that of Prevotella was significantly higher in the low quality samples. Unsupervised clustering analysis demonstrated that the seminal bacterial communities were clustered into three main groups: Lactobacillus, Pseudomonas, and Prevotella predominant group. Remarkably, most normal samples (80.6%) were clustered in Lactobacillus predominant group. The analysis results showed seminal bacteria community types were highly associated with semen health. Lactobacillus might not only be a potential probiotic for semen quality maintenance, but also might be helpful in countering the negative influence of Prevotella and Pseudomonas. In this study, we investigated whole seminal bacterial communities and provided the most comprehensive analysis of the association between bacterial community and semen quality. The study significantly contributes to the current understanding of the etiology of male fertility."
https://openalex.org/W2004410209,"Abnormal phosphorylation (hyperphosphorylation) and aggregation of Tau protein are hallmarks of Alzheimer disease and other tauopathies, but their causative connection is still a matter of debate. Tau with Alzheimer-like phosphorylation is also present in hibernating animals, mitosis, or during embryonic development, without leading to pathophysiology or neurodegeneration. Thus, the role of phosphorylation and the distinction between physiological and pathological phosphorylation needs to be further refined. So far, the systematic investigation of highly phosphorylated Tau was difficult because a reliable method of preparing reproducible quantities was not available. Here, we generated full-length Tau (2N4R) in Sf9 cells in a well defined phosphorylation state containing up to ∼20 phosphates as judged by mass spectrometry and Western blotting with phospho-specific antibodies. Despite the high concentration in living Sf9 cells (estimated ∼230 μm) and high phosphorylation, the protein was not aggregated. However, after purification, the highly phosphorylated protein readily formed oligomers, whereas fibrils were observed only rarely. Exposure of mature primary neuronal cultures to oligomeric phospho-Tau caused reduction of spine density on dendrites but did not change the overall cell viability."
https://openalex.org/W1978720331,"The DNA damage response (DDR) is activated upon DNA damage generation to promote DNA repair and inhibit cell cycle progression in the presence of a lesion. Cellular senescence is a permanent cell cycle arrest characterized by persistent DDR activation. However, some reports suggest that DDR activation is a feature only of early cellular senescence that is then lost with time. This challenges the hypothesis that cellular senescence is caused by persistent DDR activation. To address this issue, we studied DDR activation dynamics in senescent cells. Here we show that normal human fibroblasts retain DDR markers months after replicative senescence establishment. Consistently, human fibroblasts from healthy aged donors display markers of DDR activation even three years in culture after entry into replicative cellular senescence. However, by extending our analyses to different human cell strains, we also observed an apparent DDR loss with time following entry into cellular senescence. This though correlates with the inability of these cell strains to survive in culture upon replicative or irradiation-induced cellular senescence. We propose a model to reconcile these results. Cell strains not suffering the prolonged in vitro culture stress retain robust DDR activation that persists for years, indicating that under physiological conditions persistent DDR is causally involved in senescence establishment and maintenance. However, cell strains unable to maintain cell viability in vitro, due to their inability to cope with prolonged cell culture-associated stress, show an only-apparent reduction in DDR foci which is in fact due to selective loss of the most damaged cells."
https://openalex.org/W1989637222,"Over the last two decades, the congruency sequence effect (CSE) –the finding of a reduced congruency effect following incongruent trials in conflict tasks– has played a central role in advancing research on cognitive control. According to the influential conflict-monitoring account, the CSE reflects adjustments in selective attention that enhance task focus when needed, often termed conflict adaptation. However, this dominant interpretation of the CSE has been called into question by several alternative accounts that stress the role of episodic memory processes: feature binding and (stimulus-response) contingency learning. To evaluate the notion of conflict adaptation in accounting for the CSE, we construed versions of three widely used experimental paradigms (the colour-word Stroop, picture-word Stroop and flanker task) that effectively control for feature binding and contingency learning. Results revealed that a CSE can emerge in all three tasks. This strongly suggests a contribution of attentional control to the CSE and highlights the potential of these unprecedentedly clean paradigms for further examining cognitive control."
https://openalex.org/W2130808309,"Background Interventions are needed to reduce poor perinatal health. We trained community health workers (CHWs) as home visitors to address maternal/infant risks. Methods In a cluster randomised controlled trial in Cape Town townships, neighbourhoods were randomised within matched pairs to 1) the control, healthcare at clinics (n = 12 neighbourhoods; n = 594 women), or 2) a home visiting intervention by CBW trained in cognitive-behavioural strategies to address health risks (by the Philani Maternal, Child Health and Nutrition Programme), in addition to clinic care (n = 12 neighbourhoods; n = 644 women). Participants were assessed during pregnancy (2% refusal) and 92% were reassessed at two weeks post-birth, 88% at six months and 84% at 18 months later. We analysed 32 measures of maternal/infant well-being over the 18 month follow-up period using longitudinal random effects regressions. A binomial test for correlated outcomes evaluated overall effectiveness over time. The 18 month post-birth assessment outcomes also were examined alone and as a function of the number of home visits received. Results Benefits were found on 7 of 32 measures of outcomes, resulting in significant overall benefits for the intervention compared to the control when using the binomial test (p = 0.008); nevertheless, no effects were observed when only the 18 month outcomes were analyzed. Benefits on individual outcomes were related to the number of home visits received. Among women living with HIV, intervention mothers were more likely to implement the PMTCT regimens, use condoms during all sexual episodes (OR = 1.25; p = 0.014), have infants with healthy weight-for-age measurements (OR = 1.42; p = 0.045), height-for-age measurements (OR = 1.13, p<0.001), breastfeed exclusively for six months (OR = 3.59; p<0.001), and breastfeed longer (OR = 3.08; p<0.001). Number of visits was positively associated with infant birth weight ≥2500 grams (OR = 1.07; p = 0.012), healthy head-circumference-for-age measurements at 6 months (OR = 1.09, p = 0.017), and improved cognitive development at 18 months (OR = 1.02, p = 0.048). Conclusions Home visits to neighbourhood mothers by CHWs may be a feasible strategy for enhancing maternal/child outcomes. However, visits likely must extend over several years for persistent benefits. Trial Registration ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00996528"
https://openalex.org/W2166839243,"Carcharocles megalodon (“Megalodon”) is the largest shark that ever lived. Based on its distribution, dental morphology, and associated fauna, it has been suggested that this species was a cosmopolitan apex predator that fed on marine mammals from the middle Miocene to the Pliocene (15.9–2.6 Ma). Prevailing theory suggests that the extinction of apex predators affects ecosystem dynamics. Accordingly, knowing the time of extinction of C. megalodon is a fundamental step towards understanding the effects of such an event in ancient communities. However, the time of extinction of this important species has never been quantitatively assessed. Here, we synthesize the most recent records of C. megalodon from the literature and scientific collections and infer the date of its extinction by making a novel use of the Optimal Linear Estimation (OLE) model. Our results suggest that C. megalodon went extinct around 2.6 Ma. Furthermore, when contrasting our results with known ecological and macroevolutionary trends in marine mammals, it became evident that the modern composition and function of modern gigantic filter-feeding whales was established after the extinction of C. megalodon. Consequently, the study of the time of extinction of C. megalodon provides the basis to improve our understanding of the responses of marine species to the removal of apex predators, presenting a deep-time perspective for the conservation of modern ecosystems."
https://openalex.org/W2159368313,"There has been a drastic increase in the rate of suicides over the past 45 years in Malaysia. The statistics show that adolescents aged between 16 and 19 years old are at high risk of committing suicide. This could be attributed to issues relating to the developmental stage of adolescents. During this stage, adolescents face challenges and are exposed to various stressful experiences and risk factors relating to suicide.The present study examined psychological factors (i.e., depression, anxiety and stress) as predictors for suicidal ideation among adolescents. A cross-sectional study was conducted on 190 students (103 males and 87 females), aged 15 to 19 years old from two different schools in Kuala Lumpur. The Depression Anxiety Stress Scale 21-item version (DASS-21) was used to measure depression, anxiety and stress among the students, and the Beck Scale for Suicide Ideation (BSS) to measure suicidal ideation. The data were analysed using Pearson's correlation and multiple regression analysis.The results show that 11.10%, 10.00%, and 9.50% of the students reported that they were experiencing severe depression, anxiety and stress, respectively. There were significant correlations between depression, anxiety, and stress with suicidal ideation. However, only depression was identified as a predictor for suicidal ideation.Hence, this study extends the role of depression in predicting suicidal ideation among adolescents in the Malaysian context. The findings imply that teenagers should be assisted in strengthening their positive coping strategies in managing distress to reduce depression and suicidal ideation."
https://openalex.org/W1996888635,"The functional role of histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3) in the developing brain has yet to be elucidated. We show that mice lacking HDAC3 in neurons and glia of the central nervous system, Nes-Cre/HDAC3 conditional KO mice, show major abnormalities in the cytoarchitecture of the neocortex and cerebellum and die within 24 h of birth. Later-born neurons do not localize properly in the cortex. A similar mislocalization is observed with cerebellar Purkinje neurons. Although the proportion of astrocytes is higher than normal, the numbers of oligodendrocytes are reduced. In contrast, conditional knockout of HDAC3 in neurons of the forebrain and certain other brain regions, using Thy1-Cre and calcium/calmodulin dependent protein kinase II α-Cre for ablation, produces no overt abnormalities in the organization of cells within the cortex or of cerebellar Purkinje neurons at birth. However, both lines of conditional knockout mice suffer from progressive hind limb paralysis and ataxia and die around 6 weeks after birth. The mice display an increase in overall numbers of cells, higher numbers of astrocytes, and Purkinje neuron degeneration.

Histone deacetylases (HDACs) 3The abbreviations used are: HDAChistone deacetylasecKOconditional knockoutNes-CreNestin-CreCaMKII-Crecalcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II α-CreGFAPglial fibrillary acidic proteinP0postnatal day 0TSStranscription start site. are proteins originally identified on the basis of their ability to deacetylate histones, resulting in the compacting of chromatin into a transcriptionally repressed state. HDACs also deacetylate a large number of other non-histone proteins in the nucleus, cytoplasm, and mitochondria, thereby regulating diverse cellular events. Vertebrates express 18 HDACs organized into four classes: class I (HDAC1, HDAC2, HDAC3, and HDAC8), class II (HDAC4, HDAC5, HDAC6, HDAC7, HDAC9, histone deacetylase-related protein (HDRP), and HDAC10), class III (SIRT1–7), and class IV (HDAC11). Class I, II, and IV HDACs are zinc-dependent enzymes collectively referred to as classical HDACs, whereas class III HDACs, commonly referred to as sirtuins, require NAD+ for their activity (1Yang X.J.

Most HDACs are expressed efficiently in developing and adult brains, suggesting important roles in brain development and function (3Broide R.S. Redwine J.M. Aftahi N. Young W. Bloom F.E. Winrow C.J.

Surprisingly, knockout of several individual HDACs in mice, including HDACs 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, and 11, does not produce a neurological phenotype (4Morris M.J. Monteggia L.M.

Although deletion of either HDAC1 or HDAC2 in neuronal precursors produces mice that are normal, double conditional KO mice (cKO) lacking both these HDACs show reduced brain size, cellular disorganization in the cortex, and a deformed cerebellum and die within a week of birth (5Montgomery R.L.

The severity of these neurological abnormalities can be sharply reduced with just one functional allele of HDAC1 or HDAC2 (5Montgomery R.L. Hsieh J. Barbosa A.C. Richardson J.A. Olson E.N.

As observed with conditional neuronal knockouts, mice lacking either HDAC1 or HDAC2 in oligodendrocytes or Schwann cells are normal, although double cKO mice lacking both HDACs display reduced myelination, severe tremor, and hind limb paralysis and die within 2–3 weeks (6Chen Y.

However, HDAC3 is highly expressed in the developing and adult brain, where its function is not clear. To investigate this issue, we generated and analyzed the brains of HDAC3 cKO mice in which the gene was ablated either in the whole CNS or in neurons of select brain regions. We report neurodevelopmental abnormalities and perinatal death of mice in which HDAC3 is deleted in neural progenitor cells of the CNS. Serious neurological deficits and premature death are also observed in mice in which the HDAC3 gene is knocked out in neurons of select brain regions. Together, these results demonstrate an essential role of HDAC3 in brain development.

Mice were housed in a temperature-, humidity-, and light-controlled room (12-h light/dark cycle, lights from 7:00 AM to 19:00 PM). Food and water were available ad libitum. All procedures were conducted in accordance with the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals as approved by the Southern Methodist University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Hdac3−/− cKO mice were generated as described previously (10Bardai F.H. Price V. Zaayman M. Wang L. D'Mello S.R.

Briefly, for CNS-specific knockdown, mice homozygous for loxP sites in the HDAC3 locus (Hdac3neo-loxP) were bred to Nes-Cre (The Jackson Laboratory) transgenic mice that express the Cre recombinase throughout the developing CNS.

These Hdac3+/− mice were then interbred, and genotyping of pups was performed by P10. Genotyping of Nes-Cre/HDAC3, Thy1-Cre/HDAC3, and CaMKII-Cre/HDAC3 cKO mice was performed as described previously (10Bardai F.H. Price V. Zaayman M. Wang L. D'Mello S.R.

Briefly, DNA was extracted from mouse toe clips for Thy1-Cre/HDAC3 and CaMKII-Cre/HDAC3 or tail tissue for Nes-Cre/HDAC3 mice using the REDExtract-N-Amp tissue PCR kit from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO), and the DNA obtained was used in PCRs to determine the genotype: HDAC3, GCTTGGTAGCCAGCCAGCTTAG (forward) and CATGTGACCCCAGACATGACTGG (reverse); Cre, CCCGCAGAACCTGAAGATGTT (forward) and CGGCTATACGTAACAGGGTG (reverse); and Gdf, AAGCCCTCAGTCAGTTGTGC (forward) and AAAACCATGAAAGGAGTGGG (reverse). Mice were euthanized by carbon dioxide inhalation prior to dissection of brain tissue. Brain tissue was homogenized in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer and centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 10 min. Protein concentrations were taken using Bradford reagent from Bio-Rad. Protein samples were loaded on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel, transferred to a PVDF membrane, and probed with the following antibodies: anti-Total Erk (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA, 1:1000), anti-HDAC3 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, 1:500), anti-Olig2 (PhosphoSolutions, Aurora, CO, 1:500), anti-tubulin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, 1:1000), anti-GFAP (Cell Signaling Technology, 1:1000), anti-FLAG (Sigma-Aldrich), and anti-GFP (Sigma-Aldrich). After incubation in the appropriate secondary antibody, membranes were subjected to enhanced chemiluminescence (GE Healthcare). To assess differences in motor function in cKO mice, the TruScan system from Coulbourn Instruments (Whitehall, PA) was utilized. Mice were analyzed for 15 min, and six different measurements were taken. Five measurements corresponded to movements in the floor plane, and one measurement was taken for vertical movements. Data are an average of cKO mice and wild-type littermates. Sagittal brain sections were either stained with cresyl violet for structural studies or subjected to immunohistochemistry as described previously (16Chin P.C. Liu L. Morrison B.E. Siddiq A.

Briefly, brains were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m phosphate buffer and then allowed to sink in 20% sucrose solution in phosphate-buffered saline overnight. These brains were then frozen in cryopreservative solution (Cryo-STAT2, Statlab Medial Products, Lewisville, TX) on dry ice and sectioned sagitally at 20 μm on a cryostat. Sections were allowed to dry overnight. For cresyl violet staining, slides were immersed in xylene, followed by immersion in 100% ethanol, 95% ethanol, 70% ethanol, and distilled water. Slides were then immersed in cresyl violet staining solution and washed with distilled water. Finally, slides were immersed in 70% ethanol, 95% ethanol, 100% ethanol, and xylene. For immunohistochemistry, primary antibodies used on sections were as follows: Calbindin (Sigma-Aldrich, 1:500), GFAP (Cell Signaling Technology, 1:500), Ctip2 (Abcam, Cambridge, MA, 1:300), Satb2 (Abcam, 1:100), Tbr1 (Abcam, 1:4000), Ki67 (Neomarkers, Fremont, CA, 1:200), Reelin (Millipore, Billerica, MA, 1:400), and Olig2 (PhosphoSolutions, 1:500). Sections were first subjected to sodium citrate treatment and then blocked in 4% goat serum for 1 h. Then sections were incubated with primary antibody at 4 °C overnight, followed by incubation with Texas Red secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA, 1:300) or FITC secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, 1:300) for 1 h at room temperature, and DAPI was used to stain cell nuclei. For all histological and immunohistological analyses, data were collected and analyzed from analogous sections of the anterior cortex or cerebellum of cKO and wild-type littermate mice. The numbers of Satb2-positive, Ctip2-positive, Ki67-positive, and DAPI-stained cells were counted blindly within a 0.15 mm2 area in the anterior cortex or cerebellum using the taxonomy function in NIS-Elements Advanced Research software. An average was taken from different fields of the anterior cortex or cerebellum for four different groups of wild-type and cKO littermates. DAPI counts were displayed as an average. Because changes in the number of DAPI-stained cells could contribute to the changes in the number of positive cells, positive cells counts were normalized to DAPI and expressed as a percentage of wild-type littermate controls. Calbindin staining intensity in the Nes-Cre/HDAC3 cKO and wild-type littermates was assessed using NIH ImageJ Software as described previously (18Cvetanovic M. Patel J.M. Marti H.H. Kini A.R. Opal P. Vascular endothelial growth factor ameliorates the ataxic phenotype in a mouse model of spinocerebellar ataxia type 1.Nat. Med. 2011; 17: 1445-1447Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). For measurement of cortex or staining widths, NIS-elements Advanced Research software was used to calibrate the images, and then the measurement tools were used to quantify widths. The overall width of the cortex was measured from the top of layer I to the bottom of layer VI in the anterior cortex of wild-type and cKO littermates. Calbindin staining widths were collected as depicted in the schematic shown in Fig. 3. The measurements were averaged and expressed as a percentage of wild-type littermate controls. To examine binding of HDAC3 to the GFAP promoter, a glioblastoma cell line (U251), purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, was used. Briefly, cells were fixed in 1% formaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature. Fixation was stopped by adding glycine (0.125 m), and, after washing twice in ice-cold PBS, cells were collected and centrifuged at 1500 rpm for 10 min. Pellets were resuspended in 800 μl of buffer 1 (50 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.5), 140 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA (pH 8), 10% glycerol, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% Triton X-100, 1 mm PMSF, and protease inhibitor mixture). Cells were lysed for 10 min on ice, and nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation at 3000 rpm for 10 min. After washing once with buffer 2 (200 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA (pH 8), 0.5 mm EGTA (pH 8), 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.1), 0.5% SDS supplemented with 1 mm PMSF, and protease inhibitor mixture), nuclear were resuspended in buffer 3 (1 mm EDTA (pH 8), 0.5 mm EGTA (pH 8), 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.1), 0.5% SDS supplemented with 1 mm PMSF, and protease inhibitor mixture) and sonicated to a size range of 800- to 1000-bp fragments. Samples were centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C. For ChIP analysis, 100 μg of chromatin was used. Samples were incubated overnight with 5 μg of HDAC3 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or a control IgG antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). After washing once, chromatin was reverse-cross-linked by incubating at 65 °C overnight, and DNA was then purified and dissolved in 60 μl of 10 mm Tris (pH 7.5). For PCR, 3 μl of template DNA was used. Primers were targeted to the proximal region of the GFAP promoter (around −500 bp to TSS) as well as far upstream (around −5000 bp to TSS). Primer sequences included the following: GFAP promoter (−500 to TSS), 5′AGTGTGACCCAGGGAAGCCTA (forward) and 5′TTTATTGAGGGGACGGGCTGG (reverse); GFAP promoter (−5000 to TSS), 5′TGATGCCTTCCATTTCCGGG (forward) and 5′CCAAGGTACAACGCTGGGTA (reverse); Nestin promoter (−500 to TSS), 5′GGGCAGTGTCTCTCTGCAAT (forward) and 5′GAGCTGGAGCGAGGGTATTC (reverse); and Tubb2A promoter (−500 to TSS), 5′CTCGCCCTCGATTATCACCC (forward) and 5′CCTTTTATACCCGGGGACCG (reverse). U251 cells were transfected with FLAG-HDAC3 or GFP expression plasmids, purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, for 24 or 48 h. Cell lysate was collected, and Western blot analysis was conducted to examine expression of GFAP. For Luciferase activity experiments, HEK293 cells were cotransfected with pcDNA3.1 FLAG-HDAC3 and hGFAP-Luc vectors (Addgene, Cambridge, MA) that contained human a GFAP promoter fragment (−2163 to +47). Briefly, cells were transfected for 48 h and lysed, and then luciferase activity was measured on a BioTek Synergy microplate reader using a Dual-Luciferase assay (Promega, Madison, WI). All statistical analyses were done using GraphPad Prism software. Student's t tests were performed for all quantification experiments. Data are expressed as the mean ± S.E. * or ** denotes a p value of <0.05 or <0.01, respectively. Because conventional HDAC3 knockout mice die by embryonic day 9.5 (12Montgomery R.L. Potthoff M.J. Haberland M. Qi X. Matsuzaki S. Humphries K.M. Richardson J.A. Bassel-Duby R. Olson E.N. Maintenance of cardiac energy metabolism by histone deacetylase 3 in mice.J. Clin. Invest. 2008; 118: 3588-3597Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar), we generated cKO mice in which the HDAC3 gene was ablated in neural progenitor cells by crossing HDAC3fl/fl mice with Nes-Cre transgenic mice. Because Cre is expressed in neural progenitor cells, this results in mice lacking HDAC3 in the CNS (Fig. 1A). Mice homozygous for ablation of the HDAC3 allele, henceforth referred to as Nes-Cre/HDAC3 cKO mice, were born in expected numbers and were indistinguishable in appearance from wild-type littermates. However, none of more than 25 Nes-Cre/HDAC3 cKO mice identified in our studies survived beyond 16 h after birth. Examination of the stomach of Nes-Cre/HDAC3 cKO mice showed the presence of milk, ruling out starvation as the reason for death. The appearance of other internal organs also revealed no obvious abnormalities. Results from Western blot experiments confirmed a reduction in HDAC3 expression at the protein level (Fig. 1B). In contrast to Nes-Cre/HDAC3 cKO mice, mice lacking only one HDAC3 allele survived normally, displayed no obvious defects, and were fertile (data not shown). Examination of cresyl violet-stained sagittal sections of the Nes-Cre/HDAC3 brains revealed a decrease in width of the cortex (Fig. 1, C and D). Additionally, the cerebellum of the mutant displayed underdeveloped folia (Fig. 1, C and E). Quantification of cell numbers in random areas of the cortex and cerebellar cortex revealed a lower cell density in the mutant (Fig. 1F). TUNEL staining was performed to investigate whether the reduced cell number was due to increased cell death. However, no increase in TUNEL staining was discernible in the HDAC3 cKO cortex as compared with wild-type littermate controls (data not shown). This suggested that abnormal cell death, if any, was completed by P0 or because of a non-apoptotic mechanism. Alternatively, the reduced cell numbers could result from a reduction in cell production. Consistent with this possibility, we found that the proportion of Ki67-positive cells (Ki67 stains proliferating cells) is reduced in the cerebellum of Nes-Cre/HDAC3 cKO mice (Fig. 1, G and H). The neocortex in mammals is made up of six cellular layers, formed in an inside-out pattern, in which layer VI is formed first, whereas more superficial layers are formed later during brain development (19Hevner R.F. Layer-specific markers as probes for neuron type identity in human neocortex and malformations of cortical development.J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 2007; 66: 101-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Examination of cresyl violet-stained sections of Nes-Cre/HDAC3 cKO mice suggested abnormalities in the organization of cells (Fig. 2A). Furthermore, cresyl violet and DAPI staining showed a sharp reduction in the density of the cell-dense layer 2/3 in the mutant (Fig. 2, A and B). We therefore examined whether lamination of the cortex was normal in Nes-Cre/HDAC3 cKO mice using antibodies against Ctip2, which is expressed in deeper layer projecting neurons (layers V and VI, generated earlier), and Satb2, which is expressed in upper layer neurons (layers II-IV) (19Hevner R.F. Layer-specific markers as probes for neuron type identity in human neocortex and malformations of cortical development.J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 2007; 66: 101-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 20Arnold S.J. Huang G.J. Cheung A.F. Era T. Nishikawa S. Bikoff E.K. Molnár Z. Robertson E.J. Groszer M. The T-box transcription factor Eomes/Tbr2 regulates neurogenesis in the cortical subventricular zone.Genes Dev. 2008; 22: 2479-2484Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). In comparison with wild-type littermates, Ctip2 staining was found more superficially (Fig. 2, C and E), whereas Satb2 staining extended to deeper regions of the cortex (Fig. 2, D and E). Indeed, quantification of Ctip2- and Satb2-positive cells in subdivided sections along the width of the cortex (designated a–d) confirmed that there was a greater proportion of Ctip2-positive cells more superficially (Fig. 2F, a), whereas a greater proportion of Satb2-positive cells where found deeper within the cortex (Fig. 2G, d). The width of Ctip2-stained area of the cortex was similar in wild-type and mutant mice. In contrast, and consistent with the more diffuse localization pattern, the width of the Satb2-stained area was greater in the mutant mice (Fig. 2H). Although localizing in a broader pattern in the cKO cortex, the proportion of Satb2-positive cells was similar to the wild type (Fig. 2I). Similarly, the proportion of Ctip2-positive cells was not altered in the mutant (Fig. 2J). These results suggest that, although early born neurons behave normally, neurons generated later during cortical development fail to organize into a compact layer (Fig. 2, H and I). This conclusion is consistent with the absence of a well defined band of cells in layers II/III by cresyl violet and DAPI staining (Fig. 2, A and B). Previous studies have shown that Tbr1 knockout mice display a pattern of cellular organization similar to what we have detected in HDAC3 cKO mice, suggesting that the absence of HDAC3 might affect Tbr1 function (21Kwan K.Y. Sestan N. Anton E.S. Transcriptional co-regulation of neuronal migration and laminar identity in the neocortex.Development. 2012; 139: 1535-1546Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Normally, Tbr1 is expressed in select superficial and deep layer neurons, including layers II and V/VI, respectively (22Hevner R.F. Shi L. Justice N. Hsueh Y. Sheng M. Smiga S. Bulfone A. Goffinet A.M. Campagnoni A.T. Rubenstein J.L. Tbr1 regulates differentiation of the preplate and layer 6.Neuron. 2001; 29: 353-366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar). We found that the superficial Tbr1-positive band of cells was not well defined in the mutant, appearing more diffuse and merging with the deeper layer of Tbr1-positive cells that appeared to localize more superficially within the cortex (Fig. 3, A and B). Quantification of the overall proportion of Tbr1-positive cells revealed a significant reduction in Tbr1 in cKO mice compared with wild-type littermate controls (Fig. 3, C and D). Moreover, Western blot analysis showed a reduction in Tbr1 expression (Fig. 3E). These results confirm that HDAC3 plays an important role in regulating cortical cytoarchitecture and suggests that this role of HDAC3 involves Tbr1. The underdeveloped folia also indicated cerebellar defects. To investigate this, we performed calbindin immunohistochemistry, which detects Purkinje neurons. An overall reduction in calbindin staining intensity was observed in the Nes-Cre/HDAC3 cKO cerebellum (Fig. 4, A and B). Moreover, although Purkinje neurons in the wild-type P0 cerebellum were coalescing into a band of cells, they were much more dispersed in the mutant (Fig. 4, A, C, and D). We also found that the width of the external granule layer of the cerebellum was not significantly modified in the mutant (Fig. 4E). Because Nes-Cre-mediated ablation knocks out HDAC3 expression in astroglia and oligodendrocytes (but not in mesodermally derived microglia), we also examined the status of these glial cell types in the Nes-Cre/HDAC3 brain. Immunohistochemical analysis with Olig2 revealed a reduction in the proportion of oligodendrocytes both in the cortex and cerebellum (Fig. 5, A–D). GFAP is a commonly used marker for astrocytes. Although we were unable to detect significant GFAP staining in the P0 cortical plate or in the cerebellum of either wild-type or cKO mice, we observed robust staining in the medullae (Fig. 5, E and F). A comparison of staining in the medullae showed robust u"

Although several studies have identified important roles that individual sensory receptors play in the kidney, there has not been a systematic analysis of the renal repertoire of sensory receptors. In this study, we identify novel renal sensory receptors belonging to the GPR (n = 76), olfactory receptor (n = 6), and taste receptor (n = 11) gene families. A variety of reverse transcriptase (RT)- PCR screening strategies were used to identify novel renal sensory receptors, which were subsequently confirmed using gene-specific primers. The tissue-specific distribution of these receptors was determined, and the novel renal ORs were cloned from whole mouse kidney. Renal ORs that trafficked properly in vitro were screened for potential ligands using a dual-luciferase ligand screen, and novel ligands were identified for Olfr691. These studies demonstrate that multiple sensory receptors are expressed in the kidney beyond those previously identified. These results greatly expand the known repertoire of renal sensory receptors. Importantly, the mRNA of many of the receptors identified in this study are expressed highly in the kidney (comparable to well-known and extensively studied renal GPCRs), and in future studies it will be important to elucidate the roles that these novel renal receptors play in renal physiology."

A central pathway in the pathogenesis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is epithelial injury leading to activation of transforming growth factor β (TGFβ). The mechanism and functional consequences of influenza-induced activation of epithelial TGFβ are unclear. Influenza stimulates toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3), which can increase RhoA activity, a key event prior to activation of TGFβ by the αvβ6 integrin. We hypothesized that influenza would stimulate TLR3 leading to activation of latent TGFβ via αvβ6 integrin in epithelial cells. Using H1152 (IC50 6.1 μm) to inhibit Rho kinase and 6.3G9 to inhibit αvβ6 integrins, we demonstrate their involvement in influenza (A/PR/8/34 H1N1) and poly(I:C)-induced TGFβ activation. We confirm the involvement of TLR3 in this process using chloroquine (IC50 11.9 μm) and a dominant negative TLR3 construct (pZERO-hTLR3). Examination of lungs from influenza-infected mice revealed augmented levels of collagen deposition, phosphorylated Smad2/3, αvβ6 integrin, and apoptotic cells. Finally, we demonstrate that αvβ6 integrin-mediated TGFβ activity following influenza infection promotes epithelial cell death in vitro and enhanced collagen deposition in vivo and that this response is diminished in Smad3 knock-out mice. These data show that H1N1 and poly(I:C) can induce αvβ6 integrin-dependent TGFβ activity in epithelial cells via stimulation of TLR3 and suggest a novel mechanism by which influenza infection may promote collagen deposition in fibrotic lung disease.

We have previously shown that high glucose-induced matrix protein synthesis is associated with inactivation of glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β) in renal cells and in the kidneys of diabetic mice. We tested whether activation of GSK3β by sodium nitroprusside (SNP) mitigates kidney injury in diabetes. Studies in kidney-proximal tubular epithelial cells showed that SNP abrogated high glucose-induced laminin increment by stimulating GSK3β and inhibiting Akt, mTORC1, and events in mRNA translation regulated by mTORC1 and ERK. NONOate, an NO donor, also activated GSK3β, indicating that NO may mediate SNP stimulation of GSK3β. SNP administered for 3 weeks to mice with streptozotocin-induced type 1 diabetes ameliorated kidney hypertrophy, accumulation of matrix proteins, and albuminuria without changing blood glucose levels. Signaling studies showed that diabetes caused inactivation of GSK3β by activation of Src, Pyk2, Akt, and ERK; GSK3β inhibition activated mTORC1 and downstream events in mRNA translation in the kidney cortex. These reactions were abrogated by SNP. We conclude that activation of GSK3β by SNP ameliorates kidney injury induced by diabetes.

The previous thought that the Azoarcus genus comprises bacteria that fit into one of two major eco-physiological groups, either free-living anaerobic biodegraders of aromatic compounds or obligate endophytes unable to degrade aromatics under anaerobic conditions, is revisited here.Light, confocal and electron microscopy reveal that Azoarcus sp. CIB, a facultative anaerobe β-proteobacterium able to degrade aromatic hydrocarbons under anoxic conditions, is also able to colonize the intercellular spaces of the rice roots. In addition, the strain CIB displays plant growth promoting traits such nitrogen fixation, uptake of insoluble phosphorus and production of indoleacetic acid. Therefore, this work demonstrates by the first time that a free-living bacterium able to degrade aromatic compounds under aerobic and anoxic conditions can share also an endophytic lifestyle. The phylogenetic analyses based on the 16S rDNA and nifH genes confirmed that obligate endophytes of the Azoarcus genus and facultative endophytes, such as Azoarcus sp. CIB, locate into different evolutionary branches.This is the first report of a bacterium, Azoarcus sp. CIB, able to degrade anaerobically a significant number of aromatic compounds, some of them of great environmental concern, and to colonize the rice as a facultative endophyte. Thus, Azoarcus sp.

Therefore, this study evaluated the influence of a resistance training program on hemodynamic function, maximum strength gain, collagen deposition and inflammatory profile in chronic heart failure rats. Thirty-two male Wistar rats submitted to myocardial infarction by coronary artery ligation or sham surgery were assigned into four groups: sedentary sham (S-Sham, n = 8); trained sham (T-Sham, n = 8); sedentary chronic heart failure (S-CHF, n = 8) and trained chronic heart failure (T-CHF, n = 8). The maximum strength capacity was evaluated by the one maximum repetition test. Trained groups were submitted to an 8-week resistance training program (4 days/week, 4 sets of 10-12 repetitions/session, at 65% to 75% of one maximum repetition). After 8 weeks of the resistance training program, the T-CHF group showed lower left ventricular end diastolic pressure (P<0.001), higher left ventricular systolic pressure (P<0.05), higher systolic blood pressure (P<0.05), an improvement in the maximal positive derivative of ventricular pressure (P<0.05) and maximal negative derivative of ventricular pressure (P<0.05) when compared to the S-CHF group; no differences were observed when compared to Sham groups. In addition, resistance training was able to reduce myocardial hypertrophy (P<0.05), left ventricular total collagen volume fraction (P<0.01), IL-6 (P<0.05), and TNF-α/IL-10 ratio (P<0.05), as well as increasing IL-10 (P<0.05) in chronic heart failure rats when compared to the S-CHF group.

https://openalex.org/W2019087376,"Polyamines are small, ubiquitous, nitrogenous compounds that scavenge reactive oxygen species and stabilize the structure and function of the photosynthetic apparatus in response to abiotic stresses. Molecular details underlying polyamine-mediated photoprotective mechanisms are not completely resolved. This study investigated the role of spermidine (Spd) in the structure and function of the photosynthetic apparatus. Tomato seedlings were subjected to salinity-alkalinity stress with and without foliar application of Spd, and photosynthetic and morphological parameters were analyzed. Leaf dry weight and net photosynthetic rate were reduced by salinity-alkalinity stress. Salinity-alkalinity stress reduced photochemical quenching parameters, including maximum photochemistry efficiency of photosystem II, quantum yield of linear electron flux, and coefficient of photochemical quenching (qP). Salinity-alkalinity stress elevated nonphotochemical quenching parameters, including the de-epoxidation state of the xanthophyll cycle and nonphotochemical quenching (NPQ). Microscopic analysis revealed that salinity-alkalinity stress disrupted the internal lamellar system of granal and stromal thylakoids. Exogenous Spd alleviated the stress-induced reduction of leaf dry weight, net photosynthetic rate, and qP parameters. The NPQ parameters increased by salinity-alkalinity stress were also alleviated by Spd. Seedlings treated with exogenous Spd had higher zeaxanthin (Z) contents than those without Spd under salinity-alkalinity stress. The chloroplast ultrastructure had a more ordered arrangement in seedlings treated with exogenous Spd than in those without Spd under salinity-alkalinity stress. These results indicate that exogenous Spd can alleviate the growth inhibition and thylakoid membrane photodamage caused by salinity-alkalinity stress. The Spd-induced accumulation of Z also may have an important role in stabilizing the photosynthetic apparatus."

https://openalex.org/W2087259857,"The importance of inflammation is increasingly noticed in cancer. The aim of this study was to analyze the prognostic influence of pre-operative serum C-reactive protein (CRP) in a cohort of 148 lymph node-negative breast cancer patients. The prognostic significance of CRP level for disease-free survival (DFS), metastasis-free survival (MFS) and overall survival (OS) was evaluated using univariate and multivariate Cox regression, also including information on age at diagnosis, tumor size, tumor grade, estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) status, proliferation index (Ki67) and molecular subtype, as well as an assessment of the presence of necrosis and inflammation in the tumor tissue. Univariate analysis showed that CRP, as a continuous variable, was significantly associated with DFS (P = 0.002, hazard ratio [HR] = 1.04, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.02-1.07) and OS (P = 0.036, HR= 1.03, 95% CI = 1.00-1.06), whereas a trend was observed for MFS (P = 0.111). In the multivariate analysis, CRP retained its significance for DFS (P = 0.033, HR= 1.01, 95% CI = 1.00-1.07) as well as OS (P = 0.023, HR= 1.03, 95% CI = 1.00-1.06), independent of established prognostic factors. Furthermore, large-scale gene expression analysis by Affymetrix HG-U133A arrays was performed for 72 (48.6%) patients. The correlations between serum CRP and gene expression levels in the corresponding carcinoma of the breast were assessed using Spearman's rank correlation, controlled for false-discovery rate. No significant correlation was observed between CRP level and gene expression indicative of an ongoing local inflammatory process. In summary, pre-operatively elevated CRP levels at the time of diagnosis were associated with shorter DFS and OS independent of established prognostic factors in node-negative breast cancer, supporting a possible link between inflammation and prognosis in breast cancer."
https://openalex.org/W1966829183,"Objectives Sickness absence due to mental disease in the workplace has become a global public health problem. Previous studies report that sickness presenteeism is associated with sickness absence. We aimed to determine optimal cutoff scores for presenteeism in the screening of the future absences due to mental disease. Methods A prospective study of 2195 Japanese employees from all areas of Japan was conducted. Presenteeism and depression were measured by the validated Japanese version of the World Health Organization Health and Work Performance Questionnaire (WHO-HPQ) and K6 scale, respectively. Absence due to mental disease across a 2-year follow-up was surveyed using medical certificates obtained for work absence. Socioeconomic status was measured via a self-administered questionnaire. Receiver operating curve (ROC) analysis was used to determine optimal cutoff scores for absolute and relative presenteeism in relation to the area under the curve (AUC), sensitivity, and specificity. Results The AUC values for absolute and relative presenteeism were 0.708 (95% CI, 0.618–0.797) and 0.646 (95% CI, 0.546–0.746), respectively. Optimal cutoff scores of absolute and relative presenteeism were 40 and 0.8, respectively. With multivariate adjustment, cohort participants with our proposal cutoff scores for absolute and relative presenteeism were significantly more likely to be absent due to mental disease (OR = 4.85, 95% CI: 2.20–10.73 and OR = 5.37, 95% CI: 2.42–11.93, respectively). The inclusion or exclusion of depressive symptoms (K6≥13) at baseline in the multivariate adjustment did not influence the results. Conclusions Our proposed optimal cutoff scores of absolute and relative presenteeism are 40 and 0.8, respectively. Participants who scored worse than the cutoff scores for presenteeism were significantly more likely to be absent in future because of mental disease. Our findings suggest that the utility of presenteeism in the screening of sickness absence due to mental disease would help prevent such an absence."

Using PINK1B9 mutant Dm we sought to explore the effects of Mucuna pruriens methanolic extract (Mpe), a L-Dopa-containing herbal remedy of PD. The effects of Mpe on PINK1B9 mutants, supplied with standard diet to larvae and adults, were assayed on 3-6 (I), 10-15 (II) and 20-25 (III) days old flies. Mpe 0.1% significantly extended lifespan of PINK1B9 and fully rescued olfactory response to 1-hexanol and improved climbing behavior of PINK1B9 of all ages; in contrast, L-Dopa (0.01%, percentage at which it is present in Mpe 0.1%) ameliorated climbing of only PINK1B9 flies of age step II. Transmission electron microscopy analysis of antennal lobes and thoracic ganglia of PINK1B9 revealed that Mpe restored to wild type (WT) levels both T-bars and damaged mitochondria. Western blot analysis of whole brain showed that Mpe, but not L-Dopa on its own, restored bruchpilot (BRP) and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) expression to age-matched WT control levels. These results highlight multiple sites of action of Mpe, suggesting that its effects cannot only depend upon its L-Dopa content and support the clinical observation of Mpe as an effective medication with intrinsic ability of delaying the onset of chronic L-Dopa-induced long-term motor complications. Overall, this study strengthens the relevance of using PINK1B9 Dm as a translational model to study the properties of Mucuna pruriens for PD treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2123519130,"New Caledonia is a global biodiversity hotspot. Hypotheses for its biotic richness suggest either that the island is a 'museum' for an old Gondwana biota or alternatively it has developed following relatively recent long distance dispersal and in situ radiation. The conifer genus Araucaria (Araucariaceae) comprises 19 species globally with 13 endemic to this island. With a typically Gondwanan distribution, Araucaria is particularly well suited to testing alternative biogeographic hypotheses concerning the origins of New Caledonian biota. We derived phylogenetic estimates using 11 plastid and rDNA ITS2 sequence data for a complete sampling of Araucaria (including multiple accessions of each of the 13 New Caledonian Araucaria species). In addition, we developed a dataset comprising 4 plastid regions for a wider taxon sample to facilitate fossil based molecular dating. Following statistical analyses to identify a credible and internally consistent set of fossil constraints, divergence times estimated using a Bayesian relaxed clock approach were contrasted with geological scenarios to explore the biogeographic history of Araucaria. The phylogenetic data resolve relationships within Araucariaceae and among the main lineages in Araucaria, but provide limited resolution within the monophyletic New Caledonian species group. Divergence time estimates suggest a Late Cretaceous-Cenozoic radiation of extant Araucaria and a Neogene radiation of the New Caledonian lineage. A molecular timescale for the evolution of Araucariaceae supports a relatively recent radiation, and suggests that earlier (pre-Cenozoic) fossil types assigned to Araucaria may have affinities elsewhere in Araucariaceae. While additional data will be required to adequately resolve relationships among the New Caledonian species, their recent origin is consistent with overwater dispersal following Eocene emersion of New Caledonia but is too old to support a single dispersal from Australia to Norfolk Island for the radiation of the Pacific Araucaria sect.

The C-terminal region of FLASH contains a highly conserved domain that is also present at the end of Yin Yang 1-associated protein-related protein (YARP) and its Drosophila homologue, Mute, previously shown to localize to HLBs in Drosophila cells. Here, we show that the C-terminal domain of human FLASH and YARP interacts with the C-terminal region of NPAT and that this interaction is essential and sufficient to drive FLASH and YARP to HLBs in HeLa cells. Strikingly, only the last 16 amino acids of NPAT are sufficient for the interaction. We also show that the C-terminal domain of Mute interacts with a short region at the end of the Drosophila NPAT orthologue, multi sex combs (Mxc). Altogether, our data indicate that the conserved C-terminal domain shared by FLASH, YARP, and Mute recognizes the C-terminal sequence of NPAT orthologues, thus acting as a signal targeting proteins to HLBs. Finally, we demonstrate that the C-terminal domain of human FLASH can be directly joined with its N-terminal region through alternative splicing. The resulting 190-amino acid MiniFLASH, despite lacking 90% of full-length FLASH, contains all regions necessary for 3′ end processing of histone pre-mRNA in vitro and accumulates in HLBs.

The resulting 190-amino acid MiniFLASH, despite lacking 90% of full-length FLASH, contains all regions necessary for 3′ end processing of histone pre-mRNA in vitro and accumulates in HLBs. Transcription of animal replication-dependent histone genes gives rise to intronless mRNA precursors (pre-mRNAs) that undergo a specialized 3′ end processing reaction to form mature histone mRNAs (1Dominski Z.

In this reaction, histone pre-mRNAs are cleaved downstream of a highly conserved stem-loop structure, and the upstream cleavage product is not polyadenylated. Cleavage of histone pre-mRNAs requires the stem-loop binding protein (SLBP), 2The abbreviations used are: SLBPstem-loop binding proteinHLBhistone locus bodyNPATnuclear protein, ataxia-telangiectasia locusFLASHFlice-associated huge proteinYARPYin Yang 1-associated protein-related proteinPCNAproliferating cell nuclear antigen3-AT3-aminotriazoleHDEhistone downstream elementHCChistone pre-mRNA cleavage complexNLSnuclear localization sequence. which tightly interacts with the upstream stem-loop (4Tan D.

SLBP remains bound to the stem-loop following processing and assists mature histone mRNA on its way to the cytoplasm, where it stimulates translation of histone mRNAs into histone proteins (3Marzluff W.F.

The interaction between the U7 snRNP and histone pre-mRNA is mediated by the 5′ end of the U7 snRNA, which base pairs with the HDE. Following processing, the downstream cleavage product is degraded, liberating the U7 snRNP from the HDE for another round of processing (7Walther T.N. Wittop Koning T.H. Schümperli D. Müller B.

In mammalian cells, the cell cycle regulation of histone gene expression involves a 3–5-fold increase in the rate of transcription as cells enter S phase, but it is primarily achieved at the post-transcriptional level (3Marzluff W.F.

NPAT is phosphorylated by CDK2/cyclin E at the G1-S phase transition at multiple sites within the C-terminal half, and these modifications are essential for enhanced transcription of histone genes (20Ma T.

The post-transcriptional regulation involves activation of the U7-dependent processing of histone pre-mRNAs in S phase and rapid degradation of mature histone mRNAs upon completion of DNA replication (3Marzluff W.F. Wagner E.J. Duronio R.J. Metabolism and regulation of canonical histone mRNAs: life without a poly(A) tail.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2008; 9: 843-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). This regulation is largely achieved by the cell cycle-dependent synthesis of SLBP, which reaches the highest level in S phase and is degraded by the proteasome pathway in early G2 phase (25Zheng L.

HLBs are believed to coordinate expression of the five types of histone genes and increase production of mature histone mRNAs by creating high local concentrations of the limiting factors. How HLBs (and other nuclear bodies) are formed remains a matter of debate, and models, including both highly hierarchical and random events, have been proposed (29White A.E. Burch B.D. Yang X.C.

In Drosophila, the initial step in HLB formation involves the recognition of chromatin at a specific site in the histone gene loci by a yet unidentified mechanism and subsequent recruitment of multi sex combs (Mxc), the Drosophila orthologue of NPAT, and FLASH, followed by the recruitment of the U7 snRNP and other pre-mRNA processing factors (42Salzler H.R.

At least some of these factors are recruited to HLBs prior to expressing histone genes, i.e. in a manner independent of the presence of the histone pre-mRNAs (27Liu J.L. Murphy C. Buszczak M.

U.S.A. 1993; 90: 6257-6259Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), indicating that the initial phase of HLB assembly is primarily driven by protein-protein interactions. Protein-RNA interactions that emerge following the initiation of transcription on histone genes likely contribute to formation of the fully developed and readily detectable HLBs (45Shevtsov S.P. Dundr M. Nucleation of nuclear bodies by RNA.Nat. Cell Biol. 2011; 13: 167-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Recognizing the main players in forming this complex network of interactions is important for our understanding of both the biogenesis and function of HLBs. Here, we report the identification of a conserved interaction of human NPAT with a C-terminal domain shared by FLASH and an unrelated protein known as Yin Yang 1-associated protein-related protein (YARP) or Gon4l, a transcriptional repressor important in early development. YARP is a homologue of Drosophila Mute that localizes to HLBs in Drosophila cells (28Bulchand S. Menon S.D. George S.E. Chia W.

Muscle wasted: a novel component of the Drosophila histone locus body required for muscle integrity.J. Cell Sci. 2010; 123: 2697-2707Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). We show that YARP localizes to HLBs in HeLa cells and that the NPAT-interacting domain shared by FLASH and YARP serves as an HLB localization signal. Overall, our studies suggest that the direct interaction of NPAT with FLASH and YARP plays an essential role in the biogenesis of HLBs in animal cells and may provide an important bridge that integrates various nuclear events in histone gene expression. The C-terminal region of FLASH (amino acids 1880–1982) was cloned into the pGBKT7 vector (Clontech) and used to screen a normalized Mate and PlateTM library from HeLa S3 (Clontech, catalogue no. 630479), as suggested by the manufacturer. Human MiniFLASH was isolated by screening a normalized Universal Human Mate and PlateTM library (Clontech, catalogue no. 630480) against full-length Lsm11 cloned in pGBKT7 (9Yang X.C. Burch B.D.

Various fragments of FLASH, YARP, NPAT, Drosophila FLASH, Mute, and Mxc, each N-terminally fused to glutathione S-transferase (GST), were expressed in bacteria from the pET-42a vector and purified on nickel beads (Qiagen) via the His tag present on each fusion protein. For 35S labeling, each protein was cloned in a vector containing the SP6 RNA promoter and expressed in rabbit reticulocytes using the Transcription and Translation-coupled kit (TnT, Promega), according to the manufacturer's protocol. Various combinations of two different proteins, one tagged with GST (∼5 μg) and the other labeled with 35S (2.5–20 μl of the TnT reaction, depending on the efficiency of labeling) were mixed in 100 μl of binding buffer (100 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40) and incubated on ice for 30 min. The volume was subsequently increased to 600 μl with the binding buffer, and each sample was rotated with 30 μl of glutathione-agarose beads (Sigma) at 4 °C for 1 h. The beads were rinsed several times with the binding buffer, rotated with the same buffer for an additional 30 min, transferred to a new tube, and resuspended in an SDS sample buffer, and bound proteins were analyzed on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Each gel was initially stained with Coomassie Blue to monitor the amount of the GST-tagged proteins and subsequently dried and used for autoradiography to detect 35S-labeled proteins. The following peptides were used in competition experiments: Mock1, CLDLYEEILTEEGTAKEA; Mock2, CMLATGGFLQGDEADSY; and Mock3, CQDFYRIRDLLYEQYAIV. cDNA inserts encoding either human SLBP alone or human SLBP extended at the C terminus with the last 103 amino acids of human FLASH (amino acids 1880–1982) were cloned into pcDNA3/HA downstream from the region encoding three hemagglutinin (HA) tags. The same C-terminal fragment of human FLASH as well as a longer fragment (amino acids 1808–1982) containing a bipartite nuclear localization sequence were also cloned into the pEGFP-C3 vector (Clontech) to express GFP fusion proteins. The C-terminal regions of human NPAT (amino acids 1297–1427) and Drosophila Mxc (amino acids 1669–1837) were cloned into the pcDNA3/Myc vector immediately downstream of a single Myc epitope. Approximately 106 HeLa cells grown in monolayers were co-transfected in the presence of Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) with various combinations of constructs expressing the HA- and Myc-tagged proteins and 24 h later collected and lysed in Nonidet P-40 buffer (0.5% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 10 mm sodium azide, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The cell lysates were supplemented with EDTA to a final concentration of 10 mm and incubated 30 min on ice with 50 ng of the stem-loop RNA containing biotin at the 5′ end (Biot-SL) or with appropriate antibodies. Bound proteins were collected on streptavidin-Sepharose beads (RNA-mediated purification) or protein A-agarose beads (immunoprecipitation), separated in an SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and analyzed by Western blotting, using anti-HA and anti-Myc antibodies.

Aggregation is a physical symptom of a more general physicochemical condition of colloidal particles, namely, colloidal stability. Colloidal stability is a global indicator of the tendency of a system to reduce its net surface energy, which may be achieved by homo-aggregation or hetero-aggregation, including location at bio-interfaces. However, the role of colloidal stability as a driver of ENM bioactivity has received little consideration thus far. In the present work, which focuses on the toxicity of nanoscaled Fe° nanoparticles (nZVI) towards a model microalga, we demonstrate that colloidal stability is a fundamental driver of ENM bioactivity, comprehensively accounting for otherwise inexplicable differential biological effects. The present work throws light on basic aspects of Nanotoxicology, and reveals a key factor which may reconcile contradictory results on the influence of aggregation in bioactivity of ENMs."
https://openalex.org/W2007025013,"Botulinum neurotoxin (BoNT) inhibits neurotransmitter release in motor nerve endings, causing botulism, a condition often resulting from ingestion of the toxin or toxin-producing bacteria. BoNTs are always produced as large protein complexes by associating with a non-toxic protein, non-toxic non-hemagglutinin (NTNH), and some toxin complexes contain another non-toxic protein, hemagglutinin (HA), in addition to NTNH. These accessory proteins are known to increase the oral toxicity of the toxin dramatically. NTNH has a protective role against the harsh conditions in the digestive tract, while HA is considered to facilitate intestinal absorption of the toxin by intestinal binding and disruption of the epithelial barrier. Two specific activities of HA, carbohydrate and E-cadherin binding, appear to be involved in these processes; however, the exact roles of these activities in the pathogenesis of botulism remain unclear. The toxin is conventionally divided into seven serotypes, designated A through G. In this study, we identified the amino acid residues critical for carbohydrate and E-cadherin binding in serotype B HA. We constructed mutants defective in each of these two activities and examined the relationship of these activities using an in vitro intestinal cell culture model. Our results show that the carbohydrate and E-cadherin binding activities are functionally and structurally independent. Carbohydrate binding potentiates the epithelial barrier-disrupting activity by enhancing cell surface binding, while E-cadherin binding is essential for the barrier disruption."
https://openalex.org/W2094043108,"Neisseria gonorrhoeae is an obligate human pathogen that is responsible for the sexually-transmitted disease gonorrhea. N. gonorrhoeae encodes a T4SS within the Gonococcal Genetic Island (GGI), which secretes ssDNA directly into the external milieu. Type IV secretion systems (T4SSs) play a role in horizontal gene transfer and delivery of effector molecules into target cells. We demonstrate that GGI-like T4SSs are present in other β-proteobacteria, as well as in α- and γ-proteobacteria. Sequence comparison of GGI-like T4SSs reveals that the GGI-like T4SSs form a highly conserved unit that can be found located both on chromosomes and on plasmids. To better understand the mechanism of DNA secretion by N. gonorrhoeae, we performed mutagenesis of all genes encoded within the GGI, and studied the effects of these mutations on DNA secretion. We show that genes required for DNA secretion are encoded within the yaa-atlA and parA-parB regions, while genes encoded in the yfeB-exp1 region could be deleted without any effect on DNA secretion. Genes essential for DNA secretion are encoded within at least four different operons."

L. pneumophila replicates in protozoa and mammalian phagocytes within a unique “Legionella-containing vacuole.” The bacteria govern host cell interactions through the Icm/Dot type IV secretion system (T4SS) and ∼300 different “effector” proteins. Here we characterize a hitherto unrecognized Icm/Dot substrate, LppA, as a phytate phosphatase (phytase). Phytase activity of recombinant LppA required catalytically essential cysteine (Cys231) and arginine (Arg237) residues. The structure of LppA at 1.4 Å resolution revealed a mainly α-helical globular protein stabilized by four antiparallel β-sheets that binds two phosphate moieties. The phosphates localize to a P-loop active site characteristic of dual specificity phosphatases or to a non-catalytic site, respectively. Phytate reversibly abolished growth of L. pneumophila in broth, and growth inhibition was relieved by overproduction of LppA or by metal ion titration. L. pneumophila lacking lppA replicated less efficiently in phytate-loaded Acanthamoeba castellanii or Dictyostelium discoideum, and the intracellular growth defect was complemented by the phytase gene. These findings identify the chelator phytate as an intracellular bacteriostatic component of cell-autonomous host immunity and reveal a T4SS-translocated L. pneumophila phytase that counteracts intracellular bacterial growth restriction by phytate.

In addition to serving as a source of phosphorus, carbon, and energy, phytate may also play a role in bacterial iron acquisition by chelating metal ions. Accordingly, Pseudomonas aeruginosa employs phytate as an iron siderophore (35Smith A.W. Poyner D.R. Hughes H.K. Lambert P.A.

https://openalex.org/W2080531258,"Transitions between the different stages of the RNAPII transcription cycle involve the recruitment and exchange of factors, including mRNA capping enzymes, elongation factors, splicing factors, 3'-end-processing complexes, and termination factors. These transitions are coordinated by the dynamic phosphorylation of the C-terminal domain (CTD) of the largest subunit of RNAPII (Rpb1). The CTD is composed of reiterated heptapeptide repeats (Y(1)S(2)P(3)T(4)S(5)P(6)S(7)) that undergo phosphorylation and dephosphorylation as RNAPII transitions through the transcription cycle. An essential phosphatase in this process is Ssu72, which exhibits catalytic specificity for Ser(P)(5) and Ser(P)(7). Ssu72 is unique in that it is specific for Ser(P)(5) in one orientation of the CTD and for Ser(P)(7) when bound in the opposite orientation. Moreover, Ssu72 interacts with components of the initiation machinery and affects start site selection yet is an integral component of the CPF 3'-end-processing complex. Here we provide a comprehensive view of the effects of Ssu72 with respect to its Ser(P)(5) phosphatase activity. We demonstrate that Ssu72 dephosphorylates Ser(P)(5) at the initiation-elongation transition. Furthermore, Ssu72 indirectly affects the levels of Ser(P)(2) during the elongation stage of transcription but does so independent of its catalytic activity."
https://openalex.org/W2046100965,"The papillomavirus E2 protein is involved in the maintenance of persistent infection and known to bind either to cellular factors or directly to mitotic chromosomes in order to partition the viral genome into the daughter cells. However, how the HPV-16 E2 protein acts to facilitate partitioning of the viral genome remains unclear. In this study, we found that serine 243 of HPV-16 E2, located in the hinge region, is crucial for chromosome binding during mitosis. Bromodomain protein 4 (Brd4) has been identified as a cellular binding target through which the E2 protein of bovine papillomavirus type 1 (BPV-1) tethers the viral genome to mitotic chromosomes. Mutation analysis showed that, when the residue serine 243 was substituted by glutamic acid or aspartic acid, whose negative charges mimic the effect of constitutive phosphorylation, the protein still can interact with Brd4 and colocalize with Brd4 in condensed metaphase and anaphase chromosomes. However, substitution by the polar uncharged residues asparagine or glutamine abrogated Brd4 and mitotic chromosome binding. Moreover, following treatment with the inhibitor JQ1 to release Brd4 from the chromosomes, Brd4 and E2 formed punctate foci separate from the chromosomes, further supporting the hypothesis that the association of the HPV-16 E2 protein with the chromosomes is Brd4-dependent. In addition, the S243A E2 protein has a shorter half-life than the wild type, indicating that phosphorylation of the HPV-16 E2 protein at serine 243 also increases its half-life. Thus, phosphorylation of serine 243 in the hinge region of HPV-16 E2 is essential for interaction with Brd4 and required for host chromosome binding."

This study evaluated larval survival and the development rate of aquatic stages of An.gambiae s.s under five food regimes; tetramin fish food (a standard insectary larval food), maize pollen, Cerelac, green filamentous algae and dry powdered filamentous algae.Food materials were obtained from different sources, cerelac was made locally, fresh filamentous algae was taken from water bodies, dry filamentous algae was ground to powder after it was dried under shade, and maize pollen was collected from the flowering maize. Each food source type was used to feed three densities of mosquito larvae 20, 60, and 100 in six replicates each. Larval age structure was monitored daily until pupation and subsequently adult emergence. Tetramin was used and taken as a standard food source for An. gambiae s.s. larvae feeding in Insectary.Larval survivorship using maize pollen and Tetramin fish food was statistically insignificant (P = 0.564). However when compared to other food regime survivorship was significantly different with Tetramin fish food performing better than cerelac (P<0.001), dry algae (P<0.001) and fresh algae (P<0.001). The pupation rates and sex ratio of emerging adults had significant differences among the food regimes.The findings of this study have shown that maize pollen had closely similar nutritional value for larval survivorship to tetramin fish food, a standard larvae food in insectary. Further studies are required to assess the effect of food sources on various life traits of the emerged adults."
https://openalex.org/W2041641869,"Increasing evidence suggests that clock genes may be implicated in a spectrum of psychiatric diseases, including sleep and mood related disorders as well as schizophrenia. The bHLH transcription factors SHARP1/DEC2/BHLHE41 and SHARP2/DEC1/BHLHE40 are modulators of the circadian system and SHARP1/DEC2/BHLHE40 has been shown to regulate homeostatic sleep drive in humans. In this study, we characterized Sharp1 and Sharp2 double mutant mice (S1/2-/-) using online EEG recordings in living animals, behavioral assays and global gene expression profiling. EEG recordings revealed attenuated sleep/wake amplitudes and alterations of theta oscillations. Increased sleep in the dark phase is paralleled by reduced voluntary activity and cortical gene expression signatures reveal associations with psychiatric diseases. S1/2-/- mice display alterations in novelty induced activity, anxiety and curiosity. Moreover, mutant mice exhibit impaired working memory and deficits in prepulse inhibition resembling symptoms of psychiatric diseases. Network modeling indicates a connection between neural plasticity and clock genes, particularly for SHARP1 and PER1. Our findings support the hypothesis that abnormal sleep and certain (endo)phenotypes of psychiatric diseases may be caused by common mechanisms involving components of the molecular clock including SHARP1 and SHARP2."
https://openalex.org/W2062124724,"We have previously shown that the acyl transferase domain of ZmaA (ZmaA-AT) is involved in the biosynthesis of the aminopolyol polyketide/nonribosomal peptide hybrid molecule zwittermicin A from cereus UW85, and that it specifically recognizes the precursor hydroxymalonyl-acyl carrier protein (ACP) and transfers the hydroxymalonyl extender unit to a downstream second ACP via a transacylated AT domain intermediate. We now present the X-ray crystal structure of ZmaA-AT at a resolution of 1.7 Å. The structure shows a patch of solvent-exposed hydrophobic residues in the area where the AT is proposed to interact with the precursor ACP. We addressed the significance of the AT/ACP interaction in precursor specificity of the AT by testing whether malonyl- or methylmalonyl-ACP can be recognized by ZmaA-AT. We found that the ACP itself biases extender unit selection. Until now, structural information for ATs has been limited to ATs specific for the CoA-linked precursors malonyl-CoA and (2S)-methylmalonyl-CoA. This work contributes to polyketide synthase engineering efforts by expanding our knowledge of AT/substrate interactions with the structure of an AT domain that recognizes an ACP-linked substrate, the rare hydroxymalonate. Our structure suggests a model in which ACP interaction with a hydrophobic motif promotes secondary structure formation at the binding site, and opening of the adjacent substrate pocket lid to allow extender unit binding in the AT active site."
https://openalex.org/W2069640533,"Most murine models of fungal exposure are based on the delivery of uncharacterized extracts or liquid conidia suspensions using aspiration or intranasal approaches. Studies that model exposure to dry fungal aerosols using whole body inhalation have only recently been described. In this study, we aimed to characterize pulmonary immune responses following repeated inhalation of conidia utilizing an acoustical generator to deliver dry fungal aerosols to mice housed in a nose only exposure chamber. Immunocompetent female BALB/cJ mice were exposed to conidia derived from Aspergillus fumigatus wild-type (WT) or a melanin-deficient (Δalb1) strain. Conidia were aerosolized and delivered to mice at an estimated deposition dose of 1×105 twice a week for 4 weeks (8 total). Histopathological and immunological endpoints were assessed 4, 24, 48, and 72 hours after the final exposure. Histopathological analysis showed that conidia derived from both strains induced lung inflammation, especially at 24 and 48 hour time points. Immunological endpoints evaluated in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and the mediastinal lymph nodes showed that exposure to WT conidia led to elevated numbers of macrophages, granulocytes, and lymphocytes. Importantly, CD8+ IL17+ (Tc17) cells were significantly higher in BALF and positively correlated with germination of A. fumigatus WT spores. Germination was associated with specific IgG to intracellular proteins while Δalb1 spores elicited antibodies to cell wall hydrophobin. These data suggest that inhalation exposures may provide a more representative analysis of immune responses following exposures to environmentally and occupationally prevalent fungal contaminants."
https://openalex.org/W2021863260,"The protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi is responsible for the zoonotic Chagas disease, a chronic and systemic infection in humans and warm-blooded animals typically leading to progressive dilated cardiomyopathy and gastrointestinal manifestations. In the present study, we report that the transcription factor STAT1 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 1) reduces the susceptibility of human cells to infection with T. cruzi. Our in vitro data demonstrate that interferon -γ (IFNγ) pre-treatment causes T. cruzi-infected cells to enter an anti-parasitic state through the activation of the transcription factor STAT1. Whereas stimulation of STAT1-expressing cells with IFNγ significantly impaired intracellular replication of parasites, no protective effect of IFNγ was observed in STAT1-deficient U3A cells. The gene encoding indoleamine 2, 3-dioxygenase (ido) was identified as a STAT1-regulated target gene engaged in parasite clearance. Exposure of cells to T. cruzi trypomastigotes in the absence of IFNγ resulted in both sustained tyrosine and serine phosphorylation of STAT1 and its increased DNA binding. Furthermore, we found that in response to T. cruzi the total amount of intracellular STAT1 increased in an infectious dose-dependent manner, both at the mRNA and protein level. While STAT1 activation is a potent strategy of the host in the fight against the invading pathogen, amastigotes replicating intracellularly antagonize this pathway by specifically promoting the dephosphorylation of STAT1 serine 727, thereby partially circumventing its protective effects. These findings point to the crucial role of the IFNγ/STAT1 signal pathway in the evolutionary combat between T. cruzi parasites and their host."
https://openalex.org/W1990367125,"RNA editing is a post-transcriptional RNA process that provides RNA and protein complexity for regulating gene expression in eukaryotes. It is challenging to predict RNA editing by computational methods. In this study, we developed a novel method to predict RNA editing based on a random forest method. A careful feature selection procedure was performed based on the Maximum Relevance Minimum Redundancy (mRMR) and Incremental Feature Selection (IFS) algorithms. Eighteen optimal features were selected from the 77 features in our dataset and used to construct a final predictor. The accuracy and MCC (Matthews correlation coefficient) values for the training dataset were 0.866 and 0.742, respectively; for the testing dataset, the accuracy and MCC were 0.876 and 0.576, respectively. The performance was higher using 18 features than all 77, suggesting that a small feature set was sufficient to achieve accurate prediction. Analysis of the 18 features was performed and may shed light on the mechanism and dominant factors of RNA editing, providing a basis for future experimental validation."
https://openalex.org/W2012808516,"Glycoprotein hormone receptors (GPHR) have a large extracellular domain (ECD) divided into the leucine rich repeat (LRR) domain for binding of the glycoprotein hormones and the hinge region (HinR), which connects the LRR domain with the transmembrane domain (TMD). Understanding of the activation mechanism of GPHRs is hindered by the unknown interaction of the ECD with the TMD and the structural changes upon ligand binding responsible for receptor activation. Recently, our group showed that the HinR of the thyrotropin receptor (TSHR) can be replaced by those of the follitropin (FSHR) and lutropin receptor (LHCGR) without effects on surface expression and hTSH signaling. However, differences in binding characteristics for bovine TSH at the various HinRs were obvious. To gain further insights into the interplay between LRR domain, HinR and TMD we generated chimeras between the TSHR and FSHR. Our results obtained by the determination of cell surface expression, ligand binding and G protein activation confirm the similar characteristics of GPHR HinRs but they also demonstrate an involvement of the HinR in ligand selectivity indicated by the observed promiscuity of some chimeras. While the TSHR HinR contributes to specific binding of TSH and its variants, no such contribution is observed for FSH and its analog TR4401 at the HinR of the FSHR. Furthermore, the charge distribution at the poorly characterized LRR domain/HinR transition affected ligand binding and signaling even though this area is not in direct contact with the ligand. In addition our results also demonstrate the importance of the TMD/HinR interface. Especially the combination of the TSHR HinR with the FSHR-TMD resulted in a loss of cell surface expression of the respective chimeras. In conclusion, the HinRs of GPHRs do not only share similar characteristics but also behave as ligand specific structural and functional entities."
https://openalex.org/W2073864848,"Plexiform neurofibromas (PNFs) are benign nerve sheath tumors mostly associated with neurofibromatosis type 1. They often extend through multiple layers of tissue and therefore cannot be treated satisfactorily by surgery. Nilotinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor used to treat leukemia, with advantages over the prototype imatinib in terms of potency and selectivity towards BCR-ABL, and the DDR, PDGFR, and KIT receptor kinases. In this study, we compared efficacies of the two drugs on cultured cells of PNF in vitro and on xenografted tumor fragments on sciatic nerve of athymic nude mice. Xenografts were monitored weekly using a high resolution ultrasound measurement. Treatment with nilotinib at a daily dose of 100 mg/kg for four weeks led to a reduction of the graft sizesstd by 68±7% in the 8 treated mice, significantly more than the 33±8% reduction in the 8 untreated mice (P<0.05) and the 47±15% in the 7 mice treated with imatinib (P<0.05). The peak plasma nilotinib concentration 6.6±1.1 µM is within the pharmacological range of clinical application. Imatinib, but not nilotinib significantly hindered body weight increase of the mice and elevated cytotoxicity of mouse spleen cells (P<0.05). Our results suggest that nilotinib may be more potent than imatinib for treating PNFs and may also be better tolerated. Imatinib seems to have some off-target effect in elevating immunity."
https://openalex.org/W2168870302,"Species ranges have been shifting since the Pleistocene, whereby fragmentation, isolation, and the subsequent reduction in gene flow have resulted in local adaptation of novel genotypes and the repeated evolution of endemic species. While there is a wide body of literature focused on understanding endemic species, very few studies empirically test whether or not the evolution of endemics results in unique function or ecological differences relative to their widespread congeners; in particular while controlling for environmental variation. Using a common garden composed of 15 Eucalyptus species within the subgenus Symphyomyrtus (9 endemic to Tasmania, 6 non-endemic), here we hypothesize and show that endemic species are functionally and ecologically different from non-endemics. Compared to non-endemics, endemic Eucalyptus species have a unique suite of functional plant traits that have extended effects on herbivores. We found that while endemics occupy many diverse habitats, they share similar functional traits potentially resulting in an endemic syndrome of traits. This study provides one of the first empirical datasets analyzing the functional differences between endemics and non-endemics in a common garden setting, and establishes a foundation for additional studies of endemic/non-endemic dynamics that will be essential for understanding global biodiversity in the midst of rapid species extinctions and range shifts as a consequence of global change."
https://openalex.org/W1998573511,"Neurotransmitter transporters play an important role in termination of synaptic transmission by mediating reuptake of neurotransmitter, but the molecular processes behind translocation are still unclear. The crystal structures of the bacterial homologue, LeuT, provided valuable insight into the structural and dynamic requirements for substrate transport. These structures support the existence of gating domains controlling access to a central binding site. On the extracellular side, access is controlled by the ""thin gate"" formed by an interaction between Arg-30 and Asp-404. In the human dopamine transporter (DAT), the corresponding residues are Arg-85 and Asp-476. Here, we present results supporting the existence of a similar interaction in DAT. The DAT R85D mutant has a complete loss of function, but the additional insertion of an arginine in opposite position (R85D/D476R), causing a charge reversal, results in a rescue of binding sites for the cocaine analogue [(3)H]CFT. Also, the coordination of Zn(2+) between introduced histidines (R85H/D476H) caused a ∼ 2.5-fold increase in [(3)H]CFT binding (Bmax). Importantly, Zn(2+) also inhibited [(3)H]dopamine transport in R85H/D476H, suggesting that a dynamic interaction is required for the transport process. Furthermore, cysteine-reactive chemistry shows that mutation of the gating residues causes a higher proportion of transporters to reside in the outward facing conformation. Finally, we show that charge reversal of the corresponding residues (R104E/E493R) in the serotonin transporter also rescues [(3)H](S)-citalopram binding, suggesting a conserved feature. Taken together, these data suggest that the extracellular thin gate is present in monoamine transporters and that a dynamic interaction is required for substrate transport."

We used a computational model to investigate the effect of the inlet and outlet flow conditions on the supersonic separation process. We found that the shock wave was sensitive to the inlet or back pressure compared to the inlet temperature. The shock position shifted forward with a higher inlet or back pressure. It indicated that an increasing inlet pressure declined the pressure recovery capacity. Furthermore, the shock wave moved out of the diffuser when the ratio of the back pressure to the inlet one was greater than 0.75, in which the state of the low pressure and temperature was destroyed, resulting in the re-evaporation of the condensed liquids. Natural gas would be the subsonic flows in the whole supersonic separator, if the mass flow rate was less than the design value, and it could not reach the low pressure and temperature for the condensation and separation of the water vapor. These results suggested a guidance mechanism for natural gas supersonic separation in various flow conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2160609829,"In rheumatoid arthritis (RA) macrophages play a major role in amplifying synovial inflammation. Important activating signals are those induced by Toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands and by activated T cells. The balance between activating and inhibitory Fc gamma receptors (FcγRs) on macrophages might be crucial in modulating these inflammatory responses. The purpose of this study was to determine FcγR expression on pro- and anti-inflammatory macrophages (gmMφ and mMφ, respectively) and identify functional consequences on immune complex uptake and macrophage activation.Human monocytes were isolated and differentiated into gmMφ and mMφ. A full FcγR characterization of both macrophage subtypes was performed and uptake of fluorescent immune complexes (ICs) was determined. FcγRIIb isoforms were determined by qPCR. Macrophages were stimulated via different TLRs or cytokine activated T cells in the presence or absence of ICs and cytokine production was determined. Blocking studies were performed to look into the pathways involved.mMφ expressed high levels of the activating FcγRIIa and FcγRIII and low levels of the inhibitory FcγRIIb, while the FcγR balance on gmMφ was shifted towards the inhibitory FcγRIIb. This was accompanied by a clear increase in FcγRIIb1 mRNA expression in gmMφ. This resulted in higher IC uptake by mMφ compared to gmMφ. Furthermore, FcγR-mediated stimulation of gmMφ inhibited TLR2, 3, 4 and 7/8 mediated cytokine production via FcγRIIb and PI3K signaling. In addition, gmMφ but not mMφ produced TNFα upon co-culture with cytokine activated T cells, which was reduced by IC binding to FcγRIIb. The latter was dependent on PI3K signaling and COX2.FcγR expression patterns on gmMφ and mMφ are significantly different, which translates in clear functional differences further substantiating FcγRIIb as an interesting target for inflammation control in RA and other autoimmune/inflammatory diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2117766285,"Genetic mutations in a vital muscle protein dystrophin trigger X-linked dilated cardiomyopathy (XLDCM). However, disease mechanisms at the fundamental protein level are not understood. Such molecular knowledge is essential for developing therapies for XLDCM. Our main objective is to understand the effect of disease-causing mutations on the structure and function of dystrophin. This study is on a missense mutation K18N. The K18N mutation occurs in the N-terminal actin binding domain (N-ABD). We created and expressed the wild-type (WT) N-ABD and its K18N mutant, and purified to homogeneity. Reversible folding experiments demonstrated that both mutant and WT did not aggregate upon refolding. Mutation did not affect the protein's overall secondary structure, as indicated by no changes in circular dichroism of the protein. However, the mutant is thermodynamically less stable than the WT (denaturant melts), and unfolds faster than the WT (stopped-flow kinetics). Despite having global secondary structure similar to that of the WT, mutant showed significant local structural changes at many amino acids when compared with the WT (heteronuclear NMR experiments). These structural changes indicate that the effect of mutation is propagated over long distances in the protein structure. Contrary to these structural and stability changes, the mutant had no significant effect on the actin-binding function as evident from co-sedimentation and depolymerization assays. These results summarize that the K18N mutation decreases thermodynamic stability, accelerates unfolding, perturbs protein structure, but does not affect the function. Therefore, K18N is a stability defect rather than a functional defect. Decrease in stability and increase in unfolding decrease the net population of dystrophin molecules available for function, which might trigger XLDCM. Consistently, XLDCM patients have decreased levels of dystrophin in cardiac muscle."
https://openalex.org/W2072964448,"Eucalypt cultivation is an important economic activity worldwide. In Portugal, Eucalyptus globulus plantations account for one-third of the total forested area. The nutritional requirements of this crop have been well studied, and nitrogen (N) is one of the most important elements required for vegetal growth. N dynamics in soils are influenced by microorganisms, such as diazotrophic bacteria (DB) that are responsible for biological nitrogen fixation (BNF), so the aim of this study was to evaluate and identity the main groups of DB in E. globulus plantations. Samples of soil and root systems were collected in winter and summer from three different Portuguese regions (Penafiel, Gavião and Odemira). We observed that DB communities were affected by season, N fertilization and moisture. Furthermore Bradyrhizobium and Burkholderia were the most prevalent genera in these three regions. This is the first study describing the dynamic of these bacteria in E. globulus plantations, and these data will likely contribute to a better understanding of the nutritional requirements of eucalypt cultivation and associated organic matter turnover."
https://openalex.org/W2038848895,"DCs act as sentinel cells against incoming pathogens and represent the most potent antigen presenting cells, having the unique capability to prime naïve T cells. In addition to their role in induction of adaptive immune responses, DC are also able to activate innate cells as γδ T cells; in particular, a reciprocal crosstalk between DC and γδ T cells was demonstrated. However, whether HIV infection may alter DC-Vγ9Vδ2 T cells cross-talk was not yet described. To clarify this issue, we cultured activated Vγ9Vδ2 T cells with HIV infected monocyte derived DC (MoDC). After 5 days we evaluated MoDC phenotype, and Vγ9Vδ2 T cells activation and proliferation. In our model, Vγ9Vδ2 T cells were not able to proliferate in response to HIV-infected MoDC, although an up-regulation of CD69 was observed. Upon phosphoantigens stimulation, Vγ9Vδ2 T cells proliferation and cytokine production were inhibited when cultured with HIV-infected MoDC in a cell-contact dependent way. Moreover, HIV-infected MoDC are not able to up-regulate CD86 molecules when cultured with activated Vγ9Vδ2 T cells, compared with uninfected MoDC. Further, activated Vγ9Vδ2 T cells are not able to induce HLA DR up-regulation and CCR5 down-regulation on HIV-infected MoDC. These data indicate that HIV-infected DC alter the capacity of Vγ9Vδ2 T cells to respond to their antigens, pointing out a new mechanisms of induction of Vγ9Vδ2 T cells anergy carried out by HIV, that could contribute to immune evasion."
https://openalex.org/W2033042211,"Seed predators can limit plant recruitment and thus profoundly impinge the dynamics of plant populations, especially when diverse seed predators (e.g., native and introduced) attack particular plant populations. Surprisingly, however, we know little concerning the potential hierarchy of spatial scales (e.g., region, population, patch) and coupled ecological correlates governing variation in the overall impact that native and introduced seed predators have on plant populations. We investigated several spatial scales and ecological correlates of pre-dispersal seed predation by invasive borer beetles in Chamaerops humilis (Arecaceae), a charismatic endemic palm of the Mediteranean basin. To this end, we considered 13 palm populations (115 palms) within four geographical regions of the Iberian Peninsula. The observed interregional differences in percentages of seed predation by invasive beetles were not significant likely because of considerable variation among populations within regions. Among population variation in seed predation was largely related to level of human impact. In general, levels of seed predation were several folds higher in human-altered populations than in natural populations. Within populations, seed predation declined significantly with the increase in amount of persisting fruit pulp, which acted as a barrier against seed predators. Our results revealed that a native species (a palm) is affected by the introduction of related species because of the concurrent introduction of seed predators that feed on both the introduced and native palms. We also show how the impact of invasive seed predators on plants can vary across a hierarchy of levels ranging from variation among individuals within local populations to large scale regional divergences."

Furthermore, the strains were inoculated into the AC of mice. Changes in bacterial growth, electroretinography and inflammation scores were monitored.Bovine AH and VH provide sufficient nutrition for S. aureus growth in vitro. Transcriptome analysis identified 72 unique open reading frames differentially regulated ≥10-fold between CDM, AH, and VH. In the AC model, we found comparable growth of the codY mutant and wild type strains in vivo. Average inflammation scores and retinal function were significantly worse for codY mutant-infected eyes at 24 h post-infection.Our in vitro bovine AH and VH models identified likely nutrient sources for S. aureus in the ocular milieu. The in vivo model suggests that control of branched-chain amino acid availability has therapeutic potential in limiting S. aureus endophthalmitis severity."
https://openalex.org/W2091947029,"Glycerolipid synthesis represents a central metabolic process of all forms of life. In the last decade multiple genes coding for enzymes responsible for the first step of the pathway, catalyzed by glycerol 3-phosphate acyltransferase (GPAT), have been described, and characterized primarily in model organisms like Saccharomyces cerevisiae and mice. Notoriously, the fungal enzymes share low sequence identity with their known animal counterparts, and the nature of their homology is unclear. Furthermore, two mitochondrial GPAT isoforms have been described in animal cells, while no such enzymes have been identified in Fungi. In order to determine if the yeast and mammalian GPATs are representative of the set of enzymes present in their respective groups, and to test the hypothesis that metazoan orthologues are indeed absent from the fungal clade, a comparative genomic and phylogenetic analysis was performed including organisms spanning the breadth of the Opisthokonta supergroup. Surprisingly, our study unveiled the presence of ‘fungal’ orthologs in the basal taxa of the holozoa and ‘animal’ orthologues in the basal holomycetes. This includes a novel clade of fungal homologues, with putative peroxisomal targeting signals, of the mitochondrial/peroxisomal acyltransferases in Metazoa, thus potentially representing an undescribed metabolic capacity in the Fungi. The overall distribution of GPAT homologues is suggestive of high relative complexity in the ancestors of the opisthokont clade, followed by loss and sculpting of the complement in the descendent lineages. Divergence from a general versatile metabolic model, present in ancestrally deduced GPAT complements, points to distinctive contributions of each GPAT isoform to lipid metabolism and homeostasis in contemporary organisms like humans and their fungal pathogens."
https://openalex.org/W2000718944,"Background Food supply is a major factor influencing growth rates in animals. This has important implications for both natural and farmed fish populations, since food restriction may difficult reproduction. However, a study on the effects of food supply on the development of juvenile gonads has never been transcriptionally described in fish. Methods and Findings This study investigated the consequences of growth on gonadal transcriptome of European sea bass in: 1) 4-month-old sexually undifferentiated fish, comparing the gonads of fish with the highest vs. the lowest growth, to explore a possible link between transcriptome and future sex, and 2) testis from 11-month-old juveniles where growth had been manipulated through changes in food supply. The four groups used were: i) sustained fast growth, ii) sustained slow growth, iii) accelerated growth, iv) decelerated growth. The transcriptome of undifferentiated gonads was not drastically affected by initial natural differences in growth. Further, changes in the expression of genes associated with protein turnover were seen, favoring catabolism in slow-growing fish and anabolism in fast-growing fish. Moreover, while fast-growing fish took energy from glucose, as deduced from the pathways affected and the analysis of protein-protein interactions examined, in slow-growing fish lipid metabolism and gluconeogenesis was favored. Interestingly, the highest transcriptomic differences were found when forcing initially fast-growing fish to decelerate their growth, while accelerating growth of initially slow-growing fish resulted in full transcriptomic convergence with sustained fast-growing fish. Conclusions Food availability during sex differentiation shapes the juvenile testis transcriptome, as evidenced by adaptations to different energy balances. Remarkably, this occurs in absence of major histological changes in the testis. Thus, fish are able to recover transcriptionally their testes if they are provided with enough food supply during sex differentiation; however, an initial fast growth does not represent any advantage in terms of transcriptional fitness if later food becomes scarce."
https://openalex.org/W2024324118,"The study of the production of co-speech gestures (CSGs), i.e., meaningful hand movements that often accompany speech during everyday discourse, provides an important opportunity to investigate the integration of language, action, and memory because of the semantic overlap between gesture movements and speech content. Behavioral studies of CSGs and speech suggest that they have a common base in memory and predict that overt production of both speech and CSGs would be preceded by neural activity related to memory processes. However, to date the neural correlates and timing of CSG production are still largely unknown. In the current study, we addressed these questions with magnetoencephalography and a semantic association paradigm in which participants overtly produced speech or gesture responses that were either meaningfully related to a stimulus or not. Using spectral and beamforming analyses to investigate the neural activity preceding the responses, we found a desynchronization in the beta band (15–25 Hz), which originated 900 ms prior to the onset of speech and was localized to motor and somatosensory regions in the cortex and cerebellum, as well as right inferior frontal gyrus. Beta desynchronization is often seen as an indicator of motor processing and thus reflects motor activity related to the hand movements that gestures add to speech. Furthermore, our results show oscillations in the high gamma band (50–90 Hz), which originated 400 ms prior to speech onset and were localized to the left medial temporal lobe. High gamma oscillations have previously been found to be involved in memory processes and we thus interpret them to be related to contextual association of semantic information in memory. The results of our study show that high gamma oscillations in medial temporal cortex play an important role in the binding of information in human memory during speech and CSG production."
https://openalex.org/W2051250740,"'Stimulus roving' refers to a paradigm in which the properties of the stimuli to be discriminated vary from trial to trial, rather than being kept constant throughout a block of trials. Rhesus monkeys have previously been shown to improve their contrast discrimination performance on a non-roving task, in which they had to report the contrast of a test stimulus relative to that of a fixed-contrast sample stimulus. Human psychophysics studies indicate that roving stimuli yield little or no perceptual learning. Here, we investigate how stimulus roving influences perceptual learning in macaque monkeys and how the addition of flankers alters performance under roving conditions. Animals were initially trained on a contrast discrimination task under non-roving conditions until their performance levels stabilized. The introduction of roving contrast conditions resulted in a pronounced drop in performance, which suggested that subjects initially failed to heed the sample contrast and performed the task using an internal memory reference. With training, significant improvements occurred, demonstrating that learning is possible under roving conditions. To investigate the notion of flanker-induced perceptual learning, flanker stimuli (30% fixed-contrast iso-oriented collinear gratings) were presented jointly with central (roving) stimuli. Presentation of flanker stimuli yielded substantial performance improvements in one subject, but deteriorations in the other. Finally, after the removal of flankers, performance levels returned to their pre-flanker state in both subjects, indicating that the flanker-induced changes were contingent upon the continued presentation of flankers."
https://openalex.org/W2072648156,"Background Use of nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT) for the diagnosis of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB) has been recommended on respiratory specimens submitted for acid-fast bacilli (AFB) testing. It also helps distinguish between TB and non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) species in a setting where NTM rates are relatively high. The purposes of this study are to describe the trend and characteristics of all AFB smear-positive respiratory samples that underwent amplified Mycobacterium tuberculosis direct (MTD) testing, a type of NAAT, and to evaluate the clinical utility and necessity of the test for diagnosis of TB in a population with high-HIV prevalence. Methods Prospective diagnostic testing and retrospective data analyses were conducted on all AFB smear-positive respiratory samples that underwent MTD testing from 2001 to 2011 at Grady Memorial Hospital (GMH), Atlanta, USA. The test performance was compared to culture. Results A total of 2,240 AFB smear-positive specimens from 1,412 patients were tested and analyzed in the study. The proportion of specimens that were culture-positive for TB was 28.5%. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of the MTD were 99.0%, 98.0%, 95.3% and 99.6%, respectively. A downward trend was observed in the yearly numbers as well as the proportions of MTD-positive specimens during the study period (p<0.01). There were 2,027 (90.5%) specimens from patients with known HIV status, of which 70.6% was HIV positive and the majority of them (81.8%) had CD4 counts of less than 200 cells/µL. HIV-positives were more likely to have NTM compared to HIV negatives (67.7% vs. 35.4%, p<0.01). Conclusion Despite the decrease in the incidence of TB, NAAT continues to be an accurate and important diagnostic test in a population with high HIV prevalence, and it differentiates TB and NTM organisms."
https://openalex.org/W2090267051,"The sodium- and chloride-coupled GABA transporter GAT-1 is a member of the neurotransmitter:sodium:symporters, which are crucial for synaptic transmission. Structural work on the bacterial homologue LeuT suggests that extracellular loop 4 closes the extracellular solvent pathway when the transporter becomes inward-facing. To test whether this model can be extrapolated to GAT-1, cysteine residues were introduced at positions 359 and 448 of extracellular loop 4 and transmembrane helix 10, respectively. Treatment of HeLa cells, expressing the double cysteine mutant S359C/K448C with the oxidizing reagent copper(II)(1,10-phenantroline)3, resulted in a significant inhibition of [(3)H]GABA transport. However, transport by the single cysteine mutant S359C was also inhibited by the oxidant, whereas its activity was almost 4-fold stimulated by dithiothreitol. Both effects were attenuated when the conserved cysteine residues, Cys-164 and/or Cys-173, were replaced by serine. These cysteines are located in extracellular loop 2, the role of which in the structure and function of the eukaryotic neurotransmitter:sodium:symporters remains unknown. The inhibition of transport of S359C by the oxidant was markedly reduced under conditions expected to increase the proportion of inward-facing transporters, whereas the reactivity of the mutants to a membrane-impermeant sulfhydryl reagent was not conformationally sensitive. Our data suggest that extracellular loops 2 and 4 come into close proximity to each other in the outward-facing conformation of GAT-1."
https://openalex.org/W2130721685,"Previous studies have revealed top-down control during memory retrieval from the prefrontal cortex to the temporal cortex. In the present functional MRI study, we investigated whether the fronto-temporal functional interaction occurs even during fixation periods after memory retrieval trials. During recency judgments, subjects judged the temporal order of two items in a study list. The task used in the present study consisted of memory trials of recency judgments and non-memory trials of counting dots, and post-trial fixation periods. By comparing the brain activity during the fixation periods after the memory trials with that during the fixation periods after the non-memory trials, we detected heightened brain activity in the lateral prefrontal cortex, the lateral temporal cortex and the hippocampus. Functional interactions during the fixation periods after the memory vs. non-memory trials as examined using a psychophysiological interaction revealed a decreased interaction from the lateral prefrontal cortex to the lateral temporal cortex, but not to the hippocampus. The functional interaction between the same frontal and temporal regions was also present during the memory trials. A trial-based functional connectivity analysis further revealed that the fronto-temporal interaction was positive and decreased during the fixation periods after the memory trials, relative to the fixation periods after the non-memory trials. These results suggest that the fronto-temporal interaction existed during the post-trial fixation periods, which had been present during the memory trials and temporally extended into the fixation periods."
