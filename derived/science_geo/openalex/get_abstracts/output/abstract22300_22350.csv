https://openalex.org/W1984754431,"Although the immediate receptors (immunophilins) of the immunosuppressants cyclosporin A (CsA) and FK506 are distinct, their similar mechanisms of inhibition of cell signaling suggest that their associated immunophilin complexes interact with a common target. We report here that the complexes cyclophilin-CsA and FKBP-FK506 (but not cyclophilin, FKBP, FKBP-rapamycin, or FKBP-506BD) competitively bind to and inhibit the Ca2+- and calmodulin-dependent phosphatase calcineurin, although the binding and inhibition of calcineurin do not require calmodulin. These results suggest that calcineurin is involved in a common step associated with T cell receptor and IgE receptor signaling pathways and that cyclophilin and FKBP mediate the actions of CsA and FK506, respectively, by forming drug-dependent complexes with and altering the activity of calcineurin-calmodulin."

https://openalex.org/W2063013559,"FK506 and rapamycin are related immunosuppressive compounds that block helper T cell activation by interfering with signal transduction. In vitro, both drugs bind and inhibit the FK506-binding protein (FKBP) proline rotamase. Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells treated with rapamycin irreversibly arrested in the G1 phase of the cell cycle. An FKBP-rapamycin complex is concluded to be the toxic agent because (i) strains that lack FKBP proline rotamase, encoded by FPR1, were viable and fully resistant to rapamycin and (ii) FK506 antagonized rapamycin toxicity in vivo. Mutations that conferred rapamycin resistance altered conserved residues in FKBP that are critical for drug binding. Two genes other than FPR1, named TOR1 and TOR2, that participate in rapamycin toxicity were identified. Nonallelic noncomplementation between FPR1, TOR1, and TOR2 alleles suggests that the products of these genes may interact as subunits of a protein complex. Such a complex may mediate nuclear entry of signals required for progression through the cell cycle."

https://openalex.org/W2010691166,"CFTR, the protein associated with cystic fibrosis, is phosphorylated on serine residues in response to cAMP agonists. Serines 660, 737, 795, and 813 were identified as in vivo targets for phosphorylation by protein kinase A. The SPQ fluorescence assay revealed that mutagenesis of any one of these sites did not affect Cl- channel activity. Indeed, concomitant mutagenesis of three of the four sites still resulted in cAMP-responsive Cl- channel activity. However, mutagenesis of all four sites abolished the response. One interpretation of these results is that the CFTR Cl- channel is blocked by the R domain and that phosphorylation on serines by protein kinase A electrostatically repels the domain, allowing passage of Cl-. The four phosphorylation events appear to be degenerate: no one site is essential for channel activity, and, at least in the case of serine 660, phosphorylation at one site alone is sufficient for regulation of Cl- channel activity."
https://openalex.org/W2008515082,"LECAM-1 (leukocyte-endothelial cell adhesion molecule 1), the lymphocyte lectin (""selectin"") homing receptor for peripheral lymph nodes (PLNs), participates in the earliest interactions of polymorphonuclear neutrophilic leukocytes (PMNs) with inflamed venules. Here, we present evidence that LECAM-1 mediates this function through a novel mechanism--presentation of oligosaccharide ligands to the inducible vascular selectins endothelial-leukocyte adhesion molecule (ELAM-1) and granule membrane protein 140 (GMP-140). PMN, but not lymphocyte, LECAM-1 is modified with the vascular selectin ligand sialyl Lewis x (sLex) and specifically binds ELAM-1-transfected cells. Although only a small fraction of total cell surface sLex, LECAM-1-associated sLex appears to play a prominent role in PMN interactions with cell-associated ELAM-1 and GMP-140, as anti-LECAM-1 monoclonal antibodies or selective removal of cell surface LECAM-1 inhibits PMN binding to vascular selectin transfectants by up to 70%. The enhanced function of LECAM-1-associated sLex may reflect the striking concentration, shown here, of LECAM-1 on PMN surface microvilli, the site of initial cellular contact."

https://openalex.org/W1988189113,"Receptor channels activated by glutamate, an excitatory neurotransmitter in the mammalian brain, are involved in processes such as long-term potentiation and excitotoxicity. Studies of glutamate receptor channels expressed in cultured hippocampal pyramidal neurons reveal that these channels are subject to neuromodulatory regulation through the adenylate cyclase cascade. The whole-cell current response to glutamate and kainate [a non-NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) receptor agonist] was enhanced by forskolin, an activator of adenylate cyclase. Single-channel analysis revealed that an adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate-dependent protein kinase (PKA) increases the opening frequency and the mean open time of the non-NMDA-type glutamate receptor channels. Analysis of synaptic events indicated that forskolin, acting through PKA, increased the amplitude and decay time of spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents."

https://openalex.org/W2029128430,"Among the molecules that determine the developmental fate of sympathetic neurons from noradrenergic to cholinergic function are two apparently unrelated proteins, cholinergic differentiation factor and ciliary neurotrophic factor (CDF and CNTF, respectively). The present work suggests a structural basis for their functional overlap: sequence pattern-matching and predictive structure analysis contends that CDF and CNTF are homologous and share a common helical framework. An integrated CDF/CNTF profile also reveals similar sequence/structure motifs in a group of hematopoietic cytokines composed of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, interleukin-6, and a novel factor called oncostatin M; a more distant relationship is indicated with interleukin-3 and interferons-alpha/beta. Evolutionary ties between neuropoietic and hematopoietic cytokines predict a distinctive tertiary architecture for the uncharacterized CDF and CNTF receptors. The intertwined cytokine/receptor networks signal a closer relationship between the molecular mechanisms underlying neuro- and hematopoiesis."
https://openalex.org/W2094019443,"The N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor, a subtype of glutamate receptors, plays a key role in synaptic plasticity in the nervous system. After NMDA receptor activation, calcium entry into the postsynaptic neuron is a critical initial event. However, the subsequent mechanisms by which the NMDA receptor signal is processed are incompletely understood. Stimulation of cultured rat hippocampal cells with glutamate resulted in the rapid and transient tyrosine phosphorylation of a 39-kilodalton protein (p39). Tyrosine phosphorylation of p39 was triggered by the NMDA receptor and required an influx of Ca2+ from the extracellular medium. Because p39 was found to be highly related or identical to the microtubule-associated protein 2 kinase, the NMDA receptor signal may be processed by a sequential activation of protein kinases."

https://openalex.org/W1984785242,"THE human papillomaviruses (HPV) are associated specifically with epithelial lesions, ranging from benign warts to invasive carcinoma (for review, see refs 1, 2). The virus encodes three late proteins, which are produced only in terminally differentiating keratinocytes, two of which are structural components of the virion3. The third, E1–E4, is derived primarily from the E4 open reading frame, which represents a region of maximal divergence between different HPV types4,5. E1–E4 does not seem to be a component of the virus particle or to be needed for transformation in vitro6,7, but accumulates in the cytoplasm5,8–10, where in certain benign lesions it can comprise 20–30% of total cell protein4,10. We show here that expression of the HPV-16 E1–E4 protein in human keratinocytes (the natural host cell for HPV infection) results in the total collapse of the cytokeratin matrix. Tubulin and actin networks are unaffected by E1–E4, as are the nuclear lamins."
https://openalex.org/W1837535311,"Previously, we have identified two regions (A and B) of the endothelin-1 promoter that are important for the expression of this gene in cultured vascular endothelial cells. The cis-acting sequence in one of these regions (Region A) includes the core binding motif GATA, raising the possibility that this region of DNA mediates binding of a member of the GATA-binding protein family. In this report, we describe the use of polymerase chain reaction in conjunction with cDNA cloning to characterize the GATA-binding protein expressed in endothelial cells. The nucleotide sequence of endothelial cell cDNA clones is highly homologous to that of the chicken GATA-2 (NF-E1b) gene, indicating that our clones encode the human GATA-2 gene transcript. By RNA blot analysis, this gene is expressed in cultured cell lines derived from a number of different tissues. Transactivation experiments utilizing human GATA-2 eukaryotic expression vectors indicate that the GATA-2 protein interacts with the endothelin-1 GATA sequence to increase transcription of reporter genes in both BAEC and HeLa cells. These data provide the first evidence for a non-erythroid target gene regulated by GATA-2 and indicate that GATA-2 may have a more broad role in transcriptional regulation than the erythroid-specific GATA-1 protein."

https://openalex.org/W1617102100,"We present here the full-length cDNA sequence and genomic structure of the mouse homologue of the tumor-associated mucin, MUC1. This mucin (previously called polymorphic epithelial mucin) is present at the apical surface of most glandular epithelial cells. The mouse gene, Muc-1, encodes an integral membrane protein with 40% of its coding capacity made up of serine, threonine, and proline, a composition typical of a highly O-glycosylated protein. The mucin core protein consists of an amino-terminal signal sequence, a tandem repeat domain encoding 16 repeats of 20-21 amino acids, and unique sequence containing transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains. Homology with the human protein is only 34% in the tandem repeat domain, mainly showing conservation of serines and threonines, presumed sites of O-linked carbohydrate attachment. Homology rises to 87% in the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains, suggesting that these regions may be functionally important. The pattern of expression of the mouse mucin is very similar to that of its human counterpart and accordingly the two promoter regions share high homology, 74%, although previously identified potential hormone-responsive elements are not conserved. Interestingly, the mouse homologue, unlike its human counterpart does not exhibit a variable number tandem repeat polymorphism. We present evidence that suggests that the mouse gene was at one time polymorphic but has mutated away from this state."
https://openalex.org/W2133547207,"Phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns)-4- and -3-kinases, PtdIns(4)P-5-kinase, diacylglycerol (DAG) kinase, and PtdIns-phospholipase C were all detected in cytoskeletons of resting human platelets. The total cytoskeletal enzyme activities were greatly increased upon thrombin stimulation of the intact cells. Those reached a maximum after a 60-s stimulation for PtdIns(4)P-5-kinase and phospholipase C, while the other kinases appeared to be slightly delayed. Specific activities were stimulated from about 4-fold (PtdIns-3-kinase) to about 6-fold (PtdIns-4-kinase). Thrombin treatment also promoted a co-extraction of pp60c-src with the cytoskeletons and its disappearance from the Triton X-100 soluble fraction. These results suggest that stimulation of platelets by thrombin causes the association of enzymes responsible for lipid phosphorylation and hydrolysis with the cytoskeletons. This could occur at cytoskeleton anchoring points to the membranes."
https://openalex.org/W1520043991,"Several types of lipid-associating helices exist: transmembrane helices such as in receptor proteins, pore-forming helices in ion channel proteins, fusion-inducing peptides in viral proteins, and amphipathic helices such as in plasma apolipoproteins. In order to propose a classification of these helices according to their molecular properties, we introduce the concept of molecular hydrophobicity potential for such helical segments. The calculation of this parameter for alpha-helices enables the visualization of the hydrophobic and hydrophilic envelopes around the peptide and their three-dimensional representation by molecular graphics. We have used this parameter to differentiate between pore-forming helices with a hydrophobic envelope larger than the hydrophilic component, membrane-spanning helices surrounded almost entirely by an hydrophobic envelope, fusiogenic peptides with an hydrophobicity gradient both around the helix and along the axis, and finally, amphipathic helices with a predominantly hydrophilic envelope. The structure of the lipid-protein complexes is determined by a number of different interactions: the hydrophobic interaction of the apolar faces of the helices with lipids, the polar interaction of the hydrophilic sides of different helices with each other, and the interaction of hydrophilic residues with the aqueous solvent. The relative magnitude of the hydrophobic and hydrophilic envelopes accounts for the differences in the structure of the lipid-protein complexes. Purely hydrophobic interactions stabilize transmembrane helical segments, while hydrophobic interactions with the lipid phase and with each other are involved in the stabilization of the pore-forming helices. In contrast, both hydrophobic interactions with the lipids and hydrophilic interactions with the aqueous phase contribute to the arrangement of amphipathic helices around the edges of the discoidal lipid-apoprotein complexes."
https://openalex.org/W1581806217,"LIMP II is a glycoprotein expressed in the membrane of lysosomes and secretory granules with lysosomal properties. Sequence analysis of a CNBr-cleaved peptide allowed the synthesis of a 47-mer oligonucleotide that was used to screen a rat liver cDNA library in lambda gt11. This resulted in isolation of a 2-kilobase cDNA containing 1,434 bases encoding the entire protein. The deduced amino acid sequence indicates that LIMP II consists of 478 amino acid residues. The segment spanning residues 4-6 to 26 constitute an uncleavable signal peptide. LIMP II possesses a hydrophobic amino acid segment near the carboxyl end, that together with the uncleaved signal peptide may anchor the protein to the membrane through two distant segments. The major portion of the protein resides on the luminal side and displays 11 potential N-glycosylation sites and 5 cysteine residues. Two short cytoplasmic tails, 2-4 and 20-21 amino acids long, correspond to the NH2- and COOH-terminal ends of the protein, respectively. Transfection of COS cells with the cDNA of LIMP II resulted in expression of the protein and its transport to lysosomes. Comparison of the entire sequence to various data bases of known proteins revealed extensive homology between LIMP II and the cell surface protein CD36 involved in cell adhesion. No significant homology was detected with the two families of lysosomal membrane proteins A and B, recently described."
https://openalex.org/W1534088620,"The JAR human placental choriocarcinoma cell line transports serotonin, accumulating the monoamine inside the cell against a concentration gradient. The transport is energized by an NaCl gradient. Tricyclic (imipramine and desipramine) and non-tricyclic (paroxetine and fluoxetine) antidepressants inhibit the transporter markedly, but reserpine and 5-hydroxytryptophan do not. Ouabain, gramicidin, and nigericin, which reduce or abolish the transmembrane Na+ gradient, and phloridzin, which interferes with glucose transport into the cells, inhibit the transport. Preincubation of the cells with glucose-free medium also causes similar inhibition. The activity of the serotonin transporter in this cell line is stimulated in response to overnight (16-h) incubation with increasing concentrations of cholera toxin (0.1-1,000 ng/ml). Under these conditions the stimulation is maximal at 10 ng/ml cholera toxin (3.1 +/- 0.2-fold). Cholera toxin increases the cAMP content of these cells by several hundredfold within 2 h. Isobutylmethylxanthine (100 microM), dibutyryl cAMP (100 microM), and forskolin (100 microM) mimic the action of cholera toxin, eliciting a 1.6-2.5-fold stimulation of the serotonin transporter activity. The stimulatory effect of cholera toxin is antagonized significantly by simultaneous incubation of the cells with 50 microM N-(2-aminoethyl)-5-isoquinolinesulfonamide, a protein kinase inhibitor. The effect of cholera toxin on serotonin transport is specific because, under similar conditions, cholera toxin inhibits 3-O-methyl-D-glucose transport and does not influence taurine transport in this cell line. There is also no significant change in the protein content of the cells after cholera toxin treatment. Kinetic analysis reveals that cholera toxin causes an increase in the maximal velocity (7.89 +/- 0.67 to 17.55 +/- 1.06 pmol/mg of protein/5 min) and a decrease in the Michaelis-Menten constant (0.52 +/- 0.09 to 0.29 +/- 0.04 microM). These data show that the JAR human placental choriocarcinoma cell line expresses a high affinity serotonin transporter that is sensitive to inhibition by antidepressants and that the activity of the transporter is under cAMP-dependent regulation."
https://openalex.org/W1551857288,"Abstract Steroid 17 alpha-hydroxylase deficiency is caused by defects in cytochrome P450c17, the single enzyme that has 17-alpha hydroxylase and 17,20-lyase activities. We describe a rapid and efficient polymerase chain reaction tactic for identifying these genetic lesions and identify Ser106----Pro as the cause of 17 alpha-hydroxylase deficiency in two unrelated homozygous patients from Guam. We used site-directed mutagenesis of the normal P450c17 cDNA to construct the Pro106 mutant, and expressed both the normal and mutant sequences in monkey COS-1 cells and in yeast. Expression of the normal sequence permitted the cells to convert pregnenolone to 17-OH pregnenolone, progesterone to 17-OH progesterone, and 17-OH pregnenolone to dehydroepiandrosterone, showing the normal sequence conferred both 17 alpha-hydroxylase and 17,20-lyase activities. Expression of the mutant sequence generated P450c17 mRNA, but conferred none of these activities, proving that the Ser106----Pro mutation abolished the 17 alpha-hydroxylase and 17,20-lyase activities. An HhaI restriction site created by the mutation should permit screening of large populations."
https://openalex.org/W1602728552,"It has been shown recently that alpha-adrenergic agonists can stimulate atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) expression in ventricular cardiac myocytes; however, little is known about the intracellular signals mediating this activation. The present study focused on the potential roles of calcium-regulated kinases and calcium influx in the alpha-adrenergic stimulation of ANF gene expression in ventricular myocardial cell cultures. Myocardial cells maintained for 48 h in serum-free medium supplemented with phenylephrine (PE) possessed up to 15-fold higher levels of ANF peptide and ANF mRNA than control cells. The removal of PE, or the addition of nifedipine, resulted in a rapid decline in ANF expression, suggesting that the sustained elevation of some intracellular messenger (e.g. calcium and/or phospholipid hydrolysis products) was required for the adrenergic response. The calcium channel agonist BAY K 8644 was capable of increasing ANF expression in a nifedipine-sensitive manner; however, unlike PE, it did not stimulate phosphoinositide hydrolysis. The protein kinase C inhibitor, H7, caused an approximate 75% reduction in PE-stimulated ANF expression, but had no effect on BAY K-stimulated expression. W7, a calcium/calmodulin inhibitor, completely blocked the effects of both PE and BAY K 8644. The addition of either H7 or W7 24 h after the PE addition resulted in a decline of ANF expression. These results indicate that alpha-adrenergic agonists augment ANF gene expression through at least two pathways, one that is H7-sensitive, perhaps involving the sustained activation of protein kinase C, and the other that is W7-sensitive, perhaps involving the sustained activation of calmodulin-regulated kinases. Further, it appears that BAY K 8644-mediated increases in ANF expression are independent of protein kinase C activation and dependent on calmodulin-regulated events."
https://openalex.org/W1568607294,"We have isolated the gene from Saccharomyces cerevisiae encoding an alpha-mannosidase of unique specificity which catalyzes the removal of one mannose residue from Man9GlcNAc to produce a single isomer of Man8GlcNAc (Jelinek-Kelly, S., and Herscovics, A. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 14757-14763). Amino acid sequence information was obtained and corresponding degenerate oligonucleotide primers were synthesized for polymerase chain reactions on yeast genomic DNA. The labeled polymerase chain reaction products were used to screen a S. cerevisiae genomic library in YEp24, and positive clones of different lengths with similar restriction maps were isolated. A 4.6-kilobase fragment which hybridized with the probes was sequenced. It contained a 1650-base pair open reading frame encoding peptide sequences corresponding to the amino acid sequences of the purified alpha-mannosidase. The gene, designated MNS1, encodes a 549-amino acid polypeptide of calculated molecular size 63,017 Da produced by an mRNA species of approximately 1.7 kilobases. The protein possesses a putative noncleavable signal sequence near its N-terminal region which probably acts as a transmembrane domain. It has three potential N-glycosylation sites and a calcium-binding consensus sequence. Its amino acid sequence is homologous to the recently isolated cDNA from rabbit liver alpha-1,2 mannosidase which can transform Man9GlcNAc to Man5GlcNAc (Moremen, K. W., Schutzbach, J. S., Forsee, W. T., Neame, P., Bishoff, J., Lodish, H. F., and Robbins, P. W. (1990) Glycoconjugate J. 7, 401). Overexpression of the MNS1 gene caused an 8-10-fold increase in specific alpha-mannosidase activity. Disruption of the MNS1 gene resulted in undetectable specific alpha-mannosidase activity but no apparent effect on growth. These results demonstrate that MNS1 is the structural gene for the specific alpha-mannosidase and that its activity is not essential for viability."
https://openalex.org/W1603478517,"A cAMP response element (CRE) plays an important role in the cAMP-mediated gene regulation. Several factors that recognize a CRE have been characterized, and it has been shown that they need either covalent modification by protein kinase A or a cofactor such as the adenovirus Ela to function as an activator. In this study we show that the substance P precursor gene expression is regulated by protein kinase A and identify the CRE sequence in its promoter region. We find that a novel factor and ATF2 bind to the region containing the CRE of the substance P precursor gene. The sequence analysis indicates that the novel protein, designated CELF, has a significant homology to C/EBP gene family proteins in the carboxyl-terminal part containing the basic region and the leucine zipper motif. Ubiquitous expression of CELF suggests that this factor is utilized by various genes. Cell-free transcription analyses indicate that CELF is a constitutive transcriptional activator without apparent phosphorylation by protein kinase A. These results demonstrate that multiple factors are responsible for transcriptional control of the substance P precursor gene through the CRE region."
https://openalex.org/W1490634134,"Plasminogen-activator inhibitor type 2 (PAI-2) is a specific inhibitor of plasminogen activators that belongs to the serine protease inhibitor superfamily (SERPINS). PAI-2 exists in two molecular forms: an intracellular, non-glycosylated form and a secreted, glycosylated form. Like ovalbumin, PAI-2 contains an uncleaved internal secretion signal. By deletion analysis, we have mapped the secretion signal to two mildly hydrophobic regions near the NH2 terminus. We also show that both of these regions become more efficient translocation signals when their hydrophobicities are increased. The PAI-2 secretion signal provides a unique example of a signal that, by virtue of its poor efficiency, allows the synthesis of both an extracellular and an intracellular form of the protein."
https://openalex.org/W1582375853,"beta 1,4-Galactosyltransferase (GalTase) is present on the plasma membrane of many cell types in addition to its traditional location within the Golgi compartment. Recently, the GalTase gene has been shown to encode two proteins that are identical throughout their length except that one has an additional 13-amino acid extension in its amino-terminal cytoplasmic domain. We present evidence here suggesting that the longer GalTase protein, containing this unique 13-amino acid peptide, is preferentially targeted to the plasma membrane, and the shorter GalTase protein resides primarily within the Golgi compartment. S1 nuclease protection assays of RNA from a variety of cells and tissues show that the relative abundance of the short and long GalTase mRNAs correlates with GalTase-specific activities in the Golgi and plasma membranes, respectively. Furthermore, transfection of cDNAs encoding either the long or short GalTase protein into F9 embryonal carcinoma cells suggests that the long GalTase protein is preferentially expressed on the cell surface. These results propose a molecular distinction between the Golgi and cell surface forms of GalTase as well as a novel mechanism for targeting glycoproteins to the cell surface."
https://openalex.org/W1608887613,"3-alpha-Hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3 alpha-HSD) (EC 1.1.1.50) is an important multifunctional oxidoreductase capable of metabolizing steroid hormones, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and prostaglandins. 3 alpha-HSD is also required for bile acid synthesis and has been suggested to play an important role in net bile acid transport across the hepatocyte (Stolz, A., Takikawa, H., Ookhtens, M., and Kaplowitz, N. (1989) Annu. Rev. Physiol. 51, 166-177). In order to characterize molecular forms and begin to determine its regulation, we now report the nucleotide sequence, tissue distribution, and homology to other members of the oxidoreductase superfamily. Rat hepatic 3 alpha-HSD cDNA encodes for a 322-amino acid protein with a predicted molecular weight of 37,022 expressed in a 2.4-kilobase (kb) message size. Northern blot analysis of total RNA revealed equivalent steady-state levels in liver and intestine in male rats with lower levels of expression in the colon and minimal expression in stomach, lung, and testis. Female liver contained approximately 2-3-fold greater steady-state levels of mRNA as compared to the male liver with equivalent intestinal expression. Two hybridizing bands, 2.4 and 1.4 kb, were identified in total RNA from the ovary. 3 alpha-HSD exhibits 75% amino acid sequence homology with bovine lung prostaglandin F synthetase and 50% homology with human aldose reductases. Amino acid sequence analysis with short chain alcohol dehydrogenases identified a possible NADP(H) cofactor-binding site at the amino terminus. The significant homology of 3 alpha-HSD with both prostaglandin F synthetase and aldose reductases suggest a subdivision of monomeric, NADPH reductases within the larger oxidoreductases superfamily."
https://openalex.org/W1482566978,"gp49 is a Mr 49,000 glycoprotein expressed on the surface of mouse bone marrow-derived mast cells, which are progenitors for the major in vivo mast cell subclasses, typified by intestinal mucosal mast cells and serosal mast cells. The amino-terminal amino acid sequence of gp49 was determined after isolation of the solubilized membrane protein by affinity chromatography with the B23.1 anti-gp49 monoclonal antibody. Redundant oligonucleotides were used to isolate a full-length 1.3-kilobase cDNA from a mouse mast cell library. The predicted amino acid sequence contains a signal peptide of 23 residues, an extracellular domain of 215 residues with three potential sites of N-linked glycosylation, a transmembrane domain of 23 residues, and a cytoplasmic tail of 42 residues. Hybridization of the gp49 cDNA was limited to mRNA extracted from those cell types that also bound the B23.1 monoclonal antibody as assessed by cytofluorographic analyses. The predicted extracellular domain of gp49 contains two regions of 48 and 51 amino acids, each flanked by cysteine residues. Both regions meet criteria for being C2-type domains of the immunoglobulin superfamily based upon the alignment of consensus amino acids and their predicted secondary structure organization. Thus, gp49, a membrane glycoprotein preferentially expressed by the progenitor mast cell population, is a new member of the immunoglobulin superfamily."
https://openalex.org/W1507013396,"The interaction of fibrinogen with membrane glycoprotein GPIIb-IIIa regulates platelet aggregation. This ligand:integrin receptor interaction elicits conformational changes in GPIIb-IIIa as evidenced by the induction of ligand-induced binding sites which are recognized by antibodies that react selectively with the occupied receptor. The dynamic nature of these conformational changes is now demonstrated by the identification and characterization of a receptor-induced binding site (RIBS) elicited in fibrinogen bound to GPIIb-IIIa. A monoclonal antibody to fibrinogen, anti-Fg-RIBS-I, failed to bind to nonstimulated platelets in the presence or absence of fibrinogen. However, when platelets were stimulated with an agonist, the antibody reacted with platelet-bound fibrinogen even in the presence of a marked excess of unbound fibrinogen. A key element of the RIBS epitope has been precisely localized to residues 373-385 of the gamma chain of fibrinogen. Conformational elements also are important in defining the epitope. Fab fragments of the antibody inhibited platelet aggregation. As these fragments also inhibited fibrin polymerization, a commonality between these two diverse functions of fibrinogen in thrombus formation is indicated. In general, antibodies to RIBS and ligand-induced binding site provide unique probes for characterizing ligand:receptor interactions."

One cDNA was identified to encode the previously isolated tyrosine kinase c-lyn. Among the remaining clones, we have characterized a cDNA encoding a novel kinase which we have designated TIK. Sequence analysis of this cDNA indicates that the TIK enzyme lacks the features thought to be conserved among protein tyrosine kinases. Although isolated on the basis of its reactivity with the anti-phosphotyrosine antibody, the TIK enzyme was found to have only serine and threonine kinase activity. The amino-terminal portion of the TIK protein contains a cdc2 phosphorylation consensus sequence. Three mRNA transcripts derived from the TIK gene are detected in a variety of adult murine tissues."
https://openalex.org/W1533199958,"The ubiquitin (Ub)-conjugating enzyme E2(25K) catalyzes the synthesis of multi-Ub chains in which successive Ub units are linked by an isopeptide bond involving the epsilon-amino group of Lys-48 of Ubn, and the COOH-terminal Gly residue of Ubn+1 (Chen, Z., and Pickart, C. M. (1990) J. Biol. Chem., 265, 21835-21842). We now describe the polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based cloning of an E2(25K)-encoding cDNA from a bovine thymus library, using degenerate oligonucleotide primers based on the sequences of two E2(25K) peptides. The cDNA encodes a 200-residue protein whose sequence bears similarities of 66 and 59%, respectively, to the sequences of the Ub-conjugating enzymes encoded by the UBC1 and UBC4/UBC5 genes of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. These three yeast E2s play key roles in Ub-dependent proteolysis (Seufert, W., McGrath, J. P., and Jentsch, S. (1990) EMBO J. 9, 4535-4541). Comparison of the amino acid sequence of E2(25K) with other known E2 sequences strongly suggests that Cys-92, one of two E2(25K) Cys residues, forms the Ub thiol ester adduct that is an intermediate in E2-catalyzed multiubiquitination. The E2(25K)-encoding cDNA was overexpressed in Escherichia coli, and the recombinant E2(25K) protein was purified to electrophoretic homogeneity; enzymatic assays showed that its multiubiquitinating activity was quantitatively identical with that of the native protein. The availability of a cloned cDNA will allow us to assess the physiological role of E2(25K)."
https://openalex.org/W1523481867,"Abstract We have isolated a 5-kilobase pair fragment of genomic DNA containing the entire coding region for the Chlamydomonas reinhardtii gene encoding the copper-repressible Cyt c6. A region comprising 2.6 kilobase pairs contains the entire transcribed region plus 852 nucleotides upstream of the Cyt c6 transcription start site and 495 nucleotides downstream of the conserved C. reinhardtii polyadenylation signal. Comparison of the genomic sequence with the cDNA sequence (Merchant, S., and Bogorad, L. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 9062-9067) revealed that the coding region is interrupted by two introns, each of which is flanked by C. reinhardtii consensus intron/exon boundaries. Primer extension and S1 nuclease protection analyses identified the 5' border of the Cyt c6 mRNA at approximately 79 base pairs upstream from the initiator methionine. Analysis of the 5' upstream region reveals no significant similarity to sequences found in upstream regions of other copper-regulated genes. Time-course studies indicate that 1) the mature Cyt c6 mRNA has a half-life of approximately 45-60 min and is completely lost within 4 h, and 2) the primary, unspliced transcript has a half-life of approximately 10 min and is completely lost within 30 min after the addition of copper ions to copper-depleted cells. These results indicate that the response to copper occurs very rapidly upon elevation of extracellular copper levels. Although this gene is unresponsive to silver ions in vivo, in contrast to the yeast copper-responsive CUP1 gene (Furst, P., Hu, S., Hackett, R., and Hamer, D. (1988) Cell 55, 705-717), it does respond to mercury ions, albeit with less sensitivity. Mercury ions cannot, however, substitute for copper in allowing the accumulation of plastocyanin in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1518731697,"We examined the effects of bacterial lipopolysaccharide and several recombinant human cytokines (tumor necrosis factor alpha and granulocyte-, macrophage-, and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factors) on the expression of the genes for the phagocyte cytochrome b, an essential component of the superoxide-generating oxidase. In vitro treatment with lipopolysaccharide, tumor necrosis factor alpha, or macrophage- or granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factors increased the levels of transcripts for the cytochrome b heavy chain (gp91phox) 9- to 22-fold and transcripts for the light chain (p22phox) 2- to 5-fold in cultured human monocyte-derived macrophages. The same agents, except for macrophage colony-stimulating factor, induced the expression of the cytochrome b heavy chain gene 2- to 12-fold and light chain gene 2- to 6-fold in human granulocytes. The expression of the cytochrome b heavy and light chain genes was coordinated in both macrophages and neutrophils with regard to stimulus specificity and dose-response pattern. The time course for induction of the two genes was parallel in both cell types for all stimuli. The macrophage response to lipopolysaccharide occurred at least in part at the transcriptional level. These results show that a variety of physiological regulators modulate the coordinated expression of the cytochrome b genes."
https://openalex.org/W1512993120,"Time course experiments of the localization of rat LIMP II expressed in COS cells show that the protein is transported directly from the Golgi complex to lysosomes. Substitution of the tyrosine-lacking carboxyl cytoplasmic tail of LIMP II for the native cytoplasmic tails of the plasma membrane proteins CD36 and CD8 resulted in straight transport of both proteins to lysosomes. The synthetic tyrosine-containing heptapeptide, RGTGVYG, did not replace the natural carboxyl cytoplasmic tail of LIMP II in its ability to transport both CD36 and CD8 to lysosomes, and the two constructs were transported to and expressed at the plasma membrane. Substitution of the cytoplasmic tails of either CD36 or CD8 for the carboxyl cytoplasmic tail of LIMP II resulted in transport of the mutants to the plasma membrane where they underwent endocytosis before accumulating into lysosomes. The results indicate that a motif contained in the tyrosine-lacking carboxyl cytoplasmic tail of LIMP II is sufficient to target proteins directly from the Golgi complex to lysosomes."
https://openalex.org/W1607743246,"Long tandem arrays of a characteristic leucine-rich repeat motif on the order of 24 amino acids in length have been found in the primary structure of an increasing number of proteins. The most striking feature of these repeats is an amphipathic sequence, with leucine as the predominant hydrophobic residue. Based on this amphipathic sequence and the function of the proteins in which they have been found, the repeats have been proposed to be involved in protein-protein and protein-lipid interactions. As a step toward elucidating the structure and biochemical properties of the leucine-rich repeat motif, we have studied a synthetic leucine-rich repeat peptide (LRP32) representing one of the repeats found in Drosophila chaoptin. We have shown that: (i) LRP32 is soluble in aqueous solution but will bind quantitatively to phospholipid vesicles; (ii) LRP32 has a partial beta structure in aqueous solution and is predominantly a beta structure in the presence of phospholipid; (iii) LRP32 integrates into lipid bilayers to form 60-A intramembrane particles as seen using freeze-fracture electron microscopy (these putative oligomeric structures appear to contain a central aqueous core as indicated by their ability to generate conductances in planar lipid bilayers); and (iv) LRP32-lipid complexes generate 2H NMR spectra characteristic of integral membrane proteins. This study is consistent with LRP32 forming an amphipathic beta sheet. We propose that protein segments containing tandem arrays of leucine-rich repeats also may form amphipathic beta sheets."
https://openalex.org/W1893276438,"The human epithelial mucin which is the product of the MUC1 gene is expressed by many carcinomas, including those of breast, ovary, colon, and lung. The core protein is aberrantly glycosylated in the tumors resulting in the exposure or appearance of novel epitopes. To examine the possibility of using the MUC1 gene and its products in active immunization against breast and other carcinomas, we have developed a syngeneic mouse model, by transfecting the gene into the mouse mammary epithelial tumor cell 410.4. An 8.3-kilobase EcoRI fragment of the gene was transfected using the expression vector pEMSV scribe alpha 2. Transcripts of the correct size, initiating from the transcriptional start site seen in human cells, were observed in the transfectants. The mucin was expressed in the cytoplasm and in the membrane, and the glycosylation pattern appeared to be similar to that seen in human tumor cells, since the core protein epitopes recognized by antibodies HMFG-1, HMFG-2, and SM-3 were exposed. The 410.4 transfectants expressing the human mucin showed a reduction in tumor incidence at low inocula and a delay in tumor growth at higher inocula. Pretreatment with 10(4) transfected cells could inhibit the development of tumors from a subsequent inoculum of 10(6) transfectants, but had no effect on the tumor development of the untransfected 410.4 cells. Our results suggest that the human mucin expressed by the 410.4 cells may mobilize an immune response which inhibits tumor development. They also indicate that the mouse model will be useful for evaluation of efficacy of immunogens based on the MUC1 gene and its product."
https://openalex.org/W1562198848,"A 32P-labeled protein that co-purified with acidic fibroblast growth factor (aFGF) receptor from bovine liver proved to be a distinct membrane protein, which itself has kinase activity that is stimulated by aFGF. The protein was designated MAFP for major aFGF-stimulated phosphoprotein. MAFP was purified from bovine liver using immunoaffinity chromatography with monoclonal antibody to MAFP following Triton X-100 extraction of plasma membranes and wheat germ lectin-Sepharose 4B column chromatography. The purified MAFP showed molecular masses of 130 kDa and 260 kDa on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under reducing and nonreducing conditions, respectively. Purified MAFP elicited aFGF-stimulated Thr-specific autophosphorylation activity and phosphorylation activity toward protein substrates (myelin basic protein and histone). Amino acid sequence analyses of 16 peptide fragments of MAFP, produced by endoproteinase Lys-C digestion followed by reduction and S-pyridylethylation, showed approximately 80-100% homology with the cDNA-deduced amino acid sequences of human and mouse plasma cell membrane glycoprotein, PC-1 (Buckley, M. F., Loveland, K. A., McKinstry, W. J., Garson, O. M., and Goding, J. W. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 17506-17511), suggesting that MAFP is the bovine version of PC-1. The amino acid sequences of bovine MAFP, human and mouse PC-1 reveal a putative ATP binding site in their extracellular domains. These results suggest that MAFP(PC-1) is an ectoprotein kinase. In addition to the kinase activity, MAFP(PC-1) was also found to possess alkaline nucleotide phosphodiesterase activity. It is now clear that several of the unique properties previously attributed to the aFGF receptor kinase are actually properties of this novel Thr-specific ectoprotein kinase, which co-purifies with the aFGF receptor and is responsive to stimulation by aFGF."
https://openalex.org/W1572259338,"The human neurotropic virus JCV contains a 98-base pair repeat enhancer/promoter sequence that confers glial-specific transcription to the viral early and late promoters. The central region of this repeat, designated the B-domain, binds to a glial-derived nuclear protein that stimulates transcription of the viral promotor in vitro. We now report the isolation of a recombinant cDNA clone, termed glial factor-1 (GF1), from a brain expression library that encodes a novel protein which interacts with the JCV B-domain. Results from RNA studies indicate that the GF1 transcript is more abundant in brain than in other tissues and that the level of GF1 RNAs increases progressively during brain development. Cotransfection of the recombinant GF1 expressor plasmid with JCV promoters indicates that GF1 stimulates transcription of the JCV late promoter and to a lesser extent the JCV early promoter predominantly in cells of human glial origin. Thus, GF1 is a sequence-specific DNA binding protein that may play a role in determining the glial-specific expression of JCV."
https://openalex.org/W1603974049,"The T cell receptor (TCR) is a molecular complex formed by at least seven transmembrane proteins: the antigen/major histocompatibility complex recognition unit (Ti alpha-beta heterodimer) and the invariant CD3 chains (gamma, delta, epsilon, zeta, and eta). In addition to targeting partially assembled Ti alpha-beta CD3 gamma delta epsilon TCR complexes to the cell surface, CD3 zeta appears to be essential for interleukin-2 production after TCR stimulation with antigen/major histocompatibility complex. The gamma chain of the high affinity Fc receptor for IgE (Fc epsilon RI gamma) has significant structural homology to CD3 zeta and the related CD3 eta subunit. To identify the functional significance of sequence homologies between CD3 zeta and Fc epsilon RI gamma in T cells, we have transfected a Fc epsilon RI gamma cDNA into a T cell hybridoma lacking CD3 zeta and CD3 eta proteins. Herein we show that a Fc epsilon RI gamma-gamma homodimer associates with TCR components to up-regulate TCR surface expression. A TCR composed of Ti alpha-beta CD3 gamma delta epsilon Fc epsilon RI gamma-gamma is sufficient to restore the coupling of TCR antigen recognition to the interleukin-2 induction pathway, demonstrating the functional significance of structural homology between the above receptor subunits. These results, in conjunction with the recent finding that CD3 zeta, CD3 eta, and Fc epsilon RI gamma are coexpressed in certain T cells as subunits of an unusual TCR isoform, suggest that Fc epsilon RI gamma is likely to play a role in T cell lineage function."
https://openalex.org/W1587087239,"Cellular retinaldehyde-binding protein (CRALBP) carries 11-cis-retinol or 11-cis-retinaldehyde as endogenous ligands and may function as a substrate carrier protein that modulates interaction of these retinoids with visual cycle enzymes. As a first approach to identifying functional domains and protein recognition sites in CRALBP, a low resolution topological and epitope map has been developed using monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies and limited proteolysis. Fifteen peptides of 8-31 residues spanning 99% of the 316-residue bovine CRALBP were synthesized and used to prepare 13 anti-peptide polyclonal antibodies. Using a competitive ELISA procedure, peptide epitopes were classified as either accessible or inaccessible in the native protein based on the extent of their recognition by these site-specific antibodies. Use of the synthetic peptides to map the epitopes of a polyclonal antibody to intact CRALBP confirmed that the amino terminus and carboxyl terminus are immunodominate regions and hence likely to be exposed, at least in part. Limited tryptic proteolysis of native CRALBP produced three major fragments which were shown by microsequence and Western analysis to be derived from sequential loss of short peptides from the amino terminus. None of these major fragments reacted with four monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to intact CRALBP although each mAb immunoprecipitated native CRALBP. These results and the lack of mAb recognition of any of the synthetic peptides indicates that the amino terminus of the protein is exposed and contains part of an assembly epitope recognized by the mAbs. Overall this study indicates that residues 1-30, 100-124, and 257-285 contain highly exposed segments in the native protein and therefore constitute potential interaction domains for CRALBP and visual cycle enzymes. Residues 30-99 and 176-229 are inaccessible in the native structure and may be involved with retinoid binding. These results provide a basis for a systematic higher resolution mutagenesis study directed toward correlating CRALBP structural domains with function."
https://openalex.org/W1502124563,"Abstract Of 14 identified epitopes on human GCase (acid beta-glucosidase), monoclonal antibodies (MCABs) recognizing 3 produced inhibition and 1 resulted in activation of GCase. MCABs F1 and F2 completely, and MCAB 61 partially (approximately 70%), inhibited GCase activity. Substrates and active site-directed inhibitors (specific sphingolipid and 5-amino-5-deoxyglucose derivatives) protected the enzyme from inhibition by MCAB F1 and F2, but not that by MCAB 61. Conduritol B epoxide did not protect GCase from the inhibition by these MCABs when covalently bound to the active site. These results indicated highly specific binding requirements of MCABs F1 and F2 for residues in a complex active site. In comparison, kinetic analyses using GCase transition state analogues, N-alkyl-glucosylamines, and MCAB 61 demonstrated that this MCAB freezes the conformation of the enzyme and inhibits GCase by preventing formation of a conformer needed for maximal catalytic rates. The activating MCAB 122 mimicked the effects of saposin C and competed with this natural activator for residues on the enzyme. Interaction of saposin A and saposin C or MCAB 122 with GCase produced a synergistic effect leading to a marked sensitization of the enzyme to these activators. No such synergism or additivity was found for the maximal catalytic rate since it could be achieved by saturating amounts of any one or combinations of these activators. In the presence of MCAB 61, only 15 to 25% of the maximal activation of GCase was obtained by saposin C or MCAB 122, indicating that the major activation effects of these effectors derived from an induction of a GCase conformational change. These results demonstrate that saposins A and C mediate their activating effects by binding to distinct sites on GCase. Furthermore, major components of the mechanisms for catalysis and saposin C activation are due to conformational changes during the transition state. These findings have implications for understanding the perturbations of GCase function due to the missense mutations which cause Gaucher disease."
https://openalex.org/W1513225799,"Abstract In an HL-60 cell subline (PR-17) which was greater than 100-fold resistant to the differentiating and cytostatic activities of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), the protein kinase C phenotype was found to be nearly identical to that of wild-type HL-60 cells. A measurable decrease (30%) in the specific activities of crude preparations of PR-17 cell protein kinase C was observed when the enzyme was measured with histone as the phosphate acceptor substrate, but other aspects of the protein kinase C phenotype (intracellular concentrations and binding affinities of phorbol diester receptors, translocation of activated enzyme from cytosolic to particulate subcellular fractions, relative expression of the alpha and beta isozyme proteins) were equivalent in both PMA-resistant PR-17 cells and in wild-type HL-60 cells. Direct analysis of the behavior of the alpha and beta isozymes after the exposure of each cell type to 100 nM PMA for 12 h revealed that the activities and intracellular concentrations of both isozymes were downregulated to an equivalent extent in both wild-type and PMA-resistant cells. These results suggest that the cellular basis for the resistance to the effects of PMA was present down-stream from the activation and down-regulation of protein kinase C and was perhaps a nuclear component. Among the genes which were likely to be differentially regulated when each of the two cell lines were treated with PMA were those for the protein kinase C isozymes themselves. In wild-type HL-60 cells, the intracellular concentrations of type HL-60 cells, the intracellular concentrations of mRNA for each of the beta isozymes were increased (up to 5-fold) 48 h after the initiation of PMA treatment; further studies indicate that an activator of protein kinase C could influence the expression of HL-60 cell protein kinase C genes in an isozyme-specific manner. Comparable PMA-induced alterations in mRNA levels were not observed in PMA-resistant cells, even under conditions of significant activation and subsequent down-regulation of protein kinase C protein. Taken together, these data suggest that activation and down-regulation of the isozymes of protein kinase C may not represent absolute determinants of the PMA-induced differentiation of HL-60 cells, but that specific alterations in the levels of the mRNA for the beta isozymes of protein kinase C, or of other genes which may be regulated by the activated kinase isozymes, are important to the induction of leukemia cell differentiation by PMA."
https://openalex.org/W1486333932,"Protein HC, an extremely charge-heterogeneous lipocalin, carries a yellow-brown fluorescent chromophore of unknown structure covalently bound at an unidentified site of its polypeptide chain. Two chromophore-carrying peptides with 60% of the chromophore material (defined as material absorbing light at 330 nm) were isolated from pepsin-digested native human protein HC by reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography. Sequence analysis of these peptides indicated that the chromophore was bound to the cysteine residue at position 34 of the protein HC polypeptide chain. Sequence analysis of a native chromophore-tripeptide complex, isolated from pronase digests of the pepsin-produced peptides, identified the sequence Thr33-X34-Pro35, corroborating the position of the chromophore linkage. Quantitative amino acid analysis of the hydrolyzed, performic acid-oxidized, chromophore-tripeptide complex demonstrated approximately equal amounts of threonine, cysteic acid, and proline in the complex. Reduction and carboxymethylation of the native chromophore-tripeptide complex did not remove the chromophore from the peptide. The absorption spectrum of the chromophore-tripeptide complex was similar to that of native protein HC, implying that all of the heterogeneity of protein HC resides in its chromophore."
https://openalex.org/W1602525846,"S-antigen (S-Ag) is an abundant protein of the retina and pineal gland that elicits experimental autoimmune uveitis and pinealocytis in several animal species. To study the elements regulating the expression of S-Ag, we generated transgenic mice expressing the chloramphenicol acetyl transferase (CAT) gene under the control of a 1.3-kilobase pair 5'-flanking segment of the mouse S-Ag gene. While all of the transgenic mice expressed CAT activity in the retina, in some animals CAT activity was also detected in the pineal gland, lens, and brain. Immunoblotting, polymerase chain reaction-mediated detection of RNA, and immunocyto-staining of transgenic tissues with antibodies to CAT and S-Ag established that the profile of expression of the transgene corresponded to that of S-Ag; both proteins were detectable in retinal photoreceptor cells, pinealocytes, lens fiber and epithelial cells, the cerebellum, and the cerebral cortex. These results indicate that S-Ag is expressed in a wider spectrum of the cell types than previously recognized and that a 1.3-kilobase pair S-Ag promoter segment contains sufficient information to direct appropriate tissue-specific gene expression in transgenic mice."
https://openalex.org/W1499483219,"We have isolated and characterized cDNA and genomic DNA clones which encode an alpha 2(IV) collagen chain from the parasitic nematode Ascaris suum. In addition we have determined, by nucleic acid sequence analysis, the structural organization of approximately two-thirds of the gene. This analysis has shown that the gene contains at least 15 introns, and those that have been characterized range in size from 141 to 854 base pairs. The derived protein sequence contains 1763 amino acids and includes a putative 26-amino acid signal sequence. The collagenous triple-helical region contains 17 interruptions, many of which occur in the same positions as those in the human alpha 1(IV) and alpha 2(IV) chains. Comparison of the genomic DNA sequence with the cDNA sequence has revealed the presence of a sequence within the gene which appears to be an intact and normal exon that is not represented in our cDNA sequence. The presence of this putative exon raises the possibility that the A. suum alpha 2(IV) collagen gene may undergo alternative splicing."
https://openalex.org/W1570967829,"Dihydropyridine-sensitive Ca2+ channels from skeletal muscle are hetero-oligomeric proteins. Little is known about the functional roles of the various subunits, except that the alpha 1 subunit is the essential channel unit. We have reconstituted both partially purified holomeric channels and the separated subunits into liposomes and measured their properties using an assay based on the Ca2+ indicator dye fluo-3. The holomeric channels exhibited Ca2+ influx that was sensitive to membrane potential achieved by the addition of valinomycin in the presence of a K+ gradient. Dissipation of the K+ gradient resulted in the loss of the valinomycin-sensitive Ca2+ flux. In addition, the reconstituted channels were: 1) activated by the dihydropyridine Ca2+ channel activator Bay K 8644 in a dose-dependent manner with a Kd of 20 nM; 2) inhibited by various types of Ca2+ channel inhibitors including the dihydropyridine (+)-PN 200-110, the phenylalkylamine verapamil, and the benzothiazepine d-cis-diltiazem; and 3) modulated in a stereoselective manner by the enantiomers of the dihydropyridine S-202-791. The purified channels used in this work possessed an alpha 1 subunit of 165 kDa and did not appear to contain a larger alpha 1 subunit of approximately 210 kDa, suggesting that channel activity with properties similar to those observed in intact cells can be supported with an alpha 1 subunit of 165 kDa. Reconstituted channels that were 85% depleted in the alpha 2/delta subunits showed a significant decrease in the initial rate of Ca2+ influx induced by valinomycin, but retained responsiveness to Bay K 8644 and (+)-PN 200-110. When the separated alpha 2 and delta subunits were added back to the alpha 1 subunit-containing preparation, the channels exhibited their normal rate of Ca2+ influx. These results demonstrated that the dihydropyridine-sensitive Ca2+ channels from skeletal muscle require the presence of the alpha 2.gamma complex in stoichiometric amounts to exhibit full activity."
https://openalex.org/W1607536114,"Protein C inhibitor (plasminogen activator inhibitor-3) is a plasma glycoprotein and a member of the serine proteinase inhibitor superfamily. In the present study, the human gene for protein C inhibitor was isolated and characterized from three independent phage that contained overlapping inserts coding for the entire gene. The genomic DNA was isolated and studied by restriction mapping, polymerase chain reaction analysis, and DNA sequencing. The gene was 11.5 kilobases in length and consisted of five exons separated by four introns. In addition, 0.8 kilobases of DNA from the 5'-flanking region were sequenced. The exon-intron boundaries all observed the GT-AG rule. The gene for protein C inhibitor was assigned to chromosome 14 by polymerase chain reaction analysis of human/hamster hybrid cell lines. The organization of the gene for protein C inhibitor is similar to the genes coding for alpha 1-antitrypsin and alpha 1-antichymotrypsin. The genes for these two proteins are also localized on chromosome 14 suggesting a recent evolution of the genes for these three proteins from a common ancestor."
https://openalex.org/W2172168929,"During a search for possible cyclization points in shortened, potent bombesin agonists and antagonists, it was found that the joining of amino acid residues in positions 6 and 14 by various means resulted in retention of significant binding affinity for rat pancreatic acini and murine Swiss 3T3 cells. In one series of analogues, Cys residues in these positions were used for bridging via a disulfide bond. (D)-C-Q-W-A-V-G-H-L-C-NH2 retained significant binding affinity for rat pancreatic acini cells and was a full amylase releasing agonist (EC50 187 nM). Potency was markedly increased by substituting D-Ala for Gly (EC50 67 nM compared to 10 nM for its linear counterpart) and was decreased by substituting L-Cys for D-Cys in this analogue (EC50 214 nM), thus strongly suggesting stabilization of peptide folding by the D residues. Elimination of the COOH-terminal amino acid produces competitive antagonists in the linear analogues; however, (D)-C-Q-W-A-V-G-H-C-NH2 was devoid of activity. Likewise, cyclization to position 13 with the 14 amino acids intact to give (D)-C-Q-W-A-V-G-H-C-L-NH2 resulted in an almost inactive peptide. On the other hand, as in the linear series, the reduced peptide bond analogue, (D)-C-Q-W-A-V-(D)-A-H-L-psi (CH2NH)-C-NH2, was a receptor antagonist (IC50 5.7 mM), albeit much weaker than the corresponding linear analogues, but with no residual agonist activity. Direct head-to-tail cyclization was also tried. Both cyclo[(D)-F-Q-W-A-V-G-H-L-L] (EC50 346 nM) and the shorter cyclo [Q-W-A-V-G-H-L-L] (EC50 1236 nM) were full agonists. Elimination of the COOH-terminal residue in cyclo[(D)-p-Cl-F-Q-W-A-V-(D)-A-H-L] produced an agonist (EC50 716 nM) rather than an antagonist. These results provide support for the proposal that both bombesin agonists and antagonists adopt a folded conformation at their receptor(s). Furthermore, the retention of appreciable potencies using several cyclization strategies and chain lengths suggests that further optimization of these structures both in terms of potency and ring size is possible. Since these peptides have increased conformational restriction, they should begin to serve as useful substrates for NMR and molecular modeling studies aimed at comparing the obviously subtle differences between agonist and antagonist structures."
https://openalex.org/W1658447938,"Previous work suggests that noncompetitive inhibitor (NCI) ligands and channel permeant cations bind to sites within the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor ion channel. We have used ethidium as a fluorescent probe of the NCI site to investigate interactions between NCI ligands and channel permeant cations. We found that ethidium can be completely displaced from the receptor by a variety of inorganic monovalent and divalent cations. The rank order of monovalent cation affinities was found to be Tl+ greater than Rb+ greater than or equal to K+ greater than Cs+ greater than Na+ greater than Li+. The monovalent cation Kd values vary markedly over a 40-fold range, from 3 to 121 mM. The Kd values and rank order correspond to values determined previously from electrophysiological data. Hill plots of the back titrations yield slopes of 1.0 for all monovalent cations, indicating a single class of independent sites, as shown previously for NCI ligands. Scatchard analysis of ethidium binding in the presence of Tl+ reveals a reduction in affinity and no changes in the maximal number of sites. In the presence of agonist the kinetics of ethidium dissociation induced by the addition of phencyclidine or cations alone or the simultaneous addition of both are nearly identical. The ethidium dissociation rate induced by either phencyclidine or cations is regulated by the occupation of the agonist sites in a similar manner. These results indicate that the effect of cations on NCI ligand binding occurs by mutually exclusive competition. We suggest that NCIs can regulate cation binding at a physiological cation recognition site that is likely part of the cation permeation path through the receptor channel."
https://openalex.org/W1523745985,"The protein-tyrosine kinase (PTK) v-Fps induces protein kinase C (PKC)-dependent expression of the transformation-related 9E3 gene in chicken embryo fibroblasts (Spangler, R., Joseph, C., Qureshi, S.A., Berg, K., and Foster, D.A. (1989) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 86, 7017-7021). We present evidence here that a GTP-binding protein (G-protein) is a component of this PKC-dependent signaling pathway. 1) A GTP analogue that stimulates G-protein-mediated signals induced 9E3 gene expression. 2) A GDP analogue that inhibits signaling through G-proteins inhibited expression of 9E3 and phosphorylation of a 67-kDa PKC substrate induced by v-Fps. The GDP analogue had no effect on phosphorylation of the PKC substrate or the expression of 9E3 induced by direct activation of PKC with phorbol ester. 3) Increased v-Fps PTK activity led to increased GTP binding to a 50-kDa protein. The molecular weight of this GTP-binding protein is consistent with the molecular weight of alpha-subunits of G-proteins of the heterotrimeric class. The data suggest that a G-protein functions upstream from PKC in a signaling pathway that connects v-Fps PTK activity to increased 9E3 gene expression."
