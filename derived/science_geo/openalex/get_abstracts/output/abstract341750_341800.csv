Pyrite is the major end product of sulfate reduction, and sulfate reduction is the major form of respiration in the salt-marsh ecosystem. When the rapid formation of pyrite is ignored, the rates of sulfate reduction and ecosystem respiration may be grossly underestimated."

Unlike Eucidaris in Panama and mainland Ecuador, Galápagos Eucidaris are large and abundant and graze heavily in the open on live corals day and night. These differences are probably due in large part to more intense predation by fishes on mainland compared with island urchin populations. An assessment of coral growth versus coral attrition from grazing shows that Eucidaris interferes with the establishment of pocilloporid reef frame and therefore reduces reef growth in the Galápagos."

This roughness decreases slightly with position along the ground track, south to north. The dielectric constant in this area appears to be approximately 3.1, greater than the martian average. These values are characteristic of lunar maria and are similar to those found near the Viking lander site in Chryse with the use of Earth-based radar."

https://openalex.org/W2157365456,"A new, noncontact, optical technique for measurement of movements smaller than a few micrometers has been used to record cuticular motion of insects as they produce sound. The instrument described is highly sensitive to surface movement and offers good spatial resolution, broad dynamic range, tolerance of substantial background motion of the target surface, portability, and simplicity, and as such appears to hold promise for measuring other biologically interesting motions that have proved difficult to measure by other available techniques."

https://openalex.org/W2074438405,"Abstract Clubbing of the fingers and toes, and the more severe “pulmonary” osteoarthropathies and periostitides, occur when there is arterial anoxia due to congenital or acquired lesions or residence at high altitude. It occurs in many disorders in which the erythrocyte sedimentation rate is rapid, but arterial oxygen saturation normal. In all these cases the vascular bed is wide, blood flow rapid, and the tissue warmer than normal. That rapid sedimentation rates, with intravascular rouleaux formation, interfered with oxygenation of the tissues by decreasing the diffusion surface per unit of hemoglobin had long ago been suggested by Fahraeus. In this review it is suggested that with escape of rouleaux through the arteriovenous anastomoses so numerous in the fingers and toes, rapid blood flow and high levels of arterial and venous oxygen saturation may be present simultaneously with low oxygen tension in the digital tissues. Thus, rapid rates of blood flow and low tissue oxygen tension would provide the same mechanism for clubbing in chronic infections, neoplasms, or metabolic defects leading to abnormal fibrinogen and globulin levels, as in the classical cases of arterial anoxia. The most rapidly evolving and the most severe types of osteoarthropathy are seen in cases of mediastinal and lung tumors where the sedimentation rates are rapid and arterial anoxia is present. Here the two types of anoxia may coexist. In rheumatoid arthritis, in Raynaud's disease, and in Buerger's disease clubbing is rare, although tissue anoxia is severe in the latter two and rapid sedimentation rates are characteristic of the former. But in all of these, blood flow and tissue temperatures are low in the tips of the extremities. It is thereby concluded that for the development of clubbing low oxygen tensions must occur in tissues which are warm and in which the blood flow is greater than normal."
