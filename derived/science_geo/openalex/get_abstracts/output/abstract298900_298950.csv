https://openalex.org/W2067391933,"Maya Blue, a pigment used by the Mayas in Yucatan, is remarkably stable: the color is not destroyed by hot concentrated mineral acids or by heating to about 250 degrees C. The principal constituent is the colorless mineral attapulgite. It is proposed that the pigment is an adsorption complex of attapulgite and natural indigo; a synthetic equivalent may be prepared from attapulgite and either indoxylester or indigo, or by applying the vat-dyeing technique, with reduced indigo.The low dye content of the pigment (less than 0.5 percent) indicates that the dye is absorbed only on the external surfaces of the attapulgite particles and not throughout the channels in their structures. The complex as such is not stable to acids, but the stability displayed by Maya Blue is achieved simply by heating the complex to from 75 degrees to 150 degrees C for several days. An analogous stable pigment can be prepared from sepiolite and indigo. No stable pigments could be prepared from clays with platelike structures or from zeolites."

Carbon-13/carbon-12 isotopic mneasurements on these fractions gave the following values relative to a marine carbonate standard: carbonate, +40 to +70 per mil; residual carbon, -15 to -17 per mil; soluble organic material, -17 to -27 per mil, with one value of -5.5 per mil. These values are interpreted to indicate that carbonate, residual carbon, and part of the extractable organic material are endogenous to these meteorites."

Furthermore, there are discrepancies between the ring spectrum and ammonia frost spectra in the 2- to 2.5-Î¼ region. These discrepancies render unlikely a reported identification of ammonia frost in the ring spectrum."

The Fe-Mn ratio varies widely among the various oxide rocks deposited at this locality and at another seamount in the same area. The deposit was probably formed by fractional precipitation of iron and manganese which had been introduced locally into the bottom water by hydrothermal solutions of volcanic origin, and by leaching from deep-sea basaltic lavas."

https://openalex.org/W2068961527,"Fiber-reinforced alloys have been prepared by the controlled dissociation of gold-nickel and aluminum-zinc solid solutions. To cause the dissociation, the alloys were taken from a one-phase field to a two-phase field by lowering the temperature. The new two-phase structure was in each case formed by diffusion controlled processes, and under certain conditions one of the new equilibrium phases appeared in the form of fibers, a few tenths of a micron in diameter, embedded in a matrix of the other. The precipitated phase first appeared in the form of spherical particles, but these aligned and then coalesced to form the fibers."
