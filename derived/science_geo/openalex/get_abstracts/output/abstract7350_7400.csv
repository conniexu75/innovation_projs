https://openalex.org/W2059655508,"If the host population is taken to be a dynamic variable (rather than constant, as conventionally assumed), a wider understanding of the population biology of infectious diseases emerges. In this first part of a two-part article, mathematical models are developed, shown to fit data from laboratory experiments, and used to explore the evolutionary relations among transmission parameters. In the second part of the article, to be published in next week's issue, the models are extended to include indirectly transmitted infections, and the general implications for infectious diseases are considered."

https://openalex.org/W2135248098,"Physiological stimulation of the hypothalamo-neurohypophysial system by salt loading of rats resulted in a dramatically increased glucose utilization in the posterior pituitary but not in the paraventricular or supraoptic nuclei. The good correlation between glucose utilization and neural activity in the posterior pituitary (that is, nerve terminals) contrasted with the lack of correlation in the paraventricular and supraoptic nuclei (that is, the sites of the cell bodies of the same neurons). This difference in the metabolic response to functional activity between the two regions of these neurons can be explained by the differences in surface-to-volume ratios of these regions."

https://openalex.org/W1976683491,"Following ligation of the right middle cerebral artery, rats were hyperactive for 2 to 3 weeks whether activity was measured by running wheel revolutions or open field observations. Assays of brain catecholamines revealed 30 percent reductions of norepinephrine in the injured and uninjured cortex and locus coeruleus and a 20 percent reduction of dopamine in the substantia nigra. In contrast, rats with left middle cerebral artery ligations did not become hyperactive and did not show any significant change in catecholamines in any of the brain areas studied. Right and left hemispheric infarctions were comparable in their locations and extent of tissue damage. This lateralization of behavioral and biochemical response to cerebral infarction may be the consequence of anatomical or physiological asymmetries in the brain."

Most of the ipsilateral projection retracts during the first ten postnatal days to produce the normal adult pattern, but retraction fails to occur if one eye is removed at birth."

https://openalex.org/W2139983563,"During development of the embryonic chick limb the skeletal pattern is laid out as cartilaginous primordia, which emerge in a proximodistal sequence over a period of 4 days. The differentiation of cartilage is preceded by changes in cellular contacts at specific locations in the precartilage mesenchyme. Under realistic assumptions, the biosynthesis and diffusion through the extracellular matrix of a cell surface protein, such as fibronectin, will lead to spatial patterns of this molecule that could be the basis of the emergent primordia. As cellular differentiation proceeds, the size of the mesenchymal diffusion chamber is reduced in descrete steps, leading to sequential reorganizations of the morphogen pattern. The successive patterns correspond to observed rows of skeletal elements, whose emergence, in theory and in practice, depends on the maintenance of a unique boundary condition at the limb bud apex."
https://openalex.org/W1979122053,"Menopausal flush episodes were found to be invariably associated with the initiation of pulsatile pituitary release of luteinizing hormone. This was not accompanied by a significant change in circulating catecholamine or prolactin concentrations. Since pulsatile luteinizing hormone release results from episodic secretion of luteinizing hormone releasing factor by the hypothalamus, these findings suggest a link between the neuroendocrine mechanisms that initiate such episodic secretion and those responsible for the onset of flush episodes."

https://openalex.org/W1585706956,"1alpha, 25-Dihydroxycholecalciferol (1,25-(OH)2D3), the active form of vitamin D, like other steroid hormones, initiates its action by binding to cytoplasmic receptors in target cells. Although the 1,25-(OH)2D3 receptor has been well studied in intestine, little information beyond sucrose gradient analyses is presently available from mammalian bone. We, therefore, employed primary cultures of mouse calvarial cells to characterize the mammalian receptor in bone. A hypertonic molybdate-containing buffer was found to protect receptor binding. On hypertonic sucrose gradients, the 1,25-(OH)2-[3H]D3 binder sedimented at 3.2 S. Scatchard analysis of specific 1,25-(OH)2[3H]D3 binding sites at 0 degrees C yielded an apparent Kd of 0.26 nM and an Nmax of 75 fmol/mg of cytosol protein. Competitive binding experiments revealed the receptor to prefer 1,25-(OH)2D3 greater than 25-(OH)-D3 = 1 alpha-(OH)-D3 greater than 24R,25-(OH)2D3; vitamin D3, dihydrotachysterol, sex steroids, and glucocorticoids exhibited negligible binding. As shown in other systems, the receptor could be distinguished from a 25-(OH)-[3H]D3 binder which sedimented at approximately 6 S. In summary, cultured mouse calvarial cells possess a macromolecule with receptor-like properties. This system appears to be an ideal model for the investigation of 1,25-(OH)2D3 receptor binding and action in mammalian bone."

Previous epidemics of Pontiac fever and Legionnaires' disease--both caused by Legionella Pneumophila (proposed sp. nov.)--involved ""airborne spread"" from air-conditioning cooling towers or evaporative condensers. Aerosols of contaminated water in heat-rejection systems appear to be important sources of epidemic legionellosis."

https://openalex.org/W1971192002,"Levy's hypothesis that movements of the distal musculature are controlled by ipsilateral motor projections in subjects with inverted writing posture was tested in a reaction-time experiment with lateralized auditory, tactual, and visual stimulation. Subjects were required to depress a response key with the left or right index finger when they detected a stimulus in either the left or right sensory field. Writers with noninverted posture responded quickest to stimuli on the same side as the responding hand in all modalities tested, whereas inverted writers showed this pattern only in auditory and tactual modalities. In the visual modality, they responded quickest to stimuli on the side opposite the responding hand. Because Levy's hypothesis predicts the latter effect in all modalities for inverted writers, it is challenged by our results, which suggest that inverted writers may be characterized by anomalous visual or visuomotor organization."

The dramatic reduction of alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone in the brain suggests that is primary source there is the neuronal perikarya of the arcuate nucleus."
https://openalex.org/W2083756774,"A ""recptor unit"" for gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), which includes brainlike receptor binding sites for tritium-labeled GABA and benzodiazepines (diazepam, clonazepam, and flunitrazepam) and a thermostable endogenous protein (GABA modulin) that inhibits both GABA and benzodiazepine binding, has been demonstrated in membranes prepared from NB2a neuroblastoma and C6 glioma clonal cell lines. In these cells, as in brain, diazepam (1 micromolar) prevents the effect of GABA modulin, and in turn GABA (0.oma and, to a lesser extent, the glioma cells represent a suitable model to study the interactions and the sequence of membrane and intracellular events triggered by the stimulation of benzodiazepine and GABA receptors."

https://openalex.org/W1970582995,"THIRST can be evoked within 1–2 min by intracarotid infusion of hypertonic NaCl. In contrast, the onset of a specific appetite for sodium salts as a result of rapid loss of body sodium is slow. A parotid fistula in naive sheep can produce a significant Na deficit (200–700 mmol) within 1–3 d but a Na appetite usually develops after 2–5 d (ref. 1). With large urinary water and Na loss induced by frusemide, water intake occurs within an hour but Na appetite is delayed until 24 h (ref. 2). Moreover, in the Na-depleted sheep or goats, increase in the Na concentration of cerebral arterial blood by 10–30 mmol l−1 by slow intracarotid infusion of 4 M NaCl for 7 min before or during presentation of Na solution does not reduce Na intake3,4. However, rapid intravenous infusion of significant amounts of isotonic and 2–4 M NaCl solutions in Na-deficient sheep substantially reduces Na appetite after 40–120 min5,6. In the rat, tissue fluid sequestration produced by subcutaneous polyethylene glycol injection causes water drinking within an hour, but onset of salt appetite is delayed by 6–10 h.7 This delay also occurs in salt appetite produced by peritoneal dialysis8, tourniquet release9 and formalin injection10,11. New data indicate the powerful effects of the hormones involved in the reproductive process in inducing salt appetite. With pregnancy and lactation in Na-replete rabbits, avid salt appetite develops with a daily turnover of 50% or more of extracellular fluid (ECF) Na (ref. 12). This is caused by the combined action of oestradiol, cortisol, ACTH, prolactin and oxytocin13. ACTH seems to act directly on the brain14. Recent experimental data provide new information on the central nervous system control mechanism. Weisinger et al.15 reported that in Na-depleted sheep, the systemic influx of Hypertonie NaCl significantly reduced motivation for salt within 10–20 min. In the light of these data, we decided to evaluate the effect on Na appetite of increasing the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Na concentration or osmolality in Na-deficient sheep. We now report the first experiments to show that it is feasible to induce salt appetite within an hour or less by a physiological procedure."

https://openalex.org/W1533986497,"Three oligodeoxynucleotides have been chemically synthesized and used as hybridization probes to detect gastrin-specific mRNA within an heterogeneous population of RNA molecules. Using these oligonucleotides whose nucleotide sequences were deduced from the amino acid sequence of the hormone, 0.2 fmol of gastrin mRNA can be detected/microgram of poly(A)-RNA from hog antrums. The 32P-labeled oligonucleotides hybridize specifically to RNA covalently coupled to DBM-paper (Alwine, J.C., Kemp, D.J., and Stark, G.R. (1977) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 74, 5350-5354). Labeled oligonucleotides also hybridize specifically to RNA separated by gel electrophoresis in the presence of CH3HgOH and covalently coupled to DBM-paper. Using this procedure, we have found that the mRNA coding for gastrin contains about 620 nucleotides, which is in agreement with results obtained using gastrin cDNA to determine mRNA size."

https://openalex.org/W2070102952,"Unlike normal animals or those with sham lesions, rats with hippocampal and septal lesions behaved in an operant chamber as if a dependency existed between pellet delivery and their behavior, despite the fact that reinforcement was based on time, not behavior, and was therefore free. This superstitious behavior did not result from a general inability to inhibit responding, as responding rapidly ceased when the pellets were discontinued. These findings suggest that the hippocampus integrates information regarding response-reinforcer relations, which in the normal rat permits superfluous operant behavior to be eliminated."

https://openalex.org/W1759876686,The structure of lactate dehydrogenase isoenzyme C4 from mouse testes was solved at 2.9 A resolution using the technique of molecular replacement. The electron density map revealed a ternary-like configuration of the flexible loop peptide although density corresponding to the coenzyme and substrate molecules was not present. Apparently the apo-lactate dehydrogenase molecule in solution is in a dynamic equilibrium between the O (loop open as found in dogfish apo-lactate dehydrogenase M4) and C (loop closed as found in a variety of ternary complexes) conformations. During crystallization of the apoenzyme one or the other conformers is selected. The apparent stability of the closed conformation for the apo-lactate dehydrogenase C4 molecule may in part explain the low catalytic turnover number of the C isoenzyme. A possible substitution of an arginine residue at position 30 may also be a contributing factor as well as allowing NADP to act as coenzyme.

https://openalex.org/W58880372,A tentative amino acid sequence of mouse testicular lactate dehydrogenase C4 was deduced from an electron density map and comparison with five other known lactate dehydrogenase sequences. The amino acid composition determined by chemical analysis agrees reasonably well with the present results. Necessary changes in amino acids were largely conservative and confined to the external portions of the molecule. Residues in the Q and P subunit contact regions were particularly well conserved as were most internal residues. The minimum base change/codon was similar between the C and H isoenzymes and between the C and M isoenzymes.
https://openalex.org/W1569482878,"Abstract Origins of CD bands in lima bean proteinase inhibitor were deduced from an acetylation-deacetylation study of the sole tyrosyl residue in the protein (Tyr 69), and by analogy with Bowman-Birk soybean proteinase inhibitor, a homologous protein with similar spectral properties. Tyr 69 is relatively inaccessible to N-acetylimidazole; 100-fold molar excess of the reagent in the presence of 6 M guanidine hydrochloride elicited about 70 to 80% O-acetylation. A broad negative CD band centered around 280 nm arises mainly from the longest wavelength transition of cystinyl side chains (epsilon L--epsilon R approximately equal to -0.8 M-1 cm-1 per disulfide). The second cystinyl transition gives rise to a positive CD band of a comparable intensity at 247 nm. The Lb vibronic transition of Tyr 69 has negative CD around 280 nm, contributing approximately 10% of the total CD intensity at 278 nm (epsilon L--epsilon R approximately equal to -0.5 M-1 cm-1). The 232 nm positive shoulder is from the La vibronic transition of Tyr 69. Radical anions, Br2- and (CNS)2-, generated by the irradiation of N2O-saturated inhibitor solutions containing KBr or KCNS, reduced tyrosyl CD without affecting disulfide CD bands, indicating that the radical anions damaged Tyr 69 without altering protein conformation. The inhibitor modified at Tyr 69 by Br2- and (CNS)2- retained full activity toward trypsin and chymotrypsin. The irradiation of the inhibitor in the air-saturated solution led to loss in tyrosyl as well as cystinyl CD bands and decline in both antiproteinase activities."
https://openalex.org/W1568636373,"The rate constants for reduction of methemerythrin from Phascolopsis gouldii and Themiste pyroides by hydrated electrons are 2.0 and 3.9 x 10(9) M(-1)s(-1), respectively, at pH 8.2, I = 0.03 M, and 25 degrees C. There is only a small increase in rate when the pH is lowered to 6.3 and a very small decrease when the ionic strength is raised to 0.1 M. Adding azide ion (to form the met-azide adduct) has little effect on the reactivity towards e-aq. For the monomer form, metmyohemerythrin from T. pyroides, the reaction rate constant is 4.5 x 10(9) M(-1)s(-1). Methemerythrin from T. pyroides reacts with CO2- with a rate constant 6.8 x 10(7) M(-1)s(-1). The reactivity sequence e-aq greater than CO2- greater than SO2- (from dithionite reduction) towards methemerythrin is the same as that observed with reduction of heme proteins but the rate constants are some 10 to 100 times smaller for the former. Only 10 to 20% of the e-aq or CO2- radicals generated effect reduction of the iron centers in methemerythrin."
