https://openalex.org/W1979480286,"The possibility that neurons in the basal ganglia and cerebellum innervate areas of the cerebral cortex that are involved in cognitive function has been a controversial subject. Here, retrograde transneuronal transport of herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV1) was used to identify subcortical neurons that project via the thalamus to area 46 of the primate prefrontal cortex. This cortical area is known to be involved in spatial working memory. Many neurons in restricted regions of the dentate nucleus of the cerebellum and in the internal segment of the globus pallidus were labeled by transneuronal transport of virus from area 46. The location of these neurons was different from those labeled after HSV1 transport from motor areas of the cerebral cortex. These observations define an anatomical substrate for the involvement of basal ganglia and cerebellar output in higher cognitive function."
https://openalex.org/W1993064864,"Mice lacking the proto-oncogene c-fos develop the bone disease osteopetrosis. Fos mutant mice were found to have a block in the differentiation of bone-resorbing osteoclasts that was intrinsic to hematopoietic cells. Bone marrow transplantation rescued the osteopetrosis, and ectopic c-fos expression overcame this differentiation block. The lack of Fos also caused a lineage shift between osteoclasts and macrophages that resulted in increased numbers of bone marrow macrophages. These results identify Fos as a key regulator of osteoclast-macrophage lineage determination in vivo and provide insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying metabolic bone diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2036546668,"Loss of heterozygosity data from familial tumors suggest that BRCA1, a gene that confers susceptibility to ovarian and early-onset breast cancer, encodes a tumor suppressor. The BRCA1 region is also subject to allelic loss in sporadic breast and ovarian cancers, an indication that BRCA1 mutations may occur somatically in these tumors. The BRCA1 coding region was examined for mutations in primary breast and ovarian tumors that show allele loss at the BRCA1 locus. Mutations were detected in 3 of 32 breast and 1 of 12 ovarian carcinomas; all four mutations were germline alterations and occurred in early-onset cancers. These results suggest that mutation of BRCA1 may not be critical in the development of the majority of breast and ovarian cancers that arise in the absence of a mutant germline allele."
https://openalex.org/W2033828028,"Naturally occurring cell death (NOCD) is a prominent feature of the developing nervous system. During this process, neurons express bcl-2, a major regulator of cell death whose expression may determine whether a neuron dies or survives. To gain insight into the possible role of bcl-2 during NOCD in vivo, we generated lines of transgenic mice in which neurons overexpress the human BCL-2 protein under the control of the neuron-specific enolase (NSE) or phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) promoters. BCL-2 overexpression reduced neuronal loss during the NOCD period, which led to hypertrophy of the nervous system. For instance, the facial nucleus and the ganglion cell layer of the retina had, respectively, 40% and 50% more neurons than normal. Consistent with this finding, more axons than normal were found in the facial and optic nerves. We also tested whether neurons overexpressing BCL-2 were more resistant to permanent ischemia induced by middle cerebral artery occlusion; in transgenic mice, the volume of the brain infarction was reduced by 50% as compared with wild-type mice. These animals represent an invaluable tool for studying the effects of increased neuronal numbers on brain function as well as the mechanisms that control the survival of neurons during development and adulthood."
https://openalex.org/W2073277085,"The recognition mechanisms and dissociation pathways of the avidin-biotin complex and of actin monomers in actin filaments were investigated. The unbinding forces of discrete complexes of avidin or streptavidin with biotin analogs are proportional to the enthalpy change of the complex formation but independent of changes in the free energy. This result indicates that the unbinding process is adiabatic and that entropic changes occur after unbinding. On the basis of the measured forces and binding energies, an effective rupture length of 9.5 +/- 1 angstroms was calculated for all biotin-avidin pairs and approximately 1 to 3 angstroms for the actin monomer-monomer interaction. A model for the correlation among binding forces, intermolecular potential, and molecular function is proposed."
https://openalex.org/W2069652470,"PHAS-I is a heat-stable protein (relative molecular mass approximately 12,400) found in many tissues. It is rapidly phosphorylated in rat adipocytes incubated with insulin or growth factors. Nonphosphorylated PHAS-I bound to initiation factor 4E (eIF-4E) and inhibited protein synthesis. Serine-64 in PHAS-I was rapidly phosphorylated by mitogen-activated (MAP) kinase, the major insulin-stimulated PHAS-I kinase in adipocyte extracts. Results obtained with antibodies, immobilized PHAS-I, and a messenger RNA cap affinity resin indicated that PHAS-I did not bind eIF-4E when serine-64 was phosphorylated. Thus, PHAS-I may be a key mediator of the stimulation of protein synthesis by the diverse group of agents and stimuli that activate MAP kinase."
https://openalex.org/W1990867492,"Femtosecond pump-probe experiments reveal the impulsive production of photoproduct in the primary event in vision. The retinal chromophore of rhodopsin was excited with a 35-femtosecond pulse at 500 nanometers, and transient changes in absorption were measured with 10-femtosecond probe pulses. At probe wavelengths within the photo-product absorption band, oscillatory features with a period of 550 femtoseconds (60 wavenumbers) were observed whose phase and amplitude demonstrate that they are the result of nonstationary vibrational motion in the ground state of the photoproduct. The observation of coherent vibrational motion of the photoproduct supports the idea that the primary step in vision is a vibrationally coherent process and that the high quantum yield of the cis-->trans isomerization in rhodopsin is a consequence of the extreme speed of the excited-state torsional motion."
https://openalex.org/W2074136986,"Inbreeding is known to lead to decreased survival and reproduction in captive populations of animals. It is also important to know whether inbreeding has deleterious effects in natural habitats. An estimate was made of the effects of inbreeding in white-footed mice, Peromyscus leucopus noveboracensis, derived from a wild population. This study demonstrates that inbreeding had a significant detrimental effect on the survivorship of mice reintroduced into a natural habitat. This effect was more severe than the effect observed in laboratory studies of the population."
https://openalex.org/W2011575330,"A direct role of aberrant neurofilament accumulation in the etiology of human motor neuron diseases, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, is suggested by the presence of abnormal accumulations of neurofilaments as an early hallmark of the pathogenic process. Furthermore, forcing increased expression of neurofilament subunits in transgenic mouse models leads to motor neuron dysfunction, albeit without the widespread motor neuron death typical of human disease. We now show that accumulation of a modest level of a point mutant in the smallest neurofilament subunit (NF-L) causes massive, selective degeneration of spinal motor neurons accompanied by abnormal accumulations of neurofilaments and severe neurogenic atrophy of skeletal muscles. As in human disease, sensory neurons show only a modest level of degenerative changes. Thus, neurofilament mutations can cause selective motor neuron death, and neurofilamentous abnormalities may be a common toxic intermediate that significantly contributes to the motor neuron death in human disease."
https://openalex.org/W2005753349,"Three genetic complementation groups of rodent cells are defective for both repair of x-ray-induced double-strand breaks and V(D)J recombination. Cells from one group lack a DNA end-binding activity that is biochemically and antigenically similar to the Ku autoantigen. Transfection of complementary DNA (cDNA) that encoded the 86-kilodalton subunit of Ku rescued these mutant cells for DNA end-binding activity, x-ray resistance, and V(D)J recombination activity. These results establish a role for Ku in DNA repair and recombination. Furthermore, as a component of a DNA-dependent protein kinase, Ku may initiate a signaling pathway induced by DNA damage."
https://openalex.org/W2034264764,"The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) contains molecular chaperones that facilitate the folding of proteins in mammalian cells. Biosynthetic labeling was used to study the interactions of two chaperones, BiP and calnexin, with vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) glycoprotein (G protein). Coimmunoprecipitation of G protein with the chaperones showed that BiP bound maximally to early folding intermediates of G protein, whereas calnexin bound after a short lag to more folded molecules. Castanospermine, an inhibitor of ER glucosidases, blocked the binding of proteins to calnexin and inhibited G protein folding. Interaction with calnexin was necessary for efficient folding of G protein and for retention of partially folded forms."
https://openalex.org/W2090948229,"The Drosophila tumor suppressor gene lethal (1) discs large (dlg) encodes a protein necessary for normal cell growth in epithelial and brain tissue. It shares high sequence identity to the mammalian synaptic proteins PSD-95 and SAP-70, whose functions are unknown. To determine the localization and role of dlg at synapses, we investigated its distribution and the effects of dlg mutations on Drosophila neuromuscular junctions. We show that dlg immunoreactivity is expressed at one type of glutamatergic synapse and is associated with both presynaptic and postsynaptic membranes. Mutations in dlg alter the expression of dlg and cause striking changes in the structure of the subsynaptic reticulum, a postsynaptic specialization at these synapses. These results indicate that dlg is required for normal synaptic structure and offer insights regarding the role of dlg homologs at vertebrate synapses."
https://openalex.org/W2158350175,"Mice deficient for the gene encoding alpha-calcium-calmodulin-dependent kinase II (alpha-CaMKII knockout mice) provide a promising tool to link behavioral and cellular abnormalities with a specific molecular lesion. The heterozygous mouse exhibited a well-circumscribed syndrome of behavioral abnormalities, consisting primarily of a decreased fear response and an increase in defensive aggression, in the absence of any measured cognitive deficits. Unlike the heterozygote, the homozygote displayed abnormal behavior in all paradigms tested. At the cellular level, both extracellular and whole-cell patch clamp recordings indicated that serotonin release in putative serotonergic neurons of the dorsal raphe was reduced. Thus, alpha-CaMKII knockout mice, in particular the heterozygote, may provide a model for studying the molecular and cellular basis underlying emotional disorders involving fear and aggression."
https://openalex.org/W1965286700,"Members of a family of highly conserved proteins, termed 14-3-3 proteins, were found by several experimental approaches to associate with Raf-1, a central component of a key signal transduction pathway. Optimal complex formation required the amino-terminal regulatory domain of Raf-1. The association of 14-3-3 proteins and Raf-1 was not substantially affected by the activation state of Raf."
https://openalex.org/W2058768664,"An engineered variant of subtilisin BPN', termed subtiligase, which efficiently ligates esterified peptides in aqueous solution, was used for the complete synthesis of ribonuclease (RNase) A that contains unnatural catalytic residues. Fully active RNase A (124 residues long) was produced in milligram quantities by stepwise ligation of six esterified peptide fragments (each 12 to 30 residues long) at yields averaging 70 percent per ligation. Variants of RNase A were produced in which the catalytic histidines at positions 12 and 119 were substituted with the unnatural amino acid 4-fluorohistidine, which has a pKa of 3.5 compared to 6.8 for histidine. Large changes in the profile of the pH as it affects rate occurred for the single and double mutants with surprisingly little change in the kcat for either the RNA cleavage or hydrolysis steps. The data indicate that these imidazoles function as general acids and bases, but that the proton transfer steps are not rate-limiting when the imidazoles are present in their correct protonation states. These studies indicate the potential of subtiligase for the blockwise synthesis of large proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2089766601,"Macrophage-stimulating protein (MSP) is a member of the hepatocyte growth factor-scatter factor (HGF-SF) family. Labeled MSP bound to Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells transfected with complementary DNA encoding Ron, a cell membrane protein tyrosine kinase. Cross-linking of 125I-labeled MSP to transfected cells (MDCK-RE7 cells) and immunoprecipitation by antibodies to Ron revealed a 220-kilodalton complex, a size consistent with that of MSP (80 kilodaltons) cross-linked to the beta chain of Ron (150 kilodaltons). The binding of 125I-labeled MSP to MDCK-RE7 cells was inhibited by unlabeled MSP, but not by HGF-SF. MSP caused phosphorylation of the beta chain of Ron and induced migration of MDCK-RE7 cells. These results establish the ron gene product as a specific cell-surface receptor for MSP."

https://openalex.org/W2037741778,"Depolarization of isolated frog saccular hair cells caused Ca2+-dependent increases in membrane capacitance that we interpret as the fusion of synaptic vesicles with the plasma membrane. During a maintained depolarization to −10 mV, the capacitance increased at a rate corresponding to the fusion of ∼500 vesicles per second at each active zone. Release continued at this high rate for up to 2 s, long enough to exhaust >5 times the number of vesicles initially in close apposition to the plasma membrane at active zones. We therefore propose that hair cells are specialized for rapid replenishment of vesicles at release sites. Upon repolarization to −70 mV, the capacitance returned exponentially (time constant, ∼14 s) to near the prestimulus level in perforated-patch recordings, but not in whole-cell recordings, suggesting that a mobile intracellular factor is required for membrane retrieval."
https://openalex.org/W2041131340,"An activity that severs stable microtubules is thought to be involved in microtubule reorganization during the cell cycle. Here, a 48-kilodalton microtubule-severing protein was purified from Xenopus eggs and identified as translational elongation factor 1 alpha (EF-1 alpha). Bacterially expressed human EF-1 alpha also displayed microtubule-severing activity in vitro and, when microinjected into fibroblasts, induced rapid and transient fragmentation of cytoplasmic microtubule arrays. Thus, EF-1 alpha, an essential component of the eukaryotic translational apparatus, appears to have a second role as a regulator of cytoskeletal rearrangements."
https://openalex.org/W2086934811,"The Arabidopsis mutant ttg lacks both trichomes (epidermal hairs) and anthocyanin pigments. Trichomes and anthocyanins are restored by the constitutive expression of the maize transcriptional regulator (R). The expression of an R-glucocorticoid receptor chimeric protein results in a steroid hormone-dependent, conditional allele of R that functions in whole Arabidopsis plants. The response of the chimeric protein to pulses of hormone was used to define the pattern and timing of trichome formation on the developing leaf epidermis. Each adaxial epidermal leaf cell appears to have an equal probability of differentiating into a trichome; there is a temporal zone of decision for trichome cell fate that proceeds as a wave from the tip to the base of developing leaves."
https://openalex.org/W1991570498,"The voltage-gated Ca2+ current in cone photoreceptors operates over only a small part of the physiological voltage range produced by light and, consequently, appears insufficient for controlling transmitter release. We have used a whole-cell voltage clamp to measure membrane current and the capacitance change produced by exocytosis in solitary cone and rod photoreceptors isolated from the salamander retina. In both types of photoreceptor, Ca2+ influx through voltage-gated Ca2+ channels initiated exocytosis. In addition, Ca2+ influx through a cGMP-gated channel in the inner segment and synaptic processes of cones also initiated exocytosis. The cGMP-gated current sustained exocytosis over the entire physiological voltage range."
https://openalex.org/W2058668641,A complex consisting of the cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) PHO85 and the cyclin PHO80 phosphorylates and is thought to inactivate the transcription factor PHO4 when yeast cells are grown in medium containing high concentrations of phosphate. The CDK inhibitor PHO81 inhibits the kinase activity of the PHO80-PHO85 complex when Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells are grown in medium depleted of phosphate. A region of PHO81 with similarity to the mammalian CDK inhibitor p16INK4 is sufficient for inhibition in vitro. These studies demonstrate that CDK inhibitors are used to regulate kinases involved in processes other than cell cycle control and suggest that the ankyrin repeat motif may be commonly used for interaction with cyclin-CDK complexes.
https://openalex.org/W1965385026,"In this study, a protein that interacts with sequences encoded by the first exon of the protein kinase Bcr was cloned. The Bcr-associated protein 1 (Bap-1) is a member of the 14-3-3 family of proteins. Bap-1 interacts with full-length c-Bcr and with the chimeric Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase of Philadelphia chromosome (Ph1)-positive human leukemias. Bap-1 is a substrate for the Bcr serine-threonine kinase and is also phosphorylated on tyrosine by Bcr-Abl but not by c-Abl. Bap-1 may function in the regulation of c-Bcr and may contribute to the transforming activity of Bcr-Abl in vivo. 14-3-3 proteins are essential for cell proliferation and have a role in determining the timing of mitosis in yeast. Through direct binding to sequences present in Bcr and in other proteins implicated in signaling, the mammalian 14-3-3 proteins may link specific signaling protein components to mitogenic and cell-cycle control pathways."
https://openalex.org/W1985107413,"The molecular structure of the D-alanine:D-alanine ligase of the ddlB gene of Escherichia coli, co-crystallized with an S,R-methylphosphinate and adenosine triphosphate, was determined by x-ray diffraction to a resolution of 2.3 angstroms. A catalytic mechanism for the ligation of two D-alanine substrates is proposed in which a helix dipole and a hydrogen-bonded triad of tyrosine, serine, and glutamic acid assist binding and deprotonation steps. From sequence comparison, it is proposed that a different triad exists in a recently discovered D-alanine:D-lactate ligase (VanA) present in vancomycin-resistant enterococci. A molecular mechanism for the altered specificity of VanA is suggested."
https://openalex.org/W2076477984,"A number of bacterial protein toxins, including adenylate cyclase (AC) toxin from Bordetella pertussis, require the product of an accessory gene in order to express their biological activities. In this study, mass spectrometry was used to demonstrate that activated, wild-type AC toxin was modified by amide-linked palmitoylation on the epsilon-amino group of lysine 983. This modification was absent from a mutant in which the accessory gene had been disrupted. A synthetic palmitoylated peptide corresponding to the tryptic fragment (glutamine 972 to arginine 984) that contained the acylation blocked AC toxin-induced accumulation of adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate, whereas the non-acylated peptide had no effect."
https://openalex.org/W2002821352,"During development of the zebrafish forebrain, a simple scaffold of axon pathways is pioneered by a small number of neurons. We show that boundaries of expression domains of members of the eph, forkhead, pax, and wnt gene families correlate with the positions at which these neurons differentiate and extend axons. Analysis of genetically or experimentally altered forebrains indicates that if a boundary is maintained, there is appropriate neural differentiation with respect to the boundary. Conversely, in the absence of a boundary, there is concomitant disruption of neural patterning. We also show that a strip of cells within the dorsal diencephalon shares features with ventral midline cells. This strip of cells fails to develop in mutant fish in which specification of the ventral CNS is disrupted, suggesting that its development may be regulated by the same inductive pathways that pattern the ventral midline."
https://openalex.org/W1971863225,"Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAP kinases) are common components of signaling pathways induced by diverse growth stimuli. Although the guanidine nucleotide-binding Ras proteins are known to be upstream activators of MAP kinases, the extent to which MAP kinases directly contribute to the mitogenic effect of Ras is as yet undefined. In this study, inhibition of MAP kinases by the MAP kinase phosphatase MKP-1 blocked the induction of DNA synthesis in quiescent rat embryonic fibroblast REF-52 cells by an activated mutant of Ras, V12Ras. These results suggest an essential role for activation of MAP kinases in the transition from the quiescent to the DNA replication phase of the eukaryotic cell cycle."
https://openalex.org/W2027057239,"Femtosecond laser pulses, resonant with Soret band of the nitric oxide complex of myoglobin (MbNO), were used to probe coherent, low-frequency nuclear motion of the heme group after photolysis. Distinct oscillations with periods of 430 and 150 femtoseconds were observed and are attributed to heme doming and iron-histidine motion, respectively. These results verify that the nuclear motion of the heme is strongly coupled to the ligand binding reaction and demonstrate that such motion is not determined by overdamped (diffusive) dynamics. The relative phases and frequencies of the nuclear motion of the photoproduct suggest that the coherence arises from impulsive electronic forces associated with the spin-state change of the heme iron atom and the depopulation of its dz2 orbital during the bond-breaking event."
https://openalex.org/W2060384167,"A four-ring tripeptide containing alternating imidazole and pyrrole carboxamides specifically binds six-base pair 5'-(A,T)GCGC(A,T)-3' sites in the minor groove of DNA. The designed peptide has a specificity completely reversed from that of the tripyrrole distamycin, which binds A,T sequences. Structural studies with nuclear magnetic resonance revealed that two peptides bound side-by-side and in an antiparallel orientation in the minor groove. Each of the four imidazoles in the 2:1 ligand-DNA complex recognized a specific guanine amino group in the GCGC core through a hydrogen bond. Targeting a designated four-base pair G.C tract by this synthetic ligand supports the generality of the 2:1 peptide-DNA motif for sequence-specific minor groove recognition of DNA."
https://openalex.org/W2007984489,"rab3A, a low molecular weight GTP-binding protein of synaptic vesicles with a putative function in synaptic vesicle docking, interacts in a GTP-dependent manner with rabphilin-3A, a peripheral membrane protein that binds Ca2+ and phospholipids. We now show that rabphilin-3A is an evolutionarily conserved synaptic vesicle protein that is attached to synaptic vesicle membranes via its N terminus and exhibits a heterogeneous distribution among synapses. In rab3A-deficient mice, rabphilin-3A is decreased in synapses belonging to neurons that primarily express rab3A and accumulates in the perikarya of these neurons. In contrast, neurons expressing significant levels of rab3C still contain normal levels of rabphilin-3A in a synaptic pattern, and rabphilin-3A binds rab3C in vitro. These results suggest that analogous to the membrane recruitment of raf by ras, rab3A and rab3C may function in recruiting rabphilin-3A to the synaptic vesicle membrane in a GTP-dependent manner."
https://openalex.org/W2024364777,"Mice homozygous for the spastic mutation (spa) suffer from a complex motor disorder resulting from reduced CNS levels of the adult glycine receptor isoform GlyRA, which is composed of ligand-binding alpha 1 and structural beta polypeptides. The beta subunit-encoding gene (Glyrb) was mapped near the spa locus on mouse chromosome 3. In spa/spa mice, aberrant splicing of the beta subunit pre-mRNA strikingly diminishes the CNS contents of full-length transcripts, whereas truncated beta subunit mRNAs accumulate. This is a result of exon skipping, which causes translational frameshifts and premature stop codons. Intron 5 of the spa Glyrb gene contains an L1 transposable element that apparently is causal for the aberrant splicing of beta subunit transcripts."
https://openalex.org/W1994577657,"Cysteine string proteins are synapse-specific proteins. In Drosophila, csp deletion mutants exhibit temperature-sensitive paralysis and early death. Here, we report that neuromuscular transmission is impaired presynaptically in these csp mutant larvae. At 22 degrees C, evoked transmitter release is depressed relative to wild type and rescued controls, and high frequency stimulation of the nerve leads to sporadic failures. At 30 degrees C, stimulus-evoked responses decline gradually before failing completely. When the temperature is returned to 22 degrees C, evoked responses recover. Spontaneous release events persist at both 22 degrees C and 30 degrees C. Since nerve conduction and postsynaptic sensitivity are unaffected, these data indicate that csp mutations disrupt depolarization-secretion coupling. This disruption explains the cellular basis of the temperature-sensitive paralysis of these organisms."
https://openalex.org/W1967161878,"Maternally expressed Skn-1 protein is required for the correct specification of certain blastomere fates in early Caenorhabditis elegans embryos. Skn-1 contains a basic region similar to those of basic leucine zipper (bZIP) proteins but, paradoxically, it lacks a leucine zipper dimerization segment. Random sequence selection methods were used to show that Skn-1 binds to specific DNA sequences as a monomer. The Skn-1 basic region lies at the carboxyl terminus of an 85-amino acid domain that binds preferentially to a bZIP half-site and also recognizes adjacent 5' AT-rich sequences in the minor groove, apparently with an amino (NH2)-terminal ""arm"" related to those of homeodomain proteins. The intervening residues appear to stabilize interactions of these two subdomains with DNA. The Skn-1 DNA binding domain thus represents an alternative strategy for promoting binding of a basic region segment recognition helix to its cognate half-site. The results point to an underlying modularity in subdomains within established DNA binding domains."

https://openalex.org/W1991034999,"The structure of the heterodimeric flavocytochrome c sulfide dehydrogenase from Chromatium vinosum was determined at a resolution of 2.53 angstroms. It contains a glutathione reductase-like flavin-binding subunit and a diheme cytochrome subunit. The diheme cytochrome folds as two domains, each resembling mitochondrial cytochrome c, and has an unusual interpropionic acid linkage joining the two heme groups in the interior of the subunit. The active site of the flavoprotein subunit contains a catalytically important disulfide bridge located above the pyrimidine portion of the flavin ring. A tryptophan, threonine, or tyrosine side chain may provide a partial conduit for electron transfer to one of the heme groups located 10 angstroms from the flavin."
https://openalex.org/W2076933300,"Drosophila phototransduction is a phosphoinositide-mediated and Ca(2+)-regulated signaling cascade ideal for the dissection of feedback regulatory mechanisms. To study the roles of intracellular Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) in this process, we developed novel techniques for the measurement of [Ca2+]i in intact photoreceptors. We genetically engineered flies that express a UV-specific rhodopsin in place of the normal rhodopsin, so that long wavelength light can be used to image [Ca2+]i changes while minimally exciting the photoreceptor cells. We show that activation with UV generates [Ca2+]i increases that are spatially localized to the rhabdomeres and that are entirely dependent on the influx of extracellular Ca2+. Application of intracellular Ca2+ chelators of varying affinities demonstrates that the Ca2+ influx initially generates a large-amplitude transient that is crucial for negative regulation. Internal Ca2+ stores were revealed by discharging them with thapsigargin. But, in contrast to proposals that IP3-sensitive stores mediate phototransduction, thapsigargin does not mimic or acutely interfere with photoexcitation. Finally, we identify a photoreceptor-specific PKC as essential for normal kinetics of [Ca2+]i recovery."
https://openalex.org/W2022374934,"Neural circadian pacemakers can be reset by light, and the resetting mechanism may involve cyclic nucleotide second messengers. We have examined pacemaker resetting and free-running activity rhythms in Drosophila dunce (dnc) and DC0 mutants, which identify a cAMP specific phosphodiesterase and the catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase, respectively. dnc mutants exhibit augmented light-induced phase delays and shortened circadian periods, which indicate altered pacemaker function. Interestingly, however, light-induced phase advances are normal in dnc, suggesting a selective effect on one component of the pacemaker resetting response. Furthermore, we demonstrate the presence of circadian rhythms in cAMP content in head tissues and show that dnc mutations increase the amplitude of daily cAMP peaks. These results show that cAMP levels are not chronically elevated in the dnc mutant. A role for cAMP signaling in circadian processes is also suggested by an analysis of DC0 mutants, which have severe kinase deficits and display arrhythmic locomotor activity."
https://openalex.org/W2072156051,"Embryonic mouse neural tubes produce a variety of terminally differentiated cells in vitro, mostly neurons and glia. We report here that some of these cells differentiate into skeletal muscle cells. The possibility of mesoderm contamination was ruled out as follows. First, Dil+ muscle cells were present in cultures from a Dil-labeled neuroepithelium. Second, a small fraction of cultured neural tube cells coexpressed muscle myosin and neuronal beta III tubulin within the same cell. Third, embryos generated from embryonic stem cells in which nlacZ was targeted into the myogenic gene myf-5 expressed nlacZ in a localized region of the neural tube. These myf-5+ cells coexpress neuronal and muscle markers in culture. The developmental significance of this phenomenon is discussed in the context of overlapping regulatory networks between myogenesis and neurogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1987270520,"The rate at which the TATA-binding protein (TBP) interacts with the TATA element and promotes transcription by RNA polymerase II was determined in yeast cells. A TBP derivative with altered TATA-element specificity was rapidly induced, and transcription from promoters with appropriately mutated TATA elements was measured. Without a functional activator protein, basal transcription was observed only after a lag of several hours. In contrast, GCN4-activated transcription occurred rapidly upon induction of the TBP derivative. These results suggest that accessibility of TBP to the chromatin template in vivo is rate limiting and that activation domains increase recruitment of TBP to the promoter."
https://openalex.org/W2050443408,"The polarized microtubule cytoskeleton of the Drosophila oocyte directs the localization of the maternal determinants which establish the anterior-posterior (AP) axis of the embryo. Because the formation of this microtubule array is dependent on signals from the follicle cells that surround the oocyte, it has been proposed that AP polarity originates in the follicle cells. Here it is shown that the movement of the oocyte to the posterior of the egg chamber early in oogenesis determines AP polarity in the follicle cell layer, and also in the oocyte. Moreover, the generation of AP asymmetry requires signaling from the germ line to the soma and back again."
https://openalex.org/W1983145685,"The trimeric protein hemagglutinin (HA) of the influenza viral envelope is essential for cell entry. To investigate the interaction of HA with membranes, two 40-residue, cysteine-substituted peptides comprising the loop region and the first part of the coiled-coil stem were synthesized and modified with a nitroxide spin label. Electron paramagnetic resonance analysis revealed that the peptide inserts reversibly into phospholipid vesicles under endosomal pH conditions. This result suggests that some or all of the long coiled-coil trimer of HA may insert into membranes, which could bring the viral and cell membranes closer together and facilitate fusion."
https://openalex.org/W2095274293,"Six baboons (Papio cynocephalus) were intravenously inoculated with the human immunodeficiency virus-type 2 (HIV-2) strain HIV-2UC2. All seroconverted within 6 weeks after inoculation; five animals became persistently infected. Four developed lymphadenopathy, and three of the animals had CD4+ T cell loss within 18 to 24 months after inoculation. One of these baboons, showing severe clinical symptoms, showed at necropsy widespread dissemination of virus with follicular depletion in the lymph nodes, extensive fibromatosis involving lymphoid and nonlymphoid tissues, and lymphocytic interstitial pneumonitis. Another animal is cachectic and exhibited lymphoid follicular lysis and fibrous skin lesions. Other baboons inoculated with a second strain, HIV-2UC14, have shown evidence of persistent infection. HIV-2 infection of baboons provides a valuable animal model for studying HIV persistence and pathogenesis and for evaluating approaches to antiviral therapies."
https://openalex.org/W2022710910,"Cortical axons innervate their brainstem target, the basilar pons, by the initiation and extension of collateral branches interstitially along their length. To address whether a diffusible pons-derived chemoattractant controls these events, we used cocultures in collagen matrices and time-lapse microscopy. Pontine explants enhanced by 5-fold the de novo initiation of transient branches along cortical axons; most branches were directed toward pons. Of the branches extended toward pons, 2%-3% were stabilized; those extended away were not. Pontine explants also enhanced the stable bifurcation of growth cones and prompted directional changes by growth cone turning and collateral extension. These effects were distance dependent and mimicked by pons-conditioned medium. This evidence indicates that the pons activity promotes branch initiation interstitially along cortical axons, a novel property for a chemoattractant, and provides a directional cue for their growth. These findings suggest that the pons chemoattractant serves as a diffusible target-recognition molecule."
https://openalex.org/W2012683378,"Voltage-dependent potassium channels belong to a family of structurally related cation channels that underlie the electrical activity of excitable cells. Many potassium channels are blocked with high affinity by scorpion toxins, whereas others are completely insensitive. We transferred toxin sensitivity from the highly sensitive Kv1.3 (KV3) to the insensitive Kv2.1 (DRK1) potassium channel by transferring the stretch of amino acids between transmembrane domains 5/6. We provide evidence that this S5-S6 linker, which has been shown to comprise the pore-forming region, is probably the only part of the ion channel that directly interacts with bound toxin. Using site-directed mutagenesis, we identified specific residues in the S5-S6 linker that are responsible for the acquisition of toxin sensitivity by Kv2.1."
https://openalex.org/W1991729136,"In the protochordate Halocynthia roretzi, voltage-activated sodium current undergoes a change in kinetics within 48 hr of fertilization. Molecular cloning and microinjection of antisense DNA into single cells suggest that the kinetic changes are due to the increased expression of a putative neural-specific sodium channel gene, TuNa I. TuNa I gene transcription is first induced in late stage gastrulae, preceding the appearance of the rapidly inactivating sodium current unique to neural cells. In cleavage-arrested and intact embryos, cell interactions between specific animal and vegetal blastomeres are required for induction of TuNa I gene expression. Our results implicate cell contact, prior to neurulation, as a mechanism for selectively activating the TuNa I gene expressed in cells of the neural lineage."
https://openalex.org/W2037050338,"RNA polymerases I, II, and III each use the TATA-binding protein (TBP). Regulators that target this shared factor may therefore provide a means to coordinate the activities of the three nuclear RNA polymerases. The repressor Dr1 binds to TBP and blocks the interaction of TBP with polymerase II- and polymerase III-specific factors. This enables Dr1 to coordinately regulate transcription by RNA polymerases II and III. Under the same conditions, Dr1 does not inhibit polymerase I transcription. By selectively repressing polymerases II and III, Dr1 may shift the physiological balance of transcriptional output in favor of polymerase I."

https://openalex.org/W1966254649,"Transgenic Xenopus laevisembryos were produced by transplantation of transfected cultured cell nuclei into unfertilized eggs. A Xenopus cell line, X-C, was stably transfected with plasmids containing a hygromycin-resistance gene and genes for either β-galactosidase with a heat shock promoter or chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) with a muscle-specific actin promoter. Nuclei transplanted from these cells into unfertilized eggs directed development of embryos containing stably integrated copies of the plasmids in each cell. Transgenic embryos showed somite-specific expression of CAT and uniform expression of β-galactosidase. Transgenic embryos produced by nuclear transplantation should be useful for testing the function of cloned genes in amphibian development."
