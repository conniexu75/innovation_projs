https://openalex.org/W2171358926,"In contrast to animals, little is known about pattern formation in plants. Physiological and genetic data suggest the involvement of the phytohormone auxin in this process. Here, we characterize a novel member of the PIN family of putative auxin efflux carriers, Arabidopsis PIN4, that is localized in developing and mature root meristems. Atpin4 mutants are defective in establishment and maintenance of endogenous auxin gradients, fail to canalize externally applied auxin, and display various patterning defects in both embryonic and seedling roots. We propose a role for AtPIN4 in generating a sink for auxin below the quiescent center of the root meristem that is essential for auxin distribution and patterning."

Here we show that the sequence motif FXXXXWIXXXXGIRAGP that includes a specific arrest point (Pro) causes elongation arrest within the ribosome. Mutations that bypass the elongation arrest were isolated in 23S rRNA and L22 r protein. Such suppressor mutations occurred at a few specific residues of these components, which all face the narrowest constriction of the ribosomal exit tunnel. Thus, we suggest that this region of the exit tunnel interacts with nascent translation products and functions as a discriminating gate."

https://openalex.org/W2029955024,"Ca(2+) signaling by calpains leads to controlled proteolysis during processes ranging from cytoskeleton remodeling in mammals to sex determination in nematodes. Deregulated Ca(2+) levels result in aberrant proteolysis by calpains, which contributes to tissue damage in heart and brain ischemias as well as neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease. Here we show that activation of the protease core of mu calpain requires cooperative binding of two Ca(2+) atoms at two non-EF-hand sites revealed in the 2.1 A crystal structure. Conservation of the Ca(2+) binding residues defines an ancestral general mechanism of activation for most calpain isoforms, including some that lack EF-hand domains. The protease region is not affected by the endogenous inhibitor, calpastatin, and may contribute to calpain-mediated pathologies when the core is released by autoproteolysis."
https://openalex.org/W2086785140,"We have used systematic fluorescence resonance energy transfer and distance-constrained docking to define the three-dimensional structures of bacterial RNA polymerase holoenzyme and the bacterial RNA polymerase-promoter open complex in solution. The structures provide a framework for understanding σ70-(RNA polymerase core), σ70-DNA, and σ70-RNA interactions. The positions of σ70 regions 1.2, 2, 3, and 4 are similar in holoenzyme and open complex. In contrast, the position of σ70 region 1.1 differs dramatically in holoenzyme and open complex. In holoenzyme, region 1.1 is located within the active-center cleft, apparently serving as a “molecular mimic” of DNA, but, in open complex, region 1.1 is located outside the active center cleft. The approach described here should be applicable to the analysis of other nanometer-scale complexes."

Werner protein (WRN) is a member of the recQ gene family, but unlike other members of the recQ family, it contains a unique 3′→5′ exonuclease activity. We have reported previously that human Ku heterodimer interacts physically with WRN and functionally stimulates WRN exonuclease activity. Because Ku and DNA-PKcs, the catalytic subunit of DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK), form a complex at DNA ends, we have now explored the possibility of functional modulation of WRN exonuclease activity by DNA-PK. We find that although DNA-PKcs alone does not affect the WRN exonuclease activity, the additional presence of Ku mediates a marked inhibition of it. The inhibition of WRN exonuclease by DNA-PKcs requires the kinase activity of DNA-PKcs. WRN is a target for DNA-PKcs phosphorylation, and this phosphorylation requires the presence of Ku. We also find that treatment of recombinant WRN with a Ser/Thr phosphatase enhances WRN exonuclease and helicase activities and that WRN catalytic activity can be inhibited by rephosphorylation of WRN with DNA-PK. Thus, the level of phosphorylation of WRN appears to regulate its catalytic activities. WRN forms a complex, both in vitro and in vivo, with DNA-PKC. WRN is phosphorylated in vivo after treatment of cells with DNA-damaging agents in a pathway that requires DNA-PKcs. Thus, WRN protein is a target for DNA-PK phosphorylation in vitro and in vivo, and this phosphorylation may be a way of regulating its different catalytic activities, possibly in the repair of DNA dsb.

Although WRN appears to play an important role in DNA metabolism, the precise cellular roles of both the helicase and exonuclease activities of WRN remain to be determined.

WS cells show hypersensitivity to selected DNA-damaging agents including 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide (4NQO) (9Ogburn C.E. Oshima J. Poot M. Chen R. Gollahon K.A. Rabinovitch P.S. Martin G.M. Hum.

FASEB J. 2001; 15: 1224-1226Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Compared with normal cells, WS cells also exhibit increased genomic instability including higher levels of DNA deletions, translocations, and chromosomal breaks (12Fukuchi K. Martin G.M. Monnat R.J.

Res. 1989; 219: 179-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). These studies suggest that WRN plays an important role in DNA metabolism possibly by participating in DNA repair, replication, and/or recombination pathways. We have previously identified a physical and functional interaction between WRN and the Ku heterodimer (14Cooper M.P. Machwe A. Orren D.K. Brosh R.M. Ramsden D. Bohr V.A. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 907-912PubMed Google Scholar). This finding has been confirmed recently by an independent laboratory (15Li B. Comai L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39800-39808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Google Scholar). Together with the catalytic subunit of the DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PKcs), Ku is required for repair of DNA double strand breaks (dsb) generated during recombination and by reactive oxygen species resulting from endogenous metabolism or treatment with ionizing radiation and certain mutagens (16Featherstone C. Jackson S.P. Mutat. Res. 1999; 434: 3-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that Ku significantly stimulates the 3′→5′ exonuclease activity of WRN (14Cooper M.P. Machwe A. Orren D.K. Brosh R.M. Ramsden D. Bohr V.A. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 907-912PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that WRN and Ku could act in a common pathway of DNA metabolism involving the exonuclease function of WRN. This hypothesis is supported by the observation that mice lacking the Ku80 subunit show a premature aging phenotype similar to that of WS patients (17Vogel H. Lim D.S. Karsenty G. Finegold M. Hasty P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10770-10775Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). Furthermore, cells deficient in WRN, Ku70, or Ku80 all show genomic instability and undergo premature replicative senescence (18Gu Y. Seidl K.J. Rathbun G.A. Zhu C. Manis J.P. van der Stoep N. Davidson L. Cheng H.L. Sekiguchi J.M. Frank K. Stanhope-Baker P. Schlissel M.S. Roth D.B. Alt F.W.

A. 1997; 94: 13588-13593Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). DNA dsb can be created by ionizing irradiation or during V(D)J recombination, a process that generates immunological diversity. One of the major pathways for the repair of dsb involves an end-rejoining reaction that requires DNA-PK. DNA-PK is composed of a 465-kDa catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs) and the Ku70/80 heterodimer (20Smith G.C. Jackson S.P. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 916-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (769) Google Scholar). The precise role of DNA-PK in DNA dsb repair in mammalian cells is not clear, but both Ku and DNA-PKcs are essential for the processing of DNA ends. Current models predict that Ku binds to ends of double-stranded DNA and then recruits DNA-PKcs to form the active protein kinase complex. DNA-PK is essential for efficient DNA dsb repair because cells lacking either DNA-PKcs or Ku are sensitive to ionizing radiation and defective in V(D)J recombination (20Smith G.C. Jackson S.P. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 916-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (769) Google Scholar). DNA-PK has been shown to phosphorylate a variety of proteins in vitro, including SP1, SV40 T antigen, p53, and replication protein A (20Smith G.C. Jackson S.P. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 916-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (769) Google Scholar, 21Jeggo P.A. Adv. Genet. 1998; 38: 185-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Although the kinase activity of DNA-PK is required in vivo(22Kurimasa A. Kumano S. Boubnov N.V. Story M.D. Tung C.S. Peterson S.R. Chen D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3877-3884Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar), its physiological substrates are not known. Because WRN has been shown to interact with Ku, we have explored its role in the DNA-PK damage response pathway. In this study we have examined functional interactions among WRN, Ku, and DNA-PKcs. We find that DNA-PKcs, Ku, and WRN interact on a DNA substrate and that DNA-PK down-regulates the exonuclease activity of WRN. Correspondingly, dephosphorylation of WRN increases its helicase and exonuclease activities. We also show that WRN is phosphorylated in vitro by DNA-PK and that DNA damage-induced phosphorylation of WRN is absent from a human cell that lacks DNA-PKcs. Our results would suggest that WRN may play a role in DNA-PK-mediated end rejoining. Amplified baculovirus was used to infect Sf9 insect cells for overexpression of WRN protein as described before (7Orren D.K. Brosh R.M., Jr. Nehlin J.O. Machwe A. Gray M.D. Bohr V.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 3557-3566Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The protein was purified by DEAE-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences), Q-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences), and nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Invitrogen) chromatography as described previously (7Orren D.K. Brosh R.M., Jr. Nehlin J.O. Machwe A. Gray M.D. Bohr V.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 3557-3566Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Human Ku heterodimer (23Nick McElhinny S.A. Snowden C.M. McCarville J. Ramsden D.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2996-3003Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar) and DNA-PKcs (24Chan D.W. Mody C.H. Ting N.S. Lees-Miller S.P. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1996; 74: 67-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) were purified as reported. The purity of these proteins was checked routinely, and they specifically did not contain any ATM protein (data not shown). Baculovirus constructs for hexahistidine-tagged full-length WRN protein were kindly provided by Dr. Mathew Gray (University of Washington, Seattle). Wortmannin and LY294002 were from Alexis Biochemicals. 4NQO was from Janssen Chemical. Bleomycin sulfate was from Sigma. T4 polynucleotide kinase was from New England Biolabs. Protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) was from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. [γ-32P]ATP was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. ATP was purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Single-stranded DNA oligomers (72-mer and 53-mer) were obtained from Invitrogen. 7 pmol of 53-mer was 5′-labeled with 60 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (3,000 Ci/mmol) and 10 units of polynucleotide kinase using standard conditions. To construct a double-stranded DNA substrate with one blunt end and one 3′-recessed (5′-overhang) end, labeled oligomer was mixed with a 2-fold excess of unlabeled 72-mer, heated together at 90 °C for 5 min, then cooled slowly to 25 °C. Annealed double-stranded substrates were then separated from unannealed and excess single-stranded oligomers by nondenaturing 12% PAGE. Intact double-stranded DNA substrates were recovered using a Qiaex II gel extraction kit (Qiagen) and stored at 4 °C. PAGE-purified 44-mer and 19-mer oligonucleotides were purchased from the Midland Certified Reagent Company. The 19-bp duplex substrate with a 25-nucleotide 3′-tail (3′-overhang DNA substrate) was constructed by labeling 10 pmol of 19-mer oligonucleotide (5′-GTAAAACGACGGCCAGTGC-3′) at its 5′-end using T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP. The labeled 19-mer was purified from unincorporated nucleotide by using a Microspin G-25 column from Amersham Biosciences. The 19-mer was mixed with 25 pmol of 44-mer oligonucleotide (5′-GCACTGGCCGTCGTTTTACGGTCGTGACTGGGAAAACCCTGGCG-3′) in 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8.0), 1 mm EDTA, heated at 100 °C for 5 min, then placed at 70 °C and allowed to cool slowly (∼2 h) to 24 °C. The 19-bp duplex substrate with a 26-nucleotide 5′-fork and 25-nucleotide 3′-tail (forked DNA substrate) was prepared using the same protocol except 10 pmol of 45-mer oligonucleotide (5′-TTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTCCAAGTAAAACGACGGCCAGTGC-3′) was annealed to 25 pmol of the 44-mer oligonucleotide described above. The assay to measure the 3′→5′ exonuclease activity of WRN was carried out in 10 μl at 37 °C with 40 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 0.1 mg/ml BSA, 10 mm ATP (25Machwe A. Ganunis R. Bohr V.A. Orren D.K. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 2762-2770Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). 3 fmol of exonuclease substrate was incubated with the indicated amount of Ku, DNA-PKcs, and WRN. The reactions were initiated by the addition of WRN and incubated at 37 °C for 60 min. Reactions were quenched by the addition of an equal volume of formamide loading buffer (80% formamide, 0.5× TBE, 0.1% bromphenol blue). The digestion products of these reactions were separated on denaturing 14% polyacrylamide gels and visualized using a PhosphorImager and quantitated using ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics). For DNA binding activity the solution conditions were the same as those used in the exonuclease assay. Approximately 3 fmol of32P-labeled exonuclease substrate was incubated on ice for 10 min with the indicated amount of Ku, DNA-PKcs, and WRN in buffer containing 40 mm Tris (pH 7.8), 5 mmMgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mg/ml BSA, and 10 mm ATP. 0.1% glutaraldehyde was added to the reaction, and incubation continued for 5 min more. 10 μl of DNA protein mixture was analyzed by 4% nondenaturing gel electrophoresis at 4 °C at 250 V with 1× Tris acetate buffer for 1.5 h. DNA was visualized using a PhosphorImager and analyzed using ImageQuant software. In vitro phosphorylation reactions were carried out either with the same exonuclease buffer and substrate or with kinase buffer (50 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 25 mm Hepes-KOH (pH 7.6), 5 mm MgCl2, 50 μm ATP) with 100 ng of sonicated calf thymus DNA and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. The reactions (10 μl) were initiated by the addition of DNA-PKcs and carried out at room temperature for 10 min. The reactions were stopped with the addition of 1 μl of 0.25 m EDTA. The resulting products were analyzed by electrophoresis on 4–12% acrylamide Tris-glycine gel (Invitrogen). The gel was washed and visualized as described above. 2 nm WRN (final concentration) was incubated with the indicated amounts of PP1 in a 15-μl reaction (40 mmHepes (pH 7.5), 7% glycerol, 50 mm KCl, 130 ng/μl BSA, 11 mm MgCl2, and 3 mm ATP). The reaction was incubated for 10 min at 24 °C. Immediately after the phosphatase reaction, 10 fmol of the DNA helicase substrate (5 μl) was added to the reaction for a final volume of 20 μl (30 mm Hepes (pH 7.5), 5% glycerol, 40 mm KCl, 100 ng/μl BSA, 8 mmMgCl2, and 2 mm ATP). The mixture was then incubated for 15 min at 37 °C. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 10 μl of 50 mm EDTA, 40% glycerol, 0.9% SDS, 0.1% bromphenol blue, and 0.1% xylene cyanol. The products of the helicase reaction were resolved by electrophoresis on 12% 1× TBE nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels. The radiolabeled DNA products were visualized using a PhosphorImager as described above. To determine the percentage of helicase substrate unwound, the following formula was used: % displacement = 100 × P/(S +P), where P is the product volume, and S is the substrate volume. The values for P and S were corrected by subtracting background values in the no-enzyme and heat-denatured controls, respectively. 123 fmol of WRN was incubated with 1 microunit of PP1 in a phosphatase reaction buffer (40 mm Hepes (pH 7.5), 7% glycerol, 50 mm KCl, 130 ng/μl BSA, and 11 mmMgCl2). The reaction was incubated for 10 min at 24 °C. In control reactions, phosphatase was omitted. Immediately after the phosphatase reaction, 100 ng of M13mp18 single-stranded DNA and 16 nmol of [3H]ATP were added to the reaction for a final volume of 20 μl (30 mm Hepes (pH 7.5), 5% glycerol, 40 mm KCl, 100 ng/μl BSA, 8 mmMgCl2). The reaction was then incubated for 15 min at 37 °C and subsequently quenched with the addition of 10 μl of stop solution (100 mm EDTA, 20 mm ATP, 20 mm ADP). Products of the ATPase reaction were resolved by thin layer chromatography and quantitated by scintillation counting. For the in vitro reaction, purified WRN, Ku, and DNA-PKcs were incubated with cold exonuclease substrate and buffer at 37 °C for 15 min. The reaction mixture was then incubated with either goat polyclonal anti-WRN (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or polyclonal anti DNA-PKcs (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 1 h at room temperature followed by a 1-h incubation with G protein. After washing the complex with 50 mm Hepes (pH 7.4) and 0.5% Triton X-100, the immunoprecipitated complex was separated in a 4–12% acrylamide Tris-glycine gel and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membrane was then incubated with mouse monoclonal anti-Ku70/Ku80 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, 1:500), mouse monoclonal anti-WRN (PharMingen, 1:250), and mouse monoclonal anti-DNA-PKcs (Oncogene, 1:1000) antibody overnight at 4 °C followed by a 1-h incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (1:10,000). The resulting signal was visualized with ECL plus a Western blotting detection system (Amersham Biosciences). Immunoprecipitation with total cell lysate was essentially the same as above; however, instead of purified proteins, cell lysate was used. Cell lysate was precleared with G protein-agarose prior to immunoprecipitation. HeLa cells were grown for 24 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. The human glioblastoma cell lines M059K (containing normal levels DNA-PKcs) and M059J (lacking expression of DNA-PKcs) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and F-12 medium (Invitrogen) with 15% fetal bovine serum. After 24 h, ∼2–5 × 106 cells were incubated with phosphate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 5% dialyzed fetal bovine serum for 1 h to exhaust the pool of endogenous phosphate. The cells were then freshly supplemented with phosphate-free medium containing 100 μCi of 32Pi (DuPont) for 5 h. In some experiments, DNA-damaging agents bleomycin (1 or 5 μg/ml) or 4NQO (0.1 or 0.5 μg/ml) were added during the incubation period. In some experiments, cells were incubated with 25 μm wortmannin. The radiolabeling was terminated by washing the cells with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. The cells were then lysed with RIPA buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton, 0.1% SDS, 10 mm Tris (pH 8), 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptine, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 units/ml DNase) supplemented with phosphatase inhibitors (1:1,000, Sigma). After centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C, the supernatant was precleared with G protein-agarose beads (Calbiochem) and incubated with 4 μg of polyclonal goat anti-WRN (from Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 4 h. The immune complexes were collected by adding G protein-agarose beads and washed three times with RIPA buffer. Immunoprecipitated proteins were analyzed on 8–16% acrylamide Tris-glycine gels. The gels were washed and visualized by autoradiography. We have shown previously that Ku can interact physically with WRN and functionally stimulate WRN 3′→5′ exonuclease activity (14Cooper M.P. Machwe A. Orren D.K. Brosh R.M. Ramsden D. Bohr V.A. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 907-912PubMed Google Scholar). Because Ku and DNA-PKcs are subunits of DNA-PK, which is involved in the repair of DNA dsb, we explored the possibility that WRN exonuclease activity is modulated by DNA-PKcs. The exonuclease activity of WRN was assayed using a duplex DNA substrate containing a 5′-labeled, recessed 3′-end and one blunt end. DNA-PKcs alone has no effect on WRN exonuclease activity even at higher molar ratios (3.5:1) of DNA-PKcs to WRN (data not shown). Because Ku functionally modulates the activities of both WRN and DNA-PKcs, we assayed for the modulation of WRN exonuclease activity by DNA-PK. In Fig. 1 A, 15 nm Ku and 15 nm WRN were incubated in the presence of different amounts of DNA-PKcs (2.5, 5, 10, and 15 nm) and exonuclease substrate in kinase buffer. 15 nm Ku alone or 15 nm DNA-PKcs alone has no effect on the substrate (lanes 2 and 3, respectively). WRN exonuclease activity was not altered by equimolar amounts of DNA-PKcs (lane 5). In lane 6, it was observed that Ku stimulated WRN exonuclease activity, as the degradation products were smaller in molecular size. We have reported this stimulation previously (14Cooper M.P. Machwe A. Orren D.K. Brosh R.M. Ramsden D. Bohr V.A. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 907-912PubMed Google Scholar). To address the possibility that Ku heterodimer stimulates WRN exonuclease activity by enhancing the processivity of WRN exonuclease, we conducted unlabeled DNA competitor experiments. Unlabeled DNA substrate added in increasing amounts to ongoing WRN exonuclease reactions effectively quenched the WRN exonuclease reactions in the absence of Ku; however, the presence of Ku rendered the WRN exonuclease reaction resistant to quenching by a 10-fold molar excess of unlabeled DNA substrate (data not shown). These results suggest that the effect of Ku on WRN exonuclease is to render the enzyme more processive.Figure 1WRN exonuclease activity is inhibited by DNA-PKcs only in the presence of Ku. A, 15 nm Werner protein was incubated with 3 fmol of exonuclease substrate in kinase buffer with 15 nm Ku and 0, 2.5, 5, 10, or 15 nm DNA-PKcs. The products were separated by 14% polyacrylamide gels under denaturing conditions and visualized by phosphorimaging.

At the highest concentration of DNA-PKcs used (corresponding to equimolar amounts of DNA-PKcs, Ku, and WRN) the WRN exonuclease activity was inhibited strongly (Fig. 1, lane 10). Similar results were also observed when kinase buffer was replaced by exonuclease buffer (data not shown). In Fig. 1 B, we have scanned the lanes from the gel in Fig. 1 A. It is evident from the patterns of digestion products shown by the scan analysis that DNA-PK inhibited WRN exonuclease activity. We also calculated the exonuclease activity based on the amount of undigested (full-length) substrate. It was 0.184 ± 0.12% fmol in the presence of 15 nm WRN. When 15 nm Ku was present this became 0.1 ± 0.5%, and in the additional presence of 5, 10, and 15 nm DNA-PKcs, it became 0.55 ± 0.14, 0.8 ± 0.15, and 1.38 ± 0.28%, respectively. The fraction of digested product (≤20-mer) for the reaction containing WRN alone or WRN + DNA-PKcs was 42 ± 4 and 44 ± 6%, respectively. In the presence of Ku and WRN this fraction became 64 ± 6%. The addition of 5, 10, and 15 nm DNA-PKcs to the exonuclease reactions containing WRN and Ku yielded values of 57 ± 7, 48 ± 5, and 36 ± 6%, respectively, for products ≤20-mer. These data, representing an average of three experiments, clearly demonstrate that DNA-PKcs and Ku together effectively inhibit the WRN exonuclease reaction. The addition of DNA-PKcs inhibits the ability of Ku alone to stimulate WRN exonuclease activity, instead reducing exonuclease activity to levels less than observed with WRN alone. DNA-bound Ku is required for maximal stimulation of the protein kinase activity of DNA-PKcs (26Dynan W.S. Yoo S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 1551-1559Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar), and the protein kinase activity of DNA-PK is inhibited by 50–100 nm wortmannin or 50–100 μm LY294002 (27Izzard R.A. Jackson S.P. Smith G.C. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 2581-2586PubMed Google Scholar). The presence of wortmannin or LY294002 in the Ku/DNA-PKcs/WRN incubation reaction prevented the DNA-PK-dependent inhibition of WRN exonuclease activity (Fig. 2 A, lanes 6 and 7). DNA-PKcs was preincubated with 100 nmwortmannin and 100 μm LY294002 to inhibit the DNA-PKcs kinase activity completely. In lane 3, it is shown again that DNA-PKcs itself did not affect the WRN exonuclease activity, whereas the inhibition of the exonuclease in the presence of Ku and DNA-PKcs was observed (lane 5). Neither wortmannin nor LY294002 had any effect on WRN exonuclease activity or the Ku stimulation of the WRN exonuclease activity (data not shown). Thus, it appears that the protein kinase activity of DNA-PK is essential for the inactivation of WRN exonuclease activity. To confirm that the protein kinase activity of DNA-PKcs was essential for inhibition of WRN exonuclease activity, we tested a form of DNA-PK which is defective in protein kinase activity. The C-terminal 12 amino acids of Ku80 have been shown to be essential for the interaction of DNA-PKcs with Ku (28Gell D. Jackson S.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 3494-3502Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). A mutant form of the Ku heterodimer with full-length Ku70 but missing the C-terminal 162 amino acids of Ku80 (Ku70/80ΔC) is fully able to bind DNA but does not support DNA-PK protein kinase activity. 2C. M. Snowden and D. A. Ramsden, unpublished observations. When this mutant form of Ku was incubated with WRN and DNA-PKcs, there was no inhibition of WRN exonuclease activity (Fig. 2 B). These data support the hypothesis that the active DNA-PK (DNA-PKcs + Ku) is required for abrogation of the exonuclease activity of WRN. We next tested whether WRN is a substrate of DNA-PK. Different combinations of WRN, Ku, and DNA-PKcs were incubated with sonicated calf thymus DNA as an effector and with [γ-32P]ATP (Fig3). Fig. 3 shows that WRN is phosphorylated only in the presence of both Ku and DNA-PKcs but not by either Ku or DNA-PKcs alone (lanes 1 and 2). The presence of wortmannin inhibited the phosphorylation of the four proteins (lane 5). DNA-PK phosphorylated Ku and autophosphorylated itself only when Ku was present (lane 3). Thus, we show that WRN can be phosphorylated by DNA-PK in vitro and that Ku is required for this phosphorylation. Phosphorylation of DNA-PKcs, Ku70, and Ku80 (Fig. 3, lane 3) represents autophosphorylation of DNA-PK (29Chan D.W. Lees-Miller S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8936-8941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). The WRN phosphorylation by DNA-PK was also confirmed under the reaction conditions for the exonuclease activity assay (data not shown), providing further evidence for the correlation between WRN phosphorylation and inhibition of its exonuclease activity. To explore further the potential interactions among WRN, Ku, and DNA-PKcs, we conducted electrophoresis mobility shift assays, using the same buffers and substrate conditions as in the WRN exonuclease assay (Fig. 4). 5 nm Ku and 5 nm WRN were incubated with 1, 2.5, and 5 nmDNA-PKcs in the presence of exonuclease DNA substrate on ice for 10 min, and the resulting products were separated on 4% native polyacrylamide gels. Many studies have shown that Ku interacts with DNA substrates to form protein·DNA complexes in electrophoresis mobility shift assays. However, DNA-PKcs does not interact with DNA in this assay, and the"

Disk membranes with varying cholesterol concentrations were prepared using methyl-β-cyclodextrin as a cholesterol donor or acceptor. Cholesterol exchange followed a simple equilibrium partitioning model with a partition coefficient of 5.2 ± 0.8 in favor of the disk membrane. Reduced cholesterol in disk membranes resulted in a higher proportion of photolyzed rhodopsin being converted to the G protein-activating metarhodopsin II (MII) conformation, whereas enrichment of cholesterol reduced the extent of MII formation. Time-resolved fluorescence anisotropy measurements using 1,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene showed that increasing cholesterol reduced membrane acyl chain packing free volume as characterized by the parameter fv. The level of MII formed showed a positive linear correlation with fv over the range of 4 to 38 mol % cholesterol. In addition, the thermal stability of rhodopsin increased with mol % of cholesterol in disk membranes. No evidence was observed for the direct interaction of cholesterol with rhodopsin in either its agonist- or antagonist-bound form. These results indicate that cholesterol mediates the function of the G protein-coupled receptor, rhodopsin, by influencing membrane lipid properties, i.e. reducing acyl chain packing free volume, rather than interacting specifically with rhodopsin.

Currently, two mechanisms are generally discussed regarding the effect of cholesterol on membrane protein function. These are either a specific cholesterol-membrane protein interaction (3Gimpl G.

Discrimination between these two mechanisms requires concomitant characterization of the influence of cholesterol on membrane bilayer structural properties and protein function. In this study, the visual system, a prototypical G protein-coupled receptor system, is studied to determine the effect of varied cholesterol content in the native ROS 1The abbreviations used are: ROSrod outer segmentDHAdocosahexanoic acidDPH1,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-hexatrieneDSCdifferential scanning calorimetryfvphospholipid acyl chain packing free volumeMBCDmethyl-β-cyclodextrinMImetarhodopsin IMIImetarhodopsin IIKeqMI-MII equilibrium constantPCphosphatidylcholineTBSTris-buffered salinePIPES1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid disk membrane on receptor activation. In visual transduction, rhodopsin serves as the receptor, and light activates rhodopsin by converting its covalently bound antagonist, 11-cis retinal, to its agonist, all-trans retinal (9Litman B.J. Mitchell D.C. Lee A. Biomembranes. JAI Press, Greenwich, CT1996: 1-32Google Scholar). Within milliseconds of light absorption, MII, the photointermediate that binds and activates the visual G protein transducin, is formed and exists in a metastable equilibrium with its inactive precursor, MI. Previous studies in reconstituted systems clearly demonstrate that the formation of MII is strongly dependent on the physical properties of bilayer lipids (7Mitchell D.C. Straume M. Litman B.J.

Hennessey T. Albert A.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8151-8155Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The basal disks, which are newly formed, contain 30 mol % cholesterol, whereas the apical disks contain only 5 mol % cholesterol (11Boesze-Battaglia K. Hennessey T. Albert A.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8151-8155Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The physiological role of the cholesterol gradient is unclear, although it may be important to visual signal transduction because higher cholesterol is linked to reduced phosphodiesterase activity downstream in the visual cascade (12Boesze-Battaglia K. Albert A.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20727-20730Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The disk membrane is also unusual in that approximately 50% of the phospholipid acyl chains are derived from docosahexanoic acid (DHA), making the disk one of the most polyunsaturated membranes in the human body (13Stinson A.M. Wiegand R.D. Anderson R.E. Exp. Eye Res. 1991; 52: 213-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 14Yuan C. Chen H. Anderson R.E. Kuwata O. Ebrey T.G. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. B Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1998; 120: 785-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The major lipid classes in the disk membrane are phosphatidylcholine (PC), phosphatidylenthanolamine, and phosphatidylserine at 40, 41, and 12.5 mol %, respectively (13Stinson A.M. Wiegand R.D. Anderson R.E. Exp. Eye Res. 1991; 52: 213-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 14Yuan C. Chen H. Anderson R.E. Kuwata O. Ebrey T.G. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. B Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1998; 120: 785-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The disk also contains low levels of phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidic acid, and diacylglycerol and insignificant amounts of sphingomyelin. The major protein in disk membranes is rhodopsin, which accounts for >90% of the total membrane protein (15Smith H.G.J. Litman B.J. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 81: 57-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 16Papermaster D.S. Dreyer W.J. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 2438-2444Crossref PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar). Rhodopsin is the best characterized G protein-coupled receptor in terms of structure and function (17Palczewski K. Kumasaka T. Hori T. Behnke C.A. Motoshima H. Fox B.A. Trong I.L. Teller D.C.

Sci. 2001; 42: 3-9PubMed Google Scholar), which makes the disk membrane an ideal system for investigating the mechanism whereby cholesterol modulates receptor function. In this study, disk membranes varying in cholesterol concentration were prepared using methyl-β-cyclodextrin (MBCD) as a cholesterol donor or acceptor. The influence of cholesterol on rhodopsin activation was characterized by examining the conformational equilibrium between MI and MII. The effect of cholesterol on membrane acyl chain packing was characterized using the time-resolved decay of the fluorescence anisotropy of DPH (19Straume M. Litman B.J. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 5113-5120Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 20Mitchell D.C. Litman B.J. Biophys. J. 1998; 75: 896-908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Examining the cholesterol dependence of the absorption spectrum of the dark-adapted and light-activated states of rhodopsin allowed an assessment of any cholesterol-induced structural perturbation in the intrahelical binding pocket of the retinal chromophore. Perturbation of the overall structural stability of rhodopsin by cholesterol was assessed using DSC to measure the thermal denaturation of rhodopsin. Our results demonstrate that cholesterol inhibits rhodopsin activation by reducing the equilibrium concentration of MII in the absence of direct interaction with rhodopsin; however, this effect is linked directly to cholesterol-induced reductions in membrane acyl chain packing free volume. These results indicate that cholesterol modulates rhodopsin activation by influencing membrane phospholipid acyl chain packing rather than via direct interaction with rhodopsin. Cholesterol and MBCD were purchased from Sigma. Cholesterol-MBCD complex was prepared by premixing cholesterol and MBCD as solids (weight ratio of 1:20) followed by solubilization in degassed TBS buffer consisting of 10 mmTris, 60 mm NaCl, 30 mm KCl, 50 μm diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid, pH 7.5. The solution was sealed in argon and shaken at room temperature overnight. The final solution was filtered through a 0.45-μm filter and assayed for final cholesterol concentration (21Allain C.C. Poon L.S. Chan C.S. Richmond W. Fu P.C. Clin. Chem. 1974; 20: 470-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (7358) Google Scholar). Cholesterol CII assay kit was from WAKO (Richmond, VA). BCA protein assay kit and Coomassie Plus protein assay kit were from Pierce. ROS were isolated from frozen bovine retinas (James and Wanda Lawson, Lincoln, NE) as described by Miller et al. (22Miller J.L. Fox D.A. Litman B.J. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 4983-4988Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Intact disk membranes were prepared using the Ficoll floatation method (15Smith H.G.J. Litman B.J. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 81: 57-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Unless otherwise stated, all disk manipulations and measurements were conducted under argon in the dark with the aid of night vision goggles. Cholesterol-depleted disk membranes were prepared by incubating disk membranes with various concentrations of MBCD (0–40 mm) in TBS buffer, pH 7.5. Samples were incubated at room temperature in the dark for 2 h on a shaker. Measurements of disk cholesterol content at several time points indicated that 2 h was a sufficient incubation time to reach equilibrium for cholesterol exchange between disk membranes and MBCD (data not shown). The MBCD-treated disk membranes were then separated from MBCD by centrifugation followed by two additional washes in TBS buffer. The membrane pellet and MBCD-containing supernatant were assayed for cholesterol (21Allain C.C. Poon L.S. Chan C.S. Richmond W. Fu P.C. Clin. Chem. 1974; 20: 470-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (7358) Google Scholar), phospholipids (23Bartlett G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1959; 234: 587-596Google Scholar), and rhodopsin (24Jackson M.L. Litman B.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 812: 369-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 25Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-272Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the mole percentage of cholesterol to total phospholipids in disk membranes was determined. Cholesterol-enriched disk membranes were prepared similarly, except that disk membranes were incubated with cholesterol-loaded MBCD (0–1.2 mm cholesterol in 10 mm MBCD). The mole percentage of cholesterol in samples prepared in this study were used as follows: 4, 12, 15, and 38 mol %, where the 15 mol % cholesterol sample was the native disk membrane without MBCD treatment. Disk membranes were extruded through 0.2-μm membranes using a LiposoFast extruder (Avestin, Ottawa, Canada) to reduce light scattering. The final sample was suspended at 0.3 mg/ml in pH 7.5 TBS buffer for UV-visible absorption measurements. Briefly, 110-μl samples were equilibrated in a quartz cuvette for 5 min at 37 °C in the dark. Four spectra of each sample were recorded at the following time points: 1) after temperature equilibration in the dark; 2) 3 s after the sample was partially bleached (20–30%) by a flash lamp equipped with a 520-nm broad bandpass filter; 3) after incubation with 30 mmhydroxylamine for 10 min; 4) after the sample was fully bleached. The first absorption spectrum is of dark-adapted rhodopsin. Within milliseconds, photoexcited rhodopsin exists in a metastable equilibrium between MI and MII. The equilibrium spectra of MI and MII and associated Keq were determined by taking appropriate difference spectra as previously described (26Niu S.L. Mitchell D.C. Litman B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42807-42811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Samples for fluorescence measurements were made immediately prior to use by diluting a concentrated disk solution to 100 μm phospholipid and adding 0.3 μl of DPH in tetrahydrofuran to yield a final phospholipid/DPH ratio of 300:1. Argon was streamed into the cuvette during this entire process, and the added tetrahydrofuran was allowed to evaporate by continuing the argon stream for several minutes following addition of DPH. All samples were incubated at 40 °C in darkness for 1 h before being brought to 37 °C for measurement. Total optical density (scatter plus absorption) at the wavelength of fluorescence excitation was less than 0.1. Fluorescence lifetime and differential polarization measurements were performed with a K2 multifrequency cross-correlation phase fluorimeter (ISS, Urbana, IL). Excitation at 351 nm was provided by an Innova 307 argon ion laser (Coherent Radiation, Palo Alto, CA). Lifetime and differential polarization data were acquired at 15 modulation frequencies, logarithmically spaced from 5 to 200 MHz using decay acquisition software from ISS as previously described (20Mitchell D.C. Litman B.J. Biophys. J. 1998; 75: 896-908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Both total intensity decay and differential polarization measurements were repeated with each cholesterol composition a minimum of three times. Total fluorescence intensity decays were modeled as the sum of two discrete exponential decays. To compare the effects of cholesterol content on the average fluorescence lifetime, the intensity-weighted average fluorescence lifetime <τ> was calculated. Measured polarization-dependent differential phases and modulation ratios for each sample were combined with the measured total intensity decay to yield the anisotropy decay, r(t). An empirical description of all anisotropy decays was obtained via analysis in terms of a simple sum of exponentials of the form shown in Equation1,r(t)=(ro−r)(β1exp(−t/φ1)+β2exp(−t/φ2))+rEquation 1 where ro is the fluorescence anisotropy at t = 0, r∞ is the non-decaying anisotropy remaining at the longest time measured in the experiment, φ1 is the rotational correlation time, and β1 is the functional contribution of each exponential term. The empirical sum of exponentials model provides information about fluorophore rotational correlation times and the extent to which the fluorescence anisotropy can decay to zero. However, it provides no information regarding the range of equilibrium angular orientations to which DPH is restricted by the surrounding matrix of phospholipid acyl chains. Therefore all data were also analyzed using the Brownian rotational diffusion model as previously described (20Mitchell D.C. Litman B.J. Biophys. J. 1998; 75: 896-908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). It is useful to calculate a single parameter that corresponds to the extent to which the equilibrium orientational freedom of DPH is restricted by the phospholipid acyl chains. Such a parameter is ƒv, which is directly proportional to the extent to which DPH is randomly oriented in the membrane (19Straume M. Litman B.J. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 5113-5120Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 27Mitchell D.C. Litman B.J. Biophys. J. 1998; 74: 879-891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). All analyses of differential polarization data were performed with NONLIN (10Straume M. Mitchell D.C. Miller J.L. Litman B.J. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 9135-9142Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 28Johnson M.L. Faunt L.M. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 210:1–37: 1-37Google Scholar), and subroutines specifying the fitting function were written by the authors. DSC measurements were performed in a Nano-scan II calorimeter (Calorimetry Sciences, Provo, UT). Disk membranes at a concentration of 1.0 mg/ml rhodopsin in pH 7.0 PIPES basic salt (PIBS) buffer containing 10 mm PIPES, 60 mm KCl, 30 mm NaCl, and 50 μmdiethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid were degassed and loaded into sample cells in complete darkness. The cell was sealed under a stream of argon and pressurized to 2.8 atm. After temperature equilibration was reached, samples were scanned at 0.5 °C/min, and the data were analyzed using Cp-Cal 2.1 provided by Calorimetry Sciences. The native ROS disk membrane preparation contained 15 mol % cholesterol. Incubation of disk membranes with increasing amounts of MBCD resulted in a successive depletion of cholesterol from disk membranes (Fig. 1A). In the presence of 10 mm MBCD mixed with 1 mm disk membrane phospholipids, 65% of cholesterol was removed from disk membranes. Higher concentration of MBCD resulted in a further depletion of cholesterol from disk membranes. Control experiments were conducted to evaluate the potential risks for co-removal of phospholipids and rhodopsin from disk membranes by MBCD. No rhodopsin was extracted from disk membranes in the presence of MBCD up to 40 mm, indicating that MBCD has no affinity for rhodopsin relative to disk membranes. However, a small fraction of phospholipids was extracted from disk membranes at lower MBCD concentrations (Table I). The amount of phospholipids extracted became significant at concentrations of MBCD above 15 mm. We used 10 mm MBCD in all cholesterol depletion preparations to maximize the removal of cholesterol while minimizing the extraction of phospholipids.Table IAmount of phospholipids extracted from disk membranes by MBCD[MBCD]phospholipids extracted from disk membranes by MBCDmM%1-aThe number in parentheses is ± S.D.00.0 (± 0.2)50.8 (± 0.1)101.4 (± 0.1)151.8 (± 0.1)204.3 (± 0.3)258.0 (± 0.7)308.6 (± 0.5)1-a The number in parentheses is ± S.D. Open table in a new tab Analysis of the data in Fig. 1A (according to a simple equilibrium partitioning model) resulted in a partition coefficient of 5.2 ± 0.8, indicating that under conditions of equal amounts of disk membrane and MBCD, cholesterol partitions 5.2-fold higher into disk membranes than into MBCD. The equilibrium partition model was tested by enriching the amount of cholesterol in disk membranes by incubating them with 10 mm MBCD preloaded with various amounts of cholesterol. The agreement between observed levels of cholesterol enrichment and the levels calculated from the equilibrium partition model as shown in Fig. 1B confirm that an equilibrium-partition model is followed for cholesterol exchange between MBCD and disk membranes. Using the combination of MBCD and cholesterol-MBCD complex, we were able to manipulate the cholesterol concentration in disk membranes in a wide range. The effect of membrane cholesterol on rhodopsin activation was investigated in disk membranes by varying the membrane cholesterol concentration. Overall, an inverse correlation between membrane cholesterol content and Keq for the MI-MII equilibrium was observed at 37 °C, as shown in Fig. 2. In control disk membranes the cholesterol concentration was 15 mol %, and Keq was 0.81 ± 0.08. In cholesterol-depleted disk membranes, which have a cholesterol level of 4 mol %, similar to the 5 mol % found in disks in the apical portion of the ROS, Keq was 1.00 ± 0.10. In disk membranes containing 31 mol % cholesterol, which correspond to cholesterol levels of the basal disks in the ROS,Keq was reduced to 0.73 ± 0.11. At physiological temperature, the cholesterol gradient in ROS, which spans from 5 to 30 mol %, corresponds to a shift in Gibbs free energy (ΔG) associated with MI-MII equilibrium toward a more positive value by 189 cal/mol, resulting in the formation of approximately 17% less MII. Variation in cholesterol content of disk membranes resulted in substantial changes in the motional and orientational properties of the hydrophobic fluorescence probe DPH as well as the DPH fluorescence lifetime. The intensity-weighted average fluorescence lifetime of DPH varied directly with membrane cholesterol content and ranged from <τ> of 7.7 ± 0.1 ns for 4 mol % cholesterol to <τ> of 9.8 ± 0.1 ns for 38 mol % cholesterol at 37 °C (Fig. 3A). The magnitude of the increase in DPH fluorescence lifetime with increased cholesterol is very similar to what is observed in pure lipid bilayers (20Mitchell D.C. Litman B.J. Biophys. J. 1998; 75: 896-908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), and it reflects cholesterol-induced reduction in water penetration. Alteration in the rate of DPH motion with changes in membrane cholesterol content is indicated by changes in D⊥, the diffusion constant for DPH rotation about its long axis (obtained from the Brownian rotational diffusion model). Depletion of cholesterol increased D⊥, indicating more rapid rotational motion of DPH, whereas cholesterol enrichment reduced D⊥ as shown in Fig. 3B. A series of studies demonstrate that the overall orientational order of DPH in a phospholipid bilayer is well summarized by the parameter fv, a measure of phospholipid acyl chain packing free volume (19Straume M. Litman B.J. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 5113-5120Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 20Mitchell D.C. Litman B.J. Biophys. J. 1998; 75: 896-908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The untreated disk membranes had a cholesterol content of 15 mol %. At 37 °C upon reduction of membrane cholesterol to 4 mol %, fv increased by 45%, whereas enrichment of cholesterol to 38 mol % reduced fv by 30% as shown in Fig. 3C. Intermediate cholesterol contents had varied fv values within this range. Previous studies show that this reduction in fv corresponds to a significant decrease in acyl chain packing free volume comparable with the change in acyl chain packing induced by a reduction in temperature of 10 °C. The absorption spectrum of the retinal chromophore in rhodopsin is determined by its interactions with the amino acid side chains of opsin and is therefore sensitive to protein conformational changes in the intrahelical retinal-binding site (29Lewis J.W. Kliger D.S. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1992; 24: 201-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 30Yoshizawa T. Shichida Y. Matuoka S. Vision Res. 1984; 24: 1455-1463Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Changes in any rhodopsin absorption spectrum in disks with variation in cholesterol content would reveal the structural perturbation in the intrahelical domain of rhodopsin induced by cholesterol. Depletion or enrichment of cholesterol in disk membranes had no effect on the absorption spectrum of dark-adapted rhodopsin, which has an absorption maximum at 498 nm (Fig. 4A). The absorption spectrum of photoactivated rhodopsin is established within tens of milliseconds and consists of two absorbing species, MI (490 nm) and MII (388 nm), which exist in a metastable equilibrium. The absorption peaks of both MI and MII were unchanged by cholesterol depletion or enrichment in disk membranes (Fig. 4B). However, relative intensities of the MI and MII absorption bands were shifted by cholesterol manipulation, reflecting the modulation of Keq by cholesterol. Because cholesterol enrichment or depletion induced no shift in the absorption peak position of either dark-adapted or light-activated rhodopsin, specific interaction between cholesterol and rhodopsin could be ruled out. The thermal unfolding of rhodopsin in ROS disk membranes was examined via DSC. Overall, increased cholesterol levels in disk membranes resulted in a higher transition temperature for the thermal denaturation of rhodopsin. In control disk membranes that had not been exposed to MBCD rhodopsin underwent thermal unfolding at 74.2 ± 0.05 °C, in close agreement with previous investigations (31Polozova A. Litman B.J. Biophys. J. 2000; 79: 2632-2643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Addition of cholesterol to 38 mol % raised the thermal unfolding temperature of rhodopsin to 74.8 °C, and depletion of cholesterol to 4 mol % lowered the thermal unfolding temperature to 73.7 °C as shown in Fig. 5. Our results demonstrate that disk membranes can be depleted or enriched with cholesterol using MBCD as a cholesterol donor or acceptor. This method has advantages of shorter preparation time, wider ranges of cholesterol concentrations achieved in disk membranes, and more quantitative data when compared with the previous method of manipulating the cholesterol content of disk membranes using phospholipid vesicles (32Albert A.D. Boesze-Battaglia K. Paw Z. Watts A. Epand R.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1297: 77-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Cholesterol exchange between disk membranes and MBCD was found to follow an equilibrium-partition model with a partition coefficient of 5.2 in favor of the disk membrane. The same model may also apply to other cellular membranes in which MBCD is used to manipulate membrane cholesterol. However, MBCD should be used with caution because it was found to bind phospholipids as well, especially at concentrations of MBCD greater than 15 mm (Table I). If significant amounts of phospholipid are extracted from membranes by MBCD, membrane structure may be disturbed unintentionally. Thus, effects caused by a loss of phospholipid may inadvertently be attributed to changes in cholesterol concentration. A general guideline for preparation of cholesterol-depleted membranes is to use a high molar ratio of MBCD/membrane phospholipid (up to 10:1) to maximize the transfer of cholesterol from membranes to MBCD. For preparation of cholesterol-enriched membranes a low ratio of MBCD/membrane phospholipid and a high donor cholesterol concentration should be used to maximize transfer of cholesterol from MBCD to membranes. Elevated cholesterol levels in disk membranes correlated with lower values of Keq for the MI-MII equilibrium, which is consistent with studies in reconstituted rhodopsin-containing model membranes (33Mitchell D.C. Straume M. Miller J.L. Litman B.J. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 9143-9149Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The highest Keq values were observed in disk membranes containing the lowest amount of cholesterol (4 mol %), which infers a physiological consequence of the cholesterol gradient along the stack of disks in ROS (11Boesze-Battaglia K. Hennessey T. Albert A.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8151-8155Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The basal disks contain the highest amount of cholesterol (30 mol %), which should have lower Keq values. These disks are gradually depleted of cholesterol as they move to the top of the stack. The apical disks contain only 5 mol % cholesterol so that increased rhodopsin activation is achieved. Because visual signaling is transferred from rhodopsin to phosphodiesterase via coupling to transducin, the cholesterol effect on rhodopsin activation would likely be propagated along the signaling cascade. This is consistent with a study by Boesze-Battaglia and Albert (12Boesze-Battaglia K. Albert A.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20727-20730Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in which a lower phosphodiesterase activity was observed in disks with higher cholesterol levels. Cholesterol alters the function of a variety of receptors and channels (1Nunez M.T. Glass J. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 4139-4143Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 2Fernandez-Ballester G.

The current mechanistic views on cholesterol-induced effects on membrane protein function fall into the following two categories: 1) modulation by specific cholesterol-protein interaction and 2) modulation via cholesterol-induced changes in phospholipid acyl chain packing. To date most studies have focused on changes in protein function upon cholesterol removal and/or enrichment (1Nunez M.T. Glass J. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 4139-4143Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 2Fernandez-Ballester G. Castresana J. Fernandez A.M. Arrondo J.L. Ferragut J.A. Gonzales-Ros J.M.

Res. 1997; 33: 272-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Perturbations of protein structure or membrane physical properties by cholesterol have been largely unexamined in native membranes under physiological conditions. A remaining challenge for those systems reported to involve specific interactions with cholesterol is to characterize the nature of such interaction sites. In this study the variation in acyl chain packing in native disk membranes induced by cholesterol was examined using the time-resolved decay of fluorescence anisotropy of DPH. Cholesterol depletion or enrichment resulted in substantial changes in the motional and orientational properties of DPH, suggesting large structural perturbations in disk membrane phospholipids by cholesterol. Membrane fv was reduced by cholesterol enrichment, which is consistent with previous studies in model membranes, demonstrating that cholesterol induces increased order in phospholipid acyl chain packing (20Mitchell D.C. Litman B.J. Biophys. J. 1998; 75: 896-908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 34Straume M. Litman B.J. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 5121-5126Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The retinal chromophore of rhodopsin acts as an excellent reporter of several important conformation changes that occur during formation of the active MII state that binds transducin, the visual G protein. During the activation process, rhodopsin proceeds through a series of photointermediates with distinct conformations, and changes in chromophore conformation and protein-induced electrostatic environment result in distinct absorption spectra for each intermediate (29Lewis J.W. Kliger D.S. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1992; 24: 201-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 30Yoshizawa T. Shichida Y. Matuoka S. Vision Res. 1984; 24: 1455-1463Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In this study the effects of membrane cholesterol on the absorption spectra of three important conformational states of rhodopsin were examined. Dark-adapted rhodopsin is equivalent to an antagonist-bound state, whereas MI is an agonist-bound inactive conformation, and MII is the agonist-bound active conformation that participates in visual signal transduction. The absorption spectra of these three conformational states was unaffected by cholesterol over the entire range of membrane cholesterol concentrations examined as shown in Fig. 4. The lack of variation in the absorption maxima of agonist- or antagonist-bound rhodopsin indicates that no protein conformational changes in the intrahelical retinal-binding domain are induced by cholesterol. Accordingly, specific cholesterol-rhodopsin interactions are unlikely to be involved in the inhibition of rhodopsin conformation changes by cholesterol. Another line of evidence relative to rhodopsin-cholesterol interactions comes from studies of the effects of membrane cholesterol on acyl chain packing free volume as quantified by fv and formation of the active MII conformation as quantified by Keq. These quantities are linearly related over the entire range of cholesterol concentrations examined, which was from 4 to 38 mol % (Fig. 6). A linear correlation between Keq and fv with changes in bilayer cholesterol was observed previously in studies of rhodopsin reconstituted in phospholipid membranes (33Mitchell D.C. Straume M. Miller J.L. Litman B.J. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 9143-9149Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). It is significant that the correlation shown in Fig. 6 was obtained for measurements at 37 °C, demonstrating that at physiological temperature cholesterol-induced changes in acyl chain packing and rhodopsin activation are tightly coupled. A reduction of membrane free volume would impose an energy barrier to the MI to MII transition, which is accompanied by a 100 ml/mole volume expansion (35Attwood P.V. Gutfreund H. FEBS Lett. 1980; 119: 323-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 36Lamola A.A. Yamane T. Zipp A. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 738-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), that would reduce the equilibrium concentration of MII, the active conformation of photoexcited rhodopsin. The effect of reduced free volume in the disk membrane with cholesterol enrichment on rhodopsin conformational flexibility is also demonstrated by the higher thermal stability of rhodopsin in the presence of more ordered acyl chain packing as shown in Fig. 5 and previously by Albert et al. (32Albert A.D. Boesze-Battaglia K. Paw Z. Watts A. Epand R.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1297: 77-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Given that cholesterol had no observable structural perturbation on rhodopsin and that Keq and fv are linearly correlated over the entire range of membrane cholesterol concentration, we conclude that cholesterol inhibits rhodopsin activation via an indirect effect of cholesterol on phospholipid acyl chain packing (i.e. by a free volume-mediated mechanism). A recent study reports that rod outer segment membranes contain detergent-resistant membranes or lipid rafts (37Seno K. Kishimoto M. Abe M. Higuchi Y. Mieda M. Owada Y. Yoshiyama W. Liu H. Hayashi F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20813-20816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). This term is generally applied to microdomains enriched in cholesterol and sphingomyelin, which are insoluble in mild Triton X-100 at 4 °C (38London E. Brown D.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1508: 182-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar,39Simons K. Ikonen E. Nature. 1997; 387: 569-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (8116) Google Scholar). The observation relative to ROS disk membranes is unusual in that these membranes contain insignificant amounts of sphingomyelin (13Stinson A.M. Wiegand R.D. Anderson R.E. Exp. Eye Res. 1991; 52: 213-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar,14Yuan C. Chen H. Anderson R.E. Kuwata O. Ebrey T.G. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. B Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1998; 120: 785-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The results presented in the current study demonstrate that disk membrane cholesterol concentration is inversely correlated with rhodopsin activation as measured by the extent of MII formation. Reducing disk cholesterol from 15 to 4 mol %, which should disrupt or reduce lipid raft formation, actually resulted in higher levels of rhodopsin activation. These results are consistent with recent reports for rhodopsin reconstituted in bilayers formed from phosphatidylcholine and varying levels of cholesterol (26Niu S.L. Mitchell D.C. Litman B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42807-42811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). In these reconstituted systems it is observed that the level (26Niu S.L. Mitchell D.C. Litman B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42807-42811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) and rate (40Mitchell D.C. Niu S.L. Litman B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42801-42806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) of coupling of MII to G protein was inversely correlated with the cholesterol concentration. In the current study a linear correlation was observed between Keq for the MI-MII equilibrium and fv from 4 to 38 mol % cholesterol at physiological temperature. Here again the results mimic those observed with single component phosphatidylcholine systems with and without cholesterol (8Litman B.J. Mitchell D.C. Lipids. 1996; 31 (suppl.): S193-S197Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Mitchell D.C. Straume M. Miller J.L. Litman B.J. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 9143-9149Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) in which no lipid rafts existed. If increasing cholesterol concentration is accompanied by lateral domain or raft formation in the disk membrane, then this should be manifested as a discontinuity in the cholesterol dependence of the activation of rhodopsin. However, we observed a tight linear correlation of rhodopsin activation with fv, which is a measure of the bulk or average phospholipid acyl chain packing in the membrane. Therefore, the results of the present study do not show the anticipated evidence for cholesterol-dependent formation of lipid rafts at cholesterol levels well below and above those of the native disk membrane. Disk phospholipid acyl chains are ∼50% DHA, and ∼25% of the disk phospholipids contain DHA in both the sn-1 and sn-2 positions (13Stinson A.M. Wiegand R.D. Anderson R.E. Exp. Eye Res. 1991; 52: 213-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). In model membranes formed from di22:6PC, di16:0PC, and cholesterol rhodopsin preferentially partitions into a di22:6PC-rich domain, whereas cholesterol partitions primarily into a domain rich in the saturated phospholipid (31Polozova A. Litman B.J. Biophys. J. 2000; 79: 2632-2643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). This observation demonstrates that rhodopsin prefers a liquid-disordered rather than a liquid-ordered phase. Therefore, if lipid rafts exist in disk membranes at physiological conditions and are in the liquid-ordered phase as was reported in other systems then rhodopsin will likely be excluded from these domains. In addition, the evidence from reconstituted systems (26Niu S.L. Mitchell D.C. Litman B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42807-42811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 40Mitchell D.C. Niu S.L. Litman B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42801-42806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) demonstrates that the presence of cholesterol-induced acyl chain ordering (such as that reported for lipid rafts) would reduce the rate and level of rhodopsin-transducin coupling, thereby diminishing the efficiency of signal transduction. Given the preference of cholesterol for saturated versus polyunsaturated acyl chains and the presence of dipolyunsaturated phospholipids in the disk membrane, there is the potential to form cholesterol-enriched and cholesterol-depleted lateral domains in the disk membrane (31Polozova A. Litman B.J. Biophys. J. 2000; 79: 2632-2643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). However, given the overall level of polyunsaturated acyl chains in the disk membrane, these domains will likely have very different properties from those found in high sphingomyelin-containing membranes, which might result in a more homogeneous distribution of rhodopsin. Cholesterol has been found to reduce membrane free volume by ordering phospholipid acyl chain packing. Integral membrane receptors and channels are imbedded in a lipid matrix and need to undergo conformational changes during activation. A simple two-state model described as an inactive state (I) and an activated state (A) illustrates the potential effect of cholesterol on membrane protein function. If the transition from I to A involves a net volume expansion such as the MI to MII transition of photoactivated rhodopsin, a more ordered phospholipid acyl chain packing imposed by cholesterol would inhibit such a transition. Inhibition of membrane protein function would be expected by cholesterol enrichment as is observed in this study. On the other hand, if the transition from I to A involves a net volume reduction, membrane ordering by cholesterol would facilitate such a transition and in turn enhance membrane protein function. The parallel behavior for the cholesterol dependence of rhodopsin activation in the native disk membranes and reconstituted bilayer systems suggests a mechanism of action of cholesterol that involves its effect on phospholipid acyl chain packing. If cholesterol-induced domain formation does occur in disks then their presence may be manifested in the coupling of the protein constituents in the signaling pathway rather than in a direct effect on the conformational changes associated with the activation of rhodopsin. The discussion of the effect of cholesterol on rhodopsin may extend to other membrane proteins as well, including receptors and channels, which undergo a functional conformational change in a region within the membrane lipid."
https://openalex.org/W2058230858,"Using sequence homology searches, yeast two-hybrid assays and glutathione S-transferase (GST)-pull-down approaches we have identified a series of glutamate receptor subunits that interact differentially with the PDZ proteins GRIP, PICK1, and syntenin. GST-pull-down experiments identified more interactions than detected by yeast two-hybrid assays. We report several receptor-protein interactions, strong ones include: (i) GRIP and syntenin with mGluR7a, mGluR4a, and mGluR6; (ii) PICK1 and GRIP with mGluR3; and (iii) syntenin with all forms of GluR1-4 and mGluR7b. We further characterized the novel mGluR7a-GRIP interaction found both in yeast two-hybrid and GST-pull-down assays and observed that mGluR7a localization overlapped with GRIP with in hippocampal neurons. The wide range of targets for PICK1, GRIP, and syntenin suggests they may represent a molecular mechanism that can concentrate and/or regulate a number of different receptors at a common site on a synapse. These data also suggest that the structural determinants involved in PDZ interactions are more complex than originally envisaged."

Provision of increasing levels of exogenously supplied Phe to saturating levels (40 mm) to the induction medium resulted in further up-regulation of their transcript levels in the <i>P. taeda</i> cell cultures; this in turn was accompanied by considerable increases in both <i>p</i>-coumaryl and coniferyl alcohol formation and excretion. By contrast, transcript levels for both cinnamate 4-hydroxylase and <i>p</i>-coumarate 3-hydroxylase were only slightly up-regulated. These data, when considered together with metabolic profiling results and genetic manipulation of various plant species, reveal that carbon allocation to the pathway and its differential distribution into the two monolignols is controlled by Phe supply and differential modulation of cinnamate 4-hydroxylase and <i>p</i>-coumarate 3-hydroxylase activities, respectively. The coordinated up-regulation of phenylalanine ammonia lyase, 4-coumarate:CoA ligase, caffeoyl-CoA <i>O</i>-methyltransferase, cinnamoyl-CoA reductase and cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase in the presence of increasing concentrations of Phe also indicates that these steps are not truly rate-limiting, because they are modulated according to metabolic demand. Finally, the transcript profile of a putative acid/ester <i>O</i>-methyltransferase, proposed as an alternative catalyst for <i>O</i>-methylation leading to coniferyl alcohol, was not up-regulated under any of the conditions employed, suggesting that it is not, in fact, involved in monolignol biosynthesis."

It is becoming increasingly apparent that agonists or antagonists of A3adenosine receptors have potential as therapeutic agents for the treatment of ischemic and inflammatory diseases (5Linden J. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2001; 41: 775-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar, 8Kaiser S.M. Quinn R.J. Drug Disc. Today. 1999; 4: 542-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar).The development of agonists and antagonists for the A3receptors has so far been directed by traditional medicinal chemistry. The availability of genetic information promises to facilitate understanding of the drug-receptor interaction leading to the rational design of a potentially therapeutically important class of drugs. Molecular modeling may further rationalize observed interactions between the receptor and a ligand. Previously, models derived for GPCRs based on structural homology with bacteriorhodopsin (12Pardo L. Ballesteros J.A. Osman R. Weinstein H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Nature. 1997; 389: 203-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar) had been helpful in understanding and predicting drug-receptor interactions for a variety of receptors. The high resolution crystal structure of bovine rhodopsin has been determined recently (15Palczewski K. Kumasaka T. Hori T. Behnke C.A. Motoshima H. Fox B.A., Le Trong I. Teller D.C. Okada T. Stenkamp T.E. Yamamoto M. Miyano M. Science. 2000; 289: 739-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (4992) Google Scholar), providing a detailed atomic description of a GPCR in an inactive conformation and a solid basis for modeling the structure of other rhodopsin-like GPCRs. Such models can be used to help rationalize many observations made on the relationships between the conserved residues and the functional coupling properties. Conservation of functionally important sequences or residues within a certain receptor family is generally considered as a basis for the molecular mechanism leading to the receptor activation in the various subtypes of this receptor family. However, considering the diversity of ligands for different receptors or for different subtypes of a certain receptor family, it has also been accepted that different receptor subtypes may have quite specific structural and functional characteristics.The ligand-binding sites on the A1, A2A, and A2B receptors have been characterized previously (16Barbhaiya H.

Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 1349-1356Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) using site-directed mutagenesis. However, the molecular basis for ligand recognition in the A3 adenosine receptor remains largely unknown. Only very recently, we created a “neoceptor” and several constitutively active mutant human A3 adenosine receptors by site-directed mutagenesis (21Jacobson K.A. Gao Z.G. Chen A. Barak D. Kim S.A.

Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 284: 596-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), which provided new insight into the molecular recognition in the A3 receptor. In order to provide additional insights into ligand-A3adenosine receptor interactions, site-directed mutagenesis was used to study the role of a number of residues in the transmembrane (TM) domains and the second extracellular loop (EL2, Fig. 1). The present study identified a number of residues essential for high affinity binding of agonist and/or antagonist, as well as the receptor activation process. The results were interpreted with the aid of a model of ligand-A3receptor interactions based on the high resolution crystal structure of bovine rhodopsin.RESULTSThe A3 receptor cDNAs were initially isolated from rat testis and rat brain cDNA libraries and later from other species (31Olah M.E. Stiles G.L. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1995; 35: 581-606Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Salvatore C.A. Jacobson M.A. Taylor H.E. Linden J. Johnson R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Sequence alignments for selected transmembrane domains of four human adenosine receptor subtypes, sheep and rat A3 receptors, and other GPCRs are shown in Fig. 2. The A3 receptor exhibits the lowest degree of identity between species compared with other adenosine receptor subtypes (31Olah M.E. Stiles G.L. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1995; 35: 581-606Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Salvatore C.A. Jacobson M.A. Taylor H.E. Linden J. Johnson R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

His95 (3.37) is conserved in A3 receptors from various species including human, sheep and rat, and the corresponding residue in A1 and A2A adenosine receptor (Gln) has been studied (33Jiang Q. van Rhee A.M. Kim J. Yehle S. Wess J. Jacobson K.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 512-521PubMed Google Scholar, 34Rivkees S.A. Barbhaiya H. IJzerman A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3617-3621Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Lys152 occurs in the second extracellular loop (EL2). Three residues in TM6 were mutated as follows: Trp243 (6.48), Ser247 (6.52; corresponding to His in human A1and A2A receptors), and Asn250 (6.55). All of these residues were predicted in molecular modeling (21Jacobson K.A. Gao Z.G. Chen A. Barak D. Kim S.A. Lee K. Link A. van Rompaey P. van Calenbergh S. Liang B.T. J. Med. Chem. 2001; 44: 4125-4136Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) to be involved in the ligand recognition in the A3 adenosine receptor. By comparison, we also tested the role of Leu244 (6.49), which was not predicted to be involved in ligand recognition but was located one helical turn below Ser247. Each of these residues was individually replaced with Ala or both Ala and Phe.Figure 2Sequence alignments of selected regions of A3 adenosine receptors and other G protein-coupled receptors. Residues mutated in this study are shown in boldface type. The standardized numbering system of van Rhee and Jacobson (25Van Rhee A.M. Jacobson K.A. Drug Dev. Res. 1996; 37: 1-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) was used to identify residues in the transmembrane domains (TMs) of various receptors. Each residue is identified by two numbers; the first corresponds to the TM in which it is located; the second indicates its position relative to the most conserved residue in that helix, arbitrarily assigned to 50. For example, H3.37 is the histidine in TM3, located 13 residues before the most conserved arginine R3.50; W6.48 corresponds to Trp243.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Ligand Binding Properties of the WT and Mutant ReceptorsThe affinity of a number of agonists and antagonists belonging to different chemical classes (Fig. 3) were tested in both WT and mutant receptors. As shown in Fig. 4, following the mutation of His95 to Ala, the affinity of the high affinity selective A3 agonist, Cl-IB-MECA, decreased 26-fold. Similar to Cl-IB-MECA, the affinity of other agonists and antagonists with different structures was decreased by the H95A mutation (Table I). The affinity of most test ligands for the H95A mutant receptor was ∼10–100-fold lower than that for the WT receptor, suggesting that this residue is important for ligand recognition in the A3 adenosine receptor.Figure 3Chemical structures of ligands tested in this study.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 4Effects of mutations in TM3, TM6, and EL2 on the binding of A3 agonist Cl-IB-MECA.

Open table in a new tab The Trp residue (6.48) is conserved among all four subtypes of adenosine receptors and a variety of other GPCRs (Fig. 3) and was proposed to be involved in ligand recognition in human A3adenosine receptors as predicted by molecular modeling. However, the replacement of this Trp by Ala or Phe did not influence the agonist binding affinity, as determined by saturation experiment using [125I]I-AB-MECA. The displacement of [125I]I-AB-MECA binding by five agonists, adenosine derivatives CADO, Cl-IB-MECA, and NECA; the rigid methanocarba derivative MRS1898 (24Lee K. Ravi R.G., Ji, X.-D. Marquez V.E.

The Kd value for [125I]I-AB-MECA and Ki values for other agonists were summarized in Table I.In contrast to the agonist binding, the binding affinity of the A3 antagonist MRS1220 was diminished ∼30-fold for the W243A mutant receptor (Fig. 5). Similar to MRS1220, other test antagonists also showed a marked decrease of binding affinity following the mutation of the Trp residue (Table I), suggesting the involvement, either directly or indirectly, of this residue in antagonist recognition.Figure 5Effects of the Trp mutation on the binding of A3 antagonist MRS1220.

The data shown are from a representative example of at least three independent experiments performed in duplicate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Following the substitution of Leu244 or Ser247with Ala, saturation experiments were carried out using [125I]I-AB-MECA as a radioligand. Competitive binding of various ligands to human WT and mutant A3 adenosine receptors demonstrated that the binding parameters for all the agonists and antagonists were only slightly affected (Table I). In contrast to L244A and S247A mutant receptors, the specific binding of [125I]I-AB-MECA (1.0 nm) to the N250A mutant receptor was not detectable. In order to examine the effects of this mutation on antagonist binding, a radiolabeled A3antagonist [3H]PSB-11 (8 nm, final concentration) was used in the experiment. Similar to the [125I]I-AB-MECA binding, the mutation also resulted in a complete loss of high affinity [3H]PSB-11 binding, suggesting that Asn250 is essential, either directly or indirectly, for ligand recognition in the human A3adenosine receptor. The proximity of this residue to the putative ligand binding site was predicted using the molecular modeling.The Lys residue of EL2 was predicted to be involved in ligand recognition using a molecular model of the A3 adenosine receptor (see below). Following the K152A mutation, the affinity of all the agonists tested was essentially unchanged; however, the antagonist affinity decreased 3–9-fold, suggestive of the possible involvement of this residue in antagonist recognition. The Kd and Ki values were summarized in Table I.Agonist-induced Phosphoinositide Turnover in COS-7 Cells Expressing WT and Mutant ReceptorsThe A3 adenosine receptor is coupled to Gi protein, whereas coupling to Gqprotein is controversial, because some studies have shown that PLC activation by the A3 adenosine receptor is prevented by pertussis toxin (3Olah M.E. Stiles G.L. Pharmacol Ther. 2000; 85: 55-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 35Abbracchio M.P. Brambilla R. Ceruti S. Kim H.O. von Lubitz D.K. Jacobson K.A. Cattabeni F. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 48: 1038-1045PubMed Google Scholar). To test the activation of the WT and mutant receptors, we initially attempted to perform a cyclic AMP production assay in transfected COS-7 cells. However, we observed that both NECA and Cl-IB-MECA, at certain concentrations, induced an increase of cyclic AMP production in non-transfected COS-7 cells, suggesting the presence of an endogenous Gs-coupled adenosine receptor, possibly the A2B adenosine receptor. In the same cell line, Cl-IB-MECA had no effect on basal phosphoinositide turnover. Hence, to avoid interference by endogenous receptors, together with the fact that forskolin-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity was only partly inhibited by A3 receptor agonists as demonstrated elsewhere (36Jacobson K.A. Park K.S. Jiang J.L. Kim Y.C. Olah M.E. Stiles G.L. Ji X.D. Neuropharmacology. 1997; 36: 1157-1165Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), the PLC assay was used in the determination of functional coupling of the WT and mutant receptors.Fig. 6 demonstrated that Cl-IB-MECA induced accumulation of inositol phosphates in COS-7 cells expressing WT receptors in a concentration-dependent manner, with an EC50 of 260 ± 49 nm(n = 3). The H95A mutation did not influence the production of inositol phosphates significantly (EC50 = 224 ± 57 nm; n = 3) (p > 0.05 compared with WT). In contrast, no substantial stimulation of phosphoinositide turnover by Cl-IB-MECA was observed in COS-7 cells expressing W243A, W243F, and N250A mutant receptors. In the case of the L244A mutant receptor, Cl-IB-MECA could still stimulate PLC activity but with 36-fold decreased potency (EC50 = 9430 ± 2470 nm; n= 3). No enhancement in basal PLC activity was observed for these mutant receptors.Figure 6Cl-IB-MECA induced phosphoinositide turnover in COS-7 cells expressing WT and mutant human A3 adenosine receptors. Receptors were transiently expressed in COS-7 cells and used 48 h after transfection. The data shown are from a representative example of three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Effects of a Guanine Nucleotide, GTPγS, on Agonist BindingTo characterize further the interactions between WT and mutant receptors and G proteins, we initially tried to do a membrane binding assay using [35S]GTPγS; however, the signal-to-noise ratio was quite low. Hence, the ability of WT and W243A and W243F mutant receptors to interact with G proteins was further evaluated by measuring the effects of GTPγS on binding of the agonist [125I]I-AB-MECA and on agonist Cl-IB-MECA competition for [3H]PSB-11 binding in membranes of COS-7 cells expressing WT and mutant receptors. As shown in Fig. 7, treatment with GTPγS reduced agonist binding. The inhibitory effect of this GTP analogue on agonist binding to W243A and W243F mutant receptors was less pronounced compared with that of WT receptors, consistent with the impaired ability of these mutant receptors to mediate inositol phosphate production in response to an A3 agonist.Figure 7Effects of GTP analogue on A3receptor binding. Shown are the effects of increasing concentrations of GTPγS on binding of the agonist radioligand [125I]I-AB-MECA (1.0 nm) to membranes from COS-7 cells expressing WT and mutant receptors.

In this study, we further observed the effect of GTPγS on the competition by agonist Cl-IB-MECA for binding of the antagonist [3H]PSB-11 to WT and mutant receptors. The Ki values for Cl-IB-MECA in the absence and presence 100 μm GTPγS were 2.5 ± 0.4 and 7.4 ± 1.1 nm, respectively, in WT receptors. In W243F mutant receptors, the respective Ki values were 2.3 ± 0.2 and 3.2 ± 0.4 nm. Hence, the GTP analogue induced a 3-fold affinity decrease of Cl-IB-MECA in WT receptors, whereas in the W243F mutant receptor only a 1.4-fold decrease of affinity was observed, consistent with the impaired ability of agonist to activate PLC through this mutant receptor. In the case of the W243A mutant receptor, the agonist affinity shift could not be observed due to the extremely low affinity of this mutant receptor for the antagonist radioligand [3H]PSB-11.Molecular ModelingRecently a human A3 receptor model, including the seven transmembrane helical domains (TMs) and EL2, has been constructed (21Jacobson K.A. Gao Z.G. Chen A. Barak D. Kim S.A. Lee K. Link A. van Rompaey P. van Calenbergh S. Liang B.T. J. Med.

The model was used primarily to rationalize the observed effects of the replacement of residue His272(7.43) by glutamate on the receptor affinity toward A3agonists and antagonists. Through docking of the A3agonists and antagonists, we have initially defined the ligand binding environment to include side chains of residues Thr94(3.36), His95 (3.37), Ser247 (6.52), Gln167 and Lys152 (EL2), and Ser271(7.42) and Asn274 (7.45), and we suggested differences in the accommodation of agonists bearing different N 6 substituents. Thus, although the N 6 moiety of CADO was located within H-bonding distance from the amide oxygen of Trp243 and Oγ of Ser247 (2.76 Å and 2.51 Å, respectively), the N 6-benzyl substituent of IB-MECA appeared to interact with residues Phe182, Ile186, and Phe187 in TM5. The effect of this bulky N 6 substitution on the orientation of the bound agonist was to displace the respective N 6substituent away from the amide oxygen of Trp243. Consequently the 3′-hydroxy substituent of IB-MECA did not seem to interact with His272, whereas such interactions could be observed with the corresponding substituents of CADO or NECA. In addition, the modeled interaction of the agonist N6 moiety with Oγ−Ser247 seemed to orient the adenine ring for aromatic– aromatic interaction with the indole moiety of Trp243. Although this model could be used successfully to formalize the concept of neoceptor with respect to the A3 receptor– agonist interaction (21Jacobson K.A. Gao Z.G. Chen A. Barak D. Kim S.A. Lee K.

Chem. 2001; 44: 4125-4136Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), further experimental evidence was needed especially for corroborating the putative interactions of the adenine moiety of the agonists.In the present study ligand accommodation in the A3-binding site was further examined by modeling adducts of the various agonists and antagonists (Table I) with mutant receptors carrying residue replacements at the putative binding site. The results indicated that although the overall positioning of the ligands within the A3 helical bundle was consistent with pharmacological findings, the orientation of the adenine moiety with respect to TM3 and TM6 had to be adjus"

The enzyme is specific for 3′ U-addition in the presence of Mg2+. TUTase is present in vivo in at least two stable configurations: one contains a ∼500 kDa TUTase oligomer and the other a ∼700 kDa TUTase complex. Anti-TUTase antiserum specifically coprecipitates a small portion of the p45 and p50 RNA ligases and approximately 40% of the guide RNAs. Inhibition of TUTase expression in procyclic T. brucei by RNAi downregulates RNA editing and appears to affect parasite viability.
https://openalex.org/W2075279965,"Two aquaporin (AQP)-type water channels are expressed in mammalian cornea, AQP1 in endothelial cells and AQP5 in epithelial cells. To test whether these aquaporins are involved in corneal fluid transport and transparency, we compared corneal thickness, water permeability, and response to experimental swelling in wild type mice and transgenic null mice lacking AQP1 and AQP5. Corneal thickness in fixed sections was remarkably reduced in AQP1 null mice and increased in AQP5 null mice. By z-scanning confocal microscopy, corneal thickness in vivo was (in μm, mean ± S.E.,n = 5 mice) 123 ± 1 (wild type), 101 ± 2 (AQP1 null), and 144 ± 2 (AQP5 null). After exposure of the external corneal surface to hypotonic saline (100 mosm), the rate of corneal swelling (5.0 ± 0.3 μm/min, wild type) was reduced by AQP5 deletion (2.7 ± 0.1 μm/min). After exposure of the endothelial surface to hypotonic saline by anterior chamber perfusion, the rate of corneal swelling (7.1 ± 1.0 μm/min, wild type) was reduced by AQP1 deletion (1.6 ± 0.4 μm/min). Base-line corneal transparency was not impaired by AQP1 or AQP5 deletion. However, the recovery of corneal transparency and thickness after hypotonic swelling (10-min exposure of corneal surface to hypotonic saline) was remarkably delayed in AQP1 null mice with ∼75% recovery at 7 min in wild type mice compared with 5% recovery in AQP1 null mice. Our data indicate that AQP1 and AQP5 provide the principal routes for corneal water transport across the endothelial and epithelial barriers, respectively. The impaired recovery of corneal transparency in AQP1 null mice provides evidence for the involvement of AQP1 in active extrusion of fluid from the corneal stroma across the corneal endothelium. The up-regulation of AQP1 expression and/or function in corneal endothelium may reduce corneal swelling and opacification following injury. Two aquaporin (AQP)-type water channels are expressed in mammalian cornea, AQP1 in endothelial cells and AQP5 in epithelial cells.

Our data indicate that AQP1 and AQP5 provide the principal routes for corneal water transport across the endothelial and epithelial barriers, respectively. The impaired recovery of corneal transparency in AQP1 null mice provides evidence for the involvement of AQP1 in active extrusion of fluid from the corneal stroma across the corneal endothelium. The up-regulation of AQP1 expression and/or function in corneal endothelium may reduce corneal swelling and opacification following injury. The cornea consists of a stromal layer that is covered at its external surface by an epithelium in contact with tear fluid and at its inner surface by an endothelium in contact with aqueous fluid in the anterior chamber. Corneal transparency requires precise regulation of water content at ∼78 weight %. Changes in corneal water content alter the regular diameter and spacing of collagen fibrils that is believed to be critical for transparency (1Maurice D.M. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1972; 221: 43-54Crossref Scopus (322) Google Scholar). The corneal epithelium carries out active transport of chloride from stroma to tears. Although the transport of sodium from tears to stroma has been demonstrated in experimental models, the electrochemical driving forces in vivo probably favor net NaCl and fluid movement from stroma to tears (2Klyce S.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1975; 228: 1446-1452Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The corneal endothelium contains transporters (Na+K+ ATPase, Na+K+/2Cl−, HCO3−/Cl−) that pump solutes, primarily sodium and bicarbonate, from the stroma into the aqueous fluid (1Maurice D.M. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1972; 221: 43-54Crossref Scopus (322) Google Scholar,3Fischbarg J. Lim J.J. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1974; 241: 647-675Crossref Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 4Hodson S. Miller F. J.

Water then moves passively across the endothelium in response to the small osmotic gradients created by salt pumping. Active solute transport across the corneal endothelium is probably critical for the maintenance of corneal transparency to offset the tendency of the stroma to absorb water. The stroma is mildly hyperosmolar relative to aqueous fluid because of the high concentration of negatively charged glycosaminoglycans and the consequent accumulation of monovalent cations, which produces an effective stromal swelling pressure or “imbibition pressure” of ∼50 mm Hg (7Ytteborg J.

It has been postulated without direct evidence that AQP1 and AQP5 are involved in water transport between the corneal stroma and between the tear and aqueous fluids and thus in the maintenance of corneal transparency (13Hamann S.

Comparative morphological and in vivo confocal microscopy measurements were made on wild type mice and mice lacking AQP1 or AQP5. Methodology was developed to measure water permeability across the corneal epithelium and endothelium in vivo, and a non-injury experimental model of corneal swelling was used to study the role of aquaporins in the regulation of corneal water content. Our measurements provide the first functional evidence implicating a role of AQP1 and AQP5 in osmotically driven fluid movement in cornea as well as the involvement of AQP1 in the maintenance of corneal water content. The marked impairment of corneal recovery in AQP1 null mice has potentially important implications regarding the mechanisms and treatment of corneal edema. Transgenic knock-out mice deficient in AQP1 and AQP5 in a CD1 genetic background were generated by targeted gene disruption as described originally (19Ma T. Song Y. Gillespie A. Carlson E.J. Epstein C.J. Verkman A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20071-20074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar, 24Ma T. Yang B. Gillespie A. Carlson E.J. Epstein C.J. Verkman A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4296-4299Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). Measurements were done in age-matched wild type and knock-out mice (age 8–10 weeks, weight 25–35 grams). Investigators were blinded to genotype information until the completion of the analysis. Protocols were approved by the University of California San Francisco Committee on Animal Research and are in compliance with the ARVO statement for the use of animals in ophthalmic and vision research. Mice were anesthetized using ketamine (40 mg/kg intraperitoneal) and xylazine (8 mg/kg). Body temperature was maintained at 37 °C with a heating pad. For microscopy, the head was immobilized using a stereotaxic apparatus (Kopf) with the eye under study facing upward. The center of the cornea was carefully positioned perpendicular to the optical axis of an upright fluorescence microscope (Leitz) equipped with a Nipkow wheel-type co-axial confocal module (Technical Instruments). Reflected white light was collected using a ×20 air objective (Nikon, working distance 20.5 mm, numerical aperture 0.35) and detected by a photomultiplier or cooled CCD camera. The axial resolution of the confocal optics as used for z-scanning measurements was ∼3 μm. Axial scanning was carried out at a rate of 100 μm/s by driving the fine focus with a microstepper motor (Compumotor). Corneal thickness was determined from z-scans of scattered light intensity by image detection (as in Fig. 2B), and for rapid assessment by integrated signal detection using a photomultiplier (as in Fig. 3A). For image detection, brightfield confocal images were viewed every 5 μm in the z-direction. The external and inner corneal surfaces were identified by characteristic morphometric features (see “Results”). For photomultiplier detection, a 100-μm-diameter circular region of the cornea was illuminated, and total reflected light in the Brightfield confocal mode was recorded during rapid scanning through the corneal tissue. Intensity scans, I(x), were fitted by non-linear least squares fitting to a Lorentzian curve, I(x) = aΓ/[(x −x0)2 + (0.5Γ)2] +b, where Γ is the width at half-maximum height (related to corneal thickness (tc) by tc = 0.9Γ),x0 is the position of the intensity maximum,a is related to intensity, and b is related to offset.Figure 3Osmotic water transport across the corneal epithelium in AQP5 null mice.A, in vivo z-scans of scattered light intensity for corneas from mice of indicated genotype at 0 and 10 min after exposure of the corneal surface to hypotonic saline.

The corneal surface was rinsed in phosphate-buffered saline (300 mosm) and bathed by drip perfusion in hypotonic saline (100 mosm). In some experiments, corneas were fixed and harvested for morphology. Corneal swelling rate was determined from the time course of corneal thickness in serial z-scans. To establish an osmotic gradient across the corneal endothelial surface, glass micropipettes were inserted into the anterior chamber on opposite sides of the eye for fluid inflow and outflow (Fig. 4A, inset). Micropipettes (tip diameter = 40–50 μm) were pulled from borosilicate glass using a vertical pipette puller followed by breaking to produce a very sharp tip. Micropipettes were introduced into the mouse cornea using 4-axis micromanipulators at an angle of ∼20° from the corneal surface at locations of ∼0.1 mm from opposite edges of the cornea. The anterior chamber was perfused initially with saline and then with hypotonic saline (100 mosm) at a rate of 30 μl/min using a syringe pump. The external corneal surface was covered with mineral oil to prevent fluid transport across the epithelial surface. Corneal swelling rate was determined from the time course of corneal thickness in serial z-scans. Hypotonic solution challenge was used as a non-injury model of corneal swelling. Corneas were hypotonically swollen by exposure of the external corneal surface to hypotonic saline (100 mosm) for 10 min. The hypotonic solution was then removed and replaced with mineral oil. Scanning confocal microscopy was done at different times to assess the recovery of corneal thickness. In some experiments, the external corneal surface was bathed in saline containing ouabain (100 μm) for 15 min before hypotonic swelling. Mice were perfused through the aorta with 4% heparin in phosphate-buffered saline and then perfused with freshly prepared 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for immunocytochemistry and 4% paraformaldehyde and Bouin's buffer for light microscopy. After fixation, eyes were dehydrated and embedded in Tissue-Tek OCT compound for 3–4-μm cryostat sections and in glycol methacrylate for plastic sections. Immunocytochemistry was done using affinity-purified polyclonal anti-AQP1 and AQP5 antibodies. For light microscopy, eyes were infiltrated with JB-4 monomer (Polyscience) and sectioned on a microtome (Sorvall) and stained with toluidine blue. Fig. 1A shows immunofluorescence localization of AQP1 protein in plasma membranes of mouse corneal endothelial cells (left upper panel) and AQP5 protein in the plasma membrane of corneal epithelial cells (left lower panel). Immunostaining of corneas from AQP1 and AQP5 null mice was negative using their respective antibodies (right panels). These results are in agreement with the expression patterns of AQP1 and AQP5 in human (13Hamann S. Zeuthen T., La Cour M. Nagelhus E.A. Ottersen O.P. Agre P. Nielsen S. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: C1332-C1345Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and rat (11Patil R.V. Saito I. Yang X. Wax M.B. Exp. Eye Res. 1997; 64: 203-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) cornea. Reverse transcriptase-PCR analysis using primers specific for aquaporins 1–9 revealed AQP1 and AQP5 transcript in the corneas of wild type mice, AQP5 transcript in AQP1 null mice, and AQP1 transcript in AQP5 null mice as expected (data not shown). Corneal morphology was evaluated in tissue sections. Fig. 1B shows micrographs of corneal sections taken from wild type, AQP1 null and AQP5 null mice. Compared with wild type mice, corneal thickness was consistently lower in AQP1 null mice and greater in AQP5 null mice. The increased corneal thickness in AQP5 null mice appeared to involve both the epithelial and stromal layers. The decreased corneal thickness in AQP1 null mice was predominantly stromal. Fig. 2A summarizes corneal thickness measured on micrographs of stained plastic sections as in Fig. 1B. Corneal thickness was significantly lower in AQP1 null mice and greater in AQP5 null mice than in wild type mice. Corneal thickness was also measured in vivo to avoid potential fixation artifacts. A scanning confocal microscopy approach was used based on the work of Jester and colleagues (25Jester J.V. Ghee Lee Y., Li, J. Chakravarti S. Paul J. Petroll W.M. Cavanagh H.D. Vision Res. 2001; 41: 1283-1290Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 26Jester J.V. Petroll W.M. Cavanagh H.D.

Suppl. 1992; 6: 71-79PubMed Google Scholar) and humans (29Chew S.J. Beuerman R.W. Kaufman H.E. Lens. Eye Toxic. Res. 1992; 9: 275-292PubMed Google Scholar). After anesthesia and immobilization of the mouse head to position the center of the cornea perpendicular to the optical axis, brightfield (reflective) confocal images were viewed every 5 μm through the cornea using a computer-controlled z axis microstepper motor. Fig. 2B shows representative images at four z-positions showing the locations of the external (left) and inner (right) corneal surfaces. The distinctive ring patterns are produced by the curved cornea and permit the determination of corneal thickness in living mice to better than 5-μm accuracy. Fig. 2C summarizes corneal thickness measured on the left and right eyes from a series of mice. The averaged corneal thickness was 123 ± 1 μm (mean ± S.E.) in wild type mice, significantly thinner in AQP1 null mice (101 ± 2 μm,p < 0.01), and thicker in AQP5 null mice (144 ± 2 μm, p < 0.01). The roles of AQP5 and AQP1 in corneal epithelial and endothelial water permeability, respectively, were determined from the kinetics of corneal swelling in response to exposure of the corneal surfaces to hypotonic saline (100 mosm). To study AQP5 water permeability in corneal epithelia, corneal thickness was measured by z-scanning confocal microscopy at different times during continuous topical application of hypotonic saline. The corneal sections in Fig. 3A, left, show significant corneal swelling at 10 min after hypotonic challenge. Fig. 3A also shows representative z-scans (dotted lines) and fitted curves (solid lines) in which the curve width is related to corneal thickness (see “Materials and Methods”). As expected from the results in Fig. 2, the curve width was greater in AQP5 null mice than in wild type mice and lower in AQP1 null mice (Fig. 3A, right). The curve width increased with time after hypotonic challenge to a greater extent in wild type than in AQP5 null mice. Fig. 3B, left, summarizes the kinetics of swelling for a series of corneas. Initial swelling rates (in μm/min) were reduced ∼2-fold in corneas of AQP5 null mice compared with wild type mice (p < 0.01) (Fig. 3B, right). Osmotic water permeability coefficients (Pf) computed for a smooth corneal surface were (2.3 ± 0.1) × 10−3 cm/s in wild type mice and (1.2 ± 0.03) × 10−3 cm/s in AQP5 null mice. Therefore, AQP5 provides an important route for water movement across the corneal epithelial surface. Similar experiments were done to measure the role of AQP1 in osmotically induced water permeability in corneal endothelium, with the exception that the inward-facing surface of the cornea was exposed to hypotonic saline. These studies required perfusion of fluid into the anterior chamber using glass micropipettes (Fig. 4A, inset). To ensure that the measurements of corneal endothelial water permeability were not affected by water movement across the corneal epithelium, the external corneal surface was covered with mineral oil throughout the measurements. Control studies showed that the mineral oil did not interfere with the confocal microscopy measurements. Exposure of the corneal endothelium to hypotonic saline in wild type mice caused rapid corneal swelling followed by spontaneous recovery (Fig. 4A). AQP1 deletion produced significant slowing of the initial swelling rate as well as the recovery rate. Fig. 4B summarizes initial swelling rates for a series of mice. Pf computed for a smooth corneal endothelial surface were (3.3 ± 0.4) × 10−3 cm/s in wild type mice and (0.7 ± 0.2) × 10−3 cm/s in AQP1 null mice (p < 0.01). Thus, AQP1 provides the major route for osmotic water movement across the corneal endothelial surface. To investigate the role of AQP1 in the maintenance of corneal water content, corneal swelling and recovery were measured in a non-injury model of corneal edema. The corneal epithelium was exposed to hypotonic saline for 10 min to produce corneal swelling (Fig. 5A, left). At 10 min, the corneal surface was covered with mineral oil to prevent trans-epithelial fluid movement, and the time course of corneal thickness was measured by z-scanning confocal microscopy. Gross corneal opacification was observed for >30 min in AQP1 null mice (Fig. 5A, right), whereas corneas remained grossly transparent in wild type mice after hypotonically induced swelling. Fig. 5B shows the kinetics of corneal swelling and recovery for wild type and AQP1 null mice as well as wild type mice in which the cornea was exposed to the Na+/K+ pump inhibitor ouabain. Ouabain exposure or AQP1 deletion produced a remarkable slowing of recovery (fluid extrusion) after swelling as well as greater maximal swelling. Fig. 5C shows that AQP1 deletion did not affect the initial rate of corneal swelling (top), which results from osmotic water transport across the AQP5-containing epithelial surface. However, AQP1 deletion caused significant slowing of recovery after swelling resulting from water movement from the stroma through the corneal endothelium (bottom, p < 0.01). The purpose of this study was to investigate the role of aquaporin water channels in important aspects of corneal physiology that depend on water/fluid transport. Water channels AQP1 and AQP5 are expressed in corneal endothelial and epithelial cells, respectively. Because these proteins function as water pores that facilitate osmotically driven water transport, it has been postulated that these proteins play a role in fluid movement across corneal epithelial and endothelial cell barriers. In addition, aquaporins may have other non-water-transporting roles. AQP1 is an early response gene that may play a role in wound healing (30Lanahan A. Williams J.B. Sanders L.K. Nathans D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3919-3929Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). AQP1 has been proposed to transport CO2 and possibly other gases (31Cooper G.J Boron W.F. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: C1481-C1486Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), although subsequent reports have refuted this idea (32Yang B. Fukuda N. van Hoek A. Matthay M.A., Ma, T. Verkman A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2686-2692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 33Fang, X., Yang, B., Matthay, M. A., and Verkman, A. S. (2002)J. Physiol.

Visual Sci. 2001; 42: 417-423PubMed Google Scholar). We used transgenic knock-out mice deficient in AQP1 and AQP5 to investigate the role of these proteins in corneal functions that can be reasonably postulated to involve aquaporins including corneal thickness, epithelial and endothelial barrier water permeabilities, and corneal recovery after hypotonic swelling. The involvement of aquaporins in water permeability across epithelial and endothelial barriers in cornea is probably a prerequisite for their involvement in corneal physiology. The measurement of apparent osmotic water permeability from the kinetics of corneal swelling in response to osmotic gradients indicated that AQP5 and AQP1 provide the principle routes for osmotically driven water transport across corneal epithelial and endothelial barriers, respectively. Epithelial water transport was reduced ∼2-fold in AQP5 null mice, and endothelial water transport was reduced ∼5-fold in AQP1 null mice. These results provide evidence against the functional expression of a different aquaporin in the null mice that compensates for the reduced water permeability. However, as concluded in several studies in aquaporin null mice (35Verkman A.S. Curr. Opin. Nephrol. Hypertens. 2000; 9: 517-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), the cell-specific expression of a functional aquaporin does not ensure its physiological significance. For example, a 30-fold reduction in osmotic water permeability across the airspace-blood barrier in lung had no physiological consequences in active alveolar fluid absorption (21Ma T. Fukuda N. Song Y. Matthay M.A. Verkman A.S. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 93-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar) or response to experimental injury (36Song Y. Fukuda N. Bai C., Ma, T. Matthay M.A. Verkman A.S. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2000; 525: 771-779Crossref Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The relatively modest reduction in apparent water permeability of the corneal epithelium in AQP5 null mice might be because of its relatively low abundance compared with AQP1 in corneal endothelium. Additionally, unstirred layer effects in the multi-layered epithelium might limit maximum water flow and hence blunt the reduction in apparent Pf in AQP5 null mice. Morphological analysis and in vivo confocal microscopy showed remarkably increased corneal thickness in AQP5 null mice and reduced thickness in AQP1 null mice. Our results do not establish the mechanistic basis for the differences in corneal thickness, but we speculate that reduced water permeabilities of the corneal epithelium and endothelium produce adaptive changes in stromal properties. The corneal epithelium is chronically exposed to a mildly hyperosmolar layer of tear fluid that is produced by balanced lacrimal gland secretion and evaporative water loss. We showed previously that AQP1 or AQP5 deletion in mice does not impair tear secretion (37Moore M., Ma, T. Yang B. Verkman A.S. Exp. Eye Res. 2000; 70: 557-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The corneal endothelium is exposed to aqueous fluid in the anterior chamber at a greater pressure (intraocular pressure) than that of the surface tear layer (atmospheric pressure). Aqueous fluid production involves near-isosmolar fluid secretion by the ciliary epithelium in which AQP1 and AQP4 are expressed. We showed previously that AQP1 deletion in mice produced a mild reduction in intraocular pressure (from 16.0 to 14.2 mm Hg) as a result of decreased aqueous fluid secretion (38Zhang, D., Vetrivel, L., and Verkman, A. S. (2002) FASEB J., in pressGoogle Scholar). The forces acting on the cornea are established by the solute activities and osmolalities of the tear and aqueous fluids and the hydrostatic forces imposed by intraocular pressure. The responses of the cornea to these forces depend on active and passive solute-transporting properties of the epithelial and endothelial barriers as well as their osmotic water permeabilities. If driving forces and permeability properties do not change in AQP5 null mice with the exception of reduced osmotic water permeability of the corneal epithelium, there would be a reduced rate of osmotically driven water efflux from the stroma to the tear layer. Chronically, the impaired exit of corneal water may produce an increase in corneal thickness. The reduction of water permeability of the corneal endothelium by AQP1 deletion would similarly reduce osmotic water transport from the aqueous fluid to the corneal stroma. The continued osmotic water transport from the stroma to the tear layer might produce a chronically dehydrated and thinned cornea in AQP1 null mice. Although there may be complex solute movements among the tear, stromal, and aqueous fluid compartments, the reasoning above applies specifically to osmotically driven transport of solute-free water driven by the higher osmolality of the tear fluid than the aqueous fluid. However, we cannot rule out alternative explanations for altered corneal thickness in aquaporin null mice, such as developmental changes or altered expression of solute transporters in epithelial or endothelial cells. Studies using specific non-toxic aquaporin inhibitors, when available, are needed. Perhaps the most interesting observation in these experiments was the significant impairment in corneal recovery in AQP1 null mice following swelling produced by exposure of the corneal surface to hypotonic saline. The prompt recovery of corneal transparency and thickness after swelling in wild type mice supports previous findings that the endothelium is very important in active fluid transport out of the stroma (3Fischbarg J. Lim J.J. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1974; 241: 647-675Crossref Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 5Kuang K., Li, Y. Wen Q. Wang Z., Li, J. Yang Y. Iserovich P. Reinach P.S. Sparrow J. Diecke F.P. Fischbarg J.

Indeed, we found that exposure of the corneal endothelium to hypotonic saline resulted in prompt swelling followed by recovery even in the continued presence of a hypotonic perfusate. Recovery was blocked by the Na+/K+ pump inhibitor ouabain, confirming the involvement of active solute transport across the corneal endothelium. AQP1 deletion produced a remarkable delay in the reduction of corneal thickness after swelling, which was observed as a grossly opaque cornea in the first hour after swelling. The delay was seen when the corneal epithelial surface was covered with oil, implicating an abnormality of the corneal endothelium. The simplest explanation for the delayed recovery in AQP1 null mice is the impairment of osmotically driven water transport out of the stroma across the corneal endothelium in response to active salt extrusion out of the stroma. However, the adequacy of this explanation is uncertain because of the modest water permeability of the corneal endothelium even after AQP1 deletion. Improved understanding is needed of the mechanism by which solute and water flow are coupled in the corneal endothelium. Alternative explanations that cannot be excluded at this time include down-regulation of active solute transport across the corneal endothelium in AQP1 null mice or changes in stromal properties of the thinned cornea, such as increased imbibition pressure. Also, the possibility cannot be excluded that other as yet unidentified non-water-transporting functions of AQP1 are responsible for the impaired recovery after corneal swelling. In summary, the deletion of AQP5 in mice increases corneal thickness and reduces osmotic water permeability across the corneal epithelium. AQP1 deletion reduces corneal thickness and osmotic water permeability across the corneal endothelium and impairs the restoration of corneal transparency after experimental swelling. As discussed above, these phenomena might be explained by acute and chronic effects of reduced water permeability across the corneal epithelium for AQP5 deletion and the corneal endothelium for AQP1 deletion. The inhibition of AQP5 or AQP1 by non-toxic blockers may thus alter corneal structure and water content. The up-regulation of AQP1 in corneal endothelium may be particularly useful in reducing corneal edema and improving transparency after injury.

Here, we examined integrin-mediated antiapoptotic signals from laminin-10/11 in comparison with those from fibronectin, the best characterized extracellular adhesive ligand. We found that the activation of protein kinase B/Akt in cells adhering to laminin-10/11 can rescue cell apoptosis induced by serum removal. Consistent with this, wortmannin, a specific inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, or ectopic expression of a dominant-negative mutant of Akt selectively accelerated cell death upon serum removal. In contrast to laminin-10/11, fibronectin rescued cells from serum depletion-induced apoptosis mainly through the extracellular signal-regulated kinase pathway. Cell survival on fibronectin but not laminin was significantly reduced by treatment with PD98059, a specific inhibitor of mitogen- or extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase-1 (MEK1) and by expression of a dominant-negative mutant of MEK1. Laminin-10/11 was more potent than fibronectin in preventing apoptosis induced by serum depletion. These results, taken together, demonstrate laminin-10/11 potency as a survival factor and demonstrate that different extracellular matrix components can transduce distinct survival signals through preferential activation of subsets of multiple integrin-mediated signaling pathways.

Normal epithelial cells deprived of matrix attachment undergo programmed cell death, a form of apoptosis termed anoikis (3Frisch S.M. Francis H. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 619-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (2749) Google Scholar). Malignant transformation by oncogenic Ras can prevent this process of apoptosis after denial of ECM attachment (3Frisch S.M. Francis H. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 619-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (2749) Google Scholar) or withdrawal of survival factors (4Downward J. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1998; 8: 49-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar).One approach to study the effects of ECM signals independently of signals from other extracellular sources has been to deprive cells of serum and then to analyze the effects of specific ECM ligands on cellular functions such as adhesion, migration, and survival. Using this approach, many cell biologic functions of ECM signals have been elucidated (2Schwartz M.A. Schaller M.D. Ginsberg M.H. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1995; 11: 549-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (1461) Google Scholar). Most studies of integrin-mediated signaling events have been performed on cells adhering to FN through the α5β1 integrin, which seems to be involved in regulating apoptosis triggered by serum deprivation in many cell types (5Zhang Z. Vuori K. Wang H. Reed J.C. Ruoslahti E. Cell. 1996; 85: 61-69Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar, 6O'Brien V. Frisch S.M. Juliano R.L. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 224: 208-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). This integrin has also been reported to protect neuronal cells against apoptosis triggered by β-amyloid peptide (7Matter M.L. Zhang Z. Nordstedt C. Ruoslahti E. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1019-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). In breast epithelial cells, the α6β1 integrin receptor for laminin-1 has been shown to cooperate with insulin-signaling pathways to protect cells from apoptosis (8Farrelly N. Lee Y.J. Oliver J. Dive C. Streuli C.H. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 1337-1348Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). In endothelial cells, functional inhibition of the αvβ3 integrin can lead to programmed cell death (9Brooks P.C. Montgomery A.M. Rosenfeld M. Reisfeld R.A., Hu, T. Klier G. Cheresh D.A. Cell. 1994; 79: 1157-1164Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2169) Google Scholar). Thus, several distinct integrins have been implicated in protection against apoptosis in different cell types. However, the signaling events transduced by the α3β1integrin, the major receptor for laminin-10/11 (LN-10/11) and LN-5, remain unclear. In addition, it is also not known whether α3β1 integrin-mediated signals differ from those transduced by the α5β1 integrin.Several signal transduction components, including focal adhesion kinase (FAK) (10Frisch S.M.

However, some studies suggest that integrins are able to activate at least some of these pathways independently of FAK (24Wary K.K. Mainiero F. Isakoff S.J. Marcantonio E.E. Giancotti F.G.

Recently, increasing evidence has emerged showing that PI 3-kinase and its downstream effector Akt play key roles in the regulation of cell survival. For example, signals through the PI 3-kinase/Akt pathway protect Madin-Darby canine kidney cells against apoptosis mediated by denial of cell anchorage or by radiation (27Khwaja A. Downward J. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1017-1023Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). It was found that cell death in this system was inhibited by expression of a constitutively activated form of Akt (13Khwaja A. Rodriguez-Viciana P. Wennstrom S. Warne P.H. Downward J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2783-2793Crossref PubMed Scopus (932) Google Scholar,27Khwaja A. Downward J. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1017-1023Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the ERK pathway has also been found to enhance cell survival (28Erhardt P. Schremser E.J. Cooper G.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5308-5315Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 29Yujiri T. Sather S. Fanger G.R. Johnson G.L. Science. 1998; 282: 1911-1914Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar).Laminins are the major components of the basement membrane. Cells bind directly to laminins via a subset of integrins (30Colognato H. Yurchenco P.D. Dev. Dyn. 2000; 218: 213-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (1035) Google Scholar) and other nonintegrin receptors, such as α-dystroglycans (31Montanaro F. Lindenbaum M. Carbonetto S. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 1325-1340Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). All laminins are composed of α, β, and γ chains. The α5-containing laminins, LN-10 (α5β1γ1) and LN-11 (α5β2γ1) are widely expressed in fetal and adult tissues (32Miner J.H. Lewis R.M. Sanes J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28523-28526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 33Sorokin L.M. Pausch F. Frieser M. Kroger S. Ohage E. Deutzmann R. Dev. Biol. 1997; 189: 285-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Recently, we purified LN-10/11 from conditioned medium of A549 human lung carcinoma cells and found that the α3β1 integrin is the preferred receptor for LN-10/11 (34Kikkawa Y. Sanzen N. Sekiguchi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15854-15859Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 35Kikkawa Y. Sanzen N. Fujiwara H. Sonnenberg A. Sekiguchi K. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 869-876Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). LN-10/11 is more active than FN in promoting cell migration, and it preferentially activates Rac, but not Rho, via the p130cas -CrkII-DOCK180 pathway. Cells adhering to FN develop stress fibers and focal contacts, whereas cells adhering to LN-10/11 do not, suggesting that LN-10/11 and FN have distinct effects on integrin-mediated cell spreading and migration (36Gu J. Sumida Y. Sanzen N. Sekiguchi K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27090-27097Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar).In this study, the first goal was to determine whether α3β1 integrin-mediated signals from LN-10/11 could rescue A549 cells from apoptosis induced by serum deprivation. We describe here that LN-10/11 has more survival potential than FN. The second goal was to identify pathway(s) that transduce the survival signals from LN-10/11. We report that survival signals from LN-10/11 are mainly through the PI 3-kinase/Akt pathway, whereas survival signals from FN are conveyed by MEK1/ERK through FAK.DISCUSSIONThe α3β1 integrin-mediated signaling events triggered by cell adhesion to LN-10/11 are quite different from those triggered by adhesion to FN. LN-10/11 preferentially activates Rac, but not Rho, through an α3β1integrin-dependent pathway involving a p130cas -CrkII-DOCK180 complex, thereby strongly promoting cell migration through enhanced formation of lamellipodia. FN, however, preferentially activates Rho rather than Rac, leading to enhanced stress fiber and focal contact formation (36Gu J. Sumida Y. Sanzen N. Sekiguchi K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27090-27097Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). In this study, we analyzed intracellular signaling pathways regulating cell survival of A549 human lung adenocarcinoma cells by focusing on two distinct signaling pathways involving PI 3-kinase/Akt and MEK1/ERK; although separate, these pathways might potentially engage in cross-talk. We found that LN-10/11 is more potent than FN in suppressing apoptosis induced by serum deprivation. The antiapoptotic effects of LN-10/11 could be inhibited by the PI 3-kinase inhibitor wortmannin, whereas the antiapoptotic effects of FN were inhibited by the MEK1 inhibitor PD98059; these contrasting findings indicate that different ECMs selectively modulate different intracellular signaling pathways to sustain cell survival. These findings were further confirmed by expression of dominant negative Akt and MEK1, which compromised the ability of LN-10/11 and FN to transduce survival signals, respectively. Our results provide clear evidence that different signaling pathways leading to cell survival are activated on different ECM ligands (i.e. on FN and LN-10/11) (Fig. 7). Since laminins are the major components of the basement membrane of epithelium, our work supports the notion that a function of the basement membrane is to provide distinctive cell survival signals for establishment and maintenance of epithelial tissue.LN-10/11 Is More Potent Than FN in Protecting Cells against Apoptosis-induced by Serum DepletionInteractions of cells with the ECM through integrins are known to suppress apoptosis in many cell types. Mammary epithelial cells cultured on collagen I show extensive apoptosis over periods of several days, whereas the same cells do not when in contact with LN-1 or Matrigel, a basement membrane-like gel containing laminin-1, collagen IV, nidogen, and perlecan (39Pullan S. Wilson J. Metcalfe A. Edwards G.M. Goberdhan N. Tilly J. Hickman J.A. Dive C. Streuli C.H. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 631-642Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, LN-1 may not be a survival ligand for other cells, since endothelial cells undergo apoptosis on an LN-1 substrate while being protected from apoptosis on FN or vitronectin substrates (24Wary K.K. Mainiero F. Isakoff S.J. Marcantonio E.E. Giancotti F.G. Cell. 1996; 87: 733-743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar). Thus, different cell types may have their own favored ECM for protection from apoptosis, depending on the repertoire of integrins expressed on their cell surface, which in turn may define the types of ECM ligands most potent for protection from apoptosis. Our present studies are based on comparisons of the signaling events and abilities of LN-10/11 and FN to rescue A549 cells from serum depletion-induced apoptosis. Since α3β1 and α5β1 integrins serve as the dominant adhesion receptors for LN-10/11 and FN, respectively, the distinct apoptotic responses of cells on LN-10/11 and FN mirror the distinct signaling pathways downstream of the α3β1and α5β1 integrins (Fig. 7). Our data show that LN-10/11 is more potent than FN in preventing apoptosis induced by serum depletion, suggesting that the α3β1integrin transduces potent survival signals when bound to LN-10/11. This is consistent with the closely overlapped distribution of α3β1 integrin and its major ligand LN-10/11. In fact, the α3β1 integrin is predominantly expressed on many kinds of epithelial cells that deposit laminin-10 and laminin-11 as the major components of their basement membrane. It should be noted, however, that signaling pathways on distinct ECM ligands are usually context-dependent and may not be the same in different cell types. Our conclusions based on analyses of A549 lung carcinoma cells remain to be generalized to other cell types.PI 3-Kinase/Akt Pathway Is Essential for LN-10/11 Survival SignalsCell adhesion to ECM triggers integrin-mediated downstream phosphorylation cascades involving the ERK type of mitogen-activated protein kinase and PI 3-kinase, providing possible mechanisms for ECM-dependent cell survival (1Giancotti F.G. Ruoslahti E. Science. 1999; 285: 1028-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (3787) Google Scholar, 2Schwartz M.A. Schaller M.D. Ginsberg M.H. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1995; 11: 549-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (1461) Google Scholar). It remains to be determined, however, whether the survival signals from different ECM ligands are transduced by distinct signaling pathways. Activation of the PI 3-kinase/Akt pathway provided a potent antiapoptotic signal in cells adhering to LN-10/11, whereas activation of the MEK1/ERK pathway was necessary for survival of cells adhering to FN. To our knowledge, this is the first report to provide a clear distinction between the signaling pathways that rescue a cell from apoptosis on different ECM ligands.Accumulating evidence indicates that the PI 3-kinase/Akt pathway is critical for preventing apoptosis (42Downward J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 262-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (1180) Google Scholar). Anoikis resulting from denial of integrin-mediated adhesion involves reduced signaling through the PI 3-kinase/Akt pathway (42Downward J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 262-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (1180) Google Scholar). Our results show that the α3β1 integrin, when compared with α5β1, selectively activates the PI 3-kinase/Akt pathway, thereby exerting its potent antiapoptotic effects. The evidence for a specific connection between α3β1 integrin and the PI 3-kinase/Akt pathway includes the facts that the antiapoptotic effects of LN-10/11 but not FN are reversed by wortmannin or expression of a dominant-negative Akt mutant. The stronger activation of Rac in cells adhering to LN-10/11 than in those adhering to FN (36Gu J. Sumida Y. Sanzen N. Sekiguchi K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27090-27097Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) may also contribute to enhance cell survival on LN-10/11; Rac activation has been shown to protect epithelial cells against anoikis through activation of the PI 3-kinase/Akt pathway (43Coniglio S.J.

Hibner U. Coniglio S.J. Jou T.S. Symons M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 6706-6717Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), although the precise mechanisms of the cross-talk between PI 3-kinase and Rac in cell survival remain to be clarified. Protection of Madin-Darby canine kidney cells from anoikis by overexpression of a membrane-anchored, constitutively activated form of FAK has been described (10Frisch S.M. Vuori K. Ruoslahti E. Chan-Hui P.Y. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 793-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (987) Google Scholar); the mechanism might involve cross-talk activation between the hyperactivated FAK and PI 3-kinase pathways (45Reiske H.R.

Chem. 1999; 274: 12361-12366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar) or some alternative mechanism.Our results do not imply that the α3β1integrin is the only integrin capable of activating the PI 3-kinase/Akt pathway, since cell type-specific differences are known. Mammary epithelial cells utilize the α6β1 integrin to transduce cell survival signals that are dependent on the PI 3-kinase/Akt pathway (8Farrelly N. Lee Y.J. Oliver J. Dive C. Streuli C.H. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 1337-1348Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). In contrast to our results, α5β1 integrin regulation of cell survival in rat intestinal epithelial cells has been shown to modulate the PI 3-kinase/Akt pathway (14Lee J.W. Juliano R.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 1973-1987Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), whereas our data showed that FN protected A549 cells against apoptosis mainly through the MEK1/ERK pathway. The central role of the MEK1/ERK pathway in survival of A549 cells on FN was supported by the proapoptotic effects of PD98059 or the overexpression of dominant negative MEK1 mutant on cells adhering to FN. Consistent with our observations, the Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade has been shown to function as a survival signaling pathway; thus, sustained activation of this pathway efficiently rescues fibroblasts and epithelial cells from anoikis (15Le Gall M. Chambard J.C. Breittmayer J.P. Grall D. Pouyssegur J. Van Obberghen-Schilling E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 1103-1112Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Besides PI 3-kinase/Akt and ERK pathways, activation of c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase has also been shown to be involved in apoptosis (46Frisch S.M. Vuori K. Kelaita D. Sicks S. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1377-1382Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 47Tournier C. Hess P. Yang D.D., Xu, J. Turner T.K. Nimnual A. Bar-Sagi D. Jones S.N. Flavell R.A. Davis R.J. Science. 2000; 288: 870-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (1535) Google Scholar). Almeida et al. (18Almeida E.A. Ilic D. Han Q. Hauck C.R. Jin F. Kawakatsu H. Schlaepfer D.D. Damsky C.H. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 741-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar) reported that activation of the c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase pathway, but not the PI 3-kinase/Akt or ERK signaling pathways, is essential for protecting primary rabbit synovial fibroblasts against apoptosis induced by serum depletion on FN-coated substrates, indicating that distinct signaling pathways play critical roles in integrin-mediated survival signals.Prolonged Activation of Akt or ERK Is Substrate-dependentAlthough this study showed that the initial activation of Akt or ERK (e.g. 10 min after replating; see Fig. 3) was observed in cells adhering to either LN-10/11 or FN, prolonged basal activation of Akt or ERK was observed only in cells adhering to LN-10/11 or to FN, respectively. The basal levels of activated Akt and/or ERK seem to be important for protecting cells against apoptosis induced by serum removal, as demonstrated by the experiments using wortmannin and PD98059 and expression of their dominant negative mutants. The precise mechanisms of specific activation of Akt and ERK by different ECM ligands remain to be elucidated. Several lines of evidence indicate that integrins with different α subunits activate mitogen-activated protein kinases via different signaling pathways (1Giancotti F.G. Ruoslahti E. Science. 1999; 285: 1028-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (3787) Google Scholar). For example, a subset of integrins including the α5β1 integrin can recruit the transmembrane protein caveolin-1 and the adaptor protein Shc, thereby activating the ERK pathway. Recently, it has been reported that Rho has an essential role in integrin- and growth factor receptor-mediated signaling pathways that lead to sustained ERK activation and subsequent cyclin D1 regulation (48Welsh C.F. Assoian R.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1471: M21-M29PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the prolonged basal activation of ERK on FN could be explained by the observations that in certain cells, FN preferentially activates Rho but not Rac, whereas LN-10/11 preferentially activates Rac but not Rho (36Gu J. Sumida Y. Sanzen N. Sekiguchi K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27090-27097Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The α subunits of α3β1 and α6β1associate with a group of TM4SF proteins (49Hemler M.E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 578-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). The TM4SF proteins may associate with protein kinase C and phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase, linking these integrins to phosphoinositide signaling pathways (50Yauch R.L. Berditchevski F. Harler M.B. Reichner J. Hemler M.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 2751-2765Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). It remains to be examined, however, whether TM4SF proteins are involved in the prolonged basal activation of Akt on LN-10/11 via association with α3β1.FN Survival Signals Are FAK-dependent, whereas LN-10/11 Survival Signals Are FAK-independentA rapid increase in the tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK at multiple sites has been identified as a prominent early event in integrin-mediated cell adhesion that regulates cell proliferation, migration, and apoptosis (23Schlaepfer D.D. Hauck C.R. Sieg D.J. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1999; 71: 435-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (1026) Google Scholar, 51Hanks S.K. Polte T.R. Bioessays. 1997; 19: 137-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). Autophosphorylation of FAK at Tyr-397 has emerged as a crucial event in FAK-mediated signal transduction, since the phosphorylation of FAK at Tyr-397 triggers the formation of molecular complexes with other signaling proteins including Src family kinases (52Cobb B.S. Schaller M.D. Leu T.H. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 147-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar, 53Xing Z. Chen H.C. Nowlen J.K. Taylor S.J. Shalloway D. Guan J.L. Mol. Biol.

Science. 1998; 280: 1614-1617Crossref PubMed Scopus (1073) Google Scholar). Our data showed that FAK phosphorylation at Tyr-397 was more prominently induced in cells adhering to FN than to LN-10/11, supporting the previous observation that the level of overall tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK was lower in cells adhering to LN-10/11 than in those adhering to FN (36Gu J. Sumida Y. Sanzen N. Sekiguchi K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27090-27097Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Together with the observation that expression of FRNK substantially impaired survival of cells on FN with minimal effects when cells were on LN-10/11, our results suggest that FAK is an essential component in survival signaling on FN but not on LN-10/11.The role of FAK in integrin-mediated ERK activation is complex. Schlaepfer et al. (55Schlaepfer D.D. Jones K.C. Hunter T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2571-2585Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar, 57Schlaepfer D.D. Hanks S.K. Hunter T. van der Geer P.

N. Engl. J. Med. 1986; 134: 488-500Crossref Scopus (4027) Google Scholar). Injury stimulates signaling and transcriptional pathways in vascular smooth muscle cells, stimulating their migration and proliferation, and the eventual formation of a neointima. c-Jun, a prototypical member of the basic region-leucine zipper protein family, is transiently induced following arterial injury in animal model (2Miano J.M. Vlasic N. Tota R.R. Stemerman M.B. Arterioscl. Thromb. 1993; 13: 211-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 3Miano J.M. Tota R.R. Vlasic N. Danishefsky K.J. Stemerman M.B. Am. J.

Invest. 2000; 30: 11-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). c-Jun forms both homodimers and heterodimers with other bZIP proteins to form the AP-1 transcription factor. While investigations over the last decade have linked AP-1 with proliferation, tumorigenesis and apoptosis, AP-1 has also been implicated in tumor suppression and cell differentiation (5Wagner E.F. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 2334-2335Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Recent reports indicate that c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase/stress-activated protein kinase (JNK),1 an upstream activator of c-Jun and numerous other transcription factors, is expressed by smooth muscle cells in human and rabbit atherosclerotic plaques (6Nishio H. Matsui K. Tsuji H. Suzuki K. Histochem. J. 2001; 33: 167-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 7Metzler B., Hu, Y. Dietrich H. Xu Q. Am. J. Pathol. 2000; 156: 1875-1886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) and that dominant negative JNK inhibits neointima formation after balloon injury (8Izumi Y. Kim S. Namba M. Yasumoto H. Miyazaki H. Hoshiga M. Kaneda Y. Morishita R. Zhan Y. Iwao H. Circ. Res. 2001; 88: 1120-1126Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). c-Jun, however, has not been localized in human atherosclerotic lesions nor has it been shown to play a role in arterial repair after injury. Investigation of the precise regulatory role of c-Jun in the injured artery wall, or indeed in other pathologic settings, has been hampered by the lack of a specific pharmacological inhibitor. DNAzymes represent a new class of gene-targeting agent with specificity conferred by the sequence of nucleotides in the two arms flanking a catalytic core, with advantages over ribozymes of substrate specificity and stability (9Santoro S.W. Joyce G.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4262-4266Crossref PubMed Scopus (1284) Google Scholar, 10Kuwabara T. Warashina M. Tanabe T. Tani K. Asano S. Taira K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3074-3091Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). DNAzymes specific for c-Jun would be useful as molecular determinants of c-Jun biological function. To date, neither c-Jun nor indeed any other Jun family member has been targeted using catalytic nucleic acid strategies. Here, we demonstrate that sequence-specific DNAzyme targeting c-Jun cleaves c-Jun RNA and inhibits inducible c-Jun protein expression and proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells, with potency exceeding its exact non-catalytic antisense oligodeoxynucleotide equivalent. Moreover, the DNAzyme abrogates smooth muscle cell repair after injuryin vitro and neointima formation in rat carotid arteriesin vivo. These findings demonstrate the regulatory role of c-Jun in neointima formation in the injured artery wall. DNAzymes were synthesized by Oligos Etc. with a 3′-3′-linked inverted T and purified by high performance liquid chromatography. A 32P-labeled 668-nt c-Jun RNA transcript was prepared by in vitro transcription (using T7 polymerase) of pBluescript containing the insert, cut previously withXbaI. Reactions were performed in a total volume of 20 μl containing 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5 pmol of in vitrotranscribed substrate, and 10 pmol of DNAzyme, unless dose-dependent cleavage experiments were performed. Reactions were allowed to proceed for various times at 37 °C and quenched by transferring an aliquot to tubes containing formamide loading buffer. Samples were run on 12% denaturing polyacrylamide gels and autoradiographed overnight at −80 °C. Smooth muscle cells derived from human and porcine coronary arteries were obtained from Cell Applications, Inc. (San Diego, CA) and cultured in Waymouth's medium, pH 7.4, containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, and 50 IU/ml penicillin at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. In all in vitro experiments, smooth mucle cells were not used beyond passage 7. Transfections were performed in smooth muscle cells 6 h after the change of medium to serum-free and again at the time of serum stimulation 24 h after the start of arrest, using FuGENE 6 according to the manufacturer's instructions (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). In proliferation assays, growth-arrested smooth muscle cells in 96-well plates (Nunc-InterMed) were transfected with the indicated concentration of DNAzyme or oligonucleotide, then exposed to 5% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C for 72 h. The cells were trypsinized and the suspension quantitated in an automated Coulter counter. In wounding assays, confluent smooth muscle cells in chamber slides (Nunc-InterMed) transfected with 0.5 μm DNAzyme were injured by scraping with a sterile toothpick. Cells were treated with mitomycin C (Sigma) (20 μm) for 2 h prior to injury to block proliferation. Seventy-two h after injury, the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, fixed with formaldehyde, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Western immunoblot, and immunohistochemical analysis on human carotid endarterectomy specimens, were performed using rabbit polyclonal anti-peptide antibodies targeting c-Jun and Sp1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) as described elsewhere (11Khachigian L.M. Lindner V. Williams A.J. Collins T. Science. 1996; 271: 1427-1431Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). Sprague-Dawley rats (450 g males) were anesthetized using ketamine (60 mg/kg, intraperitoneal) and xylazine (8 mg/kg, intraperitoneal). The left common and external carotid arteries were exposed via a midline neck incision, and a ligature was applied to the external carotid proximal to the bifurcation. Two-hundred μl (at 4 °C) containing DNAzyme (750 μg), of FuGENE6 (30 μl), MgCl2 (1 mm), and P127 Pluronic gel (BASF) was applied around the vessel, 6 h prior to and again at the time of ligation. The solution gelified after contact with the vessel at 37 °C. The incision was sutured and the rats allowed to recover. Animals were sacrificed 21 days after injury by lethal injection of ketamine/xylazine and perfusion fixed with 10% (v:v) formaldehyde at 120 mm Hg. Carotids were placed in 10% formaldehyde, embedded in 3% (w:v) agarose, fixed in paraffin, and sectioned 1000 μm from the tie. Neointimal and medial areas in 5-μm sections stained with hematoxylin and eosin were determined morphometrically and expressed as a mean ratio per group of six rats. Fig.1 demonstrates c-Jun expression by smooth muscle cells in the human atheromatous lesion. c-Jun is poorly, if at all, expressed by smooth muscle cells in the normal media. In contrast, the zinc finger transcription factor Sp1 is expressed in both the intima and media (Fig. 1). Seven DNAzymes (Fig.2 A), bearing two nine-nucleotide hybridizing arms and a single 15-nt catalytic motif (“10–23” (6Nishio H. Matsui K. Tsuji H. Suzuki K. Histochem. J. 2001; 33: 167-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar)) targeting various regions of low free energy (12Zuker M. Science. 1989; 244: 48-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (1728) Google Scholar), were evaluated for their capacity to cleave 32P-labeledin vitro transcribed c-Jun RNA. The seven DNAzymes and c-Jun transcript were first resolved by denaturing electrophoresis to ensure structural integrity (Fig. 2 B). The 668-nt c-Jun transcript was cleaved by DNAzymes Dz10, Dz12, Dz13, Dz14 and Dz15, but not by Dz9 and Dz11, within 1 h at 37 °C under physiological conditions (Fig. 2 B). One of the active DNAzymes, Dz13, targeting the G1311U junction (where the translational start site in human c-Jun mRNA is located at A1261UG), cleaved the transcript within 15 min in both a time-dependent (Fig.2 C, upper panel) and dose-dependent (Fig. 2 C, lower panel) manner, generating 474- and 194-nt products. DNAzyme Dz13scr, in which the hybridizing arms of Dz13 were scrambled without disturbing the integrity of the catalytic domain, failed to cleave the substrate at any time or stoichiometric ratio (Fig. 2 C). To demonstrate Dz13 inhibition of endogenous c-Jun in primary human arterial smooth muscle cells, we performed Western blot analysis on growth-quiescent cells previously transfected with 0.5 μm Dz13 or Dz13scr and exposed to serum for 2 h at 37 °C. Serum-inducible c-Jun immunoreactivity (39 kDa) was strongly inhibited by Dz13, whereas its scrambled counterpart has no effect (Fig. 2 D). We next determined the influence of Dz13 and the panel of c-Jun DNAzymes on the growth of primary vascular smooth muscle cells derived from human and porcine arteries. The Dz13 target site in c-Jun RNA is conserved between human, pig, and rat except for a single C nt at position 1319, which is an A in pig and rat c-Jun RNA (Fig.3 A, upper andmiddle panels). DNAzyme catalytic efficiency is largely unaffected by substitution of a single pyrimidine nt in the substrate with a purine (13Santoro S.W. Joyce G.F. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 13330-13342Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar), as in this case. Dz13 (0.5 μm) completely blocked serum-inducible proliferation in both cell types (Fig. 3, B and C) and was the most potent of the entire DNAzyme panel. Dz13 inhibition was dose-dependent and detectable at concentrations as low as 100 nm (Fig.3 D). In contrast, Dz13scr failed to inhibit smooth muscle cell proliferation (Fig. 3 B), consistent with its inability to affect serum-inducible c-Jun protein (Fig. 2 D). Surprisingly, some DNAzymes (Dz9, Dz11, Dz15) stimulated proliferation beyond the effect of serum alone (Fig. 3, B andC). Additionally, Dz10, which cleaved the c-Jun transcript as effectively as Dz13 (Fig. 2 B), failed to modulate smooth muscle cell proliferation in either cell type, unlike Dz13 (Fig. 3,B and C). To demonstrate greater potency of the c-Jun DNAzyme compared with its exact antisense oligonucleotide counterpart, we generated As13 which, like Dz13, comprises a phosphodiester backbone and a 3′-3′-linked inverted T, but has no catalytic core (Fig. 3 A). As13 produced dose-dependent inhibition, however, Dz13 was twice as potent an inhibitor (Fig. 3 D). Smooth muscle cell regrowth at the wound edge following mechanical scraping in an in vitro model (14Santiago F.S. Atkins D.A. Khachigian L.M. Am. J. Pathol. 1999; 155: 897-905Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) was abolished by the presence of 0.5 μm Dz13 (Fig.4), whereas repair in the presence of Dz13scr was not different from wells without oligonucleotide (Fig. 4and data not shown). Since smooth muscle cell proliferation and repair are processes negatively regulated by Dz13, we next determined whether the c-Jun DNAzyme could influence intimal thickening after ligation injury to rat carotid arteries. Neointima formation 3 weeks after injury, and local administration of Dz13scr was not significantly different from that observed in the vehicle alone group (Fig.5, A and B). However, intimal thickening was suppressed by Dz13 of the order of 60% (Fig. 5, A and B). Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that Dz13 blocked the induction of c-Jun immunoreactivity in the smooth muscle cells of the arterial media, whereas Dz13scr had no effect (Fig. 5 C). In contrast, neither DNAzyme had any influence on levels of Sp1 (Fig. 5 C). Together, these data demonstrate a crucial role for c-Jun in smooth muscle cell proliferation, wound repair, and neointima formation.Figure 5Blockade of neointimal thickening in rat common carotid arteries.

By directly comparing a phosphodiester-linked DNAzyme with an antisense oligonucleotide targeting the same sequence in c-Jun mRNA, each of identical arm length and bearing a 3′-3′-inverted T, this study demonstrates for the first time superior inhibition by the former molecule at any given concentration. c-Jun DNAzymes could serve as new, more potent gene-specific tools to probe the precise function(s) of this transcription factor in a wide array of fundamental cellular processes. All the c-Jun DNAzymes screened in this specification have targeted regions in the mRNA likely to be exposed, based on a Zukerian prediction of regions of low free energy in the mRNA (12Zuker M.

The present study shows that Zuker analysis does not guarantee the efficacy of any given DNAzyme in intact cells, since only some, but not all, the DNAzyme sequences that cleave in vitro transcribed c-Jun mRNA could actually inhibit cell proliferation. This may be due (although not confined) to differences in conformation and site accessibility between in vitro transcribed mRNA and endogenous mRNA, DNAzyme transfection efficiency, the concentration of ions and other DNAzyme cofactors in the local cellular millieu, and the possible existence of DNA-binding proteins (such as growth factors, signaling molecules, etc.) having unintended preference for certain nucleotide sequences, thereby reducing the amount of bioavailable DNAzyme. That c-Jun, or indeed any other given gene, is inducibly expressed in the artery wall following balloon angioplasty does not necessarily translate to it playing a positive regulatory role in transcription, proliferation, or neointima formation. For example, our own work shows that three transcriptional repressors (NAB2, GCF2, and YY1) are activated in vascular smooth muscle cells by mechanical injuryin vitro, as well as in the rat artery wall. NAB2 directly binds the zinc finger transcription factor Egr-1 and represses Egr-1-mediated transcription (20Silverman E.S. Khachigian L.M. Santiago F.S. Williams A.J. Lindner V. Collins T. Am. J. Pathol. 1999; 155: 1311-1317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). GCF2 is a potent repressor of the expression of PDGF-A, a well established mitogen for vascular smooth muscle cells, and inhibits smooth muscle cell proliferation (21Khachigian L.M. Santiago F.S.

Similarly, YY1 overexpression blocks smooth muscle cell growth without affecting endothelial cell proliferation (22Santiago F.S. Lowe H.C. Bobryshev Y.V. Khachigian L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41143-41149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Second, c-Jun can repress, as well as activate, transcription. c-Jun binds the corepressor TG-interacting factor to suppress Smad2 transcriptional activity (23Pessah M. Prunier C. Marais J. Ferrand N. Mazars A. Lallemand F. Gauthier J.M. Atfi A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6198-6203Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). c-Jun also blocks transforming growth factor β-mediated transcription by repressing the transcriptional activity of Smad3 (24Dennler S. Prunier C. Ferrand N. Gauthier J.M. Atfi A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28858-28865Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Finally, c-Jun can inhibit, as well as stimulate, proliferation. Using antisense oligonucleotides to c-jun, Kanatani and colleagues (25Kanatani Y. Kasukabe T. Okabe-Kado J. Hayashi S. Yamamoto- Yamaguchi Y. Motoyoshi K. Nagata N. Honma Y. Cell Growth Differ. 1996; 7: 187-196PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrated that inhibition of human monocytoid leukemia cell growth by tumor growth factor-β and dexamethasone is mediated by enhanced c-Jun expression. These oligonucleotides dose-dependently decrease the growth inhibitory effect of tumor growth factor-β and dexamethasone (25Kanatani Y. Kasukabe T. Okabe-Kado J. Hayashi S. Yamamoto- Yamaguchi Y. Motoyoshi K. Nagata N. Honma Y. Cell Growth Differ. 1996; 7: 187-196PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, strategies targeting c-Jun are not predictive of a specific molecular and cellular consequence. Investigation of the precise regulatory role of c-Jun in the injured artery wall has been compromised because of the unavailability of a gene-specific inhibitor. Angiopeptin, a synthetic cyclic octapeptide analogue of somatostatin, inhibit the induction of c-jun and neointima formation after balloon injury to rabbit aortae (26Bauters C. Van Belle E.

Angiopeptin, however, also blocks c-fosactivation in the artery wall (26Bauters C. Van Belle E. Wernert N. Delcayre C. Thomas F. Dupuis B. Lablanche J.M. Bertrand M.E. Swynghedauw B.

https://openalex.org/W2073489309,"Syndecan-4 is a heparan sulfate-carrying core protein that has been directly implicated in fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) signaling. Recent studies have suggested that many signaling proteins localize to the raft compartment of the plasma cell membrane. To establish whether syndecan-4 is present in the raft compartment, we have studied the distribution of the core protein and an Fc receptor (FcR)-syndecan-4 chimera prior to and following clustering with FGF2 or antibodies. Whereas unclustered syndecan-4 was present predominantly in the non-raft membrane compartment, clustering induced extensive syndecan-4 redistribution to the rafts as demonstrated by the sucrose gradient centrifugation and life confocal microscopy. Although syndecan-4 and caveolin-1 moved in tandem, syndecan-4 was not present in caveolae, a major subset of raft compartments. We conclude that syndecan-4 clustering induces its redistribution to the non-caveolae raft compartment. This process may play an important role in syndecan-4-mediation of FGF2 signaling.

Syndecans, a four-member family of transmembrane proteoglycan core proteins, are found in a wide spectrum of cells and engage in a variety of interactions including binding growth factors, growth factor receptors, matrix proteins such as fibronectin and vitronectin, lipids, and others with biologically active molecules (1Tumova S. Woods A. Couchman J.R. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2000; 32: 269-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar, 2Zimmermann P. David G. FASEB J. 1999; 13: S91-S100Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All syndecans carry both heparan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate chains on their extracellular domain and engage in PDZ (Postsynaptic density 95, Disk large, Zona occludens-1)-dependent interaction via conserved intracellular domains (1Tumova S. Woods A. Couchman J.R. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2000; 32: 269-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar, 2Zimmermann P. David G. FASEB J. 1999; 13: S91-S100Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Syndecan-4 is a unique member of the syndecan core protein family. Unlike other syndecans, it possesses a phosphoinositol 4,5-bisphosphate binding site in its cytoplasmic tail that allows it to bind and activate protein kinase Cα (3Oh E.S. Woods A. Couchman J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8133-8136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 4Horowitz A. Simons M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25548-25551Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Syndecan-4 is found on endothelial cells and is directly involved in the regulation of FGF2-induced cell growth and migration (5Simons M. Horowitz A. Cell. Signalling. 2001; 13: 855-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar).Although previous studies have shown that syndecan-4 is predominantly found on the basolateral plasma cell membrane and focal adhesions (6Couchman J.R. Chen L. Woods A. Int. Rev. Cytol. 2001; 207: 113-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 7Woods A. Couchman J.R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 578-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), little information is available regarding its association with various membrane subdomains. Recent studies have suggested that rafts, lipid-ordered microdomains enriched by cholesterol and sphingolipids, act as platforms for conducting a variety of cellular functions such as vesicular trafficking and signal transduction (8Waugh M.G. Minogue S. Anderson J.S. dos Santos M. Hsuan J.J. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2001; 29: 509-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 9Galbiati F. Razani B. Lisanti M.P. Cell. 2001; 106: 403-411Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). Therefore, we have conducted this study to determine whether activation of syndecan-4 signaling initiated by its oligomerization on the plasma cell membrane leads to its appearance in the membrane rafts.Several protein families have been reported to modify lipid rafts structurally and functionally. These include integral membrane proteins such as caveolins and flotillins, exoplasmic glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) 1The abbreviations used are: GPIglycosylphosphatidylinositolFcRFc receptor Ia CD64FcR-S4Fc receptor-syndecan-4 chimeraFLAERAlexa-488-conjugated inactive variant of the protein proaerolysinHRPhorseradish peroxidaseEGFPenhanced green fluorescent proteinRFPECRat fad pad endothelial cellsDMEMDulbecco's modified Eagle's mediumBSAbovine serum albuminFGF2fibroblast growth factor 21The abbreviations used are: GPIglycosylphosphatidylinositolFcRFc receptor Ia CD64FcR-S4Fc receptor-syndecan-4 chimeraFLAERAlexa-488-conjugated inactive variant of the protein proaerolysinHRPhorseradish peroxidaseEGFPenhanced green fluorescent proteinRFPECRat fad pad endothelial cellsDMEMDulbecco's modified Eagle's mediumBSAbovine serum albuminFGF2fibroblast growth factor 2 -linked proteins such as Thy-1 and alkaline phosphatase, and receptor tyrosine kinases among others (9Galbiati F. Razani B. Lisanti M.P. Cell. 2001; 106: 403-411Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). Caveolin integration into the microenvironment of a lipid raft leads to raft invagination and formation of caveolae (9Galbiati F. Razani B. Lisanti M.P. Cell. 2001; 106: 403-411Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar, 10Pralle A. Keller P. Florin E.L. Simons K. Horber J.K. J.

Biol. 1999; 19: 7289-7304Crossref PubMed Scopus (918) Google Scholar). Caveolae are formed in many cell types including endothelial cells (12Schnitzer J.E., Oh, P. Jacobson B.S. Dvorak A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1759-1763Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar), and they may play a role in modulation of cell signaling. One hypothesis suggests that interactions of caveolins with signaling molecules regulate their activation status.Because FGF2-induced syndecan-4-dependent signaling requires the presence of heparan sulfate chains on core protein extracellular domain (13Volk R. Schwartz J.J., Li, J. Rosenberg R.D. Simons M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24417-24424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), it is reasonable to hypothesize that FGF2 induces aggregation of syndecan-4 complexes in the plasma cell membrane. However, because FGF2 induces a number of other signaling events that may affect syndecan-4 movement in the plasma cell membrane in manner independent of oligomerization of its extracellular domains, we linked the extracellular domain of the human Fc receptor (FcR)-Ia to the transmembrane/cytoplasmic domains of syndecan-4. The resultant chimera can then be aggregated with an immunoglobulin, mimicking FGF2-induced syndecan-4 oligomerization. We found that aggregation of syndecan-4 cores leads to a shift of syndecan-4 complexes from the non-raft to raft microdomains of the plasma cell membrane. Although syndecan-4 motion was synchronous with movements of caveolin-1, syndecan-4 was not present in the caveolae portion of the plasma membrane rafts.RESULTSTo study the distribution of syndecan-4 core protein in the plasma cell membrane and examine the effect of ligand clustering on its spatial localization, we linked the cytoplasmic and the transmembrane domains of syndecan-4 to the extracellular domain of the Fc receptor. To demonstrate the expression of the FcR-S4 chimera on the cell surface, FcR-S4 construct and empty vector-transfected cells were subjected to fluorescence-assisted cell sorting using fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled non-immune IgG that specifically recognizes Fc receptor and anti-syndecan-4 ectoplasmic domain antibodies. FcR expression was noted only on the FcR-S4 construct-transfected cells (Fig. 1A). Furthermore, the expression of the native syndecan-4 was not affected by FcR-S4 expression (Fig. 1A). To demonstrate that the cytoplasmic tails of FcR-S4 chimeras interact with native syndecan-4 proteins, RFPEC cells expressing FcR-S4 construct were decorated with non-immune IgG. The clustering of FcR-syndecan-4 complexes was then performed with the anti-IgG antibody. Clustered and unclustered RFPEC were then lysed and subjected to immunoprecipitation with the antibody against the ectoplasmic domain of syndecan-4 followed by Western blotting with an anti-FcR (CD64) antibody. Both clustered and unclustered cells demonstrated the presence of FcR-S4-syndecan-4 complexes (Fig. 1B).The distribution of syndecan-4 in the plasma cell membrane was examined by subjecting whole cells lysates of RFPEC-expressing FcR-S4 construct to sucrose density gradient centrifugation. Blotting of the syndecan-4 antibody-immunoprecipitated material from various sucrose gradient fractions demonstrated the core protein presence in both heavy (40% sucrose) and light (10–15% sucrose) fractions (Fig. 2A, right panel). The lighter fractions contain plasma membrane raft proteins as shown by blotting with HRP-conjugated cholera toxin subunit β, which specifically binds to the raft marker GM1 (Fig. 2A, left panel). In the absence of antibody clustering, most of syndecan-4 appeared in the non-raft membrane fractions. Antibody clustering of FcR-S4 chimeras induced a pronounced shift toward the raft-containing fractions (Fig. 2A, right panel). The specificity of HRP-conjugated cholera toxin subunit β-GM1 binding for the detection of raft fractions of the membrane was tested by Dot-blot analysis of Triton X-100-soluble and insoluble portion of the plasma cell membrane (Fig. 2B). As expected, only the Triton X-100-insoluble fraction was labeled with the cholera toxin.Figure 2Clustering induces syndecan-4 redistribution into the lipid rafts.A, sucrose gradient analysis. Raft membrane microdomains from cell surface biotinylated RFPEC were isolated using flotation on discontinuous sucrose gradients. Gradient fractions containing rafts were detected using HRP-conjugated cholera toxin subunit β that identifies the presence of the raft marker GM1 (left panel). The distribution of FcR-S4 in the gradient fractions was determined by immunoprecipitation of each fraction with the anti-syndecan-4 cytoplasmic domain antibody. The precipitated material was then Dot-blotted, and syndecan-4 was detected by HRP-conjugated streptavidin (right panel). Note that prior to clustering most of syndecan-4 is present in the non-raft sucrose fractions with a shift toward the raft fraction following antibody clustering of FcR-S4 constructs. B, raft microdomains are present in Triton X-100-insoluble fractions. To demonstrate the presence of raft microdomains in the Triton X-100-insoluble fraction, RFPEC was subjected to lysis in Triton X-100 at 4 °C as described under “Materials and Methods.” 20 or 200 μl of each fraction were blotted on the nitrocellulose filter, which was then probed with the HRP-conjugated cholera toxin subunit β. Note the presence of GM1 signal only in Triton X-100-insoluble fractions. C, antibody clustering induces the shift of FcR-S4 chimeras from non-raft to raft membrane microdomains. RFPEC-expressing FcR-syndecan-4 decorated with non-immune IgG were subjected to cold Triton X-100 extraction followed by immunoprecipitation with antibodies against the cytoplasmic domain of syndecan-4 and Western blotting with HRP-streptavidin. Prior to clustering (−), syndecan-4 is predominantly found in the soluble (non-raft) fraction (lanes 1 and 2), whereas the antibody clustering of FcR-syndecan-4 chimeras (+) induces pronounced shift toward the insoluble (raft) fraction (lanes 3 and 4) lipid rafts. Cholesterol depletion of the plasma cell membrane with β-cyclodextrin led to a pronounced reduction in clustering the induced shift of syndecan-4 toward the raft fraction (lanes 5 and 6). D, FGF2 treatment shifts native syndecan-4 to the raft microdomains. RFPEC treated with FGF-2 were cell surface-biotinylated and then subjected to Triton X-100 extraction at 4 °C followed by immunoprecipitation with antibodies against the cytoplasmic domain of syndecan-4 and Western blotting with HRP-streptavidin. Note paucity of syndecan-4 protein in the raft fraction prior to FGF2-induced clustering (lanes 1 and 2) and a pronounced shift toward the raft fraction following FGF2 treatment (lanes 3 and 4).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To further explore the relationship between clustering and syndecan-4 redistribution into the raft compartment, we studied syndecan-4 appearance in the Triton X-100-insoluble (raft) and soluble (non-raft) fractions of plasma cell membranes. Equal numbers of FcR-S4 expressing cells were subjected to lysis in Triton X-100 as described under “Materials and Methods.” The Triton X-100-soluble and insoluble fractions were then immunoprecipitated with anti-syndecan-4 antibody, separated on SDS-PAGE, and subjected to Western blotting with HRP-streptavidin. Prior to antibody clustering of FcR-S4 chimeras, essentially all of syndecan-4 was in the Triton X-100-soluble fraction (Fig. 2C). Antibody clustering induced redistribution of ∼50% cell surface syndecan-4 to the Triton X-100-insoluble fraction. Because the formation of membrane rafts depends on high local cholesterol ester content, we disrupted raft formation by depleting membrane cholesterol by treating cells with β-cyclodextrin. Such cholesterol depletion almost fully prevented clustering-induced syndecan-4 redistribution into the rafts compartment (Fig. 2C).Because clustering of the native syndecan-4 with its natural ligands such as FGF2 may potentially have a different effect on its plasma membrane dispersal than antibody clustering of FcR-S4 chimeras, we have examined the effect of FGF2 treatment on syndecan-4 distribution in RFPEC cells. Similar to the FcR-S4 chimera antibody clustering studies, FGF2 induced a significant redistribution of syndecan-4 from Triton X-100-soluble to insoluble fraction (Fig. 2D).To confirm localization of clustered syndecan-4 to plasma membrane rafts, we used vital confocal microscopy with anti-syndecan-4 antibody and the GPI-anchor marker FLAER in RFPEC. Following antibody clustering of FcR-S4 chimeras, FLAER imaging demonstrated prominent raft clusters on the apical plasma cell membrane (Fig. 3, top left panel). Staining with a labeled non-immune IgG that detects FcR-S4 chimeras demonstrated equally prominent FcR-S4 clusters on the apical plasma cell membrane (Fig. 3, top middle panel). The merged image demonstrates that essentially all FcR-S4 chimeras overlapped with FLAER labeling (Fig. 3, top right panel), consistent with syndecan-4 presence in the FLAER-labeled rafts. The specificity of staining was confirmed by FLAER and non-immune IgG labeling of the vector-transfected RFPEC (Fig. 3, bottom panels) that demonstrated the absence of FcR-S4 signal.Figure 3FcR-Syndecan-4 co-localizes with the GPI-anchored protein marker FLAER in RFPEC. Confocal images of live RFPEC transfected with the FcR-S4 construct (top) or vector control (bottom). Prior to immunolabeling, cells were subjected to antibody clustering of FcR-S4 chimeras as described under “Materials and Methods.” Labeling with the GPI-anchored proteins marker FLAER (green) is shown in the left panel, whereas labeling of FcR-S4 using biotinylated non-immune IgG visualized by Cy-5-conjugated streptavidin is shown in the middle panel. The merged image is shown in the right panel. Note a virtually complete overlap of FcR-S4 signal with the FLAER signal. Because there is a large excess of GPI proteins compared with FcR-S4 chimeras, not all FLAER signal demonstrates co-localization with the FcR-S4 signal. Note the absence of FcR-S4 signal in vector-transfected cells (bottom panels).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Caveolae constitute a distinct subpopulation of cholesterol-rich rafts. To see whether syndecan-4 is present in caveolae, we generated RFPEC cells expressing EGFP-tagged caveolin-1. Live confocal microscopy showed no co-localization between syndecan-4 and caveolin-1 (Fig. 4A) and coordinated the movement of the two proteins (movie file). To explore the effect of syndecan-4 clustering on its association with caveolae, we used time-lapse microscopy to visualize syndecan-4 movement in caveolin-1-EGFP-expressing RFPEC cells. The reconstruction of time stacks of syndecan-4-caveolin-1 images in the x and y plane demonstrated that although both proteins moved together, they did not localize to the same cellular compartment (Fig. 4B). Western blots with an anti-caveolin-1 antibody failed to detect its presence among proteins present in the syndecan-4 immunoprecipitations (data not shown). To control for the effect of EGFP expression on the cellular distribution of caveolin-1-EGFP chimeric protein, RFPEC were transiently transfected with an EGFP construct. A visualization of EGFP demonstrated diffuse distribution of the protein in the cytoplasm (Fig. 4C), quite distinct from the appearance of caveolin-1-EGFP protein. Syndecan-4 staining is present along the cell border (Fig. 4C).Figure 4FcR-Syndecan-4 associates with caveolae.A, syndecan-4 association with caveolae.

An associated movie file demonstrates co-movement of syndecan-4 and caveolin-1. Time-lapse series of 48 images from the inset were acquired with a 2.5-s interval.

Movement of the caveolin-1-EGFP (green) and syndecan (red) signals were tracked over time in x and y planes. The graphs display the relative motion along the y (top) and x (bottom) axis over time. Note the tandem movement but lack of overlap of the two proteins.C, EGFP expression in RFPEC.

The DIC image of live RFPEC-expressing EGFP is overlaid with the EGFP (green) and FcR-S4 (red) signals. Note a diffuse cytoplasmic distribution of EGFP that is quite distinct from the appearance of caveolin-1-EGFP.

Meyer M.E. Williams K.J. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 607-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), cell adhesion (6Couchman J.R. Chen L. Woods A. Int. Rev.

However, the molecular events involved in these activities are not well understood. Previous studies have shown that in Chinese hamster ovary cells, syndecan-1 is found upon clustering in the Triton X-100-insoluble regions of the membrane (23Carey D.J. Bendt K.M. Stahl R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15253-15260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) and that this event may play a role in syndecan-1-mediated lipid endocytosis (21Fuki I.V. Meyer M.E. Williams K.J. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 607-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 24Williams K.J. Methods Mol. Biol. 2001; 171: 457-477PubMed Google Scholar). Although syndecan-1 and syndecan-4 share significant homologies in the transmembrane and cytoplasmic regions domains, which are the regions thought to play a role in clustering-induced aggregation in membrane rafts, there are also significant differences. Syndecan-4 is a unique member of the syndecan core protein family because of its ability to engage in FGF2 signal transduction. Furthermore, no data have previously been available regarding the effect of FGF2 binding on syndecan-4 clustering and the occurrence of this event in polarized endothelial cells.Because FGF2 treatment induces a number of cellular events that can potentially affect membrane syndecan-4 trafficking, we employed FcR-syndecan-4 chimeras to study the effect of syndecan clustering on its localization in the plasma cell membrane. The use of extracellular domain of Fc receptor is particularly convenient, because Fc receptor is not expressed in endothelial cells and non-immune IgG can be used to decorate cells expressing Fc receptor. The chimera protein behaves in a mode analogous to the native syndecan-4. It is present on the cell surface, it forms complexes with the native syndecan-4, and its expression does not affect the expression of the native protein. Therefore, FcR-S4 clustering behavior is representative of ligand clustering of the native syndecan-4.We find that in quiescent endothelial cells, FcR-S4 chimeras as well as native syndecan-4 are present mostly in the non-raft fraction of the membrane and that the aggregation of FcR-S4 chimeras with antibodies or syndecan-4 with FGF2 leads to a rapid redistribution of the proteins to the membrane rafts. Several independent pieces of data are consistent with this interpretation including sucrose gradients, Western blotting of various membrane fractions, and life confocal microscopy.Two principle raft subdomains are caveolae-containing and caveolae-free rafts. Interestingly, syndecan-4 did not co-localize with caveolin-1, suggesting that it was not present in the caveolae but rather in the non-caveolae rafts. The absence of caveolin-1 in the syndecan-4-immunoprecipitated material further argues against direct interaction between these proteins. At the same time, the clustering of FcR-S4 chimeras led to close apposition, but apparently not the binding, of syndecan-4 and caveolae and a complex-coordinated movement of both proteins.Although we have not examined which portion of the syndecan-4 molecule mediates its association with plasma membrane rafts, the transmembrane domain and the immediately adjacent highly cationic cytoplasmic domain are the likely candidates by association with syndecan-1. Of note, the presence of the phosphoinositol 4,5-bisphosphate binding domain in syndecan-4 (absent in syndecan-1) does not inhibit its localization to the raft subdomain. The presence of plasma membrane cholesterol is clearly required for this event as its depletion led to a virtually complete loss of syndecan-4 enrichment in Triton X-100-insoluble regions.Although syndecan-4 clustering with its signaling agonist FGF2 induces its redistribution to non-caveolae rafts, the functional significance of this event is unclear. One possibility is that this serves to bring syndecan-4 in close contact with FGF receptors. Because FGF receptor-dependent activation of a protein phosphatase is needed for the activation of syndecan-4 signaling (16Horowitz A. Simons M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10914-10918Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), syndecan-4 movement into rafts would serve to facilitate this connection. Alternatively, raft localization of syndecan-4 complexes may bring it in close contact with other signaling complexes, thereby promoting cross-talk among various receptor pathways.In summary, ligand-dependent clustering of syndecan-4 in primary endothelial cells leads to its concentration in non-caveolae rafts. This event may play a role in the regulation of syndecan-4 signaling. Syndecans, a four-member family of transmembrane proteoglycan core proteins, are found in a wide spectrum of cells and engage in a variety of interactions including binding growth factors, growth factor receptors, matrix proteins such as fibronectin and vitronectin, lipids, and others with biologically active molecules (1Tumova S. Woods A. Couchman J.R. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2000; 32: 269-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar, 2Zimmermann P. David G. FASEB J. 1999; 13: S91-S100Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All syndecans carry both heparan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate chains on their extracellular domain and engage in PDZ (Postsynaptic density 95, Disk large, Zona occludens-1)-dependent interaction via conserved intracellular domains (1Tumova S. Woods A. Couchman J.R. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2000; 32: 269-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar, 2Zimmermann P. David G. FASEB J. 1999; 13: S91-S100Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Syndecan-4 is a unique member of the syndecan core protein family. Unlike other syndecans, it possesses a phosphoinositol 4,5-bisphosphate binding site in its cytoplasmic tail that allows it to bind and activate protein kinase Cα (3Oh E.S. Woods A. Couchman J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8133-8136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 4Horowitz A. Simons M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25548-25551Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Syndecan-4 is found on endothelial cells and is directly involved in the regulation of FGF2-induced cell growth and migration (5Simons M. Horowitz A. Cell. Signalling. 2001; 13: 855-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Although previous studies have shown that syndecan-4 is predominantly found on the basolateral plasma cell membrane and focal adhesions (6Couchman J.R. Chen L. Woods A. Int. Rev. Cytol. 2001; 207: 113-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 7Woods A. Couchman J.R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 578-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), little information is available regarding its association with various membrane subdomains. Recent studies have suggested that rafts, lipid-ordered microdomains enriched by cholesterol and sphingolipids, act as platforms for conducting a variety of cellular functions such as vesicular trafficking and signal transduction (8Waugh M.G. Minogue S. Anderson J.S. dos Santos M. Hsuan J.J. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2001; 29: 509-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 9Galbiati F. Razani B. Lisanti M.P. Cell. 2001; 106: 403-411Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). Therefore, we have conducted this study to determine whether activation of syndecan-4 signaling initiated by its oligomerization on the plasma cell membrane leads to its appearance in the membrane rafts. Several protein families have been reported to modify lipid rafts structurally and functionally. These include integral membrane proteins such as caveolins and flotillins, exoplasmic glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) 1The abbreviations used are: GPIglycosylphosphatidylinositolFcRFc receptor Ia CD64FcR-S4Fc receptor-syndecan-4 chimeraFLAERAlexa-488-conjugated inactive variant of the protein proaerolysinHRPhorseradish peroxidaseEGFPenhanced green fluorescent proteinRFPECRat fad pad endothelial cellsDMEMDulbecco's modified Eagle's mediumBSAbovine serum albuminFGF2fibroblast growth factor 21The abbreviations used are: GPIglycosylphosphatidylinositolFcRFc receptor Ia CD64FcR-S4Fc receptor-syndecan-4 chimeraFLAERAlexa-488-conjugated inactive variant of the protein proaerolysinHRPhorseradish peroxidaseEGFPenhanced green fluorescent proteinRFPECRat fad pad endothelial cellsDMEMDulbecco's modified Eagle's mediumBSAbovine serum albuminFGF2fibroblast growth factor 2 -linked proteins such as Thy-1 and alkaline phosphatase, and receptor tyrosine kinases among others (9Galbiati F.

Caveolin integration into the microenvironment of a lipid raft leads to raft invagination and formation of caveolae (9Galbiati F. Razani B. Lisanti M.P.

https://openalex.org/W2087527298,"Forced expression of K10, a keratin normally expressed in postmitotic, terminally differentiating epidermal keratinocytes, inhibits the progression of the cell cycle in cultured cells (Paramio, J. M., Casanova, M. Ll., Segrelles, C., Mittnacht, S., Lane, E. B., and Jorcano, J. L. (1999) Mol. Cell. Biol. 19, 3086–3094). This process requires a functional retinoblastoma (pRb) gene product and is mediated by K10-induced inhibition of Akt and PKCζ, two signaling intermediates belonging to the phosphoinositide (PI) 3-kinase signal transduction pathway (Paramio, J. M., Segrelles, C., Ruiz, S., and Jorcano, J. L. (2001)Mol. Cell. Biol. 21, 7449–7459). Extending earlier in vitro studies to the in vivo situation, this work analyzes the alterations found in transgenic mice that ectopically express K10 in the proliferative basal cells of the epidermis. Increased expression of K10 led to a hypoplasic and hyperkeratotic epidermis due to a dramatic decrease in skin keratinocyte proliferation in association with the inhibition of Akt and PKCζ activities. The inhibition of cell proliferation and Akt and PKCζ activities was also observed although to a minor extent in low hK10-expressing mice. These animals displayed no overt epidermal phenotype nor overexpression of K10. In these non-phenotypic mice, ectopic K10 expression also resulted in decreased skin tumorigenesis. Collectively, these data demonstrate that keratin K10 in vivo functions include the control of epithelial proliferation in skin epidermis. Forced expression of K10, a keratin normally expressed in postmitotic, terminally differentiating epidermal keratinocytes, inhibits the progression of the cell cycle in cultured cells (Paramio, J. M., Casanova, M. Ll., Segrelles, C., Mittnacht, S., Lane, E. B., and Jorcano, J. L. (1999) Mol. Cell. Biol. 19, 3086–3094). This process requires a functional retinoblastoma (pRb) gene product and is mediated by K10-induced inhibition of Akt and PKCζ, two signaling intermediates belonging to the phosphoinositide (PI) 3-kinase signal transduction pathway (Paramio, J.

Collectively, these data demonstrate that keratin K10 in vivo functions include the control of epithelial proliferation in skin epidermis. Keratins are the main components of the intermediate filament cytoskeleton in epithelial cells. They are a large family of proteins that includes ∼30 different polypeptides expressed in a cell type- and differentiation-specific manner. Their functions have long been presumed to be predominantly structural. This role was clarified when human epithelial fragility syndromes became attributable to mutations within epidermal keratin genes (for reviews see Refs. 1Fuchs E.V. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 69: 899-902Google Scholar, 2Fuchs E.V. Weber K. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 345-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (1267) Google Scholar, 3Irvine A.D. McLean W.H.I. Br. J.

However, this shared function does not provide a clear explanation of the great diversity of these proteins, which suggests that they may have additional specific functions. Changes in keratin expression pattern are particularly important in the epidermis. Keratins K5 and K14 are expressed in the mitotically active basal cells. As these cells enter the terminal differentiation program, becoming postmitotic and suprabasal, keratins K5 and K14 are substituted by keratins K1 and K10 (5Fuchs E.V. Green H. Cell. 1980; 19: 1033-1042Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (804) Google Scholar). Under the influence of hyperproliferative stimuli, for example during wound healing and in certain disorders including cancer, epidermal expression of K1 and K10 is drastically reduced. Keratins K6 and K16, normally absent from interfollicular epidermis, are, however, induced (6Weiss R.A.R. Eichner R. Sun T.T. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 98: 1397-1406Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). As a whole, these changes suggest that each keratin pair provides specific functional requirements to epidermal keratinocytes. This is also highlighted by recent findings in which K16 was expressed ectopically (7Paladini R.D. Coulombe P.A. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 1185-1201Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) to rescue the epidermal fragility promoted by inactivation of the keratin K14 gene (8Lloyd C. Yu Q.C. Cheng J. Turksen K. Degenstein L. Hutton E. Fuchs E. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1329-1344Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). These rescued animals show neither epidermal fragility nor neonatal mortality, but they exhibit strong phenotypic alterations such as alopecia, chronic epidermal ulcers, and alterations in other stratified epithelia (7Paladini R.D. Coulombe P.A. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 1185-1201Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). This demonstrates that these two proteins are not functionally equivalent. In search of specific keratin functions, we have shown that the forced expression of particular keratin polypeptides may influence proliferation in cultured cells. It has been specifically demonstrated that the ectopic expression of keratin K10 inhibits cell proliferation (9Paramio J.M. Casanova M.Ll. Segrelles C. Mittnacht S. Lane E.B. Jorcano J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3086-3094Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The modulation of cell growth exerted by keratin K10 is linked to the retinoblastoma (pRb) protein and the molecular machinery controlling cell cycle progression during G1, in particular cyclin D1 expression (9Paramio J.M. Casanova M.Ll. Segrelles C. Mittnacht S. Lane E.B. Jorcano J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3086-3094Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). This activity appears to involve the sequestration of Akt/PKB and atypical PKCζ to the keratin cytoskeleton, mediated by keratin K10 through its amino terminus (10Paramio J.M. Segrelles C. Ruiz S. Jorcano J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7449-7459Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Therefore, the presence of K10 leads to impaired phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) 1The abbreviations used are: PI3Kphosphoinositide 3-kinaseTPA12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetateMEKmitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase 1The abbreviations used are: PI3Kphosphoinositide 3-kinaseTPA12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetateMEKmitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase signaling.

Bravo A. Jorcano J.L. Vidal M. Differentiation. 1994; 58: 53-64PubMed Google Scholar). These animals display severe alterations in their epidermis, including decreased proliferation, which results in epidermal hypoplasia. Impaired activation of both Akt and PKCζ kinase activities in the skin of these animals was also observed. Finally, chemical skin carcinogenesis protocols demonstrated that ectopic K10 expression inhibits the formation of tumors in vivo. The plasmid bK5hK10 was generated by placing the 5.2 kb of the bovine K5 regulatory sequences (SalI-NruI fragment) (11Ramirez A. Bravo A. Jorcano J.L. Vidal M. Differentiation. 1994; 58: 53-64PubMed Google Scholar) 5′-upstream of the human keratin K10 gene in plasmid HK10MC (12Blessing M. Rüther U. Franke W.W. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 743-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). This was performed using a SalI-Hin dIII digestion protocol. The plasmid pbK5Z, expressing the bacterial lacZ (β-galactosidase) gene under the bovine keratin K5 promoter, has been described previously (11Ramirez A. Bravo A. Jorcano J.L. Vidal M. Differentiation. 1994; 58: 53-64PubMed Google Scholar). The constructs were released from the backbone, purified, and used for microinjection. Transgenic mice were generated by injection of bK5hK10 or co-injection of both bK5Z (13Ramı́rez A. Milot E. Ponsa I. Marcos-Gutierrez C. Page A. Santos M. Jorcano J. Vidal M. Genetics. 2001; 158: 341-350PubMed Google Scholar) and bK5hK10 constructs into a (C57 BL/10 x BALB/c) F2 or a (C57BL/10 x DBA/2) F2 genetic background (13Ramı́rez A. Milot E. Ponsa I. Marcos-Gutierrez C. Page A. Santos M. Jorcano J. Vidal M. Genetics. 2001; 158: 341-350PubMed Google Scholar). The presence of the transgene was analyzed by Southern blots of tail DNA and quantified using phosphorimaging equipment (Bio-Rad). Primary keratinocyte cultures were established isolating keratinocytes from newborn mice and cultured in Eagle's minimal medium containing 8% chelex-treated serum and 0.03 mmCa2+ as described (14Hennings H.

Dorsal skin samples and tumors were fixed in either formalin or ethanol and embedded in paraffin prior to sectioning. 4-μm sections were stained with hematoxylin-eosin. Mice were injected with BrdUrd in phosphate-buffered saline (100 μg/g body weight) 1 h prior to sacrifice. To analyze the epidermal-labeling index, paraffin sections were stained using an anti-BrdUrd monoclonal antibody (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) following the manufacturer's instructions. Keratin K10 staining was performed in ethanol-fixed tissue sections using LH2 or K8.60 monoclonal antibodies (15Paramio J.M. Laı́n S. Segrelles C. Lane E.B. Jorcano J.L.

For ultrastructural analysis, skin samples were fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline and postfixed in 1% osmium tetroxide prior to dehydration and embedding in Epon 812 resin. Ultrathin sections were stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate. The expression of total and phosphorylated Akt was visualized by immunofluorescence using fresh cryosections of whole mouse skin essentially as previously described (10Paramio J.M. Segrelles C.

Vidal M. Genetics. 2001; 158: 341-350PubMed Google Scholar) to obtain single- and double-transgenic mice. Sixteen bK5Z+bK5hK10/TG.AC transgenic mice and 16 TG.AC littermates were used in chemical carcinogenesis experiments. The backs of 7-week-old animals were shaved and treated with TPA (Sigma; 10 nmol in 200 μl of acetone) three times a week for eight weeks. At this time, the TPA treatment was arrested. The number and size of tumors arising on each mouse were recorded at regular intervals during 50 weeks. The histopathological analysis of the tumors was routinely performed on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded histology sections. Whole skin extracts from newborn mice or primary keratinocytes were obtained in buffer A (1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 137 mm NaCl, 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 μg/ml aprotinin and leupeptin, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 mm NaF, 1 mmdisodium pyrophosphate, and 1 mm Na3VO4) or in Laemmli buffer for K10 detection. The Akt and PKCζ kinase activity assays were performed upon immunoprecipitation of the endogenous kinase proteins as previously reported (10Paramio J.M. Segrelles C. Ruiz S. Jorcano J.L. Mol. Cell.

To study keratin K10 functions in vivo, we have generated transgenic mice that ectopically express K10 in the basal layer of the epidermis using the bovine keratin K5 promoter (11Ramirez A. Bravo A. Jorcano J.L. Vidal M. Differentiation. 1994; 58: 53-64PubMed Google Scholar). Five transgenic lines bearing the bK5hK10 construct and eight bearing a co-injection of the bK5Z (carrying the β-galactosidase gene) and bK5hK10 constructs (13Ramı́rez A. Milot E. Ponsa I. Marcos-Gutierrez C. Page A. Santos M. Jorcano J. Vidal M. Genetics. 2001; 158: 341-350PubMed Google Scholar) were analyzed. The ectopic expression of hK10 in the basal layer of the epidermis of newborn and adult mice was confirmed by immunohistochemistry (Figs.1 A′ and 2 C′). This expression was absent in non-transgenic littermates (Figs.1 A and 2 C). All animals appeared healthy at birth, but by day 21 those (four founders) with high copy numbers of the bK5hK10 transgene (>10 copies) showed a clear phenotype characterized by small size, decreased weight, delayed growth, and paralysis of the rear extremities. This finally led to death between days 34 and 79. In agreement with the reported copy number dependence of the transgene expression (13Ramı́rez A. Milot E. Ponsa I. Marcos-Gutierrez C. Page A. Santos M. Jorcano J. Vidal M. Genetics. 2001; 158: 341-350PubMed Google Scholar), animals (nine founders) with lower transgene copy numbers showed no obvious phenotypic alterations or reduction in life span. However, when the bK5hK10 transgene was brought to homozygosity in these non-phenotypic animals, all the phenotypic characteristics were again observed. Western blots demonstrated a stronger expression of hK10 in homozygous than in heterozygous transgenic mice (Fig. 1 B).Figure 2Epidermal abnormalities in homozygous bK5hK10 transgenic mice.

In fact, the two-three layers of epidermal cells observed in non-transgenic littermates (Fig. 2 A) were reduced to a single cell layer with flattened and elongated cells (Fig. 2 A′). In addition, the stratum corneum was expanded, rendering a hyperkeratotic phenotype (Fig. 2, A and A′). These phenotypic changes suggested possible alterations in the proliferation and/or differentiation program of the epidermal cells. The expression of several differentiation markers in the epidermis of homozygous mice were therefore studied and compared with those of non-transgenic littermates. A similar pattern of expression was found for keratin 5 (Fig. 2, B and B′), loricrin (Fig. 2, D and D′), keratin K1 and F ilaggrin (not shown). However, the expression of keratin K6, which is normally confined to the outer root sheath of the hair follicle (see Fig. 6 E), was also observed in patches in some interfollicular regions of the transgenic mice. Interestingly, these K6-positive patches also showed a more normal epidermal morphology and thickness (Fig. 2 E′). To study the phenotype more closely, electron microscopic analyses were performed. In agreement with the histological studies, electron microscopy showed control animals to have a two-three-cell-deep epidermis with the nuclei of the basal layer regularly distributed (Fig. 2 A). However, in transgenic mice, only a single cell layer was observed (Fig. 3 A′). In addition, multiple abnormalities were observed in the epidermal cells of the transgenic mice. Abnormally flattened nuclei lying parallel to the basal membrane (Fig. 3 B) as well as degenerative mitochondria (Fig. 3 B) were frequently observed. Clear cytoplasmic areas depleted of organelles and suggestive of nuclear degeneration were observed around the nuclei (Fig. 3,A′ and C and data not shown). No differences were seen between control and transgenic cells in the number and structure of desmosomes and hemidesmosomes (arrows in Fig. 3,B and C, respectively). Finally, the keratin filaments appeared more densely packed in transgenic than in control cells (Fig. 3 C), resembling the intermediate filament bundles observed in suprabasal cells expressing keratins K1 and K10 (19Eichner R. Sun T.T. Aebi U. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 1767-1777Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). However, no keratin aggregates were observed in these basal cells (Fig. 3, B and C). This absence of keratin aggregates is of particular importance since they have been associated with keratin overexpression in cultured cells (20Paladini R.D. Coulombe P.A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 1035-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 21Paramio J.M. Jorcano J.L. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; 215: 319-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 22Takahashi K. Folmer J. Coulombe P.A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 505-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In addition, aggregates have also been linked to skin disorders caused by mutant keratins, including mutations in keratin K10 that give rise to epidermolytic hyperkeratosis (23Cheng J. Syder A.J. Yu Q.C. Letai A. Paller A.S. Fuchs E. Cell. 1992; 70: 811-819Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar, 24Fuchs E. Esteves R.A. Coulombe P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6906-6910Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). In agreement with the absence of keratin aggregates, no blisters or any sign of epidermal fragility were observed in the bK5hK10 transgenic mice. Because K10 expression in cultured cells inhibits progression of the cell cycle (9Paramio J.M. Casanova M.Ll. Segrelles C. Mittnacht S. Lane E.B. Jorcano J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3086-3094Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 10Paramio J.M. Segrelles C. Ruiz S. Jorcano J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7449-7459Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), epidermal cell proliferation in bK5hK10 transgenic mice was analyzed. In newborn skin, significant inhibition of BrdUrd incorporation was seen. This was greater in homozygous than in heterozygous transgenic mice, which showed decreased BrdUrd incorporation compared with non-transgenic littermates (Fig. 4, A, A′, A"", and B). A similar decrease in proliferation was also observed in the skin of adult transgenic mice, although the level of BrdUrd incorporation was reduced with respect to that of newborns due to the lesser proliferation of adult skin (Fig. 4 C). It is important to remark that this decreased proliferation was observed even in the absence of overt phenotypic changes, as in the case of low K10-expressing heterozygous mice irrespective of their age and in homozygous newborn epidermis (epidermal hypoplasia and hyperkeratosis appeared at days 21–30, see above). To extend these in vivo data, the proliferative potential of primary keratinocytes derived from heterozygous, homozygous, or non-transgenic newborn mice was studied. Two different parameters were considered: the capacity of these cells to incorporate BrdUrd and colony-forming efficiency (9Paramio J.M. Casanova M.Ll. Segrelles C. Mittnacht S. Lane E.B.

Both types of experiments clearly demonstrated the diminished proliferative potential of primary keratinocytes derived from homozygous transgenic mice compared with their heterozygous counterparts. In turn, the latter showed less proliferative potential than non-transgenic littermates (Fig. 5, A and B). Because K10-induced cell cycle arrest in cultured cells is associated with reduced cyclin D1 expression and, concomitantly, decreased pRb phosphorylation (9Paramio J.M. Casanova M.Ll. Segrelles C. Mittnacht S. Lane E.B. Jorcano J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3086-3094Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 10Paramio J.M. Segrelles C. Ruiz S. Jorcano J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7449-7459Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), these features were analyzed by Western blotting. A marked decrease in phosphorylated pRb and cyclin D1 expression was observed alongside a parallel increase in non-phosphorylated pRb in the homozygous samples. The levels observed in heterozygous animals were intermediate between homozygous and non-transgenic mice (Fig. 5 C). The mechanism underlying the inhibition of the cell cycle promoted by keratin K10 appears to be mediated in human keratinocytes by alterations in the PI3K signal transduction pathway. In fact, K10 sequesters Akt and PKCζ to the intermediate filament cytoskeleton and thus impairs translocation and subsequent activation (10Paramio J.M. Segrelles C. Ruiz S. Jorcano J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7449-7459Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). It was therefore investigated whether similar inhibition takes place in primary keratinocytes derived from bK5hK10 transgenic mouse epidermis. Whereas the levels of total Akt were similar in samples from the three different genotypes, those of phosphorylated, active Akt were severely reduced in heterozygous mice and barely detectable in homozygotes. The reduced Akt activation in primary keratinocytes derived from bK5hK10 transgenic mice invited studies to determine whether a similar inhibition takes place in the epidermis in vivo. In agreement with previous results (10Paramio J.M. Segrelles C. Ruiz S. Jorcano J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7449-7459Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), immunofluorescence studies revealed that Akt is strongly expressed throughout all epidermal layers in the epidermis of non-transgenic and homozygous mice (Fig. 6, A and A′). However, when an antibody that reacts with phosphorylated Akt was used, only the basal layer of the epidermis stained in non-transgenic animals (Fig. 6 B; see also Ref.10Paramio J.M. Segrelles C. Ruiz S. Jorcano J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7449-7459Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). This staining, indicative of activated Akt, was clearly reduced in the homozygous epidermis, suggesting a decreased Akt activation in these animals (Fig. 6 B′). Confirming these data, Western blot analyses using whole skin extracts demonstrated that, although the levels of Akt were similar for all three genotypes, the amounts of phosphorylated Akt in homozygous were lower than in non-transgenic mice (Fig. 6 D). Finally, the activities of endogenous Akt and PKCζ kinase were analyzed in total extracts from non-transgenic, heterozygous and homozygous mouse epidermis. Both activities were clearly diminished in the transgenic epidermis, particularly so in the homozygous extracts (Fig. 6 E). These results demonstrate that the presence of K10 in skin in vivo impairs the activation of Akt and PKCζ, as in cultured human keratinocytes (10Paramio J.M. Segrelles C. Ruiz S. Jorcano J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7449-7459Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The expression of K10 is rapidly down-regulated in epidermis under hyperproliferative stimuli including epidermal tumors (25Roop D.R. Krieg T.M. Mehrel T. Cheng C.K. Yuspa S.H. Cancer Res. 1988; 48: 3245-3252PubMed Google Scholar). This, together with results demonstrating that K10 expression inhibits cell proliferation in vivo (Fig. 3) and in vitro (Fig. 4; see also Refs. 10Paramio J.M. Segrelles C. Ruiz S. Jorcano J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7449-7459Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 11Ramirez A. Bravo A. Jorcano J.L. Vidal M. Differentiation. 1994; 58: 53-64PubMed Google Scholar), suggests that K10 expression may affect skin tumorigenesis. This hypothesis is reinforced by two recent observations. The partial reduction in tumor development observed in transgenic mice bearing K10 under the control of the bovine keratin K6β regulatory region (26Santos M. Ballestı́n C. Garcı́a-Martı́n R. Jorcano J.L. Mol. Carcinog. 1997; 20: 3-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), a keratin not expressed in interfollicular epidermis but strongly induced by hyperproliferative stimuli (27Ramirez A. Vidal M. Bravo A. Larcher F. Jorcano J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4783-4787Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Further, we have recently reported that Akt-dependent signaling, the process that results inhibited by K10 (10Paramio J.M. Segrelles C. Ruiz S. Jorcano J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7449-7459Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), plays a major role in mouse skin carcinogenesis (28Segrelles C. Ruiz S. Perez P. Murga C. Santos M. Budunova I.V. Martı́nez J.

Huntington disease, a neurological disorder characterized by selective loss of striatal and cortical neurons and manifest clinically by chorea and intellectual decline, results from polyglutamine expansion of huntingtin into the pathologic range of beyond 35 repeats. In an effort to understand the disease mechanism, several groups have identified proteins that associate with huntingtin. One such protein, HIP1, was identified in a yeast two-hybrid screen (1Kalchman M.A. Koide H.B. McCutcheon K. Graham R.K. Nichol K. Nishiyama K. Kazemi-Esfarjani P. Lynn F.C. Wellington C. Metzler M.

Binding of HIP1 to huntingtin is dramatically reduced following polyglutamine expansion, strongly implicating this interaction in the disease process. Subsequent to the identification of HIP1, a highly related protein (HIP12/HIP1R) was identified based on its homology to HIP1 (3Seki N. Muramatsu M. Sugano S. Suzuki Y. Nakagawara A. Ohhira M.

To further characterize the roles of HIP1 and HIP12 in clathrin-mediated endocytosis, we analyzed and compared the protein interaction and functional properties of these two proteins. Here, we report that HIP1 strongly associates with CCVs but unlike HIP12, does not bind directly to F-actin. In contrast, HIP12 does not demonstrate high affinity binding to clathrin and AP2 as seen for HIP1. However, HIP1 and HIP12 both bind directly to the clathrin light chain through their central helical domain that interestingly, stimulates clathrin assembly. These results suggest related but distinct functions for HIP1 and HIP12 in clathrin-mediated endocytosis and identify a novel interaction with clathrin light chain that appears to contribute to clathrin assembly. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies against HIP1 (HIP1FP) and HIP12 (HIP12FP) and a mouse monoclonal antibody against HIP1 (mAb HIP no. 9) were previously described (5Chopra V.S. Metzler M. Rasper D.M.

A construct encoding human full-length HIP12 with a C-terminal HA epitope tag was generated by insertion of a cDNA sequence, 5′-GGAGGTGGATATCCCTATGATGTCCCCGATTATGCC, encoding a linker of 3 glycines followed by the HA tag. The integrity of the HA-tagged HIP12 construct was verified by DNA sequencing. Bacterial fusion proteins encoding His6-tagged terminal domain of the clathrin heavy chain and the amino acids 276–335 of HIP1 fused to GST (GST-HIP1-(276–335)) were previously described (15Metzler M.

A His6-tagged construct encoding full-length clathrin light chain b was generated by subcloning the GFP-clathrin light chain b cDNA (kindly provided by Dr. Juan Bonifacino) into the pTrcHisB bacterial expression vector (Qiagen). The following HIP1 and HIP12 GST fusion proteins were created by PCR amplification from either full-length HIP1 or HIP12 cDNAs with subsequent cloning into pGEX-2T or pGEX-4T vectors (Amersham Biosciences): GST-HIP12-(302–348), GST-HIP1-(336–610), GST-HIP12-(349–644), GST-HIP1-(731–1003) (GST-HIP1-talin), and GST-HIP12-(765–1068) (GST-HIP12-talin). Rat brains were homogenized in buffer A (10 mm HEPES-OH, pH 7.4, 0.83 mm benzamidine, 0.23 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 μg/ml aprotinin, and 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin) and the homogenates were centrifuged at 205,000 × gmax for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant (cytosolic extract) was collected and Triton X-100 was added to 1% final concentration. Aliquots of the extract (2 mg) were incubated overnight at 4 °C with GST fusion proteins pre-coupled to glutathione-Sepharose beads. After incubation, samples were washed three times in buffer A containing 1% Triton X-100. For binding experiments, purified His6-tagged clathrin terminal domain or clathrin light chain b fusion proteins (15 μg) in buffer A were incubated overnight at 4 °C with various GST fusion proteins pre-coupled to glutathione-Sepharose beads. After incubation, samples were washed three times in buffer A. In all cases, proteins specifically bound to the beads were eluted with gel sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot. For pull-downs from transfected cells, HeLa cells were grown on 10-cm2 dishes and transfected with 6 μg of HIP1 or HIP12 cDNA using FuGENE (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Twenty-four h post-transfection, cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and lysed in buffer A (containing 1% Triton X-100 and 10 μm Pefa (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Samples were incubated overnight at 4 °C with GST fusion proteins pre-coupled to glutathione-Sepharose beads.

HEK-293T cells were grown on 10-cm2 plates and transfected with 4 μg of HIP12 cDNA by CaPO4− precipitation. Transfected and nontransfected cells were washed 24 h post-transfection with ice-cold PBS and lysed in ABL buffer (20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100) supplemented with a 1:100 dilution of aprotinin (Sigma), 20 ng/ml leupeptin (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and 10 μmPefa. The cell lysates were sonicated and centrifuged at 245,000 × gmax for 15 min. The supernatants were then incubated for 6 h at 4 °C with mouse monoclonal antibody HIP1 no. 9 pre-bound to protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). Subsequently, samples were washed 6 times in ABL buffer and specifically bound proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot. Cells were plated onto gelatinized glass slides in 6-well tissue culture plates and transfected with 1 μg of HIP1 or HIP12 cDNA. Twenty-four h post-transfection, the cells were washed in PBS, fixed in PBS containing 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature, and permeabilized in PBS containing 0.3% Triton X-100 and 1% paraformaldehyde for 5 min. The cells were then incubated in PBS containing 3% normal goat serum for 30 min to block nonspecific binding. Depending on the experiment, the cells were then incubated with monoclonal antibodies against the FLAG or HA epitopes for 1 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C with a polyclonal antibody against HIP1, followed by a 1-h incubation at room temperature with appropriate secondary antibodies in PBS containing 2% normal goat serum. Staining of the actin cytoskeleton was achieved by incubation with Texas Red-phalloidin. Cells were then extensively washed in PBS, mounted, and observed on a BioRad Radiance Plus confocal microscope (BioRad, Hercules, CA) using Laser Sharp software (BioRad). Purified human non-muscle monomeric actin (Cytoskeleton Inc.) was polymerized as described previously (4Engqvist-Goldstein A.E. Kessels M.M. Chopra V.S. Hayden M.R. Drubin D.G. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 1503-1518Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) and incubated with purified GST-HIP1-talin and GST-HIP12-talin (20 μg each) for 1 h at room temperature in a final volume of 50 μl. The samples were then centrifuged for 30 min at 362,000 ×gmax. Protein components of the pellets and supernatants were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie Blue staining. Gels were scanned on a ScanJet 6300 (Hewlett Packard) and protein amounts were determined using Quantity One (Bio-Rad) software. Statistical analysis was done by the Student's t test. CCVs were purified from adult rat brains as described (18Maycox P.R. Link E. Reetz A. Morris S.A. Jahn R. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 1379-1388Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). To purify clathrin, coats were stripped from the vesicles by incubation in buffer B (0.5 M Tris, pH 7.0, 2 mm EDTA, 0.83 mmbenzamidine, 0.23 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 μg/ml aprotinin, and 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin) for 15 min on ice. The samples were then centrifuged for 15 min at 245,000 ×gmax with the purified coat fraction remaining in the supernatant. The stripping and centrifugation steps were repeated a second time and the supernatants were pooled. The pooled supernatants were loaded onto a continuous 5–20% sucrose gradient made in buffer B and then centrifuged for 3.5 h at 195,000 ×gmax in a Sorvall Step Saver vertical rotor. Fractions of 2 ml were collected and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining. Peak clathrin fractions were pooled and dialyzed overnight in clathrin assembly buffer (10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.5) and subsequently used for clathrin assembly assays. Clathrin assembly assays were performed with 0.5 μmpurified clathrin and different concentrations (0.12–2 μm) of fusion proteins in a final volume of 90 μl of clathrin assembly buffer. Assembly was initiated at 4 °C by addition of 10 μl of 1 m MES, pH 6.7. The mixture was kept on ice for 45 min and then centrifuged at 400,000 ×gmax for 6 min. The supernatant (80 μl) was loaded on a SDS-PAGE and the clathrin assembly was quantified by Coomassie Blue staining. Both HIP1 and HIP12 have been implicated in clathrin-mediated endocytosis (4Engqvist-Goldstein A.E. Kessels M.M. Chopra V.S. Hayden M.R. Drubin D.G. J.

Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 1209-1223Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). To further characterize the endocytic functions of these proteins, we sought to directly compare their biochemical and functional properties. Both HIP1 and HIP12 are predominantly expressed in brain (1Kalchman M.A. Koide H.B. McCutcheon K. Graham R.K. Nichol K. Nishiyama K. Kazemi-Esfarjani P. Lynn F.C. Wellington C. Metzler M.

Colicelli J. Lehrach H. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1997; 6: 487-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Within brain, however, the two proteins demonstrate distinct developmental expression profiles (Fig. 1 A). Specifically, HIP1 is most highly expressed during early development, with the highest detectable levels at embryonic day 13 (E13) and E16, whereas HIP12 expression is only weakly detectable at E13 through E18 but increases in postnatal day 2 rats with high levels of expression in adult brain (Fig. 1 A). Interestingly, both HIP1 and HIP12 are highly enriched on the coats that are stripped from purified CCVs prepared from E18 brains (data not shown) and adult brains (Fig. 1 B). HIP1 and HIP12 show a comparable enrichment in the CCV fractions to both each other and to the coat proteins clathrin and AP2 (data not shown and Fig. 1 B). Moreover, both proteins appear to be major components of the clathrin coats (Fig. 1 C). To make this determination, coat proteins stripped from adult or E18 CCVs where fractionated on linear 5–20% sucrose gradients, which readily separated HIP1 and HIP12 from the large subunits of the adpatin complexes (Fig. 1 C). Coomassie Blue staining of the fractions revealed that HIP1 and HIP12 where present on E18 or adult rat brain CCVs, respectively, at near stoichiometric levels with adaptin subunits (Fig. 1 C). Earlier work in our laboratory has shown that HIP1 and HIP12 interact in the yeast two-hybrid system (5Chopra V.S. Metzler M. Rasper D.M. Engqvist-Goldstein A.E. Singaraja R. Gan L. Fichter K.M. McCutcheon K. Drubin D. Nicholson D.W. Hayden M.R. Mamm. Genome. 2000; 11: 1006-1015Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). To confirm this interaction, co-immunoprecipitation studies were performed in HEK-293T cells. Immunoprecipitation of endogenous HIP1 with a monoclonal antibody led to co-immunoprecipitation of endogenous HIP12 whereas no precipitation of HIP12 was seen in the absence of HIP1 antibody (Fig. 2 A). Transfection of the cells with HIP12 cDNA led to a significantly greater immunoprecipitation of HIP12 by endogenous HIP1 (Fig. 2 A). We next analyzed the intracellular localization of HIP1 and HIP12 in neuronal NT2 cells following transfection of HA-tagged HIP12. Confocal microscopy analysis of the expression of HIP12-HA shows punctate staining throughout the cell and extensive co-localization with endogenous HIP1 (Fig. 2 B). These punctae correspond predominantly to clathrin-coated pits and CCVs as previously described (4Engqvist-Goldstein A.E. Kessels M.M. Chopra V.S. Hayden M.R. Drubin D.G. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 1503-1518Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 15Metzler M. Legendre-Guillemin V. Gan L. Chopra V. Kwok A. McPherson P.S. Hayden M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39271-39276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). To determine the regions of HIP1 and HIP12 that mediate their interaction, pull-down experiments were performed. Previous studies have shown that a small fragment of HIP12 encompassing the helical domain interacts with HIP1 in the yeast two-hybrid system (5Chopra V.S. Metzler M. Rasper D.M. Engqvist-Goldstein A.E. Singaraja R. Gan L. Fichter K.M. McCutcheon K. Drubin D. Nicholson D.W. Hayden M.R. Mamm. Genome. 2000; 11: 1006-1015Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Therefore, we analyzed whether HIP1 and HIP12 interact through their helical domains. In fact, the helical domains of both HIP1 and HIP12 are sufficient to specifically pull-down HIP12 and HIP1, respectively (Fig. 2 C). These studies suggest that the HIP1-HIP12 interaction could affect specific functions of each protein. Between its ENTH and helical domains, HIP1 contains a clathrin-box consensus sequence, LMDMD, which binds to the terminal domain of the clathrin heavy chain (15Metzler M. Legendre-Guillemin V. Gan L. Chopra V. Kwok A. McPherson P.S. Hayden M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39271-39276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). This sequence is found in close association with the sequences FDNKF, FDDIF, FGSSF, and DPF, which match consensus sequences for binding to AP2 (17Mishra S.K. Agostinelli N.R. Brett T.J. Mizukami I. Ross T.S. Traub L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46230-46236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Upon sequence alignment, the LMDMD motif in HIP1 aligns with the sequence LIEIS in HIP12 (Fig. 3 A). The LIEIS sequence resembles a clathrin-box motif similar to that found in the clathrin-binding proteins ACK1 and ACK2 (20Yang W. Lo C.G. Dispenza T. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17468-17473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 21Teo M. Tan L. Lim L. Manser E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18392-18398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). In contrast, the DPF motif is absent from HIP12 and the FDNKF, FDDIF, and FGSSF sequences, which match the consensus FX(N/D/S)X(F/L) (17Mishra S.K. Agostinelli N.R. Brett T.J. Mizukami I. Ross T.S. Traub L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46230-46236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), are not conserved (Fig. 3 A). We thus designed a HIP1-GST fusion protein, GST-HIP1-(276–335), encompassing these sites (Fig. 3 B) and tested for its ability to bind clathrin and AP2 in comparison with a GST fusion protein encoding the corresponding region of HIP12, GST-HIP12-(302–348). As previously demonstrated (15Metzler M. Legendre-Guillemin V. Gan L. Chopra V. Kwok A. McPherson P.S. Hayden M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39271-39276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), GST-HIP1-(276–335) binds strongly to clathrin (Fig. 3 C, top panel). In contrast, GST-HIP12-(302–348) demonstrates much weaker clathrin binding (Fig. 3 C, top panel). In both cases, the binding is mediated through the terminal domain of the clathrin heavy chain (15Metzler M. Legendre-Guillemin V. Gan L. Chopra V. Kwok A. McPherson P.S. Hayden M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39271-39276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) (data not shown). Moreover, GST-HIP1-(276–335) binds strongly to AP2 whereas no binding of GST-HIP12-(302–348) to AP2 was detected (Fig. 3 C, bottom panel). HIP12 binds actin through its talin-homology domain (4Engqvist-Goldstein A.E. Kessels M.M. Chopra V.S. Hayden M.R. Drubin D.G. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 1503-1518Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). To determine whether the talin homology domain of HIP1 also mediates actin binding, a GST-HIP1-talin homology domain fusion protein was analyzed for co-sedimentation with F-actin. As a control, the talin homology domain of HIP12 was expressed as a GST fusion protein and analyzed in parallel. Surprisingly, in contrast to HIP12, HIP1 bind only very weakly to actin in vitro (Fig. 4 A). Specifically, in the presence of 5 μm F-actin, 87.6% ± 6.0 (mean ± S.E., n = 3) of GST-HIP12-talin homology domain was bound to F-actin. In contrast, only 19.3% ± 3.7 (mean ± S.E.,n = 3) of the GST-HIP1-talin homology domain was bound to the same amount of polymerized actin (Fig. 4 B). A number of different parameters such as pH and ion concentrations were tested for their potential effect on the binding of HIP1-talin to actin. However, none of these alterations allowed for increased binding (data not shown). Consistent with this observation is the lack of co-localization between the HIP1-talin homology domain and the cortical actin cytoskeleton following overexpression of HIP1-talin in cultured cells (Fig. 4 C). This is in contrast to the observation that the talin homology domain of HIP12 shows enrichment along cortical actin filaments (4Engqvist-Goldstein A.E. Kessels M.M. Chopra V.S. Hayden M.R. Drubin D.G. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 1503-1518Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). We previously demonstrated that GST-HIP1-(219–616), encompassing the clathrin box motif and the helical domain, demonstrated stronger binding to clathrin than GST-HIP1-(276–335) alone, encompassing only the clathrin box consensus site (15Metzler M.

This observation led us to suggest the presence of a second clathrin-binding site in the helical domain of HIP1 (15Metzler M. Legendre-Guillemin V. Gan L. Chopra V. Kwok A. McPherson P.S. Hayden M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39271-39276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Moreover, the helical domains of HIP1 and HIP12 were recently reported to mediate binding to clathrin (16Waelter S. Scherzinger E. Hasenbank R. Nordhoff E. Lurz R. Goehler H. Gauss C. Sathasivam K.

We thus designed fusion proteins encompassing the helical domains of HIP1, GST-HIP1-(336–610) and HIP12, GST-HIP12-(349–644) (Fig. 5 A) and tested their ability to bind clathrin and AP2. Both fusion proteins show specific binding to clathrin from brain extracts (Fig. 5 B,"

YidC is homologous to the mitochondrial Oxa1p and the chloroplast Alb3, which functions in a novel pathway for the insertion of membrane proteins from the mitochondrial matrix and chloroplast stroma, respectively. We find that Alb3 can functionally complement the Escherichia coli YidC depletion strain and promote the membrane insertion of the M13 procoat and leader peptidase that were previously shown to depend on the bacterial YidC for membrane translocation. In addition, the chloroplast Alb3 that is expressed in bacteria is essential for the insertion of chloroplast cpSecE protein into the bacterial inner membrane. Surprisingly, Alb3 is not required for the insertion of cpSecE into the thylakoid membrane.

In this paper, we test whether the chloroplast Alb3 can functionally complement a YidC depletion strain. We find that Alb3 can complement the growth defect of a YidC depletion strain and that Alb3 promotes the insertion of Lep and M13 procoat protein as well as the chloroplast SecE (cpSecE) protein into the bacterial inner membrane. Surprisingly Alb3 is not required for the membrane insertion of the cpSecE into the thylakoid membrane. These studies emphasize the importance of Oxa1p homologs for insertion of proteins into the E. coli inner membrane and reinforce the recent results that membrane insertion into chloroplast thylakoid membrane can be independent of Alb3 (31Woolhead C.A.

E. coli strain JS7131 (MC1060, ΔyidC, attB::R6Kori, ParaBAD−yidC+, (Specr)) was from our laboratory stocks. pMS119, which contains the tac promoter and lacIq, was used to express procoat and leader peptidase (Lep). pQE80 and pEH1 vectors, which contain the IPTG-inducible lacUV5 promoter, were used to express the light harvesting chlorophyll-binding protein (LHCP) and cpSecE, respectively. The cDNA sequence of Alb3 was amplified using the Arabidopsis thaliana cDNA library (from Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center at The Ohio State University) and cloned into pACYC184 (from New England Biolabs). The upstream region of the yidC gene including the promoter and ribosome-binding site was then cloned into the vector upstream from the alb3 start codon, yielding plasmid pACYC-Alb3. pACYC-mAlb3 was derived from pACYC-Alb3 where the predicted stroma-targeting sequence (1–55 amino acids) was replaced with a single methionine. XhoI and HpaI sites were introduced into the yidC and alb3 genes by site-directed mutagenesis, and then the two XhoI-HpaI fragments corresponding to 1–57 amino acids of YidC or Alb3 were swapped. The resulting plasmid, pACYC-H1Alb3, contains a yidC and alb3 fusion, which includes the first 57 amino acids of YidC, a linker valine residue, and 59–462 amino acids of Alb3. The three-gene constructs, Alb3, mAlb3, and H1Alb3, were also cloned into pMS119 under the tac promoter to overexpress the plasmid-encoded Albino3 proteins. The first 57 amino acids of YidC and H1Alb3 were replaced by 1–57 amino acids from the precursor to the maltose-binding protein (preMBP), yielding two constructs: MBP-YidC and MBP-Alb3. Clones for in vitro transcription and translation have been described previously: pLHCP (33Cline K. Fulsom D.R. Viitanen P.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 14225-14232Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), iOE33 (34Hulford A. Hazell L. Mould R.M. Robinson C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3251-3256Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and t23-PCm (35Henry R. Carrigan M. McCaffrey M., Ma, X. Cline K. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 823-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). PCR-based cloning was used to create mature cpSecE with a C-terminal Met. The C-terminal Met residue was added in order to visualize a protease-protected fragment of integrated cpSecE in thylakoid membranes. Using the plasmid pEH1cpSecE (36Froderberg L. Rohl T. van Wijk K.J. de Gier J.W. FEBS Lett. 2001; 498: 52-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) as template, the mature cpSecE coding sequence was amplified by PCR using the forward primer 5′-GCGAATTCACCATGGCGACGAGTAATCTG-3′ and the reverse primer 5′-GGTGTTCAAGACTTCTTCAGCATGTGAC-3′, which includes the ATG codon before the stop codon. An EcoRI site was included in the forward primer allowing the PCR products to be ligated into pGEM-4Z restricted with EcoRI and Hin cII. To place pElip2 in a direction suitable for transcription with SP6 RNA polymerase, PCR-based cloning of pElip2 was performed. To accomplish this, we used the parent plasmid (37Kim S.J. Jansson S. Hoffman N.E. Robinson C. Mant A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4715-4721Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) as a template and the forward primer, 5′-CACGATGGCCACAGCGTCGTTTAACATGCAGTCAG-3′, which added the codons for three additional residues, methionine, alanine, and threonine, at the N terminus. The M13/pUC reverse sequencing primer (New England Biolabs) was used as the reverse primer. The PCR fragment was restricted with Hin dIII and ligated into SmaI- and Hin dIII-restricted pGEM-4Z. The fidelity of the PCR was checked by DNA sequencing. Unless otherwise indicated, JS7131 was grown overnight in LB medium with 0.2% arabinose. After washing with fresh LB twice, the overnight culture was 1:50 back-diluted into 1 ml of LB with either 0.2% glucose to deplete YidC or 0.2% arabinose to express YidC. For JS7131 bearing the pACYC-H1Alb3, the overnight culture was cultivated in the absence of arabinose and directly 1:50 back-diluted into 1 ml of LB with 0.2% glucose to suppress the expression of YidC. The cultures were grown at 37 °C for about 3 h until a significant growth defect was observed between the glucose and the arabinose culture. Then the cells were transferred to M9 medium containing either 0.2% glucose or 0.2% arabinose, and the cultures were grown for an additional 30 min. At this point, the cells were ready for radiolabeling, protease-mapping, and signal peptide processing analysis (see below). To test the Alb3 requirement for membrane protein insertion, the membrane protein of interest was induced for 5–10 min by the addition of IPTG (1 mm, final concentration) to JS7131 cells prepared as above and labeled with trans-[35S]methionine for 20 s. The sample was chilled on ice immediately, and the cells were collected by centrifugation. The cell pellet was subsequently resuspended in 0.5 ml of ice-cold sphero-buffer (40% sucrose, 33 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0) and treated with lysozyme (10 μg/ml final concentration) for 15 min. Then the sample was split, and proteinase K was added to one aliquot. After 1 h of incubation on ice, 0.5 ml of chilled 20% trichloroacetic acid was added to each aliquot. The trichloroacetic acid-precipitated proteins were then analyzed by immunoprecipitation and SDS-PAGE (38Ito K. Date T. Wickner W. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 2123-2130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and by phosphorimaging. Signal peptide cleavage was also used to monitor membrane insertion of proteins. Procoat synthesis was induced for 5 min in the JS7131 strain bearing pMS119-procoat, which was grown as described above, by the addition of 1 mm IPTG and subsequently labeled with trans-[35S]methionine for 20 s. The radiolabeled sample was directly added to ice-cold trichloroacetic acid. The trichloroacetic acid-precipitated proteins were then subjected to immunoprecipitation and analyzed by urea-SDS-PAGE and phosphorimaging. Samples were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis using a 15% polyacrylamide gel except for procoat samples, which were analyzed using a 22% Urea-SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Radiolabeled proteins were visualized either by phosphorimaging or by fluorography. YidC and H1Alb3 proteins were detected by immunoblotting assay using the ECL Western blotting detection kit (AmershamBiosciences). Precursor proteins were synthesized from capped RNA using a wheat germ system in the presence of [35S]methionine as described (39Cline K. Henry R., Li, C. Yuan J. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4105-4114Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Translation products were diluted 3-fold and adjusted to import buffer (IB; 50 mm Hepes/KOH, pH 8.0, 0.33 msorbitol) containing 30 mm unlabeled methionine. Chloroplast were isolated from 9–10-day-old pea seedlings (Laxton's Progress). Chloroplast lysates, thylakoids, and stromal extracts (S.E.) were prepared as described (35Henry R. Carrigan M. McCaffrey M., Ma, X. Cline K. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 823-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 39Cline K. Henry R., Li, C. Yuan J. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4105-4114Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Chlorophyll content was determined according to Arnon (40Arnon D.I.C. Plant Physiol. 1949; 24: 1-15Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Standard transport assays included 50 μl of 2× thylakoids (1 mg/ml chlorophyll) in IB/10 mm MgCl2 (IBM), 50 μl of 2× S.E. (equivalent to that obtained from 2× chloroplasts), 5 mm ATP, 1 mm GTP, and 25 μl of diluted radiolabeled precursor protein. IB was added to make the final volume 150 μl. After incubation at 25 °C for 30 min, the thylakoid membranes were pelleted (3200 × g for 8 min) and resuspended in 500 μl of IB. The amount of inserted protein was assayed by adding 25 μl of thermolysin (2 mg/ml in IB/10 mm CaCl2) and incubating 40 min on ice. Thermolysin treatment was terminated by addition of 100 μl of IB/50 mm EDTA. Samples containing in vitro translated cpSecE were acetone-precipitated (41Henry R. Kapazoglou A. McCaffery M. Cline K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10189-10192Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and resuspended in 45 μl of solubilization buffer. Otherwise, pelleted membranes were resuspended in 20 μl of 10 mm EDTA and 25 μl of 2× solubilization buffer. After incubation at 70 °C for 15 min, proteins contained in 10 μl of each sample were separated by SDS-PAGE except for samples from cpSecE integration assays, which were separated by Tricine SDS-PAGE (42Schagger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10460) Google Scholar). Gels were dried and used to quantitate the level of protein transport from phosphorimages (Molecular Dynamics Typhoon). Antibodies against Alb3, cpSecY, and Tha4 were tested for their ability to inhibit insertion into thylakoids as described in (30Moore M. Harrison M.S. Peterson E.C. Henry R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1529-1532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Overexpressed SecE and Alb3 are from Arabidopsis. After incubation with isolated thylakoids for 1 h, the unbound antibody was removed by washing the thylakoids in IBM, and standard transport assays were conducted, except that S.E. was included at twice the standard concentration. Standard transport assays lacking additional ATP were used to test energetic requirements of precursor transport. IB was substituted for S.E. as indicated in the legend to Fig. 6 to examine the requirement for soluble factors (35Henry R. Carrigan M. McCaffrey M., Ma, X. Cline K. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 823-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The non-hydrolyzable ATP and GTP analogs, AMP-PNP and GMP-PNP, were inspected for their effect on insertion by addition to 5 mm final concentration. The requirement for a ΔpH was tested by including the proton ionophore nigericin (Fluka, 1 μm final concentration in ethanol) as described (43Cline K. Ettinger W.F. Theg S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2688-2696Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Control reactions contained ethanol without nigericin. Thylakoids (0.18 μg/ml chlorophyll) were treated with thermolysin (180 μg/ml + 0.9 mm CaCl2) for 40 min on ice followed by the addition of EDTA as above to stop the reaction. Thylakoids were repurified over 7.5% Percoll cushions in IB/10 mm EDTA and prepared for import assays by washing two times in IB/10 mmEDTA and once in IB. The membranes were then resuspended in IBM containing 1 mm dithiothreitol and used in standard transport assays. Mock protease-treated thylakoids were used in control assays. To test whether the chloroplast Alb3 is a functional homolog of the E. coli YidC, we investigated whether Alb3 could complement the YidC depletion strain, JS7131. The YidC depletion strain, which is arabinose-dependent for growth, has an arabinose-inducible yidC gene permanently integrated at the attB locus of MC1060 and contains an in-frame deletion at the normal yidC locus. Complementation was assayed by testing whether Alb3 can restore growth of JS7131 on LB agar plates containing glucose. The A. thaliana Alb3 is predicted to contain only five transmembrane segments (44Sundberg E. Slagter J.G. Fridborg I. Cleary S.P. Robinson C. Coupland G. Plant Cell. 1997; 9: 717-730PubMed Google Scholar) (see Fig. 1 A) while E. coliYidC has six transmembrane segments with an N-terminal signal anchor domain (45Saaf A. Monne M. de Gier J.W. von Heijne G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30415-30418Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Alb3 lacks most of the N-terminal-translocated domain including the first transmembrane segment found in YidC. In our complementation studies, we made three specific Alb3 constructs. The first construct, Alb3, is the full-length Alb3 (amino acids 1–462), including the stroma-targeting peptide. The second construct, mAlb3, lacked the stroma-targeting peptide (amino acids 1–55). The third, H1Alb3, consisted of the first 57 amino acids of YidC joined to residues 59–462 of Alb3. The YidC portion contains transmembrane segment one that functions as an uncleaved signal sequence. These pACYC184 constructs were introduced into the YidC depletion strain JS7131. JS-H1Alb3 grew under YidC-depleted conditions (0.2% glucose), while JS-Alb3 and JS-mAlb3 did not (Fig. 1 C), showing that H1Alb3 complements the growth defect of YidC-depleted bacteria. No complementation was observed for the wild-type Alb3 either with or without the chloroplast stroma-targeting signal. We next confirmed that JS7131 expressing H1Alb3 does not express YidC when grown in glucose. Immunoblot analysis using YidC antiserum revealed that there was no detectable YidC in JS7131 expressing H1Alb3 that was grown in glucose (Fig. 2 A). The top band shown in Fig. 2 A is a nonspecific band that is precipitated by our YidC antiserum. As a control, we confirmed that JS7131 only synthesizes YidC in the presence of arabinose (left lane) but not in glucose (middle lane). Western blotting analysis using Alb3 antiserum was performed to detect the presence of Alb3. Fig. 2 B shows that H1Alb3 is produced in glucose-grown JS7131 when expression is controlled by both the yidC promoter (lane 1) and the tac promoter (lane 4). There is some degradation of H1Alb3 (* depicts the degradation products) that can be seen when this protein is overproduced (lane 4), possibly because it cannot insert and assemble efficiently under overproducing conditions. The wild-type Alb3 (mAlb3) and Alb3 containing the targeting signal (Alb3) are not expressed in detectable amounts in JS7131 either with the yidC or tac promoter (Fig. 2 B). Because the H1Alb3 mutant was functional, but not Alb3, we asked if there was a functional requirement for the N-terminal 57 amino acids of YidC. One possibility was that the YidC region was required because it contained a hydrophobic domain that helped in the membrane translocation of the Alb3 or YidC N-terminal lumenal domain. Therefore, we tested whether the first 57 amino acids of the precursor to the maltose-binding protein containing a cleavable signal sequence could replace the first 57 amino acids within YidC or H1Alb3. Fig. 3 A shows that MBP-YidC is functional as this construct complements the growth defect of the YidC depletion strain. Immunoblot analysis shows that MBP-YidC is expressed and slightly smaller than the wild-type YidC, due most likely to cleavage of the preMBP presequence by signal peptidase (Fig. 3 B). This shows conclusively that the first 57 amino acids of YidC do not have a functional requirement. Notably, the construct MBP-Alb3 does not restore growth to the YidC depletion strain (Fig. 3 A), most likely because the protein is not expressed as it is not detected on an immunoblot (data not shown). Because the E. coli YidC is essential for efficient membrane insertion of the Sec-independent M13 procoat protein and the Sec-dependent leader peptidase (Lep) (20Samuelson J.C. Chen M. Jiang F. Moller I. Wiedmann M. Kuhn A. Phillips G.J. Dalbey R.E. Nature. 2000; 406: 637-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar), we first tested whether H1Alb3 is required for insertion of these two proteins when YidC is depleted. Cells expressing procoat were pulse-labeled with trans-[35S]methionine for 20 s and chased for 5 and 120 s. Signal peptide processing of procoat is completely normal when H1Alb3 is expressed (Fig. 4 A). As a control, we confirmed that processing is completely blocked when JS7131 grown in glucose (YidC-depleted cells) in the absence of H1Alb3, but is efficient when grown in arabinose (ample YidC). In addition, H1Alb3 promotes membrane insertion of Lep (Fig. 4 B). Cells expressing Lep were pulse-labeled with trans-[35S]methionine for 20 s and analyzed for protease accessibility. Cells were converted to spheroplasts and then treated with or without protease. When JS7131 is expressing H1Alb3, Lep is completely accessible to protease, indicating that the large C-terminal domain of Lep is translocated across the membrane. In the same spheroplasts, there was no lysis as Band X (46Cristobal S. Scotti P. Luirink J. von Heijne G. de Gier J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20068-20070Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), an unidentified cytoplasmic protein, was protected from protease digestion. The efficiency of Lep insertion was just as efficient as when YidC was present (arabinose-grown cells). Translocation of the C-terminal domain of Lep was impaired in YidC-deficient JS7131 cells (glucose-grown cells, Fig. 4 B) as previously reported (20Samuelson J.C. Chen M. Jiang F. Moller I. Wiedmann M. Kuhn A. Phillips G.J. Dalbey R.E. Nature. 2000; 406: 637-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). In this study where Lep was examined, the overnight culture was grown in LB medium containing both arabinose and glucose. The glucose was added to the overnight culture as it suppresses the expression of YidC, allowing a more effective depletion of YidC in the subsequent growing of JS7131 cells in glucose medium. The complementation and insertion data above directly links the role of Oxa1p homologs in the translocation pathways in bacteria and in the plant chloroplast. To test this idea further, we tested whether H1Alb3 can function to insert a chloroplast thylakoid membrane protein into the E. coli inner membrane. Because the chloroplast SecE has been shown to functionally substitute for SecE in E. coli (36Froderberg L. Rohl T. van Wijk K.J. de Gier J.W. FEBS Lett. 2001; 498: 52-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) we tested whether this protein would require Alb3 for insertion. In this study, we used cpSecE, which lacks the chloroplast stroma-targeting signal. This protein spans the thylakoid membrane once with a short C-terminal tail in the lumenal space. H1Alb3 and cpSecE-containing cells were pulse-labeled for 20 s, converted to spheroplasts, and protease-mapped. As can be seen in Fig. 5 A, cpSecE was efficiently degraded by protease, indicating it inserted across the membrane when H1Alb3 was present. Likewise, cpSecE was inserted, although to a lesser extent, when JS7131 was grown in the presence of YidC (arabinose). No detectable cpSecE was inserted into the membrane when YidC was absent (glucose). Given that H1Alb3 promoted efficient insertion of the cpSecE, we tested whether the chloroplast LHCP, which requires Alb3 for membrane insertion (30Moore M. Harrison M.S. Peterson E.C. Henry R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1529-1532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar), would insert into the E. coli inner membrane. Previously, it had been shown that overexpression of LHCP in E. coli lead to its accumulation in inclusion bodies (47Kohorn B.D. Auchincloss A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12048-12052Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we tested whether the accumulation may have arisen because insertion was blocked due to the protein not being able to utilize YidC. H1Alb3-containing cells may then allow efficient"

Xenobiotics from the environment can cause damage to DNA that may lead to mutations following replication past these lesions. DNA damage can arise from both endogenous metabolic end-products of cellular respiration, as well as from hazardous industrial chemicals. Numerous compounds have been investigated for their ability to form DNA adducts and their mutagenic potential during replication in prokaryotic and eukaryotic systems (1Marnett L.J.

One such compound that has recently become the target for evaluation is acrolein (CH2=CHCHO), an α,β-unsaturated aldehyde that is released into the environment (140 tons/year) via a number of sources (5Marnett L.J.

Acrolein is also formed endogenously during metabolic oxidation of polyamines, lipid peroxidation, and cyclophosphamide metabolism (8Lee Y. Sayre L.M. J. Biol.

Hollstein M.C. Levin D.E. Esterbauer H. Ames B.N. Mutat.

Mutat. Res. 1988; 209: 17-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). It also has been demonstrated to have tumor initiating activity (13Cohen S.M. Garland E.M., St. John M. Okamura T. Smith R.A. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 3577-3581PubMed Google Scholar). Molecular analysis of mutations induced by acrolein in human fibroblasts and xeroderma pigmentosum cells has been performed using a supF shuttle vector. These studies revealed that in both types of cells, the majority of the mutations were single and tandem base substitutions that predominantly occurred in G:C base pairs (14Kawanishi M. Matsuda T. Nakayama A. Takebe H. Matsui S. Yagi T. Mutat. Res. 1998; 417: 65-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Being a bifunctional electrophile, acrolein reacts with DNA bases in vitro to form several exocyclic DNA adducts (15Singer B. Bartsch H. Exocyclic DNA Adducts in Mutagenesis and Carcinogenesis, IARC Scientific Publications No. 150.

Young R. Hecht S.S. Cancer Res. 1984; 44: 990-995PubMed Google Scholar). This adduct is formed by conjugate addition of the acrolein to N2 of dG followed by ring closure of the resulting N 2-(3-oxopropyl)dG at N-1 to form the cyclic adduct. The acyclic and cyclic adducts are in dynamic equilibrium. At physiological pH, the acyclic species cannot be detected spectrophotometrically. However, it can be trapped as the N 2-(3-hydroxypropyl) adduct by treatment with NaBH4. Using 32P-postlabeling combined with high performance liquid chromatography, evidence has been obtained for the presence of the γ-HOPdG adduct in liver cells of humans and rodents (17Nath R.G.

However, the relative mutagenicity of this lesion when replicated in Escherichia coli has varied greatly, with Burcham and Marnett (23Burcham P.C. Marnett L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28844-28850Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) reporting a 2% mutagenesis of G to T and A, while Moriya et al. (22Moriya M. Zhang W. Johnson F. Grollman A.P. Proc. Natl.

It is probable that these mutagenic variations could be accounted for by differences in the vectors used, with one study (22Moriya M. Zhang W. Johnson F. Grollman A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

An oligodeoxynucleotide containing a single γ-HOPdG adduct was incorporated into heteroduplex DNA (29Yang I.-Y. Hossain M. Miller H. Khullar S. Johnson F. Grollman A. Moriya M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9071-9076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) and its cellular processing as well as mutagenic potential were examined in E. coli using wild type and repair-deficient strains. Analyses of progeny plasmids revealed that γ-HOPdG was not mutagenic in vivo and that accurate translesion synthesis, nucleotide excision repair, and recombination repair protect E. coli from the genotoxicity of the adduct. Inactivation of polB, dinB, and umuD,C genes did not affect significantly the efficiency or fidelity of translesion synthesis suggesting that “SOS” polymerases were not essential for replication across γ-HOPdG. Another study (30VanderVeen L.A. Hashim M.F. Nechev L.V. Harris T.M. Harris C.M. Marnett L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9066-9070Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) using the same adduct in single stranded as well as double stranded shuttle vectors, also showed that γ-HOPdG was not a strong block to DNA replication and was not a miscoding lesion in E. coli. In vitro, the Klenow exo− fragment of E. coli polymerase I exhibited a limited, mostly error-prone DNA synthesis across γ-HOPdG (29Yang I.-Y. Hossain M. Miller H. Khullar S. Johnson F. Grollman A.

Therefore, it has been concluded that DNA polymerase III, the major replicative DNA polymerase in E. coli, catalyzes error-free translesion synthesis across γ-HOPdG (29Yang I.-Y. Hossain M. Miller H. Khullar S. Johnson F. Grollman A. Moriya M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9071-9076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). NMR spectroscopy of a DNA duplex containing the γ-HOPdG adduct (28de los Santos C. Zaliznyak Y. Johnson F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9077-9082Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) established that there is a fundamental difference between γ-HOPdG and PdG within duplex DNA, in that the former predominantly exists as an open ring form (Fig. 1), enabling the modified base to participate in a standard Watson-Crick base pairing. The chemical conversion of the γ-HOPdG to N 2-(3-oxopropyl)dG during replication has been proposed to account for the lack of mutagenicity of the γ-HOPdG adduct as observed in biological studies (29Yang I.-Y.

In the present study, accuracy of translesion DNA synthesis across the γ-HOPdG adduct has been evaluated in vivo in both mammalian (COS-7) and bacterial (repair deficient E. coliAB2480 (uvrA − recA −)) cells using a site-specifically modified single stranded pMS2 shuttle vector (31Moriya M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1122-1126Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). To further explore the mechanism of replication bypass and to identify the polymerases involved in both error free and error-prone synthesis, in vitro replication assays were carried out with two major mammalian DNA polymerases, pol δ and pol ε (32Stucki M. Stagljar I. Jonsson O. Hubscher U. Prog. Nucleic Acids. Res. Mol. Biol. 2001; 65: 261-298Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). T4 DNA ligase, T4 polynucleotide kinase, and EcoRV were obtained from New England BioLabs (Beverly, MA). S1 nuclease and proteinase K were purchased from Invitrogen (Rockville, MD). Calf thymus DNA polymerase δ and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) were generous gifts from Dr. K. M. Downey (University of Miami, Miami, FL) and were isolated according to the published procedures (33Lee M.Y. Tan C.-K. Downey K.M. So A.G.

Linn (University of California, Berkeley, CA) and was purified as described (35Syvaöja J. Suomensaari S. Nishida C. Goldsmith J.S. Chui G.S. Jain S. Linn S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6664-6668Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). [γ32P]Ribo-ATP was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Science (Boston, MA). Bio-Spin columns were purchased from Bio-Rad (Hercules, CA). Centricon 100 concentrators were obtained from Amicon Inc. (Beverly, MA). Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, fetal bovine serum, Opti-MEM (reduced serum medium),l-glutamine, antibiotic-antimycotic, and Lipofectin reagent for tissue culture were obtained from Invitrogen (Rockville, MD). Trypsin-EDTA and HEPES buffer were purchased from Cellgro Mediatech, VA. Phosphate-buffered saline was from Sigma. γ-HOPdG (Fig. 1) was inserted into a 12-mer oligonucleotide sequence (5′-GCTAGC(γ-HOPdG)AGTCC-3′) and purity determined by a 20% denaturing polyacrylamide gel, by previously described procedures (27Nechev L.V. Harris C.M. Harris T.M. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 2000; 13: 421-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Nondamaged 12-mer with a dG in place of γ-HOPdG was purchased from Midland Certified Reagent Co. (Midland, TX). All other oligodeoxynucleotides were synthesized by the Molecular Biology Core Laboratory of the NIEHS Toxicology Center at the University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston, TX, and purified by electrophoresis through a 15% denaturing PAGE (in the presence of 7m urea). Single stranded (ss) pMS2 DNA was a generous gift from Dr. M. Moriya (State University of New York, Stony Brook, NY). COS-7 cells were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD). E. coli DH10B cells that were used for transformation of DNA isolated from COS-7 cells after transfection with modified and control DNA, and helper phage M13KO7 were purchased from Invitrogen (Rockville, MD). Repair-deficient E. coli AB2480 (uvrA − recA −) was used for propagating the pMS2 shuttle vector during isolation of ss DNA by helper phage rescue using M13 KO7 (1011 pfu/ml). Purity of ss pMS2 was assayed by electrophoresis through a 1.4% agarose gel and compared with standard ss pMS2 DNA as supplied by Dr. M. Moriya. ss pMS2 (29 pmol, 50 μg) was annealed to a 58-mer scaffold (145 pmol/2.34 μg) in the presence of a buffer (NEB#3) containing 100 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin (BSA), in 200 μl of reaction mixture, and incubated at 9 °C overnight. The hairpin loop in the ss pMS2 DNA that contains a single EcoRV restriction site (Fig. 2), was digested with 40 units of EcoRV in the presence of NEB#3 and BSA in a 600-μl reaction mixture, by incubation at 37 °C for 3 h. Non-annealed 58-mer scaffold and the excised hairpin loop were removed from the reaction by centrifugation in a Centricon-100 tube. The 58-mer scaffold was complementary to the two termini of the digested vector (after removal of the hairpin loop), and the central sequence was complementary to the 12-mer oligonucleotide bearing the γ-HOPdG adduct, except there was complete substitution of uracil for thymine (Fig. 2). The gap created by annealing of ss pMS2 DNA to the scaffold was filled by ligation with a 10-fold excess of the γ-HOPdG containing oligonucleotide, or the unmodified 12-mer as control. The 12-mer oligodeoxynucleotides were phosphorylated at the 5′ end with ribo-ATP and ligated in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mmdithiothreitol, 10 mm ATP, 25 μg/ml BSA, using T4 polynucleotide kinase (5 units/pmol) and T4 ligase (325 units/pmol), in the reaction mixture of 200 μl, at 4 °C for 48 h. The two ligated samples were designated ss pMS2(dG) and ss pMS2(γ-HOPdG). Ligation products were visualized by ethidium bromide staining, following electrophoresis through a 1.4% agarose gel and compared with standard circular and linearized ss pMS2 DNA. Modified samples were purified to remove non-ligated 12-mer in Centricon-100 tubes after dilution to 600 μl. After repeating this step three times, DNA was recovered by ethanol precipitation and the DNA concentration determined by measuring absorbance at 260 nm. To avoid the 58-mer scaffold being used as a primer for (−)-strand replication, ligated DNAs were incubated with uracil-DNA glycosylase for 1 h to remove uracil bases and generate abasic sites. Modified DNAs were allowed to replicate in COS-7 cells and DNA was isolated for transforming E. coli DH10B cells to assess mutations which might have arisen during replication in COS-7 cells. For transfection of ligated DNAs, COS-7 cells (5 × 105 cells per 6-cm Petri dish) were first maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml), incubated for 24 h at 5% CO2. Individually, 30 μg of Lipofectin and 200 ng of ligation mixture were dissolved in 1.5 ml of Opti-MEM, combined, and incubated for 15 min at room temperature. A total of 3 ml of this solution was added to each 6-cm Petri plate containing the attached COS-7 cells and incubated for 18 h at 37 °C. Transfection medium was replaced with 5 ml of fresh Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and cultured for 48 h. Cells were then washed twice with 5 ml of phosphate-buffered saline, and progeny phagemid DNA was recovered by the method described by Hirt (36Hirt B. J. Mol. Biol. 1967; 26: 365-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (3352) Google Scholar). DNA extracted from COS-7 cells was successively treated with S1 nuclease (0.2 units/60 μl reaction mixture) and EcoRV (20 units/60 μl reaction mixture) to remove any input ssDNA and progeny associated with the original ss pMS2 vector and then replicated in E. coliDH10B. A total of 50 μl of electrocompetent DH10B cells was transformed with 5 μg of DNA by electroporation in chilled 2-mm gap cuvettes using ECM 600 (BTX, San Diego), at 25 μF, 2.5 kV, R5 (resistance timing) 129 ohms. 2 × Yeast-tryptone (YT) (0.95 ml) was immediately added and incubated with shaking at 37 °C for 1 h to fully express the ampicillin-resistant gene. Aliquots of the transformation mixture were plated out onto 1 × YT agar plates containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin. After incubation overnight at 37 °C, the number of transformants per plate was counted to determine replication efficiency. In addition, 5 μg of undamaged and damaged, modified ss pMS2 DNA were added to 40 μl of competent cells of E. coli AB2480 (uvrA − recA −) by electroporation under similar conditions as described above and allowed to replicate on LB-ampicillin plates overnight, for comparison of mutagenicity in mammalian and bacterial cells. A total of 480 colonies from each plate of transformed cells were individually picked with sterile toothpicks and grown in 2 × YT containing ampicillin in 96-well plates overnight. The cultures from each 96-well plate were transferred using 48-pin replicators, onto Whatman 541 filter papers placed on ampicillin containing 1 × YT agar plates, in four replicates (one for each probe: 5′-GATGCTAGCN AGTCCATC-3′, where N refers to A, T, G, or C), and incubated overnight at 37 °C to form well defined colonies. Alternately, colony lifts were performed on four replicate plates of transformants to determine the actual mutation frequency of the entire population. Filter papers were removed from the agar plates, cell lysis achieved by soaking in 0.5 n NaOH for 5 min followed by neutralization in 0.5 m Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) and washed in 1 × SSC (0.15 m NaCl, 0.15m sodium citrate/C6H5O7Na3, pH 7.0). DNA was cross-linked onto the paper in a UV Stratalinker for 1.5 min. Hybridization was carried out with [γ-32P]ATP-labeled probes, designed to determine the nature of the base at the site of the adducted guanine in progeny plasmid DNA. Hybridization temperature was calculated using the formula where the oligonucleotide melting temperature equals (4(G+C) + 2(A+T)) −14 °C. Filters were incubated in prehybridization solution containing 25 ml of 20 × SSPE (3m NaCl, 2 mm Na2HPO4, 2 mm EDTA), 20 ml of formamide, 5 ml of Denhardt's solution (1% Ficoll, 1% polyvinylpyrrolidone, 1% BSA), 1 ml of 10 mg/ml fish milt DNA and 1 ml of 10% SDS, for 20 min to restrict nonspecific binding of the probe. Four filters were separated and probed with 100 pmol each of four 18-mer oligodeoxynucleotides containing one of the four canonical bases at the adducted site within the centrally located sequence of the damaged and non-damaged 12-mer oligonucleotide. After overnight hybridization with probes in hybridization solution, filters were washed with 2 × SSPE at 2 °C above hybridization temperature to remove nonspecifically bound probes. Dried filters were exposed to X-Omat AR film overnight and autoradiographs were developed to identify mutation frequency and types of mutations. Representative colonies were subjected to dideoxy sequencing (37Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52769) Google Scholar) to confirm the sequence of the mutated DNAs. A 20-mer primer (5′-CCATCTTGTTCAATCATGCG-3′) was used for sequencing progeny plasmid DNA. The γ-HOPdG 12-mer oligodeoxynucleotide utilized in the construction of the pMS2 vector, as well as its nondamaged analog, were used to construct 135-mer linear templates. Nondamaged or γ-HOPdG containing 12-mer oligodeoxynucleotide, the 62-mer 5′-flanking DNA, and the 61-mer 3′-flanking DNA (500 pmol of each) were annealed to an equimolar amount of the 42-mer scaffold DNA. Prior to annealing, the 12- and 61-mer oligodeoxynucleotides were 5′-phosphorylated using ribo-ATP (non-labeled) and T4 polynucleotide kinase. To visualize the ligation products, 1/100 of the 12-mer oligodeoxynucleotides were phosphorylated with [γ-32P]ribo-ATP. Ligations were performed with 400 units of the T4 DNA ligase in the reaction volume of 100 μl at 13 °C for 20 h. Ligation products were separated by electrophoresis on a 10% denaturing PAGE. The 135-mer bands were excised, DNAs were eluted with buffer consisting of 500 mmammonium acetate, 10 mm magnesium acetate, and 1 mm EDTA and precipitated with ethanol. The sequence of resulting oligodeoxynucleotides were identical: 5′-GGGACCTGAACACGTACGGAATTCGATATCCTCGAGCCAGATCTGCGCCAGCTGGCCACCCTGCTAGC G AGTCCGCGCCAAGCTTGGGCTGCAGCAGGTCGACTCTAGAGGATCCCGGGCGAGCTCGAATTCGCC-3′, where the underlined G is either γ-HOPdG or non-adducted. 21-Mer oligodeoxynucleotides were used as primers for in vitro polymerase reactions, using the following sequences: 5′-CCTGCTGCAGCCCAAGCTTGG-3′, which is complementary to the template DNA from positions −9 to −29 relative to the site of lesion (−9 primer), 5′-AGCCCAAGCTTGGCGCGGACT-3′, (−1 primer), and 5′-TGGCGCGGACTCGCTAGCAGG-3′, which is complementary to the template DNA from positions +9 to −11 overlapping the lesion site (+9 primer). Primer oligodeoxynucleotides were phosphorylated with T4 polynucleotide kinase using [γ-32P]ribo-ATP. The γ-32P-labeled primers were mixed with the oligodeoxynucleotide substrates at a molar ratio of 1:2 in the presence of 50 mm KCl, heated at 90 °C for 2 min, and cooled to room temperature overnight. DNA samples were purified using P-6 Bio-Spin columns supplied with 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.4). To confirm the completion of primer annealing, aliquots were tested on a 5% native PAGE, which was also used for verification of DNA concentrations. Assays with polymerase δ and polymerase ε were carried out as described (33Lee M.Y. Tan C.-K. Downey K.M. So A.G. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 1906-1913Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 38Chui G. Linn S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7799-7808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The polymerase δ reaction mixture contained 2 nm primer annealed to a template in 40 mmHEPES-KOH (pH 6.8), 10% glycerol, 200 μg/ml BSA, 6 mmMgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 70 ng of calf thymus PCNA where indicated, polymerase δ, and dNTPs (each of the four dNTPs or individually) at the concentrations as given in the figure legends. Reactions were incubated for 10 min at 37 °C in a final volume of 5 μl. The pol ε reaction mixture contained 2 nm primer/template DNA, 50 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.5), 100 mm potassium glutamate, 20% glycerol, 200 μg/ml BSA, 15 mm MgCl2, 10 mmDDT, 0.03% Triton X-100, 100 μm each of the dNTPs, and 2.5 milliunits of polymerase ε (where 1 unit of polymerase is defined as the amount that catalyzes the incorporation of 1 nmol of dTTP into an acid-insoluble form per h using dA3000 and oligo(dT)12–18). Reactions were incubated for 20 min at 37 °C in a final volume of 12.5 μl. Incubation of the primer/template DNA substrates under the same reaction conditions without polymerase was used as a negative control reaction. Reactions were terminated by the addition of 2 × of stop solution consisting of 95% (v/v) formamide, 20 mm EDTA, 0.02% (w/v) xylene cyanol, and 0.02% (w/v) bromphenol blue. Reaction products were resolved on a 15% denaturing PAGE and visualized by autoradiography. Quantitative analyses was performed using a PhosphorImager screen and Image-Quant 5.0 software (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). Single stranded pMS2 DNA which was purified as described under “Experimental Procedures,” was annealed with a partially complementary scaffold DNA and digested with EcoRV (Fig. 2, step 1). The EcoRV restriction site spontaneously forms within a hairpin in the ss pMS2 and completion of linearization was tested by differential electrophoretic mobility through a 1.4% agarose gel. Into the resulting gap (Fig. 2, step 2), control unmodified and γ-HOPdG modified 12-mer oligodeoxynucleotides were ligated (Fig. 2, step 3). Efficiencies of ligation were assessed by electrophoretic analyses of the conversion of linear to circular DNA"
https://openalex.org/W2010955593,"Aging is known to alter many physiological processes within the brain including synaptic responses, long-term potentiation, learning, and memory. Aging has also been shown to alter the expression and distribution ofN-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptors in many different brain regions, including the hippocampus. Additionally, we have recently reported that young adult rats show an activity-dependent increase in the surface expression of NMDA receptors. We have extended these observations in the present study in aged animals and have found that aged Fischer 344 rats fail to show activity-dependent changes in the surface distribution of NMDA receptors. In conjunction with this observation we have also noted that aged rats show an expression deficit in the C2 splice variant of the NR1 subunit. This subunit is preferentially shifted to the surface following stimulation in young adult animals. As the NMDA receptor is thought to play an important role in neuronal signaling, these observations suggest possible new areas of dysfunction in this receptor that might underlie age-related deficits in neuronal physiology.

This occurs in response to glutamate and concomitant depolarization, thus allowing the NMDA receptor to function as a “coincidence detector.” This capability has led some to suggest that the NMDA receptor could be involved in “Hebbian” synaptic plasticity.

Brain Res. 2000; 885: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) have noted that as part of the aging process, a specific decrease in the expression and function of the NMDA receptor occurs in multiple areas of the brain. Moreover, we have recently demonstrated a correlation between the amount of NR2B subunit of the NMDA receptor in the hippocampus and spatial learning task performance in aged rats (15.Clayton, D. A. M. M., Alvarez, E., Bickford, P. C., Browning, M. D. (2002) J. Neurosci., in pressGoogle Scholar).

We have recently reported that LTP stimulation produces a redistribution of NMDA receptors from an intracellular pool to the surface of hippocampal neurons from young adult rats (16.Grosshans D.R. Clayton D.A. Coultrap S.J. Browning M.D. Nat. Neurosci. 2001; 5: 27-33Crossref Scopus (303) Google Scholar). To extend these studies, we have examined the effect of LTP stimulation upon the surface distribution of NMDA receptors in Fischer 344 rats at 4, 16, and 24 months to examine the effect of aging upon this activity-dependent redistribution of receptor. Additionally, in young adult rats, there is a preferential redistribution of the C2 cassette-containing NR1 splice variant subunits to the surface. We therefore also examined the expression of NR1 splice variants in aged animals. Fisher 344 rats were obtained from the National Institute of Aging breeding colony at Harlan Sprague-Dawley at 6, 16, and 24 months of age. After sacrifice the brains were removed and the hippocampi dissected out. 400-μm slices were prepared on a McIlwain tissue slicer and allowed to recover at 32 °C in a perfusion chamber containing ACSF (124 mm NaCl, 4 mm KCl, 1 mm MgSO4, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 10 mm dextrose, 1 mm KH2PO4, 25.7 mmNaHCO3) at a rate of 4 ml/min for 90 min. For surface expression experiments, CA1 mini-slices were prepared directly from isolated CA1 as described previously (16.Grosshans D.R. Clayton D.A. Coultrap S.J. Browning M.D. Nat. Neurosci. 2001; 5: 27-33Crossref Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Tissue samples for protein expression were sonicated into Tris-buffered SDS (10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 2 mm EDTA, 1% SDS). Protein concentrations were determined using a modified BCA assay (Pierce). Samples were loaded onto 7.5% SDS-PAGE along with a five-point standard curve for comparative analysis. Whole rat brain homogenate was used as the standard with aliquots from the same batch freshly prepared before each set of gels was run. Gels were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane using a submarine transfer apparatus (Owl Scientific). Following transfer, blots were dried and blocked with 5% milk or 3% BSA in TTBS (10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20). Primary antibody was applied for 16 h at 4 C in 1% milk or 1% BSA in TTBS. Secondary antibody was applied for 2 h at 25° in 1% milk or 1% BSA in TTBS. Gels were developed using SuperSignal (Pierce) and were imaged and analyzed using an Alpha Imager (Alpha Innotech). Quantitation was performed using Excel (Microsoft), and statistics were performed using StatView (SAS Institute). Antibodies to NR2A, NR2B, the NR1 splice variants (N-terminal cassette, C1 cassette, C2 cassette, C2′ alternate reading frame), and synapsin were produced in our laboratory and have been described previously (16.Grosshans D.R. Clayton D.A. Coultrap S.J. Browning M.D. Nat. Neurosci. 2001; 5: 27-33Crossref Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Antibodies were obtained commercially, NR1 from PharMingen and GluR2 from Chemicon. Field EPSPs were obtained by the usual protocols. In brief, the Schaeffer collateral pathway was stimulated using a bipolar nichrome electrode, and recordings were made from the dendritic layer of CA1 using a silver electrode contained in a finely drawn glass capillary tube containing ACSF. These field EPSPs were considered as representing mainly AMPA receptor responses. To obtain NMDA receptor responses, AMPA EPSPs were blocked by the administration of 2-μm NBQX. For electrophysiological studies, 1 train of 1-s 100-Hz stimulation was delivered at 50% of the maximal NMDA receptor response. For biochemical studies, LTP was induced in the slice using a multi-rake electrode, which we have described previously. In short, 16 rake electrodes were fixed to a rigid support in a 4 × 4 matrix arrangement allowing for the stimulation of 4 slices at 4 rake positions each (16 stimulation points/mini-slice). Columns of 4 rake electrodes on the same slice were oriented parallel to each other and separated by 500 μm. Adjacent columns were separated by 2.5 mm. LTP was induced by the sequential delivery of four 1-s trains of 100-Hz stimulation per rake electrode separated by 30 s. Rake positions were stimulated in turn across the slice so that only one rake/slice was stimulating at any given time. To assay basal and stimulation-dependent surface expression, we employed the membrane impermeable cross-linker, bis(sulfosuccinimidyl)suberate (BS3, Pierce) as described previously (16.Grosshans D.R. Clayton D.A. Coultrap S.J. Browning M.D. Nat. Neurosci. 2001; 5: 27-33Crossref Scopus (303) Google Scholar). For determination of basal surface expression values, slices were allowed to recover for a minimum of 90 min and transferred to either ACSF or ACSF containing 1 mg/ml BS3 for 45 min at 4 °C. To assay stimulation-dependent changes in surface expression, slices were harvested at 30 min post-LTP, and both stimulated and matched control slices were treated with cross-linker. A minimum of three slices per control or treatment groups was included for each animal. To terminate the reaction and quench remaining BS3, slices were washed three times in cold ACSF containing 20 mm Tris, pH 7.6. Surface expression was determined following semiquantitative Western blot analysis and a comparison of cross-linked samples to nontreated controls. We have previously reported that aging is associated with a selective decrease in the expression of the NR1 and NR2B subunits of the NMDA receptor with no change in the expression of the NR2A subunit of the NMDA receptor or in the expression of the GluR2 subunit of the AMPA receptor (10.Clayton D.A. Browning M.D. Neurobiol. Aging. 2001; 22: 165-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Other groups have found similar results, although age-related decreases in the expression of the NR2A subunit have also been reported (9.Sonntag W.E. Bennett S.A. Khan A.S. Thornton P.L. Xu X. Ingram R.L. Brunso-Bechtold J.K. Brain Res. Bull. 2000; 51: 331-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 11.Magnusson K.R. J.

In this report we have extended our previous studies by analyzing the surface expression of NMDA receptors in the CA1 region of the hippocampus across the life span of the Fischer 344 rat. We saw no significant differences in basal surface expression in any of the examined targets in rats at 6, 16, and 24 months of age (data not shown). Thus, in marked contrast to the expression of NMDA receptors in aged animals, which is down-regulated, the percentage of the receptor pool that is basally expressed at the surface remains relatively constant with age. We next sought to examine the effect of aging upon LTP-related changes in surface expression of glutamate receptors in Fischer 344 rats at 6, 16, and 24 months using a multiple “rake” stimulation device (Fig. 1). Surface expression changes following HFS were measured by cross-linking of both stimulated and nonstimulated matched control slices 30 min post-LTP. Samples were then used for semiquantitative Western blotting; as the cross-linker (BS3) is membrane-impermeable, only surface expressed molecules are cross-linked, rendering them unable to enter polyacrylamide gels. The internal pool of receptor, which is not cross-linked, is measured directly. Equal amounts of total protein are loaded, so that changes in surface expression with treatment are reflected in alterations in the levels of intracellular proteins. As previously described, LTP stimulation led to an increase in surface expression of NR2A, 2B, and NR1 in young adult animals (16 months). However, no LTP-related changes were seen in the surface expression of NR1, 2A, or 2B subunits in the 24-month group (Fig. 2). An intermediate effect was seen in the 16-month group. In this group, NR2A shows a trend toward an increase in surface expression with LTP (p = 0.11) (Fig. 2). NR2B was not significantly effected (p = 0.39), nor was NR1 (p = 0.52). There were no LTP-related effects on GluR2 in any age group (Fig. 2).Figure 2Surface expression changes with LTP. Surface expression was assayed with the use of a membrane-impermeable cross-linking agent (BS3), which only cross-links proteins on the surface of cells. The cross-linked product is unable to enter polyacrylamide gels, so that only the intracellular pool is resolved by Western blotting. Changes in surface expression are detected by observing changes in this directly detected intracellular pool. A, no significant changes were seen in the surface expression of NR1 (mean % change = 3.34 ± 7.26%), 2A (mean % change = 2.38 ± 6.94%), 2B (mean % change = −3.96 ± 7.61%), or GluR2 (mean % change = −7.26 ± 8.20%) in the 24-month group (n = 7, all pvalues > 0.9). In the 16-month group, NR2A shows a trend toward a significant change indicating an increase in surface expression with LTP (mean % change = 26.58 ± 6.86%, n = 7,p = 0.11). NR2B was not significantly effected (mean % change = 14.58 ± 16.64%, n = 7,p = 0.39) nor was NR1 (mean % change = 9.61 ± 6.02%, n = 7, p = 0.52) or GluR2 (p = 1). Six-month-old animals showed a significant increase in the surface expression of NR1 (mean % change = 24.37 ± 6.72%, n = 6, p < 0.05) and NR2A (mean % change = 21.23 ± 1.68%, n= 6, p < 0.05) and no change in the surface expression of NR2B (mean % change = 14.76 ± 9.31, n = 6, p = 0.34) or GluR2 (mean % change = 3.69 ± 7.28%, n = 6, p = 0.88). Statistical analyses were performed by ANOVA with Fisher's PLSD post-hoc test. B, representative immunoblots.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) As shown previously, the LTP-related increase in surface expression of the NMDA receptor is accompanied by an increase in the function of the NMDA receptor in the CA1 region of the hippocampus. We have replicated this result in young adult animals, as delivery of a single train of 100-Hz stimulation leads to a potentiation of NMDA receptor current of 28% (p < 0.05) (Fig. 3). In 16-month-old animals, stimulation results in a trend toward an increase in NMDA receptor-mediated current (20%, p = 0.14) (Fig. 3). However, in aged animals (24 months), no increase in NMDA receptor current is seen (Fig. 3). All NMDA receptor responses were blocked by the addition of APV (2-amino-5-phosphopentanoic acid). We have also shown that the increase in NR1 surface expression seen with activity in young adult rats is specific for the C2 cassette containing splice variants (16.Grosshans D.R. Clayton D.A. Coultrap S.J. Browning M.D. Nat. Neurosci. 2001; 5: 27-33Crossref Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Thus, as the NR1 subunit is not redistributed in aged animals, we sought to measure the total expression level of the NR1 subunit splice variants in aging. We find that there is a significant decrease in the total expression of the C2 splice variant in aged animals (Fig. 4). Interestingly, the total expression of subunits containing the N1, C1, and C2′ cassettes is not altered with age. NMDA receptor dysfunction in the hippocampus of aged animals has been demonstrated by multiple groups using a variety of techniques (5.Eckles-Smith K. Clayton D. Bickford P. Browning M.D. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 2000; 78: 154-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar,13.Barnes C.A. Rao G. Shen J. Neurobiol. Aging. 1997; 18: 445-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). We and others have also demonstrated age-related reductions in the expression of the NMDA receptor. In this report we extend those findings by examining the surface expression of the NMDA receptor subunits in the CA1 region of the hippocampus in 6-, 16-, and 24-month-old Fischer 344 rats. We have found that aging does not affect the basal surface expression of NMDA receptors. Although aged animals express less of the receptors, the percentage of total cellular receptor on the surface does not change. We have recently documented activity-dependent changes in the surface expression of NMDA receptors (16.Grosshans D.R. Clayton D.A. Coultrap S.J. Browning M.D. Nat. Neurosci. 2001; 5: 27-33Crossref Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Extending those findings, we find that aged animals are deficient in the ability to increase the quantity of NMDA receptor at the surface of the neuron in response to activity. Young animals show a significant increase in the amount of NR1 and NR2A subunits at the surface of the neuron (NR2B increases are seen but are not significant), which is not seen in aged animals. Similarly, aged animals fail to show an increase in NMDA receptor-mediated current post-LTP stimulation as is seen in young animals. These findings, in combination, are suggestive of a plasticity deficit in the function of aged neurons, whereby aged animals are unable to increase the amount of NMDA receptor at the surface in response to stimulation. If NMDA receptors are important for forming a “synaptic tag” for synapse formation or enlargement, as has been suggested previously, aged animals should be compromised in their ability to increase synaptic contacts in this fashion. Thus, this described defect in activity-dependent regulation may indicate a mechanism for decreased plasticity in aging mediated by a decrease in the formation or enlargement of synapses with activity. Cycling of receptors and other proteins into membranes occurs both constitutively and with activation of various signaling cascades. Our data suggest that constitutive cycling of NMDA and AMPA receptors is not altered with age. In contrast, activity-dependent cycling of NMDA receptors appears to be altered profoundly as a function of age. The mechanism of this selective deficit in receptor trafficking is unknown; however, one clue may be found in our previous observation that the increase in surface expression of the NR1 subunit is preferential for NR1 subunit splice variants containing the C2 cassette. In examining the expression of NR1 splice variant proteins in aged animals, we find that there is a specific deficit in the expression of the C2 cassette containing subunits. It has been suggested that the cellular quantity of the NR1 subunit protein is determined in part by assembly with other subunits and that the differential assembly of subunits may determine the intracellular distribution of receptor (17.Huh K.H. Wenthold R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 151-157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 18.Winkler A. Mahal B. Kiianmaa K. Zieglgansberger W. Spanagel R. Brain Res. Mol.

Thus, the age-related reduction in the amount of C2 splice variant NR1 subunit may impair the activity-dependent cycling of NMDA receptors. Age-related decreases in the expression of NR2 subunits could also contribute to this scenario, reducing the amount of total functional receptor that could be assembled. These findings extend our understanding of the cellular distribution of NMDA receptors in aged animals and describe a new deficit in the activity-dependent regulation of the cellular distribution of these receptors in aged animals. Further studies are needed to elucidate the importance of activity-dependent alterations in the surface expression of NMDA in synaptic plasticity in aged animals."

T-cell receptor (TCR) and immunoglobulin (Ig) transcripts, which are encoded by genes that very frequently acquire PTCs during lymphoid ontogeny, are down-regulated much more dramatically in response to PTCs than are other known transcripts. Another feature unique to TCR, Ig, and a subset of other mRNAs is that they are down-regulated in response to nonsense codons in the nuclear fraction of cells. This is paradoxical, as the only well recognized entity that recognizes nonsense codons is the cytoplasmic translation apparatus. Therefore, we investigated whether translation is responsible for this nuclear-associated mechanism. We found that the down-regulation of TCR-β transcripts in response to nonsense codons requires several features of translation, including an initiator ATG and the ability to scan. We also found that optimal down-regulation depends on a Kozak consensus sequence surrounding the initiator ATG and that it can be initiated by an internal ribosome entry site, neither of which has been demonstrated before for any other PTC-bearing mRNA. At least a portion of this down-regulatory response is mediated by the NMD pathway as antisense hUPF2 transcripts increased the levels of PTC-bearing TCR-β transcripts in the nuclear fraction of cells. We conclude that a hUPF2-dependent RNA surveillance pathway with translation-like features operating in the nuclear fraction of cells prevents the expression of potentially deleterious truncated proteins encoded by non-productively rearranged TCR genes.

PTCs result from random mutations and biosynthetic errors (in transcription and RNA splicing) that can occur in virtually any gene.

First, the decay rate of such nonsense codon-containing mRNAs is not measurably different from that of their wild-type counterparts in the cytoplasm (1Maquat L.E. Sonenberg N. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Translational Control of Gene Expression. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000: 849-868Google Scholar, 2Li S. Wilkinson M.F.

Cell. 1999; 96: 307-310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar). Second, reductions in the mRNA level in the nuclear fraction of cells mirror those seen in total or cytoplasmic RNA preparations (1Maquat L.E. Sonenberg N. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Translational Control of Gene Expression. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000: 849-868Google Scholar, 2Li S. Wilkinson M.F.

Cell. 1999; 96: 307-310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar). The apparent involvement of the nucleus in this nonsense codon-induced event leads to the question of whether NMD requires translation or instead uses another codon-scanning mechanism. Evidence that NMD involves a mechanism with some features of translation includes its requirement for an initiator ATG and its reversal by several different protein synthesis inhibitors with different mechanisms of action (cycloheximide, emitine, anisomycin, puromycin, pactamycin, and poliovirus) (17Qian L. Vu M.N. Carter M.S. Doskow J. Wilkinson M.F. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 6801-6814PubMed Google Scholar, 18Carter M.S. Doskow J. Morris P., Li, S. Nhim R.P. Sandstedt S. Wilkinson M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28995-29003Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 19Li S. Leonard D. Wilkinson M.F. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 985-992Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 20Noensie E.N. Dietz H.C. Nat. Biotechnol. 2001; 19: 434-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). However, the requirement for an ATG does not prove the involvement of conventional translation, and general protein synthesis inhibitors could reverse NMD by a mechanism not involving a blockade of mRNA scanning; for example, they could act by simply depleting cells of one or more unstable proteins necessary for NMD. Furthermore, the mechanism that down-regulates TCR and Ig transcripts in response to nonsense codons may differ from that which acts on other transcripts. In the present investigation, we investigated the role of translation and ribosomes in the down-regulation of TCR-β transcripts harboring nonsense codons using new approaches. Our results showed not only did optimal down-regulation of TCR-β mRNA require an initiator ATG, it also depended on key nucleotide residues surrounding the ATG that are required for efficient translation. Such Kozak consensus sequences are a signature feature of translatable open reading frames (21Kozak M. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 887-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (1451) Google Scholar), which strongly support a role for translation in TCR-β mRNA down-regulation. We found that TCR-β down-regulation in response to nonsense codons also had several other features of translation, including the ability to be down-regulated by an internal ribosome entry site (IRES), a cis element that specifically recruits ribosomes for translation (22Carter M.S. Kuhn K.M. Sarnow P. Sonenberg N. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Translational Control of Gene Expression. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY.2000: 615-635Google Scholar). Lastly, to determine whether TCR-β down-regulation in response to nonsense codons has features of classic NMD, we examined the role of UPF2, which has been shown in S. cerevisiae to be required for NMD. Our antisense studies clearly showed that the down-regulation of TCR-β transcripts depends on human UPF2 (hUPF2). To our knowledge, this is the first time that hUPF2 has been shown to be required for the down-regulation of any transcript in response to nonsense codons in mammalian cells. Construct A (β-290) contains a wild-type TCR-β gene with a full-length open reading frame (pAc/IF in Ref. 16Carter M.S., Li, S. Wilkinson M.F. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5965-5975Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). B and C (β-367, β-368, respectively) are derivatives of A that contain nonsense (TAA) and missense (TAC) mutations at codon 68 in the VDJ exon generated by site-specific mutagenesis, respectively. D, E, and F (β-658, β-627, and β-617, respectively) each contain a stem loop (ΔG − 61 kcal/mol) identical to that previously shown to impede translation (23Belgrader P. Cheng J. Maquat L.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 482-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) at a site 42 nt upstream of the initiator ATG in constructs B, C, and A, respectively. G (β-495) is a TCR-β minigene (containing L, VDJ, and a C2.1-C2.4 chimeric exon) cloned between the SalI and Hin dIII sites of the vector pSBC-2-C4 (EV 147) (24Dirks W. Wirth M. Hauser H. Gene. 1993; 128: 247-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). The TCR-β minigene in G is identical to the one we previously described (construct C in Ref. 19Li S. Leonard D. Wilkinson M.F. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 985-992Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) except that the JC intron was shortened from 1021 nt to 358 nt by cutting out an internal Eco 01091 fragment. H (β-496) is identical to G except it has a TAA nonsense codon at codon 68. I (β-498) and J (β-497) were prepared by inserting a 1.1-kb ClaI/NotI fragment from pSBC-1-C2 (EV-147), which contains the type I poliovirus IRES (nt 1–628 of the 5′-untranslated region (UTR)) (24Dirks W. Wirth M. Hauser H. Gene. 1993; 128: 247-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) between the ClaI and NotI sites of G and H, respectively. K (β-600) is identical to B except that it has mutated initiator ATGs rendered defective as previously described (construct I in Ref. 19Li S. Leonard D. Wilkinson M.F. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 985-992Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). L (β-639) is a derivative of B that has only the VDJ exon initiator ATG mutated as previously described (construct H in Ref. 19Li S. Leonard D. Wilkinson M.F. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 985-992Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). M, N, O, and P (β-626, β-630, β-647, and β-665, respectively) are derivatives of construct L that contain point mutations in the Kozak consensus sequences. Q (β-760) and R (β-756) are identical to N and P, respectively, except that they lack PTCs. S (β-595) is a derivative of A that contains a nonsense mutation (TAG) at codon 98 (in the VDJ exon). The anti-UPF2 construct (G-407) was generated by inserting a 0.5-kb hUPF2 fragment between the SalI and BamHI sites of the pHβ Apr-1-neo (EV-107) vector (26Gunning P. Leavitt J. Muscat G. Ng S.Y. Kedes L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 4831-4835Crossref PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar) such that it is in the antisense orientation with respect to the β-actin promoter. The hUPF2 fragment was a PCR product generated with the primers MDA-720 (5′-CTGGGATCCCGAGCGCTGGAGTTGGTG-3′) and MDA-703 (5′-CCTGTCGACGCTGAATGGATTCTTC-3′) using the plasmid pCMV-rent 2 (G-314) (25Mendell J.T. Medghalchi S.M. Lake R.G. Noensie E.N. Dietz H.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8944-8957Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) as the template. G-1F was prepared by inserting the human β-globin gene into the Hin dIII and BamHI sites of EV-107. All mutations introduced in the constructs described above were generated by site-specific mutagenesis (27Wang J. Wilkinson M.F. BioTechniques. 2000; 29: 976-978Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). DNA constructs were transiently transfected into HeLa cells using LipofectAMINE according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). Total and nuclear RNA were isolated as described previously (28Mühlemann O. Mock-Casagrande C.S. Wang J., Li, S. Custodio N. Carmo-Fonseca M. Wilkinson M.F. Moore M.J. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 33-43Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). TCR-β mRNA levels were determined using a direct radioactivity scanner (Instant Imager; Packard Instruments, Downers Grove, IL). RNase protection analysis (RPA) and the riboprobes (TCR-β, neomycin, β-actin) used for this analysis were described previously (28Mühlemann O. Mock-Casagrande C.S. Wang J., Li, S. Custodio N. Carmo-Fonseca M. Wilkinson M.F. Moore M.J. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 33-43Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The β−globin riboprobe template is a 250-nt PCR fragment containing 50 nt of the 3′ end of human β−globin intron 2 and 200 nt of exon 3. The hUPF2 riboprobe template is a 189-nt hUPF2 3′-cDNA fragment. We determined that our RPA assay was quantitative by performing titration experiments; increasing the amount of input RNA linearly increased the level of the protected TCR-β bands, whereas increasing the amount of riboprobe had no effect on the protected bands, indicating that excess probe was present in the annealing reaction (data not shown). To examine the role of translation in the down-regulation of TCR-β mRNA in response to nonsense codons, we transiently transfected TCR-β constructs into HeLa cells. We used HeLa cells because they reproduce all aspects of the PTC-mediated down-regulation of TCR-β transcripts that we have observed in stably transfected T cells (16Carter M.S., Li, S. Wilkinson M.F. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5965-5975Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 18Carter M.S. Doskow J. Morris P., Li, S. Nhim R.P. Sandstedt S. Wilkinson M.F. J. Biol.

Moore M.J. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 33-43Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). A major advantage of HeLa cells over T cells is they can be transiently transfected with sufficient efficiency to permit analysis of the RNA products by RPA. To determine whether the down-regulation of TCR-β transcripts in response to nonsense codons depends on a scanning process, we introduced a stem loop in the 5′-UTR of a functionally rearranged Vβ8.1Dβ2Jβ2.3Cβ2gene that we have used in past studies to examine the response to nonsense codons (16Carter M.S., Li, S. Wilkinson M.F. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5965-5975Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 18Carter M.S. Doskow J. Morris P., Li, S. Nhim R.P. Sandstedt S. Wilkinson M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28995-29003Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 28Mühlemann O. Mock-Casagrande C.S. Wang J., Li, S. Custodio N. Carmo-Fonseca M. Wilkinson M.F.

EMBO J. 2002; 21: 125-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 30Wang J. Gudikote J.P. Olivas O.R. Wilkinson M.F. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 274-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The stem loop that we introduced was identical to that which has been shown in past studies to efficiently inhibit 5′ cap-dependent translation (23Belgrader P. Cheng J. Maquat L.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 482-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Introduction of this stem loop almost completely abolished the down-regulation of TCR-β mRNA in response to a PTC (Fig. 1). Down-regulation was >25-fold without the stem loop (compare construct B with A) and was reduced to ∼2-fold after addition of the stem loop (compare construct D with F). The stem loop specifically prevented the down-regulatory response to a nonsense mutation, as it had no effect on the level of mRNA that had a silent mutation at the same site as the nonsense codon (constructs C and E). We conclude that either translation or some other scanning mechanism that reads across the 5′-UTR is required to trigger TCR-β mRNA down-regulation in response to a nonsense codon. To test whether ribosomes are involved in the scanning event, we examined whether an IRES permitted TCR-β down-regulation in response to a nonsense codon. To assess this, we generated TCR-β minigene constructs with or without a type I poliovirus IRES (31Pelletier J. Sonenberg N. Nature. 1988; 334: 320-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (1395) Google Scholar, 32Sarnow P. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 467-470Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We found that introduction of a nonsense codon caused 3-fold down-regulation of IRES-containing TCR-β transcripts (compare constructs I with J in Fig. 2), which is comparable with the amount of down-regulation of many non-IRES-containing transcripts, including those encoding triosephosphate isomerase and β-globin (18Carter M.S. Doskow J. Morris P., Li, S. Nhim R.P. Sandstedt S. Wilkinson M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28995-29003Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 23Belgrader P. Cheng J. Maquat L.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 482-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Introduction of a nonsense codon in the IRES-lacking (control) construct down-regulated TCR-β mRNA expression by 10-fold (compare construct G with H in Fig. 2). The ∼3-fold higher degree of down-regulation exhibited by the IRES-lacking TCR-β mRNA is consistent with previous studies showing that cap-dependent translation is ∼3-fold more efficient than poliovirus IRES-mediated translation (24Dirks W. Wirth M. Hauser H. Gene. 1993; 128: 247-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 33Hennecke M. Kwissa M. Metzger K. Oumard A. Kroger A. Schirmbeck R. Reimann J. Hauser H. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 3327-3334Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). We previously showed that an initiator ATG is essential for the down-regulation of transcripts derived from a TCR-β minigene containing a PTC (19Li S. Leonard D. Wilkinson M.F. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 985-992Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). We showed that there are two ATGs that could trigger down-regulation in this minigene: the normal initiator in the leader (L) exon and a downstream ATG in the 5′ end of the variable region (VDJ) exon that is in frame with the L exon ATG. Only mutation of both ATGs reversed TCR-β down-regulation in response to a PTC (19Li S. Leonard D. Wilkinson M.F. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 985-992Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Here, we first examined whether an ATG was needed for the down-regulation of transcripts from a full-length version of this TCR-β gene. Mutation of the VDJ ATG had no appreciable effect on TCR-β down-regulation (data not shown). However, when the L ATG was also mutated (construct K), down-regulation was almost completely reversed (compare construct B that has both the L and VDJ ATGs intact with construct K that has both the L and VDJ ATGs mutated) (Fig. 3A). We conclude that the normal initiator ATG in the L exon is essential for the robust down-regulation of full-length TCR-β transcripts in response to a PTC when the alternative ATG in the VDJ exon is also mutated so that it cannot be used as an alternative initiation site. If conventional translation is responsible for TCR-β down-regulation in response to nonsense codons, then both the initiator ATG and the surrounding nucleotides known to be essential for efficient translational initiation should be required for optimal down-regulation (21Kozak M. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 887-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (1451) Google Scholar). This issue has never been addressed before for any gene. To test this, we mutated the nucleotides surrounding the L exon ATG in constructs that had the VDJ exon ATG mutated to prevent alternative initiation from this second initiator site. We found that mutation of the two most critical Kozak consensus sequences required for translation (purines at the −3 and +4 positions with respect to the ATG) prevented a full down-regulatory response (compare mutated construct P with the wild-type construct L; Table I). As expected, polysome analysis demonstrated that this double mutation significantly inhibited translation (data not shown). More subtle mutations that only substituted one (not both) of the critical purines (constructs M and O), and thus would be expected to only minimally inhibit translation, had either no or only a modest inhibitory effect on down-regulation (Table I). Inversely, a mutation that better matched the TCR-β sequence to the Kozak consensus sequence (construct N) triggered a stronger down-regulatory response (Table I).Table IThe effect of Kozak consensus sequence mutations on NMDConstructL exonmRNA levelLTCTGAGATGGGC1.00MTCTCAGATGGAC1.13 ± 0.20NTCTAAGATGGAC0.64 ± 0.18OTCTGAGATGTGC1.09 ± 0.01PTCTTAGATGTGC1.67 ± 0.15Shown is the sequence surrounding the L exon ATG in five different constructs, each of which contain a full-length TCR-β gene harboring a PTC (TAA) at codon 68 in the VDJ exon.

The VDJ exon ATG in each construct was disrupted by mutation, whereas the ATG in the L exon (shown) is intact. mRNA levels were determined by RPA and normalization against neomycin mRNA levels (as in Fig. 1). The values obtained reflect the average and standard error from three to four experiments. Open table in a new tab Shown is the sequence surrounding the L exon ATG in five different constructs, each of which contain a full-length TCR-β gene harboring a PTC (TAA) at codon 68 in the VDJ exon. The Kozak consensus sequence is GCCR CCATGG AT. R (R = A, G) and G are the most critical residues for start-site recognition. The VDJ exon ATG in each construct was disrupted by mutation, whereas the ATG in the L exon (shown) is intact. mRNA levels were determined by RPA and normalization against neomycin mRNA levels (as in Fig. 1). The values obtained reflect the average and standard error from three to four experiments. The nonsense codon-bearing constructs with the best- and least-matched Kozak sequences (constructs N and P, respectively) differed in their mRNA levels by almost 3-fold (Fig. 3B). In contrast, there was no significant difference in the level of mRNA expressed from constructs that had these same mutations but lacked a nonsense codon (constructs Q and R) (Fig. 3B). Thus, these Kozak consensus sequence mutations do not have a general effect on mRNA metabolism. We conclude that an optimal down-regulatory response to a nonsense codon requires Kozak consensus nucleotides surrounding an intact initiator ATG. Our finding that the match to the Kozak consensus sequence correlated with the ability to down-regulate TCR-β transcripts strongly supports the notion that the RNA surveillance pathway responsible for this down-regulatory response involves translation. Once we had obtained several lines of evidence that translation is required for PTC-induced down-regulation of TCR-β transcripts, we next assessed whether this down-regulation is exerted using the NMD RNA surveillance pathway. We considered the possibility that TCR and Ig transcripts use a pathway distinct from NMD, as these mRNAs are transcribed from genes that acquire PTCs much more frequently than do other genes, are down-regulated more strongly in response to nonsense codons than are other known transcripts, and may require a unique second signal to be down-regulated (2Li S. Wilkinson M.F. Immunity. 1998; 8: 135-141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 29Gudikote J.P. Wilkinson M.F. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 125-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 30Wang J. Gudikote J.P. Olivas O.R. Wilkinson M.F. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 274-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). To examine the role of NMD, we assessed whether TCR-β down-regulation required hUPF2. Although human UPF2 has not been proven to be involved in mammalian NMD, its orthologues in S. cerevisiae (Upf2) and Caenorhabditis elegans (Smg3) have been shown to be essential for NMD (3Culbertson M.R. Trends Genet. 1999; 15: 74-80Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar, 6Jacobson A. Peltz S.W. Sonenberg N. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Translational Control of Gene Expression. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000: 827-847Google Scholar, 7Gonzalez C.I. Bhattacharya A. Wang W. Peltz S.W. Gene. 2001; 274: 15-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Furthermore, tethering a hUPF2/MS2 fusion protein downstream of the stop codon in β-globin mRNA triggers an NMD-like response in HeLa cells (34Lykke-Andersen J. Shu M.D. Steitz J.A. Cell. 2000; 103: 1121-1131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). To determine the role of hUPF2 in TCR-β down-regulation, we generated an expression plasmid that transcribes antisense hUPF2 mRNA. This anti-hUPF2 plasmid was cotransfected with TCR-β plasmids into HeLa cells, followed by RPA of nuclear RNA from these cells. Cotransfection of the anti-hUPF2 plasmid partially reversed the down-regulation of PTC-bearing TCR-β transcripts in the nuclear fraction (Fig. 4A). This reversal was specific for the transcript harboring the nonsense codon (construct S) as its level was increased 4-fold, whereas the levels of the wild-type transcript (construct A) were not altered (Fig. 4A). Cotransfection of a control vector plasmid that lacked antisense hUPF2 sequences had no effect on TCR-β mRNA down-regulation (data not shown). To determine the degree of inhibition caused by anti-hUPF2, we examined hUPF2 mRNA levels by RPA. We found that cotransfection of the antisense-hUPF2 construct significantly decreased the level of endogenous hUPF2 mRNA (∼3-fold) compared with its level after cotransfection with a control vector-only plasmid (Fig. 4B). We therefore conclude that hUPF2 participates in the down-regulation of TCR-β transcripts in response to nonsense codons. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration that human UPF2 is essential for the NMD response in mammalian cells. We have provided several lines of new evidence that the down-regulation of TCR-β transcripts in response to nonsense codons requires translation even though it occurs in the nuclear fraction of cells. We demonstrated that this down-regulation is mediated by an initiator ATG-dependent scanning process that requires the Kozak consensus sequence for optimal down-regulation (Figs. 1 and 3). This, along with our observation that the down-regulation can be triggered by an IRES (Fig. 2) and that it is reversed by specific suppressor tRNAs (19Li S. Leonard D. Wilkinson M.F. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 985-992Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), strongly suggests that nonsense codons down-regulate TCR-β transcripts by a mechanism that depends on translation. The simplest interpretation of our IRES data is that the NMD down-regulatory response requires a ribosome, although we cannot rule out that a non-ribosomal entity was recruited by the IRES in our experiments. To our knowledge, this is the first time that the down-regulatory response to a nonsense codon has been shown to be elicited by a 5′ cap-independent mechanism. Several lines of evidence support the view that the IRES we used drives cap-independent translation and blocks cap-dependent translation. First, dicistronic mRNAs that contain the poliovirus IRES inserted between two reporter cistrons efficiently translate the second cistron without a requirement for ribosomes to traverse the first cistron (24Dirks W. Wirth M. Hauser H. Gene. 1993; 128: 247-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Second, introduction of small lesions throughout the central portion of the poliovirus IRES (region P) block cap-independent initiation (35Trono D. Pelletier J. Sonenberg N. Baltimore D. Science. 1988; 241: 445-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Third, when the poliovirus IRES situated upstream of a reporter gene was debilitated by deletion or point mutation, translation of the reporter gene was extinguished, indicating that this IRES does not permit cap-dependent translation, probably because of its strong secondary structure (36Meerovitch K. Nicholson R. Sonenberg N. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 5895-5901Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Fourth, when the extensive stem loop-rich region of the poliovirus IRES was deleted, cap-dependent translation was now permitted (37Pelletier J. Kaplan G. Racaniello V.R. Sonenberg N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 1103-1112Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Collectively, our data strongly suggests that the translation apparatus is responsible for scanning TCR-β mRNAs for nonsense codons. This codon scanning could occur in the nucleus proper as recent evidence suggests that ∼10% of mammalian cell translation is coupled with transcription in the nucleus (38Iborra F.J. Jackson D.A. Cook P.R. Science. 2001; 293: 1139-1142Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). This notion is further supported by evidence for coupled transcription and translation in lower eukaryotes and the finding that charged tRNAs and some translation initiation and elongation factors accumulate in the nucleus of mammalian cells (38Iborra F.J. Jackson D.A. Cook P.R. Science. 2001; 293: 1139-1142Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar, 39Dostie J. Lejbkowicz F. Sonenberg N. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 239-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 40Wilkinson M.F. Shyu A.B. Bioessays. 2001; 23: 775-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Alternatively, nonsense codon scanning may be mediated by cytoplasmic ribosomes that biochemically cofractionate with the nucleus. Even though we purified nuclei using two detergents (Nonidet P-40 and sodium deoxycholate) by a protocol that removes >97% of cytoplasmic mRNA (16Carter M.S., Li, S. Wilkinson M.F. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5965-5975Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar), it is possible that NMD occurs near the nuclear membrane and thus copurifies with the nucleus (1Maquat L.E. Sonenberg N. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Translational Control of Gene Expression. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000: 849-868Google Scholar, 41Shyu A.B. Wilkinson M.F. Cell. 2000; 102: 135-138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). This cytoplasmic scanning model appears to apply to β-globin mRNA, as it has been shown that specific blockade of cytoplasmic scanning by the cytoplasmic RNA-binding protein aconitase reverses β-globin NMD (42Thermann R.

Our demonstration that nonsense codons down-regulate TCR-β transcripts by a UPF2-dependent mechanism (Fig. 4) demonstrates the involvement of the classic NMD RNA surveillance pathway in this down-regulatory response. However, we were not able to completely reverse TCR-β mRNA down-regulation, even when we cotransfected high concentrations of anti-hUPF2 plasmid (data not shown). This may reflect the limitations of antisense technology, but it could also indicate that TCR-β transcripts are down-regulated by two mechanisms, one that is hUPF2-dependent (the NMD RNA surveillance pathway) and another that is hUPF2-independent.

GC-C-deficient mice show resistance to STa in intestine but saluretic and diuretic effects of uroguanylin and STa are not disturbed. Here we describe the cellular effects of these peptides using immortalized human kidney epithelial (IHKE-1) cells with properties of the proximal tubule, analyzed with the slow-whole-cell patch clamp technique. Uroguanylin (10 or 100 nm) either hyperpolarized or depolarized membrane voltages (Vm). Guanylin and STa (both 10 or 100 nm), as well as 8-Br-cGMP (100 μm), depolarized Vm. All peptide effects were absent in the presence of 1 mm Ba2+. Uroguanylin and guanylin changed Vm pH dependently. Pertussis toxin (1 μg/ml, 24 h) inhibited hyperpolarizations caused by uroguanylin. Depolarizations caused by guanylin and uroguanylin were blocked by the tyrosine kinase inhibitor, genistein (10 μm). All three peptides increased cellular cGMP. mRNA for GC-C was detected in IHKE-1 cells and in isolated human proximal tubules. In IHKE-1 cells GC-C was also detected by immunostaining. These findings suggest that GC-C is probably the receptor for guanylin and STa. For uroguanylin two distinct signaling pathways exist in IHKE-1 cells, one involves GC-C and cGMP as second messenger, the other is cGMP-independent and connected to a pertussis toxin-sensitive G protein.

GN is probably degraded by chymotrypsin in the glomeruli (13Greenberg R.N. Hill M.J. Crytzer J. Krause W.J. Eber S.L. Hamra F.K. Forte L.R. J. Invest.

Hayakawa T. Anat. Embryol. 1997; 196: 185-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Another possible source of UGN found in the urine are renal tubular cells, because mRNA for UGN as well as GN are detected in the kidney and in isolated tubule fractions (16Potthast R. Ehler E.

Nephron. 2000; 84: 88-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). High salt diets elevate UGN and cGMP levels in the urine. STa also elevates urinary cGMP, and therefore it is reasonable to believe that these peptides act via a guanylate cyclase receptor similar to the intestinal receptor GC-C (11Kinoshita H. Fujimoto S.

GC-C deficient mice (GC-C −/−) show resistance to STa in intestine. In the intestine of GC-C −/− mice 10% of the specific125I-STa binding to receptor sites still remain, suggesting the existence of an additional receptor distinct from GC-C (9Charney A.N. Egnor R.W.

Commun. 1997; 239: 463-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Again two populations of binding sites for STa in the intestine have been identified: high affinity receptors not coupled to the guanylate cyclase (only 5% of binding sites) and low affinity binding sites coupled to the guanylate cyclase (95% of binding sites) (20Crane M.R. Hugues M. O'Hanly P.D. Waldman S.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1992; 41: 1073-1080PubMed Google Scholar). Effects of STa mediated via a signaling pathway independent of GC-C have not been detected so far. In the kidney UGN- and STa-induced natriuresis and kaliuresis in GC-C −/− mice is not disturbed in vivo(21Carrithers S.L. Hill M.J. Johnson B.R., O Hara S.M. Jackson B.A. Ott C.E. Lorenz J. Mann E.A. Giannella R.A. Forte L.R. Greenberg R.N. Braz. J. Med. Biol. Res. 1999; 32: 2-8Crossref Scopus (53) Google Scholar). This indicates the existence of at least one additional receptor distinct from the GC-C receptor also in the kidney. Our study describes for the first time cellular actions of GN, UGN, and STa in human kidney, specifically IHKE-1 cells (22Haugen A. Mehle L. Mollerup S. Rivedal E. Ryberg D. Environ. Health. Persp. 1994; 120: 117-118Google Scholar), analyzed with the slow-whole-cell patch clamp technique. mRNA of GC-C was detected in IHKE-1 cells, human kidney, and in isolated human proximal tubules. In IHKE-1 cells GC-C was also detected by monoclonal antibodies. This is the first study that shows UGN actions via a novel pertussis toxin (PT)-sensitive G protein-coupled signaling mechanism besides the GC-C activated cGMP-dependent pathway. This mechanism might also be responsible for the GC-C independent action of these peptides in extrarenal tissues. IHKE-1 cells derived from the proximal tubule were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and Ham's F-12 medium (1:1) containing in addition: 15 mm Hepes (pH 7.3), 1.6 nm epidermal growth factor, 100 nmhydrocortisone, 65 nm transferrin, 0.84 μminsulin, 29 nm Na2SeO3, 15 mm NaHCO3, 4 mm l-Gln, 5 ml/liter Ciprobay 100 (Bayer, Leverkusen, Germany), and 1% fetal calf serum as described before (23Hirsch J.R. Meyer M. Mägert H.-J. Forssmann W.-G. Mollerup S. Herter P. Weber G. Cermak R. Ankorina-Stark I. Schlatter E. Kruhøffer M. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1999; 10: 472-480PubMed Google Scholar, 24Tveito G.

IHKE-1 cells were used from passages 140 to 180, 3–9 days (average 6 days) after trypsination (0.05% trypsin, 0.02% EDTA in Mg2+, and Ca2+-free phosphate buffer). For patch clamp experiments IHKE-1 cells were grown on glass coverslips. LLC-PK1 cells, passages 180, grown on glass coverslips were used. Cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing in addition: 1% fetal calf serum, 100 000 IU/liter penicillin, 0.1 g/liter streptomycin, and 1 mm l-Gln in an atmosphere of 5% CO2, 95% air at 37 °C. Subculturing was done in the same way as described for IHKE-1 cells. The cells were used 10 days after trypsination. PT, which is derived from Bordetella pertussis and catalyzes the ADP-ribosylation of α subunits of Gi or Go proteins, was used to examine the involvement of G proteins. Monolayers of IHKE-1 cells were incubated with medium containing 1 μg/ml PT for 4 or 24 h before experiments were performed. IHKE-1 cells were cultured to 80% confluency in 12-well plates. Cells were treated for 10 min with 500 μl/well culture medium with 1 mm 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX), or with IBMX and genistein (100 μm) (pH 7.4). Cells were incubated for another 10 min with culture medium containing IBMX or IBMX and genistein, and UGN, GN, STa, or ANP (as positive control). Reactions were stopped by addition of 70% ice-cold ethanol (500 μl/well). The ethanol supernatant was evaporated, the sediment was resuspended in 150 μl of 50 mmNa+-acetate buffer (pH 6.0) and acetylated (25Kuhn M. Raida M. Adermann K. Schulz-Knappe P. Gerzer R. Heim J.M.

Human nephron segments were isolated using the procedure described previously for rat and rabbit (26Schlatter E. Fröbe U. Greger R.

Selected tubules of a total length of 40 mm or glomeruli (400 pieces) were lysed in a 4 m guanidinium chloride buffer and total RNA was isolated using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). IHKE-1 cells were lysed and total RNA was isolated according to the protocol described above for human tubules. Total RNA was incubated with 10 units of DNase I (Promega, Heidelberg, Germany) at 37 °C for 1 h to digest isolated traces of genomic DNA. RNA and DNase I were then separated by an additional cleaning step using a new RNeasy column. cDNA first strand synthesis was performed in a total reaction volume of 30 μl containing 5 μg of total RNA, 10 mmdNTP-Mix, 1 nm p(dT)10 nucleotide primer (Roche Molecular Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim, Germany), and 200 units of murine Moloney leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Promega). 1/30 of each cDNA first strand reaction mixture was then subjected to a 50-μl PCR reaction using 20 pmol of each primer (5′-GCTCGTCGCTCTCCTGAT-3′ and 5′-CACCACCATTCTACTGTCCACT-3′, amplifying a 544-bp product from human guanylate cyclase C receptor) and 1 unit of Taq DNA polymerase (Qiagen). Reaction conditions were as follows: 3 min at 94 °C, 30 s at 55 °C, and 1 min at 72 °C, 1 cycle; 30 s at 94 °C, 30 s at 55 °C, and 1 min at 72 °C, 30 cycles; 30 s at 94 °C, 30 s at 55 °C, and 10 min at 72 °C, 1 cycle. PCR reaction products were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis. PCR products were verified by sequence analyses. GAPDH expression was used as a positive control for the PCR. As negative controls we used two different approaches. In the first, we left out cDNA from the PCR reaction mixture to check for contamination. In the second approach we used isolated RNA instead of cDNA to confirm that no traces of genomic DNA were isolated. IHKE cells cultured on coverslips were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (10 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, 0.9% sodium chloride, PBS) and fixed in PBS containing 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min. Cells were then washed and incubated in 2% bovine serum albumin and 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS to block nonspecific sites and permeabilize, respectively, for 1 h at room temperature. Cells were washed and then incubated overnight with 10 μg/ml GCC:4D7 monoclonal antibody in blocking buffer (29Vijayachandra K. Guruprased M. Bhandari R. Manjunath U.H. Somesh B.P. Srinivasan N. Suguna K. Visweswariah S.S. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 16075-16083Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In parallel, cells were incubated with 10 μg/ml normal mouse IgG, as negative control. Cells were washed six times for 5 min each with PBS and then incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-tagged anti-mouse IgG (Invitrogen, New Delhi, India) diluted 1:100 in blocking buffer for 1 h at room temperature. Cells were again washed six times with PBS and stained with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindol (250 ng/ml) for 3 min to stain nuclei and demonstrate the vitality of the cells. Cells were washed three times with PBS and mounted in Vectashield mounting medium (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA). Cells were visualized under a Zeiss fluorescence microscope using standard filters for fluorescein isothiocyanate and 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindol at ×100 magnification. Coverslips with IHKE-1 or LLC-PK1 cells were mounted as the bottom of a perfusion chamber on an inverted microscope (Axiovert 10, Zeiss, Göttingen, Germany). Membrane voltages (Vm) were measured with the slow-whole-cell patch clamp method (30Greger R. Kunzelmann K. Pflüg. Arch. 1991; 419: 209-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). A modified Ringer solution was used for experiments containing: 145 mm NaCl, 1.6 mm K2HPO4, 0.4 mmKH2PO4, 5 mm d-glucose, 1 mm MgCl2, 1.3 mm calcium gluconate (pH 7.4). All substances used in experiments were dissolved in Ringer solution. Experiments were performed at 37 °C with a bath perfusion rate of 10 ml/min. The filling solution for patch clamp pipettes contained: 95 mm potassium gluconate, 30 mm KCl, 4.8 mm Na2HPO4, 1.2 mm NaH2PO4, 5 mm d-glucose, 0.726 mm calcium gluconate, 1 mm EGTA, 1.034 mm MgCl2, 1 mm ATP (pH 7.2). To this solution, 160 μmnystatin were added to permeabilize the membrane. The solution was sterile filtered before use. Patch pipettes had an input resistance of 8–12 MΩ. Vm was measured with a patch clamp amplifier (U. Fröbe, Physiologisches Institut, Universität Freiburg, Germany) and recorded continuously on a pen recorder (WeKa graph Alfos WK-250R, WKK, Kaltbrunn, Switzerland). Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and Ham's F-12 medium were obtained from Gibco (Karlsruhe, Germany). Glutamine, fetal calf serum, and trypsin were purchased from Biochrom (Berlin, Germany). UGN, GN, and ANP were synthesized in the Niedersächsisches Institut für Peptid-Forschung (IPF, Hannover, from Dr. K. Adermann). UGN was in addition purchased from Peptide Institute (Osaka, Japan) (no differences in activity of UGN from these different suppliers were observed). Epidermal growth factor, PT, and STa were obtained from Calbiochem (Schwalbach, Germany). All other standard chemicals were supplied by Merck (Darmstadt, Germany) and Sigma (Taufkirchen, Germany). Data are presented as mean ± S.E., with the number of experiments given in brackets. For statistical analyses Student's paired and unpaired t test was used where appropriate with each effect compared with its own control. If more than two parameters were compared we used paired ANOVA with post-hoc Tukey test. A p value < 0.05 was considered significant and is indicated by an asterisk. Membrane voltages (Vm) of IHKE-1 cells were measured with the slow-whole-cell patch clamp technique. Basal Vm was −39.6 ± 0.6 mV (n = 210). Increasing extracellular K+ concentration from 3.6 to 18.6 mm depolarized cells by 6.0 ± 0.2 mV (n = 182). Ba2+ (1 mm), a blocker of K+ channels, caused depolarizations of 8.5 ± 0.4 mV (n = 49). Effects of GN, STa, and UGN on Vm are shown in Fig. 1. GN depolarized cells significantly at concentrations ≥1 nm with a maximal effect of 3.9 ± 0.9 mV (n = 5) at 100 nm. STa also depolarized cells and reached a maximal effect at a concentration of 10 nm (2.5 ± 0.3, n = 25). In 20% of the cells (the same passages) STa (10 nm) also caused the opposite effect of −1.8 ± 0.4 mV (n = 6, data not shown). UGN significantly hyperpolarized cells at 1 nm(−1.6 ± 0.5 mV, n = 8), but at higher concentrations caused either hyperpolarizations or depolarizations (10 nm: −3.1 ± 0.5 mV, n = 46 and 2.4 ± 0.2 mV, n = 46). This dual effect of UGN was not only shown in IHKE-1 cells, but also in the pig kidney epithelial cell line (LLC-PK1). Out of 4 cells, 3 hyperpolarized upon UGN by −4.5 ± 1 mV and one depolarized by 3 mV. These opposite effects of UGN and STa were seen in the same monolayers with no apparent morphological or other functional differences. The membrane permeable cGMP analog, 8-Br-cGMP (100 μm), depolarized IHKE-1 cells by 2.8 ± 0.5 mV (n = 12). All effects of GN, UGN, and STa (10 nm each) were abolished in the presence of the K+ channel blocker Ba2+ (1 mm, Fig. 2), indicating the involvement of changes in K+ conductances. Effects of all peptides were restored after Ba2+ was washed out.Figure 2Inhibition of GN, STa, and UGN (10 nm) effects on Vm (mV) in IHKE-1 cells in the presence of Ba2+ (1 mm).

GN is more potent in alkaline, UGN in acidic pH (31Hamra F.K. Eber S.L. Chin D.T. Currie M.G. Forte L.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2705-2710Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Therefore, we compared the effects of GN, UGN, and STa at pH 5.5, 7.4, and 8.0 (Fig. 3). Changing the extracellular pH from 7.4 to 8.0 hyperpolarized cells by −3.3 ± 0.5 mV (n = 19) and to pH 5.5 depolarized cells by 21.9 ± 1.5 mV (n = 19). This acidification led to an inactivation of K+ channels in the apical membrane of rabbit proximal tubule cells (32Merot J. Bidet M. Maout S. Tauc M. Poujeol P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 978: 134-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) and most likely also in IHKE-1 cells. In our study Ba2+ (1 mm) still depolarized Vm by 2.0 ± 0.4 mV (n = 8) at pH 5.5. This effect was 60% lower than the effect of Ba2+ on the same cells at pH 7.4 (5.9 ± 0.5, n = 8). GN (10 nm) caused depolarizations at all pH values but it was significantly less potent at pH 5.5 compared with pH 7.4 (pH 5.5, 1.0 ± 0.2 mV; pH 7.4, 2.2 ± 0.3 mV; pH 8.0, 1.3 ± 0.4 mV, n = 7). STa (10 nm) caused similar depolarizations at all pH values (pH 5.5, 1.3 ± 0.1 mV; pH 7.4, 2.0 ± 0.3 mV; pH 8.0, 1.5 ± 0.3 mV, n = 5). In paired experiments UGN (10 nm) showed depolarizations at pH 5.5 (2.4 ± 0.4 mV, n = 10), when pH was changed to 7.4, UGN showed either depolarizations (1.5 ± 0.4 mV,n = 6) or hyperpolarizations (-2.6 ± 0.6 mV,n = 4) and after changing pH to 8.0 UGN caused only hyperpolarizations (−2.1 ± 0.3 mV, n = 10). Taken together, these data suggest the involvement of cGMP in the signaling pathway for GN, UGN, and STa causing depolarizations of IHKE-1 cells. Activation of PT-sensitive G proteins open K+channels in the plasma membrane which can cause hyperpolarizations (33Brown A.M. Yatani A. Kirsch G. Okabe K. VanDongen A.M. Birnbaumer L. J. Bioenerg.

Therefore, we incubated cells with 1 μg/ml PT for 24 h. Basal Vm in these cells was −35.1 ± 0.7 mV (n = 14). Increasing the extracellular K+concentration from 3.6 to 18.6 mm depolarized these cells by 3.8 ± 0.3 mV (n = 10). Ba2+ (1 mm) caused depolarizations of 5.4 ± 0.3 mV (n = 7). Preincubation of IHKE-1 cells with PT had no effect on depolarizations caused by GN, UGN, or STa (each 10 nm). Hyperpolarizations caused by 1 nm UGN (control, −1.6 ± 0.5 mV, n = 8; PT, −0,6 ± 0.4 mV, n = 4) and by 10 nm (control, −2.4 ± 0.5 mV, n = 5; PT, −0,5 ± 0.2 mV, n = 6) were inhibited. When pH was set to 8.0, effects of UGN (10 nm) were even reversed to depolarizations (Fig. 4). Incubation of cells with PT for only 4 h also completely blocked UGN-induced hyperpolarizations (n = 5). The kinase homology domain of guanylate cyclases including GC-C is tyrosine phosphorylated in the basal state. The role of this phosphorylation in the GC-C function is not known yet (35Bhandari R.

In our study, an inhibitor of tyrosine kinases, genistein (10 μm), was able to block all depolarizations of Vm of IHKE-1 cells induced by GN (n = 7) or UGN (n = 11, each 10 nm). Hyperpolarizations induced by UGN (n = 4), however, were not significantly altered in the presence of genistein (Fig. 5). Cells were preincubated for 10 min with IBMX (1 mm) and incubated with GN, UGN, or STa in the presence of IBMX for 10 min. Concentrations of cGMP were measured with a specific radioimmunoassay. Results are summarized in Table I. ANP, which was used as positive control, increased cGMP in IHKE-1 as shown before (23Hirsch J.R. Meyer M. Mägert H.-J. Forssmann W.-G. Mollerup S. Herter P.

Human nephron segments were isolated from cortical kidney pieces of patients undergoing tumor nephrectomies. mRNA for GC-C was detected by reverse transcriptase-PCR in IHKE-1 cells, human kidney, and isolated human proximal tubules (Fig. 6).

https://openalex.org/W2086315977,"The TATA box binding protein TBP plays a universally important role in eukaryotic nuclear transcription. By mutagenesis, we have discovered a solvent-exposed surface of the structured TBP core domain that is important for inhibition of the DNA binding and DNA-bending activities of full-length wild-type TBP. Full-length wild-type TBP initially binds the TATA box to form an unstable complex containing unbent DNA, and then it slowly forms a stable complex containing bent DNA. TFIIB greatly accelerates formation of a bent TFIIB-TBP-TATA box complex, and the inhibitory DNA binding surface of TBP contributes to the cooperativity of binding to TFIIB. Using TBP and TFIIB, we show that TBP can bind the TATA box through a regulated two-step mechanism, involving a transition from unbent complex to bent complex."

In each of the three biosynthesis steps, at least two proteins or domains are linked for catalysis. For steps 1 and 2, bicistronic mocs (molybdenumcofactor synthesis) mRNAs were found (mocs1 and mocs2) that have been proposed to encode two separate proteins (A and B). In both cases, the A proteins share a highly conserved ubiquitin-like double glycine motif, which is functionally important at least for the small subunit of molybdopterin (MPT) synthase (MOCS2A). Besides the bicistronic form of mocs1, two alternative splice transcripts were found, resulting in the expression of multidomain proteins embodying both MOCS1A, but without the double glycine motif, and the entire MOCS1B. Here we describe the first functional characterization of the human proteins MOCS1A and MOCS1B as well as the MOCS1A-MOCS1B fusion proteins that catalyze the formation of precursor Z, a 6-alkyl pterin with a cyclic phosphate, the immediate precursor of MPT in molybdenum cofactor biosynthesis. High level expression of MOCS1A and MOCS1B in Escherichia coli resulted in the formation and accumulation of precursor Z that was subsequently converted to MPT. We showed that for catalytic activity MOCS1A needs an accessible C-terminal double glycine motif.

Rev. 1998; 22: 503-521Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moco biosynthesis is an ancient, ubiquitous, and highly conserved pathway leading to the biological activation of molybdenum. In humans, defects in Moco biosynthesis lead to the pleiotropic loss of the molybdenum enzymes sulfite oxidase, aldehyde oxidase, and xanthine dehydrogenase (3Reiss J. Hum. Genet. 2000; 106: 157-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Affected patients show neurological abnormalities such as attenuated brain growth, untreatable seizures, and often dislocated ocular lenses, and they usually die shortly after birth (4Johnson J.L. Rajagopalan K.V. Wadman S.K. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1993; 338: 373-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Moco biosynthesis in humans can be divided into three major steps (3Reiss J. Hum. Genet. 2000; 106: 157-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). In step 1,mocs1 (molybdenum cofactorsynthesis-step 1) has been reported to produce two enzymes (MOCS1A and MOCS1B) within a bicistronic transcript with two consecutive ORFs (5Reiss J. Christensen E.

These two enzymatic activities catalyze the synthesis of precursor Z, an oxygen-sensitive 6-alkyl pterin with a cyclic phosphate, from a guanosine derivative, most likely GTP (7Wuebbens M.M.

In step 2, the conversion of precursor Z into MPT is catalyzed by MOCS3 and MPT synthase (mocs2) that encodes by leaky scanning the small (MOCS2A) and large (MOCS2B) subunits of this heteromeric enzyme via a single transcript with two overlapping ORFs (9Stallmeyer B.

In addition, a third type of Moco deficiency, type C, is caused by mutations in the gephyrin gene (13Reiss J. Gross-Hardt S. Christensen E. Schmidt P. Mendel R.R. Schwarz G. Am. J. Hum.

The plant and human orthologs of the Escherichia coli proteins MoaA (Cnx2, MOCS1A) and MoaC (Cnx3, MOCS1B) show N-terminal extensions of yet unknown function. MOCS1A and homologous proteins are characterized by two cysteine clusters probably involved in iron-sulfur (FeS) cluster binding (18Menendez C. Igloi G. Henninger H. Brandsch R. Arch.

Based on sequence similarities to proteins like biotin synthase, pyruvate formate lyase-activating enzyme, anaerobic ribonucleotide reductase-activating enzyme, and lysine 2,3-aminomutase, MOCS1A belongs to a new superfamily called “radical S-adenosylmethionine (SAM)” proteins (21Sofia H.J. Chen G. Hetzler B.G. Reyes-Spindola J.F. Miller N.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 1097-1106Crossref PubMed Scopus (795) Google Scholar). It is proposed that they generate a radical species by reductive cleavage of SAM through an unusual FeS cluster. Proteins belonging to this family catalyze diverse reactions, including unusual methylations, isomerization, sulfur insertion, ring formation, anaerobic oxidation, and protein radical formation (21Sofia H.J. Chen G. Hetzler B.G. Reyes-Spindola J.F. Miller N.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 1097-1106Crossref PubMed Scopus (795) Google Scholar). In addition, MOCS1A and homologous proteins from eubacteria and eukaryotes are characterized by a highly conserved C-terminal double glycine motif that is absent in the alternatively spliced MOCS1A-MOCS1B fusion proteins. A similar motif is found in the small subunits of MPT synthases that are C-terminally thiocarboxylated in order to catalyze the sulfur transfer to precursor Z, resulting in the formation of the MPT dithiolene (22Pitterle D.M.

Fold. Des. 2000; 8: 709-718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (61) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that the formation of precursor Z occurs by an alternative cyclohydrolase-like reaction (7Wuebbens M.M. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol.

Biochem. 1998; 255: 24-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). As in the pathways of folate, riboflavin, and biopterin synthesis, a guanosine derivative serves as the initial biosynthetic precursor (25Brown G.M. Blakley R.L. Benkovics S.J. Folates and Pterins. 2. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1985: 299-419Google Scholar, 26Bacher A. Müller F. Chemistry and Biochemistry of Flavoenzymes. 1. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1990: 215-259Google Scholar). During precursor Z synthesis, all carbon atoms of the guanosine are utilized, because the imidazole ring carbon 8 is retained and incorporated in a rearrangement reaction as the first carbon of the precursor Z side chain (7Wuebbens M.M. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1082-1087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 8Rieder C. Eisenreich W. O'Brien J. Richter G. Gotze E. Boyle P. Blanchard S.

Here we describe the first functional characterization of the human proteins MOCS1A and MOCS1B as well as the MOCS1A-MOCS1B fusion proteins derived by alternative splicing. Despite their N-terminal extensions, MOCS1A and MOCS1B were able to restore Moco biosynthesis in E. coli moaA− and moaC− mutants, respectively, which enabled us to study the human proteins by site-directed mutagenesis. Functional analysis was performed by nitrate reductase reconstitution as well as by monitoring the cellular levels of precursor Z and MPT. High level expression of MOCS1A and MOCS1B in E. coli moaA− and moaC− mutants resulted in the formation and accumulation of precursor Z that was subsequently converted to MPT. We showed that for catalytic activity MOCS1A needs an accessible C-terminal double glycine motif. In the MOCS1A-MOCS1B fusion proteins lacking the MOCS1A double glycine motif, only MOCS1B activity could be detected. No evidence was found for an expression of MOCS1B from the bicistronic mocs1A-mocs1B splice type I cDNA, indicating that MOCS1B is only expressed as a fusion to an inactive MOCS1A. Comparative mutational studies of MOCS1A and the small subunit of the E. coli MPT synthase (MoaD) indicate a different function of the double glycine motifs in both proteins.

First, two separate PCRs were conducted with the mocs1A-BamHI sense primer and the antisense primers 5′-GATGAGGATCATGGGCCG-3′ (mocs1A-II) or 5′-TGCATGCTGCCGCTTCTT-3′ (mocs1A-III), respectively, and with the sense primers 5′-AAGAACCGGCCCATGATCCTCATCGAGTTATTTTTGATGTTCCCCAATTCC-3′ (mocs1B-II) or 5′-GGCAGGAAGAAGCGGCAGCATGCAGAGTTATTTTTGATGTTCCCCAATTCC-3′ (mocs1B-III), respectively, and the mocs1B-SalI antisense primer. Both products of each splice type were used as the template for the second round of PCR, which was carried out with the mocs1A-BamHI sense primer and the mocs1B-SalI antisense primer. The resulting plasmids were designated pPH80MOCS1II and pPH80MOCS1III. Oligonucleotides were designed for cloning into the BamHI and SalI sites of pQE80 as depicted under “construction of expression plasmids.” Generation of single and double amino acid substitutions or insertion and deletion of amino acids were achieved by modifying the SalI antisense cloning primer. The following mutations were created: (a) MOCS1A: G384A, G384S, G384C, G384V, G384D, G385A, G385P, G385C, delG385, delGG, GGG*, GGA*, GGV*, AA*, and A*; (b) MoaD: G80A, G80V, G81A, delG81, and GGG*. For the exchange of the mocs1A nonsense codon to an alanine residue, resulting in a MOCS1A-MOCS1B fusion protein, a two-step PCR procedure with pJRMOCS1 as the template was carried out as described under “construction of expression plasmids.” The identity of all mutations was confirmed by DNA sequencing. All expressions were conducted in LB medium at 30 °C. Cultures were induced by the addition of 0.1 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) when cells had reached an optical density of 0.6. After 4 h of growth, cells were harvested and resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 10 mmimidazole, 10% (v/v) glycerol) and sonicated. After centrifugation, the soluble and insoluble fractions were separated by SDS-PAGE using a 12% polyacrylamide gel. Immunoblotting on polyvinylidene difluoride membranes was carried out with primary polyclonal antibodies generated against recombinant MOCS1A (1:5000 diluted serum) and MOCS1B (1:100,000 diluted serum). The membranes were probed with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibody, and bands were visualized by the 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate/nitro blue tetrazolium detection system (Promega). For functional complementation of Moco mutants, E. coli KB strains were transformed with the corresponding expression plasmids. For quantitative determination of nitrate reductase activity, E. coli KB strains were grown anaerobically at 37 °C in 50 ml of LB medium containing 0.4% (w/v) nitrate. Where indicated, protein expression was induced with 0.1 mm IPTG. Nitrate reductase activity in crude cell extracts was determined by a spectroscopic assay using benzyl viologen as described (30MacGregor C.H. Schnaitman C.A. Normansell D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 5321-5327Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined using the Lowry technique (31Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). MPT and precursor Z were detected as dephospho form A and compound Z in crude cell extracts, respectively, according to the method described (28Johnson M.E. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 117-125Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Johnson M.E. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 110-116Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Oxidation, dephosphorylation, diethyl(2-hydroxypropyl)aminoethyl (QAE) Sephadex A-25 chromatography, and HPLC analysis of dephospho form A were performed as described (33Schwarz G. Boxer D.H. Mendel R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26811-26814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Oxidations were carried out with 0.3–0.5 mg of crude cell extract. Compound Z was isolated by the same protocol, but elution from the diethyl(2-hydroxypropyl)aminoethyl (QAE) Sephadex A-25 chromatography matrix was performed with 10 column volumes of 50 mm HCl. HPLC of compound Z was carried out at 1 ml/min with 1% (v/v) methanol in 10 mm potassium phosphate, pH 3.0, as mobile phase using a C18 reversed phase column (4.6 × 250 mm, ODS-Hypersil, particle size 5 μm) on a Hewlett-Packard 1100 series HPLC system (Agilent Technologies, Waldbronn, Germany) equipped with a fluorescence detector (excitation at 370 nm, emission at 450 nm, gain 17×). The mammalian expression vector pPHDNA3MOCS1 carrying the mocs1 splice type I cDNA was generated by subcloning the 1.9-kb EcoRI fragment, derived from pJRMOCS1, into pcDNA3. mocs1 splice types II and III were created as described under “Construction of Expression Plasmids” and cloned into the EcoRI sites of pEGFP-C1. The resulting plasmids were designated pPHGFPCMOCS1II and pPHGFPCMOCS1III. HeLa cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum, according to standard procedures. HeLa cells were co-transfected with 1 μg of the pcDNA3 or pEGFP-C1 constructs and 1 μg of sheared herring sperm DNA by the calcium phosphate method (34Graham F.L. van der Ebb A.J. Virology. 1973; 91: 456Crossref Scopus (6492) Google Scholar). After 24–40 h of growth, cells were washed twice with 1× phosphate-buffered saline and scrapped into SDS-sample buffer. After boiling for 10 min, samples were separated by SDS-PAGE using a 10% polyacrylamide gel and blotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Primary polyclonal MOCS1A (1:250 diluted serum) and MOCS1B (1:250 diluted serum) antibodies were used. The membranes were probed with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody, and bands were visualized by the ECL chemiluminescent detection system (Amersham Biosciences). MOCS1A and MOCS1B were heterologously expressed as His-tagged proteins in E. coli. Overexpression resulted to a large extent in the formation of inclusion bodies (data not shown). Both proteins with apparent molecular masses of 43 kDa (MOCS1A) and 24 kDa (MOCS1B) were recognized by antibodies raised against MOCS1A and MOCS1B in immunoblot analysis. Heterologous expression of MOCS1A and MOCS1B in the E. coli Moco mutants moaA− (KB2037) and moaC− (KB2066), respectively, resulted in a functional reconstitution of Moco biosynthesis as shown by restoration of nitrate reductase activity in both mutant cell lines (for data, see below). However, in contrast to MOCS1A, a functional expression of MOCS1B occurred only under conditions with induced expression (in the presence of 0.1 mm IPTG). Regardless of the N- and C-terminal extensions found in higher eukaryotes, MOCS1A and MOCS1B were able to reconstitute the function of their bacterial counterparts like their plant orthologs Cnx2 and Cnx3 (17Hoff T. Schnorr K.M. Meyer C. Caboche M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6100-6107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). To further investigate the functionality of MOCS1A and MOCS1B, we checked whether or not the expression of MOCS1A and MOCS1B results in an accumulation of known intermediates of the Moco biosynthetic pathway, namely the direct reaction product precursor Z and its subsequent product MPT. Both compounds were detected as their oxidized stable derivatives, compound Z and dephospho form A, respectively, in crude cell extracts of complemented strains (Fig. 2, A–D). The expression of the E. coli moa locus (moaABCDE), which encodes in addition to MoaA and MoaC also MPT synthase, is enhanced under anaerobic growth conditions (35Baker K.P. Boxer D.H. Mol. Microbiol. 1991; 5: 901-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). To ensure a high level of endogenous MoaA and MoaC for precursor Z synthesis, strains were grown anaerobically under nitrate reductase-inducing conditions. Since it is known that precursor Z can only be detected in E. coli strains with inactive MPT synthase, we have used the E. coli strain MJ7 chlM (moaD−) to identify precursor Z in crude cell extracts (32Johnson M.E. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 110-116Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Overexpression (plus 0.1 mm IPTG) of MOCS1A in the moaA−mutant strain resulted in a 5-fold accumulation of precursor Z in comparison with the MJ7 chlM strain and also in a 5-fold higher level of MPT in comparison with the wild type strain MC4100 (Fig. 2E). Under low expression conditions (without IPTG), no precursor Z but wild type levels of MPT could be detected that are the result of a basal expression of MOCS1A due to a leaky promoter. In contrast to MOCS1A, overexpression of MOCS1B resulted only in wild type levels of MPT and amounts of precursor Z comparable with the MJ7 chlM strain. These data show the complete functionality of MOCS1A and MOCS1B in catalyzing the formation of precursor Z that can be subsequently converted to MPT. Furthermore, the high level of precursor Z accumulation under the action of MOCS1A indicates that MOCS1A is the catalytically active and rate-limiting protein in precursor Z formation. MOCS1A and homologous proteins are characterized by two highly conserved cysteine clusters, one in the N-terminal (consensus sequence: C X3C X2C) and one in the C-terminal (consensus sequence: C X2C X13C) region of the protein, both of which are proposed to be involved in FeS cluster binding (18Menendez C. Igloi G. Henninger H. Brandsch R. Arch. Microbiol. 1995; 164: 142-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 19Menendez C. Siebert D. Brandsch R. FEBS Lett. 1996; 391: 101-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The N-terminal cysteine cluster is the major feature of the radical SAM superfamily (21Sofia H.J. Chen G. Hetzler B.G. Reyes-Spindola J.F. Miller N.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 1097-1106Crossref PubMed Scopus (795) Google Scholar) harboring a [4Fe-4S] cluster, whereas the C-terminal cluster is unique for MOCS1A and homologous proteins and is absent in all other members of the radical SAM family. Purified MOCS1A was brownish in color and contained 4 mol of iron/mol of protein, indicating the presence of a [4Fe-4S] cluster. 2P. Hänzelmann, unpublished results. It was recently shown that diverse splicing mechanisms fuse the evolutionarily conserved bicistronic mocs1A and mocs1B ORFs (14Gray T.A. Nicholls R.D. RNA. 2000; 6: 928-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Both identified alternative splice types II and III have deletions of 15 or 63 nucleotides in comparison with the bicistronic splice type I, leading to fusion proteins lacking the conserved C-terminal double glycine motif of MOCS1A (Fig. 1). To investigate the functional properties of these fusion proteins on protein level, both alternative mocs1 splice types were reconstructed from splice type I by PCR based on the published nucleotide sequence (GenBankTMAF214022 and AF214023) and subcloned into the bacterial pQE80 expression vector. For functional characterization, MOCS1 splice type II and splice type III were expressed in the E. coli moaA− mutant KB2037 (plus 0.1 mm IPTG) or moaC− mutant KB2066 (plus 0.1 mm IPTG), and their activities were determined by measuring nitrate reductase activities in crude cell extracts (Fig. 3A). The MOCS1B domain of both fusion proteins was still functionally active (Fig. 3A). In contrast, the MOCS1A domain was not able to restore nitrate reductase activity in the moaA− mutant (Fig. 3A), indicating the importance of the C terminus including the double glycine motif. This finding is in agreement with a mutation of the first glycine to a serine within the double glycine motif leading to human Moco deficiency (3Reiss J. Hum. Genet. 2000; 106: 157-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). To prove whether or not MOCS1A activity can be restored by introduction of the missing C terminus, an artificial MOCS1A-MOCS1B fusion protein still conta"

At high salt (200 mm NaCl) and low temperature (10 °C), hLtn adopts a chemokine-like fold, which consists of a three-stranded antiparallel β-sheet and a C-terminal α-helix (Kuloğlu, E.

The C-terminal α-helix observed at 10 °C and 200 mm NaCl, which is conserved in other chemokines, is absent at 45 °C and no salt, and the last 38 residues of the protein are completely disordered, as indicated by heteronuclear15N-1H NOEs. Temperature dependence of the tryptophan fluorescence of hLtn in low and high salt confirmed that the chemokine conformation is stabilized by increased ionic strength. Sedimentation equilibrium analytical ultracentrifugation showed that hLtn at 40 °C in the presence of 100 mm NaCl exists mainly as a dimer. Under near physiological conditions of temperature, pH, and ionic strength, both the chemokine-like and non-chemokine-like conformations of hLtn are significantly populated.

Because of the broad range of their immunoregulatory roles, chemokines and their receptors are targets for drug development for control of allergic and autoimmune diseases as well as for HIV infection, because entry of the virus into cells is dependent on binding to a chemokine receptor. Chemokines are divided into four subclasses on the basis of the number of conserved cysteine residues and their spacing. Most of the ∼50 known chemokines belong to either the CC or C XC subclass. The two other subclasses of chemokine each have a single known member: fractalkine for the C X3C class and lymphotactin for the C class (11Bazan J.F. Bacon K.B. Hardiman G. Wang W. Rossi D.

Three-dimensional structures determined for a variety of chemokines have revealed a conserved, disulfide-stabilized chemokine fold that consists of a three-stranded antiparallel β-sheet and a C-terminal α-helix.

In C XC-class chemokines, the dimer interface primarily involves joining the β1-strand of each monomer to form a single six-stranded antiparallel β-sheet; by contrast, CC chemokines typically self-associate through an additional β-strand (β0) in the N terminus of each monomer. Novel quaternary interactions have also been observed in x-ray crystal structures of fractalkine (24Hoover D.M. Mizoue L.S. Handel T.M. Lubkowski J. J. Biol.

Pauza C.D. Markley J.L. Volkman B.F. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 12486-12496Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Under these conditions, Ltn is predominantly monomeric and adopts the canonical chemokine fold; its C-terminal extension is disordered and highly mobile. NMR spectra of hLtn in the absence of NaCl acquired between 10 and 35 °C show chemical shift patterns dramatically dependent on temperature, which have been attributed to conformational heterogeneity (27Marcaurelle L.A.

Construction of a plasmid pET-3a containing a synthetic hLtn gene as a fusion with staphylococcal nuclease (SNase) was described previously, as were the expression, reconstitution, purification, and isotopic labeling ([U-15N] or [13C]hLtn) of recombinant hLtn (23Kuloğlu E.S. McCaslin D.R. Kitabwalla M. Pauza C.D. Markley J.L. Volkman B.F. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 12486-12496Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). A truncated version of the protein (residues 1–68) also was cloned into the pET-3a vector as a fusion with SNase, expressed, and purified from the inclusion bodies in the same manner as the full-length protein. A Beckman Optima XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge was used for sedimentation equilibrium experiments. Protein samples at 20, 124, and 220 μm in 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.0, containing 100 mmNaCl were dialyzed against 2 liters of the same buffer overnight at room temperature. Double-sector charcoal-filled Epon centerpieces were used with path lengths of 3 mm (for samples at 124 and 220 μm) and 12 mm (for the 20 μm sample). The concentration gradients were recorded at 280 nm every 2–3 h until gradients became superimposable. Equilibrium data were collected at 18,000, 24,000, 29,000, 33,000, and 39,000 rpm at 40 °C. At 24,000 rpm the equilibrium gradient was monitored for over 12 h and found to be stable. To test the reversibility of the gradients after equilibrium had been reached at 39,000 rpm, the rotor speed was returned to 24,000 rpm and samples allowed to equilibrate. At the end of the run, a baseline absorbance was recorded for each cell after a high speed depletion of protein from the cell (4–5 h at 52,000 rpm). The molecular weight and partial specific volume of hLtn were calculated from the amino acid sequence to be 10,254 and 0.735 ml/g, respectively. The extinction coefficient calculated from the tryptophan, tyrosine, and cystine content was 7,115m −1 cm−1 (36Pace N. Schmid F.X. Creighton T.E. Protein Structure: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1997: 253-259Google Scholar). The buffer density was measured with an Anton Paar DMA5000 density meter and found to be 0.99825 g/ml at 40 °C. A program written for Igor Pro (Wavemetrics Inc., Lake Oswego, OR) by Darrell R. McCaslin was used for the analysis of the sedimentation equilibrium data. Various models were fit to all data simultaneously, with data from the 12-mm path length cell (20 μm protein) normalized to a 3-mm path length. Models evaluated included single species, two and three species in equilibrium, and two independent non-interacting species. All models included a fitting parameter to account for the non-sedimenting baseline absorbance measured by high-speed depletion at the end of the experiment. In evaluating the fits, models yielding baselines substantially different from the measured value were taken as incorrect. The data collected at 33,000 and 39,000 rpm did not fit well to the model (monomer-dimer equilibrium) developed for the lower speed data. Although these data suggested that higher order aggregates form at the higher concentrations developed at these speeds, the data are insufficient to clarify what these species might be. The possibility of higher order, irreversible aggregation is further suggested by the nonsuperimposability of the 24,000-rpm gradients before and after equilibration at higher speeds. Because of the likelihood of the presence of these higher order aggregates, equilibrium data from the 33,000, 39,000, and 24,000 reversal were not included in the final analysis. Intrinsic fluorescence emission spectra were measured in a QuantaMaster C-60/2000 spectrofluorimeter (Photon Technologies International). Temperature was varied from 2.6 to 87.7 °C by an external circulating water bath. Sample temperatures were directly measured by a Sensortek BAT-12 digital thermometer with a thermocouple probe. Excitation was at 295 nm; all slits were set at 2 nm. Spectra were recorded at 0.5-nm intervals from 310 to 450 nm with a 1-s averaging time. Samples in a 1-cm-square cuvette contained 15 μm protein in 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.0, with and without 200 mm NaCl. Protein samples used for NMR measurements were dissolved in 90% H2O/10% D2O. All samples contained 20 mm sodium phosphate (pH 6.0), 0.05% sodium azide, and sodium chloride ranging in concentration from 0 to 200 mm. NMR spectra were collected either at NMRFAM on Bruker DMX 600 and 750 MHz spectrometers, both equipped with triple axis gradients and triple resonance probes, or at the Medical College of Wisconsin on a Bruker DRX 600 spectrometer equipped with a z axis gradient and a triple resonance cryoprobe. Chemical shifts were referenced to the methyl signal of internal 2,2-dimethylsilapentane-5-sulfonic acid (DSS) directly for1H and indirectly for 15N and 13C as prescribed by IUPAC recommendations (37Markley J.L.

Under these conditions, hLtn adopted the conserved chemokine fold consisting of three antiparallel β-strands and a C-terminal α-helix with unstructured N- (1Baggiolini M. Dewald B. Moser B. Annu.

In identifying the optimal solution conditions for the study of this structure, we observed heterogeneity in the 15N-1H HSQC spectrum of hLtn that could be modulated by temperature and salt concentration (23Kuloğlu E.S. McCaslin D.R. Kitabwalla M. Pauza C.D. Markley J.L. Volkman B.F. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 12486-12496Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), a phenomenon also described by Handel and co-workers (27Marcaurelle L.A. Mizoue L.S. Wilken J. Oldham L. Kent S.B.H. Handel T.M. Bertozzi C.R. Chem. Eur. J. 2001; 7: 1129-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). To characterize this effect, we acquired a series of NMR spectra under various salt concentrations (ranging from 0 to 200 mm NaCl) and temperatures (ranging from 10 to 45 °C). Under some solution conditions, two-dimensional 15N-1H HSQC spectra of hLtn displayed two sets of peaks corresponding to two distinct conformations. The relative populations of these peaks were highly dependent on the temperature and the ionic strength of the solution. One set of signals corresponding to the chemokine-like structure dominated at low temperature and high salt concentrations, and the other dominated at high temperature and low salt concentrations. The exchange between the two conformations was slow on the NMR timescale, as evidenced by the appearance of distinct resonances. To assess the role of the unique C-terminal extension of hLtn in promoting this conformational exchange, a truncated version including only residues 1–68 was produced, and its 15N-1H HSQC spectrum was compared with that of the full-length protein under a variety of solution conditions and temperatures. Removal of the 25 C-terminal residues had no effect on the temperature- and ionic strength-dependent conformational exchange, indicating that the unstructured C terminus of hLtn is not responsible for its unusual structural heterogeneity. An overlay of 15N-1H HSQC spectra of hLtn collected at 10 °C with 200 mm NaCl and at 45 °C with 0 mm NaCl is shown in Fig. 1with sequence-specific resonance assignments indicated for the 45 °C spectrum. The patterns of signals for the low temperature/high salt species (Fig. 1, red peaks) and the high temperature/low salt species (Fig. 1, black peaks) are strikingly different, consistent with a major structural change. The stability of this novel high temperature/low salt conformation against thermal denaturation was demonstrated by a series of one-dimensional 1H spectra acquired from 45 to 75 °C that displayed the same pattern of amide1HN signals over the entire range (data not shown). Fig. 2 shows the changes in the high frequency region of the two-dimensional 15N-1H HSQC spectrum of hLtn as a result of varying salt concentrations and temperatures. At 10 °C in the presence of 200 mm NaCl, hLtn adopted one conformation corresponding to the chemokine-like fold (panel A). As the temperature was increased from 10 to 25 °C, a new set of signals appeared in the spectrum (panel B). Comparison of the spectra in panels B and C, both collected at 25 °C with and without 200 mm NaCl, clearly shows the effect of ionic strength on hLtn conformation. At 25 °C in the presence of 200 mm NaCl, signals from the chemokine-like conformation are stronger, whereas in the absence of salt, the new set of peaks is predominant. Under low salt conditions, a temperature increase from 25 to 45 °C shifted the equilibrium farther, as illustrated by the complete lack of low temperature signals in Fig. 2 D. For convenience, the two human lymphotactin species will be referred to henceforth as hLtn10 (chemokine-like conformation, 10 °C, 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.0, 200 mm NaCl) and hLtn45 (45 °C, 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.0, 0 mm NaCl). In order to estimate the relative populations of each hLtn conformation near physiologically relevant conditions, a two-dimensional15N-1H HSQC spectrum was collected at 37 °C in the presence of 200 mm NaCl. Quantitative analysis of peak volumes for 12 residues displaying well resolved signals for both hLtn10 and hLtn45 conformations indicated that the two species are present in nearly equal amounts (46% Ltn10, 54% Ltn45). To investigate the temperature- and salt-dependent structural changes in more detail, chemical shift assignments were obtained for the hLtn45 species. Complete 1H, 15N, and 13C resonance assignments and the three-dimensional structure of hLtn10 have been reported previously (BioMagResBank (BMRB) accession code 5240; PDB entries 1J9O and 1J8I). Backbone resonance assignments for hLtn45 were made on the basis of the following three-dimensional triple resonance experiments: HNCA, HN(CO)CA, HNCO, C(CO)NH, 15N TOCSY-HSQC, and 15N NOESY-HSQC. The two-dimensional15N-1H HSQC spectrum was used as a reference to correlate each cross-peak to its corresponding amide1HN and 15N in each three-dimensional spectrum. The sequential connections obtained mainly from HNCA and HN(CO)CA experiments were confirmed by the analysis of NOE patterns from 15N NOESY-HSQC spectra. The C(CO)NH experiment provided assignments for aliphatic 13C resonances. Aliphatic side chain 1H assignments were obtained f"

To elucidate the role of G-CSF in controlling hematopoietic cell migration capabilities, we studied inducible expression of the myeloid-specific marker, integrin αMβ2 (CD11b/CD18, Mac-1), in the myeloid cell line, 32D. We found that G-CSF stimulates the synthesis and cell surface expression of αM and β2integrin subunits. Induction of both αM and β2 is dependent on Stat3, a major G-CSF-responsive signaling protein. However, the kinetics of expression suggested the involvement of an intermediate protein regulated by Stat3. Our results demonstrate that Stat3 signaling stimulates the expression of PU.1, a critical regulator of myelopoiesis. Furthermore, we show that PU.1 is an essential intermediate for the inducible expression of αMβ2 integrin. Thus, Stat3 promotes αMβ2 integrin expression through its activation of PU.1. These findings indicate that G-CSF-dependent Stat3 signals stimulate the changes in cell adhesion and migration capabilities that occur during myeloid cell development. These data also demonstrate a link between Stat3 and PU.1, suggesting that Stat3 may play an instructive role in hematopoiesis.

Clinically, G-CSF is used to treat neutropenia due to bone marrow suppression and to mobilize hematopoietic progenitor cells to the peripheral circulation, facilitating their collection for bone marrow transplants (4Duhrsen U.

Mice deficient in the G-CSF receptor (G-CSFR) gene (G-CSFR-null) or mice expressing a chimeric G-CSFR/erythropoietin receptor (GE) are severely neutropenic, with ∼12% of the normal level of circulating neutrophils. However, these animals display significant levels of bone marrow granulopoiesis (50–70% of the normal level) (2Liu F. Wu H.Y. Wesselschmidt R. Kornaga T. Link D.C.

Immunity. 1999; 11: 153-161Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Knock-in studies with truncated G-CSFR isoforms suggest a function for Stat3, a major G-CSF-responsive signaling molecule, in the formation of circulating neutrophils (6McLemore M.L.

Thus, G-CSFR signals through Stat3 may be essential for differentiation events that render neutrophils competent to exit the bone marrow and enter the peripheral circulation.Bone marrow neutrophils from G-CSFR-null animals appear morphologically mature, although they are not fully functional, demonstrating defective chemotaxis in response to inflammatory mediators, reduced adhesion through β2 integrins, and impaired migration in vivo (8Betsuyaku T.

These results support the conclusion that G-CSFR-specific signals are essential for complete neutrophil differentiation as well as the idea that neutrophil development is associated with alterations in cell adhesion and migration capabilities.In addition to G-CSF, several transcription factors play key functions in granulopoiesis, including members of the C/EBP family (e.g. C/EBPα and C/EBPε) and the Ets-related protein PU.1 (11Tenen D.G. Hromas R. Licht J.D. Zhang D.E. Blood. 1997; 90: 489-519Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Deletion of PU.1 in mice abrogates myeloid and B cell development (12McKercher S.R. Torbett B.E. Anderson K.L. Henkel G.W. Vestal D.J. Baribault H. Klemsz M. Feeney A.J. Wu G.E. Paige C.J. Maki R.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5647-5658Crossref PubMed Scopus (919) Google Scholar, 13Scott E.W. Simon M.C. Anastasi J. Singh H. Science. 1994; 265: 1573-1577Crossref PubMed Scopus (1271) Google Scholar). In myeloid cells, this block is due in part to the fact that PU.1 controls cytokine responsiveness by regulating expression of cytokine receptors, such as macrophage colony-stimulating factor receptor (14DeKoter R.P. Walsh J.C. Singh H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4456-4468Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). However, enforced expression of the macrophage colony-stimulating factor receptor in primary PU.1-null progenitors restores M-CSF-dependent proliferation but not macrophage development. In the granulocytic lineage, transient stimulation with multilineage cytokines can overcome the block in G-CSF-responsiveness in PU.1-null progenitors, although further neutrophil development is attenuated. Studies in the PU.1-null cell line, 503, have demonstrated that PU.1 is required for the expression of specific myeloid marker proteins such as neutrophil collagenase and gelatinase, whereas cytokines appear to provide a permissive signal for cell survival and growth (15Anderson K.L. Smith K.A. Perkin H. Hermanson G. Anderson C.-G. Jolly D.J. Maki R.A. Torbett B.E. Blood. 1999; 94: 2310-2318Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Collectively, these results indicate that PU.1 regulates genes that control terminal myeloid cell development, in addition to its regulation of cytokine-responsiveness (14DeKoter R.P. Walsh J.C. Singh H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4456-4468Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 15Anderson K.L. Smith K.A. Perkin H. Hermanson G. Anderson C.-G. Jolly D.J. Maki R.A. Torbett B.E. Blood. 1999; 94: 2310-2318Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PU.1 is also required for cell surface expression of several integrin subunits (e.g. α4, α5, αM) and PU.1-null cells demonstrate impaired homing and migration in vivo (16Fisher R.C. Lovelock J.D. Scott E.W. Blood. 1999; 94: 1283-1290Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Since G-CSFR-dependent neutrophil development is associated with changes in cell adhesion and migration capabilities, we set out to determine whether G-CSFR-specific signals regulate expression of the myeloid-specific integrin αMβ2. Our results show that G-CSF stimulates increased synthesis and cell surface expression of αM and β2 integrin subunits. Studies with a chimeric erythropoietin receptor, engineered to specifically activate Stat3 in place of Stat5, or use of a dominant inhibitory Stat3 isoform demonstrated a requirement for Stat3 in αMβ2 induction. However, the kinetics of αM and β2 expression suggested that an intermediate signal is involved. We found that G-CSF stimulates the expression of PU.1 by a Stat3-dependent mechanism. Moreover, we show that inducible expression of αMβ2 requires functional PU.1, demonstrating that PU.1 is a critical intermediate in cytokine-responsive αMβ2 synthesis. Collectively our results suggest that Stat3 signaling provides an instructive function by stimulating PU.1, thereby promoting myeloid cell development and the concomitant induction of proteins that regulate cell adhesion and trafficking functions.DISCUSSIONOur studies make several novel contributions to understanding the function of cytokines in hematopoietic cells. Through the use of both loss-of-function and gain-of-function experimental approaches, we have demonstrated that a cytokine-responsive Stat protein plays a critical role in regulating the expression of a transcription factor that controls hematopoietic lineage specification. Our observation that Stat3 signaling promotes PU.1 expression and activation suggests that Stat3 may play an instructive role in hematopoiesis. Second, we have shown that Stat3 signaling leads to induction of the myeloid marker protein, αMβ2 integrin, demonstrating that cytokine-responsive signaling pathways can regulate the changes in cell adhesion and migration capabilities that are associated with myeloid cell development.Regulation of myeloid marker protein expression in response to G-CSF has been shown to involve both Stat3-dependent and Stat3-independent pathways. For example, induction of myeloperoxidase and C/EBPε is mediated by Stat3-independent signals emanating from the G-CSFR (30Shimozaki K. Nakajima K. Hirano T. Nagata S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25184-25189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 29Nakajima H. Ihle J.N. Blood. 2001; 98: 897-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In contrast, G-CSFR-dependent cell cycle arrest and induction of p27Kip1 is dependent on functional Stat3 (31de Koning J.P. Soede-Bobok A.A. Ward A.C. Schelen A.M. Antonissen C. van Leeuwen D. Lowenberg B. Touw I.P. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 3290-3298Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The work described herein demonstrates that a Stat3-dependent pathway stimulates PU.1 expression, leading to induction of expression of the myeloid-specific integrin αMβ2 (i.e. Mac-1). Previously, we have shown that a Stat3-dependent pathway controls induction of β2 integrin function in 32D cells (20Wooten D.K. Xie X. Bartos D. Busche R.A. Longmore G.D. Watowich S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26566-26575Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Thus, collectively, these studies indicate that Stat3 regulates cell cycle progression and alterations in cell migratory capabilities during myeloid development.It is interesting to note that G-CSF-induced expression of critical myeloid cell transcription factors can be controlled by Stat3-dependent or Stat3-independent (e.g. PU.1 and C/EBPε, respectively) pathways. Furthermore, enforced expression of PU.1, C/EBPα, or C/EBPε in myeloid cell lines can promote differentiation, as judged by morphological alterations and analysis of specific marker proteins (15Anderson K.L. Smith K.A. Perkin H. Hermanson G. Anderson C.-G. Jolly D.J. Maki R.A. Torbett B.E. Blood. 1999; 94: 2310-2318Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Nakajima H. Ihle J.N. Blood. 2001; 98: 897-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 32Wang X. Scott E. Sawyers C.L. Friedman A.D. Blood. 1999; 94: 560-571Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, redundant signaling pathways from the G-CSFR may promote myeloid development, similar to the observations of functional redundancy among EpoR-responsive signaling pathways controlling erythropoiesis (33Goldsmith M.A. Mikami A. You Y. Liu K.D. Thomas L. Pharr P. Longmore G.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7006-7011Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 34Longmore G.D. You Y. Molden J. Liu K.D. Mikami A. Lai S.Y. Pharr P. Goldsmith M.A. Blood. 1998; 91: 870-878Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Studies of mice with targeted mutations at the G-CSFR locus have indicated that G-CSFR-specific signals are essential for the production of fully mature, circulating neutrophils (3Semerad C.L. Poursine-Laurent J. Liu F. Link D.C. Immunity. 1999; 11: 153-161Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 7McLemore M.L. Grewal S. Liu F. Archambault A. Poursine-Laurent J. Haug J. Link D.C. Immunity. 2001; 14: 193-204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). For example, signaling through the EpoR intracellular region fails to support the production of normal levels of circulating neutrophils in GE/GE mice, although near normal levels of granulocytes are found in the bone marrow (3Semerad C.L. Poursine-Laurent J. Liu F. Link D.C. Immunity. 1999; 11: 153-161Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). A similar phenotype is found in G-CSFR d715F mice, which have impaired activation of Stat3 in response to G-CSF (7McLemore M.L. Grewal S. Liu F. Archambault A. Poursine-Laurent J. Haug J. Link D.C. Immunity. 2001; 14: 193-204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). One interpretation of these data is that Stat3 is specifically required for G-CSF to activate the expression of proteins that control neutrophil migration from the bone marrow. However, bone marrow neutrophils from G-CSFR-null mice also exhibit several defects in mature cell functions, including impaired adhesion through β2 integrins, lack of chemotaxis in response to inflammatory mediators, and failure to migrate in vivo (8Betsuyaku T. Liu F. Senior R.M. Haug J.S. Brown E.J. Jones S.L. Matsushima K. Link D.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 825-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Therefore, the data indicate that G-CSFR-specific signals are required for complete neutrophil development, including changes in cell adhesion and migration capabilities. Our observation that G-CSFR-dependent Stat3 signals are required for induction of αMβ2expression (this study) and β2 integrin function (20Wooten D.K. Xie X. Bartos D. Busche R.A. Longmore G.D. Watowich S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26566-26575Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) provides support for this concept. Future studies will test this by evaluating the adhesion and migration abilities of myeloid cells isolated from mice with targeted mutations in the G-CSFR.In agreement with previous studies (7McLemore M.L. Grewal S. Liu F. Archambault A. Poursine-Laurent J. Haug J. Link D.C. Immunity. 2001; 14: 193-204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 30Shimozaki K. Nakajima K. Hirano T. Nagata S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25184-25189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), our results suggest an important function for Stat3 in granulocytic development. This was shown in two ways, through the use of Stat3-DN, which blocked G-CSFR-induced maturation, and by ER-S3, which promoted granulocytic differentiation. Differentiation of ER-S3 cells was judged by the analysis of myeloid marker protein expression (e.g.αMβ2) and by changes in cell morphology observed during granulopoiesis. Epo-treated ER-S3 cells demonstrate a morphology that is similar to granulocytes at the myelocyte/metamyelocyte stage, whereas ER-S3 cells maintained in IL-3-containing medium appear as immature myeloblasts. Therefore, ER-S3 signaling promotes granulocytic development through a Stat3-dependent mechanism.However, the precise role of Stat3 in hematopoiesis in vivo remains unclear. Deletion of the Stat3 gene leads to early embryonic lethality (35Takeda K. Noguchi K. Shi W. Tanaka T. Matsumoto M. Yoshida N. Kishimoto T. Akira S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3801-3804Crossref PubMed Scopus (1088) Google Scholar); thus, its role in hematopoiesis could not be evaluated. Conditional deletion of Stat3 has been achieved in neutrophils and macrophages through use of the Cre/Lox system (36Takeda K. Clausen B.E. Kaisho T. Tsujimura T. Terada N. Forster I. Akira S. Immunity. 1999; 10: 39-49Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1021) Google Scholar). In this model, the LysMcre/Stat3flox/− mice, cre recombinase expression is driven from the murine lysozyme M locus. Mature neutrophils and macrophages are found in LysMcre/Stat3flox/− mice, leading to the assumption that Stat3 function may be dispensable for myelopoiesis. Stat3-null leukocytes demonstrate impaired responses to IL-10, with overproduction of inflammatory mediators, and LysMcre/Stat3flox/− mice develop chronic enterocolitis, indicating that Stat3 target genes are critical for inflammatory cell deactivation (36Takeda K. Clausen B.E. Kaisho T. Tsujimura T. Terada N. Forster I. Akira S. Immunity. 1999; 10: 39-49Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1021) Google Scholar).However, it is equally possible that the Stat3 gene deletion occurs in the LysMcre/Stat3flox/− mice at a late stage of myeloid development, and progress through earlier developmental stages may require Stat3. Recently, a mouse model was developed in which enhanced green fluorescent protein expression was driven from the lysozyme M locus (37Faust N. Varas F. Kelly L.M. Graf T. Blood. 2000; 96: 719-726Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As expected, mature neutrophils and monocytes exhibited high enhanced green fluorescent protein expression. However, the majority of immature myeloid cells in the bone marrow showed only weak enhanced green fluorescent protein expression. In addition, enhanced green fluorescent protein-positive cells expressed αMβ2, demonstrating that induction of αMβ2 is concomitant with or precedes expression from the lysozyme M locus during myelopoiesis (37Faust N. Varas F. Kelly L.M. Graf T. Blood. 2000; 96: 719-726Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These data indicate that expression from the lysozyme M locus occurs primarily in mature neutrophils and monocytes and not in cells at earlier stages of development. This supports the idea that cre expression in LysMcre/Stat3flox/− mice occurs at late stages of myelopoiesis. Therefore, targeted deletion of Stat3 in an early hematopoietic progenitor cell is required to fully evaluate the functional role of Stat3 in myeloid cell development.Our studies provide new insight into the regulatory pathways that control PU.1, demonstrating that cytokine signals through Stat3 stimulate PU.1 expression and activation. The precise mechanisms involved in PU.1 regulation are not yet understood. PU.1 mRNA levels are induced by G-CSFR or ER-S3 signaling, suggesting that PU.1 is regulated transcriptionally by cytokines. In fact, the proximal portion of the murine PU.1 promoter (∼400 bp) contains two weak consensus Stat binding sites (e.g. TTN5AA) (21Chen H. Ray-Gallet D. Zhang P. Hetherington C.J. Gonzalez D.A. Zhang D.E. Moreau-Gachelin F. Tenen D.G. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 1549-1560PubMed Google Scholar), and current studies are directed at testing their function in cytokine-inducible PU.1 expression. However, a recent study has demonstrated that distal elements also play an important role in PU.1 regulation, and myeloid-specific expression can be conferred by a 3.5-kb genomic fragment located ∼14 kb upstream of the transcriptional start site (38Li Y. Okuno Y. Zhang P. Radomska H.S. Chen H. Iwasaki H. Akashi K. Klemsz M.J. McKercher S.R. Maki R.A. Tenen D.G. Blood. 2001; 98: 2958-2965Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). In addition, PU.1 has been shown to regulate its own expression in myeloid cells through a PU.1 consensus binding site in the proximal promoter (21Chen H. Ray-Gallet D. Zhang P. Hetherington C.J. Gonzalez D.A. Zhang D.E. Moreau-Gachelin F. Tenen D.G. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 1549-1560PubMed Google Scholar), and our work suggests that cytokines might activate a PU.1 autoregulatory loop, as evidenced by the requirement for the PU.1 transactivation domain in cytokine-stimulated induction. Furthermore, conditionally active C/EBPα stimulates induction of PU.1 in myeloid cells (32Wang X. Scott E. Sawyers C.L. Friedman A.D. Blood. 1999; 94: 560-571Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, myeloid-specific PU.1 regulation is complex and is mediated through distinct DNA elements and transacting factors. Stat3 may be involved by activating the PU.1 promoter through an upstream element, or Stat3 may stimulate a transactivating factor that directly controls PU.1 gene transcription. Further analysis of cytokine-inducible PU.1 gene regulation is required to distinguish between these possibilities. Nonetheless, our results provide an explanation for the observation that PU.1 levels are induced during cytokine-stimulated myeloid development (39Cheng T. Shen H. Giokas D. Gere J. Tenen D.G. Scadden D.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13158-13163Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) and indicate a critical role for Stat3.Recent work has shown that normal hematopoiesis is dependent on the tight and appropriate regulation of PU.1. For example, myelopoiesis requires high PU.1 expression, which may involve the activation of a PU.1 autoregulatory loop, while B cell development requires only low levels of PU.1 (21Chen H. Ray-Gallet D. Zhang P. Hetherington C.J. Gonzalez D.A. Zhang D.E. Moreau-Gachelin F. Tenen D.G. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 1549-1560PubMed Google Scholar, 40DeKoter R.P. Singh H. Science. 2000; 288: 1439-1441Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar). In addition, PU.1 can antagonize erythroid development by blocking the activity of GATA-1 (41Rekhtman N. Radparvar F. Evans T. Skoultchi A.I. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1398-1411Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). Therefore, in light of previous findings, our work suggests that cytokine-activated expression of PU.1 may be required to induce a threshold level of PU.1 necessary to promote complete granulocytic development and the concomitant alterations in cell adhesion and migration capabilities.

Immunity. 1999; 11: 153-161Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Clinically, G-CSF is used to treat neutropenia due to bone marrow suppression and to mobilize hematopoietic progenitor cells to the peripheral circulation, facilitating their collection for bone marrow transplants (4Duhrsen U. Villeval J.-L. Boyd J. Kannourakis G. Morstyn G. Metcalf D. Blood. 1988; 72: 2074-2081Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Welte K. Gabrilove J. Bronchud M.H. Platzer E. Morstyn G. Blood. 1996; 88: 1907-1929Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mice deficient in the G-CSF receptor (G-CSFR) gene (G-CSFR-null) or mice expressing a chimeric G-CSFR/erythropoietin receptor (GE) are severely neutropenic, with ∼12% of the normal level of circulating neutrophils. However, these animals display significant levels of bone marrow granulopoiesis (50–70% of the normal level) (2Liu F. Wu H.Y. Wesselschmidt R. Kornaga T. Link D.C.

Immunity. 1999; 11: 153-161Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Knock-in studies with truncated G-CSFR isoforms suggest a function for Stat3, a major G-CSF-responsive signaling molecule, in the formation of circulating neutrophils (6McLemore M.L.

Thus, G-CSFR signals through Stat3 may be essential for differentiation events that render neutrophils competent to exit the bone marrow and enter the peripheral circulation. granulocyte colony-stimulating factor G-CSF receptor G-CSFR/erythropoietin receptor interleukin-3 wild type CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein fetal calf serum granulocyte colony-stimulating factor G-CSF receptor G-CSFR/erythropoietin receptor interleukin-3 wild type CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein fetal calf serum Bone marrow neutrophils from G-CSFR-null animals appear morphologically mature, although they are not fully functional, demonstrating defective chemotaxis in response to inflammatory mediators, reduced adhesion through β2 integrins, and impaired migration in vivo (8Betsuyaku T.

G-CSF-induced mobilization of hematopoietic progenitor cells, which appears to require degranulation of bone marrow neutrophils and concomitant protease secretion (9Levesque J.-P. Takamatsu Y.

These results support the conclusion that G-CSFR-specific signals are essential for complete neutrophil differentiation as well as the idea that neutrophil development is associated with alterations in cell adhesion and migration capabilities. In addition to G-CSF, several transcription factors play key functions in granulopoiesis, including members of the C/EBP family (e.g. C/EBPα and C/EBPε) and the Ets-related protein PU.1 (11Tenen D.G. Hromas R. Licht J.D. Zhang D.E. Blood. 1997; 90: 489-519Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Deletion of PU.1 in mice abrogates myeloid and B cell development (12McKercher S.R. Torbett B.E. Anderson K.L. Henkel G.W. Vestal D.J. Baribault H. Klemsz M. Feeney A.J. Wu G.E. Paige C.J. Maki R.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5647-5658Crossref PubMed Scopus (919) Google Scholar, 13Scott E.W. Simon M.C. Anastasi J. Singh H. Science. 1994; 265: 1573-1577Crossref PubMed Scopus (1271) Google Scholar). In myeloid cells, this block is due in part to the fact that PU.1 controls cytokine responsiveness by regulating expression of cytokine receptors, such as macrophage colony-stimulating factor receptor (14DeKoter R.P. Walsh J.C. Singh H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4456-4468Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). However, enforced expression of the macrophage colony-stimulating factor receptor in primary PU.1-null progenitors restores M-CSF-dependent proliferation but not macrophage development. In the granulocytic lineage, transient stimulation with multilineage cytokines can overcome the block in G-CSF-responsiveness in PU.1-null progenitors, although further neutrophil development is attenuated. Studies in the PU.1-null cell line, 503, have demonstrated that PU.1 is required for the expression of specific myeloid marker proteins such as neutrophil collagenase and gelatinase, whereas cytokines appear to provide a permissive signal for c"

This limitation may be circumvented by the use of tissue-specific promoters. Li et al. (24Li J. Dressman D. Tsao Y.P. Sakamoto A. Hoffman E.P. Xiao X.

In addition, liver-, brain-, cancer-, and rod-specific expression has been accomplished using the tissue-specific albumin, enolase, calcitonin, and rod opsin promoters, respectively (25Su H., Lu, R.

Among the isoforms encoded by the multigene myosin heavy chain (MHC) family, only the α- and β-MHC isoforms are expressed in cardiomyocytes (29Gulick J. Subramaniam A. Neumann J. Robbins J. J. Biol.

In late fetal life of mice, α-MHC is expressed in the atria while β-MHC is expressed in the developing ventricles. After birth, α-MHC becomes the predominant isoform expressed in mouse ventricles (29Gulick J. Subramaniam A. Neumann J. Robbins J. J. Biol.

Cell culture studies have demonstrated three different regions within the proximal α-MHC promoter that regulate cardiomyocyte-specific expression (31Morkin E. Microsc. Res. Tech. 2000; 50: 522-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 32Molkentin J.D. Jobe S.M. Markham B.E. J. Mol. Cell.

First, deletion analysis has demonstrated that α-MHC promoter nucleotide −344 is the 5′-boundary of sequences required for high level expression in cardiomyocytes (32Molkentin J.D. Jobe S.M. Markham B.E. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1996; 28: 1211-1225Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Second, a 30-bp purine-rich negative regulatory (PNR) element was identified in the first intron, between +66 and +96 bp, that is important for cardiomyocyte-specific expression (33Gupta M. Zak R. Libermann T.A. Gupta M.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7243-7258Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, within the α-MHC promoter a cardiac-specific enhancer spanning bases −344 to −156 was found to direct high level cardiomyocyte-specific expression with a heterologous promoter (32Molkentin J.D. Jobe S.M. Markham B.E. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1996; 28: 1211-1225Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). These elements were characterized in vitro, which may not faithfully model expression patterns in vivo. Therefore, in addition to developing a vector for cardiac-specific gene therapy, a goal of this project was to develop the use of somatic gene transfer by rAAV as an alternative to germ-line transgenesis for characterizing long term promoter function in vivo. Stimulation of tissues with trophic hormones may improve diverse organ-specific processes of aging and atrophy. One such protein, human growth hormone (hGH), is a candidate gene for treatment of dilated cardiomyopathy, because clinical and animal studies have indicated that long term administration of hGH may beneficially impact weakened cardiomyocytes (34Fazio S. Sabatini D. Capaldo B. Vigorito C. Giordano A. Guida R. Pardo F. Biondi B. Sacca L. N. Engl. J. Med. 1996; 334: 809-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar, 35Genth-Zotz S. Zotz R. Geil S.

Ross J., Jr. Basic Res. Cardiol. 2000; 95: 431-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In these clinical studies, hGH protein was administered systemically, but local production of therapeutic secretable proteins by rAAV may produce higher concentrations in the target organ with fewer systemic side effects and greater therapeutic benefits. As an initial step to advance this approach, we made a panel of rAAV vectors expressing hGH under the control of a cardiac-specific promoter, and here we report the pharmacokinetic properties of delivering a potentially therapeutic gene to the heart. For these studies we cloned fragments of the α-MHC promoter (−344 to +19), a larger promoter fragment containing the PNR (−344 to +119), or the α-MHC enhancer (−344 to −156) together with a heterologous promoter to control transgene expression. The strength and specificity of these α-MHC gene promoter elements in rAAV were validated in vivo, and we demonstrate rAAV-MHC-mediated long term cardiac expression of both marker and therapeutic genes with low cytotoxicity. Using primers listed in Table I, promoter fragments were amplified by PCR from the murine α-MHC gene, kindly provided by Dr. Jeffrey Robbins (GenBankTM accession number U71441, University of Cincinnati, College of Medicine, Cincinnati, OH), and they replaced the CMV enhancer/promoter (−582 to +75) between the SpeI and Nar1 sites of pAAV-CMV-lacZ (37Mathews L.C. Gallagher M.R. Gray J.T. Snyder R.O. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 346: 393-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). For rAAV-MHC-E vectors the minimal CMV promoter (−53 to +75) was ligated to the α-MHC enhancer (−344 to −156). Each construct was verified by DNA sequencing.Table IOligonucleotide sequencesPrimer nameOligonucleotide sequenceα-MHC −3445-CCACTAGTCCAGTTTGTTCAACTCACCC-3α-MHC −1565-CCAAGCTTCAGGGCCCCAAGGTTTGC-3α-MHC +195-AAGGCGCCATGGTGGCGAATTCGGGTTGGAGAAATCTCTG-3α-MHC +1195-AAGGCGCCATGGTGGCGAATTCTGACCGGCCTGAACCCCA-3min CMV −535-CCAAGCTTGGGCGGTAGGCGTGTACG-3min CMV +755-AAGGCGCCATGGTGGCGAATTCCAGCTTCGAGGGGAGGC-3′ Open table in a new tab rAAV vectors were prepared as described previously (16Snyder R.O. Miao C.H. Patijn G.A. Spratt S.K. Danos O. Nagy D. Gown A.M. Winther B. Meuse L. Cohen L.K. Thompson A.R. Kay M.A. Nat. Genet. 1997; 16: 270-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). Briefly, subconfluent 293 cells were co-transfected with vector plasmid and pLTAAVhelp using calcium phosphate (37Mathews L.C. Gallagher M.R. Gray J.T. Snyder R.O. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 346: 393-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Cells were then infected with adenovirus Ad5dl312 (an E1A-deletion mutant) at a multiplicity of infection of 2, and after 72 h the cells were harvested, lysed by three freeze/thaw cycles, Ad was heat-inactivated, and the rAAV virions were purified by cesium chloride gradients. The gradient fractions containing rAAV were dialyzed against sterile PBS, and stored at −80 °C. Dot blot analysis demonstrated particle titers of 1∼2 × 1012/ml. The E1A-deleted rAd-lacZ vector was prepared as described (38Hardy S. Kitamura M. Harris-Stansil T. Dai Y. Phipps M.L. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 1842-1849Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Primary neonatal rat cardiomyocytes were prepared and maintained as described (39Aikawa R. Komuro I. Yamazaki T. Zou Y. Kudoh S. Tanaka M. Shiojima I. Hiroi Y. Yazaki Y. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 1813-1821Crossref PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar). HeLa, 293, C2C12, and smooth muscle cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone) and gentamicin in a humidified atmosphere at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Approximately 24 h after seeding, vector was added directly to the medium of 1 × 106 cells plated in each well of a six-well plate. Neonatal rat cardiomyocytes grown on coverslips were infected with rAAV. 7 days later, the cells were washed in PBS, fixed in 0.25% glutaraldehyde and 2% formaldehyde, washed with PBS, and probed with an α-tropomyosin antibody (Sigma Chemical Co.). After washing, goat anti-mouse IgG Alexa 594 (Molecular Probes) was applied for 1 h. Nuclear staining for DNA fragmentation was performed by the terminal deoxynucleotide transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) method (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Cells were observed using a Nikon Optiphot-2 light microscope, and images were recorded using a Spot (Diagnostic Instruments, Inc.) digital camera. 100 cardiomyocytes were counted, and the means ± S.E. percentage of TUNEL-positive cells was determined in four independent experiments. For cytoplasmic DNA cleavage assays, DNA preparation and agarose gel electrophoresis were performed essentially as described (39Aikawa R. Komuro I. Yamazaki T. Zou Y. Kudoh S. Tanaka M. Shiojima I. Hiroi Y. Yazaki Y. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 1813-1821Crossref PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar). Animal care and surgery were performed according to Harvard Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee guidelines and approval, and mice were housed under conventional conditions. 5- to 7-week old ICR mice (Taconic) were anesthetized by injection of ketamine/xylazine and/or inhalation of methoxyfluran (Metofane, Janssen BmbH) before direct injection of rAAV. Using a 30-gauge needle, 50 μl, containing 5 × 1010particles of the rAAV-lacZ vectors, was injected into liver or left ventricular wall, through the diaphragm, following laparotomy. Injection with the same dose of vectors into the quadriceps femoris was performed accordingly. In addition, 10 μl, containing 1 × 1010 particles of the rAAV-lacZ vectors were injected slowly into the forebrain. The rAAV-hGH vectors were injected into the left ventricular wall of a second group of adult mice. To inject rAAV-hGH vectors directly into mouse myocardium the respiration of anesthetized mice was controlled using a Dwyer SAR-830 small animal ventilator. Through a thoracotomy incision, the heart was exposed, and under direct visualization injected with 50 μl containing 1 × 1011 particles of rAAV-hGH vectors. Afterward the chest cavity was closed, and the mice were allowed to recover. For detection of β-galactosidase activity, freshly excised tissues were fixed in O.C.T. compound (Sakura), flash-frozen, and 16-mm sections were collected on glass slides. These slides were fixed by using 0.25% glutaraldehyde and 2% formaldehyde, washed with PBS, stained overnight with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-iodolyl-beta-d-galactopyranoside (X-gal) as described (15Snyder R.O. Spratt S.K. Lagarde C. Bohl D. Kaspar B. Sloan B. Cohen L.K. Danos O. Hum. Gene Ther. 1997; 8: 1891-1900Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). The sections were then washed in PBS and counterstained with Nuclear Fast Red. Total DNA was extracted from tissues using the Puregene DNA isolation kit (Gentra Systems). PCR was used to amplify a 268-bp fragment of the β-galactosidase gene using sense 5′-TCAATCCGCCGTTTGTTCCC-3′ and antisense 5′-TCCAGATAACTGCCGTCACTCC-3′ primers. Blood samples were taken from the retro-orbital vein of anesthetized mice, and the plasma hGH concentrations were determined by ELISA (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). All results were expressed as means ± S.E. For multiple treatment groups, a factorial analysis of variance was applied followed by Fisher's least significant difference test. A p value of less than 0.05 was considered significant. The structures of the recombinant vectors rAAV-MHC-PNR, rAAV-MHC-P, rAAV-MHC-E, and rAAV-CMV, used in this study, are shown in Fig. 1 A. For the rAAV-MHC-PNR and rAAV-MHC-P vectors expression of the transgene is controlled by the α-MHC enhancer/promoter sequences (−344 to +119) and (−344 to +19), respectively. In the rAAV-MHC-E vector, expression of the transgene is controlled by the α-MHC enhancer (−344 to −156) coupled to the minimal CMV promoter (40Gossen M. Bujard H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5547-5551Crossref PubMed Scopus (4232) Google Scholar, 41Rendahl K.G. Leff S.E. Otten G.R. Spratt S.K. Bohl D. Van Roey M. Donahue B.A. Cohen L.K. Mandel R.J. Danos O. Snyder R.O. Nat. Biotechnol. 1998; 16: 757-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). As a control for non-tissue-restricted expression, a rAAV-CMV vector with the constitutively active CMV promoter/enhancer was used (37Mathews L.C. Gallagher M.R. Gray J.T. Snyder R.O. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 346: 393-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). First, to examine the potency and kinetics of gene expression in cardiomyocytes, 1 × 106 cardiomyocytes were infected with 1 × 109 viral particles. β-Galactosidase expression was first detected 1 day after infection, and rapidly increased during days 3–7, peaked at day 10, and reached a plateau at day 14 (Fig. 1 B). To determine the optimal multiplicity of infection 1 × 106 cardiomyocytes were infected with increasing amounts of rAAV, and after 7 days the cells were stained for β-galactosidase activity. The number of β-galactosidase-positive cells infected by the rAAV-MHC vectors demonstrated a dose-dependent effect in the range from 5 × 101 to 5 × 104 particles/cell (Fig. 1 C). A similar threshold effect was observed using rAAV-CMV increased markedly between the range of 1 × 101 to 1 × 104particles/cell (data not shown). We tested the specificity of rAAV-MHC-mediated β-galactosidase expression in 293 (human embryonic kidney cell line), HeLa (human cervical carcinoma cell line), rat aortic smooth muscle cells (SMC) and C2C12 (mouse myoblast cell line). 293 cells and HeLa cells were stained 3 days after infection with 1 × 109 particles, whereas SMC, C2C12 cells, and cardiomyocytes were stained after 7 days, which for each cell type was the peak of their expression. As shown in Fig. 2 A, rAAV-CMV vector-infected cells showed robust β-galactosidase staining in every cell line, whereas the rAAV-MHC vectors produced few positive cells in the non-cardiomyocyte cell lines (Fig. 2 A). All three rAAV-MHC vectors produced β-galactosidase in cardiomyocytes (Fig. 2,A and B). Although rAAV-CMV produced a greater number of positive 293 and HeLa compared with cardiomyocytes, the rAAV-MHC vector produced a far greater number of positive cardiomyocytes than all other cell lines (Fig. 2 A). Of the three rAAV-MHC vectors, the rAAV-MHC-PNR vector produced the lowest number of β-galactosidase-positive cardiomyocytes (Figs.1 B, 2 A, and 2 B). Although rAAV-CMV produced similar numbers of β-galactosidase-positive C2C12 cells as cardiomyocytes, rAAV-MHC-E, rAAV-MHC-P, or rAAV-MHC-PNR produced about 47-, 80-, and 93-fold more X-gal-positive cardiomyocytes than C2C12 cells, respectively (Fig. 2 A). To confirm transgene expression of rAAV-MHC vectors in cardiomyocytes, but not cardiac fibroblasts, which are co-isolated from neonatal rat hearts, we stained infected cells for both β-galactosidase activity and the muscle sarcomeric protein tropomyosin. Expression of β-galactosidase using the rAAV-MHC vectors was mostly restricted to cardiomyocytes (Fig. 2 C), whereas the rAAV-CMV vector expressed β-galactosidase in both cardiomyocytes and non-myocytes (Fig. 2 C, top). These results demonstrate that the rAAV-MHC vectors express preferentially in cardiomyocytes, and as expected, the PNR element conferred the most cardiomyocyte-specific expression. Recombinant adenoviral vectors can have direct cytotoxic effects whereas rAAV vectors are known to be far less cytopathic. To more closely analyze cytotoxicity profile of the rAAV-MHC vectors, TUNEL analysis was performed to monitor the induction of apoptosis. Infection with 5 × 104 rAAV-CMV vector particles/cell for 8 days and 100 rAd-CMV plaque-forming units/cell for 3 days resulted in every cardiomyocyte nucleus staining positive for β-galactosidase (data not shown). Following infection, rAAV- and rAd-infected cells were subjected to TUNEL analysis at 8 and 3 days, respectively. The rAAV-CMV vector did not increase the number of TUNEL-positive cells compared with the non-infected control cells, whereas incubation with the rAd-CMV vector markedly increased the number of TUNEL-positive cells (Fig. 3,A and B, p < 0.005, compared with control cells) as did treatment of cells with H2O2 (data not shown) (39Aikawa R. Komuro I. Yamazaki T. Zou Y. Kudoh S. Tanaka M. Shiojima I. Hiroi Y. Yazaki Y. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 1813-1821Crossref PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar). To confirm the occurrence of apoptosis, we examined DNA fragmentation by agarose gel electrophoresis. Although cytoplasmic DNA extracted from cardiomyocytes after rAd-CMV infection showed prominent ladder formation, incubation with the rAAV-CMV vector did not induce DNA cleavage (Fig. 3 C). Infection with 5 × 104 rAAV-MHC vector particles/cell also did not induce apoptosis in primary cardiomyocytes (Fig. 3, B and C). Despite infection with more particles and for a longer time, we found that rAAV are less likely to induce apoptosis in cardiomyocytes. To determine how efficiently the rAAV-MHC vectors could transduce cardiomyocytes in vivo, 5 × 1010particles of rAAV vectors were injected through the diaphragm into the cardiac wall of 5- to 7-week-old mice. Mice were killed 4 weeks after injection, and assayed for β-galactosidase expression in the myocardium. Positive cells were localized to the injection site. After rAAV-CMV-lacZ administration, β-galactosidase expression was observed in all tissues except liver (only two positive cells), as expected (16Snyder R.O. Miao C.H. Patijn G.A. Spratt S.K. Danos O. Nagy D. Gown A.M. Winther B. Meuse L. Cohen L.K. Thompson A.R. Kay M.A. Nat. Genet. 1997; 16: 270-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar), (Fig. 4 A, top row). Each rAAV-MHC vector expressed β-galactosidase in the heart 4 weeks post injection, with the majority of β-galactosidase staining cells being cardiomyocytes (Fig. 4 A). rAAV vectors were not only injected into the left ventricular wall but also into the liver, quadriceps femoris muscle, and brain. Interestingly, there were very few β-galactosidase-positive cells in both femoral muscle and brain tissues 4 weeks after rAAV-MHC-lacZ injection (Fig. 4 A), and we did not observe positive cells following liver injection. There was no evidence of myocardial and skeletal muscle inflammation detected by hematoxylin and eosin staining in rAAV-CMV-lacZ-injected hearts (Fig. 4 A). To confirm gene transfer following injection of the four recombinant viruses, total DNA was isolated from each tissue, and the presence of rAAV sequences was confirmed by PCR. Agarose gel electrophoresis demonstrated the expected 268-bp PCR product in all tissues injected with the rAAV-lacZ vectors (Fig. 4 B). Thus, rAAV DNA was detected by PCR in all injected tissues, yet the rAAV-MHC-lacZ vectors expressed β-galactosidase significantly only in heart muscle. To develop potentially therapeutic vectors for cardiomyopathy, and to analyze the relative long term expression strength of each rAAV-MHC vector, we exchanged the lacZ gene for the hGH gene in the rAAV-MHC vectors (Fig. 1 A). After direct left ventricular wall injection of 1 × 1011particles of rAAV, hGH levels rose in a biphasic manner, whereas the hGH signal remained below the limit of detection in serum from contro"
https://openalex.org/W2049750865,"Rapid sol-gel transitions of the actin cytoskeleton are required for many key cellular processes, including cell spreading and cell locomotion. Actin monomers assemble into semiflexible polymers that rapidly intertwine into a network, a process that in vitro takes ∼1 min for an actin concentration of 1 mg/ml. The same actin filament network, however, takes ∼1 h to exhibit a steady-state elasticity. We hypothesize that the slow gelation of F-actin is due to the slow establishment of a homogeneous meshwork. Using a novel method, time-resolved multiple particle tracking, which monitors the range of thermally excited displacements of microspheres imbedded in the network, we show that the increase in elasticity in a polymerizing solution of actin parallels the progressive decline of the network microheterogeneity. The rates of gelation and network homogenization slightly decrease with actin concentration and in the presence of the F-actin cross-linking proteins α-actinin and fascin, whereas the rate of actin polymerization increases dramatically with actin concentration. Our measurements show that the slow spatial homogenization of the actin filament network, not actin polymerization or the formation of polymer overlaps, is the rate-limiting step in the establishment of an elastic actin network and suggest that a new activity of F-actin binding proteins may be required for the rapid formation of a homogeneous stiff gel."

Science. 2000; 289: 185-188Crossref Scopus (281) Google Scholar). However, NE released by polymorphonuclear neutrophils is capable of hydrolyzing a broad spectrum of extracellular matrix (ECM) and cell surface proteins, such as elastin, interstitial collagens, proteoglycans, fibronectin, laminin, and others, leading to tissue damage (3Bieth J.G.

In the lungs, under normal physiological conditions, the proteolytic activity of elastase secreted by recruited neutrophils is tightly regulated by anti-proteases, such as α1-proteinase inhibitor (α1-PI) and secretory leukoprotease inhibitor. Genetic deficiency of α1-PI in humans and tobacco smoking are some of the known risk factors for pulmonary emphysema. This progressive disabling disorder in humans is characterized by the destruction of the alveolar walls resulting in enlargement of the peripheral airspaces in the lung (5Hoidal J.R. Niewoehner D.E.

Cell. Physiol. 1996; 166: 495-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). NE is capable of provoking a variety of cellular responses by affecting multiple cell surface and ECM molecules. For instance, NE up-regulates the fibrinogen binding activity of αIIbβ3integrin through a restricted proteolysis of the αIIbsubunit, and this process is relevant to the potentiation of platelet aggregation (16Si-Tahar M.

In lung fibroblasts, elastase is known to initiate shedding of heparan sulfate proteoglycans (17Buczek-Thomas J.A. Nugent M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25167-25172Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), extracellular molecules serving as docking sites for multiple growth factors, such as basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) and transforming growth factor β (18Taipale J.

This shedding, in turn, leads to reduction of bFGF binding to its high affinity receptors (17Buczek-Thomas J.A. Nugent M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25167-25172Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Some of the cell surface proteoglycans were thought to affect enzymatic activity of NE. For example, tight binding of NE to syndecan-1 reduces NE affinity for α1-PI (20Kainulainen V. Wang H. Schick C. Bernfield M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11563-11569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). The bFGF released by elastase and added to lung fibroblasts or vascular wall smooth muscle cells is capable of repressing elastin gene transcription (21Rich C.B. Nugent M.A. Stone P. Foster J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23043-23048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) or inducing cell proliferation (15Thompson K. Rabinovitch M. J. Cell. Physiol. 1996; 166: 495-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), respectively. NE also is capable of shedding the ligand-binding fragment from the tumor necrosis factor-α receptor, providing a mechanism for the attenuated neutrophil response to pro-apoptotic tumor necrosis factor-α at sites of inflammation (22Porteu F. Brockhaus M. Wallach D. Engelmann H. Nathan C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18846-18853Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, by splitting secreted tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase into two fragments with distinct cytokine activities, NE may stimulate production of tumor necrosis factor-α and provoke apoptosis under inflammatory conditions (23Wakasugi K. Schimmel P. Science. 1999; 284: 147-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). In addition, it has been demonstrated that NE as part of a stable complex with the leukocyte-derived inhibitor is translocated from the cytoplasm to the nucleus and functions as a part of a DNase II machinery degrading genomic DNA during apoptosis (24Belmokhtar C.A. Torriglia A. Counis M.F. Courtois Y. Jacquemin-Sablon A. Segal-Bendirdjian E. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 254: 99-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) belongs to the family of receptor tyrosine kinases (25Prenzel N. Fischer O.M. Streit S. Hart S. Ullrich A. Endocr. Relat. Cancer. 2001; 8: 11-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar). EGFR signaling is crucial for branching morphogenesis of lung to occur during development (26Warburton D. Seth R. Shum L.

Allen L. Dobbs L. Werb Z. Derynck R. Dev. Biol. 1997; 186: 224-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK) cascade is one of the numerous signaling pathways activated by EGFR in the cell. In this pathway, growth factor-mediated EGFR signaling is coupled to the phosphorylation/activation of 44-kDa ERK1 and 42-kDa ERK2 via a network of adaptor/scaffolding proteins, small GTPase Ras, and several protein kinases. Activated ERK can translocate in the form of a dimer to the nucleus, where it regulates the activity of several transcriptional factors, or it can directly phosphorylate multiple targets in the cytoplasm, and, thereby, control gene expression, cell cycle progression, proliferation, differentiation, survival, and apoptosis (25Prenzel N. Fischer O.M. Streit S. Hart S. Ullrich A. Endocr. Relat. Cancer. 2001; 8: 11-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar, 28Widmann C. Gibson S. Jarpe M.B. Johnson G.L. Physiol.

The present study was designed to investigate immediate NE-initiated signaling events in lung fibroblasts associated with the alteration of elastogenic phenotype of these cells. We present a novel finding that exposure of lung fibroblasts to NE leads to transient activation of ERK and concomitant decline of tropoelastin mRNA levels in these cells. We demonstrate for the first time that the serine protease triggers ERK activation in elastogenic lung fibroblasts by releasing soluble form(s) of EGF and recruiting EGFR into signal transduction. Human neutrophil elastase was purified from purulent sputum to homogeneity as described previously (30Twumasi D.Y. Liener I.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 1917-1926Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and assessed for enzymatic activity according to Ref. 31Dunlap R.P. Stone P.J. Abeles R.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

First passage cells were seeded into 12-well cluster plates, 35-, 60-, or 100-mm dishes at seeding density 50,000, 125,000, 350,000, and 650,000 cells per well/dish, respectively, and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (JRH Biosciences) supplemented with 5% bovine serum, non-essential amino acids, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin for 11 days. Once in an over-confluent (“hills and valleys”) state, cells were placed into medium supplemented with 0.5% serum for 3 days. On the day of the experiment cell cultures were starved for a total of 4 h with 3 consecutive washes in serum- and antibiotic-free medium. Serum-free cell cultures were challenged with NE or other ligands as specified in the figure legends. Control cell cultures always received an equal amount of the solvent (i.e. PBS, Me2SO, or ethanol) used with experimental cultures. The final concentration of Me2SO or ethanol in the conditioned media did not exceed 0.1% (v/v). Total RNA was extracted from cell cultures using a guanidinium thiocyanate/phenol/chloroform single-step method (32Chomczynski P. BioTechniques. 1993; 15 (536–537): 532-534PubMed Google Scholar) (TRIzol, Invitrogen). Samples of total RNA (10 μg/lane) were electrophoresed through 1.0% agarose-formaldehyde gels, capillary-transferred to nylon membrane (Micron Separations), and cross-linked to filter by ultraviolet irradiation (Stratalinker, Stratagene). To compare integrity and correct RNA, loading blots were stained with 0.04% methylene blue in 0.5 m sodium acetate. Membranes were prehybridized at 42 °C for 2 h in a solution containing 50% formamide, 5× SSC (1× SSC is 0.15 m NaCl and 0.015 m sodium citrate, pH 7.0), 5× Denhardt's reagent, 0.5% SDS, and 100 μg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA and were hybridized overnight in a solution containing 50% formamide, 5× SSC, 10% dextran sulfate, 0.5% SDS, and 32P-labeled 1.1-kb rat tropoelastin cDNA EcoRI fragment (33Rich C.B. Foster J.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1989; 268: 551-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) or32P-labeled mouse c-Fos cDNA probe (provided by Dr. M. Birrer), generated using a random primer labeling kit (Invitrogen). After hybridization, membranes were washed (two times in 1× SSC and 0.1% SDS at 55 °C for 1 h) and exposed from 2 h to overnight at −80 °C with an intensifying screen to X-Omat film (Eastman Kodak Co.). Hybridization signals were quantitated with the use of a Molecular Dynamics laser scanning densitometer. After challenge with the ligands, cell cultures in 12-well cluster plates, 35-, 60-, or 100-mm culture dishes were quickly rinsed twice with PBS at room temperature and lysed with gentle rocking at 4 °C for 10 min in 0.1, 0.25, 1.0, or 2.0 ml, respectively, of ice-cold lysis buffer, containing 10 mm Tris/Cl, pH 7.5, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm PMSF, 1 mm DFP, and 0.2 mmsodium orthovanadate. The lysates were centrifuged at 4 °C for 30 min at 15,000 × g, and clear supernatants were kept at −80 °C. Forty-μl aliquots of supernatants were mixed with 20 μl of 3× SDS-PAGE sample buffer with 2-mercaptoethanol and heated for 10 min at 100 °C, and 40-μl aliquots (∼25 μg of total protein) were loaded on 4% stacking, 9 or 12% separating SDS-PAGE mini-gel (34Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205523) Google Scholar). Electrophoresis was performed at constant current (20 mA/0.75-mm-thick gel). After electrophoresis, the proteins were electroblotted (16 h, 4 °C, 65 V) onto a 0.45-μm pore size nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher & Schuell) according to Ref. 35Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Bio/Technology. 1992; 24: 145-149PubMed Google Scholar. Subsequent steps were performed at room temperature, unless specifically indicated. Transferred proteins were stained briefly with 0.1% Ponceau S (w/v) in 5% acetic acid (Sigma) to check for even loading and transfer. Membranes were blocked in 5% nonfat milk powder (w/v) in TBST (10 mm Tris/Cl, pH 7.4, 150 mmNaCl, and 0.05% Tween 20) for 1 h, washed three times for 5 min with TBST, treated for 1 h with 1:1000 diluted (in TBST) anti-phospho-ERK (New England Biolabs) or anti-EGFR (Upstate Biotechnology Inc.) antibodies, then washed three times for 5 min with TBST, and incubated for 1 h with 1:1000 diluted (in TBST) peroxidase-conjugated secondary IgG (Sigma). Immunodetection of proteins was visualized by using a LumiGlo chemiluminescence detection kit (Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories). Routinely, blots were stripped of bound antibodies in 100 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 2% SDS, 62.5 mm Tris/Cl, pH 6.8, at 70 °C for 30 min, washed with TBST, and re-probed with 1:1000 diluted anti-ERK antibody (Upstate Biotechnology Inc.) and 1:1000 diluted peroxidase-conjugated secondary IgG (Sigma). An in-gel myelin basic protein kinase assay was performed as described previously (36Carreras I. Rich C.B. Jaworski J.A. Dicamillo S.J. Panchenko M.P. Goldstein R. Foster J.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: L766-L775Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, after challenge with the ligands, cell cultures in 35-mm dishes were quickly rinsed twice with PBS at room temperature and lysed with gentle rocking for 10 min at 4 °C in 250 μl of ice-cold buffer containing 10 mm Tris/Cl, pH 7.5, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm PMSF, 1 mm DFP, and 0.2 mm sodium orthovanadate. The lysates were centrifuged at 4 °C for 30 min at 15,000 ×g. Clear supernatants were frozen at −80 °C. Forty μl from each supernatant were mixed with 20 μl of 3× SDS-PAGE sample buffer containing 2-mercaptoethanol and heated for 10 min at 100 °C. Then 40-μl aliquots (∼25 μg of total protein) were loaded on 4% stacking and 12% separating SDS-PAGE mini-gel that had been polymerized with 0.4 mg/ml myelin basic protein. After electrophoresis, the gel was washed with 20% isopropyl alcohol in 100 mm Tris/Cl, pH 8.0, followed by a wash in 100 mm Tris/Cl, pH 8.0, containing 5 mm2-mercaptoethanol. The gel was then denatured in 6 mguanidinium hydrochloride followed by renaturation in 0.04% Tween 40. The gel was incubated at room temperature in kinase buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 10 mm MgCl2, and 2 mm 2-mercaptoethanol for 30 min followed by another incubation in kinase buffer containing 50 μm ATP and 50 μCi of [α-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for 60 min at room temperature. The gel was washed with 1% sodium pyrophosphate in 5% trichloroacetic acid, stained with Coomassie Blue R-250 to check for even protein loading, and dried. Autoradiography was performed for 6–12 h at −80 °C with an intensifying screen and X-Omat film (Kodak). Phosphorylation signals were quantitated with the use of a Molecular Dynamics laser scanning densitometer. After challenge with the ligands, cell cultures in 60-mm dishes were immediately rinsed twice with PBS at room temperature and lysed with gentle rocking for 10 min at 4 °C in 1.0 ml of ice-cold buffer containing 10 mmTris/Cl, pH 7.5, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 0.4 mm PMSF, 1 mm DFP, and 0.2 mmsodium vanadate. Lysates were pre-cleared by mixing with 50 μl of protein A-Sepharose slurry (50% v/v in PBS) for 30 min and centrifuged at 4 °C for 15 min at 15,000 × g. Supernatants were incubated with 10 μg of anti-EGFR IgG (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) at 4 °C for 12–14 h with gentle rocking. The samples were centrifuged at 4 °C for 30 min at 15,000 × g. Clear supernatants were mixed with 75 μl of protein A-Sepharose slurry (50% v/v in PBS), incubated with gentle rocking at 4 °C for 3 h, and then washed twice for 15 min with 1 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer and once for 15 min with 1 ml of cold PBS. Thirty μl of 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer with 2-mercaptoethanol were added to the final pellets; the samples were heated at 100 °C for 10 min and centrifuged, and the recovered supernatant was loaded onto 4% stacking, 9% separating SDS-PAGE mini-gel. After electrophoresis, the proteins were electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membrane and stained briefly with 0.1% Ponceau S (w/v) in 5% acetic acid (Sigma) to check for IgG recovery and transfer. Membranes were first blocked in 5% nonfat milk powder and then probed sequentially first with 1:1000 diluted phosphotyrosine-specific PY-99 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and then with 1:1000 diluted peroxidase-conjugated secondary IgG (Sigma). Immunodetection of proteins was visualized by using a LumiGlo chemiluminescence detection kit (Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories). Blots were stripped of bound antibodies, washed, and re-probed with 1:1000 diluted anti-EGFR (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) and 1:1000 diluted peroxidase-conjugated secondary IgG (Sigma). The intracellular localization of activated ERK in control and NE-treated lung fibroblasts was studied by indirect immunofluorescence. For this purpose, cells were seeded on the glass coverslips placed into 12-well cluster plates with density 50,000 cells per well and grown for 5 days in the presence of 5% serum to reach the confluent state. Then cells were growth-arrested by dropping serum to 0.5% for 3 consecutive days, starved for 4 h in serum-free media, and challenged to 10 μg/ml NE for 7.5 or 15 min. Control and NE-treated cells were washed once with PBS and then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 20 min at room temperature, washed 3 times with PBS, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 15 min at room temperature, and blocked with blocking solution (3% normal donkey serum and 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS) for 1 h at room temperature. The cells were then incubated overnight at 4 °C with 1:250 diluted anti-phospho-ERK (New England Biolabs) in blocking solution. After the primary antibody incubation, cells were washed in PBST (PBS, 0.1% Triton X-100) and incubated for 1 h at room temperature with 1:800 diluted indocarbocyanine (Cy3)-conjugated secondary IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch) in blocking solution. SlowFade-Light Antifade kit (Molecular Probes) was used for mounting cells on slides. Intracellular distribution of phospho-ERK was examined using a confocal laser scanning microscope (Zeiss LSM 510). Control cells, not incubated with primary antibody, were used to establish microscope voltage settings such that no fluorescence is visible within the control cultures, and these same settings were used to analyze the primary antibody-treated cells. Exogenously added bFGF activates the ERK cascade leading to prominent repression of elastin gene transcription in lung fibroblasts (36Carreras I. Rich C.B. Jaworski J.A. Dicamillo S.J. Panchenko M.P. Goldstein R. Foster J.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: L766-L775Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because treatment of these elastogenic cell cultures with NE or pancreatic elastase (PE) results in the release of the endogenous, ECM-bound bFGF (17Buczek-Thomas J.A. Nugent M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25167-25172Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 21Rich C.B. Nugent M.A. Stone P. Foster J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23043-23048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) we hypothesized that the liberated growth factor might signal to ERK activation and tropoelastin mRNA down-regulation in protease-challenged cells. Addition of NE to lung fibroblasts indeed led to ERK activation in both a concentration- and time-dependent manner (Fig. 1). The initial increase of ERK phosphorylation was observed at concentrations of serine protease as low as 1 μg/ml (35 nm) reaching its maximal level (20-fold increase) at 10 μg/ml NE (Fig. 1 A). ERK activation was detectable at 5–6 min, peaked at 15 min, and decreased to basal levels by 240 min (Fig. 1 B). Total intracellular levels of ERK were unaffected by NE treatment. The activation of ERK in NE-challenged cells was also detectable by a direct in-gel kinase assay using myelin basic protein and [γ-32P]ATP as substrates (Fig. 1 C, control). Thus, lung fibroblasts respond to NE challenge by pronounced transient activation of ERK. To examine whether the ERK activating property of NE requires its proteolytic activity, we tested specific serine protease inhibitors in this assay. The ability of NE to initiate ERK activation was completely abolished in the presence of its natural inhibitor, serpin α1-PI (Fig. 2 A). Inactivation of NE with diisopropyl fluorophosphate (DFP), a synthetic serine protease inhibitor, totally abrogated the NE-initiated ERK response, as well as ERK activation initiated by other serine proteinases, such as PE, thrombin, and trypsin (Fig. 2 B). In contrast, α1-PI and DFP did not affect ERK activation by bFGF or platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) (Fig. 2 A). These results demonstrate that NE-initiated ERK activation requires the proteolytic activity of this enzyme. The NE-initiated ERK activation was accompanied by nuclear translocation of phosphorylated ERK (Fig. 3). Nuclear accumulation of ERK was evident at 7.5 min and progressed by 15 min of NE treatment. It is noteworthy that phosphorylated ERK was also localized to fibril-like structures in the cytoplasm of NE-challenged cells (Fig. 3,B and C).

Point mutations in the collagen-like domain (R32C, G34D, or G37E) of MBL cause a serum deficiency, predisposing patients to infections and diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis. We examined whether MBL mutants show enhanced susceptibility to proteolysis by matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), which are important mediators in inflammatory tissue destruction. Human and rat MBL were resistant to proteolysis in the native state but were cleaved selectively within the collagen-like domain by multiple MMPs after heat denaturation. In contrast, rat MBL with mutations homologous to those of the human variants (R23C, G25D, or G28E) was cleaved efficiently without denaturation in the collagen-like domain by MMP-2 and MMP-9 (gelatinases A and B) and MMP-14 (membrane type-1 MMP), as well as by MMP-1 (collagenase-1), MMP-8 (neutrophil collagenase), MMP-3 (stromelysin-1), neutrophil elastase, and bacterial collagenase. Sites and order of cleavage of the rat MBL mutants for MMP-2 and MMP-9 were: Gly45-Lys46 → Gly51-Ser52 → Gly63-Gln64 → Asn80-Met81 which differed from that of MMP-14, Gly39-Leu40 → Asn80-Met81, revealing that the MMPs were not functionally interchangeable. These sites were homologous to those cleaved in denatured human MBL. Hence, perturbation of the collagen-like structure of MBL by natural mutations or by denaturation renders MBL susceptible to MMP cleavage. MMPs are likely to contribute to MBL deficiency in individuals with variant alleles and may also be involved in clearance of MBL and modulation of the host response in normal individuals.

Replacing glycine with relatively bulky acidic side chains or introducing a cysteine reduces hydroxylation and glycosylation of proximal proline and lysine residues. This disrupts the disulfide bond arrangement of the NH2-terminal cysteine-rich domain, which perturbs the local structure of the collagen triple helix (24Kurata H. Cheng H.M. Kozutsumi Y. Yokota Y.

We speculated that variant MBL with its perturbed collagen triple helix may be more susceptible to proteolysis than wild-type protein, but this has yet to be addressed. Collagens are substrates for a family of zinc-dependent endoproteinases, the matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) (29Kleiner D.E. Stetler-Stevenson W.G. Cancer Chemother. Pharmacol. 1999; 43: S42-S51Crossref PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar, 30Cawston T. Mol. Med. Today. 1998; 4: 130-137Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). These enzymes exhibit broad substrate specificity and in addition to extracellular matrix components, process a wide range of bioactive molecules including cell surface receptors, growth factors, and chemokines (31Parks W.C. Shapiro S.D. Respir. Res. 2001; 2: 10-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). Because MBL has a collagen-like domain, we evaluated the susceptibility of human serum MBL to MMP collagenolytic activity and compared this with recombinant rat MBL with mutations homologous to those found in human MBL (25Wallis R. Cheng J.Y. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 4953-4959PubMed Google Scholar). Our studies revealed that denaturation or mutations in MBL which perturb the collagen-like structure render MBL susceptible to cleavage by multiple MMPs. These findings support the hypothesis that MMPs could contribute to low serum levels of MBL in diseases marked by MBL deficiency. Human MBL was purified as described with modification (32Tan S.M. Chung M.C. Kon O.L. Thiel S. Lee S.H. Lu J. Biochem. J. 1996; 319: 329-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Human serum was obtained from volunteer donors who had provided written informed consent. The study was performed under an approval for human subjects research obtained from the University of British Columbia. A crude preparation of MBL was obtained by passage of human serum through mannose-Sepharose and maltose-Sepharose columns. MBL was purified further using Sephacryl S-300, equilibrated in acetate buffer (100 mm sodium acetate, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, pH 5.0), to remove MASPs. α2-Macroglobulin (which can inhibit MMPs) was removed using an anti-α2-macroglobulin column: α2-macroglobulin IgG (Enzyme Research, South Bend, IN) was coupled to cyanogen bromide-activated Sepharose 4B (AmershamBiosciences), and unreacted sites were blocked with glycine. The resin was equilibrated in TBS (50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mmNaCl, pH 7.4). MBL was recovered in the column flow-through, and purity was assessed by SDS-PAGE and silver staining. Wild-type rat MBL (serum form, MBP-A) and MBL containing mutations homologous to those occurring in human MBL deficiency, R23C (R23C-MBL), G25D (G25D-MBL), and G28E (G28E-MBL), were generated and expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells and purified as described (8Wallis R.

Like the MMP-2 hemopexin C domain, the MMP-14 hemopexin C domain construct, Gly285-Cys508, included the linker or “hinge,” whereas Gly315-Cys508 lacked the linker. MBL was denatured by incubation at 60 °C for 20 min to disrupt the collagen triple helix and then cooled on ice. Native or heat-denatured MBL was incubated in the presence of MMP, neutrophil elastase, or bacterial collagenase in assay buffer (100 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 30 mm CaCl2). Proteinase inhibitors were included in some incubations as described. For competition assays, increasing amounts of MMP domains were incubated in the reaction. Samples were electrophoresed reduced or nonreduced on 12.5% Tris-Tricine gels and silver stained. Human MBL was Western blotted using an α-MBL monoclonal antibody against the carbohydrate recognition domain of human MBL (clone 131-1, a gift from S. Thiel, Aarhus University, Denmark) followed by goat anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Bio-Rad). Immunoreactive protein was detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). Protease-digested MBL samples (nonreduced) were electrophoresed on 12.5% Tris-Tricine gels and blotted to polyvinylidene fluoride membrane. Membranes were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250, destained with 50% methanol, and bands of interest were excised. NH2-terminal sequences were determined by Edman Chemistry using an Applied Biosystems Procise Sequencer. Standard derivatives were not detected for proline and lysine residues, which have been shown to be modified to hydroxyproline or glucosylgalactosylhydroxylysine in rat MBL (8Wallis R. Drickamer K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3580-3589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Native and denatured collagen (gelatin) are cleaved differentially by members of the MMP family. To determine whether collagenolytic MMPs have the potential to regulate MBL levels in vivo by cleavage in the collagen-like domain, we tested the susceptibility of native or denatured human serum MBL to proteolysis. Upon reduction, oligomers of native and denatured MBL dissociate and electrophorese as ∼31-kDa monomers (Fig. 1). None of the MMPs tested cleaved native human MBL when incubated at 28 °C (to ensure triple helicity of the collagen-like domain) or 37 °C (data not shown), including the collagenases MMP-1 and MMP-13 (Fig. 1 A). However, denatured MBL was cleaved weakly by MMP-1 (decreased 31-kDa band, Fig. 1 A) and more completely by MMP-2 (gelatinase A) and MMP-14 (MT1-MMP) (Fig. 1 B), which form a proteolytic unit at the cell surface (35Bigg H.F. Morrison C.J. Butler G.S. Bogoyevitch M.A. Wang Z. Soloway P.D. Overall C.M. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 3610-3618PubMed Google Scholar). Both MMP-2 and MMP-14 reduced the intensity of the 31-kDa denatured MBL band and produced new fragments of 25.3 and 21.1 kDa, respectively. Where native MBL was incubated with MMP-2, a band below the 31-kDa MBL monomer represents a MMP-2 breakdown product, which is faintly visible in the MMP-2 controls. The leukocytic MMPs, MMP-8 (neutrophil collagenase) and MMP-9 (gelatinase B), processed denatured MBL to fragments of 23.9 and 21 kDa (MMP-8) and 23.6 and 20 kDa (MMP-9) (Fig. 1 C). MMP-7 (matrilysin), a protease that cleaves gelatin, only weakly cleaved denatured MBL to a 23.9-kDa fragment (Fig. 1 D). Because MMP-2, MMP-9, and MMP-14 were the most efficient at cleaving denatured human MBL, these enzymes were analyzed further. On nonreducing SDS-PAGE, MBL oligomers migrate near the top of the gel, whereas cleavage fragments, no longer bound to the oligomer, separate in the gel and are distinguished readily. After overnight incubation, MMP-2 generated two fragments from denatured human MBL of 24.8 and 22.2 kDa (Fig. 2 A). The 22.2-kDa fragment was also produced by MMP-9, whereas a fragment of 26.3 kDa was released by MMP-14. To determine the sites of MMP cleavage, fragments were subjected to NH2-terminal sequencing (Table I). Cleavage sites are designated hP1-P1′, where h indicates human MBL and P1 and P1′ are the residues either side of the scissile bond. Specificity was indicated by unique sites of cleavage in denatured human MBL by MMP-2, hGly54-Lys55, and MMP-14, hGly48-Leu49, and by a common cleavage site, hGly72-Gln73 for MMP-2 and MMP-9. All three cleavage sites are located within the collagen-like domain of MBL, COOH-terminal to the GQG interruption, such that the stable products consist of the carbohydrate recognition domain, neck, and 2–10 Gly-Xaa-Yaa repeats (Fig. 3). This was confirmed by Western blotting using an antibody raised against the human MBL carbohydrate recognition domain (Fig. 2 B). Bacterial collagenase released similar sized fragments of 20.4 and 18.3 kDa (Fig. 2 B).Table ICleavage of human MBLMMPFragment sizeNH2-terminal sequenceDeduced sequenceCleavage sitekDa1426.3X1-aX represents a cycle where no derivative was obtained.

Fragments common to denatured human and rat variant MBL are shown schematically below the sequence alignment.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To confirm MMP-specific cleavage, BB94 (a synthetic MMP hydroxamate inhibitor), TIMP-2 (a specific proteinaceous inhibitor of MMPs), or phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (a serine proteinase inhibitor) was included in the proteolytic assays with MMP-2 (Fig. 2 C). 2.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride had no effect on the cleavage of denatured MBL by MMP-2, whereas both 250 nmBB94 and 482 nm TIMP-2 completely inhibited cleavage at hGly72-Gln73 and reduced the intensity of the hGly54-Lys55 fragment. Incomplete inhibition indicates the rapidity of the generation of these products before inhibition occurs. This confirms that the processing of human MBL was caused by the added MMPs and not by any MASPs remaining in the preparation. Because neutrophils are present at sites of infection and inflammation where MBL is localized, we examined the ability of neutrophil elastase to cleave human MBL. Unlike neutrophil-specific MMP-8 (Fig. 1 C), neutrophil elastase partially cleaved native MBL to fragments of 26.2 and 22.4 kDa (Fig. 4 A, −DTT), visible as a band of 27.7 kDa under reducing conditions (Fig. 4 B, +DTT). The intensity of these bands was enhanced after denaturation of MBL, indicating that although elastase could cleave native MBL, proteolysis was limited by the triple helical fold of the collagen-like domain. No synergistic effect on MBL proteolysis was detected using combinations of neutrophil elastase and MMPs (data not shown). To determine the efficiency of MMP activity, increasing amounts of MMP-2, MMP-9, or MMP-14 were added to denatured human MBL (42 pmol). Cleavage fragments were generated in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 5). The cleavage at hGly54-Lys55 occurred first with 1.5 pmol of MMP-2, whereas significant quantities of the lower molecular mass fragment, hGly72-Gln73 were produced at higher enzyme concentrations (Fig. 5 A). Both MMP-9 and MMP-14 produced single fragments, hGly72-Gln73 and hGly48-Leu49 respectively, even at the lowest enzyme concentration used (0.4 pmol) (Fig. 5, B and C). Cleavage of denatured human MBL by MMP-2, MMP-9, and MMP-14 was rapid, occurring within 1 h (data not shown). Proteases often localize to substrates via specific binding sites, termed exosites, which also increase catalytic activity (40Overall C.M. Methods Mol. Biol. 2001; 151: 79-120PubMed Google Scholar). Gelatinases bind to collagen via a domain inserted into the MMP catalytic domain, the CBD (37Steffensen B. Wallon U.M. Overall C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11555-11566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar), comprised of three fibronectin type II modules, and to the chemokines monocyte chemoattractant protein-3 (41McQuibban G.A.

To determine the role of the CBD and hemopexin C domain in the cleavage of MBL, recombinant domains were used in competition assays. The addition of ≥ 500:1 molar ratio of CBD:MMP-2 resulted in an increase in the 24.8 and 22.2 kDa bands (Fig. 6 A, lower panel). This appeared to be the result of stimulation of cleavage at hGly54-Lys55 and hGly72-Gln73 because the oligomeric forms of MBL decreased with increasing CBD (Fig. 6 A, upper panel). Neither CBD nor MMP-2 was detected by the α-MBL monoclonal antibody (data not shown). The addition of exogenous MMP-2 hemopexin C domain also resulted in an increase of the 24.8-kDa product at ≥ 100:1 C domain:MMP-2 (Fig. 6 B). However, in this case there was a concomitant decrease in the 22.2-kDa product and no detectable effect on the remaining oligomers, suggesting inhibition of cleavage at hGly72-Gln73. The hemopexin C domain of MT1-MMP with (Fig. 6 C) or without (Fig. 6 D) the “linker” that connects this domain to the catalytic domain had the same effect on cleavage of MBL as the MMP-2 hemopexin C domain at a similar concentration. However, cleavage of MBL by MT1-MMP was not affected significantly by the addition of the MMP-2 or MT1-MMP hemopexin C domain (data not shown). Hence, native human MBL was resistant to MMP activity, but upon denaturation it was cleaved efficiently in the collagen-like domain by MMPs. In the case of MMP-2, the mechanism involves both the CBD and hemopexin C domains, whereas MT1-MMP appears less dependent on the hemopexin C domain for MBL cleavage. Naturally occurring mutations in MBL are known to perturb the helical structure of the collagen-like domain. Because denatured human MBL was cleaved efficiently by MMPs, we hypothesized that proteolysis of variant MBL proteins might contribute to low serum levels in these patients. To address this, we examined the MMP susceptibility of recombinant rat MBL containing point mutations corresponding to natural human mutations, R23C-MBL, G25D-MBL, and G28E-MBL (Fig. 3)."
https://openalex.org/W2089523316,"We have investigated the mechanisms whereby α2B-adrenergic receptor (α2B-AR) promotes MAPK activation in a clone of the renal tubular cell line, LLC-PK1, transfected with the rat nonglycosylated α2-AR gene. Treatment of LLC-PK1-α2Bwith UK14304 or dexmedetomidine caused arachidonic acid (AA) release and ERK2 phosphorylation. AA release was abolished by prior treatment of the cells with pertussis toxin, quinacrine, or methyl arachidonyl fluorophosphonate but not by the addition of the MEK inhibitor U0126. The effects of α2-agonists on MAPK phosphorylation were mimicked by cell exposure to exogenous AA. On the other hand, quinacrine abolished the effects of UK14304, but not of AA, suggesting that AA released through PLA2 is responsible for MAPK activation by α2B-AR. The effects of α2-agonists or AA were PKC-independent and were attenuated by indomethacin and nordihydroguaiaretic acid. Treatment with batimastat, CRM 197, or tyrphostin AG1478 suppressed MAPK phosphorylation promoted by α2-agonist or AA. Furthermore, conditioned culture medium from UK14304-treated LLC-PK1-α2B induced MAPK phosphorylation in wild-type LLC-PK1. Based on these data, we propose a model whereby activation of MAPK by α2B-AR is mediated through stimulation of PLA2, AA release, generation of AA derivatives, activation of matrix metalloproteinases, release of heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor, transactivation of epidermal growth factor receptor, and recruitment of Shc. Whether this pathway is particular to α2B-AR and LLC-PK1 or whether it can be extended to other cell types and/or other G-protein-coupled receptors remains to be established.

The α2-adrenergic receptors (α2-ARs) are members of the G-protein-coupled receptor superfamily that mediate physiological responses to the endogenous catecholamines, such as reduction of blood pressure, sedation, platelet aggregation, and inhibition of renin release or insulin secretion. Three subtypes of α2-ARs (namely α2A, α2B, and α2C) have been identified (1Bylund D.B. Eikenberg D.C. Hieble J.P. Langer S.Z. Lefkowitz R.J. Minneman K.P. Molinoff P.B. Ruffolo R.R. Trendelenburg U. Pharmacol. Rev. 1994; 46: 121-136PubMed Google Scholar). Although recent studies, conducted on mice with genetic alterations of α2-AR expression, have clarified the respective roles of α2A- and α2B-ARs in the mediation of the cardiovascular and sedative effects of α2-agonists, the precise functions of each subtype are far from being definitively elucidated (2Kable J.W. Murrin L.C. Bylund D.B. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2000; 293: 1-7PubMed Google Scholar). Until recently, the effects of α2-ARs were generally considered as exclusively due to the modulation of effectors such as adenylyl cyclase or phospholipase Cβ. There is now accumulating evidence that, in addition to these pathways, α2-ARs are also involved in the regulation of cell growth via stimulation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs). The phosphorylation of MAPKs has been observed in transfected cells (3Flordellis C.S. Berguerand M. Gouache P. Barbu V. Gavras H. Handy D.E. Bereziat G. Masliah J. J. Biol.

The three receptor subtypes promoted phosphorylation of ERK1 and ERK2 in Chinese hamster ovary cells (3Flordellis C.S. Berguerand M. Gouache P. Barbu V. Gavras H. Handy D.E. Bereziat G. Masliah J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3491-3494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). According to results obtained in HEK 293 and COS cells (7Schramm N.L. Limbird L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24935-24940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 8DeGraff J.L. Gagnon A.W. Benovic J.L. Orsini M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11253-11259Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), this effect is independent of receptor internalization via clathrin-coated pits.Like for other ARs (9Pierce K.L. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 1532-1539Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar), it is probable that the mechanisms whereby α2-ARs promote MAPK activation are highly dependent upon the subtype considered and the particular cell type it is expressed in. So far, the precise pathways of the mitogenic signal transmission were exclusively examined for α2A-AR. In HEK 293 cells (10Della Rocca G.J. van Biesen T. Daaka Y. Luttrell D.K. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19125-19132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar), activation of ERK1/2 by α2A-AR is primarily triggered through release of βγ subunits from pertussis toxin-sensitive G proteins, stimulation of phospholipase Cβ, phosphoinositide hydrolysis, increase of intracellular Ca2+, and successive activation of Pyk2 and Src. Activation of Src causes the formation of Shc-Grb2-Sos complex, which leads to ERK phosphorylation via the Ras/Raf/MEK cascade. In COS cells (11Pierce K.L. Tohgo A. Ahn S. Field M.E. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23155-23160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar), α2A-AR-induced phosphorylation of ERK2 proceeds via two distinct pathways, which are dependent (“transactivation pathway”) or not (“direct pathway”) on the tyrosine kinase activity of the EGF receptor (EGF-R). The early steps of both pathways involve the release of βγ subunits from Gi proteins and the activation of Src by an unknown process that is independent of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate production (12Hawes B.E. van Biesen T. Koch W.J. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17148-17153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). Then, the phosphorylation of MAPKs occurs either directly through recruitment of the MEK cascade via phosphorylation of the adapter protein Shc or indirectly through activation of unidentified matrix metalloproteinases, release of heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor (HB-EGF), and subsequent transactivation of EGF-R.Recent experiments carried out on rat proximal tubule cells in primary culture and on LLC-PK1 cells transfected with the rat nonglycosylated α2-AR (RNG) gene (LLC-PK1-α2B) have shown that α2B-ARs promote MAPK activation and arachidonic acid (AA) release (13Cussac D. Schaak S. Gales C. Flordellis C. Denis C. Paris H. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2002; 282: F943-F952Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The sequential relationship between PLA2 and MAPK activation was not investigated. As demonstrated in eosinophils during the process of adhesion to fibronectin (14Sano H. Zhu X. Sano A. Boetticher E.E. Shioya T. Jacobs B. Munoz N.M. Leff A.R. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 3515-3521Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), PLA2 activation may result from its phosphorylation by MAPKs. Conversely, as shown in rabbit renal epithelial cells for angiotensin II receptor, the activation of MAPK could be the consequence of AA release (15Jiao H. Cui X.L. Torti M. Chang C.H. Alexander L.D. Lapetina E.G. Douglas J.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7417-7421Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Based on the use of different inhibitors, the present work demonstrates that activation of MAPK by α2B-AR is, in LLC-PK1-α2B, primarily mediated by a pathway involving stimulation of PLA2, generation of AA derivatives, activation of matrix metalloproteinases, release of HB-EGF, and transactivation of EGF-R.DISCUSSIONThe phosphorylation of MAPKs (ERK1/2) by α2-agonists has been reported in a variety of cells, including Chinese hamster ovary cells transfected with the RNG gene (3Flordellis C.S. Berguerand M. Gouache P. Barbu V. Gavras H. Handy D.E. Bereziat G. Masliah J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3491-3494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) and COS or HEK 293 cells transfected with the α2C2 gene (7Schramm N.L. Limbird L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24935-24940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 8DeGraff J.L. Gagnon A.W. Benovic J.L. Orsini M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11253-11259Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), which encode the rat and human α2B-AR subtypes, respectively. More recently, this effect has also been observed in rat proximal tubule cells in primary culture as well as in LLC-PK1-α2B (13Cussac D. Schaak S. Gales C. Flordellis C. Denis C. Paris H. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2002; 282: F943-F952Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In these two models, receptor stimulation resulted in an acceleration of cell proliferation, suggesting that the action of catecholamines on α2B-AR may play, in rat, a role in the adaptive response to acute renal tissue injury. Additionally, α2B-AR is known to enhance Na+ reabsorption as a consequence of increased activity of the Na+/H+ exchanger, NHE3 (20Nord E.P. Howard M.J. Hafezi A. Moradeshagi P. Vaystub S. Insel P.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1987; 80: 1755-1762Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Since NHE3 was recently found to be controlled by MAPK in mouse proximal tubule cells (21Liu F. Gesek F.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: F415-F425Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), it is possible that MAPK activation is also involved in the regulation of NHE3 by α2B-AR.The mechanisms whereby G-protein-coupled receptors activate the MAPK cascade are highly dependent upon the receptor considered and the cell type it is expressed in. Although previous studies have shown that the action of the α2B-AR is independent of receptor internalization (7Schramm N.L. Limbird L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24935-24940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 8DeGraff J.L. Gagnon A.W. Benovic J.L. Orsini M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11253-11259Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), the signaling pathway(s) accounting for the phosphorylation of MAPK by this receptor subtype remains poorly defined. The results obtained in this study provide substantial evidence that, in LLC-PK1-α2B, the activation of ERK by α2-agonists is triggered via a mechanism comprising the activation of matrix metalloproteinases, the release of HB-EGF, and the subsequent activation of the EGF-R. This cascade was demonstrated by the following observations. First, UK14304-induced phosphorylation of MAPK is totally abrogated in the presence of the matrix metalloproteinase inhibitors (batimastat or 1,10-phenanthroline) and by prior treatment of the cells with CRM 197. Second, conditioned medium from LLC-PK1-α2B cells treated with UK14304 causes activation of MAPK in wild-type LLC-PK1, even in the presence of batimastat. Third, the consequences of LLC-PK1-α2B exposure to α2-agonists or of wild-type LLC-PK1 exposure to conditioned medium are abolished by prior treatment of the cells with the inhibitor of EGF-R tyrosine kinase activity, tyrphostin AG1478. Previous studies of lysophosphatidic acid receptor or α2A-AR have demonstrated that the contribution of the EGF-R transactivation pathway is largely dependent on the cell type (10Della Rocca G.J. van Biesen T.

In HEK 293, the major pathway of MAPK activation by α2A-AR is via the activation of Pyk2, a calcium-dependent tyrosine kinase of the focal adhesion kinase family (10Della Rocca G.J. van Biesen T. Daaka Y. Luttrell D.K. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19125-19132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the effects of α2A-AR in COS cells are mediated by both EGF-R transactivation and direct recruitment of the MEK cascade by Src (9Pierce K.L. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 1532-1539Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar,23Pierce K.L. Maudsley S. Daaka Y. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1489-1494Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). According to our results, the transactivation pathway is predominant in LLC-PK1-α2B; whether it is exclusive awaits definitive demonstration.An other major effort of the present work was to define the pathway leading from stimulated α2B-AR to transactivation of EGF-R. Because α2-agonists activate AA release in LLC-PK1-α2B and because AA is responsible for MAPK phosphorylation following angiotensin II treatment in rabbit proximal tubule cells (16Dulin N.O. Alexander L.D. Harwalkar S. Falck J.R. Douglas J.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8098-8102Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), we sought to evaluate its implication. Consistent with a crucial role of the lipid second messenger, exposure of LLC-PK1-α2B to exogenous AA resulted in tyrosine phosphorylation of p52 Shc and in activation of MAPK with time courses that show a striking parallel to those observed with α2-agonists. Like for α2-agonists, the action of AA was prevented by batimastat, 1,10-phenanthroline, CRM 197, or tyrphostin AG1478. However, a major divergence was that, unlike the effects of α2-agonists, those of AA are resistant to pretreatment with pertussis toxin or to the addition of quinacrine. Additional support for implication of AA in the mediation of α2B-AR signal came from the study of the effects of inhibitors of AA metabolism. According to these experiments, phosphorylation of MAPK by UK14304 was strongly inhibited by NDGA and indomethacin. Ketoconazole was by contrast ineffective, indicating that AA products generated by lipoxygenase and/or cyclooxygenase, but not epoxygenase, are involved in α2-agonist effect. The observation that AA causes MAPK phosphorylation in our model is in opposition with results obtained on LLC-PK1/C14 (24Chen J.K. Wang D.W. Falck J.R. Capdevila J. Harris R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4764-4769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). In this clone, ERK phosphorylation was observed in response to epoxyeicosatrienoic acids but not to AA. Moreover, AA became efficient after cell transfection with an active form of cytochrome P450 epoxygenase of bacterial origin, indicating eicosanoid-dependent activation of MAPK. The reason for these discrepancies is enigmatic. However, activation of MAPK by AA was repeatedly reported in rabbit proximal tubules as well as in various cell types, including vascular smooth muscle cells and neutrophils. In vascular smooth muscle cells, efficacy of AA was dependent on its conversion into 15-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid and on PKC activation (25Rao G.N. Baas A.S. Glasgow W.C. Eling T.E. Runge M.S. Alexander R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32586-32591Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Dependence on lipoxygenase and PKC activity was also found in human neutrophils (26Hii C.S. Huang Z.H. Bilney A. Costabile M. Murray A.W. Rathjen D.A. Der C.J. Ferrante A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19277-19282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). In this cell type, the effects of AA engaged a membrane receptor linked to Gi/o proteins (27Capodici C. Pillinger M.H. Han G. Philips M.R. Weissmann G. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 102: 165-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). This is not the case in LLC-PK1-α2B, since neither staurosporine nor pertussis toxin treatment abolished ERK phosphorylation caused by AA. Regarding these points, LLC-PK1-α2B resembles rabbit renal epithelial cells. However, it is epoxy derivatives that mediate the effects of AA on MAPK phosphorylation in these cells (16Dulin N.O. Alexander L.D. Harwalkar S. Falck J.R. Douglas J.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8098-8102Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Whereas involvement of the cytochrome P450 pathway can be excluded in our model, the respective contribution of COX and LOX is still unclear, since it is difficult to reconcile why products from either pathway could function similarly. The implication of COX activity is beyond doubt, because the effects of α2-agonists and AA were also blocked by aspirin (not shown). By contrast, that of LOX is more questionable, since NDGA can also interfere with COX activity and act as an antioxidant. Alternatively, the possibility that prostaglandins and leukotrienes act in concert cannot be definitively ruled out. Indeed, the combined action of COX and LOX was already demonstrated to be necessary for some of the effects of angiotensin II in rat kidney and bovine bronchi (28Oyekan A. Balazy M. McGiff J.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: R293-R300PubMed Google Scholar, 29Nally J.E. Bunton D.C. Martin D. Thomson N.C. Pulm. Pharmacol. 1996; 9: 211-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). It is therefore clear that the identification of the AA metabolites responsible for MAPK activation in LLC-PK1-α2B will require future study. In addition, the mechanism whereby these products may affect matrix metalloproteinase activity has yet to be defined. In line with the existence of a relationship between the two phenomena, constitutive expression of cyclooxygenase-2 in human colon cancer cells results in increased activation of MMP-2 (30Tsujii M. Kawano S. DuBois R.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3336-3340Crossref PubMed Scopus (1325) Google Scholar), whereas inhibitors of PLA2 and cyclooxygenase-2 reduce the release of matrix metalloproteinases in prostate tumor cells (31Attiga F.A. Fernandez P.M. Weeraratna A.T. Manyak M.J. Patierno S.R. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 4629-4637PubMed Google Scholar).In conclusion, our results provide evidence for a pathway by which α2B-AR activates MAPK through stimulation of PLA2, generation of AA metabolites by cyclooxygenase and/or lipoxygenase, stimulation of matrix metalloproteinases, release of HB-EGF, and transactivation of the EGF-R (Fig. 9). Whether this scenario is particular to α2B-AR in LLC-PK1 or whether it can be extended to other cell types and/or other G-protein-coupled receptors remains to be established. The α2-adrenergic receptors (α2-ARs) are members of the G-protein-coupled receptor superfamily that mediate physiological responses to the endogenous catecholamines, such as reduction of blood pressure, sedation, platelet aggregation, and inhibition of renin release or insulin secretion. Three subtypes of α2-ARs (namely α2A, α2B, and α2C) have been identified (1Bylund D.B. Eikenberg D.C. Hieble J.P. Langer S.Z. Lefkowitz R.J. Minneman K.P. Molinoff P.B. Ruffolo R.R. Trendelenburg U.

Although recent studies, conducted on mice with genetic alterations of α2-AR expression, have clarified the respective roles of α2A- and α2B-ARs in the mediation of the cardiovascular and sedative effects of α2-agonists, the precise functions of each subtype are far from being definitively elucidated (2Kable J.W.

Until recently, the effects of α2-ARs were generally considered as exclusively due to the modulation of effectors such as adenylyl cyclase or phospholipase Cβ. There is now accumulating evidence that, in addition to these pathways, α2-ARs are also involved in the regulation of cell growth via stimulation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs). The phosphorylation of MAPKs has been observed in transfected cells (3Flordellis C.S. Berguerand M. Gouache P. Barbu V. Gavras H. Handy D.E. Bereziat G. Masliah J. J. Biol.

The three receptor subtypes promoted phosphorylation of ERK1 and ERK2 in Chinese hamster ovary cells (3Flordellis C.S. Berguerand M. Gouache P. Barbu V. Gavras H. Handy D.E. Bereziat G. Masliah J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3491-3494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). According to results obtained in HEK 293 and COS cells (7Schramm N.L. Limbird L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24935-24940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 8DeGraff J.L. Gagnon A.W. Benovic J.L. Orsini M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11253-11259Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), this effect is independent of receptor internalization via clathrin-coated pits. Like for other ARs (9Pierce K.L. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 1532-1539Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar), it is probable that the mechanisms whereby α2-ARs promote MAPK activation are highly dependent upon the subtype considered and the particular cell type it is expressed in. So far, the precise pathways of the mitogenic signal transmission were exclusively examined for α2A-AR. In HEK 293 cells (10Della Rocca G.J. van Biesen T. Daaka Y. Luttrell D.K. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19125-19132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar), activation of ERK1/2 by α2A-AR is primarily triggered through release of βγ subunits from pertussis toxin-sensitive G proteins, stimulation of phospholipase Cβ, phosphoinositide hydrolysis, increase of intracellular Ca2+, and successive activation of Pyk2 and Src. Activation of Src causes the formation of Shc-Grb2-Sos complex, which leads to ERK phosphorylation via the Ras/Raf/MEK cascade. In COS cells (11Pierce K.L. Tohgo A. Ahn S. Field M.E. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23155-23160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar), α2A-AR-induced phosphorylation of ERK2 proceeds via two distinct pathways, which are dependent (“transactivation pathway”) or not (“direct pathway”) on the tyrosine kinase activity of the EGF receptor (EGF-R). The early steps of both pathways involve the release of βγ subunits from Gi proteins and the activation of Src by an unknown process that is independent of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate production (12Hawes B.E. van Biesen T. Koch W.J. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17148-17153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). Then, the phosphorylation of MAPKs occurs either directly through recruitment of the MEK cascade via phosphorylation of the adapter protein Shc or indirectly through activation of unidentified matrix metalloproteinases, release of heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor (HB-EGF), and subsequent transactivation of EGF-R. Recent experiments carried out on rat proximal tubule cells in primary culture and on LLC-PK1 cells transfected with the rat nonglycosylated α2-AR (RNG) gene (LLC-PK1-α2B) have shown that α2B-ARs promote MAPK activation and arachidonic acid (AA) release (13Cussac D. Schaak S. Gales C. Flordellis C. Denis C. Paris H. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2002; 282: F943-F952Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The sequential relationship between PLA2 and MAPK activation was not investigated. As demonstrated in eosinophils during the process of adhesion to fibronectin (14Sano H. Zhu X. Sano A. Boetticher E.E. Shioya T. Jacobs B. Munoz N.M. Leff A.R. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 3515-3521Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), PLA2 activation may result from its phosphorylation by MAPKs. Conversely, as shown in rabbit renal epithelial cells for angiotensin II receptor, the activation of MAPK could be the consequence of AA release (15Jiao H. Cui X.L. Torti M. Chang C.H. Alexander L.D. Lapetina E.G. Douglas J.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7417-7421Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Based on the use of different inhibitors, the present work demonstrates that activation of MAPK by α2B-AR is, in LLC-PK1-α2B, primarily mediated by a pathway involving stimulation of PLA2, generation of AA derivatives, activation of matrix metalloproteinases, release of HB-EGF, and transactivation of EGF-R. DISCUSSIONThe phosphorylation of MAPKs (ERK1/2) by α2-agonists has been reported in a variety of cells, including Chinese hamster ovary cells transfected with the RNG gene (3Flordellis C.S. Berguerand M. Gouache P. Barbu V. Gavras H. Handy D.E. Bereziat G. Masliah J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3491-3494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) and COS or HEK 293 cells transfected with the α2C2 gene (7Schramm N.L. Limbird L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24935-24940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 8DeGraff J.L. Gagnon A.W. Benovic J.L. Orsini M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11253-11259Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), which encode the rat and human α2B-AR subtypes, respectively. More recently, this effect has also been observed in rat proximal tubule cells in primary culture as well as in LLC-PK1-α2B (13Cussac D. Schaak S. Gales C. Flordellis C. Denis C. Paris H. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2002; 282: F943-F952Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In these two models, receptor stimulation resulted in an acceleration of cell proliferation, suggesting that the action of catecholamines on α2B-AR may play, in rat, a role in the adaptive response to acute renal tissue injury. Additionally, α2B-AR is known to enhance Na+ reabsorption as a consequence of increased activity of the Na+/H+ exchanger, NHE3 (20Nord E.P. Howard M.J. Hafezi A. Moradeshagi P. Vaystub S. Insel P.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1987; 80: 1755-1762Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Since NHE3 was recently found to be controlled by MAPK in mouse proximal tubule cells (21Liu F. Gesek F.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: F415-F425Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), it is possible that MAPK activation is also involved in the regulation of NHE3 by α2B-AR.The mechanisms whereby G-protein-coupled receptors activate the MAPK cascade are highly dependent upon the receptor considered and the cell type it is expressed in. Although previous studies have shown that the action of the α2B-AR is independent of receptor internalization (7Schramm N.L. Limbird L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24935-24940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 8DeGraff J.L. Gagnon A.W. Benovic J.L. Orsini M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11253-11259Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), the signaling pathway(s) accounting for the phosphorylation of MAPK by this receptor subtype remains poorly defined. The results obtained in this study provide substantial evidence that, in LLC-PK1-α2B, the activation of ERK by α2-agonists is triggered via a mechanism comprising the activation of matrix metalloproteinases, the release of HB-EGF, and the subsequent activation of the EGF-R. This cascade was demonstrated by the following observations. First, UK14304-induced phosphorylation of MAPK is totally abrogated in the presence of the matrix metalloproteinase inhibitors (batimastat or 1,10-phenanthroline) and by prior treatment of the cells with CRM 197. Second, conditioned medium from LLC-PK1-α2B cells treated with UK14304 causes activation of MAPK in wild-type LLC-PK1, even in the presence of batimastat. Third, the consequences of LLC-PK1-α2B exposure to α2-agonists or of wild-type LLC-PK1 exposure to conditioned medium are abolished by prior treatment of the cells with the inhibitor of EGF-R tyrosine kinase activity, tyrphostin AG1478. Previous studies of lysophosphatidic acid receptor or α2A-AR have demonstrated that the contribution of the EGF-R transactivation pathway is largely dependent on the cell type (10Della Rocca G.J. van Biesen T.

In HEK 293, the major pathway of MAPK activation by α2A-AR is via the activation of Pyk2, a calcium-dependent tyrosine kinase of the focal adhesion kinase family (10Della Rocca G.J. van Biesen T. Daaka Y. Luttrell D.K. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19125-19132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the effects of α2A-AR in COS cells are mediated by both EGF-R transactivation and direct recruitment of the MEK cascade by Src (9Pierce K.L. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 1532-1539Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar,23Pierce K.L. Maudsley S. Daaka Y. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1489-1494Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). According to our results, the transactivation pathway is predominant in LLC-PK1-α2B; whether it is exclusive awaits definitive demonstration.An other major effort of the present work was to define the pathway leading from stimulated α2B-AR to transactivation of EGF-R. Because α2-agonists activate AA release in LLC-PK1-α2B and because AA is responsible for MAPK phosphorylation following angiotensin II treatment in rabbit proximal tubule cells (16Dulin N.O. Alexander L.D. Harwalkar S. Falck J.R. Douglas J.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8098-8102Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), we sought to evaluate its implication. Consistent with a crucial role of the lipid second messenger, exposure of LLC-PK1-α2B to exogenous AA resulted in tyrosine phosphorylation of p52 Shc and in activation of MAPK with time courses that show a striking parallel to those observed with α2-agonists. Like for α2-agonists, the action of AA was prevented by batimastat, 1,10-phenanthroline, CRM 197, or tyrphostin AG1478. However, a major divergence was that, unlike the effects of α2-agonists, those of AA are resistant to pretreatment with pertussis toxin or to the addition of quinacrine. Additional support for implication of AA in the mediation of α2B-AR signal came from the study of the effects of inhibitors of AA metabolism. According to these experiments, phosphorylation of MAPK by UK14304 was strongly inhibited by NDGA and indomethacin. Ketoconazole was by contrast ineffective, indicating that AA products generated by lipoxygenase and/or cyclooxygenase, but not epoxygenase, are involved in α2-agonist effect. The observation that AA causes MAPK phosphorylation in our model is in opposition with results obtained on LLC-PK1/C14 (24Chen J.K. Wang D.W. Falck J.R. Capdevila J. Harris R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4764-4769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). In this clone, ERK phosphorylation was observed in response to epoxyeicosatrienoic acids but not to AA. Moreover, AA became efficient after cell transfection with an active form of cytochrome P450 epoxygenase of bacterial origin, indicating eicosanoid-dependent activation of MAPK. The reason for these discrepancies is enigmatic. However, activation of MAPK by AA was repeatedly reported in rabbit proximal tubules as well as in various cell types, including vascular smooth muscle cells and neutrophils. In vascular smooth muscle cells, efficacy of AA was dependent on its conversion into 15-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid and on PKC activation (25Rao G.N. Baas A.S. Glasgow W.C. Eling T.E. Runge M.S. Alexander R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32586-32591Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Dependence on lipoxygenase and PKC activity was also found in human neutrophils (26Hii C.S. Huang Z.H. Bilney A. Costabile M. Murray A.W. Rathjen D.A. Der C.J. Ferrante A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19277-19282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). In this cell type, the effects of AA engaged a membrane receptor linked to Gi/o proteins (27Capodici C. Pillinger M.H. Han G. Philips M.R. Weissmann G. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 102: 165-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). This is not the case in LLC-PK1-α2B, since neither staurosporine nor pertussis toxin treatment abolished ERK phosphorylation caused by AA. Regarding these points, LLC-PK1-α2B resembles rabbit renal epithelial cells. However, it is epoxy derivatives that mediate the effects of AA on MAPK phosphorylation in these cells (16Dulin N.O. Alexander L.D. Harwalkar S. Falck J.R. Douglas J.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8098-8102Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Whereas involvement of the cytochrome P450 pathway can be excluded in our model, the respective contribution of COX and LOX is still unclear, since it is difficult to reconcile why products from either pathway could function similarly. The implication of COX activity is beyond doubt, because the effects of α2-agonists and AA were also blocked by aspirin (not shown). By contrast, that of LOX is more questionable, since NDGA can also interfere with COX activity and act as an antioxidant. Alternatively, the possibility that prostaglandins and leukotrienes act in concert cannot be definitively ruled out. Indeed, the combined action of COX and LOX was already demonstrated to be necessary for some of the effects of angiotensin II in rat kidney and bovine bronchi (28Oyekan A. Balazy M. McGiff J.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: R293-R300PubMed Google Scholar, 29Nally J.E. Bunton D.C. Martin D. Thomson N.C. Pulm. Pharmacol. 1996; 9: 211-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). It is therefore clear that the identification of the AA metabolites responsible for MAPK activation in LLC-PK1-α2B will require future study. In addition, the mechanism whereby these products may affect matrix metalloproteinase activity has yet to be defined. In line with the existence of a relationship between the two phenomena, constitutive expression of cyclooxygenase-2 in human colon cancer cells results in increased activation of MMP-2 (30Tsujii M. Kawano S. DuBois R.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3336-3340Crossref PubMed Scopus (1325) Google Scholar), whereas inhibitors of PLA2 and cyclooxygenase-2 reduce the release of matrix metalloproteinases in prostate tumor cells (31Attiga F.A. Fernandez P.M. Weeraratna A.T. Manyak M.J. Patierno S.R. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 4629-4637PubMed Google Scholar).In conclusion, our results provide evidence for a pathway by which α2B-AR activates MAPK through stimulation of PLA2, generation of AA metabolites by cyclooxygenase and/or lipoxygenase, stimulation of matrix metalloproteinases, release of HB-EGF, and transactivation of the EGF-R (Fig. 9). Whether this scenario is particular to α2B-AR in LLC-PK1 or whether it can be extended to other cell types and/or other G-protein-coupled receptors remains to be established. The phosphorylation of MAPKs (ERK1/2) by α2-agonists has been reported in a variety of cells, including Chinese hamster ovary cells transfected with the RNG gene (3Flordellis C.S. Berguerand M.

Fernandez P.M. Weeraratna A.T. Manyak M.J. Patierno S.R. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 4629-4637PubMed Google Scholar). In conclusion, our results provide evidence for a pathway by which α2B-AR activates MAPK through stimulation of PLA2, generation of AA metabolites by cyclooxygenase and/or lipoxygenase, stimulation of matrix metalloproteinases, release of HB-EGF, and transactivation of the EGF-R (Fig. 9). Whether this scenario is particular to α2B-AR in LLC-PK1 or whether it can be extended to other cell types and/or other G-protein-coupled receptors remains to be established. We thank Dr. C. Flordellis for valuable discussion and F. Quinchon for excellent technical assistance."
https://openalex.org/W2009378893,"Collagen α1(I) mRNA is posttranscriptionally regulated in hepatic stellate cells (HSCs). Binding of protein factors to the evolutionary conserved stem-loop in the 5′-untranslated region (5′ stem-loop) is required for a high level of expression in activated HSCs. The 5′ stem-loop is also found in α2(I) and α1(III) mRNAs. Titration of the 5′ stem-loop binding factors by a stably expressed RNA containing the 5′ stem-loop (molecular decoy) may decrease the expression of these collagen mRNAs. We designed a 108-nt RNA that is transcribed from the optimized mouse U7 small nuclear RNA gene and contains the 5′ stem-loop (p74WT decoy). This decoy accumulates in the nucleus and in the cytoplasm. When expressed in NIH 3T3 fibroblasts, the p74WT decoy decreased collagen α1(I) mRNA level by 60% and decreased collagen type I secreted into the cellular medium by 50%. We also expressed this decoy in quiescent rat HSCs by adenoviral gene transfer. Quiescent HSCs undergo activation in culture, resulting in a 60–70-fold increase in collagen α1(I) mRNA. The decoy decreases collagen α1(I) mRNA expression by 50–60% during activation of HSCs. It also decreases collagen α2(I) mRNA expression and collagen α1(III) mRNA expression. The cellular levels of collagen α1(I) propeptide and of disulfide-bonded collagen type I trimer are reduced by 70%. However, the p74WT decoy did not decrease α smooth muscle actin protein or the mRNA levels of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and interleukin-6. The p74WT decoy was also introduced into activated human HSCs. In these cells, the decoy decreased collagen α1(I) propeptide and disulfide-bonded collagen trimer by 50–60%. These results indicate that the 5′ stem-loop specifically regulates fibrillar collagen synthesis and represents a novel target for antifibrotic therapy. The molecular decoys provide a generalized method of assessing the functional significance of blocking the interactions of mRNA and proteins.

Cirrhosis is characterized by the accumulation of extracellular matrix proteins in the liver, including type I collagen (1Aycock R.S. Seyer J.M. Connect.

Upon a fibrogenic stimulus, HSCs become activated, a process in which they lose retinoid droplets, proliferate, change morphologically into myofibroblasts, and increase their synthesis of extracellular matrix proteins (6Friedman S.L.

This provides a simple model system to study HSC activation and collagen gene regulation. hepatic stellate cells untranslated region small nuclear RNA green fluorescent protein RNase protection assay(s) reverse transcription nucleotide(s) glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase MUT, mutant Expression of the collagen α1(I) gene is regulated at the transcriptional and posttranscriptional level, producing an increase in the mRNA steady-state levels by 60–70-fold in activated HSCs compared with quiescent HSCs (9Stefanovic B. Hellerbrand C. Holcik M. Briendl M. Aliebhaber S. Brenner D.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5201-5209Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This results from a 3-fold increase in the transcription rate and a 16-fold increase in the half-life of the α1(I) mRNA (9Stefanovic B. Hellerbrand C. Holcik M. Briendl M. Aliebhaber S. Brenner D.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5201-5209Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting a predominantly post-transcriptional regulation. Two cis-acting elements in collagen α1(I) mRNA, the 5′ stem-loop and the C-rich sequence in the 3′-UTR, regulate the turnover of collagen α1(I) mRNA (9Stefanovic B. Hellerbrand C. Holcik M. Briendl M. Aliebhaber S. Brenner D.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5201-5209Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Stefanovic B. Hellerbrand C. Brenner D.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4334-4342Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). αCP is the protein that binds the C-rich sequence in the 3′-UTR of collagen α1(I) mRNA (11Lindquist J.N. Kauschke S.G. Stefanovic B. Burchardt E.R. Brenner D.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 4306-4316Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Since this binding activity is only in activated HSCs, αCP is postulated to be involved in stabilization of collagen α1(I) mRNA. The 5′-UTRs of three fibrillar collagen mRNAs, α1(I), α2(I), and α1(III), have a stem-loop structure encompassing the translation initiation codon (12Yamada Y. Mudryj M. de Crombrugghe B. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 14914-14919Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These three mRNAs are coordinately induced in fibrotic processes of various organs (2Schuppan D. Semin. Liver Dis. 1990; 10: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar, 13Niederreither K. D'Souza R. Metsaranta M. Eberspaecher H. Toman P.D. Vuorio E. De Crombrugghe B.

The 5′ stem-loop structure is located about 75 nt from the cap and has a stability of ΔG = 25–30 kcal/mol in different collagen mRNAs. Enzymatic probing of a synthetic 5′ stem-loop RNA demonstrated folding into a higher order structure with a bulged A nucleotide (10Stefanovic B. Hellerbrand C. Brenner D.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4334-4342Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The 5′ stem-loop is well conserved in evolution (15Su M.W. Suzuki H.R. Bieker J.J. Solursh M. Ramirez F. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 565-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 16D'Alessio M. Ramirez F. Suzuki H.R. Solursh M. Gambino R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7050-7054Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but the sequence flanking the stem-loop is not conserved, suggesting an important function. When the 5′ stem-loop is placed in the 5′-UTR of reporter genes, the expression is inhibited in quiescent HSCs but high in activated HSCs. Reporter genes with the mutated stem-loop are constitutively expressed to a high level in both cell types. Therefore, expression of the reporter mRNA with the 5′ stem-loop resembles expression of endogenous collagen α1(I) mRNA in HSCs; it is low in quiescent HSCs and elevated in activated HSCs and regulated by a posttranscriptional mechanism (10Stefanovic B. Hellerbrand C. Brenner D.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4334-4342Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The 5′ stem-loop is also necessary for down-regulating collagen α1(I) expression in a process where cells revert from an activated phenotype to a more quiescent phenotype. This was achieved by culturing mouse fibroblasts within a three-dimensional matrix composed of type I collagen (17Stefanovic B. Lindquist J. Brenner D.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 641-647Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, activated HSCs reverse to a more quiescent phenotype when cultured in matrigel (18Friedman S.L. Roll F.J. Boyles J. Arenson D.M. Bissell D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 10756-10762Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When the 5′ stem-loop was mutated, the full size collagen α1(I) mRNA was more stable in cells grown in the matrix than when this stem-loop was intact (17Stefanovic B. Lindquist J. Brenner D.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 641-647Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the 5′ stem-loop was required for accelerated decay of collagen α1(I) in this experimental system. The collagen 5′ stem-loop binds nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins (10Stefanovic B. Hellerbrand C. Brenner D.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4334-4342Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,17Stefanovic B. Lindquist J. Brenner D.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 641-647Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In quiescent HSCs, no protein binding to the 5′ stem-loop was detected. In activated HSCs, a cytosolic protein factor(s) of unknown identity binds to the stem-loop and requires a 7mG cap on the RNA for binding. A protein of 120 kDa was cross-linked to the 5′ stem-loop of collagen α1(I) mRNA in extracts of activated HSCs (10Stefanovic B. Hellerbrand C. Brenner D.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4334-4342Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The complex is also found in fibroblasts in the postpolysomal cytoplasmic fraction. Its binding is greatly reduced if the cells are cultured in three-dimensional matrix (17Stefanovic B. Lindquist J. Brenner D.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 641-647Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Protein binding to the 5′ stem-loop may increase the steady state level of collagen mRNAs by diverting them from the degradative pathway. Extracts prepared from fibroblasts contain a nuclear protein that binds the collagen 5′ stem-loop. This activity is different from the cytoplasmic binding activity, because it is detected only in nuclear extracts, it does not require the presence of 7mG cap for binding, and it has a different electrophoretic mobility in native gels. The nuclear binding inversely correlates with the accumulation of collagen α1(I) mRNA (17Stefanovic B. Lindquist J. Brenner D.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 641-647Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is possible that after synthesis, the collagen 5′ stem-loop binds this nuclear factor, which may be required for nuclear export of collagen α1(I) mRNA and may accumulate in the nucleus if the cytoplasmic levels of collagen α1(I) mRNA are decreased. Binding of protein factors to the 5′ stem-loop is necessary for high level of expression of collagen α1(I) mRNA in activated HSCs and fibroblasts. Therefore, titration of these proteins by a highly expressed short RNA containing the 5′ stem-loop (a molecular decoy) may decrease the level of α1(I) mRNA and consequently collagen protein synthesis. Here we describe the design and expression of a short stable RNA containing the collagen α1(I) 5′ stem-loop and its effect on collagen type I synthesis in fibroblasts and HSCs. The mouse U7 small nuclear RNA (U7 snRNA) gene with the optimal Sm binding site (p74) was constructed by Dr. C. Grimm (19Grimm C. Stefanovic B. Schumperli D. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1229-1238Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) and was a kind gift of Prof. Dr. D. Schumperli (University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland). The EcoRI-BamHI fragment of this gene was recloned into the EcoRI-BamHI sites of the Bluescript SK+ vector. A double-stranded oligonucleotide with the sequence of mouse collagen α1(I) 5′ stem-loop was cloned in StuI and BspMI sites of the Bluescript construct, creating the p74WT decoy. The nucleotides flanking the 5′ stem-loop were designed to preserve the transcription start site of the gene, the first 5 nt of the RNA, and the optimal Sm binding site. An oligonucleotide with a mutation in the 5′ stem-loop was cloned by an identical procedure to create the p74MUT decoy. The sequences of WT and MUT stem-loop are published (10Stefanovic B. Hellerbrand C. Brenner D.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4334-4342Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recombinant adenoviruses that express p74WT and p74MUT decoys were constructed using the simplified system for generation of adenoviruses (20He T.C. Zhou S. da Costa L.T., Yu, J. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2509-2514Crossref PubMed Scopus (3256) Google Scholar). The Hin dIII-NotI fragments of the p74WT decoy and the p74MUT decoy constructs were recloned into the Hin dIII-NotI sites of the pADTRACK vector. The pADTRACK vector contains green fluorescent protein (GFP) expression cassette under control of cytomegalovirus promoter as a transcription unit that is independent of the cloning of the molecular decoys. The viral genomes were reconstructed by recombination in Escherichia coli between the pADTRACK constructs and pAdEasy-1 plasmid. Viral genomes were packed into infectious particles after transfection into 293 cells. The resulting viruses express both the p74WT or p74MUT decoy and GFP, which serves as a control of infection. Viruses were tested for expression and amplified by the UNC Viral Core facility. HSCs were isolated by perfusion of the livers of adult Sprague-Dawley male rats with collagenase and pronase. The resultant cell suspension was washed and centrifuged over a Stractan gradient as described (8Friedman S.L. Rockey D.C. McGuire R.F. Maher J.J. Boyles J.K. Yamasaki G. Hepatology. 1992; 15: 234-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). HSCs were collected from the 5.5 and 11% stractan interphases and cultured on uncoated plastic tissue culture dishes in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum in a 5% CO2-humidified atmosphere for 2 days. After 2 days, the medium was changed, and the cells were infected with adenoviruses expressing the molecular decoys with a multiplicity of infection of 500. Infection of HSCs with a multiplicity of infection of 500 resulted in GFP expression in 95–100% of the HSCs (not shown). 3–5 days after the infection, the cells were harvested and analyzed for expression of collagen mRNA and protein. Fully activated HSCs were obtained by culturing the cells for 7–14 days. When cellular medium was analyzed, the cells were cultured in 10 mm ascorbic acid 2-phosphate (unhydrolyzable derivative of ascorbic acid; Waco) in 0% serum 24 h before collection of the medium. Human HSCs were isolated by perfusion of surgically removed parts of human liver, as above. These cells were cultured for 7 days before they were infected with adenoviruses. NIH 3T3 fibroblasts were transfected by the calcium phosphate technique, using 10 μg of decoy plasmids and 1 μg of luciferase plasmid (pGL3; Promega) per 100-mm dish as a control for transfection efficiency. After 12 h, the medium was changed, and the cells were harvested after an additional 36 h of culturing. To make stable cell lines, 1 μg of pCDNA3 vector was co-transfected with 10 μg of decoy plasmids into NIH 3T3 fibroblasts, and stable transformants were selected with G418 for 3 weeks. Well isolated clones were expanded and analyzed for decoy expression by RNase protection assays (RPA). Total cellular RNA was isolated by the standard procedure (21Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar). Cytoplasmic and nuclear RNAs were isolated as described by Grimm (19Grimm C. Stefanovic B. Schumperli D. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1229-1238Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Expression of collagen α1(I) mRNAs was measured by RPA, according to our published procedure (9Stefanovic B. Hellerbrand C. Holcik M. Briendl M. Aliebhaber S. Brenner D.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5201-5209Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Collagen-specific probes were hybridized together with a GAPDH probe, as an internal standard, to account for recovery of the RNA. Riboprobes specific for decoy RNAs were derived by transcribing the antisense strand of the p74WT decoy and p74MUT decoy plasmids with T3 RNA polymerase, after linearizing the plasmids with HgaI. Typically, 5–20 μg of total or cytoplasmic RNA were analyzed, and nuclear RNA was analyzed in one-fourth of the amount of its corresponding cytoplasmic sample. This ratio represents the equivalent amounts of RNA that we consistently extracted from the two compartments from 3T3 fibroblasts and HSCs. RT-PCRs for collagen α1(I) mRNA and GAPDH mRNA were done as described (9Stefanovic B. Hellerbrand C. Holcik M. Briendl M. Aliebhaber S. Brenner D.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5201-5209Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For collagen α2(I) mRNA, the primers were TGAATACAACGCAGAAGGGGT (5′ primer) and TTTGAAACAGACAGGGCCAA (3′ primer), which amplify RT-PCR product of 385 nt. For α1(III) mRNA, the primers were GATCAGGCCAATGGCAATGT (5′ primer) and AAAAGCAAACAGGGCCAATG (3′ primer), which amplify RT-PCR product of 259 nt. For interleukin-6 mRNA, the primers were described (22Herfarth H.H. Mohanty S.P. Rath H.C. Tonkonogy S. Sartor R.B. Gut. 1996; 39: 836-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). RT-PCRs were done with 100 ng of total RNA using the rTth reverse transcriptase RNA PCR kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in the presence of 10 μCi of [32P]dCTP, according to the recommended protocol. Gene-specific primers were used together with GAPDH-specific primers, as an internal control, in the same reverse transcription and amplification reaction, which consisted of 20 cycles (1 min at 94 °C, 1 min at 55 °C, and 1 min at 72 °C). The PCR step of 20 cycles is in the linear range of the reaction, and coamplification of GAPDH assures equal loading of RNA. For α1(III) mRNA, 30 cycles were used (1 min at 94 °C, 1 min at 50 °C, and 1 min at 72 °C), and no coamplification with GAPDH primers was done, because 30 cycles is outside the linear range for this mRNA. PCR products were resolved on 6% denaturing acrylamide gels. All gels were quantified by phosphorimaging. 20 μg of cellular proteins were resolved on a 7.5% SDS-PAGE gel under reducing or nonreducing conditions, as indicated. After blotting, the membrane was probed with an antibody raised against human collagen type I (600-401-103; Rockland, Inc., Rockland, PA). This antibody recognizes the pro-α1(I) chain, the mature α1(I) chain, and the heterotrimer of type I collagen. It does not recognize α2(I) chain 2B. Stefanovic, B. Schnabl, and D. A. Brenner, unpublished observations. and does not cross-react with other collagens. Prior to electrophoresis, some samples were digested at room temperature for 30 min with pepsin (1000 units; Sigma) at pH 2.5 or with 7.5 units of bacterial collagenase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), as controls for antibody specificity. Treatment with collagenase resulted in complete loss of signal, whereas treatment with pepsin resulted in reduction of the molecular mass from 170 to 120 kDa (not shown). Collagen in cellular medium was analyzed as above, after concentration of the medium by ultrafiltration (Amicon; cut-off limit 100 kDa). To optimize collagen secretion, the cells were grown in the presence of 10 mm ascorbic acid 2-phosphate, in 0% serum for 24 h before medium collection. The amount of medium that was analyzed on the gel was proportional to the number of cells in a given plate. Western blots were quantified by densitometry. A molecular decoy containing the collagen 5′ stem-loop was based on the modified mouse U7 small nuclear RNA (snRNA) gene. The wild type Sm binding site of this gene was replaced by the optimal Sm binding site (construct p74). This modification rendered this U7 snRNA nonfunctional in histone processing (the normal function of U7 snRNA) but produced a higher accumulation, predominantly in the cell nucleus (19Grimm C. Stefanovic B. Schumperli D. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1229-1238Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The metabolic pathway of snRNAs is shown at the bottom of Fig. 1A. The 5′-end of U7 RNA is free of proteins (23Smith H.O. Tabiti K. Schaffner G. Soldati D. Albrecht U. Birnstiel M.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9784-9788Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) and can accommodate various sequences unrelated to U7 function (24Gorman L. Suter D. Emerick V. Schumperli D. Kole R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4929-4934Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The p74WT decoy was constructed by introducing the 5′ stem-loop of the mouse collagen α1(I) mRNA into the 5′-end of the optimal U7 snRNA gene. This insertion increased the total length of the transcript to 108 nt and did not affect the transcription start site or the sequence of the optimal Sm binding site (Fig. 1A). The p74MUT decoy is identical except that 20 nt of the 5′ stem-loop were mutated to abolish formation of the 5′ stem-loop. This control decoy also has a length of 108 nt (Fig. 1A). Expression of the decoys and their subcellular accumulation was analyzed by transient transfections into NIH 3T3 fibroblasts. Luciferase control gene was cotransfected with the decoy genes to assess transfection efficiency. Cytoplasmic and nuclear RNA were extracted and analyzed by RNase protection assay using decoy-specific riboprobes (Fig. 1B) and GAPDH probe (Fig. 1C) as a control for nuclear and cytoplasmic separation. In several experiments, we consistently extracted about 4-fold more RNA from the cytoplasmic fraction than from the nuclear fraction, so in subsequent experiments we used this ratio as a representative abundance of the RNA in these compartments. Total expression (nuclear + cytoplasmic) of p74MUT decoy was comparable with the expression of p74WT decoy (Fig. 1B). Luciferase activity was also similar in these samples, suggesting similar transfection efficiencies (not shown). The p74MUT decoy accumulated mostly as the RNA of expected size of 108 nt (decoy) and to about the same levels in the nucleus and in the cytoplasm (lanes 3 and 4). p74WT decoy RNA accumulated as a longer species of about 115–120 nt (pre-decoy) as well as the mature size species (decoy). In the cytoplasm, both of these isoforms were found (lane 1), whereas the mature size decoy mostly accumulated in the nucleus (lane 2). The longer isoform of the p74WT decoy presumably contains additional nucleotides at its 3′ end (see “Discussion”). Similar to the p74MUT decoy, 50% of total p74WT decoy was found in the cytoplasm and 50% in the nucleus. GAPDH mRNA showed predominant cytoplasmic accumulation (Fig. 1C), as expected for this mRNA, which suggests minimal cross-contamination of the nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions. From these experiments, we conclude that the collagen 5′ stem-loop can be expressed as a short stable RNA using the optimal U7 snRNA gene. Since it is expressed in both nucleus and cytoplasm, the decoy may encounter nuclear and cytoplasmic collagen 5′ stem-loop-binding proteins. To assess how expression of the p74WT decoy affects the expression of endogenous collagen α1(I) mRNA, we developed NIH 3T3 cell lines that stably express the p74WT decoy and p74MUT decoy. Fig. 2A shows an experiment where we characterized one cell line expressing a high level of the p74WT decoy (lane 1, WT#1), a control cell line not expressing a decoy (lane 2, −), and two cell lines expressing the p74MUT decoy (lanes 3 and 4, MUT#1 and MUT#2). Decoy expression was analyzed in total RNA, and a longer isoform of the p74WT decoy was detected (Fig. 2A, pre-DECOY). For analysis of endogenous collagen α1(I) mRNA, nuclear and cytoplasmic RNAs were extracted from the same cell lines and probed with riboprobes specific for mouse collagen α1(I) mRNA and GAPDH mRNA, as a control for loading. Fig. 2B demonstrates that the expression of p74WT decoy decreased the cytoplasmic levels of endogenous collagen α1(I) mRNA (Fig. 2B,lane 1), compared with the level in cells without decoy (lane 3) and in cells expressing the p74MUT decoy (lanes 5 and 7). Collagen α1(I) mRNA in the nucleus is not affected by the decoy (lanes 2, 4, 6, and 8). The band indicated with an asterisk is a nonspecific band present when tRNA is probed with the same riboprobes and compared with total RNA from NIH 3T3 fibroblasts (compare lanes 9 and 10). Additional cell lines of NIH 3T3 fibroblasts expressing the p74WT and p74MUT decoy were developed, and cytoplasmic RNA was analyzed for expression of endogenous collagen α1(I) mRNA (Fig. 2C). All cell lines expressing the p74WT decoy (WT#2 to WT#6) had a decreased level of collagen α1(I) mRNA to about 40% of the level seen in the cell lines expressing the p74MUT decoy (MUT#3 and MUT#4). From these experiments, we conclude that a high level of p74WT decoy down-regulates the cytoplasmic level of collagen α1(I) mRNA. Decreased cytoplasmic levels of collagen α1(I) mRNA may result in diminished synthesis of collagen protein. Therefore, we analyzed cellular medium of the cell lines WT#1 and MUT#1 for accumulation of procollagen by Western blot. Prior to harvesting the medium, the cells were grown for 24 h in presence of ascorbic acid 2-phosphate, to maximize the synthesis and secretion of triple-helical collagen (25Blanck T.J. Peterkofsky B. Arch Biochem. Biophys. 1975; 171: 259-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Equivalent amounts of cellular medium are resolved under reducing conditions (Fig. 2D). Cells expressing the p74WT decoy secreted 50% less procollagen than cells expressing the p74MUT decoy (compare lane 1 with lane 2). We concluded that p74WT decoy can inhibit collagen α1(I) mRNA and collagen protein secretion by NIH 3T3 fibroblasts. Specific inhibition of fibrillar collagen expression in HSCs is one of the goals for therapy of liver fibrosis. To express molecular decoys in HSCs, we constructed adenoviruses expressing the p74WT decoy and the p74MUT mutant decoy. The viruses also express GFP from an independent transcription unit, so that GFP can serve as a marker for efficiency of infection. We infected rat HSCs at day 7 after isolation with viruses expressing the decoys and analyzed decoy RNA expression by RNase protection assays at 4 days postinfection (Fig. 3A). Control decoy (p74MUT,lane 2) was expressed at a 1.25-fold higher level than the decoy with the 5′ stem-loop (p74WT, lane 1). The p74WT decoy accumulated partly as a longer precursor RNA (predecoy). Infection efficiency of both decoys was similar as judged by expression of GFP from the same samples (Fig. 3B). Having established that the decoys can be expressed in HSCs, we assessed their effectiveness in inhibiting collagen type I expression during culture activation of rat HSCs. Freshly isolated quiescent HSCs change to an activated phenotype when plated on plastic. During this process, collagen type I expression progressively increases from day 3 and reaches the maximum expression at day 7 after plating (8Friedman S.L. Rockey D.C. McGuire R.F. Maher J.J. Boyles J.K. Yamasaki G. Hepatology. 1992; 15: 234-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). To assess the inhibitory potential of molecular decoys during this activation, we infected HSCs at day 2 after plating with adenoviruses expressing the p74WT decoy and p74MUT decoy with a multiplicity of infection of 500. This resulted in 95% of cells expressing GFP at the time of analysis. The cells were further cultured until day 7 (5 days after infection with the viruses), when nuclear and cytoplasmic RNA was extracted and analyzed for expression of endogenous collagen α1(I) mRNA and GAPDH mRNA, as a control for loading. The results of one such experiment are sho"

The catalytic domain of all known MMPs contains an active site zinc that binds to three conserved histidines in the HE XXH XXG XXH(S/T)X5M zinc-binding motif (1Nagase H. Woessner J.F., Jr. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21491-21494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3826) Google Scholar, 13Massova I. Kotra L.P. Fridman R. Mobashery S. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 1075-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar). With the exception of MMP-23 (14Pei D. Kang T. Qi H. J. Biol.

Chem. 1999; 274: 4570-4576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), the prodomain of all known MMPs has a highly conserved free cysteine residue within the consensus PRC XXPD sequence motif (13Massova I. Kotra L.P. Fridman R. Mobashery S. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 1075-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar). This motif regularly called the cysteine-switch (16Van Wart H.E. Birkedal-Hansen H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5578-5582Crossref PubMed Scopus (1182) Google Scholar) has been proposed to prevent latent enzymes from becoming inappropriately active by binding to the catalytic zinc atom. The cysteine residue of the PRC XXPD motif can interact with the zinc ion of the catalytic domain and provide the fourth coordination site for the catalytic zinc ion. The cysteine residue may act in concert with other residues to maintain the conformation of the prodomain and shield the enzyme's active site from substrates. MMPs become functionally active when proteolytic cleavage releases the prodomain, exposing the zinc atom and freeing the active site to interact with substrate (1Nagase H. Woessner J.F., Jr. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21491-21494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3826) Google Scholar). Recently, we and other authors identified the human genes coding for novel matrix metalloproteinase, MMP-26 (endometase; matrilysin-2) (2Marchenko G.N. Ratnikov B.I. Rozanov D.V. Godzik A. Deryugina E.I. Strongin A.Y. Biochem. J. 2001; 356: 705-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar,17de Coignac A.B. Elson G. Delneste Y. Magistrelli G. Jeannin P. Aubry J.P. Berthier O.

Remarkably, proMMP-26 exhibited the unique PHCGVPD cysteine-switch motif. The presence of His81 but not Arg in this motif distinguishes proMMP-26 from all other proMMPs known so far. Our earlier studies demonstrated relatively close relations of MMP-26 with MMP-7 (matrilysin) (2Marchenko G.N. Ratnikov B.I. Rozanov D.V. Godzik A. Deryugina E.I. Strongin A.Y. Biochem. J. 2001; 356: 705-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). It is likely that MMP-7 and MMP-26 are both apically secreted by tumor cells in vivo (20Fingleton B. Vargo-Gogola T. Crawford H.C. Matrisian L.M. Neoplasia. 2001; 3: 459-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). In contrast, most other soluble MMPs in tumors are made by stromal cells, not carcinoma cells (5Heppner K.J. Matrisian L.M. Jensen R.A. Rodgers W.H. Am. J. Pathol. 1996; 149: 273-282PubMed Google Scholar). Expression of MMP-26 is largely restricted to carcinomas of epithelial origin (21Marchenko G.N. Marchenko N.D. Strongin A.Y. Biochem. J. 2002; 363: 253-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Computer modeling of MMP-26 led us to a hypothesis that the prodomain of MMP-26 must undergo significant rearrangements to stabilize the cysteine-switch relative to the catalytic zinc (2Marchenko G.N. Ratnikov B.I. Rozanov D.V. Godzik A. Deryugina E.I. Strongin A.Y. Biochem. J. 2001; 356: 705-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Conversely, the prodomain fold of MMP-26 with the non-functioning cysteine-switch is likely to be distinct from that of other MMPs leading to the suggestion that this protease employs the alternative mechanisms to maintain its activation or the proenzyme state. Our findings reported here suggest that the unique PHCG XXD sequence is not involved in the latency of proMMP-26 and that the activated species of MMP-26 retains the cysteine-switch motif. All reagents for molecular cloning except AdvanTaq™ Plus DNA polymerase used in PCR (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) were purchased from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). The individual catalytic domain of MT2-MMP, MT3-MMP, MT4-MMP, and a hydroxamate inhibitor (GM6001) were from Chemicon (Temecula, CA). The individual catalytic domain of MT1-MMP was prepared as described earlier (2Marchenko G.N. Ratnikov B.I. Rozanov D.V. Godzik A. Deryugina E.I. Strongin A.Y. Biochem. J. 2001; 356: 705-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The fluorescence peptide substrate Mca-Pro-Leu-Gly-Leu-Dpa-Ala-Arg-NH2 (where Mca is 7-methoxycoumarin and Dpa is 3-(2,4-dinitrophenyl)diaminopropionic acid) was from Bachem (King of Prussia, PA). Other chemicals were from Sigma. TIMP-2-free proMMP-2 was isolated from conditioned medium of p2AHT2A72 cells derived from HT-1080 fibrosarcoma cell line sequentially transfected with E1A and MMP-2 cDNA (22Strongin A.Y. Collier I. Bannikov G. Marmer B.L. Grant G.A. Goldberg G.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5331-5338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1432) Google Scholar). Cloning of the full-length proMMP-26 cDNA was described previously (3Marchenko G.N. Strongin A.Y. Gene (Amst.). 2001; 265: 87-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The fragments of the proMMP-26 cDNA encoding the wild type catalytic domain (catMMP-26-WT) and the proenzyme lacking the signal peptide were amplified by PCR and recloned for the subsequent expression in Escherichia coli into the pET21a(+) vector (Novagen, Madison, WI). PCR mutagenesis was used to replace His81 of the putative Pro-His81-Cys-Gly-Val-Pro-Asp “cysteine switch” motif with the Arg residue in the sequence of proMMP-26 as well as to construct the C-terminally truncated catMMP-26-ΔHLYGEKCSSDIP mutant and the mutants with the modified C-terminal region such as catMMP-26-LYG KN, catMMP-26-LYG KNSRPGTCRSR, and catMMP-26-LYG LEHHHHHH (modified amino acid residue positions are italicized). All constructs were sequenced to exclude PCR errors. The wild type and mutant MMP-26 were expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) cells on induction with 2.5 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside as insoluble inclusions. After incubation for 3–5 h at 37 °C, E. coli cells were collected by centrifugation and resuspended in 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.6, followed by sonication of the suspension and centrifugation at 14,000 × g. The pellet (insoluble inclusions) containing denatured MMP-26 was additionally purified by using a Bug Buster HT protein extraction reagent (Novagen). Purified inclusion bodies were solubilized in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 8 m urea and 10 mm DTT, and subjected to ion-exchange chromatography on a 1 × 5-cm Mono Q column (Amersham Biosciences). The bound material was eluted with a linear 0–500 mm NaCl gradient. The eluted fractions were analyzed for the presence of MMP-26 by SDS-PAGE and gelatin zymography. To refold the MMP-26, the fractions containing the purified material were combined, 2-fold diluted in Buffer A (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, 10 mm CaCl2, 50 μmZnCl2, 0.01% Brij 35) containing 1 mm DTT, and then dialyzed overnight against Buffer A without DTT at 4 °C. The refolded MMP-26 samples were immediately used in our assays. The enzymatic activity was measured using quenched fluorescent peptide substrate. Fluorescence measurements were made on a fMax fluorescence microplate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) by following excitation/emission at 328/405 nm in 96-well plates at 37 °C. The reaction mixture (100 μl) in Buffer A contained 2 μm substrate and refolded MMP-26 (100 ng). The activation products of proMMP26 were subjected to SDS-PAGE, transferred on to an Immobilon membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA), and stained with Coomassie. After destaining, the stained bands were excised and subjected to the N-terminal protein sequencing. ProMMP-26 and proMMP-2 (100 ng each in Buffer A) were treated for 4 h at ambient temperature with 2 mm 4-aminophenylmercuric acetate (APMA). Alternatively, proMMP26 (100 ng in Buffer A) was processed with N-tosyl-l-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone-treated bovine trypsin (5 ng, the enzyme-substrate ratio ∼1:20) for 0.1–24 h at ambient temperature. The reaction was stopped by adding 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Additionally, proMMP-26 (100 ng in Buffer A) was incubated at 37 °C for 16 h at the approximately 1:3 enzyme-substate ratio with the individual catalytic domain of each MT1-MMP, MT2-MMP, MT3-MMP, and MT4-MMP or the activated MMP-2 enzyme. The digested samples were mixed with an equal volume of 2 × SDS-PAGE sample buffer (125 mmTris-HCl, pH 6.8, 4% SDS, 0.005% bromphenol blue, and 20% glycerol) containing 20 mm DTT, boiled for 5 min, and examined by SDS-PAGE (4–20% polyacrylamide) (Novex, San Diego, CA) and by gelatin zymography in 0.1% gelatin, 15% polyacrylamide gels. Regularly, the gels were stained with Coomassie or, where indicated, with Silver Xpress stain (Novex). Purified proMMP2 (23Deryugina E.I. Ratnikov B. Monosov E. Postnova T.I. DiScipio R. Smith J.W. Strongin A.Y. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 263: 209-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar) was used as control in our activation studies. Protein concentration was measured with Coomassie protein assay reagent (Pierce). Modeling of the region involving the cysteine-switch motif and the active site zinc allows us to speculate that the proMMP-26 prodomain fold is distinct from that of other MMPs. Thus, in the structure of related MMP-7, a β-strand from the prodomain blocks the active site (Fig.1). The position of this β-strand is stabilized by the ion pair involving Arg81 and Asp86 and is surrounded by a hydrophobic cluster composed of Phe40 and Phe61. All these residues are conserved in MMPs with the exception of MMP-26 (Arg81 → His81). Substitutions existing in the MMP-26 prodomain result in a partially unfolded β-strand. Because the histidine side chain is short, the Arg81 → His81substitution precludes the formation of both the ion pair with the Asp86 and the hydrophobic cluster involving the phenylalanine residues. Simple minimization does not improve the packing of the MMP-26 prodomain suggesting that the prodomain must undergo larger rearrangements to maintain the proenzyme state. Limitations of the current algorithms do not allow us to model the rearrangements involved in the stabilization of MMP-26. However, it could be concluded that the prodomain fold of MMP-26 is likely to be different relative to that of other MMPs, especially at high pH when His81 is not protonated. Consequently, analysis of proMMP-26 and identification of the mechanisms involved in its activation are of interest. These studies may facilitate rational manipulation of this protease in a clinically advantageous manner and understanding of its function in vivo. Because the yield of MMP-26 expressed in mammalian systems was low, we employed a bacterial expression system to generate the full-length MMP-26 zymogen and the truncated species of MMP-26 representing its individual catalytic domain (catMMP-26). To characterize the catalytic activity and the activation mechanisms of MMP-26, we expressed, solubilized, purified, and refolded both the wild type proMMP-26-WT and catMMP-26-WT. Following induction with isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside, both forms of MMP-26 were found highly expressed in E. coli as insoluble inclusions. On solubilization in 8 m urea both proMMP-26-WT and catMMP-26-WT could be purified under denaturing conditions to give a major band at the molecular mass of 28 and 19 kDa when analyzed by SDS-PAGE under non-reducing conditions, respectively (Fig.2A). Following transfer to a membrane, the main MMP-26 forms were analyzed by the N-terminal sequencing. The N-terminal sequencing further confirmed that the 28-kDa band corresponded to proMMP-26-WT (Met-Val18-Pro-Val-Pro-Pro-Ala) whereas the 19-kDa form represented the catMMP-26-WT species (Met-Thr90-Ser-Ile-Ser-Xaa-Gly) (Fig. 2A). As expected, both forms exhibited one extra initiation codon coded for a methionine residue. Both proMMP-26-WT and catMMP-26-WT exhibited gelatinolytic activity in gelatin zymography (Fig. 2A). Generally, activation of latent zymogens of MMPs requires cleavage of the N-terminal propart by an external protease or by intramolecular autocatalytic mechanisms induced by organomercurial compounds (24Murphy G. Stanton H. Cowell S. Butler G. Knauper V. Atkinson S. Gavrilovic J. APMIS (Acta Pathol. Microbiol. Immunol. Scand.). 1999; 107: 38-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). These compounds modify the thiol group of the unique free cysteine residue of the PRC XXPD cysteine-switch sequence. The treatment of the refolded proMMP-26-WT with organomercurials such as APMA, which are known to result in the activation of other members of the MMP family or proteases including trypsin, MT1-MMP, MT2-MMP, MT3-MMP, MT4-MMP, MMP-2, and catMMP-26-WT failed to induce the activation of proMMP-26-WT. Thus, the individual catalytic domain of MT1-MMP degraded proMMP-26-WT without generating the stable proteolytic fragments that might correspond to the active MMP-26 enzyme (Fig. 2B). The cleavage profile of proMMP-26-WT treated with other MT-MMPs was highly similar. The treatment of proMMP-26-WT with individual MT-MMPs did not enhance the proteolytic activity against the fluorescence peptide substrates (data not shown). In turn, proMMP-2 used as control in our studies was activated either by APMA or MT1-MMP and readily converted into the known activated species of MMP-2 (Fig. 2D). The catMMP-26-WT generated multiple cleavage products of proMMP-26-WT (data not shown) suggesting a possibility for an autocatalytic intramolecular pathway. To identify a functional significance of the highly unusual His81 (underlined) of the PHCGVPD cysteine-switch, we performed site-directed mutagenesis of proMMP-26-WT to restore the conventional PRCGVPD motif in the mutant (proMMP-26-Arg) prodomain. This motif is conserved in all proMMPs except MMP-26. The mutant was expressed in E. coli as insoluble inclusions, solubilized, purified, and refolded as described for proMMP-26-WT. However, the pro-MMP-26-Arg mutant also resisted activation by any tested MMPs and was significantly more sensitive to trypsin suggesting that the mutation destabilized the mutant construct (data not shown). Remarkably, the treatment of either proMMP-26-WT or proMMP-26-Arg with APMA also failed to induce limited proteolysis and activation of the zymogen (Fig. 2D). No increase in the proteolytic activity of proMMP-26-WT or proMMP-26-Arg was observed following APMA treatment. To further confirm that APMA did not induce activation of proMMP-26-WT, we identified the N-terminal peptide sequence of the APMA-treated samples. This sequence (18MVPVPP) confirmed the presence of the zymogen with the intact N terminus. Thus, the restoration of the conventional cysteine-switch motif failed to induce the cysteine-switch activation mechanism of mutant proMMP-26. Conversion of proMMP-26 into the active enzyme was most efficiently accomplished by concentration-dependent autoproteolysis. Thus, self-activation of the refolded proMMP-26-WT at 0.1 mg/ml was accomplished in about 7–10 days in Buffer A at 4 °C. At 1 mg/ml proMMP-26-WT is fully autolytically processed in several hours (Fig. 2,C and E). Autoactivation was completely inhibited by 1 μm GM6001, a hydroxamate inhibitor of MMPs. SDS-PAGE of self-activated proMMP-26-WT confirmed the presence of the forms with the molecular mass in the range of 18–29 kDa. The expected molecular mass of the enzyme of MMP-26 cleaved downstream of the cysteine-switch motif is about 19 kDa. The C and D species with molecular masses of 19 and 17 kDa, respectively, were most active in gelatin zymography (Fig.2E). Importantly, the species of MMP-26 with the molecular mass below 18 kDa exhibited no gelatinolytic activity, thereby representing inactive degradation by-products. Self-activation of proMMP-26 correlated to an increase in the proteolytic activity of the samples. The specific activity of self-activated proMMP-26 was lower than but still comparable with that of catMMP-26-WT (Fig.2C). This activity was fully suppressed by 1 μm GM6001 or 100 ng/ml TIMP-2. To identify the N terminus of active MMP-26, we subjected the gelatinolytically active forms to the N-terminal sequencing. The proenzyme had the expected 18MVPVPP sequence whereas the cleavage products demonstrated the same N-terminal peptide sequence (60QFHRN) localized upstream of the cysteine-switch motif. These findings suggest the presence of the cysteine-switch motif in all proteolytically active forms of MMP-26. Further, the difference in the molecular mass of the activation products indicated the C-terminal processing of autolytically activated proMMP-26-WT. To support our data, we fully denatured proMMP-26-WT by SDS followed by protease renaturation and self-proteolysis. For these purposes, proMMP-26-WT was separated in gelatin gel, and the gelatinolytically active proMMP-26 band was excised from the gel, minced, and again denatured by resuspending the sample in 2× SDS-sample buffer. Further, the sample was subjected to gelatin zymography. The observed gelatinolytically active activation products were highly similar to those that resulted from self-activation at 4 °C. Hence, these observations strongly support our hypothesis that the active forms of MMP-26 preserve the cysteine-switch sequence and that the next shorter activation product unavoidably loses the activity. These findings agree with our computer modeling studies and with the resistance of proMMP-26 to organomercurials and suggest that the PHCGVPD cysteine-switch motif is not functional in proMMP-26 and that the cysteine residue is not involved in the maintenance of the proenzyme state. It is likely that similarly to bacterial metalloproteinases (e.g. prothermolysin), which do not exhibit the cysteine-switch motif, proMMP-26 can naturally mature via an autocatalytic intramolecular pathway (25Marie-Claire C. Roques B.P. Beaumont A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5697-5701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it is tempting to hypothesize that if the fold of proMMP-26 is relatively similar to that of other MMPs, the four histidine residues existing in proMMP-26 (the three from the active site domain and the one from the cysteine-switch motif) may all directly interact with the zinc atom similarly to those observed in the Zn2+ finger motifs. Our data suggest the autolytic cleavage of the C-terminal HLYGEKCSSDIP sequence of MMP-26 and a possible functional role of the Cys256 residue. We speculated that the C-terminal portion of MMP-26 is important for the folding of the enzyme. To address this question we constructed the following catMMP-26 mutants with the truncated or modified C-terminal region, catMMP-26-ΔHLYGEKCSSDIP, -LYG KN, -LYG KNSRPGTCRSR, and -LYG LEHHHHHH (modified residues are italicized) (Fig. 2C). The constructs were expressed in E. coli as insoluble inclusions, solubilized, purified, and refolded as described for catMMP-26-WT (Fig.3). Following refolding, only the catMMP-26-LYG KN and -LYG KNSRPGTCRS mutants demonstrated the proteolytic activity. The activity level of these mutants was similar to that of catMMP-26-WT whereas both other mutants (catMMP-26-ΔHLYGEKCSSDIP and -LYG LEHHHHHH) were completely inactive both in gelatin zymography and activity assay (Fig. 3). These findings suggest that the C-terminal portion including the LYG sequence, which is highly conserved among all MMPs, affects the folding rather than the activity of the catMMP-26 constructs. The peptide sequence downstream the conserved LYG is less critical for the folding: the presence of the Cys256 is not essential; however, the existence of the positively charged Lys258 facilitates the folding of MMP-26. The strong positive charge in the C-terminal LYGKRSNSRKK peptide sequence of MMP-7 (GenBankTM accession number P09237) supports our suggestions. Presumably, the C-terminal region acts as an intramolecular chaperone in vivo. However, if the folding is completed, this sequence may be truncated (autolytically or by an external protease) without significantly affecting the catalytic efficiency of the resulting construct. In conclusion, we suggest that proMMP-26 could be autolytically activated by the mechanisms, which do not involve the cysteine-switch. Prior studies have shown that the disruption of the Cys-Zn2+ coordination alone is not sufficient to activate MMP-3 (stromelysin 1) (29Chen L.C. Noelken M.E. Nagase H. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 10289-10295Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) and that time-dependent conformational changes (probably involving the Arg81 to Asp86 salt bridge; numbering is given according to the MMP-26 peptide sequence) are needed prior to the expression of proteolytic activity (30Galazka G. Windsor L.J. Birkedal-Hansen H. Engler J.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11221-11227Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The functionality of the cysteine-switch motif in tumor necrosis factor-αconverting enzyme (TACE)/adisintegrin and metalloproteinase (ADAM) family members is posing a question regarding its role in the folding of the latent zymogens (31Milla M.E. Leesnitzer M.A. Moss M.L. Clay W.C. Carter H.L. Miller A.B., Su, J.-L. Lambert M.H. Willard D.H. Sheeley D.M. Kost T.A. Burkhart W. Moyer M. Blackburn R.K. Pahel G.L. Mitchell J.L. Hoffman C.R.

Modeling of the MMP-26 structure and wet chemistry experiments suggest that both the presence of the His81 but not the Arg81 and the folding of the prodomain of MMP-26 eliminated the cysteine-switch mechanism in this proteinase, which evolved to adapt a distinct activation pathway. To this end, the catalytic domain of MMP-26 is 45% identical to that of MMP-7 whereas the identity of the prodomain of MMP-26 to that of MMP-7 is hardly seen and is significantly below 20%. It is tempting to hypothesize that the Arg → His substitution existing in the unique Pro-His81-Cys-Gly-Xaa-Xaa-Asp cysteine-switch motif of proMMP-26 abolished the ability of the Cys82 to interact with the zinc ion of catalytic domain and that the cysteine-switch motif is not involved in the maintenance of the proenzyme state of MMP-26.

To determine the signaling mechanisms of ML-1, we investigated activation of mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases induced by ML-1. Results show that ML-1 induces in a time-dependent fashion the expression of IL-6 and IL-8 in both primary bronchial epithelial cells (PBECs) and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs).

Selective MAP kinase kinase (MEK)1/2 inhibitors, PD98059 and U0126, inhibited, in a dose-dependent manner, ML-1-induced expression of IL-6 and IL-8.

Whereas IL-17 expression is restricted to activated PBMCs and activated Th0 cells, but not activated Th2 cells, ML-1 is expressed in various cell types and tissues. ML-1 is expressed in liver, lung, ovary, and fetal liver, in contrast to IL-17. It is also expressed in activated CD4+ T cells, basophils, PBMCs, and mast cells (9Li H. Chen J. Huang A. Stinson J.

In contrast to ML-1 and IL-17, two other members of the IL-17 family, IL-17B and IL-17C, were not detected in activated CD4+ T cells (9Li H. Chen J. Huang A. Stinson J. Heldens S. Foster J. Dowd P.

ML-1 is able to induce IL-6, IL-8, and intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1 in primary bronchial epithelial cells, and its gene expression is significantly up-regulated in bronchial alveolar lavage cells of asthmatic subjects following segmental allergen challenge (5Kawaguchi M.

The molecular nature of the receptor for ML-1 is at present unclear, and the signaling pathways involved are as yet to be discovered. The MAP kinase family, including extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2, p38 MAP kinase, and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), has been shown to play significant roles in mediating signals triggered by cytokines, growth factors, and environmental stress and are involved in various cellular functions (12Reibman J.

To examine the role of MAP kinase activation in ML-1-induced signaling, we investigated whether ML-1 induces IL-6 and IL-8 expression via activation of MAP kinases in both primary bronchial epithelial cells (PBECs) and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). In this communication, we demonstrate for the first time that ML-1-induced expression of IL-6 and IL-8 is mediated through the activation of ERK1/2 in both cell types. Human recombinant ML-1 was generated as described previously (5Kawaguchi M. Li L. Onuchic X.D. Essayan D.M. Schroeder J. Xiao H.Q. Liu M.C. Krishnaswamy G. Germino G. Huang S.K. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 4430-4435Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). The coding sequence of ML-1 was amplified by PCR and subcloned into pcDNA 3.1 (Invitrogen) to generate a C-terminal His fusion gene. The vector pcDNA 3.1 was transfected into COS-7 cells by an Effectene Reagent (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. ML-1 was purified with affinity purification by Ni-NTA-agarose beads (Qiagen) for His-tagged proteins. Then the concentration of ML-1 protein was quantified by Bradford assay (Bio-Rad), and the protein was stored at −80 °C until used. PBECs were purchased from Clonetics (San Diego, CA) and were cultured in bronchial epithelial basal medium (Clonetics) containing 0.5 ng/ml human recombinant epidermal growth factor (EGF), 52 μg/ml bovine pituitary extract, 0.1 ng/ml retinoic acid, 0.5 μg/ml hydrocortisone, 5 μg/ml insulin, 10 μg/ml transferrin, 0.5 μg/ml epinephrine, 6.5 ng/ml triiodothyronine, 50 μg/ml gentamicin, and 50 pg/ml amphotericin-B (Clonetics). HUVECs were obtained from Clonetics. The cells were cultured in endothelial cell growth medium (EGM; Clonetics), containing 12 μg/ml bovine brain extract, 10 ng/ml EGF, 1 μg/ml hydrocortisone, 50 μg/ml gentamicin, 50 ng/ml amphotericin B, and 5% fetal bovine serum amphotericin-B (Clonetics). Both PBECs and HUVECs were incubated at 37 °C in humidified 5% CO2 and cultured for no more than three passages prior to the analysis. PBECs and HUVECs were treated with 10 or 100 ng/ml ML-1 over several time points. For analysis of gene expression, total RNA was extracted using RNeasy (Qiagen) from 1 × 106 cells 4 h after stimulation or exchange of media. The protocol for cDNA synthesis was the same as described previously (5Kawaguchi M. Li L. Onuchic X.D. Essayan D.M. Schroeder J. Xiao H.Q. Liu M.C. Krishnaswamy G. Germino G. Huang S.K. J.

The sequences of PCR primers for IL-6: forward, 5′-ATGAACTCCTTCTCCACAAGCGC-3′ and reverse, 5′-GAAGAGCCCTCAGGCTGGACTG-3′ and IL-8: forward, 5′-TCTGCAGCTCTGTGTGAAG-3′ and reverse, 5′-TAATTTCTGTGTTGGCGCA-3′. The amplification reaction was performed for 23 cycles with denaturation at 94 °C for 45 s, annealing at 56 °C for 45 s, and extension at 72 °C for 45 s. PCR products were detected by ethidium bromide staining and normalized by the intensity of an amplified housekeeping gene, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, as described previously (5Kawaguchi M. Li L. Onuchic X.D. Essayan D.M. Schroeder J. Xiao H.Q. Liu M.C. Krishnaswamy G. Germino G. Huang S.K. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 4430-4435Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). The expected size for IL-8 was 154 bp, for IL-6, 628 bp, and for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, 450 bp. IL-6 and IL-8 protein levels in the collected supernatants were determined with a commercially available ELISA kit (BIOSOURCE, Camarillo, CA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. For analysis of activation of MAP kinases, PBECs were treated with ML-1 (100 ng/ml) for several time periods and in some cases with or without treatment with the MEK1/2 inhibitors, PD98059 and U0126 (1–50 and 0.1–10 μm, respectively; Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA; Refs. 16Alessi D.R.

The final concentration of Me2SO did not exceed 0.1% (v/v). Following treatment, the cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and the cell pellets were immediately lysed in cold lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 4 mmEDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 100 μg/ml aprotinin, 200 μg/ml leupeptin, 50 mm NaF, 5 mmNa4P2O7, 1 mmNa3VO4, and 1% Nonidet P-40; all purchased from Sigma). Extracts (1 × 106 cell equivalents/lane) were suspended with an equal volume of 2× loading buffer (0.1m Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 4% SDS, 0.005% bromphenol blue, and 20% glycerol) containing 2-mercaptoethanol (0.7 m) and were subjected to 4–20% Tris-glycine gel electrophoresis (NOVEX, San Diego, CA). Gels were then transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Bio-Rad) with a Trans Blot apparatus (NOVEX). The membranes were immersed overnight in Tris-buffered saline/Tween 20 containing 5% nonfat dry skim milk (Carnation, Los Angeles, CA). Immunoreactive proteins were detected using Abs against various kinases and phosphorylated kinases. The Abs used were rabbit anti-ERK1/2 Ab, anti-phospho-ERK1/2 Ab, anti-p38 Ab, anti-JNK Ab, and anti-phospho-JNK Ab (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA), and rabbit anti-phospho-p38 Ab (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). All Abs were suspended in Tris-buffered saline/Tween 20 containing 5% skim milk for 1 h. After washing, the membranes were incubated with peroxidase-linked donkey anti-rabbit Ig Ab (Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h. After washing, membrane-bound anti-rabbit Ig Ab was visualized with enhanced chemiluminescence. Western blotting detection reagents (Amersham Biosciences) and Hyper ECL luminescence detection film (Amersham Biosciences) were used. A panel of kinase protein controls was included and run in parallel. These controls included nonphosphorylated and phosphorylated ERK2 proteins, phosphorylated JNK control cellular extracts from UV-treated 293 cells, and phosphorylated p38 control cellular extracts from anisomycin-treated C-6 glioma cells. (All controls were purchased from New England Biolabs.) The statistical significance of differences was determined by analysis of variance (ANOVA). Any difference withp values less than 0.05 was considered significant. When ANOVA indicated a significant difference, the Scheffe F-test was used to determine the difference between groups. Stimulation of PBECs and HUVECs with ML-1 elicited a time-dependent increase in IL-6 and IL-8 production (Fig.1). ML-1 significantly induced IL-6 and IL-8 production at two different doses (10 and 100 ng/ml) and at two different time points (24 and 48 h). A significant induction of IL-8 production from both cell types was seen at a 12-h time point at a dose of 100 ng/ml. To determine the signaling pathway involved in ML-1-induced cytokine expression, untreated or ML-1-stimulated cells were lysed at various time points, and Western blotting analyses were performed using various Abs against members of the MAP kinase family, namely ERK1/2, p38, and JNK. Whereas no activation of p38 and JNK kinases was seen at any time points (Fig.2, A and B), even after a 4-h stimulation of the cells with ML-1, Western blotting analysis revealed the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 reached a maximum at 20 and 10 min in PBECs and HUVECs, respectively and returned to baseline levels by 60 min (Fig. 2, A and B). In addition, preincubation of the cells with a MEK inhibitor, PD98059 (10 μm), diminished the activation of ERK1/2 in both PBECs and HUVECs, and preincubation of Me2SO did not affect the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 (Fig. 2, C and D).Figure 2Kinetic activation of ERK1/2 by ML-1 in PBECs (A) and HUVECs (B).The cells were incubated with or without ML-1 (100 ng/ml) for different time points as indicated. Western blotting analysis was performed with Abs against different MAP kinases as indicated, and various kinase control proteins and cellular extracts were included as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Effect of PD98059 on ML-1-induced phosphorylation of ERK1/2 in PBECs (C) and HUVECs (D) is shown. The cells were preincubated with PD98059 (10 μm) or Me2SO vehicle (DMSO) control for 1 h, followed by stimulation of PBECs and HUVECs with medium or ML-1 for 20 or 10 min, respectively. The results shown are representative of three separate experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We next asked whether the activation of ERK1/2 was necessary for the stimulation of IL-6 and IL-8 production in both cell types. The cells were stimulated with ML-1 in the presence or the absence of PD98059. As demonstrated in Fig. 3, PD98059 inhibited, in a dose-dependent manner, the production of both IL-6 and IL-8, whereas pretreatment of the cells with Me2SO did not affect cytokine protein release in both PBECs and HUVECs (Fig. 3, A and B). Decreased levels of gene expression for both IL-6 and IL-8 were also noted in PD98059-treated but not in vehicle-treated cells, suggesting that the inhibitory effect was at the level of transcription (Fig. 3,C and D). This inhibitory effect of PD98059 was further confirmed by the use of an additional inhibitor, U0126 (Fig. 3,A and B). ML-1 is a new cytokine produced by activated CD4+ T cells, basophils, PBMCs, and mast cells, and increased expression of the ML-1 gene was seen at sites of allergen challenge in four asthmatic subjects, suggesting its role in allergic inflammatory responses (5Kawaguchi M. Li L. Onuchic X.D. Essayan D.M. Schroeder J. Xiao H.Q. Liu M.C. Krishnaswamy G. Germino G. Huang S.K. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 4430-4435Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). However, the biological function of ML-1 in homeostasis and in disease, such as airway inflammation, is not completely understood. Also, the sequence of ML-1 is shorter than that of IL-17F (5Kawaguchi M. Li L. Onuchic X.D. Essayan D.M. Schroeder J. Xiao H.Q. Liu M.C. Krishnaswamy G. Germino G. Huang S.K. J.

We demonstrate, in this report, that ML-1 is able to induce both IL-6 and IL-8 production through the activation of the ERK1/2 kinase in PBECs and HUVECs. MAP kinases are known to play a central role in the airway epithelial activation in response to various stimuli such as TNF-α, IL-1, diesel exhaust particles, and influenza virus infection (12Reibman J.

In our study, the involvement of ERK kinase, but not p38 or JNK, in ML-1-induced IL-6 and IL-8 production was demonstrated using primary bronchial epithelial cells and endothelial cells. Interestingly, previous data showed that ERK1/2, but not p38 or JNK, may play an important role in cytokine release in primary epithelial cells (12Reibman J. Talbot A.T. Ou Y. Hsu G. Jover J. Nilsen D. Pillinger M.H. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 1618-1625Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), although all three members of the MAP kinase family are involved in cytokine expression. Indeed IL-17, which shows high homology with ML-1, also activates only ERK1/2 kinase in PBECs (18Kawaguchi M. Kokubu F. Kuga H. Matsukura S. Hoshino H. Ieki K. Imai T. Adachi M. Huang S.K. J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 2001; 108: 804-809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). It is noted, however, that induction of both IL-6 and IL-8 is not completely inhibited by ERK1/2 kinase inhibitors, PD98059 and U0126, suggesting that additional signaling pathways are involved in these cytokines induced by ML-1 in these cell types. Further work is needed to uncover the signaling pathways of ML-1 and its function in healthy and diseased states.

https://openalex.org/W2116286811,"The native form of the bacterial glutathione transferase B1-1 (EC 2.5.1.18) is characterized by one glutathione (GSH) molecule covalently linked to Cys-10. This peculiar disulfide, only found in the Beta and Omega class glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) but absent in all other GSTs, prompts questions about its role and how GSH can be activated and utilized in the reaction normally performed by GSTs. Stopped-flow and spectroscopic experiments suggest that, in the native enzyme (GSTB1-1ox), a second GSH molecule is present, albeit transiently, in the active site. This second GSH binds to the enzyme through a bimolecular interaction followed by a fast thiol-disulfide exchange with the covalently bound GSH. The apparent p Ka of the non-covalently bound GSH is lowered from 9.0 to 6.4 ± 0.2 in similar fashion to other GSTs. The reduced form of GSTB1-1 (GSTB1-1red) binds GSH 100-fold faster and also induces a more active deprotonation of the substrate with an apparent p Ka of 5.2 ± 0.1. Apparently, the absence of the mixed disulfide does not affect kcat and Km values in the GST conjugation activity, which is rate-limited by the chemical step both in GSTB1-1red and in GSTB1-1ox. However, GSTB1-1ox follows a steady-state random sequential mechanism whereas a rapid-equilibrium random sequential mechanism is adopted by GSTB1-1red. Remarkably, GSTB1-1ox and GSTB1-1red are equally able to catalyze a glutaredoxin-like catalysis using cysteine S-sulfate and hydroxyethyl disulfide as substrates. Cys-10 is an essential residue in this redox activity, and its replacement by alanine abolishes this enzymatic activity completely.

A prominent catalytic activity performed by the eucaryotic GSTs (in particular by the Alpha, Mu, Pi, Theta, and Sigma GSTs) is the conjugation of glutathione (GSH) to a number of toxic electrophilic compounds, thus promoting their excretion (1Jakoby W.B. Habig W.H. Jakoby W.B. Enzymatic Basis of Detoxification. 2. Academic Press, New York1980: 63-94Google Scholar, 2Armstrong R.N. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1997; 10: 2-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (969) Google Scholar). This activity is due to the activation of the sulfhydryl group of GSH, which is stabilized in the reactive thiolate form by a tyrosine residue (Alpha, Pi, Mu, and Sigma classes) or by a serine residue (Delta, Theta, and Zeta classes) in the proximity of the GSH sulfur atom (10Board P.G.

A few selected GSTs are able to catalyze a GSH-dependent reduction of organic hydroperoxides (26Mannervik B. Chem. Scr. 1986; 26: 281-284Google Scholar) and to act as a binding protein of hydrophobic molecules like steroids and heme (27Litwach G. Ketterer B. Arias I.M. Nature. 1971; 234: 466-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). Recent advances revealed that GST Pi is involved in the response of mammalian cells to different forms of stress and in particular to the regulation of Jun kinase protein (28Piredda L.

In addition, Theta and Omega GST classes may play a role in the protection of mammalian cells from apoptosis (30Kampranis S.C. Damianova R. Atallah M. Toby G. Kondi G. Tsichlis P.N. Mahkris A.M. J.

Chem. 2001; 276: 3319-3323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). The recently discovered procaryotic GSTs represent an atypical GST class. A prototype of this class is GSTB1-1 from Proteus mirabilis, which displays poor conjugation activity, lacks substrate specificity (32Perito B. Allocati N. Casalone E. Masulli M. Dragani B. Polsinelli M. Aceto A. Di Ilio C. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 157-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), does not use Tyr or Ser residues in the activation of the substrate (33Casalone E. Allocati N. Ceccarelli I. Masulli M. Rossjohn J. Parker M.W. Di Ilio C. FEBS Lett. 1998; 423: 122-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), and is localized in the periplasmic space (34Allocati N. Cellini L. Aceto A. Iezzi T. Angelucci S. Robuffo I. Di Ilio C. FEBS Lett. 1994; 354: 191-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). A singular feature of this bacterial enzyme is the presence of a mixed disulfide between one GSH molecule and the sulfhydryl group of Cys-10, which resides in the GSH binding site (G-site). The GSH molecule is located in the G-site in a fashion similar to that observed in the active site of all other GSTs where it is anchored to the protein by means of eleven polar interactions and of several hydrophobic links (19Rossjohn J. Polekhina G. Feil S. Allocati N. Masulli M., Di Ilio C. Parker M.W. Structure. 1998; 6: 721-734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The presence of a covalently bound GSH in the G-site is a paradoxical finding in view of the observed conjugation activity of this enzyme. In fact, the sulfur atom of GSH, in this oxidized state, cannot interact with the electrophilic center of the co-substrate, and there was no evidence of a second GSH molecule in the G-site from the crystal structure. In a preceding report (35Caccuri A.M. Antonini G. Allocati N., Di Ilio C. Innocenti F., De Maria F. Parker M.W. Masulli M. Polizio F. Federici G. Ricci G. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 4686-4693Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), we demonstrated that the Cys-10-SG mixed disulfide is characterized by a high reactivity. It exchanges rapidly with external GSH pools in a futile redox cycle, which only replaces the bound GSH with the free GSH so that the enzyme is mainly recovered as an oxidized enzyme. When GSH is removed from the disulfide, Cys-10 displays a relatively high p Ka value of 8.0, and it is rapidly converted into the oxidized form by trace amounts of GSSG even in the presence of an excess of GSH. The redox properties of Cys-10 are reminiscent of the scenario found in the thiol-disulfide oxidoreductase superfamily, from which all GSTs have probably evolved in the past (36Martin J. Structure. 1995; 3: 245-250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar). The βαβαββα motif of the N-terminal domain of thioredoxins and glutaredoxins superimposes well with the N-terminal domain of GSTs, and the active site of the thiol-disulfide oxidoreductase is also characterized by one or two essential cysteine residues that easily form a stable or transient mixed disulfide during catalysis (37Chivers P.T. Raines R.T. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 15810-15816Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 38Srinivasan U. Mieyal P.A. Mieyal J.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 3199-3206Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). In this context, the recently discovered human GST Omega class (11Board P.G. Coggan M. Chelvanayagam G. Easteal S. Jermiin L.S. Schulte G.K. Danley D.E. Hoth L.R. Griffor M.C. Kamath A.V. Rosner M.H. Chrunyk B.A. Perregaux D.E. Gabel C.A. Geoghegan K.F. Pandit J. J. Biol.

Remarkably, this enzyme also displays a peculiar mixed disulfide between Cys-32 and GSH. The present report demonstrates that GSTB1-1 is able to perform both a conjugation activity and redox activity with comparable efficiency, and in the latter activity Cys-10 is shown to be an essential residue. Stopped-flow data and steady-state kinetic experiments, carried out to clarify the mechanisms of the substrate activation and catalysis, reveal unexpected findings that support the suggestion that GSTB1-1 represents a transition enzyme between the thiol-disulfide oxidoreductase superfamily and the GST superfamily. glutathione transferase oxidized bacterial glutathione transferase reduced bacterial glutathione transferase glutathione CDNB, 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene 1-fluoro-2,4-dinitrobenzene 7-chloro-4-nitrobenzo-2-oxa-1,3-diazole 7-fluoro-4-nitrobenzo-2-oxa-1,3-diazole cysteine S-sulfate hydroxyethyl disulfide GSH binding site Cys-10-glutathione mixed disulfide Glutathione (GSH), oxidized glutathione (GSSG), 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (CDNB), 1-fluoro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (FDNB), and cysteine S-sulfate (CysSO3−) were obtained from Sigma Chemical Co.; hydroxyethyl disulfide (HEDS) was obtained from Aldrich; and 7-chloro-4-nitrobenzo-2-oxa-1,3-diazole (NBD-Cl) and 7-fluoro-4-nitrobenzo-2-oxa-1,3-diazole (NBD-F) were obtained from Fluka. The recombinant GSTB1-1 and C10A mutant enzymes were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified as previously described (32Perito B. Allocati N. Casalone E. Masulli M. Dragani B. Polsinelli M. Aceto A. Di Ilio C. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 157-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 33Casalone E. Allocati N. Ceccarelli I. Masulli M. Rossjohn J. Parker M.W. Di Ilio C.

The purified GSTB1-1 is always recovered as a mixed disulfide between the sulfur atom of Cys-10 residue and the GSH thiol (GSTB1-1ox). Reduction of the disulfide was obtained after 30-min incubation with 50 mm dithiothreitol at 37 °C and pH 7.0. GSTB1-1red was separated from the excess of reducing reagents by a Sephadex G-25 column and equilibrated with 0.01 mpotassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0. Protein concentration was calculated from the absorbance at 280 nm assuming an ε1 mg/ml of 1.02. The extinction coefficient was calculated on the basis of the amino acid sequence as reported by Gill et al. (39Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5070) Google Scholar) and confirmed by the bicinchoninic acid method (Pierce). A molecular mass of 22.5 kDa per GST subunit was used in the calculations (4Di Ilio C. Aceto A. Piccolomini R. Allocati N. Faraone A. Cellini L. Ravagnan G. Federici G. Biochem. J. 1988; 255: 971-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Binding of GSH to GSTB1-1ox and GSTB1-1red in 0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, was measured in a single photon counting spectrofluorometer (Fluoromax, S.A. Instrument, Paris, France) with a sample holder set at 25 °C. Excitation was at 295 nm and emission was at 350 nm. In a typical experiment, fluorescence intensity was measured before and after the addition of suitable amounts of GSH (from 0.05 to 3 mm) to 4.4 μm enzyme. Experimental data were corrected both for dilution and for inner filter effects and fitted to Equation 1, FL=Fo+(Fmax−Fo)/(1+([S ]0.5/[S ]nH))Equation 1 where Fo is the protein fluorescence in the absence of GSH, FL is the protein fluorescence in the presence of a given amount of GSH;Fmax is the protein fluorescence at saturating GSH concentrations, and nH is the Hill coefficient. Difference spectra of GSH thiolate bound to GSTB1-1ox, GSTB1-1red, and C10A mutant enzymes were obtained with a Kontron double-beam Uvikon 940 spectrophotometer thermostatted at 25 °C. In a typical experiment 1 mm GSH was added to the enzyme (15 μm) in 0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0. Spectra were corrected for the contribution of free GSH and free enzyme. The amount of thiolate was calculated by assuming an ε240 nm of 5000 m −1cm−1. Experiments at different pH values were carried out using the following buffers (0.1 m): sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.0 and 5.5) and potassium phosphate buffer (between pH 6.0 and 8.0). p Ka values for GSTB1-1ox and GSTB1-1red were calculated by fitting the spectral data to Equation 2, A240 nm=(A240 nmlim×10−pKa+A240 nmmin×10−pH)/(10−pKa+10−pH)Equation 2 where A240 nmlim is the limiting thiolate absorbance at alkaline pH values and A240 nmmin is the residual thiolate absorbance at acidic pH values. Rapid kinetic experiments were performed on an Applied Photophysics Kinetic spectrometer stopped-flow instrument equipped with a thermostatted 1-cm light path observation chamber. Binding of GSH to GSTB1-1ox, GSTB1-1red, and C10A mutant enzymes was studied at 5 °C and 25 °C by rapid mixing of the enzyme (50–100 μm in 0.01m potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0) with the same volume of GSH (from 2 to 20 mm) in (50:50:50 mm) phosphate-acetate-borate buffer, pH 7.0. Binding of GSH was monitored by following the increase of the intrinsic fluorescence of the protein and the increase of the absorbance at 240 nm due to the ionization of the bound GSH. Experimental traces were fitted to a single-exponential equation, and pseudo first-order kinetic constants were calculated at different GSH concentrations. Standard GST activity, with CDNB (1 mm) or NBD-Cl (0.1 mm) as co-substrates, was measured at 25 °C in (50:50:50) mmphosphate-acetate-borate buffer, pH 6.5, containing 5 mmGSH. The activity was assayed spectrophotometrically by following the enzymatic product at 340 nm (ε = 9600m −1 cm−1) for CDNB and at 419 nm (ε = 14,500 m −1 cm−1) for NBD-Cl. Steady-state kinetic experiments with GSTB1-1ox and CDNB as co-substrate, were performed at pH 7.0 and 25 °C by varying CDNB from 0.4 to 2 mm and GSH from 0.1 to 5 mm over a matrix of 50 substrate concentrations. Steady-state kinetic experiments, with GSTB1-1red and CDNB as co-substrate, were performed at pH 7.0 and 25 °C by varying CDNB from 0.1 to 1 mm and GSH from 0.2 to 5 mm over a matrix of 50 substrate concentrations. The pH dependence of kcat with GSTB1-1ox and GSTB1-1red was determined at 25 °C in (50:50:50) mmphosphate-acetate-borate buffers in the pH range 4.5–8.0. With NBD-Cl as co-substrate, GSH and NBD-Cl were kept constant at saturating concentrations (5 and 0.1 mm, respectively). With CDNB as co-substrate, the kcat values were calculated by varying CDNB between 0.1 and 2 mm at fixed and saturating GSH concentrations (5 mm from pH 5.0 to 8.0 and 10 mm at pH 4.5). Data of kcat versus pH were fitted to Equation 3, kcat=(kcatlim×10−pKa+kcatmin×10−pH)/(10−pKa+10−pH)Equation 3 where kcatlim is the limiting value at alkaline pH values and kcatmin is the residual kcat observed at low pH values. Kinetic data were obtained at 25 °C and at fixed NBD-Cl or NBD-F (0.05 mm) and GSH (2 mm) concentrations in 1 ml (final volume) of (50:50:50) phosphate-acetate-borate buffer, pH 5.0, containing suitable amounts of GSTB1-1ox or GSTB1-1red. The spontaneous reactions were evaluated under the same experimental conditions in the absence of the enzyme. Similar experiments were performed at fixed CDNB or FDNB (1 mm) and GSH (1 mm) concentrations in 1 ml (final volume) of (50:50:50) phosphate-acetate-borate buffer, pH 6.5, in the presence of suitable amounts of GSTB1-1red or GSTB1-1ox. The thiol-disulfide oxidoreductase activity was determined spectrophotometrically at 340 nm (30 °C), using the glutathione reductase/NADPH-coupled assay, according to Axelsson et al. (40Axelsson K. Eriksson S. Mannervik B. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 2978-2984Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The assay mixture (1-ml final volume) contained: 0.14 m sodium phosphate, pH 7.6, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm NADPH, 0.5 mm GSH, 2 units of glutathione reductase, 3 mmCysSO3−, and catalytic amounts of GSTB1-1. Thiol-disulfide oxidoreductase activity was also determined at 30 °C by using HEDS as co-substrate. The assay was performed in 1 ml of (50:50:50) mm phosphate-acetate-borate buffer, pH 7.0, containing 1 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm NADPH, 5 mm GSH, 4 units of glutathione reductase, 5 mmHEDS, and catalytic amounts of GSTB1-1. One unit of thiol-disulfide oxidoreductase activity is defined as the amount of enzyme that oxidizes 1 μmol of NADPH per min at 30 °C. The kcat value was calculated at pH 7.0 at saturating GSH and HEDS concentrations. The amount of the glutathione reductase (used as the coupling enzyme) was always enough to avoid underestimation of the thiol-disulfide oxidoreductase reaction. Steady-state kinetic analysis was performed with GSTB1-1ox and GSTB1-1red at pH 7.0 and 30 °C by varying both HEDS and GSH from 0.4 mm to 5 mm over a matrix of 40 substrate concentrations. The dependence of the thiol-disulfide oxidoreductase activity on pH was determined at 30 °C in (50:50:50) mm phosphate-acetate buffers, between pH 4.5 and 7.5, in the conditions described above with both GSH and HEDS kept constant at 5 mm concentration. Experimental data were fitted to Equation 4. ΔA/min=ΔA/minlim/(1+10pKa−pH)Equation 4 Isothermic binding of GSH to GSTB1-1 has been studied at 25 °C and pH 7.0 by using the perturbation of the intrinsic fluorescence of the protein at different GSH concentrations. The fluorescence perturbation observed for GSTB1-1ox after GSH addition is a first indication that the substrate binds to the enzyme even when the mixed disulfide Cys-10-SG is present in the active site. The possibility of a quantitative reduction of this disulfide by GSH in the binding experiments can be ruled out on the basis of preceding studies indicating that more than 90% of GSTB1-1ox is recovered in the presence of 500 mm GSH (35Caccuri A.M. Antonini G. Allocati N., Di Ilio C. Innocenti F., De Maria F. Parker M.W. Masulli M. Polizio F. Federici G. Ricci G. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 4686-4693Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Fluorescence data, fitted to Equation 1, give KD GSH values of 1.3 ± 0.2 mm and 1.0 ± 0.2 mm for GSTB1-1ox and GSTB1-1red, respectively. The Hill coefficients of 1 and 0.9 for the two forms are indicative of a nearly non-cooperative binding mechanism. Fig. 1 shows the pH dependence of the thiolate absorption band at 240 nm obtained by the differential UV spectrum of GSTB1-1ox and GSTB1-1red in the presence of non-saturating GSH (1 mm). Higher GSH concentrations cannot be used because of the large spectral contribution due to the spontaneous ionization of GSH at alkaline pH values. The apparent p Ka value for the bound GSH is 6.4 ± 0.2 for GSTB1-1ox and 5.2 ± 0.1 for GSTB1-1red (Table I), close to the p Ka values found for Alpha, Pi, Mu, and Theta class GSTs (23Caccuri A.M., Lo Bello M.

The occurrence of two different p Ka values is a further indication that a second molecule of GSH binds to the G-site of GSTB1-1ox and that this oxidized enzyme is not reduced by the external GSH.Table IpKa values of sulfhydryl group of GSH bound to GSTB1–1 obtained by differential UV spectroscopy at equilibriumGSTB1–1oxGSTB1–1redC10Ap Ka6.4 ± 0.25.2 ± 0.1≥7.3 Open table in a new tab By assuming an ε240 nm of 5000m −1 cm−1 for the ionized GSH, the limiting value at alkaline pH values and at 1 mm GSH is 0.6 and 0.7 GS− equivalents per active site for GSTB1-1ox and GSTB1-1red, respectively. At saturating GSH concentration and on the basis of the apparent KD values, about one GSH thiolate per subunit can be calculated. A peculiar finding, never observed in other GSTs classes such as Alpha, Pi, Mu, and Theta, is the persistence of a residual amount of ionized GSH even at low pH values (about 0.3 equivalent per active site). In the C10A mutant (Fig. 1), substitution of cysteine with alanine shifts the apparent p Ka of GSH to a value ≥ 7.3 and eliminates the residual GSH ionization at low pH values suggesting a role of the Cys-10 residue in the thiolate stabilization. Rapid kinetic experiments were performed to dissect the binding mechanism of GSH to GSTB1-1ox, GSTB1-1red, and C10A mutant enzymes. The perturbation of the intrinsic fluorescence at 340 nm due to the substrate interaction and the absorbance increase at 240 nm due to the thiolate formation have been utilized in these kinetic experiments. In the case of GSTB1-1red,kobs values, calculated at 5 °C and pH 7.0, follow a linear dependence on GSH concentration up to 5 mm, and the fluorescence perturbation is synchronous with the thiolate formation (Fig. 2). Linear regression analysis gives kon = (192 ± 9) × 103 m −1s−1 and koff = 150 ± 27 s−1. The resulting KD is 0.8 ± 0.2 mm, close to the value found by fluorometric experiments at equilibrium (see Table II). Thus, the binding mechanism can be modeled as a simple bimolecular interaction between the enzyme and GSH to give the final activated complex (Scheme FS1). Rates of GSH binding and release are temperature-dependent, and at 25 °C kobs values are almost triplicated, although the very fast kinetics allowed rough estimate of data.Table IIKinetics of GSH bindingTemperaturekonkoffKDm −1 s−1s−1mmGSTB1–1ox 5 °C(0.53 ± 0.05) × 1030.83 ± 0.331.6 ± 0.4 25 °C(1.22 ± 0.07) × 1032.24 ± 0.401.8 ± 0.5 25 °C1.3 ± 0.22-aData were obtained by fluorescence experiments at equilibrium.GSTB1–1red 5 °C(192 ± 9) × 103150 ± 270.8 ± 0.2 25 °C1.0 ± 0.22-aData were obtained by fluorescence experiments at equilibrium.2-a Data were obtained by fluorescence experiments at equilibrium.

This report therefore implicates SLAP and SLAP-2 as a family of adapter proteins that negatively regulate T cell receptor signaling. One of the main mechanisms of signaling from the plasma membrane to the nucleus is through the alteration of phosphorylation states of target proteins. Binding of ligands to cellular receptors leads to the activation of the intrinsic or associated kinase activity of receptors in most cases. Phosphorylation of the receptor itself or of its substrates creates docking sites for other proteins within the cells. Such proteins may possess an enzymatic activity such as protein kinases and phosphatases or function as adapter or docking proteins that recruit signaling molecules either by forming signaling complexes or by changing their subcellular localization (1Pawson T. Scott J.D. Science. 1997; 278: 2075-2080Crossref PubMed Scopus (1883) Google Scholar). Adapter proteins contain a variety of modular domains that mediate protein-protein interactions. Some of the best characterized domains involved in protein-protein interactions are Src homology domain 2 (SH2) 1The abbreviations used are: SH2Src homology 2ESTexpressed sequence tagILinterleukinNF-ATnuclear factors of activated T cellsPMAphorbol 12-myristate 13-acetateSLAPSrc-like adapter proteinSH3Src homology 3TCRT cell receptorRTreverse transcriptaseGSTglutathione S-transferase 1The abbreviations used are: SH2Src homology 2ESTexpressed sequence tagILinterleukinNF-ATnuclear factors of activated T cellsPMAphorbol 12-myristate 13-acetateSLAPSrc-like adapter proteinSH3Src homology 3TCRT cell receptorRTreverse transcriptaseGSTglutathione S-transferase and Src homology 3 (SH3) domains (2Pawson T.

The SH2 domain interacts with phosphotyrosine residues within the context of three to five additional COOH-terminal residues (6Songyang Z. Shoelson S.E. Chaudhuri M. Gish G. Pawson T. Haser W.G.

SH3 domains bind to peptides with a left-handed polyproline type II helix containing a minimal consensus sequence Pro-X-X-Pro (for review, see Ref. 7Mayer B.J. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 1253-1263Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Several adapter proteins contain both SH2 and SH3 domains that permit association with multiple binding partners.

Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2001; 13: 225-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The T cell receptor (TCR) is a multimeric protein complex formed by the assembly of α and β (or γ and δ) and δ, γ, ε, and ζ CD3 subunits that signals through associated cytoplasmic protein-tyrosine kinases (9Padlan E.A. Marguilies D.H. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: R17-R20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10DeFranco A.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 163-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 11Wilson I.A. Garcia K.C. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1997; 7: 839-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Four classes of non-receptor protein-tyrosine kinases, Src, Zap-70/Syk, Tec, and Csk, have been shown to be activated upon immunoreceptor stimulation (12Latour S. Veillette A. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2001; 13: 299-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 13Kane L.P. Lin J. Weiss A. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2000; 12: 242-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). Activation of these kinases leads to a dramatic increase in phosphotyrosine content of activated cells. Another consequence of T cell activation is the production of IL-2 and other cytokines. The activity of IL-2 promoter is increased by association to specific sites of nuclear factors of activated T cells (NF-AT), AP-1, and members of the NF-κB family by transcriptional up-regulation and stabilization of the mRNA (for review, see Ref.14Jain J. Loh C. Rao A. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1995; 7: 333-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). A number of adapter proteins have been isolated that are involved in TCR signaling; some of them have positive regulatory functions such as LAT, SLP-76, SLAP65, and Gads, while others negatively regulate these signals e.g. SLAP, Dok, and Cbl (15Leo A. Schraven B. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2001; 13: 307-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). We have cloned a novel adapter molecule containing SH2 and SH3 domains designated Src-like adapter protein 2 (SLAP-2), whose SH2 and SH3 domains are homologous to the Src family of kinases. SLAP-2 transcript is expressed predominantly in the immune system. In this report, we have explored the function of SLAP-2 and show that it negatively regulates TCR signaling in Jurkat T cells. The SH2 domain of SLAP-2 was critical for this inhibition as evidenced by mutagenesis experiments. Our studies implicate SLAP and SLAP-2 as a family of adapter proteins that negatively regulate signal transduction pathways. A mouse EST clone (IMAGE accession number 478854) was obtained from Incyte Genomics (Palo Alto, CA) and sequenced on both strands using ABI PRISM 310 Genetic Analyzer (PE Applied Biosystems, CA). A human clone (GenBankTM accession number AK025645) was obtained from Dr. Sumio Sugano (NEDO human cDNA sequencing project). To generate a wild type SLAP-2 expression vector with a carboxyl-terminal V5 epitope tag, the open reading frame of mouse SLAP-2 was first subcloned into NcoI and XhoI sites of pENTR4 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) by standard PCR procedures using the primers: aaaccatgggaagtttgtccagcagaggg (5′ primer) and aaactcgaggaagcatccaaggggtcctcagc (3′ primer). Subsequently, it was transferred into the expression vector pEF/V5-His (Invitrogen) which was modified to be compatible to the GatewayTM system (Invitrogen, Gaithersburg, MD) according to the manufacturer's instructions. We used SLAP-2 in pENTR4 as template to obtain point mutations in the SH3 or SH2 domains of SLAP-2 and to mutate the glycine in the position 2 to alanine, using a single primer method (16Makarova O. Kamberov E. Margolis B. BioTechniques. 2000; 29: 970-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). The primers containing the mutations used in this procedure were: tcaggcagagagtaccacatgctcagtgtgtatgtggctaaagtc, cccggaggggccttcctcatcgaggagagccagaccaggagaggctgc, and aagcaggctccaccatggcaagtttgtccagcagaggg, respectively. The cDNAs containing the mutations were confirmed by sequencing and were subsequently transferred into GatewayTM compatible pEF/V5-His to create V5-tagged mutant expression vectors. IL-2 luciferase and NF-AT luciferase reporter constructs were a kind gift from Tomasz Sosinowski and Arthur Weiss. pGEX 4T3 Cbl-N vector has been previously described (17Tang J. Sawasdikosol S. Chang J.H. Burakoff S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9775-9780Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The human and mouse SLAP-2 cDNAs were used to search the publicly available human genomic data base and Celera's proprietary mouse genomic data base (www.celera.com), respectively. The genomic regions were then aligned to the cDNA sequences to determine intron-exon boundaries. Human multiple tissue and immune system Northern blots containing immobilized poly(A)+mRNA were obtained from CLONTECH (Palo Alto, CA). We used a 740-bp SLAP-2 fragment obtained by AvrII/Hin dIII digestion of the cDNA as a probe. The probe was labeled with 32P-labeled dCTP and hybridized according to the manufacturer's instructions. After autoradiography, the nitrocellulose blot was stripped and reprobed with a β-actin probe to check for equal loading. RT-PCR analysis was performed using cDNA templates from resting and activated CD4+ T cells, CD19+ B cells, CD8+ T cells, and resting CD14+ monocytes (CLONTECH Laboratories). The PCR reaction was performed in a 50-μl volume containing 5 μl of cDNA, 50 mm KCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.0, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.2 mm dNTP, 5 pmol of each primer, and 1.25 units of Taq polymerase. The reaction mixture was denatured by heating at 94 °C for 30 s. Denaturation was followed by 30 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 1 min, 72 °C for 1 min, and final extension at 72 °C for 5 min. The PCR products were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis. Primers used for the RT-PCR were as follows: SLAP-2, gtttccagtaccatctggatgccc and ctgatcccttagcggatccagcag; G3PDH, tgaaggtcggagtcaacggatttggt and catgtgggccatgaggtccaccac. Jurkat T cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and penicillin/streptomycin. 293T cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm l-glutamine and penicillin/streptomycin. The peptide corresponding to the COOH-terminal human SLAP-2 was synthesized by Boston Biomolecules (Woburn, MA). The specific SLAP-2 rabbit polyclonal antibody (anti-SLAP-2) was raised at Covance Research Products Inc. (Denver, PA). Anti-Shc, anti-SHP-2, and anti-Cbl antibodies were purchased from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY), anti-V5 from Invitrogen, anti-phosphotyrosine (4G10) and anti-ZAP-70 from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY), and anti-CD3 ζ from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). For experiments in which IL-2 luciferase reporter was used, 2 × 107 Jurkat T cells were electroporated with 20 μg of reporter, 20 μg of the different plasmid constructs, in Bio-Rad 0.4-cm gap cuvettes at 250 V and 975 μF using a Invitrogen electroporator (Bio-Rad). For experiments involving NF-AT luciferase reporter, 2 × 106 Jurkat T cells were transfected with 0.2 μg of reporter and 1.8 μg of different plasmid constructs using LipofectAMINE Plus (Invitrogen, Gaithersburg, MD). Cells were subsequently grown for an additional 16–18 h. The cells were then treated with 1 μg/ml purified anti-human CD3, clone UCHT1 (PharMingen Int., San Diego, CA) plus 5 μg/ml rabbit anti-mouse antibody (Dako, Denmark) or 50 ng/ml phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) plus 1 μm ionomycin (Sigma) for 8 h. After treatment, cells were harvested and luciferase and β-galactosidase activities measured according to the manufacturer's instructions (Tropix, Bedford, MA). For testing expression of endogenous SLAP-2, 7 × 107 Jurkat T cells were lysed in RIPA buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 1% SDS) with 1 mm sodium orthovanadate and protease inhibitors. Samples were incubated either with preimmune serum or SLAP-2 antiserum. Immunoprecipitated proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE. Membranes were incubated with SLAP-2 antiserum followed by goat anti-rabbit IgG (Fc-specific) horseradish peroxidase antibody for detection. In the phosphorylation assay, 3.5 × 106 Jurkat T cells were used per treatment. After stimulation for 5 min with anti-CD3 antibody (C305), cells were lysed in RIPA buffer and immunoprecipitated with anti-SLAP-2, anti-Shc, or anti-SHP-2 antibodies. Western blotting was performed with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. Subsequently, the membranes were stripped by incubating the blot in stripping buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.7, 2% SDS, 100 mmβ-mercaptoethanol) and reprobed with the respective primary antibodies. 293T cells were transfected using the calcium phosphate method with 15 μg of pEF/V5-His (GatewayTM modified) or vectors expressing various SLAP-2 V5-tagged constructs. Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were lysed in “modified RIPA” (RIPA without SDS) with 1 mm sodium orthovanadate and protease inhibitors and subjected to immunoprecipitation and Western blotting as described above. 293T cells were co-transfected as previously described with 7.5 μg of pEF/V5-His (GatewayTM modified) or SLAP-2 V5 and 7.5 μg of HA-Cbl constructs. Cells were lysed in lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mmEDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40) with 1 mm sodium orthovanadate and protease inhibitors. For immunoprecipitation of phosphorylated proteins 5 × 107 Jurkat cells were starved for 2 h in serum-free medium. Activation of the TCR was performed by incubation of the cells on ice 15 min with 4 μg/ml purified anti-human CD3 followed by 15 min with 20 μg/ml rabbit anti-mouse immunoglobulins and 5 min at 37 °C. Cells were lysed in Nonidet P-40 buffer. Cells were lysed in lysis buffer and immunoprecipitated with anti-SLAP-2 antiserum. Western blot was done with anti-phosphotyrosine, anti-ZAP-70, anti-CD3 ζ, anti-Cbl, or anti-SLAP-2 antibodies. In GST pulldown experiments, 2.5 × 107 Jurkat T cells were lysed in lysis buffer and incubated for 4 h at room temperature with GST alone or GST-Cbl N. The Western blot was subsequently probed with anti-SLAP-2 antiserum. To identify novel signaling molecules, we screened EST data bases (dbEST) for sequences containing SH2 or SH3 domains. One of the mouse ESTs derived from a mouse embryo cDNA library identified in this search (IMAGE accession number 478854) contained an SH3 domain that was homologous to the Src family of tyrosine kinases. This clone was sequenced completely and the open reading frame was found to encode a protein of 259 amino acids. In addition to an SH3 domain, this cDNA also encoded an SH2 domain and was notable for the absence of any kinase domain. It was 43% identical to a previously identified molecule called Src-like adapter protein (18Pandey A. Duan H. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19201-19204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) and therefore designated as SLAP-2. SLAP-2 contains unique NH2-terminal and COOH-terminal regions that are not homologous to any other protein in databases. Using BLAST search, we identified a human cDNA clone (GenBankTM accession number AK025645) isolated from a HepG2 hepatoma cell line that was labeled as encoding an unnamed protein product. Analysis of the protein encoded by the open reading frame contained in this clone revealed it to be the human ortholog of murine SLAP-2. Fig. 1 A shows an alignment of murine and human SLAP-2 proteins that are 79% identical to each other. Both of them contain the sequence, FLIRES, which corresponds to a conserved motif located in the phosphotyrosine binding pocket of all SH2 domains (19Waksman G. Kominos D. Robertson S.C. Pant N. Baltimore D. Birge R.B. Cowburn D. Hanafusa H. Mayer B.J. Overduin M. Resh M.D. Rios C.B. Silvermand L. Kuriyan J. Nature. 1992; 358: 646-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar). The strong conservation between human and murine SLAP-2 is also reflected in the genomic structure of the murine and human SLAP-2 coding regions obtained by comparison of the respective cDNAs to mouse and human genomic sequences. The coding sequence of murine and human SLAP-2 is distributed over 7 exons with a complete conservation of the length of the coding regions except for one extra amino acid in the first exon and 3 additional amino acids in the last coding exon of human SLAP-2 (Fig. 1 B). The intron-exon boundaries are completely conserved and follow the GT/AG rule (20Padgett R.A. Grabowski P.J. Konarska M.M. Seiler S. Sharp P.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1986; 55: 1119-1150Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Tables I andII).Table IIntron-exon boundaries of the murine SLAP-2 geneThe coding exon numbers are shown in the left column.

To determine the tissue distribution of SLAP-2 mRNA, we probed two Northern blots containing poly(A)+ mRNA from different human tissues with a specific cDNA fragment from human SLAP-2. SLAP-2 expression was indicated by the presence of one major mRNA species of ∼2.4 kb only in the tissues from the immune system with highest levels seen in peripheral blood leukocytes (Fig. 2 A). We also took advantage of the presence of expressed sequence tags (ESTs) corresponding to SLAP-2 as an indicator of expression in various tissues, a so-called “electronic Northern” (21Pandey A. Lewitter F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 276-280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), by performing a BLAST search against the EST data base. We found EST entries corresponding to SLAP-2 from cDNA libraries generated from spleen, thymus, and lymph nodes but also from placenta, prostate, skin, retina, and colon indicating that SLAP-2 may also be expressed at low levels in other tissues. In addition, an EST that was derived from Jurkat T cell line was found in this search. To further characterize which cell populations of the immune system express SLAP-2 mRNA, we performed RT-PCR in resting and activated CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, in resting and activated CD19+ B cells and resting CD14+ monocytes (Fig. 2 B). We were able to detect SLAP-2 transcript in all the samples analyzed; however, the levels in resting and activated CD19+ B cells were very low compared with that observed in the rest of the samples analyzed. Therefore, although SLAP-2 is expressed in T and B cells as well as monocytes, its expression is low in B cells. Since SLAP-2 mRNA was expressed in T cells, it is possible that it plays a role in T cell signaling. To check expression of SLAP-2 protein, we generated a polyclonal antibody directed against a peptide derived from the COOH terminus of SLAP-2. Immunoprecipitation and Western blotting of Jurkat T cell lysates with anti-SLAP-2 antiserum revealed the presence of two bands with molecular weights of ∼27,000 and 25,000. These bands were specific since they were not immunoprecipitated by the preimmune serum. The size of the upper band is close to the predicted molecular weight of ∼28,000 deduced from the open reading frame of SLAP-2 (Fig. 3 A). The origin of the lower band is not clear although it may represent a processed form of SLAP-2, a degradation product or may arise from an internal translation initiation site in its mRNA. Cross-linking of TCR leads to activation of several tyrosine kinases that in turn phosphorylate other proteins thereby initiating a signaling cascade. Several of these downstream proteins such as LAT, Cbl, SHP-2, and Shc undergo tyrosine phosphorylation in response to TCR activation (22Zhang W. Sloan-Lancaster J. Kitchen J. Trible R.P. Samelson L.E. Cell. 1998; 92: 83-92Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1051) Google Scholar, 23Donovan J.A. Wange R.L. Langdon W.Y. Samelson L.E. J. Biol.

Science. 1993; 262: 902-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). To test if SLAP-2 is similarly phosphorylated on tyrosine residues upon TCR activation, Jurkat T cells were stimulated with an anti-CD3 antibody. Unstimulated and stimulated lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-SLAP-2 antiserum followed by Western blotting with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. In parallel, as controls for TCR activation, the samples were immunoprecipitated with antibodies specific for Shc, an adapter protein, and SHP-2, a cytoplasmic phosphatase. Although we could easily detect an increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc and SHP-2, there was no detectable phosphorylation of SLAP-2 (Fig. 3 B). Reprobing of the membranes with the corresponding specific antibodies showed that equal amounts of SLAP-2, Shc, and SHP-2 proteins were loaded. These findings suggest that tyrosine phosphorylation may not be required for the function of SLAP-2. To study the function of SLAP-2, we cloned the open reading frame of SLAP-2 into a mammalian expression vector which provides a V5 epitope tag at the COOH terminus. Expression of epitope-tagged SLAP-2 was confirmed by transfection of the plasmid construct in 293T cells followed by immunoprecipitation and Western blotting with anti-V5 antibody (Fig. 3 C). Activation of T cells ultimately leads to increased transcription of a number of genes especially cytokines. IL-2 promoter luciferase and NF-AT luciferase which contains three tandem copies of the NF-AT-binding site of the IL-2 promoter fused to the IL-2 minimal promoter are strongly up-regulated upon TCR activation (26Northrop J.P. Ullman K.S. Crabtree G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2917-2923Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and have been extensively used to study T cell signaling events in Jurkat T cell line. To examine the possible role of SLAP-2 in T cell activation, we co-transfected Jurkat T cells with SLAP-2 and NF-AT luciferase reporter constructs. After activation of TCR with anti-CD3 antibody, cells transfected with SLAP-2 protein showed a reduction of the luciferase activity to approximately half of the levels shown by stimulated cells transfected with the vector control (Fig. 4 A). A similar inhibition of the luciferase activity was also observed when we used the luciferase gene controlled by the native IL-2 promoter as a reporter (Fig. 4 A). Therefore, overexpression of SLAP-2 has an inhibitory effect on T cell receptor signaling pathway as has been shown earlier for SLAP (27Sosinowski T. Pandey A. Dixit V.M. Weiss A. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 191: 463-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The production of IL-2 upon activation of TCR by anti-CD3 can be mimicked by a simultaneous increase of calcium levels and the activation of protein kinase C by using a combination of PMA and ionomycin (28Weiss A. Imboden J. Shoback D. Stobo J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 4169-4173Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar, 29Truneh A. Albert F. Golstein P. Schmitt-Verhulst A.M. Nature. 1985; 313: 318-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar). To further study the effects of SLAP-2, we examined the activity of NF-AT luciferase and IL-2 luciferase after treating cells with PMA and ionomycin. It was found that the overexpression of SLAP-2 had no inhibitory effect on the luciferase activity of IL-2 or NF-AT constructs (Fig. 4 B). This observation indicates that the negative regulation of SLAP-2 is upstream of an increase in calcium and Ras activation. To delineate the region of SLAP-2 that is responsible for the negative regulation of TCR signaling, we generated point mutants that inactivated the SH3 or the SH2 domain of SLAP-2. To disrupt the tyrosine binding capability of its SH2 domain, we mutated the arginine residue within the FLIR sequence within the phosphotyrosine binding pocket to glutamic acid (5Schlessinger J. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1994; 4: 25-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar, 30Yarden Y. Ullrich A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 443-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (1380) Google Scholar, 31Songyang Z. Shoelson S.E. McGlade J. Olivier P. Pawson T. Bustelo X.R. Barbacid M. Sabe H. Hanafusa H. Yi T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2777-2785Crossref PubMed Scopus (829) Google Scholar). SH3 domains contain a conserved proline residue that is critical for peptide binding (32Clark S.G. Stern M.J. Horvitz H.R. Nature. 1992; 356: 340-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar, 33Eck M.J. Atwell S.K. Shoelson S.E. Harrison S.C. Nature. 1994; 368: 764-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 34Larson S.M. Davidson A.R. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 2170-2180Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) and, therefore, we mutated the equivalent proline at position 82 in SLAP-2 to a leucine residue. The expression of both of these mutants was found to be similar to that of wild type SLAP-2 (Fig. 3 C). When Jurkat T cells were co-transfected with the SH2 mutant of SLAP-2, no inhibition of NF-AT luciferase activity was observed upon cross-linking the TCR. In contrast, when cells were co-transfected with the SH3 mutant of SLAP-2, a reduction of luciferase activity in stimulated cells was similar to that seen with transfected wild type SLAP-2 was observed (Fig. 5 A). Therefore, the SH2, but not the SH3 domain, is necessary for the attenuation of TCR signaling by SLAP-2. These observations suggest that the binding of SH2 domain of SLAP-2 to tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins in the TCR signaling pathway may be essential for its inhibitory function. Since the SH2 domain of SLAP-2 is homologous to the Src family of kinases, one of the mechanisms of inhibition may be that it competes with Lck to inhibit TCR signaling. Indeed, SLAP has been previously shown to inhibit platelet-derived growth factor-induced mitogenesis in NIH 3T3 fibroblasts and to compete with c-Src for binding to the same sites on the platelet-derived growth factor receptor (35Roche S. Alonso G. Kazlauskas A. Dixit V.M. Courtneidge S.A. Pandey A. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 975-978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Targeting of proteins into specialized membrane subdomains is a potential mechanism to organize and facilitate the assembly of the signaling cascade by bringing protein effectors in proximity to their substrates. For instance, exclusion of the adapter LAT from specialized membrane subdomains leads to impaired TCR signaling (36Lin J. Weiss A. Finco T.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28861-28864Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Several members of the Src family are known to be associated with the plasma membrane by means of two fatty acyl chains: myristic acid attached to a glycine residue and palmitic acid attached to a cysteine, both located within the NH2-terminal region (37Milligan G. Parenti M. Magee A.I. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 181-187Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar, 38Resh M.D. Cell. 1994; 76: 411-413Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar). The NH2 terminus of SLAP has also been reported to be myristoylated at a glycine located at position 2 and to co-localize with Src in vivo (39Manes G. Bello P. Roche S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3396-3406Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Mutation of this glycine residue to alanine is expected to prevent lipid attachment leading to changes in the localization of SLAP (39Manes G. Bello P. Roche S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3396-3406Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Both murine and human SLAP-2 sequences shown conservation of a consensus motif, MG XXXS (40Johnson D.R. Bhatnagar R.S. Knoll L.J. Gordon J.I. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 869-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar), for myristoylation at their NH2 termini. We therefore decided to test if the conserved glycine residue was necessary for the observed SLAP-2 inhibitory effect by mutating the glycine at the position 2 into alanine. Expression of SLAP-2 G2A mutant was first confirmed by Western blotting with anti-V5 antibody (Fig. 3 C). When Jurkat T cells were transfected with this mutant together with NF-AT luciferase, we did not observe any inhibition of the stimulation upon anti-CD3 cross-linking (Fig. 5 B). This is analogous to the decrease in activation of Lck that is observed when the corresponding glycine residue in Lck is mutated to an alanine (41Abraham N. Veillette A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 5197-5206Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). These results suggest localization of SLAP-2 near the plasma membrane may indeed be required for its inhibitory role in TCR signaling. Since the SH2 domain of SLAP-2 is critical for the inhibition of TCR signaling we sought to identify tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins that interact with SLAP-2. For this purpose, lysates from untreated and stimulated Jurkat T cells were immunoprecipitated with SLAP-2 antiserum followed by Western blot with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (Fig. 6 A). Major phosphorylated protein bands were observed in anti-SLAP-2 immunoprecipitates in anti-CD3-treated cells. In a parallel experiment, anti-SLAP-2 immunoprecipitates were probed with antibodies specific for proteins involved in TCR signaling. We found that SLAP-2 interacted with phosphorylated ZAP-70 and CD3 ζ chain (Fig. 6 B). These proteins have also been previously shown to interact in a GST pulldown with the prototypical member of this family, SLAP (17Tang J. Sawasdikosol S. Chang J.H. Burakoff S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9775-9780Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 27Sosinowski T. Pandey A. Dixit V.M. Weiss A. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 191: 463-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Cbl has been shown to be a negative regulator of TCR signaling. It has also been speculated that the negative regulation of TCR signaling by SLAP could involve its binding to Cbl. To determine if SLAP-2 interacts with Cbl, we performed a co-transfection experiment in 293T cells. As shown in Fig. 7 A, SLAP-2 interacted with Cbl protein. To test whether the binding was mediated through the NH2-terminal region of Cbl that mediates binding to SLAP, we performed a GST pulldown experiment using the NH2-terminal region of Cbl as a GST fusion. Fig. 7 B shows that SLAP-2 efficiently bound GST-Cbl N but not GST alone. Finally, to test if SLAP-2 and Cbl associate in vivo and if the interaction depends on TCR activation, lysates from untreated and TCR-stimulated Jurkat T cells were incubated with SLAP-2 antiserum and probed with anti-Cbl antibody. We found that SLAP-2 associated with Cbl both in the absence and presence of TCR stimulation suggesting that it is a phosphotyrosine independent interaction. It has been shown that ZAP-70 and CD3 ζ chain form a multiprotein complex with Cbl (42Wang H.Y. Altman Y. Fang D. Elly C. Dai Y. Shao Y. Liu Y.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26004-26011Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). We have now shown that SLAP-2 also interacts in vivo with ZAP-70, CD3 ζ, and Cbl making it is likely that the inhibitory effect of SLAP-2 involves its participation in this multiprotein complex. Our results indicate that SLAP-2 can negatively regulate TCR signaling. SLAP-2 is proximal to the activation of TCR as its inhibitory effect cannot be observed after a simultaneous increase of calcium levels and Ras activation by addition of PMA plus ionomycin. The inhibition of TCR signaling pathway requires an intact SH2 domain whereas the SH3 domain is not critical for this effect. The NH2 terminus of SLAP-2 is most likely myristoylated and the integrity of the predicted myristoylation site is essential for the observed down-regulation of TCR signaling. Since both SLAP and SLAP-2 are coexpressed in thymus, spleen, and lymph node, it is possible that they have at least partially redundant roles in T cell signaling. This notion is supported by the fact that they share common binding partners such as ZAP-70, CD3 ζ, and Cbl. The negative regulation by SLAP was confirmed by an enhanced positive selection of thymocytes that was observed in SLAP knockout mice that were transgenic for a class II MHC-restricted TCR (43Sosinowski T. Killeen N. Weiss A. Immunity. 2001; 15: 457-466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). In addition, absence of SLAP was able to partially rescue T cell development in mice that were deficient in ZAP-70 (43Sosinowski T. Killeen N. Weiss A. Immunity. 2001; 15: 457-466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar)."

The HNK-1 glycan synthesis is initiated by the addition of β1,3-linked GlcA to N-acetyllactosamine followed by sulfation of the C-3 position of GlcA. The cDNAs encoding β1,3-glucuronyltransferase (GlcAT-P) and HNK-1 sulfotransferase (HNK-1ST) have been recently cloned. Among various adhesion molecules, the neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) was shown to contain HNK-1 glycan on N-glycans. In the present study, we first demonstrated that NCAM also bears HNK-1 glycan attached to O-glycans when NCAM contains the O-glycan attachment scaffold, muscle-specific domain, and is synthesized in the presence of core 2 β1,6-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase, GlcAT-P, and HNK-1ST. Structural analysis of the HNK-1 glycan revealed that the HNK-1 glycan is attached on core 2 branched O-glycans, sulfo→3GlcAβ1→3Galβ1→4GlcNAcβ1→6(Galβ1→3)GalNAc. Using synthetic oligosaccharides as acceptors, we found that GlcAT-P and HNK-1ST almost equally act on oligosaccharides, mimicking N- and O-glycans. By contrast, HNK-1 glycan was much more efficiently added to N-glycans than O-glycans when NCAM was used as an acceptor. These results are consistent with our results showing that HNK-1 glycan is minimally attached to O-glycans of NCAM in fetal brain, heart, and the myoblast cell line, C2C12. These results combined together indicate that HNK-1 glycan can be synthesized on core 2 branched O-glycans but that the HNK-1 glycan is preferentially added on N-glycans over O-glycans of NCAM, probably because N-glycans are extended further than O-glycans attached to NCAM containing the muscle-specific domain.

Neural cell adhesion molecules undergo critical post-translational modifications that modulate their affinity and in some cases alter their specificity for their cognate ligands (1Edelman G.M.

In particular, many neural cell adhesion molecules are heavily glycosylated, and the extent and composition of attached carbohydrates modify their adhesive properties. Among those, polysialic acid and HNK-1 are particularly notable.

In the adult brain, polysialylated NCAM is restricted to certain tissues, such as the hippocampus and olfactory bulb, where neuronal regeneration persists. Polysialic acid is a linear homopolymer of α-2,8-linked sialic acid residues formed on α-2,3- or α-2,6-linked sialic acid in N-acetyllactosamine of N-glycans (3Finne J. J. Biol.

This glycan can be attached to dystroglycan, and its defect may cause muscular dystrophy (23Yoshida A. Kobayashi K. Manya H. Taniguchi K. Kano H. Mizuno M. Inazu T. Mitsuhashi H. Takahashi S.

NCAM has numerous isoforms due to alternative splicing of precursor mRNAs. Among them, NCAM(MSD) contains an additional domain, the so-called muscle-specific domain (MSD), consisting of 37 amino acids between two fibronectin type III-like domains (24Dickson G. Gower H.J. Barton C.H. Prentice H.M. Elsom V.L. Moore S.E. Cox R.D. Quinn C. Putt W. Walsh F.S. Cell. 1987; 50: 1119-1130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). This NCAM(MSD) is mostly present in skeletal myotubes and often anchored to the plasma membrane through glycophosphatidylinositol (24Dickson G. Gower H.J. Barton C.H. Prentice H.M. Elsom V.L. Moore S.E. Cox R.D. Quinn C. Putt W. Walsh F.S. Cell. 1987; 50: 1119-1130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). The MSD is highly enriched with serine, threonine and proline and O-linked oligosaccharides were shown to attach to this domain (25Walsh F.S. Parekh R.B. Moore S.E. Dickson G. Barton C.H. Gower H.J. Dwek R.A. Rademacher T.W. Development. 1989; 105: 803-811PubMed Google Scholar). It has been shown that NCAM(MSD) from C2C12 myoblast cell line contains mucin-type O-linked oligosaccharides ±NeuNAcα2→3Galβ1→3(±NeuNAcα2→6)GalNAcα→Thr/Ser (25Walsh F.S. Parekh R.B. Moore S.E. Dickson G. Barton C.H. Gower H.J. Dwek R.A. Rademacher T.W. Development. 1989; 105: 803-811PubMed Google Scholar). However, no studies have addressed whether O-glycans in NCAM contain an HNK-1-capping structure. The HNK-1 glycan is synthesized in a stepwise manner by the addition of a β1,3-linked glucuronic acid to precursor N- acetyllactosamine by β1,3-glucosaminyltransferase (GlcAT-P) followed by the addition of a sulfate group by HNK-1 sulfotransferase (HNK-1ST) to GlcAβ1→3Galβ1→4GlcNAc→R, forming sulfo→3GlcAβ1→3Galβ1→4GlcNAc→R (26Chou D.K.H. Jungalwala F.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 330-336Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, the cDNAs encoding GlcAT-P and HNK-1ST have been cloned (27Terayama K. Oka S. Seiki T.

In mucin-type O-glycans, N-acetyllactosamine can be formed when core 2 branch, GlcNAcβ1→6(Galβ1→3) GalNAcα1→R, is synthesized by core 2 β1,6-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (Core2GlcNAcT, Fig. 1, Ref. 30Bierhuizen M.F.A. Fukuda M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9326-9330Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). These results prompted us to examine how the HNK-1 glycan is synthesized in mucin-type O-linked oligosaccharides attached to NCAM. In this report, we first present evidence that HNK-1 glycan can be formed in O-glycans attached to the MSD in NCAM. We found that HNK-1 glycan is attached to core 2 branched O-glycans but not to core 1 O-glycans present in NCAM. We determined the HNK-1 glycan structure in mucin-type O-linked oligosaccharides as sulfo→3GlcAβ1→3Galβ1→4GlcNAcβ1→6(Galβ1→3)GalNAc. Finally, we found that HNK-1 glycans can be formed on N-glycans more efficiently than O-glycans on NCAM, although GlcAT-P and HNK-1ST utilize O-glycan and N-glycan oligosaccharides almost equally as an acceptor. pIG-NCAM·IgG and pIG-NCAM(MSD)·IgG encoding NCAM·IgG and NCAM(MSD)·IgG chimeric proteins, respectively, were constructed from pIG-NCAM(VASE, MSD)·IgG, originally provided by Dr. David Simmons at Oxford University (31Simmons D.L.

Glycobiology. 2001; 11: 231-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). All products derived from these different vectors were found to react with anti-NCAM antibody (Eric-1) by Western blotting, confirming the sequences and sizes of the products (32Franceschini I.

The cDNA encoding a catalytic domain of GlcAT-P was obtained by PCR using pcDNA3(neo)-GlcAT-P as a template. 5′- and 3′-primers for the PCR are 5′-CGGATCCCAGCCTCGCACCTCTGCTTGCT-3′ (the BamHI site is underlined, and the rest is nucleotides 120–141 of GlcAT-P) and 5′-ACTCGAGTCAGATCTCCACCGAGGGGTC-3′ (the XhoI site is underlined, and the rest of the sequence is nucleotides 1044–1024 of GlcAT-P). After BamHI and XhoI digestion, the cDNA fragment was ligated into the same sites of pcDNAI-A, which harbors a signal peptide and IgG-binding domain of protein A, resulting in pcDNAI-A·GlcAT-P. The cDNA encoding a human sulfotransferase that transfers a sulfate group from PAPS to glucuronylated N-acetyllactosamine precursors was cloned into pcDNA3 as described previously, resulting in pcDNA3-HNK-1ST (29Ong E.

Similarly, pcDNAI-A·HNK-1ST was prepared as described before (33Ong E. Yeh J-C. Ding Y. Hindsgaul O. Pedersen L.C. Negishi M. Fukuda M. J. Biol.

A. 1991; 88: 234-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) was a kind gift of Dr. Pamela Stanley. To avoid the formation of HNK-1 in N-glycans, the majority of the experiments were carried out using a mutant Chinese hamster ovary cell line, Lec1. Since Lec1 cells are deficient in GnT-I, all of the N-glycans synthesized in this cell line remain as high mannose oligosaccharides (36Stanley P. Narashimhan S. Siminovitch L. Schachter H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 3323Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Lec1 cells were found to lack core 2 β1,6-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase as in other Chinese hamster ovary cells (30Bierhuizen M.F.A. Fukuda M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9326-9330Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Lec1 cells were stably transfected with pcDNA3.1(Zeo)-Core2GlcNAcT-I as described before (29Ong E. Yeh J.C. Ding Y. Hindsgaul O. Fukuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5190-5195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Lec1-core 2 cells were first selected in the presence of zeocin (Invitrogen) and then by immunofluorescent staining using tomato lectin, which reacts with N-acetyllactosamine and poly-N-acetyllactosamines (37Merkle R.K. Cummings R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 8179-8189Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As shown previously, the formation of core 2 branches results in the formation of small amounts of poly-N-acetyllactosamine (38Bierhuizen M.F. Maemura K. Fukuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4473-4479Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To confirm the integration of human Core2GlcNAcT-I cDNA into Lec1 cell chromosome, reverse transcription-PCR was carried out on poly(A)+ RNA derived from Lec1-core 2 cells. The primers for this reverse transcription-PCR were designed in exon 1 and exon 2, avoiding the amplification of hamster genomic DNA harboring Core2GlcNAcT. Lec1-core 2 cells were transfected with pcDNA3(neo)-GlcAT-P and selected in the presence of G418 and zeocin, and Lec1-core2·GlcA were chosen after immunostaining using M6749 antibody (39Obata K. Tanaka H. Neurosci. Res. 1988; 6: 131-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), which reacts with both nonsulfated and sulfated forms of HNK-1 carbohydrates (27Terayama K. Oka S. Seiki T.

Those cells were further transfected with pcDNA3.1(hyg)-HNK-1ST and selected in the presence of G418, zeocin, and hygromycin. Those cells expressing a significant amount of HNK-1 glycan, assessed by immunostaining with anti-HNK-1 antibody (Becton Dickinson), were chosen and designated as Lec1-core 2·HNK-1. As the second antibody, fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat (Fab′)2 fragment specific to mouse IgG (for anti-NCAM antibody) or IgM (for HNK-1 antibody and M6749 antibody) was used. In parallel, Lec1 cells stably expressing GlcAT-P or HNK-1ST alone or GlcAT-P and HNK-1ST together were established. Lec1 cells expressing the HNK-1 glycan were transiently transfected with pIG-NCAM·IgG or pIG-NCAM(MSD)·IgG with or without pcDNAI-Core2GlcNAcT-I, using LipofectAMINE Plus™ as described previously (29Ong E.

The medium was changed to serum-free medium 24 h after the transfection and cultured for an additional 48 h. NCAM·IgG in the cultured medium was adsorbed to protein A-agarose as described before (8Angata K. Suzuki M. Fukuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28524-28532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). NCAM·IgG molecules eluted from the medium were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide (5%) gel electrophoresis and transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The blot was then incubated with anti-NCAM antibody, anti-HNK-1 antibody, or M6749 antibody, with a secondary antibody as described before (29Ong E. Yeh J.C. Ding Y. Hindsgaul O. Fukuda M. J. Biol.

Lec2 cells expressing GlcAT-P and HNK-1ST, Lec2-HNK-1, were established as described previously (29Ong E. Yeh J.C. Ding Y. Hindsgaul O. Fukuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5190-5195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Lec2-HNK-1 cells were selected using anti-HNK-1 monoclonal antibody. Lec2 cells expressing GlcAT-P were similarly established and selected by immunofluorescent staining using M6749 monoclonal antibody. Lec2 cells do not synthesize sialylated oligosaccharides due to the defect in CMP-sialic acid transporter in the Golgi (40Deutscher S.L. Nuwayhid N. Stanley P. Briles E.I. Hirschberg C.B. Cell. 1984; 39: 295-299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Lec1-core 2·HNK-1 cells were transiently transfected with pIG-NCAM(MSD)·IgG or pIG-NCAM·IgG. Twenty-four hours after the transfection, the medium was replaced with sulfate-free or glucose-free RPMI 1640 medium containing dialyzed 10% fetal calf serum in the presence of Na2[35S]O4 (100 μCi/ml), [6-3H]GlcNH2 (10 μCi/ml), and [6-3H]Gal (20 μCi/ml) or [6-3H]GlcNH2 (10 μCi/ml) or Na2[35S]O4 (100 μCi/ml) alone (41Hiraoka N.

After a 48-h incubation, the spent medium was harvested, and NCAM·IgG was isolated as described above. After confirming the purity of the isolated samples by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and fluorography, the samples were subjected to oligosaccharide characterization. Metabolically labeled NCAM(MSD)·IgG was digested with Pronase, and labeled glycoproteins were isolated by Sephadex G-25 gel filtration as described previously (41Hiraoka N. Petryniak B. Nakayama J.

O-Glycan-containing glycopeptides were separated from high mannose glycopeptides and other glycans using ConA-Sepharose affinity chromatography. The purified glycopeptides were subjected to alkaline reductive treatment to release O-linked oligosaccharides as described previously (41Hiraoka N. Petryniak B. Nakayama J. Tsuboi S. Suzuki M.

Oligosaccharides were applied to a Poly-Prep column (Bio-Rad) containing 2 ml of anion-exchange QAE-Sephadex A-25. The resin was equilibrated with 2 mm pyridine-acetate buffer, pH 5.5, and eluted in a stepwise manner with 6 ml each of 70 mm, 250 mm, and 1 m NaCl in 2 mmpyridine-acetate buffer, pH 5.5. Fractions (1 ml) were collected, and aliquots were taken for determination of radioactivity. The oligosaccharides eluted with 1 m NaCl were digested with Arthrobacter sialidase (Sigma) to remove sialic acid and subjected to QAE-Sephadex A-25 column chromatography. Those eluted with 1 m NaCl after sialidase treatment were subjected to structural characterization. The O-linked glycans were subjected to solvolysis to remove a sulfate group as described previously (41Hiraoka N. Petryniak B. Nakayama J. Tsuboi S. Suzuki M. Yeh J-C. Izawa D. Tanaka T. Miyasaka M.

The resultant oligosaccharides, purified by QAE-Sephadex chromatography, were digested with 125 milliunits of Escherichia coli β-glucuronidase (Sigma) in 50 μl of the reaction mixture under the same conditions as described previously (11Chou D.K.

The obtained oligosaccharides were analyzed on an AX-5 amino-bonded column using a Gilson 306 HPLC apparatus at a flow rate of 0.8 ml/min. The column was equilibrated with 90% solvent A (80% acetonitrile, 20% 15 mm KH2PO4) and 10% of solvent B (40% acetonitrile, 60% 15 mmKH2PO4). After 5 min, the elution was carried out by linear gradient from 10% of solvent B to 100% of solvent B in 60 min. The column was finally washed for 5 min with solvent B. Fractions were collected every minute, and aliquots were taken for determination of the radioactivity by scintillation counting. Oligosaccharides were oxidized with 50 mm NaIO4 in 50 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 4.5, at room temperature, and oxidized samples were reduced as described previously (43Carlsson S.R. Sasaki H. Fukuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 12787-12795Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The samples, after destroying NaBH4 by acetic acid, were passed over a small column of Dowex 50 × 8 and dried after the addition of methanol. The samples were then hydrolyzed in 0.01 m HCl at 80 °C for 1 h, neutralized with 0.1 m Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.5, and applied to a column (1 × 120 cm) of Bio-Gel P-4 (200–400-mesh) equilibrated with 0.1 mpyridine-acetate buffer, pH 5.5. Oligosaccharides were also separated by QAE-Sephadex A-25 column chromatography as described above. To assay the activities of GlcAT-P and HNK-1ST, soluble protein A-GlcAT-P and soluble protein A-HNK-1ST were prepared and adsorbed to IgG-Sepharose as described previously (33Ong E. Yeh J-C. Ding Y.

To assay for GlcAT-P activity, the reaction mixture (100 μl) consisted of 500 μmacceptors, 0.1 m HEPES buffer, pH 6.5, 10 mmMnCl2, 10 mm of galactonic acid-γ-lactone, 50 μl of the soluble chimeric enzyme attached to beads, and 50 μm UDP-[14C]GlcA (294 mCi/mmol, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The reaction mixture was incubated for 3 h at 37 °C, and the reaction was stopped by adding 50 mm(final concentration) EDTA. To assay for HNK-1ST activity, the donor, 3′-phosphate 5′-phospho-[35S]sulfate, and various amounts of an acceptor were incubated with a solution of the 50% suspension of the chimeric protein A-HNK-1ST attached to beads under the conditions described previously (29Ong E.

https://openalex.org/W2096723148,"ALF (TFIIAα/β-like factor) is a germ cell-specific counterpart of the large (α/β) subunit of general transcription factor TFIIA. Here we isolated homologous GC-rich promoters from the mouse and human ALF genes and used promoter deletion analysis to identify sequences active in COS-7 and 293 cells. Further, bisulfite sequence analysis of the mouse ALF promoter showed that all 21 CpG dinucleotides between −179 and +207 were partially methylated in five somatic tissues, brain, heart, liver, lung, and muscle, and in epididymal spermatozoa from adult mice. In contrast, DNA from prepubertal mouse testis and from purified spermatocytes were unmethylated except at C+19G and C+170G. We also found that ALF expression correlates with a strong promoter-proximal DNase I-hypersensitive site present in nuclei from testis but not from liver. Finally we show that in vitro methylation of the ALF promoter inhibits activity and that 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine treatment reactivates the endogenous ALF gene in a panel of seven different mouse and human somatic cell lines. Overall the results show that silencing in somatic cells is methylation-dependent and reversible and that a unique CpG-specific methylation pattern at the ALF promoter precedes expression in pachytene spermatocytes. This pattern is transient as remethylation of the ALF promoter in haploid germ cell DNA has occurred by the time spermatozoa are present in the epididymis.

For instance, the Drosophila TAFII80-related cannonball gene is expressed only in testis (4Hiller M.A. Lin T.-Y. Wood C. Fuller M.T. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1021-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), the mouse TRF2/TLF gene is preferentially expressed in testis (5Martianov I. Fimia G.-M. Dierich A. Parvinen M.

Hammer R.E. Tjian R. Nature. 2001; 293: 2084-2087Google Scholar). These factors, as well as ALF, may be present in germ cell-specific preinitiation or coactivator complexes necessary for gametogenic or developmental patterns of gene expression (8Veenstra G.J.C. Wolffe A.P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 665-671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In fact, mutations in the cannonball and TRF2/TLF genes cause defects in spermatogenesis (4Hiller M.A. Lin T.-Y. Wood C. Fuller M.T.

Tjian R. Nature. 2001; 293: 2084-2087Google Scholar), and DrosophilaTAFII60 mutants show defects in both male and female germ cell development (9Aoyagi N. Wassarman D.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 6808-6819Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Expression of the RNA polymerase II machinery in testis is tightly controlled during mouse development. In particular, genes for testis-specific factors such as ALF and TRF2/TLF and for non-tissue-specific factors such as TBP, TFIIAα/β, TFIIAγ, and TFIIB genes are turned on or up-regulated, respectively, in prepubertal mice at postnatal day 14 (3Han S.

The timing of expression corresponds with the appearance of primary spermatocytes in the pachytene stage of meiotic prophase (12McCarrey J.R. Desjardins C. Ewing L.L. Cell and Molecular Biology of the Testis. Oxford University Press, New York1993: 58-89Google Scholar). Interestingly meiotic gene expression often involves initiation at promoters that are distinct from those utilized in somatic tissues. For instance, the human TRF2/TLF gene initiates from a testis-specific promoter that is separate from its weak somatic cell promoter (13Teichmann M. Wang Z. Martinez E. Tjernberg A. Zhang D. Vollmer F. Chait B.T. Roeder R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13720-23725Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Likewise the mouse TBP gene initiates from five unique testis-specific promoters in addition to its normal somatic cell promoter (14Schmidt E.E. Ohbayashi T. Makino Y. Tamura T Schibler U. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5326-5334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In contrast, the tissue-specific ALF gene is only transcribed from a germ cell-specific promoter. At present, the mechanisms that control the tissue-specific expression and collective up-regulation of general transcription factor genes in meiotic prophase are not known. Previous studies have shown some germ cell-specific genes to be regulated by methylation at CpG dinucleotides, an epigenetic modification catalyzed by a family of CpG-specific DNA methyltransferases (15Bestor T.H. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 2395-2402Crossref PubMed Scopus (1594) Google Scholar, 16Bird A.P. Wolffe A.P.

For example, the promoters of the germ cell-specific cyclin A1, Ldh-C, MAGE,Pdha-2, Pgk-2, tH2B, and Tnp1 genes contain CpG sites that are methylated in somatic tissues and unmethylated in testis (18Ariel M.

The methylated promoter would presumably be packaged into an inactive chromatin configuration through the action of methyl-CpG-binding domain proteins and associated histone deacetylases (16Bird A.P. Wolffe A.P. Cell. 1999; 99: 451-454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1551) Google Scholar, 25Ballestar E. Wolffe A.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar), whereas the unmethylated promoter present in germ cells would be accessible to the transcription machinery. However, while a role for methylation in controlling X-linked and imprinted genes has been established (26Li E. Beard C. Jaenisch R. Nature. 1993; 366: 362-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (1761) Google Scholar, 27Panning B. Jaenisch R. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1991-2002Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar), the correlation between methylation and tissue-specific or developmentally regulated gene expression is not absolute (28Bird A.P. Nature. 1986; 321: 209-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (3013) Google Scholar, 29Walsh C.P. Bestor T.H. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 26-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar, 30Choi Y.-C. Aizawa A. Hecht N.B. Mamm. Genome. 1997; 8: 317-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Still these studies raise the possibility that the differential expression of genes encoding the RNA polymerase II machinery in somatic and germ line tissues might involve DNA methylation. Here we examine mechanisms that control expression of the germ cell-specific transcription factor ALF. We isolated homologous GC-rich promoters of the mouse and human ALF genes, characterized core promoter elements required for expression in vivo, and found that the endogenous ALF promoter is accessible to DNase I in testis but not liver. Together with an analysis of CpG-specific methylation patterns, the results suggest that methylation and chromatin inaccessibility are associated with silencing in somatic cells and show that this effect can be reversed by 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine (azaC). The data also reveal unique CpG- and cell-specific patterns of methylation at the ALF promoter and demonstrate that changes in those patterns occur during germ cell differentiation. The mouse ALF gene was isolated in a PCR-based screen of a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) library (Incyte Genomics) using mALF-10 (5′-GCTGGCATGGCCTTCATCAACCTGGTG-3′) and mALF-11 (5′-CCCGCACGCCCTCGATGACATCTTCAA-3′). One clone (26090) was full-length, and a 7.0-kb BglII fragment that contained Exons 1–3 (GenBankTM accession no. AF452125) was isolated and subcloned into pRSET (Invitrogen). A human BAC 96012D that contains the human ALF gene was purchased from Research Genetics (GenBankTM accession no. AC073082). Human testicular embryonal carcinoma NTERA-2 cl.D1 and mouse spermatogonia GC-1 spg cell lines were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). The human embryonal kidney 293 cell line was a gift from Dr. Santosh D'Mello. The human lung cancer cell line HCC38 was a gift from Dr. John Minna at Southwestern Medical Center. The human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y and mouse neuroblastoma NIE/115 cell lines were gifts from Dr. Gail Breen. All cells except HCC38 were grown at 37 °C in 5–10% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, streptomycin (100 μg/ml), and penicillin (100 units/ml). HCC38 was grown in RPMI 1640 medium with 5% fetal bovine serum. To make hybrid genomic DNA-cDNA RNase protection assay (RPA) constructs, the mouse ALF promoter and Exon 1 was amplified from BAC 26090 with either mALFrp-1 (5′-CCGGAATTCAAGCGAGCCTGGCGGCTCTC-3′) and mALF-6 (5′-CACCAGGTTGATGAAGGCCATGCCAG-3′) to give a 93-bp product called PCR I or with mALFrp-2 (5′-CCGGAATTCTCGCGGTTGCGCAGCAACG-3′) and mALF-6 to generate a 126-bp product called PCR II. Exons 1 and 2 were amplified from the mouse ALF cDNA using ALFrp-3 (5′-ATACGAGCTCCTTTCAACACCTGCTCCTCGAT-3′) and mALF-10 (5′-GCTGGCATGGCCTTCATCAACCTGGTG-3′) to generate a 129-bp product called PCR III. PCR products were digested with HaeIII and ligated to make short (PCR I-PCR III) and long (PCR II-PCR III) fragments. These were digested with EcoRI and SacI and subcloned into pGEM T-Easy (Promega). A mouse angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) gene construct was prepared as described previously (31Howard T.E. Shai S.-Y. Langford K.G. Martin B.M. Bernstein K.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 4294-4302Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). RPA was performed using total RNA from the testis of 40-day-old mice hybridized with 1 × 104 cpm/μg [α-32P]UTP-labeled sense or antisense RNA using the RPAIII kit (Ambion). The mouse and human ALF promoters were amplified by PCR from the human and mouse BAC clones. For the human gene, reactions contained hALFpa-2 (5′-GACAGCACCTCCAGCACCTG-3′) together with one of eight primers: hALFpa-0 (5′-AGCCTGGGCACCATTGAGCA-3′), hALFpa-3 (5′-GTGATCATGCCACTGCACTGCA-3′), hALFpa-4 (5′-GATGCTGCTGTACCACGCTG-3′), hALFpa-5 (5′-CTAGACCCAACCTAACCATCCG-3′), hALFpa-7 (5′-CGACCGCCTCTCCGCCTTGACC-3′), hALFpa-8 (5′-CCGCTCCATCTATTAACGTTCTC-3′), hALFpa-9 (5′-CGTTCTCCGTGGTTGCGCACCT-3′), or hALFpa-6 (5′-CGTTCAAAACGTGCCCAGTG-3′). For the mouse gene, reactions contained mALFpa-1 (5′-GCCAGCCGCTCTGTGCCTAACC-3′) together with one of four primers: mALFpa-2 (5′-ACTTCTGCCTGAGGACTGGGGA-3′), mALFpa-3 (5′-CCTACGGAGAACAGAGGACAGC-3′), mALFpa-4 (5′-GAGGTTGCCCCATCGACCTGAC-3′), or mALF-pa-5 (5′-AGCAACGAGGACCCACGGTTCA-3′). Each 3′-primer contains an XhoI site, while all but one 5′-primer contains a KpnI site (hALFpa-0 contains a SacI site). The amplified fragments were inserted upstream of the firefly luciferase reporter gene in the pGL3 Enhancer plasmid (Promega). Mutagenesis was carried out using mALFpa-7m (5′-GAGGACCCACGGTGTGCTCGCGAGCCTGG-3′) in which the TTCAAAA sequence was replaced with TGTGCTC. PCR with mALFpa-7m and mALFpa-1 was performed with pmALF216 as the template. The amplified fragment was used as a primer with mALFpa-4 in a second PCR that was cloned into the pGL3 Enhancer plasmid. COS-7 and 293 cells in a 24-well plate were grown to 50–80% confluence and transfected with 0.2 μg of DNA using the FuGENE 6 reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Transfections also contained 2.5 ng of pCMV Sport-β-gal DNA (ATCC) to monitor efficiency. Two days later whole cell extracts from triplicate transfections were assayed using the Luciferase Assay System (Promega) and a Turner TD-20e luminometer. Results are expressed as luciferase activity/β-galactosidase activity. Mouse liver and testis nuclei were prepared as described previously (32Sierra F. Tian J.M. Schibler U. Hames B.D. Higgins S.J. Gene Transcription, a Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, New York1993: 129-131Google Scholar) with several modifications. Tissues were homogenized in 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 15 mm KCl, 0.15 mm spermine, 0.5 mm spermidine, 1 mm EDTA, 2.4 msucrose, 1% low fat powdered milk, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The homogenate was transferred to an SW27 rotor tube that contained a cushion of 10 ml of homogenization buffer without milk. Nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation at 75,000 × g for 60 min at 4 °C and resuspended in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mmEDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride at a concentration of 10 A260 units/ml. Aliquots of 200 μl were added to 100 μl of the same buffer supplemented with 15 mmMgCl2 and 4 mm CaCl2, and 0.5–5 units of DNase I (Promega) were added for 10 min at 37 °C. Reactions were stopped by addition of EDTA to 40 mm and SDS to 1% (v/v), and DNA was purified after overnight incubation at 55 °C with 400 μg/ml proteinase K. PvuII-digested DNA was analyzed by Southern analysis using a random-primed PCR fragment prepared with mALFpa-3 and mALFpa-9 (5′-AGATGTTATTCCTGTTTTTACC-3′). Genomic DNA was isolated from liver, brain, heart, lung, muscle, and adult and prepubertal testis of male CD-1 mice. Sodium bisulfite treatment of genomic DNA (33Frommer M. McDonald L.E. Millar D.S. Collis C.M. Watt F. Grigg G.W. Molloy P.L. Paul C.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1827-1831Crossref PubMed Scopus (2512) Google Scholar) was performed as follows. Approximately 2 μg of genomic DNA was denatured in 0.3 m NaOH for 15 min at 37 °C. Freshly prepared sodium bisulfite and hydroquinone (Sigma) were added to a final concentration of 3.1 m and 0.5 mm, respectively, in a final volume of 1 ml. After 8–10 h of incubation at 50 °C, DNA was purified using miniprep columns (Promega) and dissolved in 50 μl of H2O. NaOH was added to 0.3m for 5 min at room temperature and neutralized with 6m ammonium acetate, and DNA was precipitated. PCR amplifications were performed with Elongase (Invitrogen) using bisulfite-treated DNA. Primer methy-4 (5′-TGTTTTGAAATTTGGGTGATTTTA-3′) and methy-3 (5′-AAATAAAATTACCCCATCAACCTAA-3′) were designed to amplify the bottom strand of DNA between −179 and +207 of the mouse ALF promoter. Primers for the mouse TBP gene were methytbp-1 (5′-CTCTACTTAAAAACCTTAATAAAAA-3′) and methytbp-2 (5′-TTAGTTTGATTTTTAGGTTTTTGG-3′). Each primer also contained an EcoRI site to facilitate cloning. Cycling conditions were 2 min at 94 °C, 5 cycles of 1 min at 94 °C, 1 min at 50 °C, 1.5 min at 70 °C, 25 cycles of 30 s at 94 °C, 1 min at 50 °C, 1.5 min at 70 °C, and finishing at 70 °C for 6 min. PCR products were purified by the QIAquick Gel Extraction kit (Qiagen) and sequenced with the Radiolabeled Terminator Cycle Sequencing kit (United States Biochemical Corp.). Liver PCR products were digested with EcoRI and subcloned into pBlueScript II (Stratagene). Human or mouse ALF promoter-reporter constructs (20 μg) were treated with 20 units of SssI methylase (New England BioLabs) for 3 h with 160 μmS-adenosylmethionine (New England BioLabs). Methylation status was verified by digestion with HpaII or MspI. Methylated constructs were transfected into COS-7 or 293 cells and assayed for luciferase activity. Cells were seeded in 60-mm plates and grown to 80% confluence before the addition of 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine (Sigma) at a final concentration of 3 μm (34Jones P.A. Taylor S.M. Cell. 1980; 20: 85-93Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1420) Google Scholar). After 48 h with or without azaC, cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and harvested. RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). Reverse transcription reactions were performed using the Advantage RT-for-PCR kit (CLONTECH) using an oligo(dT)18 primer. PCR amplification to detect the presence of first strand cDNA for human ALF mRNA used 2a2-17 (5′-GGTGCTGTCATGGCCTGCCTCAACCCGG-3′) and 2a2-8 (5′-ATGCTAGCTGAACCACTG-3′). Reactions to detect first strand cDNA for mouse ALF mRNA used mALF-3 (5′-GTTTTACGCCGGAAGACCTGA-3′) and mALF-5 (5′-GTCCTCGTTGTCGCTGCTA-3′). Detection of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase was performed with primers provided in the kit. Unit gravity sedimentation of spermatocyte populations was performed as described previously to obtain populations of pachytene, round, and elongating/elongated spermatocytes that were 70–90% pure (35Meistrich M.L. Methods Cell Bio. 1977; 15: 15-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Mature spermatozoa were isolated from mouse epididymis. Mobility shift assays were performed as described previously using proteins expressed and purified from Escherichia coli by Ni2+ affinity chromatography (1Upadhyaya A.B. Lee S.H. DeJong J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18040-18048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The probes were mALF (5′-GAGGACCCACGGTTCAAAAGCGAGCCTGGC-3′), AdML (5′-AAGGGGGGCTATAAAAGGGGGTGGG-3′), and AdML mutant (5′-AAGGGGGGCTAGAGAAGGGGGTGGG-3′). Genomic DNA blotting was performed with liver or testis DNA digested with PstI, PstI and HpaII, or PstI and MspI. Probe A is a 318-bp fragment produced by PstI-XbaI digestion of pmALF866. Probe B is a 147-bp PCR product made with mALFrp-1 (5′-CTCGCGGTTGCGCAGCAACG-3′) and mALFrp-6 (5′-TGGTCCAACTACTTCCGGTACGGTC-3′). Probe Mito is a 524-bp EcoRI fragment produced from a pBluescript clone that contains an 856-bp PCR product made with two mitochondrial DNA-specific primers, mMito-1 (5′-GGAATTCCGAGCTTGGTGATAGCTGGT-3′) and mMito-2 (5′-GGAATTCTATTCTCCGAGGTCGC-3′). The human ALF gene, located on chromosome 2, is downstream of the stoned B-like factor (SBLF) gene and upstream of the luteinizing hormone receptor gene (Fig. 1A) (3Han S. Zhou L. Upadhyaya A. Lee S.H. Parker K.L. DeJong J. Biol. Reprod. 2001; 64: 507-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). We isolated the mouse ALF gene using a PCR-based screen of a mouse BAC library and mapped the promoter (GenBankTM accession no.AF452125) by RPA. In RPA experiments, total adult mouse testis RNA was annealed to 32P-labeled antisense strand RNAs transcribed from the mALFrp1-3 and mALFrp2-3 constructs. Digestion with RNaseA/RNaseT1 produced seven fragments, indicating that transcription initiates from one of seven sites within a 44-nucleotide window (Fig. 1B, lanes 5 and 7). The major site of initiation (site 3) is designated as position +1 (Fig. 1C), and the initiating ATG is located 27 nucleotides downstream. The mouse ACE gene was used as a control for RPA (Fig. 1B, lane 9) (31Howard T.E. Shai S.-Y. Langford K.G. Martin B.M. Bernstein K.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 4294-4302Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). An alignment of promoter-proximal sequences from the mouse and human ALF genes is shown in Fig. 1C. The sequences are 42% identical between −200 and −101 (numbering refers to the mouse promoter), 68% identical between −100 and −1, and 79% identical in Exon 1. Sequences outside these regions were only weakly similar. Both promoters are GC-rich (for mouse: 51% between −200 and −101, 71% between −100 and −1, 57% in Exon 1, and 58% between +48 and +148) and contain many CpG sites in their promoter regions (Fig. 1D). A GC box (GGGCGG in mouse and GGGCGT in human) at −90 is predicted to bind the Sp1 transcription factor. In addition, a conserved TATA-like element (TTCAAA) is located 35 nucleotides upstream of initiation site 3, and a similar element is present in the TRF2/TLF gene (GenBankTM accession no. NM004865) (13Teichmann M. Wang Z. Martinez E. Tjernberg A. Zhang D. Vollmer F. Chait B.T. Roeder R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13720-23725Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Computer analysis also revealed putative binding sites for cAMP-response element-binding protein, AP1, upstream stimulatory factor, CCTC-binding factor, and other factors. These sites were not analyzed further as they were not conserved. To test whether human ALF promoter constructs were active in somatic cells, we fused a series of truncated promoters to a luciferase reporter (phALF2693, phALF1029, phALF489, phALF219, phALF168, phALF130, phALF84, and phALF53) (Fig. 2A) and transfected them into COS-7 and 293 cells. Although the endogenous ALF gene is silent in somatic tissues, these deletion constructs were expressed to varying levels (Fig. 2B). The highest activity (∼50% of the level seen with pGL3 Control, a vector that contains the SV40 promoter and enhancer) was observed with phALF219 in 293 cells, while the shortest construct, phALF53, was the least active. Mouse ALF promoter constructs (pmALF866, pmALF507, pmALF216, and pmALF57) (Fig. 2A) were also active in COS-7 and 293 cells (Fig. 2B). The highest activity (∼95% of the level seen with the pGL3 Control) was seen with pmALF216 in 293 cells, while the shortest construct, pmALF57, was the least active. The background level of luciferase activity was determined using the promoter-less pGL3 Enhancer vector. We next evaluated properties of the conserved TATA-like TTCAAA element. Bandshift reactions were performed using the AdML TATA or mouse ALF TTCAAA boxes in the presence of TBP and either TFIIA or ALF (Fig. 2C). TBP-dependent complexes were formed on the mALF TTCAAA element (lanes 1 and 5), and they were competed by unlabeled mALF TTCAAA or AdML TATA oligonucleotides (lanes 2, 3,6, and 7) but not by an AdML mutant (lanes 4 and 8). To test the functional importance of the TTCAAA element, we changed it from TTCAAAA to TGTGCTC (pmALF216mut) so that it was no longer recognized by TBP (data not shown). Surprisingly transfection analysis showed the pmALF216mut construct was as active as wild type pmALF216 (Fig. 2B). Taken together the results of these assays suggest ALF is controlled by a short, GC-rich, and TATA-less promoter (see “Discussion”). We wished to know whether the ALF promoter was accessible in testis where it is expressed and inaccessible in a somatic tissue where it is silent. To address this question, we digested nuclear chromatin from testis and liver with DNase I. Following digestion, the restriction enzyme PvuII was used to generate a 2.5-kb fragment that spanned Exon 1 of the ALF promoter (Fig. 3). In the presence of DNase I, a fragment of 0.65 kb was produced in chromatin from both liver and testis (lanes 2, 3,5, and 6). This band reflects a constitutive hypersensitive site located ∼100 nucleotides downstream of Exon 1. In addition, a small and somewhat broad band of ∼0.45 kb was observed only in testis (lanes 5 and 6). This tissue-specific hypersensitive site maps within the GC-rich ALF promoter. The results show that ALF expression is associated with an accessible chromatin configuration, presumably to facilitate binding of the RNA polymerase II machinery. The observation that ALF promoter constructs were active in somatic cells whereas the endogenous gene is silent suggests regulation by an epigenetic mechanism. In particular, the presence of multiple CpG dinucleotides in the ALF promoter points to a possible role for cytosine methylation. To test this possibility, genomic DNA from mouse liver or testis was digested with the methylation-sensitive HpaII and methylation-insensitive MspI restriction enzymes. We focused the analysis on four sites (CCGG) located in a 2.1-kb PstI fragment spanning the promoter, Exon 1, and part of Intron 1 (Fig. 4A). Digestion of liver DNA with PstI/HpaII and hybridization with probe A revealed a strong 0.7-kb band and a weaker undigested band of 2.1 kb (Fig. 4B, lane 3). Digestion of liver DNA with PstI/HpaII and hybridization with probe B showed a weak 0.55-kb band and two partial digestion products of 2.1 and 1.4 kb (lane 10). Based on the intensities of the partially digested fragments, we estimate that ∼5% of genomic DNAs are methylated at the HpaII site located just upstream of the transcription start site, while the three downstream sites are methylated to near completion. In contrast, results with testis genomic DNA revealed complete digestion to either the 0.7-kb band (lane 6) or the 0.55-kb band (lane 13), indicating that these sites are not methylated in this tissue. To show that the results in Fig. 4B were not due to incomplete digestion, DNA from both tissues was hybridized with a mitochondrial DNA probe (probe mito). This genome is unmethylated and should be fully digested with either HpaII or MspI. The results show the expected mitochondrial DNA digestion products of 1.7"

It also serves as the hydrophobic anchor of lipopolysaccharide and is a potent activator of the innate immune response. Lipid A molecules from the genus Bordetella are reported to exhibit unusual structural asymmetry with respect to the acyl chains at the 3- and 3′-positions. These acyl chains are attached by UDP -N-acetylglucosamine acyltransferase (LpxA). To determine the origin of the acyl variability, the single lpxA ortholog present in each of the genomes of Bordetella bronchiseptica(lpxABr), Bordetella parapertussis(lpxAPa), and Bordetella pertussis (lpxAPe) was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. In contrast to all LpxA proteins studied to date, LpxABr and LpxAPe display relaxed acyl chain length specificity in vitro, utilizing C10OH-ACP, C12OH-ACP, and C14OH-ACP at similar rates. Furthermore, hybrid lipid A molecules synthesized at 42 °C by an E. coli lpxA mutant complemented with lpxAPe contain C10OH, C12OH, and C14OH at both the 3- and 3′-positions, as determined by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. In contrast, LpxA from B. parapertussis did not display relaxed specificity but was selective for C10OH-ACP. This study provides an enzymatic explanation for some of the unusual acyl chain variations found in Bordetella lipid A.

Early understanding of LPS has come from studies in the Enterobacteriaceae (1Luderitz O., G, C. Risse H.J. Ruschmann E. Schlecht S. Schmidt G. Shulte-Holthausen H. Wheat R. Westphal O. Ann. N. Y.

In these organisms the molecule consists of the following three domains: the lipid A, the core oligosaccharide, and the O-antigen polysaccharide. Lipid A, the hydrophobic anchor of LPS, is generally an acylated and phosphorylated disaccharide of glucosamine (reviewed by Rick and Raetz (3Rick P.D. Raetz C.R.H. Brade H. Opal S.M. Vogel S.N. Morrison D.C. Endotoxin in Health and Disease. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1999: 283-304Google Scholar)). The structure, biosynthesis, and biological properties of LPS have been extensively studied in a wide variety of systems, although the molecule is best understood in Escherichia coli (reviewed by Raetz (4Raetz C.R.H. Neidhardt F.C. Escherichia coli and Salmonella: Cellular and Molecular Biology. 1. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1996: 1035-1063Google Scholar)). The minimal LPS structure required for full viability of E. coli under laboratory conditions is lipid A bearing two 2-keto-3-deoxy-d-manno-octulosonic acid (Kdo) residues (Fig. 1). In addition, Kdo2-lipid A, or Re endotoxin, is a fully active agonist of the TLR-4 receptor-mediated inflammatory response (5Wyckoff T.J.O. Raetz C.R.H. Jackman J.E.

This acylation is performed by UDP-GlcNAc acyltransferase, encoded by the gene lpxA (8Coleman J. Raetz C.R.H. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 1268-1274Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Crowell D.N.

Raetz C.R.H. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 168: 152-159Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The crystal structure of E. coli LpxA (LpxAEc) has been determined to 2.6 Å resolution (17Raetz C.R.H. Roderick S.L. Science. 1995; 270: 997-1000Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar), and its substrate binding and active sites have been partially characterized (18Wyckoff T.J.O. Lin S. Cotter R.J.

Based on site-directed mutagenesis, it has been proposed that the active site lies in a cleft between its subunits; His-125 is proposed to serve as a general base to facilitate the direct acyl transfer from the acyl-acyl carrier protein (ACP) to UDP-GlcNAc, forming an ester linkage to the sugar (19Wyckoff T.J.O. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27047-27055Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). In most bacteria, LpxA is highly specific with regard to its acyl-ACP substrate. LpxAEc is 50-fold more active with its native substrate, β-OH myristoyl-ACP (C14OH-ACP), than with either β-OH palmitoyl-ACP (C16OH-ACP) (20Anderson M. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol.

All three pathogens are very closely related in terms of multilocus enzyme electrophoresis, DNA hybridization, and DNA sequence analyses (38van der Zee A. Mooi F. Van Embden J. Musser J. J.

The mechanistic basis for their different host ranges and pathogenicities are unknown but are likely to depend on differences in surface structures between the three pathogens. Structural studies of the LPS molecules from the bordetellae indicate that they share many common structural features (40Lebbar S. Caroff M. Szabo L. Merienne C. Szilogyi L. Carbohydr. Res. 1994; 259: 257-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 41Caroff M. Chaby R. Karibian D. Perry J. Deprun C. Szabo L. J.

John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1988: 247-271Google Scholar); however, their lipid A moieties have organism-specific acylation patterns (Fig. 2) apart from those from Bordetella hinzii and Bordetella trematum which are identical (43Caroff M. Aussel L. Zarrouk H. Martin A. et al.J. Endotoxin Res. 2001; 7: 63-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). B. bronchiseptica and B. hinzii are the only bordetellae in which hexa-acylated lipid A is reported (44Aussel L. Brisson J.R. Perry M.B. Caroff M. Rapid Commun. Mass Spectrom. 2000; 14: 595-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 45Zarrouk H. Karibian D. Bodie S. Perry M.B. Richards J.C. Caroff M. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 3756-3760Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The lipid A structures of other Bordetella species studied to date contain fewer acyl chains and are thus likely to have reduced endotoxin activity (46Khan S.A. Everest P. Servos S. Foxwell N. Zahringer U. Brade H. Rietschel E.T. Dougan G. Charles I.G. Maskell D.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 29: 571-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). In addition to interspecies variation,B. bronchiseptica lipid A structures vary between strains, with unusual fatty acyl substitutions on the diglucosamine backbone (45Zarrouk H. Karibian D. Bodie S. Perry M.B. Richards J.C. Caroff M. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 3756-3760Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Interestingly, all reported Bordetella lipid A structures exhibit unexpected acyl chain asymmetry between the 3- and 3′-positions. The generation of this asymmetry is not currently understood but might involve either multiple LpxA isoforms or a single LpxA with relaxed acyl-ACP specificity. In this work, we demonstrate that a single lpxA gene is present in each of the genomes of B. pertussis, B. bronchiseptica, and B. parapertussis. The presence of a single lpxA gene in each organism despite the asymmetry of the primary ester-linked acyl residues suggested that these bacteria have a single UDP-GlcNAc O-acyltransferase of relaxed substrate specificity. We have overexpressed these genes in E. coli and have assayed extracts of these constructs to examine this hypothesis. B. pertussis LpxA (LpxAPe) and B. bronchiseptica LpxA (LpxABr) transfer C10OH, C12OH, and C14OH acyl moieties from acyl-ACP to UDP-GlcNAc. However, both enzymes utilize C10OH-ACP and C14OH-ACP in 2-fold preference to C12OH-ACP. In contrast, B. parapertussis LpxA (LpxAPa) displays a strong preference for C10OH-ACP over all other acyl-ACPs tested.

A 0.2-ml sample of supernatant was then recovered. PCR was performed using 1 μl of this supernatant. Each 50-μl PCR was composed of genomic DNA template, buffer as directed by the manufacturer, dNTPs (25 mm each), 20 ng of each primer, 5% (v/v) Me2SO, 5 mmMgCl2, and 2.5 units of polymerase.lpxABr was amplified using Pwo polymerase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). lpxAPe and lpxAPa were amplified using Vent polymerase (New England Biolabs). The same primers were used for all three species as the sequences are identical in this region. The primers used were 5′ TTTTTTCATATGTCAGGAAACATCCAT 3′ (N terminus) and 5′ TTTTTTAAGCTTTCATGGCCGGATGATG 3′. The N-terminal primer incorporated an NdeI site, and the C-terminal primer incorporated an Hin dIII site for subsequent cloning into pET21a. PCR was performed on a PerkinElmer Life Sciences 9600 automated cycler. A 5-min denaturing step at 94 °C was followed by 30 cycles of 94 (75 s), 55 (75 s), and 72 °C (120 s) with a final elongation step of 72 °C for 7 min. PCRs were treated with the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase and T4 polynucleotide kinase with the addition of 1 mm ATP for 30 min at 37 °C to create blunt ends and to 5′-phosphorylate PCR products. These enzymes were then inactivated by heat denaturation at 65 °C for 30 min. PCRs were then analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis prior to gel purification and cloning. Purified products were cloned into pUC18 using the Ready-to-GoTM system (Amersham Biosciences) and then subcloned into pET21a (Novagen) for protein expression.lpxAPe was also subcloned from pET21a into pBluescript II SK+ (Stratagene) for constitutive expression in E. coli. This pBluescript construct was transformed into RO138 for complementation and hybrid lipid A isolation. DNA was sequenced using an automated sequencer at the Department of Genetics, University of Cambridge, using universal M13 forward and reverse primers and the lpxA-specific primers: 5′ GAGCAAAAGCGGTAGAAG 3′; 5′ ACTGGTCATCGGCGACCG 3′; 5′ GATCTTGGCGAACTGGTG 3′; and 5′GTCAATGTCGAAGGCTTG 3′. Additional DNA sequencing was performed by Duke University DNA Analysis Facility on an Applied Biosystems 377 instrument using Novagen T7 promoter and terminator primers. DNA sequence was analyzed using the GCG software package (Wisconsin Package version 10.0, Genetics Computer Group, Madison, WI). To screen for overexpressing clones, BL21 (DE3) pLysS cultures carrying the relevant pET construct were grown to A600 = 0.4. Expression was induced by addition of isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside to a concentration of 1 mm and incubation at 37 °C for 4 h. Overexpression was confirmed by running a portion of the induced culture on 12% SDS-PAGE gels followed by Coomassie Blue staining (52Ausubel, F. M., Brent, R., Kingston, R. E., Moore, D. D., Seidman, J. G., Smith, J. A., and Struhl, K. (eds) (1989) Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, John Wiley & Sons, New YorkGoogle Scholar). Non-induced cultures and cultures carrying pET vector alone acted as controls to demonstrate that the overexpressed proteins observed were dependent on induction and the presence of a cloned lpxA gene. To prepare cell lysates containing overexpressed Bordetella LpxA for use in assays, expression cultures were grown at 37 °C in 50 ml of LB broth containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin to an A600 = 0.6, induced with isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside, and grown for a further 3 h. At the end of this period, the cultures were chilled on ice for 10 min and then harvested by centrifugation at 4000 ×g at 4 °C for 10 min. The cell pellets were resuspended in 10 ml of ice-cold buffer (sterile 100 mm potassium phosphate at pH 7.0 with 200 mm NaCl and 20% glycerol) per 50 ml of original culture, and the cells were centrifuged again at 4000 × g at 4 °C for 10 min. Each washed cell pellet was resuspended in 2 ml of the same buffer and frozen at −20 °C overnight. The cells were then thawed on ice and broken by one passage through a French pressure cell at 14,000 pounds/square inch. The cell lysates were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C to remove cellular debris, and the supernatants (extracts) were collected and stored at −80 °C. Before use in the activity assays, the protein concentrations of these extracts were quantified using the Pierce bicinchoninic acid assay kit (53Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K.

The data were collected using a Molecular Devices SpectraMax 250 plate reader and analyzed relative to a bovine serum albumin standard with the software package Softmax Pro. The extracts were also characterized by SDS-PAGE (Bio-Rad mini-protean system) to assess the extent of LpxA overproduction. The [α-32P]UDP-GlcNAc and all acyl-ACP substrates were prepared as described previously (21Odegaard T.J. Kaltashov I.A. Cotter R.J. Steeghs L. van der Lry P. Khan S. Maskell D.J. Raetz R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19688-19696Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), with the addition, as necessary, of an octyl-Sepharose column step to remove residual ACP from the acyl-ACP preparations. The purity of these acyl donors was verified by urea gel electrophoresis (data not shown). The LpxA assay follows the conversion of [α-32P]UDP-GlcNAc to [α-32P]UDP-(3-O-acyl)-GlcNAc based on a mobility shift during TLC on a silica plate (21Odegaard T.J. Kaltashov I.A. Cotter R.J.

Each 10-μl reaction contained 40 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.2 mg/ml L-573,655, 10 μm of one or more acyl donors (as indicated), 10 μm UDP-GlcNAc, [α-32P]UDP-GlcNAc (2 × 105dpm/reaction), and an appropriate amount of cell-free lysate extract. L-573,655 prevents the further metabolism of the LpxA reaction product by inhibition of LpxC (47Onishi H.R. Pelak B.A. Gerckens L.S. Silver L.L. Kahan F.M. Chen M.H. Patchett A.A. Galloway S.M.

The assays were carried out at 30 °C, and time points were analyzed by spotting 1-μl portions of each reaction mixture onto a silica gel TLC plate. The plate was developed in chloroform/methanol/water/acetic acid (25:15:4:2, v/v) and analyzed by PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics Storm 840 system), using Molecular Dynamics ImageQuant 1.2 for Macintosh. Data were analyzed statistically using Microsoft Excel 2001 and plotted by Abelbeck Kaleidagraph 3.0.5. For structural studies, hybrid lipid A species were isolated and partially purified from an E. coli lpxA2 mutant complemented with LpxAPe. This strain, RO138/pCS561, was grown for 16 h (to stationary phase) at 42 °C in 80 ml of LB with 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 12 μg/ml tetracycline. Extraction, hydrolysis at pH 4.5, and lipid A purification by DE52 chromatography were carried out according to techniques described previously (22Sweet C.R. Lin S. Cotter R.J. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19565-19574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Spectra were acquired in the negative ion and positive ion linear modes by using a Kratos Analytical (Manchester, UK) matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight (MALDI/TOF) mass spectrometer, equipped with a 337 nm nitrogen laser, a 20-kV extraction voltage, and time-delayed extraction. Each spectrum was the average of 50 shots. The matrix was a mixture of saturated 5-aza-2-thiothymine in 50% aqueous acetonitrile and 10% tribasic ammonium citrate (9:1 v/v). The lipid A samples were prepared by solubilizing the lipid in 4:1 v/v chloroform/methanol and then depositing 0.3 μl of the sample, followed by 0.3 μl of matrix, which was allowed to dry at room temperature prior to mass analysis. E. coli lipid A (Sigma) was used as an external standard. To identify Bordetella lpxA genes, genome sequence data were searched for similarities to E. coli LpxA, using tBLASTn run on the Sanger Centre blast server. This identified two open reading frames with similarity to E. coli lpxA in each of B. pertussis, B. bronchiseptica, and B. parapertussis. Further BLAST searches of GenBankTMdatabases with these open reading frames revealed one to be the Bordetella lpxA gene (Fig. 3) and the other to be lpxD, the UDP-3-O-((3 R)-hydroxymyristoyl)-glucosamine N-acyltransferase (data not shown). Both open reading frames were present in the same sequence contig in all three species. As in many other Gram-negative species, these genes are arranged as follows:lpxD, fabZ (encoding (R)-3-hydroxymyristoyl-ACP dehydratase), lpxA, and lpxB (55Schnaitman C.A. Klena J.D. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 655-682Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), within macromolecular biosynthesis operon II (56Tomasiewicz H.G. McHenry C.S. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 5735-5744Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) of the bordetellae. The predicted amino acid sequences of the three BordetellaLpxAs are 53% identical and 67% similar to that of E. coli lpxA and are nearly identical to each other. At position 170, LpxAPa contains serine, whereas the other two contain glycine; at position 229, LpxAPe contains glycine, whereas the other two contain alanine. Thus LpxAPe and LpxABr differ from one another at a single residue; LpxABr and LpxAPa differ from each other at a single residue, and LpxAPe and LpxAPa differ from each other at two residues. The serine in position 170 of LpxAPa is particularly important, as it is analogous to the highly conserved residue Gly-173 in LpxAEc, which is involved in regulation of acyl chain length (18Wyckoff T.J.O.

In Pseudomonas aeruginosa LpxA (LpxAPs), this glycine is replaced by methionine, resulting in a C10OH-ACP-specific enzyme. Furthermore, LpxAEc G173M is specific for C10OH-ACP, and LpxAPs M169G selectively incorporates C14OH-ACP (18Wyckoff T.J.O. Lin S. Cotter R.J. Dotson G.D. et al.J. Biol.

Med. 1992; 326: 800-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). In humans, the gene for FXI is located at the distal end of chromosome 4 (4q35.2) and contains 15 exons spread over ∼25 kb of genomic DNA (3Asakai R. Davie E. Chung D. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 7221-7228Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 4Kato A. Asakai R. Davie E. Aoki N. Cytogenet.

Haemostasis. 2001; 85: 1043-1047Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), a characteristic shared with other blood coagulation proteases (the vitamin K-dependent proteins prothrombin and factors VII, IX, and X). Whereas considerable information is available concerning regulation of tissue-specific expression for the vitamin K-dependent proteases (8Greenberg D. Davie E. Colman R. Hirsh J. Marder V. Clowes A. George J. Hemostasis and Thrombosis: Basic Principles and Clinical Practice. 4th Ed. Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Philadelphia2001: 21-58Google Scholar), little data are available for the FXI gene. Furthermore, extrapolation from data obtained for vitamin K-dependent protease genes to the FXI gene would probably be difficult. The domain structure of FXI differs substantially from the vitamin K-dependent proteins (1Davie E. Fujikawa K. Kisiel W. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 10363-10370Crossref PubMed Scopus (1636) Google Scholar, 2Furie B. Furie B. N. Engl. J. Med. 1992; 326: 800-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar, 5Fujikawa K.

Even the trypsin-like catalytic domain, although homologous to catalytic domains of other clotting enzymes, is encoded by a different number of exons with different intron-exon boundaries (8Greenberg D.

Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Philadelphia2001: 21-58Google Scholar). Indeed, the analyses of protein sequence and gene organization suggest that FXI is more closely related to proteases involved in fibrinolysis and inflammation than it is to other coagulation enzymes (3Asakai R.

For example, a large clinical study suggests that the risk of deep vein thrombosis in the 10% of individuals in a population with the highest plasma FXI levels is more than 2-fold greater than that for the remaining 90% of the population (12Meijers J. Tekelenburg W. Bouma B. Bertina R. Rosendaal F. N. Engl. J. Med. 2000; 342: 696-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar). Therefore, a better understanding of the processes regulating FXI gene expression is required to identify factors that predispose to thromobembolic disease. As an initial step in understanding the regulation of FXI gene expression, we cloned the 5′ upstream region of the human FXI gene and identified start sites for transcription, single nucleotide polymorphisms, and an element required for expression in a hepatocyte cell line. We have determined that the transcription factor hepatocyte nuclear factor 4α (HNF-4α) is required for tissue-specific expression of human FXI. A 2621-base pair fragment of the 5′-flanking region and exon one of the FXI gene was amplified by nested PCR using a Human Genome Walker kit (CLONTECH Laboratories, Palo Alto, CA) and oligonucleotides complementary to overlapping sequences in the known 5′-flanking region of the gene (3Asakai R. Davie E. Chung D. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 7221-7228Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). For purposes of orientation, the first base pair of the published cDNA sequence is bp +1 (Fig. 1) (5Fujikawa K. Chung D. Hendrickson L. Davie E. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 2417-2424Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). The oligonucleotides used for nested PCR are FXI-1, 5′-GAAAAGACCTTGTTGGCTTACTTG-3′ (+40 to +17), and FXI-2, 5′- CTTGCTGCAATTCTTAATAAGGGTG-3′ (+20 to −5). The fragment was sequenced in both directions using a thermo-sequenase radiolabeled terminator sequencing system (Amersham Biosciences). To prepare genomic clones, the 2.6-kb product from the Gene Walker kit or human genomic DNA from normal donors was amplified by PCR using high fidelity PfuTurbo DNA polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The products were ligated into pGEM-T Easy T/A cloning vector (Promega, Madison, WI) and transfected into XL-1 Blue Escherichia coli (Stratagene). DNA from individual clones were sequenced as above. The positions of the human FXI and plasma prekallikrein (PPK, EC 3.4.21.34) genes were located in the public data base of the human genome sequence using Ensembl genome server (www.ensembl.org). The Ensembl gene designation for both FXI (also designated F11) and PPK (also designated KLKB1) is ENSG00000088962. A 12-kilobase sequence encompassing the 3′ end (exons 14 and 15) of the PPK gene and the 5′ end (exons 1 and 2) of the FXI gene was aligned to the sequence of the cloned FXI promoter using MacVector software, version 6.0.1 (Oxford Molecular Group, Oxford, United Kingdom). Two overlapping areas covering base pairs −802 to +16 were amplified from genomic DNA by PCR. The oligonucleotides used to amplify −802 to −370 are 5′-AATCACTTGAACCTGGAAGCGG-3′ (upstream primer) and 5′-CTAGCTGACCTTGAATCTCAAAG-3′ (downstream primer), and the oligonucleotides used for fragment −412 to +16 are 5′-GTCTCCTCCCTCCATTATATTG (upstream primer) and 5′-GAAAAGACCTTGTTGGCTTACTTG (downstream primer). PCR products were size-fractionated on 2% NuSieve-agarose gels (FMC BioProducts, Rockland, ME) and purified with a QIAEX II gel extraction kit (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA). The PCR primers were used to perform ddF in the 5′ and 3′ directions as described previously (13Martincic D. Zimmerman S. Ware R. Sun M. Whitlock J. Gailani D. Blood. 1998; 92: 3309-3317Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides were labeled with [γ-32P]dATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase. Each ddF reaction is 8.0 μl in volume and contains 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.4, 50 mm KCl, 2 mmMgCl2, 20 μm of each dNTP, 100 μm dideoxy-GTP, 1 pmol of 32P-labeled primer, 0.25 units of TaqDNA polymerase, and 10 ng of PCR fragment. Reactions were performed on a PerkinElmer model 460 DNA thermal cycler using the following parameters: denaturation at 94 °C for 45 s, annealing at 60 °C for 30 s, and elongation at 72 °C for 1 min for 30 cycles. PCR reactions were mixed with 16 μl of loading buffer (98% formamide, 10 mm EDTA, bromphenol blue, and xylene cyanol) and size-fractionated at 30 watts for 3 h at room temperature on a 0.5× MDE gel (FMC BioProducts) in 0.5× Tris-boric acid-EDTA buffer. Gels were dried and exposed to x-ray film overnight. The ddF pattern obtained for the cloned promoter fragment was considered to be the wild-type pattern. The DNA base pair sequence of PCR fragments with ddF patterns differing from the wild-type pattern were determined. RNase protection assays were performed using an ribonuclease protection assay kit (RPA III, Ambion, Austin, TX). An antisense RNA probe specific for FXI mRNA was generated by in vitro transcription using T7 RNA polymerase and [α32P]UTP. A 474-bp fragment of the FXI gene (−434 to +40) in pGEM-T T/A Easy vector construct was used as template. The labeled probe (8 × 104 cpm) was incubated with 20 μg of total or 0.6 μg of poly(A) human liver RNA (CLONTECH) in hybridization buffer at 37 °C for 30 min. After incubation with RNase A/RNase T1 mix (supplied by the manufacturer) for 30 min at 37 °C, RNA duplexes were separated on 6% polyacrylamide gels containing 50% urea followed by autoradiography. Hybridization of the probe to yeast tRNA served as a negative control. A 5′-RACE system (Invitrogen) was used according to the manufacturer's instructions. Using total human liver RNA (2 μg) as template, first-strand cDNA synthesis was performed using a primer complimentary to sequence in FXI exon 4, 5′-GGCAGTGTTTCTGTAAC-3′). cDNA was separated from unincorporated dNTP and primer using GlassMax spin cartridges (Invitrogen). A 5′-poly(C) tail was added using dCTP and terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase. Poly(C)-tailed cDNA was amplified directly by PCR using an anchor primer supplied with the kit and a primer complimentary to the FXI coding sequence, 5′-GTGGGATCCTCAGATGGTGAGGC-3′ (+255 to +233 of the cDNA). The PCR product was used as template for a second round of PCR using nested primers, one supplied with the kit and the other complementary to FXI cDNA sequence (+207 to +185), 5′-CTTGGGTGGTAAGTGCAGACTAC-3′. The final PCR product was size-fractionated on a 1.5% agarose gel and then purified using QIAEX II resin. Purified DNA was ligated into pGEM-T Easy T/A cloning vector, and individual clones were sequenced using a primer (5′-TCCTTCAAAGCAGGTGTCCTTC-3′) complementary to sequence in FXI exon 3. A 2615-bp fragment spanning base pairs −2596 to +19 of the FXI gene was amplified by PCR using Pfu Turbo polymerase from the genomic DNA of a healthy volunteer with a normal plasma FXI level. The upstream PCR primer is 5′-CGTTGAGTGGAGATCACACCA-3′, and 3′-primer is 5′-AAGCTTAAGCTTCTCGAGCTTGCTGCAATTCTTAATAAGGGTG-3′. The PCR product was ligated into vector pGL3-Basic (Promega), which places the promoter upstream of the firefly luciferase cDNA. Promoter truncation mutants were prepared by cutting the vector at the 5′ end of the promoter with restriction endonucleases KpnI and Mlu I and then treating with exonuclease III and S1 nuclease (Promega) for various periods of time according to the supplier's instructions. After heating to 70 °C, Klenow enzyme was used to fill in the DNA followed by ligation with T4 DNA ligase. XL-1 Blue E. coli were transformed with the ligation mixtures, and clones were selected for DNA sequencing. A 577-bp promoter fragment in which the ACTTTG sequence between base pairs −370 and −365 was changed to GACAAT (scrambled) and prepared using a Chameleon site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The human hepatoma cell line HepG2 (ATCC HB 8065) and the human epitheloid carcinoma cell line HeLa (ATCC CCL2) were from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). HepG2 cells were grown in Eagle's minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 2 mm l-glutamine, 0.1 mmnon-essential amino acids, 1.5 g/liter sodium bicarbonate, and penicillin/streptomycin. HeLa cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified eagle medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum and penicillin/streptomycin. Cells were grown to 50–70% confluence in 12-well culture plates at 37 °C in a humid atmosphere containing 5% CO2 and then transfected with 1.5 μg of FXI promoter/pGL3 constructs using SuperFect Reagent (Qiagen). For normalization of transfection efficiency, all transfections included 30 ng of pRL-CMV vector (Promega) containing the Renilla luciferase gene under the regulation of a cytomegalovirus promoter. After incubation for 48 h, cells were lysed, and luciferase activity was measured using a Dual-luciferase reporter assay system (Promega). Luminescence was measured on a Monolight 2010 Luminometer (Analytical Luminescence Laboratories, San Diego, CA). The cDNA for rat HNF-4α (14Hadzopoulou-Cladaras M. Kistanova E. Evagelopoulou C. Zeng S. Cladaras C. Ladias J.A.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 539-550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) was a gift from Margarita Cladaras (Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Thessaloniki, Greece) and Josephine Carew and Ken Bauer (Harvard University). The cDNA was ligated into the EcoR1 site of mammalian expression vector pJVCMV (15Sun Y. Gailani D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29023-29028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), which places it under the control of a cytomegalovirus promoter. 1 mg of HNF-4α/pJVCMV, 1 μg of pGL3 vector with or without the 577 proximal base pairs of the FXI promoter, and 30 ng of pRL-CMV were co-transfected into HeLa cells as described above. Promoter activity was determined by the dual-luciferase method. HepG2 or HeLa cells grown to 80% confluence were used for preparing nuclear extract by a modification of the method of Dignam et al. (16Dignam J. Lebovitz R. Roeder R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9164) Google Scholar). Cells were released from flasks with trypsin/EDTA, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and resuspended in 1 ml of hypotonic buffer (20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 40 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mmbenzamidine, and 10 μg/ml pepstatin). Cell membranes were broken with a Dounce homogenizer using Pestle B. Nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation at 2,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C and washed with hypotonic buffer. Pellets were resuspended in high salt extraction buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 420 mm KCl, 25% glycerol, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 40 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm benzamidine, and 10 μg/ml pepstatin), mixed vigorously by vortexing, and placed on ice for 15 min. Suspensions underwent centrifugation at 15,000 ×g for 15 min at 4 °C. Supernatants (nuclear extracts) were stored in aliquots at −80 °C. Samples were examined for degradation by SDS-PAGE. Protein concentration was determined by colorimetric assay (Bio-Rad). Rat hepatocyte nuclear extract was purchased from Geneka Biotechnologies (Montreal, Canada). Two techniques were used to label oligonucleotides. The oligonucleotides were 5′ end-labeled using T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol) for autoradiography. The labeled product had ∼0.5 × 105 cpm/ng. Alternatively, oligonucleotides were labeled with biotin for chemiluminescence using a lightshift chemiluminescent electrophoretic mobility shift assay kit (Pierce). After labeling, complementary strands were mixed together in an equimolar ratio and allowed to anneal for 1 h at 37 °C to form double-stranded probe. Gel mobility shift assays were performed by incubating 0.5 ng of labeled probe with nuclear extract (10 μg) and competing oligonucleotides in binding buffer (10 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 5% glycerol, and 1 μg/μl poly(dI·dC) at room temperature for 30 min. Mixtures were size-fractionated on a non-denaturing 4% polyacrylamide gel followed by drying and autoradiography for 32P-labeled probes or transfer to nitrocellulose membranes and detection by streptavidin-HRP/chemiluminescence for biotin-labeled probes. Supershift reactions were run as described above with the exception that 2 μg of polyclonal anti-HNF-4α antibody H-171, which recognizes human, mouse, and rat HNF-4α (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), was added. A comparison of previously published sequences for the human FXI gene (3Asakai R. Davie E. Chung D. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 7221-7228Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) and cDNA (5Fujikawa K. Chung D. Hendrickson L. Davie E. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 2417-2424Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar) revealed that 275 bp upstream from the 5′ end of intron A (including exon 1) are included in the published gene sequence. We cloned a 2601-bp fragment of the human FXI gene that includes 229 base pairs of the published sequence immediately upstream of exon 1 (3Asakai R. Davie E. Chung D. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 7221-7228Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) and 2372 base pairs of additional 5′ sequence. The published gene sequence agrees exactly with the sequence of the cloned fragment over the 229 base pairs at the 3′ end of the clone (3Asakai R. Davie E. Chung D. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 7221-7228Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). After the clone was completely sequenced, the sequence became available in the public data base for the region of chromosome 4 containing the FXI gene. When the sequences are aligned, there are two single nucleotide insertions in the cloned fragment and nine single nucleotide insertions in the public data base sequence (data not shown). All insertions are located upstream of the region required for proper promoter function in HepG2 hepatocellular carcinoma cells (see below). In addition, the sequences differed at two single base pair locations (single nucleotide polymorphisms) at positions −403 and −273. A partial sequence of the promoter clone is shown in Fig. 1 A. Exon 1 of the human FXI gene is not translated. Therefore, base pair +1 in Fig. 1 was assigned to the first base pair of the published sequence for the human FXI cDNA (5Fujikawa K. Chung D. Hendrickson L. Davie E. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 2417-2424Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). An analysis of the sequence indicates that the human FXI gene lacks CAAT and TATA boxes. There are eleven consecutive adenosine residues between bp −587 and −577 in the sequence in Fig. 1 A. Subcloning of individual FXI alleles from healthy persons revealed that this poly(A) sequence may be 11, 12, or 13 residues in length. The sequence in Fig. 1 A differs from the public data base at two locations ((G/T) at −403 and (C/G) at −273, respectively, indicated by asterisks in Fig. 1 A). Using the ddF technique, we examined the FXI promoter in eight DNA samples from individuals of West African ancestry. These samples were chosen because prior work demonstrated significant FXI gene heterogeneity in this ethnic group (13Martincic D. Zimmerman S. Ware R. Sun M. Whitlock J. Gailani D. Blood. 1998; 92: 3309-3317Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Tarumi T. Martincic D. Whitlock J. Addy J. Williams S. Gailani D. Genomics. 2000; 70: 269-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Positions −403 and −273 appear to be sites of common single nucleotide polymorphisms in this population ((G/T) at position −403 and (C/G) at position −273). At position −403, the allele frequency for G = 0.44 and for T = 0.56, whereas at −273, C = 0.5 and G = 0.5. Interestingly, G −273 was only found in samples with T at −403, suggesting that single nucleotide polymorphisms may be in linkage disequilibrium. A larger population survey involving multiple ethnic groups is currently underway. FXI shares similar structural organization at the protein and gene levels with the serine protease PPK. In humans, the genes for FXI and PPK have been mapped to the long arm of chromosome 4 (4q32.5) (4Kato A. Asakai R. Davie E. Aoki N. Cytogenet. Cell Genet. 1989; 52: 77Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 18Beaubien G. Rosinski-Chupin I. Mattei M. Mbikay M. Chretien M. Seidah N. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1628-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The recent availability of sequence in the public data base for the region of chromosome 4 containing the FXI and PPK genes allows us to determine the relationship of the genes to each other and their orientation on the chromosome. As shown in Fig. 1 B, the two genes are in a head-to-tail orientation with the 5′ end of the PPK gene closest to the telomere and the 3′ end of the FXI gene closest to the centromere. The 5′ end of the FXI promoter clone described in this paper (Fig. 1 B, bp −2596, cross-hatched bar) is located 5182 bp from the 3′ end of the PPK gene stop codon. RNase protection assays and 5′-RACE were employed to identify start sites for transcription using human liver RNA as template (Figs. 1 and 2). Both techniques demonstrate multiple start sites for transcription between bp −30 and −64. Of 26 clones sequenced in the 5′-RACE analysis, seven represent a start site at position −47, which may correspond to the intense band on the RNase protection assay (Fig. 2). There were five clones, each for positions −49 and −64. Additional minor start sites were identified by both techniques further upstream between positions −287 and −301 (Fig. 2). Promoter activity was studied by transient transfection in the human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line HepG2 using a firefly luciferase reporter system. HepG2 has been used successfully to study promoters of a number of genes expressed in liver, including the factor VII (19Arbini A.A. Pollak E.S. Bayleran J.K. High K.A. Bauer K.A. Blood. 1997; 89: 176-182Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Carew J.A. Pollak E.S. Lopaciuk S. Bauer K.A. Blood. 2000; 96: 4370-4372Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and factor X (21Huang M. Hung H. Stanfield-Oakley S. High K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15440-15446Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Hung H. High K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2323-2331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) genes. More importantly for our study, HepG2 cells constitutively secrete FXI protein (23Ohkubo Y. O'Brien D.P. Kanehiro T. Fukui H. Tuddenham E.G. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1990; 63: 417-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Efficiency of transfection was monitored by co-transfection with a CMV-driven vector containing the Renilla luciferase gene. The full-length promoter in these assays contains DNA from bp −2596 to bp +19. Additional promoter constructs were prepared from this full-length sequence by exonuclease digestion from the 5′ end. The activity of construct −2596 in HepG2 cells was arbitrarily assigned a value of 100% (Fig. 3). 5′ truncation to bp−381 was not associated with an appreciable change in activity. Construct −375 had ∼60% of the activity of the full-length fragment, whereas the activity of construct −362 was similar to that of the pGL3 vector without a promoter insert (Fig. 3). Therefore, all promoter activity is lost in HepG2 cells by the removal of 19 nucleotides between bp −381 and −362. We attempted to examine the activity in normal rat hepatocytes (provided by Dr. W. Russell, Vanderbilt University); however, the activity of the full-length promoter was very low in these cells. The human cervical carcinoma cell line HeLa was used as a non-hepatocyte-derived control for the activity study. As shown in Fig. 3, the full-length FXI promoter and truncation constructs have little activity in this cell line when compared with HepG2 cells (∼10% of the activity in HepG2). An increase in promoter activity was noted starting with construct −92 with the activity being the greatest for the pGL3 vector without promoter. This finding is probably because of cryptic promoter elements within the pGL3 vector that bind transcription factors from HeLa cells. The results clearly demonstrate a difference in promoter activity in the liver cell line compared with the squamous epithelial line and suggest that the binding of hepatocyte-specific or hepatocyte-enriched transcription factor(s) to the area between bp −381 and −362 is necessary for proper gene expression. The sequence between bp −385 and −350 is shown at the top of Fig. 4 A. This region contains the sequence ACTTTG, which has been identified in several gene promoters as a component of binding sites for the liver-enriched transcription factor HNF-4α (22Hung H. High K. J.

In this study, the adopted orphan receptors constitutive androstane receptor (CAR) and pregnane X receptor (PXR) were found to perform direct protein-protein interactions with Pit-1, a representative POU domain factor. The ligand-dependent interaction profile of Pit-1 with CAR, PXR, and the vitamin D receptor in solution was shown to be that of a corepressor. In the absence of receptor agonist Pit-1 inhibited the complex formation of NRs with the retinoid X receptor on DNA. Also in living cells, Pit-1 and Oct-1, another POU domain factor, behaved like corepressors of NR signaling, and Pit-1-mediated repression was found to involve histone deacetylases. Conversely vitamin D receptor, CAR, and PXR were shown to act as repressors of Pit-1 signaling in different cell lines (MCF-7, HaCaT, and GH4C1). This repression was found to be independent of histone deacetylases and seems to be based on a competition of NRs with coactivator and corepressor proteins for overlaying interaction interfaces on the surface of Pit-1. Taken together this study suggests that cross-repression should occur in all tissues in which POU domain factors and non-liganded NRs meet each other.

CAR and PXR have a rather broad, overlapping set of ligands that range from natural steroids to xenobiotics and also recognize similar DNA binding sites, referred to as response elements (REs), primarily in promoter regions of the cytochrome P450 gene family (2Honkakoski P. Negishi M. Biochem. J. 2000; 347: 321-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). CAR and PXR are closely related to each other as well as to another NR superfamily member, VDR (NR1I1), since they share ∼40% amino acid identity of their ligand binding domain. VDR is bound with high affinity (Kd in the order of 0.1 nm) by its natural ligand 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3(1α,25(OH)2D3) (3Herdick M. Bury Y. Quack M. Uskokovic M. Polly P. Carlberg C. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 1206-1217PubMed Google Scholar), whereas CAR and PXR are bound by an overlapping set of natural and synthetic ligands with rather low affinity (Kd in the order of 1 μm) (4Moore L.B. Parks D.J. Jones S.A. Bledsoe R.K. Consler T.G. Stimmel J.B. Goodwin B. Liddle C. Blanchard S.G. Willson T.M. Collins J.L. Kliewer S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15122-15127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar). Interestingly CAR differs from most other NRs by displaying in the absence of ligand already a relatively high constitutive activity, which can be reduced by the binding of the inverse agonist 5α-androstan-3α-ol (androstanol) (5Tzameli I. Moore D.D. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2001; 12: 7-10Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). CAR and PXR each form a heterodimer with RXR on DR4-type REs (6Sueyoshi T.

Similarly classical VDR binding sites have only three spacing nucleotides between the receptor binding motifs, but VDR-RXR heterodimers show even higher affinity for DR4-type REs (7Quack M.

Germain P. Gronemeyer H. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2000; 21: 381-388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). The ligand binding domain has diverse functions; it is not only involved in ligand binding but also in interaction with other NRs for the formation of homo- and heterodimeric complexes, and it is in contact with nuclear mediator proteins, such as coactivators and corepressors, for modulation of transcriptional activities. Contact points for coactivators, such as SRC-1, TIF-2, and RAC3 (10Leo C. Chen J.D. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 245: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar), have been mapped in the activation function-2 (AF-2) domain of helix 12 and in helix 3 (11Feng W. Ribeiro R.C.J. Wagner R.L. Nguyen H. Apriletti J.A. Fletterick R.J. Baxter J.D. Kushner P.J. West B.L. Science. 1998; 280: 1747-1749Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar), and also within the less well understood interaction surface for corepressors, such as NCoR, SMRT (silencing mediator for retinoid and thyroid hormone receptors), and Alien, the AF-2 domain was found to be of importance (12Burke L.J. Baniahmad A. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 1876-1888Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). The classical corepressors act as a specific bridge between transcription factors and histone deacetylases (HDACs), which are enzymes that locally close chromatin (13Ng H.H. Bird A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 121-126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). POU domain factors, such as Pit-1, Oct-1, andUnc-86, form another large family of transcription factors, which are of special importance during development (14Ryan A.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1207-1225Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). Since some nuclear receptors are also known to have critical roles in development (15Altucci L. Gronemeyer H. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2001; 12: 460-468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), a possible functional interference between members of the POU domain factor family and NR superfamily has been investigated quite extensively. For example, it had been found that pit-1 gene expression is down-regulated by thyroid hormone (16Sanchez-Pacheco A. Palomino T. Aranda A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6322-6330Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), that prolactin gene expression is synergistically activated by Pit-1 and either the VDR or the estrogen receptor via neighboring binding sites in the prolactin promoter (17Castillo A.I. Jimenez-Lara A.M. Tolon R.M. Aranda A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 1141-1154Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 18Schaufele F. Chang C.Y. Liu W. Baxter J.D. Nordeen S.K. Wan Y. Day R.N. McDonnell D.P. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 2024-2039Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), and that Pit-1 interacts physically with the thyroid hormone receptor (T3R) and retinoid acid receptor (RAR) (19Palomino T. Sanchez-Pacheco A. Pena P. Aranda A. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 1201-1209Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). This study was performed with the aim of attaining a better understanding of the multitude of protein-protein interactions of NRs. Therefore, direct protein-protein interactions between VDR, CAR, and PXR, as representative NRs, and Pit-1, as a representative POU domain factor, were investigated. It was shown that Pit-1 can act as a repressor of NR signaling and that conversely NRs can function as repressors of Pit-1 signaling. This crosswise repressor action, referred to as cross-repression, was demonstrated only for VDR, CAR, PXR, Pit-1, and Oct-1, but it possibly applies to all those members of these two transcription factor families that are coexpressed in the same tissue and that are able to participate in a direct protein-protein interaction. Androstanol was from Steraloids (Newport, RI); 1,4-bis[2-(3,5-dichloropyridyloxy)]benzene (TCPOBOP) was synthesized and purified according to Honkakoski et al. (20Honkakoski P. Moore R. Gynther J.

Truncated versions of VDR (VDRΔ413–27), PXR (PXRΔ421–35), and CAR (CARΔ349–58), which were lacking their AF-2 domain, were generated by introducing via point-directed mutagenesis a stop codon at positions 413, 349, and 421, respectively, and confirmed by sequencing. The T7 promoter-driven constructs are suitable for T7 RNA polymerase-driven in vitro transcription/translation of the respective cDNAs, and the SV40-, cytomegalovirus-, and Rous sarcoma virus-driven constructs were used for overexpression of the respective proteins in mammalian cells. The cDNAs for the NR interaction domains of mouse NCoR (spanning amino acids 1679–2453) and human SRC-1 (spanning amino acids 596–790) and for full-length rat Pit-1 were subcloned into the GST fusion protein vector pGEX (Amersham Biosciences).

In vitro translated VDR, PXR, CAR, and RXR proteins were generated by coupled in vitro transcription/translation using rabbit reticulocyte lysate as recommended by the supplier (Promega, Mannheim, Germany). By test translation in the presence of [35S]methionine and taking the individual numbers of methionine residues per receptor into account, the specific concentration of the receptor proteins was adjusted to ∼4 ng/μl. Bacterial overexpression of GST-Pit-1FL, GST-NCoR-(1679–2453), and GST-SRC-1-(596–790) was facilitated in the Escherichia coli BL21(DE3)pLysS strain (Stratagene).

The fusion proteins were purified and immobilized by glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's protocol. For gel shift experiments the fusion proteins were eluted by glutathione. GST pull-down assays were performed with 50 μl of a 50% Sepharose bead slurry of GST-Pit-1FL, GST-NCoR-(1679–2453), or GST-SRC-1-(596–790) (preblocked with 1 μg/μl bovine serum albumin) and 20 ng of in vitro translated, 35S-labeled NRs in the presence or absence of their respective ligands. Proteins were incubated in immunoprecipitation buffer (20 mm Hepes (pH 7.9), 200 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 4 mmMgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and 10% glycerol) for 20 min at 30 °C. For competition experiments, the peptides CoRNR2NCoR (SNLGLEDII RKAL with core binding motifs in bold) or CoANR2TIF-2(KHKILHRLL QDSS) were added before the addition of ligand. In vitro translated proteins that were not bound to GST fusion proteins were washed away with immunoprecipitation buffer. GST fusion protein-bound 35S-labeled NRs were resolved by electrophoresis through 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and quantified on a Fuji FLA3000 reader (Tokyo, Japan) using Image Gauge software (Fuji). Gel shift assays were performed with equal amounts (∼10 ng) of in vitro translated VDR, CAR, PXR, and RXR and bacterially expressed GST-Pit-1FL (∼3 μg) and GST (as a control). Proteins were incubated on ice for 15 min in a total volume of 20 μl of binding buffer (10 mm Hepes (pH 7.9), 150 mmKCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 μg/μl poly(dI-dC), and 5% glycerol). For competition experiments, increasing concentrations of the peptides CoRNR2NCoR, CoANR2TIF-2, or AF-2RXR(TFLMEML EAPHQMT) were added to the reaction mixture. Approximately 1 ng of 32P-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotides (50,000 cpm) corresponding to one copy of the Pit-1 RE from the rat GH promoter (core sequence 5′-CATG AATA AATG TA-3′) (35Schaufele F. West B.L. Baxter J.D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 656-665PubMed Google Scholar) or the DR4-type RE from the rat Pit-1 promoter (core sequence 5′-GAAGTTCA TGAGAGTTCA-3′) (37Rhodes S.J. Chen R. DiMattia G.E. Scully K.M. Kalla K.A. Lin S.-C. Yu V.C. Rosenfeld M.G. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 913-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar), respectively, were then added, and the incubation was continued for 20 min at room temperature. Protein-DNA complexes were resolved by electrophoresis through 8% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gels in 0.5× TBE (45 mm Tris, 45 mm boric acid, and 1 mmEDTA (pH 8.3)) and quantified on a Fuji FLA3000 reader using Image Gauge software. MCF-7 human breast cancer cells, HaCaT human immortalized keratinocytes, and GH4C1 rat pituitary tumor cells were seeded into six-well plates (105 cells/ml) and grown overnight in phenol red-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% (or 10% in the case of GH4C1 cells) charcoal-treated fetal bovine serum. Liposomes were formed by incubating 1 μg of the reporter plasmid and the indicated combinations of expression vectors for Pit-1, VDR, CAR, PXR, RXR, NCoR, or SRC-1 (each 1 μg if not otherwise indicated) with 10 μg of N-[1-(2,3-dioleoyloxy)propyl]-N, N, N-trimethylammonium methylsulfate (DOTAP, Roth, Karlsruhe, Germany) for 15 min at room temperature in a total volume of 100 μl. After dilution with 900 μl of phenol red-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, the liposomes were added to the cells. Phenol red-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 15% charcoal-treated fetal bovine serum (500 μl, 30% in the case of GH4C1 cells) was added 4 h after transfection. At this time, NR ligands or histone HDAC inhibitors were also added. The cells were lysed 16 h after onset of stimulation using the reporter gene lysis buffer (Roche Diagnostics), and the constant light signal luciferase reporter gene assay was performed as recommended by the supplier (Canberra-Packard, Dreieich, Germany). The luciferase activities were normalized with respect to protein concentration, and induction factors were calculated as the ratio of luciferase activity of ligand-stimulated cells to that of solvent controls. The physical interaction between Pit-1 and a selection of 10 different NRs was assessed by GST pull-down assays using bacterially produced GST-Pit-1FL fusion protein immobilized on Sepharose beads and in vitro translated,35S-labeled NR protein (Fig. 1). This qualitative screening suggested a direct protein-protein interaction between Pit-1 and human VDR, chicken T3Rα, human or mouse PXR, human or mouse CAR,Xenopus PPARγ, or human PPARα but not between Pit-1 and human RXRα or human RARγ. GST protein alone was not able to interact with these receptors (data not shown). The interaction of Pit-1 with the PXR and CAR has not been reported yet and was investigated in more detail using human PXR and mouse CAR in reference to human VDR. First, the ligand-dependent interaction of NRs with Pit-1 was compared with their interaction with the corepressor NCoR and the coactivator SRC-1. GST pull-down assays were performed with bacterially expressed GST-Pit-1FL, GST-NCoR-(1679–2453), and GST-SRC-1-(596–790) and full-length in vitro translated, 35S-labeled human VDR, human PXR, and mouse CAR in the absence and presence of their respective ligands (Fig. 2). The interaction between Pit-1 and VDR was found to decrease after addition of the natural VDR agonist 1α,25(OH)2D3, which resembles the interaction profile of VDR with NCoR but is in contrast to that of VDR and SRC-1 (Fig. 2A). A similar tendency was observed for human PXR and its synthetic agonist rifampicin: the interaction of PXR with Pit-1 was clearly reduced in the presence of ligand, and also the interaction of PXR with NCoR was slightly but significantly reduced, whereas for the interaction of PXR with SRC-1 no significant ligand-dependent effect was found (Fig. 2B). The profile of the ligand-dependent interaction of mouse CAR with Pit-1 was found to be very similar to that with NCoR and inverse to that of SRC-1 (Fig. 2C). The synthetic agonist TCPOBOP decreased the interaction between CAR and Pit-1 or NCoR but increased the contact of CAR with SRC-1. The inverse agonist androstanol showed the opposite tendency: it slightly increased the interaction between CAR and Pit-1 or NCoR and decreased the contact of CAR with SRC-1. The combined treatment with TCPOBOP and androstanol resulted in effects slightly weaker than that of TCPOBOP alone but still significantly different from the solvent control. In many cases the AF-2 domain of NRs has been shown to mediate their ligand-dependent protein-protein interaction. Therefore, the agonist-triggered interaction of human VDR and mouse CAR with Pit-1 was compared with that of truncated versions of the receptors, which lack their C-terminal AF-2 domains. GST pull-down assays were performed with bacterially expressed GST-Pit-1FL and in vitro translated, 35S-labeled human VDRWT, VDRΔ413–27, CARWT, and CARΔ349–58 (Fig. 3). As already shown in Fig. 2, in the presence of the agonists 1α,25(OH)2D3 and TCPOBOP the interaction of full-length VDR and CAR, respectively, with Pit-1 was clearly reduced. In contrast, in the absence of agonist the interaction of VDRΔ413–27 and CARΔ349–58 with Pit-1 was found to be already at approximately the same low level as the respective full-length receptor in the presence of agonist but did not respond further to ligand addition. The AF-2 domain has been shown to be critical for the interaction of NRs both with coactivator proteins as well as with corepressor proteins. Therefore the question of whether Pit-1 competes with corepressors and coactivators for the binding to the AF-2 domain of VDR and CAR was addressed. GST pull-down assays were performed with bacterially expressed GST-Pit-1FL and in vitro translated, 35S-labeled human VDR and mouse CAR in the presence of increasing concentrations of the peptides CoRNR2NCoR and CoANR2TIF-2 (Fig. 4). The peptides represent specific NR interaction domains of the corepressor NCoR and the coactivator TIF-2, respectively (38Darimont B.D. Wagner R.L. Apriletti J.W. Stallcup M.R. Kushner P.J. Baxter J.D. Fletterick R.J. Yamamoto K.R. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3343-3356Crossref PubMed Scopus (832) Google Scholar, 39Hu X. Lazar M.A. Nature. 1999; 402: 93-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar). In the absence of ligand, increasing concentrations of CoRNR2NCoR but not of CoANR2TIF-2 were shown to be able to reduce the interaction between Pit-1 and VDR and CAR, i.e. corepressors compete with Pit-1 for binding to both receptors. In contrast, in the presence of agonist, CoANR2TIF-2 but not CoRNR2NCoR was found to compete effectively with Pit-1 for binding to VDR and CAR. As a control, competition experiments were performed with a peptide of the same length and concentration representing the AF-2 domain of human RXRα (AF-2RXR). This peptide had no effect on the interaction of Pit-1 with VDR and CAR in either the absence or presence of receptor agonists (data not shown). The previous experiments demonstrated the interaction of Pit-1 with NRs in solution. As the next step this interaction was assessed bound to DNA by performing gel shift experiments with bacterially expressed GST-Pit-1FL on the Pit-1 RE of the rat GH gene in the presence of in vitro translated human VDR, mouse CAR, human PXR, or human RXRα (Fig. 5). The RE showed to be specific for Pit-1 since only the addition of Pit-1 but not of any of the four NRs resulted in a detectable protein-DNA complex. Interestingly the preincubation of Pit-1 with VDR, CAR, and PXR resulted in a slower migrating protein-DNA complex and indicated that VDR, CAR, and PXR can bind to DNA-bound Pit-1. In contrast, the addition of RXR was without any effect and confirmed the observation from Fig. 1 that RXR cannot interact with Pit-1. Competition experiments with the corepressor peptide CoRNR2NCoR and the coactivator peptide CoANR2TIF-2 resulted at higher concentrations in a loss of the “supershifted” protein-DNA complex, whereas the same amount of the unspecific peptide AF-2RXRshowed no effect. This suggests that corepressor proteins as well as coactivator proteins are able to compete with DNA-bound Pit-1 for the binding to NRs. The inverse question to the point addressed in the previous experiment (Fig. 5) was whether Pit-1 also could interact with DNA-bound NRs. Therefore, gel shift experiments were performed with in vitro translated heterodimers between human VDR and human RXRα and between mouse CAR and human RXRα and the DR4-type RE of the rat Pit-1 gene (Fig. 6). As reported previously (7Quack M. Carlberg C. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 296: 743-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), VDR-RXR heterodimers demonstrated a clearly agonist-triggered complex formation on this RE, whereas the DNA binding of CAR-RXR heterodimers was shown to be ligand-independent. Interestingly the preincubation of VDR-RXR and CAR-RXR heterodimers with increasing concentrations of bacterially expressed GST-Pit-1FL and GST alone (as a control) resulted in a Pit-1-specific inhibition of DNA complex formation of the heterodimers only in the absence but not in the presence of receptor agonists. In the previous in vitro experiments (Figs. 2 and 6) the interaction between NRs and Pit-1 looked more like a crosswise repression (here referred to as cross-repression) than a synergistic activation. To study the interaction of Pit-1 with VDR, CAR, and PXR in living cells, luciferase reporter gene assays were performed in MCF-7 and HaCaT cells, which both represent model cell lines for NR signaling. The cells were transiently transfected with a reporter gene construct driven by three copies of the rat GH Pit-1 RE and expression vectors for rat Pit-1, mouse NCoR, human VDR, mouse CAR, and human PXR (the latter three NRs each in combination with human RXRα, see Fig. 7). The overexpression of Pit-1 resulted for both cell lines in an ∼4-fold increase of basal reporter gene activity (column 4). Both in MCF-7 and in HaCaT cells Pit-1 signaling was clearly repressed by the overexpression of NCoR (column 7) and even reduced below basal activity by the overexpression of VDR, CAR, and PXR (columns 10, 13, and 16). The repression of Pit-1 signaling was specific to VDR, CAR, and PXR since the overexpression of their heterodimeric partner RXR alone showed no effect (columns 19 and 21). The NCoR-mediated repression of Pit-1 signaling could be released by the HDAC inhibitors TSA, sodium butyrate, and valproic acid (columns 8 and 9). In contrast, the HDAC inhibitors showed only minor effects on the NR-mediated repression of Pit-1 signaling (columns 11, 12, 14, 15, 17, and 18). GH4C1 rat pituitary tumor cells endogenously express sufficient amounts of Pit-1 protein so that additional overexpression of the transcription factor was not able to booster Pit-1 signaling (data not shown). Reporter gene assays were performed in GH4C1 cells that were transiently transfected with a reporter gene construct driven by three copies of the rat GH Pit-1 RE and expression vectors for human SRC-1, mouse NCoR, human VDR and its AF-2 deletion mutant VDRΔ413–27, mouse CAR and its AF-2 deletion mutant CARΔ349–58, and human PXR and its AF-2 deletion mutant PXRΔ421–35 (Fig. 8). The overexpression of SRC-1 increased the basal Pit-1 activity (column 1) by ∼40% (column 3), whereas the overexpression of NCoR reduced it by approximately the same amount (column 5). All three tested NRs repressed Pit-1 signaling to a level of 10–30% basal activity (columns 7, 11, and 15). Again this repressio"

Our sequence homology search of the C. elegans genome (17C. elegans Sequencing ConsortiumScience. 1998; 282: 2012-2018Crossref PubMed Scopus (3587) Google Scholar) indicated the presence of three additional less well conserved P4H α subunit-like genes. We report here on the cloning and characterization of one of these, termed phy-3. Nematodes carrying homozygous deletion of the phy-3 gene were morphologically normal at both the adult and larval stages, but their early embryos had egg shells with a markedly reduced 4-hydroxyproline content. Our data thus indicate that PHY-3 is involved in the hydroxylation of proline residues in the early embryo, most probably in the collagens of the egg shell (18Wood W.B. Wood W.B.

A GeneBankTM data base search indicated the presence of an open reading frame T20B3.7 showing sequence similarity to the C-terminal region of the human and C. elegansP4H α subunits (Fig. 1). The T20B3.7 gene has four exons, but the encoded polypeptide has no signal peptide (20Nielsen H. Engelbrecht J. Brunak S. von Heijne G.

The first fragment corresponding to the T20B3.7 open reading frame (Fig. 2 C, PCR1) was amplified with the primers 5′-ATTCCAGATTCCATCTGCATCACCTACG-3′ and 5′-AACATTCAAATTGTTCTACAAATATCAATTGGG-3′, while the second corresponding to a sequence beginning from the start codon in the upstream 208-bp exon and extending to a BamHI site in the fourth exon of T20B3.7 (Fig. 2 C, PCR2) was amplified with 5′-GAAAACCATCATGATTTCTGTCACTTTCCG-3′ and 5′-ATTGTAGGCACGGATCCAAATAGTCGCGATC-3′. The fragments were cloned into the SmaI site of pUC18, fragment 1 was digested with BamHI, and fragment 2 with BamHI and EcoRI, and coligated into pBluescript (Stratagene) to generate pBS-phy-3. The DNA sequences were determined using an automated sequencer (ABI Prism 377, Applied Biosystems). Reverse transcriptase PCR was performed at different developmental stages of C. elegans (21Johnstone I.L. Barry J.D. EMBO J. 1996; 11: 3857-3863Crossref Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The abundance of the phy-3 transcript was measured in relation to the constitutively expressed ama-1 gene (21Johnstone I.L. Barry J.D. EMBO J. 1996; 11: 3857-3863Crossref Scopus (50) Google Scholar), PCR products corresponding to phy-3 and ama-1 being amplified simultaneously. The phy-3 cDNA was amplified with primers 5′-GGCACCGTATTCCCAAGTATTGGTTCCAC-3′ and 5′-GGGCACTGGCGACTGTGTCTGCATTTC C-3′, while ama-1 was amplified with the primers described previously (21Johnstone I.L. Barry J.D. EMBO J. 1996; 11: 3857-3863Crossref Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The PCR products were electrophoresed on 2% agarose gels, Southern blotted, and hybridized under stringent conditions with 32P-labeled PCR products corresponding to the phy-3 and ama-1 genes. The hybridized bands were excised and counted by scintillation. DNA fragment extending from −1480 to +6 relative to the ATG codon of phy-3 was amplified from the genomic clone T20B3 (nucleotides 20,101–21,586, GeneBankTMaccession number Z81593) with the primers 5′-GCGCTCTAGAACTGAACAAGTGAACATTCATCAT-3′ and 5′-GCGCTCTAGAGAAATCATGATGGTTTTCTAAAAATAAATATG-3′. The fragment was digested with XbaI and ligated into the promoterless nucleus-localized vector pPD96.04 (obtained from A. Fire, J. Ahnn, G. Seydoux, and S.-Q. Xu), allowing in-frame fusion of the phy-3 promoter sequence and GFP/lacZ reporter genes. Transgenic strains were generated by microinjecting the reporter plasmid (20 μg/ml) together with the marker plasmid pRF-4 rol-6 (su 1006) (22Kramer J.M. French R.P. Park E.-C. Johnson J.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 2081-2089Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar) (100 μg/ml) into the syncytial gonad of wild-type nematodes (23Mello C.C. Kramer J.M. Stinchcomb D. Ambros V. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3959-3970Crossref PubMed Scopus (2425) Google Scholar). Two independent lines were maintained and examined for reporter gene expression as described (24Fire A. Harrison S.W. Dixon D. Gene (Amst.). 1990; 93: 189-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar), except that slides were stained at 22 °C with a solution containing 0.03% X-gal or at 37 °C with a solution containing 0.3% X-gal (sensitive staining). The nematodes were viewed and photographed under Nomarski optics using a Zeiss Axoscop 2 microscope. Wild-type and phy3−/− nematodes were washed from the plates with ice-cold PBS. The washing step was repeated 5–10 times, and the animals were pipetted onto poly-l-lysine-coated slides, permeabilized by freeze-cracking, and fixed as described (25Rogalski T.M. Williams B.D. Mullen G.P. Moerman D.G. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1471-1484Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). The slides were incubated with a polyclonal antibody 2681 generated in rabbits to a synthetic PHY-3 peptide CPSLSNRFRPEMQTQSPVPN (Sigma Genosys), followed by Alexafluor 546-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody (Molecular Probes), washed with PBS, and examined under an epifluorescence microscope. Deletion mutants of phy-3 were generated by Dr. Gary Moulder at Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation as part of the C. elegans knock-out consortium, using treatment with trimethylpsoralen and UV light. The progeny of the mutagenized animals was cultured and genomic DNA isolated from several populations and screened by nested PCR to identify a population carrying deletions in phy-3. The primer pairs used corresponded to bp 24,818–24,837 and 27,719–27,700 and 24,870–24,889 and 27,590–27,571 in T20B3 for the first and second rounds of PCR, respectively. Populations carrying a deletion were subdivided until homozygotes were obtained, and these were outcrossed to wild-type N2 nematodes six times to purify the genetic background. Outcrossed phy3−/− animals carrying the homozygous deletion (T20B3.7 ok199 TP7) were examined by microscopy. The end points of the deletion were determined by sequencing PCR products spanning the deleted region. Synchronous cultures of wild-type and phy-3−/− L1 larvae were prepared by starving, then inoculated onto 90-mm NGM agar plates containing a lawn of Escherichia coli OP50 (19Sulston J. Hodgkin J. Wood W.B. The Nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Plainview, NY1988: 587-606Google Scholar) and grown up on several plates to adults. They were washed from the plates with ice-cold M9 buffer and allowed to settle on ice for 4 min. The washing step was repeated 5–10 times, and an aliquot of the pellet was analyzed microscopically to ensure that no developing embryos were present. The adult nematodes were resuspended into M9 buffer and bleached with an equal volume of bleach solution (2 volumes of 4 m NaOH and 3 volumes of 0.3% NaOCl), and incubated at 37 °C for 10 min with agitation. The resulting worm debris was passed through a narrow gauge needle 40–50 times, washed with a large volume of distilled water, and centrifuged at 3500 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C, this step being repeated three to six times. An aliquot of the obtained egg pellet was analyzed by light microscopy to confirm that the embryos were at the early developmental stage. This pellet was resuspended in 400 μl of ST buffer (0.125 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 1% SDS), heated to 100 °C for 2 min, and incubated at 22 °C overnight. The sample was then centrifuged and the resulting supernatant hydrolyzed. The pellet was resuspended in 400 μl of ST buffer containing 5% β-mercaptoethanol, the above procedure was repeated, and the supernatant was hydrolyzed. SDS was removed from the protein solution by potassium salts (26Suzuki H. Terada T. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 172: 259-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Large populations of mixed-stage wild-type and phy-3−/− nematodes were washed in M9 buffer, treated with the bleach solution (above) for 5 min at 37 °C, and washed several times with distilled water. The nematodes were either sonicated in distilled water on ice, after which the sonicate was hydrolyzed or passed several times through a narrow gauge needle, centrifuged, and the pellet resuspended in ST buffer containing 5% β-mercaptoethanol, boiled for 2 min, incubated at room temperature for 10 h, and hydrolyzed. All samples were hydrolyzed in 6 m HCl for 24 h at 110 °C. Amino acid analyses were performed in an Applied Biosystems 421 amino acid analyzer. The phy-3 cDNA was digested from pBS-phy-3 with NotI and EcoRI and ligated into baculovirus vector pVL1392 (PharMingen). The recombinant vector was cotransfected into Spodoptera frugiperda insect cells (Sf9, Invitrogen) with BaculoGoldTM DNA (PharMingen) by calcium-phosphate transfection according to the manufacturer's instructions. The resultant viral pool was collected, amplified, and plaque-purified (27Myllyharju J. Kivirikko K.I. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1173-1180Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). The other recombinant baculoviruses used were those coding for C. elegans PHY-1 (12Veijola J. Koivunen P. Annunen P. Pihlajaniemi T. Kivirikko K.I. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1173-1180Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) and infected with viruses coding for PHY-3, PHY-1, or the human α(I) alone or together with viruses coding for C. elegans PDI-1, PDI-2, or human PDI. The recombinant proteins were analyzed by 12% SDS-PAGE (27Myllyharju J. Kivirikko K.I. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1173-1180Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) and assayed for P4H activity by a method based on the decarboxylation of 2-oxo-[1-14C]glutarate (29Kivirikko K.I. Myllylä R. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 82: 245-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). N-Glycosidase F treatment was performed according to the instructions of the manufacturer (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and Western analysis with the antibody 2681. A sequence homology search indicated that the C. elegans genome contains an open reading frame T20B3.7 consisting of four exons that encodes a 239-amino acid polypeptide showing sequence similarity to the conserved C-terminal region of the vertebrate P4H α(I) and α(II) subunits (7Annunen P.

However, this polypeptide did not contain a signal peptide, and analysis of the genome suggested the presence of an additional 208-bp exon 4151 bp upstream from T20B3.7, coding for 69 amino acids, including a signal peptide (Fig. 2 A). A cDNA containing the exon sequences from the start codon in this upstream exon to an internal BamHI site in the last exon of T20B3.7 was obtained by PCR from a mixed-stage cDNA library (Fig. 2 C, PCR2), and sequencing of this product showed that in addition to exon 1, the predicted T20B3.7 gene lacked 29 bp from the 5′ end of exon 2 (Fig. 2 B). A full-length phy-3 cDNA was subsequently also obtained by PCR from mixed stage cDNA. The cDNA encodes a 318-amino acid polypeptide (Fig. 1), the most likely cleavage site of the signal peptide being located between Ser23 and Gln24 (20Nielsen H. Engelbrecht J. Brunak S. von Heijne G. Protein Eng. 1997; 10: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (4923) Google Scholar). The processed PHY-3 is thus 295 amino acids, much shorter than the vertebrate P4H α subunits and C. elegans PHY-1 and PHY-2, with a size range from 514 to 542 residues. The sequence of the processed PHY-3 is 17% identical to residues 256–542 in PHY-1 (12Veijola J. Koivunen P. Annunen P. Pihlajaniemi T. Kivirikko K.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26746-26753Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and 18–20% identical to the corresponding residues in PHY-2 (14Winter A.D. Page A.P. Mol. Cell.

A. 1989; 86: 4392-4396Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). The sequence conservation is highest within the C-terminal regions, the PHY-3 amino acids 150–295 being 23–30% identical to the corresponding residues of PHY-1 and PHY-2 and human α(I) and α(II). The two histidines and one aspartate that bind the Fe2+ atom and the lysine that binds the C5 carboxyl group of 2-oxoglutarate (27Myllyharju J. Kivirikko K.I. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1173-1180Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) are all conserved (marked by * in Fig. 1). The sequence of phy-3 is found on cosmid T20B3 (GeneBankTMaccession number Z81593), which maps to chromosome V (17C. elegans Sequencing ConsortiumScience. 1998; 282: 2012-2018Crossref PubMed Scopus (3587) Google Scholar). The nearest genes are T20B3.2 and T20B3.13 on the opposite strand of the phy-3 coding region. As the nearest genes located on the same strand as phy-3 are at a distance of several kilobases, it seems unlikely that phy-3 belongs to a gene cluster or operon. The phy-3 coding sequence is organized into five exons (Fig. 2) and is located at the following sites in T20B3: 21,581–21,788, 25,939–26,249, 26,501–26,651, 26,698–26,786, and 27,139–27,336. The first exon is separated from the second by a relatively long intron (4151 nucleotides), as typical intron lengths in C. elegans are only 44–52 bp (17C. elegans Sequencing ConsortiumScience. 1998; 282: 2012-2018Crossref PubMed Scopus (3587) Google Scholar). Semiquantitative reverse transcriptase PCR was performed with mRNA samples extracted from highly synchronous post-embryonic C. elegans cultures (21Johnstone I.L. Barry J.D. EMBO J. 1996; 11: 3857-3863Crossref Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The relative abundance of the phy-3 mRNA was determined with respect to a constitutively expressed gene ama-1, which codes for the large subunit of RNA polymerase II (21Johnstone I.L. Barry J.D. EMBO J. 1996; 11: 3857-3863Crossref Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Expression of phy-3 transcripts in these samples was detected only in the late larval stages (L3 and L4) and in the adult nematodes (Fig. 3). Additional PCR experiments with a cDNA pool prepared from embryos gave a strong signal, indicating the presence of the phy-3 mRNA also in embryos (details not shown). A putative promoter fragment, 1480 bp upstream of the translation initiation codon, was ligated in-frame to a lacZ reporter gene. The construct,phy-3::lacZ, was microinjected into the germ line with a marker plasmid containing a rol-6(su1006) gene (22Kramer J.M. French R.P. Park E.-C. Johnson J.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 2081-2089Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar, 23Mello C.C. Kramer J.M. Stinchcomb D. Ambros V. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3959-3970Crossref PubMed Scopus (2425) Google Scholar). A large number of nematodes from two independent lines, selected on the basis of their roller phenotype, were stained for β-galactosidase activity. Expression of phy-3::lacZ was consistently detected in the spermatheca of L4 larvae and adult nematodes (Fig. 4, A and B), this specialized region of the gonad being the site of oocyte fertilization (18Wood W.B. Wood W.B. The Nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Plainview, NY1988: 215-241Google Scholar). Some additional staining of gonadal cell nuclei was observed when a sensitive staining method was used (Fig. 4 A), whereas no β-galactosidase expression was observed in the hypodermal cells. Expession of the PHY-3 polypeptide in spermatheca was confirmed by immunofluorescence staining with a polyclonal antibody against PHY-3 (Fig. 4, C and D). Homozygous deletion mutants in the phy-3 locus were backcrossed six times to remove non-related mutations. This mutant, phy-3−/−ok199, contained a 1241-bp deletion that corresponds to position 25,891–27,132 in T20B3 (Fig. 2 D) and removes exons 2, 3, and 4 and part of exon 5. The homozygous nematodes were phenotypically of the wild type, and no defects were found in their gross morphology, fertility, or behavior. As phy-3 was expressed exclusively in embryos and in the spermatheca of L4 larvae and adult nematodes, we carefully examined the early embryos. Those of the phy-3−/− strain were morphologically of the wild-type when viewed with Nomarski optics (data not shown). The 4-hydroxyproline content of the phy-3−/− early embryos was dramatically reduced by about 90% (p < 0.0005) relative to their wild-type counterparts, and a small decrease (p < 0.05) was also seen in the proline content (Table I). In contrast, the 4-hydroxyproline content of the whole phy-3−/− nematodes was not decreased (data not shown).Table I4-Hydroxyproline content of early embryosGenotypen4-Hyp/1000Pro/1000Gly/1000Wild-type526 ± 1366 ± 22100 ± 10phy-3−/−82.6 ± 2.1, p < 0.000542 ± 16, p < 0.05113 ± 13, n.s.The number of residues per 1000 amino acids (means ± S.D.) is given.

In a wild type strain, levels of Grx2 increased 3-fold in the stationary phase (up to 8 μg/mg). Guanosine-3′,5′-tetraphoshate (ppGpp) and ςS, which regulate the transcription of genes in the stationary phase, dramatically affected the expression of Grx2. spoTrelA null mutants, lacking ppGpp, had very low levels of Grx2, while overproduction of full-length RelA or valine-induced starvation of isoleucine, both conditions elevating ppGpp levels, resulted in elevation of Grx2. Null mutants for the ςS-specific protease ClpP, which have higher levels of ςS, exhibited a 3-fold Grx2 increase. ςS in trans also increased the levels of Grx2. Therefore the stationary phase expression of Grx2 is determined by the ςS-bound form of RNA polymerase in connection with ppGpp, while basal levels should be attributed to ς70-RNA polymerase holoenzyme. Osmotic pressure and cAMP also affected the expression of Grx2, presumably via ςS. Furthermore, Grx2 levels were elevated in an oxyR − strain.

In Escherichia coli (E. coli), cytosolic disulfides are kept reduced by the glutaredoxin and thioredoxin systems. In the glutaredoxin system, electrons are transferred from NADPH, to glutathione reductase, glutathione (GSH), and finally to the three glutaredoxins (Grx1, Grx2, and Grx3, encoded by grxA,grxB, and grxC, respectively). In the thioredoxin system the flow of electrons is from NADPH to thioredoxin reductase and finally thioredoxins 1 and 2 (Trx1 and Trx2 encoded by trxA and trxC, respectively). Glutaredoxins catalyze GSH-disulfide oxidoreductions usually via two redox-active cysteine residues separated by two other amino acids (typically CPYC) (1Holmgren A. J. Biol.

The oxidoreductions are either dithiol reactions to reduce protein disulfides or monothiol reductions of mixed disulfides with glutathione. In comparison, thioredoxins may predominantly reduce protein disulfides. Grx1 and Grx3 are ∼10-kDa proteins with homologues in most living organisms and have the characteristic thioredoxin/glutaredoxin fold (3Martin J.L.

E. coli Grx2 has close homologues in Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (87% amino acid identity), Neisseria meningitidis (58%), and Vibrio cholerae (42%), all known pathogens, but it is not a “ubiquitous” protein.

Guanosine-3′,5′-tetraphoshate (ppGpp) and ςS (RpoS) are two major factors controlling the transcription of genes in stationary phase of growth and are also known to control the transcription of genes involved in the antioxidant response (18Cashel M.

E. coli glutathione reductase is positively regulated by ςS in the stationary phase (14Becker-Hapak M. Eisenstark A. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1995; 134: 39-44PubMed Google Scholar). Trx1 transcription is positively regulated by ppGpp, but for the trxA expression ςS is not required (20Lim C. Daws T. Gerami-Nejad M. Fuchs J.A. Biochim. Biophys.

The levels of Grx2 have been previously shown to be growth phase dependent and highly elevated at the stationary phase of growth (17Potamitou, A., Holmgren, A., and Vlamis-Gardikas, A. (2002)J. Biol.

For the shake flask experiments, cells were grown in LB medium overnight at 37 °C in 10-ml cultures in 100-ml Erlenmeyer flasks. Overnight cultures were centrifuged, resuspended, diluted to 1:200, and grown in 200 ml of glucose ammonia-based mineral salt medium in 1L Erlenmeyer flasks (23Teich A. Meyer S. Lin H.Y. Andersson L. Enfors S. Neubauer P. Biotechnol. Prog. 1999; 15: 123-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Transformed cells with plasmids encoding ςS (pRL40.1) or RelA (pALS10, pALS13 and pALS14) were grown in LB with 100 μg/ml ampicillin. Cells were induced with 150 μm IPTG for the expression of RelA and 1 mm IPTG for the expression of ςS. Samples were taken just before induction and 30, 60, and 90 min after induction. RelA expression was induced at a relatively low A600 (∼0.2), while expression of rpoS was induced at late exponential phase, A600 0.7–0.8. Cells were grown to late exponential phase, A600 0.7–0.8 in LB medium. Hydrogen peroxide (5 mm) was then added, and the cells were then further cultivated for 1 h before harvesting. Cells were grown in M9 medium (22Davis R.W. Botstein D. Roth J.R. Advanced Bacterial Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1980Google Scholar) containing BME (basal medium Eagle) vitamin solution (Invitrogen), leucine (50 μg/ml), isoleucine (50 μg/ml), and glucose (2 g/liter). At A600 of about 0.2, valine (1 mm final concentration) was added to the cells. Samples were taken at different time points, the bacteria harvested, kept at −20 °C, and analyzed by ELISA after preparation of cell free extracts. Cells were harvested, resuspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mmEDTA, disrupted at 4 °C by sonic disintegration. Phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (1 mm) was added, and lysates were centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatants of the lysates after centrifugation were used as the material for sandwich ELISAs. Total protein was measured by the method of Bradford (24Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216391) Google Scholar). Pure protein was determined by measuring A280. Antibody concentration was calculated using the relation: antibody (mg/ml) = (A280-A310)/1.4. Purification of antibodies against Grx2 and other redoxins by affinity chromatography and quantification of Grx2 by sandwich enzyme immunoassay were carried out as described previously (17Potamitou, A., Holmgren, A., and Vlamis-Gardikas, A. (2002)J. Biol. Chem. 277, in pressGoogle Scholar). The numbers of live and dead cells were determined with a viability kit (LIVE/DEAD BactLight) from Molecular Probes and analyzed using a fluorescence microscope. Growth of the cultures was followed by measuring the optical cell density at 500 nm (A500) (relation 1 A500 = 0.6 A600), by microscopy with a cell-counting chamber (0.02 μm depth), and by analysis of the number of colony forming units on LB plates. The stability of the gene marker (grxB::kan) was controlled by replica plating on LB and kanamycin plates. ppGpp is the positive regulator of the stringent response and positively affects the general starvation response (18Cashel M.

Genet. 1988; 213: 214-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) occurring in stationary phase. To examine whether Grx2 expression is affected by ppGpp, we measured levels of Grx2 in strains with altered ppGpp content. In a spoTrelA double null mutant, levels of Grx2 at the exponential phase were less than one-third compared with wild type, and no increase was seen at the stationary phase of growth (Fig. 1). Since SpoT and RelA are known to be the only cellular gene products accounting for the synthesis of ppGpp, and spoTrelA null mutants are therefore devoid of ppGpp, these results suggest that grxB transcription is regulated by ppGpp. To examine this possibility further, we measured the levels of Grx2 in strains containing plasmids encoding RelA (Fig. 2). A truncated form of RelA (1–133 amino acids), known not to elevate ppGpp levels, had no effect on the expression of Grx2. In contrast, the full-length form (733 amino acids) resulted in a clear elevation of Grx2. A truncated form of RelA-(1–455), which is known to positively regulate ppGpp (26Schreiber G. Metzger S. Aizenman E. Roza S. Cashel M. Glaser G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3760-3767Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), also increased the levels of Grx2 (Fig. 2). Induction of RelA in a spoTrelA− strain was followed by a modest increase in Grx2 expression, probably due to the low levels of ppGpp, even after induction (data not shown). To imitate isoleucine starvation leading to RelA-dependent accumulation of ppGpp, valine was added to the culture medium of growing cells. The addition of valine led to up-regulation of Grx2 levels (Fig. 3). These data suggest that expression of Grx2 is positively regulated by ppGpp levels.Figure 2Levels of Grx2 after induction of RelA with 150 μm IPTG.

Neidhardt F.C. Escherichia coli and Salmonella. 2nd Ed. 1. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.1996: 1497-1525Google Scholar). ppGpp up-regulates RpoS levels (27Gentry D.R. Hernandez V.J. Nguyen L.H. Jensen D.B. Cashel M. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 7982-7989Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and ςS-dependent promoters require ppGpp for their induction (28Kvint K. Farewell A. Nystrom T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14795-14798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). To examine whether ςS affects the expression of Grx2, we measured Grx2 levels in null mutants for genes affecting total ςS content. Cells lacking ςS-specific ClpP protease (clpP null mutants) have higher ςS levels (29Schweder T. Lee K.H. Lomovskaya O. Matin A. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 470-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). In this genetic background Grx2 levels were significantly increased during all growth phases (Fig. 1), suggesting that ςS may up-regulate the levels of Grx2. The effect was more pronounced in the stationary phase where the Grx2 levels were twice as high as in the wild type. Thus the growth phase-dependent regulation is maintained in the clpP mutant. To exclude that the observed effect was due to Grx2 itself being a substrate for ClpP protease, levels of Grx2 were measured in an rpoSclpP null mutant (Fig. 1). Levels of Grx2 were the same at the exponential phase of growth but decreased at the stationary phase, suggesting that Grx2 is not a substrate for ClpP protease, but its expression is rather dependent on ςS. The high levels of Grx2 at the exponential phase of the rpoSclpP and rpoS null mutants suggest that transcription of Grx2 is also regulated by ς70 (Fig. 1). Even under ς70 transcriptional control, levels of Grx2 were much lower in the relA spoT mutant, presumably because of the very low ppGpp levels in that strain. To further investigate whether transcription of grxB is controlled by ςS, we measured Grx2 levels in strains transformed with a plasmid encoding rpoS under an inducible promoter. In a rpoS − strain, induction of ςS led to very modest increases in Grx2 levels, presumably due to the already high base levels of Grx2 (data not shown). Clear up-regulation of Grx2 upon induction of ςSwas observed in the wild type strain (Fig. 4). Levels of Grx2 remained very low when ςS expression was induced in a spoTrelA− strain (Fig. 4), presumably due to the low levels of ppGpp in the particular strain. ςS-dependent promoters require ppGpp for induction of their regulated genes (28Kvint K. Farewell A. Nystrom T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14795-14798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). In conclusion, ppGpp, ςS, and ς70 can regulate the expression of Grx2. ppGpp is the prerequisite for both ς70 and ςS, which themselves can control the expression of Grx2 in the exponential and stationary phase, respectively. Trx1 levels were lower in the spoTrelA− strain, but showed no increase in the clpP null mutant (Fig. 5 A). These results are consistent with Trx1 being regulated by ppGpp, but not by ςS (20Lim C. Daws T. Gerami-Nejad M. Fuchs J.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1491: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). However, the ppGpp regulation of Trx1 differed from that for Grx2. Levels of Trx1 in the null mutant for spoTrelA were very low only at the stationary phase of growth. In comparison, levels of Grx2 remain very low at all growth stages (Fig. 1). This indicates that ppGpp regulates the expression of Trx1 only at the stationary phase. Levels of Trx1 were increased after induction of RelA in a wild type strain (Fig. 5 B), but after induction of ςS, no effect was seen (data not shown). These data confirm previous findings on the regulation of Trx1 in stationary phase by ppGpp (20Lim C. Daws T. Gerami-Nejad M. Fuchs J.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1491: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Expression of Grx1 showed a slight up-regulation in the spoTrelA− strain. No effect was seen for Grx3 and Trx2 in the strains examined for Grx2 levels (data not shown). It is therefore unlikely that ςS or ppGpp regulates Grx3 and Trx2. cAMP, as part of the cAMP-cAMP catabolite repressor protein complex (cAMP·CRP), down-regulates the expression of ςS (30Lange R. Hengge-Aronis R. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1600-1612Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). Therefore, null mutants for cya(encoding adenylate cyclase) have higher levels of ςSthan the wild type even at the exponential phase of growth. Grx2 levels were also slightly up-regulated at the exponential phase in strains lacking cAMP (cya − strain, Fig. 1). Addition of cAMP in a null mutant for the cya gene resulted in a down-regulation of Grx2 at the exponential phase, while no significant effect was observed when cAMP was added at the stationary phase of growth in the particular strain (Fig. 6). Addition of cAMP to cya − strains in the exponential phase of growth is known to lead to degradation of ςS (31Lange R. Hengge-Aronis R. Mol. Microbiol. 1991; 5: 49-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar). The lack of CRP consensus binding sites at the promoter of grxB together with the previous findings on the regulation of Grx2 expression by ςS suggest that the effects of cAMP·CRP on the levels of Grx2 are most likely due to changes of the ςS levels. A clear up-regulation of Grx2 levels occurred after treatment with NaCl (Fig. 7). As stability and translation rates of ςS are increased in hyperosmotic conditions (32Hengge-Aronis R. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 21: 887-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar), it is likely that the increases in Grx2 levels were a consequence of the elevated ςS. OxyR regulates the transcription of a large number of genes in response to oxidative stress (33Christman M.F. Morgan R.W. Jacobson F.S. Ames B.N. Cell. 1985; 41: 753-762Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (739) Google Scholar). Levels of Grx2 and Grx3 showed no significant change before and after treatment with hydrogen peroxide in both the wild type and the oxyR null mutant (Fig. 8). However, the steady-state levels of Grx2 were significantly elevated in the oxyR null mutant (Fig. 8 B). These data suggest that transcription of grxB is independent of OxyR but dependent on an alternative backup system. Levels of Grx1, known to be regulated by OxyR, showed an increase of up to 6-fold in the wild type, but remained stable in the oxyR − strain. The same was observed for Trx2, but with a 2-fold increase. MC4100 grxB null mutant had the same maximum specific growth rate as MC4100 during growth on mineral salt medium (data not shown). During prolonged cultivation of the grxB null mutant in the stationary phase on glucose ammonia-based mineral salt medium, the measured A500 remained approximately constant and was identical to wild type strain (Fig. 9). However, the colony count on agar plates of the grxB null mutant was significantly lower than that of the wild type strain (Fig. 9), as well as the number of cells determined by microscopic analysis (data not shown). A large number of cells in the culture of the grxB null mutant were much bigger than the cells of the wild type culture. Analysis of the cell viability with a fluorescence test kit showed a higher amount of damaged cells in the grxB null mutant compared with the wild type (data not shown). We explain these observations by a higher death rate of grxB null mutant. The dead cells would serve as a substrate for the surviving population, causing cell division and growth (large cells). In contrast, wild type cells after glucose starvation become smaller and also survive a long time of cultivation under starvation conditions. The hypothesis of an increased lysis of the grxB null mutant is supported by analysis of the total protein content in the cultivation medium, which was increased in the culture of MC4100 grxB − but not in the culture of MC4100 (Fig. 10).Figure 10Extracellular protein concentration in MC4100 and MC4100 grxB during glucose starvation. Extracellular protein concentration was determined in MC4100 (▪) and MC4100 grxB (■) grown for a longer period of time in minimal salt medium.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The glutaredoxin and thioredoxin systems are envisaged as antioxidants in normal cell metabolism, in view of their ability to reduce cytosolic disulfides. Stationary phase cells exhibit increased amount of intracellular disulfides and carbonylated proteins compared with exponential phase cells (34Dukan S. Nyström T. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3431-3441Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). One would therefore expect that the thioredoxin and glutaredoxin system would adapt to the conditions of the stationary phase by providing more reducing equivalents. Levels of GSH (35Loewen P.C. Can. J. Biochem. 1979; 57: 107-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) and glutathione reductase (14Becker-Hapak M. Eisenstark A. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1995; 134: 39-44PubMed Google Scholar) are elevated at the stationary phase as are other antioxidant systems including HPII (36Loewen P.C. von Ossowski I. Switala J. Mulvey M.R. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 2150-2153Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). From the two thioredoxins and the three glutaredoxins of the thioredoxin and glutaredoxin systems, it is only Grx2 and Trx1 that are elevated in the stationary phase (17Potamitou, A., Holmgren, A., and Vlamis-Gardikas, A. (2002)J. Biol. Chem. 277, in pressGoogle Scholar). Grx1 is down-regulated, whereas Grx3 and Trx2 maintain the same levels irrespective of the cell growth phase (17Potamitou, A., Holmgren, A., and Vlamis-Gardikas, A. (2002)J. Biol. Chem. 277, in pressGoogle Scholar). These data point to Trx1 and Grx2 as the most potential antioxidant components of the five presently known dithiol thioredoxins and glutaredoxins at the stationary phase of growth. We wanted to investigate the regulation of Grx2 during the transient from exponential growth to starvation. There are three major responses of E. coli entering the stationary phase: the stringent response with ppGpp as the cellular alarmone, the general starvation response with ςS as the transcriptional regulator, and the cAMP/CRP-connected specific response to glucose starvation (37Loewen P.C., Hu, B. Strutinsky J. Sparling R. Can. J. Microbiol. 1998; 44: 707-717Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our results suggest that the levels of Grx2 are regulated in the stationary phase by ppGpp in combination with ςS. Grx2 expression also seems to be regulated by ς70; Levels of Grx2 in an rpoS − strain were almost higher than in the wild type rather than lower as one would expect if RpoS was the exclusive ς factor for Grx2. Therefore, there are two options for the regulation of Grx2 by ppGpp. ppGpp can be either a direct effector by binding to the ς70-RNA polymerase holoenzyme (exponential phase), or it may influence the grxB transcription indirectly by induction of ςS (stationary phase). Our data suggest that the exclusive induction of ςS is not sufficient for grxB expression. ppGpp is additionally required as a positive regulator of ςS-dependent expression of Grx2. A similar case has been described for the regulation of the uspB gene expression (38Farewell A. Kvint K. Nyström T. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 29: 1039-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Grx2 expression was inhibited by cAMP at the exponential phase. As the promoter of Grx2 lacks a binding site for the cAMP-CRP complex, it is very unlikely that the protein is regulated by cAMP directly. cAMP is known to function as a negative regulator for the expression of ςS, so the effect on Grx2 is more likely to be indirect through down-regulation of ςS. Up-regulation of ςS could potentially explain the higher levels of Grx2 after hyperosmotic treatment (32Hengge-Aronis R. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 21: 887-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar) and the increased transcription of the gene under acidic conditions (39Arnold C.N. McElhanon J. Lee A. Leonhart R. Siegele D.A. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 2178-2186Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). However, hyperosmotic treatment of ςS-regulated genes could also be independent of ςS (40Bianchi A.A. Baneyx F. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 34: 1029-1038Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 41Hengge-Aronis R. Lange R. Henneberg N. Fischer D. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 259-265Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The expression profile of Grx2 seems thus similar to that of OsmY, another stationary phase protein osmotically regulated, requiring EςS for its expression, with basal levels transcribed by Eς70. OsmY, however, contains cAMP-CMP binding sites at its promoter, which inhibit the initiation of its transcription by the complex (42Yim H.H. Brems R.L. Villarejo M. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 100-107Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 43Colland F. Barth M. Hengge-Aronis R. Kolb A. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3028-3037Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Grx2 is involved in the response to oxidative stress, as Grx2 levels were significantly up-regulated in catalase-deficient strains, and null mutants for grxB have high levels of carbonylated proteins in their cytosols (8Vlamis-Gardikas A. Potamitou A. Zarivach R. Hochman A. Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10861-10868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In this work, levels of Grx2 were highly elevated in oxyR null mutants, although levels of Grx2 and Grx3 are known to be down-regulated after exposure to hydrogen peroxide (17Potamitou, A., Holmgren, A., and Vlamis-Gardikas, A. (2002)J. Biol. Chem. 277, in pressGoogle Scholar). These findings suggest that Grx2 is not regulated by the antioxidant defense orchestrated by OxyR but from an alternative system. Another potential antioxidant not regulated by OxyR is the thioredoxin-like protein NrdH, which is also up-regulated in an oxyR − strain (44Monje-Casas F. Jurado J. Prieto-Alamo M.J. Holmgren A. Pueyo C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18031-18037Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). A global analysis of E. coli transcripts up-regulated by hydrogen peroxide did not include Grx2 (Grx3 or Trx1), but Grx1 and Trx2 (45Zheng M. Wang X. Templeton L.J. Smulski D.R. LaRossa R.A. Storz G. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 4562-4570Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar). Therefore, the regulation of Grx2 suggests that the protein is mainly involved in the response to stationary phase conditions. The elevation of Grx2 levels to up to 1% of total cell protein (17Potamitou, A., Holmgren, A., and Vlamis-Gardikas, A. (2002)J. Biol. Chem. 277, in pressGoogle Scholar) combined with the high GSH levels of the stationary phase (35Loewen P.C. Can. J. Biochem. 1979; 57: 107-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), and the distorted morphology of the grxB − cells at the stationary phase imply a vital yet unknown function for Grx2. The three-dimensional structure of the molecule may provide some hints. Grx2 shows close structural similarities to the glutathione S-transferase family of proteins (6Xia B. Vlamis-Gardikas A. Holmgren A. Wright P.E. Dyson H.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 310: 907-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), the human glutathione transferase omega 1 (GSTO1) (46Board P.G. Coggan M.

Story M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5131-5137Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), and the human chloride intracellular channel 1 (CLIC1) (48Dulhunty A. Gage P. Curtis S. Chelvanayagam G. Board P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3319-3323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Common structural characteristics are a two-domain structure, the first domain being a thioredoxin fold domain in which the active site residues, and the second domain an α-helical structure. All these proteins are detoxifying or stress response proteins. The similarities to CLIC1, belonging to a family of proteins involved with forming chloride channels in intracellular membranes or are chloride channel modulators (48Dulhunty A. Gage P. Curtis S. Chelvanayagam G. Board P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3319-3323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar), provides the interesting possibility that Grx2 may be involved in osmoregulation, especially after the up-regulation of Grx2 by hyperosmosis. Another potential function for the up-regulation of Grx2 at the stationary phase could be the alleviation of the host responses to E. coli. Grx2 prevents apoptosis in rat neurons by activating the binding activity of NF-κB via Ref-1 (49Daily D. Vlamis-Gardikas A. Offen D. Mittelman L. Melamed E. Holmgren A. Barzilai A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1335-1344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Grx2 can actually affect both the Ras/phosphoinotiside 3-kinase/Akt/NF-κB and the JNK1/2/AP1 cascades (50Daily D. Vlamis-Gardikas A. Offen D. Mittelman L. Melamed E. Holmgren A. Barzilai A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21618-21626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). When growing in LB 10% of total Grx2 can be detected extracellularly after 24 h of growth (data not shown). It is therefore tempting to envisage an anti-inflammatory role of this protein in relation to symbiosis with the host. The up-regulation of Grx2 transcription under acidic conditions (39Arnold C.N. McElhanon J. Lee A. Leonhart R. Siegele D.A. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 2178-2186Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar) also points to a host defense adaptation. Clearly, more work is needed to elucidate the role of E. coli Grx2. We are grateful to Anne Farewell, Thomas Nyström, Anna Karin Pernerstig, Reginne Hengge-Aronis, and Micheal Cashel for plasmids and strains. We thank Silke Nicklisch for work related with the survival of the grxB null mutants and Annie Kolb for stimulating discussions."

Very long chain fatty acids (VLCFA) 1The abbreviations used are: VLCFAvery long chain fatty acidsESTexpressed sequence tagRTreverse transcriptionORFopen reading framePAMpre-adipocyte mediumntnucleotides. have been recognized as structural components in a variety of fat molecules such as glycerophospholipids, sphingolipids, and wax- and sterol esters. Depending on their chain length and degree of unsaturation, they contribute to the fluidity and other physical and chemical properties of the membrane. VLCFA are found in virtually all cells and are major constituents of the brain, skin and testis. For example, the brain contains high amounts of VLCFA consisting of 24 or more carbons, which are required for normal brain myelination (1Poulos A. Gibson R. Sharp P. Beckman K. Grattan-Smith P. Ann. Neurol. 1994; 36: 741-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). VLCFA are also needed in the synthesis of ceramides, which are necessary for the formation and function of the permeability layer of the skin. The ceramides, together with free VLCFA, comprise more than 50% of the fatty acids found in the epidermis, the outermost layer of the skin, which is the highest amount present in any mammalian tissue (2Stewart M.E. Downing D.T. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 1434-1439Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). very long chain fatty acids expressed sequence tag reverse transcription open reading frame pre-adipocyte medium nucleotides. Synthesis of VLCFA is performed in the endoplasmic reticulum and in mitochondria by membrane-bound enzymes; the former is more prominent (3Cinti D.L. Cook L. Nagi M.N. Suneja S.K. Prog.

Elovl1 2In accordance with the Mouse and Human Nomenclature Committees the assigning symbols for the mouse genes Scc1, Ssc2, and Cig30 are changed to Elovl1, Elovl2, and Elovl3, respectively.

Elovl1 is expressed in all tissues tested and the enzyme is believed to elongate very long fatty acids up to C26 (4Tvrdik P. Westerberg R. Silve S. Asadi A. Jakobsson A. Cannon B. Loison G. Jacobsson A. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 707-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Especially high levels of expression are found in stomach, lung, kidney, skin, and intestine (4Tvrdik P. Westerberg R. Silve S. Asadi A. Jakobsson A. Cannon B. Loison G. Jacobsson A. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 707-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar), which suggests that ELOVL1 may be important for developing a proper barrier in epithelial cells and skin. In addition, ELOVL1 has also been suggested to be a crucial enzyme involved in the formation of myelin in the central nervous system in mouse (4Tvrdik P. Westerberg R. Silve S. Asadi A. Jakobsson A. Cannon B. Loison G. Jacobsson A. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 707-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Although the Elovl1 mRNA sequence has been identified, very little is known about the genetic nature of mammalian fatty acid chain elongation enzymes. To scrutinize the genomic background and regulation of Elovl1 in greater detail we have isolated a lambda phage genomic DNA clone containing the entire mouse Elovl1 gene. Surprisingly, we found that the Elovl1 gene is linked to the gene coding for the cell cycle protein p55Cdc (14Weinstein J. Karim J. Geschwind D.H. Nelson S.F. Krumm J. Sakamoto K.M. Mol. Genet. Metab. 1998; 64: 52-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) in a bi-directional manner. Despite the fact that both genes are very tightly linked and expressed in all cell types at some point, our findings indicate a complex co-regulation during the cell cycle. Even more surprising is that a similar tail-to-tail arrangement was also found for the Elovl3 gene and the homeobox gene Pitx3 (6Tvrdik P. Asadi A. Kozak L.P. Nuglozeh E. Parente F. Nedergaard J. Jacobsson A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26387-26392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). It is therefore intriguing that two closely related genes from the same gene family are both juxtaposed with two completely unrelated genes in a tail-to-tail arrangement. Genomic clones of Elovl1 were isolated by plaque hybridization of a commercial mouse 129 strain liver genomic DNA library in the Lambda FIX II vector (Stratagene, cat. no. 946308) with a 32P-labeled probe corresponding to 0.92 kb from the 5′-end of the Elovl1 cDNA (GenBankTM accession no. AF170907). Hybridization was carried out overnight at 45 °C in 50% formamide, 5× SSC, 5× Denhardt's solution, 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.5, 0.5% SDS, and 100 μg/ml degraded herring sperm DNA. The membranes were first washed twice for 15 min at room temperature in 2× SSC, 0.1% SDS, and a high stringency wash was then performed at 55 °C in 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS for 15–30 min. Screening of ∼1.5 × 106 plaques yielded one positive recombinant, which was isolated by two additional rounds of plaque purification. Phage DNA was prepared on a large scale by the polyethylene glycol precipitation method according to Ref. 15Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning, A Laboratory Manual, second edition. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, New York1989Google Scholar. Restriction fragments generated by various combinations of restriction enzymes were analyzed by Southern blotting. For sequencing of a full-length mouse p55Cdc cDNA, we combined the sequences from three EST clones (accession nos. AI327152, AA497914, and AA537091) obtained from the I.M.A.G.E. Consortium and a 735-bp RT-PCR (Promega, cat. no. A1250) product obtained from mouse liver total RNA covering the 3′-end of p55Cdc mRNA. At least two independent PCR products were sequenced to check that no amplification errors occurred. RT-PCR experiments were performed using primer 5′-GATCAAGGAGGGCAACTACC-3′ for the 5′-end and primer 5′-GCTTTTTCCCGCTACGCCGA-3′ for the 3′-end. The PCR products were subcloned into pCR-XL-TOPO vector (Invitrogen, cat. no. K4700-10) and sequenced. Using recombinant phage DNA as a template, the genomic insert was sequenced by the primer walking strategy. Sequencing was performed with an ABI 373A automatic DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems) on reactions prepared by the dye-termination method, using the ABI Prisms Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Applied Biosystems, cat. no. 4303149). The sequence information was compiled and analyzed with the use of the University of Wisconsin Genetics Computer Group software (16Devereux J. Haeberli P. Smithies O. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 387-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (11531) Google Scholar). The complete nucleotide sequence of a 6034-bp genomic fragment and the p55Cdc cDNA sequence has been deposited in GenBankTM (accession nos. AF322919and AF312208). Total RNA was isolated using the ULTRASPECTM RNA Isolation System (Biotecx) from the different tissues of a 6-week-old NMRI male mouse kept at room temperature and from the brown adipose tissue of another sibling male mouse that was cold-exposed at 4 °C for 3 days. Northern blotting and hybridization were performed as previously described (5Tvrdik P. Asadi A. Kozak L.P. Nedergaard J. Cannon B. Jacobsson A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31738-31746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The DNA probes used were the Elovl1 ORF probe (a 923-bp fragment corresponding to nt 104–1027 in the Elovl1 cDNA) and the p55Cdc probe (a 1.75-kb fragment corresponding to full-length cDNA). The probes were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using a random-primed DNA labeling kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). DNase-treated total RNA (1.5 μg from brown fat, kidney, heart, and liver) was reverse-transcribed and amplified in one step using a Promega Access RT-PCR System kit (cat. no. A1250). The PCR reaction was carried out with the primers: forward, 5′-CGGGAAACCACTGAGATTGT-3′ and reverse, 5′-ATCTTCCTTATGTCCCAGCA-3′, for the Elovl1 amplification; and the primers forward, 5′-CTCAGCGGCAAACCTCAGAA-3′ and reverse, 5′-ACTGGTTCCTCCTCCTGTTG-3′ for p55Cdc amplification. The following cycle parameters were used: 48 °C for 45 min, 94 °C for 2 min (RT), 94 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 1 min, 68 °C for 2 min (40 cycles), 68 °C for 7 min (PCR), 4 °C soak. The PCR products were electrophoresed in a 2% agarose gel in 0.5× Tris borate/EDTA buffer and photographed. For PCR analysis of the Elovl1/p55Cdc gene linkage genomic C57BL/6 mouse DNA was used as template. The PCR reaction was carried out with primers 5′-GTCAGAATGGGCAGGCAGCA-3′, complementary to mouse Elovl1 genomic sequence 5008–5027, and 5′-GGGGCCTGTCTGAGTGCTGTGGAT-3′, complementary to p55Cdc mouse mRNA sequence 1287–1310. Genomic DNA was prepared from mouse tails by the simplified mammalian DNA isolation procedure published by Laird et al. (17Laird P.W. Zijderveld A. Linders K. Rudnicki M.A. Jaenisch R. Berns A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19 (4293): 4293Crossref PubMed Scopus (1303) Google Scholar). Tail biopsies were collected from 3-week-old mice of the C57BL/6J strain and used directly for DNA isolation. Digested DNA was separated on an 0.8% agarose gel and transferred to a Hybond N+ membrane (Amersham Biosciences) according to standard procedures (15Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning, A Laboratory Manual, second edition. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, New York1989Google Scholar). Hybridization and washing conditions were identical to those used for library screening, except that the second wash was carried out under low-stringency conditions (15 min at 40 °C in 0.5× SSC, 0.1% SDS). The radiolabel was detected by exposure to DuPont Cronex x-ray films with an intensifying screen at −80 °C. HIB-1B cells, provided by Dr. B. Spiegelman (Boston, MA), were grown in pre-adipocyte medium (PAM), i.e.Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, supplemented with 2 mm glutamine and 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (18Ross S.R. Choy L. Graves R.A. Fox N. Solevjeva V. Klaus S. Ricquier D. Spiegelman B.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7561-7565Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Cells were induced to differentiate in adipocyte medium (AM) by the addition of 20 nm insulin and 1 nmtriiodothyronine. At this stage, the cells were allowed to become confluent without a change of medium for up to 3 days (19Antonson P. Pray M.G. Jacobsson A. Xanthopoulos K.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 232: 397-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). A 129 SvJ mouse genomic DNA library was screened with an Elovl1 cDNA probe (4Tvrdik P. Westerberg R. Silve S. Asadi A. Jakobsson A. Cannon B. Loison G. Jacobsson A. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 707-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar) that resulted in a clone containing a 17-kb fragment. By subsequent hybridization with probes specific for the 5′- and 3′-ends of the Elovl1 cDNA, the fragment was identified as covering the entire Elovl1 gene. The nucleotide sequence was determined by primer walking strategy directly from the phage DNA. The Elovl1 gene spans ∼5.4 kb of genomic DNA and is composed of eight exons (Fig. 1A). The exons range in size from 58 to 720 bp and the introns range from 77 to 2285 bp. The sequences at the exon/intron junctions are reported in Table I. As indicated, the splice junctions of the seven intervening introns are well conserved and follow the gt-ag rule (20Breathnach R. Chambon P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1981; 50: 349-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (3298) Google Scholar) and score highly in terms of the derived consensus sequences at these sites (21Shapiro M.B. Senapathy P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 7155-7174Crossref PubMed Scopus (1977) Google Scholar). In contrast to our sequencing data obtained from a full-length Elovl1 cDNA (4Tvrdik P. Westerberg R. Silve S. Asadi A. Jakobsson A. Cannon B. Loison G. Jacobsson A. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 707-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar), we were unable to identify a genomic sequence containing the first 41 bp previously described within the cDNA fragment. However, our genomic sequence does not contain a conserved splice acceptor site, which would have supported the existence of an extra 5′-exon. Furthermore, we have not been able to retrieve any EST sequence containing the extra 41 bp. This difference is presumably due to a cloning artifact of the mouse cDNA because the human gene (GenBankTM accession no.AL139289) also lacks the corresponding sequence. The translation initiation codon (ATG) is located in the second exon, and the protein coding sequence stretches into the eighth exon. The proximal promoter sequence does not contain a TATA-box consensus site. Instead, there are several short interspersed GC-rich elements in the close vicinity of the transcription start site. The polyadenylation signal earlier described by Tvrdik et al. (4Tvrdik P. Westerberg R. Silve S. Asadi A. Jakobsson A. Cannon B. Loison G. Jacobsson A. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 707-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar) is located within the eighth exon at 5064–5070 bp.Table IExon/intron boundary sequences of the mouse Elovl1 geneExon sequences are in capital letters.

Open table in a new tab Exon sequences are in capital letters. The nucleotide consensus sequence of the intron splice junctions are shown in boldface. The amino acid positions encoded by spliced codons are indicated in parentheses. To verify if Elovl1 is a single copy gene we performed a Southern blot analysis of mouse DNA. As shown in Fig. 2, following digestion with BglI, SacI, and XbaI, the mouse Elovl1 ORF probe only strongly hybridized to genomic fragments that were of the predicted size, suggesting that Elovl1 is a single copy gene in the mouse genome. Sequencing of the untranscribed flanking regions of the Elovl1 gene revealed that the cloned insert contained part of yet another gene closely linked to the 3′-end of the Elovl1 gene. A BLAST search identified the sequence as corresponding to the cell cycle gene p55Cdc (Fig. 1A) (14Weinstein J. Karim J. Geschwind D.H. Nelson S.F. Krumm J. Sakamoto K.M. Mol. Genet. Metab. 1998; 64: 52-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). p55Cdc is a mammalian homolog of a family of cell cycle proteins from widely divergent species that has been implicated in cell cycle-regulated ubiquitin–mediated proteolysis (22Sehti N. Monteagudo M.C. Koshland D. Hogan E. Burke D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5592-5602Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Weinstein J. Jacobsen F.W. Hsu-Chen J., Wu, T. Baum L.G. Mol. Cell.

Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1871-1883Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). The p55Cdc gene consists of 10 exons and has been analyzed in detail in rat (GenBankTM accession no. AF-052695) (14Weinstein J. Karim J. Geschwind D.H. Nelson S.F. Krumm J. Sakamoto K.M. Mol. Genet. Metab. 1998; 64: 52-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A) but not in mouse or man. Our lambda genomic clone covers the last 688 nucleotides of the p55Cdc gene including the last exon and intron and part of exon number 9. The sequence identity between the published genomic rat p55Cdc and the sequence we have determined from our genomic clone is 86% over a total region of 1189 nucleotides. To confirm the Elovl1/p55Cdc organization in mouse we ran a PCR with mouse genomic DNA as a template. An expected fragment of ∼2200 bp was obtained with primers complementary to a sequence within exon 8 of Elovl1 and within the mouse p55Cdc mRNA corresponding to a sequence within exon 8 ∼1900 bp into the p55Cdc gene (see below and under “Materials and Methods”) (Fig. 1, A and B). Sequence analysis of the DNA fragment confirmed the nucleotide identity as mouse Elovl1/p55Cdc. Although both Elovl1 and p55Cdc are highly conserved genes, a BLAST search suggests that the tail-to-tail arrangement has evolved in vertebrates (Table II). Linkage data from the WICGR Mouse RH Gene Map Release Data suggests that this region of human chromosome 1 has its equivalence on mouse chromosome 4.Table IIChromosomal arrangement of the Elovl1 and p55Cdc genes in different organismsOrganismArrangementChromosome (Elovl1/p55Cdc)Accession number (Elovl1/p55Cdc)H. sapienstail-to-tail1AL139289M. musculustail-to-tailNot mapped (4)AF322919 (this paper)R. norvegicustail-to-tailNot mappedAF052695D. melanogasterseparate3R/2LAE0037739/AAA83150C. elegansseparateIII/IIZ47358/CAA87433S. cerevisiaeseparateXII/VIICAA55129/CAA96703The chromosomal arrangement of the Elovl1 and p55Cdc genes is indicated as tail-to-tail or as separate based on genomic sequences obtained by us (this paper) or through BLAST search.

The genomic sequences are indicated as accession numbers. The mRNA for p55Cdc has been sequenced for rat and human (23Weinstein J. Jacobsen F.W. Hsu-Chen J., Wu, T. Baum L.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3350-3363Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) but not for mouse. To confirm the p55Cdc sequence, we compared the genomic p55Cdc sequence from mouse to the EST data base and found several highly similar nucleotide sequences. Three clones (accession nos. AI327152,AA497914, and AA537091) were acquired from the I.M.A.G.E. Consortium. The full-length cDNA sequence was obtained by sequencing the overlap of these three clones and a 735-bp RT-PCR product covering the 3′-end of p55Cdc mRNA. The nucleotide sequence is shown in Fig. 3. Sequence identity between the cDNA sequence and the sequence we determined from our genomic clone was 100% over a total region of 243 nucleotides. The sequence identity between the published rat cDNA p55Cdc and the mouse cDNA was 91%. Elovl1 and p55Cdc are oriented in a tail-to-tail manner in a remarkably tight linkage. In fact, there exists a submitted EST sequence from the WashU-HHMI Mouse EST Project with accession number AA718173 corresponding to a Elovl1 mRNA from mammary gland that appears to overlap the transcribed p55Cdc mRNA with 16 nucleotides. We acquired the clone and verified the complete nucleotide sequence versus our genomic clone over a total region of 560 nucleotides. From our sequence data, we were able to identify 37 additional nucleotides, which were complementary to exon 10 of the p55Cdc gene, as well as a 50-bp-long poly(A) tail (GenBankTM accession no. BM445297). These results show that there is a total overlap of 53 nucleotides in the two transcripts (Figs. 1A and4C). Because we have not detected more than one mRNA species on our Northern blots (see Fig. 6), this is probably not a major cleavage site of Elovl1 transcription.Figure 6Elovl1 and p55Cdc mRNA levels in mouse tissues. Northern blot analyses were performed with 10 μg of total RNA isolated from the tissues indicated. BAT, 4 °C, refers to RNA isolated from the brown adipose tissue of a mouse exposed to 4 °C for 3 days. All other RNA samples were isolated from animals kept at thermoneutral temperature (28 °C). WAT, white adipose tissue; SK. MUSCLE, skeletal muscle. The membranes were probed with32P-labeled cDNA fragments corresponding to open reading frames of Elovl1 and p55Cdc, respectively and subsequently exposed to DuPont Cronex x-ray films for up to 1 week. The position of the ribosomal 18 S RNA is indicated on the right.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To confirm the presence of overlapping mRNA species in different tissues, we performed RT-PCR on total RNA from brown adipose tissue, kidney, heart, and lung with primers corresponding to the 3′-untranslated region of the long Elovl1 mRNA from mammary gland (GenBankTM accession no. AA718173). As shown in Fig. 5A, we amplified the anticipated 307 bp product (primers from nt 5075 to 5094 and nt 5363 to 5382 in the genomic clone) in brown adipose tissue, kidney, heart, and lung, confirming that such Elovl1 transcripts exist that overlap p55Cdc by 53 bp (Fig. 4C). In contrast, we were unable to amplify a specific fragment within the same tissues with primers specific for p55Cdc (primers from nt 516 to 535 and nt 1234 to 1253 in the cDNA clone) (Fig. 5B). The ELOVL1 protein is involved in the formation of membrane lipids and earlier results revealed that Elovl1 was ubiquitously expressed (4Tvrdik P. Westerberg R. Silve S. Asadi A. Jakobsson A. Cannon B. Loison G. Jacobsson A. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 707-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). The p55Cdc is highly expressed in proliferating but not in differentiated or growth-arrested cells (24Weinstein J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28501-28511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). To verify the Elovl1 and p55Cdc expression, we first compared the mRNA levels within different tissues. As seen in Fig. 6, the expression pattern in different tissues was dissimilar for the two genes. In agreement with our earlier results, the Elovl1 expression was diversified in different mouse tissues, with the highest steady-state mRNA levels in stomach, lung, kidney, skin, intestine, and some specific brain tissues, whereas white fat, liver, spleen, brown fat, heart, and muscle showed moderate Elovl1 expression. Only a very weak Elovl1 mRNA signal was found in the testis. In contrast, the highest level of p55Cdc mRNA was found in testis, whereas spleen and intestine showed moderate expression. Low or undetectable amounts of p55Cdc mRNA were obtained from fat tissue, liver, brain, lung, stomach, muscle tissue, and skin. To see if the pattern of mRNA levels for the two genes was synchronously affected during cell growth, we analyzed the expression pattern in a brown fat cell line, HIB-1B, during a proliferative stage and when cells were induced to differentiate. These cells, which are derived from a brown fat hibernoma, are known to differentiate in culture when they reach confluence and are subsequently exposed to a differentiation medium (18Ross S.R. Choy L. Graves R.A. Fox N. Solevjeva V. Klaus S. Ricquier D. Spiegelman B.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7561-7565Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). During the preconfluent stage, the cells showed the highest level of expression of both genes (Fig. 7). After confluence, the cells showed decreased levels of both Elovl1 and p55Cdc mRNA with time, even if the culture medium was not changed to differentiation medium. This indicates that, although the genes were shown to be independently regulated in a tissue-specific manner, during a specific phase of development, certain cells may have a synchronized expression of Elovl1 and p55Cdc mRNA. Elovl1 is a highly conserved gene and a member of a recently recognized mammalian gene family whose products have been indicated as being involved in the formation of very long chain fatty acids and sphingolipids (4Tvrdik P. Westerberg R. Silve S. Asadi A. Jakobsson A. Cannon B. Loison G. Jacobsson A. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 707-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar) We have isolated here a lambda phage genomic DNA clone containing the entire mouse Elovl1 gene. Although the length of the gene, as well as the transcript, is relatively similar to the closely related gene Elovl3, the exon-intron structure is markedly different (8 exons versus 4 exons) (6Tvrdik P. Asadi A. Kozak L.P. Nuglozeh E. Parente F. Nedergaard J. Jacobsson A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26387-26392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Because the encoded polypeptides are very similar both in size and sequence, there is no obvious explanation for these structural differences. Surprisingly, sequencing of the lambda clone revealed that the insert contained the 3′ part of the newly identified cell cycle gene p55Cdc (14Weinstein J. Karim J. Geschwind D.H. Nelson S.F. Krumm J. Sakamoto K.M. Mol. Genet. Metab. 1998; 64: 52-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) in the opposite orientation. The genes are very tightly linked, so the 3′-ends of their long mRNA species are complementary over a short stretch of nucleotides. Despite the fact that overlapping genes are rare events in eukaryotes (26Lerner A. D'Adamio L. Diener A.C. Clayton L.K. Reinherz E.L. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 3152-3162PubMed Google Scholar, 27Batshake B. Sundelin J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 227: 70-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 28Campbell H.D. Fountain S. Young I.G. Claudianos C. Hoheisel J.D. Chen K.S. Lupski J.R. Genomics. 1997; 42: 46-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), a similar tail-to-tail arrangement was also found for the Elovl3 gene and the homeobox gene Pitx3 (6Tvrdik P. Asadi A. Kozak L.P. Nuglozeh E. Parente F. Nedergaard J. Jacobsson A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26387-26392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Except for homologous genes that may have arisen by gene duplication, adjacent genes are normally separated by tens to hundreds of kilobases within the mammalian genome. It is therefore intriguing that two closely related genes from the same gene family are both juxtaposed with two completely unrelated genes within an 8–9-kb stretch in a tail-to-tail arrangement. The ELOVL1 protein has been identified as a fatty acid elongase, which elongates VLCFAs up to 26 carbon atoms (4Tvrdik P. Westerberg R. Silve S. Asadi A. Jakobsson A. Cannon B. Loison G. Jacobsson A. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 707-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Under normal circumstances, a substantial amount of VLCFA is linked to a long chain sphingoid base sphinganine, forming a ceramide, which constitutes the lipid backbone of sphingomyelin and other sphingolipids. Sphingolipids are essential for cell proliferation. Impaired sphingolipid synthesis leads to cessation of cell growth both in yeast (29Wells G.B. Lester R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 10200-10203Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and mammalian cells (30Hanada K. Nishijima M. Kiso M. Hasegawa A. Fujita S. Ogawa T. Akamatsu Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23527-23533Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Concomitantly, p55Cdc is the mammalian homolog to the cell cycle protein CDC20p in yeast (22Sehti N. Monteagudo M.C. Koshland D. Hogan E. Burke D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5592-5602Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Weinstein J. Jacobsen F.W. Hsu-Chen J., Wu, T. Baum L.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3350-3363Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) and the Fizzy protein in Drosophila (31Dawson I.A. Roth S. Artavanis-Tsakonas S. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 725-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) and is required for the metaphase-anaphase transition (32Kramer E.R. Gieffers C. Holzl G. Hengstschlager M. Peters J.M. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1207-1210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). EST sequences corresponding to both mRNAs can be found as early as in the fertilized egg during mouse development. It is therefore probable that the two genes are expressed during the proliferative phase in any cell type. Obviously, overlapping genes in opposite orientation generate transcripts that could form RNA duplexes if present in the same cell. In particular, several recent reports show that short stretches of double-stranded RNA molecules may serve as a template for specific RNA nuclease activity leading to gene silencing (33Fire A., Xu, S. Montgomery M.K. Kostas S.A. Driver S.E. Mello C.C. Nature. 1998; 391: 806-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (11908) Google Scholar, 34Bass B.L. Cell. 2000; 101: 235-238Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar, 35Domeier M.E. Morse D.P. Knight S.W. Portereiko M. Bass B.L. Mango S.E. Science. 2000; 289: 1928-1930Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Because both Elovl1 and p55Cdc genes exhibit a rather ubiquitous tissue expression pattern at some point, we can therefore not exclude this possibility that a short tail-to-tail sense-antisense structure may serve as a template for specific RNA nuclease activity leading to gene silencing. Interestingly, there is an identical 9-bp element, CTCAAAAGA, within the 3′-untranslated region of each gene, 124 and 126 bp, respectively, downstream from the sites where the poly(A) tails are added onto each of the genes. We searched the data base for factors that could recognize this element but no such finding occurred. The promoter of the p55Cdc gene has been analyzed in rat and contains several cell cycle regulatory motifs, which are known to repress constitutive transcription during G0 and early G1 phases of the cell cycle (14Weinstein J. Karim J. Geschwind D.H. Nelson S.F. Krumm J. Sakamoto K.M. Mol. Genet. Metab. 1998; 64: 52-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). In our study, we show that Elovl1 and p55Cdc have a distinct tissue-specific expression. However, in synchronized brown fat cells, we found that the expression of both genes was high during the proliferative phase and decreased upon differentiation of the cells. This is in agreement with p55Cdc being strictly expressed during mitosis. Notably, although Elovl1 is ubiquitously expressed, its expression is also decreased during differentiation of the cells. This may indicate that both genes are under a common regulator(s) during the cell cycle. One could speculate that there are common constitutive factors that keep the Elovl1-p55Cdc locus in a transcriptionally open position but only during a proliferative phase, and in addition to this there are specific cell cycle factors that apply a specific restriction on the p55Cdc gene. However, an understanding of the mechanism of action of this interesting gene interaction must await further knowledge about interacting factors within the Elovl1 gene.

https://openalex.org/W1995839838,"Fibrin formation depends on the release of the two N-terminal fibrinopeptides A (FPA) from fibrinogen, and its formation is accompanied by an intermediate, alpha-profibrin, which lacks only one of the FPA. In this study, we confirm that the maximal levels of alpha-profibrin found over the course of thrombin reactions with human fibrinogen are only half of what would be expected if the first and second FPA were being released independently with equal rate constants. The rapidity of release of the fibrinopeptides by thrombin had been shown to depend on an allosteric transformation that is induced when Na(+) binds to a site defined by the 215-227 residues of thrombin, a transformation that results in the exposure of its fibrinogen-binding exosites transforming the thrombin from a slow to a fast acting form toward fibrinogen. When choline was substituted for sodium to transform thrombin to its slow form, the maximal levels of alpha-profibrin rose to those expected for independent release of the two FPA. Thus, it is only the fast thrombin that releases the second FPA fast, and that fast release only occurs when both FPA are present because of a partial coupling of its release with that of the first FPA. The release of the FPA from purified alpha-profibrin with the first FPA already missing is no faster than the release of any FPA. Surprisingly, we also found that slow thrombin became increasingly transformed to a fast form in the absence of sodium when the fibrinogen was elevated to high concentrations. This potentiation by concentrated fibrinogen also occurs with the recombinant mutant thrombin (Y225P), which is otherwise slow in both the presence and absence of Na(+). The potentiation of thrombin by fibrinogen must be short-lived so that the thrombin reverts to its slow acting form in the interim among encounters with other fibrinogen molecules in dilute fibrinogen solutions lacking Na(+), whereas at high fibrinogen concentrations the thrombin encounters other molecules before it reverts back to the slow form."
