TUG was performed using the standard protocol and scores were then stratified based on with and without mild cognitive impairment (MCI), gender and in a 5-year age groups ranging from ages of 60's to 80's.529(16%) participants were identified to have MCI. Past history of falls and medical history of hypertension, heart disease, joint pain, hearing and vision problem, and urinary incontinence were found to have influenced TUG performance. Cognitive status as a mediator, predicted TUG performance even when both gender and age were controlled for (B 0.24, 95% CI (0.02-0.47), β 0.03, t 2.10, p = 0.36). Further descriptive analysis showed, participants with MCI, women and older in age took a longer time to complete TUG, as compared to men with MCI across all age groups with exceptions for some age groups.These results suggested that MCI needs to be taken into consideration when testing older adults using TUG, besides age and gender factors. Data using fast speed TUG may be required among older adults with and without MCI for further understanding."
https://openalex.org/W2763809267,"Foreign languages are often learned in emotionally neutral academic environments which differ greatly from the familiar context where native languages are acquired. This difference in learning contexts has been argued to lead to reduced emotional resonance when confronted with a foreign language. In the current study, we investigated whether the reactivity of the sympathetic nervous system in response to emotionally-charged stimuli is reduced in a foreign language. To this end, pupil sizes were recorded while reading aloud emotional sentences in the native or foreign language. Additionally, subjective ratings of emotional impact were provided after reading each sentence, allowing us to further investigate foreign language effects on explicit emotional understanding. Pupillary responses showed a larger effect of emotion in the native than in the foreign language. However, such a difference was not present for explicit ratings of emotionality. These results reveal that the sympathetic nervous system reacts differently depending on the language context, which in turns suggests a deeper emotional processing when reading in a native compared to a foreign language."
https://openalex.org/W2763242946,"Genome sequencing analysis has revealed at least 35 clusters of likely biosynthetic genes for secondary metabolites in Streptomyces ansochromogenes. Disruption of adpA encoding a global regulator (AdpA) resulted in the failure of nikkomycin production, whereas other antibacterial activities against Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, and Bacillus subtilis were observed with the fermentation broth of ΔadpA but not with that of the wild-type strain. Transcriptional analysis showed that a cryptic gene cluster (pks7), which shows high identity with an oviedomycin biosynthetic gene cluster (ovm), was activated in ΔadpA. The corresponding product of pks7 was characterized as oviedomycin by MS and NMR spectroscopy. To understand the molecular mechanism of ovm activation, the roles of six regulatory genes situated in the ovm cluster were investigated. Among them, proteins encoded by co-transcribed genes ovmZ and ovmW are positive regulators of ovm. AdpA directly represses the transcription of ovmZ and ovmW. Co-overexpression of ovmZ and ovmW can relieve the repression of AdpA on ovm transcription and effectively activate oviedomycin biosynthesis. The promoter of ovmOI–ovmH is identified as the direct target of OvmZ and OvmW. This is the first report that AdpA can simultaneously activate nikkomycin biosynthesis but repress oviedomycin biosynthesis in one strain. Our findings provide an effective strategy that is able to activate cryptic secondary metabolite gene clusters by genetic manipulation of global regulatory genes.

The crisis of antibiotic resistance has become an impending global problem, and it brings a significant threat to human health, so novel antibiotics are required to combat the evolving pathogens and new emerging diseases. Traditional large-scale screening of environmental microorganisms for bioactive molecules has been unable to meet the need (1Baltz R.H. Marcel Faber Roundtable: is our antibiotic pipeline unproductive because of starvation, constipation or lack of inspiration?.J. Ind. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2006; 33: 507-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Therefore, it has become necessary to develop new technologies to discover novel bioactive compounds from diverse natural resources (2van Wezel G.P. McKenzie N.L. Nodwell J.R. Chapter 5. Applying the genetics of secondary metabolism in model actinomycetes to the discovery of new antibiotics.Methods Enzymol. 2009; 458: 117-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Genome sequencing and in silico methods based on biological databases can rapidly pinpoint potential gene clusters for secondary metabolites, such as clustscan (3Starcevic A. Zucko J. Simunkovic J.

Cryptic secondary metabolite gene clusters have become a significant natural product reservoir, from which many more novel antibiotics could be discovered. The expression of cryptic gene clusters is conditioned and can be activated by genetic manipulations of essential genes (7Liu G. Chater K.F. Chandra G. Niu G. Tan H.

New approaches to antibiotic discovery.Biotechnol. Lett. 2017; 39: 805-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). One of the approaches is to replace the native promoters of biosynthetic structural genes with constitutive promoters. For example, productions of the blue pigment indigoidine and two novel members of the polycyclic tetramate macrolactam family were activated by insertion of a strong and constitutive promoter in front of the transcriptional unit of structural genes of a small NRPS cluster and a hybrid type I PKS-NRPS cluster in Streptomyces albus J1074 (9Olano C. García I. González A. Rodriguez M. Rozas D. Rubio J. Sánchez-Hidalgo M. Braña A.F. Méndez C. Salas J.A. Activation and identification of five clusters for secondary metabolites in Streptomyces albus J1074.Microb. Biotechnol. 2014; 7: 242-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Another activation approach is to overexpress positive regulatory genes or to disrupt the negative regulatory genes situated in the cluster. For example, a giant type I modular PKS gene cluster of Streptomyces ambofaciens ATCC23877 spanning almost 150 kb was activated by overexpression of a LAL family regulatory gene, leading to the discovery of stambomycins, unusual glycosylated macrolides with unique chemical structures and promising antiproliferative activity against human cancer cell lines (10Laureti L. Song L. Huang S. Corre C. Leblond P. Challis G.L. Aigle B. Identification of a bioactive 51-membered macrolide complex by activation of a silent polyketide synthase in Streptomyces ambofaciens.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2011; 108: 6258-6263Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Similarly, the production of chattamycins A and B in Streptomyces chattanoogensis was activated by overexpression of a pathway-specific activator gene chaI (11Zhou Z. Xu Q. Bu Q. Guo Y. Liu S. Liu Y. Du Y. Li Y. Genome mining-directed activation of a silent angucycline biosynthetic gene cluster in Streptomyces chattanoogensis.Chembiochem. 2015; 16: 496-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Disruption of a putative repressor gene, pgaY, activated the production of UWM6 and rabelomycin in Streptomyces sp. PGA64 (12Metsä-Ketelä M. Ylihonko K. Mäntsälä P. Partial activation of a silent angucycline-type gene cluster from a rubromycin β producing Streptomyces sp. PGA64.J. Antibiot. 2004; 57: 502-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), and disruption of jadR2 activated jadomycin B production in Streptomyces venezuelae (13Xu G. Wang J. Wang L. Tian X. Yang H.

Chem. 2010; 285: 27440-27448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Activation of cryptic gene clusters can also be achieved by genetic manipulation of global regulatory genes because they usually play a key role in controlling the check point for the onset of secondary metabolite biosynthesis. For example, disruption of dasR caused a significant increase in transcription of cpk genes in Streptomyces coelicolor (14Nazari B. Kobayashi M. Saito A. Hassaninasab A. Miyashita K. Fujii T. Chitin-induced gene expression in secondary metabolic pathways of Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2) grown in soil.Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2013; 79: 707-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Two novel tylosin analogues were generated by disruption of wblA in Streptomyces ansochromogenes (15Lu C. Liao G. Zhang J. Tan H. Identification of novel tylosin analogues generated by a wblA disruption mutant of Streptomyces ansochromogenes.Microb. Cell. Fact. 2015; 14: 173-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Integration of a functional bldA gene activated the production of a polyeneoic acid amide in Streptomyces calvus (16Kalan L. Gessner A. Thaker M.N. Waglechner N. Zhu X. Szawiola A. Bechthold A.

As one of the conserved global regulators in most of Streptomyces, AdpA can function as activator or repressor in terms of different target genes (17Gallegos M.T. Schleif R. Bairoch A. Hofmann K.

Microbiol. 2009; 73: 898-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In Streptomyces griseus, AdpA regulates more than 1000 genes, including those related to morphological development (20Yamazaki H. Ohnishi Y. Horinouchi S.

A-factor and phosphate depletion signals are transmitted to the grixazone biosynthesis genes via the pathway-specific transcriptional activator GriR.J. Bacteriol. 2007; 189: 3515-3524Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In Streptomyces lividans, the mutation of adpA affected the expression of more than 300 genes as revealed by transcriptomic analyses (25Guyet A. Benaroudj N. Proux C. Gominet M. Coppée J.Y. Mazodier P. Identified members of the Streptomyces lividans AdpA regulon involved in differentiation and secondary metabolism.BMC Microbiol. 2014; 14: 81-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Thus, the genetic manipulation of adpA could be an effective approach for the activation of cryptic gene clusters to gain novel antibiotics in Streptomyces. S. ansochromogenes is a natural producer of antifungal nikkomycin. Our previous results indicated that AdpA not only influenced morphological differentiation but also significantly affected nikkomycin production by directly controlling sanG, which encodes a pathway-specific transcriptional activator (26Pan Y. Liu G. Yang H. Tian Y. Tan H. The pleiotropic regulator AdpA-L directly controls the pathway-specific activator of nikkomycin biosynthesis in Streptomyces ansochromogenes.Mol. Microbiol. 2009; 72: 710-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). antiSMASH analysis of S. ansochromogenes draft genome sequence indicated that 35 secondary metabolite gene clusters exist in the genome (27Zhong X. Tian Y. Niu G. Tan H. Assembly and features of secondary metabolite biosynthetic gene clusters in Streptomyces ansochromogenes.Sci. China Life. Sci. 2013; 56: 609-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), of which only two corresponding secondary metabolites (nikkomycin and tylosin analogues) were identified. Therefore, it is expected to obtain more bioactive metabolites from the cryptic gene clusters by adpA manipulation. In this work, we demonstrated that the cryptic oviedomycin biosynthetic gene cluster could be activated by disruption of adpA in S. ansochromogenes, and the activation mechanism was investigated. It is intriguing that the cluster-situated regulators (OvmZ and OvmW) are the targets of AdpA, and they collaboratively control oviedomycin biosynthesis. A previous study (26Pan Y. Liu G. Yang H. Tian Y. Tan H. The pleiotropic regulator AdpA-L directly controls the pathway-specific activator of nikkomycin biosynthesis in Streptomyces ansochromogenes.Mol. Microbiol. 2009; 72: 710-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) indicated that disruption of adpA in S. ansochromogenes (the wild-type strain) resulted in the failure of nikkomycin production. Due to the pleiotropic role of AdpA on target genes, it is interesting to know whether new bioactive compounds could be generated by adpA disruption. The fermentation broth of ΔadpA and the WT strain was subjected to bioassays against pathogenic bacteria. As a result, clear inhibition zones against Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, and Bacillus subtilis) were observed in the fermentation broth of ΔadpA (Fig. 1), which do not occur in the broth of WT strain. The results indicated that disruption of adpA led to the biosynthesis of other bioactive compound, whereas nikkomycin production was completely abolished. The bioactivity profiles of complemented strain (ΔadpAc) were restored to the same level as WT strain (Fig. 1), indicating that disruption of adpA is essential for both the production of new compound and the abolishment of nikkomycin biosynthesis. To verify the corresponding gene cluster(s) responsible for the newly emerged bioactive compound(s) in ΔadpA, we isolated the total RNA from both WT strain and ΔadpA grown in MS, SP, and GP media at different time courses, respectively. Transcription of the core genes (27Zhong X. Tian Y. Niu G. Tan H. Assembly and features of secondary metabolite biosynthetic gene clusters in Streptomyces ansochromogenes.Sci. China Life. Sci. 2013; 56: 609-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) in each PKS and NRPS secondary metabolic gene cluster in S. ansochromogenes genome was analyzed by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR). The gene clusters silent in WT strain but activated in ΔadpA are potentially responsible for the biosynthesis of the new bioactive compound. A core gene from pks7 in ΔadpA strain was transcribed in all detected media at each time course but not in WT strain (Fig. 2). Meanwhile, as we anticipated, the expression of nikkomycin biosynthetic gene cluster was impeded in ΔadpA (Fig. 2). These results indicated that pks7 was activated and may be responsible for the production of the bioactive metabolite in ΔadpA. BLAST analysis revealed that pks7 contains 26 complete ORFs spanning 27 kb and shares more than 95% DNA sequence identities with the oviedomycin biosynthetic gene cluster in Streptomyces antibioticus ATCC 11891 (28Lombó F. Braña A.F. Salas J.A. Méndez C. Genetic organization of the biosynthetic gene cluster for the antitumor angucycline oviedomycin in Streptomyces antibioticus ATCC 11891.Chembiochem. 2004; 5: 1181-1187Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). To verify if pks7 can also synthesize similar product in ΔadpA, the fermentation broth was analyzed by HPLC, and the active metabolite was isolated and characterized. On HPLC chromatograms, there was a distinct peak at a retention time of 28 min in the extract of ΔadpA, compared with that of WT strain (Fig. 3A). It exhibited inhibitory activity against S. aureus, whereas the HPLC solute methanol did not show inhibition zone (Fig. 3B). To determine the chemical structure of this compound, 3 liters of fermentation broth of ΔadpA in MS medium was harvested and extracted with chloroform. The organic phase was applied onto a Sephadex LH-20 column to remove most impurities, and finally the compound was separated and collected by semipreparative HPLC. The chemical structure of purified compound was determined by MS and NMR spectroscopy. A molecular ion peak at m/z− 349.0 was shown on the electrospray ionization-MS spectrum. MS/MS analysis revealed that most fragments were identical with those of the known angucyclinone oviedomycin (Fig. 3C) (29Méndez C. Künzel E. Lipata F. Lombó F. Cotham W. Walla M. Bearden D.W. Braña A.F. Salas J.A. Rohr J. Oviedomycin, an unusual angucyclinone encoded by genes of the oleandomycin-producer Streptomyces antibioticus ATCC11891.J. Nat. Prod. 2002; 65: 779-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Furthermore, 1H NMR and 13C NMR data were also consistent with those of oviedomycin (supplemental Fig. 1). Although the sugar side chain is not present in the structure as in other augucyclinone antibiotics, the purified oviedomycin showed good inhibitory activity against A549 (non-small-cell lung cancer), HepG2 (liver cancer) and MCF-7 (breast cancer) with IC50 < 20 μm (Fig. 3E). Thus, the disruption of adpA elicited the production of a compound potentially applicable as drug. There are 12 genes (ovmOI–ovmH) assembling as one transcriptional unit responsible for oviedomycin biosynthesis in S. antibioticus ATCC 11891 (28Lombó F. Braña A.F. Salas J.A. Méndez C. Genetic organization of the biosynthetic gene cluster for the antitumor angucycline oviedomycin in Streptomyces antibioticus ATCC 11891.Chembiochem. 2004; 5: 1181-1187Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). To verify whether pks7 is directly responsible for oviedomycin biosynthesis, the structural genes (ovmOI–ovmH) spanning >14-kb DNA fragments in this cluster were cloned into a Streptomyces integration vector pSET152 through Gibson assembly under the control of promoter PhrdB (Fig. 4A). The resulting construct was then introduced into S. coelicolor M1146 by conjugation for heterologous expression. As a result, oviedomycin was successfully produced in M1146 (Fig. 4B and supplemental Fig. 2), demonstrating that pks7 is undoubtedly responsible for oviedomycin biosynthesis in S. ansochromogenes, and then pks7 was designated as ovm. To reveal the activation mechanism of ovm by disruption of adpA, the transcription of structural and regulatory genes in ovm were analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) 3The abbreviations used are: qRT-PCRquantitative real-time PCRCSRcluster-situated regulatorGUSβ-glucuronidase enzymeX-Gluc5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-glucoronideYEMEyeast extract-malt extractntnucleotide. with the total RNA extracted from mycelia of WT strain and ΔadpA grown for 24 h. quantitative real-time PCR cluster-situated regulator β-glucuronidase enzyme 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-glucoronide yeast extract-malt extract nucleotide. In ovm, structural genes, ovmOI–ovmH, are in the same transcriptional direction and probably constitute one operon. Among the structural genes, ovmC, ovmP, ovmK, ovmS, ovmT, and ovmA are responsible for the ring skeleton formation; ovmOI, ovmOII, and ovmOIII are oxygenases responsible for the introduction of those oxygens; and ovmF, ovmG, and ovmH are involved in polyketide metabolism (30Lombó F. Abdelfattah M.S. Braña A.F. Salas J.A. Rohr J. Méndez C. Elucidation of oxygenation steps during oviedomycin biosynthesis and generation of derivatives with increased antitumor activity.Chembiochem. 2009; 10: 296-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). qRT-PCR showed that the transcription of four representative structural genes (ovmOI, ovmP, ovmS, and ovmT) from the operon (ovmOI-ovmH) in charge of oviedomycin biosynthesis increased 1000–4500-fold in ΔadpA compared with that in WT strain (Fig. 5A), indicating that AdpA plays a negative role in these genes’ expression. In addition, there are six putative regulatory genes (orf3, ovmY, ovmW, ovmR, orf4, and ovmZ) in ovm. Orf3 shares 49% amino acid sequence identity with the ArsR family regulator Rv2642 from Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv. OvmY shows 39% amino acid sequence identity with the TetR family regulator CprB from S. coelicolor. OvmR shares 61% amino acid sequence identity with the IclR family regulator WP_044364315 from Streptomyces natalensis. Orf3, OvmY, and OvmR contain a helix-turn-helix DNA-binding domain at the N terminus. Orf4 shares 62% amino acid sequence identity with the MarR family regulator SFJ27529 from Amycolatopsis sacchari and contains a helix-turn-helix domain at its interior. ovmW encoding a small protein with 63 amino acids was not annotated in S. antibioticus ATCC 11891, and OvmW shares 65% identity with MerR family regulator EpaH from Kitasatospora sp. HKI 714 (31Heine D. Martin K. Hertweck C. Genomics-guided discovery of endophenazines from Kitasatospora sp. HKI 714.J. Nat. Prod. 2014; 77: 1083-1087Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). However, both OvmW and EpaH have no identity with MerR family proteins in the sequence of amino acids by alignment (see “Discussion”). There is another putative regulatory gene ovmZ adjacent to ovmW. Its encoding product shares 59% identity with ChaP from chattamycin biosynthetic gene cluster in S. chattanoogensis L10 (11Zhou Z. Xu Q. Bu Q. Guo Y. Liu S. Liu Y. Du Y. Li Y.

Hertweck C. Genomics-guided discovery of endophenazines from Kitasatospora sp. HKI 714.J. Nat. Prod. 2014; 77: 1083-1087Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Despite the fact that OvmZ homologous proteins are widespread in Streptomyces, their functions have not been elucidated except for TylU, a regulator relating to tylosin production (33Bate N. Bignell D.R. Cundliffe E. Regulation of tylosin biosynthesis involving “SARP-helper” activity.Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 62: 148-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). It is noteworthy that most regulatory genes of this type situate in PKS biosynthetic gene clusters. Both ovmW and ovmZ were preliminarily predicted as regulatory genes. Their role in oviedomycin biosynthesis was assessed by qRT-PCR. The transcription of ovmY, ovmW, ovmR, orf4, and ovmZ was increased in ΔadpA compared with that in WT strain, and particularly the transcription of ovmZ, ovmW, and ovmY was increased >100-fold (Fig. 5B), whereas the transcription of orf3 was not affected. It was concluded that both structural and regulatory genes in ovm were up-regulated in ΔadpA, suggesting that AdpA plays a negative regulatory role in the transcription of cluster-situated regulator (CSR) genes except orf3. AdpA might regulate oviedomycin biosynthesis by controlling these CSR genes. To identify the roles of putative CSR genes on oviedomycin biosynthesis, disruptions of these genes were carried out via homologous recombination in both WT strain and ΔadpA. HPLC analysis of fermentation broth showed that oviedomycin production was not detected in ΔovmZ, ΔovmW, ΔovmR, ΔovmY, Δorf3, and Δorf4 strains as well as in WT strain (Fig. 6A), suggesting that none of the six regulatory genes plays the repressor role in oviedomycin biosynthesis. Moreover, oviedomycin produced in ΔadpA was completely abolished in the double mutants ΔadpA/ΔovmZ and ΔadpA/ΔovmW (Fig. 6B). A moderate decrease of oviedomycin production was detected in the double mutant ΔadpA/ΔovmR, whereas oviedomycin production in ΔadpA/ΔovmY, ΔadpA/Δorf3, and ΔadpA/Δorf4 strains was almost the same as in the ΔadpA strain (Fig. 6B). These results demonstrated that ovmZ and ovmW are essential for activation of oviedomycin biosynthetic gene cluster. To further clarify whether OvmZ, OvmW, and OvmR are positive regulators in oviedomycin biosynthesis, ovmZ, ovmW, or ovmR, respectively, was inserted into pKC1139 under the control of a strong constitutive expressed hrdB promoter (PhrdB) (36Du D. Zhu Y. Wei J. Tian Y. Niu G. Tan H. Improvement of gougerotin and nikkomycin production by engineering their biosynthetic gene clusters.Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2013; 97: 6383-6396Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The resulting recombinant plasmids were introduced into WT strain to generate XJJ101, XJJ102, and XJJ103, respectively. However, no oviedomycin was detected in these constructed strains, indicating that the overexpression of ovmZ, ovmW, or ovmR individually was not sufficient for activation of oviedomycin biosynthesis in WT strain. Because ovmZ and ovmW are adjacent and situated in the same operon in the cluster, we attempted to make co-overexpression of the two genes synchronously in WT strain by inserting them into pKC1139 as mentioned above. As anticipated, the resulting strain XJJ104 gave rise to much higher production of oviedomycin than ΔadpA (Fig. 6C). Subsequently, the transcriptional analyses of structural genes (ovmOI, ovmP, ovmS, and ovmT) in WT, ΔadpA, ΔadpA/ΔovmZ, and XJJ104 strains were performed by qRT-PCR. The biosynthetic genes were not transcribed in ΔadpA/ΔovmZ as in WT strain, whereas the transcriptional levels were 30–60 times higher in XJJ104 than those in ΔadpA (Fig. 5C). Therefore, co-overexpression of ovmZ and ovmW can derepress oviedomycin biosynthesis in WT strain. OvmZ and OvmW proved to be positive regulators for oviedomycin biosynthesis, and the expression of structural genes is dependent on the co-expression of OvmZ and OvmW. The above results showed that ovmZ and ovmW are required for oviedomycin biosynthesis, and global regulator AdpA exerts negative regulatory effect on oviedomycin biosynthesis by repressing the expression of ovmZW. To determine whether AdpA could directly regulate its target gene, AdpA-His6 was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) and purified through chromatography on nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin. EMSAs were performed by using AdpA-His6 with the promoter PovmZ as the probe. As anticipated, AdpA could form a complex with PovmZ in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 7A). EMSA suggested that AdpA inhibits oviedomycin biosynthesis in WT strain via directly repressing ovmZW transcription. To determine the specific binding sites of AdpA on the upstream region of ovmZ, DNase I footprinting was pe"
https://openalex.org/W2761272512,"Evidence-based practice (EBP) in management is still in its infancy. Several studies suggest that managers in businesses and other organizations do not consult the scientific evidence when making decisions. To facilitate its uptake, we need to better understand practitioner attitudes and perceived barriers related to EBP. In medicine and nursing, an abundance of research exists on this subject, although such studies are rare in management. To address this gap, we surveyed 2,789 management practitioners in Belgium, the Netherlands, the United States, the United Kingdom and Australia. Our findings indicate that most managers we studied have positive attitudes towards EBP. However, lack of time and a limited understanding of scientific research are perceived as major barriers to the uptake and implementation of EBP in management. Studies in other professions where EBP is far more established also report similar barriers. We discuss the implications of our findings for practice, education and research, providing suggestions to enhance use of EBP in management practice."

Post-translational modifications (PTMs) control and regulate many protein functions and cellular pathways, and PTMs of mutant Htt are likely important modulators of HD pathogenesis. Alterations of selected numbers of PTMs of Htt fragments have been shown to modulate Htt cellular localization and toxicity. In this study, we systematically introduced site-directed alterations in individual phosphorylation and acetylation sites in full-length Htt constructs. The effects of each of these PTM alteration constructs were tested on cell toxicity using our nuclear condensation assay and on mitochondrial viability by measuring mitochondrial potential and size. Using these functional assays in primary neurons, we identified several PTMs whose alteration can block neuronal toxicity and prevent potential loss and swelling of the mitochondria caused by mutant Htt. These PTMs included previously described sites such as serine 116 and newly found sites such as serine 2652 throughout the protein. We found that these functionally relevant sites are clustered in protease-sensitive domains throughout full-length Htt. These findings advance our understanding of the Htt PTM code and its role in HD pathogenesis. Because PTMs are catalyzed by enzymes, the toxicity-modulating Htt PTMs identified here may be promising therapeutic targets for managing HD.

https://openalex.org/W2762144556,"Background Zika virus (ZIKV) was first isolated in Africa; decades later, caused large outbreaks in the Pacific, and is considered endemic in Asia. We aim to describe ZIKV disease epidemiology outside the Americas, the importance of travelers as sentinels of disease transmission, and discrepancies in travel advisories from major international health organizations. Methods and findings This descriptive analysis using GeoSentinel Surveillance Network records involves sixty-four travel and tropical medicine clinics in 29 countries. Ill returned travelers with a confirmed or probable diagnosis of ZIKV disease acquired in Africa, Asia and the Pacific seen between 1 January 2012 and 31 December 2016 are included, and the frequencies of demographic, trip, and diagnostic characteristics described. ZIKV was acquired in Asia (18), the Pacific (10) and Africa (1). For five countries (Indonesia, Philippines, Thailand, Vietnam, Cameroon), GeoSentinel patients were sentinel markers of recent Zika activity. Additionally, the first confirmed ZIKV infection acquired in Kiribati was reported to GeoSentinel (2015), and a probable case was reported from Timor Leste (April 2016), representing the only case known to date. Review of Zika situation updates from major international health authorities for country risk classifications shows heterogeneity in ZIKV country travel advisories. Conclusions Travelers are integral to the global spread of ZIKV, serving as sentinel markers of disease activity. Although GeoSentinel data are collected by specialized clinics and do not capture all imported cases, we show that surveillance of imported infections by returned travelers augments local surveillance system data regarding ZIKV epidemiology and can assist with risk categorization by international authorities. However, travel advisories are variable due to risk uncertainties."

The aim of the study was to identify the prevalence of the NCD risk factors and the association of NCD risk factors with socio-demographic factors among the adults of urban slums in Dhaka, Bangladesh.A cross-sectional study was conducted among adult slum dwellers (aged 25 and above) residing in three purposively selected urban slums of Dhaka for at least six months preceding the survey. The risk factors assessed were- currently smoking, fruit and vegetable intake, physical activity, hypertension and body mass index (BMI). Information on self-reported diabetes was also taken. A total of 507 participants (252 females; 49.7%) were interviewed and their physical measures were taken using the WHO NCD STEPS instrument.The overall prevalence of NCD risk factors was: 36.0% (95% CI: 31.82-40.41) for smoking; 95.60% (95% CI: 93.60-97.40) for insufficient fruit and vegetable intake; 15.30% (95% CI:12.12-18.71) for low physical activity;13.70% (95% CI: 10.71-16.92) for hypertension; 22.70% (95% CI: 19.31-26.02) for overweight or obesity; and 5.00% (95%: 3.20-7.00) for self-reported diabetes. In the logistic regression model, the clustering of three or more NCD risk factors was positively associated with younger age groups (p = 0.02), no formal education (p <0.001) and primary education level (p = 0.01), but did not differ by sex of the participants, monthly income and occupation.All NCD risk factors are markedly high among the urban slum adults. These findings are important to support the formulation and implementation of NCD-related polices and plan of actions that recognize urban slum populations in Bangladesh as a priority sub-population."

It is one of the causative agents of gray leaf spot disease in tomato and pepper. The aim of this work was to characterize the mitochondrial genome of S. lycopersici CIDEFI-216, to use it to trace taxonomic relationships with other fungal taxa and to get insights into the evolutionary history of this phytopathogen. The complete mitochondrial genome was assembled into a circular double-stranded DNA molecule of 75,911 bp that harbors a set of 37 protein-coding genes, 2 rRNA genes (rns and rnl) and 28 tRNA genes, which are transcribed from both sense and antisense strands. Remarkably, its gene repertoire lacks both atp8 and atp9, contains a free-standing gene for the ribosomal protein S3 (rps3) and includes 13 genes with homing endonuclease domains that are mostly located within its 15 group I introns. Strikingly, subunits 1 and 2 of cytochrome oxidase are encoded by a single continuous open reading frame (ORF). A comparative mitogenomic analysis revealed the large extent of structural rearrangements among representatives of Pleosporales, showing the plasticity of their mitochondrial genomes. Finally, an exhaustive phylogenetic analysis of the subphylum Pezizomycotina based on mitochondrial data reconstructed their relationships in concordance with several studies based on nuclear data. This is the first report of a mitochondrial genome belonging to a representative of the family Pleosporaceae."
https://openalex.org/W2764062536,"Insulin resistance and inflammation in adipose tissue is a key mechanism underlying metabolic syndrome, a growing health problem characterized by diabetes, obesity and hypertension. Previous work from our research group has demonstrated the potential of egg white ovotransferrin derived bioactive peptides against hypertension, oxidative stress and inflammation in vitro and in vivo. Egg white hydrolysate (EWH) has also shown anti-hypertensive effects in spontaneously hypertensive rats. Given the interplay among hypertension, inflammation, oxidative stress and metabolic syndrome, the objective of the study was to test the EWH on differentiation, insulin signaling and inflammatory responses in 3T3-F442A pre-adipocytes. Our study suggested that EWH could promote adipocyte differentiation as shown by increased lipid accumulation, increased release of adiponectin and upregulation of peroxisome proliferator associated receptor gamma (PPARγ) and CCAAT/ enhancer binding protein alpha (C/EBP-α). In addition to enhanced insulin effects on the upregulation of protein kinase B/Akt phosphorylation, EWH treatment increased extracellular signal regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) phosphorylation to a level similar to that of insulin, indicating insulin sensitizing and mimetic properties of the EWH. EWH further attenuated cytokine induced inflammatory marker; cyclooxygenase -2 (COX-2) by 48.78%, possibly through the AP-1 pathway by down regulating c-Jun phosphorylation in adipocytes. Given the critical role of adipose in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome, EWH may have potential applications in the prevention and management of metabolic syndrome and its complications."
https://openalex.org/W2763587891,"In green algae, light-harvesting complex stress-related 3 (LHCSR3) is responsible for the pH-dependent dissipation of absorbed light energy, a function vital for survival under high-light conditions. LHCSR3 binds the photosystem II and light-harvesting complex II (PSII–LHCII) supercomplex and transforms it into an energy-dissipative form under acidic conditions, but the molecular mechanism remains unclear. Here we show that in the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, LHCSR3 modulates the excitation energy flow and dissipates the excitation energy within the light-harvesting complexes of the PSII supercomplex. Using fluorescence decay–associated spectra analysis, we found that, when the PSII supercomplex is associated with LHCSR3 under high-light conditions, excitation energy transfer from light-harvesting complexes to chlorophyll-binding protein CP43 is selectively inhibited compared with that to CP47, preventing excess excitation energy from overloading the reaction center. By analyzing femtosecond up-conversion fluorescence kinetics, we further found that pH- and LHCSR3-dependent quenching of the PSII—LHCII–LHCSR3 supercomplex is accompanied by a fluorescence emission centered at 684 nm, with a decay time constant of 18.6 ps, which is equivalent to the rise time constant of the lutein radical cation generated within a chlorophyll–lutein heterodimer.

Those findings demonstrate that rLHCSR3 is not only a pH sensor but also a conductor of charge transfer quenching and/or excitation energy quenching (21Bonente G. Ballottari M. Truong T.B.

In addition, aggregation of rLHCSR3 enhances the quenching process of rLHCSR3, indicating that protein–protein interactions inducing conformational changes might facilitate the quenching of LHCSR3 in vivo (34Ballottari M.

Indeed, an in vivo study using a fluorescence lifetime snapshot technique revealed that a fluorescence lifetime component of 65 ps was accompanied by qE, whose lifetime was faster than that observed in rLHCSR3 (36Amarnath K. Zaks J. Park S.D. Niyogi K.K. Fleming G.R. Fluorescence lifetime snapshots reveal two rapidly reversible mechanisms of photoprotection in live cells of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2012; 109: 8405-8410Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Hence, it is important to study in situ LHCSR3 interacting with other photosynthetic proteins. Although investigating the localization of LHCSR3 found that LHCSR3 binds to the PSII supercomplex and transforms it into its energy dissipative form (37Tokutsu R. Minagawa J. Energy-dissipative supercomplex of photosystem II associated with LHCSR3 in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2013; 110: 10016-10021Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), the mechanism how LHCSR3 dissipates the excitation energy of PSII, however, remains to be clarified. In particular, the fast time domain (<50 ps) has not been fully studied by the fluorescence lifetime analysis. To investigate how LHCSR3 dissipates excitation energy, thereby protecting the PSII supercomplex, we applied fluorescence decay–associated spectra (FDAS) analysis to a purified PSII–LHCII supercomplex with and without LHCSR3 from Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. FDAS analysis is a versatile method to examine excitation energy dynamics within pigment complexes such as photosystem complexes (38Yokono M. Nagao R. Tomo T. Akimoto S.

Here, the FDAS at 77 K revealed that when LHCSR3 binds to the PSII supercomplex, excitation energy transfer from LHCs to CP43 is redirected to CP47. LHCSR3-dependent quenching within the LHCs of the PSII supercomplex is also observed under acidic conditions. We then determined the decay time constant of the quenching by femtosecond up-conversion fluorescence spectroscopy so that we could infer the identity of the quencher. Finally, we proposed a model for the energy dissipation process within the PSII—LHCII–LHCSR3 supercomplex in C. reinhardtii. To investigate energy transfer dynamics in PSII supercomplexes, we isolated PSII supercomplexes from low-light (LL) and high-light (HL) grown wild-type C. reinhardtii cells (Fig. 1). To induce expression of LHCSR3, cells were cultured under 500 μmol of photons m−2 s−1 of white light, where LHCSR3, but not PsbS or LHCSR1 was dominantly accumulated (41Tibiletti T. Auroy P.

PSII supercomplexes were purified by sucrose density gradient (SDG) ultracentrifugation of the solubilized protein complexes as previously described in Ref. 37Tokutsu R. Minagawa J. Energy-dissipative supercomplex of photosystem II associated with LHCSR3 in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2013; 110: 10016-10021Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar. Fig. 1, A and B, respectively, show expression levels of LHCSR3 and separated green bands by SDG ultracentrifugation. In this study, we investigated the PSII supercomplex bands from LL and HL grown cells (PSII-LL and PSII-HL, respectively), which have been identified as dominantly PSII–LHCII and PSII—LHCII–LHCSR3, respectively (37Tokutsu R. Minagawa J. Energy-dissipative supercomplex of photosystem II associated with LHCSR3 in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2013; 110: 10016-10021Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). In absorption spectra at 77 K, the Qx- and Qy-band region from 600 to 700 nm is almost identical for PSII-LL and PSII-HL (Fig. 1C), which indicates that the S1 energy levels of chlorophylls are analogous in both forms. In fluorescence emission spectra at 77 K (Fig. 1D and supplemental Fig. S1), both PSII-LL and PSII-HL show maximum peaks at 685 nm and shoulders at 680 and 695 nm, which are associated with the emissions from CP43, LHCII, and CP47, respectively. In addition, the purity of PSII supercomplexes against PSI was confirmed by absence of the PSI fluorescence emission peak in the 720–740-nm region. The ratio of the PSII—LHCII–LHCSR3 supercomplex to the PSII–LHCII supercomplex in the PSII-HL preparation has been estimated to ∼0.28 by autoradiography as described in a previous study (37Tokutsu R. Minagawa J. Energy-dissipative supercomplex of photosystem II associated with LHCSR3 in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

The global fitting analysis of the time-resolved fluorescence curves shows a series of spectra corresponding to individual lifetime components (Fig. 2). Four lifetime components (25–40 ps, 0.2 ns, 0.9 ns, and 4.7 ns) were required for fitting in the 0–10 ns range, as with PSII supercomplexes from other organisms (38Yokono M. Nagao R. Tomo T.

Acta. 2006; 1757: 1657-1668Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The fluorescence from the primary donor (P680) appears at 682–683 nm, but was negligible in the fluorescence from the PSII supercomplex at 77 K due to its relatively low quantum yield (49Mimuro M. Akimoto S. Tomo T. Yokono M. Miyashita H. Tsuchiya T. Delayed fluorescence observed in the nanosecond time region at 77 K originates directly from the photosystem II reaction center.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2007; 1767: 327-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In the first FDAS (25–40 ps), a positive peak appeared at 679 nm in all the complexes, reflecting the relaxation of LHCs excitation as its energy was transferred to other component(s) (Fig. 2). Negative peaks appeared at 684 and 689 nm in PSII-LL at pH 7.5, PSII-LL at pH 5.5, and PSII-HL at pH 7.5; the former peaks correspond to the energy transfer to CP43, the latter to CP47 (Fig. 2, A–C). Since the relative contribution of CP43 versus CP47, to which excitation energy is delivered, was higher for PSII-LL at pH 7.5 than it was for PSII-LL at pH 5.5, the excitation energy delivery to CP47 was promoted in the acidic environment (Fig. 2, A and B). Moreover, the shift of excitation energy delivery toward CP47 was more prominent in the presence of LHCSR3 (Fig. 2C). The most striking feature in this FDAS analysis is seen in PSII-HL at pH 5.5 (Fig. 2D). Under those conditions, when LHCSR3 was bound to the PSII supercomplex as well as activated by the protonation, negative peaks at 684 and 689 nm were significantly reduced, indicating that excitation energy localized on LHCII was barely transferred to the core complex (Fig. 2D). Instead, another positive peak emerged at 684 nm in addition to the one at 679 nm. This is important because such an unpaired positive spectral component like the component at 684 nm (Fig. 2D) indicates energy transfer to a non-fluorescent acceptor, namely, quenched. Thus, the excitation energy on this fluorescence component at 684 nm in PSII-HL was quenched at pH 5.5 rather than transferred to the core complex. The very minor negative peaks probably reflect the energy transfer to CP43 or CP47 in the populations that do not bind LHCSR3 (Fig. 2D). It should be noted that the fluorescence amplitude of a quenching component in this fast lifetime component could be larger than its relative population because the quenching component decays faster so it strongly emits fluorescence with the fast lifetime component. The quenching component (at 684 nm) had three noteworthy features. First, the excitation energy transfer to this quenching component was not detected in the FDAS analysis indicating that this energy transfer was faster than our system could measure (full width at half-maximum (FWHM) of instrumental response function (IRF) ∼ 75 ps). Second, the quenching occurred specifically within LHCs as revealed by its appearing in the first FDAS only, which reflects the relaxation of LHCs excitation. Third, the peak and decay time scale of the quenching component are analogous to previously reported features of LHCSR3, whose features are a fluorescence peak at 685 nm at 77 K and a pH-dependent quenching capability with a tens of picosecond time constant (21Bonente G.

https://openalex.org/W2760884089,"Background Chagas disease is a debilitating often fatal disease resulting from infection by the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi. Chagas disease is endemic in 21 countries of the Americas, and it is an emerging disease in other countries as a result of migration. Given the chronic nature of the infection where intracellular parasites persist for years, the diagnosis of T. cruzi by direct detection is difficult, whereas serologic tests though sensitive may yield false-positive results. The development of new rapid test based on the identification of soluble parasitic antigens in serum would be a real innovation in the diagnosis of Chagas disease. Methods To identify new soluble biomarkers that may improve diagnostic tests, we investigated the proteins secreted by T. cruzi using mass spectrometric analyses of conditioned culture media devoid of serum collected during the emergence of trypomastigotes from infected Vero cells. In addition, we compared the secretomes of two T. cruzi strains from DTU Tc VI (VD and CL Brener). Results Analysis of the secretome collected during the emergence of trypomastigotes from Vero cells led to the identification of 591 T. cruzi proteins. Three hundred sixty three proteins are common to both strains and most belong to different multigenic super families (i.e. TcS, GP63, MASP, and DGF1). Ultimately we have established a list of 94 secreted proteins, common to both DTU Tc VI strains that do not belong to members of multigene families. Conclusions This study provides the first comparative analysis of the secretomes from two distinct T. cruzi strains of DTU TcVI. This led us to identify a subset of common secreted proteins that could potentially serve as serum markers for T. cruzi infection. Their potential could now be evaluated, with specific antibodies using sera collected from patients and residents from endemic regions."

There is an ongoing debate about the physiological relevance of these stress-induced pHapo changes. Using proteomic analyses of expanding leaves of corn (Zea mays L.), we show that this transition in pHapo conveys functionality by (i) adjusting protein abundances and (ii) affecting the rheological properties of the cell wall. pHapo was monitored in planta via microscopy-based ratio imaging, and the leaf-proteomic response to the transient leaf apoplastic alkalinization was analyzed via ultra-high performance liquid chromatography–MS. This analysis identified 1459 proteins, of which 44 exhibited increased abundance specifically through the chloride-induced transient rise in pHapo. These elevated protein abundances did not directly arise from high tissue concentrations of Cl− or Na+ but were due to changes in the pHapo. Most of these proteins functioned in growth-relevant processes and in the synthesis of cell wall–building components such as arabinose. Measurements with a linear-variable differential transducer revealed that the transient alkalinization rigidified (i.e. stiffened) the cell wall during the onset of chloride salinity. A decrease in t-coumaric and t-ferulic acids indicates that the wall stiffening arises from cross-linkage to cell wall polymers. We conclude that the pH of the apoplast represents a dynamic factor that is mechanistically coupled to cellular responses to chloride stress. By hardening the wall, the increased pH abrogates wall loosening required for cell expansion and growth.

NSCaTE is lacking outside of L-type calcium channels, but the highly conserved C-terminal IQ motif extends to members of the sodium channel family, from Nav2 channels in the early branching single-celled eukaryotes before the split of animals and fungi, such as apusozoan, Thecamonas trahens, and Nav1 channels (18Liebeskind B.J.

Here, we show that Cav3 T-type channels possess high-affinity calmodulin binding at the “gating brake,” a helix–loop–helix motif located in the proximal I–II linker of known Cav3 T-type channels in the analogous position where accessory Cavβ subunits regulate Cav1 and Cav2 channel complexes (22Perez-Reyes E. Characterization of the gating brake in the I–II loop of CaV3 T-type calcium channels.Channels. 2010; 4: 453-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). This gating brake governs the low-voltage dependence of T-type channels, and its absence generates a “runaway gating” phenotype (23Vitko I. Bidaud I. Arias J.M. Mezghrani A. Lory P. Perez-Reyes E.

Mutations that alter the function of the Cav3.2 gating brake have been found in human patients with absence epilepsy (27Chen Y. Lu J. Pan H. Zhang Y. Wu H. Xu K. Liu X. Jiang Y. Bao X. Yao Z. Ding K.

CaM-binding sequences are variable, which can range from a striking likeness to the C-terminal IQ motif from L-type channels, as in the gating brake of the basal metazoan Trichoplax adherens, to diverse sequences that generate a nanomolar affinity for CaM binding in protostome invertebrates such as pond snail LCav3 and all human (Cav3.1, Cav3.2, and Cav3.3) channel isoforms. We demonstrate that CaM facilitates the formation of α-helices in gating brake sequences, can pre-associate with Cav3 T-type channels without calcium ions, and its binding involves structural conformational changes in both N- and C-terminal pairs of EF hands in CaM and the gating brake. Dialysis of CaM binding (CaMB) peptides, or co-expression of apo-CaM (CaM1234) generates a significant hyper-polarizing shift in voltage sensitivities and faster gating kinetics, consistent with the mutant phenotype of Cav3 T-type channels lacking a gating brake in the I–II linker. Cav3 T-type channels contribute to pacemaker rhythms, such as the conducting system of the heart (29Mesirca P. Torrente A.G. Mangoni M.E. T-type channels in the sino-atrial and atrioventricular pacemaker mechanism.Pflugers Arch. 2014; 466: 791-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) and low-threshold calcium potentials (also known as low-threshold spikes), that trigger rhythmic burst firing classically associated with thalamic neurons during non-rapid eye movement sleep and to the spike wave discharge during absence seizures (30Kim D.

Shin H.S. T-type Ca2+ channels in normal and abnormal brain functions.Physiol. Rev. 2013; 93: 961-992Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). There is also significant evidence for T-type currents participating in “low threshold” neurotransmitter release (32Carbone E. Calorio C. Vandael D.H. T-type channel-mediated neurotransmitter release.Pflugers Arch. 2014; 466: 677-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) and in the maintenance of vascular tone (33Kuo I.Y. Howitt L. Sandow S.L. McFarlane A. Hansen P.B. Hill C.E. Role of T-type channels in vasomotor function: team player or chameleon?.Pflugers Arch. 2014; 466: 767-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Cav3 T-type channels possess a significant “window current” that provides a small but continuous stream of calcium influx through a population of Cav3 T-type channels open at rest (34Dreyfus F.M. Tscherter A. Errington A.C. Renger J.J. Shin H.S. Uebele V.N. Crunelli V. Lambert R.C. Leresche N. Selective T-type calcium channel block in thalamic neurons reveals channel redundancy and physiological impact of I(T)window.J. Neurosci. 2010; 30: 99-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). This calcium, available through Cav3 T-type channels at rest, is modeled to contribute to cellular proliferation during organ development, to the aberrant proliferation in many cancers (35Gray L.S. Schiff D. Macdonald T.L. A model for the regulation of T-type Ca2+ channels in proliferation: roles in stem cells and cancer.Expert Rev. Anticancer Ther. 2013; 13: 589-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), and to the hypertrophied condition of the mammalian heart (36Cribbs L. T-type calcium channel expression and function in the diseased heart.Channels. 2010; 4: 447-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Classically, Cav3 T-type channels are mostly inactivated at rest, and their participation rate is steeply voltage-dependent (37Senatore A. Guan W. Spafford J.D. Cav3 T-type channels: regulators for gating, membrane expression, and cation selectivity.Pflugers Arch. 2014; 466: 645-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). CaM’s regulation of the voltage sensitivities of Cav3 T-type channels at the gating brake thus has dramatic consequences to the participation of Cav3 T-type channels in normal functions, as well as during development and disease. Full-length mammalian Cav3.1 channels were purified from Sf9 insect cells (38Walsh C.P. Davies A. Butcher A.J. Dolphin A.C. Kitmitto A.

Fig. 1A (left panel) shows a field of purified Cav3.1 (protein appears white) coupled to an electron dense (black) gold particle, indicating CaM is bound. Individual images illustrating different orientations of the single particles of Cav3.1 channels alone or calmodulin–gold alone and Cav3.1 channels in complex with calmodulin–gold are shown in montages of viewpoints on top, bottom, and middle panels, respectively, in Fig. 1A. The orientation of the channel in some images allows identification of the C terminus, a protruding, finger-like projection from the transmembrane domain of Cav3.1 as highlighted by an asterisk; a feature previously identified through single-particle electron microscopy 3-D reconstruction of Cav3.1 (38Walsh C.P. Davies A. Butcher A.J. Dolphin A.C. Kitmitto A. Three-dimensional structure of CaV3.1: comparison with the cardiac L-type voltage-gated calcium channel monomer architecture.J. Biol.

We confirmed the complexing of calmodulin with Cav3 T-type channels as co-immunoprecipitants in Western blottings (see Fig. 1B). CaM–GFP fusion proteins transfected and purified from HEK-293T cells and isolated on anti-GFP Sepharose beads were identified in the complex with HA-tagged Cav3.2 channels in Western blottings, labeled with anti-HA antibody, as an ∼259-kDa band (Fig. 1B, middle lane) in the presence of calcium ions (33.3 μm CaCl2). The co-immunoprecipitation of CaM–Cav3.2 channels failed in the absence of co-expressed HA-tagged Cav3.2 channels (Fig. 1B, left lane) or in the absence of CaM (Fig. 1B, right lane). Cav3 T-type channels lack the C-terminal IQ motif shared among other calcium channels (Cav1 and Cav2) and sodium (Nav1 and Nav2) channels (1Ben-Johny M. Dick I.E. Sang L. Limpitikul W.B. Kang P.W.

Because both EM and co-immunoprecipitation experiments indicated that CaM binds to full-length mammalian Cav3.1 and Cav3.2 channels, we therefore next sought to delineate the CaM-binding domain. A unique but ubiquitous feature in Cav3 T-type channels is a helix–loop–helix, gating brake motif (similar in structure to a region in fumarase enzyme) in the proximal I–II linker that is in the analogous position of β subunit binding to Cav1 and Cav2 calcium channels (25Arias-Olguín I.I. Vitko I. Fortuna M. Baumgart J.P. Sokolova S. Shumilin I.A. Van Deusen A. Soriano-García M. Gomora J.C. Perez-Reyes E.

It is within the second helix of the gating brake of the I–II cytoplasmic linker where we have found an analogous region to the C-terminal IQ motif, with nanomolar affinity binding to CaM (Fig. 2A). Sequence alignments of Cav3 T-type channels (Fig. 2B) indicated a predicted CaM-binding site (illustrated by red color gradient) in helix-2 of the gating brake of representative metazoan species from cnidarians to the three human Cav3.1, Cav3.2, and Cav3.3 channels. A CaM-binding site is also predicted in Cav3 T-type channels by the on-line tool, CaM Target Database (39Yap K.L. Kim J. Truong K. Sherman M. Yuan T. Ikura M. Calmodulin target database.J. Struct. Funct. Genomics. 2000; 1: 8-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). Predictions suggest that the gating brake sequence is cytoplasmic, and a helical wheel analysis indicates its amphipathic nature. The most basal multicellular organism with a Cav3 T-type channel is T. adherens (a placozoan) (40Smith C.L. Abdallah S. Wong Y.Y. Le P. Harracksingh A.N. Artinian L. Tamvacakis A.N. Rehder V. Reese T.S. Senatore A. Evolutionary insights into T-type Ca2+ channel structure, function, and ion selectivity from the Trichoplax adhaerens homologue.J. Gen. Physiol. 2017; 149: 483-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), which has a region spanning the gating brake that is unlike other gating brake sequences (Fig. 2C, blue bar) with a core 17 amino acids that resembles the C-terminal CaM-binding IQ motif of Cav1, Cav2, and Nav2 channels (Fig. 2, C and D, blue bars). The Cav3 T-type channel in the basal multicellular placozoan may represent a structural intermediate involving the positioning of the C-terminal IQ motif in the common ancestor to calcium channels and sodium channels to the proximal I–II linker, before a divergence and appearance of a gating brake helix–loop–helix motif shared among all other metazoan Cav3 T-type channels. Comparatively, the IQ motif of Cav1 L-type channels is mostly identical from microbial eukaryotes to human homologs (9Taiakina V. Boone A.N. Fux J. Senatore A. Weber-Adrian D. Guillemette J.G. Spafford J.D. The calmodulin-binding, short linear motif, NSCaTE is conserved in L-type channel ancestors of vertebrate Cav1.2 and Cav1.3 channels.PLoS One. 2013; 8: e61765Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), where the CaM-binding gating brake motif in Cav3 T-type channels is more divergent. The protein similarity of gating brake sequences between protostome invertebrate (e.g. pond snail LCav3) and among the human Cav3 isoforms is 71–76% (Fig. 2C, red bars). Differences in gating brake sequences may reflect a local adaptability of the gating brake among Cav3 T-type channels in different animals. 26-mer peptide sequences spanning the gating brake region were synthesized for snail LCav3 and human Cav3.1, Cav3.2, and Cav3.3 channels dubbed “Cav3 CaMB” peptides. In addition, a PGPGPG substituted Cav3.2 channel peptide (Cav3.2mut) was synthesized, which served as a negative control peptide in experiments (see yellow highlighted sequence in Fig. 2B). CaMB peptides promoted a gel-mobility shift with CaM in the presence of 0.1 mm CaCl2-containing solution and increasing molar ratios (0.5 to 4×) of snail LCav3 or human Cav3.1, Cav3.2, and Cav3.3 channel CaMB peptides (Fig. 3). Mutated Cav3.2 CaMB peptide (Cav3.2mut) with the PGPGPG substitution did not promote a gel-mobility shift with CaM (Fig. 3). Cav3.3 peptide has the weakest apparent interaction compared with other Cav3.1 and Cav3.2 peptides, which correlates with its weaker predicted binding affinity (Fig. 2B). Presence of urea attenuated the weakest interacting human Cav3.3 channels with CaM without affecting the higher affinity LCav3 gating brake peptide with CaM. Differential circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy of snail LCav3, human Cav3.2, and Cav3.3 gating brake peptides suggest that the peptides assume a more helical secondary structure upon co-incubation with CaM or with helix-stabilizing agent trifluoroethanol (TFE) (Fig. 4A). Helical propensity of peptides increases after titrating higher TFE concentrations from 10 to 50% (41Jasanoff A. Fersht A.R. Quantitative determination of helical propensities from trifluoroethanol titration curves.Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 2129-2135Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar, 42Sönnichsen F.D. Van Eyk J.E. Hodges R.S. Sykes B.D. Effect of trifluoroethanol on protein secondary structure: an NMR and CD study using a synthetic actin peptide.Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 8790-8798Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar). The apparent α-helical formation of LCav3 and Cav3.2 resembles the CD spectral signature with 10% TFE, whereas Cav3.3 resembles more the spectral signature with 25% TFE. Human Cav3.1 is unique among the gating brake peptides in appearing to assume an α-helical conformation when free in solution (without CaM or TFE) (Fig. 4A), and this can be explained by its high-native alanine content (Fig. 4B). Although the circular dichroism results are suggestive of induction of helical secondary structure in the peptide upon binding CaM, some of the observed ellipticity changes may be induced by tertiary structural changes, not secondary structural ones (43Gagné S.M. Tsuda S. Li M.X. Chandra M. Smillie L.B. Sykes B.D. Quantification of the calcium-induced secondary structural changes in the regulatory domain of troponin-C.Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 1961-1974Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Mutated peptide (Cav3.2mut) has no α-helical propensity as predicted due to its proline substitutions (Fig. 4, A and B). CaM binds Cav3 CaMB peptides in 0.5 mm CaCl2 solution with a 1:1 stoichiometry, at nanomolar affinities that vary from 12, 43, 187, and 383 nm for snail LCav3, Cav3.1, Cav3.2, and Cav3.3 CaMB peptides, respectively (representative data in Fig. 5 and table of parameters in Fig. 6A). The rank order of measured binding affinities determined in the isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) (Fig. 6A) is consistent with the rank order of concentration of CaMB peptide to CaM ratio required for a saturating gel-mobility shift, 1.0, 1.5, 1.5, and >4.0× for snail LCav3, Cav3.1, Cav3.2, and Cav3.3 CaMB peptides, respectively (Fig. 3). The Cav3.3 CaMB peptide possessed the weakest CaM-binding site of all isoforms as evidenced by the lowest measured affinity with ITC and incomplete gel shift of CaM in native PAGE (Fig. 3). Besides their variable sequence and binding affinity differences for CaM, the Cav3 CaMB peptides vary in their thermodynamic properties during their association with CaM. The association appears to be entropy-driven for LCav3, LCav3.1, and Cav3.3 peptides and enthalpy-driven for Cav3.2 peptide, as illustrated by the latter’s negative enthalpy (exothermic) (Figure 5, Figure 6A).Figure 6ITC and NMR analyses indicate high-affinity, nanomolar binding, and associated conformation changes, respectively, upon Cav3 T-type channel CaM-binding peptides to N- and C-terminal lobes of CaM.

We demonstrate that E2F1 mRNA stability and E2F1 protein levels are reduced in cells lacking RALY expression.

We recently reported that the lipopolysaccharide O-antigen of Burkholderia enhances the initial colonization of the midgut of the bean bug, Riptortus pedestris. However, the midgut-colonizing Burkholderia symbionts lack the O-antigen but display the core oligosaccharide on the cell surface. In this study, we investigated the role of the core oligosaccharide, which directly interacts with the host midgut, in the Riptortus–Burkholderia symbiosis. To this end, we generated the core oligosaccharide mutant strains, ΔwabS, ΔwabO, ΔwaaF, and ΔwaaC, and determined the chemical structures of their oligosaccharides, which exhibited different compositions. The symbiotic properties of these mutant strains were compared with those of the wild-type and O-antigen–deficient ΔwbiG strains. Upon introduction into Riptortus via the oral route, the core oligosaccharide mutant strains exhibited different rates of colonization of the insect midgut. The symbiont titers in fifth-instar insects revealed significantly reduced population sizes of the inner core oligosaccharide mutant strains ΔwaaF and ΔwaaC. These two strains also negatively affected host growth rate and fitness. Furthermore, R. pedestris individuals colonized with the ΔwaaF and ΔwaaC strains were vulnerable to septic bacterial challenge, similar to insects without a Burkholderia symbiont.

https://openalex.org/W2760257555,"Defects in translocation of the glucose transporter GLUT4 are associated with peripheral insulin resistance, preclinical diabetes, and progression to type 2 diabetes. GLUT4 recruitment to the plasma membrane of skeletal muscle cells requires F-actin remodeling. Insulin signaling in muscle requires p21-activated kinase-1 (PAK1), whose downstream signaling triggers actin remodeling, which promotes GLUT4 vesicle translocation and glucose uptake into skeletal muscle cells. Actin remodeling is a cyclic process, and although PAK1 is known to initiate changes to the cortical actin-binding protein cofilin to stimulate the depolymerizing arm of the cycle, how PAK1 might trigger the polymerizing arm of the cycle remains unresolved. Toward this, we investigated whether PAK1 contributes to the mechanisms involving the actin-binding and -polymerizing proteins neural Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (N-WASP), cortactin, and ARP2/3 subunits. We found that the actin-polymerizing ARP2/3 subunit p41ARC is a PAK1 substrate in skeletal muscle cells. Moreover, co-immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that insulin stimulates p41ARC phosphorylation and increases its association with N-WASP coordinately with the associations of N-WASP with cortactin and actin. Importantly, all of these associations were ablated by the PAK inhibitor IPA3, suggesting that PAK1 activation lies upstream of these actin-polymerizing complexes. Using the N-WASP inhibitor wiskostatin, we further demonstrated that N-WASP is required for localized F-actin polymerization, GLUT4 vesicle translocation, and glucose uptake. These results expand the model of insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in skeletal muscle cells by implicating p41ARC as a new component of the insulin-signaling cascade and connecting PAK1 signaling to N-WASP-cortactin–mediated actin polymerization and GLUT4 vesicle translocation. Defects in translocation of the glucose transporter GLUT4 are associated with peripheral insulin resistance, preclinical diabetes, and progression to type 2 diabetes. GLUT4 recruitment to the plasma membrane of skeletal muscle cells requires F-actin remodeling. Insulin signaling in muscle requires p21-activated kinase-1 (PAK1), whose downstream signaling triggers actin remodeling, which promotes GLUT4 vesicle translocation and glucose uptake into skeletal muscle cells. Actin remodeling is a cyclic process, and although PAK1 is known to initiate changes to the cortical actin-binding protein cofilin to stimulate the depolymerizing arm of the cycle, how PAK1 might trigger the polymerizing arm of the cycle remains unresolved. Toward this, we investigated whether PAK1 contributes to the mechanisms involving the actin-binding and -polymerizing proteins neural Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (N-WASP), cortactin, and ARP2/3 subunits. We found that the actin-polymerizing ARP2/3 subunit p41ARC is a PAK1 substrate in skeletal muscle cells. Moreover, co-immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that insulin stimulates p41ARC phosphorylation and increases its association with N-WASP coordinately with the associations of N-WASP with cortactin and actin.

https://openalex.org/W2763751618,"There has been renewed interest in lactate as a risk biomarker in sepsis and septic shock. However, the ability of the odds ratio (OR) and change in the area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC-ROC) to assess biomarker added-value has been questioned.A sepsis cohort was identified from the ICU database of an Australian tertiary referral hospital using APACHE III diagnostic codes. Demographic information, APACHE III scores, 24-hour post-admission patient lactate levels, and hospital mortality were accessed.Hospital mortality was modelled using a base predictive logistic regression model and sequential addition of admission lactate, lactate clearance ([lactateadmission-lactatefinal]/lactateadmission), and area under the lactate-time curve (LTC). Added-value was assessed using lactate index OR; AUC-ROC difference (base-model versus lactate index addition); net (mortality) reclassification index (NRI; range -2 to +2); and net benefit (NB), the number of true positives per patient adjusted for the number of false positives. The data set comprised 717 patients with mean(SD) age and APACHE III score 61.1(16.5) years and 68.3(28.2) respectively; 59.2% were male. Admission lactate was 2.3(2.5) mmol/l; with lactate of ≥ 4 mmol/L (37% hospital mortality) in 17% and patients with lactate < 4 mmol/L having 18% hospital mortality. The admission base-model had an AUC-ROC = 0.81 with admission lactate OR = 1.127 (95%CI: 1.038, 1.224), AUC-ROC difference of 0.0032 (-0.0037, 0.01615; P = 0.61), and NRI 0.240(0.030, 0.464). The over-time model had an AUC-ROC = 0.86 with (i) clearance OR = 0.771, 95%CI: 0.578, 1.030; P = 0.08; AUC-ROC difference 0.001 (-0.003, 0.014; P = 0.78), and NRI 0.109(-0.193, 0.425) and (ii) LTC OR = 0.997, 95%CI: 0.989, 1.005, P = 0.49; AUC-ROC difference 0.004 (-0.002, 0.004; P = 0.34), and NRI 0.111(-0.222, 0.403). NB was not incremented by any lactate index.Lactate added-value assessment is dependent upon the performance of the underlying predictive model and should incorporate risk reclassification and net benefit measures."
https://openalex.org/W2763676809,"Osteoclasts are large multinucleated cells responsible for bone resorption. Excessive inflammatory activation of osteoclasts leads to bony erosions, which are the hallmark of several diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Salt-inducible kinases (SIK) constitute a subfamily of kinases comprising three members (SIK1, -2, and -3). Inhibition of SIK kinase activity induces an anti-inflammatory phenotype in macrophages. Since osteoclasts originate from precursors of macrophage origin, we hypothesized a role of SIK in osteoclastogenesis. We analyzed SIK1, -2 and -3 expression and function in osteoclast differentiation using the mouse macrophage cell line RAW264.7 and bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMM). We show that all three SIK are expressed in fully differentiated osteoclasts and that in BMM-derived osteoclasts there is an increased expression of SIK1 and SIK3 proteins. Interestingly, the pan-SIK inhibitor HG-9-91-01 significantly inhibited osteoclastogenesis by dose dependently reducing osteoclast differentiation markers (i.e. CathepsinK, MMP-9 and TRAP) and bone resorbing activity. Analysis of the signaling pathways activated by RANKL in RAW cells showed that SIK inhibitors did not affect RANKL-induced ERK1/2, JNK, p38 or NF-κB activation, but induced a significant downregulation in c-Fos and NFATc1 protein levels, the two main transcription factors involved in the regulation of osteoclast-specific genes. Moreover, SIK inhibition partially increased the proteasome-mediated degradation of c-Fos. SIK2 and SIK3 knockout RAW cells were generated by the CRISPR/Cas9 approach. SIK2 KO and, to a lesser extent, SIK3 KO recapitulated the effect of SIK small molecule inhibitor, thus confirming the specificity of the effect of SIK inhibition on the reduction of osteoclastogenesis. Overall, our results support the notion that the SIK signaling pathway plays a significant role among the check-points controlling osteoclastogenesis. SIK kinase inhibitors could thus represent a potential novel therapy to prevent bone erosions."

The probability is formulated by firm interaction between the pair of firms; it is proportional to the product of α-th power of the size of the first bankrupt firm and β-th power of that of the chain-reaction bankrupt firm. We confirm that α is positive and β is negative throughout the observing period, meaning that the probability of cascading failure is higher between a larger first bankrupt firm and smaller trading firm. We additionally introduce a numerical model simulating the whole ecosystem of firms and show that the interaction kernel is a key factor to express complexities of spreading bankruptcy risks on real ecosystems."
https://openalex.org/W2762047340,"Evolution and dispersion history on Earth of organisms can best be studied through biological markers in molecular epidemiological studies. The biological diversity of the cestode Echinococcus multilocularis was investigated in different cladistic approaches. First the morphological aspects were explored in connection with its ecology. More recently, molecular aspects were investigated to better understand the nature of the variations observed among isolates. The study of the tandemly repeated multilocus microsatellite EmsB allowed us to attain a high genetic diversity level where other classic markers have failed. Since 2006, EmsB data have been collected on specimens from various endemic foci of the parasite in Europe (in historic and newly endemic areas), Asia (China, Japan and Kyrgyzstan), and North America (Canada and Alaska). Biological data on the isolates and metadata were also recorded (e.g. host, geographical location, EmsB analysis, citation in the literature). In order to make available the data set of 1,166 isolates from classic and aberrant domestic and wild animal hosts (larval lesions and adult worms) and from human origin, an open web access interface, developed in PHP, and connected to a PostgreSQL database, was developed in the EmsB Website for the Echinococcus Typing (EWET) project. It allows researchers to access data collection, perform genetic analyses online (e.g. defining the genetic distance between their own samples and the samples in the database), consult distribution maps of EmsB profiles, and record and share their new EmsB genotyping data. In order to standardize the EmsB analyses performed in the different laboratories throughout the world, a calibrator was developed. The final aim of this project was to gather and arrange available data to permit to better understand the dispersion and transmission patterns of the parasite among definitive and intermediate hosts, in order to organize control strategies on the ground."

Chk1 is activated upon phosphorylation by the upstream kinase ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related protein (ATR) when the cell senses DNA damage from various agents (2Sanchez Y. Wong C. Thoma R.S.

Chk1 activity pauses the cell cycle at the G2/M checkpoint and induces DNA damage repair, most canonically through phosphorylation of the CDC25 family phosphatases, inhibiting them and preventing activation of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) (4Zhang Y. Hunter T. Roles of Chk1 in cell biology and cancer therapy.Int. J. Cancer. 2014; 134: 1013-1023Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Chk1 also phosphorylates and activates Wee1 kinase, whose activity in turn inhibits CDK1 and pauses the cell cycle (5Lee J. Kumagai A. Dunphy W.G. Positive regulation of Wee1 by Chk1 and 14-3-3 proteins.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 551-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Because rapidly dividing cancer cells are more reliant on the ATR/Chk1 pathway for survival than surrounding cells, these kinases have long been potential therapeutic targets in cancer alongside traditional chemotherapies or radiotherapies (to prevent repair of DNA damage in these cells), or as a monotherapy to induce replicative stress through duplication of damaged DNA (6Garrett M.D. Collins I.

Cell. 2004; 15: 1680-1689Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), suggesting that the human Chk1 KA1 domain may act as an autoinhibitory domain as recently described for MARK1 (16Emptage R.P.

Recent in vivo FRET experiments indicate that the N and C termini of Chk1 separate following DNA damage or in response to particular KA1 domain mutants (19Han X. Tang J. Wang J. Ren F. Zheng J. Gragg M. Kiser P. Park P.S. Palczewski K. Yao X. Zhang Y. Conformational change of human checkpoint kinase 1 (Chk1) induced by DNA damage.J. Biol.

Among KA1 domains from Chk1 orthologs, variations of two sequence-conserved motifs denoted CM1 and CM2 have been noted that reside at the N and C termini of the KA1 domain, respectively (4Zhang Y.

Here, we report the preparation and X-ray crystal structure determination of recombinant Chk1 KA1 domain, revealing a strikingly similar fold to other structurally characterized KA1 domains. Kinetic and biophysical studies reveal a high-affinity intramolecular autoinhibitory interaction of the Chk1 kinase domain emanating from the KA1 domain. Extensive site-directed mutagenesis implicates CM1 and CM2 as playing a central role in autoinhibitory interactions, especially basic residues within these regions, pinpointing the likely interface of autoinhibition among all Chk1 orthologs and linking Chk1 autoinhibition to that previously described for MARK1 (16Emptage R.P. Lemmon M.A. Ferguson K.M. Molecular determinants of KA1 domain-mediated autoinhibition and phospholipid activation of MARK1 kinase.Biochem. J. 2017; 474: 385-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Intimate knowledge of the mechanism of KA1-mediated Chk1 autoinhibition may lead to novel strategies to modulate activity of this validated oncology target. A human Chk1 KA1 domain construct containing amino acids 377–476 was expressed in Escherichia coli, affinity-purified in 6 m guanidine HCl, and refolded. Optimized crystals originally obtained in 0.1 m sodium acetate, pH 4.5, and 2 m ammonium sulfate diffracted to 2.5 Å. After phasing by molecular replacement, the structure was refined to Rwork/Rfree values of 21.6/24.6%, respectively, with two molecules in the asymmetric unit (Table 1). The final model contained Met-377 to Ser-468 of chain A (Fig. 1A, bottom cyan), along with an additional N-terminal serine in chain B left over from TEV-cleavage of the polyhistidine tag. The model closely resembles other KA1 domain structures, with a four-stranded β-sheet flanked by two α-helices, along with a short N-terminal β-strand (Fig. 1, A, bottom cyan, and C). The CM1 and CM2 nuclear export and localization sequences reside at the N terminus of the domain (CM1) and the final turn-helix of the C terminus (CM2), respectively. Residues N-terminal to Met-377 may be unstructured, explaining our inability to crystallize KA1 constructs that included more of the N terminus. Overall, the crystal structure confirms that the Chk1 KA1 domain retains a similar fold to other structurally characterized KA1 domains despite sequence identity of 20.4% or less (Fig. 1C).Table 1Summary of crystallographic statisticsData collectionSpace groupP 3Unit cell (a, b, c (Å))76.8, 76.8, 31.8Wavelength (Å)1.0Resolution (Å)50.0–2.5 (2.54–2.50)aValues in parentheses indicate highest-resolution shell.Rmerge0.097 (0.376)I/σ24.5 (3.6)Completeness (%)99.9 (97.8)Redundancy5.0 (4.7)No. of unique reflections7,313Refinement Rwork/Rfree (%)21.6/24.6 No. of atoms (average B factor (Å2)) Protein1449 (63.2) Water30 (64.9) Acetate, sulfate, glycerol30 (81.6) Ramachandran plot (%) Favored95.7 Allowed4.3 Root mean square deviation Bond length (Å)0.01 Bond angles (deg)0.74a Values in parentheses indicate highest-resolution shell.

Molecular determinants of KA1 domain-mediated autoinhibition and phospholipid activation of MARK1 kinase.Biochem. J. 2017; 474: 385-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), we assessed the activity of C-terminal domain variants to ask whether previous reports of increased kinase activity upon removal of the C terminus (14Chen P. Luo C. Deng Y. Ryan K. Register J. Margosiak S. Tempczyk-Russell A. Nguyen B. Myers P. Lundgren K. Kan C.C. O’Connor P.M.

The Chk1 variants were purified and assayed for kinase activity using a CDC25C-derived peptide substrate (Fig. 2A). Compared with the kinase domain alone, any construct that contained the KA1 domain, including linker region deletions (see domain architecture schematic, Fig. 1A), showed reduced activity by at least 40-fold. To confirm that this putative autoinhibitory interaction is intramolecular, sedimentation equilibrium-analytical ultracentrifugation (SE-AUC) was used to demonstrate that full-length, linker-deleted, or kinase domain Chk1 constructs behave as monomers in solution (Fig. 2B), with fitted molecular masses close to the expected values of 55.0, 46.8, and 32.6 kDa, respectively. Thus, as in previous studies of MARK1 (16Emptage R.P. Lemmon M.A. Ferguson K.M. Molecular determinants of KA1 domain-mediated autoinhibition and phospholipid activation of MARK1 kinase.Biochem. J. 2017; 474: 385-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), KA1-derived autoinhibition appears to occur within a single polypeptide chain. Given the preponderance of basic side chains within the KA1 domain resulting in a high predicted isoelectric point (pI of 9.84 compared with 6.41 for the kinase domain), we asked whether charge–charge interactions might play a role in KA1-mediated autoinhibition and compared the effect of increasing NaCl concentration on activity of full-length Chk1 or the isolated kinase domain (Fig. 2C). Whereas isolated kinase domain showed a steady activity decline with increasing ionic strength, possibly due to effects on substrate affinity, full-length Chk1 was activated to ∼125% initial activity at 300 mm NaCl before declining with a similar trend. We infer that this small initial stimulation of full-length Chk1 activity reflects disruption of intramolecular autoinhibitory KA1/kinase domain interactions, which partially overcome the general inhibitory effect of increased salt below 400 mm NaCl (Fig. 2C). This finding supports our suggestion that electrostatic interactions play an important role in intramolecular KA1-mediated autoinhibition of Chk1. If the KA1 domain mediates Chk1 autoinhibition by interacting directly with the kinase domain, we reasoned that we should be able to detect interaction between kinase (residues 1–277) and KA1 domains (residues 366–476) in an intermolecular context, as was recently observed in the case of MARK1 (16Emptage R.P. Lemmon M.A. Ferguson K.M. Molecular determinants of KA1 domain-mediated autoinhibition and phospholipid activation of MARK1 kinase.Biochem. J. 2017; 474: 385-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Consistent with this assertion, the kinase and KA1 domains were mixed and co-eluted off of a gel filtration column at a position consistent with formation of a stable KA1-kinase domain complex in solution (Fig. 3A). Furthermore, addition of the KA1 domain to the Chk1 kinase domain also enhanced its thermal stability by ∼12 °C as monitored by SYPRO Orange hydrophobic-interacting fluorescent dye, indicating binding and stabilization of the kinase domain by the KA1 domain (Fig. 3B). Moreover, SE-AUC sedimentation curves obtained when equimolar kinase and KA1 domain were mixed (at 4 and 8 μm) reported a single species sedimenting with a molecular mass of 45.0 kDa, which is close to the estimated heterodimeric molecular mass of 46.7 kDa (Fig. 3C). We confirmed that this increase in particle size was not due to KA1 domain oligomerization in SE-AUC studies of the KA1 domain alone, which sedimented as a 15.4-kDa monomer, comparable with the estimated molecular mass of 14.1 kDa (Fig. 3C). These results suggest the formation of a stoichiometric complex between the Chk1 kinase and KA1 domains. The fact that near complete heterodimerization of the isolated Chk1 kinase and KA1 domains is observed at 4 and 8 μm in solution indicates that the Kd for their association is likely to be submicromolar. This finding argues that the Chk1 KA1-kinase domain interaction is at least 100-fold stronger than that observed for MARK1 (16Emptage R.P. Lemmon M.A. Ferguson K.M. Molecular determinants of KA1 domain-mediated autoinhibition and phospholipid activation of MARK1 kinase.Biochem. J. 2017; 474: 385-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), and likely underlies the particular importance of KA1-kinase interactions for regulation of Chk1. Given the estimated submicromolar Kd of the Chk1 KA1-kinase domain interaction, we reasoned that trans inhibition of the kinase domain would be much more efficient than seen with MARK1, where a KA1 domain concentration of 100 μm was required to halve activity of the 5 μm kinase domain (16Emptage R.P. Lemmon M.A. Ferguson K.M. Molecular determinants of KA1 domain-mediated autoinhibition and phospholipid activation of MARK1 kinase.Biochem. J. 2017; 474: 385-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Indeed, a KA1 domain construct including both CM1 and CM2 (366–476) was able to inhibit activity of the kinase domain when titrated into the Chk1 radioassay at concentrations below 1 μm (Fig. 4A, black data points). The inhibition profile was fit to calculate a Ki value of 0.29 ± 0.01 μm for a non-competitive model (15Wu J.X. Cheng Y.S. Wang J. Chen L. Ding M. Wu J.W. Structural insight into the mechanism of synergistic autoinhibition of SAD kinases.Nat. Commun. 2015; 6: 8953Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) with inclusion of a Hill coefficient. We propose that the fitted Hill coefficient of 3.08 ± 0.14 reflects nonspecific electrostatic interactions may partially contribute to KA1-mediated inhibition of the Chk1 kinase domain, as has been observed for small-molecule inhibitors (25Copeland R.A. Evaluation of enzyme inhibitors in drug discovery: a guide for medicinal chemists and pharmacologists.Methods Biochem. Anal. 2005; 46: 1-265PubMed Google Scholar). The analogous Ki calculated for the kinase–KA1 domain interaction of SAD-A was 20-fold higher than that of Chk1 (15Wu J.X. Cheng Y.S. Wang J. Chen L. Ding M. Wu J.W. Structural insight into the mechanism of synergistic autoinhibition of SAD kinases.Nat. Commun. 2015; 6: 8953Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), indicating that SAD-A, like many other CAMKL family members, may rely on additional regulatory elements aside from the KA1 domain. To assess specificity, we asked whether other KA1 domains could elicit the same effect and found that analogous KA1 domain constructs from Danio rerio Chk1 and Saccharomyces cerevisiae Chk1 also inhibited the human Chk1 kinase domain, although Ki values were 2- and 13-fold higher than human Chk1, respectively (Fig. 4A). By contrast, the human MARK1 KA1, which shares the same basic character as the Chk1 KA1 domain (pI of 9.1), failed to inhibit the Chk1 kinase domain significantly. The lack of significant inhibitory activity of the MARK1 KA1 domain (Fig. 4A, gray) indicates that sequence-specific requirements for autoinhibition exist that do not solely rely on charge. Indeed, previous studies have shown that a L449R mutation in the KA1 domain activates full-length Chk1 in vivo (9Wang J. Han X. Zhang Y. Autoregulatory mechanisms of phosphorylation of checkpoint kinase 1.Cancer Res. 2012; 72: 3786-3794Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 19Han X. Tang J. Wang J. Ren F. Zheng J. Gragg M. Kiser P. Park P.S. Palczewski K. Yao X. Zhang Y. Conformational change of human checkpoint kinase 1 (Chk1) induced by DNA damage.J. Biol. Chem. 2016; 291: 12951-12959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), implying that highly specific interactions play key roles in autoinhibition. We next asked whether the presumed disordered region at the N terminus of the KA1 domain plays a role in Chk1 autoinhibition, as is the case for SAD-A and MARK1 (15Wu J.X. Cheng Y.S. Wang J. Chen L. Ding M. Wu J.W. Structural insight into the mechanism of synergistic autoinhibition of SAD kinases.Nat. Commun. 2015; 6: 8953Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 16Emptage R.P. Lemmon M.A. Ferguson K.M. Molecular determinants of KA1 domain-mediated autoinhibition and phospholipid activation of MARK1 kinase.Biochem. J. 2017; 474: 385-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Titrating three different KA1 domain constructs into the assay containing residues 345–476, 366–476, and 377–476 (the crystallized construct, lacking a portion of CM1) resulted in Ki values of 0.12 ± 0.01, 0.13 ± 0.01, and 3.86 ± 0.39 μm, respectively (Fig. 4B). Although, all KA1 constructs were able to inhibit kinase activity in a dose-response fashion, the constructs that contained the entire CM1 (345–376 or 366–476) showed a nearly ∼30-fold increase in inhibition capacity (lower Ki value), indicating that this region is required for maximal KA1-mediated autoinhibition. Based on this result, peptides containing the entire CM1 region were synthesized and when titrated into the assay showed only minimal inhibition of the Chk1 kinase domain at concentrations of up to 1 mm (Fig. 4C). In contrast to Chk1, the interaction between Arabidopsis thaliana SOS2 and calcium sensor SOS3 is mediated primarily by a sequence N-terminal to the KA1 domain (26Sánchez-Barrena M.J. Fujii H. Angulo I. Martínez-Ripoll M. Zhu J.K. Albert A. The structure of the C-terminal domain of the protein kinase AtSOS2 bound to the calcium sensor AtSOS3.Mol. Cell. 2007; 26: 427-435Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). For murine SAD-A, the only structurally characterized kinase-KA1 domain interaction, an autoinhibitory sequence N-terminal to the KA1 domain was also shown to be the primary determinant of autoinhibition (15Wu J.X. Cheng Y.S. Wang J. Chen L. Ding M. Wu J.W. Structural insight into the mechanism of synergistic autoinhibition of SAD kinases.Nat. Commun. 2015; 6: 8953Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Clearly, the mode of KA1-mediated autoinhibition of Chk1 differs from that of SOS2 and SAD-A despite close structural homology (Fig. 1C). Interestingly, the inhibition profile of the 377–476 KA1 construct (lacking part of CM1) was fitted with a lower Hill coefficient of 1 compared with the other constructs (Fig. 4B), indicating that the CM1 region may be contributing to nonspecific electrostatic interactions, whereas other regions of the molecule may bestow sequence specificity on the KA1-kinase domain interaction. To determine whether specific conserved residues both outside and within CM1 and CM2 are involved in autoinhibition, we tested the trans inhibitory activity of a series of KA1 domain mutants. Point mutations were designed based on both sequence conservation and the crystal structure (Fig. 1) and assayed at various concentrations relative to the Chk1 kinase domain (Fig. 5C). Melting curves confirmed that each of these constructs were properly folded as they all displayed melting temperatures greater than 30 °C (Fig. 5A). Mutations at residues that contribute to the hydrophobic core (Phe-380, Phe-381, Ile-465, and Val-466) were the only variants that significantly reduced melting temperature (Fig. 5B). Although many of the KA1 variants exhibited an intermediate loss of inhibitory activity, four mutants covering eight positions of the KA1 domain (dashed lines), all within or near CM1 and CM2, clearly reduced KA1-mediated inhibition of Chk1 kinase domain activity (Fig. 5, C and D). Basic residues at Lys-375 and Arg-376 positions in CM1 are conserved among all Chk1 orthologs (Fig. 1B). The L449R variant has been shown to activate Chk1 in vivo and result in decreased FRET between the N and C terminus, likely due to loss of this physical autoinhibitory interaction (9Wang J. Han X. Zhang Y. Autoregulatory mechanisms of phosphorylation of checkpoint kinase 1.Cancer Res. 2012; 72: 3786-3794Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 19Han X. Tang J. Wang J. Ren F. Zheng J.

Chem. 2016; 291: 12951-12959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Our in vitro results corroborate this finding, because the CM2 L449R mutation alone can reduce trans inhibitory activity of the KA1 domain (Fig. 5C). Mutation of conserved or partially conserved basic residues of CM2, or just outside this motif, positioned on the C-terminal helix (Lys-452, Arg-453, Lys-457, Lys-459, and Lys-461) also reduced inhibitory activity of the KA1 domain significantly (Fig. 5D). Despite lack of sequence identity (<20%), placement of these residues within the Chk1 KA1 domain structure closely mirrors that of the MARK1 KA1 domain (16Emptage R.P. Lemmon M.A. Ferguson K.M.

https://openalex.org/W2763827454,"Significant increases in tree mortality due to drought-induced physiological stress have been documented worldwide. This trend is likely to continue with increased frequency and severity of extreme drought events in the future. Therefore, understanding the factors that influence variability in drought responses among trees will be critical to predicting ecosystem responses to climate change and developing effective management actions. In this study, we used hierarchical mixed-effects models to analyze drought responses of Pseudotsuga menziesii in 20 unmanaged forests stands across a broad range of environmental conditions in northeastern Washington, USA. We aimed to 1) identify the biotic and abiotic attributes most closely associated with the responses of individual trees to drought and 2) quantify the variability in drought responses at different spatial scales. We found that growth rates and competition for resources significantly affected resistance to a severe drought event in 2001: slow-growing trees and trees growing in subordinate canopy positions and/or with more neighbors suffered greater declines in radial growth during the drought event. In contrast, the ability of a tree to return to normal growth when climatic conditions improved (resilience) was unaffected by competition or relative growth rates. Drought responses were significantly influenced by tree age: older trees were more resistant but less resilient than younger trees. Finally, we found differences between resistance and resilience in spatial scale: a significant proportion (approximately 50%) of the variability in drought resistance across the study area was at broad spatial scales (i.e. among different forest types), most likely due to differences in the total amount of precipitation received at different elevations; in contrast, variation in resilience was overwhelmingly (82%) at the level of individual trees within stands and there was no difference in drought resilience among forest types. Our results suggest that for Pseudotsuga menziesii resistance and resilience to drought are driven by different factors and vary at different spatial scales."
https://openalex.org/W2764057678,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the leading cause of cancer-related mortality in China, and the molecular mechanism of uncontrolled HCC progression remains to be explored. NK3 homeobox 1 (NKX3.1), an androgen-regulated prostate-specific transcription factor, suppresses tumors in prostate cancer, but its role in HCC is unknown, especially in hepatocellular carcinoma. In the present study, the differential expression analyses in HCC tissues and matched adjacent noncancerous liver tissues revealed that NKX3.1 is frequently down-regulated in human primary HCC tissues compared with matched adjacent noncancerous liver tissues. We also noted that NKX3.1 significantly inhibits proliferation and mobility of HCC cells both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, NKX3.1 overexpression resulted in cell cycle arrest at the G1/S phase via direct binding to the promoter of forkhead box O1 (FOXO1) and up-regulation of expression. Of note, FOXO1 silencing in NKX3.1-overexpressing cells reversed the inhibitory effects of NKX3.1 on HCC cell proliferation and invasion. Consistently, both FOXO1 and NKX3.1 were down-regulated in human HCC tissues, and their expression was significantly and positively correlated with each other. These results suggest that NKX3.1 functions as a tumor suppressor in HCC cells through directly up-regulating FOXO1 expression."

Along with Fasciola hepatica, F. gigantica incurs huge economic losses to the agricultural sector. Because of unavailability of an effective and commercial vaccine, the earliest diagnosis of the disease is the only way to control the disease. The conventional coprological techniques are able to detect the disease only after the parasites get matured and starts releasing their eggs with the faeces of host, therefore prepatent infection remain undiagnosed. The alternative method is by serological tests that uses circulatory antigens. Despite high sensitivity, their reliability is quite low because of the common antigens shared between different helminth parasites. To overcome this, investigation was shifted to identify the copro-antigens which could be more sensitive and reliable. In the present study, we tried to identify some of the immunodominant proteins from the Excretory Secretory (ES) product of F. gigantica which can be further characterized and used for early detection of infection and also as drug and vaccine candidates. The ES products of F. gigantica were collected and used for raising the polyclonal antibody in rabbit. The polypeptide profile was generated as well as immunogenic polypeptides were identified. The Source of ES antigen was immunolocalized using confocal microscopy and dot blot assay was performed to diagnose field infection. The polypeptide profile of ES products revealed a total of 24 polypeptides out of which 12 immunogenic polypeptides were identified by western blotting. Confocal micrographs showed the immunolocalization of antigens in the intestinal caecae, vitalline glands, gonads as well as in the tegument of the worm. The dot blot assay confirmed the utility of ES products for the detection of field infection. Subsequently, cross reactivity was found negative with Gigantocotyle explanatum; an amphitome parasite of same habitat. However, the cross reactivity with other helminths needs to be worked out."
https://openalex.org/W2761500998,"MdmX overexpression contributes to the development of cancer by inhibiting tumor suppressor p53. A switch in the alternative splicing of MdmX transcript, leading to the inclusion of exon 6, has been identified as the primary mechanism responsible for increased MdmX protein levels in human cancers, including melanoma. However, there are no approved drugs, which could translate these new findings into clinical applications. We analyzed the anti-melanoma activity of enoxacin, a fluoroquinolone antibiotic inhibiting the growth of some human cancers in vitro and in vivo by promoting miRNA maturation. We found that enoxacin inhibited the growth and viability of human melanoma cell lines much stronger than a structurally related fluoroquinolone ofloxacin, which only weakly modulates miRNA processing. A microarray analysis identified a set of miRNAs significantly dysregulated in enoxacin-treated A375 melanoma cells. They had the potential to target multiple signaling pathways required for cancer cell growth, among them the RNA splicing. Recent studies showed that interfering with cellular splicing machinery can result in MdmX downregulation in cancer cells. We, therefore, hypothesized that enoxacin could, by modulating miRNAs targeting splicing machinery, activate p53 in melanoma cells overexpressing MdmX. We found that enoxacin and ciprofloxacin, a related fluoroquinolone capable of promoting microRNA processing, but not ofloxacin, strongly activated wild type p53-dependent transcription in A375 melanoma without causing significant DNA damage. On the molecular level, the drugs promoted MdmX exon 6 skipping, leading to a dose-dependent downregulation of MdmX. Not only in melanoma, but also in MCF7 breast carcinoma and A2780 ovarian carcinoma cells overexpressing MdmX. Together, our results suggest that some clinically approved fluoroquinolones could potentially be repurposed as activators of p53 tumor suppressor in cancers overexpressing MdmX oncoprotein and that p53 activation might contribute to the previously reported activity of enoxacin towards human cancer cells."

However, much remains to be discovered regarding the molecular and cellular regulation of adiponectin release.

Validation of the model by introduction of data of secreted adiponectin yielded a very close resemblance between the simulations and experimental results. Moreover, we could show that Ca2+-dependent adiponectin endocytosis contributes to the measured capacitance signal, and we were able to predict the contribution of endocytosis to the measured exocytotic rate under different experimental conditions.

Contrary to the expectation that catalase and peroxidase activities should be mutually antagonistic, peroxidatic electron donors (PxEDs) enhance KatG catalase activity. Here, we establish the mechanism of synergistic cooperation between these activities. We show that at low pH values KatG can fully convert H2O2 to O2 and H2O only if a PxED is present in the reaction mixture. Stopped-flow spectroscopy results indicated rapid initial rates of H2O2 disproportionation slowing concomitantly with the accumulation of ferryl-like heme states. These states very slowly returned to resting (i.e. ferric) enzyme, indicating that they represented catalase-inactive intermediates. We also show that an active-site tryptophan, Trp-321, participates in off-pathway electron transfer. A W321F variant in which the proximal tryptophan was replaced with a non-oxidizable phenylalanine exhibited higher catalase activity and less accumulation of off-pathway heme intermediates. Finally, rapid freeze-quench EPR experiments indicated that both WT and W321F KatG produce the same methionine–tyrosine–tryptophan (MYW) cofactor radical intermediate at the earliest reaction time points and that Trp-321 is the preferred site of off-catalase protein oxidation in the native enzyme. Of note, PxEDs did not affect the formation of the MYW cofactor radical but could reduce non-productive protein-based radical species that accumulate during reaction with H2O2.

Satellite remote sensing (RS) can help overcome these limitations because it facilitates the collection of larger amounts of spatial data using cost-effective techniques. RS information is hence increasingly analysed to model biodiversity across space and time. Here, we focus on image texture measures as a proxy for spatial habitat heterogeneity, which has been recognized as an important determinant of species distributions and diversity. Using bee monitoring data of four years (2010–2013) from six 4 × 4 km field sites across Central Germany and a multimodel inference approach we test the ability of texture features derived from Landsat-TM imagery to model local pollinator biodiversity. Textures were shown to reflect patterns of bee diversity and species richness to some extent, with the first-order entropy texture and terrain roughness being the most relevant indicators. However, the texture measurements accounted for only 3–5% of up to 60% of the variability that was explained by our final models, although the results are largely consistent across different species groups (bumble bees, solitary bees). While our findings provide indications in support of the applicability of satellite imagery textures for modeling patterns of bee biodiversity, they are inconsistent with the high predictive power of texture metrics reported in previous studies for avian biodiversity. We assume that our texture data captured mainly heterogeneity resulting from landscape configuration, which might be functionally less important for wild bees than compositional diversity of plant communities. Our study also highlights the substantial variability among taxa in the applicability of texture metrics for modelling biodiversity."

Evans et al., is one of the main limiting factors of cocoa production in Latin America. Currently insufficient information on the biology and epidemiology of the pathogen limits the development of efficient management options to control MPR. This research aims to elucidate MPR development through the following daily microclimatic variables: minimum and maximum temperatures, wetness frequency, average temperature and relative humidity in the highly susceptible cacao clone Pound-7 (incidence = 86% 2008–2013 average). A total of 55 cohorts totaling 2,268 pods of 3–10 cm length, one to two months of age, were tagged weekly. Pods were assessed throughout their lifetime, every one or two weeks, and classified in 3 different categories: healthy, diseased with no sporulation, diseased with sporulating lesions. As a first step, we used Generalized Linear Mixed Models (GLMM) to determine with no a priori the period (when and for how long) each climatic variable was better related with the appearance of symptoms and sporulation. Then the significance of the candidate variables was tested in a complete GLMM. Daily average wetness frequency from day 14 to day 1, before tagging, and daily average maximum temperature from day 4 to day 21, after tagging, were the most explanatory variables of the symptoms appearance. The former was positively linked with the symptoms appearance when the latter exhibited a maximum at 30°C. The most important variables influencing sporulation were daily average minimum temperature from day 35 to day 58 and daily average maximum temperature from day 37 to day 48, both after tagging. Minimum temperature was negatively linked with the sporulation while maximum temperature was positively linked. Results indicated that the fungal microclimatic requirements vary from the early to the late cycle stages, possibly due to the pathogen’s long latent period. This information is valuable for development of new conceptual models for MPR and improvement of control methods."
https://openalex.org/W2762235800,"Electrocardiogram (ECG) data analysis is of great significance to the diagnosis of cardiovascular disease. ECG compression should be processed in real time, and the data should be based on lossless compression and have high predictability. In terms of the real time aspect, short-time Fourier transformation is applied to the processing of signal wave for reducing computational time. For the lossless compression requirement, wavelet-transformation that is a coding algorithm can be used to avoid loss of data. In practice, compression is required to avoid storing redundant recording data that are not useful in the diagnosis platform. The obtained data can be preprocessed to remove noise by using wavelet transform, and then a multi-objective optimize neural network model is used to extract feature information. Compared with the existing traditional methods such as direct data processing method and transform method, our proposed compression model has self-learning ability to achieve high data compression ratio at 1:19 without losing important ECG information and compromising quality. Upon testing, we demonstrated that the proposed ECG data compression method based on multi-objective optimization neural network is effective and efficient in clinical practice."

The genetic architectures of many species are always shaped by environmental constraints. Because little is known about the ecological and genetic traits of Tunisian whitefly populations, the main objective of this work is to highlight patterns of biodiversity, genetic structure and migration routes of this pest. We used nuclear microsatellite loci to analyze B. tabaci populations collected from various agricultural areas across the country and we determine their biotype status. Molecular data were subsequently interpreted in an ecological context supplied from a species distribution model to infer habitat suitability and hereafter the potential connection paths between sampling localities. An analysis of landscape resistance to B. tabaci genetic flow was thus applied to take into account habitat suitability, genetic relatedness and functional connectivity of habitats within a varied landscape matrix. We shed light on the occurrence of three geographically delineated genetic groups with high levels of genetic differentiation within each of them. Potential migration corridors of this pest were then established providing significant advances toward the understanding of genetic features and the dynamic dispersal of this pest. This study supports the hypothesis of a long-distance dispersal of B. tabaci followed by infrequent long-term isolations. The Inference of population sources and colonization routes is critical for the design and implementation of accurate management strategies against this pest."

We hypothesize that, due to the irreversible dilatation of the bronchi, the presence of secretions, and airflow obstruction, patients with non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis may be predisposed to hypoxemia during sleep, or to symptoms that may lead to arousal. A cross-sectional observational study was performed involving 49 patients with a clinical diagnosis of non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis (NCFB). All patients underwent clinical evaluation, spirometry, and polysomnography, and were evaluated for the presence of excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) and risk of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). The mean age of the participants was 50.3 ± 13.6 years; 51.1% of patients were male and had a mean body mass index of 23.8 ± 3.4 kg/m2. The mean total sleep time (TST) was 325.15 ± 64.22 min with a slight reduction in sleep efficiency (84.01 ± 29.2%). Regarding sleep stages, stage 1 sleep and REM sleep were abnormal. OSA was present in 40.82% of the patients. The mean arousal index was 5.6 ± 2.9/h and snoring was observed in 71.43% of the patients.

The survey assessed participants' (A) demographic and global health background, (B) perceptions regarding 66 barriers' seriousness, (C) detailed ratings of barriers designated most serious, (D) potential solutions.Thirty-four (of 66) barriers were seen as moderately or more serious, highlighting the widespread, significant challenges global health development faces. Perceived barrier seriousness differed significantly across domains: Resource Limitations mean = 2.47 (0-4 Likert scale), Priority Selection mean = 2.20, Corruption, Lack of Competence mean = 1.87, Social and Cultural Barriers mean = 1.68. Some system-level predictors showed significant but relatively limited relations. For instance, for Global Health Domain, HIV and Mental Health had higher levels of perceived Social and Cultural Barriers than other GH Domains. Individual-level global health experience predictors had small but significant effects, with seriousness of (a) Corruption, Lack of Competence, and (b) Priority Selection barriers positively correlated with respondents' level of LMIC-oriented (e.g., weeks/year spent in LMIC) but Academic Global Health Achievement (e.g., number of global health publications) negatively correlated with overall barrier seriousness.That comparatively few system-level predictors (e.g., Organization Type) were significant suggests these barriers may be relatively fundamental at the system-level. Individual-level and system-level effects do have policy implications; e.g., Priority Selection barriers were among the most serious, yet effects on seriousness of how LMIC-oriented a professional was versus level of academic global health achievement ran in opposite directions, suggesting increased discussion of priorities between LMIC-based and other professionals may be useful. It is hoped the 22 suggested solutions will provide useful ideas for addressing global health barriers."
https://openalex.org/W2762248397,"Glutamine synthetase is a ubiquitous central enzyme in nitrogen metabolism that is controlled by up to four regulatory mechanisms, including adenylylation of some or all of the twelve subunits by adenylyl transferase. It is considered a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of tuberculosis, being essential for the growth of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and is found extracellularly only in the pathogenic Mycobacterium strains. Human glutamine synthetase is not regulated by the adenylylation mechanism, so the adenylylated form of bacterial glutamine synthetase is of particular interest. Previously published reports show that, when M. tuberculosis glutamine synthetase is expressed in Escherichia coli, the E. coli adenylyl transferase does not optimally adenylylate the M. tuberculosis glutamine synthetase. Here, we demonstrate the production of soluble adenylylated M. tuberulosis glutamine synthetase in E. coli by the co-expression of M. tuberculosis glutamine synthetase and M. tuberculosis adenylyl transferase. The differential inhibition of adenylylated M. tuberulosis glutamine synthetase and deadenylylated M. tuberulosis glutamine synthetase by ATP based scaffold inhibitors are reported. Compounds selected on the basis of their enzyme inhibition were also shown to inhibit M. tuberculosis in the BACTEC 460TB™ assay as well as the intracellular inhibition of M. tuberculosis in a mouse bone-marrow derived macrophage assay."
https://openalex.org/W2762888163,"Background Prioritizing investments across health interventions is complicated by the nonlinear relationship between intervention coverage and epidemiological outcomes. It can be difficult for countries to know which interventions to prioritize for greatest epidemiological impact, particularly when budgets are uncertain. Methods We examined four case studies of HIV epidemics in diverse settings, each with different characteristics. These case studies were based on public data available for Belarus, Peru, Togo, and Myanmar. The Optima HIV model and software package was used to estimate the optimal distribution of resources across interventions associated with a range of budget envelopes. We constructed “investment staircases”, a useful tool for understanding investment priorities. These were used to estimate the best attainable cost-effectiveness of the response at each investment level. Findings We find that when budgets are very limited, the optimal HIV response consists of a smaller number of ‘core’ interventions. As budgets increase, those core interventions should first be scaled up, and then new interventions introduced. We estimate that the cost-effectiveness of HIV programming decreases as investment levels increase, but that the overall cost-effectiveness remains below GDP per capita. Significance It is important for HIV programming to respond effectively to the overall level of funding availability. The analytic tools presented here can help to guide program planners understand the most cost-effective HIV responses and plan for an uncertain future."
https://openalex.org/W2760949758,"To afford mechanistic studies in enzyme kinetics and protein folding in the microsecond time domain we have developed a continuous-flow microsecond time-scale mixing instrument with an unprecedented dead-time of 3.8 ± 0.3 μs. The instrument employs a micro-mixer with a mixing time of 2.7 μs integrated with a 30 mm long flow-cell of 109 μm optical path length constructed from two parallel sheets of silver foil; it produces ultraviolet-visible spectra that are linear in absorbance up to 3.5 with a spectral resolution of 0.4 nm. Each spectrum corresponds to a different reaction time determined by the distance from the mixer outlet, and by the fluid flow rate. The reaction progress is monitored in steps of 0.35 μs for a total duration of ~600 μs. As a proof of principle the instrument was used to study spontaneous protein refolding of pH-denatured cytochrome c. Three folding intermediates were determined: after a novel, extremely rapid initial phase with τ = 4.7 μs, presumably reflecting histidine re-binding to the iron, refolding proceeds with time constants of 83 μs and 345 μs to a coordinatively saturated low-spin iron form in quasi steady state. The time-resolution specifications of our spectrometer for the first time open up the general possibility for comparison of real data and molecular dynamics calculations of biomacromolecules on overlapping time scales."
https://openalex.org/W2763136523,"Classical dimensional analysis and nondimensionalization are assumed to be two similar approaches in the search for dimensionless groups. Both techniques, simplify the study of many problems. The first approach does not need to know the mathematical model, being sufficient a deep understanding of the physical phenomenon involved, while the second one begins with the governing equations and reduces them to their dimensionless form by simple mathematical manipulations. In this work, a formal protocol is proposed for applying the nondimensionalization process to ordinary differential equations, linear or not, leading to dimensionless normalized equations from which the resulting dimensionless groups have two inherent properties: In one hand, they are physically interpreted as balances between counteracting quantities in the problem, and on the other hand, they are of the order of magnitude unity. The solutions provided by nondimensionalization are more precise in every case than those from dimensional analysis, as it is illustrated by the applications studied in this work."
https://openalex.org/W2763490801,"Introduction Interpretation of the extent of perfusion deficits in stroke MRI is highly dependent on the method used for analyzing the perfusion-weighted signal intensity time-series after gadolinium injection. In this study, we introduce a new model-free standardized method of temporal similarity perfusion (TSP) mapping for perfusion deficit detection and test its ability and reliability in acute ischemia. Materials and methods Forty patients with an ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack were included. Two blinded readers compared real-time generated interactive maps and automatically generated TSP maps to traditional TTP/MTT maps for presence of perfusion deficits. Lesion volumes were compared for volumetric inter-rater reliability, spatial concordance between perfusion deficits and healthy tissue and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR). Results Perfusion deficits were correctly detected in all patients with acute ischemia. Inter-rater reliability was higher for TSP when compared to TTP/MTT maps and there was a high similarity between the lesion volumes depicted on TSP and TTP/MTT (r(18) = 0.73). The Pearson's correlation between lesions calculated on TSP and traditional maps was high (r(18) = 0.73, p<0.0003), however the effective CNR was greater for TSP compared to TTP (352.3 vs 283.5, t(19) = 2.6, p<0.03.) and MTT (228.3, t(19) = 2.8, p<0.03). Discussion TSP maps provide a reliable and robust model-free method for accurate perfusion deficit detection and improve lesion delineation compared to traditional methods. This simple method is also computationally faster and more easily automated than model-based methods. This method can potentially improve the speed and accuracy in perfusion deficit detection for acute stroke treatment and clinical trial inclusion decision-making."
https://openalex.org/W2761442443,"Background Although China has paid more attention on the prevention and control of tuberculosis (TB) in schools, several unsolved questions in this field still threaten the progress of TB control. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop a systematic and practical strategy for Chinese school TB prevention and control system. In this study, we aimed to assess the feasibility of a combined strategy named ESMPE (examination, screening, monitoring, prevention and education) that adhere to the basic principles of Chinese schools TB control strategy. Methods The ESMPE strategy included five sections, namely TB screening during physical examination for the school freshmen entrances, screening of close contacts, monitoring of high-risk schools, preventive treatment and TB education. The effectiveness of ESMPE strategy was evaluated from 2011 to 2016. The original data were provided by the Dalian Tuberculosis Hospital. Descriptive analysis and nonparametric tests were used for comparing statistical differences of results between different years. Results The detection rate of active pulmonary TB in school freshmen was decreased from 2011 to 2016 (χ2 = 41.941, P = 6.0551E-8). 97.22% (17,043/17,530) of close contacts experienced close contacts screening, and the secondary attack rate (SAR) of TB in schools fell by 146.35/105 from 2011 to 2012, and finally reduced to 85.57/105 in 2016. There was a significant correlation between SAR of student TB and the rate of screened close contacts (r = -0.924, P = 0.009). TB incidence of five monitored schools had a substantial decline after receiving monitoring, and this declining trend continued in 2016. Due to the TB education and advanced screening methods, the mean of diagnostic delay time in students with TB was shortened (15.71 days), while still fewer latent TB infection students received preventive treatment (30.38%). Conclusions The ESMPE strategy has shown a favorable effect on TB prevention and control in Dalian schools. More systematic evidence is needed on the effect of this strategy in reducing the incidence of TB in schools from other settings prior to its further scaling-up in China."
https://openalex.org/W2762022668,"In the present study, we address the important issue of whether B-cells protected from irradiation-induced cell death, may survive with elevated levels of DNA damage. If so, such cells would be at higher risk of gaining mutations and undergoing malignant transformation. We show that stimulation of B-cells with the TLR9 ligands CpG-oligodeoxynucleotides (CpG-ODN) prevents spontaneous and irradiation-induced death of normal peripheral blood B-cells, and of B-cells from patients diagnosed with Common variable immunodeficiency (CVID). The TLR9-mediated survival is enhanced by the vitamin A metabolite retinoic acid (RA). Importantly, neither stimulation of B-cells via TLR9 alone or with RA increases irradiation-induced DNA strand breaks and DNA damage responses such as activation of ATM and DNA-PKcs. We prove that elevated levels of γH2AX imposed by irradiation of stimulated B-cells is not due to induction of DNA double strand breaks, but merely reflects increased levels of total H2AX upon stimulation. Interestingly however, we unexpectedly find that TLR9 stimulation of B-cells induces low amounts of inactive p53, explained by transcriptional induction of TP53. Taken together, we show that enhanced survival of irradiated B-cells is not accompanied by elevated levels of DNA damage. Our results imply that TLR9-mediated activation of B-cells not only promotes cell survival, but may via p53 provide cells with a barrier against harmful consequences of enhanced activation and proliferation. As CVID-derived B-cells are more radiosensitive and prone to undergo apoptosis than normal B-cells, our data support treatment of CVID patients with CpG-ODN and RA."
https://openalex.org/W2763228499,"Limb muscles derive from pax3 expressing precursor cells that migrate from the hypaxial somite into the developing limb bud. Once there they begin to differentiate and express muscle determination genes such as MyoD. This process is regulated by a combination of inductive or inhibitory signals including Fgf18, retinoic acid, HGF, Notch and IGFs. IGFs are well known to affect late stages of muscle development and to promote both proliferation and differentiation. We examined their roles in early stage limb bud myogenesis using chicken embryos as an experimental model. Grafting beads soaked in purified recombinant IGF-I, IGF-II or small molecule inhibitors of specific signaling pathways into developing chick embryo limbs showed that both IGF-I and IGF-II induce expression of the early stage myogenic markers pax3 and MyoD as well as myogenin. Their effects on pax3 and MyoD expression were blocked by inhibitors of both the IGF type I receptor (picropodophyllotoxin, PPP) and MEK (U0126). The PI3K inhibitor LY294002 blocked IGF-II, but not IGF-I, induction of pax3 mRNA as well as the IGF-I, but not IGF-II, induction of MyoD mRNA. In addition SU5402, an FGFR/ VEGFR inhibitor, blocked the induction of MyoD by both IGFs but had no effect on pax3 induction, suggesting a role for FGF or VEGF signaling in their induction of MyoD. This was confirmed by in situ hybridization showing that FGF18, a known regulator of MyoD in limb myoblasts, was induced by IGF-I. In addition to their well-known effects on later stages of myogenesis via their induction of myogenin expression, both IGF-I and IGF-II induced pax3 and MyoD expression in developing chick embryos, indicating that they also regulate early stages of myogenesis. The data suggests that the IGFs may have slightly different effects on IGF1R signal transduction via PI3K and that their stimulatory effects on MyoD expression may be indirect, possibly via induction of FGF18 expression."
https://openalex.org/W2761247363,"This study aimed to assess the prevalence and incidence and predictive factors of thyroid disorders (TD) in patients with impaired glucose metabolism.Prevalence of TD was calculated in patients with impaired glucose metabolism compared to healthy controls, aged over 30 years in phase 1 of the Tehran Thyroid Study (TTS). Follow up assessments were conducted every 3 yrs, after which incidence of TD was calculated and its correlations with age, sex, smoking, blood pressure, body mass index (BMI), thyroid peroxidase antibody (TPOAb), thyrotropin (TSH), insulin resistance index, triglycerides and cholesterol were assessed.Incidence of TD among 435 diabetics, 286 prediabetics, and 989 healthy controls at baseline was 14, 18, and 21 per 1000 patients per year, respectively, being significantly lower in diabetics than that in healthy controls, a difference however that was not significant after adjusting for the variables mentioned (OR:0.64, 95% CI: 0.39-1.01). The incidence of TD in subjects with baseline serum TSH>1.94 mU/L or TPOAb≥40 IU/ml in all three groups was higher than that in patients with TSH≤1.94 mU/L or TPOAb<40 IU/ml, and remained significant after variable adjustment. Baseline TSH>1.94 mU/L was predictive of TD with 70% sensitivity and specificity. Baseline serum TSH (ROC area: 0.73, 95% CI: 0.68-0.77) had better predictive value than TPOAb (ROC area: 0.65, 95% CI: 0.61-0.69) for developing TD.Incidence of TD in type 2 diabetics or prediabetics is not higher than healthy controls. It is however necessary to conduct thyroid tests in patients with TPOAb≥40 IU/ml or TSH>1.94 mU/L."
https://openalex.org/W2762638765,"We describe a method to speed up microelectromechanical system (MEMS) mirror scanning by > 20x, while also improving scan accuracy. We use Landweber deconvolution to determine an input voltage which would produce a desired output, based on the measured MEMS impulse response. Since the MEMS is weakly nonlinear, the observed behavior deviates from expectations, and we iteratively improve our input to minimize this deviation. This allows customizable MEMS angle vs. time with <1% deviation from the desired scan pattern. We demonstrate our technique by optimizing a point scanning microscope's raster patterns to image mammal submandibular gland and pollen at ~10 frames/s."
https://openalex.org/W2762806768,"Previous research has studied the relationship between political ideology and cognitive biases, such as the tendency of conservatives to form stronger illusory correlations between negative infrequent behaviors and minority groups. We further explored these findings by studying the relation between illusory correlation and moral values. According to the moral foundations theory, liberals and conservatives differ in the relevance they concede to different moral dimensions: Care, Fairness, Loyalty, Authority, and Purity. Whereas liberals consistently endorse the Care and Fairness foundations more than the Loyalty, Authority and Purity foundations, conservatives tend to adhere to the five foundations alike. In the present study, a group of participants took part in a standard illusory correlation task in which they were presented with randomly ordered descriptions of either desirable or undesirable behaviors attributed to individuals belonging to numerically different majority and minority groups. Although the proportion of desirable and undesirable behaviors was the same in the two groups, participants attributed a higher frequency of undesirable behaviors to the minority group, thus showing the expected illusory correlation effect. Moreover, this effect was specifically associated to our participants’ scores in the Loyalty subscale of the Moral Foundations Questionnaire. These results emphasize the role of the Loyalty moral foundation in the formation of attitudes towards minorities among conservatives. Our study points out the moral system as a useful fine-grained framework to explore the complex interaction between basic cognitive processes and ideology."
https://openalex.org/W2763475645,"The adult height of children with early onset puberty is limited by the premature maturation of hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis. To evaluate the effects of gonadotropin-releasing hormone analog (GnRHa) treatment on the final height (FH) and bone maturation rate (BMR) in girls with early puberty (EP) or idiopathic central precocious puberty (ICPP), we examined data from girls who were diagnosed with EP or ICPP and underwent GnRHa (Leuplin Depot: 3.75 mg/month) at China Medical University Hospital, in Taiwan, between 2006 and 2015. Patients were observed until the achievement of FH and divided into an ""EP group"" (T-ep) and ""ICPP group"" (T-icpp) according to the age of onset of puberty. Eighty-seven patients were enrolled (T-ep, N = 44, puberty onset at 8-10 years; T-icpp, N = 43, puberty onset before 8 years). The demographic data of girls with EP or IPP was characterized. BMR, change in predicted final height (PFH) after GnRHa treatment, target height (TH) and FH were measured. After GnRHa treatment, the study groups (T-ep: 160.24±6.18 cm, T-icpp: 158.99±5.92 cm) both had higher PFH than at initiation (T-ep: 159.83±7.19 cm, T-icpp: 158.58±5.93 cm). There was deceleration of BMR in both groups (T-ep: 0.57±0.39; T-icpp: 0.97±0.97) and a significant difference between the groups (p = 0.027). The gap in FH standard deviation scores (SDS) and TH SDS had a significant difference in T-ep (p = 0.045) but not in T-icpp. Moreover, there was no difference in the gap of PFH SDS between the 1st and final treatment in both groups. We concluded that GnRHa decelerated BMR in girls with earlier puberty. Further prospective clinical studies are warranted."
https://openalex.org/W2763891779,"Purpose To identify sectors of the optical coherence tomography (OCT) macular map that could be used to effectively assess structural progression in patients with normal-tension glaucoma (NTG). Methods This study examined 117 eyes of 117 NTG patients to establish axonal tract-dependent macular sectors, and also examined a separate group of 122 eyes of 81 NTG patients to evaluate the ability of these sectors to reveal glaucoma progression. Longitudinal data, including macular maps from at least 5 OCT examinations performed over at least 2 years, was available for all patients in this group. Circumpapillary retinal nerve fiber layer thickness (cpRNFLT), temporal clockwise sector scans (from 7 to 11 o’clock), macular retinal nerve fiber layer thickness (mRNFLT), and macular ganglion cell layer plus inner plexiform layer thickness (mGCIPLT) were measured with spectral-domain OCT (3D OCT-2000, TOPCON). The axonal tract-dependent macular sectors were identified by calculating Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient for each point on a grid overlaid on the macular map and cpRNFLT in each clockwise scan sector. Trend and event analyses for the slope of progression in each sector and macular map were performed. Visual field progression in the macula was defined by the presence of more than 2 progressive test points in the 16 central test points of the Humphrey field analyzer SITA standard 24–2 program, evaluated with Progressor software. Results The slope of progression in the entire macular area was -0.22 ± 0.58 μm/year for mRNFLT and -0.35 ± 0.52 μm/year for mGCIPLT. The fastest-progressing mRNFLT sector (-1.00 ± 0.84 μm/year, p < 0.001) and mGCIPLT sector (-1.16 ± 0.63 μm/year, p < 0.001) progressed significantly faster than the overall macula. Classifying patients according to visual field progression showed that baseline mRNFLT in the inferior hemifield, 7 and 8 o’clock sectors, as well as baseline mGCIPLT in the overall macular map, inferior hemifield, and 8 o’clock sector, were significantly lower in progressors (22 eyes) than non-progressors (100 eyes). There were significant differences in mRNFLT slope in 8 o’clock sector and in the fastest progressing sector in progressors and non-progressors, but mGCIPLT did not differ, even in the fastest-progressing sector. Event analysis showed that progression occurred most frequently in inferior mRNFLT and superior mGCIPLT in this study. Conclusion Axonal tract-dependent OCT macular sectors could effectively reveal structural change in patients with NTG. Furthermore, mRNFLT slope was consistent with visual field progression. This method promises to open new avenues for the OCT-based evaluation of glaucoma progression."
https://openalex.org/W2762530619,"Introduction The level of minimal residual disease (MRD) in marrow predicts outcome and guides treatment in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) but accurate prediction depends on accurate measurement. Methods Forty-one children with ALL were studied at the end of induction. Two samples were obtained from each iliac spine and each sample was assayed twice. Assay, sample and side-to-side variation were quantified by analysis of variance and presumptively incorrect decisions related to high-risk disease were determined using the result from each MRD assay, the mean MRD in the patient as the measure of the true value, and each of 3 different MRD cut-off levels which have been used for making decisions on treatment. Results Variation between assays, samples and sides each differed significantly from zero and the overall standard deviation for a single MRD estimation was 0.60 logs. Multifocal residual disease seemed to be at least partly responsible for the variation between samples. Decision errors occurred at a frequency of 13–14% when the mean patient MRD was between 10−2 and 10−5. Decision errors were observed only for an MRD result within 1 log of the cut-off value used for assessing high risk. Depending on the cut-off used, 31–40% of MRD results were within 1 log of the cut-off value and 21–16% of such results would have resulted in a decision error. Conclusion When the result obtained for the level of MRD is within 1 log of the cut-off value used for making decisions, variation in the assay and/or sampling may result in a misleading assessment of the true level of marrow MRD. This may lead to an incorrect decision on treatment."
