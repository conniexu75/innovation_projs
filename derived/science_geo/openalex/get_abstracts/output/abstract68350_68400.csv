https://openalex.org/W1486292873,"Abstract The interaction of sodium dodecyl sulfate with a wide variety of proteins is characterized by a high binding ratio when the monomer concentration of amphiphile exceeds 5 x 10-4 m. This binding ratio on a gram to gram basis is identical for all proteins investigated. The protein portion of the complex contains a high degree of order, and hydrodynamic studies suggest that the complex is a rodlike particle, the length of which varies uniquely with the molecular weight of the protein moiety. These results explain the empirical observation that proteins dissolved in aqueous solutions containing high concentrations of sodium dodecyl sulfate have electrophoretic mobilities on polyacrylamide gels which are a unique function of their molecular weights. In addition, the data suggest a possible model for the conformation of membrane proteins and their interactions with phospholipid."
https://openalex.org/W1529099607,"Abstract Reduced proteins in aqueous solutions of 6 m guanidine hydrochloride or sodium dodecyl sulfate assume conformations such that the hydrodynamic shape varies predictably with molecular weight. Consequently, gel chromatography can be used to determine both effective hydrodynamic radii and molecular weights of polypeptide chains in these solvents. Data obtained with the same support media in the two different solvent systems suggest that gel chromatography can be used as a substitute for other hydrodynamic measurements in the determination of gross conformation of proteins in these solvents."

Nitrogen excretion in the urine, particularly ammonia, was increased in the pregnant group. Continuous glucose utilization by the conceptus may exaggerate and accelerate the metabolic consequences of starvation."

High prolactin activity, largely neutralizable with antiserum to human growth hormone, is stimulated along with high immunoassayable growth hormone by insulin-induced hypoglycemia. High prolactin activity, not neutralizable with antiserum to growth hormone, exists with low concentrations of plasma growth hormone in postpartum patients and patients with galactorrhea."

https://openalex.org/W2031331852,"Electroencephalographic averaged evoked responses to flashing lights of four different intensities were recorded in ten cats and correlated with behavior. Animals showing a high degree of exploratory behavior, aggressiveness, and activity and little withdrawal showed relatively large increases in amplitude of the averaged evoked response with increases of stimulus intensity. Those showing opposite behavioral traits had small increases or decreases of average evoked response amplitude with increases of stimulus intensity. These findings are compatible with those reported for human subjects. Inference is made about a neurophysiological mechanism for stimulus intensity modulation."

https://openalex.org/W1505813229,"Abstract NaBH4-reduced phosphorylase b is a catalytically active species which retains many of the properties of the native enzyme. One property that is strikingly different, however, is the spectral behavior of bound pyridoxal phosphate. At pH 7.0, the pyridoxal phosphate shows essentially no absorption at 333 nm, where pyridoxal phsophate in the native enzyme absorbs; absorption at 333 nm returns upon lowering the pH. The 333 nm band at low pH in the reduced enzyme was found to be optically active, (ΔA/A) 333 nm ≅ 0.7 x 10-3. Circular dichroism of the reduced phosphorylase b at pH 7.0 indicated that no new band was formed above 300 nm; the ultraviolet spectrum also provided no evidence for a band above 300 nm. Guanidine·HCl (4.25 m) and sodium dodecyl sulfate (0.3%) caused the appearance of a band near 330 nm at pH 6.8. Difference spectra of reduced phosphorylase b (±sodium dodecyl sulfate; pH 5 versus pH 7) indicated that the hidden band must be below 300 nm. AMP (0.01 m) was shown to cause partial reversal of the hidden band to 333 nm conversion at pH 6.0; ATP was also effective. Substrates and AMP had no effect on the spectrum of the reduced phosphorylase b at pH 6.8. Ultracentrifugal studies showed that native and NaBH4-reduced enzyme have different conformations. The data were interpreted to mean that the 333 nm and hidden band forms of NaBH4-reduced phosphorylase represent different enzyme conformations. The hidden band form is thought to represent a form of pyridoxal phosphate in which the pyridinium nitrogen is unprotonated and the 3-hydroxyl group undissociated or strongly hydrogen bonded; the 333 nm species is believed to be a dipolar form of pyridoxal phosphate which is exposed to solvent. Spectral properties of enzyme-bound pyridoxal phosphate in native phosphorylase were compared to NaBH4-reduced enzyme, and it was suggested that pyridoxal phosphate exists in these two forms at pH 7.0 in the same microscopic environment. Circular dichroism of native phosphorylase b at 422 nm was observed. The presence of phosphate (0.01 m) and AMP (0.001 m) did not perturb the observed long wave length circular dichroism. Solvent perturbation studies showed that enzyme-bound pyridoxal phosphate in native phosphorylase is not available to ethylene glycol. From our results, evaluation of model compound data, and fluorescence results, a new structure was proposed for the 333 nm form for native phosphorylase. This species is thought to be a neutral tautomeric imine of pyridoxal phosphate."

https://openalex.org/W1567603352,"Abstract A heteropolysaccharide-protein complex containing 70% sialic acid was isolated from the jelly coat of the eggs of the sea urchin, Pseudocentrotus depressus. The yield of this sialopolysaccharide-protein complex was 0.32% of the whole jelly powder. Purified by centrifugation and chromatography on Bio-Gel, the complex was found to be homogeneous by the criteria of electrophoresis and ultracentrifugation. Its sedimentation coefficient, s020 ,w, was 5.1, and the material carried a strong negative charge. The carbohydrate composition of the complex, expressed in percentages of the dry weight, was sialic acid, 70.0; fucose, 9.2; hexose, 3.7; and hexosamine, 2.4. Analyses for glycolic acid strongly indicated that all of the sialic acid occurred in glycolyl form. The molar ratio of sulfate to fucose was 1.42:1. The combined weights of monosaccharide, sulfate, and amino acid residues accounted for 96.0% of the complex weight. Thin layer chromatography of the sialopolysaccharide-protein complex after hydrolysis in mild acid showed five spots stained by Ehrlich's reagent. The major spot migrated as N-glycolylneuraminic acid. No indication of N-acetylneuraminic acid appeared. It is proposed that there are several new, undescribed neuraminic acids in the jelly coat, since the sialic acid yielded only 45% of the color in the reaction with thiobarbituric acid as compared with the direct Ehrlich assay and, moreover, no release of sialic acid from the complex by neuraminidase treatment was obtained."

https://openalex.org/W1517102034,"Abstract The gangliosides of two types of mouse cells in tissue culture, L-929 cells and secondary cultures of mouse embryo cells, have been investigated. Gangliosides were identified tentatively by comparison of the chromatographic behavior of the intact gangliosides and their products of hydrolysis in mild acid with standards of known composition. Monosialogangliosides predominated in L cells whereas the secondary cultures also contained more complex gangliosides. The calf serum used for culturing the cells contained gangliosides but the pattern differed from those of the two types of cells. Both L cell and secondary cultures incorporated significant amounts of 14C-glucosamine into all of their gangliosides. The 14C-glucosamine was found to be principally distributed in the galactosamine, N-acetyl-, and N-glycolylneuraminic acid moieties of the gangliosides. These latter results suggest that the gangliosides are synthesized—at least in part—by the cells de novo. In addition, mono-, di-, and triglycosylceramides were detected in the L cell cultures, whereas the secondary cultures contained mono-, di-, and tetraglycosylceramides."
https://openalex.org/W1500845524,"Optical rotatory dispersion (ORD), circular dichroism (CD), ultraviolet absorption, the fluorescence of troponin, tropomyosin, and relaxing protein were used as probes to detect structural changes resulting from the binding of troponin with tropomyosin to form a complex called relaxing protein. In the wave length region from 250 to 190 nm, ORD and CD spectra show that all the apparent band positions of the three proteins studied are similar to those reported for helical polypeptides. The helical contents estimated from ORD and CD troughs are 42, 97, and 72% for troponin, tropomyosin, and relaxing protein, respectively. In the ultraviolet region of the ORD and CD spectra, no change was observed in the secondary structure upon complexing troponin and tropomyosin. In addition, a stoichiometry of 1:1 by weight is indicated since a mixture of troponin and tropomyosin yielded a spectrum which superimposes on that observed for relaxing protein. On the other hand, the CD spectra in the aromatic region (300 to 250 nm) indicate that the aromatic chromophores of either troponin or tropomyosin are perturbed. From an over-all change in the band intensities and from the disappearance of the positive 295 nm band upon binding of troponin to tropomyosin, it is suggested that the environment of the aromatic chromophores has been significantly modified. A perturbation associated with the binding of troponin to tropomyosin was also detected in the absorption spectrum. No change in the ionization constants for the phenolic groups of the tyrosine residues was observed upon formation of the relaxing protein. On the other hand, a shift of the fluorescence emission maximum of relaxing protein during storage suggests that tryptophan residues are perturbed in relaxing protein. It is, therefore, concluded that the perturbation of the aromatic residues results from a change in tryptophan rather than in the tyrosine residue environment."

https://openalex.org/W1505245609,"The analysis is completed. Through a series of propositions and hypothesized links between the reporting of UFO sightings and a particular kind of social position, the utility of social theory as a basis for explaining phenomena presumed to be in the domain of the physical sciences has been demonstrated. Nothing in the data rejects the possibility that some individuals have, in fact, seen objects propelled from another solar system or that all observations are of ill-understood or misperceived terrestrial phenomena. Empirical science, particularly social science, does not address itself to ultimate truth. What has been attempted here is the employment of a sociological theory to account successfully for observed regularity in patterns of UFO sightings. Another and reasonable, though not necessarily mutually exclusive, procedure for organizing social data might provide an equal degree of explanatory consistency. This analysis merely emphasizes the need to utilize such approaches outside the confines of laboratory groups and the more convenient and established domains of social science. Our analysis has presented just one application of sociological theory to the complex interplay among quasi-scientific phenomena, physical science knowledge, and human behavior in society."

Denaturation, chromatography on carboxymethyl cellulose, measurement of molecular weight, and analyses of the amino acids of the cross-linked product indicate that most, if not all, of the collagen molecules consist of two alpha1 chains and one alpha2 chain [(alpha1)(2)(alpha2)(1)]."
https://openalex.org/W2030006417,"Negatively stained slime mold actomyosin examined by electron microscopy consists mainly of actin-like filaments with occasional angular projections. If some of the actin is removed, the myosin-enriched actomyosin appears as continuous arrowhead structures similar to those of vertebrate striated muscle actomyosin. Together with other evidence, the findings suggest that cytoplasmic streaming in Physarum may involve a contractile process operating at a relatively low myosin-actin ratio."
https://openalex.org/W1575467003,"Two sialic acids were isolated from the jelly coat of the eggs of the sea urchin Pseudocentrotus depressus. Both were subjected to chemical assay, thin layer chromatography, infrared absorption study, and enzymatic treatment. The results indicate that one of the sialic acids is identical with N-glycolylneuraminic acid. The other sialic acid is a completely new type and was deduced to be N-acetoglycolyl-4-methyl-4,9-dideoxy neuraminic acid from the following data. (a) Elemental analyses inferred an empirical formula of C14H23NO9. (b) From each mole of the isolated sialic acid, 2.14 moles of C-methyl, 1.14 moles of glycolyl, and 0.93 mole of acetyl group (0.87 mole of O-acetyl group) were derived. (c) Uptake of periodate was observed to be 2 moles per mole of the sialic acid, whereas 3 moles were taken up per mole of N-glycolylneuraminic acid under the same conditions. Oxidation of 1 mole of the sialic acid liberated 0.88 mole of acetaldehyde. (d) Its reaction with thiobarbituric acid yielded only 39.6% of the color obtained by the direct Ehrlich procedure. (e) The sialic acid was not cleaved by N-acetylneuraminic acid aldolase. (f) Infrared spectrum studies of the sialic acid indicated the presence of methyl and O-acetyl ester groups."
https://openalex.org/W1588610437,"Abstract The native calf brain ATP-creatine transphosphorylase, like its muscle enzyme counterpart (Jacobs, H. K., Keutel, H. J., Yue, R. H., Okabe, K., and Kuby, S. A., Fed. Proc., 27, 640 (1968)) contains 2 reactive sulfhydryl groups per mole, or 1 per polypeptide chain of this dimeric protein (Yue, R. H., Jacobs, H. K., Okabe, K., Keutel, H. J., and Kuby, S. A., Biochemistry, 7, 4291 (1968)), which may be titrated with 5,5'-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB). In the presence of denaturants, other sulfhydryl groups are revealed. The kinetics of reactions between DTNB and the sulfhydryl groups of both the calf brain and the muscle isoenzyme have been measured under several sets of denaturing conditions. A comparison of their respective second order velocity constants reveals significant differences between these two isoenzymes, i.e. in the reactivity or accessibility of their types of sulfhydryl groups. Reactions between DTNB and the 2 normally reactive sulfhydryl groups per mole of either isoenzyme leads to essentially complete loss in enzymatic activity, which may be recovered after reduction; therefore, like the rabbit muscle enzyme (Mahowald, T. A., Noltmann, E. A., and Kuby, S. A., J. Biol. Chem., 237, 1535 (1962)), these 2 exposed sulfhydryl groups appear to be essential either for the catalysis or their active conformation, or both. In contrast to the calf muscle isoenzyme, with a total of 8 sulfhydryl groups per mole, or 4 per subunit, there are 10 sulfhydryl groups per mole of brain isoenzyme. These 2 additional sulfhydryl groups per mole of brain isoenzyme are not readily titrated by DTNB even in 8 m urea, 4 m guanidinium chloride, or 1.8% lauryl sulfate; or by p-chloromercuribenzoate under other denaturing conditions. However, under acidic conditions (pH 3.2 at 30°), they may be reacted with 4,4'-dithiodipyridine. A comparison between the muscle isoenzyme and its more acid-labile brain isoenzyme may be made in terms of the kinetics of reaction with 4,4'-dithiodipyridine as a function of pH. Another unique property of the native brain isoenzyme, in contrast to its muscle isoenzyme, appears to be its unusual susceptibility to oxidation. In the presence of atmospheric O2, there is a progressive decay in the 2 normally reactive sulfhydryl groups per mole, both in their number and rates of reaction with DTNB. After prolonged reactions with O2, secondarily reactive, or normally inaccessible, sulfhydryl groups are then exposed for reaction with DTNB in a complex and multiphasic type of reaction. Finally, the mixed disulfide (TNB-protein) formed by reaction between DTNB and the 2 normally reactive sulfhydryl groups per mole, could be prepared from both calf isoenzymes. Although the TNB-muscle protein appeared to be stable between pH 5.5 and pH 8.5, the 5-thio-2-nitrobenzoate group could be released in a pseudo first order fashion from the brain isoenzyme derivative, under mildly acidic conditions, and in the absence of any external reductant. At 30°, ionic strengths above 0.2, the kinetics of 5-thio-2-nitrobenzoate release seemed to be approximately first order (0.85 measured) in H+ over a narrow pH range of 5.5 to 6.5. This H+-initiated process presumably is the result of a pH-dependent unfolding which leads to a thiol-disulfide reaction between this mixed disulfide and a normally unreactive or inaccessible sulfhydryl group within the brain isoenzyme protein."
https://openalex.org/W1607708761,"Abstract The enzymatic activity of citrate synthase from pig heart can be inhibited by various ions. The order of inhibitory effect of monovalent cations is Li+ g K+ g Na+ g Cs+ and that of anions is SCN- g Cl- g tartrate. Divalent cations such as Ca2+ and Mg2+ are much more effective than monovalent cations, but thiocyanate is as effective as divalent cations. ATP is also a potent inhibitor, but dATP has no effect. The inhibition by mono- and divalent cations and ATP can be overcome by an increase in the concentration of one of the substrates, acetyl coenzyme A, but not the other, oxalacetate."

https://openalex.org/W2038798344,"MANY mycoplasmas liberate peroxide in vitro1–3 and this might be an important virulence factor in respiratory infections1,3,4. There are, however, few in vivo data5 to support this hypothesis. Recently we showed that several mycoplasma species grew in chicken embryo tracheal organ cultures and that some adversely affected ciliary activity6. Subsequent studies have shown that the cytopathic effect of M. mycoides var. capri in organ cultures is caused by peroxide secretion7. Conversely, damage to cilia caused by M. gallisepticum is not (unpublished observations of J. D. C. and D. T-R.). We have now measured and compared peroxide production by several mycoplasmas in tracheal organ cultures and correlated the findings with damage to the ciliated epithelium."

https://openalex.org/W1595040753,"Abstract Native bovine factor V exists in three forms of differing molecular size, the oligomeric interconvertible forms A and C and a phospholipid-containing complex designated form L. Thrombin increases the activity of form A to a greater extent than form L and does not alter the activity of form C. Thrombin-activated form A and form C function as potent inhibitors of thrombin activation of form A but cannot inhibit the action of thrombin on other substrates as α-N-toluene-sulfonyl-l-arginine methyl ester and fibrinogen. No change in the molecular size of any of these three forms was detected after exposure to thrombin. Factor V derived from serum by endogenous thrombin action appeared to have a smaller Stokes radius than that of form A, the predominant form in plasma. However, the serum factor V associates to a form similar in size to form A after storage in 50% glycerol. These results suggest the formation of a complex between these inhibitor forms of factor V and activated factor V (form A), suggesting that both substrate and product inhibition occur."

https://openalex.org/W2123058060,"Abstract Calf thymus histones have been fractionated by column chromatographic procedures with carboxymethyl cellulose and Sephadex. Characterization of some of the fractions was performed by acrylamide gel electrophoresis, amino acid composition, peptide mapping, and sedimentation. Five of the fractions obtained were shown to be essentially homogeneous. Ultraviolet absorption spectra, optical rotatory dispersion, and circular dichroism of five histones have been determined. These histones exhibit spectra through which it is thus possible to differentiate them. The rotatory dispersion results indicate that the different conformational behavior of these five histones depends on environmental conditions such as salt concentration and organic solvent concentration. A slightly lysine-rich histone fraction was found to contain a minute amount of nonprotein components, which appears to be tightly bound oligonucleotide. X-ray diffraction patterns and infrared spectra exhibited by this fraction are also presented."
https://openalex.org/W2014135389,"UNSCHEDULED synthesis of DNA has been observed in the nuclei of HeLa cells at some stage of the cell cycle other than the S-phase when cells are exposed in vitro to ultraviolet light or X-ray irradiation1. It has since been confirmed for several other cell types2–5. Part of the synthesis defined in terms of the uptake of 3H-thymidine—which was detected in HeLa cells as the result of large doses of ultraviolet irradiation—was non-semiconservative (repair replication), corresponding to the insertion of DNA precursors into extant parental DNA strands. Here I present evidence that X-irradiation of a 1 day old female guinea-pig with 5,000 rad is followed by a small but auto-radiographically detectable incorporation of 3H-thymidine into the DNA of diplotene oocytes. In the guinea-pig, the mouse and most other mammals the premeiotic DNA synthesis occurs during embryonic life6. After birth the oocytes have all entered prophase of meiosis during which no DNA synthesis is normally observed."
