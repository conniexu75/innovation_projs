https://openalex.org/W2066034383,"Explaining altruistic cooperation is one of the greatest challenges for evolutionary biology. One solution to this problem is if costly cooperative behaviours are directed towards relatives. This idea of kin selection has been hugely influential and applied widely from microorganisms to vertebrates. However, a problem arises if there is local competition for resources, because this leads to competition between relatives, reducing selection for cooperation. Here we use an experimental evolution approach to test the effect of the scale of competition, and how it interacts with relatedness. The cooperative trait that we examine is the production of siderophores, iron-scavenging agents, in the pathogenic bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa. As expected, our results show that higher levels of cooperative siderophore production evolve in the higher relatedness treatments. However, our results also show that more local competition selects for lower levels of siderophore production and that there is a significant interaction between relatedness and the scale of competition, with relatedness having less effect when the scale of competition is more local. More generally, the scale of competition is likely to be of particular importance for the evolution of cooperation in microorganisms, and also the virulence of pathogenic microorganisms, because cooperative traits such as siderophore production have an important role in determining virulence."
https://openalex.org/W1550762220,"The phase diagram of hole-doped copper oxides shows four different electronic phases existing at zero temperature. Familiar among these are the Mott insulator, high-transition-temperature superconductor and metallic phases. A fourth phase, of unknown identity, occurs at light doping along the zero-temperature bound of the 'pseudogap' regime. This regime is rich in peculiar electronic phenomena, prompting numerous proposals that it contains some form of hidden electronic order. Here we present low-temperature electronic structure imaging studies of a lightly hole-doped copper oxide: Ca2-xNaxCuO2Cl2. Tunnelling spectroscopy (at energies |E| > 100 meV) reveals electron extraction probabilities greatly exceeding those for injection, as anticipated for a doped Mott insulator. However, for |E| < 100 meV, the spectrum exhibits a V-shaped energy gap centred on E = 0. States within this gap undergo intense spatial modulations, with the spatial correlations of a four CuO2-unit-cell square 'checkerboard', independent of energy. Intricate atomic-scale electronic structure variations also exist within the checkerboard. These data are consistent with an unanticipated crystalline electronic state, possibly the hidden electronic order, existing in the zero-temperature pseudogap regime of Ca2-xNaxCuO2Cl2."
https://openalex.org/W2042905219,"Metastasis is a major factor in the malignancy of cancers, and is often responsible for the failure of cancer treatment. Anoikis (apoptosis resulting from loss of cell-matrix interactions) has been suggested to act as a physiological barrier to metastasis; resistance to anoikis may allow survival of cancer cells during systemic circulation, thereby facilitating secondary tumour formation in distant organs. In an attempt to identify metastasis-associated oncogenes, we designed an unbiased, genome-wide functional screen solely on the basis of anoikis suppression. Here, we report the identification of TrkB, a neurotrophic tyrosine kinase receptor, as a potent and specific suppressor of caspase-associated anoikis of non-malignant epithelial cells. By activating the phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase/protein kinase B pathway, TrkB induced the formation of large cellular aggregates that survive and proliferate in suspension. In mice, these cells formed rapidly growing tumours that infiltrated lymphatics and blood vessels to colonize distant organs. Consistent with the ability of TrkB to suppress anoikis, metastases--whether small vessel infiltrates or large tumour nodules--contained very few apoptotic cells. These observations demonstrate the potent oncogenic effects of TrkB and uncover a specific pro-survival function that may contribute to its metastatic capacity, providing a possible explanation for the aggressive nature of human tumours that overexpress TrkB."

https://openalex.org/W2161241792,"In photosynthesis, the harvesting of solar energy and its subsequent conversion into a stable charge separation are dependent upon an interconnected macromolecular network of membrane-associated chlorophyll–protein complexes. Although the detailed structure of each complex has been determined1,2,3,4, the size and organization of this network are unknown. Here we show the use of atomic force microscopy to directly reveal a native bacterial photosynthetic membrane. This first view of any multi-component membrane shows the relative positions and associations of the photosynthetic complexes and reveals crucial new features of the organization of the network: we found that the membrane is divided into specialized domains each with a different network organization and in which one type of complex predominates. Two types of organization were found for the peripheral light-harvesting LH2 complex. In the first, groups of 10–20 molecules of LH2 form light-capture domains that interconnect linear arrays of dimers of core reaction centre (RC)–light-harvesting 1 (RC–LH1–PufX) complexes; in the second they were found outside these arrays in larger clusters. The LH1 complex is ideally positioned to function as an energy collection hub, temporarily storing it before transfer to the RC where photochemistry occurs: the elegant economy of the photosynthetic membrane is demonstrated by the close packing of these linear arrays, which are often only separated by narrow ‘energy conduits’ of LH2 just two or three complexes wide."
https://openalex.org/W2077517942,"The maintenance of murine embryonic stem (ES) cell self-renewal is regulated by leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF)-dependent activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) and LIF-independent mechanisms including Nanog, BMP2/4, and Wnt signaling. Here we demonstrate a previously undescribed role for phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3Ks) in regulation of murine ES cell self-renewal. Treatment with the reversible PI3K inhibitor, LY294002, or more specific inhibition of class IA PI3K via regulated expression of dominant negative Δp85, led to a reduction in the ability of LIF to maintain self-renewal, with cells concomitantly adopting a differentiated morphology. Inhibition of PI3Ks reduced basal and LIF-stimulated phosphorylation of PKB/Akt, GSK3α/β, and S6 proteins. Importantly, LY294002 and Δp85 expression had no effect on LIF-induced phosphorylation of STAT3 at Tyr705, but did augment LIF-induced phosphorylation of ERKs in both short and long term incubations. Subsequently, we demonstrate that inhibition of MAP-Erk kinases (MEKs) reverses the effects of PI3K inhibition on self-renewal in a time- and dose-dependent manner, suggesting that the elevated ERK activity observed upon PI3K inhibition contributes to the functional response we observe. Surprisingly, upon long term inhibition of PI3Ks we observed a reduction in phosphorylation of β-catenin, the target of GSK-3 action in the canonical Wnt pathway, although no consistent alterations in cytosolic levels of β-catenin were observed, indicating this pathway is not playing a major role downstream of PI3Ks. Our studies support a role for PI3Ks in regulation of self-renewal and increase our understanding of the molecular signaling components involved in regulation of stem cell fate.

Murine embryonic stem cells, derived from the inner cell mass of preimplantation embryos (1Evans M.J. Kaufmann M. Nature. 1981; 292: 154-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (6534) Google Scholar, 2Martin G.R.

The pluripotency of stem cells relies on their ability to self-renew, and the cytokine leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) 1The abbreviations used are: LIF, leukemia inhibitory factor; BMP, bone morphogenic protein; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; ES, embryonic stem cell; GSK, glycogen synthase kinase; PI3K, phosphoinositide 3-kinase; PKB, protein kinase B; STAT, signal transducer and activator of transcription; Tet, tetracycline; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase. has been shown to be important for maintaining the pluripotency of murine ES cells (3Smith A.G.

Biol. 1987; 121: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). LIF signals through a heteromeric receptor, comprised of gp130 and the low affinity LIF receptor, to induce activation of STAT3, which has been shown by several groups to play an essential role in maintaining self-renewal (5Boeuf H.

LIF also induces activation of a number of additional signaling proteins, including ERKs (9Burdon T. Stracey C. Chambers I. Nichols J. Smith A. Dev.

Nichols J. Smith A. Dev. Biol. 1999; 210: 30-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar) and has led to the suggestion that the balance between LIF-induced STAT3 and ERK signals is important in determining the fate of a dividing undifferentiated ES cell (13Burdon T. Smith A. Savatier P. Trends in Cell Biol. 2002; 12: 432-438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar). The Src family of tyrosine kinases appears to play a role in maintaining self-renewal (12Anneren C. Cowan C.A. Melton D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 31590-31598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Recently, a number of publications have identified additional pathways that also appear to contribute to the regulation of self-renewal of murine ES cells. Forced expression of homeodomain protein Nanog can maintain ES cells in an undifferentiated state in the absence of LIF (14Mitsui K. Tokuzawa Y. Itoh H. Segawa K. Murakami M. Takahashi K. Maruyama M.

Cell. 2003; 113: 643-655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2678) Google Scholar). The bone morphogenic proteins BMP2 and BMP4 also participate in maintenance of self-renewal by cooperating with LIF (16Ying Q.L. Nichols J. Chambers I. Smith A. Cell. 2003; 115: 281-292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1729) Google Scholar, 17Qi X. Li T.-G. Hao J. Hu J. Wang J. Simmons H. Miura S. Mishina Y. Zhao G-Q. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci, U. S. A. 2004; 101: 6027-6032Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). It appears that BMP-induced expression of Id genes, via Smad signaling, suppresses expression of genes, which normally induce neuronal differentiation (16Ying Q.L. Nichols J. Chambers I. Smith A. Cell. 2003; 115: 281-292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1729) Google Scholar). Alternatively, it has also been reported that BMP4-mediated inhibition of p38 MAPK activity may play a role in regulation of self-renewal (17Qi X. Li T.-G. Hao J. Hu J. Wang J. Simmons H. Miura S. Mishina Y. Zhao G-Q. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci, U. S. A. 2004; 101: 6027-6032Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). Other recent reports have implicated glycogen synthase 3 (GSK-3) α/β and the Wnt signaling pathway in regulation of self-renewal of both murine and human ES cells (18Meijer L. Skaltsounis A.-L. Magiatis P. Polychronopoulus P. Knockaert M. Leost M. Ryan X.P. Vonica C.A. Brivanlou A.H. Dajani R. Crovace C. Tarricone C. Musacchio A. Trose S.M. Pearl L. Greengard P. Chem.

Med. 2004; 10: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (1749) Google Scholar). This work stemmed from the development of novel GSK-3 inhibitors (18Meijer L. Skaltsounis A.-L. Magiatis P. Polychronopoulus P. Knockaert M. Leost M. Ryan X.P. Vonica C.A. Brivanlou A.H. Dajani R. Crovace C. Tarricone C. Musacchio A. Trose S.M. Pearl L. Greengard P. Chem.

Additionally, Wnt3a has been shown to play a role in maintaining self-renewal of hemopoietic stem cells (20Reya T. Duncan A.W. Allies L. Doman J. Scherer D.C. Wilert K. Hinta L. Nusse R. Weissman I.L. Nature. 2003; 423: 409-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (1813) Google Scholar). PI3Ks are a family of lipid kinases, whose products, phosphoinositide 3,4-bisphosphate (PI(3,4)P2) and phosphoinositide 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PI(3,4,5)P3) act as intracellular second messengers (21Vanhaesebroeck B. Waterfield M.D. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 239-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (764) Google Scholar, 22Vanhaesebroeck B. Leevers S.J. Ahmadi K. Timms J. Katso R. Driscoll P.C. Woscholski R. Parker P.J. Waterfield M.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 535-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1375) Google Scholar). Members of the three distinct classes of PI3Ks have been implicated in the regulation of an array of physiological processes, notably the control of proliferation, cell survival, cell migration, and trafficking (21Vanhaesebroeck B. Waterfield M.D. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 239-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (764) Google Scholar, 22Vanhaesebroeck B. Leevers S.J. Ahmadi K. Timms J. Katso R. Driscoll P.C. Woscholski R. Parker P.J. Waterfield M.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 535-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1375) Google Scholar). Members of the class IA family of PI3Ks, comprising a regulatory subunit (typically 85 or 55 kDa) and a 110 kDa catalytic subunit (21Vanhaesebroeck B. Waterfield M.D. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 239-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (764) Google Scholar, 22Vanhaesebroeck B. Leevers S.J. Ahmadi K. Timms J. Katso R. Driscoll P.C. Woscholski R. Parker P.J. Waterfield M.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 535-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1375) Google Scholar) are known to be activated via gp130, the signaling component of the LIF receptor (23Boulton T.G. Stahl N. Yancopoulos G.D.

Biol. 1998; 18: 4109-4117Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). The role of phosphoinositide signaling in ES cells is currently limited to reports implicating PI3Ks in the control of ES cell proliferation (25Jirmanova L. Afanassieff M. Gobert-Gosse S.

Using both pharmacological and molecular tools we demonstrate that PI3K signaling is required for efficient self-renewal in the presence of LIF. Loss of self-renewal upon inhibition of PI3K signaling is associated with an increase in ERK phosphorylation, which appears to play a functional role in this response. Cell Culture and Generation of Transfectants—E14tg2a (4Smith A.G. Hooper M.L. Dev. Biol. 1987; 121: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar), CCE (29Keller G. Kennedy M. Papayannopoulou T.

Cells were trypsinized and replated or re-fed every second day. The Tet-off-regulated expression system was used to express a dominant negative p85 regulatory subunit of class IA PI3Ks. E14tg2a expressing the Tet-sensitive transactivator, tTA (E14 tTA (32Era T. Witte O.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1737-1742Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar)), was a kind gift from Dr. O. Witte (UCLA). 1 × 107 E14 tTA cells were electroporated at 800 mV/3.0 microarad with 10 mg of linearized response plasmid encoding the dominant negative form of class IA p85a regulatory subunit, termed Δp85. Δp85 lacks the p110 interaction site, so acting as a competitive inhibitor, and we have described its use previously (33Craddock B.L. Orchiston E.A. Hinton H.J. Welham M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10633-10640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Selection in the presence of 1000 units/ml LIF, 500 ng/ml Tet, and 200 mg/ml G418 was initiated 48 h following transfection, and individual clones were picked following 6 days in selection media. For screening, 1 × 105 cells were plated into 60-mm plates in the presence or absence of 500 ng/ml Tet. Following 24 h, lysates were prepared and immunoblotted for expression of Δp85. Independent clones (termed E14Δp85) exhibiting very low to undetectable basal expression and good inducible expression of Δp85 upon Tet removal were selected for further analyses. For induction of expression of Δp85, E14Δp85 clones were washed three times with Hank's-buffered saline solution and then incubated in LIF-containing media in the absence of Tet, to induce expression of Δp85, or were maintained in the presence of 500 ng/ml Tet for differing lengths of time, dependent on the experiment. Self-renewal Assays—ES cells were plated at 3 × 103 to 1 × 104 cells per gelatin-coated 60-mm tissue culture dish in Glasgow-modified Ea gle's medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (ES-tested Hyclone, Perbio, Cheshire, UK), 0.1 mm mercaptoethanol, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 2 mm glutamine, and 0.1 mm nonessential amino acids. Plates were cultured without LIF or with the addition of LIF (500–1000 units/ml depending on the experiment). E14tg2a, IOUD2, or CCE cells were additionally supplemented with 5 μm LY294002, 10 μm U0126, 50 μm PD98059, or Me2SO alone. Clones expressing Δp85 were additionally plated in the presence or absence of 500 ng/ml Tet. To detect cells expressing alkaline phosphatase, a marker of pluripotency, after 3–6 days of culture, dishes for each treatment were washed, fixed, and then stained for 15 min with a solution containing 1 mg/ml Fast Red TR salt™ (Sigma) dissolved in 0.1 m Tris, pH 9.2, containing 200 mg/ml naphthol AS-MX phosphate (34Scutt A. Bertram P. Calc. Tiss. Intl. 1999; 64: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Alkaline phosphatase-positive colonies were counted in triplicate for each treatment. Proliferation and Cell Viability Assays—XTT (sodium 3′-[1-[(phenylamino)-carbonyl]-3,4-tetrazolium]-bis(4-methoxy-6-nitro) benzenesulfonic acid hydrate) bioreduction assays were used to assess growth of ES cells. 1 × 103 ES cells were plated in triplicate in 96-well plates, previously coated with 0.1% (w/v) gelatin in the presence or absence of different doses of LY294002 (Calbiochem) or Me2SO alone in media containing 1000 units/ml murine LIF. 25 μl of a solution containing 1 mg/ml XTT and 25 μm phenazine methosulfate was added per well for the final 4 h of the 48-h incubation. The soluble formazan product was measured at 450 nm. For cell growth curve analyses, cells were plated at 1 × 104 cells per 60-mm dish and counted in duplicate at defined times. Viability was determined using trypan blue exclusion assays. Duplicate plates were set up per treatment, and duplicate counts from each plate performed. Short Term Stimulations with LIF and Cell Lysates—ES cells and transfectants were washed three times in Hank's-buffered saline solution and incubated for 4 h in media lacking serum replacement and LIF. When required, 10 μm LY294002 or Me2SO alone were added for the last 30 min of this preincubation period. Cells were stimulated for the times indicated in minutes with 1 × 104 units/ml LIF prior to preparation of cell lysates. Dishes were placed on ice and washed three times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline prior to lysis directly in the dish with solubilization buffer, as described previously (35Welham M.J. Duronio V. Leslie K.B. Bowtell D. Schrader J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21165-21176Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation for 3 min at full speed in a micro-centrifuge at 4 °C. Protein concentrations of clarified supernatants were determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay kit according to the manufacturers' instructions. Immunoblotting, Immunoprecipitation, and Antibodies—20 μg of each cell lysate were fractionated by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted onto nitrocellulose (35Welham M.J. Duronio V. Leslie K.B. Bowtell D. Schrader J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21165-21176Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For immunoprecipitation, 500 μg of protein were used per cell extract sample and anti-p85 precipitates prepared as described previously (36Craddock B.L. Welham M.J. J. Biol.

Although previous reports have demonstrated that gp130 receptors couple to the PI3K pathway (10Ernst M. Oates A. Dunn A.R. J. Biol.

Chem. 2003; 278: 5099-5108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), the ability of LIF to directly regulate this pathway in ES cells has not been reported. We investigated LIF-induced activation of PI3K-dependent signals by assessing phosphorylation of serine 473 on PKB (also known as Akt), serine 21, or serine 9 of GSK3 α and β, and phosphorylation of the S6 protein. As shown in Fig. 1, A and B, LIF treatment transiently increased phosphorylation of PKB/Akt, GSK-3, and S6 protein. Interestingly, we did not detect changes in phosphorylation of threonine 308 of PKB/Akt upon LIF stimulation, the reasons for which are not clear (data not shown). The dependence of these effects on PI3Ks were examined by pretreating ES cells with the broad specificity PI3K inhibitor, LY294002, an extremely useful and widely used tool to investigate the involvement of PI3Ks in functional responses, because it reversibly inhibits all three classes of PI3Ks (39Vlahos C.J. Matter W.F. Hui K.Y. Brown R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5241-5248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1A, LY294002 significantly reduces LIF-induced phosphorylation of PKB, GSK-3, and S6 protein. The class IA PI3K subfamily are most commonly activated by cytokines signaling via gp130 (23Boulton T.G. Stahl N. Yancopoulos G.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11648-11655Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Takahashi-Tezuka M. Yoshida Y. Fukada T. Ohtani T. Yamanaka Y. Nishida K. Nakajima K. Hibi M. Hirano T. Mol. Cell.

This mutant, termed Δp85, which we have used successfully in the past (33Craddock B.L. Orchiston E.A. Hinton H.J. Welham M.J. J. Biol.

A. 1994; 91: 7415-7419Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar) and acts as a competitive inhibitor for all class IA catalytic subunits (p110 α, β, and δ). A number of independent E14tTA ES cell transfectants that expressed Δp85 in the absence of Tet were isolated, characterized, and referred to as E14Δp85. Expression of Δp85 reduced phosphorylation of Ser473 of PKB/Akt, Ser21/9 of GSK-3α/β, and S6 proteins upon LIF stimulation and in cells maintained in normal culture conditions prior to lysis here termed Basal levels (-Tet samples, Fig. 1, B and C), although not to such an extent at LY294002. As an additional measure of the coupling of LIF signaling to the PI3K pathway, we performed immunoprecipitations with antibodies recognizing the p85 adaptor subunit of class IA family members. As shown in Fig. 1D, treatment of E14tg2a ES cells with LIF led to increased co-precipitation of endogenous p85 with a phosphotyrosyl-containing protein of ∼90–95 kDa, indicating engagement of the class IA PI3K pathway upon LIF stimulation. These results, combined with the ability of LIF to induce PI3K-dependent phosphorylation of known downstream effectors, are consistent with LIF activating the PI3K signal transduction cascade in undifferentiated ES cells. Inhibition of PI3K-dependent Signaling Reduces Murine ES Cell Self-renewal—Given that LIF activates PI3K-dependent signals, we investigated whether the PI3K pathway plays a role in regulating self-renewal. Self-renewal was quantified using clonal assays and staining for the presence of alkaline phosphatase using Fast Red™, which stains only undifferentiated cells. Culturing E14tg2a ES cells in the presence of LIF maintained undifferentiated colonies at between 80 and 90% (Fig. 2A, panel i). Addition of 5 μm LY294002, a dose close to the reported IC50 value for inhibition of class IA PI3Ks (39Vlahos C.J. Matter W.F. Hui K.Y. Brown R.F. J. Biol.

So far, the molecular mechanism of this membrane penetration step has resisted structural analysis. The spike protein VP4 is a principal component in the entry apparatus of rotavirus, a non-enveloped virus that causes gastroenteritis and kills 440,000 children each year. Trypsin cleavage of VP4 primes the virus for entry by triggering a rearrangement that rigidifies the VP4 spikes. We have determined the crystal structure, at 3.2 A resolution, of the main part of VP4 that projects from the virion. The crystal structure reveals a coiled-coil stabilized trimer. Comparison of this structure with the two-fold clustered VP4 spikes in a approximately 12 A resolution image reconstruction from electron cryomicroscopy of trypsin-primed virions shows that VP4 also undergoes a second rearrangement, in which the oligomer reorganizes and each subunit folds back on itself, translocating a potential membrane-interaction peptide from one end of the spike to the other. This rearrangement resembles the conformational transitions of membrane fusion proteins of enveloped viruses."

AAA ATPase (ATPase associated with various cellular activities) p97/valosin-containing protein (VCP) subsequently dislodges the ubiquitinated proteins from the ER and chaperones them to the cytosol, where they undergo proteasomal degradation. We now report that gp78 physically interacts with p97/VCP and enhances p97/VCP-polyubiquitin association. The enhanced association correlates with decreases in ER stress-induced accumulation of polyubiquitinated proteins. This effect is abolished when the p97/VCP-interacting domain of gp78 is removed. Further, using ERAD substrate CD3δ, gp78 consistently enhances p97/VCP-CD3δ binding and facilitates CD3δ degradation. Moreover, inhibition of endogenous gp78 expression by RNA interference markedly increases the levels of total polyubiquitinated proteins, including CD3δ, and abrogates VCP-CD3δ interactions. The gp78 mutant with deletion of its p97/VCP-interacting domain fails to increase CD3δ degradation and leads to accumulation of polyubiquitinated CD3δ, suggesting a failure in delivering ubiquitinated CD3δ for degradation.

For example, in order to target polyubiquitinated proteins for proteasomal degradation, p97/VCP must interact with polyubiquitin chains through its ND1 domains and chaperone polyubiquitinated proteins to the proteasome (18Dai R.M. Chen E. Longo D.L. Gorbea C.M. Li C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3562-3573Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). Interaction of ubiquitin with the UT3 domain of Ufd1 enhances p97/VCP-polyubiquitin binding (19Ye Y. Meyer H.H. Rapoport T.A. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 71-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). This finding at least partially explains why the p97/VCP-Ufd1-Npl4 complex is required to dislodge ubiquitinated misfolded proteins from the ER to the cytosol for proteasomal degradation (20Tsai B. Ye Y. Rapoport T.A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 246-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar). Although Npl4 is required for p97/VCP function in retrotranslocation, its ubiquitin-interacting motif, the Npl4 zinc finger domain, is not involved in ERAD (19Ye Y. Meyer H.H. Rapoport T.A. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 71-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). This is supported by the fact that yeast Npl4 does not have an Npl4 zinc finger domain and is competent for retrotranslocation in ERAD. p47 interacts with ubiquitin via its ubiquitin-associated domain, which is required for membrane fusion during postmitotic reassembly of Golgi stacks (21Meyer H.H. Wang Y. Warren G. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5645-5652Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). p47 also contains a Ubx domain. Recent studies indicate that a family of yeast Ubx domain-containing proteins, including p47, interact with CDC48 via their Ubx domain and are involved in proteasome-mediated proteolysis (22Hartmann-Petersen R. Wallace M. Hofmann K. Koch G. Johnsen A.H. Hendil K.B. Gordon C. Curr. Biol. 2004; 14: 824-828Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 23Schuberth C. Richly H. Rumpf S. Buchberger A. EMBO Rep. 2004; 5: 818-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). How Ubx domain-CDC48 interaction regulates the function of CDC48 as a chaperone for ubiquitin is unknown. The ubiquitin binding in p97/VCP-Ufd1-Npl4- or p97/VCP-p47-regulated processes appears to be dynamic. A newly identified p97/VCP-interacting protein, VCIP135, is found to be a deubiquitinating enzyme (24Uchiyama K. Jokitalo E. Kano F. Murata M. Zhang X. Canas B. Newman R. Rabouille C. Pappin D. Freemont P. Kondo H. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 855-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 25Wang Y. Satoh A. Warren G. Meyer H.H. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 164: 973-978Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). p97/VCP-p47-mediated reassembly of Golgi stacks requires both VCIP135 and p47-ubiquitin interactions (21Meyer H.H. Wang Y. Warren G. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5645-5652Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 25Wang Y. Satoh A. Warren G. Meyer H.H. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 164: 973-978Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Thus, a cycle of ubiquitination and deubiquitination must play a role in the regulation of Golgi membrane dynamics during mitosis. Another p97/VCP-interacting protein is SVIP, which competes with p47 and Ufd1 for binding to the ND1 domain of p97/VCP (26Nagahama M. Suzuki M. Hamada Y. Hatsuzawa K. Tani K. Yamamoto A. Tagaya M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 262-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). SVIP may regulate p97/VCP complex binding to ubiquitin. A recurrent role for CDC48/p97/VCP-Ufd1-Npl4 is disassembly of protein complexes through binding to protein(s) via ubiquitin-dependent and -independent mechanisms. Studies in Xenopus egg extracts have shown that CDC48/p97/VCP-Ufd1-Npl4 complex-mediated disassembly of mitotic spindles is through its interaction with XMAP215 and TPX2 and regulates their binding to microtubules at mitotic exit (6Cao K. Nakajima R. Meyer H.H. Zheng Y. Cell. 2003; 115: 355-367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). This regulation is independent of XMAP215 and TPX2 degradation. XMAP215 and TPX2 are neither ubiquitinated nor degraded during interaction with p97/VCP. A similar process occurs in yeast in which CDC48-Ufd1-Npl4 complex selectively binds to polyubiquitin on the activated transcription factor SPT23, separates it from its precursor, and enables it to enter the nucleus for gene transcription (16Rape M. Hoppe T. Gorr I. Kalocay M. Richly H. Jentsch S. Cell. 2001; 107: 667-677Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that CDC48-Ufd1-Npl4 acts as a ubiquitin-selective segregase. In the case where proteolysis requires segregation of a proteolytic substrate from other proteins (e.g. in ERAD or in selective degradation of subunits from oligomeric complexes), the segregase and the proteasome may cooperate in degradation (16Rape M. Hoppe T. Gorr I. Kalocay M. Richly H. Jentsch S. Cell. 2001; 107: 667-677Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). In ERAD, a newly identified ER membrane protein, VIMP, appears to recruit p97/VCP and targets it to Derlin1, a proposed component of the retrotranslocation channel for selective dislodging of unwanted proteins from the ER (27Ye Y. Shibata Y. Yun C. Ron D. Rapoport T.A. Nature. 2004; 429: 841-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (804) Google Scholar, 28Lilley B.N. Ploegh H.L. Nature. 2004; 429: 834-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar). In this scenario, p97/VCP interacts with ERAD substrates both before and after ubiquitination (19Ye Y. Meyer H.H. Rapoport T.A. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 71-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). gp78 was originally identified as the receptor for the tumor autocrine motility factor that promotes tumor metastasis (29Silletti S. Paku S. Raz A. Pathol. Oncol. Res. 1997; 3: 230-254Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have recently established gp78 as a really interesting new gene (RING) finger-dependent E3 ubiquitin ligase involved in ubiquitinating ERAD substrates (30Fang S. Ferrone M. Yang C. Jensen J.P. Tiwari S. Weissman A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14422-14427Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). Therefore, gp78 and p97/VCP functionally cooperate during ERAD. In this study, we demonstrate that gp78 physically interacts with p97/VCP. The interaction enhances p97/VCP complex-polyubiquitin binding and degradation of ERAD substrate under ER stress. These data suggest a novel mechanism by which gp78 physically interacts with p97/VCP in coupling ubiquitination, retrotranslocation, and proteasomal degradation during ERAD.

Monoclonal antibody against p97/VCP was generated against a synthetic peptide derived from amino acids 792–806 of the murine p97/VCP (generously provided by Dr. Chou-Chi Li), and some were purchased from Research Diagnostics. pCIneo-gp78, pCIneo-gp78C, pGEX4T2-gp78C (309–643), pGEX-gp78CR2m, pGEX4T1-gp78CΔRING, pEGFP-N1-gp78, and pEGFP-N1-gp78ΔC have been previously described (30Fang S.

The cDNA for hHrd1 (KIAA1810) in pBluescript was obtained from KAZUSA DNA Research Institute, Japan, and was subcloned into pCIneo vector using SalI and NotI sites. The resulting pCIneo-hHrd1 was tagged with FLAG through site-directed mutagenesis. GST Pull-down Assay—All GST fusion proteins were expressed as reported (30Fang S. Ferrone M. Yang C. Jensen J.P. Tiwari S. Weissman A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14422-14427Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). Two micrograms of each GST fusion protein was immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads. For gp78 interactions with cellular p97/VCP and polyubiquitin, 293 cells were transfected with Myc-ubiquitin using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen). Twenty hours post-transfection, cells were treated with MG132 at 30 μm for 4 h. Cells were then harvested and lysed in Triton X-100 lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100). Glutathione-Sepharose bead-immobilized GST-gp78C and its mutants were incubated with the lysates for 1 h at 4 °C. After washing with 1× phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% Triton X-100, bead-associated proteins were processed for immunoblotting (IB) for Myc-ubiquitin and p97/VCP. IB followed the previously published protocol (30Fang S. Ferrone M. Yang C. Jensen J.P. Tiwari S. Weissman A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14422-14427Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). Analysis of p97/VCP Interaction with Polyubiquitin and CD3δ—293 cells were transfected with the indicated plasmids using LipofectAMINE 2000. In some experiments, pCDNA3-Myc-ubiquitin was co-transfected for detection of polyubiquitin using anti-Myc antibody. Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were lysed in radioimmune precipitation buffer (50 mm Tris/Cl, pH 7.4, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, and 1× protease inhibitor mixture from Sigma), and the lysates were processed for immunoprecipitation (IP) for p97/VCP or hemagglutinin (HA)-CD3δ. Co-immunoprecipitation of polyubiquitin or HA-CD3δ with p97/VCP was examined by IB. For detecting multiple proteins on the same membrane, the membrane was stripped between each blotting. For IP and membrane stripping, previously reported procedures were used (30Fang S. Ferrone M. Yang C. Jensen J.P. Tiwari S. Weissman A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14422-14427Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). A published RNAi procedure for expressing siRNA was adopted (31Brummelkamp T.R. Bernards R. Agami R. Science. 2002; 296: 550-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (3968) Google Scholar). Two regions from human gp78 cDNA, including bp 300–318 (for small interference RNA1 (siRNA1)) and 1318–1336 (for siRNA2), were cloned into the siRNA expression vector, pSuper (31Brummelkamp T.R. Bernards R. Agami R. Science. 2002; 296: 550-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (3968) Google Scholar). For determining the effectiveness of these siRNAs, 293 cells were co-transfected with 1 μgof pCIneo-gp78 with 3 μg of pSuper-siRNA1 or -siRNA2. Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were processed for IB to detect gp78 and actin, respectively. To determine the effects of gp78RNAi on the levels of total polyubiquitinated proteins, 293 cells were transfected with 3 μg of pSuper-siRNA2. Transfected cells were analyzed by IB for ubiquitin and p97/VCP, respectively. HA-CD3δ ubiquitination was assessed by IP for HA followed by SDS-PAGE and IB for ubiquitin as previously reported (30Fang S. Ferrone M. Yang C. Jensen J.P. Tiwari S. Weissman A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14422-14427Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). CD3δ degradation was determined by cycloheximide chase as previously published (30Fang S. Ferrone M. Yang C. Jensen J.P. Tiwari S. Weissman A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14422-14427Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). To determine the removal of CD3δ from the ER, cells transfected as indicated were fractionated into microsomes and cytosol. The subcellular fractionation was carried out as previously described (30Fang S. Ferrone M. Yang C. Jensen J.P. Tiwari S. Weissman A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14422-14427Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). gp78 Interacts with p97/VCP—The functional cooperation between gp78 and p97/VCP during ERAD prompted us to look for a possible physical association between these two proteins. In a GST pull-down assay, GST fusions of gp78 cytosolic tail (gp78C; amino acids 309–643) and its various mutants (see the schematic representation of the mutants in Fig. 1A, middle) were incubated with 293 cell lysates, and the associated p97/VCP was identified by IB. The result shows that gp78C indeed binds to p97/VCP (Fig. 1A, left, lane 3). Mutation or deletion of the RING finger (gp78CR2m; C341G and C356G mutations or gp78CΔRING) did not affect p97/VCP binding (Fig. 1A, left, lanes 4 and 5), indicating that the RING finger is not required for binding. Truncations of the C-terminal 135 and 65 amino acids of gp78 (gp78ΔC135 and gp78ΔC65) led to loss of p97/VCP binding (Fig. 1A, left, lanes 7 and 8), suggesting that the C-terminal region interacts with p97/VCP. Consistently, the C-terminal 49 amino acids of gp78 (gp78C49) were sufficient for p97/VCP interaction (Fig. 1A, left, lane 9). Therefore, the p97/VCP-interacting domain resides within the C-terminal 49 amino acids of gp78. Recently, the cue domains of yeast Vps9 and cue2 have been shown to be a ubiquitin-interacting motif (32Donaldson K.M. Yin H. Gekakis N. Supek F. Joazeiro C.A. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 258-262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 33Shih S.C. Prag G. Francis S.A. Sutanto M.A. Hurley J.H. Hicke L. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1273-1281Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 34Prag G. Misra S. Jones E.A. Ghirlando R. Davies B.A. Horazdovsky B.F. Hurley J.H.

Cell. 2003; 113: 621-630Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). By analogy, we speculated that the cue domain of gp78 might serve a similar role. Therefore, we examined the association of ubiquitin in the GST pull-down assay. In the experiments shown in Fig. 1A, all of gp78C and its mutants with the cue domain and the C-terminal 49 amino acids preserved binding to both polyubiquitin and p97/VCP (left, lanes 3–5). Further, deletion of the cue domain abolishes polyubiquitin binding (Fig. 1A, left, lanes 6 and 9), whereas deletion of gp78C49 abrogates the p97/VCP interaction (Fig. 1A, left, lanes 6–8). When both the cue domain and gp78C49 were removed, neither polyubiquitin nor p97/VCP binding were detected (Fig. 1A, left, lane 6; see a summary of these bindings in the right panel of Fig. 1A). Variable amounts of polyubiquitin binding between gp78C and its cue domain-containing mutants suggest that the cue-flanking regions affect ubiquitin binding. We also noticed that gp78-bound p97/VCP migrate slower than those in input used for the GST pull-down assay. This more slowly migrating form may represent a modified p97/VCP that binds to gp78 or an artifact caused by the SDS-PAGE itself. Nonetheless, these results indicate that the cue domain of gp78 binds polyubiquitin, whereas the C-terminal 49 amino acids contain the p97/VCP-interacting domain in vitro. To determine whether the same interactions occur in vivo, 293 cells were transfected either with WT gp78 or with a deletion mutant (amino acids 309–643; gp78ΔC-GFP) that lacks its cytosolic tail and carries a C-terminal GFP tag (refer to schematic representations of these proteins in Fig. 1B). Transfected cells were then processed for IP and IB. As predicted, p97/VCP coimmunoprecipitated with gp78-GFP (Fig. 1C, lane 2) but not with gp78ΔC-GFP or GFP alone (Fig. 1C, lanes 3 and 1, respectively). The smeared appearance of both gp78-GFP and gp78ΔC-GFP in the blot is due to their transmembrane domains as has been reported previously (30Fang S. Ferrone M. Yang C. Jensen J.P. Tiwari S. Weissman A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14422-14427Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). As with our in vitro studies, the C-terminal 49 amino acids are required for gp78 interaction with p97/VCP in cells. Both p97/VCP and polyubiquitin co-immunoprecipitated with full-length gp78 (Fig. 1D, left, lane 1), whereas only polyubiquitin co-immunoprecipitated with gp78ΔC49 (Fig. 1D, left, lane 2; see schematic representation of gp78ΔC49 in Fig. 1B). Thus, we conclude that the cue domain binds to polyubiquitin, and the C-terminal 49 amino acids contain p97/VCP-interacting domain. gp78 Enhances p97/VCP-Polyubiquitin Interaction—Like Ufd1 and Npl4, gp78 also interacts with both p97/VCP and polyubiquitin. It has been shown that Ufd1-Npl4 dimer association increases p97/VCP complex-ubiquitin interaction (19Ye Y. Meyer H.H. Rapoport T.A. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 71-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). This increase may be due to the additional ubiquitin-binding sites provided to the p97/VCP-Ufd1-Npl4 complex by Ufd1 and Npl4. The double ψ barrel folds that are present in both the UT3 domain of Ufd1 and the N domain of p97/VCP simultaneously interact with ubiquitin, which could also increase the affinity toward ubiquitin (19Ye Y. Meyer H.H. Rapoport T.A. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 71-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). Based on this evidence, we speculated that as a ubiquitin-interacting protein, gp78 might enhance p97/VCP interaction with polyubiquitin. To test this hypothesis, we examined the effects of gp78 on p97/VCP-ubiquitin interaction. WT gp78, gp78ΔC49, or gp78CΔRING (see schematic representation of these proteins in Fig. 1, A and B) were co-transfected with Myc-tagged ubiquitin into 293 cells. Transfected cells were lysed in radioimmune precipitation buffer, and p97/VCP was immunoprecipitated with monoclonal anti-p97/VCP antibody. Associated polyubiquitin was determined by IB. The results show that WT gp78 and gp78CΔRING markedly enhance polyubiquitin co-immunoprecipitation with p97/VCP (Fig. 2A, upper left, lanes 2 and 4). Co-immunoprecipitated gp78CΔRING was also evident (Fig. 2A, lower left, lane 4). However, there was no detectable level of co-immunoprecipitated gp78 (Fig. 2A, lower left, lane 2), although it was readily detected in the whole cell lysate used for IP (Fig. 2A, lower right, lane 2). Our inability to detect co-immunoprecipitated gp78 could be due to lower levels of co-immunoprecipitated gp78 and/or low sensitivity of the anti-gp78 antibodies. However, these experiments indeed show that enhanced polyubiquitin-p97/VCP co-immunoprecipitation requires gp78 interaction with p97/VCP, since gp78ΔC49 without the p97/VCPinteracting domain fails to increase p97/VCP and polyubiquitin co-immunoprecipitation (Fig. 2A, lower left, lane 3). Further, increased p97/VCP-polyubiquitin binding does not appear to be due to increases in total polyubiquitinated proteins. This observation is supported by the fact that gp78ΔC49 increases total polyubiquitinated proteins to the same levels as does WT gp78 and gp78CΔRING (Fig. 2A, upper right, lanes 2 and 3), but only the WT gp78 and gp78CΔRING enhance p97/VCP-polyubiquitin co-immunoprecipitation. Next we asked whether the enhanced p97/VCP-ubiquitin interaction is specific for gp78. To approach this question, we examined the effect of hHrd1 (36Kaneko M. Ishiguro M. Niinuma Y. Uesugi M. Nomura Y. FEBS Lett. 2002; 532: 147-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 37Nadav E. Shmueli A. Barr H. Gonen H. Ciechanover A. Reiss Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Fang, unpublished observation. on p97/VCP-polyubiquitin interactions. When hHrd1 was transfected into 293 cells, hHrd1 increased the levels of total polyubiquitinated proteins, as did WT gp78, but did not enhance p97/VCP-polyubiquitin co-immunoprecipitation (Fig. 2B, lane 5). These data indicate that gp78 interaction enhances p97/VCP-polyubiquitin binding, which is not dependent on the levels of total polyubiquitinated proteins. The enhanced binding could be due to the cue domain of gp78 that provides an additional ubiquitin-binding site when gp78 complexes with p97/VCP, as does Ufd1, or due to other unknown mechanisms. Enhanced p97/VCP-Polyubiquitin Binding Regulates Degradation of Ubiquitinated Proteins—Based on the roles of p97/VCP in targeting polyubiquitinated proteins for degradation, enhanced p97/VCP-polyubiquitin binding is predicted to increase degradation of polyubiquitinated ERAD substrates. However, we observed that both gp78 and gp78CΔRING increased total polyubiquitin (Fig. 2, A and B). Since ERAD occurs under conditions of ER stress, we speculated that ER stress might facilitate degradation of these p97/VCP-bound ubiquitinated proteins. To test this possibility, we examined levels of polyubiquitinated proteins in cells transfected with wild type and gp78CΔRING in the presence and absence of tunicamycin, an inhibitor of N-linked glycosylation. Levels of polyubiquitinated proteins in gp78 and gp78CΔRING-transfected cells were compared with empty vector-transfected cells treated with tunicamycin for 0, 4, and 8 h. Tunicamycin induced a time-dependent increase in polyubiquitinated proteins in empty vector-transfected cells (Fig. 3A, top, lanes 1–3). As previously demonstrated (Fig. 2, A and B), gp78 and gp78CΔRING increased total polyubiquitinated proteins (Fig. 3A, top, lanes 4 and 7). Importantly, tunicamycin induced time-dependent decreases of total polyubiquitinated proteins in gp78- and gp78CΔRING-transfected cells (Fig. 3A, top, lanes 4–9). To determine whether this decrease in ER stress-induced polyubiquitinated proteins was due to enhanced p97/VCP-polyubiquitin binding, gp78ΔC49 was transfected into 293 cells, and the levels of ER stress-induced polyubiquitinated proteins were assessed. As predicted, gp78ΔC49, a mutant that does not enhance p97/VCP-polyubiquitin association (Fig. 2, A and B), failed to decrease tunicamycin-induced polyubiquitinated proteins (Fig. 3B, lane 6). In the same experiment, WT gp78 markedly decreases the level of polyubiquitinated protein after treatment with tunicamycin (Fig. 3B, lanes 3 and 4). These data suggest that gp78-p97/VCP interactions facilitate the removal of ER stress-induced polyubiquitinated proteins. Interestingly, tunicamycin induces time-dependent stabilization of both WT gp78 (Fig. 3, A lanes 4–6, and B, lanes 3 and 4) and gp78ΔC49 (Fig. 3B, lanes 5 and 6) but not gp78CΔRING (Fig. 3A, lanes 7–9). Previous studies have shown that ER stress up-regulates expression of ubiquitination machinery for ERAD at the level of mRNA (39Travers K.J. Patil C.K. Wodicka L. Lockhart D.J. Weissman J.S. Walter P. Cell. 2000; 101: 249-258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1594) Google Scholar, 40Ng D.T. Spear E.D. Walter P. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 77-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). This result reveals an additional level of regulation of ERAD via stabilization of E3 protein. It is worth noting that stabilization of gp78ΔC49 did not lead to decrease of ER stress-induced polyubiquitinated proteins. This is consistent with our notion that gp78-p97/VCP interaction is essential for degradation of poly"
https://openalex.org/W2078391920,"Previous studies on pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells have shown that nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NAADP) evokes highly localized intracellular Ca2+ signals by mobilizing thapsigargin-insensitive stores. Such localized Ca2+ signals may initiate global Ca2+ waves and contraction of the myocytes through the recruitment of ryanodine receptors on the sarcoplasmic reticulum via Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release. Here we show that NAADP evokes localized Ca2+ signals by mobilizing a bafilomycin A1-sensitive, lysosome-related Ca2+ store. These lysosomal stores facilitate this process by co-localizing with a portion of the sarcoplasmic reticulum expressing ryanodine receptors to comprise a highly specialized trigger zone for NAADP-dependent Ca2+ signaling by the vasoconstrictor hormone, endothelin-1. These findings further advance our understanding of how the spatial organization of discrete, organellar Ca2+ stores may underpin the generation of differential Ca2+ signaling patterns by different Ca2+-mobilizing messengers.

These findings further advance our understanding of how the spatial organization of discrete, organellar Ca2+ stores may underpin the generation of differential Ca2+ signaling patterns by different Ca2+-mobilizing messengers. Consideration of the wide variety of processes regulated by changes in intracellular Ca2+ concentration, from fertilization and gene expression to muscle contraction and cell death, can leave us in no doubt of the need for a versatile Ca2+ signaling system (1Berridge M. Lipp P. Bootman M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 1: 11-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (4372) Google Scholar). Consequently, not all stimuli that initiate a given cell response, such as muscle contraction, do so by eliciting Ca2+ signals with a common spatiotemporal pattern (1Berridge M. Lipp P. Bootman M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 1: 11-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (4372) Google Scholar). Conversely, not all stimuli that increase intracellular Ca2+ concentration initiate a common cell response. Thus, Prentki et al. (2Prentki M. Glennon M. Thomas A. Morris R. Matschinsky F. Corkey B. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 11044-11047Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) proposed that “Ca2+ fingerprints” may be generated in an agonist-specific manner. However, the precise mechanisms that underpin stimulus-specific Ca2+ signaling remain obscure.We do know, however, that agonist specificity is determined, in part, by the release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores in a manner dependent on second messengers and their associated Ca2+ release channels. During pharmaco-mechanical coupling in smooth muscle, it has long been accepted that many receptors induce the production of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3), 1The abbreviations used are: IP3, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate; IP3R, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor; SR, sarcoplasmic reticulum; NAADP, nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate; RyR, ryanodine receptor; CICR, Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; ET-1, endothelin-1; PSS, physiological salt solution; GPN, glycyl-l-phenylalanine 2-naphthylamide; ML-9, 1-(5-chloronapthalene-1-sulfonyl)-1H-hexahydro-1,4,diazepine hydrochloride; PGF2α, prostaglandin-F2α. 1The abbreviations used are: IP3, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate; IP3R, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor; SR, sarcoplasmic reticulum; NAADP, nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate; RyR, ryanodine receptor; CICR, Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; ET-1, endothelin-1; PSS, physiological salt solution; GPN, glycyl-l-phenylalanine 2-naphthylamide; ML-9, 1-(5-chloronapthalene-1-sulfonyl)-1H-hexahydro-1,4,diazepine hydrochloride; PGF2α, prostaglandin-F2α. which leads to the activation of one or more of the known IP3 receptor (IP3R) subtypes on the SR and release of Ca2+ from this store (1Berridge M.

Further support for this view has recently been provided by the proposal that NAADP triggers Ca2+ release from reserve granules in sea urchin eggs (17Churchill G. Okada Y. Thomas J. Genazzani A. Patel S. Galione A. Cell. 2002; 111: 703-708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar), the functional equivalent of lysosomes in mammalian cells. However, others have suggested that direct activation of RyRs on the SR/ER may underlie Ca2+ signaling by NAADP (20Hohenegger M. Suko J. Gscheidlinger R. Drobny H. Zidar A. Biochem.

The findings of the present investigation are consistent with the idea that a lysosome-related Ca2+ store is the point of origin of NAADP-mediated Ca2+ bursts and suggest that lysosomes may co-localize with RyRs in the SR of arterial smooth muscle cells to form a “trigger zone” for NAADP-dependent Ca2+ signaling. Our data also lend weight to the argument that NAADP-dependent Ca2+ signals may be evoked in a stimulus-specific manner (19Yamasaki M. Masgrau R. Morgan A.J. Churchill G.C. Patel S. Ashcroft S.J.

The heart and lungs were removed en bloc and placed in physiological salt solution (PSS) of the following composition (mm): 130 NaCl, 5.2 KCl, 1 MgCl2, 1.7 CaCl2, 10 glucose, and 10 Hepes, pH 7.45. Single arterial smooth muscle cells were isolated from second order branches of the pulmonary artery. Briefly, an artery was dissected out and placed in a low Ca2+ solution of the following composition (mm): 124 NaCl, 5 KCl, 1 MgCl2, 0.5 NaH2PO4, 0.5 KH2PO4, 15 NaHCO3, 0.16 CaCl2, 0.5 EDTA, 10 glucose, 10 taurine, and 10 Hepes, pH 7.4. After 10 min, the artery was placed in the same solution containing 0.5 mg/ml papain (Fluka) and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (Sigma), and kept at 4 °C overnight. The following day 0.2 mm 1,4-dithio-dl-threitol (Sigma) was added to the solution, to activate the protease, and the preparation was incubated for 1 h at room temperature. The tissue was then washed three times in fresh low Ca2+ solution without enzymes, and single smooth muscle cells were isolated by gentle trituration with a fire-polished Pasteur pipette. Cells were stored in suspension at 4 °C until required.Ca2+ Imaging—Cells were incubated for 30 min with 5 μm Fura-2-AM in Ca2+ free PSS in an experimental chamber on a Leica DMIRBE inverted microscope and then superfused with Fura-2-free PSS for at least 30 min prior to experimentation. Fura-2 fluorescence was measured using excitation wavelengths of 340 nm (F340) and 380 nm (F380), respectively, and an emission wavelength of 510 nm. Emitted fluorescence was monitored using a Hamamatsu 4880 image-intensifying charge-coupled device camera through a Zeiss Fluar 40×, 1.3-numerical aperture oil immersion lens and recorded and analyzed using Openlab imaging software (Improvision, UK) on an Apple Macintosh G4 personal computer. Fluorescence intensity was measured at ≤0.3 Hz, with background subtraction being carried out on-line. Changes in Fura-2 fluorescence are reported as the F340/F380 ratio.Intracellular Dialysis of NAADP and IP3—Ca2+-mobilizing second messengers were applied intracellularly in the whole cell configuration of the patch clamp technique, and in current clamp mode (I = 0) as described previously (13Boittin F-X. Galione A. Evans A.M. Circ. Res. 2002; 91: 1168-1175Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The pipette solution contained (mm): 140 KCl, 10 Hepes, 1 MgCl2, and 5 μm Fura-2, pH 7.4. The seal resistance, as measured using an Axopatch 200B amplifier (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA), was ≥3 GΩ throughout each experiment. Series resistance was ≤10 mΩ, and pipette resistance was ≤3 mΩ. All experiments were carried out at room temperature (22 °C).Extracellular Application of Pharmacological Agents—For experiments on the effects of intracellular dialysis of NAADP, pharmacological agents (e.g. ryanodine) were applied directly to the bath solution. During investigations into the effects of ET-1, PGF2α, and bafilomycin A1, however, these and other pharmacological agents were applied extracellularly by using a microsuperfusion system via a flow pipe positioned close the cell under investigation, as described previously (23Langton P.D. J. Physiol. 1993; 471: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar).Fluorescent Imaging of Subcellular Labeling by LysoTracker Red and BODIPY-ryanodine—Cells were incubated with 1 μm BODIPY FL-X ryanodine for 60 min, and 0.5–2 nm LysoTracker Red for 30 min. Images were acquired using a Deltavision microscope system (Applied Precision), consisting of an Olympus IX70 inverted microscope with an Olympus PlanApo 60×, 1.40-numerical aperture oil immersion objective and Photometric CH300 charge-coupled device camera. Single Z sections were taken at what was determined to be the center of the cell, or 40-× 0.2-μm sections were taken through the cell. Images were deconvolved and analyzed off-line using Softworx acquisition and analysis software (Applied Precision). In experiments involving glycyl-l-phenylalanine 2-naphthylamide (GPN), cells were pre-treated for 15 min with 10 μm ML-9 to prevent contraction.Measurement of NAADP Levels—Second and third order branches of the pulmonary arterial tree were removed as described above. The arteries were cut open longitudinally, and the endothelium was removed by gently rubbing the lumen with a cotton bud. After 30-min equilibration in PSS at 37 °C, arteries were transferred to either PSS (control), or PSS containing either 1 μm ET-1 or 2 μm PGF2α (test). Removing the buffer and adding ice cold 1.5 m HClO4 terminated the reaction. Tissue was immediately sonicated and left on ice for 20 min. Samples were then centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 10 min, and the supernatant was removed. The pellet was retained to determine protein content. The supernatant was then neutralized with 2 m KHCO3 and left for a further 20 min on ice before being centrifuged as before to remove the KClO4 precipitate. Samples were stored at –80 °C.NAADP levels were subsequently assayed via a radioreceptor assay as previously described (21Masgrau R. Churchill G.C. Morgan A.J. Ashcroft S.J.H. Galione A. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 247-251Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Briefly, enzymatically synthesized 32P-labeled NAADP, 1.25% sea urchin (Lytechinus pictus) egg homogenate, and samples versus known concentrations of NAADP were incubated for 15 min at room temperature in intracellular-like buffer of the following composition (mm): 250 N-methylglucamine, 250 potassium gluconate, 20 Hepes, 1 MgCl2, pH 7.2. The binding reaction was terminated by rapid filtration (Brandell cell harvester) through GF/B filters (Whatman) with ice-cold buffer of the following composition (mm): 10 Hepes, 1 EDTA, pH 7.2. Bound NAADP was determined by using Cerenkov spectrometry.Data Analysis—Data are expressed as mean ± S.E. for n experiments. Differences were detected by use of a Student's unpaired t test.Drugs and Chemicals—Ryanodine, thapsigargin, IP3, NAADP, bafilomycin A1, GPN, ET-1, PGF2α, and ML-9 were obtained from Sigma. Fura-2-AM, BODIPY FL-X ryanodine, and LysoTracker Red were obtained from Molecular Probes. NAD (32P-radiolabeled) was obtained from Amersham Biosciences. Stock solutions of ryanodine, thapsigargin, ML-9, and GPN were made with Me2SO as the solvent. The minimum dilution of Me2SO was 1:1000 in PSS, at which concentration Me2SO alone was without effect on the responsiveness of the preparation. All other stock solutions were made in distilled H2O before further dilution in PSS.RESULTSNAADP Induces “Ca2+ Bursts” from a Bafilomycin-insensitive, Lysosome-related Ca2+ Store—Clearly, further investigations on NAADP-dependent Ca2+ signaling in arterial smooth muscle were required to advance our understanding of the fundamental mechanisms that control blood pressure, and cell function in general. To this end NAADP was applied intracellularly into isolated pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells from a patch pipette, in the whole cell configuration and under current clamp conditions (I = 0). Changes in intracellular Ca2+ were reported by the fluorescence ratio (F340/F380) of the Ca2+ indicator, Fura-2. At a concentration of 10 nm, NAADP induced a global increase in the Fura-2 fluorescence ratio, from 0.7 ± 0.1 to 1.9 ± 0.1 (n = 17) in isolated pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells. These effects occurred within 180 s of entering the whole-cell configuration (Fig. 1A). In paired cells, intracellular dialysis of NAADP-free pipette solution had little or no effect (n = 17; not shown). Our findings are consistent with the view that the events leading up to the initiation of global Ca2+ waves by NAADP are complex, in that there is a highly localized release of Ca2+, which precedes the global Ca2+ waves and the associated contractile response (13Boittin F-X. Galione A. Evans A.M. Circ. Res. 2002; 91: 1168-1175Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). In general, this initial localized Ca2+ release event appears as 1) a uniform increase in Fura-2 fluorescence ratio around the entire perimeter of the cell (Fig. 2A, panel i) and 2) a spatially restricted “focal” Ca2+ signal covering an area of between 2 and 10 μm in diameter (Figs. 1A and 2A, panel ii). These localized Ca2+ signals initiated by NAADP have been named “Ca2+ bursts” (13Boittin F-X. Galione A. Evans A.M. Circ. Res. 2002; 91: 1168-1175Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) and either decline back to basal levels or trigger a global Ca2+ wave (Fig. 1A). Previously, we have shown that NAADP induces Ca2+ bursts from a thapsigargin-insensitive store other than the SR and that these local Ca2+ signals are then amplified by subsequent CICR from the SR via RyRs (13Boittin F-X. Galione A. Evans A.M. Circ. Res. 2002; 91: 1168-1175Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). We therefore investigated the possibility that the NAADP-sensitive Ca2+ store in vascular smooth muscle is an acidic, lysosome-related store as previously suggested by investigations on other cell types (17Churchill G. Okada Y. Thomas J. Genazzani A. Patel S. Galione A. Cell. 2002; 111: 703-708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar, 19Yamasaki M. Masgrau R. Morgan A.J. Churchill G.C.

A, pseudocolor images of the Fura-2 fluorescence ratio recorded in isolated pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells showing the two forms of Ca2+ burst elicited by intracellular dialysis of 10 nm NAADP: i, a uniform increase in Ca2+ around the entire perimeter of the cell; ii, a spatially localized focal Ca2+ release event. In B: panel i, bright field image of an isolated pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cell. ii, deconvolved Z section through the same cell as in panel i shows lysosomes labeled with LysoTracker Red; note, lysosomes cluster to form a ring around the perimeter of the cell consistent with the form of Ca2+ burst in (A, panel i).

In A (panels i and ii), B, and C, respectively, images were from different cells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)It has been demonstrated that Ca2+ uptake into lysosome-related organelles is driven by proton gradients maintained by vacuolar proton pumps (V-H+ ATPase (24Haller T. Dietl P. Deetjen P. Volkl H. Cell Calcium. 1996; 19: 157-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 25Christensen K.A. Myers J.T. Swanson J.A. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 599-607Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)). Thus, we investigated the effect of the V-H+ ATPase inhibitor bafilomycin A1 on NAADP-induced Ca2+ signals. Extracellular application of bafilomycin A1 (100–300 nm) induced a global increase in Fura-2 fluorescence ratio from 0.63 ± 0.05 to 1.04 ± 0.07, which declined back to baseline within 45 min (n = 20; Figs. 1B and 4F). We therefore proceeded to study the effect on NAADP-induced Ca2+ signals of bafilomycin A1. Preincubation (45 min) of pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells with 100 nm bafilomycin A1 blocked Ca2+ signals induced by the intracellular application of NAADP (10 nm, n = 7; Fig. 1C). In stark contrast, extracellular application of caffeine (2 mm) induced an increase in the Fura-2 fluorescence ratio from 0.64 ± 0.05 to 2.58 ± 0.02 (n = 4) in the absence of bafilomycin A1 and from 0.71 ± 0.02 to 2.18 ± 0.06 (n = 4) in the presence of bafilomycin A1. Similarly, intracellular dialysis of IP3 (1 μm) increased the Fura-2 fluorescence ratio from 0.61 ± 0.04 to 1.83 ± 0.38 (n = 4) in the absence of bafilomycin A1 and from 0.68 ± 0.06 to 2.22 ± 0.19 (n = 4) in the presence of bafilomycin A1 (Fig. 1D). These data suggest that bafilomycin A1 blocks Ca2+ mobilization by NAADP without affecting Ca2+ release from the SR through either RyRs or IP3Rs.Fig. 4ET-1 triggers Ca2+ release from lysosome-related organelles via NAADP.

Abbreviations: baf., bafilomycin; thap., thapsigargin; ryan., ryanodine.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Next we compared the pharmacology of global Ca2+ signals initiated by bafilomycin A1 and NAADP. When cells were incubated (15 min) with thapsigargin (1 μm), both bafilomycin A1 (100–300 nm) and NAADP (10 nm) failed to induce global Ca2+ signals and contraction. However, upon intracellular dialysis of NAADP, small amplitude, spatially restricted Ca2+ bursts were observed (Fig. 1E), as previously reported (13Boittin F-X. Galione A. Evans A.M. Circ. Res. 2002; 91: 1168-1175Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Similar results were observed by extracellular application of bafilomycin A1, in that small spatially restricted and asynchronous Ca2+ transients were observed in 8 out of 11 cells (Fig. 1F). The localized thapsigargin-insensitive Ca2+ bursts evoked by NAADP (10 nm) and spatially restricted Ca2+ release observed with bafilomycin A1 (100–300 nm) represented a local increase in the F340/F380 ratio within a given region of interest of 27 ± 3% (n = 8; see Fig. 4F below) and 25 ± 4% (n = 11; Fig. 4F), respectively. Similar results to those obtained in thapsigargin-treated cells were obtained by treating cells with ryanodine (20 μm). Following incubation (15 min) with ryanodine, NAADP (100 nm) and bafilomycin A1 (100 nm) again failed to induce global Ca2+ signals, and no cell contraction was observed. Once more, however, low amplitude, spatially restricted Ca2+ bursts were triggered by NAADP (Fig. 1G; n = 8), while bafilomycin A1 triggered spatially restricted Ca2+ signals in 5 out of 8 cells (Fig. 1H). The localized Ca2+ signals induced by NAADP (10 nm) and bafilomycin A1 (100 nm) in ryanodine-treated cells represented increases in the F340/F380 ratio of 33 ± 7% (n = 9; Fig. 4F) and 28 ± 3% (n = 8; Fig. 4F), respectively. These findings are consistent with the view that bafilomycin A1 and NAADP mobilize Ca2+ from a common thapsigargin- and ryanodine-insensitive acidic Ca2+ store.Lysosomes Form Tight Clusters in Pulmonary Arterial Smooth Muscle Cells—We next investigated the distribution of acidic stores/lysosomes within arterial smooth muscle cells using LysoTracker Red, a fluorescent weak base that accumulates in acidic compartments. Deconvolved images of Z sections (0.2 μm depth) through single isolated pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells labeled with LysoTracker Red fluorescence (excitation 568 nm, emission 590 nm) revealed dense regions of labeling. As mentioned previously, upon analysis of pseudocolor images of the change in Fura-2 fluorescence ratio with time, two forms of initial Ca2+ burst were observed in response to intracellular application of NAADP: 1) a relatively uniform increase in Ca2+ around the entire perimeter of the cell (Fig. 2A, panel i; n = 4) or 2) a spatially restricted “focal” Ca2+ signal covering an area of between 2 and 10 μm in diameter (Fig. 2A, panel ii; n = 6 (13Boittin F-X. Galione A. Evans A.M. Circ. Res. 2002; 91: 1168-1175Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar)). Consistent with the spatial distribution of these two forms of local Ca2+ signal, the dense regions of LysoTracker Red labeling observed in pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells appeared as either: 1) a relatively uniform ring around the perimeter of the cell that was ∼2 μm across (Fig. 2B, panels i and ii; n = 5) or 2) a tight, spatially restricted unit ∼2–6 μm across (Fig. 2C, panels i and ii; n = 6). To determine whether or not the labeled organelles were lysosome-related, cells were incubated with GPN, a substrate of the lysosomal exopeptidase cathepsin C that selectively disrupts lysosomes by osmotic lysis (26Berg T. Stromhaug E. Lovdal T. Seglen O. Berg T. Biochem. J. 1994; 300: 229-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). To achieve this goal, cells were first incubated for 15 min with the selective inhibitor of myosin light-chain kinase 1-(5-chloronapthalene-1-sulfonyl)-1H-hexahydro-1,4,diazepine hydrochloride (ML-9 (27Ito M. Tanabe F. Sato A. Ishida E. Takami Y. Shigeta S. Int. J. Immunopharmacol. 1989; 11: 185-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar)) to prevent disruption of the spatial orientation of cells due to contraction by GPN. Under these conditions, GPN (200 μm) eliminated LysoTracker Red labeling in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 2B, panels i–v) consistent with these organelles being lysosome-related. Tight lysosomal clusters were seen to occupy a volume of 27.5 ± 10 μm3 within the cells from which volume measurements were taken (n = 3, Fig. 2C). These results suggest that lysosome-related organelles form dense clusters that may provide a Ca2+ store with a high degree of spatial organization in arterial smoot"

The ligand recognition structure of ficolins is contained within a fibrinogen-like domain. We examined the selectivity of the ficolins through inhibiting the binding to bacteria or to beads coupled with N-acetylglucosamine. The binding of L-ficolin to Streptococcus pneumoniae 11F and the beads was inhibited by N-acetylated sugars and not by non-acetylated sugars. However, it was also inhibited by other acetylated compounds. Based on this selectivity L-ficolin is not easily defined as a lectin.

Based on the selectivity of L-ficolin we developed a new purification procedure involving affinity chromatography on N-acetylcysteine-derivatized Sepharose.

The immune system is comprised of innate and adaptive defense mechanisms. The innate immune system prevents or limits the early stages of an infection and is further involved in the orchestration of the ensuing adaptive immune response (1Medzhitov R. Janeway Jr., C.A.

The complement system can be activated through three different pathways; they are the classical, the alternative, and the mannan binding lectin (MBL) 1The abbreviations used are: MBL, mannan binding lectin; fbg, fibrinogen-like; MASP, MBL-associated serine protease; CysNAc, N-acetylcysteine; TL, tachylectins; ManN, mannosamine; GalN, galactosamine; GalNAc, N-acetylgalactosamine; TBS, Tris-buffered saline; PEG, polyethylene glycol.1The abbreviations used are: MBL, mannan binding lectin; fbg, fibrinogen-like; MASP, MBL-associated serine protease; CysNAc, N-acetylcysteine; TL, tachylectins; ManN, mannosamine; GalN, galactosamine; GalNAc, N-acetylgalactosamine; TBS, Tris-buffered saline; PEG, polyethylene glycol. pathways. All three pathways merge in the formation of a C3 convertase, C4bC2b for the classical and the MBL pathway and C3bBb for the alternative pathway. MBL circulates in complex with four different proteins, three MBL-associated serine proteases (MASPs) (MASP-1, -2, -3) and a smaller protein MAp19 or sMAP (2Matsushita M. Fujita T. J. Exp.

The polypeptide chains of the ficolins are, like those of MBL, comprised of different structural regions, an N-terminal region, a collagen-like region, and a globular domain (10Matsushita M. Endo Y. Taira S. Sato Y. Fujita T. Ichikawa N. Nakata M. Mizuochi T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2448-2454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Compared with MBL the main structural difference is the lack of an α-helical region and a globular domain which is a fibrinogen-like (fbg) domain rather than the C-type lectin domain of MBL (11Ichijo H. Hellman U. Wernstedt C. Gonez L.J. Claesson-Welsh L. Heldin C.H. Miyazono K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14505-14513Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Like MBL, L-ficolin and H-ficolin are capable of forming trimeric subunits, which associate into oligomers comprised of up to 4 and 6 trimers, respectively (12Lu J. Le Y. Immunobiology. 1998; 199: 190-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 13Yae Y. Inaba S. Sato H. Okochi K. Tokunaga F. Iwanaga S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1078: 369-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Like MBL, L-ficolin and H-ficolin circulate in complex with MASPs and are capable of activating the complement system (14Matsushita M. Endo Y. Fujita T. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 2281-2284Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 15Matsushita M. Endo Y. Hamasaki N. Fujita T. Int.

Immunol. 2002; 168: 3502-3506Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Because of the structural, biochemical, and functional similarities to MBL, the ficolins are also believed to be involved in the innate immune defense as pattern recognition molecules, but so far little is known about their possible antimicrobial properties. L-ficolin has been demonstrated to activate complement upon binding to Salmonella typhimurium and lipoteichoic acids (14Matsushita M. Endo Y. Fujita T. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 2281-2284Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 17Lynch N.J. Roscher S. Hartung T. Morath S. Matsushita M. Maennel D.N. Kuraya M. Fujita T. Schwaeble W.J. J. Immunol. 2004; 172: 1198-1202Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). H-ficolin has been shown to activate complement (16Matsushita M. Kuraya M. Hamasaki N. Tsujimura M. Shiraki H. Fujita T. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 3502-3506Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) and to inhibit the growth of an Aerococcus viridans strain (7Tsujimura M. Miyazaki T. Kojima E. Sagara Y. Shiraki H. Okochi K. Maeda Y. Clin. Chim. Acta. 2002; 325: 139-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The ligands for the ficolins have been suggested to be monosaccharides (18Le Y. Lee S.H. Kon O.L. Lu J. FEBS Lett. 1998; 425: 367-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 19Sugimoto R. Yae Y. Akaiwa M. Kitajima S. Shibata Y. Sato H. Hirata J. Okochi K. Izuhara K. Hamasaki N. J. Biol.

Beisel H.G. Fuentes-Prior P. Tsuda R. Muta T. Iwanaga S. Bode W. Huber R. Kawabata S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13519-13524Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). We now report further investigations of the specificity of the human ficolins partly conflicting with published results. Based on the knowledge acquired we developed a new method for the purification of L-ficolin. Glucose (Glc), glucosamine (GlcN), GlcNAc, mannose (Man), mannosamine (ManN), N-acetylmannosamine, galactose (Gal), galactosamine (GalN), N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc), glycine, N-acetylglycine, N-acetylcysteine (CysNAc), acetylsalicylic acid, and acetylcholine were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. A 300 mm stock solution of these compounds was made in 20 mm Tris-HCl, 140 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm NaN3, pH 7.4 (TBS) with 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20 and 5 mm CaCl2 (TBS/Tw/Ca). The pH was adjusted with 5 n NaOH to pH 7.4 if needed. Sepharose 4B CL beads (Amersham Biosciences) were derivatized with GlcNAc and CysNAc. The beads were activated with divinyl sulfone by incubation with 10% (v/v) divinyl sulfone (Sigma-Aldrich) in 0.5 m Na2CO3, pH 11, for 1.5 h at room temperature. The beads were washed with 0.25 m Na2CO3, pH 11, and derivatized in 0.25 m Na2CO3 containing 10% (w/v) GlcNAc or CysNAc at pH 11 overnight at room temperature. The beads were washed with H2O, and residual active groups were blocked by incubation with 0.1 m ethanolamine, pH 9.0. The derivatized beads were washed with TBS and stored at 4 °C. We also used bacteria as ligands. The bacteria were grown in Todd-Hewitt broth medium (Oxoid, Basingstoke, Great Britain) at 5% CO2 or in L-Broth medium (Q-biogene, Carlsbad, CA) overnight at 37 °C for Streptococcus pneumoniae 11F (Statens Serum Institut, Copenhagen, Denmark) and A. viridans 86965 (21Dagnaes-Hansen F. Kilian M. Fuursted K. Lab. Anim. 2004; 38: 321-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), respectively. Formaldehyde (Sigma-Aldrich) was added to the broth cultures to a final concentration of 1% (w/v) and kept at room temperature until the next day. Residual reactive aldehyde groups were blocked by incubating for 1 h with 0.1 volumes of 1 m ethanolamine, pH 9.0, and the bacteria were washed three times with TBS and stored at 4 °C. Ficolins were purified as described (14Matsushita M. Endo Y. Fujita T. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 2281-2284Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Antibodies used for Western blotting were monoclonal mouse antibody 1E2 directed against the A chain of MASP-1 (since the A chain is shared by MASP-1 and MASP-3, this is an anti-MASP-1/3 antibody) (22Terai I. Kobayashi K. Matsushita M. Fujita T. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 1997; 110: 317-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), monoclonal rat antibody 6G12 raised against MAp19 (since the domains of MAp19 and the first two domains of MASP-2 are identical, this is an anti-MAp19/MASP-2 antibody) (23Moller-Kristensen M. Jensenius J.C. Jensen L. Thielens N. Rossi V. Arlaud G. Thiel S. J. Immunol. Methods. 2003; 282: 159-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), and polyclonal rabbit-anti-L-ficolin antibody (16Matsushita M. Kuraya M. Hamasaki N. Tsujimura M. Shiraki H. Fujita T. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 3502-3506Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Monoclonal anti-L-ficolin antibody (2F5) (6Taira S. Kodama N. Matsushita M. Fujita T. Fukushima J. Med. Sci. 2000; 46: 13-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) was biotinylated with 167 μg of biotinyl-N-hydroxysuccinimide (Sigma-Aldrich) per mg of protein. The monoclonal anti-H-ficolin antibody (19Sugimoto R. Yae Y. Akaiwa M. Kitajima S. Shibata Y. Sato H. Hirata J. Okochi K. Izuhara K. Hamasaki N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20721-20727Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar) (4H5, HyCult Biotechnology, PB Uden, The Netherlands) was biotinylated with 33 μg of biotinyl-N-hydroxysuccinimide per mg of protein since loss of activity was observed at a higher degree of biotinylation. Inhibition Assay—GlcNAc beads (13-μl packed volume) or 4.5 × 108A. viridans or S. pneumoniae was mixed with 6 μl of serum (containing 5 μg of L-ficolin and 20 μg of H-ficolin/ml) and further mixed with the inhibitors to give final inhibitor concentrations of 100, 50, 25, 12.5, 3, and 1 mm. The volume was adjusted to 300 μl with TBS/Tw/Ca, and the samples were incubated for 2 h at room temperature and centrifuged (100 × g for beads and 10,000 × g for bacteria, 5 min). The supernatants were dialyzed using Slide-A-Lyzer MINI Dialysis units (Pierce) against TBS/Tw/Ca overnight at room temperature, and the amount of L-ficolin and H-ficolin was estimated by the assays described below. Quantification of L-ficolin and H-ficolin—FluoroNunc microtiter wells (Nunc, Kamstrup, Denmark) were coated with 100 ng of anti-Lficolin antibody (6Taira S. Kodama N. Matsushita M. Fujita T. Fukushima J. Med. Sci. 2000; 46: 13-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) (GN5, HyCult Biotechnology) or anti-H-ficolin (4H5) in 100 μl of 137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 1.5 mm KH2PO4, 8.1 mm Na2HPO4, pH 7.4 (phosphate-buffered saline). After incubation overnight at 4 °C the wells were blocked by 200 μg of human serum albumin (Statens Serum Institut) in 200 μl of TBS (1 h, room temperature) and washed 3 times with TBS/Tw/Ca. Samples of 100 μl were added to the wells followed by incubation overnight at 4 °C, washing, and the addition of 100 ng of biotinylated anti-L-ficolin or 25 ng of biotinylated anti-H-ficolin antibody in 100 μl of TBS/Tw/Ca. After incubation for 1 h at room temperature and washing, 10 ng of Eu-labeled streptavidin (Wallac, Turku, Finland) in 100 μl of TBS/Tw, 25 μm EDTA was added followed by incubation for 1 h and washing. The europium bound in the wells was measured by adding 200 μl of enhancement solution (Wallac) and reading the signal by time resolved fluorometry on a 1232 Delfia fluorometer (Wallac). Binding to N-Acetylcysteine-derivatized Beads—The beads, produced as described above, were incubated in buffer with an equal volume of a 4–8% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 6000 (PEG) (Fluka, Buchs SG, Switzerland) cut from serum (described under “Purification of L-ficolin”). The buffer contained 10 mm Tris-HCl, 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20, 2-fold dilutions of NaCl starting at 1 m, and 2 mm CaCl2 or 5 mm EDTA. The samples were incubated overnight at 4 °C and centrifuged (100 × g, 5 min), and the amount of L-ficolin in the supernatant was quantified. Purification of L-ficolin—Citrated donor plasma was coagulated by the addition of 1 m CaCl2 to a final concentration of 5 mm and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h, and the serum was collected. To establish the concentration of PEG needed for the precipitation of L-ficolin, PEG was dissolved in TBS/Tw/Ca to concentrations of 4, 8, 12, 16, and 20% (w/v), and equal volumes of serum and PEG solutions were mixed, incubated for 30 min, and centrifuged (1000 × g, 5 min). The amounts of MBL (24Christiansen O.B. Kilpatrick D.C. Souter V. Varming K. Thiel S. Jensenius J.C. Scand J. Immunol. 1999; 49: 193-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), C1q (25Thiel S. Petersen S.V. Vorup-Jensen T. Matsushita M. Fujita T. Stover C.M. Schwaeble W.J. Jensenius J.C. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 878-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), L-ficolin, and H-ficolin in the supernatants were quantified. Based on the results, the following procedure for initial purification of L-ficolin was adopted; a solution of 24% (w/v) PEG was added to 900 ml of serum to a final concentration of 4% (w/v) PEG. After incubation for 30 min at room temperature the mixture was centrifuged (1000 × g, 5 min), and the supernatant was collected. PEG (24% (w/v)) was added to the supernatant to obtain a final concentration of 8% (w/v). The mixture was incubated and centrifuged as before. The supernatant was discarded, and the pellet (the 4–8% PEG cut) was dissolved in 200 ml of 500 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm NaN3, 2 mm EDTA, 0.01% (v/v) polyoxyethylene 10 tridecyl ether (Emulfogen, Sigma-Aldrich) (loading buffer) and loaded onto an 8-ml column of N-acetylcysteine beads at 0.5 ml/min. After washing with loading buffer until base-line absorbance was reached, bound L-ficolin was eluted with 10 mm Tris-HCl, 20 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm NaN3, 2 mm EDTA, 0.01% (v/v) Emulfogen. The amount of L-ficolin was quantified, and the fractions with the highest contents were pooled and passed onto a 1-ml Mono Q column (Amersham Biosciences). The bound material was eluted by a 20-ml NaCl gradient from 50 to 500 mm, and the fractions containing L-ficolin were identified and pooled. SDS-PAGE and Western Blotting—Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (4–20% acrylamide gradient) under reducing and non-reducing conditions followed by silver staining of the proteins (26Nesterenko M.V. Tilley M. Upton S.J. J. Biochem. Biophys. Methods. 1994; 28: 239-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar), or the proteins in the gel were electroblotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Amersham Biosciences). The blots were probed with the antibodies described above followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark) and subsequently incubated with enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) solution (12.5 mm luminol, 0.01% (v/v) H2O2, 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5). Gel Permeation Chromatography—To compare the size of L-ficolin found in serum and the purified preparation, 50 μl of serum or 20 μgof purified L-ficolin was fractionated on a Superose 6 column (10 mm, 30 cm) (Amersham Biosciences) with TBS, 0.01% (v/v) Tween 20, and 5 mm calcium as running buffer. A standard curve comprised of thyroglobulin (Mr 670), ferritin (Mr 450), catalase (Mr 240), aldolase (Mr 170), human serum albumin (Mr 80), and ovalbumin (Mr 67 kDa) was constructed. Sequence Alignment—The primary sequence alignment in this study was performed with ClustalW (www.ebi.ac.uk/clustalw, European Bioinformatics Institute, Heidelberg, Germany). The accession numbers in the NCBI data base used for the primary sequences were for tachylectin 5A (1JC9A), L-ficolin (NP_004099), M-ficolin (O00602), and for H-ficolin (NP_003656). GlcNAc and A. viridans have previously been described as ligands for L-ficolin and H-ficolin, respectively. We examined the inhibitory potential of various compounds toward L-ficolin and H-ficolin binding, and clear differences were seen. Fig. 1 shows the amount of L-ficolin and H-ficolin bound to GlcNAc-beads and A. viridans, respectively, in the presence of different inhibitors. Fig. 1 shows examples of inhibition curves, whereas Table I summarizes all inhibition data. GlcNAc and N-acetyl-mannosamine seem to be the most potent inhibitors of L-ficolin, whereas GalNAc, CysNAc, N-acetylglycine, and acetylcholine are about half as potent. The results suggest that acetylated compounds in general inhibit L-ficolin. When the experiments were repeated with S. pneumoniae 11F (previously described as ligand for L-ficolin) instead of GlcNAc beads, it was again found that acetylated carbohydrates inhibit the binding (I50 for Glc-NAc, N-acetylmannosamine, and GalNAc was determined to 27, 31, and 24 mm, respectively), whereas non-acetylated do not. In the case of H-ficolin none of the compounds tested showed inhibitory activity.Table II50 values of MBL and ficolin bindingInhibitorMBLL-ficolinH-ficolinI50I50 relativeI50I50 relativeI50I50 relativemmmmmmGlucose500.32NI0NI0GlucosamineNI0NI0NI0N-Acetylglucoseamine161211NI0Mannose210.76NI0NI0MannosamineNI0NI0NI0N-Acetylmannosamine260.62211NI0GalactoseNI0NI0NI0GalactosamineNI0NI0NI0N-AcetylgalactosamineNI0420.5NI0Glycine0NI0NI0N-Acetylglycine0560.38NI0N-Acetylcysteine0460.46NI0Acetylsalicylic acid0NI0NI0Acetylcholine0770.27NI0 Open table in a new tab Based on the results obtained by the inhibition experiments, we developed a purification procedure for L-ficolin. Sepharose 4B was derivatized with acetylated compounds. When the potential of the beads for binding L-ficolin were compared, Cys-NAc beads were found to have more than twice the capacity of GlcNAc beads (results not shown). Because MBL is known also to bind to GlcNAc beads, we chose to use CysNAc beads for the purification of L-ficolin. As a first step L-ficolin was precipitated from serum by adding PEG. Fig. 2 shows the amount of L-ficolin, H-ficolin, MBL, and C1q that remained in the supernatant after precipitation at increasing concentrations of PEG. Because ∼80% of L-ficolin remains in the supernatant after 4% PEG while the amount of both MBL and C1q was reduced dramatically, we decided to make a 4–8% PEG cut for the purification of L-ficolin. The ability of L-ficolin in the 4–8% PEG cut to bind to CysNAc beads was examined. Fig. 3 shows the amount of L-ficolin bound at increasing salt concentrations in the presence or absence of calcium. When calcium was present all the L-ficolin was bound independent of the NaCl concentration. This binding was partially inhibitable by GlcNAc (not shown). In the presence of EDTA the binding was markedly dependent of the NaCl concentration. When incubating with EDTA in the presence of 1 or 0.5 m NaCl all the L-ficolin was bound, whereas much less was bound at lower NaCl concentrations. For the following larger scale purification we decided to allow L-ficolin to bind to the CysNAc beads in a buffer with 0.5 m NaCl and 2 mm EDTA followed by elution at low ionic strength (20 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA). Fig. 4A shows the loading and elution profile when applying the 4–8% PEG cut from 900 ml of serum onto the 8 ml of CysNAc column. Clearly the capacity of the column was not exceeded. L-ficolin was eluted after changing the high salt buffer to low salt buffer. After eluting with 20 mm NaCl the L-ficolin-containing fractions were pooled, and the proteins were further fractionated on a Mono Q ion exchange column. L-ficolin was found in two peaks (Fig. 4B), one smaller at ∼80 mm of NaCl and a major eluting between 150 and 200 mm salt. Analysis by SDS-PAGE revealed no difference between the L-ficolin composition in the two peaks, except from contaminations with unidentified protein in peak 1(not shown). Matsushita et al. (10Matsushita M. Endo Y. Taira S. Sato Y. Fujita T. Ichikawa N. Nakata M. Mizuochi T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2448-2454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar) found L-ficolin to elute at an ionic strength comparable with that of peak 2. Peak 2 was pooled an analyzed by size chromatography and SDS-PAGE. Fig. 4C shows size chromatography of the purified L-ficolin and of serum where the fractions were analyzed for L-ficolin. The size of the purified L-ficolin was found to be ∼650 kDa and in accordance with the size observed for L-ficolin in serum. Serum also revealed a minor peak of L-ficolin eluting at 150 kDa, likely representing lower oligomeric forms. Analysis of ion exchange peak 2 by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting is shown in Fig. 5A. Duplicate gels were run; one was silver-stained, whereas the other was blotted and developed with polyclonal rabbit anti-L-ficolin antibody. When the sample was analyzed under reducing conditions, a band of 35 kDa representing the polypeptide chain of L-ficolin appeared upon silver staining (Fig. 5A, lane 1). When the sample was analyzed under non-reducing conditions, four bands appeared, two >250 kDa, one ∼35 kDa, and a weak band ∼45 kDa (lane 2). The bands above 250 kDa and the band around 35 kDa were identified as L-ficolin when an identical gel was blotted and probed with anti-L-ficolin antibody. The high molecular mass bands represent L-ficolin oligomers, whereas the band at 35 kDa represents non-covalently associated L-ficolin peptide chains. The weak band around 45 kDa (lane 4) was not developed by anti-L-ficolin antibodies and was not identified. L-ficolin obtained by the present purification method was compared with L-ficolin prepared by the previously published method (Fig. 5B) (14Matsushita M. Endo Y. Fujita T. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 2281-2284Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). In Fig. 5B the odd numbered lanes show L-ficolin prepared as previously described, and the even numbered lanes show the present preparation of L-ficolin. Lanes 1 and 2 were developed with anti-L-ficolin antibody. The two bands appearing in the present preparation correspond in size to the L-ficolin peptide chain (35 kDa) and the oligomeric complex (>250 kDa). In lane 1 bands appear at around 35, 200, and 250 kDa and one larger than 250 kDa. The 35-kDa band corresponds to the L-ficolin peptide chain, whereas the band above 250 kDa represents the fully covalently linked oligomeric L-ficolin. On a high resolution gel, as in Fig. 5A, this >250-kDa band may spilt up into two bands. The bands at 200 and 250 kDa may be degradations products of oligomeric L-ficolin. In our preparation (lane 2) only the largest band of more than 250 kDa and the 35-kDa band appear. The relative amounts of the lower order oligomers increased upon storage at 4 °C, indicating proteolytic degradation, and no such degradation was observed upon storage of L-ficolin purified according to the present procedure. L-ficolin purified from serum by analytical affinity chromatography on antibody-coated microtiter wells and analyzed immediately afterward showed a distribution identical to that of L-ficolin purified by the present procedure (not shown). The band at 35-kDa seen in all preparations presumably represents non-covalently linked single L-ficolin polypeptide chains. We have previously experienced that the MASPs dissociate from MBL in the presence of EDTA only at high ionic strength (25Thiel S. Petersen S.V. Vorup-Jensen T. Matsushita M. Fujita T. Stover C.M. Schwaeble W.J. Jensenius J.C. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 878-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), and experiments on gel permeation chromatography on serum revealed that both EDTA and high salt concentration is required to release MASP-2 from complexes (27Cseh S. Vera L. Matsushita M. Fujita T. Arlaud G.J. Thielens N.M. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 5735-5743Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). To analyze directly the interaction with ficolin, we studied the influence of NaCl concentrations on L-ficolin-MASP-2 and H-ficolin-MASP-2 complexes. The ficolin-MASP complexes from serum were bound onto antibody-coated microtiter wells. The serum was diluted in buffers of various ionic strengths followed by the detection of MASP-2 with europium-labeled monoclonal anti-MASP-2 antibody. We found that MASP-2 was eluted from L-ficolin and H-ficolin in buffers containing 500 mm NaCl and EDTA but not when the buffers contained 500 mm NaCl and calcium. In accordance with this, the procedure described here involving the use of EDTA-containing high salt buffer yielded L-ficolin devoid of MASPs as determined by Western blotting (Fig. 5B). On the other hand L-ficolin prepared by the previously described method (14Matsushita M. Endo Y. Fujita T. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 2281-2284Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar) contained MASPs. With anti-MASP-1/3 antibody (Fig. 5B, lane 3 and 4) three bands are seen in lane 3 at 110, 85, and 75 kDa. The 110- and 85-kDa bands correspond to full-length MASP-3 and full-length MASP-1, respectively. The 75-kDa band corresponds to the MASP-1/3 A chain. When probing with anti-MAp19/MASP-2 antibodies (Fig. 5B, lane 5 and 6) bands developed in lane 5 at around 75, 55, 40, and 35 kDa. The 75-kDa band corresponds to full-length MASP-2. The 55-, 40-, and 35-kDa bands represent degradation products of MASP-2. The specificity of the two pattern recognition molecules, L-ficolin and H-ficolin, was examined and also compared with the results of our previous investigation of MBL. The results show striking differences in ligand selectivity. MBL is inhibited by all the sugars with horizontal C3-OH and C4-OH groups. As previously reported L-ficolin was inhibited by GlcNAc and Gal-NAc (18Le Y. Lee S.H. Kon O.L. Lu J. FEBS Lett. 1998; 425: 367-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). However, the inhibition by the acetyl group was found to be independent of the hexose structure. Acetyl groups attached to a hexose ring (N-acetylmannosamine, GlcNAc, and GalNAc) as well as acetyl groups on cysteine, glycine, and choline were all efficient inhibitors (Table I). Ma et al. (28Ma Y.G. Cho M.H. Zhao M. Park J.W. Matsushita M. Fujita T. Lee B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 25307-25312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) recently described the binding of L-ficolin to β-1,3 glycans (curdlan). However, the precise ligand structure was not identified (28Ma Y.G. Cho M.H. Zhao M. Park J.W. Matsushita M. Fujita T. Lee B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 25307-25312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Another unidentified L-ficolin binding structure is generated by CNBr activation of Sepharose beads (29Le Y. Tan S.M. Lee S.H"
https://openalex.org/W2161127226,"The molecular mechanisms underlying “kiss and run” or “cavicapture” exocytosis of dense core secretory vesicles are presently unclear. Although dynamin-1 has previously been implicated in the recapture process in neurons, the recruitment of this fission protein to a single exocytosing vesicle has not been examined in real time during peptide release from pancreatic β-cells. Imaged simultaneously in clonal insulin-secreting cells by dual color total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy, monomeric red fluorescent protein (mRFP)-tagged neuropeptide Y and green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged synaptotagmin-1 or synaptobrevin-2 rapidly diffused from sites of exocytosis, whereas the vesicle membrane protein phogrin and tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) were retained, consistent with fusion pore closure. Vesicle recovery frequently involved the recruitment of enhanced GFP-tagged dynamin-1, and GTPase-defective dynamin-1(K44E) increased the dwell time of tPA-mRFP at the plasma membrane. By contrast, recruitment of GFP chimeras of clathrin, epsin, and amphiphysin was not observed. Expression of dynamin-1(K535A), mutated in the pleckstrin homology domain, caused the apparent full fusion of vesicles, as reported by the additional release of tPA-mRFP (15-nm diameter) and enhanced GFP-tagged phogrin. We conclude that re-uptake of vesicles after peptide release by cavicapture corresponds to a novel form of endocytosis in which dynamin-1 stabilizes and eventually closes the fusion pore, with no requirement for “classical” endocytosis for retreat from the plasma membrane. The molecular mechanisms underlying “kiss and run” or “cavicapture” exocytosis of dense core secretory vesicles are presently unclear. Although dynamin-1 has previously been implicated in the recapture process in neurons, the recruitment of this fission protein to a single exocytosing vesicle has not been examined in real time during peptide release from pancreatic β-cells. Imaged simultaneously in clonal insulin-secreting cells by dual color total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy, monomeric red fluorescent protein (mRFP)-tagged neuropeptide Y and green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged synaptotagmin-1 or synaptobrevin-2 rapidly diffused from sites of exocytosis, whereas the vesicle membrane protein phogrin and tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) were retained, consistent with fusion pore closure. Vesicle recovery frequently involved the recruitment of enhanced GFP-tagged dynamin-1, and GTPase-defective dynamin-1(K44E) increased the dwell time of tPA-mRFP at the plasma membrane. By contrast, recruitment of GFP chimeras of clathrin, epsin, and amphiphysin was not observed. Expression of dynamin-1(K535A), mutated in the pleckstrin homology domain, caused the apparent full fusion of vesicles, as reported by the additional release of tPA-mRFP (15-nm diameter) and enhanced GFP-tagged phogrin. We conclude that re-uptake of vesicles after peptide release by cavicapture corresponds to a novel form of endocytosis in which dynamin-1 stabilizes and eventually closes the fusion pore, with no requirement for “classical” endocytosis for retreat from the plasma membrane. The regulated release of peptide hormones has classically been thought to require the full fusion of the dense core vesicle membrane with the plasmalemma, i.e. the formation a “fusion pore” that eventually collapses via an “omega” structure to permit the passage of intravesicular protein cargoes (1Lindau M. Almers W. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 509-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 2Zenisek D. Steyer J.A. Feldman M.E. Almers W. Neuron. 2002; 35: 1085-1097Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Indeed, release of insulin has been proposed to involve the release of the crystalline dense core (100–200-nm diameter) essentially as an intact structure (3Holroyd P. Lang T. Wenzel D. De Camilli P.

Science. 1973; 179: 82-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), an event almost certainly requiring full fusion (5Ma L. Bindokas V.P. Kuznetsov A. Rhodes C. Hays L. Edwardson J.M. Ueda K.

Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 324-328Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) have, however, questioned these views and suggested instead that a process akin to “kiss and run” fusion of synaptic vesicles (8Ceccarelli B. Hurlbut W.P. J. Cell Biol. 1980; 87: 297-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar) and termed “cavity recapture” (“cavicapture”) by Henkel and Almers (9Henkel A.W. Almers W. Curr. Opin.

(Woods Hole). 2001; 201: 263-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar) is involved in the exocytosis of dense core vesicles in neuroendocrine cells. In contrast to classical kiss-and-run, cavicapture allows the release of selected protein cargoes from dense core vesicles during transient fusion with the cell membrane (12Rutter G.A. Tsuboi T. Neuroreport. 2004; 15: 79-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In neither process, however, does the vesicle flatten fully into the plasmalemma. We recently demonstrated (13Tsuboi T. Rutter G.A. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 563-567Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) that the release of the vesicle cargo protein neuropeptide Y (NPY) 1The abbreviations used are: NPY, neuropeptide Y; tPA, tissue plasminogen activator; GFP, green fluorescent protein; EGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein; VAMP2, vesicle-associated membrane protein-2 (synaptobrevin-2); TIRF, total internal reflection fluorescence; SNARE, soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor; mRFP, monomeric red fluorescent protein; Syt1, synaptotagmin-1; LC, light chain; PH, pleckstrin homology; IA-2, insulinoma-associated protein-2; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-O-(3-thiotriphosphate).-Venus (where Venus is a pH-insensitive mutant of yellow fluorescent protein) (14Nagai T.

Terakawa S. Rutter G.A. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 1307-1310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) does not involve the transfer into the plasma membrane of the vesicle membrane protein phogrin (phosphatase on the granule of insulin-containing cells). Indeed, using a statistical approach and monitoring the release of different vesicle membrane proteins and cargoes, we defined three distinct forms of kiss and run exocytosis (transient, mixed, and full). Similarly, Taraska et al. (16Taraska J.W. Perrais D. Ohara-Imaizumi M. Nagamatsu S. Almers W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 2070-2075Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar) demonstrated the partial release of another cargo protein, tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), whereas enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP)-tagged phogrin was retained on the membrane of the same vesicle in pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells. Using capacitance measurements in chromaffin cells, Palfrey and co-workers (17Artalejo C.R. Elhamdani A. Palfrey H.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 6358-6363Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) proposed that two kinetically and mechanistically distinct forms of endocytosis occur following exocytosis: a rapid form of endocytosis, which requires the function of dynamin-1, a GTPase associated with the binding of endocytotic vesicles, but not the coat protein clathrin, and a second, slower phase. Whereas the rapid form is strictly Ca2+-dependent, the second phase of endocytosis involves clathrin and dynamin-2, but does not require an increase in intracellular Ca2+ concentration. Correspondingly, using static imaging approaches in fixed PC12 cell plasma membrane lawns, Jahn and co-workers (3Holroyd P. Lang T. Wenzel D. De Camilli P. Jahn R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 16806-16811Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) demonstrated that dynamin becomes associated preferentially with vesicles that have undergone uptake of high molecular mass fluid-phase markers and thus, presumably, cavicapture events. At present, however, it is unclear (i) at what stage during a single exocytotic event dynamin-1 is recruited, i.e. during or after peptide release and closure of a transient fusion; (ii) whether the association of dynamin with the exocytosing vesicle affects the ultimate outcome of the event, i.e. the decision between “full fusion” and cavicapture (13Tsuboi T. Rutter G.A. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 563-567Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar); or (iii) whether dynamin recruitment occurs in neuroendocrine cells, including pancreatic β-cells. By monitoring exocytosis using a Descosoma coral red fluorescent protein-synaptobrevin-2 (DsRed-VAMP2) chimera and endocytosis with dynamin-1-EGFP, we have previously shown that only ∼20% of apparent exocytotic events appear to involve rapid endocytosis in PC12 cells (18Tsuboi T. Terakawa S. Scalettar B.A. Fantus C. Roder J. Jeromin A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15957-15961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). However, these earlier studies did not explore the recruitment of clathrin or other proteins involved in endocytosis, including the adaptor molecule epsin (19Chen H. Fre S. Slepnev V.I. Capua M.R. Takei K. Butler M.H. Di Fiore P.P. De Camilli P. Nature. 1998; 394: 793-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). The latter molecule is involved in binding adaptor protein-2 and subsequently the formation of a clathrin cage. Binding of epsin to the plasma membrane involves an interaction between the epsin N-terminal homology domain and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate generated as a signal for endocytosis (20Lemmon M.A. Traffic. 2003; 4: 201-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). Insertion of epsin into the membrane then appears to cause membrane curvature (21Ford M.G. Mills I.G. Peter B.J. Vallis Y. Praefcke G.J. Evans P.R. McMahon H.T. Nature. 2002; 419: 361-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (802) Google Scholar), facilitating vesicle formation and recapture. Whether epsin plays a similar role in the re-uptake of dense core vesicles post-fusion is unclear, however. Here, we have determined, using simultaneous total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) imaging of a range of vesicle cargoes and membrane proteins along with fluorescently labeled wild-type and mutant dynamins, whether vesicle recapture following transient fusion events capable of releasing peptide cargoes involves a simple reversal of the fusion process and the retention of vesicle-associated SNARE proteins within the vesicle membrane or the deployment of the classical endocytosis machinery. Using dual color TIRF microscopy (15Tsuboi T. Zhao C. Terakawa S. Rutter G.A. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 1307-1310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), we imaged the behavior of fluorescently labeled SNARE proteins and dynamin-1 before, during, and after single exocytotic events in insulin-secreting pancreatic β-cells (MIN6). Using this approach, we show for the first time in β-cells that the recruitment of dynamin-1-EGFP occurs frequently to sites of either NPY-monomeric red fluorescent protein (mRFP) or tPA-mRFP release. By contrast, other mediators of “classical” endocytosis, including epsin-EGFP and clathrin-EGFP, rarely migrate to these sites. Instead, vesicles in pancreatic β-cells participate in a more complete form of fusion, allowing the selective release of small molecular mass vesicle membrane proteins (VAMP2 and synaptotagmin-1 (Syt1)), but not phogrin, into the plasma membrane. Stabilization and closure of the fusion pore appear to involve the recruitment of dynamin, without the creation of a clathrin cage, consistent with the preservation of a fully curved vesicle prior to re-uptake. Therefore, the present findings identify cavicapture as a novel form of endocytosis in pancreatic β-cells, with no apparent requirement for catalyzed membrane curvature. Expression Vectors—Dynamin-1-EGFP, dynamin-1(K44E)-EGFP, dynamin-1(K535A)-EGFP, EGFP-VAMP2, NPY-mRFP, phogrin-EGFP, and epsin-1-EGFP were constructed as described previously (13Tsuboi T. Rutter G.A.

Clathrin light chain (LC)-EGFP was generated by excising the clathrin LC open reading frame from clathrin LC-DsRed (a gift from Dr. Wolfhard Almers) and subcloning it into the EcoRI/KpnI sites of the pEGFP-N1 vector (Clontech). To generate cDNA encoding rat tPA fused to mRFP, we removed the coding sequence of EGFP from tPA-EGFP (a gift from Dr. Beth Scalettar) by digestion with SacII/NotI and replaced it with the corresponding fragment from NPY-mRFP. Rat cDNA encoding amphiphysin-1 was amplified by PCR with forward primer 5′-CTCGAGATGGCCGACATCAAGACGGG-3′ (with the XhoI site underlined) and reverse primer 5′-GAATTCTCTCCAGGCGCCGCGTGAA-3′ (with the EcoRI site underlined). The PCR product was digested with XhoI/EcoRI and inserted into the corresponding sites of the pEGFP-N1 expression vector. Rat cDNA encoding Syt1 was amplified by PCR with forward primer 5′-CTCGAGATGGTGAGTGCCAGTCATCCTGAG-3′ (with the XhoI site underlined) and reverse primer 5′-GAATTCTCTTCTTGACAGCCAGCATGGC-3′ (with the EcoRI site underlined). The PCR product was digested with XhoI/EcoRI and inserted into the corresponding sites of the pEGFP-N1 expression vector. To generate plasmids encoding dynamin-1 or dynamin-1(K535A), the open reading frame of dynamin-1 or dynamin-1(K535A) was amplified by PCR with forward primer 5′-GGATCCATGGGCAACCGCGGCATG-3′ (with the BamHI site underlined) and reverse primer 5′-AAGCTTTCAGGGGTCACTGATAGTGAT-3′ (with the HindIII site underlined). The PCR products were cleaved with BamHI/HindIII and subcloned into the pcDNA3.1(-) vector. The sequences of the inserts and the presence of the mutation were verified by automated DNA sequencing. MIN6 Cell Culture—MIN6 β-cells (24Miyazaki J. Araki K. Yamato E. Ikegami H. Asano T. Shibasaki Y. Oka Y. Yamamura K. Endocrinology. 1990; 127: 126-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (1060) Google Scholar) were used between passages 19 and 30 and grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 15% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (Invitrogen, Paisley, United Kingdom), 25 mm glucose, 5.4 mm KCl, 2 mm glutamine, 50 μm β-mercaptoethanol, 100 IU/ml penicillin, and 100 mg/ml streptomycin. Cells were cultured in a humidified atmosphere at 37 °C with 5% CO2. For dual color TIRF imaging (see below), MIN6 cells were plated on poly-l-lysine-coated high refractive index coverslips (n = 1.78; Olympus Optical Co., Tokyo, Japan). Cells were cotransfected with 2 μg (total) of plasmid DNA using LipofectAMINE 2000™ (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Transfected cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 25 mm glucose for 1 day and then in 3 mm glucose for an additional 16 h. Imaging was performed in modified Krebs-Ringer buffer (125 mm NaCl, 3.5 mm KCl, 1.5 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mm NaH2PO4, 0.5 mm MgSO4, 3 mm glucose, 10 mm HEPES, and 2 mm NaHCO3 (pH 7.4) equilibrated with 19:1 O2/CO2). Stimulation with KCl was achieved by perfusion with Krebs-Ringer buffer containing 50 mm KCl and 75 mm NaCl. Dual Color TIRF Microscopy—To selectively illuminate the plasma membrane and its associated vesicles, we used TIRF (also known as evanescent wave) microscopy (13Tsuboi T. Rutter G.A. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 563-567Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 25Axelrod D. J. Cell Biol. 1981; 89: 141-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar). An Olympus high numerical aperture objective lens (HR, Apochromatic, ×100, numerical aperture = 1.65, infinity-corrected) (26Terakawa S. Sakurai T. Abe K. Bioimages. 1997; 5: 24Google Scholar) was mounted on the nosepiece of a thermostatically controlled stage (37 °C; MC-60, Linkam, Surrey, United Kingdom) of an Olympus IX70 inverted microscope. A liquid (Cargille Laboratories, Cedar Grove, NJ) of high refractive index was used to couple the lens to the coverslip. Fluorescent proteins of different colors were imaged simultaneously with an image splitter (Multispec MicroImager, Optical Insights, Santa Fe, NM) to separate the emission components of two fluorescent proteins into two channels, which were then projected as side-by-side images on a cooled charge-coupled device camera (640 × 480 pixels; IMAGO, Till Photonics) similar to that described previously (15Tsuboi T. Zhao C. Terakawa S. Rutter G.A. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 1307-1310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Images were acquired for 5 min at 2 Hz with a 150-ms exposure using TILLvisION software (Till Photonics) unless stated otherwise. EGFP and mRFP were both excited by a 488-nm laser line (argon ion laser, 30 milliwatts; Spectra-Physics) as described previously (15Tsuboi T. Zhao C. Terakawa S. Rutter G.A. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 1307-1310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). A 565-nm dichroic mirror (Chroma 565DCXR) in the image splitter separated EGFP and mRFP fluorescence. EGFP passed through a 30-nm band-pass filter centered at 520 nm, and mRFP passed through a 630-nm long-pass filter. Image Analysis—To analyze the data, single exocytotic events were manually selected. A 5 × 5-μm square region was centered on the brightest pixel of the first frame showing exocytosis. Onset of exocytosis was defined as the first frame showing a significant fluorescence increase of the vesicle. The same square was also placed on all other frames in the sequence. The same squares were used to select the corresponding point in the other color image using TILLvisION MicroImager macro software. The 5 × 5-μm squares thus defined were excised from the movies and stored as mini-stacks. A 1-μm diameter circle was centered on the fusing vesicles, and the average fluorescence intensity was measured. The circle was also transferred into the corresponding location in the other color image, and the average fluorescence intensity was measured. The local background was determined as the average fluorescence in a concentric annulus with a 4-μm outer diameter and subtracted. The colocalization (see Figs. 1 and 3) was calculated using MetaMorph colocalization software (Universal Imaging Corp., Media, PA).Fig. 3Colocalization of endocytotic proteins with NPY-mRFP in MIN6 beta cells.

Comparisons between means were performed using one-tailed Student's t test for paired data with GraphPad Prism™ software. To calculate the time constant of decay and half-time, we normalized the NPY-mRFP and tPA-mRFP response to the same maximum amplitude. We then fitted a single exponential curve (Y = y0 + A1exp(-t/τ1), where y0 is offset value of the amplitude, A1 is the amplitude coefficient, t is time, and τ1 is the decay constant) by nonlinear regression analysis, to give the decay time, using Origin 7™ (OriginLab, Northampton, MA). Imaging Exocytotic Proteins in MIN6 Cells by Dual Color TIRF Microscopy—We labeled the insulin secretory vesicle membrane and cargo in clonal MIN6 β-cells by expressing phogrin-EGFP and NPY-mRFP, respectively (13Tsuboi T. Rutter G.A. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 563-567Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 22Pouli A.E. Emmanouilidou E. Zhao C. Wasmeier C. Hutton J.C. Rutter G.A. Biochem. J. 1998; 333: 193-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The latter reporter is predicted to have molecular dimensions similar to those of monomeric insulin (∼4-nm diameter) (Table I), but can be expressed in insulin-secreting cells without the complications of missorting and retention in the endoplasmic reticulum frequently observed with analogous insulin constructs (27Pouli A.E. Kennedy H.J. Schofield J.G. Rutter G.A. Biochem. J. 1998; 331: 669-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). 2T. Tsuboi and G. A. Rutter, manuscript in preparation. Illuminated using the dual color TIRF microscope, most NPY-mRFP-positive vesicles (89.8 ± 4.6%, five cells) colocalized with phogrin-EGFP-positive vesicles (Fig. 1, A–C), confirming the efficient targeting of NPY-mRFP to phogrin/insulin-positive vesicles (22Pouli A.E. Emmanouilidou E. Zhao C. Wasmeier C. Hutton J.C. Rutter G.A. Biochem. J. 1998; 333: 193-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Similarly, most Syt1-EGFP-labeled (78.4 ± 2.6%, five cells) and EGFP-VAMP2-labeled (92.3 ± 5.2%, five cells) structures colocalized with NPY-mRFP (Fig. 1, D–F and G–I). Finally, to verify whether another vesicle cargo protein, tPA-mRFP, was targeted to insulin-containing vesicles, we coexpressed this construct along with phogrin-EGFP. Most of the observed tPA-mRFP-positive vesicles (83.1 ± 4.3%, five cells) colocalized with phogrin-EGFP (Fig. 1, J–L). Therefore, at least beneath the plasma membrane, all of the green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged secretory vesicle membrane proteins and vesicle cargo proteins utilized were correctly targeted to insulin-containing dense core vesicles.Table IMolecular dimensions of vesicle proteinsProteinMolecular massResiduesVolumeDimensionsaProtein dimensions were measured by Swiss-PdbViewer-FoldbThese values reflect comparisons with insulin volumekDanm3nmEGFP26.923832.64.6 × 3.2 × 3.14.7mRFP25.922531.34.6 × 3.1 × 3.04.5Insulin5.8517.03.3 × 2.7 × 2.51NPY4.3365.24.3 × 1.9 × 1.40.7Human growth hormone22.319126.95.5 × 4.6 × 4.33.8tPA62.956276.110-15 × 7 × 5cThese values are estimated dimensions.

Cell depolarization with 50 mm KCl caused the apparent release of NPY-mRFP, as monitored through a transient increase in fluorescence followed by diffusion away from the site of exocytosis, whereas the phogrin-EGFP signal from the same vesicle diminished only slightly, with a green fluorescent spot remaining throughout (Fig. 2A and Supplemental Movie 1). This result is consistent with previous data in INS-1 β-cells (15Tsuboi T. Zhao C. Terakawa S. Rutter G.A. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 1307-1310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), and similar results have been obtained in PC12 cells (16Taraska J.W. Perrais D. Ohara-Imaizumi M. Nagamatsu S. Almers W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 2070-2075Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Fig. 2B shows the averaged fluorescence intensity measurement from several similar experiments. Whereas the majority of the NPY-mRFP fluorescence was lost rapidly from the vesicles (Fig. 2B, closed circles), phogrin-EGFP fluorescence remained nearly constant (open circles). In all cases examined, the vesicular phogrin-EGFP remained associated with the vesicle and failed to spread into the plasma membrane for up to 4 min after exocytosis (data not shown). These data strongly suggest that, under these conditions, vesicles do not, or do not fully, collapse into the plasma membrane after exocytosis, a phenomenon that would be expected to lead to rapid diffusion away of phogrin-EGFP fluorescence. tPA is a 63-kDa serine protease normally found in endothelial, PC12, and chromaffin cell granules (28Lochner J.E. Kingma M. Kuhn S. Meliza C.D. Cutler B. Scalettar B.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 2463-2476Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 29Parmer R.J. Mahata M. Mahata S. Sebald M.T. O'Connor D.T. Miles L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1976-1982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). We predicted that increases in the diameter of the fusion pore, up to and including complete collapse of the vesicle into the plasma membrane, should permit tPA-EGFP to be released completely from the secretory vesicle. However, previous experiments in PC12 cells showed that tPA-EGFP is usually retained in secretory vesicles (16Taraska J.W. Perrais D. Ohara-Imaizumi M. Nagamatsu S. Almers W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 2070-2075Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar) after exocytosis, arguing that full fusion events are rare. To monitor the behavior of tPA and phogrin simultaneously in the same vesicle, we followed the dynamics of tPA-mRFP and phogrin-EGFP. As shown in Fig. 1 (J–L), nearly all tPA vesicles colocalized with the insulin vesicle marker phogrin in MIN6 cells. A representative tPA-mRFP and phogrin-EGFP fusion event is shown in Fig. 2C (see Supplemental Movie 1), and the corresponding time courses of fluorescence intensity change at the exocytosis site are shown in Fig. 2D. After an initial increase, tPA-mRFP fluorescence dimmed slowly, presumably reflecting either slow release of tPA or vesicle resealing and re-acidification (expected to quench mRFP fluorescence) (Fig. 2D, closed circles). Regardless of the mechanisms involved, it is evident that tPA-mRFP was retained in vesicles much longer than NPY-mRFP (Fig. 2B). We next examined the fate of secretory vesicle-associated proteins during and after exocytosis. We expressed Syt1-EGFP with NPY-mRFP in MIN6 cells and observed the fluorescence intensity changes of these proteins during and after individual exocytotic events. Cell depolarization with 50 mm KCl caused Syt1-EGFP fluorescent spots to spread into the plasma membrane and then disappear, albeit more slowly than NPY-mRFP fluorescence (Fig. 2, E and F; and Supplemental Movie 1). Similarly, 50 mm KCl caused the spreading of the fluorescence of the SNARE protein, EGFP-VAMP2, from discrete vesicular structures into the plasma membrane, followed by a rapid disappearance of fluorescence (Fig. 2, G and H; and Supplemental Movie 1). This behavior is similar to that previously observed using VAMP2 fused to pH-sensitive GFP (synapto-pHluorin) (13Tsuboi T. Rutter G.A. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 563-567Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). These data indicate that a large proportion of the vesicle-associated protein complement is transferred into the plasma membrane after exocytosis. Imaging of Endocytotic Proteins in MIN6 Cells by Dual Color TIRF Microscopy—Clathrin-mediated endocytosis is one of the primary mechanisms by which eukaryotic cells internalize nutrients, antigens, and growth factors and recycle receptors and vesicles (30Di Fiore P.P.

To define the final steps in this pathway and the responsible peptidases, we fractionated by size the peptides generated by proteasomes from β-[14C]casein and studied in HeLa cell extracts the degradation of the 9–17 residue fraction and also of synthetic deca- and dodecapeptide libraries, because peptides of this size serve as precursors to MHC class I antigenic peptides. Their hydrolysis was followed by measuring the generation of smaller peptides or of new amino groups using fluorescamine. The 14C-labeled peptides released by 20 S proteasomes could not be degraded further by proteasomes. However, their degradation in the extracts and that of the peptide libraries was completely blocked by o-phenanthroline and thus required metallopeptidases. One such endopeptidase, thimet oligopeptidase (TOP), which was recently shown to degrade many antigenic precursors in the cytosol, was found to play a major role in degrading proteasome products. Inhibition or immunodepletion of TOP decreased their degradation and that of the peptide libraries by 30–50%. Pure TOP failed to degrade proteasome products 18–24 residues long but degraded the 9–17 residue fraction to peptides of 6–9 residues. When aminopeptidases in the cell extract were inhibited with bestatin, the 9–17 residue proteasome products were also converted to peptides of 6–9 residues, instead of smaller products. Accordingly, the cytosolic aminopeptidase, leucine aminopeptidase, could not degrade the 9–17 residue fraction but hydrolyzed the peptides generated by TOP to smaller products, recapitulating the process in cell extracts. Inactivation of both TOP and aminopeptidases blocked the degradation of proteasome products and peptide libraries nearly completely. Thus, degradation of most 9–17 residue proteasome products is initiated by endoproteolytic cleavages, primarily by TOP, and the resulting 6–9 residue fragments are further digested to amino acids by aminopeptidases.

Although much attention has focused on the initial steps in the pathway for protein breakdown, the ubiquitination of polypeptides and their degradation in proteasomes, very few studies have concerned the subsequent degradation of the proteasome products to amino acids. Oligopeptides generated by proteasomes derived from cell proteins are not found in cell extracts (7Falk K. Rotzschke O. Rammensee H.G.

This rapid clearance of peptides released by proteasomes appears to be essential for cell viability, because this process serves several key functions. 1) The hydrolysis of these proteasome products provides amino acids for use in the synthesis of new proteins. The efficient digestion of cell proteins to amino acids must be of particular importance under conditions where the supply of exogenous amino acids is limiting. 2) An accumulation of undegraded peptide fragments of cell proteins in the cytosol could interfere with important protein-protein interactions, and such peptides could by themselves aggregate or be toxic (11Tenidis K. Waldner M. Bernhagen J. Fischle W. Bergmann M. Weber M. Merkle M.L. Voelter W. Brunner H. Kapurniotu A. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 295: 1055-1071Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar, 12Hughes E.

In fact, recent studies indicate that antigenic peptides and longer precursors are quite susceptible to rapid degradation in cytosolic extracts (13Goldberg A.L. Cascio P. Saric T. Rock K.L. Mol.

In eukaryotes, aminopeptidases have been implicated in the final steps of intracellular proteolysis. Botbol and Scornik (18Botbol V. Scornik O.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Physiol. 1997; 273: E1149-E1157PubMed Google Scholar) have shown that treatment of various cells with the aminopeptidase inhibitor bestatin causes accumulation of short peptides of ∼2–5 residues, which are generated during cytosolic protein degradation. These observations suggest that the final steps in ubiquitin-proteasome pathway involve unidentified aminopeptidases, which very rapidly digest the small proteasome products (<5 residues). Presumably, the longer peptides released by proteasomes must be first broken down to smaller fragments by other enzymes, specifically by cytosolic endopeptidases or by exopeptidases insensitive to bestatin (23Tomkinson B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 355-359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). One such peptidase, tripeptidyl peptidase II (TPP-II), has been shown by Reits et al. (10Reits E. Neijssen J. Herberts C. Benckhuijsen W. Janssen L. Drijfhout J.W. Neefjes J.

These investigators reported that in vivo peptides smaller than 15 residues are digested exclusively by aminopeptidases and not by endopeptidases (9Reits E. Griekspoor A. Neijssen J. Groothuis T.

However, this observation is not consistent with the findings of Botbol and Scornik (18Botbol V. Scornik O.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Res. 1985; 180: 573-583PubMed Google Scholar) that inhibition of aminopeptidases results in accumulation only of peptides shorter than 5 residues, the latter observation suggesting that peptides 6–15 residues long are initially broken down by endopeptidases to smaller fragments that are further digested by aminopeptidases. In addition to TPP-II, three other cytosolic endopeptidases have been proposed to function in this process: the insulin-degrading enzyme, prolyl oligopeptidase, and neurolysin (23Tomkinson B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 355-359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 27Kirschner R.J. Goldberg A.L. J. Biol.

Methods Enzymol. 1995; 248: 529-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). However, no detailed studies of their roles have been undertaken. While studying whether potential antigenic peptides are degraded in the cytosol, we found that in the HeLa cytosol, the seven antigenic peptides studied were all rapidly degraded by a process involving two specific metallopeptidases sensitive to o-phenanthroline (14Saric T.

Three of these 8–10 residue peptides were degraded rapidly by a bestatin-sensitive exopeptidase, the puromycin-sensitive aminopeptidase. However, the destruction of the five others was mediated by a single endopeptidase, thimet oligopeptidase (TOP, EC 3.4.24.15). This monomeric and highly conserved 78 kDa metallopeptidase is present in all cells and preferentially degrades peptides 6–17 residues long (28Barrett A.J. Brown M.A. Dando P.M. Knight C.G. McKie N.

In these extracts, TOP also catalyzed the degradation of N-extended variants of antigenic peptides (14Saric T. Beninga J. Graef C.I. Akopian T.N. Rock K.L. Goldberg A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36474-36481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), which in vivo appear to be the primary precursors of the MHC class I-presented epitopes (13Goldberg A.L.

Chem. 1979; 254: 11254-11257Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These findings suggested that TOP, by destroying antigenic peptides or precursors in the cytosol, might inhibit their presentation on MHC molecules. Recent in vivo studies, in which TOP was overexpressed or eliminated using siRNA, have proven that the activity of TOP limits the extent of antigen presentation on the cell surface (15York I.A.

These findings raised the possibility that TOP also catalyzes the breakdown of the bulk of proteasome products, especially those 6–17 residues long. The present studies were undertaken to test this possibility, to determine whether other peptidases also contribute to this process, and to clarify the likely sequence of actions of different peptidases in hydrolysis of these proteasome products. We demonstrate here that their degradation in the cytosol is a two-step process in which many (perhaps most) are cleaved initially by the endopeptidase TOP yielding smaller peptides, which are further digested to single amino acids by cytosolic aminopeptidases.

Briefly, frozen muscles were homogenized in a blender in four volumes of buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mm ATP, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 250 mm sucrose). The homogenate was centrifuged for 15 min at 10,000 × g, and the supernatant spun further for 60 min at 100,000 × g. The proteasomes and TPP-II in the supernatant were pelleted by centrifugation for 2.5 h at 240,000 × g in a Ti45 rotor (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA) over 1 ml of cushion of 20% glycerol. Pellets were dissolved in buffer B (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm ATP, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 10% glycerol), loaded onto a DEAE AffiBlue column (Bio-Rad), and the proteasomes and TPP-II were eluted with an isocratic step of 150 mm NaCl. This fraction was directly loaded on an Uno Q-12 anion exchange column (Bio-Rad Laboratories) and fractionated as described previously (3Kisselev A.F. Akopian T.N. Woo K.M. Goldberg A.L. J. Biol.

The 20 S proteasome peak eluted at 220 mm NaCl, the 26 S proteasomes eluted at 240 mm NaCl, and the TPP-II at 260 mm NaCl. 20 S proteasomes were dialyzed against buffer C (50 mm Na-Hepes, pH 7.5, 1 mm DTT, 10% glycerol) and further purified to homogeneity on a heparin column (EconoPac Heparin cartridge, 5 ml, Bio-Rad) as described previously (3Kisselev A.F.

Peak fractions were concentrated by ultrafiltration, and aliquots kept frozen at –70 °C. 26 S proteasomes eluted from the Uno Q-12 column were further purified by glycerol gradient (23–37%) density centrifugation for 20 h at 100,000 × g in buffer containing 20 mm Na-Hepes, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm ATP, 0.5 mm EDTA, and 1 mm DTT. Peak fractions containing 26 S proteasomes were concentrated and stored at –20 °C. The TPP-II fractions from the Uno Q-12 column were concentrated by ultrafiltration and 0.2 mg were loaded on top of a 10-ml glycerol density gradient (25–40% glycerol in 50 mm K2/K-PO4 buffer, pH 7.6, containing 1 mm DTT) and centrifuged as above. Active fractions were combined and concentrated by ultrafiltration. The TPP-II was purified by about 23,000-fold and was more than 90% pure as determined by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining. TPP-II was stored in 35% glycerol at –20 °C and was stable for at least 6 months under these conditions. The purified proteasomes and TPP-II were free of all assayed peptidase activities: thimet oligopeptidase, prolyl oligopeptidase, insulin-degrading enzyme, and aminopeptidases. Peptidase Assays with Fluorogenic Substrates—Peptidase activities were assayed at 37 °C in a continuous assay containing 1–10 μl of each chromatographic fraction or 10–20 μg of HeLa cell extract and the specific fluorogenic substrate in a reaction volume of 500 μl. The 20 S proteasome activity was determined with 100 μm Suc-LLVY-Amc in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm DTT, 0.02% SDS. The fluorescence of liberated Amc was measured in a SLM Aminco luminescence spectrometer at an excitation wavelength at 380 nm and emission wavelength at 460 nm. The activity of TPP-II was measured with the substrate AAF-Amc at 100 μm in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.6, containing 1 mm DTT, 10% glycerol, 100 μm bestatin, and 10 μm MG132. Thimet oligopeptidase activity was analyzed in buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm DTT, 0.05% Brij 35, and 20 μm fluorogenic peptide substrate Mcc-Pro-Leu-Gly-Pro-d-Lys(Dnp)-OH-Dnp (Mcc-PLGPK-Dnp). The fluorescent product was measured at an excitation wavelength of 345 nm and an emission wavelength of 405 nm. The activity of prolyl oligopeptidase (POP) was measured with Z-GP-Amc at a final concentration of 100 μm in buffer containing 50 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.6, 0.4 m NaCl, and 1 mm DTT. The activity of cytosolic aminopeptidases was determined routinely in 50 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.6, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT with 100 μm A-Amc or l-Amc. The levels of the insulin-degrading enzyme were measured by immunoblotting. Purification of Peptides Generated by Proteasomal Degradation of Casein—Peptides were first generated by digestion of β-[14C]casein by proteasomes as described by Kisselev et al. (3Kisselev A.F. Akopian T.N. Woo K.M. Goldberg A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3363-3371Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar), and then they were purified from undigested substrate and proteasomes by successive size exclusion HPLC (S.E.-HPLC) and RP-HPLC, as described below. The β-[14C]casein was prepared by reductive methylation as described by Dottavio-Martin and Ravel (31Dottavio-Martin D. Ravel J.M. Anal. Biochem. 1978; 87: 562-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar) and had a specific activity of 3.9 × 107 cpm/mg. This procedure radiolabeled the casein exclusively on lysine residues; the 95% of other amino acids (as calculated from the frequency of lysine residues in bovine β-casein) remained unmodified. Rabbit muscle 20 S proteasomes (25 pmol) were incubated with 2.15 nmol (2.1 × 106 cpm) of β-[14C]casein in 50 μl of 50 mm Na-Hepes, pH 7.5, 0.02% SDS, 5% glycerol. The reaction mixtures were incubated at 37 °C for different periods of time. The reactions were then stopped by cooling on ice, and the amount of substrate hydrolyzed was determined by the trichloroacetic acid precipitation assay or by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. An aliquot of each reaction was directly analyzed by size exclusion (S.E.)-HPLC or the complete reaction mixtures were frozen and lyophilized for later analysis. S.E. Chromatography of Degradation Products—An aliquot (5 μl) of each reaction or lyophilized samples were dissolved in 50 μl of S.E. buffer (200 mm sodium sulfate and 25% acetonitrile, pH 3.0 adjusted with phosphoric acid). 50 μl of the peptide mixture were loaded on a polyhydroxyethyl aspartamide S.E.-HPLC column (200 × 4.6 mm, 200 Å, PolyLC, Inc., Columbia, MD) at a flow rate of 0.125 ml/min, and fractions were collected at 0.5-min intervals. Fractions corresponding to elution times of peptides ranging between 6–8, 9–17, and 18–26 residues in length were combined in three corresponding pools. The apparent molecular mass of the proteasome products was determined from the calibration curve generated with a set of the following standards: l-Leu-hydroxamate (146 Da), tyrosine (181 Da), Phe-Ala (236 Da), Lys-Ala-dihydrobromide (379 Da), AAF-Amc (465 Da), Leu-enkephalinamide (556 Da), SIINFEKL (964 Da), TYQRTRALV (1106 Da), QLESIINFEKL (1332 Da) Substance P (1347 Da), angiotensinogen (1801 Da), oxidized insulin A chain (2532 Da), and oxidized insulin B chain (3496 Da). According to the manufacturer, the column is specified to have a linear separation range between 500 and 10,000 Da. However, in our hands the standard amino acids and dipeptides could be resolved, although not linearly, from longer peptides. The column was calibrated frequently between series of runs, and all calibrations, as well as separations of casein peptides, were highly reproducible. Rapid RP-HPLC Separation and Desalting of S.E.-HPLC-purified Peptides—S.E.-HPLC pools containing peptides with ∼6–8, 9–17, and 18–24 residues were lyophilized. Each lyophilized sample was resuspended in 110 μl of 0.06% trifluoroacetic acid and was desalted on a C18 RP-HPLC column (20 × 250 mm, 10 μm, Vydac, Hesperia, CA), which was equilibrated in 0.06% trifluoroacetic acid. Peptides were eluted with 38% acetonitrile for 2 min, followed by a linear gradient of acetonitrile from 38 to 48% for the next 1.2 min, and again with an isocratic step with 48% acetonitrile for the last 2 min at a flow rate of 1.5 ml/min. Peptides of each pool were eluted in a single peak that contained more than 90% of the loaded radioactivity. Peptides were pooled, lyophilized, and redissolved in sterile water to a final concentration of 100–220 pmol/μl (4,000 cpm/μl). Aliquots were stored at –20 °C until use. Preparation of HeLa Cell Extract—HeLa S3 cells (ATCC CCL 2.2) were grown in T-150 flasks in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen Life Technologies) containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin G, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 0.25 μg/ml amphotericin B. Subconfluent cultures were washed twice with copious amounts of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.5, and the remaining wash buffer was completely removed by aspiration. The cells were removed with a cell lifter in 1.5 ml/flask of ice-cold 50 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm ATP, 1 mm DTT, and 250 mm sucrose. The extract was prepared by Dounce homogenization with ten manual strokes on ice and subsequent vortexing for 3 × 1 min with one-fourth of extract volume of glass beads (106 μm, acid-washed, Sigma). This homogenate was spun at 20,000 × g for 5 min, and the resulting supernatant was ultracentrifuged under varying conditions to remove selectively TPP"

To ascertain the functional importance of CTα, we created a mouse in which the hepatic CTα gene was specifically inactivated by the Cre/LoxP procedure.

Lipid analyses of the liver indicated that female knockout mice had reduced phosphatidylcholine levels and accumulated triacylglycerols. The plasma phosphatidylcholine concentration was reduced in the CTα knockout (independent of gender), as were levels of high density lipoproteins (cholesterol and apoAI) and very low density lipoproteins (triacylglycerols and apoB100).

In all nucleated mammalian cells, PC is synthesized from choline via the Kennedy (CDP-choline) pathway (1Kennedy E.P. Weiss S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1956; 222: 193-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the flux through this pathway is regulated by the activity of CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase (CT) (2Vance D.E.

In the mouse, two genes encode CT, Pcyt1a and Pcyt1b (5Karim M. Jackson P. Jackowski S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1633: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Hepatic cells have both a CTα isoform encoded by Pcyt1a and a CTβ2 isoform encoded by Pcyt1b. CTα is believed to be the predominant isoform in the liver (5Karim M. Jackson P. Jackowski S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1633: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Liver cells are unique in that they can also synthesize PC via the sequential methylation of phosphatidylethanolamine catalyzed by phosphatidylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PEMT) (6Vance D.E. Ridgway N.D. Prog. Lipid Res. 1988; 27: 61-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). The PEMT pathway accounts for ∼30% of hepatic PC biosynthesis, whereas the enzymes of the Kennedy pathway produce the remaining 70% (7Sundler R. Akesson B. Biochem. J. 1975; 146: 309-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 8Reo N.V. Adinehzadeh M. Foy B.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1580: 171-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 9DeLong C.J. Shen Y.J. Thomas M.J. Cui Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29683-29688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). In recent years, several studies have described specific roles for the PEMT and CDP-choline pathways in PC biosynthesis and lipoprotein metabolism. Experiments on Pemt-/- mice suggested that PEMT has been retained during evolution to provide PC when dietary choline is deficient, such as during starvation (10Walkey C.J. Donohue L.R. Bronson R. Agellon L.B. Vance D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12880-12885Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 11Walkey C.J. Yu L. Agellon L.B. Vance D.E. J. Biol.

Nutr. 2002; 132: 68-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Indeed, when PEMT knockout mice were fed a choline-deficient diet, they developed severe liver pathology and died within 4 days (11Walkey C.J. Yu L. Agellon L.B. Vance D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27043-27046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar), thus highlighting the requirement for PEMT activity when biosynthesis of PC through the CDP-choline pathway is insufficient. The PEMT-deficient mice appeared normal on a standard chow diet, suggesting that the CDP-choline pathway can compensate for the loss of PEMT activity when choline is available. A specific role for PEMT in VLDL secretion has been demonstrated in vivo and in experiments with hepatocytes (13Noga A.A. Zhao Y. Vance D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42358-42365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 14Noga A.A. Vance D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 21851-21859Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). In male Pemt-/- mice fed a high fat/high cholesterol diet, plasma TG and PC levels were reduced by 50 and 20%, respectively, compared with those in Pemt+/+ mice. In contrast, the plasma content of these lipids was the same in female Pemt-/- and Pemt+/+ mice fed a high fat/high cholesterol diet (14Noga A.A. Vance D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 21851-21859Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). In hepatocytes from male Pemt-/-, compared with Pemt+/+ mice, apoB100 secretion was reduced by 60%, whereas TG secretion was reduced by 75% (13Noga A.A. Zhao Y. Vance D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42358-42365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). This apparent reduction in VLDL secretion may explain why Pemt-/- mice fed the high fat/high cholesterol diet have a 5-fold higher level of hepatic TG than their Pemt+/+ counterparts (13Noga A.A. Zhao Y. Vance D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42358-42365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). The above experiments demonstrate that PEMT can be limiting in VLDL secretion and highlight a possible gender difference in the relationship between PC metabolism and lipoprotein homeostasis. Studies investigating the importance of the CDP-choline pathway in lipoprotein metabolism have primarily consisted of feeding choline-deficient (CD) diets to animals (15Best C.H. Huntsman M.E. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1932; 75: 405-412Crossref Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 16Yao Z.M. Vance D.E. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1990; 68: 552-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 17Yao Z.M. Jamil H. Vance D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 4326-4331Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), or applying CD medium to hepatocytes or other cells in culture (18Yao Z.M. Vance D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 2998-3004Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Yao Z.M. Vance D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11373-11380Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Vermeulen P.S. Lingrell S. Yao Z. Vance D.E. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 447-458Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It has been well established that hepatic and plasma PC concentrations are reduced in rats fed a CD diet. This reduction in dietary choline results in decreased plasma VLDL-TG and VLDL-apoB levels and TG accumulation in the liver (16Yao Z.M. Vance D.E. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1990; 68: 552-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The presumption in these experiments was that the effects seen on lipid and lipoprotein metabolism were due to inhibition of PC biosynthesis via the CDP-choline pathway. Studies in hepatocytes initially seemed to agree with this conclusion, since VLDL secretion was impaired from rat hepatocytes incubated in medium deficient in methionine and choline and TG accumulated 6-fold in the cells (18Yao Z.M. Vance D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 2998-3004Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, attributing these changes to impaired flux through the CDP-choline pathway was dubious for several reasons. First, supplementation of the medium with either choline or methionine returned cellular TG levels to normal and restored normal TG and apoB secretion (18Yao Z.M. Vance D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 2998-3004Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Second, the rate of PC synthesis from CDP-choline was not directly measured. However, these observations suggest that active PC biosynthesis from either PEMT or CDP-choline is required for normal VLDL secretion. Furthermore, Cui and Vance (21Cui Z. Vance D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2839-2843Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) observed that the specific radioactivity of 3H-labeled PC in CD hepatocytes was higher, not lower, than in choline-supplemented hepatocytes following incubation with [3H]choline. Moreover, Kulinski et al. (22Kulinski A. Vance D.E. Vance J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; (M312676200)PubMed Google Scholar) have shown that the rate of flux through the CDP-choline pathway is higher, not lower, in CD than in choline-supplemented murine hepatocytes and that VLDL secretion from murine hepatocytes is not impaired by choline deficiency. In light of these experiments, choline deficiency appears not to be an appropriate model in which to investigate the specific role of the CDP-choline pathway in PC biosynthesis or in lipid and lipoprotein metabolism. To gain further insight for the role of the CDP-choline pathway in hepatic lipoprotein metabolism, we have generated mice in which the CTα gene was selectively disrupted in the liver by the Cre-Lox system (23Zhang D. Tang W. Yao P.M. Yang C. Xie B. Jackowski S. Tabas I. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35368-35376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 24Postic C. Shiota M. Niswender K.D.

Our hypothesis predicted that CTα is vital for normal secretion of lipoproteins from liver. Consequently, we predicted that mice deficient in hepatic CTα would have decreased circulating lipoproteins and fat accumulation in the liver. The results describe an important role for the hepatic CDP-choline pathway, and particularly CTα, in regulating both hepatic and systemic lipid and lipoprotein metabolism. Materials—Anti-human CTβ2 and anti-human CTα rabbit polyclonal antibodies were generous gifts from Dr. S. Jackowski (St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN). The sheep anti-human apoB antibody was purchased from Roche Applied Science, and the rabbit anti-human apoA1 and goat anti-human apoE antibodies were from Biodesigns (Kennebunk, ME). Both the donkey anti-sheep and the goat anti-rabbit secondary antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase were purchased from Pierce. The polyclonal antibody directed against the C-terminal dodecapeptide of rat PEMT2 was raised in rabbits in our laboratory (25Cui Z. Vance J. Chen M. Voelker D. Vance D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16655-16663Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). S-[methyl-3H]adenosylmethionine, [methyl-3H]choline, and [35S]Promix (methionine/cysteine) were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Triton WR1339 was purchased from Sigma. All other chemicals and reagents were from standard commercial sources. Generation and Identification of CTαflox Mice and CTαflox/AlbuminCre Mice—Homozgous CTαflox mice, generated previously (23Zhang D. Tang W. Yao P.M. Yang C. Xie B. Jackowski S. Tabas I. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35368-35376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), were identified by PCR of tail DNA (isolated by the DNesay Tissue Kit; Qiagen) using the following primers: CT382 (5′-TCTTTGCTTGCATCA-3′) and CT3UL (5′-GAAGTAGGCACTGAACTTAGC-3′). A homozygous CTαflox mouse was crossed with a mouse expressing the Cre recombinase gene driven by the hepatic-specific albumin promoter (albuminCre) kindly provided by Dr. Mark A. Magnuson (Vanderbilt University). The resulting pups, which were heterozygous for both CTαflox and albuminCre, were then bred with homozygous CTαflox mice. Mice homozygous for CTαflox and heterozygous for albuminCre (i.e. mice having CTα-deficient livers) were identified (Fig. 1A) by PCR screening of tail DNA from the pups. Mice—All procedures were approved by University of Alberta's Animal Welfare Committee and were in accordance with guidelines of the Canadian Council on Animal Care. Mice, housed 4–5 per cage, were exposed to a 12-h light/dark cycle beginning with light at 8:00 a.m. Adult male and female mice, 12–24 weeks old, were fed ad libitum a chow diet from LabDiet (PICO laboratory Rodent Diet 20) and had free access to water. For all experiments, mice were fasted overnight (16 h) prior to sacrifice. Enzymatic Assays—Tissues were homogenized in a glass/Teflon homogenizer in 2 ml of buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) followed by sonication for 30 s. Protein concentration was determined using the Coomassie Plus protein protocol (Bio-Rad), with bovine serum albumin as a standard. Total CT activity was measured in homogenates (50 μg of protein) from livers and hearts by monitoring the conversion of [3H]phosphocholine into CDP-choline (26Schneider W.J. Vance D.E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1978; 85: 181-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). For measurement of PEMT activity, 45 μg of protein of liver homogenates were incubated with phosphatidylmonomethylethanolamine and S-adenosyl[methyl-3H]methionine, and the incorporation of radiolabel into PC was measured as described previously (27Ridgway N.D. Vance D.E. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 209: 366-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Immunoblotting of Hepatic CTα, PEMT, and CTβ2—Liver homogenates (20–50 μg of protein) were boiled in buffer containing 1% SDS, and proteins were separated on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Proteins were transferred to nylon membranes and probed with anti-CTα (dilution 1:1500), anti-PEMT2 (1:5000), or anti-CTβ2 (1:1000) antibody. Immunoreactive bands were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Biosciences). Quantification of the immunoreactive bands was performed using Image Gauge version 3.0 software by Fuji. Analysis of ApoAI, ApoE, and ApoB48/B100 Levels in Plasma— Blood was collected from each mouse via cardiac puncture in the presence of trace amounts of 250 mm EDTA, and plasma was isolated by centrifugation. Plasma (2–4 μl) was resolved on a 10% (for apoAI and apoE) or 5% (for apoB48/100) SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Proteins were transferred to nylon membranes and probed with anti-apoAI (dilution 1:10,000), anti-apoE (dilution 1:2500), or anti-apoB (dilution 1:5000) antibody. Determination of the Mass of Cholesterol, Cholesteryl Ester, and TG in Liver and Plasma—The amount of cholesterol, cholesteryl ester, and TG was determined in liver homogenates (0.5 mg of protein) or 50 μl of plasma. After digestion (2 h, 30 °C) of the phospholipids with phospholipase C, tridecanoin (20 ng) was added as an internal standard, and lipids were extracted. The mass of TG, cholesterol, and cholesteryl ester was determined by gas-liquid chromatography (28Myher J.J. Kuksis A. Pind S. Lipids. 1989; 24: 408-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Plasma from individual animals was separated into lipoprotein fractions using high performance liquid chromatography with an Amersham Biosciences Superose 6 column attached to a Beckman Systems Gold or Nouveau Gold apparatus. In-line assays for total cholesterol (Sigma Infinity cholesterol reagent) and TG (Sigma Triglyceride GPO Trinder kit) were performed as previously described (14Noga A.A. Vance D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 21851-21859Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Determination of PE and PC Mass in Livers and Plasma—Phosphatidyldimethylethanolamine (0.01 mg) was added as an internal standard to an aliquot (0.5 mg of protein) of liver homogenate or 50 μl of plasma. Lipids were extracted from the samples by the method of Folch et al. (29Folch J. Lees M. Stanley G.H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 226: 497-509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and phospholipids were separated and quantified by the HPLC method of Bergo et al. with minor modifications (30Bergo M.O. Gavino B.J. Steenbergen R. Sturbois B. Parlow A.F. Sanan D.A. Skarnes W.C. Vance J.E. Young S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 47701-47708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Determination of the Mass of Cholesterol, PC, and Bile Acids in Bile—Bile was collected directly from the gallbladders of anesthetized mice. Bile acids were separated and quantified by the HPLC method of Torchia et al. (31Torchia E.C. Labonte E.D. Agellon L.B. Anal. Biochem. 2001; 298: 293-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) using 3α,12α-dihydroxy-23-nor-5β-cholanic acid as an internal standard. Assay kits were used to determine the mass of biliary cholesterol (Wako) and PC (Sigma). Analysis of ApoB Secretion in Vivo—Mice were fasted overnight and injected with 100 μl of phosphate-buffered saline containing 15% Triton WR1339 (v/v) and 250 μCi of [35S]Promix as previously described (14Noga A.A. Vance D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 21851-21859Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). After various times, the animals were sacrificed, blood was collected, and plasma was isolated. To 100 μl of plasma were added 450 μl of phosphate-buffered saline, 100 μl of buffer containing Tris-HCl (0.63 m, pH 7.4), NaCl (0.75 m), EDTA (25 mm), phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (5 mm) and Triton X-100 (5%, v/v), and 7.5 μl of anti-human apoB antibody. The mixture was incubated overnight at 4 °C with gentle shaking. Next, 45 mg of protein A-Sepharose was added, and the sample was mixed for 2 h at 4 °C. The apoB-protein A complex was pelleted by centrifugation of the sample for 2 min at 14,000 rpm in a microcentrifuge. The pellet was boiled in the presence of 100 μl of sample buffer. Following centrifugation, samples were electrophoresed on 5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, after which the gels were soaked in Amplify solution, dried, and exposed to film. Quantification of the bands was performed using Image Gauge version 3.0 software by Fuji. Histological Studies—Livers were quickly extirpated and fixed in 10% formalin, and sections were stained by a standard protocol with hematoxylin and eosin. Some formalin-fixed samples were frozen in liquid nitrogen before sectioning and were subsequently stained with Oil Red O. Measurement of Plasma Aminotransferase Activities—Aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase activities in plasma were measured using the INFINITY AST and ALT kits from ThermoTrace. Statistical Analysis—Data are presented as means ± S.E. unless otherwise noted. There were 3–10 samples in each experimental group. Student's unpaired t test was performed to compare means. A p value of <0.05 was interpreted as a significant difference. Identification of the Liver-specific CTα Knockout Mice— Breeding of a homozygous CTαflox mouse with a mouse homozygous for CTαflox and heterozygous for Cre generated two possible genotypes: 1) homozygous CTαflox mice, which were used as controls in this study, and 2) homozygous CTαflox + heterozygous Cre mice, which lack hepatic CTα expression. DNA from tail clips were used to identify the genotype of the mice (Fig. 1A). In this figure, mice 1 and 2 were homozygous for CTαflox (right panel); however, only mouse 2 expressed Cre (left panel). Therefore, mouse 1 was a “control,” whereas mouse 2 was a liver-specific CTα “knockout.” Mouse 3 was homozygous for CTαwt (right panel) and did not have the Cre gene (left panel). To determine whether disruption of the CTα gene resulted in decreased CTα protein expression, immunoblot analysis was performed on hepatic homogenates from control (CTαflox) and knockout (CTαflox + albuminCre) mice. As demonstrated in Fig. 1B, the presence of Cre reduced hepatic CTα expression by ∼95%. The remaining CTα protein can be attributed to the presence of endothelial, Kupffer, and blood cells. Indeed, others have observed similar results in liver when using the albuminCre/LoxP technology for other hepatocyte-specific genes (32Postic C. Magnuson M.A. Genesis. 2000; 26: 149-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Cardiac CTα protein expression was unchanged by the presence of the hepatic Cre gene (data not shown). CT activity was also measured in hepatic and cardiac homogenates (Fig. 1C). In livers of knockout mice, CT activity was reduced to 15% of control levels. The remaining CT activity can be attributed to the presence of CTβ2 in hepatocytes (Fig. 3B) as well as CT activity in nonhepatic cells. Cardiac CT activity was unaffected providing further evidence that CTα deletion is specific to the liver. Histological Characterization of Livers and Assay of Aminotransferase Activities—The weights of knockout mice (21.6 ± 2.4 g) were comparable with those of their littermate controls (21.5 ± 3.6 g). Moreover, there was no difference in the weight of the liver as a percentage of body weight between genotypes (controls versus knockouts: 5.6 ± 1.2 versus 5.3 ± 0.7% body weight). Livers taken from female knockout mice appeared outwardly normal; however, histological examination with hemotoxylin staining revealed many large vacuoles (Fig. 2B). These vacuoles were present throughout the hepatic acinus and showed no particular pattern. Livers from male knockout mice were also indistinguishable in outward appearance; however, unlike the female mice, male knockouts had only mild vacuolization (Fig. 2D). Oil Red-O staining of liver slices confirmed the presence of neutral lipids in the vacuoles (data not shown). Regardless of the degree of vacuolization, the CTα-deficient livers appeared to have fewer hepatocytes that were larger in size compared with control livers. We therefore counted the number of cells present on the slide at × 63 magnification. The livers taken from the knockout mice had 40% fewer hepatocytes per viewing area (control versus knockout: 105–130 versus 60–80 cells/viewing area). To confirm these results, we also measured the amount of DNA present/g of hepatic tissue. The CTα-deficient livers contained 30% less DNA/g of tissue compared with controls (0.78 ± 0.08 versus 1.17 ± 0.13 mg/g liver, p < 0.05). These results provide convincing evidence for the presence of fewer but larger hepatocytes in the knockout livers. Because of the obvious differences between the livers of the CTα knock-out and control mice (Fig. 2, B and D) plasma aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase activities were measured to assess the possibility of liver damage. The plasma activity of these enzymes was unaltered by disruption of the CTα gene in the liver, suggesting that the observed changes in plasma and hepatic lipids were due to loss of hepatic CTα activity rather than liver damage. The Lipid Content of the Liver Is Altered in CTα Knockout Mice—The Kennedy (CDP-choline) pathway has been shown to produce ∼70% of PC in the liver (7Sundler R. Akesson B. Biochem. J. 1975; 146: 309-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 9DeLong C.J. Shen Y.J. Thomas M.J. Cui Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29683-29688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). It was, therefore, expected that deletion of CTα would alter hepatic lipid concentrations. Table I shows data for hepatic PC, PE, cholesterol, cholesteryl esters, and TG. PC in the liver was decreased by 20% in female CTα knockout mice relative to controls. This decrease was not observed in male mice. Furthermore, hepatic TG was increased by 40% in the female knockout mice relative to control mice. Regardless of gender, no difference was observed in the levels of hepatic PE, cholesterol, or cholesteryl ester between control and knockout mice.Table IConcentration of PC, PE, cholesterol, cholesteryl ester, and TG in livers of hepatic CTα knockout and control mice Lipids were extracted from livers (0.5 mg of protein) and separated by high pressure liquid chromatography (for phospholipids) or by gas chromatography (for neutral lipids).

In the CTα-deficient livers, PEMT activity was increased irrespective of gender by 90% (Fig. 3A). Similarly, hepatic PEMT protein levels were 2-fold higher in the knockout mice than in control mice. Hepatic CTβ2 protein was also increased ∼2-fold in the CTα KO mouse (Fig. 3B), consistent with previous data with CTα-deficient mice (23Zhang D. Tang W. Yao P.M. Yang C. Xie B. Jackowski S. Tabas I. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35368-35376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). These results suggest that normally CTβ2 represents only ∼5% of total hepatic CT activity. This observation is consistent with another study that reports only minimal hepatic expression of CTβ2 (5Karim M. Jackson P. Jackowski S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1633: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Plasma Lipids Are Decreased in the Liver-specific CTα Knockout Mice—The plasma concentration of PC, the major phospholipid in mammalian plasma (33Vance D.E. Vance D.E. Vance J.E. Biochemistry of Lipids, Lipoproteins and Membranes. 4th Ed. Elsevier, Amsterdam2002: 205-232Google Scholar), was 60% lower in male knockout mice than in their control counterparts (Fig. 4). Moreover, the amount of plasma PC in female knockout mice was 50% less than in female controls. Interestingly, the large change in plasma PC was mirrored by changes in plasma cholesterol concentrations. In male knockout mice, total plasma cholesterol was 40% of control levels (Fig. 5), and in female knockout mice the plasma cholesterol level was half of that in control mice.Fig. 5Plasma TG and cholesterol are decreased in the liver-specific CTα knockout mice. The amounts of total cholesterol (unesterified + esterified cholesterol) and TG were measured in 50 μl of plasma. After digestion (2 h, 30 °C) of the phospholipids with phospholipase C, tridecanoin (20 ng) was added as an internal standard, and lipids were extracted. The amounts of TG and total cholesterol were determined by gas-liquid chromatography. Values are expressed as means ± S.E. for 6–10 mice for each condition. The asterisks signify differences versus control, p < 0.05.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Whereas the extent of the changes in plasma PC and cholesterol was similar in male and female mice, modulation of plasma TG levels by hepatic CTα deficiency was different between genders. The plasma TG content in male mice was only modestly (20%, p < 0.05) reduced in knockout mice compared with controls (Fig. 5). However, the amount of plasma TG was strikingly lower (45%, p < 0.05) in female knockout mice than in littermate controls. These data are consistent with the larger accumulation of TG in the livers"
https://openalex.org/W1964951207,"The multivesicular-body (MVB) pathway delivers transmembrane proteins and lipids to the lumen of the endosome. The multivesicular-body sorting pathway has crucial roles in growth-factor-receptor downregulation1, developmental signalling2,3,4, regulation of the immune response5 and the budding of certain enveloped viruses such as human immunodeficiency virus6. Ubiquitination is a signal for sorting into the MVB pathway7,8, which also requires the functions of three protein complexes, termed ESCRT-I, -II and -III (endosomal sorting complex required for transport)7,9,10. Here we report the crystal structure of the core of the yeast ESCRT-II complex, which contains one molecule of the Vps protein Vps22, the carboxy-terminal domain of Vps36 and two molecules of Vps25, and has the shape of a capital letter ‘Y’. The amino-terminal coiled coil of Vps22 and the flexible linker leading to the ubiquitin-binding NZF domain of Vps36 both protrude from the tip of one branch of the ‘Y’. Vps22 and Vps36 form nearly equivalent interactions with the two Vps25 molecules at the centre of the ‘Y’. The structure suggests how ubiquitinated cargo could be passed between ESCRT components of the MVB pathway through the sequential transfer of ubiquitinated cargo from one complex to the next."

A 1139-bp fragment containing part of exon VI and the 3′-flanking region was amplified by PCR with a sense primer of 5′-GGGGATGTGCTACATAAGGCC-3′ and an antisense primer of 5′-GGTAGTATCTGTAGTCAGTTTCTG-3′. A neo gene from a pMC1Neo plasmid (Stratagene) and then the 1139-bp fragment were inserted tandemly into the 3′-side of the 5-kb fragment so that the neo gene would disrupt the region encoding the N-terminal 264 amino acids of the mouse CysLT2 receptor. Finally, the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (TK) gene was inserted into the 5′-side of the 5-kb fragment (Fig. 1A). The resultant targeting vector was linearized and electroporated into a C57BL/6 mouse embryonic stem cell line (Specialty Media, Phillipsburg, NJ). The embryonic stem cells were selected with G418 (200 μg/ml; Invitrogen) and ganciclovir (2 μm; Sigma), and homologous recombination was confirmed by Southern blot analysis of EcoRI-digested genomic DNA from each embryonic stem cell clone with a 1250-bp 3′-fragment as a probe located outside the targeting vector (Fig. 1A). The embryonic stem cell clones, verified by Southern blot analysis, were microinjected into blastocysts from BALB/c mice; and chimeric males were obtained. Chimeras were bred to C57BL/6 females, and offspring were genotyped by Southern blot analysis of the tail DNA. Heterozygotes were intercrossed to obtain CysLT2 receptor(-/-) mice. All animal studies were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. Northern Blot Analysis—Total RNA from the lung and spleen tissue of CysLT2 receptor-null and wild-type mice was isolated with Tri-Reagent (Sigma) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Poly(A)+ RNA was then purified with Oligotex(dT) chromatography (Qiagen). A 4-μg sample of the poly(A)+ RNA was resolved by electrophoresis on a formaldehyde-denatured gel and transferred to a nylon membrane (Biodyne B, 0.45 μm; Pall Corp., Ann Arbor, MI) with 20× SSC for 24 h. The membrane was hybridized with 32P-labeled mouse CysLT2 receptor, CysLT1 receptor, or glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase coding region at 42 °C for 18 h; washed with 2× SSC, 0.1% SDS at room temperature, and then with 0.2× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 60 °C; and exposed at –80 °C to a Kodak X-AR film with an intensifying screen for 7 days for the CysLT2 receptor and CysLT1 receptor, and for 1 day for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. Zymosan A-induced Peritoneal Inflammation—Each mouse received an intravenous injection of 0.5% Evans blue dye (10 ml of dye solution/kg of body weight) in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) immediately before the intraperitoneal injection of 1 ml of zymosan A suspension (1 mg/ml in PBS; Sigma). Mice were killed by CO2 30, 60, 120, and 240 min after the injection of zymosan A, and the peritoneal cavity of each mouse was lavaged with 4 ml of cold PBS. Cells were sedimented from the lavage fluid by centrifugation at 500 × g for 5 min, and Evans blue dye extravasation was assessed by light spectrophotometry of the supernatants at 610 nm. The cell pellets were suspended in 100 μl of PBS, and the cells were counted. Cells (2 × 104) were cytospun onto a glass slide, stained with Diff-Quik (Dade Behring, Deerfield, IL), and analyzed for cell types. The total neutrophils in the lavage fluid were calculated from the percentage of the cell type and the total cell count. PCA—Mice received intradermal injections of 25 ng of mouse monoclonal anti-dinitrophenyl IgE (Sigma) in 25 μl of saline in the right ear and 25 μl of saline only in the left ear. After 20 h, mice were injected intravenously with 100 μg of dinitrophenyl-human serum albumin (Sigma) and 1% Evans blue dye in 100 μl of PBS. The mice were killed by CO2 30 min after the intravenous injection, and a 6-mm diameter disk of tissue was obtained from the center of each ear. Each disk was incubated in 200 μl of formamide at 55 °C for 48 h. Extravasation of Evans blue dye was quantitated by spectrophotometric analysis of the formamide extracts at 610 nm, and vascular permeability enhancement was calculated as the net difference between the sensitized and control ears. Intratracheal Injection of Bleomycin into Mice—Bleomycin sulfate (2.5 units/kg, Sigma) dissolved in saline (2.5 μl/g) or saline alone was administered intratracheally to mice that had been anesthetized with an intraperitoneal injection of pentobarbital (75 mg/kg). Histologic Assessment of Lung Tissue—Twelve days after bleomycin injection, the lower lobes of the lung were isolated, fixed for 4 h at room temperature and overnight at 4 °C in 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m sodium phosphate (pH 7.6), and washed twice with PBS. A portion of each lobe was embedded in paraffin in a routine manner and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. The majority of each lobe was dehydrated and embedded in accordance with the JB-4 kit from Polysciences (Warrington, PA). Sections were cut on a Reichert-Jung Supracut microtome (Leica, Deerfield, IL) with glass knives and picked up on glass slides. Some of the sections were stained using the chloroacetate esterase reaction with counterstaining by hematoxylin to depict neutrophils. To assess extracellular matrix deposition, some sections were stained with the Jones' periodic acid-methenamine silver method (37Sheehan D.C. Hrapchak B.B. Theory and Practice of Histotechnology. 2nd Ed. Battelle Press, Detroit, MI1980Google Scholar) modified with hematoxylin counterstain in the JB4-embedded lungs. The degree of alveolar septal thickening was quantitated without knowledge of the particular strain as described previously (36Beller T.C. Friend D.S. Maekawa A. Lam B.K. Austen K.F. Kanaoka Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 3047-3052Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Briefly, 5 pictures of randomly selected areas of the lower lobes of each lung at low power (×10 magnifications) stained with chloroacetate esterase and hematoxylin were obtained, and the areas of septal thickening, defined as macrophage proliferation in the alveolar septa accompanied by fibroblasts, giant cells, and increased extracellular matrix, were outlined. After being converted to digital images with a flatbed computer scanner (UMAX PowerLook III) and software (Adobe Photoshop 7.0), the number of pixels contained in the areas of the digital images that had septal thickening and the number of pixels contained in the image of the entire lung field were determined with the histogram function. The total number of pixels outlined as septal thickening was divided by the total number of pixels in the entire lung field and multiplied by 100 to generate a percentage of area with septal thickening for each animal. Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid Analysis in Mice with Bleomycin-induced Pulmonary Fibrosis—Twelve days after treatment with bleomycin or saline, mice in each group were killed by intraperitoneal injection of an overdose of pentobarbital. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid was obtained by lavage with 2.25 ml of PBS with 1 mm EDTA (0.75 ml × 3) through a 22-gauge intravenous canula. The fluid was centrifuged at 500 × g for 5 min, and the supernatants were retained for measurement of eicosanoids. The cell pellets were resuspended in 100 μl of PBS, and total and differential cell counts were obtained as described above. Assays for eicosanoids were carried out on 2 ml of each BAL fluid supernatant to which 10,000 cpm of [3H]LTC4 (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was added to calculate percentage recovery. Proteins were precipitated from the supernatant by the addition of a 4× volume of methanol and incubation on ice for 10 min. After centrifugation at 3,000 × g for 10 min, samples were dried in a vacuum centrifuge, resuspended in 50 mm sodium acetate (pH 4.0) with 10% methanol, and subjected to C18 Sep-Pak cartridge purification (Waters Associates, Milford, MA). The eluted samples obtained from each cartridge were dried by vacuum centrifugation and resuspended in enzyme immunoassay buffer. The amounts of cys-LTs, LTB4, and prostaglandin E2 were measured with enzyme immunoassay kits (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Statistical Analysis—Results were expressed as mean ± S.E. Stu dent's t test was used for the statistical analysis in cases in which the variance was homogeneous, and Welch's test was used when the variance was heterogeneous. A value of p < 0.05 was considered significant. Generation of CysLT2 Receptor Gene-disrupted Mice—A targeting vector was designed so that the neo gene insertion interrupts 85% of the coding region of the mouse CysLT2 receptor gene (Fig. 1A). Of 150 embryonic stem cell clones that survived in the presence of G418 and ganciclovir, two were identified as targeted clones by Southern blot analysis for the 2.6-kb band. The embryonic stem cell clones were microinjected into BALB/c mouse-derived blastocysts. Eight male chimeric mice (>50% chimerism by coat color) were obtained from each clone and bred to C57BL/6 females. The heterozygotes, verified by Southern blot analysis, were intercrossed to obtain mice homozygous for the CysLT2 receptor-null mutation. Southern blot analysis of EcoRI-digested DNA from the progeny demonstrated a 2.6-kb band for the disrupted allele and an ∼10-kb band for the wild-type allele, respectively, as illustrated for one litter (Fig. 1B). Litter size from these intercrosses were normal (mean = 6.6 offspring per litter; n = 39 litters). Of 258 progeny geno-typed from these matings, 62 were homozygotes (24.0%), 130 were heterozygotes (50.4%), and 66 were wild-type (25.6%), consistent with the expected Mendelian frequency. In addition, a similar number of male and female (29Samuelsson B. Dahlen S.E. Lindgren J.A. Rouzer C.A. Serhan C.N. Science. 1987; 237: 1171-1176Crossref PubMed Scopus (1958) Google Scholar and 33Lee C.W. Lewis R.A. Corey E.J. Austen K.F. Immunology. 1983; 48: 27-35PubMed Google Scholar) homozygotes were produced. The CysLT2 receptor-null mice that developed normally (mean body weight = 25.7 g at 8 weeks), were fertile, and exhibited no apparent clinical abnormalities up to 10 months of age. There were no microscopic abnormalities in the CysLT2 receptor-null mice (data not shown). Because mouse CysLT2 receptor mRNA is most abundantly expressed in the lung, spleen, and small intestine by Northern blot analysis (22Ogasawara H. Ishii S. Yokomizo T. Kakinuma T. Komine M. Tamaki K.

Chem. 2001; 276: 47489-47495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), we examined whether homologous recombination by the targeting vector disrupted expression of the CysLT2 receptor mRNA in these tissues. By Northern blot analysis with poly(A)+ RNAs, a 5.5-kb band was dominantly detected as previously reported (22Ogasawara H. Ishii S. Yokomizo T. Kakinuma T. Komine M. Tamaki K. Shimizu T. Izumi T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18763-18768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) and a 1.8-kb band that is considered to be the mature transcript based on its size (23Hui Y. Yang G. Galczenski H. Figueroa D.J. Austin C.P. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Funk C.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47489-47495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) was also faintly detected in these tissues of the wild-type mice. In contrast, those bands were not detected in the samples from CysLT2 receptor-null mice, although a 9-kb band was detected in the spleen of CysLT2 receptor-null mice (Fig. 1C). Because we used a CysLT2 receptor coding region probe, the 9-kb band was considered to be an unstable transcript that contained part of exon VI. Expression of an aberrant and unstable transcript was also the case for the LTC4 synthase-null mice (34Kanaoka Y. Maekawa A. Penrose J.F. Austen K.F. Lam B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22608-22613Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Importantly, there was no change in the CysLT1 receptor mRNA expression in these tissues by the disruption of the CysLT2 receptor gene (Fig. 1C). Role of the CysLT2 Receptor in Zymosan A-induced Peritoneal Inflammation—Although we previously demonstrated that the early plasma protein extravasation in zymosan A-induced peritoneal inflammation is reduced by ∼50% in LTC4 synthase-null mice (34Kanaoka Y.

Chem. 2002; 277: 20820-20824Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), we performed the same study to determine whether there exists any role for the CysLT2 receptor. Plasma protein extravasation assessed 30 to 240 min after zymosan A injection in CysLT2 receptor-null mice was similar at all time points compared with that of the wild-type mice (Fig. 2A). We also examined neutrophil infiltration, which generally peaks 240 min after the injection of zymosan A (32Shi Z.Z. Han B. Habib G.M. Matzuk M.M. Lieberman M.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 5389-5395Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 38Doherty N.S. Poubelle P. Borgeat P. Beaver T.H. Westrich G.L. Schrader N.L.

As assessed with neutrophil counts 240 min after the injection, there was no significant difference in neutrophil infiltration between CysLT2 receptor-null and wild-type mice (Fig. 2B). Role of the CysLT2 Receptor in Mast Cell-dependent PCA—We previously demonstrated that the local edema induced by IgE-dependent PCA is reduced by 50% in the LTC4 synthase-null mice as compared with their wild-type littermates (34Kanaoka Y.

Three main pathways have been shown to influence lifespan, the insulin/insulin-like growth factor-1 pathway, the silent regulator pathway, and the target of rapamycin pathway. Among many proteins influencing lifespan, two transcription factors, FOXO and the heat shock factor, have been shown to be involved in the aging process and in small heat shock proteins (sHsps) expression following stress and during lifespan. We have recently shown that overexpressing the mitochondrial Hsp22 increases Drosophila melanogaster lifespan by 32% and resistance to oxidative stress. Here we show that flies that are not expressing this mitochondrial small Hsp22 have a 40% decrease in lifespan. These flies die faster than their matched control and display a decrease of 30% in locomotor activity compared with controls. The absence of Hsp22 also sensitizes flies to mild stress. These data support a key role of sHsps in aging and underline the importance of mitochondrial sHsps in this process.

The SIR pathway also involves modulation of gene expression but by making large chromosomal regions transcriptionally inactive. Hence, overexpression of SIR proteins extends lifespan by making life-shortening genes inaccessible for the transcriptional machinery (7Kennedy B.K. Gotta M. Sinclair D.A. Mills K. McNabb D.S.

Aging Cell. 2003; 2: 131-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). In the same organism, a link between the heat shock factor (HSF) and Daf-16 has been demonstrated in both the insulin/IGF-1 signaling pathway and the heat shock response (32Hsu A.L. Murphy C.T.

This study has also revealed the importance of a functional HSF in determination of aging and has identified shsp genes as common targets for HSF and Daf-16 activity. We have recently shown that overexpressing a mitochondrial sHsp (Hsp22) in all cells or specifically in motorneurons using the GAL4/UAS binary system increases D. melanogaster mean lifespan by up to 32% (18Morrow G. Samson M. Michaud S. Tanguay R.M. FASEB J. 2004; 18: 598-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Moreover, flies displaying an increased longevity maintain their locomotor activity for a longer period and are also more resistant to various stresses. To confirm that this mitochondrial sHsp is important in the aging process of D. melanogaster, we have now examined the longevity phenotype of a strain obtained by P-element jump-out, which does not express Hsp22 in response to stress nor during aging. Our results show that these flies display a decrease in mean lifespan of 40% and are sensitive to stress. These results confirm the key role of mitochondrial sHsps in aging determination. Drosophila Strains, Maintenance, and Longevity Assay—EP(3) 3583-11 (Flybase ID: FBti0023680) and EP(3)3583-18 flies have been obtained by jump-out in a study on P-element local transposition in the male germ line cells of D. melanogaster (33Timakov B. Liu X. Turgut I. Zhang P. Genetics. 2002; 160: 1011-1022PubMed Google Scholar). The genetic background of the two strains is the same except for the newly inserted P-element, which is located at –57 bp and –350 bp of the hsp22 transcription starting site in EP(3)3583-11 and EP(3)3583-18 flies, respectively (Ref. 33Timakov B. Liu X. Turgut I. Zhang P. Genetics. 2002; 160: 1011-1022PubMed Google Scholar; see Fig. 1). Flies were maintained at 25 °C on standard cornmeal/agar medium. Heat shock was performed by incubation for 1 h at 35 °C, the optimal temperature for induction of sHsps, followed by a recovery of 2 h at 25 °C. For longevity experiments, cohorts of male flies (15 per vial) were transferred to fresh medium every 3–4 days and scored for survivors every 2 days. The starting population for each genotype was 210. For analysis, the premortality phase (less than 10% mortality) and the mean lifespan (50% survival) were calculated. For thermal stress resistance assays, 2-day-old flies were kept at 30 or 37 °C until death. PCR Analysis—Genomic DNA was prepared from flies of both genotypes as described in Huang et al. (34Huang A.M. Rehm E.J. Rubin G.M. Sullivan W. Ashburner M. Hawley R.S. Drosophila Protocols. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000: 429-437Google Scholar). PCR reactions were performed with Pp31 and Pg-A5 primers (200 ng; Ref. 33Timakov B. Liu X. Turgut I. Zhang P. Genetics. 2002; 160: 1011-1022PubMed Google Scholar) to which have been added 100 ng of genomic DNA, 5 μl of 10× buffer number 3 (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.2, 160 mm (NH4)2SO4, 22.5 mm MgCl2, 20% Me2SO and 1% Tween 20), 10 μl of 5 mm dNTP and 2 μl of Taq polymerase (Amersham Biosciences). The reaction mixtures were covered with mineral oil and incubated for 5 min at 95 °C, followed by 30 cycles of 1 min at 95 °C, 1 min at 60 °C, and 1 min at 72 °C and a final elongation of 5 min at 72 °C. Negative Geotaxis Assay—The negative geotaxis assay was conducted as described in Morrow et al. (18Morrow G. Samson M. Michaud S. Tanguay R.M. FASEB J. 2004; 18: 598-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Briefly, flies were transferred in clean empty vials (16 × 125 mm) and allowed to adapt to their environment for 8 s. Flies were than tapped gently to the bottom of the tube, and flies having climbed higher than 7 cm in 8 s were scored. The assay was conducted three times on 105 flies of each cohort. The results are expressed in percentage of flies having climbed above 7 cm in 8 s. Protein Analysis—Protein extracts from flies of each genotype were separated on 12% SDS-PAGE as described in Morrow et al. (35Morrow G. Inaguma Y. Kato K. Tanguay R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31204-31210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Following transfer onto nitrocellulose membranes, Western blots were performed using antibodies specific to Hsp22 (1/5,000; Ref. 35Morrow G. Inaguma Y. Kato K. Tanguay R.M. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 1990; 52: 147-156PubMed Google Scholar) and secondary antibodies coupled to peroxidase (1/20,000, Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories). Chemiluminescent detection was done with Western Lightning Chemiluminescence Reagent as described by the manufacturer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The EP(3)3583-11 and EP(3)3583-18 flies were obtained from the same starting strain in a study on P-element local transposition (33Timakov B. Liu X. Turgut I. Zhang P. Genetics. 2002; 160: 1011-1022PubMed Google Scholar). The location of the newly inserted P-element was analyzed by PCR amplification using primers specific to the P-element and hsp22 coding sequence. In EP(3)3583-18 flies, the P-element is inserted at position -350 from the hsp22 transcription starting site, and as expected, a PCR amplification with the two primers gives a product at 904 bp, while in EP(3)3583-11 flies, the P-element is inserted at position –57 and the PCR product has 611 bp (Fig. 1B). Heat shock elements (HSEs) are DNA sequences recognized by HSF, the transcription factor responsible for Hsps expression following stress. Studies on hsp22 promoter have revealed that three functional HSEs are required for the proper expression of Hsp22 following stress (40Klemenz R. Gehring W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 2011-2019Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) and during aging (41King V. Tower J. Dev. Biol. 1999; 207: 107-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Since the P-element in EP(3)3583-11 flies is located between the three HSEs and the TATA box on hsp22 promoter (Fig. 1A), we performed a heat shock on homozygous flies to determine their level of Hsp22 expression. As shown in Fig. 2A, 10-day-old homozygous EP(3)3583-18 flies, which have the insertion upstream of the HSEs, express a large amount of Hsp22 following heat shock, while only traces of Hsp22 are detected in EP(3)3583-11 flies. In addition, during aging homozygous EP(3)3583-11 flies show no expression of Hsp22 as compared with EP(3)3583-18 flies. The expression of other Hsps such as Hsp23, Hsp26, Hsp27, Hsp60, Hsp70, and Hsp83 was the same in the two strains following heat shock and during aging thereby ruling out a possible defect in HSF activity in the two strains (Fig. 2). The distance between HSEs and the TATA box in the hsp22 promoter of EP(3)3583-11 flies could account for the absence of Hsp22 expression during aging and following stress. Indeed, due to the presence of the P-element, it is possible that the promoter architecture is not optimal thereby preventing one or more factors such as GAGA factor, TFIID, RNA polymerase II, and HSF to bind DNA (42Shopland L.S. Hirayoshi K. Fernandes M. Lis J.T. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2756-2769Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 43Quivy J.-P. Becker P.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 256: 249-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) and/or interact with each other (44Mason Jr., P.B. Lis J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33227-33233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). To assess the key role of Hsp22 in the aging process, longevity experiments were conducted on homozygous EP(3)3583-18 and EP(3)3583-11 flies. While EP(3)3583-18 flies have a mean lifespan of 61.5 ± 3.4 days, EP(3)3583-11 flies that do not express Hsp22 have a mean lifespan of 43.9 ± 3.7 days (Fig. 3), which represents a decrease of 40%. In addition to a shorter life, EP(3)3583-11 flies enter rapidly in the mortality phase (<90% survival, day 3 ± 0.4 compared with day 16.9 ± 5.3 for EP(3)3583-18 flies). Flies not expressing Hsp22 also have a reduced locomotor activity of 7.9 ± 7.8% as assessed by a negative geotaxis experiment on 20-day-old flies compared with 37.4 ± 7.7% for EP(3)3583-18 flies. These results clearly demonstrate the involvement of Hsp22 in the aging process. The resistance to heat of flies not expressing Hsp22 was also evaluated. Homozygous EP(3)3583-11 flies have a mean lifespan of 11.9 ± 2.7 days at 30 °C compared with 20.3 ± 0.9 days for EP(3)3583-18 flies, which represents a decrease of nearly 50% (Fig. 4A). However, the survival of homozygous EP(3)3583-11 flies was not statistically different from the survival of EP(3)3583-18 flies at 37 °C (667.4 ± 89.5 h versus 442.8 ± 203.9 h, Fig. 4B). The present results clearly demonstrate that Hsp22 is a key player in the aging process as its absence shortens flies lifespan by 40%. To our knowledge, this is the first time that such an impact is observed for an individual Hsp. In C. elegans, shsp RNAi has been shown to shortens lifespan of wild-type animals by less than 25% (32Hsu A.L. Murphy C.T. Kenyon C. Science. 2003; 300: 1142-1145Crossref PubMed Scopus (1126) Google Scholar). The drastic effect obtained in the absence of Hsp22 could be due to its particular intramitochondrial localization (35Morrow G. Inaguma Y. Kato K. Tanguay R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31204-31210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Indeed, mitochondria are known to be sensitive to stress and to aging (reviewed in Ref. 45Anson R.M. Hansford R.G. Aging Cell. 2004; 3: 29-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), and it is possible that the presence of Hsp22 in this organelle helps to maintain mitochondrial integrity and function. This could be achieved by its chaperone-like activity on damaged proteins. 2G. Morrow, A. Kaldis, J. J. Heikkila, and R. M. Tanguay, submitted for publication. The requirement of Hsp22 for good health is also visible when flies are exposed to mild thermal stress such as 30 °C, but we did not observe any effect of the absence of Hsp22 on resistance to 37 °C. This is likely due to the fact that this robust stress involves a drastic accumulation of damages to the whole cells. Important findings have been made on the aging process recently. Indeed, it seems that specific cell types direct the longevity fate of the whole organism. In C. elegans long-lived daf-2(–) mutants, longevity was restored to normal by overexpressing wild-type Daf-2 in neurons, while there were no changes if wild-type Daf-2 was expressed in muscles or intestinal cells (46Wolkow C.A. Kimura K.D. Lee M.S. Ruvkun G. Science. 2000; 290: 147-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar). In D. melanogaster, overexpressing dFOXO in the adult fat body was sufficient to increase lifespan and resistance to paraquat (47Ginnakou M.E. Goss M. Jünger M.A. Hafen E. Leevers S.J. Partridge L. Science. 2004; 305: 361Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). Hwangbo et al. (11Hwangbo D.S. Gersham B. Tu M.-P. Palmer M. Tatar M. Nature. 2004; 429: 562-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that the activation of dFOXO in pericerebral fat body reduces the expression of an insulin-like peptide in neurons. Inhibition of the TOR signaling pathway in the fat body was also sufficient to increase lifespan (9Kapahi P. Zid B.M. Harper T. Koslover D. Sapin V. Benzer S. Curr. Biol. 2004; 14: 885-890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1030) Google Scholar). Moreover, HSF has been pointed out to have a major role in the regulation of longevity in C. elegans (32Hsu A.L. Murphy C.T. Kenyon C. Science. 2003; 300: 1142-1145Crossref PubMed Scopus (1126) Google Scholar, 48Morley J.F. Morimoto R.I. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 657-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar), and sHsps have been shown to be targets of HSF and Daf-16 (32Hsu A.L. Murphy C.T. Kenyon C. Science. 2003; 300: 1142-1145Crossref PubMed Scopus (1126) Google Scholar). A key role of sHsps in neurodegenerative diseases has also been suggested. Indeed, shsp RNAi accelerates the onset of polyglutamine aggregates in C. elegans, while RNAi for the other hsps did not have any effects (32Hsu A.L. Murphy C.T. Kenyon C. Science. 2003; 300: 1142-1145Crossref PubMed Scopus (1126) Google Scholar). The present work reinforces the idea that sHsps are key factors in the aging process and shows that mitochondrial sHsps are particularly important as no such impact on lifespan have been obtained with other sHsps (32Hsu A.L. Murphy C.T. Kenyon C. Science. 2003; 300: 1142-1145Crossref PubMed Scopus (1126) Google Scholar). Therefore, the intracellular localization of life-promoting genes appears as important as their expression in specific cell types in the determination of longevity. Altogether, these results suggest that sHsps are good targets to delay aging and perhaps the onset of neuro-degenerative diseases."

Leukemia-associated RhoGEF (LARG) belongs to a small subfamily of RhoGEFs that are RhoA-selective and directly activated by the Gα12/13 family of heterotrimeric G proteins. Herein we describe the atomic structures of the catalytic Dbl homology (DH) and pleckstrin homology (PH) domains of LARG alone and in complex with RhoA. These structures demonstrate that the DH/PH domains of LARG can undergo a dramatic conformational change upon binding RhoA, wherein both the DH and PH domains directly engage RhoA. Through mutational analysis we show that full nucleotide exchange activity requires a novel N-terminal extension on the DH domain that is predicted to exist in a broader family of RhoGEFs that includes p115-RhoGEF, Lbc, Lfc, Net1, and Xpln, and identify regions within the LARG PH domain that contribute to its ability to facilitate nucleotide exchange in vitro. In crystals of the DH/PH-RhoA complex, the active site of RhoA adopts two distinct GDP-excluding conformations among the four unique complexes in the asymmetric unit. Similar changes were previously observed in structures of nucleotide-free Ras and Ef-Tu. A potential protein-docking site on the LARG PH domain is also evident and appears to be conserved throughout the Lbc subfamily of RhoGEFs.

Rho GTPases are molecular switches that cycle between an active GTP-bound and an inactive GDP-bound state. In their activated form, Rho GTPases bind to effector proteins that regulate the actin cytoskeleton, gene expression, and cell cycle progression (1Etienne-Manneville S. Hall A. Nature. 2002; 420: 629-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (3767) Google Scholar). Members of the three principal Rho GTPase subfamilies (Rho, Cdc42, and Rac) exert distinct morphological effects on cells and promote transcriptional activation through unique pathways. All are thought to play important roles in cellular transformation and metastasis (2Jaffe A.B. Hall A. Adv. Cancer Res. 2002; 84: 57-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 3Sahai E. Marshall C.J. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 133-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (1207) Google Scholar).

Hall A. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1587-1609Crossref PubMed Scopus (967) Google Scholar). In most Dbl family RhoGEFs, the DH domain is positioned immediately N-terminal to a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain. Structures of DH/PH tandem domains from several RhoGEFs have been determined, either alone (Sos, Trio-N, and Dbs) (5Soisson S.M. Nimnual A.S. Uy M. Bar-Sagi D. Kuriyan J.

Biol. 2002; 9: 468-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). The DH domain is an oblong helical bundle that facilitates nucleotide exchange by forming a stable complex with a nucleotide-free conformation of the Rho GTPase. The bulk of the DH domain-GTPase interface is formed between residues in the α1, α5, and α6 segments of the DH domain and the switch 1 and 2 elements of the GTPase. These contacts are highly conserved and define the basis for disruption of the nucleotide and magnesium binding sites of the GTPase. Based on the various DH/PH-GTPase crystal structures and biochemical studies (10Snyder J.T. Worthylake D.K. Rossman K.L. Betts L. Pruitt W.M. Siderovski D.P. Der C.J. Sondek J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 468-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar), the α4-α5 loop region of the DH domain was shown to be important for determining specificity, because it interacts with subfamily-specific residues near the N terminus of the GTPase. Tiam1 is selective for Rac1, intersectin for Cdc42, and Dbs for both Cdc42 and RhoA. However, no structures have yet been reported for a RhoA-selective DH domain. The core of the RhoGEF PH domain is a flattened, seven-stranded β-barrel capped with a characteristic C-terminal helix (αC). The role of the PH domain is complex and varies among RhoGEF subfamilies. The PH domain can help localize Rho-GEFs to membranes (6Skowronek K.R. Guo F. Zheng Y. Nassar N. J. Biol.

The PH domain may also target the RhoGEF directly to the cytoskeleton where many downstream effectors of RhoA are found (14Glaven J.A. Whitehead I. Bagrodia S. Kay R. Cerione R.A. J. Biol.

For example, residues within the PH domain of Dbs interact directly with the bound Rho GTPase (9Rossman K.L. Worthylake D.K. Snyder J.T. Siderovski D.P. Campbell S.L. Sondek J.

Methods Enzymol. 2000; 325: 25-38Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Conversely, the PH domains of Sos and the C-terminal DH/PH domains of Trio appear to inhibit nucleotide exchange (16Bellanger J.M.

Leukemia-associated RhoGEF (LARG) and its close homologs, p115-RhoGEF and PDZ-RhoGEF, are RhoA-selective RhoGEFs that are directly regulated by activated Ga12/13 proteins and thereby play a key role in oncogenic transformation induced by G protein-coupled receptors (23Whitehead I.P.

Whereas the contributions of the LARG and other RhoGEF PH domains toward nucleotide exchange in vitro are relatively small (2- to 24-fold), it is anticipated that they have much more profound effects in vivo, as was shown for Dbs (18Rossman K.L.

To better understand the structure and regulation of human LARG, we initiated crystallographic studies of its DH/PH domains (32Kristelly R. Earnest B.T. Krishnamoorthy L. Tesmer J.J. Acta Crystallogr. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 2003; 59: 1859-1862Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Herein we report atomic structures of the DH/PH domains of LARG and their complex with a soluble (unprenylated) form of human RhoA. These structures reveal novel interactions between the LARG DH and PH domains and RhoA. Using site-directed mutagenesis and fluorescence-based nucleotide-exchange assays, we show that these interactions are important for LARG-mediated nucleotide exchange in vitro. Cloning, Expression, and Protein Purification—The cloning, expression, and purification of the LARG DH/PH fragment and TEV protein were as previously described (32Kristelly R. Earnest B.T. Krishnamoorthy L. Tesmer J.J. Acta Crystallogr. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 2003; 59: 1859-1862Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). DNA encoding the LARG DH domain (residues 765–986) was cloned into a modified pMAL expression vector (pMALc2H10T) using BamHI and SalI restriction sites. The pMALc2H10T expression vector was generated by inserting oligonucleotides encoding a decahistidine (H10) tag followed by a TEV protease recognition site between AvaI and EcoRI of the pMALc2X vector (New England Biolabs). Expression and purification of the LARG DH domain was as described previously for the DH/PH domains except that protein was expressed at 20 °C, the MBP-DH fusion protein was dialyzed against buffer containing 100 mm NaCl, and finally digested with 2% (w/w) TEV protease. Fractions containing the DH domain were pooled, concentrated to ∼5 mg/ml, and stored at -80 °C. The DNA sequence encoding 1–193 of human RhoA was cloned from the pGEXKG-RhoA vector (T. Kozasa, University of Illinois at Chicago, Medical Center) into pMALc2H10T using the EcoRI and SalI restriction sites. Protein expression from Rosetta (DE3) pLysS cells transformed with the pMALc2H10T-RhoA vector was induced with 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 30 °C and harvested after 4–6 h. Lysis and purification was as described above for the LARG DH domain, except that cells were lysed in the presence of 50 μm GDP. Buffers for nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid columns also contained 10% glycerol, 10 mm MgCl2, and 5 μm GDP, and the gel filtration buffer contained 1 mm MgCl2 and 40 μm GDP. RhoA was concentrated to ∼5 mg/ml and stored at -80 °C. The coding region for residues 1–192 of human Rac1 and residues 1–191 of human Cdc42 were amplified from pCDNA-rac1 and pCDNA-cdc42 (gifts from S. Dharmawardhane, University of Texas at Austin), and then cloned into the pMALC2H10T vector using the EcoRI/SalI sites. The proteins were then purified as described above for RhoA. Purification of the RhoA-DH/PH Complex—The DH/PH domains of LARG were mixed with a 2-fold molar excess of RhoA and diluted 10-fold with complex buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol). After incubation for 10 min on ice, the complex was loaded onto an S200 16/60 size-exclusion column pre-equilibrated in complex buffer supplemented with 1 mm EDTA. Fractions containing the 1:1 RhoA-DH/PH complex were pooled, concentrated to about 8 mg/ml, and stored at -80 °C until crystallization. Crystallization and Data Collection—Crystallization of and data collection from the LARG DH/PH domains were described previously (32Kristelly R. Earnest B.T. Krishnamoorthy L. Tesmer J.J. Acta Crystallogr. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 2003; 59: 1859-1862Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) (Table I). DH/PH-RhoA complex crystals were formed by vapor diffusion using wells containing 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 11% PEG 8K, 0.6 m NaCl, and 5 mm EDTA. The crystals grew as long rods that can approach 1 mm in length and have 72% solvent content. Native data from the DH/PH-RhoA complex were collected from a single crystal at 90 K harvested in cryoprotectant solution (15% PEG 400, 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 20 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 15% PEG 8K, 0.6 m NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, and 2 mm dithiothreitol) on beam line 8.2.1 at the Advanced Light Source, Lawrence Berkeley National Lab (Table I).

Xenon and NaBr derivatives were generated as described previously (32Kristelly R. Earnest B.T. Krishnamoorthy L. Tesmer J.J. Acta Crystallogr. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 2003; 59: 1859-1862Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) and a homology model of the LARG DH domain, based on that of intersectin (10Snyder J.T. Worthylake D.K. Rossman K.L. Betts L. Pruitt W.M. Siderovski D.P. Der C.J. Sondek J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 468-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar), was manually placed into the resulting MIRAS-phased electron density map. Phases from molecular replacement and MIRAS were then combined, and the DH domain was refined using CNS (34Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16917) Google Scholar). Subsequently, a solvent-flattened electron density map allowed placement of a homology model of the LARG PH domain. The structure was refined using rounds of maximum-likelihood refinement by either CNS or REFMAC (35Bailey S. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) alternating with model building in the program O (36Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (12999) Google Scholar). In the final rounds of refinement, individual isotropic B-factors were used in conjunction with TLS refinement (37Winn M.D. Isupov M.N. Murshudov G.N. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 122-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (1639) Google Scholar). Modeling of the DH/PH domains was ultimately assisted by the structure of the DH/PH-RhoA complex, which facilitated interpretation of poorly ordered regions of the structure, particularly the N-terminal extension of the DH domain, and the β1-β2 and βN-αN loops of the PH domain. The 3.2-Å crystal structure of the LARG DH/PH-RhoA complex was determined by molecular replacement using as a search model the LARG DH domain modeled in complex with nucleotide-free RhoA (10Snyder J.T. Worthylake D.K. Rossman K.L. Betts L. Pruitt W.M. Siderovski D.P. Der C.J. Sondek J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 468-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). The PH domains of the four complexes in the asymmetric unit were later fit by hand. The structure was refined and built as described for the LARG DH/PH domains, except that 4-fold NCS restraints were imposed on structurally equivalent regions of each DH/PH-RhoA complex throughout refinement using REFMAC. As structural differences between subunits became apparent, these restraints were gradually loosened and/or eliminated. For all DH domains and RhoA subunits, main-chain and side-chain densities are well defined. The A and C chain PH domains are better ordered than the E and G PH domains and have even more ordered loops than the PH domain of the 2.1-Å uncomplexed structure. To verify the resulting model, σA-weighted phases (38Read R.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1986; 42: 140-149Crossref Scopus (2035) Google Scholar) were generated from the coordinates and refined with twenty cycles of solvent flattening and averaging in the program DM (39Cowtan K. Joint CCP4 ESF-EACBM Newsletter Prot. Crystallogr. 1994; 31: 34-38Google Scholar). Multidomain 4-fold averaging was used for all parts of the structure except for the RhoA subunits, which were subjected to 3-fold averaging owing to the observed conformational change in the B chain, whose density was omitted from averaging. Correlation between the averaged DM map and the 2|Fo| - |Fc| Fourier map generated by REFMAC was 95% for main-chain atoms and 92% for side-chain atoms. The omit map shown in Fig. 5a was generated in a similar fashion, except that the B chain of RhoA was left out of the initial model used to generate phases. Two residues in each subunit of LARG, Ser-833 and Asp-1054, fall within the disallowed region of the Ramachandran plot. In other atomic structures of DH domains, residues equivalent to Ser833 have the same strained backbone stereochemistry. Asp-1054 exists in the i+1 position of a type I β-turn in the PH domain, a position usually occupied by glycine. In the DH/PH structure, the residue Asn-765 of the DH domain and residues 999–1007 in the βN-αN loop and 1062–1074 in the β4 strand of the PH domain could not be modeled. In the “A” and “C” DH/PH chains of the LARG DH/PH-RhoA complex, Asp-765 at the N terminus and residues 1064–1074 in the β4 insertion of the PH domain do not have interpretable electron density and were not modeled. In the “E” and “G” DH/PH chains, the PH domains were substantially more disordered, and various additional loops between secondary structural elements could not be modeled. Refinement statistics for the LARG DH/PH and DH/PH-RhoA structure determinations are shown in Table I. Atomic coordinates and structure factor files have been deposited for the LARG DH/PH domain and the LARG DH/PH-RhoA complex in the Protein Data Bank with accession codes 1TXD and 1X86, respectively. Visual representations of the models were created using PyMOL (40.DeLano, W. (2002), 0.93 Ed., DeLano Scientific, San Carlos, CAGoogle Scholar). DH/PH and RhoA Mutagenesis and Purification of Mutants—DH/PH-W769A, DH/PH-W769D, DH/PH-ΔN, DH/PH-E1023A, DH/PH-E1023R, and DH/PH-S1118D mutants were generated in the pMALc2TH6-DH/PH bacterial expression vector by site-directed mutagenesis using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). RhoA mutants RhoA-V33E, RhoA-K27T, RhoA-R68A, and RhoA-E97A were produced from pMALc2H10T-RhoA. The complete coding sequence for each of the mutant proteins was verified by DNA sequencing. The DH/PH and RhoA mutant constructs were expressed and purified as described above for the wild-type proteins. Nucleotide Exchange Assay—GTPases were loaded with N-methylanthraniloyl-GDP (mant-GDP; Jena Bioscience) by incubating 180 μm RhoA with a 10-fold molar excess of mant-GDP in loading buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 4 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol) for 1.5 h on ice. Subsequently, the mant-GDP-loaded GTPase was stabilized by addition of MgCl2 to a final concentration of 10 mm and incubated for an additional 30 min on ice. mant-GDP-loaded GTPase was then exchanged into reaction buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol) via a G10 gel filtration column pre-equilibrated with reaction buffer to remove excess nucleotides. Fluorescence assays were performed on a Fluoromax-3 spectrophotometer at 25 °C (λex = 280 nm, λem = 430 nm, slits = 2/2 nm), in which 1 μm of each mant-GDP-loaded GTPase was incubated with 100 μm GTP in reaction buffer in a 200-μl cuvette. The exchange reaction was then started by the addition of 100 nm LARG fragment, and kobs was determined by modeling each trace as a one-phase exponential decay using the program Prism version 4.0. All proteins were purified to greater than 95% homogeneity as judged by SDS-PAGE, and their concentrations were determined using the BCA protein assay (Pierce). The Structure of the LARG DH/PH Domains—As in previously determined DH domain structures, the core of the LARG DH domain is comprised of six major helical segments (9Rossman K.L. Worthylake D.K. Snyder J.T. Siderovski D.P. Campbell S.L. Sondek J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1315-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar), wherein segments 2, 3, and 5 are broken into several distinct α-helices (Fig. 1a). The LARG DH domain, however, has a novel N-terminal extension (residues 766–781) composed of two short helices, αN1 and αN2, that bury the side chain of Trp-769 against the α1 helix of the DH domain (Figs. 1a and 2a). This extension was included in the DH/PH fragment used for crystallization because of its high sequence homology among the Lbc subfamily of RhoGEFs (4Schmidt A. Hall A. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1587-1609Crossref PubMed Scopus (967) Google Scholar), which includes the RH-RhoGEFs, Lbc, Lfc, Net1, Xpln, and intersectin (Fig. 2b). Otherwise, the LARG DH domain is quite similar to that of its closest homolog of known structure, intersectin (r.m.s.d. of 1.3 Å for 187 equivalent Cα atoms), whose structure was determined without the corresponding N-terminal extension (10Snyder J.T. Worthylake D.K. Rossman K.L. Betts L. Pruitt W.M. Siderovski D.P. Der C.J. Sondek J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 468-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). The most pronounced difference between the LARG and intersectin DH domains occurs within the region spanning the α2-α3 loop and the first helix of the third helical segment, which is on the opposite side of the DH domain from the GTPase binding site.Fig. 2The αN1/αN2 extension of LARG. a, structure of the αN1/αN2 extension and its contacts with the switch 1 region of RhoA. Side chains that contribute to the small hydrophobic core of the extension are shown except for Gln789 from α1, whose side-chain packs against Trp-769. Several hydrogen bonds (dashed yellow lines) also likely stabilize the extension: the side chain of Glu-790 forms two backbone hydrogen bonds with the N terminus of αN1, and a backbone carbonyl in the α2-α3 loop forms a hydrogen bond"

Living species are all semi-aquatic, with sprawling limbs and a broad body that moves mainly from side-to-side2; however, fossils indicate that they evolved from terrestrial forms. The most cursorial of these fossils3,4,5,6 are small, gracile forms often grouped together as the Sphenosuchia, with fully erect, slender limbs; their relationships, however, are poorly understood5,7,8,9,10. A new crocodylomorph from deposits in northwestern China of the poorly known Middle Jurassic epoch possesses a skull with several adaptations typical of living crocodylians. Postcranially it is similar to sphenosuchians but with even greater adaptations for cursoriality in the forelimb. Here we show, through phylogenetic analysis, that it is the closest relative of the large group Crocodyliformes, including living crocodylians. Thus, important features of the modern crocodylian skull evolved during a phase when the postcranial skeleton was evolving towards greater cursoriality, rather than towards their current semi-aquatic habitus."
https://openalex.org/W2129019768,"Lipid transfer proteins are important in membrane vesicle biogenesis and trafficking, signal transduction and immunological presentation processes1,2,3. The conserved and ubiquitous mammalian glycolipid transfer proteins (GLTPs) serve as potential regulators of cell processes mediated by glycosphingolipids, ranging from differentiation and proliferation to invasive adhesion, neurodegeneration and apoptosis4,5. Here we report crystal structures of apo-GLTP (1.65 Å resolution) and lactosylceramide-bound (1.95 Å) GLTP, in which the bound glycosphingolipid is sandwiched, after adaptive recognition, within a previously unknown two-layer all-α-helical topology. Glycosphingolipid binding specificity is achieved through recognition and anchoring of the sugar-amide headgroup to the GLTP recognition centre by hydrogen bond networks and hydrophobic contacts, and encapsulation of both lipid chains, in a precisely oriented manner within a ‘moulded-to-fit’ hydrophobic tunnel. A cleft-like conformational gating mechanism, involving two interhelical loops and one α-helix of GLTP, could enable the glycolipid chains to enter and leave the tunnel in the membrane-associated state. Mutation and functional analyses of residues in the glycolipid recognition centre and within the hydrophobic tunnel support a framework for understanding how GLTPs acquire and release glycosphingolipids during lipid intermembrane transfer and presentation processes."

These reports suggest a role for menin in the regulation of gene transcription.Menin has also been shown to participate in the regulation of cell proliferation and genome stability. For instance, ectopic expression of menin in Ras-transformed NIH3T3 cells represses cell proliferation as well as tumorigenesis (10Kim Y.S. Burns A.L. Goldsmith P.K. Heppner C. Park S.Y.

In addition, overexpression of menin inhibits the proliferation of a rat insulinoma cell line (11Sayo Y. Murao K. Imachi H. Cao W.M. Sato M. Dobashi H. Wong N.C. Ishida T. Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 2437-2440Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar).

Many tumor suppressors are involved in the regulation of multiple cellular processes. For example, Brca1, a tumor suppressor mutated in patients with inherited breast cancer, is also involved in the regulation of gene transcription, cell proliferation, and genome stability (20Scully R. Livingston D.M. Nature. 2000; 408: 429-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar, 21Gadhavi P.L. Greenwood M.D. Strom M. King I.A. Buxton R.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 281: 520-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Recently, Brca1 has been shown to directly bind DNA in a sequence-independent manner (22Paull T.T. Cortez D. Bowers B. Elledge S.J. Gellert M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6086-6091Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar).Given the fact that menin associates with various DNA-binding proteins as well as chromatin (4Poisson A. Zablewska B. Gaudray P. Cancer Letters. 2003; 189: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 18Jin S. Mao H. Schnepp R.W. Sykes S.M. Silva A.C. D'Andrea A.D. Hua X. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 4204-4210PubMed Google Scholar), we sought to test whether menin directly binds DNA and, if it does, whether binding to DNA is crucial for the function of menin in regulating cell proliferation. In the current studies, we demonstrate that menin directly binds DNA. Menin also binds a variety of other DNA structures and the COOH terminus of menin is responsible for direct binding to DNA. Importantly, MEN1 patient-derived mutations in the COOH terminus abolish the ability of menin to bind DNA and also fail to repress cell proliferation. These results uncover a mechanistic link between DNA binding by menin and its role in repressing cell proliferation.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPlasmid Construction—Oligonucleotides were synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc. To generate GST-F1, GST-F2, and GST-F3, which encode amino acid residues 1–218, 219–395, and 396–610, respectively, these menin fragments were amplified by PCR and cloned into the BamHI/NotI site of pGEX-6P (Amersham Biosciences). To generate mutations in the carboxyl terminus of menin, GST-F3 was mutated by site-directed mutagenesis to generate GST-F3–527X, GST-F3–558X, GST-F3-NLS1pm, GST-F3-NLS2pm, and GST-F3-NLS1+2pm, using a QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). To express full-length menin, the PCR amplified cDNA was cloned into pET21b (Novagen), and the protein was expressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21 (DE3) as COOH-terminal His6-tagged proteins. The retroviral expression construct for either menin or the FLAG epitope-tagged menin was generated as previously described (18Jin S. Mao H. Schnepp R.W. Sykes S.M. Silva A.C. D'Andrea A.D. Hua X. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 4204-4210PubMed Google Scholar), and its various NLS mutants were also generated by site-directed mutagenesis.Gel Shift Assays—The DNA probes for gel shift assays were radiolabeled in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase (23Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning, A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratories Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar). The four different structures of oligonucleotide DNA were as follows: linearized double strand (ds) DNA (5′-CTGCAGGGTTTTTGTTCCAGTCTGTAGCACTGTGTAAGACAGGCCA-3′ and its antisense sequence), Y-structure (5′-GGCTTAGACACTGTGCACAGTGCTACAGACTGGAACAAAAACCCTGCAG-3′ and 5′-CTGCAGGGTTTTTGTTCCAGTCTGTAGCACTGTGGAAGACAGGCC AGATC-3′), branched structure (the Y-structure annealed with 5′-CACAGTGTCTAAGCC-3′), and 4-way junction structure (5′-TGCATGCTGAGACTTCTCATTACACAGTGCTACAGACTGGAACAAAAACCCTGCAG-3′, 5′-GACCTGGCACGTAGGACAGCATGGGATCTGGCCTGTCTTACAGTACAATGCATTGTACATGAACGTAGCATC-3′, 5′-GATGCTACGTTCATGTACAATGCATTGTACTGTAATGAGAAGTCTCAGCATGCA-3′, and 5′-CTGCAGGGTTTTTGTTCCAGTCTGTAGCACTGTGTAAGACAGGCC AGATCCCATGCTGTCCTACGTGCCAGGTC-3′), as previously described (22Paull T.T. Cortez D. Bowers B. Elledge S.J. Gellert M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6086-6091Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). The sequence of the DNA for generating probes with random sequences was 5′-CACTCGAGGGATCCGAATTC-N(25)-TCTAGAAAGCTTGTCGACGC-3′, as previously described (24Zawel L. Dai J.L. Buckhaults P. Zhou S.

The plasmid DNA, puc19 (Invitrogen), was linearized with BamHI, dephosphorylated with calf intestine phosphatase, and end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP in the presence of T4 polynucleotide kinase. Gel shift assays were carried out in 1× gel shift buffer containing the following components, as previously described (22Paull T.T. Cortez D. Bowers B. Elledge S.J. Gellert M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6086-6091Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar): 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 60 mm NaCl, 4 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.1% Triton X-100, and radiolabeled DNA probe (105 dpm) in a volume of 10–14 μl. Reactions were incubated at room temperature for 10 min before separation on 0.7% agarose gels in 0.5× TBE buffer at 5 V/cm for 2–4 h. The gels were dried onto 3MM Whatman paper and exposed to films and PhosphorImager for quantitation.Cell Lines and Tissue Culture—Human embryonic kidney 293 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum, penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml) as previously described (25Hua X. Nohturfft A. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Cell. 1996; 87: 415-426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). Menin-null and menincomplemented mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) were generated and maintained as previously described (18Jin S. Mao H. Schnepp R.W. Sykes S.M. Silva A.C. D'Andrea A.D. Hua X. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 4204-4210PubMed Google Scholar).Protein Expression and Purification—Exponentially growing DH5α E. coli cells harboring various GST-menin constructs were induced with 150 μm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at room temperature. The bacteria were collected and lysed at 4 °C in 1× phosphate-buffered saline with protease inhibitors and Triton-X-100 (1%), followed by sonication. The supernatant from the lysates was incubated with glutathione-Sepharose™ 4B beads (Amersham Biosciences) and the beads were washed extensively with 1× phosphate-buffered saline with protease inhibitors prior to elution with the elution buffer containing 10 mm glutathione. To express the full-length menin, with or without small deletions, the corresponding constructs were transformed in E. coli strain BL21(DE3) and the proteins were expressed as COOH-terminal His6-tagged proteins. Proteins were purified to homogeneity over a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose resin (Qiagen), followed by anion exchange chromatography (Source-15Q) and gel filtration (Superdex-200, Amersham Biosciences).Analysis of Apoptosis and Cell Cycle Using Fluorescence Activating Cell Scanning (FACS)—For propidium iodide/5′-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine 5′-triphosphate (BrdUrd) staining, on day 0, cells were seeded at a density of 2 × 105 cells/100-mm dish. On day 2, cells were pulsed for 45 min with 10 μm BrdUrd (Sigma). Following harvesting, 106 cells per sample were fixed in 70% ethanol while vortexing. Cell pellets were washed in washing buffer (phosphate-buffered saline plus 0.5% bovine serum albumin), pelleted, and denatured in denaturing solution (3 n HCl and 0.5% Tween 20) for 10 min. After pelleting, cells were then incubated with anti-BrdUrd antibody (BD Pharmingen) for 20 min, followed by washing and pelleting. Next, fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (BD Pharmingen) antibody was added for 15 min. After another washing and pelleting, cells were resuspended in 0.5 ml of propidium iodide (Sigma, 10 μg/ml in phosphate-buffered saline) and incubated for 30 min. Samples were analyzed on a FACS-Calibur (BD Pharmingen).For annexin V staining, cells were seeded at a density of 2 × 105 cells/100-mm dish on day 0. On day 2, cells and supernatant were collected and stained with annexin-V-fluorescein isothiocyanate, using the annexin V-Fluorescein Isothiocyanate Apoptosis Detection Kit (MBL, Inc., Woburn, MA). Duplicate samples were analyzed on a FAC-SCalibur (BD Biosciences).Western Blotting and Immunofluorescent Staining—Proteins from cell lysates or various cellular fractions were separated on SDS-PAGE gels, transferred to Hybond C+ membranes (Amersham Biosciences), and blotted with various primary antibodies, followed by incubation with appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. The blotted proteins were visualized using the enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (Amersham Biosciences). For immunofluorescent staining, cells were set up on coverslips and processed for incubation with the primary antibody (M2) and the fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.) as previously described (18Jin S. Mao H. Schnepp R.W. Sykes S.M. Silva A.C. D'Andrea A.D. Hua X. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 4204-4210PubMed Google Scholar) and the stained cells were photographed under a fluorescence microscope (Nikon).[3H]Thymidine Incorporation Assay—On day 0, cells in 2 ml of normal medium were seeded in each well of a 6-well plate. On day 4, [3H]thymidine (ICN Biomedicals Inc.) was added to the medium. [3H]Thymidine was first diluted in Opti-MEM (Invitrogen) and then was added to each well. Triplicate samples were incubated at 37 °C, 5% CO2 for 4 h before being trypsinized and harvested. Incorporation of [3H]thymidine into cells was determined using a model 1450 Microbeta Trillux Scintillation Counter (Wallac), as previously described (26La P. Morgan T. Sykes S. Mao H. Schnepp R. Petersen C. Hua X. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 198-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar).RESULTSMenin Binds Double-stranded DNA—Menin is primarily a nuclear protein that interacts with a variety of other DNA-binding proteins as well as chromatin (1Guru S.C. Goldsmith P.K. Burns A.L. Marx S.J. Spiegel A.M. Collins F.S. Chandrasekharappa S.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1630-1634Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar, 18Jin S. Mao H. Schnepp R.W. Sykes S.M. Silva A.C. D'Andrea A.D. Hua X. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 4204-4210PubMed Google Scholar). The tumor suppressor gene Brca1, which also represses cell proliferation (27Annab L.A. Hawkins R.E. Solomon G. Barrett J.C. Afshari C.A. Breast Cancer Res. 2000; 2: 139-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), binds DNA in a sequence-independent manner (22Paull T.T. Cortez D. Bowers B. Elledge S.J. Gellert M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6086-6091Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). However, it is unclear whether menin itself binds DNA, either in a sequence-specific or nonspecific manner. To examine whether menin binds DNA directly, we incubated full-length menin with either a radiolabeled single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) probe or a dsDNA probe, each of which is 65 base pairs (bp) in length. These probes were used to characterize the DNA binding by tumor suppressor Brca1 (22Paull T.T. Cortez D. Bowers B. Elledge S.J. Gellert M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6086-6091Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). To detect the potential menin-DNA interaction, the reaction was performed in the absence of nonspecific competitive DNA, and separated on agarose gels. Fig. 1A shows that neither of the single-stranded DNA probes binds to menin (lanes 2 and 4); however, the dsDNA probe is shifted by menin (lane 6). These results indicate that menin binds dsDNA. Consistent with this, an affinity-purified anti-menin antibody supershifts the menin-bound DNA probe (Fig. 1B, lane 3), although the control IgG fails to supershift menin-bound DNA (lane 6). Collectively, these experiments demonstrate that menin binds dsDNA. As a note, menin-DNA complexes were unable to migrate out from the wells of polyacrylamide gels (data not shown), 2A. Silva, unpublished data. which have small pore sizes, whereas they were able to do so in agarose gels, which have larger pores. This is similar to what was described for the DNA binding by another tumor suppressor gene, Brca1 (22Paull T.T. Cortez D. Bowers B. Elledge S.J. Gellert M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6086-6091Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Collectively, these results suggest that multiple molecules of menin may bind to a DNA probe.Menin Binds DNA in a Sequence-independent Manner— There are various DNA-binding proteins with functions ranging from the regulation of gene transcription to the regulation of DNA replication. For example, transcription factors usually bind to sequence-specific DNA (24Zawel L. Dai J.L. Buckhaults P. Zhou S. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Kern S.E. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 611-617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (887) Google Scholar). However, proteins involved in DNA replication or repair, including human replication origin binding proteins, Brca1 and Rad50, bind DNA in a sequence-nonspecific manner (22Paull T.T. Cortez D.

Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1894-1908Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). To determine whether menin binds DNA in a DNA sequence-specific or nonspecific fashion, we synthesized a pool of 65-mer oligonucleotides that harbor random nucleotide sequences in the middle region. The oligonucleotides were converted to dsDNA, and then used as a DNA probe for gel shift assays. Fig. 2 shows that menin binds to the DNA with random sequences (lanes 5–7). Notably, the ability of menin to bind to the random DNA is competed by poly(dI/dC), a homopolymer of dsDNA (lanes 9–14). These results indicate that menin not only binds to DNA in a nonsequence-specific fashion, but that the homopolymer of DNA competes with this non-sequence-specific binding, further suggesting that the DNA binding by menin is not sequence-specific in this condition. To further demonstrate that menin is indeed able to bind DNA in sequence-independent manner, we incubated full-length menin with linearized and radiolabeled Puc19, a plasmid of 2.6 kb (kilobases), and examined whether menin is also able to bind this long stretch of DNA. The results show that menin indeed shifts the plasmid DNA probe (data not shown).2Fig. 2Menin binds DNA in a sequence-independent manner. Increasing concentrations of full-length menin (0, 0.063, 0.125, 0.25, 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 μg per 10 μl) were incubated with the short dsDNA probe, and then subjected to gel shift assays (lanes 1–7). The binding to DNA by menin was competed with increasing concentrations of sequence-nonspecific poly(dI/dC) (lanes 9–14) in the gel shift assay.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)The COOH Terminus of Menin Mediates Binding to DNA— Because there are no motifs or domains in menin that suggest any obvious DNA binding activity, we sought to determine whether such a domain exists in menin. To this end, we generated constructs to express various GST-menin fusion proteins that span three various regions: the NH2 terminus, the middle region, and the carboxyl terminus of menin (Fig. 3A). The full-length menin and its various fragments were expressed and purified from E. coli, and their sizes and purity were determined on SDS-PAGE by Coomassie Blue staining (Fig. 3B). These various menin fusion proteins were incubated with a plasmid DNA probe for gel shift assays (Fig. 3C). As expected, full-length menin binds the probe DNA (Fig. 3C, lanes 2 and 3). The NH2 terminus does not appear to dramatically shift the DNA probe (lanes 4 and 5). The middle region of menin, spanning from amino acid residues 219 to 395, does not shift the DNA probe (Fig. 3C, lanes 6 and 7). Notably, even at the lowest concentration of the protein used the carboxyl terminus of menin shifts the DNA probe completely (Fig. 3C, lanes 8 and 9). These results demonstrate that the carboxyl terminus is the major domain in menin that mediates binding to DNA in a sequence-independent fashion.Fig. 3The carboxyl terminus of menin is responsible for binding to DNA. A, a diagram of menin and its fragments used in the experiment. B, a Coomassie Blue staining of menin and various GST-menin fragment fusion proteins (5 μg). The low band in lane 1 represents the form partially proteolyzed during purification. C, the carboxyl terminus of menin binds to DNA. Full-length menin, GST-F1, GST-F2, and GST-F3 (0.5 and 1.0 μg for each) were incubated with puc19 plasmid DNA probe for gel shift assays.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Menin Binds to Various DNA Structures—DNA structures encountered in DNA metabolism include regular dsDNA, Y-structures, branched structures, and 4-way junction structures, a 4-strand cross-structure analogous to Holiday structure (30Constantinou A.

Ageing Dev. 2001; 122: 921-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). BRAF35, a protein associating with the tumor suppressor Brca2, preferentially binds to 4-way structures (32Marmorstein L.Y.

Thus, we examined whether menin binds to these various DNA structures. Fig. 4A shows that the carboxyl terminus of menin containing amino acid residues 396–610 binds linearized dsDNA (lanes 3 and 4), Y-structures (lanes 6 and 7), branched structures (lanes 9 and 10), and 4-way structures (lanes 12 and 13). Similarly, full-length menin also binds these four DNA structures (data not shown). To further support the binding of menin to these various structures, a GST-menin (F3) fusion protein was incubated with the Y structure DNA probe and its binding to the probe was competed by each of the following 4 various DNA structures: linearized, Y-shaped, branched, and 4-way junction structures. Fig. 4B shows that each of the four structures competed with the DNA probe for binding to menin. However, at the lowest concentration of the competitor DNA used (36 nm), the 4-way structure DNA competed away ∼60% of the bound probe DNA, whereas the other three structures only competed away 20–25% of the bound DNA probe (Fig. 4B, lanes 4, 8, 12, and 16). Similar results were obtained when the full-length menin was used in the gel shift assays with various competitive DNA structures (data not shown). The stronger competition for binding to the probe by the 4-way structure may reflect the higher mass of the 4-way structure at an equal molar concentration, because the molecular weight for the 4-way structure is more than twice that of the Y structure probe (78,839 versus 30,540). Together, these results indicate that menin can bind to various DNA structures.Fig. 4Menin binds to dsDNA, Y-structures, branched structures, and 4-way junction structures. A, GST-menin (GST-F3, 0.0, 0.5, and 1.0 μg as indicated) binds to the four distinct DNA structures in the gel shift assay. B, GST-menin (GST-F3, 0.5 μg) was incubated with a Y-structure probe, in the presence of increasing concentrations (0, 0.036, 0.071, 0.143, and 0.286 μm) of each of the following DNA structures: dsDNA, Y-structures, branched structures, and 4-way structure for gel shift assays.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)MEN1-related Mutations in the COOH Terminus Compromise the Ability of Menin to Bind DNA as Well as Inhibit Cell Proliferation—Over 63% of mutations in the Men1 gene eventually lead to loss of the carboxyl terminus (33Pannett A.A.

Thus, we sought to determine whether a common disease-related mutation at the carboxyl terminus, R527X, and a second mutation, M558X, interfere with the ability of menin to bind to DNA. Both mutants retain the first nuclear localization signal (NLS1, 479–497), but lose NLS2-(588–608). The wild type COOH terminus of menin (GST-F3) and its two truncation mutants, 527X and 558X, were expressed and purified from E. coli (Fig. 5B). The purified menin and its mutants were incubated with a short dsDNA probe. Fig. 5C shows that, as expected, the wild type COOH terminus binds the probe (lanes 2 a"
https://openalex.org/W2053647613,"Quasars are the visible signatures of gas falling into the deep potential well of super-massive black holes in the centres of distant galaxies. It has been suggested1 that quasars are formed when two massive galaxies collide and merge, leading to the prediction that quasars should be found in the centres of regions of largest overdensity in the early Universe. In dark matter (DM)-dominated models of the early Universe, massive DM halos are predicted to attract the surrounding gas, which falls towards their centres. The neutral gas is not detectable in emission by itself, but gas falling into the ionizing cone of such a quasar will glow in the Lyman-α line of hydrogen, effectively imaging the DM halo2. Here we present a Lyα image of a DM halo at redshift z = 3, along with a two-dimensional spectrum of the gaseous halo. Our observations are best understood in the context of the standard model for DM haloes3; we infer a mass of (2 - 7) × 1012 solar masses (M⊙) for the halo."
https://openalex.org/W2047903604,"Glycolysis is important to cardiac metabolism and reduced glycolysis may contribute to diabetic cardiomyopathy. To understand its role independent of diabetes or hypoxic injury, we modulated glycolysis by cardiac-specific overexpression of kinase-deficient 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase (kd-PFK-2). PFK-2 controls the level of fructose 2,6-bisphosphate (Fru-2,6-P2), an important regulator of glycolysis. Transgenic mice had over 2-fold reduced levels of Fru-2,6-P2. Heart weight/body weight ratio indicated mild hypertrophy. Sirius red staining for collagen was significantly increased. We observed a 2-fold elevation in glucose 6-phosphate and fructose 6-phosphate levels, whereas fructose 1,6-bisphosphate was reduced 2-fold. Pathways branching off of glycolysis above phosphofructokinase were activated as indicated by over 2-fold elevated UDP-N-acetylglucosamine and glycogen. The kd-PFK-2 transgene significantly inhibited glycolysis in perfused hearts. Insulin stimulation of metabolism and Akt phosphorylation were sharply reduced. In addition, contractility of isolated cardiomyocytes was impaired during basal and hypoxic incubations. The present study shows that cardiac overexpression of kinase-deficient PFK-2 reduces cardiac glycolysis that produced negative consequences to the heart including hypertrophy, fibrosis, and reduced cardiomyocyte function. In addition, metabolic and signaling responses to insulin were significantly decreased. Glycolysis is important to cardiac metabolism and reduced glycolysis may contribute to diabetic cardiomyopathy.

In addition, metabolic and signaling responses to insulin were significantly decreased. An important role of glycolysis in heart failure has been appreciated for over 35 years because Bishop and Altrud (1Bishop S.P. Altschuld R.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1970; 218: 153-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar) reported that glycolytic metabolism is increased in cardiac hypertrophy and congestive heart failure. Glycolysis is also critical to cardiac survival in hypoxia (2Neely J.R. Rovetto M.J. Methods Enzymol. 1975; 39: 43-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), because glycolysis is the sole source of ATP production in the absence of oxygen. In diabetes there is a chronic reduction in cardiac glycolytic capacity (3Avogaro A. Nosadini R. Doria A. Fioretto P. Velussi M. Vigorito C. Sacca L. Toffolo G. Cobelli C. Trevisan R. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 258: E606-E618PubMed Google Scholar, 4Stanley W.C. Lopaschuk G.D. McCormack J.G. Cardiovasc. Res. 1997; 34: 25-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). Diabetics are prone to heart failure (5Rubler S. Dlugash J. Yuceoglu Y.Z. Kumral T. Branwood A.W. Grishman A. Am. J. Cardiol. 1972; 30: 595-602Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1371) Google Scholar) and they suffer more damage following an infarction (6Soler N.G. Pentecost B.L. Bennett M.A. FitzGerald M.G. Lamb P. Malins J.M. Lancet. 1974; 1: 475-477Abstract PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that reduced cardiac glycolysis contributes to the heart failure and cardiac damage often suffered by diabetics (7Belke D.D. Larsen T.S. Gibbs E.M. Severson D.L. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: E1104-E1113Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Abel E.D. Kaulbach H.C. Tian R. Hopkins J.C. Duffy J. Doetschman T. Minnemann T. Boers M.E. Hadro E. Oberste-Berghaus C. Quist W. Lowell B.B. Ingwall J.S. Kahn B.B. J. Clin. Investig. 1999; 104: 1703-1714Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). The significance of cardiac glycolysis has led to careful analysis of its regulation. Metabolic flux analysis (9Kashiwaya Y. Sato K. Tsuchiya N. Thomas S. Fell D.A. Veech R.L. Passonneau J.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25502-25514Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrates that control is shared by several reactions. One of the most critical reactions is carried out by 6-phosphofructo-1-kinase (PFK-1) 1The abbreviations used are: PKF-1, 6-phosphofructo-1-kinase; PFK-2, 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase; TES, N-tris[hydroxymethyl]methyl-2-aminoethanesulfonic acid; ANOVA, analysis of variance.

Cell Cardiol. 2002; 34: 1091-1097Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which catalyzes the phosphorylation of fructose 6-phosphate (Fru-6-P) to fructose 1,6-bisphosphate (Fru-1,6-P2). Fru-6-P is in equilibrium with glucose 6-phosphate (Glc-6-P) and these two sugars initiate glycogen synthesis, the hexosamine pathway, and the hexose monophosphate shunt. Thus PFK-1 not only has an important role in regulating glycolysis but by controlling the metabolism of Fru-6-P, PFK-1 can also modulate several important reactions branching off of glycolysis. PFK-1 activity is tightly controlled and the most important positive regulator is fructose 2,6-bisphosphate (Fru-2,6-P2). Until recently the sole function of Fru-2,6-P2 was thought to be regulation of PFK-1. However, Wu et al. (12Wu C. Okar D.A. Stoeckman A.K. Peng L.J. Herrera A.H. Herrera J.E. Towle H.C. Lange A.J. Endocrinology. 2004; 145: 650-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) has recently provided evidence that liver Fru-2,6-P2 may directly or indirectly modulate gene expression and insulin signaling. The bifunctional enzyme 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase (PFK-2) catalyzes the synthesis and degradation of Fru-2,6-P2. PFK-2 is in turn regulated by a complex network of kinases, phosphatases, and metabolites (13Okar D.A. Manzano A. Navarro-Sabate A. Riera L. Bartrons R. Lange A.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 30-35Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). In this study we have used a cardiac-specific transgene for a mutant form of PFK-2 to directly reduce cardiac Fru-2,6-P2 and cardiac glycolysis. Our results demonstrate that impaired glycolysis produces several indicators of cardiac pathology, which are reminiscent of the cardiomyopathy seen in diabetes. In addition, reduced Fru-2,6-P2 produces a state of cardiac insulin resistance. The bifunctional enzyme PFK-2 controls levels of Fru-2,6-P2 by catalyzing two opposing reactions: Fru-6-P + ATP → Fru-2,6-P2 + ADP and Fru-2,6-P2 → Fru-6-P + Pi. Development and in vivo analysis of the kinase-deficient PFK-2 (kd-PFK-2) mutant has been previously described (12Wu C. Okar D.A. Stoeckman A.K. Peng L.J. Herrera A.H. Herrera J.E. Towle H.C.

Cardiac-specific expression was obtained by ligating a 1.6-kb KpnI/HindIII fragment of kd-PFK-2 (12Wu C. Okar D.A. Stoeckman A.K. Peng L.J. Herrera A.H. Herrera J.E. Towle H.C. Lange A.J.

Chem. 1991; 266: 9180-9185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The transgene was designated Mb (for the myosin heavy chain promoter and the bisphosphatase active kd-PFK-2 gene). Transgenic mice were produced on the FVB background and maintained as heterozygotes by breeding to FVB mice. Standard embryo microinjection procedures were used for producing transgenic animals. All procedures conformed to the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (46National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD1996Google Scholar) and were approved by the USDA certified institutional animal care committee. Mice aged 90-120 days were used in the following studies. Cardiac Fru-2,6-P2 Content—Fru-2,6-P2 was extracted from fresh heart tissue in 10-20 volumes of 50 mm NaOH and kept at 80 °C for 5 min. The extract was cooled and neutralized at 0 °C by addition of ice-cold 1 m acetic acid in the presence of 20 mm HEPES. After centrifugation at 8,000 × g for 10 min, supernatant was collected and assayed for Fru-2,6-P2 by the 6-phosphofructo-1-kinase activation method (17Van Schaftingen E. Lederer B. Bartrons R. Hers H.G. Eur.J. Biochem. 1982; 129: 191-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar). Northern Blots—Expression and tissue specificity of the transgene were determined by measuring RNA. RNA for Northern blots was prepared with RNAzol as we have previously described from heart, liver, lung, kidney, skeletal muscle, and brain of transgenic and normal mice (18Liang Q. Donthi R.V. Kralik P.M. Epstein P.N. Cardiovasc. Res. 2002; 53: 423-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). A 1.7-kb HindIII/SalI fragment of the transgene was labeled with 32P by random oligonucleotide priming and used as probe. This probe had little detectable cross-reactivity with any other mouse messenger RNA. PFK-2 Expression Analysis—PFK-2 protein was analyzed by Western blot as reported earlier (19Wu C. Okar D.A. Newgard C.B. Lange A.J. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 107: 91-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). In brief, PFK-2 was extracted from fresh hearts by homogenizing in buffer containing 20 mm TES, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 100 mm KCl, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA (pH 7.8), 1.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2.5 mg/liter leupeptin. After precipitation with 40% PEG, the pellet was dissolved in buffer containing 20 mm TES, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 100 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA (pH 7.5), 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2.5 mg/liter leupeptin. The concentration of extracted protein was measured by the BCA method (Pierce Chemical Co.). Equal amounts of extracted protein (100 μg) were used for Western blots. Rabbit anti-rat liver PFK-2 serum was used as primary antibody at a 1:1,000 dilution. The bands were visualized using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody and ECL (Amersham Biosciences). Hearts were homogenized in 1 m ice-cold perchloric acid and centrifuged. The supernatants were neutralized with 2 m KHCO3. The supernatant from neutralized tissue extracts was used for estimation of glucose 6-phosphate, fructose 6-phosphate, and fructose 1,6-bisphosphate by the fluorometric method (20Lowry O.H. Passonneau J.V. A Flexible System of Enzymatic Analysis. Academic Press, New York1993: 111-228Google Scholar). The hearts were quickly removed, blotted dry, and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen. The frozen tissue was weighed, homogenized in 9 volumes of 30% KOH at 0 °C, and then heated at 70 °C for 30 min. The glycogen was precipitated with absolute alcohol and saturated sodium sulfate and redissolved in 0.1 m acetate buffer (pH 4.7). Then 10 μl of homogenate glycogen was hydrolyzed to glucose by the addition of 50 ng of amyloglucosidase (Roche Applied Science) in 100 μlof0.1 m acetate buffer. Glucose was then measured by fluorometric assay using hexokinase and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase as we reported earlier (18Liang Q. Donthi R.V. Kralik P.M. Epstein P.N. Cardiovasc. Res. 2002; 53: 423-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Levels of UDP-N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc) were measured as described previously (21Veerababu G. Tang J. Hoffman R.T. Daniels M.C. Hebert Jr., L.F. Crook E.D. Cooksey R.C. McClain D.A. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 2070-2078Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Hearts from control and transgenic mice was homogenized at 4 °C in 4 volumes of 300 mm perchloric acid and centrifuged (10,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C). Acid was extracted from the supernatants with 2 volumes of tri-n-octylamine:1,1,2-trichlorofluoroethane (1:4). The aqueous phase was filtered (0.45 μm) and high-performance liquid chromatography was performed on a Spherisorb amino column (25 cm × 4.6 mm, Phase Separations) eluted with a concave gradient from 80 mm potassium phosphate (pH 2.8), 35% acetonitrile, to 800 mm potassium phosphate (pH 3.6) over 48 min at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. UDP-GlcNAc levels were quantified by ultraviolet absorption at 254 nm, compared with external standards, and normalized to protein content. Langendorff perfusions were carried out as previously described by us (18Liang Q. Donthi R.V. Kralik P.M. Epstein P.N. Cardiovasc. Res. 2002; 53: 423-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 22Liang Q. Carlson E.C. Donthi R.V. Kralik P.M. Shen X. Epstein P.N. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 174-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 23.Deleted in proofGoogle Scholar). The heart was removed from the chest and the aorta was canulated to the perfusion apparatus. The heart was retrogradely perfused at 2 ml/min with Krebs-Henseleit buffer consisting of 120 mm NaCl, 20 mm NaHCO3, 4.6 mm KCl, 1.2 mm KH2PO4, 1.2 mm MgCl2, 1.25 mm CaCl2, 5 mm glucose. Throughout the perfusion Krebs-Henseleit buffer was continuously equilibrated with 95% O2, 5% CO2 that maintained a pH of 7.4 and temperature was maintained at 37 °C. The heart was paced throughout the procedure at 6 Hz (6 V, 3 ms). For studies on the effect of insulin, baseline glycolysis was determined for the first 30 min followed by 50 min in the presence of 200 microunits/ml of insulin. Perfusion rate was maintained at 2 ml/min. Perfusion pressure and contractility was monitored continuously during the perfusion, as described previously (18Liang Q. Donthi R.V. Kralik P.M. Epstein P.N. Cardiovasc. Res. 2002; 53: 423-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 22Liang Q. Carlson E.C. Donthi R.V. Kralik P.M. Shen X. Epstein P.N. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 174-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Glycolysis was measured using [5-3H]glucose as the substrate as we have previously reported (22Liang Q. Carlson E.C. Donthi R.V. Kralik P.M. Shen X. Epstein P.N. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 174-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Lactate produced was measured as we have described (18Liang Q. Donthi R.V. Kralik P.M. Epstein P.N. Cardiovasc. Res. 2002; 53: 423-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Tritiated water produced from [5-3H]glucose during perfusion was determined by diffusion. A 400-μl sample of cardiac effluent and 25 μl of 0.6 n HCl were added to 1.5-ml tubes that were placed inside 20-ml scintillation vials containing 2 ml of water. Vials were incubated for 72 h at 37 °C. The inside tube was removed and scintillate was added for counting. Effluent from each time point was assayed in duplicate. For each experiment, background counts were determined by performing the same equilibration on perfusion buffer that had not passed through the heart. Diffusion efficiency was also measured in each experiment using tritiated water. Lactate concentration was measured in 6-fold diluted effluent using Sigma kit 826-B (18Liang Q. Donthi R.V. Kralik P.M. Epstein P.N. Cardiovasc. Res. 2002; 53: 423-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Collagen accumulation in the heart sections was determined as described previously (24Angyalosi G. Neveu R. Wolowczuk I. Delanoye A. Herno J. Auriault C. Pancre V. Infect. Immunol. 2001; 69: 5874-5882Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). 5-μm heart sections were placed on slides, deparaffinized, and incubated with a saturated solution of picric acid containing 0.1% Sirius red for staining collagen and 0.1% Fast Green, which stains noncollagen proteins. Sections were kept in the dark and incubated for 30 min. They were then rinsed with distilled water, dehydrated, and mounted with permount. The sections were visualized, photographed, and the interstitial fibrosis was quantified by a blind observer using a scale of 0-2 based on the severity of the collagen accumulation. The section was given a score of 0 for mild accumulation, 1 for moderate accumulation, and 2 for severe accumulation. Cardiomyocytes were isolated and myocyte contractility was measured as we have described (25Ye G. Metreveli N.S. Ren J. Epstein P.N. Diabetes. 2003; 52: 777-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). For the oxygenated assay, myocytes were placed in an open chamber in HEPES-buffered Krebs buffer for 2 h. For hypoxia, cardiomyocytes were perfused with N2-saturated Krebs buffer for 15 min and maintained and assayed in a sealed chamber for 2 h. Myocytes were stimulated at 1 Hz using platinum electrodes attached to the chamber. Mechanical properties of ventricular myocytes were assessed using a video-based edge-detection system (IonOptix, Milton, MA) according to the previous description (25Ye G. Metreveli N.S. Ren J. Epstein P.N. Diabetes. 2003; 52: 777-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Cell shortening and relengthening were assessed using the following indexes: peak shortening, time to 90% relengthening (TR90), and maximal velocities of shortening and relengthening (±dL/dt). Hearts were frozen in liquid nitrogen after the basal period or following the period of insulin perfusion. Tissue extracts were prepared in lysis buffer containing 20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The lysates were centrifuged and protein concentration of the supernatants was measured by the BCA method (Pierce). Proteins equivalent to 20 μg were analyzed by Western blot as explained previously (26Donthi R.V. Huisamen B. Lochner A. Cardiovasc. Drugs Ther. 2000; 14: 463-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 27Huisamen B. Donthi R.V. Lochner A. Cardiovasc. Drugs Ther. 2001; 15: 445-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). In brief, protein samples were separated on 4-20% gradient SDS-PAGE gels and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membrane was blocked with 5% nonfat milk and incubated overnight with phospho-Akt (Ser-473) antibody or Akt antibody from Cell Signaling. The membranes were washed and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody and bands were visualized using ECL (Amersham Biosciences). Comparisons of repeated measurements were performed by two-way ANOVA for repeated measures and Tukey's post-hoc test. Single comparisons were performed by Student's t test. The accepted level of significance was 0.05. Transgenic Lines—A transgene, designated Mb was constructed for cardiac expression of a kinase-deficient mutant of PFK-2 (kd-PFK-2). Eight transgenic lines were produced and these were designated as lines Mb 1-8. Founders of lines 1, 4, 5, and 6-8 produced litters. The Northern blot shown in Fig. 1A demonstrated that the transgene product was produced primarily in the heart and was absent in nontransgenic FVB mice. Overexpression of kd-PFK-2 protein was confirmed by Western blot with PFK-2 specific antibody (Fig. 1B). Preliminary assays (not shown) indicated that transgenic lines Mb1, -4, -6, and -7 had levels of Fru-2,6-P2, which were similar to one another and substantially lower than that of non-transgenic control mice. Lines Mb1 and Mb7 were expanded most rapidly and were used as subjects for subsequent assays. Hearts from Mb1 and Mb7 mice had only 40% as much Fru-2,6-P2 as measured in control FVB hearts (Fig. 2). Because line Mb7 appeared to have higher kd-PFK-2 protein expression, it was used for all subsequent studies.Fig. 2Fru-2,6-P2 is reduced in transgenic heart.Asterisk (*) indicates that the values of Mb1 and Mb7 are significantly different from FVB (p < 0.001). The number of animals used are: FVB, 8; Mb1, 3; and Mb7, 4.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Metabolite Concentration—Decreased Fru-2,6-P2 would be expected to reduce PFK activity and have a significant impact on concentrations of cardiac metabolites. Levels of several relevant metabolites were measured in freeze-clamped hearts of FVB and Mb7 transgenic mice maintained in free fed conditions. These results are shown in Table I. Glc-6-P and Fru-6-P levels were elevated more than 2-fold, whereas the fructose 1,6-bisphosphate level was 2-fold lower in transgenic mice. Coincident with the elevation in the Glc-6-P levels, we observed that glycogen was increased by more than 2-fold in the Mb7 transgenic mice. The principal end product of the hexosamine pathway is UDP-GlcNAc. As shown in Table I, we found a 2-fold elevation in UDP-GlcNAc levels. This corresponds to the increased accumulation of Fru-6-P, which may drive the hexosamine pathway.Table IConcentrations of glycolytic metabolites in FVB and Mb7 hearts The values shown are means ± S.E. for at least 4 mice in each group. The levels of glucose 6-phosphate, fructose 6-phosphate, glycogen, and UDP-GlcNAc were significantly elevated while fructose 1,6-bisphosphate and fructose 2,6-bisphosphate were significantly lower in Mb7 hearts.Glucose 6-phosphateFructose 6-phosphateFructose 2,6-bisphosphateFructose 1,6-bisphosphateGlycogenUDP-GlcNAcnmol/gnmol/gnmol/gnmol/gμmol/gnmol/μg proteinFVB148.7 ± 17.032.6 ± 6.03.41 ± 0.24498.5 ± 62.618.6 ± 4.190.98 ± 0.05Mb7293.8 ± 45.2ap < 0.0597.9 ± 14.4bp < 0.011.39 ± 0.12cp < 0.001261.8 ± 62.6ap < 0.0550.2 ± 9.23ap < 0.051.96 ± 0.02cp < 0.001a p < 0.05b p < 0.01c p < 0.001 Open table in a new tab Effect of Kd-PFK-2 on Cardiac Glucose Metabolism and Insulin Response—The effect of the Mb transgene on cardiac glycolysis was assessed in Langendorff-perfused hearts by measuring consumption of 5-tritiated glucose and production of lactate. 3H2O is released from the metabolism of [5-3H]glucose by triose-phosphate isomerase and enolase steps of the glycolytic pathway (28Barr R.L. Lopaschuk G.D. J. Pharmacol. Toxicol. Methods. 2000; 43: 141-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 29.Deleted in proofGoogle Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3 both 3H2O metabolized from [5-3H]glucose and lactate release were significantly reduced in Mb7 transgenic hearts. Perfusion pressure was constant at 65 mm Hg and throughout the experiment flow was stable and equal in Mb7 and FVB hearts. We saw a reduction in contractility in the Mb7 mice hearts of about 20% (data not shown) but this difference did not reach significance despite evaluation in more than 10 mice per group. After addition of insulin to the perfusate the difference in metabolism between transgenic and control hearts became even greater, because of a clearly diminished response to insulin in transgenic hearts (Fig. 3, C and D). At the end of the 50-min perfusion with insulin, 5-tritiated glucose consumption was increased by 70% in FVB hearts but only by 34% in transgenic hearts (Fig. 3C). Similarly, lactate output was stimulated by 90% in FVB hearts but only by 25% in Mb7 hearts (Fig. 3D). The differences in insulin response were significant (p < 0.02). To determine whether the decline in insulin action extended beyond glucose metabolism, we measured insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of Akt. Hearts were perfused with or without insulin, extracted, and protein was analyzed by Western blotting. The results are shown in Fig. 4. In the absence of insulin there was no significant difference in the expression levels of Akt nor any difference seen in the phosphorylated form of Akt. Following insulin perfusion serine 473 phosphorylation of Akt was increased by 230 ± 54% in FVB hearts but only by 63 ± 18% in Mb7 transgenic hearts. Two-way ANOVA indicated that the insulin-stimulated increase was significant for FVB (p < 0.01) but did not reach significance for Mb7 hearts (p = 0.14). These results demonstrated that the kd-PFK-2 protein reduced insulin action in pathways other than glucose metabolism. Pathology in Transgenic Hearts—The hearts of Mb7 mice of both sexes showed a small but significant increase in heart weight of ∼10% as shown in Table II. However, body weights were not different from control FVB mice. The heart weight/body weight ratio was significantly increased in both male and female Mb7 mice. The increased heart weight was accompanied by a significant increase in cardiac fibrosis in Mb7 mice as shown in Fig. 5.Table IIHeart and body weight of Mb7 and FVB mice The values shown are mean ± S.E.

Myocyte contractility was measured and the results are shown in Fig. 6. Mb7 myocytes showed significantly reduced contractility compared with FVB control myocytes as assessed by +dl/dt, -dl/dt, and % peak shortening both under normoxic and hypoxic conditions. In addition, Mb7 myocytes required more time to relengthen (TR90) than FVB myocytes. Changes in glucose metabolism accompany cardiac hypertrophy but it is not known if this change in metabolism is an adaptive or maladaptive response. To examine directly the role of glucose metabolism in long term cardiac function we developed transgenic mice with reduced cardiac glycolysis. Multiple lines of mice were produced with the cardiac-specific, kinase-deficient PFK-2 transgene Mb, which markedly reduced cardiac levels of Fru-2,6-P2, a potent regulator of PFK-1. This resulted in significant changes in cardiac function, some of which were expected and others unexpected. As anticipated, glycolysis was reduced and anticipated changes occurred in the concentration of glycolytic intermediates and metabolites of pathways that branch off from glycolysis. The transgene produced cardiac pathology as demonstrated by increased cardiac weight, increased fibrosis, and decreased cardiomyocyte contractility. Unexpectedly the transgene markedly decreased cardiac sensitivity to insulin. Cardiac metabolites and pathways upstream of PFK-1 were up-regulated in transgenic hearts because of inhibition of PFK-1. The concentrations of Glc-6-P and Fru-6-P were increased 2- and 3-fold, respectively. Glc-6-P is the first substrate for glycogen production and Glc-6-P stimulates glycogen synthase (30Nielsen J.N. Richter E.A. Acta Physiol. Scand. 2003; 178: 309-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). These combined effects resulted in almost a 3-fold increase in glycogen content of transgenic hearts. Fru-6-P is the first substrate of the hexosamine pathway and the end product of this pathway, UDP-GlcNAc, was increased 2-fold. These changes in side pathway products were probably not a result of nonspecific effects of the transgene nor to the overall reduction in the glycolytic flux induced by the Mb transgene. We say that because we previously observed similar increases in cardiac glycogen content when we overexpressed yeast hexokinase in the heart (18Liang Q. Donthi R.V. Kralik P.M. Epstein P.N. Cardiovasc. Res. 2002; 53: 423-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Hexokinase, like the kd-PFK-2 protein, also produced a 2-fold increase in UDP-GlcNAc levels. 2R. V. Donthi, D. A. McClain, and P. N. Epstein, unpublished results. The hexokinase transgene had the opposite effect on glycolysis as the Mb transgene, hexokinase increased glycolysis (18Liang Q. Donthi R.V. Kralik P.M. Epstein P.N. Cardiovasc. Res. 2002; 53: 423-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). However, hexokinase increases Glc-6-P production and the kd-PFK-2 protein increased Glc-6-P levels. These results show that important pathways that branch from glycolysis are more directly affected by changes in the concentration of glycolytic intermediates than they are by changes in glycolytic flux. Diabetes is the major clinical condition in which there is a chronic inhibition of cardiac glycolysis (4Stanley W.C. Lopaschuk G.D. McCormack J.G. Cardiovasc. Res. 1997; 34: 25-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). In diabetes glycolysis is reduced because insulin stimulates many steps in the pathway of glucose metabolism including glucose transport, hexokinase, PFK, and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. Our transgenic mice also had a permanent reduction in glycolysis and they exhibited most of the characteristics of diabetic cardiomyopathy. Mild hypertrophy (31Galderisi M. Anderson K.M. Wilson P.W. Levy D. Am. J. Cardiol. 1991; 68: 85-89Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar) and increased fibrosis (32Khaidar A. Marx M. Lubec B. Lubec G. Circulation. 1994; 90: 479-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) are common findings in diabetic hearts. These were seen in our transgenic mice as a 6 or 15% increase in heart to body weight in males and females, respectively. Fibrosis was evident as clearly increased Sirius red staining. These affects were not simply a function of cardiac overexpression of a transgene, because we have not seen these pathologies with any of the other cardiac-specific transgenes we have described (18Liang Q. Donthi R.V. Kralik P.M. Epstein P.N. Cardiovasc. Res. 2002; 53: 423-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 22Liang Q. Carlson E.C. Donthi R.V. Kralik P.M. Shen X. Epstein P.N.

Similar hypertrophy has been reported for cardiac selective deletion of GLUT4, which also reduced glycolysis (8Abel E.D. Kaulbach H.C. Tian R. Hopkins J.C. Duffy J. Doetschman T. Minnemann T. Boers M.E. Hadro E. Oberste-Berghaus C. Quist W. Lowell B.B. Ingwall J.S. Kahn B.B. J. Clin. Investig. 1999; 104: 1703-1714Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). In addition to altered morphology, diabetic hearts (31Galderisi M. Anderson K.M. Wilson P.W. Levy D. Am. J. Cardiol. 1991; 68: 85-89Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar) and cardiomyocytes from diabetic animals (22Liang Q. Carlson E.C. Donthi R.V. Kralik P.M. Shen X. Epstein P.N. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 174-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) display reduced contractility and greater sensitivity to hypoxia. Cardiomyocytes from transgenic Mb7 mice showed clearly reduced contractility and the degree of impairment was similar to what we have observed in Type I and Type 2 diabetic models (36Ye G. Metreveli N. Donthi R.V. Shen X. Carlson E.C. Epstein P.N. Diabetes. 2004; 55: 1336-1343Crossref Scopus (223) Google Scholar). In addition to reduced contractility, transgenic myocytes exhibited delayed relaxation, an essential characteristic of diabetic hearts (37Shehadeh A. Regan T.J. Clin. Cardiol. 1995; 18: 301-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) and cardiomyocytes (38Ren J. Davidoff A.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: H148-H158PubMed Google Scholar). Diabetic hearts are also more sensitive to ischemia (39Stone P.H. Muller J.E. Hartwell T. York B.J. Rutherford J.D. Parker C.B. Turi Z.G. Strauss H.W. Willerson J.T. Robertson T. J. Am. Coll. Cardiol. 1989; 14: 49-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). Impaired glycolysis contributes to this sensitivity because glycolysis is the only remaining source of ATP production in a hypoxic environment. We found that Mb7 myocytes had reduced function during hypoxia compared with FVB myocytes. However, because their function was already reduced before hypoxia it is not clear if this indicates a true increase in hypoxic sensitivity. These results indicate that merely by reducing glycolysis, even without hyperglycemia, we can produce a model with all or most of the characteristics of diabetic cardiomyopathy. This is consistent with the findings of Belke et al. (40Belke D.D. Larsen T.S. Gibbs E.M. Severson D.L. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: E420-E427Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that overexpression of GLUT4 can protect from diabetic cardiomyopathy. All of these reports suggest that impaired glycolysis contributes to the cardiac pathology common in diabetics. Insulin resistance was an unexpected but an obvious effect of expression of the kd-PFK-2 protein. Resistance was apparent as a 50-80% reduction in glycolytic response to insulin. It was also seen in a marked reduction in phosphorylation of Akt produced by insulin stimulation. Fru-2,6-P2 has not been shown to have a direct effect on cardiac insulin signaling, perhaps because Fru-2,6-P2 has not been directly altered before. However, Wu et al. (12Wu C. Okar D.A. Stoeckman A.K. Peng L.J. Herrera A.H. Herrera J.E. Towle H.C. Lange A.J. Endocrinology. 2004; 145: 650-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) has recently shown that manipulation of liver Fru-2,6-P2 content produces corresponding changes in the level of phosphorylated Akt. Because Akt phosphorylation is a prerequisite to the metabolic actions of insulin this may explain the resistance to insulin for glycolysis. The primary cause of insulin resistance and reduced Akt phosphorylation is not clear. One demonstrated mechanism is increased hexosamine flux (41Hawkins M. Angelov I. Liu R. Barzilai N. Rossetti L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4889-4895Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 42McClain D.A. Crook E.D. Diabetes. 1996; 45: 1003-1009Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which was indicated in this model by the 2-fold increase in levels of UDP-GlcNAc. Hexosamines are currently believed to exert their effects by increasing the levels of enzymatic O-linked glycosylation of cytosolic and nuclear proteins by N-acetylgucosamine (43Vosseller K. Wells L. Lane M.D. Hart G.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5313-5318Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar, 44McClain D.A. Lubas W.A. Cooksey R.C. Hazel M. Parker G.J. Love D.C. Hanover J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 10695-10699Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 45Clark R.J. McDonough P.M. Swanson E. Trost S.U. Suzuki M. Fukuda M. Dillmann W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 44230-44237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). For example, it has been recently demonstrated that elevated glycosylation by O-linked GlcNAc can inhibit insulin-dependent activation of Akt (43Vosseller K. Wells L. Lane M.D. Hart G.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5313-5318Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). Thus one possible explanation for insulin resistance in Mb7 hearts stems from the backup of glycolysis at PFK-1, leading to increased flux through the hexosamine pathway. Other direct or indirect effects of Fru-2,6-P2 may contribute to the loss of insulin sensitivity. In conclusion, we have shown in the present study that decreasing cardiac Fru-2,6-P2 content produces significant changes in cardiac metabolism and pathology. In perfused hearts glycolysis and insulin sensitivity were decreased. In vivo transgenic hearts showed an elevation of glycolytic substrates upstream of PFK-1, which led to elevation of glycogen and UDP-GlcNAc. The elevation in UDP-GlcNAc may have contributed to the development of insulin resistance. Also we found that reduced glycolysis was accompanied by mild hypertrophy and accumulation of collagen. In combination with impaired cardiomyocyte contractility these results indicate that a deficit in glycolysis is an important component of diabetic cardiomyopathy."

Diffusely adherent E. coli shares a characteristic pattern of infection of epithelial cells in which the bacteria form a diffuse pattern around the host cells and is accompanied by an elongation of the microvilli (4Yamamoto T.

Although originally thought to be afimbrial, the Afa/Dr adhesins have been shown to form extended fimbrial structures on the surface of bacteria (5Bilge S.S. Clausen C.R. Lau W. Moseley S.L. J.

They mediate location of bacteria to the gut or urinary tract via adhesion to the mammalian complement regulatory protein, the decay accelerating factor (DAF 1The abbreviations used are: DAF, decay accelerating factor; Cm, chloramphenicol. or CD55). DAF is a 70-kDa protein found on the apical surface of host epithelial cells and attaches to the cell surface via a glycophosphotidylinositol anchor (13Medof M.E. Kinoshita T. Nussenzweig V. J. Exp.

The Afa/Dr adhesins have also been shown to bind to members of the carcinoembryonic antigen family, although the significance of this is yet to be determined (16Guignot J. Peiffer I.

Two of the Afa/Dr adhesins, AfaE-III and DraE, differ in sequence by only three amino acids but possess significantly different properties.

Briefly, adhesin subunits are found to consist of an immunoglobulin-like fold that misses a central antiparallel β-strand and also possess an N-terminal extension.

CD55 was purified and refolded from E. coli also as described previously (31Lukacik P. Roversi P. White J. Esser D. Smith G.P. Billington J. Williams P. Rudd P.M. Wormald M.R. Crispin M.D.M.

AfaE-dsc, DraE-dsc, and the mutants of the two were expressed from pRSETA plasmid in BL21(DE3) cells. They were purified via an N-terminal hexahistidine tag using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid superflow resin (Qiagen) as described previously for AfaE-dsc (11Anderson K.L. Billington J. Pettigrew D.

Chloramphenicol Sensitivity Assayed Using Surface Plasmon Resonance—Native AfaE-III and DraE were covalently coupled to the carboxylated dextran matrix on the surface on an activated CM5 sensor chip using the primary amine coupling kit (BIAcore AB). After activation according to the standard protocol, 0.5 mg/ml of DraE or AfaE-III in 10 mm sodium acetate (pH 4.5) was injected. Differing levels were immobilized (∼8,000 resonance units of AfaE-III and ∼3,500 of DraE) by varying the volume of protein injected. All interaction sensorgrams were collected at 20 °C by flowing 80 μl (at 20 μl/min) of a CD55/chloramphenicol (Cm) mixture where the CD55 concentration was 1 μm, and the Cm concentration varied between 0 and 3.8 mm. Measurements were taken as triplets where the first injection was of CD55 with no Cm added, the second contained Cm at the specified concentration, and the third contained Cm only. The maximum response obtained was corrected for bulk effects (using data from a mock coupled channel where no AfaE-III or DraE were coupled) and nonspecific chloramphenicol binding (using the signal from the Cm-only injections). Data were plotted by taking the maximum response obtained with and without Cm and reporting the signal as a percentage of that obtained without drug. Data presented are the mean and standard deviations of three independent repeats. Crystallization and Structure Determination—Crystals of AfaE-III and DraE were grown at 21 °C using sitting drop vapor diffusion. AfaE-III was concentrated to 3.5 mg/ml, whereas DraE was concentrated to 1.5 mg/ml. AfaE-III-Se-Met crystals (I432) grew against a reservoir solution containing 2 m ammonium sulfate, 2% polyethylene glycol 400, and 0.1 m sodium HEPES (pH 6.8–7.0). Native AfaE-III crystals (P3121) grew against a reservoir of 0.2 m magnesium sulfate, 20–21% polyethylene glycol 4000, and 0.1 m Tris-HCl (pH 7.8). DraE crystals (P212121) were obtained against a reservoir solution of 2 m ammonium sulfate, 0.1 m Tris-HCl (pH 7). Co-crystals of the DraE-Cm complex (P3) grew against a reservoir of 1.7 m ammonium sulfate, 100 μm Cm (as reported in biological assays (22Carnoy C. Moseley S.L. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 23: 365-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar)) or 2.8 mm Cm and 0.1 m NaHEPES (pH 7). All crystals were flash frozen in nitrogen gas, and data were collected at 100 K with crystals in a fiber loop. Data were collected in-house, at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (BM-14), Grenoble, France, and at the Synchrotron Radiation Source (stations 9.6 and 14.2), Daresbury, United Kingdom. The AfaE-III-Se-Met structure (Protein Data Bank accession number 1USZ) was solved at 3.1 Å by single-wavelength anomalous dispersion with the suite of programs autoSHARP (32Bricogne G. Vonrhein C. Flensburg C. Schiltz M. Paciorek W. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2003; 59: 2023-2031Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar) and built and refined (as all the other structures in this paper) with the program Xtalview (33McRee D.E. J. Struct.

Crystallogr. 2004; 60 (in press)Crossref Scopus (604) Google Scholar). The Se-Met model was used to solve the AfaE-III native crystal structure by molecular replacement with the program Molrep (34Vagin A. Teplyakov A. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1997; 30: 1022-1025Crossref Scopus (4175) Google Scholar) (3.3 Å resolution, Protein Data Bank accession number 1UT2). The native DraE structure (1.7 Å resolution, Protein Data Bank accession number 1UT1) was also solved with Molrep using Protein Data Bank accession number 1USZ as a search model. Finally, the DraE-Cm complex (1.9 Å resolution, Protein Data Bank accession number 1USQ) was again solved by molecular replacement with Molrep using the coordinates of the native DraE as the search model. For the DraE-Cm complex, rebuilding and refinement proceeded with the simple addition of water and remodeling of protein side chains until no difference density could be identified in the Fo – Fc map other than that associated with the Cm, at which point the model for the Cm molecule was built. Chemical Shift Mapping—15N-labeled NMR samples of AfaE-dsc, DraE-dsc, and mutants were prepared to a final concentration of 1 mm and a volume of 500 μl in 50 mm acetate buffer (pH 5.0), 100 mm sodium chloride, and 10% D2O. Samples were quantified using UV absorbance at 280 nm wavelength. Chloramphenicol was prepared up to a concentration of 7 mm in the same buffer as the protein and solubilized by mild heating. Chloramphenicol was added to each sample in increments described in the text. All experiments were carried out on a 500 MHz four-channel Bruker DRX500 spectrometer equipped with a z-shielded gradient triple resonance cryoprobe. Coordinates and Figure Preparation—Coordinates and x-ray crystallographic data for the structures have been deposited at the Protein Data bank under the accession codes 1USQ, 1USZ, 1UT1 and 1UT2. Figures were prepared using program AESOP. 2M. Noble, personal communication. X-ray Structures for Oligomeric Forms of AfaE-III and DraE—Whereas earlier structural work (11Anderson K.L. Billington J. Pettigrew D. Cota E. Simpson P. Roversi P. Chen H.A. Urvil P. du Merle L. Barlow P.N. Medof M.E. Smith R.A.G. Nowicki B. Le Bouguénec C. Lea S.M. Matthews S. Mol.

These oligomers have been extensively studied (e.g. Refs. 12Jouve M. Garcia M.I. Courcoux P. Labigne A. Gounon P. Le Bouguenec C. Infect. Immun. 1997; 65: 4082-4089Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 35Garcia M.I. Gounon P. Courcoux P. Labigne A. Le Bouguenec C. Mol.

Therefore we sought to determine the structures of these oligomeric forms to facilitate comparisons with the structure of AfaE-dsc and interpretation of existing biological data. Size exclusion chromatography (11Anderson K.L. Billington J. Pettigrew D. Cota E. Simpson P. Roversi P. Chen H.A. Urvil P. du Merle L. Barlow P.N. Medof M.E. Smith R.A.G. Nowicki B. Le Bouguénec C.

The structure of an AfaE-III trimer was solved at a resolution of 3.3 Å using multiple anomalous dispersion methods and a selenomethionine-labeled form of AfaE-III (Table I, Fig. 1a, and “Experimental Procedures”). The structure of DraE was then solved using this model as a starting model for phasing by molecular replacement. In all three differently packed crystal forms have been obtained (two AfaE-III forms and a single DraE form), with the exception of the naturally differing side chains derived from the sequence differences, AfaE-III and DraE possess identical structures (Fig. 1b); the structures superimpose with a root mean square deviation of 0.6 Å over all backbone atoms. Moreover, structural comparison reveals a close superimposition between the average solution structure of AfaE-dsc (11Anderson K.L. Billington J. Pettigrew D. Cota E. Simpson P. Roversi P. Chen H.A.

Open table in a new tab Despite possessing an identical fold to monomeric AfaE-dsc, the trimer (Fig. 1a) consists of intermolecular disulfide bonded monomers in which the N-terminal donor strand is folded back to form an intramolecular, anti-parallel β-strand G. This is facilitated by rearrangement of only five residues in the A1-A2 linker that allows β-strand A1 to slot into an identical position in a neighboring subunit (Fig. 1, a and c). We believe this to be an artifactual domain swapping that occurs as a result of cytoplasmic expression in the absence of the chaperone and illustrates the potential problems that can occur in unassisted assembly of fimbrae/pilins. It also represents one of only a few observations describing cyclic domain-swapped trimers (38Zegers I. Deswarte J. Wyns L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 818-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 39Liu Y. Gotte G. Libonati M. Eisenberg D. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 371-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) and reflects the inherent conformational malleability of these domains. Non-reducing SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1d) confirms this conclusion as analysis of adhesive organelles purified from the surface of Dr+ bacteria could not detect the existence of a disulfide bonded polymer. Despite this misfolding, the atomic structures of the trimeric adhesins differ from the correctly folded form at only five residues (those in the A1-A2 linker) because for the majority of the residues it is simply which subunit they originate from that differs rather than their location within the protein fold being changed. Therefore it is not surprising that earlier biological analyses using oligomeric adhesins found them to be biologically active (12Jouve M. Garcia M.I. Courcoux P. Labigne A. Gounon P. Le Bouguenec C. Infect. Immun. 1997; 65: 4082-4089Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 35Garcia M.I. Gounon P. Courcoux P. Labigne A. Le Bouguenec C. Mol.

Microbiol. 2002; 45: 439-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). X-ray Structure of a DraE-chloramphenicol Complex—The high degree of structural similarity between AfaE-III and DraE does not facilitate an understanding of their subtly different biology; in particular, the precise structural basis of the differential susceptibility to inhibition of CD55-binding by Cm (22Carnoy C. Moseley S.L. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 23: 365-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Therefore we decided to determine the structure of a DraE-Cm complex. High resolution data for the DraE-Cm complex (1.9 Å, Table I) were collected from co-crystals grown in the presence of 2.8 mm Cm (see “Experimental Procedures”). These crystals were in space group P3 and were phased by molecular replacement with the DraE coordinates described above (see “Experimental Procedures”). Calculation of unbiased Fo – Fc difference Fourier maps prior to construction of a model for the bound Cm (Fig. 2a) allowed unambiguous positioning of the drug, and the coordinates for the complex were subject to further rounds of refinement to yield the model described in Table I (Fig. 2). Other data sets collected from crystals that were grown in the absence of Cm and then soaked in Cm at a range of concentrations (down to 0.1 mm) prior to data collection showed Cm to be bound in identical fashion (data not shown). The DraE-Cm complex structure reveals that Cm binds in a surface pocket between the N-terminal portion of strand B and the C-terminal portion of strand E and lies within the CD55-binding site identified by chemical shift mapping (11Anderson K.L. Billington J. Pettigrew D. Cota E. Simpson P. Roversi P. Chen H.A. Urvil P. du Merle L. Barlow P.N. Medof M.E. Smith R.A.G. Nowicki B. Le Bouguénec C. Lea S.M. Matthews S. Mol. Cell. 2004; 101: 647-657Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Cm is anchored at one end by van der Waals contacts of its CHCl2 moiety with the methylene groups of Gly-113 and Gly-42 and Pro-40 and Pro-43 residues and at the other end by stacking of the p-nitro group against the side chain of Ile111 (Fig. 2). The ring of Tyr-115 closes the bottom of this hydrophobic pocket with contacts to the chlorine atoms and additional contacts to the C-α atoms of Ile-114. Binding of Cm in this site clearly suggests that the Cm sensitivity of DraE is caused by a direct disruption of the CD55-binding surface of DraE because the Cm masks a portion of the DraE surface previously shown to be involved in binding of CD55 (11Anderson K.L. Billington J. Pettigrew D. Cota E. Simpson P. Roversi P. Chen H.A. Urvil P. du Merle L. Barlow P.N. Medof M.E. Smith R.A.G. Nowicki B. Le Bouguénec C. Lea S.M. Matthews S. Mol. Cell. 2004; 101: 647-657Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (101) Google Scholar). This Cm binding site is seen to be in close proximity to two of the three sequence differences between AfaE-III and DraE (Fig. 3a) and may therefore provide an explanation for the reported lack of activity for Cm against AfaE-III binding of CD55. In the crystal structure of AfaE-III, the Thr88Met mutation puts the side chain of Met-88 into the hydrophobic pocket occupied by Cm in DraE (Fig. 3b), and the Ile111Thr mutation replaces the Ile, which packs against the p-nitro group and neighboring residues crucial for Cm recognition. These structural differences seem sufficient to produce the reported lack of Cm sensitivity for AfaE-III. Carnoy and Moseley (22Carnoy C. Moseley S.L. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 23: 365-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) have demonstrated previously that the single Ile111Thr mutant completely abolishes Cm binding. Our data suggest that the Thr88Met mutation may also play an important role in the lack of Cm binding to AfaE-III. To provide additional evidence for the observations seen in the crystal structure of the DraE-Cm complex, we performed an NMR chemical shift mapping experiment on monomeric DraE-dsc in the presence of increasing concentrations of Cm. A number of heteronuclear single quantum coherence peaks shift upon titration with Cm, which is consistent with a weak but specific interaction between Cm and DraE (Fig. 2c). Based on changes in 15N against 1H ppm, significant peak shifts were grouped into large, medium, and small. The largest chemical shift changes were seen in amide peaks corresponding to residues Tyr-115 and Ile-114, both of which are implicated by our crystal structure to be crucial for the DraE-Cm interaction. Furthermore, the medium and small peak shifts map to the region of the DraE-Cm interface (Fig. 2, d and e). These observations were further probed with surface plasmon resonance experiments to examine CD55 binding by the adhesins in the presence of Cm (Fig. 3c). These studies confirm earlier reports in that CD55 binding by DraE is seen to be Cm sensitive with ∼50% inhibition seen to occur with 2.8 mm Cm, whereas AfaE-III binding to CD55 is not significantly altered by Cm at this concentration. These results confirm that the subtle alterations seen between the AfaE-III and DraE are indeed sufficient to ablate Cm sensitivity. The structure of the DraE-Cm complex may provide the start point for the design of novel antimicrobial compounds because, in contrast to earlier structures for Cm-ligand complexes (37Izard T. Ellis J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2690-2700Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 40Hansen J.L. Moore P.B. Steitz T.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 330: 1061-1075Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar) where binding of Cm involves burial of the benzene ring, the interactions seen here are focused on burial of the chlorines. This observation may allow design of novel therapeutics that maintain the geometry of the adhesin-Cm interaction without the nitro-benzene ring and hence avoid the toxic side effects associated with therapeutic use of Cm caused by intercalation into the human ribosome. Because the lack of sensitivity to Cm of the AfaE-III is seen to be dependent on covering of the Cm site by a single side chain we speculate that agents designed to bind with higher affinity would be able to displace this side chain and so achieve more wide ranging action against this whole class of bacterial adhesins.

Here we describe bacterial expression and characterization of the chicken cone PDE6 regulatory GAF-A and GAF-B domains. High affinity cGMP binding was found only for GAF-A as predicted from sequence alignments with the GAF domains of PDE2 and PDE5. A homology model of the GAF-A domain of chicken cone PDE6 based on the crystal structure of mouse PDE2A GAF-B was used to identify residues likely to make contact with cGMP. Alanine mutagenesis of 4 of these residues (F123A, D169A, T172A, and T176A) showed that each was absolutely required for cGMP binding. Three of these residues map to the H4 helical structure of the GAF-A domain indicating this region as a key structural component for cGMP binding. Mutagenesis of another residue, S97A, decreased cGMP binding affinity 5-fold.

Since little data is available on the properties of the chicken cone PDE6 holoenzyme, we also characterized the native PDEs of chicken retina. Two histone-activated PDE6 peaks were separated by ion exchange chromatography and identified by mass spectrometry as cone and rod photoreceptor PDE6s, respectively. Both of these PDEs had cGMP binding and kinetic properties similar to their corresponding bovine photoreceptor PDEs.

There are two classes of photoreceptors, cones and rods, that differ substantially in their response to light (1Palczewski K. Saari J.C. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1997; 7: 500-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 2Helmreich E.J. Hofmann K.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1286: 285-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 3Pugh E.N. Cobbs W.H. Vision Res. 1986; 26: 1613-1643Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Rods are very sensitive to low levels of light and can respond to a single photon. Cones are about 100 times less sensitive but respond faster, and the light signal can be terminated more rapidly than in rods (3Pugh E.N. Cobbs W.H. Vision Res. 1986; 26: 1613-1643Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 4Baylor D.A. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1987; 28: 34-49PubMed Google Scholar). Both rod and cone photoreceptors can sense and respond to changes of light through a G-protein-mediated signaling cascade that activates a family of cGMP-specific phosphodiesterases, PDE6s. 1The abbreviations used are: PDE, 3′,5′-cyclic-nucleotide phosphodiesterase; GAF, cGMP-regulated PDEs, Anabaena adenylyl cyclase, E. coli protein FhlA; IBMX, 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine; MS, mass spectrometry; MS/MS, tandem mass spectrometry; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; H4, helix α-4. Activation of these PDEs decreases the level of cGMP and thereby modulates the activity of a cyclic nucleotide-gated cation channel. This in turn controls the release of neurotransmitter from the photoreceptor neuron. Therefore, PDE6s play a crucial role in both rod and cone phototransduction. The rod PDE6 holoenzyme has been characterized as a heterotetramer containing one α-subunit (PDE6A), one β-subunit (PDE6B), and two γ-subunits (5Deterre P. Pfister C. Bigay J. Chabre M. Biochimie (Paris). 1987; 69: 365-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Cone PDE6 is composed of two identical α′-subunits (PDE6C) and two γ-subunits (6Gillespie P.G. Beavo J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8133-8141Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The α-, β-, and α′-subunits contain the catalytic sites that hydrolyze cGMP. The γ-subunits bind to the holoenzyme and inhibit phosphodiesterase activity. Cone and some rod PDE6s also contain a δ-subunit that may target the normally membrane-bound PDE6 to the cytosol (7Gillespie P.G. Beavo J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 4311-4315Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 8Florio S.K. Prusti R.K. Beavo J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24036-24047Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). However, the δ-subunit is also a component of several other proteins and therefore not unique to photoreceptors (8Florio S.K. Prusti R.K. Beavo J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24036-24047Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Although in most vertebrate retinas, cones are much less abundant than rods, the chicken retina is cone-dominant. In this species, cones outnumber rods six to one in the central retina and three to one in the peripheral retina (9Morris V.B. Shorey C.D. J. Comp. Neurol. 1967; 129: 313-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Most previous biochemical studies of the cone PDE6 isoenzyme have been carried out using bovine retinas due to their large size and availability. Nevertheless a cDNA predicted from homology arguments to encode the chicken cone PDE6 α′-subunit has been isolated and characterized (10Semple-Rowland S.L. Green D.A. Exp. Eye Res. 1994; 59: 365-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Similarly a cDNA most homologous to the bovine PDE6 β-subunit cDNA also has been reported from chicken pineal gland (11Morin F. Lugnier C. Kameni J. Voisin P. J. Neurochem. 2001; 78: 88-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). PDE6 is a member of the 11 families of Class 1 phosphodiesterases that hydrolyze cyclic nucleotides. Five of these PDE families, PDEs 2, 5, 6, 10, and 11, contain one or two complete GAF domains in their N-terminal regulatory regions (12Beavo J.A. Physiol. Rev. 1995; 75: 725-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (1643) Google Scholar, 13Soderling S.H. Beavo J.A. Curr. Opin. Cell. Biol. 2000; 12: 174-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar). GAF domains are regulatory small molecule-binding domains originally named for their presence in cGMP-regulated PDEs, certain adenylyl cyclases and the transcription factor FhlA of bacteria (14Aravind L. Ponting C.P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 458-459Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). Cyclic GMP binds to one of two GAF domains of PDE2, PDE5, and PDE6 (6Gillespie P.G. Beavo J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8133-8141Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Martins T.J. Mumby M.C. Beavo J.A. J. Biol.

Chem. 2002; 277: 47581-47587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The catalytic activity of PDE2A is allosterically stimulated by cGMP binding to its GAF-B domain (15Martins T.J. Mumby M.C. Beavo J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 1973-1979Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In PDE5, cGMP binding to the GAF-A domains increases PDE5 catalytic activity and potentiates phosphorylation at an N-terminal serine (17Rybalkin S.D. Rybalkina I.G. Shimizu-Albergine M. Tang X.B. Beavo J.A. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 469-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 18Corbin J.D. Blount M.A. Weeks II, J.L. Beasley A. Kuhn K.P. Ho Y.S. Saidi L.F. Hurley J.H. Kotera J. Francis S.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 63: 1364-1372Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The functions, regulation, and roles of GAF domains in PDEs have been comprehensively reviewed recently (19Zoraghi R. Corbin J.D. Francis S.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 2004; 65: 267-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). For the amphibian photoreceptor PDE6, it has been found that cGMP occupancy at a GAF domain enhances P-γ binding to the holoenzyme (20Cote R.H. Bownds M.D. Arshavsky V.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4845-4849Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 21Yamazaki M. Li N. Bondarenko V.A. Yamazaki R.K. Baehr W. Yamazaki A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40675-40686Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Several roles for cGMP binding have been proposed. For example, it has been postulated that non-catalytic cGMP binding to PDE6 may be involved in the recovery from light stimulation and light adaptation (22D'Amours M.R. Cote R.H. Biochem. J. 1999; 340: 863-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In this case, the GAF sites serve as a cGMP reservoir to buffer cytoplasmic cGMP levels in the dark and accelerate the return of high cGMP to basal levels upon light activation of the PDE. Another model suggests that cGMP binding to a GAF domain regulates the duration of transducin activation of PDE6 by modulating the affinity of P-γ (23Mou H. Grazio III, H.J. Cook T.A. Beavo J.A. Cote R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18813-18820Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 24Mou H. Cote R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27527-27534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). These models are not mutually exclusive. Recently the three-dimensional structure of the mouse PDE2A GAF-A/B domains was determined by x-ray diffraction crystallography at 2.9-Å resolution (25Martinez S. Wu A. Glavas N. Tang X. Turley S. Hol W. Beavo J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 13260-13265Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). The regulatory PDE2 GAF-A/B domains form a parallel dimer in which only GAF-B binds cGMP. There are 11 amino acid residues that make contact with cGMP and line the binding pocket. In PDE5, 10 of these 11 residues are identical in GAF-A, which therefore allowed the prediction that this would be the cGMP-binding domain of this PDE (25Martinez S. Wu A. Glavas N. Tang X. Turley S. Hol W. Beavo J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 13260-13265Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). It was subsequently confirmed that GAF-A of PDE5 is sufficient for high affinity cGMP binding (26Liu L. Underwood T. Li H. Pamukcu R. Thompson W.J. Cell. Signal. 2002; 14: 45-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). A consensus cGMP-binding motif, based on the similarity between PDE2A GAF-B and PDE5 GAF-A domains, has been proposed (Sequence 1, Ref. 25Martinez S. Wu A. Glavas N. Tang X. Turley S. Hol W. Beavo J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 13260-13265Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Mutagenesis in this motif in PDE5 suggested that the Phe in the FD dyad of PDE5 GAF-A domain is essential for cGMP binding (27Sopory S. Balaji S. Srinivasan N. Visweswariah S.S. FEBS Lett. 2003; 539: 161-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). A similar finding has also been shown for the PDE2A GAF-B domain (28Wu A.Y. Tang X.B. Martinez S.E. Ikeda K. Beavo J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 37928-37938Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Eight of the 11 residues in mouse PDE2A, (i.e. Ser-424, Phe-438, Asp-439, Val-484, Asp-485, Thr-488, Thr-492, and Glu-512) contact cGMP via side chains. The crystal structure of PDE2 GAF-B and recent mutagenesis studies suggest that its ability to discriminate cGMP versus cAMP is largely determined by Asp-439, which provides positive specificity for cGMP binding via hydrogen bonds between its main chain NH, side chain carboxyl, and the O-6 and N-1 positions of the guanine base of cGMP (25Martinez S. Wu A. Glavas N. Tang X. Turley S. Hol W. Beavo J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 13260-13265Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). This residue also provides a negative determinant for cAMP (28Wu A.Y. Tang X.B. Martinez S.E. Ikeda K. Beavo J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 37928-37938Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Compared with PDE2 and PDE5, most PDE6s have both higher binding affinity and higher specificity for cGMP (6Gillespie P.G. Beavo J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8133-8141Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Hebert M.C. Schwede F. Jastorff B. Cote R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5557-5565Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Bovine rod PDE6 binds cGMP with Kd values reported from 25 to 500 nm at a low affinity binding site (23Mou H. Grazio III, H.J. Cook T.A. Beavo J.A. Cote R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18813-18820Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) and <500 pm at a high affinity site (30.Gillespie, P. G. (1988) Identification, Purification, and Characterization of Bovine Rod and Cone Photoreceptor Phosphodiesterase Isozymes. Ph.D. thesis, University of WashingtonGoogle Scholar). Bovine cone PDE6C appears to have one type of cGMP-binding site with a Kd of about 10 nm (7Gillespie P.G. Beavo J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 4311-4315Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). A chimeric bovine PDE6C/PDE5 enzyme also has been reported to contain a single class of non-catalytic cGMP-binding sites with a Kd of 450 nm (31Granovsky A.E. Natochin M. McEntaffer R.L. Haik T.L. Francis S.H. Corbin J.D. Artemyev N.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24485-24490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In this study we report on the bacterial expression of the tandem GAF domains of chicken cone PDE6 and show that the basic features of the cGMP-binding pocket is highly conserved between the cone PDE6C and mouse PDE2A GAF domains. We demonstrate that GAF-A instead of GAF-B contains the single high affinity cGMP-binding domain of PDE6C and that the conserved residues of PDE6C (Phe-123, Asp-169, Thr-172, and Thr-176) each appear to play significant roles in forming a functional cGMP-binding pocket. Finally we report on the isolation and characterization of the chicken PDE6 holoenzymes and show that their cGMP binding characteristics are similar to those of the isolated chicken GAF domains and also to their corresponding mammalian PDE6 counterparts. Chicken eyes were obtained from the Tyson Co. (Little Rock, AK). Bovine eyes were purchased from Schenk Packing (Stanwood, WA). [3H]cGMP was obtained from Amersham Biosciences; cGMP, 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX), isopropyl β-thioglucopyranoside were from Sigma. Pfu DNA polymerase and the QuikChange® site-directed mutagenesis kits were obtained from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). Restriction enzymes were purchased from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). Isolation and Initial Purification of Chicken Rod and Cone PDE6 Holoenzyme—In a typical experiment 50–100 chicken retinas were dissected in the light, separated from much of the vitreous humor, and homogenized in hypotonic buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) using a dozen strokes of a motor-driven Teflon pestle in a glass homogenizer (Potter-Elvehjem tissue grinder). The homogenate was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h. The supernatant was applied to a 75-ml DE52 anion-exchange column and eluted with a linear NaCl gradient (20–300 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mm MgCl2) run at a flow rate of 1 ml/min at 4 °C. Sixty fractions of 5 ml each were collected at 4 °C and assayed for histone-activated (2.5 mg/ml, type VIII-S) phosphodiesterase activity by measuring the release of phosphate (7Gillespie P.G. Beavo J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 4311-4315Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). cGMP Affinity Column Purification of Chicken PDE6 Holoenzyme— Two histone-activated PDE activity peaks of approximately equal activity were separated on the DE52 anion-exchange column. Approximately 35 ml of the first histone-activated PDE6 peak was pooled and loaded onto an epoxy-Sepharose cGMP affinity column (7Gillespie P.G. Beavo J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 4311-4315Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 15Martins T.J. Mumby M.C. Beavo J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 1973-1979Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The column was washed two times with low salt buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and the cGMP-binding proteins, including chicken photoreceptor PDE, were eluted with 1 mm cGMP in the presence of 2 mm EDTA and 1 mm IBMX in low salt buffer at room temperature. The presence and purity of chicken photoreceptor PDEs were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and silver staining. Immunoprecipitation of Chicken PDE6s—It has been shown previously that the ROS-3 monoclonal antibody recognizes both rod and cone photoreceptor PDE from bovine retina (32Hurwitz R.L. Bunt-Milam A.H. Beavo J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 8612-8618Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The putative chicken cone and rod PDE6 holoenzymes, corresponding to the first or the second histone-activated PDE6 peaks, were immunoprecipitated using the ROS-3 monoclonal antibody bound to Protein G. Typically 15 ml of the DE52 fraction of either chicken rod or cone PDE was mixed with 200 μl of antibody resin (500 μg of antibody bound to 200 μl of Protein G PLUS-agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) for 1 h at 4 °C) in the presence of 150 mm NaCl. After mixing overnight, the resin was pelleted and washed three times with 1 ml of 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mm MgCl2, 300 mm NaCl at 4 °C. Identification of Chicken Rod and Cone PDE6 Using Mass Spectrometry—On-line nano-liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization-MS/MS experiments were performed on an API-US quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometer (Micromass) equipped with the CapLC system (Waters, Milford, MA). The stream select module was configured with an OPTI-PAK Symmetry300 C18 trap column (Waters) connected in series with a nanoscale analytical column (75-μm inner diameter × 15 cm, packed with 3.5 μm, XTerra MS C18 particles (Waters)). The eluate from the cGMP affinity column was concentrated to 100 μg/ml using a Centriprep centrifugal filter (Millipore) and then digested with 5 μg/ml trypsin. In other experiments immunoprecipitated proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie Blue. The protein bands corresponding to the molecular weights of rod and cone PDE6 were sliced out from the gel and digested with trypsin for analysis by mass spectrometry (33Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 850-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (7818) Google Scholar). Protein digests (5 μl) were injected onto the trap column at 10 μl/min, desalted, and back-flushed to the analytical column at 0.5 μl/min using a gradient elution. The gradient consisted of 5–50% solvent B for 30 min followed by 50% B for 15 min and 50–90% B for 5 min (A = 5% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid; B = 95% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid). Quadrupole time-of-flight parameters were set as follows: the electrospray potential was set to 3.5 kV, the cone voltage was set to 60 V, the extraction cone was set to 2 V, and the source temperature was set to 80 °C. The MS survey scan was m/z 400–1600 with a scan time of 1 s, and the collision energy was set to 10 eV. When the intensity of a peptide peak rose above a threshold of 20 counts, tandem mass spectra were acquired using the data-dependent algorithm implemented in the MassLynx acquisition software. For operation in the MS/MS mode, the scan time was increased to 2 s, the isolation width was set to include the full isotopic distribution of each peak (3 Da), and the collision energy was set to 15–25 eV. MS/MS spectra were recorded for the doubly, triply, and quadruply charged molecular ions of peptides. All MS/MS spectra were searched against the non-redundant National Center for Biotechnology Information protein data base by using MASCOT (34Perkins D.N. Pappin D.J. Creasy D.M. Cottrell J.S. Electrophoresis. 1999; 20: 3551-3567Crossref PubMed Scopus (6773) Google Scholar) assuming a mass tolerance of 0.3 Da for both the precursor and the fragment ions. cGMP Binding to the Chicken Rod and Cone PDE6 Holoenzymes— Chicken cone PDE6 holoenzyme was immunoprecipitated as described previously except less sample and antibody were used. Usually 1–2 ml of DE52 fraction of chicken rod or cone PDE was mixed with 100–200 μl of antibody resin (100–200 μg of antibody). After incubation overnight, the resin was collected by centrifugation and washed three times with 1 ml of 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mm MgCl2, 300 mm NaCl. The PDE immunoprecipitates were then incubated with 5 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 25 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm IBMX, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 2–600 nm (7.5 Ci/mmol) [3H]cGMP (200-μl total volume) for 2 h at room temperature. [3H]cGMP bound to the immunoprecipitated PDE was separated from free ligand by filtration on Millipore filters (0.45-μm HA). The Millipore filters were dissolved in Filter-Count® complete liquid scintillation counting mixture (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) overnight and counted in a Packard 1600 TR liquid scintillation analyzer. cGMP Binding and cAMP Binding by Individual Chicken Cone PDE6 GAF Domain Proteins—The binding of cGMP or cAMP to GAF domain proteins was analyzed by the Millipore filter binding assay as described previously (37Yamazaki A. Sen I. Bitensky M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 11619-11624Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) usually as a competition assay (28Wu A.Y. Tang X.B. Martinez S.E. Ikeda K. Beavo J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 37928-37938Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). For the cGMP binding competition assays, 1 nm GAF domain protein was incubated with a fixed amount of [3H]cGMP (usually 1 nm) and various amounts of unlabeled cGMP from 2 to 600 nm for 2 h at room temperature. For the cAMP binding competition assays, 1 nm GAF domain protein was incubated with 1 nm [3H]cGMP and various amounts of unlabeled cAMP from 1 μm to 100 mm for 2 h at room temperature. Most Kd values reported in this study were determined by the homologous or heterologous displacement methods. Care was taken to utilize concentrations of protein that were lower than the measured Kd so that the data represented true binding curves and not a titration analysis. Similarly for all IC50 determinations the concentrations of labeled radioligand was adjusted to be lower than the measured IC50 value so that the IC50 approached the Ki for the cold ligand (35Cheng Y. Prusoff W.H. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1973; 22: 3099-3108Crossref PubMed Scopus (12288) Google Scholar, 36Rovati G.E. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1998; 19: 365-369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Therefore, the affinity of the ligand can be calculated using the equation of Cheng and Prusoff (35Cheng Y. Prusoff W.H. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1973; 22: 3099-3108Crossref PubMed Scopus (12288) Google Scholar) that states that the equilibrium dissociation constant of the ligand, Ki = IC50/(1 + [Radioligand]/Kd). In the case of homologous displacement, e.g. [3H]cGMP being displaced by cGMP, the equation further simplifies to Ki = IC50 - [Radioligand] since Ki = Kd. Curve fitting was done using GraphPad Prism4 with a one-site competition model constraining the 100 and 0% binding points. Better fits were not obtained with a multiple site model. Enzyme Kinetics of Chicken Rod and Cone PDE6 Holoenzymes—The kinetics for both cGMP and cAMP hydrolysis of the chicken rod and cone PDE6 were determined using fractions from the ion-exchange column. PDE6 activity was assayed in the presence of histone (2.5 mg/ml, type VIII-S, Sigma) by PDE activity assay using either [3H]cGMP or [3H]cAMP as substrate (15Martins T.J. Mumby M.C. Beavo J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 1973-1979Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Hurwitz R.L. Bunt-Milam A.H. Beavo J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 8612-8618Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The Km values for cGMP and cAMP hydrolysis were derived by nonlinear regression analysis using GraphPad Prism® from data points obtained using 1–250 μm [3H]cGMP or 50–2500 μm [3H]cAMP as substrate. Three-dimensional Structure Model of Chicken Cone PDE6 GAF-A Domain—A three-dimensional model for the chicken PDE6 GAF-A domain was constructed based upon the crystal structure of the mouse PDE2A GAF-B domain using the Swiss-Model program (38Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2714-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (9584) Google Scholar). Sequence alignments were made with the ClustalW program (39Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (55744) Google Scholar). After adding side chains from a rotamer data base, the working model was energy-minimized using GROMOS 96 (38Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2714-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (9584) Google Scholar). Cloning, Expression, and Purification of the GAF Domains of Chicken Cone PDE6 —The pRunH plasmid (a derivative of the pMW172 vector (40Way M. Pope B. Gooch J. Hawkins M. Weeds A.G. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 4103-4109Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar)) containing a C-terminal His6 tag was used as an expression vector for the GAF-A, GAF-B, and GAF-A/B domains of chicken PDE6C. Full-length chicken PDE6C cDNA was a generous gift from Dr. Semple-Rowland (University of Florida). The boundaries of GAF-A/B, GAF-A, and GAF-B domain constructs were amino acids 42–458, 42–238, and 248–458, respectively, based on homology alignment with other PDE GAF domains. DNA coding for these domains was PCR-amplified using the full-length chicken PDE6C as template and primers containing BamHI and XhoI sites. The PCR products were ligated into the pRunH vector downstream of the T7 promoter. Chicken cone PDE6 GAF domain constructs were transformed into C41 competent Escherichia coli. Protein expression was induced by isopropyl β-thioglucopyranoside at 16 °C, and cells were grown overnight. The cell pellets were resuspended in lysis buffer (100 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 μg/ml DNase I, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin) and disrupted through either a French Press or a Microfluidizer® cell disruption apparatus. The lysates were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C, and the supernatant was incubated with Talon® resin (Clontech) for 2 h at 4 °C. The bound His6-tagged proteins were eluted with buffer containing 150 mm imidazole, 50 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.0), and 300 mm NaCl. The eluted proteins were concentrated using a Centriprep centrifugal filter (Millipore) and subjected to gel filtration using a Superose-12 column (Amersham Biosciences) to remove aggregated protein and determine the apparent molecular weight of the GAF proteins. SDS gel electrophoresis was carried out to determine the purity of the isolated GAF domain proteins. Site-directed Mutagenesis Studies on Chicken Cone PDE6C GAF-A and GAF-A/B Domains—The QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) was used to make point mutations in chicken cone PDE6 GAF-A and GAF-A/B cDNA constructs. E. coli XL-blue competent cells were used for transformations, and the mutant cDNAs were purified by QIAprep® spin miniprep kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). All mutant cDNAs were sequenced to ensure the proper in-frame subcloning and the desired mutation. Modeling of the Chicken Cone PDE GAF-A Domain—Sequence alignments between the GAF-A and GAF-B domains of chicken PDE6C to GAF-B of mouse PDE2A showed that the GAF-A domain of PDE6 had very high homology to PDE2A GAF-B and therefore that the basic architecture of the cGMP-binding pocket might be conserved (Fig. 1A). Of eight side chains known to contact cGMP in PDE2 GAF-B, five are identical in PDE6C GAF-A, and three of these are in the helix α-4 (H4) of PDE2A GAF-B. In addition, Asp-439 of mouse PDE2A GAF-B is conserved as Glu-124 in chicken PDE6C GAF-A. A three-dimensional homology model of chicken cone PDE6 GAF-A based upon the crystal structure of PDE2A GAF-B domain is shown in Fig. 1B. Because of gaps generated by the homology alignment of the two GAF sequences, two extra insertions are introduced as solvent-exposed loops in the modeled structure of chicken cone PDE6 GAF-A. Since both sequences are relatively hydrophobic this does not seem unreasonable. The first insertion resides between the first α-helix and the first β-sheet strand. The second insertion is located between the first and second β-strand. Neither of the two insertions interrupts the secondary structure of the model. For the rest of the sequence, the ove"

Lateral associations between these FtsZ polymers to form bundles or sheets are widely predicted to be extremely important for FtsZ function in vivo. We have carried out a study in vitro of FtsZ polymer formation and bundling using linear dichroism (LD) to assess structural properties of the polymers. We demonstrate proof-of-principle experiments to show that LD can be used as a technique to follow FtsZ polymerization, and we present the LD spectra of FtsZ polymers. Our subsequent examination of FtsZ polymer bundling induced by calcium reveals a substantial increase in the LD signal indicative of increased polymer length and rigidity. We also detect a specific conformational change in the guanine moiety associated with bundling, whereas the conformation and configuration of the FtsZ monomers within the polymer remain largely unchanged. We demonstrate that other divalent cations can induce this conformational change in FtsZ-bound GTP coincident with polymer bundling. Therefore, we present “flipping” of the guanine moiety in FtsZ-bound GTP as a mechanism that explains the link between reduced GTPase activity, increased polymer stability, and polymer bundling.

The FtsZ protein, a structural and functional homologue of eukaryotic tubulins, is a polymer-forming GTPase that plays a critical role in the cell division process in bacteria. Before the onset of cell division in the γ-proteobacterium Escherichia coli, FtsZ polymers form a dynamic ring (the Z-ring) around the cell center on the inner surface of the cytoplasmic membrane (1Margolin W.

Holland B. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 318: 219-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The Z-ring recruits at least ten accessory proteins which are essential for cell division to proceed (4Chen J.C. Beckwith J. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 42: 395-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 5Hale C.A. de Boer P.A.J. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 2552-2556Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 6Ma X. Ehrhardt D.W.

Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 7167-7172Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), and then reduces in diameter until cytokinesis is complete. FtsZ is extensively conserved among prokaryotes with only one phylum of archaebacteria (Crenarchaeota) and three free-living species of bacteria (Ureaplasma urealyticum, Prosthecobacter dejongii, and Pirellula sp.) proven to lack ftsZ genes thus far (8Vaughan S.

In addition, FtsZ is required for chloroplast division and may be essential for division of some mitochondria (10Miyagishima S.-Y. Nishida K. Kuroiwa T. Trends Plant Sci. 2003; 8: 432-438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 11Osteryoung K.W. Nunnari J.

Elucidating the mechanism by which the Z-ring drives constriction is, therefore, critical to our understanding of cell division in prokaryotes and cytokinesis in eukaryotic organelles. Monomers of FtsZ protein associate in vitro in a GTP-dependent fashion into linear, unbranched, polymeric fibers whose dynamics result in the hydrolysis of GTP (13Romberg L. Mitchison T.J. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 282-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 14Romberg L. Levin P.A. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2003; 57: 125-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). There is considerable evidence to suggest that the interface between two FtsZ monomers in the polymeric form is crucial for this GTPase activity, with the “top” and “bottom” of consecutive monomers combining to form the GTP-binding pocket (15Erickson H.P. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 133-137Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 16Scheffers D.J. de Wit J.G. den Blaauwen T. Driessen A.J.

Although GTP binding favors polymer formation, the hydrolysis of GTP to GDP promotes shortening and bending of the FtsZ polymers (20Lu C. Reedy M. Erickson H.P. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 164-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). The simplest polymer form of FtsZ, a one-monomer wide protofilament, has been observed in vitro (21Romberg L. Simon M. Erickson H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11743-11753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar); however, FtsZ fibers are more commonly seen as pairs of parallel protofilaments called thick filaments e.g. Refs. 18Lowe J.

However, in each case where detailed structure has been obtained, these consist of thick filaments in different arrangements (parallel, anti-parallel, twisted, straight, etc.) (18Lowe J. Amos L.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2364-2371Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 22Lowe J. Amos L.A. Biol. Chem. 2000; 381: 993-999Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 24Oliva M.A. Huecas S.

Critically, the structure of the Z-ring in vivo remains uncharacterized; however, it seems likely from these in vitro studies that the Z-ring consists of thick filaments arranged in either sheets/ribbons or bundles. FtsZ polymerization is dynamic both in vivo and in vitro. In vivo the Z-ring polymerizes quickly (30Addinall S.G. Cao C. Lutkenhaus J. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 4277-4284Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 31Stricker J. Maddox P. Salmon E.D. Erickson H.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A. 2002; 99: 3171-3175Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). In vitro measurements have determined that FtsZ polymer dynamics depend on multiple factors. These include pH, concentrations of magnesium, potassium, calcium, and competing nucleotide tri-phosphates, macromolecular crowding, and the presence of FtsZ-interacting proteins (23Gueiros-Filho F.J. Losick R. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2544-2556Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar, 26Mukherjee A. Lutkenhaus J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 462-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar, 27Yu X.C.

Lutkenhaus J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2885-2890Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Crucially, differences in the type of polymers formed under these various conditions correspond to differences in their longevity and dynamics. An example of this is the bundling of polymers caused by the presence of millimolar concentrations of calcium (27Yu X.C. Margolin W. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5455-5463Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 33Mukherjee A. Lutkenhaus J. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 823-832Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This bundling may be similar to that observed when FtsZ interacts with accessory proteins such as ZipA and ZapA in vitro (23Gueiros-Filho F.J. Losick R. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2544-2556Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar, 28Hale C.A. Rhee A.C. de Boer P.A. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 5153-5166Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) and (at least in the case of calcium) results in a reduction of GTPase activity and slower turnover of monomers (27Yu X.C. Margolin W. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5455-5463Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 34Scheffers D.J. den Blaauwen T. Driessen A.J. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 35: 1211-1219Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Subtle changes to the extent of bundling are also observed when FtsZ is polymerized in buffers of varying pH. Consistent with the effects of calcium, decreasing pH results in increased bundling, lower GTPase activity, and more stable polymers (26Mukherjee A. Lutkenhaus J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 462-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar, 33Mukherjee A. Lutkenhaus J. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 823-832Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, controlling the extent to which lateral interactions occur between FtsZ fibers is likely to be important for Z-ring function in vivo. The alteration in lateral association caused by these extraneous factors is a process that is little understood at a structural level. It is likely that such associations are caused by alterations of the surface properties of the FtsZ polymer that encourage fiber-fiber interactions. It has been proposed that such changes occur by charge shielding of negatively charged FtsZ polymers (28Hale C.A. Rhee A.C. de Boer P.A. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 5153-5166Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). However, other mechanisms are possible. A conformational change within the FtsZ monomers making up the polymer or a change in the configuration of the monomer within polymers could each lead to exposure of inter-fiber binding sites. Alternatively, a combination of mechanisms may be responsible for the bundling of FtsZ fibers. Techniques for examining solution phase conformational changes in proteins are fairly well established, the most commonly used being circular dichroism (CD) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. Both provide spectroscopic information that can be deconvolved to provide measures of secondary structure content and, to some extent, side chain arrangement. Unfortunately, information on the orientation of monomeric protein units within protein polymers is less easy to obtain. In general, determining this sort of information has relied on either indirect biophysical measurement (e.g. using resonance energy transfer to triangulate monomer positions relative to one another (38Sivasothy P. Dafforn T.R. Gettins P.G.W. Lomas D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33663-33668Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar)) or direct visualization of the polymer using electron microscopy (e.g. Ref. 18Lowe J. Amos L.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2364-2371Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). We have developed the technique linear dichroism (LD) 1The abbreviations used are: LD, linear dichroism; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid.1The abbreviations used are: LD, linear dichroism; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid. (which is technically related to CD) that provides information on the orientation of secondary structural elements and aromatic side chains within protein fibers. LD is the measure of the difference in absorbance by a sample of light polarized in orthogonal directions. To obtain an LD signal the fibers are usually aligned perpendicular to the incident light beam. We have achieved this by the use of a Couette flow cell which induces alignment as a result of shear flow in a liquid. Our own advances in cuvette design have only recently permitted the use of LD to examine relatively low volume (200 μl) biological samples (39Rodger A. Rajendra J. Marrington R. Ardhammar M. Nordén B. Hirst J.B. Gilbert A.T.B. Dafforn T.R. Halsall D.J. Woolhead C.A. Robinson C. Pinheiro T.J.J., K. Seymour M. Perez N. Hannon M.J. Phys. Chem. Chem.

Royal Society of Chemistry, Cambridge, UK2002: 3-19Google Scholar). Our initial studies of some common protein fibers, including actin, amyloid, and collagen, have allowed us for the first time to assign the signals observed to known secondary structure types (41Dafforn T.R. Rajendra J. Halsall D.J. Serpell L.C. Rodger A. Biophys. J. 2004; 86: 404-410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The study presented here represents a further advancement of the technique, with reduction of sample volume to 25 μl (42Marrington R. Dafforn T.R. Halsall D.J. Andrews T. Rodger A. Biophys. J. 2004; 87: 2002-2012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In this work we have used a combination of linear and circular dichroism to examine FtsZ polymerization and bundling. We demonstrate that LD provides a measure of FtsZ polymerization kinetics that is consistent with accepted results from light-scattering measurements. We show that bundling of FtsZ protofilaments induced by the presence of millimolar amounts of calcium is detectable as a substantial increase in LD signal. Importantly, we also detect a significant change in the linear dichroism signal in the guanine region of the spectrum under conditions where polymer bundles are formed. We also show that elevated levels of Mg2+ can mimic the bundling properties of Ca2+. We have, therefore, detected a change in the conformation of the FtsZ-bound guanine moiety that correlates with (and probably accounts for) the decrease in GTPase activity associated with FtsZ polymer bundling. Hence, we provide the first putative mechanism for the link between increased polymer bundling and reductions in polymer dynamics and GTPase activity. FtsZ Purification—FtsZ was purified as described previously (36Small E. Addinall S.G. Microbiology. 2003; 149: 2235-2242Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) using a modification of protocols described by Mukherjee and Lutkenhaus (43Mukherjee A. Lutkenhaus J. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 298: 296-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) and Lu and Erickson (44Lu C. Erickson H.P. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 298: 305-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Spectroscopic Measurements—Light-scattering measurements were performed as described previously (36Small E. Addinall S.G. Microbiology. 2003; 149: 2235-2242Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) with the exception of the direct side-by-side comparisons with LD for Fig. 2. These were performed at room temperature (23 °C) using a PerkinElmer Life Sciences LS50B spectrofluorimeter with excitation and emission wavelengths of 400 nm and a slit width of 2.5 nm with a 0.3-cm path length rectangular cuvette. CD measurements were performed with a Jasco (Tokyo, Japan) J-715 spectropolarimeter at room temperature using a 0.1-mm path length demountable quartz cuvette. Data were collected every 0.5 nm from 260 to 185 nm, with a scanning speed of 100 nm min–1 and a response time of 1 s with data averaged over 8 scans. LD measurements were performed at room temperature using a Jasco J-715 spectropolarimeter adapted for LD spectroscopy (42Marrington R. Dafforn T.R. Halsall D.J. Andrews T. Rodger A. Biophys. J. 2004; 87: 2002-2012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Samples were aligned in the light beam using a custom made Couette cell. The cell was constructed by Crystal Precision Optics, Rugby, UK and consists of a cylindrical cross-section sleeve with a removable quartz capillary (sealed at one end with Araldite Rapid®) held centrally with respect to its circular face by a rubber O-ring. A quartz rod was suspended from the demountable lid into the capillary, creating an annular gap between rod and inner capillary wall of ∼0.25 mm. The rod and the center of the capillary were aligned so that the capillary was able to rotate freely. The sample (25–60 μl) was placed into the capillary before loading into the cylindrical sleeve. The lid and rod units are then lowered into position. Upon rotation of the capillary (the rod remains stationary) a shear force is induced across the sample. The cylindrical sleeve has two windows for the light to pass through to make contact with the sample. This configuration allows the use of smaller sample volumes (25–60 μl) than has previously been possible (previous cells have required 200 μl (39Rodger A. Rajendra J. Marrington R. Ardhammar M.

Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8728-8734Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar) of sample). The voltage applied to the motor that rotates the outer quartz cylinder is controlled electronically to allow the sample solution to be maintained with the highest possible degree of alignment without inducing turbulent flow and Taylor vortices. Data were collected using an interval scan measurement program available within the Jasco software. This enabled single full wavelength scans from 350 to 190 nm to be collected every minute at a scanning speed of 200 nm min–1, data pitch 0.5 nm, and with a response of 0.5 s, thus, monitoring of the kinetics of polymerization across the whole wavelength spectrum. The spectra are of suitable intensity such that only one scan was necessary. Base lines of data collected after de-polymerization of FtsZ were subtracted from all spectra. The wavelength ranges of the LD spectra were in some cases restricted by the high absorbance of the samples at low wavelength. Data reported in this paper are truncated at a point where the Beer-Lambert law is valid. LD spectra were corrected for light-scattering as per Nordh et al. (46Nordh J. Deinum J. Norden B. Eur. Biophys. J. 1986; 14: 113-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). FtsZ polymerization assays were performed essentially as described previously (36Small E. Addinall S.G. Microbiology. 2003; 149: 2235-2242Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Briefly, FtsZ at the concentration specified in individual experiments was incubated in a standard polymerization buffer (50 mm MES, pH 6.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 50 mm KCl), and GTP (the disodium salt adjusted to neutral pH) was added to a final concentration of 0.05–0.2 mm (see individual experiments) to initiate polymerization. Where specified, MgCl2 was omitted from the standard buffer, or its concentration was altered. In some experiments CaCl2 or CuCl2 were added to the basic polymerization buffer to give the final concentrations described for individual experiments in the text and figure legends. For all spectroscopic measurements samples were placed in the cuvette/capillary cell immediately upon preparation. Of the three techniques used, the longest dead time (about 40 s) was that taken to load and assemble the capillary LD unit and start the analysis. GTPase Assay—GTPase activity of newly purified FtsZ protein was determined using γ-32P-labeled GTP (Amersham Biosciences) and thinlayer chromatography as previously described (36Small E. Addinall S.G. Microbiology. 2003; 149: 2235-2242Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). For titration of the effects of various ion concentrations on FtsZ GTPase activity, we measured production of NADPH from an enzyme-linked assay that has been used previously with FtsZ (47Lockhart A. Kendrick-Jones J. FEBS Lett. 1998; 430: 278-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). This assay gave comparable values for FtsZ GTPase activity to the radioactive method but was more appropriate for multiple repeat experiments. Measurement of FtsZ Polymerization Kinetics Using LD— For a linear dichroism signal to be measured, the molecule studied has to be aligned to some degree. In the case of the flow alignment Couette system used in these studies, the molecule is aligned by virtue of it having a shape with a high aspect ratio. We predicted that LD would be an ideal technique for studying FtsZ, which polymerizes from monomers (or short oligomers) into long, unbranched, linear polymers. Monomeric units of FtsZ (which roughly approximate to spheres and have an aspect ratio close to 1) will not align and, hence, will not produce an LD signal. Polymeric forms of FtsZ were expected to align and, thus, have a flow LD signal. To test this prediction FtsZ polymerization reactions were followed by both LD and light-scattering. Samples to be observed by LD were placed in the LD cell, and their LD spectrum was measured in the UV, where the transitions of the chromophores of the protein backbone can be observed. GTP was then added to induce fiber formation, and the change in the LD signal was measured at a wavelength that is sensitive to the presence of aligned α-helical structure (FtsZ has a high α-helix content that should become apparent in the LD if fibers are formed and align). Control samples, also at room temperature, were studied by light-scattering as described under “Materials and Methods.” The measurement of the LD signal of FtsZ polymerization (Fig. 2) with time showed a very similar-shaped trace to that observed using right-angled light-scattering. It can be seen (Fig. 2) that there is an immediate large LD signal induced by the fast GTP-dependent association of FtsZ monomers to form polymers. There is then a plateau in the trace as the GTP in solution is turned over followed by a sigmoidal decrease as the GTP is exhausted and the polymers dissociate. The consistency between light-scattering and LD validates the use of LD to monitor the polymerization of FtsZ since the observed reaction kinetic is very similar to that observed previously by light-scattering (and other) techniques, e.g. Refs. 26Mukherjee A. Lutkenhaus J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 462-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar, 33Mukherjee A. Lutkenhaus J. J.

CD Spectra of FtsZ and FtsZ with GTP—To understand the conformational changes that occur within FtsZ when the protein polymerizes, CD spectra were recorded of FtsZ in the presence and absence of GTP (Fig. 3a). These data show no discernable alteration in the signal collected above 200 nm as reported previously (48Sossong Jr., T.M. Brigham-Burke M.R. Hensley P. Pearce Jr., K.H. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 14843-14850Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), with the only alteration between the two preparations being a reduction in signal intensity below 200 nm for the polymerized sample. Results from the deconvolution of the spectra of FtsZ using CDsstr (Table I) showed no significant differences from the secondary structure composition calculated from the x-ray crystal structure of FtsZ (Protein Data Bank code 1FSZ). The decrease in signal intensity of the CD spectra of FtsZ plus GTP compared with FtsZ alone can be attributed to light-scattering from the polymers that have formed upon addition of GTP.Table ICalculated secondary structure composition of FtsZ from deconvolution of CD data by CDsstr (60Johnson W.C.

The presence of millimolar quantities of Ca2+ in standard FtsZ polymerization reactions has previously been shown to induce polymer bundling (27Yu X.C. Margolin W. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5455-5463Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 33Mukherjee A. Lutkenhaus J. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 823-832Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We, therefore, used CD to compare the backbone conformation of polymerized FtsZ in the absence of Ca2+ and in the presence of increasing concentrations of Ca2+ (1, 5, and 10 mm). It should be noted that any changes induced into the GTP CD upon protein binding will contribute to these spectra. The spectra from these experiments (Fig. 3b) showed very small alterations in the region between 200 and 250 nm, with a larger change occurring at wavelengths below 200 nm when the Ca2+ concentration was increased to 10 mm. Deconvolution of these spectra with CDsstr showed only small alterations in secondary structure upon the addition of increasing amounts of Ca2+ (Table I). The variation in CD signal intensity below 200 nm is due to light-scattering caused by the polymerization a"
https://openalex.org/W2061935675,"The actions of the active metabolite of 1,25-(OH)2D3 (1,25-D) are mediated primarily by the vitamin D receptor (VDR), a member of the nuclear receptor family of ligand-activated transcription factors. Although their ligands cause transcriptional activation, many of the ligands also rapidly activate cellular signaling pathways through mechanisms that have not been fully elucidated. We find that 1,25-D causes a rapid, but sustained activation of ERK (extracellular signal-regulated kinase) in bone cell lines. However, the effect of ERK activation on VDR transcriptional activity was cell line-specific. Inhibition of ERK activation by the MEK inhibitor, U0126, stimulated VDR activity in MC3T3-E1 cells, but inhibited the activity in MG-63 cells as well as in HeLa cells. VDR is not a known target of ERK. We found that the ERK target responsible for reduced VDR activity in MC3T3-E1 cells is RXRα. MC3T3-E1 cells express lower levels of RXRβ and RXRγ than either HeLa or MG-63 cells. Although overexpression of RXRα in MC3T3-E1 cells increased VDR activity, U0126 further enhanced the activity. In contrast, overexpression of RXRγ stimulated VDR activity but abrogated the stimulation by U0126. Thus, although 1,25-D treatment activates ERK in many cell types, subsequently inducing changes independent of VDR, the effects of treatment with 1,25-D on the transcriptional activity of VDR are RXR isoform-specific. In cells in which RXRα is the VDR partner, the transcriptional activation of VDR by 1,25-D is attenuated by the concomitant activation of ERK.

Many of the actions of 1,25-D are mediated by an intracellular receptor, the vitamin D receptor (VDR), a member of the steroid/thyroid receptor superfamily of ligand-regulated transcription factors (9Ozono K.

Physiol. 1999; 277: F157-F175Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The activity of VDR is dependent not only on the concentration of receptor and hormone but also on its heterodimer partner, retinoid X receptor (RXR), and the coactivator proteins that bind to the VDR and facilitate transcription of target genes (11Christakos S. Dhawan P. Liu Y. Peng X. Porta A. J. Cell. Biochem. 2003; 88: 695-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). In addition to its actions as a modulator of transcription through activation of the VDR, 1,25-D can rapidly activate cell signaling cascades independent of a requirement for transcription (12de Boland A.R. Boland R.L. Cell Signal. 1994; 6: 717-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 13Zanello L.P. Norman A.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Rapid activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases, ERK1/ERK2 in NB4 promyelocytic leukemia cells can be induced not only by 1,25-D, but also by analogs that are unable to activate VDR, suggesting the possibility of a separate receptor (15Song X. Bishop J.E. Okamura W.H. Norman A.W. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 457-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Antibodies to a membrane protein identified by Nemere et al. (16Nemere I.

Bone Miner Res. 1998; 13: 1353-1359Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar) block the ability of 1,25-D to induce rapid calcium uptake and activation of PKC in cartilage cells. VDR-/- osteoblasts take up calcium and activate PKC similar to the wild-type osteoblasts, implicating proteins other than VDR in these actions (17Wali R.K. Kong J. Sitrin M.D. Bissonnette M. Li Y.C. J. Cell. Biochem. 2003; 88: 794-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). In contrast, Gniadecki (18Gniadecki R. J. Investig. Dermatol. 1996; 106: 1212-1217Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) has described activation of ERK through 1,25-D-induced activation of Raf as a result of interactions between VDR and the adaptor protein Shc. VDR-null osteoblasts do not exhibit ion channel responses in response to 1,25-D (13Zanello L.P. Norman A.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 1589-1594Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) and Erben et al. (14Erben R.G. Soegiarto D.W. Weber K. Zeitz U. Lieberherr M. Gniadecki R. Moller G. Adamski J. Balling R. Mol.

Thus some of the rapid actions of 1,25-D may be dependent upon VDR, whereas others are not. Nuclear receptor family members including VDR and RXR as well as many of their coactivators, are phosphoproteins whose activities are also regulated by cell signaling pathways (19Gianni M. Tarrade A.

Thus 1,25-D can modulate VDR activity both through direct binding to VDR as well as by altering the kinase activities within the cell (9Ozono K. Sone T. Pike J.W. J. Bone Miner Res. 1991; 6: 1021-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 11Christakos S. Dhawan P. Liu Y. Peng X. Porta A. J. Cell.

Immunotoxicol. 2002; 24: 31-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Although VDR has not been reported to be a substrate for ERK, RXRα (one of the three RXR isoforms) (29Solomon C. White J.H. Kremer R. J. Clin. Investig. 1999; 103: 1729-1735Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) is phosphorylated by ERK, as are some of the VDR coactivators including SRC-1 (30Rowan B.G. Weigel N.L. O'Malley B.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4475-4483Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). To better understand the functional interactions between VDR and the ERK signaling pathway, we sought to determine whether 1,25-D activates ERK in the osteoblastic cell lines, MG-63 and MC3T3-E1, and to evaluate the effects of ERK on VDR activity. We found that 1,25-D rapidly induced ERK activity and that this activation persisted at 24 h in both cell lines. Surprisingly, the effects of ERK activation on VDR activity in the two cell lines were very different. Overexpression of Raf-1 (an upstream activator of ERK) reduced VDR activity in MC3T3-E1 cells, but stimulated activity in MG-63 cells. Similarly, inhibition of ERK by the MEK inhibitor U0126 stimulated VDR activity in MC3T3-E1 cells. However, it inhibited VDR activity in MG-63 cells as well as in HeLa cells, a cervical carcinoma cell line commonly utilized to study the functions of nuclear receptors. Although coactivators are targets of ERK signaling (30Rowan B.G. Weigel N.L. O'Malley B.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4475-4483Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 31Font de Mora J. Brown M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5041-5047Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar), the primary effect of U0126 in MC3T3-E1 cells appears to be enhancement of nuclear localization and DNA binding. An examination of the expression of the RXR isoforms revealed that MC3T3-E1 cells expressed lower levels of RXRβ and RXRγ than did either HeLa or MG-63 cells, suggesting that in MC3T3-E1 cells the VDR may be more dependent upon RXRα, an isoform whose activity is regulated by ERK (29Solomon C. White J.H. Kremer R. J. Clin. Investig. 1999; 103: 1729-1735Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Whereas U0126 somewhat increased total VDR expression in both MC3T3-E1 and HeLa cells, nuclear localization and DNA binding of VDR were substantially increased in MC3T3-E1 cells, but were minimally affected in HeLa cells. Although overexpression of RXRα in MC3T3-E1 cells increased VDR activity, U0126 further enhanced the activity. In contrast, overexpression of RXRγ stimulated VDR activity but abrogated the stimulation of activity by U0126. Thus, in cells in which RXRα is the dominant VDR partner, activation of ERK by 1,25-D reduces the activity of VDR, whereas in cells utilizing RXRβ or RXRγ, the activation of ERK enhances the activity of VDR.

Cell Culture—MG-63 (human osteoblastic osteosarcoma cell line), HeLa (human cervical carcinoma cell line), MC3T3-E1 (clonal osteoblastic cell line) and CV-1 (green monkey kidney cell line) cells from ATCC were plated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and 10% charcoal-stripped serum with penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen) at 200,000 cells per well in 6-well plates and at 1 million cells per 10-cm dish. For phospho-ERK Westerns, the cells were incubated for 72 h in serum-free medium to reduce the basal phosphorylation and then treated with vehicle or the indicated concentrations of 1,25-D. Basal levels of phospho-ERK were measured in cells incubated in DME supplemented with 10% charcoal-stripped serum for 2 days to mimic the level at the end of transfection studies. To differentiate MC3T3-E1 cells, the cells were plated at a density of 1.7 million cells per 10-cm dish in MEM and 10% serum with 10 mm β-glycerophosphate and 50 μg/ml ascorbic acid for 28 days. Medium was changed every third day. At the end of 25 days, the cells were plated in MEM and 10% charcoal-stripped serum and then treated as described in the figures. An increase in the basal alkaline phosphatase activity was taken as an indicator of differentiation. Transient Transfection—Transient transfection of the cells was carried out as described earlier using lysine-coupled inactivated adenovirus as non-covalent carriers of the plasmids (39Nazareth L.V. Weigel N.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19900-19907Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). For each well of a 6-well plate, the indicated amount of plasmid DNA was mixed with HEPES-buffered saline (0.15 m NaCl, 0.02 m HEPES, pH 7.2), and then incubated with 108 virus particles. Thirty minutes later, additional poly-l-lysine (1.3 μg of poly-l-lysine/μg DNA) was added to shrink the DNA on the surface of the virus. The virus-DNA complex mixture was added to cells and allowed to infect the cells for 2 h in medium lacking serum, following which the medium was supplemented with charcoal-stripped serum to a final concentration of 5%, and the infection was allowed to continue for 24 h. The cells were treated with hormone for an additional 24 h, harvested, and assays performed. Reporter Gene Assays—The cells were harvested by incubating in TEN (0.15 m NaCl, 0.01 m EDTA, 0.04 m Tris, pH. 8.0) at room temperature for 30 min. The cells were pelleted at 13,000 rpm for 30 s in an Eppendorf 5415C tabletop centrifuge. Protein from the pelleted cells was extracted with 1× reporter lysis buffer (Promega) containing 0.4 m NaCl for 30 min at room temperature. Luciferase assays were performed using the luciferase assay reagent from Promega Inc. and a Monolight 2010 Luminometer (Analytical Luminescence Lab, Ann Arbor, MI). The luciferase values were normalized to the total protein levels in the cells as measured by the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). Chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) assays were performed as described earlier (40Zhang Y. Bai W. Allgood V.E. Weigel N.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 577-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) and normalized to total cellular protein. Determination of Alkaline Phosphatase Activity—The cells were rinsed once in 1× phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and then scraped in PBS. The cells were then pelleted for 30 s at 13,000 rpm at 4 °C. The cell pellets were suspended in 250 mm Tris (pH 7.5) containing protease inhibitors (1 μg/ml leupeptin, antipain, aprotinin, benzamidine HCl, chymostatin, and pepstatin) and lysed by three cycles of freeze-thaw. The lysates were centrifuged, and the supernatant was assayed for alkaline phosphatase activity (41Bowers Jr., G.N. McComb R.B. Clin. Chem. 1966; 12: 70-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar) using an alkaline phosphatase kit from Sigma. Western Analysis—The cells were rinsed once with cold PBS and then scraped in PBS. The cells were then pelleted and extracted in lysis buffer (homogenization buffer: 0.05 m potassium phosphate pH 7.5, 10 mm sodium molybdate, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, and 0.05% monothioglycerol, protease inhibitors (1 μg/ml aprotinin, leupeptin, antipain, benzamidine HCl, pepstatin), 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mm sodium vanadate) by three freeze thaw cycles. If the protein extracts that were used for reporter gene assays were also subjected to Western analysis, the proteins were extracted in 1× lysis buffer with 0.4 m NaCl to extract the nuclear proteins. The cell debris was pelleted, and protein levels were measured by the Bradford assay. Equal amounts of protein extracts were run on a polyacrylamide gel, and the proteins were transferred overnight to nitrocellulose at 150 mA. After transfer, the membrane was blocked in 1% milk in TBST (1× TBS (Tris-buffered saline: 10 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.5) and 0.1% Tween 20) for 1 h for RXR isoforms and actin Westerns or incubated in 4 m urea for 3 h at room temperature for VDR or pERK Westerns. The blots were washed three times in 1× TBST 5 min per wash and then incubated with the primary antibody in 1% milk in 1× TBST overnight at 4 °C. The blots were washed, then incubated for 2 h at room temperature with a rabbit anti-rat antibody (Zymed Laboratories Inc. Inc. San Francisco, CA) in 1% BSA in 1× TBST for VDR Westerns and with a rabbit anti-mouse antibody (Zymed Laboratories Inc. Inc.) in 1% BSA in 1× TBST for pERK or actin Westerns. The blots were washed as described above and the VDR, actin, pERK, and the RXR blots were incubated in an anti-rabbit horse-radish peroxidase-tagged antibody (Amersham Biosciences) in 1× TBST for 1 h. The blots were washed as described above, and the signals were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). SRC-1 and DRIP205 Westerns were performed by incubating the blots in 5% milk in 1× TBST overnight at 4 °C. The blots were then incubated with the primary antibody for 2 h at room temperature, washed as indicated above, and incubated with the anti-rabbit horse-radish peroxidase antibody for 1 h at room temperature. The blots were washed, and the signals detected by enhanced chemiluminescence as described above. Nuclear Extract Preparation—Nuclear extracts were prepared from MC3T3-E1 or HeLa cells treated with 20 μm U0126, 10 nm 1,25-D, a combination of U0126 and 1,25-D, or with vehicle for 24 h, as described earlier (42Liu Y.Y. Nguyen C. Peleg S. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 1776-1787Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were washed once with 1× PBS, scraped into 10 ml of PBS, centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C, and resuspended in 1 ml of PBS. After centrifuging at 4000 rpm for 35 s at 4 °C, the cells were resuspended in 300 μl of buffer A (10 mm HEPES pH 7.9, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, and 0.5 mm dithiothreitol). After incubating for 10 min on ice to allow swelling, the cells were homogenized with 6 strokes of a Dounce homogenizer and centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 45 s at 4 °C. The nuclear pellets were gently resuspended in 50-80 μl of buffer C (20 mm HEPES pH 7.9, 400 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 25% glycerol, and 0.5 mm dithiothreitol), and homogenized with 8-10 strokes of the Dounce homogenizer. After 30 min of incubation on ice, the homogenates were centrifuged at 4500 rpm for 1 min at 4 °C. The nuclear extracts (supernatants) were aliquoted, frozen immediately in a dry ice/ethanol bath, and stored at -80 °C for further analysis. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—EMSAs were performed as previously described (43MacDonald P.N. Dowd D.R. Nakajima S. Galligan M.A. Reeder M.C. Haussler C.A. Ozato K. Haussler M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5907-5917Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Binding reactions contained 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 60 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 4% glycerol, 100 μg/ml BSA, 25 ng of poly(dI-dC)·poly(dI-dC) (Amersham Biosciences) as a nonspecific competitor, 10,000 cpm of 5′-end-labeled DNA (0.003-0.01 ng), and 3.75 μg of nuclear extract in a final volume of 25 μl. Some binding reactions were carried out in the presence of an anti-VDR antibody (Affinity Bioreagents; concentration 1 μg/μl), which was preincubated with nuclear extract in the presence of binding buffer for 20 min at 25 °C. Nonspecific competitor and probe DNA were then added, and incubation was carried out for a further 40 min. The binding reactions were fractionated through a native 5% polyacrylamide gel (29% acrylamide, 1% bis-acrylamide in 0.5× TBE), which was autoradiographed with an intensifying screen at -70 °C. The vitamin D response element of the mouse osteopontin gene (VDREmop) was used as the end-labeled DNA probe. The sequence of the upper strand is shown; the underlined sequences represent the two-hexanucleotide motifs from the mouse osteopontin gene VDRE: VDREmop 760-AGAGCAACAAGGTTCACGAGGTTCACGTCTC-730. Processing of Cells for Deconvolution Microscopy—All steps were performed at room temperature according to the protocol described earlier (44Stenoien D.L. Mancini M.G. Patel K. Allegretto E.A. Smith C.L. Mancini M.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 518-534PubMed Google Scholar). The cells were plated on coverslips at 200,000 cells per well in a 6-well dish in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% stripped serum. After treatment, the cells were fixed in 4% formaldehyde (Polysciences Inc., Warrington, PA) in PEM buffer (80 mm potassium PIPES, pH 7.5, 5 mm EGTA, and 2 mm MgCl2) for 30 min. The cells were then washed three times (5 min per wash) in PEM buffer and incubated for 10 min in 0.1 m ammonium chloride to quench autofluorescence. The cells were then washed two times (5 min per wash) in PEM buffer and incubated in PEM and 0.5% Triton X-100 for 30 min to permeabilize the cells. After washing three times with PEM buffer, the cells were blocked with 5% milk in TBST for 30 min and incubated with the VDR antibody (0.5 μg/ml) in blocking solution for 1 h. The cells were then washed three times (5 min per wash) in TBST and incubated with goat anti-rat Alexa fluor 498 antibody (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) for 1 h at room temperature. The cells were washed and fixed again as described above and were counterstained for 1 min with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) (1 μg/ml) in TBST and mounted in Slow Fade reagent (Molecular Probes, Inc.). Deconvolution Microscopy—Deconvolution microscopy was performed on the processed and mounted coverslips with a Zeiss AxioVert S100 TV microscope (Carl Zeiss, Thornwood, NY) and a Delta Vision Restoration Microscopy System (Applied Precision, Inc.). A Z-series of focal planes were digitally imaged and deconvolved with the Delta Vision constrained iterative algorithm to generate high resolution images (44Stenoien D.L. Mancini M.G. Patel K. Allegretto E.A. Smith C.L. Mancini M.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 518-534PubMed Google Scholar). A total of 200 cells were counted, and percent cells with VDR distributed between nucleus and cytoplasm was determined and expressed in the form of a table. RNA Isolation and Northern Hybridization—Total RNA was isolated from MG-63 and MC3T3-E1 cells using TRIzol (Invitrogen Life Technologies). Twenty micrograms of total RNA was separated by 6.65% formaldehyde-1% agarose gel electrophoresis transferred to a nylon membrane (Hybond N+, Amersham Biosciences), ultraviolet cross-linked, and then hybridized to labeled DNA probes for collagen I-α1 (from the ATCC). Denatured probes were labeled with [32P]dCTP (Amersham Biosciences) at 37 °C for 15 min using a Random Prime Labeling kit (Roche Applied Science). The membranes were prehybridized for 3 h at 65 °C and hybridized with the prepared probe overnight at 65 °C in Church hybridization solution (7% SDS, 1% BSA, 0.001 m EDTA, and 0.5 m sodium phosphate, pH 7). The blots were washed for 30 min each twice at 37 °C, once at 65 °C for 30 min with wash buffer (1% SDS, 0.05 m sodium phosphate, pH 7, 0.01 m EDTA), and then exposed to film. The message levels were quantified using a Storm 860 PhosphorImager equipped with Imagequant software (Molecular Dynamics, Piscataway, NJ). Real Time Reverse Transcriptase PCR Analysis—The RNA from MG-63 cells was diluted 100-fold for 24-hydroxylase RT-PCR. Since 24-hydroxylase expression was very low in MC3T3-E1 cells, the RNA from MC3T3-E1 cells was used directly without dilution. RNA from MG-63 and MC3T3-E1 cells were diluted 1500-fold for 18 S ribosomal RNA detection. The message was analyzed using real time-PCR (ABI PRISM 7700 sequence detector, Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) using one step real time RT-PCR mix (Applied Biosystems) with TaqMan primers and probes for 24-hydroxylase (human 24-hydroxylase: forward primer, CCCAGCGGCTGGAGATC; reverse primer, CCGTAGCCTTCTTTGCGG; probe, AACCGTGGAAGGCCTATCGCGACT; mouse 24-hydroxylase: forward primer, TCATTGCGGCCATCAAAAC; reverse primer, TTGGTGTTGAGGCGCTTGT; probe, ATGAGCACATTTGGGAAGATGATGGTGA from BIOSOURCE International, Denver, CO), and a Taqman primer probe set for 18 S rRNA from Applied Biosystems. The RT-PCR was performed under the conditions of 48 °C for 30 min, 95 °C for 10 min, and 40 cycles of 60 °C for 1 min. All experiments were performed at least three times. The ALP and transient transfection assays were performed in triplicate each time. The ALP, collagen I-α1, and 24-hydroxylase levels were statistically analyzed by one-way analysis of variance and when significance was revealed (p < 0.05), a Holm Sidak post-hoc test was done to identify differences between the groups using Sigma"
https://openalex.org/W2035907837,"Most newly synthesized peroxisomal matrix proteins are transported to the organelle by Pex5p, a remarkable multidomain protein involved in an intricate network of transient protein-protein interactions. Presently, our knowledge regarding the structure/function of amino acid residues 118 to the very last residue of mammalian Pex5p is quite vast. Indeed, the cargo-protein receptor domain as well as the binding sites for several peroxins have all been mapped to this region of Pex5p. In contrast, structural/functional data regarding the first 117 amino acid residues of Pex5p are still scarce. Here we show that a truncated Pex5p lacking the first 110 amino acid residues (ΔN110-Pex5p) displays exactly the peroxisomal import properties of the full-length peroxin implying that this N-terminal domain is involved neither in cargo-protein binding nor in the docking/translocation step of the Pex5p-cargo protein complex at the peroxisomal membrane. However, the ATP-dependent export step of ΔN110-Pex5p from the peroxisomal membrane is completely blocked, a phenomenon that was also observed for a Pex5p version lacking just the first 17 amino acid residues but not for a truncated protein comprising amino acid residues 1–324 of Pex5p. By exploring the unique properties of ΔN110-Pex5p, the effect of temperature on the import/export kinetics of Pex5p was characterized. Our data indicate that the export step of Pex5p from the peroxisomal compartment (in contrast with its insertion into the organelle membrane) is highly dependent on the temperature."
https://openalex.org/W2029523161,"It has been reported that interleukin-8 (IL-8) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression is regulated by peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-γ synthetic ligands. We have shown previously that cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2) is able to activate gene expression through PPAR-γ response elements (Pawliczak, R., Han, C., Huang, X. L., Demetris, A. J., Shelhamer, J. H., and Wu, T. (2002) J. Biol. Chem. 277, 33153–33163). In this study we investigated the influence of cPLA2 and secreted phospholipase A2 (sPLA2) Group IIA, Group V, and Group X on IL-8 and COX-2 expression in human lung epithelial cells (A549 cells). We also studied the results of cPLA2 activation by epidermal growth factor (EGF) and calcium ionophore (A23187) on IL-8 and COX-2 reporter gene activity, mRNA level, and protein synthesis. cPLA2 overexpression and activation increased both IL-8 and COX-2 reporter gene activity. Overexpression and activation of Group IIA, Group V, or Group X sPLA2s did not increase IL-8 and COX-2 reporter gene activity. Methyl arachidonyl fluorophosphate, a cPLA2 inhibitor, inhibited the effect of A23187 and of EGF on both IL-8 and COX-2 reporter gene activity, steady state levels of IL-8 and COX-2 mRNA, and IL-8 and COX-2 protein expression. Small inhibitory RNAs directed against PPAR-γ1 and -γ2 blunted the effect of A23187 and of EGF on IL-8 and COX-2 protein expression. Moreover small inhibitory RNAs directed against cPLA2 decreased the effect of A23187 and EGF on IL-8 and COX-2 protein expression. These results demonstrate that cPLA2 has an influence on IL-8 and COX 2 gene and protein expression at least in part through PPAR-γ.

Upon activation by various stimuli (including but not limited to calcium ionophore (A23187), IL-1β, tumor necrosis factor-α, and interferon-γ) cPLA2 is translocated to the cellular membranes, releasing arachidonic acid from membrane phospholipids (1Wu T.

EGF is also thought to increase cytosolic phospholipase A2 activity through activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway and phosphorylation of cPLA2 at serine 505 (and possibly other serine residues) (5Pawliczak R.

Both stimuli are known to increase cPLA2 enzymatic activity and arachidonate release. PLA2 enzymes catalyze the hydrolysis of membrane glycerophospholipids to liberate arachidonic acid and lysophospholipids. So far, more than 20 enzymes that possess PLA2 activity have been identified and cloned in mammals (for reviews, see Refs. 8Kudo I. Murakami M.

PLA2s have been classified according to their molecular weight, homology, and calcium influence on enzyme activity. cPLA2 appears to play a role in intracellular arachidonate release, whereas low molecular weight PLA2s (such as Groups IA, IB, IIA, IIC, and V) may be involved in extracellular arachidonic acid release due to the fact that they are secreted into extracellular milieu upon cell stimulation. Thus, there may be distinct roles or cross-talk between PLA2s in cell signaling (16Balsinde J. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6758-6765Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar, 17Balboa M.A. Perez R. Balsinde J. J.

Several lines of evidence (for a review, see Ref. 18Balsinde J. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16069-16072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar) suggest that the Group VI iPLA2 may be responsible for phospholipid fatty acid remodeling in resting cells. The role of iPLA2 in intracellular cell signaling remains to be clarified. IL-8 is a chemokine that is produced and secreted by human lung cells (19Benfield T.L. van Steenwijk R. Nielsen T.L.

Moreover IL-8 is an important proinflammatory cytokine that plays a role in allergic inflammation. The IL-8 promoter contains a PPAR-γ response element localized to –1060 relative to the transcription start site, suggesting that PPAR-γ may play a role in regulation of IL-8 transcription. It has been reported that several PPAR-γ agonists such as troglitazone, rosiglitazone, and others activate IL-8 transcription and enhanced IL-8 secretion in many cell systems including but not limited to lung cells (21Zhang X.

COX-1 is a housekeeping gene constitutively expressed in most human cells. COX-2 is a highly inducible cyclooxygenase isoform.

As mentioned cPLA2 activation might increase expression of genes containing PPRE in promoter regions. This hypothesis has been proved using an artificial reporter gene as described elsewhere (4Pawliczak R. Han C. Huang X.L. Demetris A.J. Shelhamer J.H. Wu T. J. Biol.

The purpose of this study was to investigate whether Group IVA cPLA2 and other phospholipases (such as secreted phospholipase A2 Group IIA, V, or X) might influence IL-8 and COX-2 gene and protein expression in human lung cells. Materials—A549 cells, a human adenocarcinoma cell line, were obtained from ATTC (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) and were grown in Ham's F-12K medium (BIOSOURCE) with 10% fetal bovine serum (BIOSOURCE) and 2 mm of l-Glutamine (BIOSOURCE). All experiments were performed when cells were 80–90% confluent. Methyl arachidonyl fluorophosphate (MAFP) was obtained from Calbiochem. Bromoenol lactone (BEL), an iPLA2 inhibitor, and thioetheramide-PC, an sPLA2 inhibitor, were purchased from Cayman Chemicals (Ann Arbor, MI). Transient Transfection Assay—The cPLA2 overexpression plasmid was obtained from Drs. J. D. Clark and J. L. Knopf at the Genetics Institute, Boston, MA (22Jozkowicz A. Dulak J. Prager M.

The COX-2 reporter gene was a kind gift from Dr. Stephen Prescott (24Harris S.G. Smith R.S. Phipps R.P. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 1372-1379Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). A plasmid with β-galactosidase gene driven by a CMV promoter was obtained from Clontech. A549 cells were transfected with 1.5 μg of reporter gene (IL-8 or COX-2) and 1.5 μg of expression vector. 0.2 μgof β-galactosidase/CMV plasmid was added as a control for transfection efficiency. Cells were transfected in 6-well dishes (PGS Scientific, Bethesda, MD) using LipofectAMINE Plus reagent (Invitrogen) for 4 h in serum-free Ham's F-12K medium (containing 2 mm l-glutamine). After transfection, medium was replaced with standard Ham's F-12K medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and cells were maintained for 16 h. After exposure to cPLA2 or sPLA2 activators as described below, cells were washed three times in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed using Passive Lysis Buffer (Promega, Madison, WI). Cell lysate was frozen at –80 °C. Luciferase activity was measured using a luciferase assay system (Promega) with a Turner TD20 luminometer (Promega). β-Galactosidase was measured using a Beta-Gal enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (Roche Applied Science). Immunoblotting—A549 cells were grown on 6-well dishes and treated with 1 μm calcium ionophore A23187 (Calbiochem) for 8 h. In experiments involving cPLA2 or sPLA2 inhibitors, the inhibitors were added to medium (at the specified concentration) for 2 h before the experiments and maintained throughout the time of exposure to calcium ionophore or EGF. The vehicle, Me2SO or methyl acetate, was added to control cultures. Cells were harvested with trypsin (E-PET, Biofluids, Rockville, MD), scraped, collected, and washed three times with cold 1× phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were transferred to 0.5 ml of homogenization buffer containing 50 mm Hepes (pH 8.0), 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 100 μm leupeptin, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mm soybean trypsin inhibitor, 15 mm aprotinin, and 0.25% Triton X-100. Cells were sonicated three times for 15 s and centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 5 min. Total protein of the cell lysate was assayed by BCA reagent (Pierce). Samples containing 20 μg of crude cell lysate protein were separated on 8 or 11% Tris-glycine gels (Invitrogen) using 1× Tris-glycine SDS running buffer. The separated proteins were electrophoretically transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (Invitrogen). The membranes were then blocked using 5% nonfat dry milk with 0.1% Tween 20 for 2 h at room temperature. Protein expression was detected by using a 1:1000 dilution of rabbit anti-human PPAR-γ1 or -γ2 antibody or a 1:200 dilution of rabbit anti-human COX-2 antibody (Cayman Chemical) and a 1:1000 dilution of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated mouse anti-rabbit IgG as the second antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratory, Inc., West Grove, PA). The blot was developed using the ECL Western blotting detection system (Amersham Biosciences) and exposed to Eastman Kodak MR radiographic film for 1 min. Arachidonic Acid Release from A549 Cells—Whole cell arachidonic acid release was performed as described previously (4Pawliczak R. Han C. Huang X.L. Demetris A.J. Shelhamer J.H. Wu T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33153-33163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Briefly cells grown in 6-well dishes were transfected with expression vector or empty vector as described above. After 4 h, medium was changed, and cells were labeled for 16 h with 1 μCi/ml [5,6,8,9,11,12,14,15-3H]arachidonic acid ([3H]arachidonic acid) (214 Ci/mmol) (Amersham Biosciences) in Ham's F-12K medium with 10% fetal bovine serum. Subsequently cells were washed and treated with or without IL-1β. At the end of the 4-h treatment period, medium was harvested and centrifuged at 1000 × g for 5 min. An aliquot of medium was transferred to scintillation vials containing 10 ml of Bio-Safe II scintillation fluid (Research International Products Inc., Mount Prospect, IL) and counted in an LS 6500 scintillation counter (Beckman). Gene Expression Measurements Using a Real Time Polymerase Chain Reaction—Cells were grown as described above and exposed to EGF, A23187, or MAFP. Total RNA was isolated using an RNeasy kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). IL-8 and COX-2 expression was measured using a real time PCR mRNA quantification using a TaqMan system (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). COX-2 probe and primer sets were obtained from Synthegen (Houston, TX). To measure COX-2 mRNA expression, the following primer sequences were used based on mRNA sequence (GenBank™ accession number U04636): forward primer, 5′-GCTCAAACATGATGTTTGCATTC-3′; reverse primer, 5′-GCTGGCCCTCGCTTATGA-3′; probe sequence, 5′-TGCCCAGCACTTCACGCATCAGTT-3′. Commercially available probe and primer sets from Applied Biosystems were used to measure IL-8 and RNase P1 expression. 1 μg of total RNA was reverse transcribed using a reverse transcription kit from Applied Biosystems. Real time polymerase chain reaction was conducted using an Applied Biosystems kit and run on a 7900HT instrument (Applied Biosystems) according to the manufacturer's manual using RNase P1 gene as a standard. Relative gene expression is presented as a -fold induction as compared with control ± S.E. Transfection of A549 Cells with Small Inhibitory RNA (siRNA) Directed against PPAR-γ—siRNAs targeting bases 4–23 of the PPAR-γ1 and 4–24 of the PPAR-γ2 coding sequences were obtained from Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA). Untemplated TTs were added to the 3′-end of each strand. The siRNA sequences were 5′-GUUGACACAGGAUGCCAUUTT-3′ (PPAR-γ1) and 5′-GGUGAAACUCUGGGAGAUUCTT-3′ (PPAR-γ2). The single-stranded siRNAs were annealed by incubating a 100 mm concentration of each single strand in annealing buffer (100 mm potassium acetate, 30 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 2 mm magnesium acetate) for 2 min at 90 °C and slowly cooled down to room temperature. Cells grown in 6-well plates were transfected with 100 nm siRNA duplexes using LipofectAMINE reagent (Invitrogen) (5 ml in 1 ml of culture medium) for 5 h. After transfection, medium was changed, and cells were maintained in medium with fetal bovine serum for 16 h. The effect of siRNA on PPAR-γ1 and -γ2 protein expression was assessed by immunoblotting as described above. Cells were then treated with or without A23187 or EGF as specified below. The effect of treatment of cells with siRNA duplexes on IL-8 protein levels was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay of cellular supernatants and for COX-2 protein expression by immunoblotting of cell lysates. Transfection of A549 Cells with siRNA Directed against cPLA2— RNA-DNA chimeras were synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies. The sequence used to generate 100 nmol of siRNA duplex was: 5′-AAC UCU AGG GAC AGC AAC AUU TT; the complementary sequence was 5′-AAU GUU GCU GUC CCU AGA GUU TT, which corresponds to bases 299–319 of the cPLA2 coding sequence (GenBank™ accession number M68874). The annealing procedure was performed as described above. Medium (Ham's F-12 with glutamine) was incubated with LipofectAMINE (5 μl/ml) (Invitrogen) with or without siRNA duplex (final concentration, 20 nm) for 20 min at room temperature. Cells were treated for 5 h at 37 °C. Medium was then changed to Ham's F-12 with glutamine and fetal bovine serum, and the cells were incubated an additional 72 h. Cell lysate was collected for cPLA2 Western blots. The remaining cells were incubated for 8 h with medium alone, A23187(10–6m), or EGF (20 ng/ml). Medium was collected for IL-8 assay by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and cell lysate was collected for COX-2 and cPLA2 Western blots. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—PPRE probes were synthesized by Keystone Laboratories (Camarillo, CA) corresponding to PPRE sequences (underlined) present in the COX-2 (5′-GAGGCGACAGGTCATAACCCTACT-3′) and IL-8 promoters (5′-GGGTCCTCAGAGGTCAGACTTGGTGT-3′). The inverted PPRE sequence in the COX-2 promoter is at –3599 to –3573 relative to the transcription start site and is present as bases of –3542 to –3565 in GenBank™ accession number AF044206. The IL-8 PPRE sequence represents bases –1070 to –1045 relative to the transcription start site and is present as bases 412–437 of GenBank™ accession number M28130. Single-stranded nucleotides were reannealed by heating to 95 °C for 5 min and cooled down slowly to room temperature. A549 cells were incubated with and without A23187 (10–6m) or EGF (10 ng/ml) for 30 min, 1 h, and 2 h prior to harvest at the 2-h time point. Nuclear extracts were prepared using a nuclear extraction kit according to the manufacturer's directions (Sigma). DNA binding was performed by incubating 3 μg of nuclear protein in a total volume of 10 μl of binding buffer (50 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.05 μg/μl poly(dI-dC)·poly(dI-dC), 15% glycerol) and 10,000 cpm 32P-labeled double-stranded PPRE probes for 20 min at room temperature. The specificity of protein binding to labeled probe was assessed by competition with unlabeled probe or with PPRE consensus sequence. For the competition experiments, a 100× excess of unlabeled probe or PPRE consensus sequence (CAAAACTAGGTCAAAGGTCA) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) was added to the electrophoretic mobility shift assay mixture. Nuclear protein derived from cells exposed to A23187 (1 μm) for 60 min was utilized for these experiments. Protein-DNA complexes were resolved on a 6% DNA retardation gel (Invitrogen) in 0.5× Tris-borate-EDTA buffer at 200 V for 30 min. The dried gel was exposed to x-ray film (Kodak) with an intensifying screen at –70 °C overnight or until adequate signal was developed. An Amersham Biosciences 301 computing densitometer was used to digitize images. Statistical Analysis—Statistical analysis was performed using Microsoft Excel 2000 (Redmond, WA) software run on an iMAC computer (Apple, Cupertino, CA). Comparisons were performed using two-tailed unpaired Student's t tests. Values of p < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. The Influence of cPLA2 Activation on IL-8 and COX-2 mRNA Levels—Real time polymerase chain reaction was used to study change in steady state levels of IL-8 and COX-2 mRNA after treatment. Calcium ionophore A23187 and EGF increased both IL-8 and COX-2 mRNA levels as shown in Fig. 1, A and B. Treatment with the calcium ionophore A23187 resulted in an increase in IL-8 and COX-2 mRNA levels. The increase in the IL-8 transcript was present even after 24 h. By this time, the COX-2 mRNA levels had returned to control levels (Fig. 1A). EGF treatment of A549 cells also resulted in an increase in steady state mRNA levels for both IL-8 and COX-2. This effect was transient for COX-2 and disappeared after 2 h. IL-8 mRNA levels were still increased at the 24-h time point (Fig. 1B). These effects were in part decreased by MAFP as shown in Fig. 1, C and D. The Influence of cPLA2 Activation on IL-8 Reporter Gene Activity: the Effect of MAFP, a cPLA2 Inhibitor—To test whether cPLA2 overexpression might induce IL-8 transcription, a reporter gene assay was used. Cells were transfected with an IL-8 reporter gene and cotransfected with a cPLA2 expression vector or empty vector. Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were exposed for 4 h to culture medium with Me2SO, A23187 (10–6m), or EGF (20 ng/ml) to activate cPLA2. cPLA2 overexpression induced an increase in IL-8 reporter gene activity as shown on Fig. 2A. When transfected cells were stimulated by A23187 (10–6m) for 4 h, IL-8 reporter gene activity was increased as compared with cells treated with Me2SO (A23187 vehicle). These results suggest that both cPLA2 activation and cPLA2 overexpression and activation induce IL-8 reporter gene activity. Further cPLA2 activation induced by EGF caused a similar effect on IL-8 reporter gene activity (Fig. 2B). The effect of cPLA2 activation (either by A23187 or EGF) was in part inhibited by preincubation with a specific cPLA2 inhibitor, MAFP (10 μm), as shown in Fig. 2, A and B. The Influence of cPLA2 Activation on COX-2 Reporter Gene Activity: the Effect of MAFP, a cPLA2 Inhibitor—Similar experiments were performed to test the hypothesis that cPLA2 overexpression might induce COX-2 transcription. cPLA2 overexpression induced an increase of COX-2 reporter gene activity as shown on Fig. 2C. When transfected cells were stimulated with A23187 (10–6m) for 4 h, COX-2 reporter gene activity was increased compared with cells treated with Me2SO (A23187 vehicle). These data suggest that both cPLA2 activation and cPLA2 overexpression and activation induce COX-2 reporter gene activity. Furthermore treatment of cells with EGF produced a similar effect on COX-2 reporter gene activity. The effect of EGF was also in part inhibited by preincubation with a specific cPLA2 inhibitor, MAFP (10 μm), as shown on Fig. 2D. The Influence of sPLA2 Group IIA, sPLA2 Group V, and sPLA2 Group X Activation on IL-8 and COX-2 Reporter Gene Activity—cPLA2 is not the only phospholipase A2 expressed in human lung cells. Therefore, we used vectors overexpressing sPLA2 Group IIA, Group V, and Group X proteins and tested whether overexpression of these enzymes might influence IL-8 and COX-2 reporter gene activity. IL-1β is known to induce the release of sPLA2 from the cells to the medium. This process is associated with an increase in sPLA2 enzyme activity in the extracellular space, activated by the calcium levels present in the medium. Previously we have shown that transfection of cells with an sPLA2 Group IIA expression vector induces an increase in arachidonic acid release (4Pawliczak R. Han C. Huang X.L. Demetris A.J. Shelhamer J.H. Wu T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33153-33163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In Fig. 3, A and B, we present evidence that transfection of cells with sPLA2 Group V or Group X vectors, respectively, results in increased arachidonate release compared with cells transfected with empty vectors. These data suggest that these vectors produce functionally active proteins enhancing arachidonate release. Fig. 4, A, B, and C, demonstrate the lack of activation of IL-8 reporter gene in cells transfected with expression vectors encoding sPLA2 Group IIA, V, or X. In all three cases, an increase in sPLA2 activity is associated with a decrease in IL-8 reporter gene activity suggesting the possibility of an inhibitory effect of secreted phospholipase products on IL-8 transcription. Fig. 5, A, B, and C, demonstrate the influence of sPLA2 activation on COX-2 reporter gene activity. Transfection of cells with expression vectors encoding for Group IIA, V, or X isoforms of secreted phospholipases A2 did not activate COX-2"
https://openalex.org/W2155132585,"Oncogenic ras activates multiple signaling pathways to enforce cell proliferation in tumor cells. The ERK1/2 mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway is required for the transforming effects of ras, and its activation is often sufficient to convey mitogenic stimulation. However, in some settings oncogenic ras triggers a permanent cell cycle arrest with features of cellular senescence. How the Ras/ERK1/2 pathway activates different cellular programs is not well understood. Here we show that ERK1/2 localize predominantly in the cytoplasm during ras-induced senescence. This cytoplasmic localization seems to be dependent on an active nuclear export mechanism and can be rescued by the viral oncoprotein E1A. Consistent with this hypothesis, we showed that E1A dramatically down-regulated the expression of the ERK1/2 nuclear export factor PEA-15. Also, RNA interference against PEA-15 restored the nuclear localization of phospho-ERK1/2 in Ras-expressing primary murine embryo fibroblasts and stimulated their escape from senescence. Because senescence prevents the transforming effect of oncogenic ras, our results suggest a tumor suppressor function for PEA-15 that operates by means of controlling the localization of phospho-ERK1/2.

Normal organisms keep stable cell numbers by regulating the process of cell proliferation and cell death. Cancer cells bypass these controls because of multiple genetic and epigenetic alterations that block the action of cell proliferation inhibitors or mimic growth factor activation (1Hanahan D. Weinberg R.A. Cell. 2000; 100: 57-70Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22406) Google Scholar). Fortunately, several fail-safe mechanisms have evolved to prevent the expansion of cells threatened by oncogenic stimuli. For example, the myc oncogene induces abnormal cell proliferation but promotes cell death as well (1Hanahan D. Weinberg R.A. Cell. 2000; 100: 57-70Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22406) Google Scholar, 2Evan G.I. Vousden K.H. Nature. 2001; 411: 342-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (2711) Google Scholar). Also, oncogenic ras leads to a permanent cell cycle arrest with features of cellular senescence (3Serrano M. Lin A.W. McCurrach M.E. Beach D. Lowe S.W. Cell. 1997; 88: 593-602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3965) Google Scholar). Tumor formation is therefore very much stimulated by the inactivation of key mediators of the apoptosis and senescence programs such as p53 and the Rb 1The abbreviations used are: Rb, retinoblastoma protein; BrdUrd, bromodeoxyuridine; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; ERK2*, ERK2-L73P, S151D; MAP, mitogen-activated protein; MEK, MAP kinase/ERK kinase; GST, glutathione S-transferase; MEF, mouse embryo fibroblast; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PML, promyelocytic leukemia; RNAi, RNA interference; shRNA, short hairpin RNA; SA-β-gal, senescence-associated β-galactosidase. tumor suppressor proteins (1Hanahan D.

Nature. 2001; 411: 342-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (2711) Google Scholar). The induction of a senescent cell cycle arrest by oncogenic ras in normal fibroblasts contrasts with the well known mitogenic effects of Ras and the MAP kinase pathway in multiple cell lines and transgenic animals (4Johnson G.L. Lapadat R. Science. 2002; 298: 1911-1912Crossref PubMed Scopus (3511) Google Scholar). Endogenous Ras proteins are required for cell proliferation (5Stacey D.W. Tsai M.H. Yu C.L. Smith J.K. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1988; 53: 871-881Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and Ras activation is part of the response to growth factors during normal development (6Kayne P.S. Sternberg P.W. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1995; 5: 38-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In addition, constitutively active oncogenic alleles of ras are often found in human tumors (7Barbacid M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 779-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (3778) Google Scholar) where they convey mitogenic signals. To explain this apparent paradox, it was proposed that normal cells interpret aberrant mitogenic signaling by activating a p53- and Rb-dependent senescence program that is absent in most tumor cell lines (3Serrano M. Lin A.W. McCurrach M.E. Beach D. Lowe S.W. Cell. 1997; 88: 593-602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3965) Google Scholar). Another explanation is that the ERK1/2 MAP kinase pathway activates different cellular programs depending on the strength and duration of its stimulation. For example, sustained activation of the ERK1/2 MAP kinase pathway by constitutively active Ras or nerve growth factor triggers growth arrest and differentiation in the PC12 pheochromocytoma cell line (8Bar-Sagi D. Feramisco J.R. Cell. 1985; 42: 841-848Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). In contrast, a transient activation of ERK1/2 by epidermal growth factor induces cell proliferation (8Bar-Sagi D. Feramisco J.R. Cell. 1985; 42: 841-848Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). To date, we do not know whether induction of senescence in normal fibroblasts by constitutive Ras activation involves sustained and strong ERK1/2 activity. As a matter of fact, it is equally possible that these cells activate feedback mechanisms to counteract constitutive Ras activation, blocking the mitogenic activity of the ERK1/2 MAP kinase cascade. Here we report that constitutive Ras expression in IMR90 fibroblasts induced a senescent cell cycle arrest accompanied by a sustained phosphorylation of ERK1/2. Shortly after the introduction of oncogenic ras, ERK1/2 were phosphorylated and translocated to the nucleus. Upon establishment of the senescent phenotype, ERKs remained phosphorylated but relocalized to the cytoplasm. Blocking the senescent response to Ras by the viral oncoprotein E1A restored the nuclear localization of ERK1/2 normally observed in growing cells. The ERK nuclear export factor PEA-15 seems to be required for this relocalization of ERK and, in agreement, PEA-15 levels were reduced by E1A. Also, RNAi-mediated inactivation of PEA-15 in mouse fibroblasts rescued them from Ras-induced senescence. Hence, limiting ERK nuclear localization by PEA-15 keeps the aberrant mitogenic activity of oncogenic ras and the ERK1/2 pathway under control. Cells and Retroviruses—Normal human diploid fibroblast IMR90 cells (American Type Culture Collection) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone, Logan, Utah) and 1% penicillin G/streptomycin sulfate (Invitrogen). Primary mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) were obtained from 13.5-day-old embryos as described (9Spector D.L. Goldman R.D. Leinwand L.A. Cells: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1998: 8.4-8.8Google Scholar). The retroviruses pBabe, pBabeRas, pLPC, pLPCE1A, pWZL, and pWZLRas were described previously (10Ferbeyre G. de Stanchina E. Querido E. Baptiste N. Prives C. Lowe S.W. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2015-2027Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). pBabeERK was constructed as follows. ERK2-L73P, S151D (abbreviated ERK2*) was obtained from pCMVERK2* (11Emrick M.A. Hoofnagle A.N. Miller A.S. Ten Eyck L.F. Ahn N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46469-46479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) by XbaI and partial EcoRI digestion, blunted with Klenow, and ligated into the SnaBI site of pBabe. Retroviral-mediated gene transfer was performed as described previously (10Ferbeyre G. de Stanchina E. Querido E. Baptiste N. Prives C. Lowe S.W. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2015-2027Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). RNA Hairpins Trigger RNA Interference—To construct the gene cassettes that express RNA hairpins (shRNAs) from the U6 polymerase III promoter, we used shagging-PCR as described (cshl.org/public/SCIENCE/hannon.html). shRNAs (primers are available upon request) were designed against nucleotide locations 1–29 and 295–324 of the mouse PEA-15 mRNA sequence (GenBank™ accession number NM_011063) with the computer-assisted RNAi Oligo Retriever program (cshl.org/public/SCIENCE/hannon.html). The common upstream primer U6-BglII (5′-TCTGCCAGATCTGATTTAGGTGACACTATAG3-′), complementary to a region upstream of the U6 promoter on the pGEMU6 plasmid (N. Hernandez, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory), was used to amplify a PCR cassette containing the U6 promoter, a target-specific hairpin sequence, the Pol-III terminator, and two terminally placed restriction sites (BglII and EcoRI) for convenient directional cloning. The resulting 400-bp PCR product was cloned between the BglII and EcoRI sites of the retroviral vector pMSCVpuro (Clontech). Cell Proliferation and Senescence Determination—To determine cell proliferation rates we used a BrdUrd incorporation assay as described (10Ferbeyre G. de Stanchina E. Querido E. Baptiste N. Prives C. Lowe S.W. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2015-2027Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Senescence was scored by determining the percentage of the population exhibiting a senescence-associated β-galactosidase (SA-β-gal) activity (12Dimri G.P. Lee X. Basile G. Acosta M. Scott G. Roskelley C. Medrano E.E. Linskens M. Rubelj I. Pereira-Smith O. Peacocke M. Campisi J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9363-9367Crossref PubMed Scopus (5738) Google Scholar). Senescence Rescue Assay—Primary MEFs were co-infected with the retroviral vector pBabe or its derivative expressing oncogenic ras and with pMSCV or its derivatives expressing anti-PEA-15 RNA hairpins. Two days after double selection (2 μg/μl puromycin for 3 days and 75 μg/μl hygromycin for 5 days), all populations expressing oncogenic ras entered senescence, whereas the control cells remained growing for one additional week (two passages) and then entered into senescence induced by culture shock (13Sherr C.J. DePinho R.A. Cell. 2000; 102: 407-410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar). We kept all of these cells for another 2 weeks in subconfluent cultures, changing media every 3 days. We used morphological criteria and the SA-β-gal assay to evaluate whether the cells remained senescent or resumed proliferation. Protein Expression—To prepare total cell protein, cells were collected by trypsinization, washed with PBS, lysed in 100 μl of SDS sample buffer (60 mm Tris-HCl pH 6.8, 10% glycerol, 2% SDS, and 5% 2-mercaptoethanol), and boiled for 5 min. For Western blots, 20 μg of total cell protein were separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore). The primary antibodies used were anti-pRb (G3–245, 1:250; BD Biosciences), anti-p53 (CM5, 1:2000; Novocastra), anti-mouse PML (36-1-104, 1:5000; a gift from S. Lowe), anti-phosphoserine 259 Raf, anti-phospho-MEK1/2, anti-phospho ERK1/2, anti-phospho-p90Rsk, anti-phospho-Elk1 (Phospho-ERK1/2 Pathway sampler kit, all used 1:500; Cell Signaling), anti-total ERK (K-23. 1:1000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-PEA-15 (1:1000, kindly provided by Dr J. Ramos, Rutgers University), and anti-α-tubulin (B-5–1-2, 1:5000; Sigma). Signals were revealed after incubation with anti-mouse or anti-rabbit secondary antibodies coupled to peroxidase (Amersham Biosciences) by using enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Biosciences) or Lumi-Light Plus (Roche Applied Science). ERK1/2 kinase assays were performed according to an immunoprecipitation/kinase assay (Cell Signaling Technologies Inc.) using 5 μg of GST-Elk1 as substrate. Phosphorylated GST-Elk1 was detected by Western blot using the anti-phospho-Elk1 (Ser-383) antibody (Cell Signaling). Fluorescence Microscopy—For fluorescence microscopy, 2 × 104 control IMR90 cells or Ras-senescent IMR90 cells were plated on coverslips placed on 12-well plates (Costar, Corning Inc.). Twenty-four hours after plating, the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature. Subsequently, the cells were washed in PBS and permeabilized using ice-cold 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS/bovine serum albumin solution for 5 min. Then the cells were washed three times with PBS/bovine serum albumin and incubated for 1 h at room temperature with anti-phospho-ERK1/2 (9106, 1:300; Cell Signaling); anti-p53 (CM5, 1:50, Novocastra), or anti-mouse PML (36-1-104, 1:200) as primary antibodies. Next, the cells were washed and incubated for 1 h with Oregon-Green-conjugated secondary antibody (1:1000; Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) or (Alexa 568 anti-mouse, 1:2000; Molecular Probes). Finally, the cells were washed three times with PBS, incubated in 300 nm 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole for 10 min, and mounted on microscope slides. Images were obtained using MetaMorph software (Universal Imaging Corp.) and processed using Adobe Photoshop 6.0. For studying ERK localization in MEFs, cells were first serum-starved for 48 h and later fixed at different times after adding serum. The staining and image processing was as described above. Oncogenic ras Induces a Constitutive Stimulation of the MAP Kinase Pathway—It is known that both proliferation and senescence induced by oncogenic ras (RasV12) require signaling through the ERK1/2 MAP kinases (14Lin A.W. Barradas M. Stone J.C. van Aelst L. Serrano M. Lowe S.W. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2997-3007Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Zhu J. Woods D. McMahon M. Bishop J.M. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3008-3019Crossref PubMed Scopus (766) Google Scholar). However, MAP kinase signaling is the subject of a negative feedback regulation by the ERK1/2-dependent induction of specific phosphatases that dephosphorylate ERK1/2 (16Brondello J.M. Brunet A. Pouyssegur J. McKenzie F.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1368-1376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar, 17Sun H. Charles C.H. Lau L.F. Tonks N.K. Cell. 1993; 75: 487-493Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1027) Google Scholar). In particular, it has been reported that the levels of MKP-2 are increased after the induction of cellular senescence by serial passage (replicative senescence) (18Torres C. Francis M.K. Lorenzini A.

Consequently, it is possible that cell cycle exit in response to oncogenic ras in primary fibroblasts is due to these feedback signals mediated by protein phosphatases. To test this idea, we infected human diploid fibroblast IMR90 cells with a retrovirus expressing oncogenic ras and a vector control. As shown previously (3Serrano M. Lin A.W. McCurrach M.E. Beach D. Lowe S.W. Cell. 1997; 88: 593-602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3965) Google Scholar, 10Ferbeyre G. de Stanchina E. Querido E. Baptiste N. Prives C. Lowe S.W.

Biol. 2002; 22: 3497-3508Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar), Ras-expressing cells entered a permanent cell cycle arrest with features of cellular senescence (Fig 1, A and B). To verify whether ERK1/2 remained active during Ras-induced senescence or whether their activity is down-regulated by dephosphorylation, we performed a series of immunoblots with antibodies recognizing phosphorylated forms of ERK1/2, their upstream regulators (Raf and MEK1/2), and two of their substrates (Elk-1 and p90Rsk). The results of such an analysis are presented in Fig. 1C. In Ras-expressing cells, all members of the ERK1/2 pathway downstream of Ras displayed a pattern of phosphorylation consistent with constitutive signaling. Interestingly, the downstream target of Ras, Raf, was dephosphorylated at Ser-259 in cells expressing oncogenic ras. Phosphorylation of Raf at this residue is considered to inhibit its activity (20Dhillon A.S. Pollock C. Steen H. Shaw P.E. Mischak H. Kolch W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 3237-3246Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Whether oncogenic ras mediates this dephosphorylation by activating a phosphatase or inhibiting a protein kinase requires further study. We concluded that the MAP kinases ERK1/2 remained active and phosphorylated both at the beginning of the senescent arrest induced by Ras (4 days after infection) and when the senescent arrest was well established (10 days after infection). Clearly, exit from the cell cycle in response to oncogenic ras is not the result of inactivation of the ERK1/2 pathway by dephosphorylation. Constitutive Expression of Activated ERK Is Not Sufficient to Induce Senescence—Senescence can also be induced in primary fibroblasts by activated alleles of Raf and MEK, which, like Ras, activate ERK1/2 (14Lin A.W. Barradas M. Stone J.C. van Aelst L. Serrano M. Lowe S.W. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2997-3007Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Zhu J. Woods D. McMahon M. Bishop J.M. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3008-3019Crossref PubMed Scopus (766) Google Scholar). Because we showed that all the members of the Ras-ERK1/2 signal transduction cascade (Ras, Raf, MEK, and ERK1/2) are constitutively active during Ras-induced senescence, we decided to investigate whether an activated ERK2 allele also induces senescence. To do this experiment we used the constitutively active ERK2* described by Ahn and colleagues (11Emrick M.A. Hoofnagle A.N. Miller A.S. Ten Eyck L.F. Ahn N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46469-46479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). This allele bears mutations that enhance the rate of autophosphorylation of ERK2 at Thr-183 and Tyr-185, which are the sites phosphorylated by the ERK activators MEK1/2. More importantly, expression of this constitutively active ERK2 allele in human embryonic kidney cells (293) led to phosphorylation of the ERK substrates Elk1 and Rsk as efficiently as does a constitutively active MEK1 allele (11Emrick M.A. Hoofnagle A.N. Miller A.S. Ten Eyck L.F. Ahn N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46469-46479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, activated ERK2* did not induce senescence (Fig 1, A and B) despite activating Rsk to a similar extent as Ras did (Fig. 1D). We also performed immunoprecipitation/kinase assays, using an excess of GST-Elk1 as a substrate. In this experiment, phospho-ERK, immunoprecipitated from ERK2*-expressing cells was as active as the phospho-ERK1/2 immunoprecipitated from control cells growing in serum or RasV12-expressing cells (Fig. 1E). Together, our results are consistent with those reported before about this ERK2* allele (11Emrick M.A. Hoofnagle A.N. Miller A.S. Ten Eyck L.F. Ahn N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46469-46479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). However, we can not entirely eliminate the possibility that the two mutations present in ERK2* impair its interactions with key substrates that mediate cell cycle arrest. Alternatively, ERK2* and RasV12-activated ERK1/2 may differ in some other functions of the ERK1/2 MAP kinase pathway. Phosphorylated ERKs Localized Predominantly to the Cytoplasm during Ras-induced Senescence—To further investigate ERK physiology during senescence and explain why activated Ras, Raf, or MEK but not ERK induced senescence, we performed localization studies by indirect immunofluorescence using antibodies specific for phosphorylated ERK1/2. We found that phosphorylated ERK1/2 (phospho-ERK) localized both in the in the nucleus and in the cytoplasm early after introducing oncogenic ras in primary fibroblasts, when cells are highly proliferative (Fig. 2). The same pattern of staining was observed for control cells bearing an empty vector. This situation is the result of the steady state equilibrium of ERK shuttling between the nucleus and the cytoplasm (21Brunet A. Roux D. Lenormand P. Dowd S. Keyse S. Pouyssegur J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 664-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). However, by the time cells entered senescence (6 days after the introduction of Ras), a significant number of cells (∼60%) displayed phospho-ERK mainly in the cytoplasm, apparently excluding the nucleus and often forming a perinuclear halo (Fig. 2). In contrast, the constitutively active ERK2*, which failed to induce senescence, was found predominantly localized in the nucleus (Fig. 2). In addition, blocking Ras-induced senescence with the adenoviral oncoprotein E1A was accompanied by a dramatic enrichment of phospho-ERK1/2 in the nucleus. A similar pattern of staining was also observed in cells that were serum-starved and then serum-stimulated (Fig. 2). Thus, senescence strongly correlated with the nuclear exclusion of phospho-ERK1/2. We then treated Ras-senescent cells with the CRM1 (chromosome region maintenance 1) inhibitor leptomycin B, which blocks nuclear export. We reasoned that this drug should relocalize ERK to the nucleus in Ras-senescent cells if an active export mechanism was responsible for the observed cytoplasmic ERK localization. The results, shown in Fig. 3, indicate that leptomycin B induced the relocalization of phospho-ERK1/2 to the nucleus of Ras-senescent cells. The data are consistent with a model in which phospho-ERK1/2 freely enter the nucleus followed by an active export to the cytoplasm during Ras-induced senescence. However, it is also plausible that an ERK1/2-anchoring protein required nuclear export to localize in the cytoplasm and was therefore able to retain ERK1/2 in this cellular compartment. E1A Inhibits Ras-induced Senescence in Human Cells and Blocks the Expression of the ERK Export Factor PEA-15—Ras-induced senescence in human cells can be efficiently bypassed by the oncoprotein E1A from the adenovirus (3Serrano M. Lin A.W. McCurrach M.E. Beach D. Lowe S.W. Cell. 1997; 88: 593-602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3965) Google Scholar, 10Ferbeyre G. de Stanchina E. Querido E. Baptiste N. Prives C. Lowe S.W. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2015-2027Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). E1A has multiple activities, including inhibition of the Rb and p53 tumor suppressors (22Lill N.L. Grossman S.R. Ginsberg D. DeCaprio J. Livingston D.M. Nature. 1997; 387: 823-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar, 23Whyte P. Buchkovich K.J. Horowitz J.M. Friend S.H. Raybuck M. Weinberg R.A. Harlow E. Nature. 1988; 334: 124-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (1038) Google Scholar, 24Whyte P. Williamson N.M. Harlow E. Cell. 1989; 56: 67-75Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar). However, inhibition of Rb and p53, using the oncoproteins E6 and E7 from human papillomavirus, did not rescue the cell cycle arrest induced by oncogenic ras in primary human fibroblasts (25Mallette F.A. Goumard S. Gaumont-Leclerc M.F. Moiseeva O. Ferbeyre G. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 91-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), nor did it prevent ERK localization in the cytoplasm (not shown). Obviously, additional E1A targets are responsible for maintaining Ras-induced cell cycle arrest and ERK localization in the cytoplasm. One attractive hypothesis is that E1A affects proteins responsible for cytoplasmic localization of ERK1/2. Hence, E1A can be used as a tool to discover the mechanism responsible for cytoplasmic ERK localization in senescent cells. We asked whether E1A targets factors known to mediate ERK nuclear export. An obvious candidate was PEA-15, recently characterized as an ERK nuclear export factor (26Formstecher E. Ramos J.W. Fauquet M. Calderwood D.A. Hsieh J.C. Canton B. Nguyen X.T. Barnier J.V. Camonis J. Ginsberg M.H. Chneiweiss H. Dev. Cell. 2001; 1: 239-250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). PEA-15 binds ERK1/2 in the nucleus and uses CRM1-mediated nuclear export to localize them to the cytoplasm. Accordingly, PEA-15 null cells displayed increased cell proliferation and constitutive localization of ERK in the nucleus (26Formstecher E. Ramos J.W. Fauquet M. Calderwood D.A. Hsieh J.C. Canton B. Nguyen X.T. Barnier J.V. Camonis J. Ginsberg M.H. Chneiweiss H. Dev. Cell. 2001; 1: 239-250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Interestingly, E1A inhibited Ras-induced senescence (Fig 4, A and B) and dramatically reduced the expression of PEA-15 in human fibroblasts (Fig 4C). This finding suggested that PEA-15 could control ERK localization during Ras-induced senescence. RNAi-mediated Inactivation of PEA-15, an ERK1/2 Nuclear Export Factor, Rescued Primary Murine Embryo Fibroblasts from Ras-induced Senescence—To confirm a role for PEA-15 in cytoplasmic ERK localization during Ras-induced senescence, we blocked its expression using RNAi. To induce RNAi, we designed two retroviral vectors that express RNA hairpins with complementary sequences for mouse PEA-15 (Fig. 5A). Cells expressing one of these hairpins showed reduction of PEA-15 expression 2 days after infection (Fig. 5B). More importantly, although these cells entered into Ras-induced senescence, many of them escaped senescence, forming foci of highly proliferative cells that can be established as permanent, immortalized cultures. This ability to escape senescence induced by PEA-15 RNAi was scored in four independent experiments using four different MEF isolates. In contrast, cells with the non-functional hairpin or cells with an empty vector used as a control rarely did so (Fig. 5C). In MEFs, Ras-induced senescence depends on p53 functions and the induction of p53 targets genes such as PML (3Serrano M. Lin A.W. McCurrach M.E. Beach D. Lowe S.W. Cell. 1997; 88: 593-602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3965) Google Scholar, 27de Stanchina E. Querido E. Narita M. Davuluri R.V. Pandolfi P.P. Ferbeyre G. Lowe S.W. Mol. Cell. 2004; 13: 523-535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). We used immunofluorescence and immunoblots to evaluate the status of p53 and PML at day 10 after infection. By this time, all cells expressing oncogenic ras were arrested and senescent, whereas cells expressing oncogenic ras and the anti-PEA-15 hairpin were divided into two populations, one of senescent cells and one of small cells that escaped senescence. Cells with the vector controls or with the anti-PEA-15 hairpin alone were also in senescence due to culture shock (13Sherr C.J. DePinho R.A. Cell. 2000; 102: 407-410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar). All cell populations expressed p53 and PML immunoreactive material, but the strongest signal was found in cells expressing oncogenic ras alone. Blocking PEA-15 by RNA interference reduced p53 and PML levels in Ras-expressing cells to the levels seen in cells with vector alone (Fig. 5, D and E). This reduction was observed in all cells of the population (senescent and non-senescent), and, therefore, it was not a consequence of escaping senescence. Thus, escape from senescence of cells expressing an anti-PEA-15 RNA hairpin was not due to mutations that result in a loss of p53 expression. Altogether, our data suggest that PEA-15 is required to connect signals from oncogenic ras to p53 and maintain the state of senescence. To investigate whether blocking PEA-15 by RNAi would increase the nuclear localization of ERK1/2, we studied ERK1/2 localization in cells expressing oncogenic ras or oncogenic ras plus the anti-PEA-15 hairpin. For this experiment we used cells at day 10 after infection. To limit the effects that the cell cycle and cell proliferation may have on ERK localization, we serum-starved the cells for 48 h, added serum for 1 h, and then fixed the cells for immunofluorescence. As shown previously, most cells expressing oncogenic ras alone displayed a cytoplasmic staining for phospho-ERK1/2. This finding is consistent with reports indicating that senescent cells do not respond to serum stimulation (28Meyyappan M. Atadja P.W. Riabowol K.T. Biol. Signals. 1996; 5: 130-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). However, more than half of the cells expressing the anti-PEA-15 hairpin exhibited a predominant nuclear staining of phospho-ERK1/2 (Fig. 6B). Hence, rescuing senescence by blocking PEA-15 expression correlates very well with an increase in the nuclear localization of phopho-ERK1/2. To further characterize how blocking PEA-15 functions affects ERK localization, we developed a kinetic protocol to look for ERK nuclear export in cells expressing oncogenic ras alone or with an anti-PEA-15 RNA hairpin. Again, we used cells at day 10 after infection and treated them with leptomycin B to allow for nuclear accumulation of ERK1/2. Then we studied ERK localization at different times after the withdrawal of leptomycin B. In cells expressing oncogenic ras alone, ERK quickly moved out of the nucleus to accumulate in the cytoplasm. In cells expressing oncogenic ras and the anti-PEA-15 hairpin, ERKs were retained for a longer time in the nucleus. One hour after the withdrawal of leptomycin B, ERK1/2 was found both in the nucleus and in the cytoplasm (Fig. 7). Similar results were obtained with an anti-ERK1/2 antibody that recognizes non-phosphorylated ERK1/2. The main conclusion from this experiment is that PEA-15 plays an important role in controlling the nuclear export of phospho-ERK1/2. However, because ERK1/2 still manage to exit the nucleus in cells with very low levels of PEA-15, other factors might regulate ERK1/2 nuclear localization as well. The ERK1/2 MAP kinase pathway conveys mitogenic signals from growth factor receptors. However, this pathway also mediates a senescent cell cycle arrest in normal fibroblasts expressing oncogenic ras (3Serrano M. Lin A.W. McCurrach M.E. Beach D. Lowe S.W. Cell. 1997; 88: 593-602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3965) Google Scholar) or in cells from transgenic mice that age prematurely due to expression of a short isoform of the p53 tumor suppressor protein (29Maier B. Gluba W. Bernier B. Turner T. Mohammad K. Guise T. Sutherland A. Thorner M. Scrable H. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 306-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). Here we present evidence indicating that the localization of ERK1/2 distinguishes mitogenic signaling from senescence. First, ERK1/2 localize mainly in the cytoplasm of senescent cells. Second, the viral oncoprotein E1A, which blocks Ras-induced senescence and stimulates transformation, prevents the cytoplasmic localization of ERK1/2. Third, E1A inhibits the expression of the ERK1/2 export factor PEA-15. Finally, RNAi-mediated inhibition of PEA-15 stimulated the escape from senescence in mouse fibroblasts expressing oncogenic ras and reduced the levels of p53 induced by oncogenic ras. In quiescent cells, ERK1/2 are normally localized in the cytoplasm. Upon stimulation by growth factors, ERK1/2 are phosphorylated by MEK (MAPKK), which induces their translocation to the nucleus (30Lenormand P. Brondello J.M. Brunet A. Pouyssegur J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 625-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that MEK acts as a cytoplasmic anchor for inactive ERK1/2 and that their interaction is disrupted after phosphorylation of ERK1/2 by MEK, allowing the nuclear import of ERK1/2 (31Adachi M. Fukuda M. Nishida E. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5347-5358Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). However, we think it is unlikely that MEK anchors ERK1/2 in senescent cells. MEK and ERK1/2 remained constitutively phosphorylated during Ras-induced senescence and, therefore, were unable to form stable complexes in these cells. Cytoplasmic accumulation of phosphorylated ERKs was observed in cells stimulated with angiotensin II and treated with protein kinase C inhibitors (32Seta K. Nanamori M. Modrall J.G. Neubig R.R. Sadoshima J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9268-9277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Interestingly, upon treatment with leptomycin B, ERK1/2 nuclear localization was restored (32Seta K. Nanamori M. Modrall J.G. Neubig R.R. Sadoshima J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9268-9277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). These observations are consistent with a model in which ERK1/2 are translocated to the nucleus after MEK-dependent phosphorylation and exported to the cytoplasm via CRM1 by a factor normally inhibited by protein kinase C activity. Intriguingly, PEA-15 is phosphorylated by protein kinase C (26Formstecher E. Ramos J.W. Fauquet M. Calderwood D.A. Hsieh J.C. Canton B. Nguyen X.T. Barnier J.V. Camonis J. Ginsberg M.H. Chneiweiss H. Dev. Cell. 2001; 1: 239-250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar), suggesting that it might be the protein kinase C-sensitive factor that controls ERK localization. Consistent with this idea, we have shown here that PEA-15 is required for ERK-nuclear export and for maintaining Ras-induced senescence. Also, the ability of E1A to block senescence correlated with a dramatic reduction of PEA-15 levels. The factors controlling ERK localization are, for the most part, still unknown. In addition to nuclear export, several studies have indicated that ERKs can be retained in specific compartments by anchoring proteins. For example, the β-arrestins have been implicated in mediating a cytoplasmic sequestration of ERK1/2 (33Tohgo A. Pierce K.L. Choy E.W. Lefkowitz R.J. Luttrell L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9429-9436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar), and unidentified nuclear anchoring proteins may sequester ERKs in the nucleus (34Pouyssegur J. Volmat V. Lenormand P. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2002; 64: 755-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). For these reasons, it is not a surprise that knocking out PEA-15 expression in our experiments did not block entirely the process of ERK nuclear export or the ability of primary MEFs to enter oncogenic ras-induced senescence. Genetically, MEFs with low PEA-15 levels behaved similarly to MEFs null for the candidate tumor suppressor Mnt. Mnt is a Max-interacting transcriptional repressor that suppresses Myc-dependent transactivation. Mnt null MEFs, like PEA-15-disabled MEFs, arrested proliferation in response to oncogenic ras but frequently escaped from senescence (35Hurlin P.J. Zhou Z.Q. Toyo-oka K. Ota S. Walker W.L. Hirotsune S. Wynshaw-Boris A. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 4584-4596Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Mnt-induced immortalization paralleled with inhibition of the expression of Myc target genes, including CDK4 (35Hurlin P.J. Zhou Z.Q. Toyo-oka K. Ota S. Walker W.L. Hirotsune S. Wynshaw-Boris A. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 4584-4596Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), confirming the well known role of myc as an immortalizing oncogene (36Land H. Parada L.F. Weinberg R.A. Nature. 1983; 304: 596-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1963) Google Scholar). Whether PEA-15 or cytosolic ERK1/2 stimulate Mnt functions or block Myc activity requires further study. A defective accumulation of ERK1/2 in the nucleus was reported previously in cells that entered senescence after serial passage (37Lim I.K. Won Hong K. Kwak I.H. Yoon G. Park S.C. Mech. Ageing Dev. 2000; 119: 113-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 38Tresini M. Lorenzini A. Frisoni L. Allen R.G. Cristofalo V.J. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 269: 287-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) or the introduction of oncogenic ras (37Lim I.K. Won Hong K. Kwak I.H. Yoon G. Park S.C. Mech. Ageing Dev. 2000; 119: 113-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In the study described by Park and colleagues, the reduction in nuclear ERK was accompanied by the nuclear accumulation of actin and Racl proteins and a marked induction of RhoA expression (37Lim I.K. Won Hong K. Kwak I.H. Yoon G. Park S.C. Mech. Ageing Dev. 2000; 119: 113-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). To explain their observations, they suggested that senescent cells have a general defect in protein translocation across the nuclear membrane. This argument is in apparent conflict with our model proposing normal nuclear import followed by the active export of ERK1/2 from the nucleus by PEA-15. On the other hand, our results are entirely consistent with the idea proposed by both groups (37Lim I.K. Won Hong K. Kwak I.H. Yoon G. Park S.C. Mech. Ageing Dev. 2000; 119: 113-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 38Tresini M. Lorenzini A. Frisoni L. Allen R.G. Cristofalo V.J. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 269: 287-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) that a failure to accumulate ERK in the nucleus explains the lack of response to proliferative stimuli exhibited by senescence cells. It remains to be investigated whether cytoplasmic ERK signaling plays a role in senescence or cell cycle control. Our work has important implications for the understanding of the interplay between factors supporting the transforming effect of oncogenic ras and factors that oppose it. It is well established that tumor suppressor pathways controlled by Rb, p53, and PML block Ras-dependent transformation via the establishment of a senescent cell cycle arrest (3Serrano M. Lin A.W. McCurrach M.E. Beach D. Lowe S.W. Cell. 1997; 88: 593-602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3965) Google Scholar, 10Ferbeyre G. de Stanchina E. Querido E. Baptiste N. Prives C. Lowe S.W.

It is also well known that cellular transformation involves the suppression of the senescence program by different oncogenic activities (42Hahn W.C. Counter C.M. Lundberg A.S. Beijersbergen R.L. Brooks M.W. Weinberg R.A. Nature. 1999; 400: 464-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (1982) Google Scholar, 43Hahn W.C. Dessain S.K. Brooks M.W. King J.E. Elenbaas B. Sabatini D.M. DeCaprio J.A. Weinberg R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 2111-2123Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). One particularly powerful anti-senescence oncogene is the adenoviral oncoprotein E1A (3Serrano M. Lin A.W. McCurrach M.E. Beach D. Lowe S.W. Cell. 1997; 88: 593-602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3965) Google Scholar, 10Ferbeyre G. de Stanchina E. Querido E. Baptiste N. Prives C. Lowe S.W. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2015-2027Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Unlike other oncoproteins such as papillomavirus E6/E7, E1A is sufficient to rescue normal fibroblasts from Ras-induced arrest (25Mallette F.A. Goumard S. Gaumont-Leclerc M.F. Moiseeva O. Ferbeyre G. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 91-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). E1A, like E6, blocks the transcriptional activity of p53 (22Lill N.L. Grossman S.R. Ginsberg D. DeCaprio J. Livingston D.M. Nature. 1997; 387: 823-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar) and, like E7, binds Rb blocking its ability to repress E2F-dependent promoters (23Whyte P. Buchkovich K.J. Horowitz J.M. Friend S.H. Raybuck M. Weinberg R.A. Harlow E. Nature. 1988; 334: 124-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (1038) Google Scholar, 24Whyte P. Williamson N.M. Harlow E.

Clearly, therefore, it would seem that E1A must have other activities conferring its unique ability to block Ras-induced senescence. Our data suggest that this new E1A activity results in down-regulation of the ERK1/2 nuclear export factor PEA-15. Thus, PEA-15 is an E1A-modulated gene that normally provides a fail-safe mechanism to avoid constitutive activation of the MAP kinase pathway. As a consequence, we predict that PEA-15 may have a tumor suppressor activity, particularly, in tumors driven by oncogenic ras. We thank Dr. Joe Ramos, Dr. Athena Lin, Alice Rae, and Frédérick A.

https://openalex.org/W2011064041,"Fructosamine 3-kinase (FN3K) and FN3K-related protein (FN3K-RP) catalyze the phosphorylation of the Amadori products ribulosamines, psicosamines, and, in the case of FN3K, fructosamines. BLAST searches in chordate genomes revealed two genes encoding proteins homologous to FN3K or FN3K-RP in various mammals and in chicken but only one gene, encoding a protein more similar to FN3K-RP than to FN3K, in fishes and the sea squirt Ciona intestinalis. This suggests that a gene duplication event occurred after the fish radiation and that the FN3K gene evolved more rapidly than the FN3K-RP gene. In agreement with this distribution, only one enzyme, phosphorylating ribulosamines and psicosamines but not fructosamines, was found in the tissues from a fish (Clarias gariepinus), whereas two enzymes with specificities similar to either FN3K or FN3K-RP were found in mouse, rat, and chicken tissues. FN3K is particularly active in brain, heart, kidney, and skeletal muscle. Its activity is also relatively elevated in erythrocytes from man, rat, and mouse but barely detectable in erythrocytes from chicken and pig, which correlates well with the low intracellular concentration of glucose in erythrocytes from these species. This is in keeping with the specific role of FN3K to repair protein damage caused by glucose. FN3K-RP was more evenly distributed in tissues, except for skeletal muscle where its activity was particularly low. This may be related to low activity of the pentose phosphate pathway in this tissue, as suggested by assays of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase. This finding, together with the high affinity of FN3K-RP for ribulosamines, suggests that this enzyme may serve to repair damage caused by the powerful glycating agent, ribose 5-phosphate. Fructosamine 3-kinase (FN3K) and FN3K-related protein (FN3K-RP) catalyze the phosphorylation of the Amadori products ribulosamines, psicosamines, and, in the case of FN3K, fructosamines. BLAST searches in chordate genomes revealed two genes encoding proteins homologous to FN3K or FN3K-RP in various mammals and in chicken but only one gene, encoding a protein more similar to FN3K-RP than to FN3K, in fishes and the sea squirt Ciona intestinalis. This suggests that a gene duplication event occurred after the fish radiation and that the FN3K gene evolved more rapidly than the FN3K-RP gene. In agreement with this distribution, only one enzyme, phosphorylating ribulosamines and psicosamines but not fructosamines, was found in the tissues from a fish (Clarias gariepinus), whereas two enzymes with specificities similar to either FN3K or FN3K-RP were found in mouse, rat, and chicken tissues. FN3K is particularly active in brain, heart, kidney, and skeletal muscle. Its activity is also relatively elevated in erythrocytes from man, rat, and mouse but barely detectable in erythrocytes from chicken and pig, which correlates well with the low intracellular concentration of glucose in erythrocytes from these species. This is in keeping with the specific role of FN3K to repair protein damage caused by glucose. FN3K-RP was more evenly distributed in tissues, except for skeletal muscle where its activity was particularly low. This may be related to low activity of the pentose phosphate pathway in this tissue, as suggested by assays of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase. This finding, together with the high affinity of FN3K-RP for ribulosamines, suggests that this enzyme may serve to repair damage caused by the powerful glycating agent, ribose 5-phosphate. Fructosamine 3-kinase (FN3K) 1The abbreviations used are: FN3K, fructosamine 3-kinase; FN3K-RP, fructosamine 3-kinase-related protein; DMF, 1-deoxy-1-morpholino-fructose; DMR, 1-deoxy-1-morpholinoribulose; DTT, dithiothreitol; contig, group of overlapping clones. and fructosamine 3-kinase-related protein (FN3K-RP) are two recently described mammalian enzymes that phosphorylate ketoamines on the third carbon of their sugar moiety (1Delpierre G. Vanstapel F. Stroobant V. Van Schaftingen E. Biochem. J. 2000; 352: 835-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 2Delpierre G. Rider M.H. Collard F. Stroobant V. Vanstapel F. Santos H.

Diabetes. 2003; 52: 2888-2895Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Ketoamines are produced through a spontaneous reaction of aldoses or aldose derivatives with an amine, followed by an Amadori rearrangement (5Hodge J.E. Adv. Carbohydr. Chem. 1955; 10: 169-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar, 6Baynes J.W. Watkins N.G. Fisher C.I. Hull C.J. Patrick J.S. Ahmed M.U. Dunn J.A. Thorpe S.R. Prog. Clin. Biol. Res. 1989; 304: 43-67PubMed Google Scholar). Both FN3K and FN3K-RP phosphorylate ribulosamines and psicosamines, the glycation products of ribose and allose, but only the former catalyzes the phosphorylation of fructosamines, which are derived from glucose and are well known to be formed in animal tissues. Phosphorylation of ketoamines on their third carbon leads to their destabilization and their spontaneous detachment from proteins with a half-life of the order of 6–8 h (fructosamines and psicosamines) or 25 min (ribulosamines) (3Szwergold B.S. Howell S. Beisswenger P.J. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 2139-2147Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 7Collard F. Wiame E. Bergans N. Fortpied J. Vertommen D. Vanstapel F. Delpierre G. Van Schaftingen E. Biochem. J. 2004; 382: 137-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). FN3K and FN3K-RP are therefore responsible for protein deglycation, a new variety of protein repair. Evidence for the involvement of FN3K in the removal of fructosamines from hemoglobin and of FN3K-RP in the removal of ribulosamines and psicosamines has been obtained by incubating erythrocytes in the presence of elevated concentrations of glucose, ribose, or allose with or without competitive inhibitors of the two enzymes (7Collard F. Wiame E. Bergans N. Fortpied J. Vertommen D. Vanstapel F. Delpierre G. Van Schaftingen E. Biochem. J. 2004; 382: 137-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 8Delpierre G. Collard F. Fortpied J. Van Schaftingen E. Biochem. J. 2002; 365: 801-808Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Of interest is the conclusion that fructosamines are removed from only some of the glycation sites of hemoglobin, apparently those that are most accessible to FN3K (9Delpierre G. Vertommen D. Communi D. Rider M.H. Van Schaftingen E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 27613-27620Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Many questions still remain about protein deglycation, most particularly about FN3K-RP. The origin of the substrates of this enzyme remains enigmatic, as there do not seem to be significant amounts of free ribose or allose in tissues, contrasting with the occurrence of concentrations of glucose in the millimolar range. The purpose of the present work was to study the species and tissular distributions of FN3K and FN3K-RP, as this could give some hint as to the function of these enzymes, most particularly FN3K-RP. As FN3K might prevent some damaging effects of glucose, it was also decided to test the effect of starvation and diabetes on the expression of this enzyme. Synthesis of Fructosamines—Radiolabeled 1-deoxy-1-morpholino-fructose (DMF) and 1-deoxy-1-morpholino-ribulose (DMR) were synthesized according to Refs. 1Delpierre G. Vanstapel F. Stroobant V. Van Schaftingen E. Biochem. J. 2000; 352: 835-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar and 4Collard F. Delpierre G. Stroobant V. Matthijs G. Van Schaftingen E. Diabetes. 2003; 52: 2888-2895Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, respectively. Lysozyme-bound osamines utilized for the measurement of activities were prepared as described (4Collard F. Delpierre G. Stroobant V. Matthijs G. Van Schaftingen E. Diabetes. 2003; 52: 2888-2895Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Unlabeled, low molecular weight osamines were either obtained from Sigma (DMF) or synthesized as described (fructoselysine, Ref. 8Delpierre G. Collard F. Fortpied J. Van Schaftingen E. Biochem. J. 2002; 365: 801-808Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and (psicoselysine, DMR, Ref. 4Collard F. Delpierre G. Stroobant V. Matthijs G. Van Schaftingen E. Diabetes. 2003; 52: 2888-2895Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Animal Handling—Male Wistar rats and NMRI mice were obtained from Charles River and fed on regular rodent laboratory pellets. Diabetes was induced in rats by a single injection of streptozotocin (75 mg/kg, diluted in 0.15 m NaCl). The fish (C. gariepinus), obtained from the Centre de Recherches et de Formation en Aquaculture, were bred at 28 °C. Partial Purification of FN3K and FN3K-RP from Animal Tissues— All purification steps were performed at 4 °C. Tissues were harvested on animals killed by decapitation (rat, chicken), vertebral dislocation (mouse), or stunning (fish). They were quick-frozen between Wollen-berger clamps cooled in liquid nitrogen and maintained at –70 °C until used. The frozen samples were homogenized in a Potter-Elvehjem device with 2 ml/g tissue of buffer A (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.1, 10 mm KCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 1mm dithiothreitol (DTT), and 1 μg/ml leupeptin/antipain). The homogenates were centrifuged for 15 min at 10,000 × g. Heparinized blood was centrifuged for 10 min at 2,000 × g, and the plasma and the buffy coat were discarded. The erythrocytes were washed twice with ice-cold 150 mm NaCl and kept at –70 °C until used. 1 volume of tissue extract or packed red blood cells was diluted with 2 volumes of buffer B (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.1, 1 mm DTT, 1 μg/ml leupeptin/antipain) and centrifuged for 15 min at 16,000 × g. The resulting supernatant (0.5 ml) was diluted in 1 ml of buffer B before application onto Blue-Sepharose columns (1 ml of wet gel for FN3K purification) or Blue Trisacryl columns (1 ml of wet gel for FN3K-RP purification) equilibrated with the same buffer. Blue-Sepharose columns were washed with 4 ml of buffer B, and retained proteins were eluted with buffer B supplemented with 500 mm NaCl and 1 mm ATP-Mg (5 fractions of 1 ml). In the case of the Blue Trisacryl columns, buffer B also contained 0.2 mm EDTA, and retained proteins were eluted with 500 mm NaCl (2 fractions of 1 ml) and then 1 m NaCl (5 fractions of 1 ml) without ATP-Mg. Protein in the extracts was measured with the method of Bradford (10Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217548) Google Scholar) with bovine γ globulin as a standard, except for erythrocytes where the method of Drabkin and Austie (11Drabkin D.L. Austie J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1935; 112: 51Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar) was used (Sigma). Measurement of Enzymatic Activity—All assays were carried out at 30 °C. For the assay of FN3K, the phosphorylation of [14C]DMF was assayed in the fractions of the Blue-Sepharose column as described (2Delpierre G. Rider M.H. Collard F. Stroobant V. Vanstapel F. Santos H. Van Schaftingen E. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 1627-1634Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) using anion-exchanger columns to separate DMF 3-phosphate from unreacted DMF. It was checked that no activity was present in the flow-through fractions of the Blue-Sepharose columns. The sum of the activities found in the fractions eluted with salt was used to compute FN3K activity. FN3K-RP was assayed in the fractions of the Blue Trisacryl column through the incorporation of 32P from [γ-32P]ATP in lysozyme glycated with allose. The assay mixture contained 25 mm Tris, pH 7.8, 1 mm EGTA, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 2.1 mg/ml glycated hen egg lysozyme (∼220 μm psicosamines), 20 mm DMF (to inhibit FN3K), and 100 μm ATP-Mg and 800,000 cpm [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Biosciences) in a final volume of 100 μl. Thirty μl of the reaction medium were spotted onto cation-exchanger papers (P81), which were washed three times with ice-cold 75 mm H3PO4, dried, and then mixed with scintillation liquid (OptimaGold; Packard) for radioactivity measurement. The sum of the activities found in the fractions eluted with salt from the Blue Trisacryl columns was used to compute the FN3K-RP activity. The phosphorylation of protein-bound fructosamines and ribulosamines was measured in a similar way in some experiments. The concentration of substrates was 250 μm protein-bound fructosamines and 450 μm protein-bound ribulosamines. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase activity was determined spectrophotometrically in a reaction mixture containing 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.1, 1 mm DTT, 10 mm KCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 250 μm NADP, and 250 μm glucose 6-phosphate. 6-Phosphogluconate dehydrogenase activity was determined in a reaction mixture containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.8, 1 mm DTT, 25 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 250 μm NADP, and 250 μm 6-phospho-gluconate. In both cases, the activity was calculated from the variation in A340 observed after the addition of the appropriate volume of tissue homogenate. RNA Extraction and Quantitative PCR—Total RNA was isolated from 0.5 g of frozen tissues from rats, using the Ambion RNA-WIZ kit. cDNA was synthesized by RT-PCR using oligo(dT) and Superscript II reverse transcriptase according to the manufacturer's instructions. Gene-specific primers were designed to generate PCR products of 75–150 bp from the FN3K and FN3K-RP mRNAs (FN3K Fwd, 5′-TGACGT-GCTTGTGCTTCA-3′; FN3K Rev., 5′-GTCTCTCGGTCAGCATAG-3′; FN3K-RP Fwd., 5′-TCCTGACCTGTTCCGTGAA T-3′; FN3K-RP Rev., 5′-GCCATAGAAGGATGCTGGAT-3′). One gene-specific primer was designed to detect the rat housekeeping gene β-actin (β-actin Fwd., 5′-AGAGGGAAATCGTGCGTGAC-3′; β-actin Rev., 5′-CGATAGTGAT-GACCTGACCGT-3′), which is constitutively expressed in rat tissues. Real-time PCR was performed using an icycler iQ system (Bio-Rad). The rate of accumulation of amplified DNA was measured by continuous monitoring of SYBR green I fluorescence. Sequence Reconstruction and Bioinformatics—For the phylogenetic analysis, sequences for most of the organisms were taken from the non-redundant TREMBL data base. The sequence from the FN3K homologs from C. intestinalis and Gallus gallus were reconstructed from the genomic DNA sequence (available at genome.jgi-psf.org/ciona and www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/seq/GgaBlast.html), taking into account the consensus sequences for splicing sites. All sequences were aligned using Clustal X (12Thompson J.D. Gibson T.J. Plewniak F. Jeanmougin F. Higgins D.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 24: 4876-4882Crossref Scopus (35620) Google Scholar). For the creation of a neighbor-joining tree, the “tree” option of the Clustal X program was used after exclusion of positions with gaps and with correction for multiple substitutions. For bootstrap analysis, 1000 samplings were carried out. For the creation of a maximum likelihood tree, the alignment was first transformed to the Phylip format after removal of all positions with gaps. This alignment was fed into the TreePuzzle program (13Strimmer K. von Haeseler A. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1996; 13: 964-969Crossref Scopus (2276) Google Scholar) using standard settings and the JTT matrix (14Jones D.T. Taylor W.R. Thornton J.M. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1992; 8: 275-282PubMed Google Scholar) as evolutionary model with analysis of 1000 quartet puzzling steps. Genomic Environment of the FN3K and FN3K-RP Sequences—BLAST searches in vertebrate genomes with the human and mouse FN3K and FN3K-RP sequences indicate that the human, mouse, and rat genomes contain two genes corresponding to FN3K-RP and FN3K (Fig. 1). These genes are in tandem repeat in the telomeric region of chromosomes 17q (man), 11q (mouse), and 10q (rat). The neighboring genes encode a putative GTPase of the Ras family (RAB40) on the centromeric side and tubulin-specific chaperone D on the telomeric side. A similar genomic arrangement is found in the chicken genome with, successively, the genes encoding FN3K-RP (as indicated by the fact that it showed more identity with mammalian FN3K-RPs, 78%, than with FN3Ks, 67%), FN3K, and tubulin-specific chaperone D. The sequence of the contig encoding these three genes (gi:44766232) is interrupted upstream of the FN3K-RP gene, preventing us from knowing the identity of the gene located 5′ to FN3K-RP. Only one copy of a FN3K/FN3K-RP homolog was found in the Fugu rubripes and zebra fish genomes; in both cases, the encoded protein showed more identity with FN3K-RP (69.9 and 69.3% with the human and mouse sequences, respectively) than with FN3K (60.0 and 60.8% sequence identity). In both cases, it was flanked by the tubulin-specific chaperone D gene on the 3′ side, as in the mammalian genomes. However, the 5′ flanking genes were different in the two fish genomes, encoding an ADP-ribosylation factor in F. rubripes and a reverse transcriptase in zebra fish. It should be added that there is no trace of FN3K-like sequences between the FN3K-RP and tubulin-specific chaperone D genes in the fish genomes. Sequence Comparisons and Evolutionary Tree—Fig. 2 shows an alignment of FN3K and FN3K-RPs from several vertebrates as well as from the urochordate C. intestinalis (a sea squirt). The sequences of chicken FN3K and FN3K-RP and that of C. intestinalis were reconstructed from genomic sequences and EST (chicken) sequences, taking into account the known consensus for splice sites. From such an alignment, in which the rat sequences were also included (not shown), an evolutionary tree (Fig. 3) could be reconstructed that suggests that the duplication of an ancestral FN3K-RP gene leading to mammalian and bird FN3Ks and FN3K-RPs may have occurred after the fish speciation. That the branches leading to FN3K (most particularly to the mammalian enzymes, see “Discussion”) are longer than to FN3K-RPs suggests that the rate of evolution was more rapid in the first case than in the latter case. The alignment suggests also that the following residues may be FN3K-specific: Phe-17, Ala-30, Gln-47, Arg-69, Tyr-113, Asn-126, Pro-165, His-171, Asp-183, Val-198, Asn-284, Pro-299, Leu-308. Intriguingly, the degree of identity of the last 60 residues of chicken FN3K is higher with chicken FN3K-RP (49/60 residues) than with mammalian FN3Ks (42 or 43/60 residues), suggesting a gene conversion event.Fig. 3Phylogenetic tree of FN3K and FN3K-RP sequences. The C. intestinalis sequence was used as an outgroup. Numbers at the nodes represent the support for each node as obtained by, respectively, 1000 quartet puzzling steps (maximum likelihood tree) or 1000 bootstrap samplings (neighbor-joining tree). The horizontal bar represents 10 accepted amino acid changes/100 residues.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) As previously reported, sequences encoding proteins with ∼25–35% sequence identity with FN3K-FN3K-RP are also found in genomes from other eukaryotes (e.g. Caenorhabditis elegans, but not Drosophila melanogaster or Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and some prokaryotes (2Delpierre G. Rider M.H. Collard F. Stroobant V. Vanstapel F. Santos H. Van Schaftingen E. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 1627-1634Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The biochemical function of these proteins is at present unknown. They have therefore been excluded from the present analysis, which mainly focuses on the evolution of FN3K and FN3K-RP in vertebrates. Development of Assays of FN3K and FN3K-RP—FN3K can be assayed in partially purified preparations through the phosphorylation of [14C]DMF to [14C]DMF-3-phosphate (2Delpierre G. Rider M.H. Collard F. Stroobant V. Vanstapel F. Santos H. Van Schaftingen E. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 1627-1634Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Because the enzyme has a very low activity, this assay cannot be applied to unfractionated tissue extracts, due to the presence of enzymes and substrates that compete for the added ATP. It was therefore necessary to partially purify FN3K before its assay. This was done by fractionating tissue extracts on Blue-Sepharose on which FN3K is retained and from which it can be eluted with 0.5 m NaCl in the presence of 1 mm ATP-Mg (not shown). This procedure resulted in an ∼10-fold purification of the enzyme. It was checked that the assay of the partially purified enzyme through the phosphorylation of DMF was proportional with time and the concentration of enzyme. It was also verified, for at least one tissue of each of the investigated species, that DMF inhibited the phosphorylation of protein-bound fructosamines catalyzed by the partially purified enzyme. FN3K-RP can be measured through the phosphorylation of psicosamines in the presence of enough DMF to block completely FN3K through competitive inhibition (4Collard F. Delpierre G. Stroobant V. Matthijs G. Van Schaftingen E. Diabetes. 2003; 52: 2888-2895Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The use of protein-bound psicosamines (resulting from the incubation of hen egg lysozyme with allose) was preferred to that of protein-bound ribulosamines, in view of the greater stability of the psicosamine 3-phosphates as compared with ribulosamine 3-phosphates (7Collard F. Wiame E. Bergans N. Fortpied J. Vertommen D. Vanstapel F. Delpierre G. Van Schaftingen E. Biochem. J. 2004; 382: 137-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Here again, the assay cannot be performed without a preliminary partial purification of the enzyme. Several attempts were made to get a chromatographic step that allowed reproducible partial purification of the enzyme. Blue-Sepharose only partially retained the enzyme. We therefore resorted to Blue Trisacryl, which, in our hands, retains proteins more avidly than Blue-Sepharose, presumably because of a higher degree of substitution with Cibacron Blue and/or the presence of a spacer that links the dye to the matrix. Under our conditions (most particularly in the presence of EDTA, which improves the retention), more than 90% of FN3K-RP was retained on the column and could be eluted with NaCl without ATP-Mg, whatever the tissue or the species from which the extract was made (not shown). Tissue Distribution of FN3K, FN3K-RP, and Dehydrogenases of the Pentose Phosphate Pathway—As shown in Fig. 4, the tissues or cells displaying the highest FN3K activity in mice and rats were red blood cells, brain, heart, kidney, and muscle. Lower activities were observed in liver, and no significant activity was detected in lung, spleen, testis, and thymus. A similar profile was observed in chicken tissues, except that the activity was negligible in erythrocytes. The finding that FN3K activity was low in erythrocytes from birds, where the glucose concentration is low (15), led us to study this activity in the erythrocytes from pig, a mammalian species in which the intraerythrocytic concentration of glucose is low (16Higgins P.J. Garlick R.L. Bunn H.F. Diabetes. 1982; 31: 743-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 5, FN3K was found to be also quite low in pig erythrocytes, whereas FN3K-RP activity was comparable with that observed in other mammals.Fig. 5FN3K and FN3K-RP activity in erythrocytes from various species. The activities of FN3K and FN3K-RP have been determined after partial purification of the enzymes using DMF (FN3K) or lysozyme-bound psicosamines (FN3K-RP) as substrates. They are related to the amount of hemoglobin in the extract. Mean of 2 values.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The distribution of FN3K-RP in rat and mouse tissues was found to be more even than that of FN3K, except for skeletal muscle, which displayed less than 20% of the mean activity of other rat or mouse tissues. A very low FN3K-RP activity was also found in skeletal muscle, smooth muscle, and red cells in chicken. A potential source of ribulosamines, the most likely physiological substrate of FN3K-RP (4Collard F. Delpierre G. Stroobant V. Matthijs G. Van Schaftingen E. Diabetes. 2003; 52: 2888-2895Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), is ribose 5-phosphate, an intermediate of the pentose phosphate pathway. We therefore determined the activities of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase, the two rate-limiting enzymes of this pathway, to check if there were any correlation of the expression of the two enzymes with FN3K-RP. As shown in Fig. 6, both enzymes were present in all tissues but their activities were particularly low in skeletal muscle, where they represented only a small fraction of the mean activities found in other tissues. These low activities in skeletal muscle therefore parallel the low FN3K-RP level in the same tissue. Characterization of the Osamine Kinase Present in Fish Tissues—As the BLAST searches indicated that a FN3K/FN3K-RP homolog was present in fish genomes, we fractionated different tissue extracts from the catfish C. gariepinus on Blue-Sepharose and checked for the presence of a ketoamine kinase. Fractions eluted with salt contained an enzyme that phosphorylated protein-bound psicosamines but not protein-bound fructosamines. The highest activities were observed in brain, testis, and liver (0.29, 0.36, and 0.15 milliunits/g protein, respectively), whereas other tissues contained activities at the detection limit (not shown). As shown in Fig. 7 for an enzymatic preparation derived from liver, the activity of the fish enzyme was not inhibited by DMF (up to 10 mm) or fructoselysine, but rather by micromolar concentrations of DMR and ribuloselysine. Furthermore, the enzyme phosphorylated [14C]ribuloselysine but not radiolabeled DMF, indicating that its properties are similar to those of FN3K-RP (not shown). Effect of Diabetes—As FN3K repairs damage induced by glucose, it was of interest to test the effect of starvation and diabetes on the level of expression of the enzyme. Rats were starved for 2 days or rendered diabetic with streptozotocin and analyzed 5 days later. No detectable change in the activity of FN3K was observed in liver, heart, kidney, and brain (not shown). We also determined the level of FN3K and FN3K-RP mRNA by quantitative PCR. No difference was observed between the two experimental conditions and the control for liver, lung, heart, kidney, skeletal muscle, testis, and thymus (not shown). Evolution of the FN3K Gene—We show in the present work that two distinct but related genes encoding orthologs of FN3K and FN3K-RP are present in the mammalian and chicken genomes, whereas there is only one FN3K/FN3K-RP homolog in the genomes of two fishes and of the urochordate C. intestinalis. Accordingly, two different enzymes were found to be present in rat, mouse, and chicken tissues with similar substrate specificities as human FN3K and FN3K-RP, respectively. The properties of the enzyme found in the tissues of a fish (C. gariepinus) were similar to those of FN3K-RP, consistent with the higher degree of similarity of the fish sequences with mammalian FN3K-RP than with FN3K. We speculate that the enzyme of C. intestinalis has also ribulosamine and psicosamine kinase activity, but no fructosamine kinase activity. These experimental findings together with our phylogenetic analysis suggest that the FN3K gene may have arisen by an event of gene duplication of the ancestral FN3K-RP gene, followed by an increased mutation rate of the gene copy that has resulted in the appearance of the present-day FN3K gene. The absence of FN3K from fishes suggests that this event may have taken place just after the time of separation of the fishes from the main line of animal evolution. The precise time of the event cannot be deduced from the tree, because the branching order in this part of the tree does not receive high bootstrap support. Therefore a gene duplication before the fish-animal separation followed by the subsequent loss of the FN3K gene from fish cannot be excluded, but this explanation is not favored because it would be a less parsimonious one. The incorporation of an additional number of mutations (see Fig. 2) resulting in longer branch lengths for the members of the newly arisen FN3K clade would be the explanation for FN3K's wider substrate specificity and subsequent new function (see below). Although the branch leading to chicken FN3K is not as long as those leading to its mammalian orthologs, this may be the result of a gene conversion event in which part of the FN3K sequence has been replaced by the FN3K-RP sequence, as indicated by the high degree of identity of the last 60 amino acid residues of chicken FN3K with those of the corresponding FN3K-RP. The evolution of the FN3K/FN3K-RP genes appears, therefore, to conform with the hypothesis of Ohno (17Ohno S. Evolution by Gene Duplication. Allen and Unwin, London1970Crossref Google Scholar) that after duplication of a gene one copy preserves the original function, whereas the other copy would be free to diverge. This behavior is, however, far from being the rule, as most paralogs evolve at similar rates (18.Kondrashov, F. A., Rogozin, I. R., Wolf, Y. I., and Koonin, E. V. (2002) http://genomebiology.com/2002/3/2/RESEARCH/0008,Google Scholar). A recent study on the evolution of the S. cerevisiae genome (19Kellis M. Birren B.W. Lander E.S. Nature. 2004; 428: 617-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (1146) Google Scholar) indicates that it underwent a global duplication event followed by the loss of most of the duplicated genes, with only about 457 gene pairs persisting in the present day genome. Among these, accelerated evolution (defined as a >1.5-fold higher rate of amino acid substitutions) of one copy compared with the other was observed in 115 pairs, i.e. ∼25%. In many cases, this accelerated evolut"
https://openalex.org/W2064712236,"cAMP signaling leads to activation and phosphorylation of Rap1b. Using cellular models where cAMP stimulates cell proliferation, we have demonstrated that cAMP-mediated activation, as well as phosphorylation of Rap1b, is critical for cAMP stimulation of DNA synthesis. To determine whether Rap1b stimulates mitogenesis in vivo, we have constructed a transgenic mouse where a constitutively active G12V-Rap1b, flanked by Cre recombinase LoxP sites, is followed by the dominant negative S17N mutant. Employing this novel mouse model, we have switched, in a tissue-specific (thyroid) and temporally controlled manner, the expression of Rap1b from a stimulatory to an inhibitory form. These experiments provide conclusive evidence that Rap1b is oncogenic in the thyroid in ways linked to transduction of the cAMP mitogenic signal. cAMP signaling leads to activation and phosphorylation of Rap1b. Using cellular models where cAMP stimulates cell proliferation, we have demonstrated that cAMP-mediated activation, as well as phosphorylation of Rap1b, is critical for cAMP stimulation of DNA synthesis. To determine whether Rap1b stimulates mitogenesis in vivo, we have constructed a transgenic mouse where a constitutively active G12V-Rap1b, flanked by Cre recombinase LoxP sites, is followed by the dominant negative S17N mutant. Employing this novel mouse model, we have switched, in a tissue-specific (thyroid) and temporally controlled manner, the expression of Rap1b from a stimulatory to an inhibitory form. These experiments provide conclusive evidence that Rap1b is oncogenic in the thyroid in ways linked to transduction of the cAMP mitogenic signal. Rap1 GTPases are members of the Ras superfamily of G-proteins, which regulates cell proliferation and differentiation (1Takai Y. Sasaki T. Matozaki T. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 153-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (2072) Google Scholar). Rap1 activity can be regulated by agonists that increase the intracellular levels of cAMP (2Altschuler D.L. Peterson S.N.

Chem. 1995; 270: 10373-10376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). cAMP-dependent activation of Rap1 occurs via Epac (exchange protein activated by cAMP) (3Kawasaki H.

In addition, cAMP activation of protein kinase A results in phosphorylation of Rap1b (6Altschuler D. Lapetina E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7527-7531Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and of the tyrosine kinase c-Src, which leads to activation of the Rap-GEF C3G (7Schmitt J.M. Stork P.J. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 85-94Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Thus, Rap1 is an important target for cAMP signaling. cAMP can either stimulate or inhibit cell proliferation, depending on the cell type and context (8Dremier S. Coulonval K. Perpete S. Vandeput F. Fortemaison N. Van Keymeulen A. Deleu S. Ledent C. Clement S. Schurmans S. Dumont J.E. Lamy F. Roger P.P. Maenhaut C. Ann. N. Y. Acad.

Biochem. 1975; 44: 491-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar), and a striking parallel exists between the action of cAMP and Rap1b on cell proliferation. Whereas Rap1 is inhibitory in model systems where cAMP inhibits cell proliferation (10Cook S.J. Rubinfeld B. Albert I. McCormick F. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3475-3485Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar, 11Schmitt J.M. Stork P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3671-3683Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), we demonstrated that Rap1b stimulates mitogenesis in specific cells where cAMP is a genuine stimulator of cell proliferation (12Ribeiro-Neto F. Urbani J. Lemee N. Lou L. Altschuler D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5418-5423Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 13Altschuler D.L. Ribeiro-Neto F. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7475-7479Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Moreover, we found that hormonal or cAMP stimulation of DNA synthesis required both the binding of GTP to Rap1b as well as the phosphorylation of Rap1b by protein kinase A (12Ribeiro-Neto F. Urbani J. Lemee N. Lou L. Altschuler D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5418-5423Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Prior to these findings, the prevailing view held Rap1b solely as an anti-oncogene (14Zhang K. Noda M. Vass W.C. Papageorge A.G. Lowy D.R. Science. 1990; 249: 162-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). This notion originated from the discovery that Rap1 reverts cellular transformation by the oncogene Ras (15Kitayama H. Sugimoto Y. Matsuzaki T. Ikawa Y. Noda M. Cell. 1989; 56: 77-84Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (763) Google Scholar) and is supported by findings that Rap1 has an effector-binding domain virtually identical to that of Ras and interacts non-productively with typical Ras targets (14Zhang K. Noda M. Vass W.C. Papageorge A.G. Lowy D.R. Science. 1990; 249: 162-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 16Bos J.L. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6776-6782Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Hence, we have proposed that Rap action on mitogenesis depends on cell-specific signal transduction programs such that Rap1b, like cAMP, can either stimulate or inhibit cell proliferation, i.e. that Rap can be viewed as a conditional oncogene. Although some new indirect evidence supports the involvement of Rap1 in tumorigenesis (17Dupuy A.J. Morgan K. von Lintig F.C. Shen H. Acar H. Hasz D.E. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Boss G.R.

Kawamoto H. Hattori M. Minato N. Cancer Cells. 2003; 4: 55-65Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), no direct evidence for an in vivo oncogenic effect of Rap1b exists. Thus, the merit of the conditional oncogene theory still awaits its demonstration in vivo in a physiologically relevant model system, one that requires cAMP for growth. For this we have generated a mouse model that allows the inducible switch of the expression of a stimulatory (G12V-Rap1b) to an inhibitory (S17N) form of Rap1b, in the prototypical cAMP-responsive system, i.e. the thyroid gland. We report here that thyroid expression of constitutively active (i.e. GTPase-deficient) G12V-Rap1b generates a cAMP-dependent tumorigenic phenotype; this effect is lost upon switching the expression of G12V-Rap1b to a Rap1b dominant negative mutant. Generation of Transgenic Mice—The DNA construct contains the bovine thyroglobulin promoter (∼2 kb) and a floxed G12V-Rap1b (∼700 bp) unit followed by the S17N-Rap1b (∼650 bp) cassette. Both Rap coding cassettes contain a rabbit β-globin intron and polyadenylation site (1.2 kb). NotI sites were engineered to release this construct free of vector sequences. Transgenic mice were obtained by pronuclear injection of the NotI fragment (∼6 kb) in an FVB background (Taconic). Founder lines were analyzed by Southern blots, and littermates were genotyped by PCR (300-bp product), utilizing a sense primer derived from the thyroglobulin promoter (5′-CACATTCGTCCCTGGTTCTGC-3′) and an antisense primer derived from the Rap1b sequence (5′-GAGTTTCACGCCACCAGGTACC3-′). All procedures were performed according to the University of Pittsburgh Institutional Animal Care Committee. Goitrogen Treatment—Goitrogen treatment consisted of methimazole (0.5g/liter) and sodium perchlorate (5g/liter) in drinking water ad libitum, changed once weekly. Recombination—4-OH tamoxifen was suspended in sunflower oil and injected daily on 5 consecutive days (intraperitoneally, 1 mg/200 μl/mouse). Cre-mediated recombination at the DNA level was evaluated by PCR. For the recombined product (∼350 bp) a sense primer derived from the thyroglobulin promoter (5′-ACTGGCCACATGAGTGTCCTC-3′) and an antisense primer derived from the His6-tagged-S17N cassette (5′-CACGGTGATGGTGATGGTGATG-3′) were utilized. For the non-recombined product (∼530 bp) a primer derived from the rabbit β-globin intron and polyadenylation site from the G12V cassette (5′-GTCTCTCACTCGGAAGGACATATG-3′) and the same antisense primer described above were utilized. To assess recombination at the protein level, we exploited the fact that only the S17N cassette contains a His6 tag. Thyroid extracts were prepared (pool of three mice/condition) in a buffer containing 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm imidazole, and protease inhibitors. Upon four cycles (30 s each at 4 °C) in the MiniBeadbeater (BioSpec, Inc.), samples were cleared by centrifugation. Lysates were then applied to a nitrilotriacetic acid affinity column (Qiagen), and eluted material was analyzed by Western blot with HA antibody. Immunohistochemistry—HA, proliferating cell nuclear antigen, BrdUrd, and Ki67 analyses were performed according to standard immunohistochemical protocols with an antigen retrieval procedure. Quantification of proliferation was performed by manual counting on >2000 cells/thyroid section. Data are expressed as mean ± S.E. (n = 5 thyroids). Cross-section Areas—H&E sections were used for image analysis with Metamorph software. Sample areas were manually traced in the digitized images, and the resulting measurements were calibrated with the aid of a micrometer. Each determination represents an average of three sections from the middle of the thyroid. No significant differences were observed with sections ∼50–100 μm apart. Results are expressed as mean ± S.E. (n = 5 thyroids). Hormone Measurements—Serum TSH and total T4 (Coat-A-Count) were measured by radioimmunoassay. Rat TSH was used for standard curves. Design of the G-protein “Activity-state Switch” Mouse Model—To critically test whether Rap1b is a conditional oncogene in vivo we have generated a mouse model system utilizing a novel transgene targeted to the thyroid gland via the thyroglobulin promoter. In this construct, “floxed” HA-tagged constitutively active G12V-Rap1b is followed by the His6-HA-tagged dominant negative S17N mutant (Fig. 1A). These mice (Rap1bV12-LoxP-N17) express G12V-Rap1b specifically in the thyrocytes (Fig. 1B). These mice were crossed with the tamoxifen-inducible and estradiol-insensitive CRE-ER-Tx mice (21Brocard J. Warot X. Wendling O. Messaddeq N. Vonesch J.L. Chambon P. Metzger D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14559-14563Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar) to generate a G-protein activity-state switch model, Rap1bV12-LoxP-N17/CRE-ER-Tx. Upon stimulation of Cre activity by tamoxifen, these mice ceased to express active G12V-Rap1b and instead produced the inactive S17N-Rap1b mutant. Although Cre-mediated recombination is expected to occur in every tissue, because of the ubiquitous expression of CMV-CRE-ER-Tx, the G12V- to S17N-Rap1b switch only occurs in thyrocytes because of the use of a thyroid-specific promoter in the Rap1bV12-LoxP-N17 mice. Thus, this model contains an “in vivo/in situ” control, which allows the switch from a stimulatory to an inhibitory G-protein state. Targeted Expression of G12V-Rap1b Does Not Interfere with Thyroid Differentiation—Several founder lines were identified (Fig. 1B, upper left); the transgene expression profile of the founder line utilized in this study is shown (Fig. 1B, upper right). Expression was assessed by both reverse transcription-PCR (not shown) and HA-Western blots, thus demonstrating the enrichment of HA-tagged G12V-Rap1b either by gene dosage (homozygous) or by increasing cAMP upon goitrogen stimulation (Fig. 1B). HA immunohistochemistry demonstrates that the transgene is expressed only in thyrocytes in a mosaic pattern (Fig. 1B, lower panel). Heterozygous matings generated the predicted Mendelian distribution for both males and females, indicating that targeted expression of G12V-Rap1b to the thyroid, a gland critical for normal embryonic development (22Yen P.M. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 1097-1142Crossref PubMed Scopus (1552) Google Scholar), had no deleterious effect on viability. Mice expressing HA-G12V-Rap1b showed no signs of hypo- or hyperthyroidism and exhibited normal secondary sexual characteristics and growth profiles (Fig. 1C, lower panel), indicating normal physiological levels of thyroidal, growth, and gonadal hormones. Analysis of young (<2 months) and old (>1 year) transgenic and wild-type (WT) sibling mice showed no significant differences in thyroid hormone levels (total T4 = 4.33 ± 0.38 μg/dl), thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH = 2.65 ± 0.15 ng/ml), or thyroid histology (Fig. 1C, upper panel). Thus, under basal low thyroidal cAMP signaling, expression of G12V-Rap1b, unlike Ras-G12V, does not interfere with differentiation of the gland and does not produce any mitogenic advantage in either heterozygous or homozygous mice. These results are consistent with in vitro findings demonstrating that G12V-Rap1b by itself is not mitogenic but enhances the mitogenic response to cAMP while maintaining differentiation (12Ribeiro-Neto F. Urbani J. Lemee N. Lou L. Altschuler D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5418-5423Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). G12V-Rap1b Enhances cAMP-stimulated G1/S Entry in Vivo—In agreement with the in vitro work, chronic elevation of thyroidal cAMP by increasing circulating levels of TSH produced a switch to mitogenic action in G12V-Rap1b heterozygous mice. This was achieved using a standard goitrogenic protocol (methimazole/sodium perchlorate) (23Santelli G. de Franciscis V. Portella G. Chiappetta G. D'Alessio P. Califano D. Rosati R. Mineo A. Monaco C. Manzo G. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 5523-5527PubMed Google Scholar), which disrupts the negative feedback regulation exerted by thyroid hormone (24Snyder P.J. Utiger R.D. J. Clin. Investig. 1972; 51: 2077-2084Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). In 14 days, the serum levels of T4 decreased from ∼4 to <0.5 μg/dl and those for TSH increased from ∼3 to ∼100 ng/ml and then remained constant during the goitrogenic regimen with no apparent differences between transgenic and WT mice. After 2 months of this treatment and despite no apparent histological differences (Fig. 2A, top), clusters of proliferating cell nuclear antigen-positive stained cells were observed only in transgenic mice (Fig. 2A, bottom). Because TSH-induced mitogenesis is already desensitized by this goitrogen time point in normal rodents (25Gerard A.C. Denef J.F. Many M.C. Gathy P. de Burbure C. van den Hove M.F. Coppee F. Ledent C. Colin I.M. J. Endocrinol. 2003; 177: 269-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 26Wynford-Thomas D. Stringer B.M. Williams E.D. Acta Endocrinol. 1982; 101: 210-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), these results indicate that G12V-Rap1b promoted G1/S entry of thyrocytes under sustained cAMP signaling, thus providing the first evidence that Rap1b behaves as a conditional mitogen in vivo. cAMP-dependent Tumorigenesis in Thyroids of Mice Expressing G12V-Rap1b—Exposure of G12V-Rap1b mice to a 6-month goitrogen program led to marked thyroid enlargements (Fig. 2B) with well demarcated nodular lesions, which correlated with the expression of HA-G12V-Rap1b (Fig. 2, C and D). This was accompanied by maintenance of the differentiated status of these cells as assessed by reverse transcription-PCR for thyroperoxidase, TSH receptor, and thyroglobulin (not shown). The focal, well circumscribed nodular characteristics of these lesions were accompanied by compression of adjacent hyperplastic foci, consistent with a diagnosis of adenoma. Diffuse follicular cell hyperplasia was also observed elsewhere in the gland, similar to the thyroids of WT mice. As expected, no significant differences in goitrogen-induced thyrotroph hyperplasia were observed in their pituitary glands. (Fig. 2E). The enlargement of the G12V-Rap1b thyroids was dependent on the duration of goitrogen treatment (Fig. 2F) as reflected by an ∼50% increase in thyroid cross-section area and correlated with an ∼2-fold increase in BrdUrd labeling index (Fig. 2H) but not with a potential suppression of apoptosis induced by G12V-Rap1b (not shown). These results are consistent with in vitro studies showing that the mitogenic action of Rap1b is linked to the ability of Rap to promote S-phase entry (12Ribeiro-Neto F. Urbani J. Lemee N. Lou L. Altschuler D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5418-5423Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 13Altschuler D.L. Ribeiro-Neto F. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7475-7479Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Moreover, the increased propensity of transgenic mice thyrocytes to enter S-phase only under persistently elevated thyroidal cAMP represents original evidence in vivo that cAMP must elicit signaling events that endow G12V-Rap1b with mitogenic action. The hyperplastic and nodular phenotype observed in the G12V-Rap1b mice thyroids after 6 months of sustained elevation of thyroidal cAMP was completely reversed after removal of the goitrogenic stimulus for 2 months (Fig. 2G). Under these conditions, serum TSH returned to normal levels (∼3.5 ± 1.1 ng/ml) coupled to an euthyroid state (T4 ∼4.9 ± 0.7 μg/dl), and typical follicular structures started to be reestablished, albeit with a colloid-filled lumen and surrounded by a single line of flattened thyrocytes, typical of hypofunction. However, no significant structural or functional differences were observed between the thyroids of G12V-Rap1b and WT mice. Thus, the Rap1b-linked phenotype seen after 6 months of goitrogen treatment does not have the characteristics of an autonomous adenoma; instead, it is entirely dependent on persistently elevated thyroidal cAMP. This reversibility is not unexpected because high TSH levels under goitrogen treatment likely preclude the selection of mutations that lead to a TSH-independent phenotype. Experimentally induced adenomas and follicular carcinomas were reported to be TSH-dependent upon 131I-labeled goitrogen treatment (27Thomas G.A. Williams D. Williams E.D. Br. J. Cancer. 1991; 63: 213-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). However, upon a long term goitrogenic treatment, i.e. 1 year of sustained elevated thyroidal cAMP, all G12V-Rap1b transgenic but not WT mice developed very large multilobular and hyperemic glands (Fig. 3A). These glands exhibited signs of thyroid follicular cell carcinoma characterized by the presence of invasion of the thyroid capsule, surrounding tissues, and blood vessels. Evidence for the formation of a new capsule around the invasive cells and for the invasion of G12V-Rap1b cells into the muscle tissue is shown in Fig. 3, B and D, respectively. The extracapsular invasion seen in the H&E stains indeed represented proliferating HA-tagged G12V-Rap1b cells as revealed by stains for HA and BrdUrd (Fig. 3E). Evidence for vascular invasion as shown by the H&E, Factor VIII, and HA stains (Fig. 3, C and D) is also presented. However, despite a complete necropsy, no evidence of metastasis could be found. These findings represent the first direct evidence that in the presence of a sustained cAMP signaling program, G12V-Rap1b has oncogenic properties. The invasiveness of tumor cells depends on their interaction with the extracellular matrix (28Hood J.D. Cheresh D.A. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 91-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (1495) Google Scholar). In particular, it is noteworthy that Rap1 is a critical regulator of integrin-mediated adhesion to extracellular matrix components (29Bos J.L. de Bruyn K. Enserink J. Kuiperij B. Rangarajan S. Rehmann H. Riedl J. de Rooij J. van Mansfeld F. Zwartkruis F. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2003; 31: 83-86Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30Kinbara K. Goldfinger L.E. Hansen M. Chou F.L. Ginsberg M.H. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 4: 767-776Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Whether the invasion of Rap1b-expressing thyrocytes is related to modulation of integrin function in vivo remains to be determined. The absence of correlation between invasion and metastasis is not unexpected; existing transgenic models of thyroid cancer only rarely show metastases (31Suzuki H. Willingham M.C. Cheng S.Y. Thyroid. 2002; 12: 963-969Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Moreover, despite initial vascular invasion most of the malignant cells are destroyed in the circulation (32Chambers A.F. Groom A.C. MacDonald I.C. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 563-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (3095) Google Scholar, 33Fidler I.J. Differentiation. 2002; 70: 498-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). However, we could not detect any evidence of apoptotic cells or HA stain in vessels of several potential metastatic targets (not shown). It will be of great interest for future studies to determine whether the intravascular destruction of Rap1b-invasive cells or their inability to lodge and penetrate the vascular bed of potential metastatic sites might be responsible for their failure to produce viable metastasis. Induction of Cre-dependent Recombination Leads to Excision of the G12V-Rap1b Transcription Unit and Expression of S17N-Rap1b—We investigated whether the enhanced cAMP-mediated tumorigenesis seen in thyroids of the Rap1bV12-LoxP-N17 mice was causally linked to the expression of G12V-Rap1b by using the G-protein activity-state switch mouse model Rap1bV12-LoxP-N17/CRE-ER-Tx (Fig. 1A). This model offers the unique opportunity of allowing cAMP tumorigenesis to proceed while controlling the timing of inactivation of G12V-Rap1b expression. In these mice, tamoxifen-dependent stimulation of Cre activity leads to the expression of S17N-Rap1b upon the excision of the G12V-Rap1b transcription unit. Cre-dependent recombination was assessed both at the DNA and protein expression level (Fig. 4A). First, PCR was used to assess genomic DNA prepared from mice treated for 5 consecutive days with tamoxifen (1 mg/0.2 ml/mouse/day) or vehicle control (oil). The expected recombination product (0.35 kb) was observed only in tamoxifen-treated mice as early as 1 day after injection, increasing linearly up to day 3, and reaching a plateau by days 4–5 (Fig. 4A, top). The appearance of the recombined fragment was proportional and concomitant with a decrease of the non-recombined product (0.5 kb). In contrast, no recombination occurred in tamoxifen-treated Rap1bV12-LoxP-N17 mice (not shown), confirming Cre-mediated recombination at the DNA level. Cre-mediated expression of the expected protein (His-HA-N17-Rap1b) was verified after treatment of mice with tamoxifen for 5 days. Thyroid extracts were prepared, and His-HA-N17-Rap1b was affinity-purified on nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose and analyzed by Western blot with anti-HA antibodies. Only the Rap1bV12-LoxP-N17/CRE-ER-Tx mice expressed the expected tamoxifen-dependent HA-Rap1b immunoreactivity (Fig. 4A, bottom). These results demonstrate the success of the strategy used to generate the G-protein activity-state switch mouse model. Rap1-GTP Is Required to Maintain TSH- and cAMP-mediated Hyperplasia—Finally, we tested whether the enhanced cAMP-mediated tumorigenesis seen in the thyroids of Rap1bV12-LoxP-N17 mice was causally linked to G12V-Rap1b expression. Two-month-old Rap1bV12-LoxP-N17/CRE-ER-Tx mice were treated with goitrogen and a 5-day tamoxifen/oil regimen and then tested either at the beginning (establishment) or during (maintenance) the goitrogen protocol. After 4 and 6 months, animals were sacrificed, and their thyroids were analyzed. The thyroids of tamoxifen-treated mice were significantly smaller than those of controls (Fig. 4B). Thyroid cross-section areas were ∼50% decreased in mice subjected to the tamoxifen regimen both at establishment and during maintenance of the hyperplastic state (Fig. 4B), indicating that Rap1-GTP is required to maintain this state. Moreover, the Ki67 (Fig. 4C) and BrdUrd (not shown) labeling indices as well as the total fraction of cycling thyrocytes measured by proliferating cell nuclear antigen staining (not shown) were markedly reduced upon induction of the tamoxifen switch. The partial tamoxifen-dependent inhibition correlated well with the partial penetrance of the recombination event. None of these changes were seen in Rap1bV12-LoxP-N17 mice (not shown), indicating that the effects of tamoxifen were all Cre-dependent. In addition, terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick end-labeling and DNA ladder analysis failed to reveal any differences in the apoptotic indices of tamoxifen-treated animals whether these were the Rap1bV12-LoxP-N17 (tamoxifen-insensitive) or the Rap1bV12-LoxP-N17/CRE-ER-Tx mice, which are sensitive to tamoxifen. In fact the number of apoptotic cells was remarkably low under goitrogen, varying from 14 to 19 per cross-section slide (not shown). Also careful examination of the H&E stains showed no evidence for significant apoptosis, such as extra- and intracellular apoptotic bodies (Fig. 4B). These findings suggest that the growth-inhibitory effect caused by the G12V to S17N expression switch does not appear to be related to induction of apoptosis by tamoxifen but to suppression of the propensity of thyrocytes to enter G1/S. Thus, TSH activation of Rap1b is a critical component in the transduction of cAMP-mediated cell cycle progression in vivo. The effect of tamoxifen induction on the long term goitrogen-dependent malignant phenotype is currently under investigation. Transduction of the cAMP Mitogenic Signal by Rap1b—We have put forward the notion that Rap1 transduces the cAMP signal based largely on results from in vitro studies (2Altschuler D.L. Peterson S.N. Ostrowski M.C. Lapetina E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10373-10376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 6Altschuler D. Lapetina E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7527-7531Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and, in the specific case of cAMP-mediated mitogenesis, that Rap collaborates with Ras signals to elicit a full mitogenic response (12Ribeiro-Neto F. Urbani J. Lemee N. Lou L. Altschuler D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5418-5423Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 13Altschuler D.L. Ribeiro-Neto F. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7475-7479Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Since that time, it has become evident that Rap1b can transduce cAMP signaling in vivo as targeted expression of a dominant negative form of Rap1b to the mouse forebrain impaired cAMP-dependent synaptic plasticity (34Morozov A. Muzzio I.A. Bourtchouladze R. Van-Strien N. Lapidus K. Yin D. Winder D.G. Adams J.P. Sweatt J.D. Kandel E.R.

Immunol. 2002; 3: 251-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar) without antagonizing activation of the T cell receptor and Ras, consistent with the notion that activation of Rap1 by several extracellular signals does not interfere with Ras signaling (4de Rooij J.

However, an intriguing aspect of the mitogenic action of Rap recapitulated in vivo by the present studies is the observation that the activating G12V mutation is insufficient to promote G1/S entry in vitro (12Ribeiro-Neto F. Urbani J. Lemee N. Lou L. Altschuler D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5418-5423Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar); G12V-Rap1b imparted a growth advantage only upon a sustained increase in thyroidal cAMP. The goitrogen-dependent phenotype observed in the heterozygous mice is not simply because of Rap1b gene dosage effects. Similar expression levels of HA-G12V-Rap1b were observed in homozygous mice (Fig. 1B, upper right) in the absence of goitrogen without any mitogenic manifestation. This suggests that cAMP elicits additional signaling events that act on or in cooperation with G12V-Rap1b. One signal might be the protein kinase A-dependent phosphorylation of G12V-Rap1b S179 without which cAMP- and Rap-dependent stimulation of DNA synthesis in vitro does not occur (12Ribeiro-Neto F.

https://openalex.org/W2046480503,"Down-regulation is a classic response of most G protein-coupled receptors to prolonged agonist stimulation. We recently showed that when expressed in baby hamster kidney cells, the human β1-but not the β2-adrenergic receptor (AR) is totally resistant to agonist-mediated down-regulation, whereas both have similar rates of basal degradation (Liang, W., Austin, S., Hoang, Q., and Fishman, P. H. (2003) J. Biol. Chem. 278, 39773–39781). To identify the underlying mechanism(s) for this resistance, we investigated the role of proteasomes, lysosomes, and ubiquitination in the degradation of β1AR expressed in baby hamster kidney and human embryonic kidney 293 cells. Both lysosomal and proteasomal inhibitors reduced β1AR degradation in agonist-stimulated cells but were less effective on basal degradation. To determine whether β1AR trafficked to lysosomes we used confocal fluorescence microscopy. We observed some colocalization of β1AR and lysosomal markers in agonist-treated cells but much less than that of β2AR even in cells co-transfected with arrestin-2, which increases β1AR internalization. Ubiquitination of β2AR readily occurred in agonist-stimulated cells, whereas ubiquitination of β1AR was not detectable even under conditions optimal for that of β2AR. Moreover, in cells expressing βAR chimeras in which the C termini have been switched, the chimeric β1AR with β2AR C-tail underwent ubiquitination and down-regulation, but the chimeric β2AR with β1AR C-tail did not. Our results demonstrate for the first time that β1AR and β2AR differ in the ability to be ubiquitinated. Because ubiquitin serves as a signal for sorting membrane receptors to lysosomes, the lack of agonist-mediated ubiquitination of β1AR may prevent its extensive trafficking to lysosomes and, thus, account for its resistance to down-regulation.

Gutkind J.S. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2001; 22: 368-376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (832) Google Scholar). For most GPCRs, activation is followed by desensitization and internalization of the receptors, which then are targeted to either recycling or degradation pathways (2Tsao P. Cao T. von Zastrow M. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2001; 22: 91-96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 3Marchese A. Chen C. Kim Y.M. Benovic J.L. Trends Biochem.

Several mechanisms for GPCR internalization have been described, the clathrin-coated pit endocytic pathway being the best understood. GPCR kinase-catalyzed phosphorylation of the agonist-occupied receptors promotes arrestin binding to the receptors. Arrestins also interact with clathrin and AP-2 adapter proteins to form complexes that target the receptors into the coated pits (4Goodman Jr., O.B. Krupnick J.G. Santini F. Gurevich V.V. Penn R.B.

Based on differences in the stability and trafficking of arrestin-receptor complexes, GPCRs are separated into two classes (6Oakley R.H. Laporte S.A. Holt J.A. Barak L.S. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32248-32257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar, 7Oakley R.H. Laporte S.A. Holt J.A. Caron M.G. Barak L.S. J. Biol.

Class A such as β2AR, α1bAR and μ opioid receptors bind to arrestin-3 with higher affinity than arrestin-2. The interaction is transient, and upon endocytosis, the arrestin dissociates and returns to the cytosol, whereas the receptor undergoes rapid recycling. Class B such as vasopressin V2 and angiotensin AT1a receptors bind with equal affinity to arrestin-2 and -3 to form stable complexes that internalize together. The receptors recycle more slowly and are degraded more rapidly.Recent studies indicate the involvement of ubiquitination in the internalization and degradation of GPCRs (for reviews, see Refs. 8Shenoy S.K. Lefkowitz R.J. Biochem. J. 2003; 375: 503-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar and 9Wojcikiewicz R.J. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2004; 25: 35-41Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Conjugation of ubiquitin, a 76-amino acid polypeptide, to lysine residues of endoplasmic reticulum-retained proteins initially was found to function as a signal for their degradation by proteasomes (for a review, see Ref. 10Bonifacino J.S. Weissman A.M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 19-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar). Subsequently, ubiquitination was shown to regulate the endocytic trafficking of several plasma membrane receptors by sorting them to lysosomes for degradation (11Hicke L. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 195-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (982) Google Scholar). Some mammalian GPCRs that are ubiquitinated include β2AR (12Shenoy S.K. McDonald P.H. Kohout T.A. Lefkowitz R.J. Science. 2001; 294: 1307-1313Crossref PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar), the chemokine CXCR4 receptor (13Marchese A. Benovic J.L. J. Biol.

Chem. 2003; 278: 45954-45959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Eliminating receptor ubiquitination reduces agonist-mediated receptor degradation but not internalization. Thus, ubiquitination appears to function as a sorting signal for targeting the receptors for degradation in lysosomes.Although the ubiquitination of proteins is a prerequisite for their degradation by proteasomes, the role of the latter in the degradation of GPCRs is unclear. Agonist-promoted degradation of CXCR4 receptors is blocked by inhibitors of lysosomal but not proteasomal function, and the receptors are sorted to lysosomes (13Marchese A. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45509-45512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). Proteasomal inhibitors are reported to either reduce (12Shenoy S.K. McDonald P.H. Kohout T.A.

In one study proteasomal but not lysosomal inhibitors reduced the down-regulation of μ and δ opioid receptors (14Chaturvedi K. Bandari P. Chinen N. Howells R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12345-12355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), whereas in another, lactacystin, a very specific proteasomal inhibitor, did not impair agonist-induced internalization, lysosomal targeting, and degradation of the δ opioid receptor (15Tanowitz M.B.

Some of these studies found that steady-state receptor levels increase in unstimulated cells treated with proteasomal inhibitors (14Chaturvedi K. Bandari P. Chinen N. Howells R.D. J. Biol.

Bristow M.R. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 2001; 33: 887-905Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar), and β1AR in synaptic junctions mediates the effects of noradrenergic stimulation on long term potentiation (19Winder D.G.

Because β1AR is associated with human diseases such as congestive heart failure (18Port J.D. Bristow M.R. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 2001; 33: 887-905Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar) and depression (20Donati R.J. Rasenick M.M. Life Sci. 2003; 73: 1-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), the regulation of β1AR is of considerable interest. In comparison to the human β2AR, the human β1AR is more resistant to agonist-mediated desensitization (21Zhou X.M. Pak M. Wang Z. Fishman P.H. Cell.

Chem. 2003; 278: 39773-39781Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that in agonist-stimulated BHK cells, β1AR is up-regulated due to its resistance to degradation and its increased synthesis (29Liang W. Austin S. Hoang Q. Fishman P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 39773-39781Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). We recently demonstrated that β1AR expressed in BHK and HEK 293 cells undergoes agonist-mediated endocytosis by the clathrin-coated pit pathway but traffics to an endosomal compartment distinct from that of β2AR (27Liang W. Curran P.K. Hoang Q. Moreland R.T. Fishman P.H. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 723-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Thus, differences in subtype degradation may be due to differences in subtype trafficking. Because ubiquitin serves as a sorting signal for lysosomal degradation of receptors, we investigated its role in the resistance of β1AR to degradation. We found that in contrast to β2AR, agonist-mediated ubiquitination of β1AR was not detected. In addition, when we used chimeric receptors in which the C-tails of the two subtypes were exchanged, we observed ubiquitination of the β1/β2ct-AR but not of the β2/β1ct-AR chimera. The inability of the C-tail of β1AR to facilitate receptor ubiquitination may be the basis for its insensitivity to agonistmediated degradation.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—ALLN and leupeptin were from ICN, lactacystin and MG132 were from Calbiochem, chloroquine, NH4Cl, and NEM were from Sigma, and E-64 was from Roche Applied Science.

Clonal lines stably expressing either β1AR or β2AR or co-expressing both arrestin-2 and either subtype were described previously (27Liang W. Curran P.K. Hoang Q. Moreland R.T. Fishman P.H. J.

To obtain cells expressing wild type or chimeric HA-βAR or βAR-GFP or co-expressing one of these receptors and either arrestin-2 or -3, transfections were done with the appropriate plasmid(s) using LipofectAMINE Plus. The cells were either used after 24 h or selected with G418 to obtain resistant, uncloned cultures that expressed fairly constant βAR levels during the experimental period. All stably transfected cells were maintained in medium containing 0.2 mg/ml G418. HEK 293 cells used for experiments were grown on polylysine-coated plastic ware or glass coverslips.βAR Binding Assays—Control and treated cells were assayed for total and surface receptors as described previously (30Dunigan C.D. Curran P.K. Fishman P.H. Methods Mol. Biol. 2000; 126: 329-343PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells grown in 6-well plates were incubated with 10 μm ISO at 37 °C for up to 24 h, rinsed with ice-cold Ca2+- and Mg2+-free DPBS, and lysed in buffer containing protease inhibitors at 4 °C. Portions of the lysates were assayed for protein and for total βAR binding activity with 250 pm [125I]iodocyanopindolol for 1 h at 37°C. For surface βAR, cells grown in 24-well plates were exposed at 37 °C to 1 μm ISO for 30 min. The plates were placed on a bed of ice, and the cells were rapidly washed twice with ice-cold DPBS and exposed to 5 nm [3H]CGP-12177 at 4 °C for 1 h. Finally, the cells were washed as above and assayed for 3H and protein. For both assays 10 μm propranolol was used to define nonspecific binding.βAR Degradation Assay—Basal and agonist-mediated βAR turnover were determined by the loss of surface-biotinylated receptors as previously described (28Dunigan C.D. Hoang Q. Curran P.K. Fishman P.H. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 8019-8030Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 29Liang W. Austin S. Hoang Q. Fishman P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 39773-39781Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells grown in 6-well plates were rinsed with ice-cold buffer B (40 mm NaHCO3/100 mm NaCl, pH 8.6) incubated with 1 mm sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin in buffer B at 4 °C for 30 min and rinsed with ice-cold 20 mm glutamine in DPBS. Some of the cells were lysed as described above (control), and the rest of the cells were warmed to 37 °C in fresh medium in the absence or presence of 10 μm ISO for 4 h. When inhibitors were used, the cells were preincubated with the inhibitors for 30 min and then exposed to ISO. The lysates were extracted in RIPA buffer for 1 h at 4 °C and centrifuged at 17,000 × g for 20 min. βARs were immunoprecipitated from the soluble extracts using protein A-Sepharose beads coated with anti-β1AR or -β2AR antibodies and eluted from the beads by heating in SDS sample buffer at 60 °C for 15 min. The eluted proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to Immobilon-P (Millipore), and probed with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin (1:10,000). The biotinylated proteins were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence and, after exposure to Bio-Max MR or Lite 2 film (Eastman Kodak Co.), quantified by scanning densitometry and NIH Image software, version 1.62.Detection of Ubiquitination of βARs—Cells expressing wt- or chimeric βARs grown in 6-well plates were exposed to 10 μm ISO for up to 24 h, washed, and lysed as described above except the buffer included 10 mm NEM to inhibit deubiquitination enzymes. After extraction in RIPA buffer, immunoprecipitation, and SDS-PAGE, the receptors were transferred to Immobilon-P and probed with mouse monoclonal anti-ubiquitin (1:2,000) and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse (1:10,000) antibodies. In addition, a similar blot was probed with anti-β1AR or -β2AR and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibodies (all 1:10,000).Confocal Fluorescence Microscopy—Previous methods with minor modifications were used to visualize cells with a Zeiss LSM 510 laser confocal microscope (27Liang W. Curran P.K. Hoang Q. Moreland R.T. Fishman P.H. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 723-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells stably expressing HA-β1AR were stained at 4 °C with Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated anti-HA antibody (1 μg/ml), washed with DPBS, and incubated at 37 °C in medium with or without 10 μm ISO for 2 h. Cells stably expressing βAR-GFP or coexpressing βAR-GFP and arrestin-2 were incubated at 37 °C in medium with 10 μm ISO for the indicated times in the figure legends. LysoTracker® Red (75 nm) was added to the medium 30 min before the end of the ISO treatment. Cells then were washed and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline. For antibody staining, the cells were permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in DPBS, blocked with 3% dry milk and 0.05% Triton X-100 in DPBS, and incubated with anti-LAMP-1 (10 μg/ml) and then Cy3-conjugated anti-mouse antibody (3 μg/ml). The coverslips were mounted on slides with ProLong, and the cells were scanned using the confocal microscope. The images were processed using Adobe Photoshop 5.5 or 6.0.Data Analysis—Unless otherwise indicated, each experiment was repeated at least three times, and each data point within an experiment was done in triplicate. Data were fitted to curves by nonlinear regression analysis and analyzed for statistical significance by two-way analysis of variance or two-tailed t test using Prism 3 (GraphPad Software).RESULTSβ1AR Resistance to Agonist-mediated Down-regulation in HEK 293 Cells—We recently showed that human β1AR expressed in BHK cells is up-regulated by persistent agonist stimulation due to a cAMP-mediated increase in β1AR mRNA levels and the resistance of β1AR to agonist-mediated degradation (29Liang W.

To further investigate the regulation of human β1AR, we used the HEK 293 cell line, which is well characterized and serves as a model for studying the function and regulation of various human proteins. HEK 293 cells stably expressing either β1AR or β2AR were exposed to 10 μm ISO at 37 °C for up to 24 h and then assayed for total βAR binding activity using [125I]iodocyanopindolol. The number of β1AR binding sites remained unchanged, whereas that of β2AR decreased to 64% that of control with a t½ of 6.8 h (Fig. 1A). We have shown that overexpressing arrestin-2 and -3 increases agonist-mediated internalization of β1AR in BHK and HEK 293 cells (27Liang W. Curran P.K. Hoang Q. Moreland R.T. Fishman P.H. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 723-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Enhancement of β1AR internalization by arrestin-2, however, does not lead to down-regulation of β1AR in BHK cells (29Liang W. Austin S. Hoang Q. Fishman P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 39773-39781Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Several studies indicated that arrestin-3 has a larger role than arrestin-2 in the regulation of β2AR (7Oakley R.H. Laporte S.A. Holt J.A. Caron M.G. Barak L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17201-17210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar, 12Shenoy S.K. McDonald P.H. Kohout T.A. Lefkowitz R.J. Science. 2001; 294: 1307-1313Crossref PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar). Therefore, we investigated the effects of arrestin-3 on prolonged agonist-mediated regulation of β1AR in BHK and HEK 293 cells. As shown in Fig. 1B, total β1AR binding activity was not reduced by persistent agonist treatment regardless of arrestin-3 co-expression. Thus, although both arrestins facilitate the internalization of β1AR, neither has an effect on its degradation.Degradation or turnover of the receptor proteins in HEK 293 cells was determined by measuring the disappearance of biotinylated cell surface βAR using immunoprecipitation and streptavidin overlay as described under “Experimental Procedures.” In the absence of agonist, the basal degradation of both β-subtypes was similar, with ∼40% of the biotin-labeled receptors being lost in 4 h (Fig. 2). In cells treated with agonist for 4 h, degradation of β2AR increased more than that of β1AR. Based on these results, β1AR expressed in HEK 293 cells is resistant to agonist-mediated down-regulation as was observed in BHK cells (27Liang W. Curran P.K. Hoang Q. Moreland R.T. Fishman P.H. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 723-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Thus, the regulation of human β1AR is similar in both cell lines and is significantly different from that of human β2AR.Fig. 2Basal and agonist-stimulated degradation of βARs in HEK 293 cells. Cells stably expressing β1AR or β2AR were biotinylated, incubated for the indicated times in the absence (open bars) or presence (solid bars) of 10 μm ISO, and analyzed for biotinylated βARs by immunoprecipitation, SDS-PAGE, and overlay with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin as described under “Experimental Procedures.” A, representative overlay showing biotinylated receptors. B, amounts of biotinylated receptors on overlays were quantified by scanning densitometry and expressed as % degraded (calculated by 100 × (DU0 – DU4)/DU0, where DU0 and DU4 are densitometric units of samples from cells incubated 0 and 4 h after biotinylation). Data represent the means ± S.E. of 3–6 independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Effects of Lysosomal and Proteasomal Inhibitors on Degradation of β1AR—To determine whether proteasomes and lysosomes, two major sites for protein degradation, are involved in β1AR degradation, we used a series of known inhibitors. Chloroquine and NH4Cl inhibit protease activity in lysosomes by neutralizing the acidic pH (31de Duve C. de Barsy T. Poole B. Trouet A. Tulkens P. Van Hoof F. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1974; 23: 2495-2531Crossref PubMed Scopus (1528) Google Scholar). E-64 and leupeptin inhibit lysosomal cysteine proteases, and leupeptin also inhibits serine proteases (32Mehdi S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 150-153Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). ALLN, MG132, and lactacystin block proteasomal activity, with lactacystin having the greatest specificity (17Jockers R. Angers S. Da Silva A. Benaroch P. Strosberg A.D. Bouvier M. Marullo S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28900-28908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Degradation of β1AR expressed in BHK and HEK 293 cells was determined using the surface biotinylation procedure described above. The biotinylated cells were pretreated with the inhibitors and then incubated in the presence or absence of ISO for 4 h. As shown in Table I, agonist treatment only had a significant effect on HEK 293 cells not exposed to inhibitor. All the inhibitors reduced the basal β1AR degradation in BHK cells, but only chloroquine, E-64, and ALLN reached statistical significance, with the effect of ALLN being substantial. ALLN, followed by MG132 and chloroquine, significantly lowered the agonist-mediated degradation. The degradation of β1AR in agonist-stimulated HEK 293 cells was significantly inhibited by NH4Cl, E-64, and lactacystin, but only the latter had an effect on basal degradation. These results suggest that β1AR degradation is more sensitive to proteasomal and lysosomal inhibitors in agonist-stimulated cells. They further suggest that basal receptor turnover may involve some other mechanism such as plasma membrane degradation (17Jockers R. Angers S. Da Silva A. Benaroch P. Strosberg A.D. Bouvier M. Marullo S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28900-28908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). None of the inhibitors totally blocked β1AR degradation at the concentrations used. It should be noted, however, that higher concentrations often led to cell death (especially HEK cells).Table IEffects of proteasomal and lysosomal inhibitors on the basal and agonist-mediated degradation of β1AR in BHK and HEK 293 cellsInhibitorBiotinylated β1ARBHK cellsHEK 293 cells- ISO+ ISO-ISO+ ISO% degradedNone41.6 ± 2.943.7 ± 2.639.8 ± 1.854.2 ± 1.5,ap < 0.05; two-way analysis of variance with Bonferroni's post-test.,bCompared to cells not treated with ISO.

The fII peptide (PT473–487, homologous to chymotrypsin residues 149D-163) potently inhibited plasma clotting assays and prothrombinase activity, with 50% inhibition of 12 and 10 μm peptide, respectively. Prothrombinase inhibition by PT473–487 was factor Va (fVa)-dependent and sequence-specific, because the peptide did not inhibit fII activation in the absence of fVa, and a scrambled sequence peptide, PT473–487SCR, was not inhibitory. Peptide PT473–487 did not inhibit the amidolytic activities of fXa and thrombin, suggesting that the peptide did not alter the integrity of their active sites. To determine whether PT473–487 interacted directly with fVa, fluorescein-labeled fVa (Fl-fVa) was prepared. When PT473–487 was titrated into samples containing phospholipid-bound Fl-fVa, the peptide increased fluorescein anisotropy (EC50 at 3 μm peptide), whereas the control peptide PT473–487SCR did not alter the anisotropy, suggesting a direct binding interaction between PT473–487 and Fl-fVa. These functional and spectroscopic data suggest that fII residues 473–487 provide fVa-binding sites and mediate interactions between fVa and fII in the prothrombinase complex.

This activation is accomplished at a physiologically relevant rate by the prothrombinase complex that consists of the serine protease coagulation factor Xa (fXa) associated with its nonenzymatic cofactor, factor Va (fVa), on a negatively charged phospholipid surface in the presence of Ca2+ (4Mann K.G Jenny R.J.

The prothrombinase complex has been kinetically well characterized and is considered an arche-type for other blood clotting complexes. Assembly of this complex results in a 278,000-fold augmentation in the rate of fII activation compared with fXa alone (5Nesheim M.E. Taswell J.B. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 10952-10962Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). fVa functions both as a K-type and a V-type effector in this reaction, decreasing the Km and increasing the kcat, respectively. Additionally, in the presence of fVa and phospholipids, fII activation proceeds almost exclusively via a meizothrombin intermediate (initial cleavage at Arg320), whereas in the absence of these two components, the activation proceeds via a prethrombin 2 intermediate (initial cleavage at Arg271) (2Rosing J.

Therefore, the substrate specificity of fXa is altered in the presence of fVa and phospholipids. fII can be classified as a vitamin K-dependent blood coagulation protein, because it requires vitamin K for its normal biosynthesis (4Mann K.G Jenny R.J. Krishnaswamy S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 915-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). It bears extensive structural and sequential homology to other vitamin K-dependent proteins, such as activated protein C (APC) and fXa (9Di Scipio R.G. Hermodson M.A. Yates S.G. Davie E.W.

The N-terminal region (residues 1–40) of the mature protein is rich in post-translationally modified γ-carboxyglutamic acid (Gla) residues and hence is termed the Gla domain. The Gla domain is followed by two domains that bear structural similarity to Danish kringles and are called “kringle domains” (residues 41–155 and 156–271, respectively). These domains are followed by the serine protease domain (residues 272–579). The serine protease domain of fII is highly homologous to other chymotrypsin-like proteases, such as fXa, fIXa, and APC, and six variable regions and seven conserved regions have been identified (15Furie B. Bing D.H. Feldmann R.J. Robinson D.J. Burnier J.P. Furie B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 3875-3882Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A fundamental yet daunting question concerning multiprotein complexes is: what are the various contact points between the different proteins? Several fVa-binding loci seem likely to exist on fII, although the picture is still incomplete. Both fII kringle domains have been reported to interact with fVa (16Kotkow K.J. Deitcher S.R. Furie B. Furie B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4551-4557Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 17Deguchi H. Takeya H. Gabazza E.C. Nishioka J. Suzuki K. Biochem. J. 1997; 321: 729-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Additionally, the Gla domain of fII has also been reported to participate in fVa binding (18Blostein M.D. Rigby A.C. Jacobs M. Furie B. Furie B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38120-38126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Recently, it was reported that a cluster of cationic residues on the protease domain of fII termed “anion-binding proexosite-I” is involved in the interaction of fII with fVa (19Anderson P.J. Nesset A. Dharmawardana K.R. Bock P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16435-16442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 20Monoteiro R.Q. Zingali R.B. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2002; 87: 288-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Mutations of these basic residues to acidic Glu have resulted in a fII with impaired fVa binding, suggesting the participation of this region in fVa recognition (21Chen L. Yang L. Rezaie A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 27564-27569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Synthetic peptides may provide useful information about protein-protein interactions. For example, certain sequences in the vitamin K-dependent enzyme APC were essential for interactions with its substrate, fVa (22Mesters R.M. Houghten R.A. Griffin J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24514-24519Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Mesters R.M. Heeb M.J. Griffin J.H. Protein Sci. 1993; 9: 1482-1489Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 24Mesters R.M. Heeb M.J. Griffin J.H. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 12656-12663Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Subsequent site-directed mutagenesis of the APC autolysis loop (chymotrypsin (CHT) residues 149–163) supported these implications (25Gale A.J. Heeb M.J. Griffin J.H. Blood. 2000; 96: 585-593Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Based on the sequence homology of the serine protease domain of protein C with that of fII and fXa, we used synthetic peptides comprising related sequences in fII and fXa to test their ability to inhibit assembly of the prothrombinase complex (13Mather T. Oganessyan V. Hof P. Huber R. Foundling S. Esmon C.T. Bode W. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6822-6831Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Here, we identified a distinct sequence in fII that is essential for its interaction with fVa, namely amino acids 473–487 (CHT 149D-163). Materials—Human fVa and Echis carinatus venom were purchased from Hematologic Technologies Inc. (Essex Junction, VT). Human fII, fXa, and thrombin were obtained from Enzyme Research Laboratories (South Bend, IN). The chromogenic substrates S-2222 and S-2238 were purchased from DiaPharma (West Chester, OH) and CBS 34–47 from Diagnostica Stago Inc. (Parsippany, NJ). Rabbit brain cephalin was obtained from Sigma. Bovine serum albumin, human fibrinogen, and d-phenylalalyl-l-prolyl-l-arginyl chloromethyl ketone were purchased from Calbiochem. Normal human citrate-anticoagulated pooled plasma and fVa-deficient plasma were obtained from George King Bio-Medical, Inc. (Overland Park, KS). Alexin, the aPTT reagent, was purchased from Sigma. Fluorescein-labeled fXa (Fl-fXai) was prepared as described (26Yegneswaran S. Fernandez J.A. Griffin J.H. Dawson P.E. Chem. Biol. 2002; 9: 485-494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Small unilamellar vesicles were made as described (27Husten E.J. Esmon C.T. Johnson A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 12953-12961Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using synthetic dioleolyphosphatidylcholine (PC) and dioleolyphosphatidylserine (PS) purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL), and percent recovery of lipids in vesicles was estimated post centrifugation using a l-3-phosphatidylcholine-1, 2-di[1-14C]oleoyl PC (Amersham Biosciences) as a tracer. All other reagents were of the highest quality available. Peptide Synthesis and Characterization—Fifteen amino acids long C-terminal amide peptides were synthesized using standard Boc chemistry, then N-acetylated and purified to homogeneity using reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography as described earlier (22Mesters R.M. Houghten R.A. Griffin J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24514-24519Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For some experiments, peptides were obtained from Bio Synthesis Inc. (Lewisville, TX). Mass spectroscopic analyses of the purified peptides yielded the exact expected molecular weight for each individual peptide. Solutions of each peptide were prepared and the concentrations determined as described (22Mesters R.M. Houghten R.A. Griffin J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24514-24519Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fluorescein Labeling of fVa—fVa was labeled as described previously (28Isaacs B.S. Husten E.J. Esmon C.T. Johnson A.E. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 4958-4969Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 29Krishnaswamy S. Nesheim M.E. Pryzdial E.L. Mann K.G.

Biol. 2002; 9: 485-494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) to yield fluorescein-labeled fVa, designated Fl-fVa. Briefly, fVa (4.3 mg/ml) in buffer containing 50 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, and 5 mm CaCl2 was reacted with a 10-fold molar excess of the fluorescent reagent in the dark at 4 °C for 8 h. The reactants were mixed throughout the reaction by a gentle tumbling motion. Subsequently, the labeled protein was separated from the excess unreacted dye by passing the reaction mixture over a Sephadex G-25 (Amersham Biosciences) column (40 × 0.5 cm). The labeled protein eluted in the excluded volume of the column, whereas the free unreacted dye eluted later in the included volume of the column. Fl-fVa was aliquoted into convenient volumes, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at –80 °C for future use. Fluorescein Labeling of Meizothrombin—Fluorescein-labeled meizothrombin was prepared as described previously (30Armstrong S. Husten E.J. Esmon C.T. Johnson A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6210-6218Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, human fII (1 mg/ml) was incubated for 10 min at 37 °C with E. carinatus venom (5 μm final) in the presence of fluorescein-Phe-Pro-Arg chloromethyl ketone (200 μm final) in 50 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, and 2 mm CaCl2. The reaction was stopped with 5 mm EDTA and immediately chromatographed at room temperature on an anion exchange column (Mono-Q, Amersham Biosciences) using a 20-ml linear gradient from 0 to 600 mm NaCl. Two peaks were resolved. The second peak eluting at ∼450 mm NaCl corresponded to fluorescein-labeled meizothrombin (Fl-mfIIai) based on SDS-PAGE analysis. Fractions containing Fl-mfIIa were pooled and dialyzed in 50 mm Hepes, 150 mm NaCl, and 5 mm CaCl2, aliquoted, quick frozen, and then stored at –80 °C for future use. fXa-1-stage Coagulation Assay—Peptides were screened for effects on fXa coagulant activity using a fXa-1-stage coagulation assay and normal human plasma described previously (22Mesters R.M. Houghten R.A. Griffin J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24514-24519Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, rabbit brain cephalin (100 μl at 200 μg/ml) was preincubated with 100 μl of normal human plasma or factor Va-deficient plasma for 200 s at 37 °C. Coagulation was then initiated by the addition of fXa (200 μl at 0.31 nm in 50 mm Tris/HCl (pH 7.4), 100 mm NaCl, 0.5% BSA, 0.02% NaN3 (TBS-BSA) plus 15 mm CaCl2) that had been preincubated for 10 min with the peptide of interest at 37 °C. The residual fXa clotting activity in the presence of each different peptide concentration was calculated from a standard curve derived from the double logarithmic plot of clotting time versus fXa concentration. fXa and Thrombin Amidolytic Assays—Amidolytic activities of fXa and thrombin toward their respective peptide chromogenic substrates, S-2222 and CBS 34–47 (or S-2238), were assayed (22Mesters R.M. Houghten R.A. Griffin J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24514-24519Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Yegneswaran S. Mesters R.M. Griffin J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33312-33318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), and the effect of synthetic peptides on amidolytic activity was determined. The peptide (0–350 μm) was incubated with the enzyme (5–10 nm) in buffer containing 50 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, and 0.5% BSA for 10 min at room temperature. Thereafter, the activity of the enzyme toward its respective chromogenic substrate was assayed at six different substrate concentrations (ranging between 0 and 2 mm) using an OPTIMAX tunable microplate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). Fibrinogen Clotting—Human thrombin (0.5 units/ml) was preincubated with peptide (0–1 mm) at five different concentrations in 200 μlof buffer containing TBS-BSA plus 2.5 mm CaCl2 for 10 min at 37 °C in polystyrene cuvettes. Clotting was initiated by the addition of 200 μlof human fibrinogen (5 mg/ml) in TBS-BSA plus 2.5 mm CaCl2, and the time from the addition of fibrinogen to clot formation was measured using an Electra 700 Automatic Coagulation Timer (Medical Laboratory Automation, Inc., Mount Vernon, NY). Prothrombinase Assay—fII activation was measured in a two-stage assay (22Mesters R.M. Houghten R.A. Griffin J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24514-24519Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Yegneswaran S. Mesters R.M. Griffin J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33312-33318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The first step involved the generation of thrombin, which was subsequently measured in the second step using a chromogenic substrate S-2238 or CBS 34–47. Amounts of fXa, phospholipids, and fII present in the assay were such that the rate of thrombin generation was linearly proportional to the amount of fVa present in the reaction mixture. Unless otherwise indicated, the peptide was preincubated with fVa (0.4 nm final) in TBS-BSA plus 2 mm CaCl2 for 20 min at 22 °C. Following preincubation, an aliquot of this solution was added to a solution containing fII (1.2 μm final) and PC/PS vesicles (50 μm final) in TBS-BSA plus 2 mm CaCl2. Thrombin generation was initiated by the addition of fXa (1 nm). To measure the amount of thrombin generated, a 20-μl aliquot of the activation mixture was withdrawn every minute and quenched into 80 μl of buffer containing TBS-BSA plus 10 mm EDTA. Finally, the amount of thrombin present was quantified by adding 50 μl of 2 mm S-2238, and the rate of substrate hydrolysis was monitored at 405 nm for 2.5 min. The change in A405 was directly proportional to the thrombin generation. For the assays performed in the absence of fVa, the protocols were the same except that the synthetic peptides were preincubated with fII before thrombin generation was initiated by the addition of fXa. For some kinetic studies, a modified prothrombinase assay was used to conserve reagents. Briefly, different concentrations of fII (ranging from 0 to 6.5 μm) in 50 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, 0.1 mm MnCl2, 0.5% BSA and 0.02% NaN3 were incubated with PC/PS vesicles (25 μm) and fVa (114 pm) in the presence or absence of different concentrations of the peptide of interest at room temperature for 10 min in a total volume of 35 μl. fII activation was initiated by adding 10 μlof fXa (320 pm) in the same buffer. After 2.5 min, the reaction was quenched with 50 μl of buffer containing 50 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, and 10 mm EDTA, and the thrombin that was generated was measured by using CBS 34–47 (50 μl, 1.3 mm), and then the rate of substrate hydrolysis was monitored by the rate of change in A405 that was directly proportional to the thrombin concentration. Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (aPTT) Assays—The procoagulant activities of fVa and Fl-fVa were compared using an activated partial thromboplastin time assay. Briefly, fVa-deficient plasma (45 μl) was incubated with Alexin, the aPTT reagent (50 μl), and various concentrations of fVa or Fl-fVa (5 μl) in buffer containing 50 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, and 0.5% BSA for 3 min at 37 °C. Clotting was initiated by the addition of 30 mm CaCl2 in the same buffer. Clotting times were recorded using an Amelung KC4A coagulometer (Sigma). Western Blots—Samples containing Fl-fVa or unlabeled fVa (5 μl, 0.8 μm) were analyzed using 6% Tris/glycine SDS-PAGE to achieve maximum separation between heavy and light chains of fVa. The protein bands were subsequently transferred for 40 min onto an Immobilon polyvinylidene difluoride (Millipore) membrane at 24 V with a semidry transfer apparatus (Bio-Rad). To improve the quality of the blot, protein-binding sites on the membrane not occupied by protein bands were then blocked with 1% casein in 50 mm Tris/HCl (pH 7.4), 100 mm NaCl, and 5 mm CaCl2 for 1 h. Thereafter, the membrane was incubated with the primary antibody (5 μg/ml) against either the heavy chain of fVa (32Heeb M.J. Rehemtulla A. Moussalli M. Kojima Y. Kaufman R.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 260: 64-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) or light chain (clone V59) (33Gale A.J. Xiao X. Pellequer J. Getzoff E.D. Griffin J.H. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 2091-2101Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) or the fluorescein dye (Molecular Probes, Eugene OR) for 1 h at room temperature, followed by a 30-min incubation with the biotin-conjugated secondary antibody (1 μg/ml) directed against the primary antibody. Finally, the membrane was incubated with a solution containing alkaline phosphatase-conjugated streptavidin (1 μg/ml) for 30 min. This step was followed by the addition of an alkaline phosphatase substrate, a mixture of 5-bromo-4-chloro-3′-indolylphosphate and nitro blue tetrazolium chloride (Pierce). Color development was terminated after bands were visualized by washing the substrates off of the membrane with water. Concentration Determination by Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assays (ELISA)—Sandwich ELISAs were performed on Maxisorp (Nalge Nunc, Intl.) 96-well plates. The plates were thoroughly washed with TBS for a minimum of three rinses between each step, as described below, to remove excess reagents. Incubations were for a time period of 1 h at room temperature unless mentioned otherwise. First, the wells were coated with 20 μg/ml of rabbit anti-fVa antibody (75 μl/well) for 1 h at 37 °C (32Heeb M.J. Rehemtulla A. Moussalli M. Kojima Y. Kaufman R.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 260: 64-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Next, other potentially unoccupied protein-binding sites on the wells were blocked nonspecifically with Superblock (Pierce) buffer. Afterward, various dilutions (400–51,200-fold dilution of stock) of fVa (stock 4.3 mg/ml) or unknown concentrations of Fl-fVa (40–2560-fold dilution) were incubated in the wells for 2 h at room temperature. Subsequently, the plates were incubated with monoclonal anti-fVa detecting antibody (3B1, 5 μg/ml) directed against the light chain of fVa (32Heeb M.J. Rehemtulla A. Moussalli M. Kojima Y. Kaufman R.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 260: 64-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 33Gale A.J. Xiao X. Pellequer J. Getzoff E.D. Griffin J.H. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 2091-2101Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Thereafter, biotinylated anti-mouse IgG (1 μg/ml) was added, followed by incubation with streptavidin/alkaline phosphatase (1 μg/ml, 75 μl/well). Finally, the amount of fVa was estimated from the alkaline phosphatase activity detected after the addition of p-nitrophenylphosphate substrate (100 μl/well) in which hydrolysis was monitored at 405 nm. Inhibition of Arg271 Cleavage by PT473–487—Fl-mfIIai (1.2 μm) was incubated with PC/PS vesicles (50 μm), fVa (4.2 nm), and varying concentrations of peptide PT473–487 (0–50 μm) in 75 μl of buffer containing 50 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, and 5 mm CaCl2 for 10 min at room temperature. Thereafter, the hydrolysis of Fl-mfIIai at Arg271 was triggered by the addition of fXa (4 nm) for 10 min at 37 °C. Subsequently, the reaction was stopped by the addition of 20 μl of hot SDS sample buffer. The samples were incubated on a boiling water bath and analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and then fluorescent protein bands were visualized using UV light on an EAGLE-EYE II (Stratagene) imager. The fluorescence image was digitalized, and cleavage at Arg271 was quantified using UN-SCAN-IT version 5.1 (Silk Scientific Corp., Orem, UT). Spectral Measurements—Steady-state fluorescence intensity and anisotropy measurements were made using a SLM AB2 Luminescence spectrometer (SLM Aminco, Rochester, NY) or SLM 8100 fluorometer equipped with a 150-W xenon arc lamp, two holographic gratings in the excitation light path, and an IBM computer for data analysis. Fluorescein fluorescence was detected at its excitation and emission maxima wavelengths of 490 and 521 nm, respectively, using a 345-nm cut-off filter (Schott Glass Technologies, Duryea, PA) in the excitation beam path. Shutters were closed, except during measurements, to minimize photodegradation of the samples. A circulating water bath was used to maintain the sample compartment at 25 °C. All fluorescence experiments were performed in 5 mm × 5 mm quartz cuvettes. Samples were mixed using a small teflon-coated 2 mm × 2 mm magnetic spinbar as described previously (34Dell V.A. Miller D.L. Johnson A.E. Biochemistry,. 1990; 29: 1757-1763Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 26Yegneswaran S. Fernandez J.A. Griffin J.H. Dawson P.E. Chem. Biol. 2002; 9: 485-494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Absorption of protein to the cuvette walls was minimized by coating the cuvettes with 100% PC vesicles as described previously (35Ye J. Esmon N.L. Esmon C.T. Johnson A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23016-23021Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For a typical fluorescence experiment, two samples were prepared in parallel. The sample cuvette (S) received fluorescent protein in 50 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, and 2 mm CaCl2, whereas the blank cuvette (B) received an equal concentration of unlabeled protein in the same buffer. The initial net fluorescence intensity of the sample, designated Fo, was obtained by the subtraction of the B cuvette signal from the S cuvette signal. For the titrations involving Fl-fVa, equimolar concentrations of peptides were added to two cuvettes in parallel: one (S) containing 50 nm Fl-fVa and 25 μm PC/PS vesicles and the other (B) containing equimolar concentrations of unlabeled fVa and phospholipid vesicles. The signal of the B cuvette was never >1% of the S cuvette. After the signal observed in the absence of the dye (sample B) was subtracted from that in the presence of the dye (sample S), the net volume-corrected signal was designated F at that point in the titration. The interaction of peptide PT473–487 with lipid-bound Fl-fVa was measured by monitoring the change in the steady-state anisotropy of Fl-fVa. Steady-state anisotropy was measured using Glan-Thompson prism polarizers on both the excitation and emission beams. The net emission intensity measured when the sample was excited by vertically (V) plane-polarized light and the emission detected through a horizontal (H) polarizer is termed FVH. FHH, FHV, and FVV are defined analogously. The component intensities of a dye-free blank were subtracted from the component sample intensities to give the net emission intensities. Anisotropy (r) was then calculated from the net intensities using r = (FVV – GFHV)/(FVV + 2GFVH) where the grating factor G equals FHV/FHH. The anisotropy of Fl·fVa·PC/PS complex in the absence of peptide was designated ro, whereas the anisotropy in the presence of peptide was designated r. To obtain binding constants, (r/ro) – 1 was plotted against the peptide concentration and the data fit to a hyperbolic profile. The interaction of PC/PS-bound Fl-fVa with prothrombin was monitored analogously. The curves obtained from the fluorescence assays were fit using GraphPad Prism version 3.03 as described previously (31Yegneswaran S. Mesters R.M. Griffin J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33312-33318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Dynamic Quenching—Collision of fluorophores with certain solutes, such as d-orbital containing I– ions, results in the dissipation of the exited state energy of the fluorophore to the solute molecules (36Lakowicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy,9. Plenum Press, New York1983: 258-296Google Scholar). This results in a loss of fluorescence signal or quenching. The solvent accessibility of the fluorescein dye in Fl-fVa was ascertained by testing the effect of various concentrations of I– ion on the fluorescence emission of Fl-fVa. Samples containing Fl-fV"

In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the localization of ASH1 mRNA to the distal tip of budding cells results in the asymmetric sorting of Ash1p to daughter cell nuclei. Efficient localization of ASH1 mRNA depends upon the activity of four cis-acting localization elements and also upon the activity of trans-factors She2p, She3p, and Myo4p. She2p, She3p, and Myo4p have been proposed to form an ASH1 mRNA localization particle. She2p directly and specifically binds each of the four ASH1 cis-acting localization elements, whereas She3p has been hypothesized to function as an adaptor by recruiting the She2p-mRNA complex to Myo4p, a type V myosin. The Myo4p-She3p-She2p heterotrimeric protein complex has been proposed to localize mRNA to daughter cells using polarized actin cables. Here we demonstrate that whereas the predicted Myo4p-She3p-She2p heterotrimeric complex forms in vivo, it represents a relatively minor species compared with the Myo4p-She3p complex. Furthermore, contrary to a prediction of the heterotrimeric complex model for ASH1 mRNA localization, ASH1 mRNA artificially tethered to She2p is not localized. Upon closer examination, we found that mRNA tightly associated with She2p is transported to daughter cells but is not properly anchored at the bud tip. These results are consistent with a model whereby anchoring of ASH1 mRNA requires molecular remodeling of the Myo4p-She3p-She2p heterotrimeric complex, a process that is apparently altered when mRNA is artificially tethered to She2p.

The establishment and maintenance of cellular polarity is a salient feature of eukaryotic cells and involves the asymmetric sorting of proteins to distinct compartments or regions of the cell. One mechanism by which proteins can be sorted in a variety of eukaryotic cell types is via mRNA localization, a process by which mRNA is specifically localized to a particular region of a cell (1Bashirullah A. Cooperstock R.L. Lipshitz H.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 335-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar, 2Kloc M. Zearfoss N.R. Etkin L.D.

A primary step in the process of mRNA localization is the identification of the localization substrate by trans-acting factors, resulting in the formation of a localization mRNP. 1The abbreviations used are: mRNP, messenger ribonucleoprotein; RNP, ribonucleoprotein; DAPI, 4′,6′-diamidino-2-phenylindole; IP, immunoprecipitation; RT, reverse transcription.1The abbreviations used are: mRNP, messenger ribonucleoprotein; RNP, ribonucleoprotein; DAPI, 4′,6′-diamidino-2-phenylindole; IP, immunoprecipitation; RT, reverse transcription. The mRNP localization complexes are dynamic structures undergoing molecular reorganization at various stages of the localization pathway (4Hachet O. Ephrussi A.

RNA localization can result from a number of distinct mechanisms involving direct transport of the mRNA to the site of localization, generalized degradation of the mRNA with localized protection or random diffusion followed by entrapment of the mRNA at the site of localization (1Bashirullah A.

Ultimately, translation of the mRNA at the site of localization leads to the asymmetric distribution of the protein in the cell.The asymmetric sorting of Ash1p in Saccharomyces cerevisiae is a paradigm for investigating the asymmetric segregation of proteins via mRNA localization. Ash1p is a transcriptional repressor that is asymmetrically sorted to daughter cells, resulting in differential gene expression between mother and daughter cells (7Maxon M.E. Herskowitz I. Proc.

The unequal segregation of Ash1p results from the localization of ASH1 mRNA at the distal tip of budding yeast cells during anaphase of the cell cycle (10Chartrand P. Meng X.H. Huttelmaier S.

Nature. 1997; 389: 90-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Localization of ASH1 mRNA depends upon four cis-acting localization elements, named E1, E2A, E2B, and E3, and each element is sufficient for localizing a heterologous reporter RNA to daughter cells (10Chartrand P.

Myo4p is a type V nonprocessive myosin that directly transports the ASH1-RNP particle to daughter cells (16Beach D.L. Salmon E.D. Bloom K. Curr.

She2p interacts directly and specifically with each of the four cis-acting elements in ASH1 mRNA and also associates with She3p (24Long R.M. Gu W. Lorimer E. Singer R.H. Chartrand P.

The current model for ASH1 mRNA localization proposes the formation of a Myo4p-She3p-She2p-ASH1 mRNA complex in vivo (24Long R.M. Gu W. Lorimer E. Singer R.H. Chartrand P. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6592-6601Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 25Bohl F. Kruse C. Frank A. Ferring D. Jansen R.P.

Once formed, the ASH1-RNP is transported to daughter cells on polarized actin cables. Interestingly, the function of Myo4p and She3p is not restricted to mRNA localization. Myo4p and She3p are also required for inheritance of cortical endoplasmic reticulum, but in contrast to the ASH1 mRNA localization pathway, cortical endoplasmic reticulum sorting is independent of She2p (27Estrada P. Kim J. Coleman J. Walker L. Dunn B. Takizawa P. Novick P. Ferro-Novick S. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 163: 1255-1266Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar).In this report, we present evidence that She3p can simultaneously associate with Myo4p and She2p, resulting in the Myo4p-She3p-She2p heterotrimeric complex and analyze the role of this heterotrimeric complex in the ASH1 mRNA localization pathway. In comparison with the Myo4p-She3p complex, we found that the heterotrimeric complex was present at a relatively lower abundance. Closer inspection revealed that the heterotrimeric complex that is sufficient for transport of mRNA to daughter cells is insufficient for anchoring the mRNA at the bud tip. These results therefore favor a model whereby anchoring of ASH1 mRNA requires reorganization of the Myo4p-She3p-She2p-ASH1 transport mRNP.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESYeast Strains, Media, and Plasmids—The yeast strains used in this study are listed in Table I. Yeast cells were either grown in rich medium or in defined synthetic medium lacking the indicated nutrients (28Rose M.D. Winston F. Hieter P. Methods in Yeast Genetics: A Laboratory Course Manual.

Glass beads were added to the suspension, and cells were broken by vortexing. The extracts were cleared by centrifugation at 5000 × g for 2 min at 4 °C. The soluble fraction was recovered and added to antibody-bound Protein A beads (Pierce). Anti-Myc immunoprecipitations were performed using 7.5 μg of monoclonal 9E10 antibody (Roche Applied Science). Anti-HA immunoprecipitations were performed using 10 μg of monoclonal HA.11 antibody (Convance). The soluble lysate was incubated with antibody-bound Protein A beads for 2 h at 4 °C with gentle agitation. The beads were subsequently washed four times with 500 μl of wash buffer (50 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.3, 100 mm potassium acetate, 2 mm EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 5% glycerol). Bound proteins were eluted by boiling the Protein A-antibody complexes in Laemmli buffer. Equivalent amounts of cell extract (total) and bound proteins (IP) were separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blot. For the salt titration experiment, the above wash buffer containing potassium acetate at concentrations ranging from 100 to 800 mm was used. Each experiment was performed at least twice, and quantitative values were determined with either AlphaImager 2200 (AlphaInnotech Corp.) or FluroChem 8900 (AlphaInnotech) software.Immunoprecipitation/RT-PCR—With few modifications, immunoprecipitation/RT-PCR reactions were performed as previously described, using antibody-bound Protein A beads (33Gonsalvez G.B. Lehmann K.A. Ho D.K. Stanitsa E.S. Williamson J.R. Long R.M. RNA. 2003; 9: 1383-1399Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). For immunoprecipitation experiments using the Myc epitope, 7.5 μg of anti-Myc 9E10 was used. For immunoprecipitation of endogenous She2p, 20 μl of anti-She2p rabbit antiserum was used. The RT-PCR reactions were performed using the Access/RT-PCR kit (Promega) according to the directions provided by the manufacturer and were performed under conditions to ensure that amplifications were in the linear range of the assay.RNP Purification—Yeast cells expressing the desired constructs were harvested by centrifugation, and a soluble yeast lysate was prepared as described under “Immunoprecipitation/RT-PCR.” The soluble lysate was added to 20 μl of FLAG-agarose beads (ANTI-FLAG® MS2 Affinity Gel; Sigma) and incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with gentle agitation. The beads were recovered by centrifugation at 500 × g for 2 min at 4 °C, and the beads were washed four times with 600 μl of wash buffer (50 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.3, 100 mm potassium acetate, 2 mm EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 5% glycerol). The bound proteins were eluted by heating the beads at 65 °C for 10 min in 100 μl of elution buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, and 1% SDS). The soluble lysate (total) and eluate (IP) fractions were subsequently separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blot. Myc-tagged proteins were detected using the anti-Myc 9E10 monoclonal antibody, whereas the 4×FLAG-MS2 fusion protein was detected using ANTI-FLAG M2® monoclonal antibody-peroxidase conjugate (Sigma).In Situ Hybridization and Fluorescence Microscopy—The in situ hybridizations were performed as described previously using ASH1-Cy3 or lacZ-Cy3 DNA oligonucleotide probes (11Long R.M.

Methods Enzymol. 2000; 318: 493-506Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were subsequently stained with DAPI and mounted on slides with mounting medium containing phenylenediamine. Images were captured using a Nikon Eclipse 600 epifluorescence microscope equipped with a 60× numerical aperture 1.4 objective, interfaced to a Micromax-Interline Transfer CCD Camera (Princeton Instruments, Inc.) and MetaMorph Imaging Software (Universal Imaging Corp.).RESULTSShe2p Associates with Myo4p Dependent on She3p—Previous work demonstrated that She3p is capable of associating in vivo with both Myo4p and She2p (24Long R.M.

EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5514-5524Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), potentially resulting in two complexes: Myo4p-She3p (complex II) and She3p-She2p (complex III) (Fig. 1A). Based on the presumed ability of She3p to simultaneously interact with both Myo4p and She2p, it was hypothesized that a Myo4p-She3p-She2p heterotrimeric complex (complex IV) could also form in vivo (Fig. 1A) (24Long R.M. Gu W. Lorimer E. Singer R.H. Chartrand P. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6592-6601Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 25Bohl F. Kruse C. Frank A. Ferring D. Jansen R.P.

Therefore, we investigated the presence of the heterotrimeric complex by immunoprecipitating Myo4p-Myc13 from a yeast lysate and analyzing the ability of She2p to co-immunoprecipitate with Myo4p-Myc13 (Fig. 1B). She2p was found to specifically co-precipitate with Myo4p dependent on She3p (Fig. 1B, compare lanes 2 and 3). These results support the conclusion that a fraction of She2p is a component of a Myo4p-She3p-She2p heterotrimeric complex (complex IV) and are in agreement with results obtained from a genome-wide tandem affinity purification analysis (35Gavin A.C.

Nature. 2002; 415: 141-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (3974) Google Scholar).In Vivo Analysis of She3p-containing Protein Complexes— Given that we could detect an in vivo association between Myo4p and She2p, we sought further insight into the steady state abundance of She3p-containing complexes II, III, and IV (Fig. 1A). Following immunoprecipitation of Myo4p-3HA and Western blotting, we observed at least a 20-fold lower signal for She2p-Myc6 compared with the signal corresponding to She3p-Myc6 (Fig. 1C, lane 4). In this experiment, the signal for She2p-Myc6 following immunoprecipitation was more easily detected upon overexposure of the blot (data not shown). Assuming that each Myo4p-3HA-containing complex has an equivalent ability of being immunoprecipitated, this result suggests that the Myo4p-She3p complex (complex II) predominates over the heterotrimeric complex (complex IV).We next determined the relative abundance of the She3p-She2p complex (complex III) in comparison with the heterotrimeric complex (complex IV). Two isogenic yeast strains were used for this analysis, one strain expressing endogenous levels of Myo4p-Myc13 and the other strain expressing endogenous levels of She3p-Myc13. Immunoprecipitations were performed, and the abundance of co-precipitating She2p was determined by Western blot (Fig. 1D). We observed 2-fold more She2p co-precipitating with She3p-Myc13 compared with Myo4p-Myc13. Since She2p can associate with She3p in vivo in two potential complexes (the She2p-She3p complex (complex III) and the heterotrimeric complex (complex IV)), the level of She2p that co-precipitates with She3p under these conditions represents the sum of complexes III and IV. Consequently, our results suggest that complex III and complex IV are present at nearly equivalent levels.It is also possible that the various complexes have different stabilities under the experimental conditions. The salt stability of the various complexes was therefore examined. All complexes were found to be equally stable at 100 mm KOAc (Fig. 2). However, the She3p-She2p complex and the heterotrimeric complex were not stable at salt concentrations higher than 200 mm KOAc (Fig. 2, B and C). In contrast, the Myo4p-She3p complex was stable up to 800 mm KOAc (Fig. 2A). Consequently, we conclude that the apparent lower abundance of She2p-containing complexes is not due to differences in the stabilities of the complexes under the ionic conditions used to prepare the cell lysates.Fig. 2The Myo4p-She3p complex is more resistant to ionic strength than the She3p-She2p complex and the heterotrimeric complex.A, yeast strain YLM1320 was transformed with plasmids pRL460 (YCplac22/She3p-Myc6) and pRL453 (YCplac111/She2p). The transformant was grown in synthetic medium lacking leucine and tryptophan, and a soluble lysate was prepared for immunoprecipitation of She3p-Myc6. Immunoprecipitations were performed in the absence (lane 1) and presence (lanes 2–6) of anti-Myc antibody. Following immunoprecipitation, the beads were washed with buffer containing 100 mm KOAc (lanes 1 and 2), 200 mm KOAc (lane 3), 400 mm KOAc (lane 4), 600 mm KOAc (lane 5), and 800 mm KOAc (lane 6). An aliquot of the lysate (Total) and pellet fractions (IP) was analyzed by Western blot for the presence of Myo4p-3HA using the anti-HA antibody and for the presence of She3p-Myc6 using the anti-Myc antibody. B, the experiment was repeated as in Fig. 2A, but the total (Total) and pellet fractions (IP) were analyzed by Western blot for the presence of She3p-Myc6 using the anti-Myc antibody and She2p using a polyclonal She2p antiserum. C, yeast strain W303-Myo4p-Myc was grown in YEPD, and a soluble lysate was prepared for immunoprecipitation of Myo4p-Myc13. Immunoprecipitations were performed in the absence (lane 1) and presence (lanes 2–6) of anti-Myc antibody. Following immunoprecipitation, the beads were washed with buffer containing 100 mm KOAc (lanes 1 and 2), 200 mm KOAc (lane 3), 400 mm KOAc (lane 4), 600 mm KOAc (lane 5), and 800 mm KOAc (lane 6). An aliquot of the lysate (Total) and pellet fractions (IP) was analyzed by Western blot for the presence of Myo4p-Myc13 using the anti-Myc antibody and for the presence of She2p using a rabbit polyclonal She2p antiserum.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)ASH1 mRNA Is Associated with Similar Amounts of Myo4p, She3p, and She2p—She2p, She3p, and Myo4p have been shown to associate with ASH1 mRNA in vivo, and the association of ASH1 mRNA with She3p and Myo4p is dependent on She2p, suggesting that She3p and Myo4p associate with ASH1 mRNA via heterotrimeric complex formation (22Munchow S. Sauter C. Jansen R.P. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 1511-1518Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Takizawa P.A. Vale R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5273-5278Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). A prediction made by the current model is that She2p associates with ASH1 mRNA prior to associating with She3p and Myo4p. Thereby, more ASH1 mRNA could be associated with She2p than with She3p or Myo4p. Examining the level of ASH1 mRNA associated with She2p, She3p, and Myo4p tested this prediction. She2p-Myc13, She3p-Myc13, and Myo4p-Myc13 were immunoprecipitated from yeast lysates, and co-precipitating ASH1 RNA was analyzed by RT-PCR (Fig. 3A). A similar amount of ASH1 mRNA was found to co-precipitate with She2p-Myc13, She3p-Myc13, and Myo4p-Myc13 under these conditions, consistent with the hypothesis that very little, if any, ASH1 mRNA associated with any of these three proteins exists free of the heterotrimeric complex.Fig. 3She2p, She3p, and Myo4p are associated with similar amounts of ASH1 mRNA.A, IP/RT-PCR analysis of ASH1 mRNA associated with She2p, She3p, and Myo4p.

Recently we reported in vitro and in vivo chemical probing data indicating that the 150-bp major breakpoint region (Mbr), which contains three breakage subregions (hotspots) (known as peaks I, II, and III), has single-stranded character and hence a non-B DNA conformation. Although we could document the non-B DNA structure formation at the bcl-2 Mbr, the structural studies were limited to chemical probing. Therefore, in the present study, we used multiple methods including circular dichroism to detect the non-B DNA at the bcl-2 Mbr. We established a new gel shift method to detect the altered structure at neutral pH on shorter DNA fragments containing the bcl-2 Mbr and analyzed the fine structural features. We found that the single-stranded region in the non-B DNA structure observed is stable for days and is asymmetric with respect to the Watson and Crick strands. It could be detected by oligomer probing, a bisulfite modification assay, or a P1 nuclease assay. We provide evidence that two different non-B conformations exist at peak I in addition to the single one observed at peak III. Finally we used mutagenesis and base analogue incorporation to show that the non-B DNA structure formation requires Hoogsteen pairing. These findings place major constraints on the location and nature of the non-B conformations assumed at peaks I and III of the bcl-2 Mbr.

It is the most important of all lymphoid cell translocations because follicular lymphomas account for nearly half of all non-Hodgkin's lymphomas. Analyses of the breakpoint regions have shown that the BCL-2 gene on chromosome 18 is joined to the JH segment of the immunoglobulin heavy chain locus on chromosome 14, while the reciprocal junction consists in fusion of a DH segment from the IgH locus on chromosome 14 with the remaining 3′ BCL-2 untranslated region on chromosome 18 (1Bakhshi A.

The structure contains distinctive regions of single-strandedness that correspond well to the regions of translocation frequency among patients. We were able to reproduce the single-stranded character of the bcl-2 Mbr on human minichromosomes, indicating that this distinctive property does not rely on the sequence of the surrounding DNA. We were also able to reproduce the single-stranded character when the Mbr was carried on prokaryotic plasmids (replicated in Escherichia coli), indicating that eukaryotic proteins are not necessary to generate the altered DNA structure. We further showed that RAGs are the nuclease responsible for the bcl-2 translocation (15Raghavan S.C. Swanson P.C. Wu X. Hsieh C.-L. Lieber M.R.

The conformation is stable for days, and Mg2+ and spermidine stabilize it. We used single-stranded DNA oligonucleotides to probe which regions of the structure are available for hydrogen bonding, and these probings provided an independent demonstration of the asymmetry in single-strandedness between the top and bottom strands. Substitution of 7-deazaadenine or 7-deazaguanine for dA or dG, respectively, blocked the ability to form the non-B structure, indicating the importance of Hoogsteen hydrogen bonding. A 3-bp exchange between the top and bottom strands of the duplex reduced the non-B structure formation, which is also consistent with Hoogsteen hydrogen bonding. Circular dichroism documented the structure by yet another method. These studies confirmed the non-B structure, provided new information about its longevity, and provided higher resolution information about its asymmetry. Based on this, we conclude that the structure requires Hoogsteen hydrogen bonding, and we can begin to consider the types of possible non-B DNA conformations that form at the bcl-2 Mbr. Enzymes, Chemicals, and Reagents—Sodium bisulfite and other chemical reagents were purchased from Sigma. Restriction enzymes and DNA-modifying enzymes were obtained from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). Radioisotope-labeled nucleotides were purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Oligomers—Oligomers (oligonucleotides) were from Qiagen/Operon (Richmond, CA) or from the University of Southern California Norris Cancer Center Microchemical Core Facility. The following oligomers were used in this study: SCR56, 5′-ATTAGAATCATTCAAAGGTCTGATCATTCTG-3′; SCR57, 5′-AATATTTTGCTTAAAAATTAGAATC-3′; SCR62, 5′-GTGGTTTGACCTTTAGAGAGTTGCTTTACGTG-3′; SCR-83, 5′-CCCTGTTGACAATTAATCATCG-3′; SCR84, 5′-CTATACGCAGCTTGGCTGCAGGTC-3′; SCR93, 5′-CCGCGGAAGGAGGGCAGGAGGGCTC-3′; SCR94, 5′-GGGTGGGTCTGTGTTGAAACAGGCC-3′; SCR-95, 5′-CCCTGAGGCCCGCCGGGGAGGTCTGGC-3′; SCR96, 5′-CCCACCCAGAGCCCTCCTGCCCTCCTTCCG-3′; SCR97, 5′-CGCGTCCCATTCGCCATTC-3′; SCR98, 5′-CAATACGCAAACCGCCTCTCC-3′; SC-R103, 5′-GAGCCCTCCTGCCCTCCTTCCGCGG-3′; SCR104, 5-GGTATTCAGGATTACATGCATG-3′ SCR112, 5′-GAAGCCAGACCTCCCCGGCGGGCCTCAGGGA-3′; SCR113, 5′-AGGAAGACCCTGAAGGACAGCCATGAGAAAG-3′; SCR114, 5′-GGAAGGAGGGCAGGAGGGCTCTGGGTGGGTCTGTGTTGAAA-3′; SCR115, 5′-CTTTCTCATGGCTGTCCTTCAGGGTCTTCCT-3′; SCR117, 5′-GATCATTCTGTTCCCTGAGGC-3′; SCR156, 5′-CGCCTGATGAATGCTCATCC-3′; SCR157, 5′-ATTCTCAATAAACCCTTTAGG-3′; SCR160, 5′-CAGTGAGGCACCTATCTCAGC-3′; and SCR161, 5′-AATAGACTGGATGGAGGCGG-3′. The following oligomers were used for mutagenesis: SCR89, 5′-CCCAGAGCCCTCCTGGGGTCCTTCCGCGGGGGC-3′; and SCR90, 5′-GCCCCCGCGGAAGGACCCCAGGAGGGCTCTGGG-3′. The oligomers were purified using 8–15% denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The complementary oligomers (or DNA strands) were annealed in 100 mm NaCl and 1 mm EDTA by heating in a beaker of boiling water for 10 min followed by slow cooling as indicated. PCR Amplification of Shorter DNA Fragments with bcl-2 Mbr or Control Regions—The fragments of interest were PCR-amplified from the genomic DNA or from plasmid DNA containing the bcl-2 Mbr with appropriate primers and using standard PCR conditions (Fig. 1). The 231-bp control regions were amplified from the ampicillin or chloramphenicol gene. The PCRs were performed using a thermocycler (Stratagene) under the following conditions: 1× reaction mixture (10 mm Tris (pH 8.3), 50 mm KCl, 0.01% gelatin) with 1.5 mm MgCl2, 400 μm dNTPs, and 1 unit of Taq polymerase in a volume of 10 μl. Amplification was carried out for 35 cycles. The annealing temperature used was standardized according to the primer used in each specific PCR. The PCR products were resolved on an agarose gel, and the correct sized fragments were recovered using a Gene Clean Kit (BIO101, Vista, CA). In the case of the 3-bp mutant bcl-2 Mbr PCR fragment, the product was generated by using pSCR41 as the amplification template (see below). To generate deazaguanine- or deazaadenine-containing PCR fragments, the PCRs were carried out in the presence of 200 μm dCTP, 200 μm dTTP, 40 μm dATP, 40 μm dGTP, 160 μm deazaadenine, and 160 μm deazaguanine. Single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) was prepared by primer extension using a 248-bp PCR fragment containing bcl-2 Mbr as the template. Primer extension was carried out using primer SCR84 or SCR56. Primer extension reactions were performed by mixing the following on ice: DNA sample (10 ng), 1× Thermo polymerase buffer (1×, 10 mm KCl, 10 mm (NH4)2SO4, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.8), and 0.1% Triton X-100), 4 mm MgSO4, 4 μm dNTPs, 0.25 μm [γ-32P]ATP end-labeled oligomer, and 0.4 unit of vent (exo-) polymerase (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) after layering with mineral oil. Linear amplification primer extensions were carried out on a PCR machine (20 cycles) under the following conditions: 94 °C for 3 min (1 cycle); 94 °C for 45 s, 55 °C for 45 s, and 75 °C for 30 s (20 cycles); and final extension of 2 min. The reactions were then terminated by adding the stop dye. The linear ssDNA was then resolved on a 6% denaturing polyacrylamide gel and purified from the gel for further experiments. Gel Shift Assay—The gel-purified PCR fragments of interest were end-labeled using [γ-32P]ATP according to the standard protocol (20Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). To generate the non-B form DNA structure 10 nm end-labeled bcl-2 Mbr or control PCR fragment was incubated in 50 mm Tris (pH 7.2), 10 mm MgCl2, 100 mm NaCl, and 100 μm spermidine overnight at 37 °C. The products were directly loaded on a 6% native polyacrylamide gel prepared in 1× Tris borate-EDTA (pH 7.2) and 5 mm MgCl2 and electrophoresed in the same buffer containing MgCl2. The gel was dried and exposed to a PhosphorImager screen, and the signal was detected using PhosphorImager 445SI (Amersham Biosciences) and analyzed with ImageQuant software (Version 5.0). Bisulfite Modification Assay—The bisulfite modification assay was carried out as described earlier (15Raghavan S.C. Swanson P.C. Wu X. Hsieh C.-L. Lieber M.R. Nature. 2004; 428: 88-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 21Gough G.W. Sullivan K.M. Lilley D.M. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 191-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 22Yu K. Chedin F. Hsieh C.-L. Wilson T.E. Lieber M.R. Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 442-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar). In brief, ∼1 μg of DNA fragment (200 or 248 bp) containing bcl-2 Mbr was used for the bisulfite treatment. 12.5 μl of 20 mm hydroquinone and 457.5 μl of 2.5 m sodium bisulfite (pH 5.2) were mixed, and then DNA (30 μl) was added (done in a 500-μl microcentrifuge tube) and incubated for 14–16 h at 37 °C. The DNA was then purified using a Wizard DNA clean-up kit (Promega, Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The bisulfite-modified DNA was then desulfonated with 0.3 m NaOH for 15 min at 37 °C and recovered by ethanol precipitation. The purified DNA was resuspended in 30 μl of Tris-EDTA (pH 8.0) and stored at -20 °C. The fragments of interest were PCR-amplified from the bisulfite-treated DNA with appropriate primers using standard PCR conditions. The PCRs were performed using a thermocycler (Stratagene) under the following conditions: 1× reaction mixture (10 mm Tris (pH 8.3), 50 mm KCl, 0.01% gelatin) with 1.5 mm MgCl2, 400 μm dNTPs, and 1 unit of Taq polymerase in a volume of 10 μl. Amplification was carried out for 35 cycles. The PCR products were resolved on an agarose gel, and the correct sized fragments were recovered using a Gene Clean kit (BIO101). Purified PCR products were cloned using the TOPO-TA cloning kit (Invitrogen). Plasmid DNA from each clone of interest was purified using the Gene Elute plasmid miniprep kit (Sigma). Sequencing reactions were carried out using the SequiTherm Excel II sequencing kit (Epigenetics) and MWG thermal cycler model Primus 96 Plus (MWG Biotech, High Point, NC). Automated sequencing was carried out using the Li-Cor DNA analyzer model 4200 (Li-Cor, Lincoln, NE). The primer sites are also subject to bisulfite conversion, and, as a result, some molecules lose the ability to serve as PCR templates. However, this source of background conversion is rare and random in location. Mutagenesis at the bcl-2 Mbr—Mutagenesis was carried out using a standard PCR protocol with mutant sequence primers (20Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar, 23Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, New York1996Google Scholar). To make a CCC to GGG mutation just upstream of peak I, two oligomers carrying the mutated sequences were designed (SCR89 and SCR90) from the chosen region of the bcl-2 Mbr. SCR89 was used in a PCR with XW9 to generate an 85-bp fragment. SCR90 was used in a PCR with XW8 to generate a 270-bp fragment. The 85- and 270-bp PCR products overlap precisely in the 33-bp zone containing the intended, introduced mutation. The 85- and 270-bp fragments were “sewn” together by a PCR containing both fragments and the outermost primers (XW8 and -9) to generate a larger (322-bp) fragment that contains the introduced mutation. After SalI digestion and purification, the PCR fragment was cloned into the SalI site of the pSCR33. The resulting plasmid is pSCR41. The presence of the mutation was further verified by sequencing of the entire Mbr and the surrounding region. A 231-bp fragment containing the mutated Mbr was PCR-amplified, gel-purified, and used for the gel shift assay as described above. Oligomer Annealing Assay—For the oligomer annealing assay, the end-labeled DNA (10 nm) containing the non-B structure was incubated with different concentrations of oligomers in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris (pH 7.2), 10 mm MgCl2, 100 mm NaCl, and 10% sucrose for 4 h at 22 °C. The following oligomer concentrations were used for annealing experiments: 1 nm, 10 nm, 100 nm, 1 μm, and 10 μm. Then the products were resolved on a 6% native polyacrylamide gel. The gel was dried and exposed to a PhosphorImager screen, and the signal was detected using PhosphorImager 445SI (Amersham Biosciences) and analyzed with ImageQuant software (Version 5.0). P1 Nuclease Assay—For the P1 nuclease assay, 10 nm substrate DNA (or ssDNA) was incubated with the following concentration of P1 nuclease in NEB buffer 2 (10 mm Tris (pH 7.9), 10 mm MgCl2, 50 mm NaCl, and 1 mm dithiothreitol) at 37 °C for 20 min. The reaction products were mixed with 1× DNA dye and immediately loaded onto a native polyacrylamide gel (6%) as described above. P1 concentrations used for the study are 0.0001, 0.001, 0.01, 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 1, and 3 units or as described in the figure legend. The gel was dried and exposed to a PhosphorImager screen, and images were obtained as described above. Circular Dichroism—The CD spectra were recorded on a Jasco J-810 spectropolarimeter at 22 °C. The DNA samples (1.6 μm) were incubated in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris (pH 7.2), 10 mm MgCl2, 100 mm NaCl, and 100 μm spermidine for 4 h at 37 °C. A 231-bp fragment containing the bcl-2 Mbr, a mutant bcl-2 Mbr with a 3-bp mutation, or 231-bp control DNA fragments amplified from ampicillin or chloramphenicol genes were used for the study. DNA samples were placed on a 0.2-cm path length square quartz cuvette and used for the scanning. Thirty scans were performed per spectra. Spectra of buffer solution were subtracted to correct for base-line artifacts. CD spectra were normalized in units of molar ellipticity (degrees cm2 dmol-1). The bcl-2 Mbr Non-B Structure Is Stable—We have shown previously that a non-B DNA structure forms at the bcl-2 Mbr (15Raghavan S.C. Swanson P.C. Wu X. Hsieh C.-L. Lieber M.R. Nature. 2004; 428: 88-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). However, such a structure could conceivably be either intermittent or stable. If intermittent, it might change conformation between B form and non-B form DNA rapidly. To determine whether the Mbr non-B structure is stable, we permitted various lengths of DNA containing the Mbr to form the structure under different conditions (Fig. 1). Some of the conditions favor the non-B structure, and others do not based on our previous analyses (15Raghavan S.C. Swanson P.C. Wu X. Hsieh C.-L. Lieber M.R. Nature. 2004; 428: 88-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). We then resolved the DNA molecules using native PAGE. If the exchange rate between the B and non-B form of the DNA was on the order of seconds or minutes, then it would not be possible to distinguish them based on their movement through a gel matrix. If the exchange rate was on the order of hours or longer, then separation might be possible. The [γ-32P]ATP end-labeled PCR fragment (231 bp) was incubated at 37 °C overnight in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris (pH 7.2), 10 mm MgCl2, 100 mm NaCl, and 100 μm spermidine (buffer B) to facilitate the structure formation or in a buffer of 10 mm Tris (pH 7.2) (buffer A). The samples were then resolved by 6% native PAGE. We found that when the PCR products were loaded immediately after labeling, we could not observe any alteration in the DNA mobility, indicating an absence of structure formation (Fig. 2, lanes 1 and 2). However, when the DNA was incubated in the Mg2+-containing buffer B, a new band was visible with a faster migration, indicating structure formation (Fig. 2, lanes 5 and 6). Indeed the non-B conformation migrated faster than the duplex form of the bcl-2 Mbr. This faster movement may be attributed to a shorter overall length of the non-B region (designated as “shifted species”). It is important to note that the top or bottom strand alone, when gel-purified, migrated at a clearly different position on these native gels, indicating that the shifted band that we saw is not a denatured form of single-stranded DNA (see data below for details). The quantity of the shifted band was estimated to be about 10–15% of the total DNA based on quantitation of this gel and multiple independent additional gels. Upon storing at -20 °C and thawing (even without the Mg2+-containing buffer), the structure could form (although to a lesser extent perhaps due to trace amounts of Mg2+ associated with the DNA given that no EDTA was present in buffer A) (Fig. 2, lanes 3 and 4). After non-B structure formation, when the purified DNA was incubated at 80 °C in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.2) with EDTA (10 mm), the non-B structure was not detectable (Fig. 2, lanes 11 and 12), suggesting that formation and stability of the structure requires the presence of Mg2+. It is important to note that an indistinguishable shifted species formed in buffer B when the 231-bp bcl-2 Mbr fragment was derived by restriction digestion of a plasmid rather than by PCR (data not shown). Samples stored at 4 °C for over 2 days or at 22 °C for 14 h also maintained the non-B structure. Based on these studies, we conclude that the non-B DNA structure is stable for hours to days. The non-B structure is favored by Mg2+. The bcl-2 Mbr Non-B Structure Is Dependent on DNA Sequence and on Specific Types of Hydrogen Bonding—Would alterations in DNA sequence affect the non-B structure? Because we find maximal single-strandedness at peaks I and III of the Mbr (15Raghavan S.C. Swanson P.C. Wu X. Hsieh C.-L. Lieber M.R. Nature. 2004; 428: 88-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar), the structure formation must involve sequences at or adjacent to these peaks. Therefore, we mutated CCC→GGG on the top strand and vice versa on the bottom strand by using a standard mutagenesis protocol (see “Experimental Procedures”). Such a change would not alter B form DNA, but it may alter any of a number of non-B DNA structures because in most such alternative configurations a purine base must form Hoogsteen hydrogen bonds with one strand while simultaneously forming Watson-Crick hydrogen bonds with another strand (and pyrimidines cannot do this). An end-labeled 231-bp PCR fragment containing the mutated bcl-2 Mbr (mutant bcl-2 Mbr) was then studied in the gel shift assay. Results showed that the mutation caused the disappearance of most of the shifted species, although there was a new faint band that appeared between the duplex and the wild type shifted species (Fig. 2, lanes 7 and 8). These results indicate that the observed structure formation can be abolished or reduced by a three-nucleotide alteration. This can be understood because the CCC→GGG alteration should make the expected non-B DNA structure weaker as three probable Hoogsteen pairing “GGG” residues on the purine-rich second strand have been altered to “CCC.” Hence, a 3-bp sequence alteration that maintains the base composition and Watson-Crick hydrogen bonding is sufficient to reduce the non-B structure formation. We wondered whether bases that were reduced in their ability to form Hoogsteen base pairs would be able to form the structure. 7-Deazaadenine and 7-deazaguanine (analogues of adenine and guanine, respectively) interfere with Hoogsteen hydrogen bond formation (24Seela F. Ott J. Franzen D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1982; 10: 1389-1397Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 25Sinden R.R. DNA Structure and Function. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1994Google Scholar). We used these base analogues to determine whether Hoogsteen pairing is required for the observed structure formation. We PCR-amplified the 231-bp PCR fragment containing the bcl-2 Mbr in the presence of 7-deazaguanine and 7-deazaadenine along with guanine and adenine in a ratio of 4:1 (dCTP and dTTP were present at the same concentration as the dGTP and dATP). The PCR products were gel-purified, end-labeled, and incubated at 37 °C for 16 h in a Mg2+ buffer. The results showed that the majority of the shifted band disappeared (Fig. 2, lanes 9 and 10), indicating that Hoogsteen hydrogen bonding is essential for the structure formation. This lack of structure formation in the presence of 7-deazaadenine and 7-deazaguanine strongly suggests that the observed structure formation requires Hoogsteen hydrogen bonding because B form DNA does not rely on base pairing at the N-7 position at all. Thus, incorporation of modified bases that reduce the number of possible Hoogsteen hydrogen bonds markedly reduces the structure formation. The Surrounding DNA Length Influences the Non-B DNA Structure at the Mbr—We were interested in determining the length and sequence effects of the DNA surrounding the bcl-2 Mbr. We PCR-amplified DNA fragments of various lengths (130, 231, 248, 263, and 339 bp) containing the Mbr region (Fig. 1). The gel-purified fragments were [γ-32P]ATP end-labeled and incubated in the Mg2+ buffer as described above and resolved by native PAGE. The results showed that in the case of the 263-bp fragment, we could see a new shifted species upon incubation (Fig. 3A, lanes 5 and 6), suggesting the presence of an altered DNA structure. As in the case of the 231-bp fragment, we could destroy the structure by incubating at 80 °C in the presence of EDTA (Fig. 3A, lanes 3 and 4). Similar results were obtained when a 248-bp fragment or a 339-bp fragment was used for the gel shift assay (data not shown). However, when a similar experiment was performed with the 130-bp fragment, there was no band with a shifted mobility compared with duplex DNA (Fig. 3B). The sequences from all three peaks of the Mbr were present in the 130-bp fragment, although the region just upstream of peak I was not included (Fig. 1). This suggests that the sequences just upstream of peak I are critical for the structure formation. Control experiments were performed by amplifying PCR fragments (231 bp) either from the ampicillin or the chloramphenicol gene. We did not find any shift in the mobility of the duplex DNA bands in these cases when using the same incubation conditions as described above (Fig. 3, C and D, compare lanes 1 and 2 with lanes 3 and 4), indicating that the observed structure formation is specific to the bcl-2 Mbr fragment. Detection of a Non-B DNA"
https://openalex.org/W2029114861,"Activated platelets promote intrinsic factor X-activating complex assembly by presenting high affinity, saturable binding sites for factor IXa mediated by two disulfide-constrained loop structures (loop 1, Cys88-Cys99; loop 2, Cys95-Cys109) within the second epidermal growth factor (EGF2) domain. To identify amino acids essential for factor X activation complex assembly, recombinant factor IXa point mutants in loop 1 (N89A, I90A, K91A, and R94A) and loop 2 (D104A, N105A, and V107A) were prepared. All seven mutants were similar to the native factor IXa by SDS-PAGE, active site titration, and content of γ-carboxyglutamic acid residues. Kinetic constants obtained by either titrating factor X or factor VIIIa on SFLLRN-activated platelets or phospholipid vesicles revealed near normal values of Km(app) and Kd(app)FVIIIa for all mutants, indicating normal substrate and cofactor binding. In a factor Xa generation assay in the presence of activated platelets and cofactor factor VIIIa, compared with native factor IXa (Kd(app)FIXa ∼ 1.1 nm, Vmax ∼ 12 nm min–1), N89A displayed an increase of ∼20-fold in Kd(app)FIXa and a decrease of ∼20-fold in Vmax; I90A had an increase of ∼5-fold in Kd(app)FIXa and ∼10-fold decrease in Vmax; and V107A had an increase of ∼3-fold in Kd(app)FIXa and ∼4-fold decrease in Vmax. We conclude that residues Asn89, Ile90, and Val107 within loops 1 and 2 (Cys88-Cys109) of the EGF2 domain of factor IXa are essential for normal interactions with the platelet surface and for the assembly of the factor X-activating complex on activated platelets. Activated platelets promote intrinsic factor X-activating complex assembly by presenting high affinity, saturable binding sites for factor IXa mediated by two disulfide-constrained loop structures (loop 1, Cys88-Cys99; loop 2, Cys95-Cys109) within the second epidermal growth factor (EGF2) domain.

We conclude that residues Asn89, Ile90, and Val107 within loops 1 and 2 (Cys88-Cys109) of the EGF2 domain of factor IXa are essential for normal interactions with the platelet surface and for the assembly of the factor X-activating complex on activated platelets. Coagulation factor IX (FIX) 1The abbreviations used are: FIX, factor IX; EGF, second epidermal growth factor; TF, tissue factor; Gla, γ-carboxyglutamic acid; BSA, bovine serum albumin; ATIII, antithrombin III; HT, Hepes-Tyrodes buffer; TBS, Tris-buffered saline; wt, wild type; PC, phosphatidylcholine; PS, phosphatidylserine. is a vitamin-K-dependent serine protease zymogen that plays a pivotal role in blood coagulation. Deficiency of FIX or defective FIX activity results in hemophilia B. FIX circulates in plasma before being proteolytically activated by either FXIa or tissue factor/FVIIa (TF/FVIIa) to form FIXa, a heterodimer consisting of a catalytic-domain-containing heavy chain (∼28 kDa) and light chain (∼18 kDa). FIXa exhibits negligible activity toward its physiological substrate FX unless it is in complex with the surface (activated platelets or negatively charged phospholipids) and a non-enzymatic cofactor FVIIIa via a mechanism that remains to be fully understood. The FIXa heavy chain contains the serine protease active site that catalyzes the activation of the macromolecular substrate FX in a cofactor-dependent manner (1Kolkman J.A. Christophe O.D. Lenting P.J. Mertens K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29087-29093Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The light chain of FIXa, which consists of a γ-carboxylated glutamic acid (Gla)-containing module and two modules that are highly homologous to epidermal growth factor (EGF), also participates in the assembly of the FX-activating complex by interacting with both the surface and the cofactor. Previous studies from our laboratory have demonstrated that the zymogen, FIX, binds to a discrete number (n ∼ 250 sites per platelet) of receptors on the surface of activated platelets (Kd ∼ 2.5 nm) that can also be occupied by the enzyme, FIXa, and are mediated by residues Gly4-Gln11 within the Gla domain (2Wilkinson F.H.

In addition, FIXa, but not FIX, can bind to a site (n ∼ 250 sites per platelet, Kd ∼ 0.5 nm) on activated platelets, mediated by residues 88–109 (disulfide constrained loops 1 and 2) but not by residues 110–124 (loop 3) within the EGF2 domain (2Wilkinson F.H.

Recently, however, alanine-scanning mutagenesis studies of residues within the EGF2 domain of FIX have identified residues Asn89-Gly93 that were implicated as critical for binding of FVIIIa (8Chang Y.J. Wu H.L. Hamaguchi N. Hsu Y.C. Lin S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25393-25399Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Because it is highly unlikely that the same subdomain of the FIXa EGF2 domain could be important for interactions with both platelet receptors and with FVIIIa, we have conducted the present studies, which are designed to identify specific amino acids essential either for binding to activated platelet receptors or to the cofactor, FVIIIa. “Candidate” residues, most likely to be involved in mediating FX activation on the surface of activated platelets, were selected for alanine-scanning mutagenesis on the basis of: 1) surface exposure of amino acid side chains by x-ray crystallography; 2) conservation among species; and 3) dissimilarity with those in a homologous protein FVII, which does not participate in the assembly of the intrinsic FX-activating complex and does not bind to activated platelets with high affinity (9Monroe D.M. Hoffman M. Oliver J.A. Roberts H.R. Blood Coagul. Fibrinolysis. 1998; 9: S15-S20PubMed Google Scholar). Based on these criteria, we selected and prepared recombinant FIXa point mutants in loop 1 (N89A, I90A, K91A, and R94A) and loop 2 (D104A, N105A, and V107A) of the EGF2 domain to study the contributions of these residues to FX activation complex assembly on activated platelets (Fig. 1). The present results support the conclusion that residues Asn89, Ile90, and Val107 within loops 1 and 2 (Cys88-Cys109) of the EGF2 domain of FIXa are essential for normal interactions with the platelet surface and for the assembly of the FX-activating complex on activated platelets. Dulbecco's modification of Eagle's medium was obtained from Mediatech (Herndon, VA), Vitamin K1 (2-methyl-3-phytyl-1,4-naphthoquinone) was from Abbott Laboratories (Chicago, IL), Q-Sepharose anion exchange resin was from Sigma, and Centricon Plus-20 concentration units were from Millipore (Bedford, MA). HEPES, Tris, fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin (BSA), heparin from porcine intestinal mucosa, benzamidine, and other reagents were purchased from Sigma. Human FIX, human FX, and human antithrombin III (ATIII) were purchased from Enzyme Research Laboratories (South Bend, IN). The FX preparation, obtained as a lyophilized powder, was dissolved in sterile water and dialyzed against HEPES-Tyrodes buffer (HT) before being used in experiments. Human FXIa was purchased from Hematologic Technologies (Essex Junction, VT). High purity recombinant human FVIII was obtained as a generous gift from Baxter Healthcare Corp. (Duarte, CA). Thrombin was purchased from Sigma, the chromogenic substrate S-2765 (N-α-benzyloxycarbonyl-d-arginylglycyl-l-arginine-para-nitroanalidedihydrochloride) was from Dia Pharma Group (Stockholm, Sweden), and bovine brain PS and l-α-dioleoyl-PC were from Avanti Polar Lipids (Birmingham, AL). The thrombin receptor hexapeptide SFLLRN-amide was synthesized using ((9-fluorenyl)methoxy)-carbonyl (FMOC) chemistry on an Applied Biosystems 430A synthesizer, and by reverse phase HPLC was purified to >99.9% homogeneity. Buffers—Tris buffered saline (TBS, containing 10 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4) was supplemented with 2 mm benzamidine, 2 mm EDTA, 5 mm CaCl2 where indicated. HT for FXa generation assays contained 15 mm HEPES, 126 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 375 μm NaH2PO4, 5.6 mm glucose, (pH 7.4) supplemented with BSA (0.5 mg/ml) and 5 mm CaCl2. In Vitro Mutagenesis and Mutant FIX Expression—Alanine point mutations were generated by using the PCR-based method, FIX mutant proteins were expressed in HEK293 cells, and the highest expressing clones were identified as previously described (8Chang Y.J. Wu H.L. Hamaguchi N. Hsu Y.C. Lin S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25393-25399Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). All wild type and mutant proteins were expressed at similar levels. Purification of FIX Proteins—Confluent cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline twice and then switched to serum-free medium supplemented with vitamin K for 24 h. Fresh serum-free medium was added, and conditioned medium was collected every 72 h. The conditioned medium was supplemented with 5 mm benzamidine and 5 mm EDTA and filtered through a cellulose acetate filter (0.45-μm pore size) to remove cell debris. The medium was stored at 4 °C until the day of purification. Purification of recombinant FIX using ion exchange chromatography on Q-Sepharose was as described (10Yan S.B. J. Mol. Recognit. 1996; 9: 211-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). For 500 ml of conditioned serum-free medium, a 1-ml slurry of Q-Sepharose beads was used. The Q-Sepharose beads were first thoroughly equilibrated in the equilibration buffer (TBS plus 5 mm benzamidine plus 5 mm EDTA), and then packed in the chromatography column. The conditioned serum-free medium was then chromatographed. The column was washed with 30 column volumes (∼60 ml) of equilibration buffer and then further washed with 20 column volumes (∼40 ml) of TBS supplemented with 2 mm benzamidine to remove the EDTA. Recombinant FIX proteins were then eluted with TBS 2 mm benzamidine 5 mm CaCl2. Fractions were concentrated to ∼3 ml using Centricon Plus-20 (10,000 molecular weight cut-off, Millipore, Bedford, MA) and dialyzed in TBS buffer. Protein Concentrations—The concentration of FIX proteins were initially determined using the BCA assay (11Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J. Klenk D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (18647) Google Scholar) and then were corrected utilizing the results of active site titration as described below. γ-Carboxyglutamate Analysis—γ-Carboxyglutamate analysis was generously performed by Dr. Rodney Camire (Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA) as described (12Przysiecki C.T. Staggers J.E. Ramjit H.G. Musson D.G. Stern A.M. Bennett C.D. Friedman P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 7856-7860Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Activation of FIX Proteins by FXIa—FIX proteins were activated to their active enzymatic forms as follows: FIX proteins (1 μm) were diluted in HT supplemented with 5 mm CaCl2. FXIa (5 nm) was added at a 1/200 molar ratio, and the reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 90 min. Zymogen activation rates of wild type and mutant proteins were similar. Complete activation was confirmed by SDS-PAGE/silver staining and by active site titration with ATIII. Active Site Titration of FIXa Proteins—To assay the active-site concentration of mutant and wild type proteins, 10 μl of FIXa protein (100 nm) was incubated with 10 μl of ATIII dilutions (0–100 nm) in HT (15 mm HEPES,126 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl,1 mm MgCl2, 375 μm NaH2PO4, and 5.6 mm glucose, pH 7.2) supplemented with BSA (1 mg/ml), heparin (20 μg/ml), and CaCl2 (5 mm) at 37 °C for 15 min, and the reaction was diluted by adding HT buffer to 200 μl. Residual FIXa activity was examined by assaying FXa generation activity in the presence of FVIIIa (5 units/ml), FX (400 nm), and l-α-dioleoyl-PC-PS vesicles (20 μm). The FXa generation reaction was allowed to proceed at 37 °C for 2 min and was stopped by addition of 50 μl of stopping buffer (50 mm HEPES (pH 8.1), 175 mm NaCl, and 20 mm EDTA). The amount of FXa generated was determined by using its chromogenic substrate S2765 as described before (3Wilkinson F.H. Ahmad S.S. Walsh P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5734-5741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Determination of Kmapp and Vmax in the Presence of Saturating FX—An FX activation vessel, containing 1 nm FIXa, 5 units/ml FVIIIa, and SFLLRN-activated platelets (5 × 107 platelets/ml) or extruded PC:PS (mol:mol = 3:1, total concentration = 2 μm) vesicles in HT buffer supplemented with BSA (2 mg/ml) and 5 mm CaCl2, was used. The reaction was initiated by the addition of FX to the indicated concentration and allowed to proceed for 2 min at 37 °C. Then 10 mm EDTA was added to stop the reaction, and the FXa generation was measured as indicated above. Determination of KdappFVIIIa and FX Activation Velocity in the Presence of Saturating FVIIIa (V8max)—FVIIIa at indicated concentrations was titrated into the FX activation vessel containing 0.5 nm FIXa and SFLLRN-activated platelets (5 × 107 platelets/ml) or extruded PC:PS (mol:mol = 3:1, total concentration = 500 nm) vesicles in HT buffer supplemented with BSA (2 mg/ml) and 5 mm CaCl2. The reaction was initiated by the addition of 250 nm FX and allowed to proceed for 2 min at 37 °C. Then 10 mm EDTA was added to stop the reaction. The amount of FXa generated was determined as above. V8max was defined as the maximum velocity of FXa generation at a saturating concentration of FVIIIa under the experimental conditions described. Kd(app)FVIIIa was defined as the concentration of FVIIIa required to achieve half-maximal rates of FX activation. Determination of KdappFIXa and FX Activation Velocity in the Presence of Saturating FIXa (V9max)—FIXa at indicated concentrations was titrated into the FX activation vessel containing 5 units/ml FVIIIa and SFLLRN-activated platelets (5 × 107 platelets/ml) in HT buffer supplemented with BSA (2 mg/ml) and 5 mm CaCl2. The reaction was initiated by the addition of 250 nm FX and allowed to proceed for 2 min at 37 °C. Then 10 mm EDTA was added to stop the reaction. The amount of FXa generated was determined as above. V9max was defined as the maximum velocity of FXa generation at a saturating concentration of FIXa under the experimental conditions described. Kd(app)FIXa was equivalent to the concentration of FIXa required to achieve half-maximal rates of FXa generation under the experimental conditions described. Calculation of kcat—Turnover number (kcat) is defined as moles of FXa generated per mole of surface-bound FIXa per second. Moles of FXa generated was calculated from the Vmax (nanomolar FXa/min), and moles of surface-bound FIXa was calculated from the determined Kd values for the given set of reaction conditions and the input FIXa protein concentration. FIXa-bound concentration (nanomolar) are calculated from Equation 1, [IXa]Bound=Bmax×[IXa]Total[IXa]Total+Kd (Eq. 1) where Bmax (nm) for native FIXa protein was determined from the platelet concentration and the previously determined stoichiometry (600 sites/platelet) for FIXaN (37Ahmad S.S. Rawala-Sheikh R. Walsh P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 3244-3251Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Bmax (nanomolar) for FIXa alanine mutants were derived from kinetic FIXa binding experiments (see Table IV and Fig. 4) by multiplying the Bmax (nanomolar) value for FIXaN by the -fold differences in V9max.Table IVKd(app)FVIXa and V9max values for FXa generation by FIXa on SFLLRN-activated platelets and zymogen activated partial thromboplastin time clotting activitiesFIXaPlateletsClotting activitiesaActivated partial thromboplastin time clotting activities of FIX alanine mutants were assessed as described previously, and published values (8) are included in this table.

Ahmad S.S. Walsh P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5734-5741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Constants for Km, Vmax, Kd(app)FVIIIa, V8max, Kd(app)FIXa, and V9max were derived using KaleidaGraph Software as previously described. Statistical analysis was carried out using analysis of variance followed by pair-wise comparisons with the Bonferroni adjustment procedure for multiple comparison maintaining an experiment-wise Type 1 error level of 0.05 (13Winer B.J. Brown D.R. Michels K.M. Statistical Principles in Experimental Design. 3rd Ed. McGraw-Hill, New York, NY1991: 158-166Google Scholar) as previously described (3Wilkinson F.H. Ahmad S.S. Walsh P.N. J.

Characterization of Proteins—FIX EGF2 alanine-scanning “candidate” mutants expressed in HEK293 cells and secreted in the serum-free medium were purified using Q-Sepharose-dependent pseudoaffinity chromatography as described under “Materials and Methods.” Co-migration of each of the recombinant FIX proteins with normal plasma-derived FIX (FIXNP) by SDS-PAGE (data not shown) suggested normal translation and post-translational modification. Additionally, each of the recombinant FIX proteins was found to have the expected number of γ-carboxyglutamate (Gla) residues (10.9–13.2 mol of Gla/mol of protein) (Table I).Table ICharacterization of recombinant FIX mutantsGla-containing proteinAve. mol Gla/mol proteinActive site conc. per 100 nm proteinFIXNaPlasma-derived FIX (FIXN).

Open table in a new tab Earlier time-course solution-phase FIX activation results have shown that FXIa activates all the seven FIX alanine mutants at normal rates compared with native FIX (8Chang Y.J. Wu H.L. Hamaguchi N. Hsu Y.C. Lin S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25393-25399Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), and each of the FIX proteins was fully activated by FXIa in solution. Gelcode Blue-stained gels of SDS-PAGE displayed complete disappearance of the zymogen band (∼70 kDa) and appearance of heavy (∼28 kDa) and light chains (∼18 kDa) of FIXa for all the recombinant FIXa proteins (data not shown). Active site titration with ATIII also showed complete activation of all FIX proteins. The FIXa concentrations of wild type and mutant proteins used in active site titration were ∼100 nm, determined from A280 and BCA assays. The active site concentrations exhibited for the recombinant FIXa proteins were 84–120 nm (Table I). F-X Titrations—In preliminary screening studies, all the seven “candidate” alanine mutants displayed decreased FXa generation activities on phospholipids. In the present studies, FX activation activities of these FIXa mutants were thoroughly examined on both SFLLRN-activated platelets and PC:PS (3:1) vesicles, respectively (Fig. 2). In these assays, kinetic parameters of the plasma-derived FIXa (FIXa) were used as positive controls, although recombinant FIXa (rFIXawt) was also included in experiments and showed indistinguishable activities compared with native FIXa. Presented in Table II are the apparent Michaelis-Menten kinetic parameters for the FIXa proteins on both surfaces. Regarding activated platelets on the physiological cell membrane, all seven Ala mutants exhibited reduced Vmax values in FXa generation when compared with native FIXa (Vmax ∼ 4.05 nm FXa/min) (Table II and Fig. 2). In particular, rFIXa89A (∼1% Vmax), rFIXa90A (∼3% Vmax), and rFIXa107A (∼10% Vmax) displayed drastically impaired FX activation activities (rescaled in Fig. 2B). However, no significant increase in Km(app) values was observed for most of the chimeras, with the exception of an increase of ∼3-fold in the case of rFIXa89A. This suggests that the deficiency in FXa generation activity does not result from defective FX association with the enzymatic complex. Substrate titrations on artificial surface, extruded phospholipids (l-α-dioleoylPC:PS = 3:1) (regression curves not shown), revealed that rFIXa91A, rFIXa94A, rFIXa104A, and rFIXa105A displayed normal Vmax values compared with native FIXa (Vmax ∼ 25.1 nm FXa/min) although the Km(app) values were slightly increased (Table II). The three other Ala mutants, rFIXa89A, rFIXa90A, and rFIXa107A displayed significantly decreased Vmax values, whereas Km(app) values for rFIXa90A and rFIXa107A were not increased. Kinetic values for rFIXa89A on phospholipids were not determined because saturable enzyme kinetic curves were not observed (Table II).Table IIKinetic properties of the FIXa mutants on SFLLRN-activated platelets and phospholipid vesicles (PC:PS = 3:1)FIXaPlateletsPhospholipidsKm(app)VmaxkcatKm(app)Vmaxnmnm FXa·min-1s-1nmnm FXa·min-1FIXaNaPlasma-derived FIXa (FIXaN).
