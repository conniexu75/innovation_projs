https://openalex.org/W4213028363,The electron-hole pair formation that occurs at the interface between a semiconductor and a solution upon absorption of light leads to oxidation or reduction reactions of solution species. The principles of such photodriven processes are described as well as applications of semiconductors in electrochemical cells and as particulate systems for carrying out heterogeneous photocatalysis and photoelectrosynthesis.

Open-pit mining and hot water extraction methods, which involve the handling of huge tonnages of earth materials, are being employed in the two commercial plants now operating. In situ recovery methods will be required to tap the 90 percent of reserves that are too deeply buried to be surface mined. Development of in situ technologies will be painstaking and expensive, and success will hinge on their compatibility with extremely complex geological conditions in the subsurface."
https://openalex.org/W1988250928,Precipitation chemistry data from a rural area at an elevation of 2900 meters near the Continental Divide in Colorado show unexpectedly low pH values for bulk precipitation. A significant downward trend in pH over the last 3 years is associated with increasing amounts of nitric acid in precipitation.
https://openalex.org/W2091204060,"Assimilation of carbon-14 labeled bicarbonate into photosynthetic products was measured at four stations in the Southern Ocean. Phytoplankton populations incorporated as much as 80 percent of the fixed carbon into lipid under conditions of low temperatures (-0.2 degrees to -1.8 degrees C) and low light intensities. At higher temperatures (+0.3 degrees to +0.8 degrees C) and higher light intensities, incorporation into lipid accounted for less than 20 percent of the fixed carbon, synthesis of polysaccharide and protein being more prominent."
https://openalex.org/W2023880010,"Radar observations of Ganymede, at X-band, show that the surface is unusually bright and has unusual polarization properties. A model of the surface based on large numbers of random ice facets (hence vacuum-ice interfaces) is able to account for these characteristics."
https://openalex.org/W2007608089,"Synthetic Ca(0.15)Fe(0.85)SiO(3) pyroxenoid has the same (pyroxmangite) structure and very nearly the same composition as pyroxferroite, a new mineral found in Apollo 11 lunar samples. The synthetic material is not stable below pressures of approximately 10 kilobars. It appears likely that the lunar pyroxferroite has persisted in a metastable state for some billions of years."
https://openalex.org/W1996466379,"The Australasian and Ivory Coast deep-sea microtektites have fission track ages of 0.71 and 1.09 million years, respectively. These ages are in good agreement with the ages of deposition of the microtektites determined from paleomagnetic data. Both the fission track ages and ages of deposition of the microtektites agree with the potassium/ argon and fission track ages of tektites from the respective tektite strewn fields."
https://openalex.org/W2045521468,"Two rocket flights of an absolute pyrheliometer, separated by 30 months, indicate an increase in solar luminosity (solar constant) of 0.4 percent. The significance of this result is considered in light of the instrument performance during the rocket flights and of pre- and postflight intercomparisons with independently maintained pyrheliometers. There is a high probability that the measured difference is real. Additional observations are required to determine whether the difference results from random fluctuations in solar luminosity, a nonrandom change of short duration, or a sustained change that has climatological significance."
https://openalex.org/W2061009564,"Radon is oxidized between -195° and 25°C by chlorine fluorides, bromine fluorides, iodine heptafluoride, and NiF62- ion in hydrogen fluoride with the formation of stable solutions of radon fluoride. Electromigration studies show that the radon is present as a cation, possibly Rn2+ or RnF+, in several conducting solutions."
https://openalex.org/W2086698431,"Images of the ring of singly ionized sulfur encircling Jupiter obtained on two successive nights in April 1979 show that the ring characteristics may change dramatically in approximately 24 hours. On the first night the ring was narrow and confined to the magnetic equator inside Io's orbit. On the second it was confined symmetrically about the centrifugal symmetry surface and showed considerable radial structure, including a ""fan"" extending to Io's orbit. Many of the differences in the ring on the two nights can be explained in terms of differences in sulfur plasma temperature."

https://openalex.org/W1989226159,"Tectonic tilt at the Salton Sea was calculated by differencing lake-level measurements from two points on the sea. During the past 26 years, tilting was down toward the southeast. By 1970 differential vertical movement amounted to 110 millimeters between two gages situated 38 kilometers apart on the southwest shore. A reversal in tilt direction in late 1972 has diminished the net differential vertical movement to 60 millimeters."

https://openalex.org/W2087087550,"Early reservation annuity censuses and allotment ledgers, analyzed in concert, allow identification of sociologically significant subdivisions of Native American tribes. Using this method, Southern Cheyenne manhao or ""bands"" can be located on the allotment map of 1892 as discrete clusters of individuals known by name, age, and sex. Measurement of linear distances among individual allotments of family members enables us to quantify jural rules of postmarital residence and confirms in a test case that the descendents of the bands at the Sand Creek Massacre in fact resided matrilocally."

https://openalex.org/W1985502813,"The age of a New Zealand specimen generally believed to represent the oldest known penguin, hitherto considered early Eocene (Heretaungan), has been restudied by the New Zealand Geological Survey and is early Miocene. The oldest known penguins are from the late Eocene. The reported great range of a single species, Palaeeudyptes antarcticus, from late Eocene to late Oligocene or early Miocene (Kaiatan to Waitakian) is not acceptable. Dating of some other specimens is less precise than previously reported."
