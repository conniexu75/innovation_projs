https://openalex.org/W2084136419,"An anti-human interleukin 5 receptor (hIL-5R) humanized immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) and an anti-CD20 chimeric IgG1 produced by rat hybridoma YB2/0 cell lines showed more than 50-fold higher antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) using purified human peripheral blood mononuclear cells as effector than those produced by Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell lines. Monosaccharide composition and oligosaccharide profiling analysis showed that low fucose (Fuc) content of complex-type oligosaccharides was characteristic in YB2/0-produced IgG1s compared with high Fuc content of CHO-produced IgG1s. YB2/0-produced anti-hIL-5R IgG1 was subjected to Lens culinaris aggulutin affinity column and fractionated based on the contents of Fuc. The lower Fuc IgG1 had higher ADCC than the IgG1 before separation. In contrast, the content of bisecting GlcNAc of the IgG1 affected ADCC much less than that of Fuc. In addition, the correlation between Gal and ADCC was not observed. When the combined effect of Fuc and bisecting GlcNAc was examined in anti-CD20 IgG1, only a severalfold increase of ADCC was observed by the addition of GlcNAc to highly fucosylated IgG1. Quantitative PCR analysis indicated that YB2/0 cells had lower expression level of FUT8 mRNA, which codes α1,6-fucosyltransferase, than CHO cells. Overexpression of FUT8 mRNA in YB2/0 cells led to an increase of fucosylated oligosaccharides and decrease of ADCC of the IgG1. These results indicate that the lack of fucosylation of IgG1 has the most critical role in enhancement of ADCC, although several reports have suggested the importance of Gal or bisecting GlcNAc and provide important information to produce the effective therapeutic antibody.

ADCC is considered to be a major function of some of the therapeutic antibodies, although antibodies have multiple therapeutic functions (e.g. antigen binding, induction of apoptosis, and complement-dependent cellular cytotoxicity) (1Lewis G.D. Figari I. Fendly B. Wong W.L. Carter P. Gorman C. Shepard H.M. Cancer Immunol. Immunother. 1993; 37: 255-263Google Scholar, 2Clynes R.A. Towers T.L. Presta L.G. Ravetch J.V. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 443-446Google Scholar). One IgG molecule contains two N-linked oligosaccharide sites in its Fc region (3Rademacher T.W. Homans S.W. Perekh R.B. Dwek R.A. Biochem. Soc. Symp. 1986; 51: 131-148Google Scholar). The general structure of N-linked oligosaccharide on IgG is complex-type, characterized by a mannosyl-chitobiose core (Man3GlcNAc2-Asn) with or without bisecting GlcNAc/l-fucose (Fuc) and other chain variants including the presence or absence of Gal and sialic acid. In addition, oligosaccharides may contain zero (G0), one (G1), or two (G2) Gal. Recent studies have shown that engineering the oligosaccharides of IgGs may yield optimized ADCC. ADCC requires the presence of oligosaccharides covalently attached at the conserved Asn297 in the Fc region and is sensitive to change in the oligosaccharide structure. In the oligosaccharide, sialic acid of IgG has no effect on ADCC (4Boyd P.N. Lines A.C. Patel A.K. Mol. Immunol. 1995; 32: 1311-1318Google Scholar). The relationship between the Gal residue and ADCC is controversial. Boyd et al. (4Boyd P.N. Lines A.C. Patel A.K. Mol. Immunol. 1995; 32: 1311-1318Google Scholar) have shown that obvious change was not found in ADCC after removal of the majority of the Gal residues. However, several reports have shown that Gal residues enhance ADCC (5Kumpel B.M. Rademacher T.W. Rook G.A. Williams P.J. Wilson I.B. Hum. Antib. Hybrid. 1994; 5: 143-151Google Scholar, 6Kumpel B.M. Wang Y. Griffiths H.L. Hadley A.G. Rook G.A. Hum. Antib. Hybrid. 1995; 6: 82-88Google Scholar). Several groups have focused on bisecting GlcNAc, which is a β1,4-GlcNAc residue transferred to a core β-mannose (Man) residue, and it has been implicated in biological activity of therapeutic antibodies (7Lifely M.R. Hale C. Boyce S. Keen M.J. Phillips J. Glycobiology. 1995; 5: 813-822Google Scholar). N-Acetylglucosaminyltransferase III (GnTIII), which catalyzes the addition of the bisecting GlcNAc residue to the N-linked oligosaccharide (8Narisimhan S. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 10235-10242Google Scholar), has been expressed in a Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line with an anti-neuroblastoma IgG1 and resulted in greater ADCC (9Umana P. Jean-Mairet J. Moudry R. Amstutz H. Bailey J.E. Nat. Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 176-180Google Scholar). Moreover, expression of GnTIII in a recombinant CHO cell line has led to the increase in ADCC of the anti-CD20 antibody (10Davies J. Jiang L. Pan L.Z. LaBarre M.J. Anderson D. Reff M. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 2001; 74: 288-294Google Scholar). Recently, Shields et al. have revealed the effect of fucosylated oligosaccharide on antibody effector functions, including binding to human FcγR, human C1q, human FcRn, and ADCC (11Shields R.L. Lai J. Keck R. O'Connell L.Y. Hong K. Meng Y.G. Weikert S.H. Presta L.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26733-26740Google Scholar). The Fuc-deficient IgG1s have shown 50-fold increased binding to FcγRIIIa and enhanced ADCC. Nevertheless, there are no data on comparison of the effect of Fuc, Gal, and GlcNAc or the combined effect of Fuc and bisecting GlcNAc. Here, we describe the correlation between glycosylation of human IgG1 and ADCC and demonstrate that Fuc showed the critical role for enhancing ADCC out of several sugar residues reported previously. We unexpectedly found that human IgG1 produced by rat hybridoma YB2/0 cells showed extremely high ADCC at more than 50-fold lower concentration of those produced by CHO cells. YB2/0-produced IgG1 had lower Fuc content than CHO-produced IgG1. IgG1 containing lower fucosylated oligosaccharides, which was fractionated by Lens culinaris aggulutin (LCA) lectin affinity chromatography, showed higher ADCC before separation. In contrast, the addition of bisecting GlcNAc to IgG1 enhanced ADCC much less effectively than defucosylation. The effect of bisecting GlcNAc was only observed in highly fucosylated IgG1. YB2/0 cells expressed a lower level of FUT8 (α1,6-fucosyltransferase gene) mRNA than CHO cells, and overexpression of FUT8 in YB2/0 led the increase of fucosylation of IgG1 and the decrease of ADCC. Rat hybridoma YB2/0 cells were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC; CRL-1662). CHO cell line DG44 (12Urlaub G. Mitchell P.J. Kas E. Chasin L.A. Funanage V.L. Myoda T.T. Hamlin J. Somatic Cell Mol. Genet. 1986; 12: 555-566Google Scholar), for wild type IgG1 production, was kindly provided by Dr. Lawrence Chasin (Columbia University). LEC10, a variant CHO cell line overexpressing GnTIII (13Campbell C. Stanley P. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 13370-13378Google Scholar), was kindly provided by Dr. Pamela Stanley (Albert Einstein College of Medicine). For the generation of human IgG1 of humanized anti-human interleukin-5 receptor (hIL-5R) α-chain and chimeric anti-CD20, the appropriate humanized or murine VL and VH cDNAs were subcloned into the previously described pKANTEX93 vector (14Nakamura K. Tanaka Y. Fujino I. Hirayama N. Shitara K. Hanai N. Mol. Immunol. 2000; 37: 1035-1046Google Scholar). The cDNA coding for the VL and VH region of each antibody was constructed by the PCR-based method (14Nakamura K. Tanaka Y. Fujino I. Hirayama N. Shitara K. Hanai N. Mol. Immunol. 2000; 37: 1035-1046Google Scholar). In the case of chimeric anti-CD20 antibody, the cDNA sequence of each V region was designed as the same with that of RituxanTM (VL: GenBankTM accession number AR015962; VH: GenBankTM accession number AR000013). Establishment of anti-hIL-5R humanized IgG1 will be described elsewhere. 2M. Koike, E. Shoji-Hosaka, K. Nakamura, A. Furuya, K. Shitara, and N. Hanai, manuscript in preparation. Antibody expression vectors were introduced into YB2/0 cells or DG44 cells via electroporation and selected for gene amplification in methotrexate-containing medium (14Nakamura K. Tanaka Y. Fujino I. Hirayama N. Shitara K. Hanai N. Mol. Immunol. 2000; 37: 1035-1046Google Scholar). The anti-hIL-5R IgG1-producing YB2/0 cell line was suspended in GIT medium (Wako, Osaka, Japan) containing 0.5 mg/ml G418 and 200 nm methotrexate to give a density of 3 × 105 cells/ml and dispensed in suspension culture flasks (Greiner, Frickenhausen, Germany). The anti-hIL-5R IgG1-producing CHO cell line was suspended in the EX-CELL302 medium (JRH, Kansas City, MO) containing 3 mml-Gln, 0.5% chemically defined lipid concentrate (Invitrogen), and 0.3% PLURONIC F-68 (Invitrogen) to give a density of 3 × 105 cells/ml and cultured using spinner flasks (Asahi Techno Glass, Tokyo, Japan) under agitating at a rate of 100 rpm. The anti-CD20 IgG1-producing YB2/0 cell line was suspended in the hybridoma-SFM medium (Invitrogen) containing 5% Daigo's GF21 (Wako) and 200 nm methotrexate to give a density of 1 × 105 cells/ml and dispensed in suspension culture flasks. The flasks were incubated under conditions of 37 °C in humid air containing 5% CO2. After 8 or 10 days of incubation, the culture supernatants were recovered. The culture supernatants containing anti-hIL-5R IgG1 from YB2/0 cells and CHO cells and anti-CD20 IgG1 from YB2/0 cells were clarified by centrifugation and passed through a 0.2-μm filter. The IgG1 bound to a PROSEP-A (Millipore) column was eluted with 0.1 m citrate buffer (pH 3.5). Then the antibody was subjected to a Sephacryl S-300 (Amersham Biosciences) column. The buffer composition of the YB2/0-produced anti-CD20 IgG1 was changed to that for RituxanTM (9.0 mg/ml sodium chloride, 7.35 mg/ml sodium citrate dihydrate, 0.7 mg/ml polysorbate 80). The purity of IgG1 was confirmed by SDS-PAGE. YB2/0- and CHO-produced humanized anti-hIL-5R IgG1 were designated as KM8399 and KM8404, respectively. YB2/0-produced chimeric anti-CD20 IgG1 was designated as KM3065. RituxanTM (chimeric mouse/human anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody derived from the CHO cell line) was purchased from Genentech (South San Francisco, CA)/IDEC Pharmaceutical (San Diego, CA). An ADCC assay was performed by 51Cr release assay as reported previously (15Ohta S. Honda A. Tokutake Y. Yoshida H. Hanai N. Cancer Immunol. Immunother. 1993; 36: 260-266Google Scholar). Briefly, target cells (1 × 106), a murine T cell line CTLL-2 (h5R) expressing hIL-5R α-chain and β-chain (16Takaki S. Murata Y. Kitamura T. Miyajima A. Tominaga A. Takatsu K. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 177: 1523-1529Google Scholar), were labeled with 3.7 MBq of Na251CrO4 at 37 °C for 1.5 h. Human effector cells were peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) purified from healthy donors using Polymorphprep (Nycomed Pharma AS, Roskilde, Norway). Aliquots of the 51Cr-labeled target cells were dispensed into 96-well U-bottomed plates (1 × 104/50 μl) and incubated with serial dilutions of antibodies (50 μl) in the presence of human effector cells (100 μl) at an E/T ratio of 90/1. After 4 h of incubation at 37 °C, the plates were centrifuged, and the radioactivity in the supernatants was measured using a γ counter. The percentage of specific cytolysis was calculated from the counts of samples according to the formula, %specific lysis=100×(E−S)/(M−S)Equation 1 where E represents the experimental release (cpm in the supernatant from target cells incubated with antibody and effector cells), S is the spontaneous release (cpm in the supernatant from target cells incubated with medium alone), and M is the maximum release (cpm released from target cells lysed with 1 mol/liter HCl). An ADCC assay was performed by a lactate dehydrogenase release assay. Aliquots of target cells, a human B lymphoma cell line Raji (number 9012, purchased from JCRB, Tokyo, Japan), were distributed into 96-well U-bottomed plates (1 × 104/50 μl) and incubated with serial dilutions of antibodies (50 μl) in the presence of human effector cells (100 μl) at an E/T ratio of 25:1 or 20:1. Human effector cells were PBMC purified from healthy donors using Lymphoprep (Axis Shield, Dundee, UK). After a 4-h incubation at 37 °C, the plate was centrifuged, and the lactate dehydrogenase activity in the supernatants was measured using a nonradioactive cytotoxicity assay kit (Promega, Madison, WI). The percentage of specific cytolysis was calculated from the activities of samples according to the formula, %specific lysis=100×(E−SE−ST)/(M−ST)Equation 2 where E represents the experimental release (activity in the supernatant from target cells incubated with antibody and effector cells), S E is the spontaneous release in the presence of effector cells (activity in the supernatant from effector cells), S T is the spontaneous release of target cells (activity in the supernatant from target cells incubated with medium alone), and M is the maximum release of target cells (activity released from target cells lysed with 9% Triton X-100). Oligosaccharides were prepared from 100 μg of IgG1 by hydrazinolysis and N-acetylation by the methods reported previously (17Hase S. Ibuki T. Ikenaka T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1984; 95: 197-203Google Scholar). Oligosaccharides were pyridylaminated (17Hase S. Ibuki T. Ikenaka T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1984; 95: 197-203Google Scholar) and analyzed by reverse-phase HPLC using a Shim-pack CLC-ODS column (60 × 150 mm; Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) (18Takahashi N. Hotta T. Ishihara H. Mori M. Tejima S. Bligny R. Akazawa T. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 388-395Google Scholar) with slight modifications. Elution was performed at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min at 55 °C using two solvents, A and B. Solvent A was 10 mmsodium phosphate buffer (pH 3.8), and solvent B was 10 mmsodium phosphate buffer (pH 3.8) containing 0.5% 1-butanol (Sigma). The column was equilibrated with solvent A. After injection of sample, the ratio of solvent B to A was increased with a linear gradient to 60:40 in 80 min. The elution profile was monitored by fluorescence detection with excitation at 320 nm and emission at 400 nm. The oligosaccharide peak assignments were made according to retention time comparison with PA-labeled oligosaccharide standards (TaKaRa Bio, Otsu, Japan). The peak area was used to calculate the percentage of each oligosaccharide, since the relative fluorescence was the same on a molar basis for each component (17Hase S. Ibuki T. Ikenaka T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1984; 95: 197-203Google Scholar). To identify the structure, each oligosaccharide fraction that separated as a peak was collected and evaporated to dryness under vacuum prior to matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Monosaccharides were released from an aliquoted quantity of IgG1 by heating with 4m trifluoroacetic acid at 100 °C for 2 h. Monosaccharides were dried under vacuum and reconstituted in water prior to high performance anion exchange chromatography analysis. Monosaccharides were analyzed using a waveform and DX500 system (DIONEX, Sunnyvale, CA) described previously (19McGuire J.M. Douglas M. Smith K.D. Carbohydr. Res. 1996; 292: 1-9Google Scholar). A CarboPac PA-1 column (DIONEX) was used to resolve monosaccharides with a flow rate of 0.8 ml/min at 35 °C. After injection of samples, the monosaccharides were resolved with 18 mm NaOH for 30 min, and the column was regenerated by elution with 500 mm NaOH for 10 min. The column was held 18 mm NaOH for 30 min prior to the next injection. LCA or Phaseolus vulgaris E4 (PHA-E4) were used as ligands of lectin affinity HPLC for separation of IgG1 based on the content of Fuc or bisecting GlcNAc, respectively. An LA-LCA (4.6 × 150 mm; HONEN, Tokyo, Japan) column was installed in the LC-6A HPLC system (Shimadzu). Purified antibodies dissolved in 10 mmKH2PO4 were applied to the column previously equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-H2SO4(pH 7.3). The column was eluted with a linear gradient of the buffer containing 0.2 mα-methyl-d-mannoside (Nacalai Tesque, Kyoto, Japan) in 60 min. An LA-PHA-E4 (4.6 × 150 mm; HONEN) column was installed in the LC-6A HPLC system (Shimadzu). Purified antibodies were applied to the column, previously equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-H2SO4 (pH 8.0) (A buffer). The column was eluted with the buffer containing 0.1 mK2B4O7 (B buffer). Elution was followed by linear gradients from 0 to 58% B buffer in 35 min and then 100% B buffer for 5 min. The column was equilibrated with 100% A buffer for 20 min before the next injection. Each chromatography was performed at room temperature and a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. A mammalian expression vector, pAGE249, which was derived by excision of a 2.7-kbSphI-SphI fragment containing the dihydrofolate reductase gene expression cassette from pAGE249 (20Sasaki K. Kurata K. Funayama K. Nagata M. Watanabe E. Ohta S. Hanai N. Nishi T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14730-14737Google Scholar), was employed. This plasmid contained a hygromycin-resistant gene driven by the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase gene promoter. The murine FUT8 cDNA (1728 bp) (21Hayashi H. Yoneda A. Asada M. Ikekita M. Imamura T. DNA Seq. 2000; 11: 91-96Google Scholar) was inserted into pAGE248 under the control of the Moloney murine leukemia virus 3′-LTR promoter to form a plasmid designated as pAGEmfFUT8. Two FspI restriction sites located within the plasmid backbone enabled linearization of the expression vector construct, prior to transfection of cells. FUT8 expression vector, pAGEmfFUT8, was introduced into anti-CD20-IgG1-producing YB2/0 cells via electroporation, and FUT8-overexpressing YB2/0 cells, 3065ft8–72, were selected in 0.5 mg/ml hygromycin-B (Sigma)-containing medium. Total RNA was isolated from 1.0 × 107 YB2/0 cells, FUT8-overexpressing YB2/0 cells, or CHO/DG44 cells using the RNeasy minikit (Qiagen, Tokyo, Japan) and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C with 20 units of RNase-free DNase (RQ1; Promega) to degrade genomic DNA. After DNA digestion, the total RNA was purified again using the RNeasy minikit. The single-strand cDNA was synthesized from 3 μg of each total RNA using the Superscript first strand synthesis system for RT-PCR (Invitrogen). The 50-fold diluted reaction mixture was used as a template for the following competitive RT-PCR. Quantification of FUT8 transcripts was carried out using competitive RT-PCR in which a 979-bp partial fragment of rat FUT8 cDNA was used as a standard DNA and a 772-bp fragment deleting a 207-bp ScaI (blunt)-HindIII (blunt) fragment from standard DNA was used as a competitor. Standard DNA was amplified from single-stranded cDNAs of YB2/0 cells by PCR using primers 5′-ACTCATCTTGGAATCTCAGAATTGG-3′ and 5′-CTTGACCGTTTCTATCTTCTCTCG-3′. PCRs for detection of FUT8 were carried out by heating at 94 °C for 3 min and subsequent 32 cycles of 94 °C for 1 min, 60 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min in 20 μl of reaction mixture containing 5 μl of the 50-fold diluted single-stranded cDNA, 10 fg of linearized competitors, 10 pmol of FUT8-specific primers, 4 nmol of dNTP mixture, 5% dimethyl sulfoxide, and ExTaq polymerase (Takara Bio). The sense primer 5′-GTCCATGGTGATCCTGCAGTGTGG-3′ and antisense primer 5′-CACCAATGATATCTCCAGGTTCC-3′ were employed to amplify an FUT8 fragment. Aliquots of PCR products (7 μl) were subjected to electrophoresis in 1.75% agarose gel and stained with SYBR Green I nucleic gel stain (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR). The amount of products was quantified by measuring luminescence intensity using a FluoroImager SI (Amersham Biosciences), calculated from standard curves, and converted into molar numbers. To normalize the synthesis efficiency of first-strand cDNAs, the amount of β-actin transcripts was also quantified by competitive RT-PCR in which a 1128-bp partial fragment of rat β-actin cDNA was used as a standard DNA and a 948-bp fragment deleting a 180-bpDraIII (blunt)-DraIII (blunt) fragment from standard DNA as a competitor were employed. Standard DNA was amplified from single-stranded cDNAs of YB2/0 cells by PCR using primers 5′-ATTTAAGGTACCGAAGCATTTGCGGTGCACGATGGAGGGG-3′ and 5′-AAGTATAAGCTTACATGGATGACGATATCGCTGCGCTCGT-3′. PCRs for detection of β-actin were carried out by heating at 94 °C for 3 min and subsequent 17 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 65 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 2 min in 20 μl of reaction mixture containing 5 μl of the 50-fold single-stranded cDNAs, 1 pg of linearized competitors, 10 pmol of β-actin-specific primers, 4 nmol of dNTP mixture, 5% dimethyl sulfoxide, and ExTaq polymerase (TakaRa Bio). The sense primer 5′-GATATCTGCTGCGCTCGTCGTCGAC-3′ and antisense primer 5′-CAGGAAGGAAGGCTGGAAGAGAGC-3′ were designed to amplify an β-actin fragment. Aliquots of PCR products (7 μl) were subjected to electrophoresis in 1.75% agarose gel for analysis. The purified humanized anti-hIL-5R IgG1 antibodies, KM8399 (YB2/0-produced) and KM8404 (CHO-produced), were compared for their ability to induce ADCC against a murine T cell line CTLL-2 (h5R) expressing hIL-5R α-chain and β-chain. Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells were used as effector cells for ADCC. Both humanized KM8399 and KM8404 showed high affinity to the soluble hIL-5R α-chain antigen and had no differences in antigen binding in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (data not shown). In contrast, the ADCC of KM8399 was ∼50-fold higher than that of KM8404 at the concentration of antibody of 25% cytotoxicity that was the maximum activity of KM8404 (Fig. 1 A), indicating that YB2/0-produced IgG1 promoted killing of IL-5R-positive cells at an ∼50-fold lower concentration than the CHO-produced IgG1. To confirm the reproducibility of this result, we assessed the ADCC of another antibody, chimeric anti-CD20 IgG1. RituxanTM was CHO-produced chimeric anti-CD20 IgG1 approved as a therapeutic agent in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. We originally established YB2/0-produced chimeric anti-CD20 IgG1, KM3065, that had the same V region amino acid sequences as RituxanTM. Both chimeric RituxanTMand KM3065 exhibited the same antigen binding activity in flow cytometric analysis using CD20-positive cell lines (data not shown). On the other hand, the ADCC of KM3065 was at least 100-fold higher than that of RituxanTM at the concentration of antibody of 20% cytotoxicity that was the maximum activity of RituxanTM (Fig. 1 B). Moreover, the maximum cytotoxicity of YB2/0-produced KM8399 and KM3065 was 2–3-fold higher than that of CHO-produced KM8404 and RituxanTM, respectively (Fig. 1, A and B). To elucidate the molecular basis of the difference of ADCC between YB2/0- and CHO-produced IgG1, we analyzed the protein portion and oligosaccharide portion of KM8399 and KM8404. There was no significant difference in SDS-PAGE, peptide mapping, and CD (data not shown), suggesting the importance of oligosaccharides for controlling ADCC. Hydrazinolysis-derived oligosaccharides were labeled with 2-aminopyrizine and separated by HPLC (Fig. 2, A and B). As shown in Fig. 2, A and B, peak patterns and content of oligosaccharide between YB2/0-produced KM8399 and CHO-produced KM8404 were quite different. KM8399 contained nine major oligosaccharides (peaks a, b, c, e, f, g, h, k, and l); in contrast, KM8404 contains five major oligosaccharides (peaks a, e, f, g, and h). The oligosaccharide structure of each peak is shown in Fig. 2 C, and all structures have been found in human IgGN-linked oligosaccharides as natural structures (22Takahashi N. Ishii I. Ishihara H. Mori M. Tejima S. Jefferis R. Endo S. Arata Y. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 1137-1144Google Scholar,23Parekh R.B. Dwek R.A. Sutton B.J. Fernandes D.L. Leung A. Stanworth D. Rademacher T.W. Mizuochi T. Taniguchi T. Matsuda K. Takeuchi F. Nagano Y. Miyamoto T. Kobata A. Nature. 1985; 316: 452-457Google Scholar). To clear the difference of oligosaccharides found in Fig. 2, quantitative monosaccharide compositions of IgG1s were determined (Table I). The contents of Fuc, Gal, and GlcNAc were different between YB2/0-produced IgG1s and CHO-produced IgG1s. KM8399 and KM3065 (YB2/0-produced) contained 0.8- and 0.09-fold lower content of Fuc than KM8404 and RituxanTM(CHO-produced), respectively. In contrast, the two YB2/0-produced IgG1s showed a higher content of GlcNAc than the two CHO-produced IgG1s. The difference in the content of Gal between YB2/0-produced IgG1s and CHO-produced IgG1s was not consistent. These results suggest the difference of ADCC between YB2/0-produced IgG1s and CHO-produced IgG1s is caused by that of oligosaccharide structure, especially Fuc- and/or GlcNAc-containing oligosaccharides.Table IMonosaccharide composition of IgGlsIgGlCell lineFucGalGlcNAcMan1-aMolar ratios calculatedversus 3 mannoses.KM8399YB2/00.721.014.513KM8404CHO0.910.273.803KM3065YB2/00.080.314.413Rituxan™CHO0.940.543.9831-a Molar ratios calculatedversus 3 mannoses.

https://openalex.org/W2100325414,"DNA methylation plays an important role in mammalian development and correlates with chromatin-associated gene silencing. The recruitment of MeCP2 to methylated CpG dinucleotides represents a major mechanism by which DNA methylation can repress transcription. MeCP2 silences gene expression partly by recruiting histone deacetylase (HDAC) activity, resulting in chromatin remodeling. Here, we show that MeCP2 associates with histone methyltransferase activity in vivo and that this activity is directed against Lys9 of histone H3. Two characterized repression domains of MeCP2 are involved in tethering the histone methyltransferase to MeCP2. We asked if MeCP2 can deliver Lys9 H3 methylation to the H19 gene, whose activity it represses. We show that the presence of MeCP2 on nucleosomes within the repressor region of the H19 gene (the differentially methylated domain) coincides with an increase in H3 Lys9methylation. Our data provide evidence that MeCP2 reinforces a repressive chromatin state by acting as a bridge between two global epigenetic modifications, DNA methylation and histone methylation.

Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 6-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (5448) Google Scholar). DNA methylation represses genes partly by recruitment of methyl-CpG-binding domain proteins, which selectively recognize methylated CpG dinucleotides. MeCP2 is the founder member of the methyl-CpG-binding domain proteins, which consists of a single polypeptide that contains a methyl-CpG-binding domain and a transcriptional repression domain. MeCP2 is capable of binding to a single symmetrically methylated CpG both in naked DNA and within chromatin (2Lewis J.D. Meehan R.R. Henzel W.J. Maurer-Fogy I. Jeppesen P. Klein F. Bird A. Cell. 1992; 69: 905-914Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1083) Google Scholar, 3Nan X. Campoy F.J. Bird A. Cell. 1997; 88: 471-481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1036) Google Scholar). It is now well established that MeCP2 silences transcription by recruiting the histone deacetylase (HDAC)1 repressive machinery, which removes acetyl groups from histones resulting in gene silencing (4Nan X., Ng, H.H. Johnson C.A. Laherty C.D. Turner B.M. Eisenman R.N. Bird A. Nature. 1998; 393: 386-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (2789) Google Scholar, 5Jones P.L. Veenstra G.J. Wade P.A. Vermaak D. Kass S.U. Landsberger N. Strouboulis J. Wolffe A.P. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 187-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (2243) Google Scholar). However, the inhibition of histone deacetylase activity using drugs such as Trichostatin A only partially relieves MeCP2-mediated transcriptional repression. This partial relief indicates that additional mechanisms of repression by MeCP2 likely exist aside from the recruitment of histone deacetylase. Beside histone deacetylation, histone methylation is emerging as another key post-translational modification of histones and represents an important epigenetic mechanism for the organization of chromatin structure and the regulation of gene expression. In particular, methylation at lysine 9 of histone H3 is associated with gene silencing, and several enzymes that catalyze the addition of methyl groups to lysine 9 have recently been identified (6Kouzarides T. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2002; 12: 198-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (748) Google Scholar). Interestingly, recent data have shown that the retinoblastoma protein represses transcription through the recruitment of HDAC activity, but in a second step it recruits histone methylation activity specific for lysine 9 of histone H3 (7Nielsen S.J. Schneider R. Bauer U.M. Bannister A.J. Morrison A. O'Carroll D. Firestein R. Cleary M. Jenuwein T. Herrera R.E. Kouzarides T. Nature. 2001; 412: 561-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar). By analogy to retinoblastoma, we considered in the present work whether MeCP2-mediated repression might also include, besides histone deacetylation, a second stage involving histone methylation. Here, we show that MeCP2 associates with histone methylation in vitro as well as in vivo. The MeCP2-associated methylation activity is found to be specific for lysine 9 of histone H3. By means of chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) experiments, we show that MeCP2 facilitates H3 Lys9 methylation of the H19 gene, a bona fide MeCP2-regulated gene. Our results indicate that MeCP2 acts as a mechanistic bridge between DNA methylation and histone methylation and thus reinforce the repressive function of these two distinct methylation events. We cloned MeCP2 1–77 into the pGEX vector (Pharmacia) by PCR using the appropriate sets of primers. The other pGEX expression vectors for full-length and deletion mutants of MeCP2 have been described previously (8Nan X. Meehan R.R. Bird A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 4886-4892Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). The HA-tagged mammalian expression construct of MeCP2 (HA-MeCP2) was generated by insertion of a synthetic oligonucleotide encoding the HA epitope sequence into the 5′ end of MeCP2 cDNA in frame in pBluescriptSK− based vector p65Δ (8Nan X. Meehan R.R. Bird A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 4886-4892Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). pCMV-HA-MeCP2 was constructed by insertion of theNotI/EcoRI-restricted fragment encoding HA-MeCP2 into the BamHI site of pCMV-Bam-Neo vector such that the CMV promoter drives HA-MeCP2 expression. pTRE-MeCP2 was constructed by insertion of the EcoRI-restricted HA-MeCP2 fragment from pCMV-HA-MeCP2 into the EcoRI site of pTRE (Clontech). pTRE-HA-MeCP2/Zeo was constructed by insertion of a BamHI/BglII-restricted Zeocin resistance cassette from pZeo/SV (Invitrogen) into the XhoI site of pTRE-HA-MeCP2. L929 mouse fibroblast cells (L cells) were co-transfected with pTet-Off and pTRE-HA-MeCP2/Zeo by electroporation. The cells were placed under selection for G418-resistance and Zeocin-resistance after 24 h following transfection. G418/Zeocin-resistant cell lines were tested for background and induced expression of HA-MeCP2 in the presence and absence of tetracycline, respectively. Expression was detected by anti-HA and anti-MeCP2 antibodies on Western blots. Clone L-4 did not express detectable HA-MeCP2 background but was strongly inducible by tetracycline withdrawal. Mouse MeCP2 Tet-Off fibroblasts (L cells) were grown to 75% confluence in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% tetracycline-free fetal calf serum (Clontech) at 37 °C, 5% CO2. Cells were then treated or not with 5 μg/ml tetracycline (Sigma) and harvested 1 or 3 days later. 293T cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and grown at 37 °C, 5% CO2. For transfection of 293T, we seeded ∼2–3 × 106 cells on the evening prior to procedure. We transfected cells with a total of 20 μg of DNA using the calcium phosphate co-precipitation method. The precipitate was washed off 10 h after transfection and incubated for an additional 24 h before harvesting. Wild type and Mecp2 −/y mouse cells (9Guy J. Hendrich B. Holmes M. Martin J.E. Bird A. Nat. Genet. 2001; 27: 322-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (1222) Google Scholar) were grown essentially as described before in modified Eagle's medium alpha and 10% fetal calf serum and grown at 37 °C, 5% CO2. We expressed GST and GST fusion proteins in Escherichia coliXA90 using the pGEX (Pharmacia) vector system and purified protein from crude bacterial lysates according to the manufacturer's instructions. We performed pull-down assays by incubating GST or GST fusion proteins prebound to glutathione beads (Pharmacia) with HeLa nuclear extracts (50 μl) in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (200 μl; 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, and 0.1% SDS). The incubation was performed at 4 °C for 12 h. The beads were then washed four times in 1 ml of radioimmune precipitation assay buffer before processing to histone methyltransferase assays. For immunoprecipitations prior to histone methyltransferase assays, antibodies against HA (12C5A, Roche), MeCP2 (07–013, Upstate Biotechnology), or green fluorescence protein (Abcam, ab290) were used. Extracts from transfected 293T cells that were lysed in IPH buffer (10Bannister A.J. Kouzarides T. Nature. 1996; 384: 641-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (1533) Google Scholar) or HeLa nuclear extracts (50 μl, Computer Cell Culture Centre, Mons, Belgium) were incubated with the relevant antibodies overnight at 4 °C. Antibody complexes were collected on protein A/G-Sepharose beads, washed four times in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer, and assayed for histone methyltransferase assays. Precipitations from pull downs or immunoprecipitations from HeLa nuclear extract or 293T transfected extracts were incubated with either 10 μg of histones (Sigma) or 5 μg of recombinant H3 (gift from Karl Nightingale) and 2 μl [3H-Me]-S-adenosyl methionine (AmershamBiosciences, 67 Ci mmol−1) in buffer MAB (50 mm Tris, pH 8.5, 20 mm KCl, 10 mmMgCl2, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 250 mm w/v sucrose) at 30 °C for 4 h. The reaction products were then resolved by SDS-PAGE, Western blotted, and autoradiography was performed. The position of radiolabeled H3 was identified by its size using radiolabeled molecular weight markers (Amersham Biosciences) as well as by comparing the autoradiography with the gel stained with Ponceau. For N-terminal sequencing, radiolabeled histone H3 was blotted to polyvinylidene difluoride (Millipore) and sequenced by Edman degradation (Protein Sequencing Facility, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK). Amino acid fractions were analyzed for the presence of tritium by scintillation counting. Western blotting from MeCP2 Tet-Off cells were done as described (11Fuks F. Burgers W.A. Brehm A. Hughes-Davies L. Kouzarides T. Nat. Genet. 2000; 24: 88-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (820) Google Scholar) using MeCP2 antibody (07–013, Upstate Biotechnology). Total RNA was isolated from wild type and Mecp2 −/y mouse cells (9Guy J. Hendrich B. Holmes M. Martin J.E. Bird A. Nat. Genet. 2001; 27: 322-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (1222) Google Scholar) following the Qiagen RNeasy Midi protocol. Purified RNA (0.5 μg) was used for quantitative RT-PCR, following the Qiagen One Step protocol, for 28 PCR cycles. MeCP2 Tet-Off cells treated or not with tetracycline were cross-linked with 0.75% formaldehyde (Sigma) at room temperature for 10 min. Cells were rinsed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4) and collected in phosphate-buffered saline and centrifuged for 5 min at 1200 rpm. ChIPs were then performed as described (12Dedon P.C. Soults J.A. Allis C.D. Gorovsky M.A. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 197: 83-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 13Orlando V. Strutt H. Paro R. Methods. 1997; 11: 205-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar) with either 4 μl of anti-H3 methyl Lys9 (MeK9, Abcam, ab7658) or 4 μl of an affinity-purified unrelated antibody (raised against the N terminus of the nuclear import factor RCH1) or 5 μl of anti-MeCP2 (Upstate Biotechnology 07–013) or 5 μl of an affinity-purified unrelated antibody (anti-HA, Upstate Biotechnology 06–831). The specificity for anti-MeK9 H3 has been reported previously (7Nielsen S.J. Schneider R. Bauer U.M. Bannister A.J. Morrison A. O'Carroll D. Firestein R. Cleary M. Jenuwein T. Herrera R.E. Kouzarides T. Nature. 2001; 412: 561-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitations were analyzed by PCR for the presence of the H19 DMD-encompassing fragment. Amplification of the H19 DMD region was performed using primer pairs at positions −2892 bp versus start site to −2137. The cycle number and the amount of template were varied to ensure that results were within the linear range of the PCR. Silencing of transcription by MeCP2 involves the recruitment of HDAC activity (4Nan X., Ng, H.H. Johnson C.A. Laherty C.D. Turner B.M. Eisenman R.N. Bird A. Nature. 1998; 393: 386-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (2789) Google Scholar, 5Jones P.L. Veenstra G.J. Wade P.A. Vermaak D. Kass S.U. Landsberger N. Strouboulis J. Wolffe A.P. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 187-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (2243) Google Scholar). However, additional pathways by which MeCP2 represses transcription probably exist because HDAC inhibitors do not completely relieve MeCP2-mediated silencing (4Nan X., Ng, H.H. Johnson C.A. Laherty C.D. Turner B.M. Eisenman R.N. Bird A. Nature. 1998; 393: 386-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (2789) Google Scholar, 5Jones P.L. Veenstra G.J. Wade P.A. Vermaak D. Kass S.U. Landsberger N. Strouboulis J. Wolffe A.P. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 187-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (2243) Google Scholar). The retinoblastoma protein represses transcription not only through recruitment of HDAC activity but also through recruitment of histone methylation activity specific for lysine 9 of histone H3 (7Nielsen S.J. Schneider R. Bauer U.M. Bannister A.J. Morrison A. O'Carroll D. Firestein R. Cleary M. Jenuwein T. Herrera R.E. Kouzarides T. Nature. 2001; 412: 561-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar). These recent observations prompted us to ask whether histone methylation might represent another pathway by which MeCP2 silences transcription. To test this possibility we first asked if MeCP2 associates with histone methyltransferase activity. Fig. 1 A shows that MeCP2 fused to GST is able to purify from nuclear extracts, an activity that specifically methylates histone H3 from a mixture of bulk histones. Recombinant histone H3 can also be used as the substrate for the methyltransferase associated with GST MeCP2 (Fig. 1 B). Deletion analysis of MeCP2 indicates that the association of MeCP2 with histone H3 methyltransferase activity is primarily mediated by its N-terminal portion, which overlaps with its methyl-CpG-binding domain (Fig. 1 C). In addition, the more C-terminal region of MeCP2, 108–392, that contains the transcriptional repression domain also contributes to the binding of enzymatic activity (Fig. 1 C). To further verify the association of MeCP2 with a methyltransferase, we used a co-immunoprecipitation approach. We transfected mammalian cells with an HA-tagged, full-length MeCP2 (HA-MeCP2), lysed the cells, and carried out precipitation with anti-HA antibody. The resulting immunoprecipitate was assayed for the presence of methyltransferase activity on histones. Fig. 2 A (lane 1) indicates that HA-MeCP2 purifies activity specific for histone H3. When endogenous MeCP2 was immunoprecipitated from HeLa nuclear extracts with a MeCP2-specific antibody, the association with the histone H3 methyltransferase was also detected (Fig. 2 B, lane 1). Control immunoprecipitation with an irrelevant antibody (green fluorescence protein) gave background activity (Fig. 2 B,lane 2). Together, these results demonstrate that MeCP2 is associated with a histone methyltransferase in vivo and that this enzyme specifically methylates histone H3. We next wanted to identify the residue(s) of histone H3 that are modified by the MeCP2-interacting methyltransferase. Given that a tailless recombinant H3 did not act as a substrate (data not shown), histone H3 radioactively methylated by the MeCP2-interacting methyltransferase was put through Edman degradation to identify the methylation site in the H3 tail. Protein sequence analysis revealed that MeCP2 binds histone methyltransferase activity that is specific for lysine 9 of histone H3 (H3 Lys9; Fig. 3). The nature of the MeCP2-interacting histone Lys9 methyltransferase is currently unknown. So far five mammalian H3 Lys9 methyltransferases have been identified: SuvarH1 (14Lachner M. O'Carroll D. Rea S. Mechtler K. Jenuwein T. Nature. 2001; 410: 116-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (2177) Google Scholar), SuvarH2 (15O'Carroll D. Scherthan H. Peters A.H. Opravil S. Haynes A.R. Laible G. Rea S.

Science. 2002; 296: 1132-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar), and several others are predicted to exist (6Kouzarides T. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2002; 12: 198-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (748) Google Scholar). We next wanted to assess whether MeCP2 can facilitate H3 Lys9 methylation of a DNA-methylated gene that it regulates. We chose to investigate the H19 gene because it contains a characterized repressor domain in its upstream regulatory region, (the DMD), which is known to be DNA-methylated (19Tremblay K.D. Duran K.L. Bartolomei M.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4322-4329Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar) and associated with MeCP2 (20Drewell R.A. Goddard C.J. Thomas J.O. Surani M.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 1139-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). To establish whether MeCP2 represses transcription of H19in vivo, we monitored the expression of H19 in wild type and knock-out Mecp2 −/y cells (9Guy J. Hendrich B. Holmes M. Martin J.E. Bird A. Nat. Genet. 2001; 27: 322-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (1222) Google Scholar). RNA isolated from each cell type was reverse transcribed and amplified by polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Fig. 4 Ashows that H19 messenger RNA levels are elevated in the MeCP2 knock-out cells compared with wild type cells. In contrast, the expression of an unrelated house-keeping gene, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, is unchanged (Fig. 4 A). Thus, H19 is a bona fide MeCP2-regulated gene that can be used to analyze MeCP2 functions. To establish if MeCP2 delivers H3 methylation to the H19 gene we next examined the wild type and knock-out Mecp2 −/y cells for differential histone methylation at the H19 DMD. An antibody that recognizes histone H3 when methylated at lysine 9 was used in ChIPs. The outcome of these experiments was not conclusive because the chromatin isolated from the Mecp2 −/y knock-out cells was qualitatively different from wild type controls. Indeed, purification followed by fragmentation (by sonication or nuclease digestion) of the chromatin from the MeCP2 null and wild type cells consistently resulted in different size fragments upon analysis on agarose gel electrophoresis. So direct quantification and comparison between the two chromatin sets was not possible. We therefore turned to an inducible Tet-Off cell line, where the levels of MeCP2 could be manipulated by the addition of tetracycline (Tc). In this Tet-Off cell line, the presence of tetracycline reduces MeCP2 expression down to endogenous levels (Fig. 4 B). Using this Tet-Off MeCP2 cell line, we performed ChIPs analysis on the H19 DMD using the MeCP2 antibody and the methyl lysine 9 H3-specific antibody. Fig. 4 C shows that in the absence of Tc, when MeCP2 expression is high, MeCP2 binds to nucleosomes associated with the DMD (Fig. 4 C, lane 1). This MeCP2 binding is specific because immunoprecipitations of the cross-linked chromatin with an irrelevant antibody or with the beads only gave background signal (Fig. 4 C, lanes 2 and 3). In contrast, when MeCP2 levels are low, in the presence of Tc, the binding of MeCP2 is reduced considerably (Fig 4 C, lane 4). These results indicate that the manipulation of MeCP2 levels in the Tet-Off cell line results in differential binding of MeCP2 to the H19 DMD. We then monitored the levels of Me-Lys9 H3 on the nucleosomes associated with the H19 DMD. As shown in Fig. 4 D(lane 1), it is clear that the DMD is methylated at Lys9 when MeCP2 levels are high. If MeCP2 was required for H3 Lys9 methylation on the H19 DMD, then down-regulation of MeCP2 cellular level should result in a reduced histone H3 methylation. Fig. 4 D shows that under conditions in which the MeCP2 level is low (i.e. in the presence of Tc), nucleosomes within the H19 DMD show a significant reduction in histone H3 Lys9methylation (Fig. 4 D, compare lane 4 withlane 1). These results indicate that the presence of MeCP2 on the H19 gene correlates with the appearance of histone H3 Lys9 methylation at the differentially DNA-methylated and repressive DMD region of the H19 gene. The present study provides evidence that the targeting of histone methylation to DNA methylated regulatory regions is part of the mechanism by which MeCP2 functions. To date, MeCP2 action is known to involve the delivery of histone deacetylase activity. However, this mechanism cannot account for the full repressive potential of MeCP2 because inhibitors of histone deacetylase activity only relieve repression partially (4Nan X., Ng, H.H. Johnson C.A. Laherty C.D. Turner B.M. Eisenman R.N. Bird A. Nature. 1998; 393: 386-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (2789) Google Scholar, 5Jones P.L. Veenstra G.J. Wade P.A. Vermaak D. Kass S.U. Landsberger N. Strouboulis J. Wolffe A.P. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 187-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (2243) Google Scholar). Thus the delivery of histone methylating activity by MeCP2 may represent a repressive event that follows the targeting of deacetylases. This order of events is suggested by the fact that deacetylation of histone H3 at lysine 9 is necessary for methylation to take place on this residue (21Rea S. Eisenhaber F. O'Carroll D. Strahl B.D. Sun Z.W. Schmid M. Opravil S. Mechtler K. Ponting C.P. Allis C.D. Jenuwein T. Nature. 2000; 406: 593-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (2186) Google Scholar). In this way, deacetylation of histone 3 at lysine 9 would be followed by methylation, which in turn may result in the recruitment of proteins such as HP1 (14Lachner M. O'Carroll D. Rea S. Mechtler K. Jenuwein T. Nature. 2001; 410: 116-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (2177) Google Scholar, 22Bannister A.J. Zegerman P. Partridge J.F. Miska E.A. Thomas J.O. Allshire R.C. Kouzarides T. Nature. 2001; 410: 120-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (2184) Google Scholar). The identity of the lysine methyltransferase associated with MeCP2 is unknown, but members of a family of lysine 9-methylating proteins can be considered candidates (6Kouzarides T. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2002; 12: 198-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (748) Google Scholar). The data presented here identify MeCP2 as a protein that can connect a repressive modification on DNA to a repressive modification on histones. Recent evidence from Neurospora crassa andArabidopsis thaliana indicate that the reverse is also possible: methylation of histone H3 at lysine 9 leads to methylation of DNA (23Tamaru H. Selker E.U. Nature. 2001; 414: 277-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (856) Google Scholar, 24Jackson J.P. Lindroth A.M. Cao X. Jacobsen S.E. Nature. 2002; 416: 556-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (1019) Google Scholar). If we assume that this latter mechanism is also operational in mammalian cells, our data suggest that MeCP2 may set up a self-reinforcing cycle of repression, which may be necessary for the maintenance and heritability of the repressed state. In other words, by promoting further rounds of DNA methylation following histone methylation, MeCP2 would maintain the methylation status at the DMD and thus distinguish the “permanent” repressive state of imprinted promoters from the “regulated” repressive state of other promoters.

https://openalex.org/W1983313606,"Latent transforming growth factor β-binding protein 1 (LTBP-1) targets latent complexes of transforming growth factor β to the extracellular matrix, where the latent cytokine is subsequently activated by several different mechanisms. Fibrillins are extracellular matrix macromolecules whose primary function is architectural: fibrillins assemble into ultrastructurally distinct microfibrils that are ubiquitous in the connective tissue space. LTBPs and fibrillins are highly homologous molecules, and colocalization in the matrix of cultured cells has been reported. To address whether LTBP-1 functions architecturally like fibrillins, microfibrils were extracted from tissues and analyzed immunochemically. In addition, binding studies were conducted to determine whether LTBP-1 interacts with fibrillins. LTBP-1 was not detected in extracted beaded-string microfibrils, suggesting that LTBP-1 is not an integral structural component of microfibrils. However, binding studies demonstrated interactions between LTBP-1 and fibrillins. The binding site was within three domains of the LTBP-1 C terminus, and in fibrillin-1 the site was defined within four domains near the N terminus. Immunolocalization data were consistent with the hypothesis that LTBP-1 is a fibrillin-associated protein present in certain tissues but not in others. In tissues where LTBP-1 is not expressed, LTBP-4 may substitute for LTBP-1, because the C-terminal end of LTBP-4 binds equally well to fibrillin. A model depicting the relationship between LTBP-1 and fibrillin microfibrils is proposed."

One mechanism by which p53 functions is to induce a block in the transition between the G1 and S phase of the cell cycle. Previous studies indicate that the Krüppel-like factor 4 (KLF4) gene is activated following DNA damage and that such activation depends on p53. In addition, enforced expression ofKLF4 causes G1/S arrest. The present study examines the requirement of KLF4 in mediating the p53-dependent cell cycle arrest process in response to DNA damage. We show that the G1 population of a colon cancer cell line, HCT116, that is null for the p53 alleles (−/−) was abolished following γ irradiation compared with cells with wild-type p53 (+/+). Conditional expression ofKLF4 in irradiated HCT116 p53−/− cells restored the G1 cell population to a level similar to that seen in irradiated HCT116 p53+/+ cells. Conversely, treatment of HCT116 p53+/+ cells with small interfering RNA (siRNA) specific for KLF4 significantly reduced the number of cells in the G1 phase following γ irradiation compared with the untreated control or those treated with a nonspecific siRNA. In each case the increase or decrease in KLF4 level because of conditional induction or siRNA inhibition, respectively, was accompanied by an increase or decrease in the level of p21WAF1/CIP1.

Masui Y. Hartwell L. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 1103-1106Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Complex networks of control mechanisms called “checkpoints” are responsible for the orderly progression of these events within the cell cycle. Defects in checkpoint control increase genetic instability, thereby contributing to uncontrolled proliferation (2Malumbres M. Barbacid M. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2001; 1: 222-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (1175) Google Scholar). For example, damage to the DNA elicits a series of signal transduction pathways that result in an arrest of the cell cycle at various checkpoints (3Melo J. Toczyski D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 237-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). Much of the DNA damage-induced signals are funneled through p53, which directs further downstream actions that lead to inhibition of G1 to S and G2 to M transitions, among other events such as apoptosis (4Vogelstein B. Lane D. Levine A.J. Nature. 2000; 408: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (5850) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is not surprising that p53 is the most frequently mutated tumor suppressor gene in human cancers (5Hollstein M. Hergenhahn M. Yang Q. Bartsch H. Wang Z.Q. Hainaut P. Mutat. Res. 1999; 431: 199-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). The arrest in the transition between the G1 and S phase of the cell cycle elicited by p53 requires in part the transcriptional activation of the gene encoding the cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk)1 inhibitor p21WAF1/CIP1 (6Waldman T. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 5187-5190PubMed Google Scholar, 7Deng C. Zhang P. Harper J.W. Elledge S.J. Leder P.

Science. 1996; 274: 1672-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (4986) Google Scholar). Recent evidence suggests that p21WAF1/CIP1 is also required to sustain G2 arrest after DNA damage (10Bunz F. Dutriaux A. Lengauer C. Waldman T. Zhou S. Brown J.P. Sedivy J.M. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Science. 1998; 282: 1497-1501Crossref PubMed Scopus (2549) Google Scholar). Here, p21WAF1/CIP1 mediates the function of p53 in response to DNA damage by inhibiting Cdc2 (11Taylor W.R. Stark G.R. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 1803-1815Crossref PubMed Scopus (1302) Google Scholar), a Cdk required for entry into mitosis (12Nurse P. Nature. 1990; 344: 503-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (2228) Google Scholar). The proportion of cells that arrests in G1/S or G2/M depends on the cell type and status of checkpoint controls in each cell (13Niculescu III, A.B. Chen X. Smeets M. Hengst L. Prives C. Reed S.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 629-643Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although earlier studies indicate that expression ofp21 WAF1/CIP1 is the result of direct binding of p53 to its promoter (14el-Deiry W.S. Tokino T. Velculescu V.E. Levy D.B. Parsons R. Trent J.M. Lin D. Mercer W.E. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Cell. 1993; 75: 817-825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7957) Google Scholar), it is now evident that a myriad of transcription factors under various physiologic conditions can also lead to the transcriptional activation ofp21 WAF1/CIP1 (15Gartel A.L. Tyner A.L. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 246: 280-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar). Among these is the zinc finger-containing transcription factor, Krüppel-like factor 4 (KLF4), also called gut-enriched Krüppel-like factor or GKLF (16Dang D.T. Pevsner J. Yang V.W. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2000; 32: 1103-1121Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar,17Bieker J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34355-34358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar). KLF4 is a member of a rapidly expanding family of mammalian Krüppel-like factors that exhibit homology to theDrosophila protein Krüppel (18Wieschaus E. Nusslein-Volhard C. Kluding H. Dev. Biol. 1984; 104: 172-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Expression ofKLF4 is highly enriched in the postmitotic terminally differentiated epithelial cells of the intestine and epidermis (19Shields J.M. Christy R.J. Yang V.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20009-20017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar,20Garrett-Sinha L.A. Eberspaecher H. Seldin M.F. de Crombrugghe B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31384-31390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). In cultured cells expression of KLF4 is associated with growth arrest as a result of serum deprivation or contact inhibition (19Shields J.M. Christy R.J. Yang V.W. J. Biol.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 2969-2976Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Conversely, enforced expression of KLF4 inhibits DNA synthesis and results in decreased cell proliferation (19Shields J.M. Christy R.J. Yang V.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20009-20017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar, 22Geiman D.E. Ton-That H. Johnson J.M. Yang V.W.

Physiol. 2000; 279: G806-G814Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These studies suggest that KLF4 is a negative regulator of cell growth. Recently, it was demonstrated that expression of KLF4 is also induced by DNA damage and that such induction is dependent on p53 (24Zhang W. Geiman D.E. Shields J.M. Dang D.T. Mahatan C.S. Kaestner K.H. Biggs J.R. Kraft A.S. Yang V.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18391-18398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Importantly, KLF4 was shown to physically interact with p53, resulting in a synergistic activation of thep21 WAF1/CIP1 promoter. Moreover, antisense inhibition of KLF4 leads to a decreased level of p21WAF1/CIP1 in response to DNA damage (24Zhang W. Geiman D.E. Shields J.M. Dang D.T. Mahatan C.S. Kaestner K.H. Biggs J.R. Kraft A.S. Yang V.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18391-18398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar), suggesting that KLF is a potentially important mediator of p53-induced growth arrest. Indeed, recent studies using an inducible system forKLF4 indicate that its induction leads to arrest in the G1/S transition of the cell cycle (25Chen X. Johns D.C. Geiman D.E. Marban E. Dang D.T. Hamlin G. Sun R. Yang V.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30423-30428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). In the present study, we further characterize the role of KLF4 in mediating p53-dependent cell cycle arrest. By manipulatingKLF4 expression, we show that KLF4 is essential for the G1/S cell cycle arrest that results from DNA damage. The colon cancer cell lines, wild-type and null for p53, HCT116 p53+/+, and HCT116p53−/−, respectively, were generous gifts from Dr. Bert Vogelstein of Johns Hopkins University (10Bunz F. Dutriaux A.

The cells were cultured in McCoy's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin-streptomycin. EcR116 p53−/− cells were established by stably transfecting pVgRXR (25Chen X.

The level of retinoid X receptor expression was determined by Western blot analysis. γ irradiation of cultured cells was performed using a 137Cs γ irradiator at 0.8 Gy/min for 15 min, for a total of 12 Gy. Cells were harvested at 24 h after γ irradiation for subsequent assays. The recombinant adenovirus containing green fluorescence protein and KLF4 (AdEGI-KLF4) or green fluorescence protein alone (AdEGI) were described previously (25Chen X. Johns D.C. Geiman D.E.

Acad. Sci. 1999; 868: 418-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). EcR116p53−/− cells were grown to 40% confluence in 10-cm dishes and replenished with fresh media containing 2% fetal bovine serum followed by the addition of 108 plaque-forming units of recombinant virus per dish. Infected cells were incubated at 37 °C for 6 h, at which time cells were γ-irradiated, and the medium was changed. Cells were treated with 5 μm ponasterone A (Invitrogen) for 24 h and then collected for further analysis. 23-nucleotide single-stranded RNAs were produced by Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA). The small interfering RNA (siRNA) sequences targeting KLF4 (GenBankTM accession number XM_047517) correspond to the coding region between nucleotides 121–141 from the translation initiation site. The complementary single-stranded RNAs were dissolved in 10 mm Tris-HCl and 1 mm EDTA (pH 7.0) and annealed in 25 mm KoAc, 10 mm Tris-HCl, and 1 mm EDTA (pH 7.0) by briefly heating to 70 °C, then incubating for 20 min each at 37 and 23 °C. A nonspecific double-stranded siRNA with identical length was also generated based on the sequence of an unrelated protein and used as a control. HCT116 p53+/+ cells were grown to 40% confluence in 10-cm dishes, γ-irradiated for a total of 12 Gy, and transfected with annealed siRNA using DMRIE-C reagent (Invitrogen) for 6 h as recommended by the manufacturer. McCoy's medium containing 20% fetal bovine serum and 2% penicillin-streptomycin was added to each dish to a final concentration of 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin-streptomycin. Cells were harvested 24 h later for further assays. Cell protein extraction and Western blot analyses were performed using standard procedures. Protein samples were mixed with loading buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 100 mm dithiothreitol, 0.01% bromphenol blue, and 10% glycerol), heated at 100 °C for 5 min, and loaded onto a SDS-polyacrylamide gel in electrophoresis buffer containing 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 250 mm glycine, and 0.1% SDS. Protein was then transferred to nitrocellulose membranes using the Trans-Blot semidry system (Bio-Rad). The membranes were immunoblotted with primary antibodies against KLF4 (19Shields J.M. Christy R.J. Yang V.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20009-20017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar), p53, p21WAF1/CIP1, or β-catenin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Following incubation with the secondary antibody (horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG, 1:10,000 dilution, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), KLF4, p53, p21WAF1/CIP1, or β-catenin was visualized with the SuperSignal West Pico chemiluminescent substrate kit (Pierce). Cells were rinsed in Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (Mediatech), trypsinized, resuspended in McCoy's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin-streptomycin, collected by centrifugation, washed with Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline, again collected by centrifugation, resuspended in 70% ethanol, and fixed at −20 °C overnight. Cells were pelleted again by centrifugation and re-suspended in a staining solution containing 50 μg/ml propidium iodide, 50 μg/ml RNase A, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 0.1 mm EDTA for 30 min. Flow cytometry was performed on a FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences) cytometer. Both HCT116 p53+/+ andp53−/− cells exhibited comparable cell cycle profiles before irradiation (Fig. 1, A,B, and E). Following 12 Gy of γ irradiation, HCT116 p53+/+ cells demonstrated a normal cell cycle arrest pattern, with ∼15% of cells in G1, ∼80% cells in G2, and a significantly reduced S population (Fig. 1,C and F). However, HCT116 p53−/− cells exhibited an abnormal cell cycle pattern after γ irradiation, with ∼90% of the cells in G2 and few remaining in either G1 or S (Fig. 1, D and F). Consistent with the effect of γ irradiation on the cell cycle of HCT116p53+/+ cells, protein levels of KLF4 and p21WAF1/CIP1 were both significantly increased in response to an increase in p53 protein levels (Fig. 2, lanes 1 and 2). In contrast, no induction in the level of either KLF4 or p21WAF1/CIP1 was observed following γ irradiation in HCT116 p53−/− cells (Fig. 2, lanes 3 and4). These results suggest that at least part of the cell cycle arrest caused by γ irradiation is a result of p53-dependent activation of KLF4 and p21WAF1/CIP1.Figure 2Western blot analysis of p53, KLF4 , and p21WAF1/CIP1 in response to γ irradiation. The levels of p53, KLF, and p21WAF1/CIP1 were determined by Western blot analysis in HCT116 p53+/+ (lanes 1 and 2) and HCT116 p53−/− (lanes 3 and 4) without irradiation (lanes 1 and 3) and 24 h after 12 Gy of γ irradiation (lanes 2 and4).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The failure of γ irradiation to induce expression of KLF4 andp21 WAF1/CIP1 in HCT116 p53−/− cells correlated with the reduction in G1 and S populations (Figs. 1 and 2). This suggests that activation of KLF4, with consequent activation of p21 WAF1/CIP1 , may be necessary for the accumulation of cells in G1. To test this hypothesis, we established a stable HCT116 p53−/− cell line that expressed the receptors for the insect nuclear hormone, ecdysone, and its partner, retinoid X receptor (25Chen X. Johns D.C. Geiman D.E. Marban E. Dang D.T. Hamlin G. Sun R. Yang V.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30423-30428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). This cell line, called EcR116 p53−/−, was infected with the recombinant adenovirus AdEGI or AdEGI-KLF4 (25Chen X. Johns D.C. Geiman D.E. Marban E. Dang D.T. Hamlin G. Sun R. Yang V.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30423-30428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar) that contained enhanced green fluorescence protein as a control or enhanced green fluorescence protein plus KLF4, respectively. Following infection, cells were γ-irradiated or not and then treated with the inducer, ponasterone A, or vehicle alone for 24 h before being harvested for cell cycle analysis. As seen in Fig. 3, treatment of AdEGI-KLF4-infected cells with ponasterone A without irradiation resulted in a statistically significant increase in the G1population and a decrease in the G2/M population (Fig. 3,C, D, and J), whereas AdEGI-infected cells without irradiation and treated with ponasterone A had no effect on the cell cycle when compared with untreated cells (Fig. 3,A, B, and I). Cells infected with AdEGI followed by irradiation showed G2/M arrest in the absence or presence of ponasterone A (Fig. 3, E,F, and K) as did cells infected with AdEGI-KLF4 and irradiated without any ponasterone A treatment (Fig. 3,G and L). In contrast, upon the addition of ponasterone A, AdEGI-KLF4-infected and irradiated cells had a statistically significant increase in the G1 population (Fig. 3, H and L). This finding is reminiscent of the G1/S arrest seen in HCT116 p53+/+ cells following irradiation (compare Figs. 3 H and 1 C). Fig. 4 shows that only cells infected by AdEGI-KLF4 and induced with ponasterone A (lanes 11 and12) had appreciable amounts of KLF4. The increase in the KLF4 level correlated with an increase in the p21WAF1/CIP1level, a finding consistent with our previous observation that KLF4 is an activator of p21 WAF1/CIP1 expression (25Chen X. Johns D.C. Geiman D.E. Marban E. Dang D.T. Hamlin G. Sun R. Yang V.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30423-30428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). The combined results of Figs. 3 and 4 indicate that the inducible expression of KLF4 in irradiated cells lackingp53 restores the characteristic G1/S arrest in cells with wild type p53 following irradiation. This finding indicates that KLF4 is necessary and sufficient in mediating the G1 cell cycle effect of p53 following DNA damage. Recently, Tuschl and co-workers (27Elbashir S.M. Harborth J. Lendeckel W. Yalcin A. Weber K. Tuschl T. Nature. 2001; 411: 494-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (8186) Google Scholar, 28Elbashir S.M. Lendeckel W. Tuschl T. Genes Dev. 2001; 5: 188-200Crossref Scopus (2712) Google Scholar) demonstrated that RNA interference can be provoked in mammalian cell lines through the introduction of siRNA. The mediators of sequence-specific mRNA degradation are 21–23-nucleotide siRNA duplexes that trigger specific gene silencing in mammalian somatic cells without activation of the unspecific interferon response (27Elbashir S.M. Harborth J. Lendeckel W. Yalcin A. Weber K. Tuschl T. Nature. 2001; 411: 494-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (8186) Google Scholar, 28Elbashir S.M. Lendeckel W. Tuschl T.

To determine whether we could “knock down” KLF4 expression using siRNA, we synthesized a 23-nucleotide siRNA duplex specific for KLF4 to transfect HCT116 p53+/+ cells with or without irradiation. As seen in Fig. 5, siRNA for KLF4significantly reduced the level of KLF4 in response to γ irradiation when compared with untransfected or mock-transfected cells (lanes 2, 4, 6, and 8). In contrast, a control nonspecific siRNA failed to abrogate the DNA damage-induced synthesis of KLF4 (lanes 10 and 12). Again, there was a corresponding reduction in the level of p21WAF1/CIP1in response to γ irradiation in KLF4 siRNA-treated cells (lanes 6 and 8). Importantly, KLF4siRNA but not nonspecific siRNA abolished the G1 population in cells upon γ irradiation (Fig. 6,lanes F, G, H, I, andJ). These results complement those from the preceding sections and provide strong evidence that KLF4 is an essential factor in mediating p53-dependent G1 arrest in response to DNA damage.Figure 6The effect of KLF4 siRNA on the cell cycle in HCT116 p53+/+ cells following γ irradiation. Flow cytometric analyses were performed in HCT116 p53+/+ cells that were non-irradiated (panels A–E) or irradiated (panels F–J) followed by mock transfection (panels A and F), transfection with 2 (panels B and G) or 4 μg (panels Cand H) of KLF4-specific siRNA, or transfection with 2 (panels D and I) or 4 μg (panels E and J) of nonspecific siRNA.

This was supported by the results in Fig. 1, which showed that HCT116 p53+/+ cells arrested at either G1or G2/M after γ irradiation as expected for cells with intact checkpoint function. The resultant activation of p53 because of γ irradiation was accompanied by a significant increase in the level of KLF4 and p21WAF1/CIP1 (Fig. 2) in a manner similar to the previously observed response of fibroblasts subjected to DNA damage caused by methyl methanesulfonate (24Zhang W. Geiman D.E. Shields J.M. Dang D.T. Mahatan C.S. Kaestner K.H. Biggs J.R. Kraft A.S. Yang V.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18391-18398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). HCT116 p53−/− cells, in contrast, showed no induction of either KLF4 or p21WAF1/CIP1 by γ irradiation and arrested only in G2/M (Fig. 1). The latter result was consistent with that from a previous study, which also demonstrated that p53 was necessary to sustain G2 arrest (10Bunz F. Dutriaux A. Lengauer C. Waldman T. Zhou S. Brown J.P. Sedivy J.M. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Science. 1998; 282: 1497-1501Crossref PubMed Scopus (2549) Google Scholar). Recent studies indicate that the G1 checkpoint control after DNA damage consisted of two steps (31Bartek J. Lukas J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 738-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). The first step is a rapid and p53-independent induction of the G1 checkpoint. It is a result of rapid redistribution of p21WAF1/CIP1 from cyclin D1-Cdk4/6 complexes to cyclin E-Cdk2 complexes, which are inhibited by p21WAF1/CIP1 (36Sherr C.J. Roberts J.M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1501-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (5159) Google Scholar, 37Agami R. Bernards R. Cell. 2000; 102: 55-66Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). The second step involves the post-translational modifications of p53 by upstream protein kinases, including ataxia telangiectasia mutated/ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3 related and Chk1/Chk2 (38Kastan M.B. Lim D.S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 1: 179-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar, 39Shiloh Y. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2001; 11: 71-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar), which results in p53 activation and subsequent transcriptional induction ofp21 WAF1/CIP1 (31Bartek J. Lukas J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 738-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence suggest that KLF4 is involved in the p53-dependent induction of p21 WAF1/CIP1 . First, p53 mediates the transcriptional induction of KLF4 in response to DNA damage (24Zhang W. Geiman D.E. Shields J.M. Dang D.T. Mahatan C.S. Kaestner K.H. Biggs J.R. Kraft A.S. Yang V.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18391-18398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Second, the induction in KLF4 precedes that inp21 WAF1/CIP1 following DNA damage (24Zhang W. Geiman D.E. Shields J.M. Dang D.T. Mahatan C.S. Kaestner K.H. Biggs J.R. Kraft A.S. Yang V.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18391-18398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Third, KLF4 binds to a specific cis-element in the proximal promoter of thep21 WAF1/CIP1 gene and activates the promoter (24Zhang W. Geiman D.E. Shields J.M. Dang D.T. Mahatan C.S. Kaestner K.H. Biggs J.R. Kraft A.S. Yang V.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18391-18398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Fourth, p53 and KLF4 physically interact and cause a synergistic induction in p21 WAF1/CIP1 gene expression (24Zhang W. Geiman D.E. Shields J.M. Dang D.T. Mahatan C.S. Kaestner K.H. Biggs J.R. Kraft A.S. Yang V.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18391-18398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). The importance of KLF4 in mediating the transcriptional induction ofp21 WAF1/CIP1 is further demonstrated by the observation that p53 fails to activate thep21 WAF1/CIP1 promoter if the KLF4 response element in the promoter is mutated (24Zhang W. Geiman D.E. Shields J.M. Dang D.T. Mahatan C.S. Kaestner K.H. Biggs J.R. Kraft A.S. Yang V.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18391-18398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). In addition to the biochemical evidence supporting a crucial role for KLF4 in mediating the transcriptional induction ofp21 WAF1/CIP1 by p53, the present study provides the genetic evidence to further substantiate the significance of KLF4 in p53-mediated G1 arrest caused by DNA damage. Specifically, the conditional induction of KLF4 in γ-irradiated HCT116 p53−/− cells restored the G1 population of cells that are normally present in irradiated HCT116 p53+/+ cells (Fig. 3). Conversely, inhibition of KLF4 expression in irradiated HCT116p53+/+ cells resulted in an abolishment of the G1 peak in a manner that resembles the consequence of γ irradiation of HCT116 p53−/− cells (Fig. 6). In each case, the induction or inhibition of KLF4 expression was accompanied by a corresponding increase or decrease, respectively, in the level of p21WAF1/CIP1 (Figs. 4 and 5). Coupled with the findings from our previous study, which demonstrated that inducible expression of KLF4 causes a G1/S cell cycle arrest (25Chen X. Johns D.C. Geiman D.E. Marban E. Dang D.T. Hamlin G. Sun R. Yang V.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30423-30428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar), it is highly likely that KLF4 serves a pivotal role in mediating the G1 checkpoint function of p53 in response to DNA damage. In addition to its effect on the G1/S checkpoint, p53 also regulates the G2/M transition in response to DNA damage (11Taylor W.R. Stark G.R. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 1803-1815Crossref PubMed Scopus (1302) Google Scholar). Part of the mechanism by which p53 inhibits the G2checkpoint involves inhibition of Cdc2, the cyclin-dependent kinase required to enter mitosis (12Nurse P. Nature. 1990; 344: 503-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (2228) Google Scholar). Binding of Cdc2 to cyclin B1 is required for its activity, and repression of the cyclin B1 gene by p53 contributes to the blocking of entry into mitosis (40Krause K. Wasner M. Reinhard W. Haugwitz U. Dohna C.L. Mossner J. Engeland K. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 4410-4418Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 41Yin X.Y. Grove L. Datta N.S. Katula K. Long M.W. Prochownik E.V. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 6487-6493PubMed Google Scholar). p53 also represses expression of the Cdc2 gene (42Taylor W.R. DePrimo S.E. Agarwal A. Agarwal M.L. Schonthal A.H Katula K.S. Stark G.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 3607-3622Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 43Yun J. Chae H.D. Choy H.E. Chung J. Yoo H.S. Han M.H. Shin D.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29677-29682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) to help ensure that cells do not escape from the initial block. Moreover, several of the transcriptional targets of p53 can inhibit Cdc2, including p21WAF1/CIP1, 14-3-3ς, and Gadd45 (44Smits V.A. Klompmaker R. Vallenius T. Rijksen G. Makela T.P. Medema R.H. J.

Chem. 2000; 275: 16602-16608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is of great interest to note that a recent analysis of KLF4 target genes by cDNA microarrays showed that KLF4 activates expression of14-3-3ς, in addition top21 WAF1/CIP1 , and represses expression ofCdc2 (47Chen, X., Whitney, E. M., Gao, S. Y., and Yang, V. W. (2003) J. Mol. Biol., in pressGoogle Scholar). Whether KLF4 is also involved in mediating the G2 checkpoint function of p53 in response to DNA damage is currently being determined.

A fundamental step in both homologous recombination and SOS response induction is the formation of a RecA-ssDNA1-ATP nucleoprotein filament. In this form, RecA protein can act as a recombinase by mediating pairing and promoting strand exchange between single-stranded DNA and another homologous DNA molecule, a process important for phage transduction, conjugation, and DNA repair (1Kowalczykowski S.C. Dixon D.A. Eggleston A.K. Lauder S.D. Rehrauer W.M. Microbiol. Rev. 1994; 94: 401-465Crossref Google Scholar, 2Roca A.I. Cox M.M. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1990; 25: 415-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). RecA also functions as a coprotease to activate the SOS response (3Walker G.C. Neidhardt F.C. Curtiss III, R. Ingraham J.L. Lin E.C.C. Low K.B. Magasamik B. Reznikoff W.S. Riley M. Schaechter M. Umbarger H.E. Escherichia coli and Salmonella: Cellular and Molecular Biology. American Society for Microbiology Press, Washington, D. C.1996: 1400-1416Google Scholar). The LexA protein represses transcription of over 30 SOS genes in the E. coli SOS regulon (4Fernandez de Henestrosa A.R. Ogi T. Aoyagi S. Chafin D. Hayes J.J. Ohmori H. Woodgate R. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 35: 1560-1572Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). DNA damage is believed to produce regions of ssDNA upon which RecA forms a nucleoprotein filament. RecA coprotease activity facilitates self-cleavage of the LexA repressor protein, enhancing expression of SOS genes. RecA coprotease activity is also responsible for cleavage of the UmuD protein, which is involved in SOS mutagenesis. It is assumed that the repair of damaged DNA gradually removes the signal (ssDNA) needed for nucleoprotein filament formation, resulting in the re-accumulation of LexA pools and subsequent repression of the SOS genes, thereby resetting the SOS system (3Walker G.C. Neidhardt F.C. Curtiss III, R. Ingraham J.L. Lin E.C.C. Low K.B. Magasamik B. Reznikoff W.S. Riley M. Schaechter M. Umbarger H.E. Escherichia coli and Salmonella: Cellular and Molecular Biology. American Society for Microbiology Press, Washington, D. C.1996: 1400-1416Google Scholar). In contrast to this essentially passive process, overexpression of the E. coli DinI protein has been shown to inhibit induction of the SOS response through inhibition of RecA coprotease activity (5Yasuda T. Morimatsu K. Horii T. Nagata T. Ohmori H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3207-3216Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), and a dinI knockout showed both increased UmuD cleavage and SOS mutagenesis, suggesting that DinI may play an active role in turning off or modulating the SOS response (5Yasuda T.

Overexpression of homologous RecA proteins from plasmid constructs is deleterious in the absence of recX inPseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptomyces lividans,Mycobacterium smegmatis, and Xanthomonas oryzae(9Sano Y.

Consistent with these observations,Mycobacterium tuberculosis RecX was recently shown to inhibit RecA-promoted DNA strand exchange and ATP hydrolysis in vitro (16Venkatesh R. Ganesh N. Guhan N. Reddy M.S. Chandrasekhar T. Muniyappa K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 12091-12096Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Although a recX mutation in S. lividans did not affect homologous recombination or transcription of recA (11Vierling S. Weber T. Wohlleben W. Muth G. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 4005-4011Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), mutation of recX in X. oryzae resulted in decreased RecA levels (15Sukchawalit R. Vattanaviboon P. Utamapongchai S. Vaughn G. Mongkolsuk S. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2001; 205: 83-89Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, aN. gonorrhoeae recX mutant exhibited deficiencies in all RecA-mediated processes but did not affect RecA levels, leading to the conclusion that RecX enhances RecA activity in N. gonorrhoeae (13Stohl E.A. Seifert H.S. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 40: 1301-1310Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). This collection of phenotypes led us to investigate the role of E. coli RecX in vitro andin vivo. The data presented here demonstrate that E. coli RecX can strongly inhibit both RecA recombinase and coprotease activities in vitro and in vivo. New strains were constructed using P1 transduction (17Miller J.H. A Short Course in Bacterial Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992Google Scholar) or as described.

A. 2000; 97: 6640-6645Crossref PubMed Scopus (11201) Google Scholar) were used for creation of a recX deletion strain. Media forE. coli were prepared as described previously (17Miller J.H. A Short Course in Bacterial Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992Google Scholar). All media and plasmids used for yeast two-hybrid analyses were from Invitrogen. Antibiotics were added at the following concentrations: ampicillin (Amp), 100 μg/ml; kanamycin (Kan), 15 μg/ml for chromosomal markers, or 40 μg/ml for plasmid markers; spectinomycin, 50 μg/ml; streptomycin, 50 μg/ml; erythromycin (Erm), 250 μg/ml; chloramphenicol, 100 μg/ml. Isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) (Diagnostic Chemicals Ltd.) was used at 1 or 1.5 mm, mitomycin C (MMC) (Sigma) was used at 1 or 0.2 μg/ml, and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-α-d-galactopyranoside (X-α-gal) (Clontech) was used at 20 μg/ml. ATP was from Amersham Biosciences. Standard procedures were performed as described previously (26Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Extraction of DNA from bacteria and agarose gels was performed using Qiagen kits. Enzymes were used according to manufacturers' directions (Promega, New England BioLabs). Sequencing reactions were performed using the Big-Dye Terminator cycle sequencing kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), and sequencing products were separated on an ABI model 377 automated DNA sequencer. Yeast two-hybrid analysis was performed using the Matchmaker GAL4 two-hybrid system 3 as described (Clontech). E. coli recA was amplified from plasmid pERA by PCR using Pfu polymerase (Stratagene) with primers ECRECAFOR 5′-TTACATATGGCTATCGACGAAAACAAACAG-3′, which introduces an NdeI site (underlined), and ECRECAREV 5′-GACTTAAAAATCTTCGTTAGTTTCTGC-3′. E. coli recX was similarly amplified using primers ECRECXFOR 5′-TTACCATGGACATGACAGAATCAACATCCC-3′, which introduces a NcoI site (underlined), and ECRECXREV 5′-TTATCAGTCGGCAAAATTTCGCC-3′. The gel-purified PCR fragments were cloned into pCR-Blunt (Invitrogen) and sequenced. The genes were further subcloned into NdeI/BamHI-digested (forrecA) and NcoI-EcoRI-digested (forrecX) vectors pGADT7 and pGBKT7 (Clontech), yielding constructs pGADT7-RecX, pGADT7-RecA, pGBKT7-RecX, and pGBKT7-RecA. Clones were sequenced to verify maintenance of proper reading frame, and protein expression of all relevant constructs in yeast was demonstrated by Western blot analysis (data not shown). Plasmid construct pET/HisRecX was used to overexpress RecX as an N-terminal His-tagged protein. The recX coding region was amplified by PCR from plasmid pERA 2R. D. Porter, unpublished data. using primers ECRXFORNHE, which introduces a NheI site (underlined) (5′-GTAGCTAGCATGACAGAATCAACATCC-3′), and ECRX1R (5′-GCTGGTAACTGAAAAGTGGG-3′) with Pfu polymerase. The gel-purified PCR product was ligated to pCR-Blunt (Invitrogen) to yield pCRHisRecX, and the resulting clone was sequenced to verify that no mutations had been introduced. The recX insert was isolated by NheI-HindIII digestion and ligated toNheI-HindIII-digested pET28a vector (Novagen) to yield construct pET/HisRecX. The E. coli recX gene was cloned under control of the lac promoter in plasmid pGCC4, a high copy number plasmid with a ColE1 origin of replication (27Mehr I.J. Long C.D. Serkin C.D. Seifert H.S. Genetics. 2000; 154: 523-532PubMed Google Scholar). recX was amplified from plasmid pERA by PCR using primers RECXFORPAC, which introduces a PacI site (underlined) (5′-GTAGGTTAATTAAGTTGTAAGGATATGCCA-3′), and RECXREV (5′-AGTCGCTAGCAATACCGTATGCGTTCAGTCG-3′) using Pfu polymerase (Stratagene). The fragment was digested with PacI, gel-purified, ligated to PacI-PmeI-digested pGCC4, and the resulting clone was sequenced. Plasmid pGCC4/HisRecX was created by ligating the blunt-ended XbaI/HindIII fragment of pET/HisRecX to PmeI-digested pGCC4. Expression of similar levels of His-tagged RecX (HisRecX) and RecX proteins from vector pGCC4 in strain AB1157ΔrecX resulted in similar levels of UV resistance, demonstrating the activity of HisRecX in vivo (data not shown). HisRecX protein was overexpressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) (pET/HisRecX) cells. Cultures (500 ml) were grown at 37 °C to mid-exponential phase (A 600 ∼ 0.4), IPTG (1 mm) was added to induce expression of HisRecX, and the culture was grown an additional 1.5 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation (10,000 × g, 10 min) and resuspended in 1/10 volume column binding buffer (5 mm imidazole, 0.5m NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9)) amended with 0.1% Triton X-100. Cells were disrupted by sonication on ice for three 1-min pulses, with 1-min cooling between pulses, with a Vibra-Cell probe sonicator at output setting 4, 50% duty cycle (Sonics & Materials, Inc.). Soluble proteins were separated from cell debris and insoluble proteins by centrifugation (14,000 × g, 20 min) and by subsequent passage through a 0.45-μm filter. Clarified supernatant was applied to a HisBind Quick column (Novagen) that had been equilibrated with 15 ml of column binding buffer, and the column was washed with 50 ml of column binding buffer and 25 ml of column wash buffer (60 mm imidazole, 0.5 m NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9)). HisRecX protein was eluted from the column with 100 mm EDTA, 0.5 m NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), and fractions containing HisRecX were identified via SDS-PAGE. HisRecX-containing fractions were combined and dialyzed against three changes of a 200-fold excess of 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9) over 24 h at 4 °C and subsequently concentrated in a Centriprep-40 concentrator (Millipore). Protein concentration was determined by BCA assay (Pierce), and protein purity was assessed to be >98% by quantitative scanning of Coomassie Blue-stained SDS-PAGE gels. For protein used in activity assays, glycerol was added to 20% final concentration and protein was flash-frozen on dry ice/EtOH. RecA and SSB proteins were prepared as described previously (28Rehrauer W.M. Bruck I. Woodgate R. Goodman M.F. Kowalczykowski S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32384-32387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The agarose gel assay for DNA strand exchange was conducted and visualized as described (29Lavery P.E. Kowalczykowski S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 4004-4010Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Reactions contained 25 mm Tris acetate (pH 7.5), 10 mm magnesium acetate, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm phosphoenolpyruvate, 10 units of pyruvate kinase per milliliter, 7 μm M13 ssDNA, 1 mm ATP, 0.64 μm SSB, 4.2 μm RecA, and 10 μm M13 replicative form dsDNA linearized withEcoRI, and varying concentrations of RecX. The ssDNA-dependent hydrolysis of ATP by RecA was measured as described using a coupled enzymatic assay (30Rehrauer W.M. Lavery P.E. Palmer E.L. Singh R.N. Kowalczykowski S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23865-23873Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Reactions contained 7 μm M13 ssDNA, 4.2 μm RecA, 0.64 μm SSB (where indicated), and varying amounts of RecX. RecA protein was added to M13 circular ssDNA either before RecX or following 10-min incubation of RecX with M13 circular ssDNA. When SSB was included, it was added 1 min after the addition of RecA. We created a 368-bp non-polar internal deletion of recX using the method described by Datsenko and Wanner (25Datsenko K.A. Wanner B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6640-6645Crossref PubMed Scopus (11201) Google Scholar). Gene deletions using this system are engineered to introduce stop codons in all six reading frames and an idealized ribosome binding site and start codon for downstream gene expression at the site of gene deletion. The gene disruptions created using this system have been shown to be non-polar (25Datsenko K.A. Wanner B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6640-6645Crossref PubMed Scopus (11201) Google Scholar). A PCR product was generated from plasmid pKD4 (25Datsenko K.A. Wanner B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6640-6645Crossref PubMed Scopus (11201) Google Scholar) using primers H15 (5′-AATCAACATCCCGTCGCCCGGCATATGCTCGCCTGTTGGATCGTGTGTAGGCTGGAGCTGCTTC-3′) and H23 (5′-GCAAAATTTCGCCAAATCTCCTGGATATCTTCCATCAGATAGCCCATATGAATATCCTCCTTAG-3′). This PCR product contains a kan marker flanked by short regions of homology to the recX gene at the 5′- and 3′-ends (underlined in primer sequences). We transformed strain AB1157 (pKD46) with this PCR product and selected for KanR colonies to identify insertions into recX, yielding strain AB1157ΔrecX::kan. PCR analysis of KanR colonies using primer pairs ECRX1R (5′-GCTGGTAACTGAAAAGTGGG-3′) and ECRX2F (5′-AGGCGTAGCAGAAACTAACG-3′), just outside the recX coding region, andkan-specific primers k1 and k2 (25Datsenko K.A. Wanner B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6640-6645Crossref PubMed Scopus (11201) Google Scholar) confirmed the location and insertion of the kan gene (data not shown). The subsequent eviction of the kan gene from strain AB1157ΔrecX::kan, using a curable helper plasmid encoding the FLP recombinase (pCP20), yielding strain AB1157ΔrecX, was verified by PCR (data not shown). Overnight cultures were diluted into LB or LB-Erm (1.5 mm IPTG) and grown to early stationary phase (A 600 = 1.2), serially diluted, and spot-plated onto the appropriate LB agar. Plates were exposed to 0, 2.5, 5.0, 7.5, and 10 J/m2 UV light (UV Stratalinker 1800, Stratagene). Overnight cultures were diluted into LB or LB-Erm containing 5.0 mm CaCl2 and grown until late log phase (A 600 = 0.8). IPTG (1.5 mm) was added to cultures containing plasmids, and cultures were grown for an additional 30 min. P1 transduction was performed as described (17Miller J.H. A Short Course in Bacterial Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992Google Scholar) using phage grown on Hfr Cavalli. For LexA cleavage assays, overnight cultures were diluted into LB or LB-Erm (1.5 mm IPTG) and grown to A 600 = 0.4, and cultures were supplemented with chloramphenicol (100 μg/ml) and incubated for an additional 10 min. For cultures containing plasmids pGCC4 and pGCC4/recX, aliquots were taken (t 0), the remainder of the culture was exposed to 8 J/m2 UV irradiation, and additional aliquots were taken from the irradiated samples after 5, 15, 30, 60, and 90 min. For strains AB1157 and AB1157ΔrecX, t 0aliquots were taken, both cultures were exposed to 4 J/m2, and additional aliquots were taken after 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 20, and 30 min. Protein concentration of samples was determined by BCA assay (Pierce). For UmuD cleavage assays, overnight cultures were diluted into LB-Spc or LB-Erm-Spc (1.5 mm IPTG). For this analysis, all strains additionally contained plasmid pRW362 (umuD) to facilitate UmuD detection. Cells were grown to A 600 = 0.4, a t 0 aliquot was taken, and MMC was added (0.2 μg/ml). Aliquots were taken after 80, 120, 160, 200, and 240 min. Protein concentration of samples was determined by BCA assay (Pierce). Western analysis and protein quantification was performed as described (13Stohl E.A. Seifert H.S. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 40: 1301-1310Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), except for exceptions noted. Samples were run on 15% SDS-PAGE gels (for RecX and LexA), 17% (for UmuD), or 12% (for RecA and all constructs in yeast), and subsequently developed using ECL or ECL Plus Western blotting protocols (Amersham Biosciences). Antibodies against HisRecX, raised in a rabbit using the Polyquik method (Zymed Laboratories), were used at a 1:600 dilution. Anti-LexA antibodies (Invitrogen), anti-UmuD antibodies (provided by R. Woodgate, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD), anti-RecA antibodies (provided by M. Cox, University of Wisconsin-Madison), anti-c-myc and anti-HA antibodies (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) were used at 1:5,000 dilutions. Secondary goat anti-rabbit IgG, goat anti-mouse IgG, and rabbit anti-rat IgG antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase were used at 1:5,000 to 1:15,000 dilutions (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Membranes were either exposed to Kodak film or detected using a ChemiImager (Alpha Innotech Corp.). Subsequent densitometric analyses were performed using ImageQuaNT (Amersham Biosciences) or Alpha Ease (Alpha Innotech) software, respectively. In several bacterial systems, overexpression of RecA proteins from plasmid constructs is deleterious in the absence of recX (9Sano Y. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 2451-2454Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 11Vierling S. Weber T. Wohlleben W. Muth G. J.

Lett. 2001; 205: 83-89Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that RecX may down-regulate RecA activity or expression, possibly by interacting with the RecA protein. To investigate the direct association of E. coli RecX and RecA proteins, a yeast two-hybrid analysis was performed. Both recA andrecX genes were cloned into vectors pGBKT7 (TRP1marker) and pGADT7 (LEU2 marker), yielding constructs pGBKT7-RecA, pGBKT7-RecX, pGADT7-RecA, and pGADT7-RecX that express fusion proteins with Gal4 DNA binding or activation domains (described under “Experimental Procedures”). The yeast two-hybrid reporter strain AH109 contains ADE2, HIS3, andMEL1 reporter genes that are expressed only when a functional Gal4 protein is reconstituted by an interaction between the activation domain and the DNA binding domain fusion proteins. AH109 cells carrying plasmid pairs pGBKT7-RecA/pGADT7-RecX or pGBKT7-RecX/pGADT7-RecA grew robustly on media lacking histidine, tryptophan, and leucine, and showed a blue color on media supplemented with X-α-gal, indicating both MEL1 andHIS3 reporter gene expression in these cells (Fig. 1 and data not shown). However, cells grew less well on media lacking adenine, histidine, tryptophan, and leucine, suggesting lower expression of the ADE2 reporter gene, which demands strong protein-protein interactions for its expression (data not shown). AH109 cells carrying control plasmids with interacting gene products (pGADT7-T and pGBKT7–53) grew on media lacking histidine, tryptophan, and leucine, but AH109 carrying control plasmids with non-interacting gene products (pGADT7-T and pGBKT7-Lam), or AH109 co-transformed with the recA or recXplasmids and either pGADT7-T or pGBKT7-Lam plasmids did not grow on the selective media (Fig. 1 and data not shown). Together these data demonstrate a specific interaction of E. coli RecA and RecX proteins in yeast. To investigate the functional significance of RecX interaction with RecA, we measured the effect of RecX on RecA recombinase activity in vitro. RecA-promoted DNA strand exchange was measured in the presence or absence of RecX. RecX completely abolished formation of joint molecules over a 60-min time course between homologous circular ssDNA and linear dsDNA molecules at a RecX:RecA molar ratio of 1:2.2 (Fig. 2). In the absence of RecA, RecX neither catalyzed the formation of joint molecules nor degraded DNA (data not shown), demonstrating that the effect of RecX on RecA activity is not simply due to degradation of DNA substrates. Titrating the level of RecX protein in the strand exchange reaction, complete inhibition of joint molecule formation was observed at a RecX:RecA molar ratio of 1:44, minimal joint molecule formation was seen at a 1:88 ratio, and resolution into a nicked circular form was never observed, even at a RecX:RecA molar ratio of 1:707 (Fig. 2). These data suggest that sub-stoichiometric levels of RecX inhibit both the initial pairing of homologous molecules, and, to a greater degree, subsequent branch migration. Formation of a RecA-ssDNA-ATP nucleoprotein filament is accompanied by the subsequent hydrolysis of ATP by RecA (ATPase activity) and reflects the amount of active nucleoprotein filament formed. We therefore assessed the effect of RecX on RecA ATPase activity in the presence or absence of SSB, preincubating RecX with ssDNA before the addition of RecA. In the absence of SSB, RecX decreased ATPase activity 20% when present at a 1:70 RecX:RecA molar ratio (60 nm RecX), 50% when present at a 1:14 RecX:RecA molar ratio (300 nm RecX), and 85% when present at a 1:8 molar ratio (500 nm RecX) (Fig. 3). In the presence of SSB, the effects of RecX were more dramatic, with ATPase activity nearly completely abolished (decreased 98%) by a RecX:RecA molar ratio of 1:70, approximately the level where minimal joint molecule formation was seen in the in vitro strand exchange reaction. We observed the same effect of RecX on ATPase activity when RecX was added to the reaction after preincubation of RecA and ssDNA (data not shown). Therefore, the inhibitory effect of RecX is enhanced in the presence of SSB but is independent of the time of RecX addition to the reaction. The strong inhibitory effect of RecX on RecA activity in vitro suggested that RecX could have dramatic effects modulating RecA activities in vivo as well. Therefore, we began to characterize the E. coli recX gene to determine its role in the bacterial cell. InE. coli, recX is directly preceded by neither a canonical promoter sequence nor an SOS box, but it is located 76 bp downstream of the SOS-regulated recA gene, suggesting thatrecX could be co-transcribed with recA and, therefore, under control of LexA. Western blot analysis revealed expression of a ∼19-kDa band barely detectable in strain AB1157 that increased in intensity after treatment with mitomycin C (MMC) (Fig. 4) or exposure to UV light (data not shown). This band was undetectable in the MMC-treated ΔrecX mutant, demonstrating that recX is induced upon DNA damage (Fig. 4). Robust expression of the ∼19-kDa RecX band was detected in strain DE192, a lexA51(Def) strain that does not produce a functional LexA repressor, but not in the isogenic strain DE192ΔrecX (data not shown). Moreover, RecX levels did not increase after addition of MMC to cultures of DM49(lexA3), which has a non-cleavable LexA repressor (data not shown). Finally, RecA and RecX proteins showed identical patterns of induction after UV treatment (data not shown), as was also found with recA and recX transcripts (31Courcelle J. Khodursky A. Peter B. Brown P.O. Hanawalt P.C. Genetics. 2001; 158: 41-64Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and we demonstrated that recA and recX are present on the same transcript by RT-PCR (data not shown). Together these data demonstrate that recX is induced with recA in a LexA-dependent manner and is, therefore, an SOS response gene. Because recX was induced upon DNA damage, suggesting a possible role in DNA repair, we tested the effect of the ΔrecX mutation on UV resistance in strain AB1157. Strain AB1157ΔrecX showed a small, but statistically significant, decrease in UV resistance relative to AB1157 (Fig. 5 A). Because the ΔrecX mutation is non-polar (see “Experimental Procedures”), this phenotype is due to recX inactivation. To test this assumption, a functional copy of recX was introduced in trans (pGCC4/recX), withrecX under control of lac regulatory elements, into strain AB1157ΔrecX. Surprisingly, this plasmid conferred a striking reduction in UV resistance relative to str"

To understand the molecular interactions of the angiopoietins with their receptor, we have studied the binding of Ang-1 and Ang-2 to the Tie-2 receptor. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay-based competition assays and co-immunoprecipitation experiments analyzing the binding of Ang-1 and Ang-2 to truncation mutants of the extracellular domain of Tie-2 showed that the first Ig-like loop of Tie-2 in combination with the epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like repeats (amino acids 1–360) is required for angiopoietin binding. The first Ig-like domain or the EGF-like repeats alone are not capable of binding Ang-1 and Ang-2. Concomitantly, we made the surprising finding that Tie-2 exon-2 knockout mice do express a mutated Tie-2 protein that lacks 104 amino acids of the first Ig-like domain. This mutant Tie-2 receptor is functionally inactive as shown by the lack of ligand binding and receptor phosphorylation. Collectively, the data show that the first 104 amino acids of the Tie-2 receptor are essential but not sufficient for angiopoietin binding. Conversely, the first 360 amino acids (Ig-like domain plus EGF-like repeats) of the Tie-2 receptor are necessary and sufficient to bind both Ang-1 and Ang-2, which suggests that differential receptor binding is not likely to be responsible for the different functions of Ang-1 and Ang-2.

Vasculogenesis is followed by angiogenesis, the sprouting and subsequent remodeling from a pre-existing vasculature. The vasculature in the adult is quiescent with a very low turnover rate of the lining endothelial cell layer with a physiological proliferative turnover within months to years (1Gale N.W. Yancopoulos G.D. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1055-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar, 2Carmeliet P. Nat. Med. 2000; 4: 389-395Crossref Scopus (3432) Google Scholar). However, it can rapidly respond to angiogenic stimuli supporting a complex morphogenic program that leads to vascular remodeling and induction of neo-angiogenesis. The balance between neovessel formation and homeostasis of the resting vasculature is maintained by a finely tuned balance of proangiogenic and antiangiogenic mediators. The Tie/angiopoietin receptor ligand system is critically involved in regulating both processes, maintaining vascular homeostasis and vessel maturation as well as vascular destabilization and remodeling (1Gale N.W.

Both molecules are preferentially expressed by endothelial cells and were originally isolated as orphan receptors (4Sato T.N. Qin Y. Kozak C.A. Audus K.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9355-9358Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). They are composed of three EGF1 homology repeats flanked by two Ig-like loops. The second Ig-like loop is followed by a fibronectin type III domain adjacent to the transmembrane domain. The intracellular domain contains a split tyrosine kinase domain (Fig. 1).

Ang-1- and Tie-2-deficient mice have similar phenotypes characterized by embryonic lethality with severe vascular remodeling defects, insufficient vessel stabilization, and perturbed vascular maturation (4Sato T.N.

In contrast, Ang-2 is not capable of inducing Tie-2 autophosphorylation in endothelial cells upon short term treatment (6Maisonpierre P.C. Suri C. Jones P.F. Bartunkova S. Wiegand S.J.

Instead, it appears to act as a natural antagonist of Ang-1, which was inferred from the observation that Ang-2 transgenic embryos exhibit a phenotype largely similar to the embryonic lethal phenotype of Ang-1- and Tie-2-deficient mice (6Maisonpierre P.C.

Ang-2 is expressed by endothelial cells at sites of vascular remodeling and apparently acts by destabilizing the contacts between endothelial cells and surrounding mural cells, most notably pericytes (6Maisonpierre P.C.

Science. 1997; 277: 55-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (2927) Google Scholar). As such, it acts as a facilitator of vascular morphogenesis and remodeling, acting proangiogenic in the presence of angiogenic stimulators, such as VEGF (11Lobov I.V. Brooks P.C. Lang R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 11205-11210Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar), and antiangiogenic and vessel regression inducing in the absence of proangiogenic activity, e.g. as occurs physiologically during ovarian luteal regression (12Goede V. Schmidt T. Kimmina S. Kozian D. Augustin H.G. Lab. Invest. 1998; 78: 1385-1394PubMed Google Scholar). The mechanistic basis of the opposing functions of the angiopoietins is unknown. There are at least three possible mechanisms: (i) Ang-2 may act as a competitive inhibitor of Ang-1 binding to Tie-2, (ii) Ang-2 may bind to Tie-2 in a subtly different fashion and induce other downstream signaling pathways with a different temporal activation pattern, or (iii) Ang-2 may also bind to another endothelial cell surface receptor and thereby block Ang-1-dependent Tie-2 signaling indirectly. The complexity of differential Tie-2 functions is also highlighted by recent studies, which indicate that Ang-2 does not simply act as an inhibitor of Ang-1 but that it may also act agonistically by itself as shown by the following: (i) Ang-2 is capable of stimulating endothelial Tie-2 autophosphorylation upon long term stimulation (i.e. longer than 12 h; (13Teichert-Kuliszewska K.

Based on the above observations and considerations, the present study was aimed at mapping the binding sites of Ang-1 and Ang-2 within the Tie-2 receptor to elucidate whether differential receptor binding is involved in regulating agonistic versus antagonistic functions of the angiopoietins. A number of Tie-2 truncation mutants was generated toward this end, and Ang-1 and Ang-2 binding was studied biochemically as well as in ELISA-based competition assays. Complementary experiments with cells expressing a truncation mutant of the murine Tie-2 receptor, which lacks parts of the mapped binding site of Ang-1 and Ang-2 confirmed the amino-terminal binding site in the Tie-2 receptor. Collectively, the experiments provide evidence that different angiopoietin ligand binding sites in the Tie-2 receptor are not involved in regulating agonistic versus antagonistic functions of the angiopoietins. Immortalized endothelioma cell lines were generated by infecting primary cells from several litters of embryonic day 9.5 embryos derived from matings of Tie-2+/− mice with a retrovirus coding for the Polyoma virus middle T-antigen as described previously (16Montesano R.

Immunol. 1998; 28: 3086-3099Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). The cells were characterized by fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis and express the endothelial markers PECAM-1, ICAM-2, CD34, endoglin, MECA-32, and Flk-1. Endotheliomas were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's Medium, high glucose supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 3 mm l-glutamin, 5 μm β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 1% non-essential amino acids, and penicillin and streptomycin. CHO cells were cultured in α-MEM with ribonucleosides and deoxyribonucleosides (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. For selection of clones, 10 μg/ml blasticidine S was added. Insect cells (Sf9) were cultured in Ex-Cell 400 withl-glutamine (JHR Bioscience) without further supplements. Human Ang-1 and Ang-2 were cloned by RT-PCR from mRNA isolated from human melanoma cells (A375) for Ang-1 and human umbilical vein endothelial cells for Ang-2 using standard protocols. The amino-terminal signal sequences were replaced by the signal sequence of human IgG1 fused to amyc tag using the following linker: AAGCTTGAATTCGTCGACGCCACCATGAACTGGATCTGGCGCATCCTCTTCCTCGTCGGCGCTGCTACCGGCGCTCATTCTGAGGTACAAGCCATGAAGAGCAGCGAACAAAAACTCATCTCAGAAGAGGATCTGTCCATGGTC. The linker with human Ang-1 or human Ang-2 was cloned into pVL1393 by digesting the vector EcoRI/BamHI. The linker was digested with EcoRI/NcoI, and the PCR products were digested with NcoI/BamHI. The resulting plasmids carry the signal sequence of human IgG1 fused to amyc tag followed by human Ang-1 from aa Gly-18–Phe-498 (pVL1392/ myc-Ang-1) as well as the signal sequence of human IgG1 fused to a myc tag followed by human Ang-2 from aa Asn-21–Phe-496 (pVL1392/myc-Ang-2). Soluble truncated Tie-2-Fc receptors were generated by PCR cloning. The Tie-2 part of the constructs was generated by PCR using the following primers: for sTie-2-(1–730)-Fc, f131Tie-2, 5′-ggagagatttcgggaagcatggactctttag-3′, and rTie-2Mlu, 5′-acgcgtacaccagttcatgagaaaaggctgggtt-3′; for sTie-2-(1–440)-Fc, f131Tie-2 and rTie-2-(1–440)Mlu, 5′-ggcacgcgtcaatgttgaagggcttttccaccat-3′; for sTie-2-(1–360)-Fc, f131Tie-2 and rTie-2-(1–360)Mlu, 5′-ggcacgcgtcttctatatgatctggcaaatccac-3′; for sTie-2-(1–199)-Fc, f131Tie-2 and rTie-2-(1–199)Mlu, 5′-ggcacgcgtcgaagaggtttcctcctatatacct-3′; for sTie-2-(211–360)-Fc, fTie-2-(1–211)Eco, 5′-ggcgaattctgtgaagcccagaagtggggacctgaatgc-3′ and rTie-2-(1–360)Mlu; for sTie-2-(211–730)-Fc, fTie-2-(1–211)Eco and rTie-2Mlu; and for sTie-2-(341–730)-Fc, fTie-2-(1–341)Eco, 5′-ggcgaattcgagagagaaggcataccgaggatgacccca-3′ and rTie-2Mlu. The fragments were digested with EcoRI and MluI. The Fc tag derives from the plasmid hFc(IgG)pUCBM20 and encompasses the CH2 and CH3 domain of human IgG1. 3G. Siemeister, unpublished data. MluI- andPstI-digested plasmids were used for the cloning of the fusion genes containing the Fc tag. The expression plasmids for sTie-2-(1–730)-Fc, sTie-2-(1–440)-Fc, sTie-2-(1–360)-Fc, and sTie-2-(1–199)-Fc were generated by ligating the corresponding PCR fragment together with the Fc tag into the EcoRI andPstI site of pVL1393 (Pharmingen). The expression plasmids for sTie-2-(211–360)-Fc, sTie-2-(211–730)-Fc, and sTie-2-(341–730)-Fc were generated by ligating the corresponding PCR fragment and the Fc tag into the EcoRI and PstI site of pAc67-A (Pharmingen). Total RNA was isolated from several Tie-2 null and WT mouse endothelioma cell lines using PeqGold RNAPure™ according to the manufacturer's recommendations (PeqLab). The Superscript First-strand Synthesis system (Invitrogen) was used for cDNA synthesis as recommended by the manufacturer with the primer T2 FN1/2R (5′–GAGGAGGGAGTCCGATAGAC-3′) using 2 μg of total RNA from Tie-2 WT or Tie-2 mutant endothelioma cell lines, respectively. PCR was performed using the primers T2 UTR5 (5′–CCATGCGAGCGGGAAGTCGC-3′) and T2 FN1R (5′–ACACACAGCTCGTAGTCAGTCCGC-3′). RT-PCR from RNA of different independent WT cell lines yielded a band of ∼1.6 kb (expected size, 1642 bps), and RT-PCR from RNA of several Tie 2 mutant cell lines yielded a band of about 1.3 kb. PCR products from RNA of two independent Tie-2 mutant cell lines were cloned into pCRII using the TA cloning kit (Invitrogen) yielding pCRII mTie-2 ΔE2. Sequencing with an automated sequencer (ABI 373) revealed that the actual size of the PCR fragment from the Tie-2 mutant cell lines is 1330 bps and that the sequences coded for by exactly the second exon (312 bps, corresponding to 104 aa) are missing. First, the complete mouse Tie-2 open reading frame sequence was cloned into pBSII (Stratagene) as aBglII-partial/BsrGI fragment and then isolated from the pBSII subclone as a XbaI/Bsp120I fragment, which was then ligated into XbaI/NotI-digested pJFE14 (18Takebe Y. Seiki M. Fujisawa J. Hoy P. Yokota K. Arai K. Yoshida M. Arai N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 466-472Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (a gift from Regeneron Pharmaceuticals) to create pJFE14 mTie-2. pEF6 mTie-2 was created by releasing the Tie-2 open reading frame sequence fragment from pJFE14 mTie-2 by digestion withEcoRI and ClaI and ligation intoEcoRI/BstBI-digested pEF6 (Invitrogen). To produce pJFE14 mTie-2 ΔE2, a fragment harboring the Tie-2 deletion was isolated from pCRII mTie-2 ΔE2 by digesting withBglII, filling in with Klenow fragment to produce a blunt end, and recutting with SpeI. This fragment was ligated into pJFE14 mTie-2 that had been linearized with XbaI, blunt-ended as above, and recut with SpeI. pEF6 mTie-2 ΔE2 was assembled by three-fragment ligation of anEcoRI/SpeI fragment derived from pCRII mTie-2 ΔE2, a SpeI/BsrGI fragment from pEF6 mTie-2, and a pEF6 vector fragment derived from pEF6 mTie-2 by cutting withEcoRI and BsrGI. The cDNA-containing plasmids were used for transfection of Sf9 cells along with linearized wild-type baculovirus DNA. Recombinant baculoviruses were obtained using the BaculoGoldTM transfection kit following standard protocols (Pharmingen). For protein production, Sf9 cells grown in serum-free medium at a density of 2 × 106 cells/ml were infected with a multiplicity of infection of 10. Myc-tagged Ang-1 and Myc-tagged Ang-2 were purified from Sf9 supernatants 72 h after infection. The supernatants were filtered and bound to Concanavalin A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) (1 ml of Sepharose/100 ml Sf9 supernatant) overnight at 4 °C. The beads were filled into an empty PD-10 column and washed with 10 column volumes of 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mm MnCl2. The angiopoietins were eluted with 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 m NaCl, 0.5m methyl-α-d-manno-pyranoside, 0.5m methyl-α-d-gluco-pyranoside. The angiopoietin-containing fractions were pooled and dialyzed against 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol. Before freezing of the proteins, 100 μg/ml BSA was added for stabilization. Functional angiopoietin protein preparations had a purity of up to 50%. Further purification led to aggregation and inactivation upon repeated freeze-thaw cycles. Different truncated sTie-2-Fc molecules were purified from Sf9 supernatants 96 h after infection. Cells were grown in medium without fetal calf serum supplementation. Supernatants were filtered and bound to protein-A-Sepharose CL-6B (Amersham Biosciences) (1 ml of Sepharose/100 ml Sf9 supernatant) overnight at 4 °C. The Sepharose beads were filled into an empty PD-10 column. The matrix was washed with 5 column volumes of high salt buffer (50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl) and 5 column volumes of low salt buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mmNaCl). The protein was eluted with eight column volumes 100 mm sodium citrate, pH 3.0. The elution fractions were immediately titrated to pH 7.0 by the addition of 1 m Hepes buffer, pH 9.0. Purified truncated sTie-2-Fc protein was dialyzed against PBS and filter-sterilized. Individual preparations had a purity of ∼95%. CHO cells were transfected with the different Tie-2 expression plasmids using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For selection of a pool of a stably transfected clones, 10 μg/ml Blasticidin S was added to the medium. Experiments were performed as described (6Maisonpierre P.C. Suri C. Jones P.F. Bartunkova S. Wiegand S.J. Radziejewski C. Compton D. McClain J. Aldrich T.H. Papadopoulos N. Daly T.J. Davis S. Sato T.N. Yancopoulos G.D. Science. 1997; 277: 55-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (2927) Google Scholar). Briefly, transfected CHO cells were starved overnight in serum-free medium. Cells were stimulated with 5 μg/ml Myc-Ang-1 or Myc-Ang-2 for 15 min, after which the cells were lysed and Tie-2 was precipitated using anti-Tie-2 (clone AB33) (Upstate Biotechnology). Samples were resolved on a 10% SDS-PAGE. Blotted gels were probed with a P-Tyr antibody (PY20) (Upstate Biotechnology). The stripped blots were then reprobed with an anti-Tie-2 antibody (C-20) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Myc-Ang-1 or Myc-Ang-2 (2 μg/well) was absorbed to the surface of 96-well plates (Nunc-Immuno Plate Maxi-Sorb) for 18 h at 4 °C. The plates were washed twice with TBS, and nonspecific binding was blocked with TBS containing 2% BSA for 1 h at room temperature. Competition was performed by adding 30 pmol to 0.3 pmol of the truncated sTie-2-Fc molecules in the presence of 0.3 pmol of biotinylated full-length sTie-2-Fc in TBS. The plates were washed after a 2-h incubation, and a streptavidin-alkaline phosphatase conjugate was added for 1 h. Plates were then washed three times with TBS and once with alkaline phosphatase buffer, after which they were developed with 1 mg/mlp-nitrophenyl-phosphate, andA 405 was determined spectrophotometrically. A 1000-fold excess of full-length sTie-2-Fc was added to determine 100% competition (quadruplicate determination per plate). Likewise, 100% binding of biotinylated sTie-2-Fc was determined in the absence of unlabeled truncated sTie-2-Fc. Unspecific competition by the Fc tag was controlled by using sVEGF-R2-Fc for competition (sVEGF-R2 was essentially produced and purified according to the sTie-2-Fc production protocol). All binding experiments were performed at least twice with duplicate determinations. Binding curves were plotted as competition curves based on a one-site competition assumption. Fresh conditioned insect cell medium (500 μl of supernatant of Sf9 cells expressing either Myc-Ang-1 of Myc-Ang-2) were incubated with 20 pmol of sTie-2-Fc or 20 pmol of truncated sTie-2-Fc and 30 μl of protein-A-Sepharose in 1 ml of TBS, 2% BSA for 1 h at room temperature. The Sepharose beads were spun down and washed three times with TBS containing 0.1% Nonidet P-40. The beads were boiled in sample buffer, and samples were loaded on a 7.5% SDS-PAGE. Western blots were analyzed with an anti-Myc antibody (anti-Myc 9E10, ATCC). Cultured CHO cells and Tie-2-expressing CHO cells (80,000/well) were seeded in a 24-well plate (Greiner) and exposed to 5 μg/ml Myc-Ang-1 or Myc-Ang-2 for 5 min. Cells were washed twice with PBS and fixed with cold methanol. Fixed cells were washed twice with PBS and blocked with 250 μl of buffer (PBS containing 1% fetal calf serum and 0.2% Tween) for 30 min. After blocking, 250 μl of first antibody in blocking buffer was added for 1 h at room temperature. The anti-Myc antibody 9E10 (1 mg/ml; ATCC) was used for the detection of Myc-Ang-1 and Myc-Ang-2. Likewise, the anti-Tie-2 antibody (clone AB33) (4 μg/ml; Upstate Biotechnology) was used for the detection of Tie-2. The cells were washed three times for 10 min with PBS before the addition of the biotinylated anti-mouse IgG antibody (DAKO, 1:500) for 30 min at room temperature. Cells were washed three times and incubated with streptavidin-fluorescein isothiocyanate (1:50) or streptavidin-RPE (1:50) (DAKO) and Hoechst dye (1:5000) for an additional 30 min. Full-length Ang-1 protein has not yet been generally available so far due to inherent difficulties in purifying the bioactive molecule. Instead, a modified variant, designated as Ang-1*, in which the 73 amino-terminal amino acids of hAng-2 are fused to hAng-1 at residue 77, has been used in angiopoietin bioassays (6Maisonpierre P.C. Suri C. Jones P.F. Bartunkova S. Wiegand S.J. Radziejewski C. Compton D. McClain J. Aldrich T.H. Papadopoulos N. Daly T.J. Davis S. Sato T.N. Yancopoulos G.D.

Science. 1999; 286: 2511-2514Crossref PubMed Scopus (1176) Google Scholar). Thus, to map the angiopoietin binding sites in the Tie-2 receptor, we first set up experiments aimed at purifying full-length bioactive Ang-1 and Ang-2 as well as the different truncation mutants of sTie-2. Expression of Myc-tagged human Ang-1 and Myc-tagged human Ang-2 in insect cells (Sf9) using a baculovirus expression system followed by ConA affinity purification and storage in the presence of 100 μg/ml BSA yielded functional Ang-1 and Ang-2 in purities up to 50% (Fig. 2 A). Western blot analysis of Ang-1 and Ang-2 under non-reducing conditions showed that Ang-1 is an oligomieric, most likely hexameric protein, whereas Ang-2 runs as a dimeric molecule (Fig. 2 B). Both Myc-tagged angiopoietins bind to Tie-2 with an affinity of 3 nm (data not shown) as described previously (5Davis S. Aldrich T.H. Jones P.F. Acheson A. Compton D.L. Jain V. Ryan T.E. Bruno J.

Both Ang-1 and Ang-2 bind uniformly to cultured endothelial cells and are rapidly internalized as evidenced by the intracellular granular staining (Fig. 2,C–E). Functional activity of the angiopoietins was tested by Tie-2 phosphorylation in nonendothelial cells (see Fig. 6) as well as in a three-dimensional spheroidal in gel angiogenesis assay (Ref. 14Korff T.

As shown in A, Polyoma middle T immortalized endothelioma cells were generated from mouse embryos homozygous for a targeted insertion into exon 2 of the Tie-2 gene (cell lines 9, 25, 32, and 43); heterozygously Tie-2-targeted mouse embryos (cell line 27); and wild-type mouse embryos (cell line 38). Cell lysates were separated by 7.5% SDS-PAGE, blotted, and probed with an anti-Tie-2 antibody. Wild-type endothelioma cells express full-length 166-kDa Tie-2. In contrast, all homozygous Tie-2 mutant endothelioma cells express a smaller Tie-2 band with an apparent molecular size of around 133 kDa. Heterozygous mutant endothelioma cells express the wild-type 166-kDa band as well as the mutant 133-kDa band. As shown in B, CHO cells were transfected with either a plasmid coding for full-length mTie-2 (lanes 1–3) or a plasmid that codes for the mutant murine Tie-2-(Δ aa 1–103) (lanes 4–6). Cells were starved for 12 h and stimulated with 5 μg/ml Myc-Ang-1 or Myc-Ang-2 for 15 min. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with an anti-Tie-2 antibody, separated by SDS-PAGE, blotted, and probed with an anti-P-tyrosine antibody (upper panel) and reprobed with an anti-Tie-2 antibody. Both Ang-1 and Ang-2 are capable of inducing Tie-2 phosphorylation. In contrast, the mutant Tie-2 lacking aa 1–103 is not capable of becoming phosphorylated upon Ang-1 or Ang-2 stimulation.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The following amino-terminal truncation mutants of the extracellular domain of Tie-2 were expressed as Fc fusion proteins: (i) sTie-2-(1–199)-Fc consisting of the first Ig-like loop of"

In humans, mutations in fibrillins result in long bone overgrowth as well as other distinct phenotypes. Whether fibrillins form independent microfibrillar networks or can co-polymerize, forming a single microfibril, is not known. However, this knowledge is required to determine whether phenotypes arise because of loss of singular or composite functions of fibrillins. Immunolocalization experiments using tissues and de novo matrices elaborated by cultured cells demonstrated that both fibrillins can be present in the same individual microfibril in certain tissues and that both fibrillins can co-polymerize in fibroblast cultures. These studies suggest that the molecular information directing fibrillin fibril formation may be similar in both fibrillins. Furthermore, these studies provide a molecular basis for compensation of one fibrillin by the other during fetal life. In postnatal tissues, fibrillin-2 antibodies demonstrated exuberant staining in only one location: peripheral nerves. This surprising finding implicates distinct functions for fibrillin-2 in peripheral nerves, because a unique feature in humans and in mice mutant for fibrillin-2 is joint contractures that resolve over time.

However, because the expression of fibrillin-2 corresponds primarily to early morphogenesis, it has been proposed that fibrillin-2 regulates the early process of elastic fiber assembly, whereas fibrillin-1 provides mostly force-bearing structural support (4Zhang H., Hu, W.

Sakai L.Y. Little C.D. Dev. Dyn. 1993; 196: 70-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). These studies have indicated that, in early embryonic and fetal tissues, the distribution of the two fibrillins is similar, with preferential accumulation of fibrillin-2 in elastic fiber-rich tissues. Mutations in the fibrillin genes result in two related inherited diseases of connective tissue. Major phenotypic features of the Marfan syndrome (OMIM number 154700), caused by mutations in FBN1, appear in cardiovascular (aortic dilatation or aortic dissection), skeletal (long bone overgrowth), and ocular (ectopia lentis) tissues. The phenotype of congenital contractural arachnodactyly (CCA) (OMIM number 121050), caused by mutations in FBN2, overlaps with some of the skeletal features (arachnodactyly and scoliosis) of the Marfan syndrome, but cardiovascular and ocular features are usually absent. Together with expression studies, these genetic data suggest that fibrillin-2 performs a function comparable with fibrillin-1 in skeletal but not in other connective tissues. Therefore, expression of fibrillin-2 in postnatal tissues is expected to be restricted to skeletal connective tissues. Fibrillin-2 null mice (13Arteaga-Solis E. Gayraud B. Lee S.Y. Shum L. Sakai L. Ramirez F. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 275-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) are viable and fertile. However, they are born with contractures of the small and large joints, which resolve a few days after birth. This common phenotype, joint contractures, demonstrated that loss of fibrillin-2 in homozygous fbn2-null mice is equivalent to the dominant-negative effects of mutations in FBN2 in heterozygous individuals with CCA. Similarly, mice deficient in fibrillin-1 display cardiovascular and skeletal features similar to those of the Marfan syndrome (14Pereira L. Lee S.Y. Gayraud B. Andrikopoulos K. Shapiro S.D. Bunton T. Biery N.J. Dietz H.C. Sakai L.Y. Ramirez F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3819-3823Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar), indicating that loss of fibrillin-1 is equivalent to the dominant-negative effects of heterozygous FBN1 mutations. Neither fibrillin-1 deficiency nor fibrillin-2 deficiency results in early embryonic lethality, even though both fibrillins are present in the developing embryo at gastrulation. In addition to contractures, mice lacking fibrillin-2 display a limb patterning defect, bilateral syndactyly (13Arteaga-Solis E. Gayraud B. Lee S.Y. Shum L. Sakai L. Ramirez F. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 275-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). However, no other obvious early fetal or embryonic phenotype has been found, despite the restriction of fibrillin-2 expression primarily to developing tissues. And, there are also no apparent abnormalities in elastic fiber assembly or morphology, even though preferential distribution to elastic fiber-rich matrices had been originally noted in expression studies. These genetic investigations in humans and mice suggest that fibrillins perform both overlapping and unique functions. However, biochemical and morphological studies of the fibrillins, especially fibrillin-2, have not elucidated the distinctive or shared functional contributions of the fibrillins to microfibril assembly, to elastic fiber assembly and specific tissue architectures, or to cellular differentiation. The major obvious function of the fibrillins is microfibril assembly, and yet it is not known whether both fibrillins polymerize separately to form distinct independent microfibrils or co-polymerize to form microfibril heteropolymers. The unique functions of fibrillin-2, which result in joint contractures and bilateral syndactyly when lost, are not yet understood. To begin to resolve these issues, detailed analyses of fibrillin-2 in developing and postnatal tissues are required. The investigations reported here demonstrate fibrillin-2 immunolocalization in fetal and postnatal human tissues, compare fibrillin-1 and fibrillin-2 protein synthesis and fibril formation in various cell types, show that both fibrillins can be found in the same microfibril, and identify cryptic epitopes in fibrillin-2, which may indicate domains important for fibrillin-2 assembly into microfibrils or binding to ligands. Of most significance, these studies suggest that the molecular information directing fibrillin fibril formation may be similar in both fibrillins and thus provide a molecular basis for compensation of one fibrillin by the other during fetal life. In addition, localization of fibrillin-2 to postnatal peripheral nerves implicates a unique function for fibrillin-2 in peripheral nerves. Balb/cJ mice (Jackson Laboratories, Bar Harbor, ME) and New Zealand White rabbits were immunized with purified recombinant fibrillin-2 polypeptide, rF37. MAbs were prepared by fusing splenic lymphocytes with NS-1 myeloma cells followed by cloning in selective medium, as we have previously described (3Sakai L.Y. Keene D.R. Engvall E. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 2499-2509Crossref PubMed Scopus (909) Google Scholar). Supernatants from wells containing hybridomas were initially screened by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), using rF37 as the coated substrate. Selected wells were cloned by limiting dilution. Cloned cell lines were expanded and grown in cell culture medium containing IgG-free fetal calf serum. MAbs were purified from conditioned medium by chromatography using GammaBind Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). Stock solutions of purified mAbs were utilized at concentrations of around 1 mg/ml in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Construction of the expression vectors for recombinant fibrillin-2 polypeptides rF37 and rF33 has been described (11Keene D.R. Jordan C.D. Reinhardt D.P. Ridgway C.C. Ono R.N. Corson G.M. Fairhurst M. Sussman M.D. Memoli V.A. Sakai L.Y. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1997; 45: 1069-1082Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Expression plasmids for the production of recombinant fibrillin-2 subdomains rF46 (coding for Ser145-Ile358), rF47 (Thr493-Leu995), rF48 (Asp359-Thr656), rF49 (Asp359-Ile808), and rF50 (Asp809-Leu995) were constructed from PCR-amplified fragments using Vent polymerase (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) from template pCEPSP-rF37 (11Keene D.R. Jordan C.D. Reinhardt D.P. Ridgway C.C. Ono R.N. Corson G.M. Fairhurst M. Sussman M.D. Memoli V.A. Sakai L.Y. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1997; 45: 1069-1082Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Sense primers for constructs rF47, rF48, rF49, and rF50 were designed to introduce anNheI restriction site at the 5′ end. Antisense primers for constructs rF46, rF48, and rF49 were designed to introduce the sequence for 6 C-terminal histidine residues, a stop codon, as well as anXhoI restriction site at the 3′ end. For the expression constructs with the 5′ end (rF46) or the 3′ ends (rF47, rF50) identical to pCEPSP-rF37, sense primers and antisense primers were chosen to anneal to the noncoding regions of the expression plasmid. Each restricted PCR product was ligated directly into the episomal expression vector pCEP4/γ2III4, which contains the sequence for the BM40/SPARC signal peptide (15Mayer U. Poschl E. Gerecke D.R. Wagman D.W. Burgeson R.E. Timpl R. FEBS Lett. 1995; 365: 129-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Each insert was then verified by DNA sequencing. PCR amplification for rF46 was done using sense primer DR69 (5′-TAAGCAGAGCTCGTTTAGTGAACCG-3′) and antisense primer DR137 (5′-ACCGCTCGAGCTAGTGATGGTGATGGTGATGGATGCATCGAGAGCCATCTGTTGAGG-3′). A 670-bp NheI-XhoI restricted fragment was then subcloned into pCEP4/γ2III4 and designated pCEPSP-rF46. For rF47, amplification was done using sense primer DR138 (5′-CGTAGCTAGCGACAATAGATATCTGTAAGCATCATGC-3′) and antisense primer DR68 (5′-TCATGTCTGGATCCGGCCTTGCC-3′). A 1537-bpNheI-XhoI fragment was then subcloned into pCEP4/γ2III4 and designated pCEPSP-rF47. For amplification of rF48, sense primer DR66 (5′-CGTAGCTAGCCGATCAGAGAACAGGCATGTG-3′) and antisense primer DR139 (5′-ACCGCTCGAGCTAGTGATGGTGATGGTGATGAGTACAGTAACGCCCATTTGGAGC-3′) were used. A 922-bp NheI-XhoI fragment was then subcloned into pCEP4/γ2III4 and designated pCEPSP-rF48. For rF49, primer DR66 and antisense primer DR140 (5′-ACCGCTCGAGCTAGTGATGGTGATGGTGATGAATACAGTTTCTTCCAGAGGCATCTGG-3′) were used for amplification. A 1378-bp NheI-XhoI fragment was then subcloned into pCEP4/γ2III4 and designated pCEPSP-rF49. For rF50, sense primer DR141 (5′-CGTAGCTAGCTGACATTGATGAATGTTTAGTAAACAG-3′) and primer DR68 were used for amplification. A 589-bpNheI-XhoI fragment was then subcloned into pCEP4/γ2III4 and designated pCEPSP-rF50. Transfection of 293/EBNA cells was performed as described previously (10Reinhardt D.P. Keene D.R.

Purification of recombinant polypeptides was achieved using chelating chromatography (10Reinhardt D.P. Keene D.R. Corson G.M. Poschl E. Bächinger H.P. Gambee J.E. Sakai L.Y. J. Mol.

ELISA, with rF37 as the coated substrate, was used to screen hybridoma supernatants. To demonstrate antibody specificity, ELISA was performed using various recombinant polypeptides as the coated substrate. Substrates were incubated in microtiter wells at concentrations of 25 nm in 15 mm Na2CO3, 35 mmNaHCO3, pH 9.2, for 16 h at 4 °C. The wells were then washed three times with Tris-buffered saline (TBS) including 0.025% Tween 20 (Bio-Rad). 5% nonfat dry milk in TBS was incubated for 1 h at 25 °C to block nonspecific sites. Primary polyclonal antiserum was 2-fold serially diluted, beginning with an initial dilution of 1:50, in 2% nonfat dry milk in TBS, and incubated for 2 h at 25 °C. After washing the wells three times with TBS/Tween-20, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Sigma), diluted 1:1,000 in 2% nonfat dry milk in TBS, was incubated for 1.5 h at 25 °C. After washing again, color reaction was achieved using 1 mg/ml 5-aminosalicylic acid (Sigma) in 20 mm phosphate buffer, pH 6.8, containing 0.1% H2O2, for 4–5 min and stopped by adding 2m NaOH. Color absorbance was determined at 492 nm using a Titertek Multiskan photometer. For immunoblotting experiments to map epitopes recognized by mAbs, ∼0.25 μg of recombinant polypeptide was loaded per lane. Western blotting was performed as described (11Keene D.R. Jordan C.D. Reinhardt D.P. Ridgway C.C. Ono R.N. Corson G.M. Fairhurst M. Sussman M.D. Memoli V.A. Sakai L.Y. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1997; 45: 1069-1082Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Light and electron microscopy of tissue samples were performed as described previously (17Sakai L.Y. Keene D.R. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 245: 29-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). MAbs to peripherin and S-100 were purchased from Novocastra and used according to their instructions. Double labeling was performed using tissues incubated en bloc with pAb 9543 and mAb 48 or 143. Rabbit antibodies (to fibrillin-1) were identified using a 10-nm secondary gold conjugate. Mouse antibodies (to fibrillin-2) were identified using a 5-nm secondary gold conjugate. 18-week fetal human skin was homogenized, immunolabeled in suspension, washed extensively by centrifugation and resuspension, then absorbed onto carbon-coated grids and dried in the presence of 4% phosphotungstic acid. The following established human cell cultures were purchased from American Type Culture Collection: fetal lung fibroblasts, embryo fibroblasts, SW1353 (chondrosarcoma), MG63 (osteosarcoma), HT1080 (fibrosarcoma), A204 (rhabdomyosarcoma), U20S (osteosarcoma), Wish (transformed amniotic epithelial cells), and Jar (choriocarcinoma). A glioblastoma cell line, U251MG, was obtained from Dr. Eva Engvall. HaCaT human keratinocytes were obtained from Drs. Norbert Fusenig and Dirk Breitkreutz. Neonatal skin fibroblasts were derived from explant cultures of human foreskin obtained at circumcision. Adult and postnatal skin, tendon, and ligament fibroblasts were derived from explant cultures of dissected tissues obtained from surgical samples with informed consent. All of these cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen). Aortic smooth muscle cells were purchased from Clonetics and grown in a medium supplied by Clonetics. Cells were plated in 4-well permanox chamber slides (Nalge Nunc International, Naperville, IL) at a concentration of 2 × 105 cells/ml. After 4 days, cells were fixed for 10 min with −20 °C acetone. After rehydration with PBS, the cells were incubated for 1 h with 10 μg/ml mAb 201 or mAb 48. The cells were washed with PBS, then labeled for 30 min with FITC-conjugated sheep anti-mouse IgG (Sigma). Labeled cells were washed with PBS, coverslipped with glycerol, 10% PBS, and viewed using a Zeiss Axiophot equipped for epifluorescence. For double-labeling experiments, neonatal human dermal fibroblasts were examined on day 2 after passaging, using pAb 9543 together with mAbs 48 and 143 and TRITC-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Sigma) together with FITC-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Sigma). In double-labeling co-culture experiments, 1 × 105 adult (age 35 years) dermal fibroblasts were plated with 1 × 105 nontransfected 293 cells, and cultures were grown and stained as described. For testing effects of specific domains of fibrillins on fibril assembly, transfected 293 cells stably expressing recombinant fibrillin polypeptides were trypsinized, counted, and plated together with trypsinized and counted normal human dermal fibroblasts. 2 × 105 fibroblasts were mixed with 2.5 × 104, 5 × 104, 1 × 105, and 2 × 105 transfected cells in 1 ml of medium and plated into chamber slides. After allowing time for fibrillin fibrils to form (120 h), slides were fixed in methanol at −80 °C and stained with mAb 201, which recognizes fibrillin-1 at a site not contained in any of the recombinant peptides tested in these experiments. One million cells were plated in a 60-mm dish and grown for 72 h. The cell layers were washed with PBS and then incubated for 24 h in 3 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without serum. The conditioned medium was harvested and treated with 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Cell layers were washed and then scraped into 300 μl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The medium (0.5 ml, concentrated by trichloroacetic acid precipitation, per lane) and cell layer (50 μl, per lane) were analyzed by SDS-PAGE on 3–5% gradient gels. Identical samples were analyzed by Coomassie Blue staining and by immunoblotting. For the immunoblots, samples were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were blocked in 5% nonfat dry milk and then incubated for 2 h with either mAb 201 or mAb 48. Blots were washed and then incubated for 2 h with a 1:1,000 dilution of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG. Bound antibody was visualized according to the manufacturer's instructions using either horseradish peroxidase developer 4-chloronaphthol (Bio-Rad) for mAb 201 or Super Signal substrate (Pierce, Rockford, IL) for mAb 48. Poly(A)+ RNA was prepared from cultured A204 and Jar cells using the FastTrack Kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. RNA (3 μg/lane) was fractionated on a 1% formaldehyde-agarose gel and blotted by capillary transfer to a nylon membrane (Hybond-N+, Amersham Biosciences). Hybridization probes of similar size were prepared from the C-terminal and 3′-untranslated regions of fibrillin-1 and fibrillin-2 to ensure specificity. For Northern analyses of A204 cells, probes were prepared by PCR using primer pairs GMC10A (5′-CGAATCACAACAGATACTTGATCG-3′) and FBN1–9223AS (5′-AGCACGATTACAGTATACACACACTT-3′) for fibrillin-1 and FBN2–3FS (5′-AGCCTAGAGAGTGTCGACATGG-3′) and FBN2–9207AS (5′-CTAAAGAAAAACAAGTGAGTTTCC-3′). The templates were cDNA clones HFBN-10 for fibrillin-1 and 3′A (2Zhang H. Apfelroth S.D., Hu, W. Davis E.C. Sanguineti C. Bonadio J. Mecham R.P. Ramirez F. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 855-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar) for fibrillin-2. The PCR products were gel purified and then radiolabeled by random primer extension in the presence of [α-32P]dCTP. The blots were hybridized overnight at 55 °C in aqueous hybridization buffer, then washed to a final stringency of 55 °C in 0.2× SSC, 0.1% SDS. Bound probe was detected by PhosphorImager (AmershamBiosciences). The blots were stripped and rehybridized with an actin probe for loading control. For Northern analyses of Jar and MG63 cells, probes were prepared using the PCR DIG probe synthesis kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Indianapolis, IN) with primer pairs F1-9160.S (5′-GCAAGGTACAGGTGACTACC-3′) and F1-9822.AS (5′-GAAGGATGCACTGGTGATCCTCTG-3′) for fibrillin-1 and F2-9012.S (5′-GCATATGGCACTAAATGCAC-3′) and F2-9669.AS (5′-CACAGAATGCCAGGTGTTC-3′) for fibrillin-2. The blots were hybridized overnight at 50 °C in 50% (v/v) formamide in High SDS buffer according to the DIG User's Guide (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Washing and detection with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-DIG antibody and CSPD substrate were also according to the manufacturer's instructions. Blots were exposed to Kodak X-Omat film for 2 h. The blots were stripped and rehybridized with an actin probe to demonstrate equal loading. Molecular weights were estimated using an RNA ladder (Invitrogen). To produce monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies specific for fibrillin-2, a large recombinant fibrillin-2 polypeptide, rF37 (11Keene D.R. Jordan C.D. Reinhardt D.P. Ridgway C.C. Ono R.N. Corson G.M. Fairhurst M. Sussman M.D. Memoli V.A. Sakai L.Y. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1997; 45: 1069-1082Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1), was used as immunogen. MAbs 48, 60, 72, 139, 143, 161, 171, and 205 were selected for characterization. Each of these mAbs was positive in ELISA using rF37 as coated substrate, and each immunoblotted rF37 when run on gels without disulfide-bond reducing agent, but failed to immunoblot rF37 when the sample was reduced (data not shown). No cross-reactivity was seen in ELISA or immunoblotting with recombinant polypeptide rF11, the large N-terminal half of fibrillin-1, or with rF6, the large C-terminal half of fibrillin-1 (10Reinhardt D.P. Keene D.R. Corson G.M. Poschl E. Bächinger H.P. Gambee J.E. Sakai L.Y. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 258: 104-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar) (data not shown). Immunoblotting of authentic fibrillins present in cell culture media demonstrated that each mAb recognized authentic fibrillin-2 and did not cross-react with fibrillin-1. Fig. 2 shows the results obtained using fibrillin-2 mAb 48 and mAb 201, specific for fibrillin-1 (3Sakai L.Y. Keene D.R. Engvall E. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 2499-2509Crossref PubMed Scopus (909) Google Scholar, 10Reinhardt D.P. Keene D.R. Corson G.M. Poschl E. Bächinger H.P. Gambee J.E. Sakai L.Y. J. Mol.

Histochem. Cytochem. 1997; 45: 1069-1082Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Embryo cells secrete both fibrillins into the medium and elaborate a fibrillin fibril network in the matrix (see below). Both mAb 48 and mAb 201 immunoblot authentic fibrillins secreted into the medium by embryo cells (Fig. 2 B). A204 rhabdomyosarcoma cells, which secrete fibrillin-1 but not fibrillin-2 into the medium, were used to demonstrate that mAb 48 does not bind to fibrillin-1 (Fig. 2 A). Identical results were obtained for the other fibrillin-2 mAbs, showing that each of the mAbs specifically recognizes authentic fibrillin-2 (data not shown). Polyclonal antibodies, pAb 9543 (generated using rF11 as immunogen) and pAb 0868 (generated using rF37 as immunogen), demonstrated specificity for fibrillin-1 (pAb 9543) or fibrillin-2 (pAb 0868) by immunoblotting (data not shown). ELISA using rF37 and the two large N- and C-terminal halves of fibrillin-1, rF11 and rF6, as substrate showed that pAb 0868 binds only to fibrillin-2, with very little cross-reactivity to fibrillin-1 even at high concentrations (Fig. 3). Similar data were obtained demonstrating specificity of pAb 9543 for fibrillin-1 (Fig. 3). Recombinant polypeptides rF46, rF47, rF48, rF49, and rF50 (Fig. 1) were generated to map the epitopes recognized by the fibrillin-2 mAbs. Immunoblotting positioned the epitope recognized by mAb 161 to cbEGF2; by mAbs 48 and 143 to the 8Cys1/Gly-rich; mAb 171 to EGF4; and mAbs 60, 72, 139, and 205 to the four domains present in rF50 (Fig. 4 A). These epitope-containing regions are indicated schematically in Fig. 4 B. Although all of the mAbs recognized authentic monomeric fibrillin-2, only mAbs 48 and 143 consistently bound to the polymeric microfibrillar form of fibrillin-2 in tissues. MAb 60 yielded partial tissue distribution patterns. Electron microscopic immunolocalization of either mAb 48 or 143 demonstrated specific labeling of microfibrils in both bovine (Fig. 5, A–C) and human (Fig. 5 D) tissues. In the youngest fetal calves obtained (5–7 inches crown to rump, equivalent to second trimester gestation), periodic labeling of fibrillin-2 along an individual microfibril could be discerned (Fig. 5 C). PAb 0868, like pAb 9543, can be used to stain tissues from a variety of different species, including human, bovine, mouse, and frog. In tadpoles, around stage 40, pAb 0868 labeled single fibrils in the skin (Fig. 5 E) and around muscles in the trunk; pAb 9543 did not label these fibrils. Immunofluorescence of all fetal tissues examined displayed comparable distribution patterns and fluorescence signals for fibrillin-1 and fibrillin-2, with the exception of lung (data not shown). Blood vessels in the fetal lung demonstrated similar distributions early in gestation, but fibrillin-2 staining in the lung vasculature was lost midway through gestation. Fibrillin-2 immunofluorescence was abundant in skin (Fig. 6 A) and in all connective tissue sheaths of the peripheral nerve (Fig. 6 B) of 20-week fetal human tissues. In postnatal tissues, there was very little fibrillin-2 immunofluorescence. In neonatal foreskin, scant fibrillin-2 immunofluorescence was observed, primarily close to the dermal-epidermal junction (data not shown). In surgically discarded tissues obtained from children (ages 3–10 years), fibrillin-2 was just detectable in skin (Fig. 6 C, arrow), perichondrium and tendon, but not in skeletal muscle or blood vessels (data not shown). However, exuberant fibrillin-2 immunofluorescence was found in one tissue, peripheral nerve (Fig. 6, C,E, and G), which costained with antibodies to peripherin (Fig. 6, D, F, and H) and S-100 (data not shown). In these samples, fibrillin-1 antibodies stained all areas of the peripheral nerve connective tissue, in a manner similar to Fig. 6 B (data not shown). In contrast, incompl"

For many GPCRs, short term regulation is initiated by agonist-dependent phosphorylation by GPCR kinases (GRKs), such as GRK2, resulting in G protein/receptor uncoupling. GRK2 also regulates signaling by binding Gαq/ll and inhibiting Gαq stimulation of the effector phospholipase Cβ. The binding site for Gαq/ll resides within the amino-terminal domain of GRK2, which is homologous to the regulator of G protein signaling (RGS) family of proteins. To map the Gαq/llbinding site on GRK2, we carried out site-directed mutagenesis of the RGS homology (RH) domain and identified eight residues, which when mutated, alter binding to Gαq/ll. These mutations do not alter the ability of full-length GRK2 to phosphorylate rhodopsin, an activity that also requires the amino-terminal domain. Mutations causing Gαq/ll binding defects impair recruitment to the plasma membrane by activated Gαq and regulation of Gαq-stimulated phospholipase Cβ activity when introduced into full-length GRK2. Two different protein interaction sites have previously been identified on RH domains. The Gα binding sites on RGS4 and RGS9, called the “A” site, is localized to the loops between helices α3 and α4, α5 and α6, and α7 and α8. The adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) binding site of axin involves residues on α helices 3, 4, and 5 (the “B” site) of its RH domain. We demonstrate that the Gαq/ll binding site on the GRK2 RH domain is distinct from the “A” and “B” sites and maps primarily to the COOH terminus of its α5 helix. We suggest that this novel protein interaction site on an RH domain be designated the “C” site.

They transmit the signals from light and odorant receptors as well as the signals initiated by numerous hormones and neurotransmitters. In their inactive state, heterotrimeric G proteins are complexes of three polypeptide chains (Gαβγ). Upon activation, GPCRs catalyze the exchange of GTP for GDP on the Gα subunit resulting in dissociation of the GTP-bound Gα subunit from the Gβγ dimer (1Bourne H.R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 134-142Google Scholar). Gα and Gβγ are then free to regulate effectors such as adenylyl cyclase, phospholipase Cβ (PLCβ), cGMP phosphodiesterase, ion channels, Rho family guanine-nucleotide exchange factors (RhoGEF), and activate mitogen-activated protein kinase signal transduction pathways (2Birnbaumer L.

One common feature of GPCR signaling is the rapid loss of cellular sensitivity even in the presence of a stimulus. Insensitivity to the extracellular stimulus reflects intracellular events: receptor/G protein uncoupling, G protein inactivation, and receptor sequestration (and receptor degradation), which together act to regulate the duration and/or magnitude of the signaling event (6Bohm S.K. Grady E.F. Bunnett N.W. Biochem. J. 1997; 322: 1-18Google Scholar). One mode of receptor desensitization is initiated by phosphorylation of the activated receptor by a kinase of the G protein-coupled receptor kinase (GRK) family (7Pitcher J.A. Freedman N.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 653-692Google Scholar). Phosphorylation then promotes binding of the GPCR to a family of proteins called arrestins (8Krupnick J.G. Benovic J.L. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1998; 38: 289-319Google Scholar). This occludes Gαβγ interaction with receptor and, in some nonvisual cells, leads to sequestration of the receptor away from the plasma membrane into endocytic vesicles (8Krupnick J.G. Benovic J.L. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1998; 38: 289-319Google Scholar, 9Ferguson S.S.G. Downey W.I. Colapietro A. Barak L. Menard L. Caron M.G. Science. 1996; 271: 363-366Google Scholar, 10Goodman Jr., O.

Physiol. 1999; 61: 169-192Google Scholar). GRKs are found in metazoans and, in mammals, the GRK family has seven members (7Pitcher J.A. Freedman N.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 653-692Google Scholar, 12Weiss E.R. Raman D. Shirakawa S. Ducceschi M.H. Bertram P.T. Wong F. Kraft T.W. Osawa S. Mol. Vision. 1998; 4: 27Google Scholar). GRKs are serine/threonine kinases with a tripartite modular structure. A central ∼350 amino acid kinase domain is closely related by sequence identity to those of cAMP-dependent protein kinases, protein kinase C, and ribosomal S6 kinases (13Hanks S. Hunter T. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 576-596Google Scholar). At the carboxyl terminus of the catalytic core (14Hanks S. Quinn A. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 200: 38-62Google Scholar) homology to cAMP-dependent protein kinase predicts a putative “nucleotide gate” (15Narayana N. Cox S. Nguyen-huu X. Ten Eyck L. Taylor S. Structure. 1997; 5: 921-935Google Scholar). The catalytic domain is flanked by an amino-terminal domain of 178 residues and a carboxyl-terminal domain that varies in structure among members of the family. Using distinct mechanisms, the carboxyl-terminal domains of GRKs direct the membrane association of these kinases (16Sterne-Marr R. Benovic J.L. Vitam. Horm. 1995; 51: 193-234Google Scholar, 17Pitcher J.A. Hall R.A. Daaka Y. Zhang J. Ferguson S.S. Hester S. Miller S. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Barak L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12316-12324Google Scholar). The amino-terminal domains of all GRK family members are homologous to the regulator of G-protein signaling (RGS) family of proteins (18Siderovski D.P. Hessel A. Chung S. Mak T.W. Tyers M. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 211-212Google Scholar). RGS proteins are a multifunctional family of proteins of variable length that share a ∼120-amino acid “RGS domain.” In this paper, we refer to this domain as the RGS homology (RH) domain. RGS proteins act as GTPase activating proteins (GAPs) for the Gαi/o(including Gαt) and Gαq family of Gα subunits (19Berman D.M. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1269-1272Google Scholar, 20Hepler J.R. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1999; 20: 376-382Google Scholar, 21Ross E.M. Wilkie T.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 795-827Google Scholar) and as antagonists of Gα/effector interaction (19Berman D.M. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1269-1272Google Scholar,22Hepler J.R. Berman D.M. Gilman A.G. Kozasa T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 428-432Google Scholar). In general, these proteins bind preferentially to the GDP-aluminum fluoride (GDP·AlF 4−) > GTPγS ≫ GDP-bound form of Gα (21Ross E.M. Wilkie T.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 795-827Google Scholar). The crystal structures of the RGS4·Gαi1 complex and the RGS9·Gαt/i chimera·cGMP phosphodiesterase γ complex show that the RGS proteins contact switch regions I, II, and III of Gα, which are polypeptide loops that undergo conformational changes in the transformation between the GDP-bound (inactive) and the GTP-bound (active) states of the G protein. In these examples, the binding of the RGS protein appears to stabilize the three switch regions in a conformation that preferentially binds the transition state for GTP hydrolysis (23Tesmer J.J.G. Berman D.M. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Cell. 1997; 89: 251-261Google Scholar, 24Slep K.C. Kercher M.A. He W. Cowan C.W. Wensel T.G. Sigler P.B. Nature. 2001; 409: 1071-1077Google Scholar). RH domains can be grouped into five subfamilies based on their evolutionary relatedness: R4, R7, R12, RZ, and RA (axin) families (21Ross E.M. Wilkie T.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 795-827Google Scholar). Members of the R4, R7, R12, and RZ families are negative regulators of G protein signaling as described above. The newly described Gαs-specific RGS, RGS-PX1 (25Zheng B. Ma Y.-C. Ostrom R.S. Lavoie C. Gill G.N. Insel P.A. Huang X.-Y. Farquhar M.G. Science. 2001; 294: 1939-1942Google Scholar), likely defines another RGS subfamily as this protein is similarly related to all 5 RGS subfamilies (∼24% amino acid identity). Other families of proteins have RH domains but their roles in regulating heterotrimeric G protein signaling are either distinct from RGS proteins, not well characterized, or do not regulate heterotrimeric G protein signaling. Axin plays a role in the wnt/embryonic development signaling pathway (26Zeng L. Fagotto F. Zhang T. Hsu W. Vasicek T. Perry III, W. Lee J. Tilgfhman S. Gumbiner B. Costantini F. Cell. 1997; 90: 181-192Google Scholar) and shares ∼30% amino acid identity with RGS proteins of other subfamilies. This RH domain has never been demonstrated to bind or GAP a Gα subunit (27Mao J. Yuan H. Xie W. Simon M.I. Wu D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27118-27123Google Scholar). Instead the RH domain of axin binds the tumor suppressor protein, APC (28Kishida S. Yamamoto H. Ikeda S. Kishida M. Sakamoto I. Koyama S. Kikuchi A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10823-10826Google Scholar), a downstream target in the wnt signaling pathway. The APC binding site of axin is distinct from the Gα binding site of RGS proteins. A family of guanine nucleotide exchange factors for the monomeric G protein Rho (RhoGEFs) also has RH domains that share <20% identity to the RGS family. p115RhoGEF, PDZRhoGEF, and LARG (leukemia-associated RhoGEF), bind and in some cases serve as GAPs for Gα12, Gα13, and Gαq, via their RH domains yet they are also downstream effectors of Gα12 and Gα13 (29Kozasa T.

Biol. 2002; 22: 4053-4061Google Scholar). d-AKAP2, dual specificity A kinase anchoring protein 2, binds the regulatory subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase and has 2 RH domains. However, no G protein interaction has been reported for this protein (33Wang L. Sunahara R.K. Krumins A. Perkins G. Crochiere M.L. Mackey M. Bell S. Ellisman M.H. Taylor S.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3220-3225Google Scholar). The RH domain of GRK2 is most closely related to that of axin (26% amino acid identity) and RGS12 (24% amino acid identity) and binds to Gαq and Gα11 in an AlF 4−-dependent fashion, but not to Gαs, Gαi, or Gα12/13 (34Carman C.V. Parent J.L. Day P.W. Pronin A.N. Sternweis P.M. Wedegaertner P.B. Gilman A.G. Benovic J.L. Kozasa T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34483-34492Google Scholar, 35Sallese M. Mariggio S. D'Urbano E.

Med. 2000; 5: 335-340Google Scholar). Whereas all GRKs have putative amino-terminal RH domains, Gα interaction has only been observed for GRK2 and GRK3. Unlike other Gαq-binding RGS proteins such as RGS2 (37Ingi T. Krumins A.M. Chidiac P. Brothers G.M. Chung S. Snow B.E. Barnes C.A. Lanahan A.A. Siderovski D.P. Ross E.M. Gilman A.G. Worley P.F. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 7178-7188Google Scholar), RGS3 (38Scheschonka A. Dessauer C. Sinnaraja S. Chidiac P. Shi C.-S. Kehrl J.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 719-728Google Scholar), RGS4 (22Hepler J.R. Berman D.M. Gilman A.G. Kozasa T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 428-432Google Scholar), and RGS18 (39Nagata Y. Oda M. Nakata H. Shozaki Y. Kozasa T. Todokoro K. Blood. 2001; 97: 3051-3060Google Scholar), the GRK2 RH domain does not stimulate the GTPase activity of Gαq in a single turnover GAP assay and only weakly stimulates GTPase when Gαq is reconstituted with M1 muscarinic receptor and assayed in an agonist-induced steady-state GTPase assay (34Carman C.V. Parent J.L. Day P.W. Pronin A.N. Sternweis P.M. Wedegaertner P.B. Gilman A.G. Benovic J.L. Kozasa T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34483-34492Google Scholar). Because the GRK2 RH domain inhibits Gαq-stimulated PLCβ activity both in vivo and in vitro yet lacks significant GAP activity in vitro, it has been postulated that GRK2 RGS acts by sequestration of Gαq. It is also possible that GRK2 is an effector of Gαq. In this scenario, activation of Gαq would recruit GRK2 to the site of an activated receptor. To investigate the role of GRK2/Gαq interaction in the regulation of Gqsignaling, we have created mutations in the RH domain of GRK2 that result in altered binding to Gαq/11. Surprisingly, we found that the surface of GRK2 used to bind Gαq/11 is distinct from the interaction site utilized by other RGS proteins to bind Gα subunits and from the site used by axin to bind APC. Human embryonic kidney cells (HEK293) and African Green monkey kidney cells (COS-1) were from the American Tissue Culture Collection. Gαq/11-specific polyclonal antibodies were generously provided by Dr. D. Manning or purchased from Santa Cruz Antibodies, and EE-specific monoclonal antibody was provided by Dr. H. Bourne. RGS2-GFP (40Heximer S.P. Lim H. Bernard J.L. Blumer K.J. J. Biol.

Penn, respectively.myo-[3H]Inositol was from AmershamBiosciences, Dowex AG1-X8 resin was from Bio-Rad, and scintillation fluid was from Packard. Molecular biologicals were from Roche Molecular Biochemicals unless otherwise indicated, immunoblotting detection reagents were from Pierce, and all other biochemicals were from Sigma or Fisher. Nucleotides encoding residues 45–178 of bovine GRK2 cDNA were amplified by the polymerase chain reaction using primers that incorporated BamHI and EcoRI restriction sites at the 5′ and 3′ ends of the coding region, respectively. The resulting PCR fragment was subcloned into BamHI and EcoRI sites of the glutathione S-transferase fusion protein vector, pGEX-2T (Amersham Biosciences) to generate pGEX-GRK2-(45–178). Sequential PCR (41Cormack B. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley and Sons, New York1991Google Scholar) was used to produce the E78K, V83A, and D160K derivatives of pGEX-GRK2-(45–178), and Quik-Change mutagenesis (Stratagene) was used to generate all other mutations. The GRK2 portion of each construct was sequenced to verify that only the intended mutation had occurred. GST-GRK2 fusion proteins were expressed and purified by modifications of the procedures of Smith and Johnson (42Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 67: 31-40Google Scholar) and Frangioni and Neel (43Frangioni J.V. Neel B.G. Anal Biochemistry. 1993; 210: 179-187Google Scholar). Briefly, 40-ml cultures in Luria broth containing 5 μg/ml carbenicillin were grown at 37 °C to an optical density of 0.5, fusion protein expression was induced by the addition of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to 0.5 mm, and incubation was continued for 3 h at 25 °C. Cells were pelleted, washed in STE (20 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8), and frozen at −70 °C. Pellets were resuspended on ice in STE containing 100 μg/ml lysozyme and incubated on ice for 15 min before the addition of β-mercaptoethanol to 10 mm, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride to 100 μm, leupeptin to 1 μg/ml, benzamidine to 20 μg/ml, and Sarkosyl to 1.5%. Lysates were sonicated in 10-s bursts followed by 15-s rest periods to reduce viscosity. Insoluble protein was removed by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C and Triton X-100 was added to a final concentration of 2%. The lysate was adjusted to 25 mg/ml protein as determined by the Bradford assay using γ-globulin as a standard (Bio-Rad) and fusion proteins were bound to glutathione-agarose beads (3 ml of packed beads/100 mg of protein) by mixing for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed once with STE, 1.5% Sarkosyl, 2% Triton X-100, three times with STE, and stored in STE, 25% glycerol, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol at −20 °C. To determine the amount of GRK2 associated with glutathione-agarose beads, fusion proteins were eluted in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 10 mm glutathione, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol at room temperature for 1 h. Bradford assays were then carried out on the eluates. Bovine brain extract was used as a source of Gαq/11 for in vitro binding assays. For 1-ml binding assays, 8 μg of fusion protein was incubated overnight at 4 °C with 200 μg of brain extract protein, prepared as described by Carman et al. (34Carman C.V. Parent J.L. Day P.W. Pronin A.N. Sternweis P.M. Wedegaertner P.B. Gilman A.G. Benovic J.L. Kozasa T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34483-34492Google Scholar), in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 2 mm MgSO4, 6 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, 100 mm NaCl, 0.05% C12E10, 5% glycerol, 100 μm GDP in the absence or presence of 30 μm aluminum chloride and 5 mm sodium fluoride (AlF 4−). Glutathione-agarose beads were washed 4 times with the buffer described above (in the absence or presence of AlF 4− as appropriate), proteins were eluted with SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and separated on 12% polyacrylamide gels. The proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose, probed with anti-Gαq/11-specific polyclonal antibodies, incubated with peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody, and Gαq/11 was visualized by chemiluminescence using SuperSignal West Pico (Pierce). COS-1 cells were grown at 37 °C to 50–90% confluence on 10-cm dishes in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. The cells were transfected with 10 μg of total DNA (pcDNA3 alone, pcDNA3-GRK2, or pcDNA3-mutant GRK2) using FuGENE 6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) following the manufacturer's recommendations. The cells were harvested after 48 h, washed twice in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed in 1 ml of buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 0.02% Triton X-100, 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, and 100 μg/ml benzamidine) by Polytron homogenization (two 15-s bursts at 2500 rpm). Lysates were centrifuged for 10 min at 40,000 × g to remove particulate matter and supernatants were then assayed. To test for GRK activity, lysates containing wild type (WT) or mutant GRK2 protein were assayed for their ability to phosphorylate light-activated rhodopsin. Two microliters of COS-1 cell lysate were incubated with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mmEDTA, 5 mm MgCl2, 100 μm ATP, ∼1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, and ∼3.5 μmrhodopsin for 10 min at 30 °C in room light. Reactions were quenched by addition of SDS sample buffer followed by 30 min incubation at room temperature. Rhodopsin was separated by electrophoresis on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and gels were fixed in 0.7 mtrichloroacetic acid, 0.14 m 5′-sulfosalicylic acid for 10 min to remove unincorporated radionucleotide, washed twice in 50% ethanol, 16% acetic acid for 10 min, dried, and then subjected to autoradiography. Rhodopsin bands were excised and counted in a liquid scintillation counter. Repeated measures analysis of variance was used to test the statistical significance. A homology model of the RH domain of GRK2 (residues 42–178) was based on the structure of the RH domain of axin (PDB code 1EMU), which is the closest homolog based on a BLAST (44Altschul S. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E. Lipman D. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Google Scholar) search of the protein data bank (26% identity within residues 64–174 of GRK2). The GRK2 model was built manually using the program O (45Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Google Scholar) by choosing appropriate and reasonable rotamers for nonidentical residues (46Kleywegt G. Jones T. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1998; 54: 1119-1131Google Scholar). In regions that appeared to have higher sequence identity with other RH domains of known structure, the GRK2 model was adjusted locally according to those models. The α5/α6 loop of the GRK2 RH domain has no obvious sequence homology to RH domains of known structure and was ultimately modeled based on the axin structure because the fit of the side chains appeared to be reasonable and because the α5/α6 loops of GRK2 and axin are identical in length (the loop is one amino acid shorter in the RGS family of proteins). The overall model was refined in O to idealize its stereochemistry. To measure in vivo synthesized inositol phosphate (IP), 3.3 × 105 COS-1 cells were plated on 6-cm dishes in DMEM (Mediatech, Herndon, VA) containing penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), and 10% fetal bovine serum. After 24 h, cells were transfected using FuGENE 6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) with 1 μg of total DNA at a ratio of 3:1 pcDNA3-HA-Gαq-R183C:pcDNA3-GRK2 (or mutant derivatives of GRK2). Following a 24-h incubation, transfected cells were replated (∼7 × 104 cell/well) in triplicate on 24-well plates and incubated in complete DMEM. The media was removed and cells were labeled with myo-[3H]inositol (Amersham Biosciences) for 13–18 h in DMEM, without sodium pyruvate, with high glucose, with l-glutamine, and with pyridoxine hydrochloride. In early experiments, labeling was carried out in inositol-free DMEM (Invitrogen), whereas later experiments utilized complete DMEM. Cells were washed in the same media lacking radiolabel but containing 5 mm LiCl for 1 h at 37 °C. The media was removed and cells were lysed with 0.75 ml of 20 mm formic acid for 30 min at 4 °C before 0.1 ml of 3% ammonium hydroxide was added. Inositol was separated from IP by sequential elution from 1-ml Dowex AG1-X8 (100–200 mesh) columns. The inositol fraction was eluted with 0.18% ammonium hydroxide, whereas IPs were eluted with 4 m ammonium formate, 0.2m formic acid. The inositol and IP fractions were mixed with Ultima Gold and Ultima Flo AF scintillation fluid (Packard), respectively, and subjected to scintillation counting. To compare experiments with differing levels ofmyo-[3H]inositol incorporation, IP production was determined as a fraction, IP/(IP + inositol), and plotted relative to the control Gαq-R183C-stimulated IP production. Statistical significance was assessed using repeated measures analysis of variance with a Dunnett's post-test. IP accumulation experiments shown in Fig. 7 were carried out as described above except that HEK293 cells were utilized. In addition, 250 ng of plasmids encoding Gαq-R183C or Gαq-R183C/G188S were transfected with increasing amounts of pcDNA3-GRK2, pcDNA3-RGS2, and pB6-GAIP plasmids as indicated in the figure. pcDNA3 vector was used as carrier DNA such that 1 μg of DNA was transfected in each well of the 6-well plate. An unpaired ttest was used to assess statistical significance. HEK293 cells were transfected in 6-well plates with the indicated amounts of expression plasmids for GRK2-(45–178)-GFP, RGS2-GFP, and/or Gαq using FuGENE 6 reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). After 24 h, transfected cells were replated onto glass coverslips and grown for an additional 24 h before fixing in 3.7% formaldehyde for 20 min. Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and then incubated in blocking buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, and 2.5% nonfat milk). Coverslips were then incubated in blocking buffer containing a 1:100 dilution of anti-Gαqpolyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz) for 1 h. Following washes with blocking buffer, cells were incubated in a 1:100 dilution of Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Molecular Probes) for 30 min. The coverslips were washed and mounted on glass slides with Prolong Antifade reagent. Representative images were recorded by confocal microscopy at the Kimmel Cancer Center Bioimaging Facility using a Bio-Rad MRC-600 laser scanning confocal microscope running CoMos 7.0a software and interfaced to a Zeiss Axiovert 100 microscope with Zeiss Plan-Apo 63× 1.40 NA oil immersion objective. Dual-labeled samples were analyzed using simultaneous excitation at 488 and 568 nm. Images of “x-y” sections through the middle of a cell were recorded. For a growing list of Gq-coupled receptors, it has been reported that desensitization can occur in a GRK2-dependent but phosphorylation-independent fashion. For example, hormone-mediated PLCβ activation via the metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR1a) (47Dale L.B. Bhattacharya M. Anborgh P.H. Murdoch B. Bhatia M. Nakanishi S. Ferguson S.S.G. J. Biol.

In addition to Rad51 protein, five paralogs have been identified: Rad51B/Rad51L1, Rad51C/Rad51L2, Rad51D/Rad51L3, XRCC2, and XRCC3. To further characterize a subset of these proteins, recombinant Rad51, Rad51B-(His)6, and Rad51C proteins were individually expressed employing the baculovirus system, and each was purified from Sf9 insect cells. Evidence from nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid pull-down experiments demonstrates a highly stable Rad51B·Rad51C heterodimer, which interacts weakly with Rad51. Rad51B and Rad51C proteins were found to bind single- and double-stranded DNA and to preferentially bind 3′-end-tailed double-stranded DNA. The ability to bind DNA was elevated with mixed Rad51 and Rad51C, as well as with mixed Rad51B and Rad51C, compared with that of the individual protein. In addition, both Rad51B and Rad51C exhibit DNA-stimulated ATPase activity. Rad51C displays an ATP-independent apparent DNA strand exchange activity, whereas Rad51B shows no such activity; this apparent strand exchange ability results actually from a duplex DNA destabilization capability of Rad51C. By analogy to the yeast Rad55 and Rad57, our results suggest that Rad51B and Rad51C function through interactions with the human Rad51 recombinase and play a crucial role in the homologous recombinational repair pathway.

In vitro studies have shown that Rad51 binds single-stranded and double-stranded DNA (ssDNA and dsDNA), exhibits DNA-dependent ATPase activity, and functions to catalyze homologous pairing and DNA strand exchange (6Benson F.E.

As a prerequisite step for the action of Rad51 in HRR, Rad51 binds DNA to form highly ordered nucleoprotein filaments (9Sung P. Robberson D.L.

It has also been shown that these filaments form preferentially on tailed duplex DNA substrates that mimic the 3′-overhanging ssDNA tails at the sites of DSBs (11Mazin A.V. Zaitseva E. Sung P. Kowalczykowski S.C. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1148-1156Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Thus far, Rad51 is the only mitotic protein that catalyzes the key reactions of homologous pairing and strand transfer.In yeast, the Rad51-related proteins include Rad55 and Rad57, which exist together as a tight heterodimer that interacts weakly with Rad51 (12Sung P. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1111-1121Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). These two proteins appear to be Rad51 paralogs, probably derived by gene duplication followed by the evolution of new functions. The Rad55·Rad57 complex acts as a cofactor for the assembly of Rad51 onto ssDNA and functions to promote the DNA strand transfer activity of Rad51 (12Sung P. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1111-1121Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar).

The Rad51D protein was reported to display ssDNA binding and DNA-stimulated ATPase activity, and to interact with XRCC2 in vivo (28Braybrooke J.P. Spink K.G. Thacker J. Hickson I.D. J. Biol.

We also compared these activities to those of Rad51. The activities of mixed proteins (Rad51 plus Rad51C, Rad51 plus Rad51B, and Rad51B plus Rad51C) were determined as well. Our results demonstrate the formation of multiprotein complexes composed of Rad51B·Rad51C and Rad51·Rad51C·Rad51B, and show that Rad51C both separates duplex DNA and facilitates the binding of Rad51 to DNA.DISCUSSIONTo establish a purification strategy for the Rad51 paralogs, we discovered that spermidine selectively precipitates overexpressed Rad51C from cell extracts, resulting in ∼70% purity of the protein. This step greatly facilitated the purification of Rad51C protein. Based on our unpublished observations, Rad51B also favorably precipitates with spermidine. Thus, in addition to purification of RecA and Rad51 as described previously (32Baumann P. Benson F.E. Hajibagheri N. West S.C. Mutat. Res. 1997; 384: 65-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 33Griffith J. Shores C.G. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 158-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 35Kowalczykowski S.C. Burk D.L.

Chem. 1992; 267: 20648-20658Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar),3 spermidine precipitation is demonstrated here as a powerful strategy for purification of Rad51-related proteins. Our results suggest that this strategy might work for purifying other untagged Rad51 paralogs. However, because spermidine also precipitates DNA, it is important to include a Q-Sepharose column to eliminate DNA in the purification process.In previous studies using a yeast two-hybrid assay and baculovirus co-expression with Ni-NTA pull-down analysis (24Schild D. Lio Y.-C. Collins D.W. Tsomondo T. Chen D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16443-16449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), we reported that Rad51B directly interacts with Rad51C, and that Rad51C weakly interacts with Rad51. Here we demonstrate a simultaneous interaction among these three proteins. This is the first in vitro evidence for Rad51·Rad51C·Rad51B complex formation. However, in the course of our study, it was reported that overexpressed His6-tagged Rad51C did not pull down Rad51 in human cells (43Wiese C. Collins D.W. Albala J.S. Thompson L.H. Kronenberg A. Schild D. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 1001-1008Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 44Miller K.A. Yoshikawa D.M. McConnell I.R. Clark R. Schild D. Albala J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8406-8411Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Because we observed that the interaction between Rad51C and Rad51 is weak, only ∼5–10% of the overexpressed Rad51 was pulled down by the Rad51B·Rad51C complex in insect cell extracts as well as by purified complex of Rad51B and Rad51C proteins, the failure to detect the Rad51C-Rad51 interaction in human cells (43Wiese C. Collins D.W. Albala J.S. Thompson L.H. Kronenberg A. Schild D. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 1001-1008Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 44Miller K.A. Yoshikawa D.M. McConnell I.R. Clark R. Schild D. Albala J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8406-8411Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) is likely due to the weak interaction between the Rad51B·Rad51C complex and Rad51.To elucidate the mechanism of homologous recombination involving Rad51 and Rad51 paralogs and to understand the functions of each protein, the biochemical activities of these proteins were determined. Using established in vitro assays for Rad51, including DNA binding and ATPase and DNA strand exchange assays, the biochemical properties of Rad51B and Rad51C were determined and compared with those of Rad51.To catalyze DNA strand transfer, Rad51 must first bind to ssDNA to form a nucleoprotein filament (9Sung P. Robberson D.L. Cell. 1995; 82: 453-461Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar, 10Bianco P.R. Tracy R.B. Kowalczykowski S.C. Front. Biosci. 1998; 3: D570-D603Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because the Rad51 paralogs play a role in HRR, a key question is whether the paralogs are involved in the DNA binding step. We found that four of the five Rad51 paralogs, including Rad51B, Rad51C, Rad51D, and XRCC3, contain a non-sequence-specific DNA binding domain, a helix-hairpin-helix motif (39Doherty A.J. Serpell L.C. Ponting C.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 2488-2497Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar, 40Shao X. Grishin N.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 2643-2650Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The DNA binding ability of each paralog was assessed using an electrophoretic mobility-shift assay. In addition to the previously reported DNA binding activity of Rad51D (28Braybrooke J.P. Spink K.G. Thacker J. Hickson I.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29100-29106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), we demonstrated that both Rad51B and Rad51C proteins exhibit DNA binding capacity. This finding suggests a role for the Rad51 paralogs in the DNA binding step. Because the break sites of DNA are nucleolytically processed after DSB formation to produce ssDNA with a 3′-overhanging end for binding by RPA, Rad51, and other associated proteins, we examined the substrate binding preferences of Rad51B and Rad51C. Our data, showing that both Rad51B and Rad51C proteins bind the 3′-end-tailed dsDNA substrates in preference to either ssDNA or dsDNA, support the notion that the Rad51 paralogs bind the damaged sites and play a role in the repair processes. The observation that the DNA binding activity of Rad51C is higher than that of Rad51 is somewhat interesting. It may suggest that Rad51C plays a crucial role in the DNA binding processes of the HRR-related proteins. Another significant finding is that the complex formed by Rad51 and Rad51C, as well as by Rad51B and Rad51C, displays a higher DNA binding activity than that of the individual proteins. This result suggests that the direct protein-protein interaction serves possibly to recruit Rad51, and perhaps other proteins as well, to the processed ssDNA.Alignments of the amino acid sequences of Rad51 and five Rad51 paralogs revealed that all proteins contain the Walker A and B motifs (3Thompson L.H. Schild D. Biochimie (Paris). 1999; 81: 87-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), suggesting ATP binding and hydrolysis capability. The ATPase activity of each paralog was confirmed in vitro. We showed that purified Rad51B and Rad51C proteins display ATPase activity that is stimulated by DNA. Little activity was observed in the absence of DNA, implying that DNA is the key cofactor in activating ATP binding/hydrolysis by Rad51B and Rad51C. The role of ATP binding and hydrolysis by the Rad51 paralogs in HRR is still unclear. It was reported that the ATPase mutant of XRCC2 does not affect the formation of Rad51 foci (45O'Regan P. Wilson C. Townsend S. Thacker J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22148-22153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), indicating that XRCC2 does not use ATP binding or hydrolysis to promote its function. Whether the ATPase mutants of Rad51B and Rad51C are altered in their DNA binding activity remains to be determined.Thus far, Rad51 is the only protein found to catalyze the key reactions of homologous pairing and DNA strand transfer that are needed by HRR to repair DNA double-strand breaks in human mitotic cells. Current evidence supports a mediating role for Rad51 paralogs in HRR, where these proteins may function as accessory cofactors assisting the action of Rad51 (4Thompson L.H. Schild D. Mutat. Res. 2001; 477: 131-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). During the course of our research, the Rad51B·Rad51C complex was purified in the Sung laboratory (46Sigurdsson S. Komen S.V. Bussen W. Schild D. Albala J.S. Sung P. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 3308-3318Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). They reported that the Rad51B·Rad51C complex acts to facilitate the replacement of RPA from the nucleofilaments by Rad51 and to promote the DNA strand exchange activity of Rad51 (46Sigurdsson S. Komen S.V. Bussen W. Schild D. Albala J.S. Sung P. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 3308-3318Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), and they suggest a mediator role for the Rad51B·Rad51C complex in HRR. We found, using oligonucleotide DNA substrates, that Rad51C, but not Rad51B, promotes a DNA strand exchange reaction. After further investigation, we discovered that the observed DNA strand exchange products were generated by a DNA melting and strand separation activity of Rad51C. This result implies a distinct role for Rad51C in HRR and suggests that Rad51C may have a more direct function in addition to its mediator role. It is very possible that Rad51C recruits Rad51 to ssDNA and mediates the separation of duplex DNA to promote DNA strand exchange. This proposed function is based on several aspects of our work: (i) Rad51 and Rad51C (with and without Rad51B) physically interact; (ii) Rad51 and Rad51C show synergy in their DNA binding affinity; and (iii) Rad51C promotes dsDNA separation for 32-, 48-, and 63-bp substrates equally well, but Rad51 acts preferentially on the shorter substrates, suggesting that Rad51C might assist in the melting of longer duplex regions. Together, these results demonstrate that Rad51C behaves very differently from Rad51, indicating the Rad51C may serve a different role from Rad51 in the DNA strand exchange stage of homologous recombination. It is most likely that Rad51C “helps” with the strand exchange by Rad51 in several ways: Rad51C may not only directly bind DNA at DSB sites but also facilitate the DNA binding of Rad51 by complex formation and, subsequently, catalyze the separation of duplex DNA for strand exchange. It was recently reported that Rad54 promotes transient separation of the strands in duplex DNA via its ATP hydrolysis-driven DNA supercoiling function and the ability is stimulated by Rad51 (47Sigurdsson S. Komen S.V. Petukhova G. Sung P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42790-42794Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). It will be interesting to see whether Rad51C functions with Rad54 in mediating the separation of duplex DNA for strand exchange.Among the protein-protein interactions between the five Rad51 paralogs, Rad51C has been shown to be a central player that interacts directly with Rad51B, Rad51D, XRCC3, and weakly with Rad51 (24Schild D.

The evidence of multiple protein interactions supports the notion that Rad51C may play multiple roles in the recombinational repair processes. In addition, two hamster cell lines that are mutated in Rad51C, irs3, and CL-V4B, were recently identified, and these cells show a reduction in sister chromatid exchange and genomic stability (34Godthelp B.C.

Here we described several biochemical properties that help define the functions of Rad51C in this process, including complex formation, DNA binding, ATP hydrolysis, and DNA melting/separating activities. These findings underpin the significant biological function of Rad51C protein in the DNA strand exchange events of homologous recombination. Homologous recombinational repair (HRR)1 is an important pathway in repairing DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) with high accuracy, which is indispensable for the maintenance of genome stability (for review see Refs. 1Baumann P.

EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5764-5771Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar), plays a central role in HRR. In vitro studies have shown that Rad51 binds single-stranded and double-stranded DNA (ssDNA and dsDNA), exhibits DNA-dependent ATPase activity, and functions to catalyze homologous pairing and DNA strand exchange (6Benson F.E. Stasiak A. West S.C. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5764-5771Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar, 7Baumann P. Benson F.E. West S.C.

As a prerequisite step for the action of Rad51 in HRR, Rad51 binds DNA to form highly ordered nucleoprotein filaments (9Sung P. Robberson D.L. Cell. 1995; 82: 453-461Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar, 10Bianco P.R. Tracy R.B. Kowalczykowski S.C. Front. Biosci. 1998; 3: D570-D603Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It has also been shown that these filaments form preferentially on tailed duplex DNA substrates that mimic the 3′-overhanging ssDNA tails at the sites of DSBs (11Mazin A.V. Zaitseva E. Sung P. Kowalczykowski S.C. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1148-1156Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Thus far, Rad51 is the only mitotic protein that catalyzes the key reactions of homologous pairing and strand transfer. In yeast, the Rad51-related proteins include Rad55 and Rad57, which exist together as a tight heterodimer that interacts weakly with Rad51 (12Sung P. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1111-1121Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). These two proteins appear to be Rad51 paralogs, probably derived by gene duplication followed by the evolution of new functions. The Rad55·Rad57 complex acts as a cofactor for the assembly of Rad51 onto ssDNA and functions to promote the DNA strand transfer activity of Rad51 (12Sung P. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1111-1121Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). In human cells, in addition to meiotic Dmc1 protein, five Rad51 paralogs have been identified: Rad51B/Rad51L1 2Rad51L is the recommended symbol for the Rad51-like genes/proteins (Human Gene Nomenclature Committee). 2Rad51L is the recommended symbol for the Rad51-like genes/proteins (Human Gene Nomenclature Committee).

The malaria parasite is a unicellular eukaryote (genusPlasmodium) that during the course of its life cycle invades the erythrocytes of its vertebrate host. As it grows within its host erythrocyte, the parasite ingests the host cell cytosol via an endocytotic feeding mechanism. The host cell proteins (predominantly hemoglobin) are deposited in an internal acidic compartment, the digestive vacuole, where they are broken down by acid hydrolases to their component amino acids (1Goldberg D.E. Slater A.F.G. Cerami A. Henderson G.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2931-2935Google Scholar), some of which are used for protein synthesis (2Krugliak M. Zhang J. Ginsburg H. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2002; 119: 249-256Google Scholar). As well as being the major site for hemoglobin digestion, the digestive vacuole serves as a site for the storage of hemozoin (inert crystals of the potentially toxic heme that is liberated in the course of hemoglobin degradation). It is believed to be the primary site of action of many of the antimalarial drugs, and the two proteins known to play a role in antimalarial drug resistance in the most virulent of the human malaria parasites, Plasmodium falciparum, Pgh1 (3Reed M.B. Saliba K.J. Caruana S.R. Kirk K. Cowman A.F. Nature. 2000; 403: 906-909Google Scholar) and PfCRT (4Fidock D.A. Nomura T. Talley A.K. Cooper R.A. Dzekunov S.M. Ferdig M.T. Ursos L.M. Sidhu A.B.

The acidic pH of the digestive vacuole is thought to play a key role in the various physiological functions of this organelle and may also play a role in the phenomenon of antimalarial drug resistance (5Homewood C.A.

Despite the likely significance of vacuolar pH, the mechanism(s) underlying the acidification of the vacuole interior are not well understood. There is immunological evidence for the presence on the digestive vacuole membrane of a V-type H+-ATPase 1The abbreviations used are: H+-ATPase, proton-translocating ATPase; H+-PPase, proton translocating PPase; pHDV, digestive vacuole pH; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid (7Karcz S.R.

Schlesinger P.H. Gluzman I.Y. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 101: 2302-2309Google Scholar) did show a Mg2+ATP-stimulated acidification of the digestive vacuole, but this was not characterized in any detail. In a later study (11Choi I. Mego J.L. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1988; 31: 71-78Google Scholar), it was shown that the ATPase activity of isolated digestive vacuoles can be inhibited by the nonspecific H+ pump inhibitorsN-ethylmaleimide and 7-chloro-4-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazole, but the nature of the pump(s) involved was not investigated. The aim of this study was to identify and characterize the mechanism(s) involved in the acidification of the digestive vacuole of P. falciparum. Using a combination of techniques, we have obtained direct physiological evidence for the presence on the digestive vacuole membrane of a V-type H+-ATPase, as well as a second H+ pump, a H+-pyrophosphatase, which couples the hydrolysis of the phosphoanhydride bond of pyrophosphate (PPi) to the influx of H+ into the vacuole. P. falciparum parasites (strain D10) were maintained in synchronous in vitro cultures as described previously (12Trager W. Jensen J.B. Science. 1976; 193: 673-675Google Scholar) with modifications (13Cranmer S.L. Magowan C. Liang J. Coppel R.L. Cooke B.M. Trans. R. Soc. Trop. Med. Hyg. 1997; 91: 363-365Google Scholar). All experiments were carried out on late stage trophozoites, 36–40 h postinvasion. A membrane-impermeant, dextran-linked form of the fluorescent pH indicator fluorescein (pK a ∼6.4) was loaded into the parasite's digestive vacuole as described previously (10Krogstad D.J. Schlesinger P.H. Gluzman I.Y. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 101: 2302-2309Google Scholar, 14Bray P.G. Saliba K.J. Davies J.D. Spiller D.G. White M.R. Kirk K. Ward S.A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2002; 119 (307–309, 311–313): 301-304Google Scholar), with only minor modifications. Packed erythrocytes (1 ml) were lysed by the addition of 2.25 ml of lysis buffer (5 mm HEPES, 11 mm glucose, 2 mmMgCl2, and 2 mm ATP, pH 7.4) containing 110 μm fluorescein-dextran (M r 10,000; Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR). The lysate was incubated for 10 min at 30 °C, and then the cells were resealed by the addition of 2.25 ml of a resealing buffer (280 mm NaCl, 40 mm KCl, 11 mm glucose, 1 mm HEPES, pH 7.4). The dye-loaded erythrocytes were washed three times in RPMI (1,200 × g, 5 min) and then resuspended in culture medium and inoculated with ∼1 ml of a trophozoite-stage P. falciparum-infected erythrocyte suspension (3–4% hematocrit, 10–20% parasitemia). The parasites were maintained in 50 ml of medium on an orbital shaker until the parasitemia was higher than 10–15% (rarely more than two complete cycles), at which point the cells were used for experiments. Fig. 1 illustrates the different parasite/vacuole preparations used throughout this study. Parasitized erythrocytes (Fig. 1 A) were permeabilized (as described previously (15Saliba K.J. Horner H.A. Kirk K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10190-101905Google Scholar)) by brief exposure to saponin (0.005%, w/v sapogenin), a plant-derived detergent that permeabilizes both the host cell membrane and the parasitophorous vacuole membrane (16Ansorge I. Paprotka K. Bhakdi S. Lingelbach K. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1997; 84: 259-261Google Scholar), thereby allowing solutes present in the extracellular solution unimpeded access to the parasite plasma membrane (Fig. 1 B). Parasites within saponin-permeabilized erythrocytes are referred to throughout this paper as “isolated parasites.” For all experiments other than those giving rise to Figs. 2, 8, and 10 C, the plasma membrane of the parasite (within the saponin-permeabilized erythrocyte membrane) was itself permeabilized using digitonin (10Krogstad D.J. Schlesinger P.H. Gluzman I.Y. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 101: 2302-2309Google Scholar), thereby permitting solutes added to the extracellular medium immediate access to the digestive vacuole membrane (Fig. 1 C). Isolated parasites were suspended in 2 ml of ice-cold intracellular saline A (110 mm KCl, 30 mm NaCl, 2 mmMgCl2, 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.3). The cell suspension (typically 5 × 107 cells/ml) was kept on ice for 5–10 min before adding digitonin (0.01%, w/v) from a 200 mg/ml stock (in Me2SO). The cells were mixed gently and returned to ice for a further 2 min, after which 1 ml of ice-cold intracellular saline A containing 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin was added. The permeabilized parasites were centrifuged immediately (15,800 ×g) for 1 min and then washed twice (1 min at 15,800 ×g) with 1 ml of the same bovine serum albumin-containing solution and once in intracellular saline A without bovine serum albumin. The digitonin-permeabilized parasites were suspended in intracellular saline A at an average cell density of ∼8 × 106/ml and kept at 37 °C until being used in experiments (usually within 2 h, but up to 5 h in the experiment giving rise to Fig. 4). Within digitonin-permeabilized parasites, the digestive vacuole remained intact, as indicated by the retention of the dextran-linked fluorescent dye within the digestive vacuole of parasites isolated from dye-loaded erythrocytes (see above).Figure 8ATP- and PPi-induced acidification of digestive vacuoles isolated from P. falciparum trophozoites. The traces show the effect of the addition of ATP (1 mm; gray arrowhead), followed by the addition of the H+-ATPase inhibitor concanamycin A (75 nm;black arrowhead) (A) and the addition of PPi (1 mm, white arrowhead) (B) on the fluorescence from a suspension of isolated digestive vacuoles containing 25 nmquinacrine. A downward deflection of the trace is indicative of vacuolar acidification.

Initial rates of acidification were estimated by fitting traces such as those illustrated in Fig. 3 to the first order equation Δ fluorescence ratio = Δ fluorescence ratiomax × (1 −e −kt), where: Δ fluorescence ratio is the difference between the resting fluorescence ratio prior to the addition of ATP or PPi (averaged over the 20 s immediately prior to the addition) and the fluorescence ratio at a given time (t) following the addition of ATP or PPi; Δ fluorescence ratiomax is the maximum decrease in fluorescence ratio attained following the addition of ATP or PPi; and k is the first order rate constant for the acidification. The time dependence of the ATP-induced acidification rate was fitted to a first-order exponential decay function. The PPi data were fitted to a straight line. The data are from a single experiment and are representative of those obtained in five separate experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Digestive vacuoles (Fig.1 D) were isolated as described previously (17Saliba K.J. Folb P.I. Smith P.J. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1998; 56: 313-320Google Scholar), with some modifications. Approximately 2 × 109 isolated parasites (see above) were lysed by suspension in ∼1 ml of an acidic, ice-cold, hypotonic lysis buffer (20 mm MES, pH 4.5). The lysate was transferred to a watchglass on ice, triturated forcefully twice through a 27-gauge needle, and then centrifuged (15,800 ×g, 0.5 min). The supernatant solution was removed, and the pellet was resuspended in ∼1 ml of intracellular saline B (120 mm KCl, 10 mm NaCl, 25 mm HEPES, 2 mm MgCl2, 5 mmNa2HPO4, pH 7.3), and triturated (as described above) six more times. The suspension was centrifuged (15,800 ×g, 0.5 min), and the supernatant solution was removed. The pellet was again resuspended in ∼1 ml of intracellular saline B, to which was added DNase I (300–400 units/ml), and the suspension was incubated at 37 °C for 5 min. The sample was centrifuged once more (15,800 × g, 0.5 min) and then resuspended in 100 μl of intracellular saline B and mixed with 1.3 ml of a Percoll solution (80% v/v Percoll, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 200 mm sucrose, pH 7.3). The suspension was again triturated (2 ×) onto the watchglass, returned to microcentrifuge tubes, and centrifuged at 5,200 × g for 8 min at 4 °C. Isolated vacuoles were retrieved from the bottom ∼50 μl of the Percoll solution, avoiding the hemozoin crystal pellet at the very bottom of the tube, and resuspended in ice-cold intracellular saline B until being used in experiments within 20 min of their isolation. Microscopic examination of the preparation revealed a homogeneous population of approximately spherical, hemozoin-filled organelles that appeared to be free of contaminants. Throughout this study, the pH within the parasite's digestive vacuole (pHDV) was monitored using the fluorescence arising from either the membrane-impermeant pH indicator fluorescein-dextran, loaded into the digestive vacuole as described above, or (in one series of experiments with isolated digestive vacuoles) from the membrane-permeant compound quinacrine. In preliminary experiments with a range of dextran-linked pH indicators, we attempted to calibrate the measured fluorescence with pHDV but found that the estimated pHDV varied with the fluorescent indicator used. The origin of this variation is presently under investigation. For the purpose of the present study, the fluorescence was simply used as a semiquantitative indicator of pHDV, and there was no attempt made to calibrate the fluorescence measurements. For both fluorescein-dextran and quinacrine, an upward deflection of the trace is indicative of an alkalinization, and a downward deflection of the trace is indicative of an acidification. In experiments with intact isolated parasites (Fig. 1 B) in which the digestive vacuole was preloaded with fluorescein-dextran, the cells were suspended at a density of ∼5 × 106 cells/ml in a solution comprised of 125 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 20 mm glucose, 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.1. With the exceptions of the experiments giving rise to Figs. 5 B and 6 B, digitonin-permeabilized parasites (Fig. 1 C) were suspended (at ∼5 × 106 cells/ml) in intracellular saline A. For the experiment giving rise to Fig. 5 B, permeabilized parasites were suspended in intracellular saline A without MgCl2. For the experiment giving rise to Fig.6 B, they were suspended in a K+-free solution containing 140 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.3.Figure 6K+ dependence of the PPi-induced acidification of the digestive vacuole in digitonin-permeabilized parasites. The traces show the effect of 0.2 mm PPi, added as either the K+salt (A) or the Na+ salt (B), at the point indicated by the white arrowhead, to digitonin-permeabilized parasites suspended in a solution containing either 110 mm K+ plus 30 mmNa+ (A) or 0 mm K+ plus 140 mm Na+ (B). Traces are from a single experiment, representative of those obtained in three separate experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Changes in pHDV were monitored at 37 °C on a Perkin-Elmer Life Sciences LS-50B spectrofluorometer using a dual excitation Fast Filter accessory. The sample was excited at 490 and 450 nm successively, and the fluorescence was measured at 520 nm. The ratio of the fluorescence intensity measured using the two excitation wavelengths (490 nm/450 nm) provides a measure of pHDV. Digitonin-permeabilized parasites (Fig. 1 C) preloaded with fluorescein-dextran were immobilized on poly-l-lysine-coated coverslips and then mounted in a Bioptechs FCS2 perfusion chamber and immersed in intracellular saline A at 37 °C. The cells were imaged using a Zeiss LSM510 confocal microscope through a Plan-Apochromat 63 × 1.4 NA oil objective. The fluorescein-dextran was excited using the 488-nm wavelength line of an argon ion laser through a 488-nm HFT filter. Emitted fluorescence was captured off a 545-nm dichroic mirror through a 505–550-nm bandpass filter. pHDV in isolated P. falciparumdigestive vacuole suspensions was monitored using a method based on one used previously by Hirata et al. (18Hirata T. Nakamura N. Omote H. Wada Y. Futai M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 386-389Google Scholar) to measure the pH in vacuoles isolated from yeast. Vacuoles were isolated from unloaded parasites and suspended (at 4–8 × 107 vacuoles/ml) in intracellular saline B to which had been added 25 nmquinacrine. Fluorescence intensity was measured using excitation and emission wavelengths of 425 and 495 nm, respectively. The experiments with this preparation were carried out at 20 °C, as in Ref. 18Hirata T. Nakamura N. Omote H. Wada Y. Futai M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 386-389Google Scholar. Hydrolysis of PPi by suspensions of digitonin-permeabilized parasites (Fig. 1 C) and isolated P. falciparum digestive vacuoles (Fig. 1 D) was monitored using 31P NMR spectroscopy. In experiments with digitonin-permeabilized parasites, the cells were suspended at a cell density of ∼6 × 107 cells/ml in intracellular saline A containing 4 mm PPi and incubated in the presence or absence of 10 mm NaF at 37 °C. At predetermined time intervals, 250-μl aliquots were removed and centrifuged (0.5 min at 15,800 × g). A 200-μl aliquot of the supernatant solution was transferred to 100 μl of ice-cold 30% perchloric acid in order to halt any enzyme activity. The pH was subsequently adjusted to 7.4 using NaOH. In experiments with isolated vacuoles, the organelles were suspended in intracellular saline A at a density of ∼1 × 107vacuoles/ml and incubated in the presence of 0.5 mmPPi for 2 h at 37 °C. Samples were then processed as described above. The volume of each neutralized extract sample was made up to 400 μl, and the solution was then transferred to a 5-mm (outside diameter) NMR tube. Methylene diphosphonic acid was added to a final concentration of either 5 mm (in the permeabilized parasite experiments) or 0.5 mm (in the isolated vacuole experiments) as an internal31P NMR reference standard. EDTA was added to a concentration of 24 mm to preclude signal broadening by trace concentrations of multivalent metal ions, and2H2O (10% v/v) was added to provide a field frequency lock. 31P NMR spectra were acquired at 25 °C and at 121.4 MHz, using a Varian VXR-300 spectrometer with a 45° pulse and a 1-s relaxation delay between successive pulses. The concentrations of free PPi (the sum of PP i4−, HPP i3−, H2PP i2−, H3PP i−, and H4PPi) and PPi complexed with Mg2+ (the sum of MgPP i2−, Mg2PPi, and MgHPP i−) in the experiments giving rise to Figs. 5 A and 10 B were calculated using the program GEOCHEM-PC (version 2.0) (19Parker D.R. Norvell W.A. Chaney R.L. Loeppert R.H. Schwab A.P. Goldberg S. Chemical Equilibrium and Reaction Models. 42.

The calculations simulated the presence of different concentrations of PPi and (in the case of Fig. 10 B) Pi in the presence of 2 mm Mg2+, 110 mm K+, and 30 mm Na+, at pH 7.3. When isolated parasites in which the digestive vacuole was preloaded with fluorescein-dextran were suspended in a glucose-containing medium, they gave rise to a steady fluorescent signal. The addition of the V-type H+-ATPase inhibitors concanamycin A (Fig.2 A) or bafilomycin A1 (not shown) resulted in a progressive increase in the (490 nm/450 nm) fluorescence ratio, indicative of the dye-loaded digestive vacuole undergoing an alkalinization. This is consistent with a V-type H+-ATPase playing a role in maintaining the acidic pH of this organelle. The intraerythrocytic parasite derives its ATP from glycolysis (20Sherman I.W. Sherman I.W. Malaria: Parasite Biology, Pathogenesis, and Protection. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1998: 135-143Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2 B, removal of glucose from the extracellular medium (a maneuver shown previously to result in a rapid depletion of parasite ATP (21Saliba K.J. Kirk K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33213-33219Google Scholar)) resulted in an alkalinization of the vacuole. Upon restoration of glucose (20 mm) to the medium, the vacuoles reacidified. A similar reacidification was seen upon the addition to glucose-depleted parasites of 2 mm ATP (Fig.2 C), which is known to cross the parasite plasma membrane via an ATP/ADP translocase (22Kanaani J. Ginsburg H. Biochem. Int. 1988; 17: 451-459Google Scholar, 23Choi I. Mikkelsen R.B. Exp. Parasitol. 1990; 71: 452-462Google Scholar). Atractyloside (100 μm), an inhibitor of the ATP/ADP translocase, prevented the ATP-induced reacidification while having no effect on the reacidification caused by the subsequent addition of glucose (Fig.2 D). Unlike ATP, PPi (added to the extracellular solution at a concentration of 2 mm) failed to induce an acidification of the vacuole in glucose-depleted parasites, although it did cause a modest decrease in the rate of alkalinization (Fig.2 E). In isolated parasites (as used in the experiments giving rise to Fig. 2), the parasite plasma membrane remains intact, and compounds added to the extracellular medium have to traverse this membrane in order to gain access to the digestive vacuole (Fig.1 B). The parasite plasma membrane can be permeabilized, thereby exposing the surface of the digestive vacuole directly to the extracellular solution (as well as releasing the contents of the cytosol, including those compounds required to energize the acidification of the vacuole), by treating the isolated parasites with digitonin (Fig. 1 C). Fig. 3 illustrates the effects of PPi and ATP on pHDV in digitonin-permeabilized parasites. As shown in Fig. 3 A, the addition of 0.2 mm PPi to digitonin-permeabilized parasites suspended in a high K+ solution resulted in a rapid decrease in the fluorescence ratio, indicative of the vacuole undergoing an acidification. The subsequent addition of the H+-ATPase inhibitor concanamycin A (75 nm) had no significant effect. The data are consistent with the presence in the vacuole membrane of a H+ pumping PPase, distinct from the V-type H+-ATPase. The addition of 1 mm ATP to digitonin-permeabilized parasites also caused a marked acidification of the digestive vacuole (Fig. 3 B). The acidification was reversed upon the addition of concanamycin A, consistent with the ATP-induced acidification being mediated by a V-type H+-ATPase. The subsequent addition of 0.2 mm PPi resulted in the complete reacidification of the vacuole (Fig. 3 B). The rate (and magnitude) of the vacuolar acidification induced by 2 mm ATP decreased with the time after permeabilization of the parasite plasma membrane by digitonin (Fig.4, closed symbols). By ∼1 h after the addition of digitonin, the ATP-induced acidification was reduced to an almost negligible level. By contrast, the rate of acidification measured in response to the addition of 0.2 mm PPi was maintained at an approximately constant level for >4 h following exposure of the parasites to digitonin (Fig. 4, open symbols). The time-dependent decrease of the ATP-induced acidification made an analysis of the ATP concentration dependence of the process difficult, and this was not attempted. It was, however, possible to analyze the concentration dependence of the PPi-induced acidification of the vacuole in digitonin-permeabilized parasites. The process showed biphasic kinetics, illustrated in Fig.5 A. The rate of acidification increased with [PPi] up to a concentration of ∼0.5 mm and then decreased as [PPi] was increased further. When PPi was added at a concentration of 5 mm, the rate of acidification was less than 20% of its maximum value, whereas the addition of 10 mmPPi had a negligible effect on pHDV. A likely explanation for the biphasic kinetics is that the true substrate for the H+-PPase is a Mg·PPicomplex (MgPP i2−, Mg2PPi, and/or MgHPP i−) and that, as has been shown in other systems (24Walker R.R. Leigh R.A. Planta. 1981; 153: 150-155Google Scholar, 25Wang Y. Leigh R.A. Kaestner K.H. Sze H. Plant Physiol. 1986; 81: 497-502Google Scholar), free PPi (i.e.uncomplexed PPi or PPi complexed with H+) acts as a competitive inhibitor of the H+-PPase. The dotted line in Fig.5 A shows the calculated concentrations of the Mg·PPi complex (i.e. the sum of the concentrations of MgPP i2−, Mg2PPi, and MgHPP i−), and the dashed line shows the concentration of free PPi over the PPi concentration range tested. At low concentrations, the Mg·PPi complexes predominated. As the total concentration of PPi increased, however, the inhibitory free PPi ion became the predominant species present, and it is probably this that was responsible for the decrease in the PPi-induced acidification rate observed as the total [PPi] was increased above ∼0.5 mm. Further evidence in support of the view that Mg·PPi is the substrate for the H+-PPase is provided in Fig.5 B, which shows that in the absence of MgCl2 the addition of 0.2 mm PPi had no effect on pHDV, whereas the subsequent addition of 2 mmMgCl2 resulted in the immediate acidification of the digestive vacuole. The addition of MgCl2 in the absence of PPi had no effect on pHDV (not shown). The rate and magnitude of the PPi-induced acidification of the digestive vacuole in digitonin-permeabilized parasites were reduced by replacement of K+ with Na+ in the medium (Fig. 6). The PPi-induced acidification was also susceptible to competitive inhibition by the H+-PPase inhibitor NaF (Fig.7). When the digestive vacuole was acidified by the addition of 2 mm PPi to the digitonin-permeabilized parasite suspension, the subsequent addition of 10 mm NaF resulted in a modest alkalinization (Fig.7 A). Reduction of the PPi concentration increased the sensitivity to inhibition by NaF, indicative of competitive behavior. When the digestive vacuole was acidified by the addition to the permeabilized parasite suspension of 0.2 mmPPi, NaF at a concentration as low as 2.5 mminduced a progressive alkalinization of the vacuole (Fig.7 B). In addition to the measurements carried out on suspensions of intact and digitonin-permeabilized parasites, two alternative approaches were taken to confirm the presence of discrete ATP- and PPi-dependent acidification mechanisms on the parasite's digestive vacuole.

CFTR is unique among ion channels in requiring ATP hydrolysis for its gating, suggesting that its activity is coupled to cellular metabolic status. The metabolic sensor AMP-activated kinase (AMPK) binds to and phosphorylates CFTR, co-localizes with it in various tissues, and inhibits CFTR currents inXenopus oocytes (Hallows, K.

Here we demonstrate that this AMPK-CFTR interaction has functional implications in human lung epithelial cells. Pharmacologic activation of AMPK inhibited forskolin-stimulated CFTR short circuit currents in polarized Calu-3 cell monolayers. In whole-cell patch clamp experiments, the activation of endogenous AMPK either pharmacologically or by the overexpression of an AMPK-activating non-catalytic subunit mutant (AMPK-γ1-R70Q) dramatically inhibited forskolin-stimulated CFTR conductance in Calu-3 and CFTR-expressing Chinese hamster ovary cells. Plasma membrane expression of CFTR, assessed by surface biotinylation, was not affected by AMPK activation. In contrast, the single channel open probability of CFTR was strongly reduced in cell-attached patch clamp measurements of Calu-3 cells transfected with the AMPK-activating mutant, an effect due primarily to a substantial prolongation of the mean closed time of the channel. As a metabolic sensor in cells, AMPK may be important in tuning CFTR activity to cellular energy charge, thereby linking transepithelial transport and the maintenance of cellular ion gradients to cellular metabolism.

Smith A.E. Sci. Am. 1995; 273: 52-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). CFTR plays an important role in absorption and secretion of salt and water, with its channel activity often determining the rate of transepithelial transport in various tissues. The importance of native regulation of CFTR channel activity is underscored by pathological conditions, including cystic fibrosis (CF), where mutations in CFTR cause reduced activity (2Tsui L.-C. Trends Genet. 1992; 8: 392-398Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar), and secretory diarrhea, which results from excessive cellular stimulation of CFTR (3Kunzelmann K. Mall M. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 245-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). CFTR is activated in cells by hormone- and neurotransmitter-induced cAMP signaling. The cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) phosphorylates several residues in the cytoplasmic R domain of CFTR, which activates gating by destabilizing channel closed states (4Winter M.C. Welsh M.J. Nature. 1997; 389: 294-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Activated CFTR channels can be inactivated by phosphatases (5Luo J.X. Pato M.D. Riordan J.R. Hanrahan J.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: C1397-C1410Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PKA-mediated phosphorylation may also enhance Cl− transport through the insertion of additional CFTR channels into the plasma membrane (6Howard M. Jiang X. Stolz D.B. Hill W.G. Johnson J.A. Watkins S.C. Frizzell R.A. Bruton C.M. Robbins P.D. Weisz O.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: C375-C382Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Whereas PKA-associated phosphorylation/dephosphorylation is the most thoroughly understood process regulating CFTR channel activity, other mechanisms may modulate the activity of CFTR under various cellular conditions. In this regard, AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) was discovered to interact with CFTR and inhibit its activity (7Hallows K.R. Raghuram V. Kemp B.E. Witters L.A. Foskett J.K. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 1711-1721Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar).AMPK is a ubiquitous serine/threonine kinase with orthologues in all eukaryotes that exists as a heterotrimer with a catalytic α subunit and regulatory β and γ subunits (8Hardie D.G. Carling D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 246: 259-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (1126) Google Scholar). In response to metabolic stress and increasing intracellular AMP levels (9Hardie D.G. Carling D. Carlson M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 821-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (1265) Google Scholar), AMPK phosphorylates and inhibits several important rate-limiting biosynthetic enzymes, thereby acting to preserve cellular ATP stores during metabolic depletion (8Hardie D.G. Carling D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 246: 259-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (1126) Google Scholar). Recently, mutations in AMPK have been linked to human diseases, including familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome (10Gollob M.H. Seger J.J. Gollob T.N. Tapscott T. Gonzales O. Bachinski L. Roberts R. Circulation. 2001; 104: 3030-3033Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Furthermore, modulation of AMPK may also play an important role in the pathogenesis and treatment of type II diabetes mellitus (11Zhou G. Myers R., Li, Y. Chen Y. Shen X. Fenyk-Melody J., Wu, M. Ventre J. Doebber T. Fujii N. Musi N. Hirshman M.F. Goodyear L.J. Moller D.E. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 1167-1174Crossref PubMed Scopus (4328) Google Scholar) and obesity (12Minokoshi Y. Kim Y.B.

Nature. 2002; 415: 339-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (1650) Google Scholar).CFTR is unique among ion channels in its requirement for ATP binding and hydrolysis to support channel activity. We previously discovered that the COOH-terminal regulatory sequence of the AMPK α subunit directly interacts with the CFTR COOH-terminal tail. Our data indicate that this interaction could be of physiological significance, because AMPK and CFTR co-localize in epithelia, and AMPK phosphorylates CFTRin vitro and inhibits cAMP-activated CFTR conductances inXenopus oocytes (7Hallows K.R. Raghuram V. Kemp B.E. Witters L.A. Foskett J.K. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 1711-1721Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar) and polarized colonic T84 cell monolayers. 2K. R. Hallows and J. K. Foskett, unpublished results.2K. R. Hallows and J. K. Foskett, unpublished results. However, the mechanisms underlying inhibition of CFTR activity by AMPK have not been determined.The most serious CF-associated morbidity results from lung pathology. Defective Cl− transport due to CFTR mutations results in abnormal composition and/or volume of airway surface liquid, which compromises airway clearance resulting in chronic infection and the destruction of lung tissue (13Smith J.J. Travis S.M. Greenberg E.P. Welsh M.J. Cell. 1996; 85: 229-236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (887) Google Scholar, 14Caldwell R.A. Grubb B.R. Tarran R. Boucher R.C. Knowles M.R. Barker P.M. J. Gen. Physiol. 2002; 119: 3-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Because detailed insights into the mechanisms of CFTR regulation in the lung could provide new insights into the pathogenesis of CF lung disease and suggest possible novel therapies, here we have investigated AMPK inhibition of CFTR activity in Calu-3 human lung serous cells. Using pharmacological, biochemical, and electrophysiological approaches, we demonstrate that AMPK is an endogenous inhibitor of CFTR activity in lung submucosal gland serous cells. Furthermore, we have determined that this inhibition is mediated by effects on CFTR single channel gating.DISCUSSIONIn the present study we have demonstrated that endogenous AMPK can modulate the activity of CFTR in lung serous epithelial cells (Figs. 1 and 2). This AMPK-dependent modulation of CFTR activity could not be accounted for by changes in the amount of CFTR expressed at the plasma membrane (Fig. 3). Rather, CFTR inhibition following constitutive AMPK activation was mediated through effects on CFTR single channel gating; i.e. AMPK activation significantly inhibited the Po of CFTR by stabilizing the closed conformation of the channel (Fig. 4). Until now, the most well established kinase regulation of CFTR activity was that associated with PKA and, to a lesser extent, protein kinase C, both of which act to stimulate gating (30Gadsby D.C. Nairn A.C. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: S77-S107Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). Whereas specific phosphorylation of CFTR is believed to underlie these effects, the molecular mechanisms involved in AMPK regulation of CFTR remain to be elucidated. Two general possibilities remain to be investigated. First, AMPK may exert its effects directly on CFTR. The catalytic subunit of AMPK directly binds to a region near the COOH terminus of CFTR, and CFTR can serve as a substrate for AMPK-dependent phosphorylation in vitro (7Hallows K.R. Raghuram V. Kemp B.E. Witters L.A. Foskett J.K. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 1711-1721Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). In Xenopus oocytes, inhibition of CFTR-mediated Cl− currents by AMPK appeared to require both binding as well as kinase activity (7Hallows K.R. Raghuram V. Kemp B.E. Witters L.A. Foskett J.K. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 1711-1721Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Second, AMPK may exert its effects through other molecules. CFTR likely exists within a complex of closely associated proteins, including those involved in its PKA-mediated phosphorylation (20Huang P. Trotter K. Boucher R.C. Milgram S.L. Stutts M.J. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: C417-C422Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PKA activates CFTR gating by destabilizing the channel closed conformation (4Winter M.C. Welsh M.J. Nature. 1997; 389: 294-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), whereas AMPK appears to inhibit CFTR gating by stabilizing the channel closed state, the opposite effect. Thus, it is possible that AMPK antagonizes the effects of PKA on CFTR channel gating by exerting its effects on proteins involved in the phosphorylation or dephosphorylation of CFTR. Alternatively, because the interaction of other proteins with CFTR may influence CFTR gating (15Raghuram V. Mak D.-O.D. Foskett J.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1300-1305Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 31Wang S.S. Yue H.W. Derin R.B. Guggino W.B. Lit M.

Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 783-791Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), those interactions could be sites of modulation by AMPK. It is interesting to note that the interaction of CFTR with the PDZ domain-containing protein NHERF, which has profound effects on CFTR gating (15Raghuram V. Mak D.-O.D. Foskett J.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1300-1305Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar), is mediated through sites located immediately downstream from the region of CFTR involved in binding to AMPK (7Hallows K.R. Raghuram V. Kemp B.E. Witters L.A. Foskett J.K. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 1711-1721Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar).AMPK activity is exquisitely sensitive to changes in the cell metabolic state, as relatively small changes in intracellular ATP levels produce large changes in the intracellular AMP:ATP ratio due to the rapid interconversion of ATP, ADP, and AMP by adenylate kinase (33Hardie D.G. Hawley S.A. Bioessays. 2001; 23: 1112-1119Crossref PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar). Because AMPK responds to the cellular AMP:ATP ratio, it can serve as a primary sensor of even minor changes in metabolic state. Therefore, AMPK may become engaged not only following severe reductions in intracellular ATP (e.g. that occur with ischemic or hypoxic injury) but also during more subtle, “physiological” fluctuations of intracellular ATP that may occur on a regular basis. Thus, the interaction of CFTR with AMPK may provide a sensitive mechanism to couple its activity to cell metabolic state, fine-tuning CFTR transport activity on a short time scale in response to metabolic conditions.CFTR appears to modulate the activities of various membrane transport proteins and may thereby help to coordinate an ensemble of proteins involved in transepithelial salt and water transport (34Schwiebert E.M. Benos D.J. Egan M.E. Stutts M.J. Guggino W.B. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: S145-S166Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). Thus, the AMPK-dependent regulation of CFTR may afford a mechanism to couple epithelial transport in general to cellular metabolic status. In addition, AMPK might directly modulate the activity of other important membrane transport proteins independently of CFTR. Indeed, AICAR-induced activation of AMPK appears to induce increased transcription and insertion of glucose transporters into the plasma membranes of muscle (29Kurth-Kraczek E.J. Hirshman M.F. Goodyear L.J. Winder W.W. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 1667-1671Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar, 35Abbud W. Habinowski S. Zhang J.Z. Kendrew J. Elkairi F.S. Kemp B.E. Witters L.A. Ismail-Beigi F.

Physiol. 2001; 90: 1073-1083Crossref Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Of note, the recent discovery that certain mutations in the γ subunit of AMPK cause the Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome (10Gollob M.H. Seger J.J. Gollob T.N. Tapscott T. Gonzales O. Bachinski L. Roberts R. Circulation. 2001; 104: 3030-3033Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 37Blair E. Redwood C. Ashrafian H. Oliviera M. Broxholme J. Kerr B. Salmon A. Ostman-Smith I. Watkins H. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2001; 10: 1215-1220Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), a disease that predisposes to fatal cardiac arrhythmias, may imply a possible functional link between AMPK and cardiac ion channels. Thus, further investigations into the effects of AMPK on various membrane transport proteins may provide important new insights into the pathophysiology of several disorders, including ischemic epithelial injury and cardiac arrhythmias.Finally, the results of this study illustrate the potential utility of agents (e.g. AICAR or metformin (11Zhou G. Myers R., Li, Y. Chen Y. Shen X. Fenyk-Melody J., Wu, M. Ventre J. Doebber T. Fujii N. Musi N. Hirshman M.F. Goodyear L.J. Moller D.E. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 1167-1174Crossref PubMed Scopus (4328) Google Scholar)) that enhance endogenous AMPK activity in the treatment of diseases where inappropriately high CFTR activity plays a role, including certain secretory diarrheas (3Kunzelmann K. Mall M. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 245-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar) and autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (38O'Sullivan D.A. Torres V.E. Gabow P.A. Thibodeau S.N. King B.F. Bergstralh E.J. Am. J. Kidney Dis. 1998; 32: 976-983Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Conversely, if agents that could selectively inhibit AMPK are discovered, they might be of benefit in diseases associated with inappropriately low CFTR activity (i.e. CF). A further understanding of the detailed mechanisms involved in the AMPK-CFTR regulatory interaction may also provide additional insights into the pathogenesis of CF. The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR)1 is a plasma membrane Cl− channel expressed on the apical membranes in a wide variety of epithelial tissues, including the lung, intestine, pancreas, and reproductive tract (1Welsh M.J.

AMPK is a ubiquitous serine/threonine kinase with orthologues in all eukaryotes that exists as a heterotrimer with a catalytic α subunit and regulatory β and γ subunits (8Hardie D.G. Carling D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 246: 259-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (1126) Google Scholar). In response to metabolic stress and increasing intracellular AMP levels (9Hardie D.G. Carling D. Carlson M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 821-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (1265) Google Scholar), AMPK phosphorylates and inhibits several important rate-limiting biosynthetic enzymes, thereby acting to preserve cellular ATP stores during metabolic depletion (8Hardie D.G. Carling D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 246: 259-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (1126) Google Scholar). Recently, mutations in AMPK have been linked to human diseases, including familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome (10Gollob M.H. Seger J.J. Gollob T.N. Tapscott T. Gonzales O. Bachinski L. Roberts R. Circulation. 2001; 104: 3030-3033Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Furthermore, modulation of AMPK may also play an important role in the pathogenesis and treatment of type II diabetes mellitus (11Zhou G. Myers R., Li, Y. Chen Y. Shen X. Fenyk-Melody J., Wu, M. Ventre J. Doebber T. Fujii N. Musi N. Hirshman M.F. Goodyear L.J. Moller D.E. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 1167-1174Crossref PubMed Scopus (4328) Google Scholar) and obesity (12Minokoshi Y. Kim Y.B. Peroni O.D. Fryer L.G. Muller C. Carling D. Kahn B.B. Nature. 2002; 415: 339-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (1650) Google Scholar). CFTR is unique among ion channels in its requirement for ATP binding and hydrolysis to support channel activity. We previously discovered that the COOH-terminal regulatory sequence of the AMPK α subunit directly interacts with the CFTR COOH-terminal tail. Our data indicate that this interaction could be of physiological significance, because AMPK and CFTR co-localize in epithelia, and AMPK phosphorylates CFTRin vitro and inhibits cAMP-activated CFTR conductances inXenopus oocytes (7Hallows K.R. Raghuram V. Kemp B.E. Witters L.A. Foskett J.K. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 1711-1721Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar) and polarized colonic T84 cell monolayers. 2K. R. Hallows and J. K. Foskett, unpublished results.2K. R. Hallows and J. K. Foskett, unpublished results. However, the mechanisms underlying inhibition of CFTR activity by AMPK have not been determined. The most serious CF-associated morbidity results from lung pathology. Defective Cl− transport due to CFTR mutations results in abnormal composition and/or volume of airway surface liquid, which compromises airway clearance resulting in chronic infection and the destruction of lung tissue (13Smith J.J. Travis S.M. Greenberg E.P. Welsh M.J. Cell. 1996; 85: 229-236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (887) Google Scholar, 14Caldwell R.A. Grubb B.R. Tarran R. Boucher R.C. Knowles M.R. Barker P.M. J. Gen. Physiol. 2002; 119: 3-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Because detailed insights into the mechanisms of CFTR regulation in the lung could provide new insights into the pathogenesis of CF lung disease and suggest possible novel therapies, here we have investigated AMPK inhibition of CFTR activity in Calu-3 human lung serous cells. Using pharmacological, biochemical, and electrophysiological approaches, we demonstrate that AMPK is an endogenous inhibitor of CFTR activity in lung submucosal gland serous cells. Furthermore, we have determined that this inhibition is mediated by effects on CFTR single channel gating. DISCUSSIONIn the present study we have demonstrated that endogenous AMPK can modulate the activity of CFTR in lung serous epithelial cells (Figs. 1 and 2). This AMPK-dependent modulation of CFTR activity could not be accounted for by changes in the amount of CFTR expressed at the plasma membrane (Fig. 3). Rather, CFTR inhibition following constitutive AMPK activation was mediated through effects on CFTR single channel gating; i.e. AMPK activation significantly inhibited the Po of CFTR by stabilizing the closed conformation of the channel (Fig. 4). Until now, the most well established kinase regulation of CFTR activity was that associated with PKA and, to a lesser extent, protein kinase C, both of which act to stimulate gating (30Gadsby D.C. Nairn A.C. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: S77-S107Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). Whereas specific phosphorylation of CFTR is believed to underlie these effects, the molecular mechanisms involved in AMPK regulation of CFTR remain to be elucidated. Two general possibilities remain to be investigated. First, AMPK may exert its effects directly on CFTR. The catalytic subunit of AMPK directly binds to a region near the COOH terminus of CFTR, and CFTR can serve as a substrate for AMPK-dependent phosphorylation in vitro (7Hallows K.R. Raghuram V. Kemp B.E. Witters L.A. Foskett J.K. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 1711-1721Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). In Xenopus oocytes, inhibition of CFTR-mediated Cl− currents by AMPK appeared to require both binding as well as kinase activity (7Hallows K.R. Raghuram V. Kemp B.E. Witters L.A. Foskett J.K. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 1711-1721Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Second, AMPK may exert its effects through other molecules. CFTR likely exists within a complex of closely associated proteins, including those involved in its PKA-mediated phosphorylation (20Huang P. Trotter K. Boucher R.C. Milgram S.L. Stutts M.J. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: C417-C422Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PKA activates CFTR gating by destabilizing the channel closed conformation (4Winter M.C. Welsh M.J. Nature. 1997; 389: 294-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), whereas AMPK appears to inhibit CFTR gating by stabilizing the channel closed state, the opposite effect. Thus, it is possible that AMPK antagonizes the effects of PKA on CFTR channel gating by exerting its effects on proteins involved in the phosphorylation or dephosphorylation of CFTR. Alternatively, because the interaction of other proteins with CFTR may influence CFTR gating (15Raghuram V. Mak D.-O.D. Foskett J.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1300-1305Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 31Wang S.S. Yue H.W. Derin R.B. Guggino W.B. Lit M.

Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 783-791Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), those interactions could be sites of modulation by AMPK. It is interesting to note that the interaction of CFTR with the PDZ domain-containing protein NHERF, which has profound effects on CFTR gating (15Raghuram V. Mak D.-O.D. Foskett J.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1300-1305Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar), is mediated through sites located immediately downstream from the region of CFTR involved in binding to AMPK (7Hallows K.R. Raghuram V. Kemp B.E. Witters L.A. Foskett J.K. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 1711-1721Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar).AMPK activity is exquisitely sensitive to changes in the cell metabolic state, as relatively small changes in intracellular ATP levels produce large changes in the intracellular AMP:ATP ratio due to the rapid interconversion of ATP, ADP, and AMP by adenylate kinase (33Hardie D.G. Hawley S.A. Bioessays. 2001; 23: 1112-1119Crossref PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar). Because AMPK responds to the cellular AMP:ATP ratio, it can serve as a primary sensor of even minor changes in metabolic state. Therefore, AMPK may become engaged not only following severe reductions in intracellular ATP (e.g. that occur with ischemic or hypoxic injury) but also during more subtle, “physiological” fluctuations of intracellular ATP that may occur on a regular basis. Thus, the interaction of CFTR with AMPK may provide a sensitive mechanism to couple its activity to cell metabolic state, fine-tuning CFTR transport activity on a short time scale in response to metabolic conditions.CFTR appears to modulate the activities of various membrane transport proteins and may thereby help to coordinate an ensemble of proteins involved in transepithelial salt and water transport (34Schwiebert E.M. Benos D.J. Egan M.E. Stutts M.J. Guggino W.B. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: S145-S166Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). Thus, the AMPK-dependent regulation of CFTR may afford a mechanism to couple epithelial transport in general to cellular metabolic status. In addition, AMPK might directly modulate the activity of other important membrane transport proteins independently of CFTR. Indeed, AICAR-induced activation of AMPK appears to induce increased transcription and insertion of glucose transporters into the plasma membranes of muscle (29Kurth-Kraczek E.J. Hirshman M.F. Goodyear L.J. Winder W.W. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 1667-1671Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar, 35Abbud W. Habinowski S. Zhang J.Z. Kendrew J. Elkairi F.S. Kemp B.E. Witters L.A. Ismail-Beigi F.

Physiol. 2001; 90: 1073-1083Crossref Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Of note, the recent discovery that certain mutations in the γ subunit of AMPK cause the Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome (10Gollob M.H. Seger J.J. Gollob T.N. Tapscott T. Gonzales O. Bachinski L. Roberts R. Circulation. 2001; 104: 3030-3033Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 37Blair E. Redwood C. Ashrafian H. Oliviera M. Broxholme J. Kerr B. Salmon A. Ostman-Smith I. Watkins H. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2001; 10: 1215-1220Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), a disease that predisposes to fatal cardiac arrhythmias, may imply a possible functional link between AMPK and cardiac ion channels. Thus, further investigations into the effects of AMPK on various membrane transport proteins may provide important new insights into the pathophysiology of several disorders, including ischemic epithelial injury and cardiac arrhythmias.Finally, the results of this study illustrate the potential utility of agents (e.g. AICAR or metformin (11Zhou G. Myers R., Li, Y. Chen Y. Shen X. Fenyk-Melody J., Wu, M. Ventre J. Doebber T. Fujii N. Musi N. Hirshman M.F. Goodyear L.J. Moller D.E. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 1167-1174Crossref PubMed Scopus (4328) Google Scholar)) that enhance endogenous AMPK activity in the treatment of diseases where inappropriately high CFTR activity plays a role, including certain secretory diarrheas (3Kunzelmann K. Mall M. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 245-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar) and autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (38O'Sullivan D.A. Torres V.E. Gabow P.A. Thibodeau S.N. King B.F. Bergstralh E.J. Am. J. Kidney Dis. 1998; 32: 976-983Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Conversely, if agents that could selectively inhibit AMPK are discovered, they might be of benefit in diseases associated with inappropriately low CFTR activity (i.e. CF). A further understanding of the detailed mechanisms involved in the AMPK-CFTR regulatory interaction may also provide additional insights into the pathogenesis of CF.

Herein we demonstrate that activation of NFATc1 in human pulmonary valve endothelial cells is specific to vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) signaling through VEGF receptor 2. VEGF-induced NFATc1 nuclear translocation was inhibited by either cyclosporin A or a calcineurin-specific peptide inhibitor; these findings suggest that VEGF stimulates NFATc1 nuclear import in human pulmonary valve endothelial cells by a calcineurin-dependent mechanism. Importantly, both cyclosporin A and the calcineurin-specific peptide inhibitor reduced VEGF-induced human pulmonary valve endothelial cell proliferation, indicating a functional role for NFATc1 in endothelial growth. In contrast, VEGF-induced proliferation of human dermal microvascular and human umbilical vein endothelial cells was not sensitive to cyclosporin A.

Cardiol. 1995; 16: 155-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). Some of the defects, especially those that involve the aortic and pulmonary valves, require surgical intervention, which can include replacement of a defective valve. In the past decade, researchers have elucidated some of the basic signaling interactions necessary for heart development. In addition to initiating heart development, many of these pathways are also required for optimal heart function in post-natal life (3Chien K.R. Olson E.N. Cell. 2002; 110: 153-162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). However, comparatively little is known about the interactions that control more specific events, for example, induction of cardiac valve formation (4Srivasta D. Olson E.N. Nature. 2000; 407: 221-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar). In the mouse, primordial heart valves known as cardiac cushions begin to form by embryonic day 9.5. These cushions appear as swellings in the atrioventricular junction and outflow tract. As development proceeds, the cushions contribute to chamber septation and ultimately result in development of four adult valves. Initiation of endocardial cushion formation involves a distinct subset of endothelial cells in the cushion-forming area that undergo endothelial to mesenchymal transdifferentiation (EMT).1 It is believed that the underlying myocardium sends inductive signals to the endocardial cells, beginning the process of EMT (5Nakajima Y. Yamagishi T. Hokari S. Nakamura H. Anat. Rec. 2000; 258: 119-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). These newly formed mesenchymal cells migrate into the underlying extracellular matrix, where further remodeling transforms the cushions into fibrous leaflets. Studies have demonstrated that transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) signaling (6Ramsdell A.F. Markwald R.R. Dev. Biol. 1997; 188: 64-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) and the type III TGF-β receptor are required for EMT in avian models (7Brown C.B. Boyer A.S. Runyan R.B. Barnett J.V. Science. 1999; 283: 2080-2082Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). Indeed, TGF-β-mediated EMT has been shown to occur in post-natal ovine aortic valve endothelial cells (8Paranya G.

More recently, the phenotypes of mice and zebrafish in which specific genes have been “knocked out” or mutated have provided new insight into the genes required for normal valve development. For example, targeted gene deletion has demonstrated a specific requirement for NFATc1, also known as NFAT2, in valve development. Knockout of NFATc1 in the mouse leads to defective aortic and pulmonary valve development with subsequent death at embryonic days (E) 14–15 due to congestive heart failure (9de la Pompa J.L. Timmerman L.A. Takimoto H. Yoshida H. Elia A.J. Samper E. Pooter J. Wakeham A. Marengere L. Langille B.L. Crabtree G.R. Mak T.W.

Nature. 1998; 392: 186-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). The cardiac cushions in the outflow tract of these mice are hypoplastic, suggesting that lack of NFATc1 leads to dysregulation of an early step in cushion formation. Knockout of other NFAT proteins, such as NFATc2, c3, and c4, has no effect on valve development (11Crabtree G.R. Olson E.N. Cell. 2002; 109: S67-S79Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1102) Google Scholar). Members of the NFAT family function as mediators of the CsA-sensitive calcineurin-NFAT signaling pathway.

The upstream signaling events regulating NFATc1 activity in the valve endothelium are unknown, although all known NFAT proteins are dependent upon cytosolic Ca2+ flux for nuclear translocation. Increased cytosolic Ca2+ leads to activation of calmodulin and ultimately calcineurin, a serine/threonine phosphatase. When activated, calcineurin dephosphorylates residues in the conserved N-terminal region of various NFAT isoforms (16Rao A. Luo C. Hogan P.G. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 707-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (2227) Google Scholar, 17Masuda E.S. Imamura R. Amasaki Y. Arai K. Arai N. Cell. Signal. 1998; 10: 599-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). This dephosphorylation prompts a conformational change in NFAT that exposes a previously inaccessible nuclear localization sequence. NFAT is then shuttled into the nucleus, where it interacts with other transcription factors, including AP-1 and NF-κB, to alter gene transcription (18Crabtree G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2313-2316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). Although Ca2+ flux across the membrane is a ubiquitous signaling mechanism, specificity can be accomplished by differential expression of NFAT isoforms or use of specific ligand-receptor complexes that alter the pattern of calcium flux. Inhibitors of NFAT activation include the pharmacological agents CsA, FK506, and the synthetic peptide VIVIT. CsA and FK506 are immunosuppressant drugs that, in combination with immunophilins, bind to the catalytic subunit of calcineurin and inhibit its enzymatic activity (17Masuda E.S. Imamura R. Amasaki Y. Arai K. Arai N. Cell. Signal. 1998; 10: 599-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). VIVIT is a hydrophobic 16-amino acid peptide that mimics the calcineurin-docking motif of NFAT proteins and thereby inhibits calcineurin-mediated activation of NFATc1 (20Aramburu J. Yaffe M.B. Lopez-Rodriguez C. Cantley L.C. Hogan P.G. Rao A. Science. 1999; 285: 2129-2133Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). Recent studies have demonstrated that VEGF, an endothelial mitogen known to induce calcium mobilization upon receptor activation, may regulate NFATp activity in endothelial cells (21Kroll J. Waltenberger J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32521-32527Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). VEGF is a potent stimulator of angiogenesis and vascular permeability with the ability to induce endothelial proliferation, migration, and survival in vitro (22Ferrara N. Davis S.T. Endocrine Rev. 1997; 18: 4-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (3668) Google Scholar). In human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), VEGF has been shown to induce nuclear localization of NFATc2, also known as NFATp, by a CsA-sensitive mechanism, which resulted in increased tissue factor expression (23Armesilla A.L. Lorenzo E. del Arco P.G. Martinez-Martinez S. Alfranca A. Redondo J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2032-2043Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). In a separate study, administration of CsA prohibited VEGF from activating expression of cylcooxygenase-2 and inhibited angiogenesis in a corneal neovascularization model, again suggesting an important role for NFAT in vascular endothelial cells (24Hernandez G.L. Volpert O.V. Iniguez M.A. Lorenzo E. Martinez-Martinez S. Grau R. Fresno M. Redondo J.M. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 193: 607-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). Studies of VEGF expression in transgenic mice provide evidence for its role in cardiac valve development. LacZ-tagged VEGF knock-in mice were found to express VEGF at E 9.0 in endocardial cells along the entire heart tube (25Miquerol L. Gertsenstein M. Harpal K. Rossant J. Nagy A. Dev. Biol. 1999; 121: 307-322Crossref Scopus (237) Google Scholar). By E 9.5, VEGF expression was restricted to endothelial cells of the outflow tract and atrioventricular valve area. This expression pattern coincides precisely with the timing and location of NFATc1 expression in the embryonic valve (9de la Pompa J.L. Timmerman L.A. Takimoto H. Yoshida H. Elia A.J. Samper E.

In a different study, transgenic mice that overexpress VEGF in the embryonic myocardium at E 10.5 demonstrated decreased EMT in the endocardial cushions (26Miquerol L. Langille B.L. Nagy A. Development. 2000; 127: 3941-3946Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Dor Y. Camenisch T.D. Itin A. Fishman G.I. McDonald J.A. Carmeliet P. Keshet E. Development. 2001; 128: 1531-1538Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although these studies suggest a role for VEGF in heart valve development, little is known regarding the signaling cascade downstream of VEGF in valvular endothelial cells. To study the role of VEGF in NFATc1 signaling in endothelial cells, we performed experiments on human pulmonary valve endothelial cells (HPVEC). Our results demonstrate a unique pathway for VEGF-mediated proliferation of these cells involving an NFATc1-dependent mechanism. HPVEC were isolated from human pulmonary valve leaflets obtained from patients undergoing cardiovascular surgical procedures at Children's Hospital, Boston under an institutional review board-approved protocol. Removal of the pulmonary valve was a planned part of each procedure. Patients' ages ranged from 5 months to 20 years. The time interval from surgical excision to cell isolation was less than 1 h. Endothelial cells in primary cultures of human pulmonic valve leaflets were isolated usingUlex europaeus I-coated Dynabeads (28Jackson C.J. Garbett P.K. Nissen B. Schieber L. J. Cell Sci. 1990; 96: 257-262PubMed Google Scholar) as previously described (8Paranya G. Vineberg S. Dvorin E. Kaushal S. Roth S.J. Rabkin E. Schoen F.J. Bischoff J. Am. J. Pathol. 2001; 159: 1335-1343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). HPVECs were cultured on 1% gelatin-coated tissue culture plates in endothelial cell basal medium-2 (EBM-2, Clonetics) supplemented with endothelial cell growth media-2 SingleQuots (human VEGF, EGF, bFGF, insulin-like growth factor-1, ascorbic acid, gentamicin, and heparin; Clonetics), 20% heat-inactivated FBS, and glutamine/penicillin/streptomycin (GPS, Invitrogen). This culture media will be referred to as EBM-2. Cells were maintained in 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were generously provided by Dr. F. W. Luscinskas at Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston. Human dermal microvascular endothelial cells (HDMEC) were isolated and cultured as described previously (29Kraling B.M. Bischoff J. In Vitro Cell Dev. Biol. Anim. 1998; 34: 308-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence was performed as previously described (8Paranya G. Vineberg S. Dvorin E. Kaushal S. Roth S.J. Rabkin E. Schoen F.J. Bischoff J. Am. J. Pathol. 2001; 159: 1335-1343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells plated onto gelatin-coated glass coverslips were fixed with −20 °C methanol and incubated with primary antibody diluted 1:1000 followed by FITC- or Texas Red-conjugated secondary antibody at 5 μg/ml. von Willebrand factor (vWF) was detected using rabbit anti-human vWF (Dako) and Texas Red anti-rabbit IgG. CD31 (also known as platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule, PECAM-1) was detected using goat anti-human CD31 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and Texas Red anti-goat IgG. To detect lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced E-selectin, cells were treated with 1 μg/ml LPS for 3 h prior to staining with mouse anti-human E-selectin (29Kraling B.M. Bischoff J. In Vitro Cell Dev. Biol. Anim. 1998; 34: 308-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) and FITC-anti-mouse IgG. HPVEC were plated onto gelatin-coated glass cover slips for 1–3 days and then switched from EBM-2 medium to endothelial cell basal medium (EBM) containing 10% FBS (without the additive growth factors described above) for at least 24 h. Cells were then stimulated for 30 min with either 50 ng/ml VEGF165, bFGF (R&D Systems), or 1 μm calcium ionophore A23187 (Sigma). 5 μm CsA or 1 μmFK506 (Sigma) was added 2 h before VEGF stimulation. Cells were also stimulated with receptor-selective variants of VEGF: KDR-sel2 was shown to have wild-type affinity for KDR/VEGF-R2 but 2000-fold reduced binding to Flt-1, whereas Flt-1-sel was shown to have wild-type affinity for Flt-1 but 470-fold reduced binding to KDR/VEGF-R2 (30Li B.

Bing Li and Abraham M. de Vos (Genentech, Inc., South San Francisco, CA) kindly provided these receptor-selective variants, as well as comparably produced wild-type VEGF (VEGFwt, amino acids 1–109). NFATc1 expression was analyzed by fixing cells in 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilizing with 0.5% Triton X-100, and incubating with mouse anti-human NFATc1 mAb (7A6 from Santa Cruz Biotechnology) diluted 1:500 followed by FITC-conjugated anti-mouse IgG. An aliquot of the anti-human NFATc1 mAb for preliminary experiments was kindly provided by Dr. Gerald Crabtree (Stanford University). Cellular localizations of NFATc2, NFATc3, and NFATc4 were analyzed as described above using monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Cell lysates were prepared as described previously (8Paranya G. Vineberg S. Dvorin E. Kaushal S. Roth S.J. Rabkin E. Schoen F.J. Bischoff J. Am. J. Pathol. 2001; 159: 1335-1343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar) and subjected to SDS-PAGE using commercially available gradient gels. Gels were transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (Millipore). The membrane was rinsed in TBS-T solution (0.1% Tween 20 in TBS, pH 7.5) and incubated in blocking buffer (5% skim milk in TBS-T) at the room temperature. The membranes were incubated with the mouse anti-human NFATc1 (7A6 from Santa Cruz Biotechnology), mouse anti-human NFATc2 (G1-D10 from Santa Cruz Biotechnology), mouse anti-human NFATc3 (F-1 from Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or goat-anti-human NFATc4 (C-20 from Santa Cruz Biotechnology) antibodies diluted 1:500 for overnight at 4 °C, followed by horseradish peroxidase-labeled secondary antibodies diluted 1:2000 for 1 h at room temperature. The immunoreactive bands were visualized using chemiluminescent reagent (LumiGLO, KPL). 1 × 104 cells/well were plated onto gelatin-coated 48-well plates. One day later, cells were washed with PBS and incubated with CsA at 1, 5, 10, and 20 μm in low serum (2% FBS) or high serum (20% FBS) containing EBM-2 media for 48 h. Five hours before the end of the incubation, 50 μl of MTT solution (5 mg/ml) was added into each well. Media was removed, and 500 μl of Me2SO was added to each well. Dissolved crystals were transferred into 96-well plates, and absorbance at 550 nm was measured. Cell proliferation was assayed by [3H]thymidine incorporation (31Shing Y. Davidson M. Klagsbrun M. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 146: 42-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Cells were plated onto gelatin-coated 48-well plates at a density of 1 × 104cells/well. The next day, cells were washed with PBS and incubated in thymidine-free endothelial basal labeling medium (Clonetics) with 2% FBS and GPS (starvation medium) for 24 h. The quiescent cells were stimulated with fresh starvation medium containing 10 ng/ml VEGF, KDR-sel2, or Flt-sel, with or without CsA. Approximately 16–24 h after growth factor stimulation, 0.7 μCi of [3H]thymidine (6.7 Ci/mmol, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was added to each well, and incubations were continued for another 4 h. [3H]Thymidine DNA incorporation in the cell lysates was quantitated in a scintillation counter. Each condition was tested in triplicate, and the mean ± S.D. of [3H]thymidine DNA incorporation was calculated. Statistical significance was determined by Student's ttest, with a p value of <0.05 considered statistically significant. The -fold induction compared with cells with no VEGF stimulation was also determined. Proliferation assays on retrovirally transduced HPVEC were performed as above after the GFP-positive cells were sorted by FACS. Total RNA was isolated from human endothelial cells using an RNeasy kit (Qiagen). Blots were hybridized with 32P-labeled cDNA probes for KDR/VEGFR2, Flt-1/VEGF-R1, and neuropilin-1. The retroviral expression vectors, retro-EGFP, and retro-EGFP-VIVIT (contains an oligonucleotide coding for MAGPHPVIVITGPHEE at the N terminus of the green fluorescent protein (GFP)), were kindly provided by Dr. A. Blauvelt at NCI, National Institutes of Health and have been previously described (32Zoeteweij J.P. Moses A.V. Rinderknecht A.S. Davis D.A. Overwijk W.W. Yarchaon J.M. Blauvelt A. Blood. 2001; 97: 2374-2380Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). For viral production, 293 cells at 70% confluence were transfected in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 2 μg of retroviral expression vector and 2 μg of the packaging vector, pCL-10A1 (33Naviaux R.K. Costanzi E. Haas M. Verma I.M. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 5701-5705Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), using the Effectene transfection reagent (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's directions for a 100-mm dish. After 6 h, an equal volume of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 20% FBS, 1% GPS was added for a final concentration of 10% FBS. After 24 h, medium was replaced with 6 ml of EBM containing 10% FBS, 1% GPS, and, after an additional 24 h, supernatants were collected and filtered (0.45 μm). For retroviral infection, HPVEC at 50% confluence were incubated twice for 4 h with 5 ml of the viral supernatant containing 8 μg/ml Polybrene. 5 ml of EBM-2 was added after the second infection, and, after 24 h, the cells were washed and recovered in EBM-2. Cells positive for high levels of GFP expression (fluorescence signal > 102) were sorted by FACS and immediately plated onto a 48-well tissue culture dish for cell proliferation assays as described above. Similar transduction efficiencies of 40–50% were obtained using either retro-EGFP or retro-EGFP-VIVIT. To confirm that VIVIT was effectively inhibiting NFATc1 nuclear translocation, GFP-positive HPVEC were also plated in parallel onto gelatin-coated glass coverslips, cultured in EBM supplemented with 10% FBS for at least 24 h, and then stimulated with 50 ng/ml VEGF for 30 min. NFATc1 cellular localization was detected with immunofluorescence using mouse anti-human NFATc1 at 1:500 dilution followed by biotinylated anti-mouse IgG (H+L) and Texas Red Avidin D, both at 5 μg/ml. Normal human pulmonary valve leaflets (n = 3) were obtained from autopsies with post-mortem intervals ranging from 5 to 20 h according to a protocol approved by the Human Research Committee at the Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA. The mean age of the patients was 46.8 years. Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded human pulmonary valve tissues were sectioned in 5-μm slices. After antigen retrieval, sections were preincubated with 0.3% hydrogen peroxide to inhibit endogenous peroxidase activity and then incubated with primary anti-human CD31 mAb, anti-human NFATc1 mAb, or mouse IgG1 control mAb diluted in phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with 4% of the species-respective normal serum. After washing with phosphate-buffered saline, species-appropriate biotinylated secondary antibodies were applied, followed by avidin-peroxidase complex (Vectastain ABC kit, Vector Laboratories). The reaction was visualized with 3-amino-9-ethyl carbazole substrate (Sigma Chemical Co). Sections were counterstained with Gill's hematoxylin solution (Sigma) and mounted. The function of NFATc1 in valvular endothelium was studied using HPVEC isolated from human pulmonary valve leaflets. The cells uniformly expressed the endothelial-specific markers von Willebrand factor (vWF), CD31/PECAM-1, and LPS-inducible E-selectin, demonstrating that HPVECs retain expression of endothelial-specific markers in culture (Fig. 1). To identify extracellular ligands that stimulate NFATc1 activation in valvular endothelial cells, growth factors were tested for their ability to induce NFATc1 nuclear import in HPVEC. HPVEC were stimulated with 50 ng/ml VEGF, KDR-sel2, Flt-sel, or bFGF and then immunostained with an antibody specific for NFATc1. VEGF (50 ng/ml) was shown previously to be sufficient for stimulating NFATc2 (also known as NFATp) nuclear localization (23Armesilla A.L. Lorenzo E. del Arco P.G. Martinez-Martinez S. Alfranca A. Redondo J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2032-2043Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). VEGF stimulated the nuclear translocation of NFATc1 (Fig. 2 A, panel c) compared with untreated HPVECs (Fig. 2 A, panel b), at concentrations of VEGF as low as 10 ng/ml (data not shown). The pharmacological agents CsA (Fig. 2 A, panel d) and FK506 (data not shown) inhibited the VEGF-induced nuclear translocation, suggesting a calcineurin-dependent mechanism. As expected, the calcium ionophore A23187 also stimulated NFATc1 nuclear import (data not shown). KDR-sel2 stimulated NFATc1 nuclear translocation (Fig. 2 A, panel g), and, as observed with VEGF, the translocation was inhibited when CsA was included (Fig. 2 A, panel h). In contrast, Flt-1-sel did not induce translocation (Fig. 2 A, panel f), indicating that VEGF-induced NFATc1 translocation is mediated by KDR/VEGF-R2 and not Flt-1/VEGF-R1. When cells were treated with other endothelial mitogens such as bFGF, NFATc1 remained in the cytosol, as evident by a diffuse pattern of immunofluorescence (Fig. 2 A, panel e). Other growth factors, such as insulin-like growth factor-1, EGF, and heparin-binding EGF, and the endothelial factors angiopoietin-1 and -2, had no effect on NFATc1 localization (data not shown). These results demonstrate that the mechanism of NFATc1 activation and nuclear translocation in HPVEC is specific to VEGF signaling events mediated by KDR/VEGF-R2. NFATc1 activation was further examined by Western blot (Fig. 2 B). Dephosphorylation of NFATc1 results in increased mobility on SDS-PAGE (20Aramburu J. Yaffe M.B. Lopez-Rodriguez C. Cantley L.C. Hogan P.G. Rao A. Science. 1999; 285: 2129-2133Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). As seen in Fig. 2 B, three variants of NFATc1, with apparent molecular masses between 90 and 140 kDa, were detected with anti-human NFATc1 mAb (Fig. 2 B, lane 1). Removal of growth factors from the culture medium for 24 h had no effect on migration of the NFATc1 isoforms (lane 2). Treatment with VEGF for 15 min (lane 3) or for 24 h (lane 5) resulted in an increase in electrophoretic mobility of all three isoforms. This apparent dephosphorylation at 15 min and 24 h was inhibited in the presence of 5 μm CsA (lanes 4 and 6). Tubulin expression in each cell lysate is shown as a control (Fig. 2 B, lower panel). VEGF-induced translocation of NFATc2, NFATc3, and NFATc4 was examined as described in Fig. 2 A to determine which NFAT family members are activated by VEGF. NFAT family members c1, c2, and c3, but not c4, were detected in the cytoplasm of HPVEC in non-stimulated cells by indirect immunofluorescence using isoform-specific mAbs (Fig. 2 C,panels a–d). However, only NFATc1 was translocated into the nucleus when HPVEC were treated with 50 ng/ml VEGF for 30 min (Fig. 2 C, panels e–h). In Fig. 2 D, protein expression of NFATc1, c2, and c3 was analyzed by Western blot of HPVEC (lane 3), HUVEC (lane 4), and HDMEC (lane 5) cell lysates. Human lymphoma cell lines served as positive controls (lanes 1 and 2). As seen in Fig. 2 D, NFATc1, c2, and c3 were detected in all three human endothelial cultures. NFATc4 was not detected by Western blot (data not shown). NFATc2 expression was highest in HUVEC, compared with NFATc1 and NFATc3, consistent with previous studies showing NFATc2 (i.e. NFATp) in HUVECs. Also consistent with Armesillaet al. (23Armesilla A.L. Lorenzo E. del Arco P.G. Martinez-Martinez S. Alfranca A. Redondo J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2032-2043Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), NFATc2 was translocated into the nucleus of HUVECs in response to VEGF (data not shown). These results suggest that VEGF specifically induces translocation of NFATc1, but not NFATc2 or NFATc3, in valvular endothelial cells. We next sought to investigate the cellular effects of preventing VEGF-induced NFATc1 nuclear import. Because VEGF is a mitogen of endothelial cells (21Kroll J. Waltenberger J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32521-32527Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar) and NFAT signaling can increase proliferation in other cell types (16Rao A. Luo C. Hogan P.G. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 707-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (2227) Google Scholar), we used CsA to test whether VEGF induced valvular endothelial proliferation by an NFATc1-dependent mechanism. First, the potential cytotoxicity"
https://openalex.org/W2027809957,"Cellulase Cel5A from alkalophilicBacillus sp. 1139 contains a family 17 carbohydrate-binding module (BspCBM17) and a family 28 CBM (BspCBM28) in tandem. The two modules have significantly similar amino acid sequences, but amino acid residues essential for binding are not conserved. BspCBM28 was obtained as a discrete polypeptide by engineering the cel5A gene.BspCBM17 could not be obtained as a discrete polypeptide, so a family 17 CBM from endoglucanase Cel5A of Clostridium cellulovorans, CcCBM17, was used to compare the binding characteristics of the two families of CBM. BothCcCBM17 and BspCBM28 recognized two classes of binding sites on amorphous cellulose: a high affinity site (K a ∼1 × 106m−1) and a low affinity site (K a ∼2 × 104m−1). They did not compete for binding to the high affinity sites, suggesting that they bound at different sites on the cellulose. A polypeptide, BspCBM17/CBM28, comprising the tandem CBMs from Cel5A, bound to amorphous cellulose with a significantly higher affinity than the sum of the affinities ofCcCBM17 and BspCBM28, indicating cooperativity between the linked CBMs. Cel5A mutants were constructed that were defective in one or both of the CBMs. The mutants differed from the wild-type enzyme in the amounts and sizes of the soluble products produced from amorphous cellulose. This suggests that either the CBMs can modify the action of the catalytic module of Cel5A or that they target the enzyme to areas of the cellulose that differ in susceptibility to hydrolysis.

This suggests that either the CBMs can modify the action of the catalytic module of Cel5A or that they target the enzyme to areas of the cellulose that differ in susceptibility to hydrolysis. Many enzymes that hydrolyze insoluble polysaccharides contain discrete carbohydrate-binding modules (CBMs) 1The abbreviations used are: CBM, carbohydrate-binding module; BMCC, bacterial microcrystalline cellulose; K a, association constant; [N]o, binding capacity or density of binding sites; RC, regenerated cellulose that can increase the effective enzyme concentration on the polysaccharide surface (1Henrissat B. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1998; 26: 153-156Google Scholar, 2Tomme P. Warren R.A. Miller Jr., R.C. Kilburn D.G. Gilkes N.R. Saddler J.N. Penner M. Enzymatic Degradation of Insoluble Polysaccharides. American Chemical Society, Washington, D. C.1995: 142-163Google Scholar). CBMs are similar to lectins in that they can discriminate between different polysaccharides, and exhibit binding affinities in the micromolar range. Like their cognate catalytic modules, CBMs are classified into families of related amino acid sequences (afmb.cnrs-mrs.fr./∼cazy/CAZY/index.html). A particularly interesting group of CBMs are those that recognize cellulose, which is arguably the most important polysaccharide on the planet because of its source and abundance, it is the main structural polysaccharide in plant cell walls. Although the cellulose molecule is a simple polymer of up to 10,000 glucose residues linked by β-1,4-glucosidic bonds, natural cellulose is relatively resistant to enzymatic hydrolysis. Chains longer than six glucose residues are insoluble. In natural cellulose many molecules associate in parallel to form fibrils, which in turn associate to form fibers. Cellulose is heterogeneous: current biophysical techniques used to study the structure of cellulose show regions of highly ordered cellulose chains (crystalline cellulose), pseudo-ordered chains (para-crystalline cellulose), and disordered chains (so called “amorphous” or noncrystalline cellulose) (3Atalla R.H. Suominen P. Reinikainen T. Trichoderma reesei Cellulases and Other Hydrolases. Foundation for Biotechnical and Industrial Fermentation, Helsinki1993: 25-39Google Scholar). It is thought that the varied structure of cellulose contributes to its recalcitrance to complete hydrolysis by individual enzymes; the efficient degradation of cellulose is only achieved by the concerted action of complex microbial enzyme systems. It is known that some CBMs bind preferentially to the crystalline regions, others to the amorphous regions, and that the two types do not compete when binding (4McLean B.W. Bray M.R. Boraston A.B. Gilkes N.R. Haynes C.A. Kilburn D.G. Protein Eng. 2000; 13: 801-809Google Scholar). Those binding amorphous but not those binding crystalline cellulose can also bind soluble cellooligosaccharides. Surprisingly, some CBMs known to be specific for noncrystalline cellulose do not compete when binding, suggesting that they are discriminating between different regions of the amorphous cellulose and making it evident that the interaction of CBMs with noncrystalline cellulose may be more complex than originally thought (5McLean B.W. Boraston A.B. Brouwer D. Sanaie N. Fyfe C.A. Warren R.A. Kilburn D.G. Haynes C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50245-50254Google Scholar). It is significant in this context that the three-dimensional structure of amorphous cellulose is still unclear. Cellulase Cel5A from Bacillus sp. 1139, like several other enzymes in this family, contains a family 5 catalytic module and two CBMs, one from family 17 the other from family 28, both of which bind to amorphous cellulose. The combination of similarity in amino acid sequence and secondary structure analyses clearly established the structural relationship between family 17 and family 28 CBMs (8Boraston A.B. Ghaffari M. Warren R.A. Kilburn D.G. Biochem. J. 2002; 361: 35-40Google Scholar). However, the amino acid residues involved in binding are poorly conserved between these two families (8Boraston A.B. Ghaffari M. Warren R.A. Kilburn D.G. Biochem. J. 2002; 361: 35-40Google Scholar) suggesting that the CBMs might have different binding characteristics that could shed further light on the heterogeneity of noncrystalline cellulose. This paper shows that family 17 and family 28 CBMs do not compete for sites on noncrystalline cellulose, emphasizing the presence of cellulose chains with physical presentations that are distinguishable by the CBMs. Furthermore, the discrimination of these cellulose regions by the CBMs in Cel5A appears to influence cellulose hydrolysis by this enzyme. Microcrystalline cellulose (AvicelTMPH101; FMC International, Little Island, County Cork, Ireland), Oregon GreenTM succinimidyl ester (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR), cellohexaose (Seikagaku, Tokyo, Japan), and 2′,4′-dinitrophenyl-β-d-cellobioside (Sigma) were obtained from the sources indicated. Regenerated cellulose (RC) was prepared by phosphoric acid treatment of AvicelTM as reported previously (6Boraston A.B. Creagh A.L. Alam M.M. Kormos J.M. Tomme P. Haynes C.A. Warren R.A. Kilburn D.G. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 6240-6247Google Scholar). Bacterial microcrystalline cellulose (crystalline cellulose I) was prepared from cultures ofAcetobacter xylinum (ATCC 23769) as described previously (7Gilkes N.R. Jervis E. Henrissat B. Tekant B. Miller R.C.J. Warren R.A. Kilburn D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6743-6749Google Scholar). Gene fragments encoding CBMs were cloned, expressed, and the products purified as described elsewhere (8Boraston A.B. Ghaffari M. Warren R.A. Kilburn D.G. Biochem. J. 2002; 361: 35-40Google Scholar,9Notenboom V. Boraston A.B. Chiu P. Freelove A.C. Kilburn D.G. Rose D.R. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 314: 797-806Google Scholar). The CBMs used in this study were CcCBM17, the C-terminal module from Clostridium cellulovorans Cel5A (10Ishi A. Sheweita S. Doi R.H. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1998; 64: 1086-1090Google Scholar);BspCBM28, the C-terminal module from Bacillus sp. 1139 Cel5A; and BspCBM17/CBM28, the tandem of C-terminal CBMs from Bacillus sp. 1139 Cel5A. The concentration of purified proteins was determined by UV absorbance (280 nm) using calculated molar extinction coefficients (11Mach H. Middaugh C.R. Lewis R.V. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 200: 74-80Google Scholar) of 31,010m−1 cm−1, 32,290m−1 cm−1, and 70,900m−1 cm−1 for CcCBM17,BspCBM28, and BspCBM17/CBM27, respectively. Isothermal titration calorimetry was performed essentially as described previously (6Boraston A.B. Creagh A.L. Alam M.M. Kormos J.M. Tomme P. Haynes C.A. Warren R.A. Kilburn D.G. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 6240-6247Google Scholar) using a MCS isothermal titration calorimetry (MicroCal Inc., Northampton, MA).BspCBM17/CBM27 (wild-type or W453/W500 mutant) was at pH 7.0 in 50 mm K-phosphate buffer. Titrations were performed by injecting 10-μl samples of cellohexaose solution (5 mm in K-phosphate buffer saved from the dialysis ofBspCBM17/CBM27) isothermal titration calorimetry sample cell (volume = 1.3528 ml) containing 275 μm BspCBM17/CBM27. Heats of dilution of the titrant were assessed by titration of the carbohydrates into buffer lacking CBM; these were found to be negligible. Two or three independent titration experiments were performed. Stoichiometries, enthalpies, and equilibrium association constants were determined by fitting the corrected data to a bimolecular interaction model. Adsorption isotherms using RC or AvicelTM were obtained as described previously (4McLean B.W. Bray M.R. Boraston A.B. Gilkes N.R. Haynes C.A. Kilburn D.G. Protein Eng. 2000; 13: 801-809Google Scholar, 12Creagh A.L. Ong E. Jervis E. Kilburn D.G. Haynes C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12229-12234Google Scholar). Data were analyzed by nonlinear regression of the data to a Langmuir-type two binding site model (Equation 1), [B]=[N1]oKa1[F]1+Ka1[F]+[N2]oKa2[F]1+Ka2[F](Eq. 1) where [B] and [F] are the bound and free concentrations of CBM, respectively. [N 1]o and [N 2]o refer to the density of binding sites on the cellulose for site 1 and site 2.K a1 andK a2 are the association constants for binding sites 1 and 2. The Scatchard form of the isotherm data was also analyzed by nonlinear regression of the data to a modified McGhee-von Hipple (13McGhee J.D. von Hippel P.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1974; 86: 469-489Google Scholar) model that treats the cellulose as a one-dimensional lattice of overlapping binding sites and accounts for the possibility that not all of the lattice sites can accommodate CBMs (14Kristiansen A. Varum K.M. Grasdalen H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1425: 137-150Google Scholar) (Equation2). v[F]=FAKa(1−(n+1−FAFA)v)(1−nv1−(n−1)v)n−1(Eq. 2) F A is the fraction of lattice units accessible to CBM; n is the number of lattice units occupied by a single CBM; v is the ratio of bound CBM to the concentration of lattice units (i.e. v = [B]/[Lat], where [Lat] is the concentration of lattice units). Several sizes of lattice units were tried: a glucose unit, cellobiose unit, a cellopentaose unit, and a cellohexaose unit. This produced identical fits only with alterations in the regressed value ofn, as would be expected. The Scatchard form of the data was also analyzed by a model related to Equation 2 but incorporating a dimensionless term for cooperativity, w (15Kong Y. Biophys. Chem. 2002; 95: 1-6Google Scholar) (Equations 3and 4). v[F]=Kaw(1−nv)1+(2w−n−1)v+Q(2w−1)(1−nv)+v+Q2w(1−nv)(2w−1)(1−nv)+v+Qn−1(Eq. 3) Q=(1−(n+1)v)2+4wv(1−nv)(Eq. 4) This model does not account for a fraction of inaccessible lattice units, so v was calculated using estimates of the functional lattice unit concentration from the fits of Equation 2. Goodness-of-fit of the models to the data was assessed by runs tests of the residuals and p value analysis. CBMs were labeled with Oregon GreenTM 514 carboxylic acid succinimidyl ester, which labels the amine groups of lysines and the N terminus. This was done according to the instructions from the supplier. Fluorescence isotherms were obtained as described previously (4McLean B.W. Bray M.R. Boraston A.B. Gilkes N.R. Haynes C.A. Kilburn D.G. Protein Eng. 2000; 13: 801-809Google Scholar, 5McLean B.W. Boraston A.B. Brouwer D. Sanaie N. Fyfe C.A. Warren R.A. Kilburn D.G. Haynes C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50245-50254Google Scholar). Competition displacement assays were done as follows. A constant concentration of RC or AvicelTM (1 or 10 mg/ml, respectively) was mixed with a constant concentration of Oregon GreenTM-labeled CBM. The concentration of Oregon GreenTM-CBM chosen was sufficient to nearly or completely saturate the sites bound with high affinity. Unbound Oregon GreenTM-CBM at equilibrium was quantified by fluorescence spectroscopy in the presence of increasing concentrations of an unlabeled competing CBM and reference to a standard curve relating Oregon GreenTM-CBM concentration to fluorescence intensity: bound Oregon GreenTM-CBM = total Oregon GreenTM-CBM − unbound Oregon GreenTM-CBM. Displacement and, therefore, binding competition was determined graphically by plotting the concentration of bound Oregon GreenTM-CBM versus the concentration of competing CBM. Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) was used for cloning and protein purification. The plasmid used was pET28a (Novagen). E. coli cultures were grown routinely in TYP medium (16Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) containing 50 μg of kanamycin ml−1, at 37 °C for plasmid preparation or 30 °C for protein production. Plasmid preparation, bacterial transformation, and agarose gel electrophoresis were described previously (16Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Restriction endonucleases were used as recommended by the suppliers. DNA fragments were purified from the agarose gels with the Qiaex II kit (Qiagen). Oligodeoxynucleotide primers were synthesized by the Nucleic Acid and Protein Service (NAPS) Unit of the University of British Columbia, using an Applied Biosystems model 380A DNA synthesizer, and purified by extraction with 1-butanol. DNA was sequenced by the NAPS using the AmpliTaq dye termination cycle sequencing protocol and an Applied Biosystems model 377 sequencer. The DNA fragment corresponding to nucleotides 91–2287 (encoding amino acids 31–762) of the cel5A gene was amplified fromBacillus sp. 1139 genomic DNA (prepared as described previously (8Boraston A.B. Ghaffari M. Warren R.A. Kilburn D.G. Biochem. J. 2002; 361: 35-40Google Scholar)) by PCR. This was inserted via introduced 5′ and 3′NheI and HindIII restriction endonuclease sites, respectively, into appropriately digested pET28a (Novagen, Madison, WI). This construct was verified by DNA sequencing. The remaining Cel5A mutants (see text) were constructed using standard gene cloning techniques. E. coli BL21(DE3) containing the pET28aCel5A constructs were grown in 2.5 liters of TYP medium containing 50 μg of kanamycin ml−1 at 30 °C. The cultures were induced with 0.1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, either overnight at low optical density (0.1A 600) or 4 h at high optical density (0.6A 600). The cells were harvested and resuspended in 30 ml of 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.9, 0.5m NaCl, and ruptured by two passages through a French pressure cell. Debris in the cell extracts was removed by centrifugation for 30 min at 27,000 × g at 4 °C. Proteins were purified from the clarified cell extract by immobilized metal affinity chromatography according to the manufacturer's protocols (Novagen, Madison, WI). The concentrations of purified proteins were determined by UV absorbance (280 nm) and calculated molar extinction coefficients (11Mach H. Middaugh C.R. Lewis R.V. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 200: 74-80Google Scholar) of 145,800 m−1cm−1, 134,420 m−1cm−1, 102,740 m−1cm−1, and 91,360 m−1cm−1 for Cel5A, Cel5A17(−), Cel5AΔ28, and Cel5A17(−)Δ28, respectively. The activity of Cel5A and its mutants on RC was assayed at pH 7 and 37 °C by measuring the liberated reducing sugars with the hydroxybenzoic acid hydrazide reagent (17Lever M. Biochem. Med. 1973; 7: 274-281Google Scholar). The reaction mixture contained 20 nmol of enzyme and 20 mg of RC in 20 ml of 50 mm sodium citrate buffer, pH 7.0, with 0.02% sodium azide (i.e. 1 μm enzyme and 1 mg ml−1 RC). Duplicate samples were incubated at 37 °C for 96 h with slow end-over-end mixing on a tube roller. Samples of 0.3 ml were removed at intervals, then centrifuged twice for 5 min at 10,000 × g. Samples of 10 to 100 μl of the supernatants were assayed for reducing sugars (17Lever M. Biochem. Med. 1973; 7: 274-281Google Scholar). Reducing sugar concentrations were obtained by reference to a standard curve prepared with glucose. Heat-inactivated samples were analyzed by analytical high performance liquid chromatography using a CarboPac PA-100 column. Samples were loaded onto the column in 10 mm citrate buffer and eluted with a gradient of 0–100 mm sodium acetate in 100 mm sodium hydroxide. Eluted carbohydrates were detected by pulsed amperometry. Sample peaks were identified and quantified by comparison with the elution profiles of cellooligosaccharide standards. NeitherCcCBM17 nor BspCBM28 bound to highly crystalline cellulose I (bacterial microcrystalline cellulose) or highly crystalline cellulose II (mercerized cotton fibers) (not shown) but both bound to RC and AvicelTM (Fig.1, a and b). The adsorption isotherms were inconsistent with a single binding site Langmuir isotherm. Scatchard plots were concave confirming the complex nature of the binding (Fig. 1, c–f). Descending isotherms showed the binding of CcCBM17 and BspCBM28 to be completely reversible (not shown). CcCBM17 and BspCBM28 bind to soluble cellooligosaccharides (8Boraston A.B. Ghaffari M. Warren R.A. Kilburn D.G. Biochem. J. 2002; 361: 35-40Google Scholar, 9Notenboom V. Boraston A.B. Chiu P. Freelove A.C. Kilburn D.G. Rose D.R. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 314: 797-806Google Scholar). Therefore, they probably bind to individual chains in noncrystalline regions of insoluble cellulose but not to crystalline cellulose I and II. They have up to five glucose-binding subsites (8Boraston A.B. Ghaffari M. Warren R.A. Kilburn D.G. Biochem. J. 2002; 361: 35-40Google Scholar, 9Notenboom V. Boraston A.B. Chiu P. Freelove A.C. Kilburn D.G. Rose D.R. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 314: 797-806Google Scholar) so the molecules to whichCcCBM17 and BspCBM28 bind can be considered as a linear array of potentially overlapping binding sites. This could result in nonlinear Scatchard plots, as could the presence of multiple, independent classes of binding sites with differing affinities. Therefore, the binding isotherms for CcCBM17 andBspCBM28 were evaluated by nonlinear regression against binding models for noncooperative binding to two or more classes of binding sites (Equation 1), noncooperative binding with steric exclusion of overlapping binding sites (Equation 2), and cooperative binding with steric exclusion of overlapping binding sites (Equations 3and 4). The fits to the modified McGhee-von Hipple models (Equations 2,3, and 4) were poor and were rejected (Fig. 1). In contrast, fits using the two-binding site model (Equation 1) were better (Fig. 1). Whereas it is possible that there were more than two classes of binding sites, fits to three- or four-binding site models were not statistically better, so they were rejected on the basis that binding of this complexity could not be resolved with data of this accuracy. There was little difference between the association constants for CcCBM17 and BspCBM28 binding to RC and AvicelTM. Values of ∼1 × 106m−1 (ΔG ∼8.3 kcal/mol) were obtained for the high affinity association constant (K a1) and ∼2 × 104m−1 (ΔG ∼5.9 kcal/mol) for the low affinity K a2 (TableI). It must be noted that theK a values and binding site densities ([N]o) for the low affinity interactions are only estimates because the data do not extend to saturation of these binding sites. The association constants were 2–5-fold higher than originally reported for these CBMs, probably because of the use of a two-binding site model to fit the data, rather than the one-site model that was used originally. In general, the density of the low affinity sites ([N 2]o) was 2–10-fold higher than that of the high affinity sites ([N 1]o) for a given CBM and cellulose preparation (Table I). The densities of both classes of binding sites on both celluloses were 2–8-fold larger forCcCBM17 indicating a significant difference in the way the two CBMs recognize cellulose.Table IAdsorption parameters for the binding of CcCBM17 and BspCBM28 to Avicel™ and RC in 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, at 25 °CSite 1Site 2K a1ΔG 1[N 1]oa[N x]o, binding capacity, density of binding sites per gram of cellulose.K a2ΔG 2[N 2]oa[N x]o, binding capacity, density of binding sites per gram of cellulose.×105m−1kcal/molμmol/g×105m−1kcal/molμmol/gCcCBM17Avicel8.70 (±4.20)−8.04 (±0.45)0.26 (±0.06)0.07 (±0.02)−5.31 (±0.37)5.01 (±0.88)RC11.30 (±1.40)−8.41 (±0.32)8.57 (±0.52)0.18 (±0.05)−5.88 (±0.36)15.92 (±1.26)BspCBM28Avicel4.20 (±1.30)−7.72 (±0.38)0.08 (±0.02)0.20 (±0.05)−5.95 (±0.36)0.79 (±0.05)RC9.90 (±2.30)−8.28 (±0.35)3.72 (±0.36)0.21 (±0.07)−5.93 (±0.38)6.84 (±0.54)Errors represent the standard deviations of four binding experiments.a [N x]o, binding capacity, density of binding sites per gram of cellulose. Open table in a new tab Errors represent the standard deviations of four binding experiments. Neither CBM (20 μm) adsorbed to RC (0.5 mg/ml) in the presence of excess cellopentaose (1 mm), a specific competitor for the CBM-binding site. This ratio of CBM concentration to RC was sufficient to saturate the high affinity sites and extend into the low affinity interactions. Scatchard plots of isotherms obtained in the presence of bovine serum albumin, a noncellulose binding protein used as a “blocking” agent, and using fluorescently tagged Oregon GreenTM-CBMs to quantify free and bound protein also showed two classes of binding sites (not shown). This suggests specific binding to both classes of binding site, although a potential contribution of CBM-CBM interactions at the cellulose surface cannot be entirely excluded. BspCBM28 did not compete withCcCBM17 for binding to AvicelTM or RC (Fig.2). Likewise, CcCBM17 was unable to compete with BspCBM28 for binding to sites on AvicelTM or RC. Adsorption isotherms with labeled CBMs showed that the fluorescent label did not interfere with binding (not shown). As expected, unlabeled CBM competed with the same labeled CBM for binding (data not shown). Therefore, there appear to be separate and distinct high affinity binding sites for CcCBM17 andBspCBM28 in noncrystalline cellulose. The quantities of protein required to do these experiments precluded a similar approach to examining competition for the low affinity class of sites. The BspCBM17/CBM28 tandem from Bacillus sp. 1139 Cel5A bound very tightly to RC and recognized two classes of binding sites (not shown). Nonlinear regression of the data with a two-site binding model gave a high affinity interaction K a1 and [N 1]o of 2.1 (±0.8) × 107m−1 and 3.5 (±0.9) μmol/g RC, respectively, and a low affinity interactionK a2 and [N 2]o of 1.1 (±0.5) × 106m−1 and 4.7 (±0.7) μmol/g RC, respectively. In CcCBM17 tryptophan residues 88 and 135 are crucial to cellulose binding (9Notenboom V. Boraston A.B. Chiu P. Freelove A.C. Kilburn D.G. Rose D.R. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 314: 797-806Google Scholar). Analogous tryptophan to alanine mutations at residues 453 and 500 in the CBM17 module of BspCBM17/CBM28 to give BspCBM17(−)/CBM28 (residue numbers correspond to that of the whole Cel5A enzyme) resulted in a stoichiometry of 1.1 (±0.1) for binding cellohexaose in contrast to a stoichiometry of 2 mol of cellohexaose to 1 mol of wild-typeBspCBM17/CBM28. The binding parameters ofBspCBM17(−)/CBM28 were virtually identical to those for the isolated BspCBM28 module (K a = 3.90 (±0.05) × 104m−1 and ΔH = −58.24 (±1.0) kJ/mol for BspCBM17(−)/CBM28 andK a = 4.04 (±0.05) × 104m−1 and ΔH = −62.24 (±0.5) kJ/mol for BspCBM28 (8Boraston A.B. Ghaffari M. Warren R.A. Kilburn D.G. Biochem. J. 2002; 361: 35-40Google Scholar)). Thus, the mutations effectively destroyed binding by the CBM17 module. Three mutants of Cel5A were made in which CBM28 was deleted or CBM17 inactivated by the Trp453/Trp500 double mutation (Fig.3). The kinetics of 2′4′-dinitrophenyl-β-d-cellobioside hydrolysis were the same, within experimental error, for wild-type Cel5A and the three mutants. Therefore, the catalytic activity of the enzyme was unaffected by the mutations (not shown). The initial rates of reducing sugar release from RC were: Cel5A, 300 (±15) μmol liter−1 h−1; Cel5A17(−), 252 (±9) μmol liter−1h−1; Cel5AΔ28, 205 (±7) μmol liter−1h−1; Cel5A17(−)Δ28, 170 (±15) μmol liter−1 h−1 (Fig.4 A). The enzyme concentrations used (1 μm) were such that only high affinity sites were bound. The rates of hydrolysis slowed with time until at ∼20 h all four enzymes were working at similar rates (indicated by constant differences between Cel5A, Cel5A17(−), Cel5AΔ28, and Cel5A17(−)Δ28; Fig. 4 B). None of the reactions went to completion; only ∼20–25% of the insoluble cellulose was converted to soluble sugars. After 48 h of incubation the addition of fresh RC to hydrolysis reactions resulted in a burst of reducing sugar release for all four Cel5A derivatives (not shown) indicating that the wild-type and mutant enzymes were stable beyond 48 h of incubation. Furthermore, although the rates of sugar release in this burst were ∼3-fold lower than at the initial time points, the relative rates of the enzymes remained consistent (not shown). Glucose (G1), cellobiose (G2), and cellotriose (G3) were the only soluble products released from RC by the wild-type and mutant enzymes during the first 10 min of hydrolysis (Fig. 5 A). As hydrolysis proceeded, G1 and G2 continued to accumulate, but G3 decreased after 2 h, presumably by its hydrolysis. The rates of G1, G2, and G3 release were subtly different (Fig. 5, B and C). Wild-type Cel5A and Cel5A17(−) had better initial rates of glucose release than Cel5AΔ28 and Cel5A17(−)Δ28, which were essentially the same (Fig. 5 B). The initial rates of G2 and G3 production were similar for wild-type Cel5A, Cel5A17(−), and Cel5AΔ28, perhaps with wild-type favoring G2 production slightly (Fig. 5, C andD). All produced G2 and G3 more rapidly than Cel5A17(−)Δ28. CcCBM17 and BspCBM28 are unable to bind to crystalline preparations of cellulose and, therefore, must recognize only the regions of RC and AvicelTM that are not crystalline. The crystal structure of CcCBM17 revealed a binding site architecture well designed to accommodate only individual glucan chains providing a rationale for this binding specificity (9Notenboom V. Boraston A.B. Chiu P. Freelove A.C. Kilburn D.G. Rose D.R. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 314: 797-806Google Scholar). Examples of CBMs in families 4, 6, 17, 28, and 29, now form a class of cellulose-specific modules that bind glucan chains rather than crystalline surfaces (8Boraston A.B. Ghaffari M. Warren R.A.

The presence of high and low affinity binding sites for CcCBM17 and BspCBM28 in noncrystalline cellulose is a new and unexpected finding. It suggests multiple different physical presentations of cellulose chains that are sufficiently different to be discriminated by CBMs. Differences in physical presentation of a cellulose chain may involve chain conformation, the presence of local microstructure (e.g.proximity of other chains), or even differences in solvation. Distinct binding sites are also present on crystalline cellulose:CfCBM2a from Cellulomonas fimi Xylanase 10A recognized high affinity and low affinity binding sites in bacterial microcrystalline cellulose (12Creagh A.L. Ong E. Jervis E. Kilburn D.G. Haynes C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12229-12234Google Scholar). In this case, heterogeneity in the structure of crystalline cellulose was proposed t"

Contractility in both cardiac muscle and gastrointestinal smooth muscle is initiated by membrane electrical events as a result of changes in ionic conductances (7Farrugia G. Annu. Rev.

In the heart, the upstroke of the action potential is mediated via opening of a tetrodotoxin-insensitive Na+ channel, the α subunit of which is encoded by SCN5A (9Gellens M.E.

Mutations in SCN5A can result in clinically significant cardiac arrhythmias (8Ackerman M.J. Siu B.L. Sturner W.Q. Tester D.J. Valdivia C.R. Makielski J.C. Towbin J.A. JAMA (J. Am. Med.

G., and Farrugia, G. (2002) Am. J. Physiol., in pressGoogle Scholar). Mechanosensitivity appears to be dependent on the actin cytoskeleton, since disruption of the actin cytoskeleton by cytochalasin D or gelsolin abolishes mechanosensitivity (13Strege, P., Holm, A. N., Rich, A., Miller, S. M., Ou, Y., Sarr, M. G., and Farrugia, G. (2002) Am. J. Physiol., in pressGoogle Scholar). This suggests that the actin cytoskeleton is required to transmit force to the ion channel. Syntrophins are suggested to be a link between the actin cytoskeleton and membrane-associated proteins including ion channels, enzymes, and receptors, since actin filaments are not known to directly interact with these proteins (14Gee S.H.

The PDZ domains of syntrophins α, β1, and β2 but not γ1 are known to interact with SCN5A and with SCN4A, a skeletal muscle Na+ channel, via the C terminus sequence motif (E(S/T)XV) (14Gee S.H.

The objective of this study was to investigate the interaction between SCN5A and syntrophins in intestinal smooth muscle and the functional consequences of such an interaction on mechanosensitivity. Our hypothesis was that syntrophins couple SCN5A with the actin cytoskeleton, providing a mechanism for mechanical regulation of voltage-dependent ion channel gating. The Mayo Foundation Institutional Review Board approved the use of human tissue obtained as surgical waste tissue during gastric bypass operations performed for morbid obesity. The method for dissociation of smooth muscle cells from human jejunal circular smooth muscle strips was as previously described (11Holm A.N. Rich A. Miller S.M. Strege P., Ou, Y. Gibbons S.J.

Briefly, the mucosa, submucosa, and longitudinal muscle of the jejunum were removed from the specimen by sharp dissection. The circular smooth muscle layer was then cut into small pieces and incubated with enzyme to release single smooth muscle cells used for patch clamp studies and single cell reverse transcription (RT)1-PCR. Procedures for RNA isolation and the procedure for preparation of c-DNA libraries were as described previously (11Holm A.N. Rich A. Miller S.M. Strege P., Ou, Y. Gibbons S.J. Sarr M.G. Szurszewski J.H. Rae J.L. Farrugia G. Gastroenterology. 2002; 122: 178-187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar,12Ou Y. Gibbons S.J. Miller S.M. Strege P.R. Rich A.

All PCR amplifications were performed using GeneAmp 2400 PCR systems (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) using standard procedures (12Ou Y. Gibbons S.J. Miller S.M. Strege P.R. Rich A. Distad M.A. Ackerman M.J. Rae J.L. Szurszewski J.H. Farrugia G. Neurogastroenterol. Motil. 2002; 14: 477-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The protocol for single cell RT-PCR was as previously outlined (12Ou Y. Gibbons S.J. Miller S.M. Strege P.R. Rich A. Distad M.A. Ackerman M.J. Rae J.L. Szurszewski J.H. Farrugia G. Neurogastroenterol. Motil. 2002; 14: 477-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Spindle-shaped single smooth muscle cells were collected directly into PCR tubes containing tRNA and proteinase K. RT was performed using a mixture of random hexamer and oligo(dT) primers following the instructions of the manufacturer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The product of the RT reaction was then amplified for syntrophins using gene-specific primers that were specifically designed to flank a region that contained introns. All PCR products were purified and sent to the Mayo Molecular Core Facility for automated DNA sequencing. Surgical waste tissue was fixed in ice-cold acetone according to the protocol described previously (12Ou Y. Gibbons S.J. Miller S.M. Strege P.R. Rich A. Distad M.A. Ackerman M.J. Rae J.L. Szurszewski J.H. Farrugia G. Neurogastroenterol. Motil. 2002; 14: 477-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The same number of spots of tissue containing about 1500 smooth muscle cells from the circular muscle layer or the longitudinal muscle layer were collected using the PIX II cell laser capture microdissection system (Arcturus Engineering Inc., Santa Clara, CA) with the 7.5-μm spot size. The caps with collected cells were then immediately placed into sterile 0.5-ml microcentrifuge tubes containing 300 μl of RNA STAT-60 reagent (Tel-TEST Inc., Friendswood, TX) for isolation of total RNA. After washing with 75% ethanol, the RNA pellet was resuspended in nuclease-free water (Ambion Inc., Austin, TX) and used for the RT-PCR. Pieces of human jejunum (approximately 1 × 1 cm) were prepared for immunohistochemistry as previously described (12Ou Y. Gibbons S.J. Miller S.M. Strege P.R. Rich A. Distad M.A. Ackerman M.J. Rae J.L. Szurszewski J.H. Farrugia G. Neurogastroenterol. Motil. 2002; 14: 477-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Briefly, cryostat sections (12 μm thick) were mounted onto glass slides, air-dried, fixed for 10 min in either cold acetone or 4% paraformaldehyde, and rinsed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Sections were incubated with 10% normal donkey serum and 0.3% Triton X-100 for 1 h to block nonspecific absorption sites and then incubated overnight at 4 °C with anti-syntrophin γ2 rabbit polyclonal antibody (diluted 1:200 in 5% normal donkey serum; a kind gift from Dr. Vincenzo Nigro). The specificity of this antibody for syntrophin γ2 has been previously shown by Piluso et al.(22Piluso G. Mirabella M. Ricci E. Belsito A. Abbondanza C. Servidei S. Puca A.A. Tonali P. Puca G.A. Nigro V. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15851-15860Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). After several rinses in PBS, the sections were incubated for 1 h with donkey, anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to CY3 (1:100 dilution in 2.5% normal donkey serum), rinsed in PBS, and coverslipped in glycerol-PBS containing an anti-fade reagent. Yeast two-hybrid assays were performed using HybriZAP-2.1 two-hybrid system (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The cDNA fragments encoding the C terminus of SCN5A (amino acids 1915–2015, CTSCN5A) and the C terminus with last 10 amino acids truncated (amino acids 1915–2005, CTSCN5A-10) were amplified by PCR and cloned into EcoRI and SalI restriction sites of the pBD-GAL4 vector to serve as baits in the yeast two-hybrid experiments. Two full-length splice variants of syntrophin γ2, one with an intact PDZ domain and the other lacking the PDZ domain, were inserted into pAD-GAL4 vector (pAD+γ2 and pAD+γ2-PDZ, respectively). The nucleotide sequences of the DNA inserts were confirmed by sequence analysis to verify that inserts did not contain mutations. The inserts were expressed as fusion proteins with the DNA binding domain and DNA activating domain of GAL4. Several small scale yeast transformations were performed using the lithium acetate method with 40% polyethylene glycol. The plasmids CTSCN5A and CTSCN5A-10 were cotransformed with the plasmids pAD+γ2 or pAD+γ2-PDZ into the YRG-2 yeast strain containing HIS3 and lacZ double reporter genes. After transformation, the yeast was plated on selective plates lacking tryptophan, leucine, and histidine to show activation of the GAL4-inducible reporter gene HIS3 through protein-protein interaction. The colonies that grew on the selective plates were either due to the leaky expression of HIS3 or to the specific interaction between proteins resulting in expression of the HIS3 gene. To distinguish between leaky expression and specific protein interactions, we used filter lift assays to detect the expression of a second reporter gene, lacZ. The colonies on the selective plate were lifted onto a filter and assayed for β-galactosidase activity using 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (X-gal) as a substrate. The bacterial expression vector pGEX-5X-1 (Amersham Biosciences) was used to produce a GST fusion protein inEscherichia coli. The C-terminal fragments of SCN5A with and without the truncation were fused in frame into pGEX-5X-1 to produce plasmids pGEX+CT5A and pGEX+CT5A-10. To express GST fusion proteins, pGEX+CT5A and pGEX+CT5A-10 were transformed into BL21 (DE3) (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Each bacterial culture was induced by isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 0.1 mm and allowed to express protein at 28 °C for 4 h. Then the cells were pelleted and resuspended in PBS and 10 mg/ml lysozyme. After incubation for 30 min on ice, protease inhibitor mixture (Calbiochem) was added, and the cells were rocked at 4 °C for 10 min. To destroy the DNA and RNA, the samples were treated with DNase and RNase. The protein extract was then extracted by centrifugation at 3000 × g for 30 min and incubated with glutathione beads (Amersham Biosciences). The complete coded sequences of the splice variants of syntrophin γ2 with and without the PDZ domain were linked into the expression vector pCMV-FLAG, which tags the FLAG epitope at the N terminus, to make plasmids pCMV-γ2 and pCMV-γ2-PDZ. After the constructs were verified by sequencing their inserts, the pCMV-γ2 and pCMV-γ2-PDZ constructs were transfected into HEK 293 cells to express the FLAG-tagged syntrophin γ2 proteins. The cells were lysed 24 h later in lysis buffer, and the supernatants were used for GST pull-down experiments. 100 μl (∼200 μg) of HEK 293 cell extracts containing the FLAG-tagged syntrophin γ2 proteins were incubated with 20–25 μl (∼10 μg) of GST + CT5A/GST + CT5A-10 bead-bound fusion proteins and, as a control, the GST-alone bead-bound fusion protein. After extensive washing with lysis buffer, the samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membrane was then incubated with anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody (Sigma). After washing, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG was used. The immunoreactive bands were visualized by ECL according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Biosciences). The pGEX-5X-1 plasmid constructs for the PDZ domain of syntrophin γ2 were generated by using the same method described above for the C terminus of SCN5A. The constructs were verified by sequencing, and the plasmids encoding GST alone and GST plus PDZ were then introduced into BL21 cells for expression. After induction by isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, the cell extracts were incubated with glutathione-agarose beads for affinity purification. Following washing, GST and GST plus PDZ were eluted with 10 mm reduced glutathione in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0). For patch clamp analysis, the elution was dialyzed in 10 mm HEPES with 50 mm CsCl. The purity of the proteins was determined by SDS-12% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The bands of the fusion proteins were of the expected size with high purity. Protein concentrations were estimated using the Bio-Rad protein assay kit. A peptide corresponding to the last 10 amino acids (SPDRDRESIV) of the C terminus of the human SCN5A sequence and a control peptide containing the same amino acids but in random sequence (PRRSVSDDEI) were synthesized by the Mayo Peptide Synthesis Facility of the Mayo Proteomics Research Center. The peptides were purified by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography using a Vidak C-18 column. Purity was >95% as assessed by amino acid analysis and analytical high performance liquid chromatography. Mass weight of the peptide was verified by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry on a Sciex 165B (Concord, Canada). The pcDNA3 expression vector (Invitrogen) with human SCN5A (hH1c) was used in the Na+ channel expression experiments. The truncation vector containing the full-length SCN5A minus the last 10 amino acids was made by PCR. The cDNAs for syntrophin γ2 were produced by PCR and inserted into the pcDNA3 vector usingEcoRI and SalI. All constructs were verified by sequencing. LipofectAMINE™ 2000 Reagent (Invitrogen) was used to transfect green fluorescent protein, pEGFP-C1, (Clontech), sodium channel SCN5A, and syntrophin γ2 HEK293 cells (ATCC, Manassas, VA). Transfected cells were identified by fluorescence microscopy and patch-clamped. Whole cell patch clamp recordings were made using standard patch clamp techniques. Whole cell recordings were obtained using Kimble KG-12 glass pulled on a P-97 puller (Sutter Instruments, Novato, CA). Electrodes were coated with R6101 (Dow Corning, Midland, MI) and fire-polished to a final resistance of 3–5 megaohms. Currents were amplified, digitized, and processed using a CyberAmp 320 amplifier, a Digidata 1200, and pCLAMP 8 software (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA). Whole cell records were sampled at 5 kHz and filtered at 2 kHz with an eight-pole Bessel filter. 70–75% series resistance compensation (lag of 60 μs) was applied during each recording. The cell capacitance (C m) was 40–100 picofarads in human jejunal circular smooth muscle cells and 5–30 picofarads in HEK 293 cells. The access resistance (R a) was 5–10 megaohms. All records were obtained at room temperature (21 °C). For human jejunal circular smooth muscle cell recordings, cells were held at −100 mV and stepped to −80 through +35 mV at 5-mV intervals for 50 ms. The interval from the start of one depolarization to the next was 1 s. SCN5A-overexpressed Na+ currents at a −100-mV holding potential were much larger in HEK 293 than in native cells. Therefore, for HEK-293 cell records, cells were held at −80 mV to reduce maximal peak inward current. Transfected cells were then pulsed to the same voltages as described above. Steady state inactivation in transfected cells was determined using a pulse protocol where cells held at −80 mV, stepped to −110 through −60 mV in 5-mV intervals for 3 s to reach a steady state of inactivation, briefly stepped to −110 mV for 10 ms (to standardize transients), and finally stepped to −40 mV. Current was measured at −40 mV. The interval from the start of one depolarization to the next was 4 s. The pipette solution contained 145 mm Cs+, 20 mm Cl−, 2 mm EGTA, 5 mm HEPES, and 125 mm methane sulfonate for most whole cell recordings. In peptide experiments, the terminal 10-amino acid SCN5A peptide or the control jumbled sequence peptide was added to this intracellular solution to a concentration of 1 mm. The bath solution contained 149.2 mm Na+, 4.7 mm K+, 159 mm Cl−, 2.5 mm Ca2+, and 5 mm HEPES (normal Ringers solution) with an osmolarity of 290–300 mosm. All chemicals other than peptides were obtained from Sigma. Bath perfusion was used to assess mechanosensitivity as previously described (25Holm A.N. Rich A. Sarr M.G. Farrugia G. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: G1155-G1161Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Lyford G.L. Strege P.R. Shepard A., Ou, Y. Ermilov L. Miller S.M. Gibbons S.J. Rae J.L. Szurszewski J.H. Farrugia G. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: C1001-C1008Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The bath was perfused at 10 ml/min for 30 s to create shear stress and activate the mechanosensitive Na+channel according to a previously established protocol (13Strege, P., Holm, A. N., Rich, A., Miller, S. M., Ou, Y., Sarr, M. G., and Farrugia, G. (2002) Am. J. Physiol., in pressGoogle Scholar). Electrophysiological data were analyzed using PCLAMP 8 software, custom macros in Excel (Microsoft, Redmond, WA), or SigmaPlot 2001 for Windows (SPSS Science Marketing, Chicago, IL). Voltages were adjusted for junction potentials using JPCalcW. Statistical comparisons were performed by a two-tailed paired Student's t test, and p < 0.05 was used for statistical significance. Tau of inactivation values were determined by fitting a standard two-exponential decay curve between the points at the peak and at 50 ms. Time-to-peak was measured as the difference between the time when the pulse started and the time at maximal peak inward current. Steady state activation and inactivation curves were fitted with a three-parameter sigmoid (Boltzmann) function. To determine which syntrophins are expressed in intestinal smooth muscle, we used gene-specific primers designed against the five known syntrophins (α, β1, β2, γ1, and γ2) to amplify cDNAs from dissociated human jejunal circular smooth muscle cell libraries. Products of the expected size were detected for syntrophin α, β1, and β2 using the appropriate oligonucleotide primers (Fig. 1 A). PCR amplification for syntrophin γ2 produced three bands. Sequence analysis showed that all three cDNA fragments were different splice variants of syntrophin γ2. Syntrophin γ1 was not present in human jejunal circular smooth muscle (Fig. 1 A), consistent with its limited expression to the brain (22Piluso G. Mirabella M. Ricci E. Belsito A. Abbondanza C.

RT-PCR was also carried out on aliquots of freshly dissociated smooth muscle cells and cDNA bands of the expected size for syntrophin α, β1, β2, and γ2 obtained (data not shown), again suggesting that these syntrophins were expressed in intestinal smooth muscle together with the known expression of syntrophins in cardiac and skeletal muscle (22Piluso G. Mirabella M. Ricci E. Belsito A. Abbondanza C. Servidei S. Puca A.A. Tonali P. Puca G.A. Nigro V. J. Biol.

To determine the anatomical location of syntrophins within the human intestinal smooth muscle layers, we used laser capture microdissection to collect, separately, smooth muscle cells from the jejunal circular muscle layer and longitudinal muscle layer. Total RNA was extracted from the harvested cells, and reverse transcription was carried out using random primers. An aliquot from the reverse transcription was used for PCR amplification with one specific primer pair for either α, β1, β2, or γ2 in each tube. Single bands of the expected size for syntrophin α and β2 were observed in both circular and longitudinal smooth muscle (Fig. 1 B). Syntrophin γ2 was detected only in circular smooth muscle, and β1 was detected only in longitudinal smooth muscle (Fig. 1 B). The housekeeping gene glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase was amplified from the RT products and used as an internal control. To further confirm the localization of syntrophin γ2 to the circular muscle layer of the human intestine, we immunolabeled human jejunal sections with a rabbit polyclonal antibody directed against syntrophin γ2 (a kind gift from Dr. Vincenzo Nigro). As shown in Fig. 1 C, strong syntrophin γ2 immunoreactivity was observed in the circular smooth muscle layer but not in the longitudinal muscle layer. Control experiments omitting the primary antibody showed no immunoreactivity in the circular muscle layer (data not shown). Since several different cell types reside in the intestinal smooth muscle layers, single cell RT-PCR was used to localize syntrophins to smooth muscle cells. Smooth muscle cells were dissociated from strips of circular smooth muscle and identified according to their spindle shape. Two or three cells were collected and placed in each tube. Syntrophin α, β2, and γ2 were successfully amplified with gene-specific primer sets designed to span an intron (Fig. 1 D) to exclude genomic sequence. The correct size band was recovered from the agarose gel using conventional techniques, and results were confirmed by sequence analysis. There were no products in negative controls (4 μl of bath solution aspirated just above a smooth muscle cell) (Fig. 1 D). These results were duplicated in three additional experiments. Similar to the layer-specific expression of syntrophin γ2, SCN5A is expressed in human intestinal circular smooth muscle cells but does not appear to be strongly expressed in longitudinal cells (12Ou Y. Gibbons S.J. Miller S.M. Strege P.R. Rich A. Distad M.A. Ackerman M.J. Rae J.L. Szurszewski J.H. Farrugia G. Neurogastroenterol. Motil. 2002; 14: 477-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). This cell-specific colocalization between expression of SCN5A and syntrophin γ2 led us to focus on syntrophin γ2. PCR amplification for syntrophin γ2 (Fig. 1 A) showed three bands, suggesting different transcripts of syntrophin γ2. To isolate the full-length coding sequence for each transcripts, we designed primers to cover the whole open reading frame. RT-PCR amplification using human jejunal muscle tissue produced a 1.7-kb cDNA fragment, which was subcloned into pCR2.1 plasmid vector using the TOPO-TA protocol (Invitrogen). Sequence analysis showed at least five splice variants of syntrophin γ2 in human jejunal muscle (Fig. 2). Splice variant 1 was identical to the published sequence of syntrophin γ2 with 17 exons (accession number NM_018968). Splice variant 2 had a 27-bp in-frame deletion in exon 9 that would result in loss of the protein kinase C phosphorylation site.

https://openalex.org/W2139262699,"We have recently characterized the protein product of the human NUDT9 gene as a highly specific ADP-ribose (ADPR) pyrophosphatase (1). We now report an analysis of the human NUDT9 gene and its potential alternative transcripts along with detailed studies of the enzymatic properties and cell biological behavior of human NUDT9 protein. Our analysis of the human NUDT9 gene and twenty-two distinct cloned NUDT9 transcripts indicates that the full-length NUDT9α transcript is the dominant form, and suggests that an alternative NUDT9β transcript (2) occurs as the result of a potentially aberrant splice from a cryptic donor site within the first exon to the splice acceptor site of exon 2. Computer analysis of the predicted protein of the NUDT9α transcript identified an N-terminal signal peptide or subcellular targeting sequence. Using green fluorescence protein tagging, we demonstrate that the predicted human NUDT9α protein is targeted highly specifically to mitochondria, whereas the predicted protein of the NUDT9β transcript, which is missing this sequence, exhibits no clear subcellular localization. Investigation of the physical and enzymatic properties of NUDT9 indicates that it is functional as a monomer, optimally active at near neutral pH, and that it requires divalent metal ions and an intact Nudix motif for enzymatic activity. Furthermore, partial proteolysis of NUDT9 suggests that NUDT9 enzymes consist of two distinct domains: a proteolytically resistant C-terminal domain retaining essentially full specific ADPR pyrophosphatase activity and a proteolytically labile N-terminal portion that functions to enhance the affinity of the C-terminal domain for ADPR."
https://openalex.org/W2072073925,"Vertebrate rhodopsin consists of the apoprotein opsin and the chromophore 11-cis-retinal covalently linked via a protonated Schiff base. Upon photoisomerization of the chromophore to all-trans-retinal, the retinylidene linkage hydrolyzes, and all-trans-retinal dissociates from opsin. The pigment is eventually restored by recombining with enzymatically produced 11-cis-retinal. All-trans-retinal release occurs in parallel with decay of the active form, metarhodopsin (Meta) II, in which the original Schiff base is intact but deprotonated. The intermediates formed during Meta II decay include Meta III, with the original Schiff base reprotonated, and Meta III-like pseudo-photoproducts. Using an intrinsic fluorescence assay, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and UV-visible spectroscopy, we investigated Meta II decay in native rod disk membranes. Up to 40% of Meta III is formed without changes in the intrinsic Trp fluorescence and thus without all-trans-retinal release. NADPH, a cofactor for the reduction of all-trans-retinal to all-trans-retinol, does not accelerate Meta II decay nor does it change the amount of Meta III formed. However, Meta III can be photoconverted back to the Meta II signaling state. The data are described by two quasi-irreversible pathways, leading in parallel into Meta III or into release of all-trans-retinal. Therefore, Meta III could be a form of rhodopsin that is storaged away, thus regulating photoreceptor regeneration.

Therefore, Meta III could be a form of rhodopsin that is storaged away, thus regulating photoreceptor regeneration. metarhodopsin Fourier transform infrared G-protein of the rod, transducin Gtα(340−350)-high affinity analog N-retinylidene opsin 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid Phototransduction in vertebrate rods starts with the isomerization of the 11-cis-retinal bound to opsin and the formation of the active photoproduct, metarhodopsin (Meta)1 II. In Meta II, the Schiff base linkage between the all-trans-retinal and Lys296 is still intact but deprotonated. Catalytic activation of the G-protein, Gt or transducin, leads to a biochemical cascade of reactions, termed phototransduction. These reactions culminate in the hyperpolarization of the photoreceptor cells and ultimately in changes in the rate of neurotransmitter release at the synaptic terminus. The signaling state of Meta II is quenched rapidly by the action of rhodopsin kinase and arrestin. Equally important for vision is the metabolic cycle, which enables the visual system to take away the photolyzed chromophore, all-trans-retinal, and replace it with 11-cis-retinal, thus regenerating the pigment. The decay of Meta II thus provides an interlink among transduction, the quenching by phosphorylation and capping with arrestin, and regeneration (reviewed in Ref. 1McBee J.K. Palczewski K. Baehr W. Pepperberg D.R. Prog. Retin. Eye Res. 2001; 20: 469-529Google Scholar). During the decay of Meta II, the Schiff base linkage between the all-trans-retinal and the opsin apoprotein (Lys296) is hydrolyzed. A side product is the bright orange (λmax ∼ 470 nm) Meta III, which slowly replaces the pale yellow color of the Meta II product (λmax = 380 nm). Although it is not clear whether Meta III represents one homogeneous species, one may define it as the late product in which the chromophore is still bound to its original binding site. In the isolated retina and in intact rod outer segment preparations, Meta III eventually decays into all-trans-retinal and opsin (2Ebrey T.G. Vision Res. 1968; 8: 965-982Google Scholar, 3Baumann C.

Compared with Meta II, opsin and Meta III adopt a more rhodopsin-like conformation (6Klinger A.L. Braiman M.S. Biophys. J. 1992; 63: 1244-1255Google Scholar, 7Rothschild K.J. Gillespie J. DeGrip W.J. Biophys. J. 1987; 51: 345-350Google Scholar) and are either inactive or marginally active toward the G-protein. In the native system of mice, there is evidence that all-trans-retinal can accumulate (8Saari J.C. Garwin G.G. Van Hooser J.P. Palczewski K. Vision Res. 1998; 38: 1325-1333Google Scholar), although the nature of the product between the photoisomerized chromophore and opsin has not been elucidated. In vivo, the decay of the Meta species is the first step in the retinoid cycle, and all-trans-retinal is released from opsin directly to either the cytoplasmic surface or to the intradiskal side, from where it is flipped to the cytoplasm (9Weng J. Mata N.L. Azarian S.M. Tzekov R.T. Birch D.G. Travis G.H. Cell. 1999; 98: 13-23Google Scholar). Next, all-trans-retinal is reduced to all-trans-retinol by a dehydrogenase (reviewed in Ref. 1McBee J.K. Palczewski K. Baehr W. Pepperberg D.R. Prog. Retin. Eye Res. 2001; 20: 469-529Google Scholar). Moreover, all proteins that interact with photoactivated rhodopsin (e.g. Gt, rhodopsin kinase, and arrestin) are expected to inhibit the decay reaction (10Bornancin F. Pfister C. Chabre M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 184: 687-698Google Scholar, 11Hofmann K.P. Pulvermüller A. Buczylko J. Van Hooser P. Palczewski K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15701-15706Google Scholar, 12Palczewski K. Jäger S.

Saari J.C. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 12012-12019Google Scholar). In addition to Meta II, three distinct signaling states are described in the literature. First, retinal-free opsin has a measurable activityin vitro on the order of 10−6 that of Meta II (14Melia T.J.J. Cowan C.W. Angleson J.K. Wensel T.G. Biophys. J. 1997; 73: 3182-3191Google Scholar); at very low pH, opsin changes its conformation toward an active state (15Vogel R. Siebert F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38487-38493Google Scholar). Second, a signaling state is achieved by formation of a reversible Schiff base between all-trans-retinal and peripheral lysine group(s) of opsin, leading (preferentially at pH > 8.0) to reversible pseudo-photoproducts (11Hofmann K.P. Pulvermüller A. Buczylko J. Van Hooser P. Palczewski K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15701-15706Google Scholar, 16Jäger S. Palczewski K. Hofmann K.P. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2901-2908Google Scholar). These products interact with arrestin and rhodopsin kinase, but an interaction of these products with Gt was not measured. Finally, a non-covalent opsin/all-trans-retinal complex can form between opsin and all-trans-retinal (16Jäger S. Palczewski K. Hofmann K.P. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2901-2908Google Scholar, 17Fukada Y. Yoshizawa T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1981; 675: 195-200Google Scholar, 18Cohen G.B. Oprian D.D. Robinson P.R.

Chem. 2000; 275: 6189-6194Google Scholar). It has a substantial activity toward the G-protein, three to four orders of magnitude higher than the empty apoprotein. In this complex, the binding site for the all-trans-retinal appears to be different from that of Meta II (16Jäger S. Palczewski K. Hofmann K.P. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2901-2908Google Scholar, 20Sachs K. Maretzki D. Meyer C.K. Hofmann K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6189-6194Google Scholar). Fundamental questions about the nature of the decay process of Meta II still remain unanswered. For example, what are the intermediates in this process from Meta II to free opsin and all-trans-retinal? How active are they toward G-protein? Which products determine the sensitivity of the cell during dark adaptation and under conditions of constant illumination? What role does Meta III play in this process? How and when does arrestin dissociate from the active rhodopsin? In this study we have investigated whether a post-Meta II photoproduct with the properties of Meta III does indeed exist. To understand how the photolyzed chromophore is handled during Meta II decay and regeneration, it is indispensable to know whether it remains bound to its original binding site in a large fraction of the receptor population. Recent accounts of the vast existing literature on the topic come to the conclusion that during the decay of Meta II into the 470-nm absorbing species, the retinal is released from its original binding pocket (21DeGrip W.J. Rothschild K.J. Stavenga D.G. DeGrip W.J. Pugh E.N., Jr. Molecular Mechanism in Visual Transduction. Elsevier Science Publishers B.V., Amsterdam2000: 1-54Google Scholar). Using an intrinsic fluorescence assay to measure chromophore release, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy to study changes in the rhodopsin structure, and UV-visible spectroscopy to monitor formation of spectrally distinct species, we are now able to address the problem on a new experimental basis. Dissection of the rather complex network of decay, regeneration, and storage likely requires kinetic analyses of the conversions (22Hofmann K.P. Emeis D. Schnetkamp P.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 725: 60-70Google Scholar, 23Lewis J.W. van Kuijk F.J. Carruthers J.A. Kliger D.S. Vision Res. 1997; 37: 1-8Google Scholar, 24Szundi I. Lewis J.W. van Kuijk F.J. Kliger D.S. Vision Res. 2000; 40: 3039-3048Google Scholar). An appropriate biochemical system is a preparation of isolated disk membranes, which provides the correct lipid host, an important determinant of the formation and decay of Meta II (for review see Ref.25Hofmann K.P. Stavenga D.G. DeGrip W.J. Pugh E.N., Jr. Molecular Mechanism in Visual Transduction. Elsevier Science Publishers B.V., Amsterdam2000: 91-142Google Scholar). This measuring system is simplified by the lack of the metabolic machinery of regeneration, preventing complications from these processes on the kinetics of the decay reaction. We will present direct evidence on the formation of a stable Meta III photoproduct and propose a role for this form of rhodopsin in physiological conditions. Gtα(340−350)-high affinity analog-peptide (Gtα-HAA), VLEDLKSCGLF (26Martin E.L. Rens Domiano S. Schatz P.J. Hamm H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 361-366Google Scholar), was synthesized by Dr. Peter Henklein (Humboldt University). 11-cis-retinal was a generous gift from Rosalie Crouch and NEI, National Institutes of Health; the concentration was determined at 380 nm using ε = 24.400m−1cm−1. Isotonic buffer contains 130 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, and 20 mm bis-tris-propane adjusted to pH 7.5, if not otherwise noted. Phosphate buffer contains 50 mm potassium phosphate, 80 mm NaCl, and 1 mm MgCl2, pH 6.5. Rod outer segments were prepared from frozen bovine retinas obtained from a local slaughterhouse by means of a discontinuous sucrose gradient method (27Papermaster D.S. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 81: 48-52Google Scholar). Isolated disk membranes were prepared by repeated extraction of rod outer segments with low ionic strength buffer (5 mmPipes, pH 7.0, 1 mm EDTA) as described previously (28Kühn H. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 81: 556-564Google Scholar). Rhodopsin concentration was determined from its absorption at 500 nm using ε = 40.600 m−1cm−1(29Wald G. Brown P.K. J. Gen. Physiol. 1953; 37: 189-200Google Scholar). Opsin membranes were prepared by retinal extraction with bovine serum albumin (fatty acid-free) and hydroxylamine using illuminated disk membranes as described previously (20Sachs K. Maretzki D. Meyer C.K. Hofmann K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6189-6194Google Scholar, 30Sachs K. Maretzki D. Hofmann K.P. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 315: 238-251Google Scholar). Opsin concentration was determined from its absorption at 280 nm using ε = 81.200m−1 cm−1 (19Surya A. Foster K.W. Knox B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5024-5031Google Scholar). All membrane suspensions were stored at −80 °C in isotonic buffer containing 0.3m sucrose. Membrane suspensions were sonicated briefly prior to the fluorescence and UV-visible measurements to reduce turbidity. All measurements were performed in isotonic buffer adjusted to the chosen pH values. To follow the decay of Meta II the reaction was started by complete bleaching of the membrane suspensions with a 150-watt fiber optic light source filtered through a heat filter (Schott KG2) and a 495-nm long pass filter. Samples were illuminated (15 s) at pH 6 and 20 °C, i.e. at conditions favoring Meta II (31Parkes J.H. Liebman P.A. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 5054-5061Google Scholar). In agreement with a previous study (23Lewis J.W. van Kuijk F.J. Carruthers J.A. Kliger D.S. Vision Res. 1997; 37: 1-8Google Scholar) we found formation of isorhodopsin (9-cis-retinal form of rhodopsin) even during 15 s of illumination under conditions with significant content of Meta I in the equilibrium (alkaline pH and/or low temperatures) (data not shown). The given pH values of the samples were adjusted rapidly in the dark immediately after the photoactivation. The fluorescence assay of illuminated rhodopsin is based on the relief from the quenching of opsin Trp fluorescence exerted by the retinal ligand bound in its pocket (32Farrens D.L. Khorana H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5073-5076Google Scholar). The assay was applied to study the Meta II decay in isolated disk membranes. Measurements were performed on a SPEX Fluorolog 1680 instrument. Low light intensities were used to prevent photolysis of rhodopsin. Slit settings for the fluorometer were 0.2 nm for excitation (at 295 nm) and 4 nm for emission. Emission spectra were recorded between 310 and 400 nm. For the kinetic studies, data were recorded at 330 nm. The measurements were done in stirred membrane suspensions (750 μl, 1 μm rhodopsin). Control experiments were done with closed shutter during decay to exclude an effect of the excitation light on the decay reaction (data not shown). Reaction rates were determined by a single exponential fit of the data. Absorbance spectra (see Fig. 7) were acquired with a Cary 50 spectrophotometer (Varian). Suspensions of isolated disk membranes (100 μl, 5 μm rhodopsin) were used in temperature-controlled microcuvettes (1-cm path length). Opsin membranes that closely matched the light scattering properties of isolated disk membranes were used as a reference. Regeneration of opsin during decay of Meta II (see Fig. 5) was followed by recording difference spectra at pH 7.5 and 33 °C within 15 min on a Hewlett-Packard HP 8452 diode array spectrophotometer using 1-ml cuvettes equipped with a stirrer. 11-cis-retinal (4.3 μm) was added immediately after illumination, and pH adjustment (see above) of the membrane suspension (4.3 μmrhodopsin) and absorbance was set to zero. Retinylidene Schiff base content in disk membrane samples was estimated from the formation of the 440-nm product after acidification to pH 1.9 with 1n HCl and solubilization of the membranes in detergent (1% dodecyl-β-maltoside). FTIR samples were prepared using a centrifugation method as described (33Bartl F. Ritter E. Hofmann K.P. FEBS Lett. 2000; 473: 259-264Google Scholar). In ∼40 μl of washed membranes (0.3 mm rhodopsin), the pH was adjusted by a few microliters of diluted NaOH or HCl. Subsequently the suspension was centrifuged for 20 min at 80,000 × g, yielding a pellet containing 2.3 mm rhodopsin (calculated from absorption at 500 nm). The buffer solution was removed, and the pellet was transferred to a 30-mm diameter transmission cell with two BaF2 windows and a 3-μm Teflon spacer. After equilibration for 1 h at 23 °C, a set of 256 transmission spectra was recorded. After illumination with a 150-watt fiber optic light source filtered through a heat filter (Schott KG2) and a 495-nm-long pass filter a second set of spectra was recorded. From these two sets of spectra the Meta II minus rhodopsin difference spectrum was generated (we use the convention that the spectra of the conversion A → B are calculated as B − A and termed B − A difference spectrum). The sample was then allowed to decay for 2 h at pH 5.9 and 7.5. The decay was followed by recording sets of spectra every 2 min after the first illumination. After 2 h, final spectra of the decay product were taken, and the sample was illuminated with green light (495 nm) for 30 s. Subtraction of the decay product spectra (“after” minus “before” illumination) yielded the Meta II minus Meta III FTIR difference spectrum. To measure the release of all-trans-retinal from photoactivated rhodopsin, we have adapted the intrinsic Trp fluorescence assay (34Kropf A. Vision Res. 1967; 7: 811-818Google Scholar, 35Ebrey T.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1971; 68: 713-716Google Scholar), which was later established by Farrens and Khorana (32Farrens D.L. Khorana H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5073-5076Google Scholar) as a means of monitoring all-trans-retinal release from solubilized rhodopsin. The data in Fig. 1 show that a similar change in Trp fluorescence of opsin can be measured in native isolated rod disk membranes. In the lipid bilayer, within milliseconds of light activation, rhodopsin reaches an equilibrium of Meta I and Meta II tautomers. All subsequent conversions start from the pool of Meta intermediates, which we will term Meta I/II. The fluorescence increased concurrently with a decrease in Schiff base concentration, as measured at 440 nm after acid denaturation. This indicates that it is indeed the release of the chromophore that gives rise to the fluorescence change (32Farrens D.L. Khorana H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5073-5076Google Scholar). Under these conditions the absorbance decrease leveled out at ∼25% of the starting absorbance, which is because of the presence of other all-trans-retinal Schiff bases formed with peripheral residues other than Lys296(N-retinylidene opsin, NRO). The fluorescence spectra taken in the dark (rhodopsin), after illumination for 15 s (Meta I/II), and after complete decay of Meta I/II are shown in Fig 1 B. The strong quenching of Trp fluorescence exerted by the all-trans-retinal bound in its pocket persists with only minor change immediately after illumination. This is interesting in light of the proposed flip of the β-ionone ring out of its location in the ground state (see “Discussion”). After complete decay of Meta I/II, the fluorescence of the resulting opsin is twice as large, as compared with the initial Meta II (the dominant species at pH 6.5). As expected, the time course of the decay reaction depends strongly on temperature (Fig. 2 A). The Arrhenius plot of the rate constants yields 16.0 kcal/mol as the activation energy of the decay reaction (Fig. 2 B), similar to the 20.2 kcal/mol obtained with rhodopsin solubilized in dodecyl-β-maltoside (32Farrens D.L. Khorana H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5073-5076Google Scholar). The results validate the rhodopsin fluorescence assay of all-trans-retinal release in membrane-bound rhodopsin (Fig. 1 A). Both the kinetics and the final level of the change of fluorescence during Meta I/II decay depend significantly on pH (Fig. 3 A). With increasing pH, the reaction becomes slightly faster (Fig. 3 D), with a half-time of ∼600 s at pH 6.0 and ∼400 s above pH 8.0 (20 °C). The maximum amplitude of the signal is reduced by a factor of 2 over the range of pH tested (Fig. 3 C). To distinguish between the pH dependences of the actual decay reactions and of the fluorescence monitor, the decay was analyzed in the presence of Gtα-HAA. This peptide binds to the Meta II conformation (26Martin E.L. Rens Domiano S. Schatz P.J. Hamm H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 361-366Google Scholar, 36Kisselev O.G. Meyer C.K. Heck M. Ernst O.P. Hofmann K.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4898-4903Google Scholar). The Gtα-HAA strongly reduces the pH dependence of the fluorescence change (Fig. 3, B and C). Because of the fact that Meta II decays quantitatively to opsin in the presence of the peptide (see below), the residual pH dependence is likely reflecting the pH effect on Trp fluorescence. The difference between the fluorescence changes with and without Gtα-HAA yields the relative fraction of a photoproduct in which the Trp fluorescence is quenched persistently. From the resulting curve, shown in the inset of Fig. 3 C, it can be estimated that this photoproduct is formed with an apparent pKaof 7.0. Under the conditions of the experiments, its maximum fraction is 33% of the initially bleached rhodopsin. Anticipating the results described below, this photoproduct contains all-trans-retinal bound via a protonated Schiff base to Lys296 and is here defined as Meta III. Similar results were obtained at 33 °C (insets in Fig. 3,A and B), except the decay is faster (half-time of ∼130 s), and the maximum fraction of Meta III formed is slightly smaller. However, even at 33 °C, no significant loss of Meta III is seen within 30 min, as reflected in the stable level of fluorescence. Interestingly, the Meta II/Gtα-HAA complex decays above pH 6.0 in a pH-independent manner, with a half-time of 620 ± 17 (S.E.) s (20 °C). A similar rate is found for the Meta I/II decay without the peptide between pH 6.0 and 6.5. Although the peptide mimics the effect of Gt on Meta II stabilization, it does not significantly influence the fluorescence change and, hence, hydrolysis of the Schiff base and loss of the chromophore from the binding pocket (see “Discussion”). Using the fluorescence assay, we also studied the influence of NADPH on the Meta I/II decay to opsin and Meta III. Addition of NADPH, the cofactor of an endogenous all-trans-retinol dehydrogenase, results in reduction of all-trans-retinal to all-trans-retinol (see Fig. 5, B andC). As seen in Fig. 4, neither the time course nor the final level of the fluorescence change are influenced by NADPH. Under the conditions of the experiments (pH 7.5, 20 °C), a significant fraction of Meta III is formed that is seen directly in the larger fluorescence increase in the presence of Gtα-HAA-peptide (see Figs. 3 and 4). The lack of any additional opsin formation in the presence of NADPH indicates a (quasi-)irreversible formation of Meta III. To probe the accessibility of the retinal binding pocket in the decay products, regeneration with 11-cis-retinal during Meta I/II decay was followed by UV-visible difference spectroscopy (Fig. 5, A-C). The records reflect an increase in absorbance around 500 nm and a parallel decrease around 380 nm, consistent with the formation of rhodopsin at the expense of free 11-cis-retinal. In the control membranes (Fig. 5 A), the absorption maximum of rhodopsin is apparently blue-shifted because of the contribution of other photoproducts with similar absorption. These include Meta III, as defined above, and protonated Schiff bases (e.g. NRO; see “Discussion”), which prevent a quantitative evaluation of the spectra. However, despite the complexity of the decay reactions the spectra maintain an isosbestic point. This implies that the species involved exhibit only two distinct spectra. This condition is met when all conversions occur with the same apparent rate (see “Discussion”). In Fig. 5, B and C the influence of NADPH and Gtα-HAA-peptide on Meta I/II decay and opsin regeneration, respectively, is shown. Reduction of all-trans-retinal by endogenous all-trans-retinol dehydrogenase is seen directly as an increase in absorbance at 320 nm (all-trans-retinol formation). The loss of an isosbestic point in these spectra indicates that the additional reaction introduced, namely the reduction of all-trans-retinal after its release from photoactivated rhodopsin, becomes kinetically visible. This is readily explained by a transient accumulation of free all-trans-retinal and/or its complexes with opsin (all-trans-retinal/opsin and NRO). Eventually, the pool of released all-trans-retinal is reduced, which is seen as a further decrease in absorbance at 380 nm (all-trans-retinal/opsin). In addition, the absorption shifts toward 500 nm in the late spectra, indicating complete removal of transiently formed NRO. Consistent with the results obtained above (see Figs. 3 and 4), more all-trans-retinal is released and eventually reduced in the presence of Gtα-HAA-peptide, which makes opsin available that would have otherwise escaped into the Meta III storage (further decrease in 380 nm absorption). Any additional absorption change in the 470–500-nm range is masked by a simultaneous loss of Meta III, but a final shift toward 500 nm is evident (Fig. 5 C). Meta I/II decay was also followed using FTIR difference spectroscopy. The first record in Fig. 6, A andB is the Meta II minus rhodopsin difference spectrum (see “Experimental Procedures”). At pH 7.5 and 23 °C, the Meta I/Meta II equilibrium is to 70% and at pH 5.9 and 23 °C, to more than 90% on the Meta II side. Thus, the spectra are dominated by typical Meta II features, including bands at 1768 cm−1 and 1745 cm−1 (indicating a change in hydrogen bonding of Asp83 and Glu122) and 1713 cm−1(indicating the protonation of the Schiff base counterion, Glu113). At both pH 7.5 (Fig. 6 A) and pH 5.9 (Fig. 6 B), the decay is virtually complete after 32 min, as indicated by the absence of the Meta II features. This difference spectrum represents a mixture of the opsin/all-trans-retinal minus rhodopsin and Meta III minus rhodopsin difference spectra (see “Experimental Procedures”). There is a weakly expressed feature that arises specifically at pH > 6.0, namely the positive band at 1348 cm−1, which was recently assigned to Meta III formation (37Bartl F.J. Ritter E. Hofmann K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30161-30166Google Scholar). When the sample is illuminated after 2 h of decay, a Meta II minus Meta III difference spectrum can be recorded. This spectrum shows the Meta III band at 1348 cm−1 with negative polarity and the features around 1700 to 1750 cm−1 with positive polarity, indicating the formation of Meta II (or Meta II-like product in terms of protein conformation) (Fig. 6 A), as described previously (37Bartl F.J. Ritter E. Hofmann K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30161-30166Google Scholar). This identifies Meta III as the only decay product that can be converted by light to the active species Meta II. In contrast to the observation at pH 7.5, no photolysis products are seen at pH 5.9, in conditions when virtually no Meta III is present (Fig. 6 B). This observation further supports the existence of Meta III as a decay product. This species is the major (or even the only) decay product that undergoes photoreversal to Meta II. UV-visible spectroscopic data on the formation and decay of Meta I/II are shown in Fig. 7. Illumination of rhodopsin at pH 6.0 and 20 °C results in an almost quantitative formation of Meta II (Fig. 7 A, traces a and b). After adjusting the same sample to pH 8.0 (to avoid photoconversion of Meta I to isorhodopsin; see “Experimental Procedures”), Meta I is formed rapidly at the expense of Meta II (Fig. 7 A, trace c). The subsequent decay of Meta I/II results in only minor spectral changes (Fig. 7 A,traces c-f) because of the spectral overlap between reactants and products. Species in the 360–380-nm range include Meta II, free all-trans-retinal, and opsin/all-trans-retinal complex with unprotonated Schiff base. In the 460–480-nm range are Meta I, Meta III, and all other protonated Schiff bases (reviewed in Ref. 25Hofmann K.P. Stavenga D.G. DeGrip W.J. Pugh E.N., Jr. Molecular Mechanism in Visual Transduction. Elsevier Science Publishers B.V., Amsterdam2000: 91-142Google Scholar). The overall time course of the decay products can be followed from the spectral changes (Fig. 7 A), yielding the same common rate for all conversions, as was seen in the fluorescence and FTIR experiments described above. Meta III can be identified spectrally using its photoconvertibility to Meta II (see Fig. 6 A). The experiment starts with the completely decayed sample (Fig. 7 A, trace f). Addition of Gtα-HAA-peptide yields trace a in Fig. 7 B; it coincides with trace f in Fig. 7 A apart from a small dilution effect. Subsequent illumination results in a spectrum (Fig. 7 B, trace b) that is very similar to the spectrum obtained from an aliquot that had decayed in the presence of Gtα-HAA (Fig. 7 B, trace c). The experiment confirms that the peptide blocks formation of Meta III. The visual process in the vertebrate retina depends not only on the signal transduction machinery in rods and cones and on neuronal process"
https://openalex.org/W1969972660,"A-Kinase anchor proteins (AKAPs) immobilize and concentrate protein kinase A (PKA) isoforms at specific subcellular compartments. Intracellular targeting of PKA holoenzyme elicits rapid and efficient phosphorylation of target proteins, thereby increasing sensitivity of downstream effectors to cAMP action. AKAP121 targets PKA to the cytoplasmic surface of mitochondria. Here we show that conditional expression of AKAP121 in PC12 cells selectively enhances cAMP.PKA signaling to mitochondria. AKAP121 induction stimulates PKA-dependent phosphorylation of the proapoptotic protein BAD at Ser(155), inhibits release of cytochrome c from mitochondria, and protects cells from apoptosis. An AKAP121 derivative mutant that localizes on mitochondria but does not bind PKA down-regulates PKA signaling to the mitochondria and promotes apoptosis. These findings indicate that PKA anchored by AKAP121 transduces cAMP signals to the mitochondria, and it may play an important role in mitochondrial physiology."

Ezrin, radixin, and moesin are found in vertebrates as highly similar paralogs (∼75% sequence identity) that differ in their primary tissue distributions but probably have a large degree of functional equivalence. In addition to binding to actin filaments and membrane proteins like CD44 (8Tsukita S. Oishi K. Sato N. Sagara J. Kawai A. Tsukita S. J. Biol.

At least some of these various binding activities are regulated by a masking/unmasking phenomenon (14Gary R. Bretscher A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 1061-1075Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar), and it is becoming apparent that such a mechanism is a theme common to many cytoskeletal proteins such as vinculin (15Johnson R.P.

Our structural and functional studies of the ERM proteins are aimed at elucidating the details of this type of regulation. The ∼65-kDa ERM proteins consist of three functional domains: an amino-terminal 300-residue FERM domain (band four-point one,ezrin, radixin, moesin homology domains) that is responsible for binding to membrane proteins and many signaling proteins (reviewed in Ref. 7Bretscher A. Edwards K. Fehon R.G. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 586-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (1137) Google Scholar), a central 200-residue putative coiled-coil region that when phosphorylated on Tyr-353 contributes to an interaction with p85 (10Gautreau A. Poullet P. Louvard D. Arpin M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7300-7305Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar), and a carboxyl-terminal 100-residue auto-inhibitory carboxyl-terminal tail domain (also known as the C-ERMAD) that contains the F-actin binding site (19Turunen O. Wahlstrom T. Vaheri A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 1145-1453Crossref Scopus (348) Google Scholar, 14Gary R. Bretscher A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 1061-1075Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). In resting cells, ERM proteins are in a dormant state characterized by an intramolecular association of the FERM and tail domains. This dormant state has no known binding partners except perhaps the regulatory subunit of protein kinase-A (20Dransfield D.T. Bradford A.J. Smith J. Martin M. Roy C. Mangeat P.H. Goldenring J.R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 35-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar), although additional partners cannot be ruled out. One pathway of activation (i.e. release of the FERM-tail interaction) of the ERM proteins appears to be triggered by phosphorylation of a specific threonine in the tail domain (Thr-558 in moesin) by the Rho-associated kinase (21Matsui T.

Our structural understanding of ERM function was given a solid foundation with the determination of the crystal structure for a dormant moesin FERM-tail complex (26Pearson M.A. Reczek D. Bretscher A. Karplus P.A. Cell. 2000; 101: 259-270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). It revealed that the FERM domain is a clover-shaped molecule consisting of three structural domains (lobes F1, F2, and F3). Residues 2–82 (lobe F1) possess a ubiquitin-like fold, residues 83–195 (lobe F2) fold into a topology like that of acyl-CoA-binding protein (27Kragelund B.B. Andersen K.V. Madsen J.C. Knudsen J. Poulsen F.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 230: 1260-1277Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), and residues 196–297 (lobe F3) adopt the pleckstrin homology/phosphotyrosine binding fold found in a broad range of signaling molecules, including dynamin, Sos, and Shc (28Ferguson K.M. Lemmon M.A. Schlessinger J. Sigler P.B. Cell. 1994; 79: 199-209Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar, 29Soisson S.M. Nimnual A.S. Uy M. Bar-Sagi D. Kuriyan J.

In the dormant molecule, the carboxyl-terminal tail binds as an extended peptide covering a large surface of lobes F2 and F3 of the FERM domain. It was speculated that the tail domain could cause dormancy by either directly blocking partner protein-binding sites and/or by inducing conformational changes in the FERM domain that alter (and inactivate) binding sites (26Pearson M.A. Reczek D. Bretscher A. Karplus P.A. Cell. 2000; 101: 259-270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar).

EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4449-4462Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar) and of moesin (32Edwards S.D. Keep N.H. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 7061-7068Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) have given some insight into the structural aspects of activation. The structures of unmasked radixin with or without IP3 (2.8 Å resolution) were highly similar to each other, and comparison to dormant moesin showed local changes in three regions, 138–150, 160–178, and 243–280. The structure of activated moesin (2.7 Å resolution) also revealed shifts in these three regions (32Edwards S.D. Keep N.H. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 7061-7068Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). However, the moesin analysis was complicated by crystal packing interactions that caused large shifts in lobes F1 and -3 and concluded that consistent shifts due to activation were limited to residues 166–170 and 260–264. Here we present the 2.3 Å resolution crystal structure of the activated FERM domain of ezrin. This represents the first structure for the protein ezrin. Combining this structure with the other two active ERM structures gives us an enhanced ability to identify those structural changes that are due to activation as opposed to sequence differences or crystal packing interactions. Moreover, we go on to document that mobility changes are an important aspect of activation that has not been previously described. Furthermore, our analysis of the active (radixin, moesin, and ezrin) and the dormant (moesin) ERM structures reveals that the tail domain contributes residues that allow the FERM domain to complete its folding, a concept that we refer to as keystone interactions. The crystallization of and data collection for the FERM domain of human ezrin (residues 1–297) have been described previously (33Smith W.J. Cerione R.A. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. D. 2002; 58: 1359-1361Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Briefly, the crystals were grown by the hanging drop method using a reservoir solution containing 10–15% (w/v) monomethyl-ether PEG 2000 (Fluka), 15% glycerol (w/v), 10% 2-propanol (w/v), 0.1 m Na-Hepes, (pH 8.1), and they belong to the space group P21 with cell constants a = 48.5 Å, b = 112.8 Å, c = 66.3 Å, β = 102.3. Two molecules occupy the asymmetric unit. The diffraction data were collected at −150 °C at the Cornell High Energy Synchrotron Source (CHESS) and processed with the MOSFLM and SCALA programs (CCP4, 1994).

Using a 10.0 to 4.0 Å resolution range, the heights of solutions (the next highest scores in parentheses) for the rotation and translation function were 0.23 (0.07) and 0.22 (0.09), respectively. The crystallographic R-factor was 30.1% after rigid body refinement using data from 25 to 2.3 Å. At this stage the 2Fo−Fc electron density was of sufficient quality to guide the construction of the ezrin FERM molecule using the program O (35Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13014) Google Scholar). Refinement using amplitudes as the maximum likelihood target involved manual rebuilding, simulated annealing, and conjugated gradient minimization without NCS restraints. An overall anisotropic B-factor correction with a low resolution cutoff of 6 Å yielded B11 = 15 Å2, B22 = −22 Å2, B33 = 6 Å2, and B13 = 8 Å2. Waters were placed initially using the CNS water pick program and later by manual inspection. Simulated annealing omit maps were also used occasionally to check the quality of the model. The final model includes 2 chains of ezrin (A and B), each with residues 2–297 of ezrin, and water molecules. The crystallographic R-factor is 22.3%, and R-free is 27.6% (Table I). Unusual geometries in well ordered regions of the structure includecis-prolines at residues 75 and 297. Because of weak side chain electron density, residues Ser-148, Arg-151, and Lys-162 were modeled as alanine in both molecules in the asymmetric unit. FERM domain structures used for comparison included ezrin chains A and B (from this work), radixin (PDB code 1GE7), radixin bound to IP3 (PDB code 1GE6), moesin (PDB 1E5W), and the dormant moesin bound to the carboxyl-terminal tail domain (PDB code 1EF1). Overlays were accomplished using the programs LSQMAN (36Kleywegt G.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. D. 2000; 56: 249-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar) and DOMOV (37Lu G. Protein Data Bank Quarterly Newsletter. 1996; 78: 10-11Google Scholar). The overlays reveal that cis-Pro-75 is modeled as a trans-Pro in the radixin structures; we suspect that this is an error and note that it has not influenced our analyses. Crystals of the FERM domain (residues 1–297) of ezrin diffract to 2.3 Å and have two molecules in the asymmetric unit. The structure was solved by molecular replacement, and refinement has led to a model that consists of residues 2 to 297 for each of two chains and 314 water molecules (Table I). The two molecules in the asymmetric unit A and B are in approximately equivalent environments because the non-crystallographic symmetry is nearly a perfect centering operation. Consistent with this, molecules A and B are very similar with a root mean square deviation of Cα-atoms of 0.4 Å, and all descriptions will refer to molecule A unless specifically noted. The FERM domain is a clover-shaped molecule (Fig. 1 A) consisting of three distinct lobes and is globally similar to structures reported previously for ERM proteins (26Pearson M.A. Reczek D.

Mohandas N. Jap B.K. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 871-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). This basic structure has already been well described and will not be elaborated here. In contrast, the mobility properties of the FERM domain have not yet been described, although such information is available from protein crystallography in the form of atomic B-factors (also known as temperature factors). Knowledge of mobility along the chain in the activated and dormant structures is likely to provide insight into the mechanism of activation. We first examine the mobility properties in each of the published FERM domains, and then in the next section we compare them to those of dormant moesin to gain insight into the activation process. B-factors are related to the amplitude of motion of the atoms so that in the absence of large model errors, higher B-factors indicate a higher disorder of the atom in question (41Sternberg M.J. Grace D.E. Phillips D.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1979; 130: 231-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). As seen visually in Fig. 1 A and graphically in Fig. 1 B, the B-factors along the chain of ezrin vary in a complex manner. In particular, local peaks in mobility are mostly associated with loops between secondary structural elements and termini (42Karplus P.A. Schulz G.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 195: 701-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). Lobe F1 behaves as a rather tight unit, with relatively small deviations from the mean B-factor, whereas lobes F2 and F3 appear less cohesive, having higher average mobility (Fig. 5) and exhibiting some regions with very high mobilities. These occur near residues 140 in lobe F2 and residues 210 and 260 in lobe F3. In each of these three cases, the loops are not well tethered to the core of the lobe, and the sequences have a high proportion of polar residues. Most of the mobility features are common among the three activated ERM protein structures (Fig. 1 B). Notable differences are limited: ezrin is less mobile near residue 230, radixin is less mobile near residue 260, and moesin is more mobile near residue 160. The first two cases may be explained by crystal contacts because ezrin residue 230 packs against residue 52 of a symmetry mate, and the loop near residue 260 in radixin packs against residues 116 and 234 from a symmetry mate. In the third case, the high B-factors of moesin do not correlate with a packing interaction or a unique sequence feature. However, such a sharp spike in a B-factor plot is sometimes caused by a model error (43Jensen L.H. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 353-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), which is plausible in this case because it is a mobile region in a medium resolution (2.7 Å) structure, and three residues have rare φ,ψ-angles, (−72,−169) for Leu-158, (77,−19) for Glu-159, and (−147,28) for Lys-161. To best define the conformational and mobility changes that are associated with activation, we have compared the six FERM domain structures available for ERM proteins: dormant moesin, activated radixin, the activated radixin-IP3 complex, activated moesin, and molecules A and B of activated ezrin presented here. These make a total of five activated and one dormant molecule. The pair of radixin structures are very similar, as are the pair of ezrin structures; indeed, they are not truly independent from one another because they are in equivalent crystallographic environments. Thus, the radixin-IP3 complex and ezrin molecule B are left out of the systematic analyses because they do not add significant new information. Both visual (Fig. 2) and quantitative (Fig. 3 A) analyses of mobile regions of all of the activated structures with the dormant moesin structure reveal that the activated ezrin and radixin structures cluster together but that the activated moesin structure has large differences in lobes F1 and F3. These differences are a result of a movement of moesin lobes F1 and F3 toward each other. This movement has been ascribed to a crystal packing effect (32Edwards S.D. Keep N.H. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 7061-7068Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) so that the activated moesin structure is less reliable for defining movements associated with activation. Combining information from the ezrin- and radixin-activated structures allows us to locate regions where the pair deviate more from the dormant structure than from each other. This provides a striking delineation of residues that move significantly upon activation (Fig. 3 B). The regions implicated are major shifts of residues 130–150, 155–180, and 240–270 and small but significant shifts near residues 70 and 210. The larger shifts are similar to those identified by Hamada et al. (31Hamada K. Shimizu T. Matsui T. Tsukita S. Hakoshima T. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4449-4462Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar) in their study of the FERM domain of activated radixin, but the smaller shifts have not been noted before.Figure 3Quantitation of the structural shifts associated with activation. A, C-α root mean square deviation of each activated FERM domain compared with the dormant moesin domain. Ezrin (red), radixin (cyan), and moesin (green). The ezrin and radixin plots are highly similar, but the moesin plot has many large unique features. B, the average mobility differences between two activated structures (ezrin and radixin, violet) compared with the average mobility between activated and dormant structures (activated ezrin/dormant moesin and activated radixin/dormant moesin,blue) is shown. Regions where the blue line rises above the violet line define regions that appear to have a significant conformational change upon activation. For the superimpositions used to generate panel B, residues clearly involved in significant local movements (residues 131–174 and 241–269) were removed from the calculations. Overlays were calculated using LSQMAN (36Kleywegt G.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. D. 2000; 56: 249-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To dissect conformational changes into components due to rigid lobe rotations and those that are local in nature, we calculated independent overlays for each lobe. The resulting rigid lobe rotations were very small, ranging from 0.5° to 1.5°, and the resulting plot of local shifts was virtually unchanged from Fig. 3. An unexpected benefit of this lobe-wise analysis is that treatment of the activated moesin structure in this manner removes the crystal packing affects (lobe rotations of 4–8°), so that local changes in moesin agree with those seen in ezrin and radixin (data not shown). The following three paragraphs summarize the conformational changes undergone by each lobe during activation. The rigid body movements of lobe F1 (residues 4–80) are very small, involving a rotation ranging from 0.5–0.7° for the ezrin and radixin structures. The only significant local structural change, at residues 73–75 (Fig. 3 B), involves a turn just after strand β5. This turn is far from all other changes and does not appear to be related to activation. Also, because activated moesin follows dormant moesin more closely, we suspect that this shift is due to sequence changes, because ezrin and radixin have Asn-74 and Gln-77, whereas moesin has Ser-74 and Leu-77. For lobe F2 (residues 88–199), the lobe rotation is again small, ranging from 1.2–1.5°. However, major local changes (up to 3-Å shifts) occur for residues 132–151 and 155–177 (Fig. 3 B). As seen in Fig. 4 A, these changes involve coordinated shifts of the last turn of helix B and the following loop and of all of helix C (maximal at its amino terminus). A look at side chain positions reveals some clear ways that these movements associated with activation can compensate for the removal of helix A of the carboxyl-terminal tail. The three most notable cases are the shift of Trp-175 to fill the pocket vacated by Leu-525, a flip of the side chain of Arg-171 to help fill the space vacated by Leu-529, and a shift in the side chain of Trp-168, as well as the whole of residues 160–162, to fill space vacated by residues 533 to 537 (Fig. 4 A). Residues 132–151 pack onto the backside of lobe F2 helix C, and their motion appears to be due to being pulled along by the shifting helix C. In addition to many nonspecific contacts in this core, a key side chain connecting helix C to this chain segment is the buried His-176 whose side chain hydrogen bonds to Tyr-146-OH and Gly-135-O For lobe F3, the rigid body rotation is again small, only 0.7–1.4°. Notable local changes in the conformation of lobe F3 include the small shifts of residues 211–213 and the extensive shifts of residues 240–267, which have a maximal shift of nearly 6 Å at residue 261. These movements can be described as mainly a collapsing of the β1-β2 hairpin and the β-meander subdomain (β5, -6, -7) into the space occupied by helix D of the carboxyl-terminal tail (Fig. 4 B). As with lobe F2, it is possible to describe some clear ways that these movements can be seen to compensate for the removal of helix D of the carboxyl-terminal tail. The movement of the β-meander seems tied to a shift of Phe-267 to fill the space that had been occupied by Phe-574 and so Pro-265 and Asp-266 can fill the space occupied by Ile-571. Similarly, the side chain of Lys-237 flips directions so that it fills the space occupied by Met-577. Interestingly, the change of Lys-237 seems correlated with flips of the side chains of Glu-229 and Asn-231 (Fig. 4 B). A broad comparison of the mobilities of the activated structures with those of dormant moesin reveals that the overall mobility of lobe F1 remains similar during activation, but the mobilities of lobes F2 and F3 as a whole increase significantly (Fig. 5). This results in an inversion such that the lobe F1 goes from being the least well ordered lobe to being the most well ordered lobe. The transition occurs near residue 88 (see Fig. 1 B), which is about halfway through the linker between lobes F1 and F2 (26Pearson M.A. Reczek D. Bretscher A. Karplus P.A. Cell. 2000; 101: 259-270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). Three regions have very dramatic increases in mobility; these are near residues 140, 210, and 265, mentioned above as the three regions that are highly mobile in the activated structures. For the loop near residue 140, the case is less clear that this increase in mobility is associated with activation, because these residues are not in direct contact with the carboxyl-terminal tail in the dormant structure and we do not see any structural changes that would clearly cause them to become more mobile. One plausible explanation is that these residues are actually already rather mobile in the dormant moesin structure but that a crystal packing interaction in that crystal (residues 141–149 pack against residues 560–565 in another molecule) damped their natural mobility. We conclude that residues 135–145 are very mobile in the activated FERM domain, but we must leave open the question of how much thei"

Firstly, we show a reciprocal regulation of EGR-1 and NAB2 following VEGF treatment. During the initial phase EGR-1 is rapidly induced and NAB2 levels are down-regulated. This is followed by a reduction of EGR-1 and a concomitant increase of NAB2. Secondly, using the tissue factor gene as a readout for VEGF-induced and EGR-1-regulated gene expression we demonstrate that NAB2 can completely block VEGF-induced tissue factor reporter gene activity. Thirdly, by adenovirus-mediated expression we show that NAB2 inhibits up-regulation of tissue factor, VEGF receptor-1, and urokinase plasminogen activator mRNAs even when a combination of VEGF and bFGF is used for induction. In addition, NAB2 overexpression significantly reduced tubule and sprout formation in two different in vitro angiogenesis assays and largely prevented the invasion of cells and formation of vessel-like structures in the murine Matrigel model. These data suggest that NAB2 regulation represents a mechanism to guarantee transient EGR-1 activity following exposure of endothelial cells to VEGF and that NAB2 overexpression could be used to inhibit signals involved in the early phase of angiogenesis.

Major signals induced by VEGF via VEGFR-2 in endothelial cells include activation of the phosphoinositol 3-kinase/PKB and phospholipase C-γ/PKC pathways (4Petrova T.V. Makinen T. Alitalo K. Exp.

Dejana E. Cell. 1999; 98: 147-157Google Scholar), recent in vitro studies have shown that VEGF treatment of endothelial cells leads to a PKC-dependent activation of the MEK/ERK module of MAP kinases resulting in a rapid up-regulation of the transcription factor EGR-1 (7Mechtcheriakova D.

Furthermore, EGR-1 is critically involved in the up-regulation of genes such as tissue factor (TF) (7Mechtcheriakova D. Wlachos A. Holzmüller H. Binder B.R. Hofer E. Blood. 1999; 93: 3811-3823Google Scholar, 8Mechtcheriakova D. Schabbauer G. Lucerna M. Clauss M. De Martin R. Binder B.R. Hofer E.

Science. 1996; 271: 1427-1431Google Scholar). These genes have been proposed to fulfill important functions for different aspects of vasculogenesis and angiogenesis (1Yancopoulos G.D. Davis S. Gale N.W. Rudge J.S. Wiegand S.J. Holash J. Nature. 2000; 407: 242-248Google Scholar, 2Carmeliet P. Jain R.K. Nature. 2000; 407: 249-257Google Scholar, 14Blasi F. Immunol. Today. 1997; 18: 415-417Google Scholar). Comparable to some other transactivators, EGR-1 associates with corepressor proteins that can modulate transcription of EGR-dependent genes. Two corepressors of EGR-1, NAB1 and NAB2, have been identified using yeast two-hybrid screening (15Swirnoff A.H. Apel E.D. Svaren J. Sevetson B.R. Zimonjic D.B. Popescu N.C. Milbrandt J. Mol. Cell.

These factors bind to EGR-1 by direct protein-protein interactions with a conserved R1 region found in several members of the EGR family (EGR-1, -2 and -3), thus inhibiting the transactivating potential of EGR-1. Whereas NAB1 is constitutively expressed in most tissues and appears to be a general transcriptional regulator (15Swirnoff A.H. Apel E.D. Svaren J. Sevetson B.R. Zimonjic D.B. Popescu N.C. Milbrandt J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 512-524Google Scholar), NAB2 may function as an important inducible regulator of gene expression (16Svaren J. Sevetson B.R. Apel E.D. Zimonjic D.B. Popescu N.C. Milbrandt J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3545-3553Google Scholar). Initially, the physiologic activities of NAB2 have been analyzed in nerve cells where the EGR-1-mediated differentiation process stimulated by nerve growth factor was blocked by the corepressor NAB2 (9Qu Z. Wolfraim L.A. Svaren J. Ehrengruber M.U. Davidson N. Milbrandt J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 1075-1082Google Scholar). Furthermore, an inhibition of EGR-1-dependent transcription and growth factor production in smooth muscle cells with implications for tissue repair and angiogenesis was recently reported (17Silverman E.S. Khachigian L.M. Santiago F.S. Williams A.J. Lindner V. Collins T. Am. J. Pathol. 1999; 155: 1311-1317Google Scholar, 18Houston P. Campbell C.J. Svaren J. Milbrandt J. Braddock M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 2001; 283: 480-486Google Scholar). In general, gene regulation mediated by the interplay of EGR-1 and NAB2 might be a unifying principle in different invasive processes such as neurite outgrowth, wound healing, angiogenesis, and tumor invasion (19Abdulkadir S.A. Qu Z. Garabedian E. Song S.K. Peters T.J. Svaren J. Carbone J.M. Naughton C.K. Catalona W.J. Ackerman J.J. Gordon J.I. Humphrey P.A. Milbrandt J. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 101-107Google Scholar). Based on our previous finding that the transcription factor EGR-1 is decisively involved in the up-regulation of the TF gene by VEGF in endothelial cells (7Mechtcheriakova D. Wlachos A. Holzmüller H. Binder B.R. Hofer E. Blood. 1999; 93: 3811-3823Google Scholar, 8Mechtcheriakova D. Schabbauer G. Lucerna M. Clauss M. De Martin R. Binder B.R. Hofer E. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 230-242Google Scholar), we have here analyzed to what extent NAB2 can down-modulate expression of several different genes induced by angiogenic growth factors and thus plays a direct role in the control of angiogenesis-related responses of endothelial cells. In this respect NAB2 gene transfer to endothelial cells by recombinant adenoviruses was further evaluated as a potential approach to inhibit angiogenesis. Our results show that NAB2 can strongly inhibit VEGF- and bFGF-induced expression of the TF, VEGFR-1, and uPA genes. Furthermore, the adenovirus-mediated overexpression of NAB2 led to significant inhibition of migration, sprouting, and tubule formation in angiogenesis models in vitro and in vivo without obvious cytotoxic side effects.

Purification of large batches of the recombinant adenoviruses was done by two consecutive cesium chloride centrifugations (28Graham F.L. van der Eb A.J. Virology. 1973; 52: 456-467Google Scholar). Adenoviruses without cDNA inserts and viruses expressing GFP (26De Martin R. Raidl M. Hofer E. Binder B.R. Gene Ther. 1997; 4: 493-495Google Scholar) were grown in parallel and used as controls. For infection HUVEC were incubated in PBS complete for 30 min at a m.o.i. of 100. Thereafter, cells were washed and cultured in normal medium 199. The formation of capillary tube-like structures by HUVEC was analyzed on tumor-derived extracellular membrane matrix (Matrigel; Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ). 48-well culture dishes (Costar, Cambridge, MA) were coated with 100 μl/well Matrigel, and the gel was allowed to solidify. Cells were starved for 4 h in medium 199 with 1% SCS, seeded on the polymerized Matrigel (3 × 104 cells/well), further incubated for 16 h, and then fixed in PBS containing 3% formaldehyde and 2% sucrose (29Morales D.E.

Images of the network formed were taken on a phase contrast microscope (Nikon Diaphot TMD) using a cooled charge-coupled device camera (Kappa DX30, Kappa GmbH, Gleichen, Germany). The total length of the tube-like structures formed was then determined with the help of the Analysis Software (Softimaging System, Munster, Germany). An endothelial sprouting angiogenesis assay was performed using HLMEC or HUMEC according to a modification of the method used by Nehlset al. (30Nehls V. Schuchardt E. Drenckhahn D. Microvasc.

Briefly, microcarrier beads coated with denatured collagen (Cytodex 3; Sigma) were seeded with the infected cells, the cells were grown overnight on the beads in medium 199, and the beads then embedded in fibrin gels in 12-well plates (Costar). To prepare the fibrin gel, human fibrinogen (Sigma) was dissolved in PBS complete at a concentration of 2 mg/ml and aprotinin (Bayer, Leverkusen, Germany) was added at a concentration of 200 KIU/ml. The fibrinogen solution was then supplemented with 50 ng/ml VEGF. The solutions were transferred to 12-well plates together with the beads covered by cells at a density of about 200 beads/well, and fibrin formation was induced by addition of 1.2 units/ml thrombin (Sigma). Fibrin gels were equilibrated with serum-free medium containing aprotinin (200 KIU/ml) for 1 h and then incubated with M199 medium supplemented with 20% FCS and growth factors as indicated. After 1 to 2 days the number of capillary-like sprouts formed was counted in the microscope. Only sprouts with a minimal length of ∼150 μm were counted. To visualize cell nuclei, cells were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde and 2% sucrose in PBS and permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS. Then Hoechst 333258 was added to the cells at 500 ng/ml for 30 min. The cytoskeleton was stained with rhodamine-phalloidin (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) for 1 h in the dark. Cells were analyzed by phase contrast microscopy and images taken using a CCD camera. Matrigel solution (BD Biosciences) was supplemented with 1.5 × 108 pfu/ml of recombinant adenoviruses and 300 ng/ml VEGF and injected subcutaneously into the flank of C57BL/6 mice (31Passaniti A. Taylor R.M. Pili R. Guo Y. Long P.V. Haney J.A. Pauly R.R. Grant D.S. Martin G.R. Lab. Invest. 1992; 67: 519-528Google Scholar). On day 6 post injection the mice were sacrificed, and the Matrigel plug was removed and embedded in paraffin. Freeze sections of the plug were prepared and stained with hematoxylin (Merck), DAPI (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA), or rat anti-mouse CD31 antibodies (Oxford, UK) as described in Ref. 31Passaniti A.

Pictures were taken on an AX-70 Olympus microscope (Olympus Optical Co.) using an Optronics DEI-750D CCD camera (Optronics, Muskogee, OK). The number of cells in the Matrigel plugs were quantitated on pictures displaying largely complete sections of the plugs, which were established from serial images taken from the individual sections. The circular images of the sections were divided into 10-degree segments, and the number of the cells within six segments were counted for each section. The transcription factor EGR-1 has been previously shown by us to be induced by VEGF in endothelial cells with the kinetics typical for an immediate-early gene product showing maximal levels ∼60 min after stimulation (7Mechtcheriakova D. Wlachos A. Holzmüller H. Binder B.R. Hofer E. Blood. 1999; 93: 3811-3823Google Scholar). Here we tested the regulation of NAB2 mRNA and protein expression in endothelial cells following VEGF treatment in comparison to EGR-1. HUVEC were short-starved for 5 h in medium containing 1% serum and then treated with VEGF (1.25 nm) for various time periods up to 6 h, and the amount of EGR-1 and NAB2 mRNA and protein was determined by real-time reverse transcription-PCR and Western blotting, respectively. A transient induction of EGR-1 mRNA was observed with maximal expression at about 30 min (Fig.1 A), which was followed by a transient increase in NAB2 mRNA displaying highest values at 120 min. EGR-1 protein levels decreased during starvation (data not shown), were very low in 5 h serum-starved endothelial cells, and reached maximal values 60 min after VEGF treatment (Fig. 1 B). NAB2 levels also decreased during starvation reaching a constant basal level within 5 h. In contrast to EGR-1, VEGF treatment resulted first in a further 4- to 5-fold decrease of NAB2 within 60 min, the time period when EGR-1 levels reached highest values. Thereafter, concomitant with a decrease in EGR-1, NAB2 protein increased again about 10-fold reaching levels at least 2- to 3-fold over initial values. Thus, NAB2 and EGR-1 expression are regulated in a reciprocal way by VEGF. In accordance with important roles of EGR-1 and NAB2 for TF gene transcription, TF mRNA levels reached highest levels at 60 min (Fig. 1 C) at a time period when maximal EGR-1 and lowest NAB2 levels were observed. We have previously shown (7Mechtcheriakova D. Wlachos A. Holzmüller H. Binder B.R. Hofer E. Blood. 1999; 93: 3811-3823Google Scholar, 8Mechtcheriakova D. Schabbauer G. Lucerna M. Clauss M. De Martin R. Binder B.R. Hofer E. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 230-242Google Scholar) that EGR-1 plays an essential role in the activation of the TF gene by VEGF. Therefore, overexpression of NAB2 was tested for its ability to repress VEGF-induced TF promoter activity in reporter gene assays in comparison to EGR-1-triggered activation. Indeed, overexpression of NAB2 resulted in a dose-dependent complete inhibition of VEGF-induced TF promoter activity (Fig. 2), which was comparable to the inhibition of EGR-1-triggered promoter activity. NAB2.AS, a truncated variant of NAB2, which lacks the C-terminal part interacting with EGR-1 (16Svaren J. Sevetson B.R. Apel E.D. Zimonjic D.B. Popescu N.C. Milbrandt J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3545-3553Google Scholar) and does not localize to the nucleus, 2D. Mechtcheriakova, M. Lucerna, and E. Hofer, unpublished observation. did not block VEGF- and EGR-1-mediated transactivation. These results demonstrate that the transcriptional corepressor NAB2 is able to block VEGF-induced gene regulation mediated by EGR-1 in endothelial cells. To test the effect of overexpression of NAB2 on VEGF-inducible responses of endothelial cells that are linked to and regulated by EGR-1, we constructed a recombinant adenovirus expressing NAB2 and infected human endothelial cells with 107 pfu/105 cells. Infected HUVEC showed increasing levels of NAB2 expression from day 1 to day 3 following infection that persisted for over 7 days (Fig.3). These expression levels were significantly higher than physiological levels in endothelial cells as indicated by the fact that the endogenous NAB2 is not visible on images of short Western blot exposures displaying strong bands of adenovirus-expressed NAB2. We first evaluated the effect of adenovirus-mediated NAB2 expression on the induction of mRNAs for TF, uPA, and VEGFR-1 by VEGF (data not shown) and a combination of VEGF and bFGF (Fig.4). uPA and VEGFR-1 were chosen in addition to TF since EGR-1 has been reported to be involved in the up-regulation of the respective genes (12Vidal F. Aragones J. Alfranca A. de Landazuri M.O. Blood. 2000; 95: 3387-3395Google Scholar, 13Khachigian L.M. Lindner V. Williams A.J. Collins T. Science. 1996; 271: 1427-1431Google Scholar). Furthermore, several lines of evidence support an important role of uPA for migration and invasion and of VEGFR-1 for pathological angiogenesis, respectively (2Carmeliet P. Jain R.K. Nature. 2000; 407: 249-257Google Scholar,14Blasi F. Immunol. Today. 1997; 18: 415-417Google Scholar). A combination of VEGF and bFGF was tested because both factors induce EGR-1, have been described to be present in the Matrigel preparations used for the angiogenesis assays described below, and contribute to tumor angiogenesis in vivo (2Carmeliet P. Jain R.K. Nature. 2000; 407: 249-257Google Scholar, 32Santiago F.S. Lowe H.C. Day F.L. Chesterman C.N. Khachigian L.M. Am. J. Pathol. 1999; 154: 937-944Google Scholar). When endothelial cells were infected with the NAB2-expressing virus and induced with the growth factors 2 days thereafter, the normally observed induction of all three mRNAs was inhibited to a large degree (Fig. 4). This shows that by blocking EGR-1 activity NAB2 can inhibit the expression of several genes induced by angiogenic growth factors and involved in angiogenesis. Next we have tested whether this inhibition of gene up-regulation by NAB2 would have consequences for the cellular angiogenic responses of endothelial cells in two different in vitro angiogenesis assays. In one assay we have evaluated the potential of Ad.NAB2 to inhibit migration and tubular network formation after plating of endothelial cells on Matrigel. In the second assay the capacity of endothelial cells to form sprouts and migrate into fibrin gels was investigated. In both cases cells infected with Ad.NAB2 were compared with cells infected with control virus for 24 h. Infection with Ad.NAB2 reduced by 52 ± 14% the tubular network established by HUVEC 16 h after seeding on Matrigel (Fig.5). Parallel cultures seeded on gelatin-coated plates did not display any cytotoxicity caused by the virus infection (data not shown). For the sprouting assay HLMEC or HUMEC were seeded on microcarrier beads, and the beads incorporated into fibrin gels. In this assay the sprouting of the microvascular endothelial cells from the beads into the fibrin gel was dependent to a large degree on the presence of VEGF in the medium (Fig.6). Individual sprouts contained usually between 1 to 3 cells in a string and displayed thin protrusions into the fibrin gel. Also in this assay the capacity of the VEGF-induced cells to form sprouts and to migrate into the fibrin gel was significantly reduced (45 ± 18%, Fig. 6 B).Figure 6Overexpression of NAB2 reduces sprouting in fibrin gels. Cultures of HLMEC or HUMEC were infected with Ad.NAB2 or control virus. After 24 h cells were trypsinized, seeded onto microcarrier beads and further cultivated overnight. On the following day the microcarrier beads covered by a dense monolayer of cells were incorporated into fibrin gels in 24-well tissue culture plates and incubated with growth medium without added growth factors or supplemented with VEGF. 24 to 48 h after incorporation into fibrin gels and incubation with the growth factor cells migrated and formed sprouts into the fibrin gel. A, shows an example of sprouts formed by HLMEC in the presence of VEGF. The cytoskeleton of the cells and the nuclei were stained with rhodamine-phalloidin and Hoechst 333258, respectively. An overlay of the stained cytoskeleton (red) and nuclei (blue) is displayed. Typically between 0.5 and 3 sprouts per bead were observed for growth factor-treated cells. B, shows the analysis of the inhibition in the number of sprouts observed in VEGF-containing culture when Ad.NAB2 infected cells were used in comparison to control virus-infected cells. The mean value ± S.D. calculated from three independent experiments performed with duplicate wells is given.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Finally, we have evaluated to which degree Ad.NAB2 would inhibit the invasion of cells and the formation of vessel-like structures in the murine Matrigel model in vivo(31Passaniti A. Taylor R.M. Pili R. Guo Y. Long P.V. Haney J.A. Pauly R.R. Grant D.S. Martin G.R. Lab. Invest. 1992; 67: 519-528Google Scholar). For this purpose GFP- or NAB2-expressing adenoviruses were mixed into Matrigel solution without or supplemented with VEGF. These mixtures were injected subcutaneously into mice and analyzed 6 days thereafter. We have first tested whether adenoviruses would efficiently infect cells invading the Matrigel plug by staining sections of Ad.GFP- and VEGF-containing plugs with anti-GFP antibodies and DAPI. By comparing the number of GFP-expressing cells inside the plug (Fig.7, picture 1) with the number of nuclei stained with DAPI (Fig. 7, picture 2), it was evident that the cells inside the Matrigel plug were almost completely infected. This is best displayed in the overlay of both stainin"

BRCA1 carboxyl-terminal domain CtBP interacting protein 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid Germ line mutations within the breast and ovarian cancer susceptibility gene BRCA1 predispose carriers to early onset breast and ovarian cancer, and it is estimated that ∼5–10% of all breast cancers are caused by inheritance of dominant disease genes (1Miki Y.

BRCA1 is an 1863-amino acid nuclear phosphoprotein that includes an amino-terminal RING finger domain and two tandem carboxyl-terminal repeats, termed the BRCT domain.

Both of these mutations occur at the interface between the amino- and carboxyl-terminal BRCT repeats and are predicted to affect the way in which the two repeats interact. The enhanced sensitivity of the A1708E mutant to proteolytic digestion indicates that this mutation has profound structural consequences (13Williams R.S. Green R. Glover J.N.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 838-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). In contrast, the M1775R mutant displays a proteolytic sensitivity that is intermediate between that of the wild type protein and the A1708E mutant, suggesting that the M1775R mutation results in a milder structural defect. In the present study we employed limited proteolysis, CD spectroscopy, and x-ray structural analysis to probe the structural consequences of the M1775R mutation. Our results show that the methionine-arginine substitution leads to a rearrangement of the BRCT repeat interface, alterations in the surface of the protein, and global destabilization of the BRCT domain. For proteolytic assays, BRCT-WT and BRCT-M1775R were expressed from the T7 expression vector pLM1 and labeled with [35S]methionine using the TNT-Quick in vitrotranscription/translation system (Promega). Immediately before digestion, proteins were translated at 30 °C for 2 h. The reticulocyte lysates were then centrifuged for 2 min at 10000 ×g to remove insoluble material; 3 μl of the lysate supernatants containing the labeled translation products were added to 12 μl of digestion buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mmpotassium phosphate, pH 7.5) containing increasing concentrations of 1-chloro-3-tosylamido-7-amino-2-heptanone (TLCK)-treated chymotrypsin (Sigma). Following digestion at 20 or 37 °C for 12 min, the reactions were stopped with phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Digestion products were electrophoresed on 15% SDS-PAGE gels and visualized with a phosphorimaging plate and an Amersham Biosciences Typhoon scanner. Quantification of the reaction products within ImageQuant (AmershamBiosciences) used a local average background correction. Expression and purification of recombinant human BRCA1-(1646–1859) (BRCT-WT) and BRCA1-(1646–1859)-M1775R (BRCT-M1775R) was performed essentially as described (13Williams R.S. Green R. Glover J.N.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 838-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar), with some changes. When expressed at 30 and 37 °C, yields of BRCT-M1775R were greatly reduced relative to BRCT-WT, likely because of degradation. To obtain large quantities of BRCT-M1775R protein for crystallization studies, growth of cells and induction of protein expression were carried out at 25 °C. Purification using a combination of ammonium sulfate precipitation, hydrophobic interaction, gel filtration, and anion exchange chromatography yielded 4–5 mg of protein/liter Escherichia coli culture for both proteins. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometric analysis confirmed mutation of residue Met-1775 to arginine. For circular dichroism measurements, proteins were dialyzed into 400 mm NaCl, 50 mmpotassium phosphate (pH 7.5), 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol, in a Millipore Ultrafree-10 concentration unit. Protein concentrations for molar ellipticity calculations were derived from amino acid analysis. Far-UV (195–255 nm) CD spectra were determined using 0.2 mg/ml solutions of protein and were acquired using a Jasco J-720 spectrapolarimeter that was interfaced with Jasco software and equipped with a 0.1-cm quartz cuvette cell. For denaturation experiments, temperature within the cell was regulated using a Peltier thermal control unit. Assuming a two-state unfolding model, denaturation midpoints were determined by following the change in molar ellipticity at 222 nm as a function of temperature. Measurements were taken at 0.5 °C intervals, and the temperature was increased at a rate of 30 °C/h. Ellipticity readings were normalized to the mole fraction of protein folded (ff) or denatured (fu) using the standard equations ff=([θ]−[θ]u)/(([θ]n−[θ]u)Equation 1 fu=(1−ff)where [θ]n and [θ]u are the molar ellipticity for the fully folded and fully denatured protein species. [θ] is the observed ellipticity at each temperature. The midpoint of the temperature-dependent folding-unfolding transition for both proteins was reproducible, but this transition was irreversible and characterized by precipitation within the cell under the conditions used. Protein concentrations for crystallization were determined using the BCA protein assay (Pierce). Unlike the wild type protein, storage of the mutant at concentrations greater than 5 mg/ml resulted in irreversible aggregation within days. To attain high protein concentrations suitable for crystallization, BRCT-M1775R at 1 mg/ml was dialyzed into Protein buffer (400 mm NaCl, 5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5) and concentrated to 20 mg/ml immediately prior to crystallization. Crystals were grown at room temperature (20–22 °C) using the hanging drop vapor diffusion technique. 2 μl of 20 mg/ml BRCT-M1775R in Protein buffer was mixed with 2 μl of well solution (1.4 mammonium sulfate, 100 mm MES, pH 6.7, 10 mmCoCl2) to produce hexagonal crystals within 1 to 2 days (see Table I).Table ICrystallographic data and refinement statisticsUnit cell (space group p6122) a = b(Å)114.708c(Å)121.676Resolution range (Å)50–2.8No. of observed reflections100,697No. of unique reflections12,024Completeness (%)99.3 (100)1-aValues in parentheses are statistics for the highest resolution shell (2.90 − 2.80 Å).R sym(%)1-bR sym = 100 ∑hkl‖〈I〉 −I‖/∑n〈I〉.6.8 (40.4)OverallI/ςI29.9 (3.3)R cryst/R free(%)1-cR cryst = ∑n‖F o(h) −F c(h)‖/∑n‖F o(h)‖, where F o(h) andF c(h) are observed and calculated structure factors for the resolution range 20–2.8 Å.R free calculated with 7% of all reflections excluded from refinement.27.3/29.8No. of residues/H2O/SO42−/Co2+213/59/2/1Ramachandran plot (%):Most favored/allowed/generous/disallowed87.2/11.7/1.1/0RMSD bonds (Å)/angles (°)0.013/1.8571-a Values in parentheses are statistics for the highest resolution shell (2.90 − 2.80 Å).1-b R sym = 100 ∑hkl‖〈I〉 −I‖/∑n〈I〉.1-c R cryst = ∑n‖F o(h) −F c(h)‖/∑n‖F o(h)‖, where F o(h) andF c(h) are observed and calculated structure factors for the resolution range 20–2.8 Å.R free calculated with 7% of all reflections excluded from refinement.

Initial rigid body fitting of the model in the Crystallography and NMR System (CNS) (25Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.-S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M.

Side chains of regions of the protein that change with mutation of the BRCT were built using O (26Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard Acta Crystallogr. Sect.

Maximum likelihood targets, bulk solvent correction, and overall anisotropic B-factor scaling were applied throughout the refinement process. Further refinement involved iterative cycles of manual building and restrained refinement with translation, libration, and screw rotation group anisotropic thermal parameter modeling as implemented in REFMAC (v5.0.32) (27Winn M.D. Isupov M.N.

Green R. Glover J.N.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 838-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 14Joo W.S. Jeffrey P.D. Cantor S.B. Finnin M.S. Livingston D.M. Pavletich N.P. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 583-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Residue Met-1775 is largely buried within the interface between the two repeats and lies in a pocket formed by Leu-1701 and Phe-1704 from the amino-terminal repeat and Leu-1780, Met-1783, Arg-1835, and Leu-1839 from the carboxyl-terminal repeat. Sequence and structural conservation of Met-1775 and its contacting residues among mammalian, xenopus, and avian BRCA1 homologues highlights the importance of Met-1775 in orienting the two BRCT repeats (Fig. 1 B) (13Williams R.S. Green R. Glover J.N.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 838-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 14Joo W.S. Jeffrey P.D. Cantor S.B. Finnin M.S. Livingston D.M. Pavletich N.P. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 583-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). With the exception of residue Arg-1835, which is replaced by a tryptophan in the mouse and rat BRCT domains, the residues forming this pocket are highly conserved. This substitution within the pocket is significant, however, as proximity of the positively charged residue Arg-1835 to Met-1775 in the human protein influences the response of the structure to the cancer-linked substitution, M1775R. Mutant M1775R conferred moderate sensitivity to digestion with trypsin at 20 °C (13Williams R.S. Green R. Glover J.N.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 838-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Because Arg-1775 immediately precedes a proline residue, this substitution is not expected to introduce a new trypsin cleavage site; thus the enhanced trypsin sensitivity is an indication of a subtle structural change in the M1775R mutant. To further assess the stability of the M1775R mutant, we compared its chymotrypsin sensitivity to that of the wild-type protein (Fig. 2,A and B). BRCT-WT and BRCT-M1775R both show resistance to digestion at 20 °C for all protease concentrations. Elevating the temperature to 37 °C enhanced cleavage of the mutant by chymotrypsin at all protease concentrations, whereas the wild type showed only a slight increase in cleavage efficiency at the highest concentration. The fact that the BRCT-M1775R exhibits modest but significant increases in sensitivity to digestion by two proteases with different cleavage specificities, especially at elevated temperatures, indicates that M1775R results in a folding defect in the BRCT domain. To further probe the extent of protein destabilization induced by the M1775R substitution, we compared the secondary structure and thermal stability of BRCT-M1775R to the wild type protein using CD spectroscopy (Fig. 3). The mutant exhibits a far-UV CD absorbance spectrum that is characteristic of a mixed α/β protein and is similar to the wild type, indicating that the overall fold of the M1775R domain is maintained in solution at 20 °C. BRCT-M1775R, however, is less stable, having a midpoint of thermal denaturation of ∼41 °C, 11 °C less than the wild type protein (see Fig. 3,inset and “Experimental Procedures”). Consistent with these findings, solvent denaturation measurements of the thermodynamic stability of the BRCT tandem domain indicates that M1775R destabilizes the BRCT fold by 5.0 kcal/mol at 20 °C (36Ekblad C.M. Wilkinson H.R. Schymkowitz J.W. Rousseau F. Freund S.M. Itzhaki L.S. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 320: 431-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Taken together, these results suggest that functional defects associated with BRCA1-M1775R may be attributed to destabilization of the BRCT domain at physiological temperatures. To gain structural insights into the destabilizing effect of M1775R, we crystallized and determined the structure of BRCT-M1775R at 2.8 Å (see Fig. 4 A, TableI, and “Experimental Procedures”). 2Fo−Fc andFo−Fc difference electron density indicate that structural rearrangements in response to the mutation are confined to residues within an ∼5 Å radius of Arg-1775. Paired 4ς-positive and -negative electron density features in the Fo−Fc map near residue 1775 reveal that the substituted arginine is displaced from the hydrophobic core of the protein (Fig. 4 A). The mutation is further accommodated by an ∼1 Å shift of a neighboring residue, Pro-1776, in the β1′-α1′ connecting loop and a series of side chain rearrangements that perturb the native inter-BRCT hydrogen bonding and van der Waals contact networks (Fig. 5,A–C). Introduction of an arginine at position 1775 creates a clustering of three positively charged residues, Arg-1699, -1775, and -1835. In the native structure, Arg-1699 from the amino-terminal BRCT repeat participates in the sole conserved inter-BRCT repeat salt bridge with a pair of carboxyl-terminal BRCT acidic residues, Asp-1840 and Glu-1836 (Fig. 5 A). Arg-1835 in human BRCA1 normally participates in a hydrogen bonding network with Gln-1811, thereby helping to orient the β1′-α1′ loop (Fig. 5 A). The positively charged guanidinium group of variant Arg-1775 is found positioned between two large positive peaks in our electron density maps that we have interpreted to be sulfate molecules, the highest concentration anion in the crystallization mother liquor (Figs. 4 and 5 B). In the mutant, Arg-1699 retains the salt bridge with Asp-1840 but no longer contacts Glu-1836 and instead coordinates an anion. Arg-1835 rotates away from Gln-1811 and forms a new salt bridge with Glu-1836. Thus, it appears that electrostatic stabilization of this positive charge cluster is achieved through ordering of solvent anions and a cascade of hydrogen bonding alterations. The adjustments in the positions of Arg-1775 and -1835 described above result in the displacement of the aliphatic portions of these side chains from the protein core (Fig. 5 C). In response to these movements, Leu-1780 shifts to maintain van der Waals contact with the arginine residues. These movements are accomplished without the creation of large, energetically costly cavities within the hydrophobic core (33Liang J. Edelsbrunner H. Woodward C. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 1884-1897Crossref PubMed Scopus (874) Google Scholar, 34Eriksson A.E. Baase W.A. Zhang X.J. Heinz D.W. Blaber M. Baldwin E.P. Matthews B.W. Science. 1992; 255: 178-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (893) Google Scholar, 35Matthews B.W. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 35-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The repacking of the core, however, in combination with instability created by hydrogen bonding changes and charge-charge repulsion of basic residues at the BRCT-BRCT interface may collectively help account for the 5 kcal/mol destabilization reported for the BRCT-M1775R protein (36Ekblad C.M. Wilkinson H.R. Schymkowitz J.W. Rousseau F. Freund S.M. Itzhaki L.S. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 320: 431-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Few crystallographic examples documenting protein structural responses to the introduction of charged residues into the hydrophobic core are available. Structural investigation of a comparable, highly destabilizing mutation in T4 lysozyme, Met-102 → Lys-102, reveals the position of the lysine side chain changes little when compared with native Met-102 packing (37Dao-pin S. Anderson D.E. Baase W.A. Dahlquist F.W. Matthews B.W. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 11521-11529Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Instead, the mutation is accompanied by increased mobility of flanking residues, including a helix that normally packs against the substituted methionine. This motion allows access of the buried, basic side chain to solvent via a folding-unfolding transition of neighboring structured regions. The structural rearrangement that we observe in BRCT-M1775R is less dramatic but nevertheless results in the expulsion of the charged side chain from the hydrophobic protein core. At the surface of the protein, a hydrophobic groove near Met-1775 is apparent in the wild type structure (Fig. 5 D). With the movement of Arg-1775 in the mutant, this cleft becomes occluded with charged atoms (Fig. 5 E). This raises the possibility that, in addition to the destabilizing effect of the mutation, the substitution may disrupt association of BRCA1 with its interaction partners by directly modifying an exposed protein binding site. However, this site does not overlap with a BACH1 binding site that maps to the β3-α2 connecting loop (Fig. 1) of the amino-terminal BRCT repeat (14Joo W.S. Jeffrey P.D. Cantor S.B. Finnin M.S. Livingston D.M. Pavletich N.P. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 583-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), which is greater than 20 Å away from Met-1775. BACH1 binding is impaired by the M1775R substitution, suggesting that global structural defects resulting from the mutation, rather than localized structural and electrostatic perturbation, are responsible for the binding defect. Moreover, variant M1775R is defective in many biochemical assays that assess BRCA1 function and is unable to interact with several other proteins that associate with the wild type BRCT domain (Table II). It is unlikely that all of these proteins target a common surface near Met-1775 that is changed by the mutation. We therefore suggest that the wide spectrum of molecular defects reported for variant M1775R is explained by the destabilization of the domain.Table IIDefects associated with BRCA1-M1775RDeleterious effectReferencesMutant BRCA1 allele encoding BRCA1-M1775R segregates with disease in families with breast and ovarian cancer1Miki Y.

Although it is difficult to predict individual energetic contributions of the M1775R rearrangements to BRCT destabilization, it is clear that the cumulative changes affecting the structure across the BRCT-BRCT interface result in a temperature-sensitive tandem BRCT domain (Figs. 2and 3) that is defective in BRCA1 protein interaction, transcription, and DNA repair functions. In analogous studies, the quantitative measurement of the thermodynamic stability of the p53 tumor suppressor has shown that many of the common cancer-causing mutations are destabilizing. Consequently, p53 is inactivated by mutation, and cell cycle control is lost (38Bullock A.N. Fersht A.R. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2001; 1: 68-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). Because many of the BRCT missense variants destabilize the BRCT to the same extent or more than M1775R (13Williams R.S. Green R. Glover J.N.M. Nat. Struct.

Examination of the effects of other missense mutations on BRCA1 cellular function will be necessary to correlate BRCT loss of structure with BRCA1 loss of function and will further establish protein misfolding as a basic molecular mechanism of disease.

Biochem. 1999; 68: 523-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). SR-BI helps control the structure and metabolism of HDL by mediating the transport of lipids from HDL to cells. The mechanism by which SR-BI mediates this lipid transport differs from the classic LDL receptor pathway of endocytosis, in which the entire lipoprotein is internalized via coated pits and subsequently hydrolyzed by lysosomal enzymes (3Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Science. 1986; 232: 34-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (4383) Google Scholar). Instead, HDL binds to SR-BI, lipids of HDL (primarily neutral lipids such as cholesteryl esters in the core of the particle) are transported into the cells, and the lipid-depleted particle is released into the extracellular space (1Acton S.

The molecular mechanisms underlying SR-BI activity and the relationship of the structure of SR-BI to its functions are not well-understood. To better understand the structure of SR-BI and its mechanism of action, we have conducted several studies involving the generation and characterization of SR-BI mutants (6Gu X. Trigatti B. Xu S. Acton S. Babitt J. Krieger M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26338-26348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 9Gu X. Kozarsky K. Krieger M. J. Biol.

Chem. 2000; 275: 9120-9130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Some of these studies have shown that the large, extracellular loop of SR-BI, which is glycosylated, plays a critical role in mediating not only ligand binding but also the selective lipid uptake step (6, also see Ref. 26Connelly M.A. de la Llera-Moya M. Monzo P. Yancey P.G. Drazul D. Stoudt G. Fournier N. Klein S.M. Rothblat G.H. Williams D.L. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 5249-5259Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). To date, the functional role of the extensive N-linked glycosylation of SR-BI has not been explored. Oligosaccharides in glycoproteins can serve a variety of functions, including facilitating protein folding, protecting against proteolysis, directly participating in intermolecular interactions, directing intracellular trafficking and secretion, and influencing cell surface expression and activity (27Helenius A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 253-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar, 28Opdenakker G. Rudd P.M. Ponting C.P. Dwek A.R.

In some cases it has not been possible to attribute a specific function to a given N-linked glycan. Here we report the effects of mutating (Asn → Gln or Thr → Ala) each of the 11 potential N-linked glycosylation sites (Asn-X-Ser/Thr) in the extracellular loop of murine SR-BI on the extent of glycosylation (changes in apparent mass), cell surface expression, 125I-HDL binding, and cellular uptake of lipid from HDL. The results show that all 11 sites are glycosylated and that two of these sites at positions 108 and 173 are essential for normal surface expression and efficient lipid uptake but not HDL binding. Indeed, the position 173 mutation inhibits most SR-BI-mediated lipid uptake without significantly altering the apparent binding affinity of HDL or maximal amount of binding. They also show that the HDL binding and lipid transport activities of mSR-BI can be uncoupled. [1α,2α(n)-3H]Cholesteryl oleoyl ether ([3H]CEt, 1 mCi/ml, specific activity of 58 Ci/mmol) was from Amersham Biosciences. Human HDL,125I-HDL, DiI-labeled HDL, Alexa-labeled HDL, and [3H]CEt-HDL were prepared as described previously (1Acton S. Rigotti A. Landschulz K.T. Xu S. Hobbs H.H. Krieger M.

Rabbit antiserum against the extracellular domain of mSR-BI was previously described (anti-mSR-BI KKB-1 antiserum, 1:1000 dilution), a generous gift from K. Kozarsky (9Gu X. Kozarsky K. Krieger M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29993-30001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), FITC-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:1000 dilution, Cappel, West Chester, PA). All other reagents were obtained from standard commercial sources or as described previously (30Krieger M. Cell. 1983; 33: 413-422Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). All of the expression vectors for mSR-BI and mutants were constructed in pCDNA1 (Invitrogen) using standard recombinant DNA techniques. Wild-type mSR-BI expression vectors used for these studies included pmSR-BI 77 (1) and a minor variant ex68, which contained small differences in the linker region to facilitate cloning and restriction digestion (25Gu X. Lawrence R. Krieger M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9120-9130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis to create the mutants was performed on SR-BI cDNA in the pCDNA1 vector using a commercial kit (QuikChangeTMsite-directed mutagenesis kit, Stratagene Inc., La Jolla, CA) according to the manufacturer's instruction. Briefly, a pair of complementary primers with 25–35 bases was designed for each mutagenesis, and the mutation to change asparagine to glutamine or threonine to alanine was placed in the middle of the primers. The wild-type mSR-BI cDNA within pcDNA was amplified for 16 cycles in a DNA thermal cycler using Pfu DNA polymerase with these primers. After digestion of the template DNA with DpnI, the amplified mutant DNA was transformed into Escherichia coli (MC1061/P3 strain (Invitrogen)). The mutations were confirmed by automated DNA sequencing. The sequences of the mutagenic primers for the Asn → Gln mutants were: 102, 5′-TTC AGA CAA AAG GTC CAG ATC ACC TTC AAT GAC-3′; 108, 5′-ATC ACC TTC AAT GAC CAG GAC ACC GTG TCC TTC-3′; 116, 5′-C GTG TCC TTC GTG GAG CAG CGC AGC CTC CAT TTC C-3′; 173, 5′-C CAG CGT GCT TTT ATG CAG CGC ACA GTT GGT GAG-3′; 212, 5′-CTG TTT GTT GGG ATG CAG AAC TCG AAT TCT GGG-3′; 227, 5′-TTC ACG GGC GTC CAG CAA TTC AGC AGG ATC CAT C-3′; 255, 5′-CTGCCCGGAGGTACCTTGGATCATGTTACACTGCTC-3′; 288, 5′-CC ATG AAG CTG ACC TAC CAG GAA TCA AGG GTG TTT G-3′; 310, 5′-GAT ACT CTG TTT GCC CAG GGG TCC GTC TAC CCA-3′; 330, 5′-ACCTGCAGGTGCTGACTTGCTGAATGCCAGACTC-3′; 383, 5′-C ACT GGG ATC CCC ATG CAG TGT TCT GTG AAG ATG C-3′.

COS M6 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mm glutamine (medium A) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (medium B) at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2/95% air incubator. For transfections, 1.5 × 105 cells/well of COS M6 cells were plated on day 0 in 24-well dishes in medium B. On day 1, cells were transfected with the plasmid expression vectors for wild-type or mutant mSR-BI, or with a control plasmid that did not encode a protein product (pCDNA1), using the DEAE-dextran method described previously (31Acton S.L. Scherer P.E. Lodish H.F. Krieger M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21003-21009Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). On day 2, the medium was replaced with medium B containing 1 mm sodium n-butyrate (medium C). On day 3, transfected cells were used for flow cytometry, 125I-HDL binding assays, or immunoblotting. Cells were labeled with either DiI-HDL alone (assay of lipid uptake activity), with anti-mSR-BI KKB-1 antiserum followed by FITC-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG alone, or both, or with Alexa-HDL alone (assay of HDL binding) or both Alexa-HDL and DiI-HDL. We used flow cytometry to quantitate the uptake of DiI from DiI-HDL and the binding of Alexa-HDL. On day 3 cells were washed once with medium A and then incubated either at 37 °C for 2 h with the indicated concentration of DiI-HDL in medium A containing 0.5% (w/v) fatty acid-free BSA (medium D) or at 4 °C for 1 h in Ca2+- and Mg2+-free PBS (fPBS) containing 0.5% (w/v) fatty acid-free BSA (buffer A), 2 mm EDTA, and 10 μg of protein/ml Alexa HDL. The DiI-HDL-treated cells were then washed twice with fPBS, suspended by gentle pipetting in buffer A, and analyzed using a FACScan (BD Biosciences) flow cytometer as previously described (6Gu X.

Chem. 2000; 275: 9120-9130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The Alexa-HDL-treated cells were detached from the plate by gently pipetting and held on ice. Immediately prior to flow cytometric analysis, the cells were pelleted at 500 ×g for 2 min and resuspended in buffer A. The levels of cell surface expression of SR-BI were determined by flow cytometry using the SR-BI-specific antibody KKB-1 (9Gu X. Kozarsky K. Krieger M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29993-30001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). On day 3, cells were washed once with medium A and then incubated at 4 °C for 1 h in PBS containing 0.5% fatty acid-free BSA (buffer B) and KKB-1 antiserum (1:1000 dilution). The cells were then washed twice with PBS and incubated for 40 min at 4 °C in 200 μl of buffer B containing FITC-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:1000 dilution, Cappel, West Chester, PA). After two additional washes with fPBS, the cells were suspended by gentle pipetting in buffer A. For two-color flow cytometry, cells were first labeled with DiI-HDL at 37 °C as described above, washed twice with PBS, and then incubated with either Alexa-HDL or anti-mSR-BI KKB-1 antiserum and FITC-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG as described above. The mean values of the fluorescence intensity are reported. Receptor-specific values for DiI uptake, Alexa-HDL binding, and surface expression are defined as the differences between the values determined using cells transfected with the plasmids encoding the wild-type or mutant receptors and those determined using cells transfected with the non-coding (empty vector) controls. The receptor-specific values for the mutant receptors are usually expressed as the percentage of those determined using the wild-type receptor. In some cases, the values were normalized by dividing by the relative levels of surface expression determined using the KKB-1 antibody. The ratios of 125I-HDL binding to Alexa-HDL and KKB-1 binding were similar for all cells expressing either wild-type mSR-BI or the glycosylation mutants. It is possible, but unlikely, that any given mutation simultaneously and equally changed both HDL binding and KKB-1 binding. It therefore seems unlikely that any of the mutations altered the ability of KKB-1 to bind to the receptor. Thus, quantitative analysis of KKB-1 binding to intact cells was used as a measure of receptor surface expression for both wild-type and mutant receptors. Stable transfectants were generated using the LDL receptor-deficient CHO cell line ldlA-7 (32Kingsley D. Krieger M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 5454-5458Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) as previously described (1Acton S. Rigotti A. Landschulz K.T. Xu S. Hobbs H.H. Krieger M. Science. 1996; 271: 518-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (2010) Google Scholar). Cells grown in 100-mm dishes were cotransfected with 10 μg of pcDNA1 encoding mSR-BI containing a N173Q mutation and 1 μg of pBK-CMV plasmid (Stratagene) using the GenePORTER transfection reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions. Stably transfected cells were selected in Ham's F-12 medium containing 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mm glutamine (medium E) supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (medium F) and 500 μg/ml G418 for 2 weeks as previously described (9Gu X. Kozarsky K. Krieger M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29993-30001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Surface expression of the mutant mSR-BI was detected using the KKB-1 antibody as described above using flow cytometry, and individual cells with high levels of expression were sorted, isolated, and cloned as described previously (25Gu X. Lawrence R. Krieger M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9120-9130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), and one clone designated ldlA[N173Q] was used for the experiments shown. The binding of125I-HDL to ldlA-7, ldlA[mSR-BI], and ldlA[N173Q] cells was measured in 24-well plates as previously described (1Acton S. Rigotti A. Landschulz K.T. Xu S. Hobbs H.H. Krieger M. Science. 1996; 271: 518-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (2010) Google Scholar). A similar assay was used to measure binding to transiently transfected COS cells with the following minor modifications: On day 3 transfected cells were washed once with medium A and then incubated with the indicated concentrations of 125I-HDL in medium D. Receptor-specific binding values for transfected COS cells were defined as the differences between values for the receptor-expressing cells and control cells transfected with the empty vector. Cellular uptake of [3H]CEt from [3H]CE-HDL was measured after a 2-h incubation at 37 °C as previously described (1Acton S. Rigotti A. Landschulz K.T. Xu S. Hobbs H.H. Krieger M. Science. 1996; 271: 518-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (2010) Google Scholar). Receptor-specific uptake was calculated as the difference in the values obtained in the presence (single incubations, nonspecific) and absence (duplicate incubations, total) of a 40-fold excess unlabeled HDL. Cells were grown in medium B and lysed with detergent (50 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% Triton), and aliquots (20–40 μg of protein) were denatured in 5% SDS, 10% β-mercaptoethanol buffer at 100 °C for 10 min. Then, 1/10 volume of 10× G5 buffer (0.5 m sodium citrate (pH 5.5 at 25 °C)) and 2–10 units of endoglycosidase H (endo H) were added, and the mixture was incubated at 37 °C overnight. Undigested controls were incubated without the added enzyme. Cell lysates were analyzed by immunoblotting with the rabbit anti-SR-BI anti-peptide polyclonal antibody 495 (1Acton S. Rigotti A. Landschulz K.T. Xu S. Hobbs H.H. Krieger M. Science. 1996; 271: 518-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (2010) Google Scholar,11Rigotti A. Trigatti B.L. Penman M. Rayburn H. Herz J. Krieger M. Proc. Natl.

On day 2 after plating, cells were fixed with 4% formaldehyde in PBS for 30 min at room temperature, washed twice with PBS, incubated for 15 min with 50 mmNH4Cl, blocked for 1 h with 10% fetal bovine serum in PBS, incubated overnight at 4 °C with KKB-1 antibody (1:1000 dilution), and then incubated with Texas Red-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibody (1:500 dilution) at room temperature for 1 h in the dark. Controls included rabbit IgG (10 μg/ml) as primary antibody followed by secondary antibody or omitting the primary antibody and incubating only with secondary antibody. Samples were then washed with PBS three times for 5 min and mounted in Vectashield (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). The cells were viewed with a Zeiss Axioplan microscope (×63 and 1.3 numerical aperture objective) and a confocal laser scanning system (1024 Bio-Rad MRC equipped with an argon krypton laser). Images were saved as tiff format files and edited with Photoshop 6.0 software. Murine SR-BI contains 11 potentialN-linked glycosylation sites (Asn-X-Ser/Thr) in its extracellular domain (1Acton S. Rigotti A. Landschulz K.T. Xu S. Hobbs H.H. Krieger M. Science. 1996; 271: 518-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (2010) Google Scholar); these include the asparagines at positions: 102, 108, 116, 173, 212, 227, 255, 288, 310, 330, and 383. These sites are conserved in the mouse and rat and, with the exception of positions 116 and 288, in the human and hamster. Previous studies have shown that, when expressed in CHO cells, at least five of these sites in mSR-BI are modified by glycosylation and thatN-glycosylation appears to account for most of the difference between the predicted (∼57 kDa, based on amino acid sequence) and observed (∼82 kDa determined by SDS-PAGE) masses of SR-BI (33Babbit J. Trigatti B.L. Rigotti A. Smart E.J. Anderson R.G. Xu S. Krieger M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13242-13249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). The observed apparent mass of SR-BI is ∼82 kDa in a variety of both cultured cells and tissues, suggesting that the extent of N-glycosylation is similar in these cells and tissues. To determine which of the potential N-linked sites were glycosylated, we (a) generated a collection of 11 mutant mSR-BI cDNA expression vectors in which one of each of the 11 sites was mutated (Asn → Gln), (b) expressed the wild-type and mutant proteins in COS M6 cells by transient transfection, and (c) compared their electrophoretic mobilities by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with an anti-C terminus antipeptide antibody (1Acton S. Rigotti A. Landschulz K.T. Xu S. Hobbs H.H. Krieger M. Science. 1996; 271: 518-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (2010) Google Scholar). This antibody can recognize mSR-BI independently of its glycosylation state (Ref. 33Babbit J. Trigatti B.L. Rigotti A. Smart E.J. Anderson R.G. Xu S. Krieger M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13242-13249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar and data not shown). The expectation was that there would be a small increase in electrophoretic mobility (reduced apparent mass) in a mutant mSR-BI relative to the wild-type if the mutated site were glycosylated in the wild-type protein.

Phosphorylation of serines 1423 and -1524 was not induced in HCC1937 breast cancer cells, which contain mutant BRCA1 protein. Confocal microscopy revealed that unphosphorylated BRCA1 localizes on chromosomes from metaphase through telophase, whereas Ser-988-phosphorylated BRCA1 resides in the inner chromosomal structure, centrosome, and the cleavage furrow during prophase through telophase. We also found that Ser-988-phosphorylated BRCA1 relocalizes to the perinuclear region when cells are subjected to IR or UV radiation in the S phase.

Bioessays. 2000; 8: 728-737Crossref Scopus (275) Google Scholar). In normally growing cells, BRCA1 is phosphorylated in a cell cycle-dependent manner; the protein undergoes hyperphosphorylation during the S phase and is dephosphorylated after the M phase (8Chen Y. Farmer A.A. Chen C.-F. Jones D.C. Chen P.-L. Lee W.-H. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 3168-3172PubMed Google Scholar, 9Ruffner H. Verma I.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7138-7143Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Biochemical analysis has revealed that Ser-1497 is phosphorylated by cyclin-dependent kinase 2/cyclin A and E complexes (10Ruffner H. Jiang W. Craig A.G. Hunter T. Verma I.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4843-4854Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). It has been also shown that DNA damage induces both nuclear redistribution of BRCA1 and an increased phosphorylation of the protein through DNA damage-activated kinases such as ATM,1 ATR, and hCds1/Chk2 (11Chen J. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 5037-5039PubMed Google Scholar, 12Lee J.S. Collins K.M. Brown A.L. Lee C.H. Chung J.H. Nature. 2000; 404: 201-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar, 13Cortez D.

Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2989-3002Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). Several phosphorylation sites have been identified under these conditions, including Ser-988, -1423, -1387, and -1524. It has recently been shown that re-expression of wild type BRCA1 confers weak resistance to DNA damage-induced cell death in HCC1937 BRCA1 mutant breast cancer cell lines (12Lee J.S. Collins K.M. Brown A.L. Lee C.H. Chung J.H. Nature. 2000; 404: 201-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar, 13Cortez D. Wang Y Qin J. Elledge S.J.

Furthermore, ionizing radiation (IR) treatment has been shown to induce phosphorylation of transcriptional corepressor CtIP, consequently releasing the protein from the BRCA1-containing complex leading to activation of transcriptional regulation of BRCA1 (16Li S. Ting N.S. Zheng L. Chen P.-L. Ziv Y. Shiloh Y. Lee E.-Y. Lee W.H. Nature. 2000; 406: 210-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). These results provide a model of how DNA damage-induced phosphorylation of BRCA1 leads to transmission of signals that regulate gene expression. Previous studies have revealed that BRCA1 is involved in the G2-M checkpoint (17Xu X. Weaver Z. Linke S.P., Li, C. Gotay J. Wang X.-W. Harris C.C. Ried T. Deng C.-X. Mol.

Genet. 2002; 30: 285-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). Mouse embryonic fibroblasts carrying a targeted deletion of exon 11 of the BRCA1 gene showed a defective G2-M checkpoint accompanying unequal chromosome segregation, abnormal nuclear division, and aneuploidy. Interestingly, these phenotypes were also induced by overexpression of centrosome-associated Aurora-A/BTAK/STK15 kinase, which is frequently amplified in breast cancer cells (20Sen S. Zhou H. White R.A. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 2195-2200Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar, 21Zhou H. Kuang J. Zhong L. Kuo W.-L. Gray J.W. Sahin A. Brinkley B.R. Sen S. Nat.

Cancer Res. 2000; 6: 1833-1839PubMed Google Scholar). More recently, BRCA1 has been shown to localize in the mitotic centrosome, interacting with γ-tublin (23Hsu L.-C. White R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12983-12988Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 24Hsu L.-C. Doan T.P. White R.L. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 7713-7718PubMed Google Scholar). Although these studies strongly suggest pivotal functions of BRCA1 in mitosis, physiological roles and regulation of BRCA1 phosphorylation in mitosis still require clarification. In the current study, we investigated how BRCA1 phosphorylation is regulated during the cell cycle and in response to DNA damage. For these purposes, phospho-Ser-specific antibodies recognizing Ser-988, -1423, -1497, and -1524 residues of BRCA1 were generated and employed to study BRCA1 phosphorylation in the S and G2/M phases of cells with or without DNA damage. These results reinforce a model wherein phosphorylation of specific residues of BRCA1 after DNA damage affects its localization and function. Rabbit polyclonal phospho-Ser-specific antibodies for BRCA1 were generated by Research Genetics, Inc. against KLH-conjugated synthetic peptides as follows: S988,LFPIKSpFVKTKCK; S1423, EPGVERSSpPSKCPS; S1497, VLEQHGSpQPSNSY; S1524, QNRNYPSpQEELIK. Monoclonal antibody 21A8 was generated by immunizing mice with GST-BRCA1 (amino acids 1314–1863) in the Mount Sinai School of Medicine Core. Cell extracts were prepared in EBC buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 250 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm EDTA, pH 8.0) with mixed protease inhibitor (Sigma). To detect changes in the mobility of p220-p240BRCA1, prolonged 5% SDS-PAGE was used in 25 mm Tris, 192 mm glycine, 0.1% SDS. After transferring, filters were blocked with 8% nonfat dried milk in TBS-T (20 mm Tris, pH 8, 0.9% NaCl, 0.5% Tween). The primary antibodies 21A8, Ab-1 (Calbiochem) and 8F7 (GeneTex) were used for 1 h at room temperature. Antibodies S988, S1423, S1497, and S1524 were used at 10 μg/ml. The secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch) were peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (H+L) or anti-rabbit IgG (H+L). Films were developed by ECL. HEK293, MCF7, and HCC1937 cells were obtained from ATCC. Cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal bovine serum for HEK293 and MCF7 cells, or RPMI1640, 10% fetal bovine serum for HCC1937 cells. Cell extracts were prepared in EBC buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8, 120 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40 (NP-40)), with the addition of 50 mm NaF, 1 mmsodium orthovanadate, 100 μg/ml polymethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin. IR was administered using MARK2 IRRADIATOR (J. L. Shepherd & Associates, San Fernando, CA). Cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed by Lysis buffer (20 mmHepes, pH 7.5, 20% glycerol, 10 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 50 μm leupeptin, and 50 μg/ml aprotinin). After centrifuge at 2,300 rpm at 4 °C, pellet was resuspended in nuclear extract buffer (Lysis buffer containing 500 mm NaCl). After rocking at 4 °C for 1 h, samples were centrifuged. Twenty μg of both nuclear and cytoplasmic samples were immunoblotted by 8F7 or nucleophosmin antibody (Cell Signaling Technology). Cell cycles were synchronized by following a previously described protocol (26Scully R. Chen J. Ochs R.L. Keegan K. Hoekstra M. Feunteun J. Livingston D.M. Cell. 1997; 90: 425-435Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar) and analyzed by FACSCalibur (BD PharMingen). Cells were fixed for 1 h in phosphate-buffered saline, 3% paraformaldehyde, 2% sucrose solution, followed by 5 min of permeabilization at room temperature in Triton buffer (0.5% Triton X-100, 20 mm HEPES, 50 mmNaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 300 mm sucrose). Blocking was done with 5% normal horse serum, 5% normal goat serum. BRCA1 was visualized using mouse monoclonal antibody 21A8, and Ser-988 phosphorylation was visualized using the polyclonal S988 antibody. All secondary antibodies used were species-specific antibodies from Jackson ImmunoResearch (Texas Red-X for mouse IgG and fluorescein isothiocyanate for rabbit IgG), used at 1:100 throughout. Nuclei were stained with DAPI. All images were collected with a Leica TCS-SP confocal laser scanning microscope and processed using Adobe Photoshop software. Phospho-Ser-specific antibodies were raised and affinity purified against synthetic peptides containing phosphorylated Ser-988 (S988), -1423 (S1423), -1497 (S1497), and -1524 (S1524) of the BRCA1 protein (see “Experimental Procedures”). Specificity of these phospho-specific BRCA1 antibodies was examined by immunoblot analysis using cell lysates prepared from exponentially growing MCF7 cells with or without λ-phosphatase treatment (Fig. 1 A, left). These results demonstrated that S988, S1423, S1497, and S1524 antibodies recognize only phosphorylated forms of BRCA1. Affinity-purified mouse monoclonal antibody 21A8 was generated by immunizing mice with amino acids 1314–1863 of the BRCA1 protein. MCF7 cells were cell cycle synchronized, and BRCA1 phosphorylation was studied using the antibodies described above. Increased expression of the β-form (about 240 kDa) of BRCA1 was detected in the S and G2/M phases by 21A8, presumably as a result of the hyperphosphorylation (Fig. 1 A,right). Phosphorylation of Ser-988 and -1423 of α-form BRCA1 (about 220 kDa) weakly increased in the G2/M phase, but phosphorylation of Ser-1497 and -1524 residues did not change significantly during the cell cycle. Notably, despite high levels of the β-form BRCA1 in the S and G2/M phases detected by 21A8, only S988 antibody weakly detected an increased signal of the β-form, indicating that β-form BRCA1 contains multiple phosphorylation sites other than Ser-988 in the S and G2/M phases. Next, we compared the phosphorylation of wild type and mutant forms (5382insC) of BRCA1. Asynchronized MCF7 cells expressing wild type BRCA1 were treated with different dosages of UV (5, 10, 50, and 100 mJ/cm2) or IR (1, 5, 10, and 50 Gy), and BRCA1 phosphorylation was then determined (Fig. 1 B). Like 21A8, anti-BRCA1 antibody 8F7 detected the α- and β-forms of BRCA1 protein in UV- and IR-treated cells. Phosphorylation of Ser-988 was strongly induced by 1 Gy of IR or UV treatment (50–100 mJ/cm2) with slow migration at position β. UV treatment also strongly induced Ser-1423 phosphorylation of the β-form. Increased Ser-1524 phosphorylation was observed in the α-form of BRCA1 in response to 10–50 mJ/cm2 of UV or 10 Gy of IR treatment. These results suggest that DNA-damaged cells contain several species of BRCA1 of differing phosphorylation status. The HCC1937 breast cancer cell line expresses 5382insC mutant BRCA1, resulting in formation of the immature BRCT domain (25Tomlinson G.E. Chen T.T. Stastny V.A. Virmani A.K. Spillman M.A. Tonk V. Blum J.L. Schneider N.R. Wistuba I.I. Shay J.W. Minna J.D. Gazdar A.F. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 3237-3242PubMed Google Scholar). We analyzed how this mutant form of BRCA1 is phosphorylated after DNA damage (Fig. 1 C). The mutant did not show a significant mobility shift after DNA damage. Unlike the case in MCF7 cells, both UV and IR induced Ser-988 phosphorylation and a slight mobility shift in a dose-dependent manner, whereas phosphorylation of Ser-1423 and -1524 was not induced to a significant degree by the same treatment. Significantly, HCC1937 cells re-expressing wild type BRCA1 have been found to be more resistant to IR damage than those expressing S988A mutant BRCA1 (13Cortez D. Wang Y Qin J. Elledge S.J. Science. 1999; 286: 1162-1166Crossref PubMed Scopus (873) Google Scholar). These results suggest that C-terminal BRCA1 is required for phosphorylation of BRCA1 and that the functional C-terminal BRCT domain, which is lost in mutant BRCA1 in HCC1937 cells, plays a crucial role in survival after damage. We next investigated how DNA damage-specific phosphorylation is regulated during the cell cycle. MCF7 cells were synchronized at the S or G2/M phase and treated with different doses of IR as indicated. Samples were collected 0.5, 1, 3, and 5 h after treatment, and BRCA1 phosphorylation was determined by means of S988, S1423, and S1524 antibodies. In the S phase (Fig. 2 A), 21A8 consistently detected the α- and β-forms of BRCA1. Ser-988 phosphorylation weakly increased in the α-form, but the β-form was predominantly and strongly phosphorylated in response to higher doses of treatment. Ser-1423 phosphorylation weakly increased in response to all doses tested. Ser-1524 phosphorylation was strongly induced by 5 Gy or higher doses and sustained at least 5 h after treatment. Phosphorylation of BRCA1 in the G2/M phase was also studied (Fig. 2 B). Antibody 21A8 detected both the α- and the β-forms of BRCA1 throughout the time course. After damage, Ser-988 phosphorylation slightly increased in the α′-form detected between the α- and β-forms. Ser-1423 was phosphorylated in the α-form as early as 3 h by 1 Gy of radiation, but 5 Gy or higher doses induced Ser-423 phosphorylation within 30 min. Ser-1524 phosphorylation did not increase significantly in the α-form, and 10 Gy or higher doses of radiation even decreased phosphorylation. These results demonstrate that (i) phosphorylation sites of BRCA1 are determined by both the level of DNA damage and the time course of unfolding of the effects of that damage, and (ii) after DNA damage BRCA1 exists as a heterogeneous pool of species with differing phosphorylation status even when the cell cycle has been synchronized. We next studied UV-induced BRCA1 phosphorylation. Monoclonal antibody 21A8 predominantly detected the α-form of BRCA1 in damaged cells in the S phase (Fig. 3 A). Reduced expression of BRCA1 in cells treated with high UV doses is presumably because of protein degradation of apoptotic cells. The BRCA1 α“-form, similar in molecular weight to the α′-form in Fig. 2 B, showed Ser-988 phosphorylation when treated with 50 and 100 mJ/cm2 of UV after 3–5 h. Ser-1423 phosphorylation did not change in response to the lower dose but slightly decreased with 50 and 100 mJ/cm2 of UV. No significant changes of Ser-1524 phosphorylation were detected. Antibody 21A8 was found to recognize hyperphosphorylated BRCA1 (β-form) in the G2/M phase, although the antibody had been generated by immunizing a bacterial GST fusion protein that presumably is an unphosphorylated peptide (Fig. 3 B). S988 and S1423 detected doublet signals (α- and β-forms) when treated with 50 and 100 mJ/cm2 of UV. In the α-form Ser-1524 phosphorylation was slightly increased by 50 mJ/cm2 of UV. Again, these results demonstrate that several species of BRCA1 with differential phosphorylation status are present in UV-damaged S and G2/M phase cells. Cell cycle-dependent localization of BRCA1 was determined in detail by confocal laser microscopy using the 21A8 and S988 antibodies (Fig. 4 A). As reported previously, nuclear BRCA1 was weakly stained during the G0 and G1 phases, and a distinct dot pattern appeared during S phase (26Scully R. Chen J. Ochs R.L. Keegan K. Hoekstra M. Feunteun J. Livingston D.M. Cell. 1997; 90: 425-435Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar). A large nuclear dot pattern was induced 1 h after cells were treated with IR or UV but disappeared after 5 h. Although weak cytoplasmic dots were recognized by S988 during S phase, UV or IR damage induced a perinuclear dot pattern and nuclear signal. Redistribution of BRCA1 in DNA-damaged cells was confirmed by subcellular fractionation (Fig. 4 B). Nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts of S phase cells were prepared at 1 h post-UV and -IR treatment. Although BRCA1 was predominantly nuclear in untreated S phase cells, DNA damage induced cytoplasmic redistribution of BRCA1. Although BRCA1 was visualized in both chromosome and cytoplasm during mitosis, S988 detected BRCA1 localized to the centrosome and microtubules only during metaphase; BRCA1 localization to the inner structure of the chromosome was also detected during anaphase and telophase. Interestingly, Ser-988-phosphorylated BRCA1 was also detected in the cleavage furrow during telophase and cytokinesis. These results suggest that specific phosphorylation of BRCA1 may be important for the regulation of mitosis. In the present studies, generation of S988, S1423, S1497, and S1524 antibodies enabled us to further investigate the regulation of BRCA1 phosphorylation in different conditions. Our results demonstrate that BRCA1 exists as a heterogeneous species of differentially phosphorylated status and that phosphorylation of each Ser residue examined is specifically induced in cell cycle and in response to DNA damage. Thus, at damaged state, BRCA1 exists as a pool of species with different phosphorylation status. It is likely that phosphorylation of specific residues determines a role and localization of BRCA1 in damaged cells. Human Cds1 kinase (hCds1/Chk2) has been shown to colocalize BRCA1 and phosphorylate Ser-988 residue (12Lee J.S. Collins K.M. Brown A.L. Lee C.H. Chung J.H. Nature. 2000; 404: 201-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). In that study, low dosage of γ-radiation (10 Gy) was sufficient to induce Ser-988 phosphorylation. Our results were consistent with these data in that Ser-988 phosphorylation was detected by 1 Gy of ionizing radiation in MCF7 cells. We also found that phosphorylation of BRCA1 Ser-988 is increased when IR-damaged in S phase (Fig. 2 A), whereas it is not obvious in G2/M phase (Fig. 2 B) although Chk2 kinase can respond to DNA damage throughout the cell cycle (27Matsuoka S. Huang M. Elledge S.J. Science. 1998; 282: 1893-1897Crossref PubMed Scopus (1089) Google Scholar). It remains unclear whether hCds1/Chk2 colocalizes BRCA1 in G2/M phase. Significantly, HCC1937 cells re-expressing wild type BRCA1 have been found to be more resistant after γ-radiation damage than those expressing S988A mutant BRCA1 (12Lee J.S. Collins K.M. Brown A.L. Lee C.H. Chung J.H. Nature. 2000; 404: 201-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). Our studies show that Ser-988 of truncated BRCA1 in HCC1937 cells is similarly phosphorylated with wild type BRCA1 in MCF7 cells. Taken together, these studies provide an implication that the phosphorylation of Ser-988 is not sufficient for damage-resistant phenotype and that the functional C-terminal BRCT domain, which is lost in mutant BRCA1 in HCC1937 cells, plays a crucial role for survival after damage. Several other Ser residues have been identified as potential phosphorylation sites by ATM, including Ser-1387, -1423, -1457, and -1524 (13Cortez D. Wang Y Qin J. Elledge S.J. Science. 1999; 286: 1162-1166Crossref PubMed Scopus (873) Google Scholar, 28Gatei M. Scott S.P. Filippovitch I. Soronika N. Lavin M.F. Weber B. Khanna K.K.

Chem. 2001; 276: 17276-17280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Ser-1423 and -1524 are associated with the regulation of cell growth after IR; HCC1937 cells re-expressing wild type BRCA1 can grow after IR damage, whereas cells expressing a phosphorylation-deficient mutant of these Ser residues show growth retardation under the same condition (13Cortez D. Wang Y Qin J. Elledge S.J. Science. 1999; 286: 1162-1166Crossref PubMed Scopus (873) Google Scholar, 15Scully R. Ganesan S. Vlasakova K. Chen J. Socolovsky M. Livingston D.M. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 1093-1099Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). It is tempting to speculate that the allosteric change of BRCA1 structure because of phosphorylation affects the interaction between BRCA1 and other proteins involved in the DNA damage response. Among them are BRCA2 and the Rad50-Mre11-Nbs complex, but it has been found that damage-dependent phosphorylation does not change the amount of BRCA1 associated with these complexes (30Chen J. Silver D.P. Walpita D. Cantor S.B. Gazdar A.F. Thomlinson G. Couch F.J. Weber B.L. Ashley T. Livingston D.M. Scully R. Mol.

Science. 1999; 285: 747-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). We found that DNA damage induces both nuclear dot pattern and perinuclear distribution of Ser-988-phosphorylated BRCA1. Recently, it was reported that BRCA1 can shuttle between nucleus and cytoplasm and that a Rev-type nuclear export sequence near the N terminus facilitates export through the CRM exporting pathway (32Rodriguez J.A. Henderson B.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38589-38596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). These results have also shown that DNA damage (actinomycin D treatment) resulted in the accumulation of BRCA1 in the cytoplasm, suggesting that DNA damage induces shuttling of the BRCA1 protein, although whether Ser-988 phosphorylation is necessary for the relocalization of the BRCA1 protein remains to be determined. Studies are in progress to elucidate whether Ser-988 can be phosphorylated when export is inhibited by Leptomycin B, a specific inhibitor of CRM-dependent BRCA1 nuclear export1. Antibody 21A8 detected chromosome structure throughout mitosis, and Ser-988-phosphorylated BRCA1 was detected in both cytoplasm and the inner mitotic chromosome in prophase, anaphase, and telophase. In metaphase, centrosome and spindle structures were strongly stained by S988. Although we could not determine precise localization of Ser-988-phosphorylated BRCA1 in the inner chromosome, this localization may represent the mitosis-specific structure, such as the kinetochore. Supporting this hypothesis, BRCA2, which has been shown to colocalize with BRCA1 in mitosis (29Gatei M. Zhou B.B. Hobson K. Scott S. Young D. Khanna K.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17276-17280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), was shown to associate with hBUBR1, a component of the kinetochore CEMP-E/F complex (33Futamura M. Arakawa H. Matsuda K. Katagiri T. Saji S. Miki Y. Nakamura Y. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 1531-1535PubMed Google Scholar). In summary, the present results demonstrate that BRCA1 phosphorylation sites in response to DNA damage are determined by the cell cycle and the dosage of the damage and that BRCA1 exist as a heterogeneous pool of species with differential phosphorylation status even when cell cycle has been synchronized. Our results raised several issues that are potentially important for the tumor suppressive function of BRCA1 in the DNA damage pathway; biochemical details of signaling conferred by phosphorylated BRCA1 will be necessary to understand the role of this protein in this pathway.

https://openalex.org/W1971981484,"The mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) play an important role in a variety of biological processes. Activation of MAPKs is mediated by phosphorylation on specific regulatory tyrosine and threonine sites. We have recently found that activation of p38α MAPK can be carried out not only by its upstream MAPK kinases (MKKs) but also by p38α autophosphorylation. p38α autoactivation requires an interaction of p38α with TAB1 (transforming growth factor-β-activated protein kinase 1-binding protein 1). The autoactivation mechanism of p38α has been found to be important in cellular responses to a number of physiologically relevant stimuli. Here, we report the characterization of a splicing variant of TAB1, TAB1β. TAB1 and TAB1β share the first 10 exons. The 11th and 12th exons of TAB1 were spliced out in TAB1β, and an extra exon, termed exon β, downstream of exons 11 and 12 in the genome was used as the last exon inTAB1β. The mRNA of TAB1β was expressed in all cell lines examined. The TAB1β mRNA encodes a protein with an identical sequence to TAB1 except the C-terminal 69 amino acids were replaced with an unrelated 27-amino acid sequence. Similar to TAB1, TAB1β interacts with p38α but not other MAPKs and stimulates p38α autoactivation. Different from TAB1, TAB1β does not bind or activate TAK1. Inhibition of TAB1β expression with RNA interference in MDA231 breast cancer cells resulted in the reduction of basal activity of p38α and invasiveness of MDA231 cells, suggesting that ΤΑΒ1β is involved in regulating p38α activity in physiological conditions. The mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) play an important role in a variety of biological processes.

The TAB1β mRNA encodes a protein with an identical sequence to TAB1 except the C-terminal 69 amino acids were replaced with an unrelated 27-amino acid sequence. Similar to TAB1, TAB1β interacts with p38α but not other MAPKs and stimulates p38α autoactivation. Different from TAB1, TAB1β does not bind or activate TAK1. Inhibition of TAB1β expression with RNA interference in MDA231 breast cancer cells resulted in the reduction of basal activity of p38α and invasiveness of MDA231 cells, suggesting that ΤΑΒ1β is involved in regulating p38α activity in physiological conditions. mitogen-activated protein kinase MAPK kinase MAPK kinase kinase transforming growth factor-β-activated protein kinase 1-binding protein 1 extracellular signal-regulated kinase 2, MAPK/ERK kinase 1 and 2 c-Jun N-terminal kinase stress-activated protein kinase expressed sequence tag reverse transcription cytomegalovirus monoclonal antibody hemagglutinin glutathione S-transferase myelin basic protein RNA interference tumor necrosis factor protein phosphatase 2C MAPK kinase Big MAPK1 The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)1 signaling pathways have been shown to function in a wide variety of cellular processes, including cell growth, cell migration, cell differentiation, cell death, and immune cell activation (1Waskiewicz A.J.

Whereas the ERK family is activated by growth factors and is involved in cell proliferation, JNK and p38 are predominantly activated in response to pro-inflammatory cytokines and various types of environmental stresses (1Waskiewicz A.J.

A subgroup of MAPKKK, including MEKK1–4, MTK1, MLK1–3, DLK/MUK, ASK1, Tpl-2/Cot, and TAK1, activates the MAPKKs that phosphorylate JNK and perhaps p38 as well (4Pearson G. Robinson F.

Biochemical and genetic evidence have supported the above three-kinase module of MAPK activation (1Waskiewicz A.J. Cooper J.A. Curr. Opin.

Rev. 1999; 79: 143-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (2263) Google Scholar). However, we have recently demonstrated an alternative activation pathway of p38α MAPK that did not require upstream kinases. We found that TAB1 interacts with p38α and leads to the activation of p38α (23Ge B. Gram H. di Padova F. Huang B. New L. Ulevitch R.J. Luo Y. Han J. Science. 2002; 295: 1291-1294Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). TAB1 is a protein that was initially described as an activator of a member of MAPKKK, TAK1, in response to stimulation of transforming growth factor-β (24Shibuya H. Yamaguchi K. Shirakabe K. Tonegawa A. Gotoh Y. Ueno N. Irie K. Nishida E. Matsumoto K. Science. 1996; 272: 1179-1182Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). When ectopically expressed together with TAK1, TAB1 interacts with TAK1 and leads to enhancement of TAK1 activation (24Shibuya H. Yamaguchi K. Shirakabe K. Tonegawa A. Gotoh Y. Ueno N. Irie K.

The C-terminal 68-amino acid portion of TAB1 is sufficient for binding to and activation of TAK1 (24Shibuya H. Yamaguchi K. Shirakabe K. Tonegawa A. Gotoh Y. Ueno N. Irie K. Nishida E. Matsumoto K. Science. 1996; 272: 1179-1182Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar, 25Sakurai H. Miyoshi H. Mizukami J. Sugita T.

Activation of TAK1 by TAB1 is mediated via autophosphorylation of Ser-192 within its kinase activation loop (26Kishimoto K. Matsumoto K. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7359-7364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). We found that TAB1-mediated p38α activation also occurs through an autoactivation mechanism (23Ge B. Gram H. di Padova F. Huang B. New L. Ulevitch R.J. Luo Y. Han J. Science. 2002; 295: 1291-1294Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). However, the portion of the TAB1 protein that is responsible for p38α interaction and activation resides within amino acids 373–418, which is N-terminal to the TAK1 binding site (23Ge B.

In this report we describe the characterization of a splicing variant of TAB1, TAB1β. TAB1β is an alternative splicing product of theTAB1 gene. TAB1β and TAB1 have identical amino acid sequences with the exception of the C terminus. Similar to TAB1, TAB1β interacts with p38α and induces p38α autoactivation. Different from TAB1, TAB1β did not bind with TAK1 and had no effect on TAK1 activation. The present findings suggest that the alternative splicing of TAB1 has a role in intracellular signaling transduction. We completely sequenced two EST clones that showed homologues to TAB1 (clone identification numbers: 50210 and 3049027). One of the clones showed 100% homology with the 5′-end portion of TAB1 cDNA but different 3′-end sequence. This cDNA was termed as TAB1β, and the cDNA sequence has been deposited in GenBankTM (AF425640). The TAB1β coding region was subcloned from a cDNA clone (clone number 50210) into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA) and the pET14 vector (Novagen, Madison, WI), respectively. Other expression vectors, including FLAG-p38, -p38β, -p38γ, -p38δ, -p38(KM), -JNK1, -ERK2, MKK6(E), MKK6(A), MKK3(A), and His-p38, were constructed as described previously (23Ge B.

Total RNA was isolated from HEK293 (293), HPEG2, MDA-231, and RPMI8226 cells using the RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) following the manufacturer's instructions and treated with RNase-free DNase I. Reverse transcription was performed using SuperScript II RT (Invitrogen, Rockville, MA) according to the supplier's specifications. cDNA (1 μl) was amplified by PCR using the Taq Clontech 50xAdvantage 2 DNA polymerase (94 °C for 2 min, 58 °C for 10 s, 68 °C for 30 s, 45 cycles). The upstream oligonucleotide primer used for TAB1 and TAB1β was: 5′-CAATCATCGCAGAGCCAGAAATC-3′ located in exon-8. The downstream primers were: TAB1, 5′-ACGCTCCAGAGGCGGTAAAACTC-3′ in exon-11; TAB1β, 5′-CACTGAGGGATGGCTGTCAAATC-3′ in exon-β (Fig. 1). The obtained RT-PCR fragments for TAB1 and TAB1β were purified and sequenced to confirm their identity. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR was performed using competitive quantitative RT-PCR kits from Ambion (Austin, TX). HEK293 or MDA231 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, and 100 μg/ml penicillin and streptomycin. Cells on six-well plates were transiently transfected with 1 μg (total) of plasmid DNA using LipofectAMINE. After 36 h, the cells were treated with stimuli as described in the text. The plasmid pCMVβ (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) was co-transfected, and transfection efficiency was normalized by quantifying β-galactosidase activity. Total cell lysates were prepared using a lysis buffer A: 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 120 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mm Na3VO4, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 1% Triton X-100. Equal protein loading of cell extracts in SDS-PAGE was determined by Bio-Rad protein assay solution (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) and by staining the transferred nitrocellulose membrane with Ponceau S solution (Sigma, St. Louis, MO). Standard Western blot methods were used (35Han J. Lee J.D. Tobias P.S. Ulevitch R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25009-25014Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Rabbit polyclonal antibodies raised against bacterially expressed recombinant His-p38 protein, rabbit polyclonal antibodies raised against bacterially expressed recombinant His-TAB1β protein, polyclonal goat anti-TAB1 (N-19) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), anti-FLAG M2 mAb (Sigma, St. Louis, MO), anti-HA mAb (12CA5) (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Indianapolis, IN), and anti-phospho p38 (New England BioLabs, Beverley, MA) were used in immunoblotting. Selective viewing of ectopically overexpressed TAB1 and TAB1β by Western blotting was achieved by adjusting exposure time. For co-immunoprecipitation, cell lysates prepared as described above were incubated with anti-FLAG M2 beads (Sigma) and gently shaken for 4 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed three times with lysis buffer and 1 time with 50 mmTris, pH 6.8. Then, the SDS sample buffer (50 μl) was added and heated for 5 min at 100 °C. The supernatant was applied to SDS-PAGE and detected by immunoblotting. Cells were grown on 35-mm-diameter multiwell plates and transiently transfected with GAL4-responsive luciferase plasmid or the NF-κB-dependent luciferase reporter plasmid (36Zhao M. New L. Kravchenko V.V. Kato Y. Gram H. di Padova F. Olson E.N. Ulevitch R.J. Han J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 21-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar, 37Schindler U. Baichwal V.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5820-5831Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A β-galactosidase expression plasmid (pCMV-β-gal, Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) was used to control for transfection efficiency. The total amount of DNA for each transfection was kept constant by using the empty vector pcDNA3. Cell extracts were prepared 36 h later, and β-galactosidase and luciferase activities were measured. GST fusion proteins of TAB1, TAB1β, and MKK4 were expressed in Escherichia colistrain BL21 and purified using glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (AmershamBiosciences, Uppsala, Sweden). All of the His6-tagged recombinant proteins were expressed in the BL21(DE3) strain and purified using the nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid purification system (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Myelin basic protein (MBP) was purchased from Sigma. In vitro kinase assays were carried out at 37 °C for 30 min using ∼0.2 μg of recombinant kinase or recombinant protein, 5 μg of kinase substrate, 250 μm ATP, and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP in 20 μl of kinase reaction buffer. Reactions were terminated by the addition of Laemmli sample buffer. Reaction products were resolved by 12% SDS-PAGE, and the extent of protein phosphorylation was visualized by autoradiography. For the transiently expressed protein, FLAG-p38α protein in 293 cells was immunoprecipitated with anti-M2 beads. After washing three times with lysis buffer and one time with kinase reaction buffer, the beads were further used in the analysis of kinase activity. RNAi constructs were constructed using pSuper vector (38Brummelkamp T.R. Bernards R. Agami R. Science. 1929; 296: 550-553Crossref Scopus (3963) Google Scholar). The hairpin RNA encoded by R1 and R1(M) constructs is shown in Fig. 2 C. The sequences of other RNAi constructs, which cannot decrease in endogenous genes, are available upon request. Each of the pSuper constructs was co-transfected with pSVNeo into breast cancer cell line MDA231, and stable lines were selected by G418 at 1 mg/ml concentration. Cell invasion was analyzed using BIOCOAT Matrigel invasion chambers (BD Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, 2 × 105 cells in 300 μl were added to each chamber and allowed to invade Matrigel for 20 h at 37 °C and 5% CO2 atmosphere. The non-invading cells on the upper surface of the membrane were removed from the chambers, and the invading cells on the lower surface of membrane were stained with a Diff-Quick stain kit (BD Biosciences). After two washes with water, the chambers were allowed to air dry. The number of invading cells was then counted using a phase-contrast microscope. In our study of TAB1, we have sequenced a couple of EST clones that have sequence homology with TAB1. The cDNA of one of the EST clones appeared to be a splicing variant of TAB1; its sequence was 100% identical to TAB1 in the 5′-portion but different at the 3′-end. The protein encoded by this cDNA was termed TAB1β and shown is in Fig. 1 A in comparison with TAB1. The N-terminal sequence of amino acids 1–435 of TAB1β is identical to TAB1. Different from ΤΑΒ1, ΤΑΒ1β lacks the C-terminal 69 amino acids found in TAB1 and has an unrelated 29-amino acid sequence instead (Fig. 1 A). Because the C-terminal 68-amino acid portion of TAB1 was mapped as a TAK1 binding domain (25Sakurai H. Miyoshi H. Mizukami J. Sugita T. FEBS Lett. 2000; 474: 141-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar,28Ono K. Ohtomo T. Sato S. Sugamata Y. Suzuki M. Hisamoto N. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Tsuchiya M. Matsumoto K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24396-24400Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), TAB1β does not have the TAK1 binding domain. To determine whether TAB1 and TAB1β are splicing variants, we analyzed the gene structure in the TAB1 locus. We found that the TAB1 gene is composed of 12 exons.TAB1β shares 1–10 exons with TAB1. Exons 11 and 12 of TAB1 were spliced out in TAB1β, and an exon further downstream termed exon β was the 11th exon ofTAB1β (Fig. 1 B). Thus, the difference between TAB1 and TAB1β is indeed generated by alternative splicing. To investigate the expression of TAB1β in different cells, total RNAs were extracted from HEK293, HPEG2, MDA-231, and RPMI 8226 cells. The existence of TAB1β and TAB1 transcripts was examined by RT-PCR using their specific primers. Both TAB1 and TAB1β transcripts were found in all cell lines tested (Fig. 2 A), suggesting that TAB1 and TAB1β are concurrently expressed. To examine the protein expression of TAB1 and TAB1β, total cell lysates were prepared from HEK293, HEPG2, MDA231, RPMI8226, and MCF-7 cells. The expression of TAB1 or TAB1β was analyzed by Western blotting using anti-TAB1 antibodies. The antibody against a peptide, found in the N terminus of both TAB1 and TAB1β, detected two major protein bands in Western blotting analysis (Fig. 2 B,left panel). The same result was obtained with an antibody that was raised by using recombinant TAB1β protein (data not shown). We overexpressed TAB1 and TAB1β in 293 cells and detected the ectopically expressed TAB1 and TAB1β by Western blotting (Fig. 2 B, right panel). Comparison of the migrations of endogenous proteins detected by the anti-TAB1/TAB1β antibodies with the ectopically expressed TAB1 and TAB1β gives no indication which protein band or bands are TAB1 or TAB1β, because there was a higher molecular weight band of endogenous protein that could be post-translationally modified TAB1 or TAB1β or could even be another TAB1 isoform. We have tried to raise TAB1- and TAB1β-specific antibodies using C-terminal peptides from TAB1 and TAB1β. Because the difference between TAB1 and TAB1β is very limited (29 and 69 amino acids), there were not many peptide sequences that could be chosen to generate antibodies. As a result, we have not generated any antibodies that can selectively detect TAB1 or TAB1β. We cannot formally conclude whether TAB1 and/or TAB1β were expressed as protein in cells by the Western blotting analysis shown in Fig. 2 B, but the protein expression of at least one of TAB1 isoforms was confirmed. RNA interference (RNAi) is the process of gene silencing whereby double-stranded RNA induces the homology-dependent degradation of its cognate mRNA. We designed RNAi constructs to target TAB1 and TAB1β using the method of Brummelkamp et al. (38Brummelkamp T.R. Bernards R. Agami R. Science. 1929; 296: 550-553Crossref Scopus (3963) Google Scholar) and stably transfected these constructs into MDA231 cells. Stable transfection of the RNAi constructs, which target the common region of TAB1 and TAB1β, and the specific region of TAB1 did not affect the expression of TAB1s in MDA231 cells (data not shown). Transfection of R1 (Fig. 2 C), one of the RNAi constructs that were designed to target TAB1β, resulted in reduction of the expression of the upper-band protein detected by anti-TAB1 antibody (Fig. 2 D). In contrast, transfection of R1(M), which had a single point mutant in comparison with R1 (Fig. 2 C), did not produce any effect, indicating the specificity of the RNAi effect. The other two RNAi constructs that were designed to target TAB1β also had no effect on TAB1β expression. These results indicated that the upper band is TAB1β. Because the apparent molecular weight of endogenous TAB1β is higher than ectopically expressed TAB1β (Fig. 2,B and D), the endogenous TAB1β is most likely being post-translationally modified. The reduction of TAB1β protein by R1 is specific, because the protein level of the lower band, which is most likely to be TAB1, and p38α were not affected by R1 (Fig. 2 D). To further confirm that R1 selectively targeted TAB1β mRNA, we examined mRNA expression of TAB1 and TAB1β by competitive quantitative RT-PCR using their specific primers. The cells stably transfected with R1, but not with R1(M) or empty vector, had reduced TAB1β mRNA (Fig. 2 E), confirming that R1 specifically mediated a reduction of TAB1β mRNA. Thus, TAB1β protein is expressed in cells. Our previous studies have demonstrated that the TAB1 protein interacts with p38α (23Ge B. Gram H. di Padova F. Huang B. New L. Ulevitch R.J. Luo Y. Han J. Science. 2002; 295: 1291-1294Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). To find out if the TAB1β interacts with p38α, expression plasmids encoding TAB1β, TAB1, and FLAG-p38α were co-transfected into 293 cells. The FLAG-p38α was precipitated with agarose beads conjugated with anti-FLAG antibody (M2), and the existence of TAB1 in the immunoprecipitation complexes was detected by immunoblotting with anti-TAB1 antibody. The results showed that both TAB1β and TAB1 bind with p38α (Fig. 3 A). To investigate the specificity of the interaction between TAB1β and p38α, we first tested if TAB1β could interact with three other p38 isoforms. As shown in Fig. 3 B, a small amount of TAB1β was pulled down by p38γ but not by p38β or p38δ. The expression level of p38γ was higher than any other p38 subfamily members (Fig. 3 B, middle panel, and data not shown), but the amount of TAB1β pulled down with p38γ was very little in comparison with p38α (Fig. 3, A and B), so the affinity of TAB1β and p38γ should be much smaller than TAB1β and p38α. We next evaluated whether there is interaction between TAB1β with the other two MAPKs, JNK1 and ERK2. The results demonstrated that TAB1 bound strongly with p38α but not with ERK2 or JNK1 (Fig. 3 C). TAB1 was originally identified as a binding protein of TAK1. It promotes the TAK1 kinase activation through the binding with TAK1. The sequence data shown in Fig. 1 A suggest that TAB1β does not have a TAK1 binding domain, however, whether TAB1β can interact with TAK1 needs to be examined. We transfected the HA-TAK1, TAB1, and TAB1β expression plasmids into 293 cells. Immunoprecipitation was performed with agarose beads conjugated with anti-HA antibody. The immunoprecipitates were immunoblotted with anti-TAB1 antibody. We found that immunoprecipitation of TAK1 pulled down TAB1 but not TAB1β (Fig. 3 D), indicating that there was no interaction between TAB1β and TAK1. These data agree with domain mapping of TAB1 reported by other groups and indicate that TAB1β only interacts with p38α and not TAK1. It has been shown that interaction of TAB1 with p38α resulted in autoactivation of p38α (23Ge B. Gram H. di Padova F. Huang B. New L. Ulevitch R.J. Luo Y. Han J. Science. 2002; 295: 1291-1294Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). We next evaluated the ability of TAB1β to activate p38α. The expression plasmids of TAB1β, TAB1, and p38α were co-transformed into 293 cells in different combinations, and the extent of p38α dual phosphorylation was examined by immunoblotting using anti-phospho-p38 antibody. As we reported previously, co-expression of TAB1 with p38α in cells led to p38α phosphorylation; expression of TAB1β also led to the phosphorylation of p38α (Fig. 4 A). To ensure that the phosphorylation of p38α detected by anti-phospho-p38 antibody indeed represented p38α activity, FLAG-p38α protein was immunoprecipitated by using anti-FLAG M2 beads and further analyzed by in vitrokinase assay using MBP as a substrate. The increase of p38α dual phosp"

Heat shock induced phosphorylation of p53 at serine 15 in an ATM kinase-dependent fashion, which may contribute partially to heat-induced p53 accumulation. However, p53 accumulation also occurred after heat shock in ATM-deficient cells. Heat shock induced conformational change of wild type p53 and binding to hsp90. Inhibition of hsp90-p53 interaction by geldanamycin prevented p53 accumulation partially in ATM-wild type cells and completely in ATM-deficient cells.

In normal cells, p53 is maintained at a very low level because of rapid degradation through the ubiquitin-dependent proteasome pathway (1Prives C. Hall P.A. J. Pathol. 1999; 187: 112-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (1233) Google Scholar). In response to different stress stimuli including ionizing radiation, UV, and hypoxia, p53 is activated and stabilized as a transcription factor. Activated p53 induces the expression ofp21WAF1, gadd45, bax,p53AIP, PUMA, and others, which in turn induce cell cycle arrest and apoptosis (2Balint E. Vousden K.H. Br. J. Cancer. 2002; 85: 1813-1823Crossref Scopus (254) Google Scholar). The level of p53 in cells is mainly regulated at the post-transcriptional level by the MDM21 oncoprotein. MDM2 binds to p53 and promotes its ubiquitination by acting as a ubiquitin E3 ligase (3Haupt Y. Maya R. Kazaz A. Oren M. Nature. 1997; 387: 296-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (3722) Google Scholar, 4Kubbutat M.H.G. Jones S.N. Vousden K.H. Nature. 1997; 387: 299-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (2847) Google Scholar, 5Honda R.

EMBO J. 1993; 12: 461-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (1178) Google Scholar), forming a negative feedback loop to maintain p53 at low levels. To date, most stress signals that activate p53 are known to interfere with the ability of MDM2 to promote p53 degradation by phosphorylation of p53, induction of the MDM2 inhibitor ARF, or inhibition of MDM2 expression (1Prives C. Hall P.A. J. Pathol. 1999; 187: 112-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (1233) Google Scholar, 2Balint E. Vousden K.H. Br. J. Cancer. 2002; 85: 1813-1823Crossref Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of MDM2 by ATM may also play a role in p53 activation after DNA damage (8Maya R. Balass M. Kim S.T. Shkedy D. Leal J.F. Shifman O. Moas M. Buschmann T. Ronai Z. Shiloh Y. Kastan M.B.

Heat shock is clinically useful in facilitating the treatment of certain tumors such as gliomas in combination with chemotherapy or ionizing radiation (18Witkamp A.J. de Bree E. Van Goethem R. Zoetmulder F.A. Cancer Treat. Rev. 2002; 27: 365-374Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 19Takahashi I. Emi Y. Hasuda S. Kakeji Y. Maehara Y. Sugimachi K.

Therefore, investigating the mechanism of p53 accumulation after heat shock is important in understanding p53 response to a physiologically relevant stress. A previous study (22McCormick W. Penman S. J. Mol. Biol. 1969; 39: 315-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar) suggests that p53 accumulation in response to heat is not the result of a general stress-induced increase in protein synthesis, because heat causes a reduction in overall cellular protein synthesis. Heat shock has been reported to induce DNA damage (21Minisini M.P. Kantengwa S. Polla B.S. Mutat. Res. 1994; 315: 169-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), suggesting that it may stabilize and activate p53 in part through the DNA damage response pathways. A recent study shows (15Ohnishi T. Wang X. Ohnishi K. Matsumoto H. Takahashi A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14510-14513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) an increase in p53 mRNA level after heat treatment of A-172 glioma cells, suggesting a mechanism of induction at the transcriptional level. Stabilization of p53 also occurs in tumor cells with mutated p53, which result in an accumulation to high levels. Missense mutations of p53 in the DNA-binding core domain cause conformational change and stable association with molecular chaperones such as hsp70 and hsp90 (23Hinds P.W. Finlay C.A. Frey A.B. Levine A.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2863-2869Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 24Selkirk J.K. Merrick B.A. Stackhouse B.L. He C. Appl. Theor. Electrophor. 1994; 4: 11-18PubMed Google Scholar). hsp90 binding has been shown to contribute to the accumulation of mutant p53 and many other client proteins (25Nagata Y. Anan T. Yoshida T.

Chem. 2001; 276: 6874-6878Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 29Peng Y. Chen L., Li, C., Lu, W. Chen J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40583-40590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) that binding of hsp90 inhibits the ability of MDM2 to promote p53 ubiquitination and degradation, resulting in the stabilization of both mutant p53 and MDM2. hsp90 appears to inactivate MDM2 by blocking the central domain of MDM2 normally involved in regulation by ARF, thereby mimicking the effect of ARF to prevent mutant p53 degradation (29Peng Y. Chen L., Li, C., Lu, W. Chen J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40583-40590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Although the role of hsp90 in mutant p53 stabilization is well established, there is no evidence to date that it contributes to the stabilization of wild type p53 during stress. Molecular chaperones only associate with certain proteins in a transient manner during folding or during heat shock response. Wild type p53 does not form stable complex with hsp90 in normal growth conditions. Because DNA damage does not induce p53 conformational change, hsp90 is unlikely to play a role in DNA damage response. However, p53 is a structurally unstable protein and undergoes conformational change (denaturation) at temperatures above 40 °C in vitro (30Bullock A.N. Henckel J. DeDecker B.S. Johnson C.M. Nikolova P.V. Proctor M.R. Lane D.P. Fersht A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14338-14342Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). Work by Graeber et al. (31Graeber T.G. Peterson J.F. Tsai M. Monica K. Fornace A.J., Jr. Giaccia A.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6264-6277Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) also indicates that heat shock alters the conformation of wild type p53, allowing the formation of the p53·hsc70 complex. Therefore, it is possible that hsp90 binding also interacts with wild type p53 after heat shock and plays a role in stabilizing p53 through mechanisms similar to the stabilization of mutant p53. In this study, we investigated the role of p53 conformational change and interaction with hsp90 in the stabilization of p53 after heat shock. Furthermore, we examined the phosphorylation status of p53 after heat shock treatment. Our results showed that heat shock induced p53 accumulation by promoting ATM-dependent serine 15 phosphorylation and complex formation with hsp90. Both mechanisms contribute to p53 stabilization after heat shock. Our results identified the first example of hsp90 participation in regulating wild type p53 stress response. Tumor cell lines A-172 (glioblastoma, wt p53), U2OS (osteosarcoma, wtp53), DLD-1 (colon carcinoma, mt p53241S-F) were obtained from the ATCC. MCF-7 (breast tumor, wt p53) cells were provided by Dr. Arnold J. Levine. Epstein-Barr Virus-immortalized human lymphocyte from normal control (NC-607) and ATM patient (AT-29) were kindly provided by Dr. Kevin Brown (Louisiana State University Health Science Center). A-172, MCF-7, U2OS, H1299, and DLD-1 were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum. NC-607 and AT-29 cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium with 20% fetal bovine serum. Geldanamycin (Sigma) and okadaic acid (LC Laboratories) were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide at 1 mm and used at 4 μmand 0.1 μg/ml, respectively. MG132 was dissolved in ethanol and used at a working concentration of 30 μm for 5 h. Cells growing exponentially in 10-cm dishes at 37 °C were transferred to a CO2 incubator at 43 °C for 2 h. After heat shock, the cells were cultured in a CO2 incubator at 37 °C for various periods. Cells were lysed in radioimmune precipitation buffer (1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 50 mm Tris pH 7.4, 150 mmNaCl, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and 20–100 μg of protein were fractionated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to Immobilon P filters (Millipore). The filter was blocked for 1 h with PBS containing 5% nonfat dry milk, 0.1% Tween 20 and then incubated for 1 h with 3G9 (MDM2) (32Chen J. Marechal V. Levine A.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4107-4114Crossref PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar) or DO-1 (p53, BD Biosciences) in PBS containing 5% nonfat dry milk. Bound primary antibody was detected by incubating for 1 h with HRP goat-anti-mouse IgG or HRP-protein A. The filter was developed using the ECL-Plus reagent (Amersham Biosciences). hsp90 was detected with a mouse anti-hsp90 antibody (StressGen). P53 phosphorylation was analyzed for Ser-9, Ser-15, Ser-20, Ser-37, Ser-46, and Ser-392 using anti-phospho-p53 polyclonal antibodies (Cell Signaling Technology). For immunoprecipitation-Western blot analysis, cells were lysed in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) containing 10 mm molybdate (to stabilize p53·hsp90 complex), and 1000 μg of protein were precleared with protein A-Sepharose beads (Sigma) and immunoprecipitated with p53 antibody Pab1801, Pab1620, and Pab240 for 4 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed with lysis buffer, and the immunoprecipitate was fractionated by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blot for p53 or hsp90. For detection of ubiquitinated p53 by Western blot, the cells were lysed with Laemmli SDS sample buffer and immediately boiled for 3 min. Before subjecting to SDS-PAGE, the lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. Total cellular RNA was isolated using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen). Twenty micrograms of total RNA were fractionated on a formaldehyde denaturing gel and transferred onto a Biotrans membrane (ICN). The filter was hybridized with a random-primed probe synthesized using a p53 cDNA fragment. Hybridization was carried out in a buffer containing 1% SDS, 1 m NaCl, and 10% dextransulfate for 18 h at 65 °C. The filter was washed with 2× SSC buffer (0.3 m NaCl, 0.03 m sodium citrate) and exposed against film. For detection of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA (glyceraldehyde-phosphate dehydrogenase), the filter was stripped and rehybridized with a full-length 1.2-kilobase human glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase cDNA probe. Cells cultured on chamber slides were fixed with acetone/methanol (1:1) for 3 min at room temperature, blocked with PBS containing 10% normal goat serum for 20 min, and incubated with anti-p53 monoclonal antibody Pab1801 and rabbit anti-MDM2 polyclonal serum in PBS with 10% normal goat serum for 2 h. The slides were washed with PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100, incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled goat-anti-mouse IgG and rhodamine-labeled goat-anti-rabbit IgG in PBS with 10% normal goat serum for 1 h, washed with PBS with 0.1% Triton X-100, and mounted. To determine the effect of heat shock on p53 and MDM2 expression levels, A-172 cells were incubated at 43 °C for 2 h and then returned to 37 °C for 4–16 h. The protein levels of p53 and MDM2 were measured by Western blot. The results showed that p53 and MDM2 levels increased significantly 4 h after heat shock (Fig. 1, A and B). Quantitation of the level of p53 by loading titration indicated that heat shock caused a 6 to 8-fold increase in p53 level 4 h after termination of heat treatment (data not shown). We found that p53 levels were also induced by heat shock in two other cell lines, U2OS and MCF-7 (data not shown). We also examined the localization of p53 and MDM2 in A-172 cells after heat shock by immunofluorescence staining. The results confirmed the increase of p53 and MDM2 levels 4 h after heat shock and showed that p53 mainly accumulated in the nucleus under our experimental conditions (Fig. 1 C). To investigate the mechanism of p53 accumulation, the mRNA levels of p53 were determined by Northern blot. The results showed that p53 mRNA level in A-172 and MCF-7 cells did not change after heat shock (Fig. 2 A). Therefore, increased p53 protein expression was not attributed to increase in transcription. To test whether p53 was stabilized after heat shock, A-172 cells were treated with heat shock and the proteasome inhibitor MG132. The magnitude of p53 accumulation after MG132 treatment provided an indication of how rapidly p53 was degraded by ubiquitin-dependent proteasomes. The result showed that in control cells, a 4-h treatment with MG132 caused a significant increase in p53 level. However, after heat shock, MG132 treatment did not lead to further increase of p53 level compared with heat shock alone (Fig. 2 B), indicating that it was already stabilized. This suggested that the increased p53 level was because of reduced p53 degradation by the proteasomes. Because p53 turnover is regulated by MDM2-mediated ubiquitination, we examined the level of p53 ubiquitination by direct lysis in SDS sample buffer, which preserved polyubiquitinated forms of p53. Western blot of such lysate showed that the high molecular weight bands of ubiquitinated p53 were significantly reduced immediately after heat shock (Fig. 2 C). There was significant recovery of p53 ubiquitination at 4 h after heat shock, which may be because of high level MDM2 expression at this time point and the start of a recovery process (Fig. 1 B). Therefore, the ability of MDM2 to promote p53 ubiquitination was inhibited after heat shock, consistent with the increase in p53 stability. Because it is well established that the stability of p53 is regulated by phosphorylation, we examined the phosphorylation status of p53 at several different sites after heat shock. The DNA-damaging agent CPT was used as a positive control. Furthermore, to control for the increased levels of p53 protein after heat shock, we also used MG132 treatment to induce p53 accumulation at 37 °C. Antibodies recognizing different phosphorylated serine residues on p53 were used in Western blot detection of phosphorylated p53. The results showed significant increase of phosphorylation level at Ser-15 after heat shock (Fig. 3). Phosphorylation of Ser-20 was also reproducibly induced by heat shock, although it was less than that induced by CPT treatment. The phosphorylation level of Ser-46 was induced by CPT but not by heat shock. The anti-phospho-Ser-392 antibody also did not detect a change after heat shock (Fig. 3), whereas the UV irradiation control induced moderate increase in signal as expected (Fig. 3, bottom panels) (33Lu H. Taya Y. Ikeda M. Levine A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6399-6402Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). The results of Ser-9 and Ser-37 phosphorylation were uninformative because they were not induced by heat shock or the CPT control (data not shown). In summary, heat shock selectively induced phosphorylation of p53 at Ser-15 and Ser-20, suggesting the involvement of ATM and human Chk2 kinases. Ser-15 phosphorylation of p53 after DNA damage is carried out by the ATM kinase (34Banin S. Moyal L. Shieh S.-Y. Taya Y. Anderson C.W. Chessa L. Smorodinsky N.I. Prives C. Reiss Y. Shiloh Y. Ziv Y. Science. 1998; 281: 1674-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (1706) Google Scholar). Therefore, we investigated the role of ATM in Ser-15 phosphorylation after heat shock using immortalized lymphocytes derived from normal (NC-607) and AT patients (AT-29). The results showed that Ser-15 phosphorylation was not induced by heat shock in ATM-deficient lymphocytes, whereas strong induction was observed in normal lymphocytes (Fig. 4). Therefore, Ser-15 phosphorylation after heat shock was dependent on ATM kinase. Similar to A-172 cells, heat shock also caused over 3-fold induction of p53 protein level in normal lymphocytes. Although Ser-15 phosphorylation level did not change in ATM-deficient lymphocytes after heat shock, p53 level was still moderately increased (<3-fold) (Fig. 4). Therefore, phosphorylation of Ser-15 by ATM contributed to but was not absolutely required for p53 accumulation after heat shock. This result also suggested that additional mechanisms contribute to p53 stabilization after heat shock. To test the hypothesis that heat shock caused wild type p53 conformational change, p53 was precipitated by mutant-specific Pab240 and wild type-specific Pab1620 antibodies (35Gannon J.V. Greaves R. Iggo R. Lane D.P. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1595-1602Crossref PubMed Scopus (943) Google Scholar). Pab240 recognizes hydrophobic peptide sequences of p53 normally packed inside the DNA-binding core domain (36Cho Y. Gorina S. Jeffrey P.D. Pavletich N.P. Science. 1994; 265: 346-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (2150) Google Scholar); therefore, the exposure of the Pab240 epitope is indicative of misfolded p53. The result showed that in control A-172 cells, p53 could be precipitated efficiently by Pab1620 but weakly by Pab240 (Fig. 5 A). Conversely, heat shock significantly increased reaction with Pab240 when the cells were harvested 2 h after heat shock treatment (Fig. 5 A), although a significant fraction of p53 also retained Pab1620 reactivity. At 4 h after heat shock, which was the highest point of p53 accumulation, p53 reactivity to Pab1620 increased strongly and Pab240 reactivity reduced significantly. Therefore, there was rapid recovery of p53 conformation back to the wild type status after heat shock. The result also showed that change of p53 conformation correlated with the level of p53 ubiquitination (Fig. 2 C). Immediately after heat shock, there was significant reduction of ubiquitinated p53 species, which recovered to near control level 4 h after heat shock. Therefore, change in p53 conformation may also play a role in stabilizing p53. hsp90 binding is important for preventing degradation of many cellular proteins including mutant p53. Disruption of hsp90 mutant p53 binding leads to destabilization of p53 through ubiquitin-dependent proteasomes (25Nagata Y. Anan T. Yoshida T. Mizukami T. Taya Y. Fujiwara T. Kato H. Saya H. Nakao M. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6037-6049Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 27Whitesell L. Sutphin P.D. Pulcini E.J. Martinez J.D. Cook P.H. Mol. Cell.

Because heat shock induced significant conformational change in wild type p53, we asked whether hsp90 also regulates wild type p53 stability by binding to p53 and preventing its degradation by MDM2. To test the binding between hsp90 and p53, conformation-independent Pab1801 antibody was used to precipitate p53 from cell lysate harvested 2 and 4 h after heat shock. Coprecipitated hsp90 was detected by Western blot of the p53 precipitate using hsp90-specific antibody. The results showed that hsp90 did not coprecipitate with wild type p53 in the control A-172 cultures without heat shock treatment (Fig. 5 B). However, significant amounts of hsp90 coprecipitated with the mutant p53 protein in DLD-1 cells at 37 °C and also with wild type p53 in the heat-treated A-172 cells (Fig. 5 B). The binding between p53 and hsp90 was stronger at 2 h after heat shock than 4 h, because more p53 was present in the 4-h lysate yet the amount of hsp90 coprecipitated did not increase (Fig. 5 B). This was consistent with the significant recovery of wild type p53 conformation and ubiquitination level observed at this time point. Therefore, heat shock induced transient association between wild type p53 and hsp90. Binding between hsp90 and mutant p53 is known to cause p53 stabilization (25Nagata Y. Anan T. Yoshida T.

Therefore, we examined the role of hsp90 on wild type p53 stability after heat shock. A-172, NC-607, and AT-29 cells were treated with heat shock in the presence or absence of the hsp90 inhibitor geldanamycin. The level of p53 was measured by Western blot 4 h after heat shock. The results showed that without heat shock, geldanamycin treatment did not significantly affect p53 level. However, geldanamycin prevented the accumulation of p53 after heat shock in ATM-deficient AT-29 cells (Fig. 6 A), suggesting that hsp90 function was important for p53 accumulation. The inhibitory effect of geldanamycin was not as complete in A-172 and NC-607 cells, probably because ATM-mediated phosphorylation also contributed to p53 stabilization. Geldanamycin binds to the ATP-binding site of hsp90 and often reduces its binding to client proteins (26Buchner J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 136-141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar). To confirm that geldanamycin blocked hsp90-p53 binding after heat shock, A-172, NC-607, and AT-29 cells were treated with heat shock and geldanamycin. hsp90-p53 binding was detected by p53 immunoprecipitation followed by hsp90 Western blot. The result showed that geldanamycin treatment reduced hsp90-p53 coprecipitation in the three cell lines (Fig. 6 B). Therefore, inhibition of hsp90-p53 binding after heat shock prevented p53 accumulation. The results described above show that short term exposure to elevated temperature causes accumulation and activation of wild type p53. Increased p53 expression level is not because of induction of p53 transcription, because its mRNA level does not change after heat stress. Similar to other forms of p53 stress response, reduced ubiquitination and degradation appears to be the major cause of its accumulation after heat shock. The stabilized p53 is functional in inducing expression of downstream target genes and has been shown to contribute to cell cycle arrest or apoptosis response after heat shock (13Nitta M. Okamura H. Aizawa S. Yamaizumi M. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 561-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 15Ohnishi T. Wang X. Ohnishi K. Matsumoto H. Takahashi A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14510-14513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Therefore, p53 activation after heat shock is a functionally relevant response to environmental stress. Ubiquitination and degradation of p53 is mainly regulated by MDM2. Many p53 responses to environmental or cellular stresses cause p53 stabilization by interfering with MDM2 function. Phosphorylation of p53 and MDM2, inhibition of MDM2 expression, and inactivation of MDM2 by expression of ARF have all been implicated in wild type p53 accumulation (1Prives C. Hall P.A. J. Pathol. 1999; 187: 112-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (1233) Google Scholar, 38Zhang Y. Xiong Y. Cell Growth Differ. 2001; 12: 175-186PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, stabilization of mutant p53 involves binding to molecular chaperones hsp90 (25Nagata Y. Anan T. Yoshida T. Mizukami T. Taya Y. Fujiwara T. Kato H. Saya H. Nakao M. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6037-6049Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 27Whitesell L. Sutphin P.D. Pulcini E.J. Martinez J.D. Cook P.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1517-1524Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 37Blagosklonny M.V. Toretsky J. Neckers L. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 933-939PubMed Google Scholar). hsp90-mutant p53 complex is resistant to MDM2-mediated ubiquitination and degradation, because MDM2 bound to p53 in such a complex is inactivated by hsp90 (29Peng Y. Chen L., Li, C., Lu, W. Chen J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40583-40590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). hsp90 appears to conceal the ARF binding site on MDM2 in hsp90·p53·MDM2 complexes and prevent MDM2 from ubiquitinating p53 and itself. As a result, both MDM2 and mutant p53 become stabilized in tumor cells expressing mutant p53 (28Peng Y. Chen L., Li, C., Lu, W. Agrawal S. Chen J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6874-6878Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). We previously showed that dissociation of hsp90 by geldanamycin treatment restores the ubiquitination and degradation of mutant p53 (29Peng Y. Chen L., Li, C., Lu, W. Chen J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40583-40590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Therefore, hsp90-mutant p53 complex also causes p53 stabilization by interfering with MDM2 activity. Molecular chaperones such as hsp70 and hsp90 recognize exposed hydrophobic regions in misfolded proteins, nascent polypeptides, and ligand binding sites of steroid hormone receptors (26Buchner J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 136-141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar, 39Pearl L.H. Prodromou C. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2001; 10: 46-51Crossref Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Wild type p53 is a structurally unstable protein and readily undergoes conformational change above 40 °C in vitro (30Bullock A.N. Henckel J. DeDecker B.S. Johnson C.M. Nikolova P.V. Proctor M.R. Lane D.P. Fersht A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14338-14342Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). Point mutations in the DNA-binding domain disrupt proper folding and cause structural change at physiological temperatures. Different mutations lead to different temperature sensitivities; some mutations (such as the Val-138) remain functional and conformationally wild type at 32 °C and lose activity at 39 °C (40Pochampally R. Fodera B. Chen L., Lu, W. Chen J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15271-15277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Many hot spot mutations found in human tumors cause significant conformational changes and complete loss of activity at physiological temperature (41Friedlander P. Legros Y. Soussi T. Prives C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25468-25478Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is conceivable that heat shock also causes transient conformational change of wild type p53 similar to the misfolding caused by structural mutations, resulting in binding by hsp90. We suggest that heat shock causes a transient misfolding of wild type p53, which attracts binding by hsp90. hsp90 binding would prevent p53 aggregation and facilitate the refolding process. However, hsp90 binding would also prevent MDM2-mediated degradation in a manner similar to stabilization of mutant p53 by hsp90 at 37 °C. Unlike mutant p53, which cannot fold properly even in the presence of molecular chaperones, heat-denatured wild type p53 can be efficiently refolded by chaperones at 37 °C. Therefore, the conformational change after heat shock is transient, and p53 level begins to decrease several hours after heat shock. This correlates with return of normal p53 ubiquitination level. However, hsp90 appears not to be the only regulator of p53 stabilization after heat shock, because the hsp90 inhibitor geldanamycin did not cause a complete block in p53 accumulation in ATM wild type cell lines. We found that heat shock also induced phosphorylation of p53 at Ser-15 and Ser-20, which are sites important for regulating the stability and transcription activity of p53 (1Prives C. Hall P.A. J. Pathol. 1999; 187: 112-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (1233) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of Ser-15 and Ser-20 is dependent on ATM kinase activity and ATM-mediated activation of human Chk2 kinase, suggesting that heat shock can activate the ATM kinase and induce p53 accumulation in part through phosphorylation. A previous study (21Minisini M.P. Kantengwa S. Polla B.S. Mutat. Res. 1994; 315: 169-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) shows that heat shock causes low levels of DNA damage. Our results also showed that heat shock only induced phosphorylation of p53 on Ser-15 and Ser-20, whereas the DNA-damaging agent camptothecin induced stronger phosphorylation of Ser-15 and Ser-20 as well as an additional phosphorylation at Ser-46. This is consistent with the requirement of severe DNA damage for inducing Ser-46 phosphorylation (42Oda K. Arakawa H. Tanaka T. Matsuda K. Tanikawa C. Mori T. Nishimori H. Tamai K. Tokino T. Nakamura Y. Taya Y. Cell. 2000; 102: 849-862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1027) Google Scholar). Therefore, heat shock may activate ATM through inducing low level of DNA damage, which in turn activates p53 by phosphorylation of p53 or MDM2 (8Maya R. Balass M. Kim S.T. Shkedy D. Leal J.F. Shifman O. Moas M. Buschmann T. Ronai Z. Shiloh Y. Kastan M.B. Katzir E. Oren M. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1067-1077Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). DNA damage-mediated dephosphorylation of MDM2-acidic domain may also play a role in stabilization of p53 (43Blattner C. Hay T. Meek D.W. Lane D.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 6170-6182Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). During the course or our study, Miyakoda et al. (17Miyakoda M. Suzuki K. Kodama S. Watanabe M. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 1090-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) also reported that phosphorylation of p53 at Ser-15 occurs after heat shock in an ATM-dependent fashion, which is consistent with our finding. In summary, ATM-mediated phosphorylation and conformation-mediated hsp90 binding cooperate to cause p53 accumulation in response to heat stress. Our results identify the first example in which hsp90 plays a role in regulating wild type p53 stability in response to stress. Conformational change of p53 has been suggested to occur in the absence of heat stress based on change of reactivity to conformation-specific antibodies (44Zhang W. Hu G. Estey E. Hester J. Deisseroth A. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 1645-1647PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, it will be interesting to further investigate whether hsp90 plays a role in regulating p53 stability in other physiological processes. We would like to thank Dr. Kevin Brown for providing the ATM-deficient cells."

We examined the effect of Ras on RhoA activity in NIH 3T3 cells either stably transfected with H-Ras(V12) under control of an inducible promoter or transiently expressing the activated H-Ras. Using a novel method to quantitate enzymatically the GTP bound to Rho, we found that expression of the oncogenic Ras increased Rho activity ∼2-fold. Increased Rho activity was associated with increased plasma membrane binding of RhoA and decreased activity of the Rho/Ras-regulated p21WAF1/CIP1 promoter. RhoA activation by oncogenic Ras could be explained by a decrease in cytosolic p190 Rho-GAP activity and translocation of p190 Rho-GAP from the cytosol to a detergent-insoluble cytoskeletal fraction. Pharmacologic inhibition of the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway prevented Ras-induced activation of RhoA and translocation of p190 Rho-GAP; expression of constitutively active Raf-1 kinase or MEK was sufficient to induce p190 Rho-GAP translocation.

Although there are no reports of activating mutations of Rho proteins in human tumors, several Rho proteins are overexpressed in tumors, and Rho family-activating guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) have been isolated in screens for transforming genes, suggesting a role of Rho proteins in tumorigenesis (4Sahai E. Marshall C.J. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 133-142Google Scholar). Members of the Rho family regulate the actin cytoskeleton, thereby affecting cell morphology and motility; in addition, they modulate gene expression, cell cycle progression, and cell survival (1Takai Y. Sasaki T. Matozaki T. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 153-208Google Scholar, 4Sahai E. Marshall C.J. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 133-142Google Scholar, 5Kjoller L. Hall A. Exp.

RhoA, B, and C and Rac1 play critical roles in cell transformation induced by activated, oncogenic Ras, with dominant negative Rho and Rac1 constructs inhibiting Ras-induced transformation and constitutively active constructs inducing anchorage-independent growth and other features of the transformed phenotype (4Sahai E.

The requirement of Rho for Ras-induced transformation exists in part because Ras and Rho play opposing roles in control of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21WAF1/CIP1, with Ras inducing and Rho inhibiting p21WAF1/CIP1 transcription; thus increased Ras activity actually blocks cell cycle progression when Rho signaling is inhibited by C3 exoenzyme (8Sahai E.

Microinjection or transient transfection of oncogenic H-Ras(V12) into Swiss 3T3 cells leads to acute cytoskeletal changes, suggesting a hierarchal system with Ras activating Rac (causing membrane ruffling) and Rac in turn activating RhoA (causing induction of stress fibers); however, these studies were performed before direct measures of Rac and Rho·GTP levels were available (12Nobes C.D. Hall A. Cell. 1995; 81: 53-62Google Scholar, 13Ridley A.J. Paterson H.F. Johnston C.L. Diekmann D. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 401-410Google Scholar). Ras activation of Rac can occur through the Ras effector phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, with increased phosphoinositides activating a multimolecular complex including a Rac-activating GEF (19Scita G. Tenca P. Frittoli E. Tocchetti A. Innocenti M. Giardina G. Di Fiore P.P. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2393-2398Google Scholar, 20Nimnual A.S. Yatsula B.A. Bar-Sagi D.

How Rac activation can lead to activation of RhoA is less clear, but it may involve Rac activation of phospholipase A2 with subsequent arachidonic acid and leukotriene production, at least in Swiss 3T3 cells (22Peppelenbosch M.P. Qiu R.G. Vries-Smits A.M. Tertoolen L.G. de Laat S.W. McCormick F. Hall A. Symons M.H. Bos J.L. Cell. 1995; 81: 849-856Google Scholar). In contrast to the acute response to oncogenic Ras, studies in Ras-transformed cell lines have produced conflicting results, with some studies reporting decreased Rac and increased RhoA activation compared with nontransformed cells, and others reporting increased activation of both GTPases or no changes (8Sahai E.

In v-H-Ras-transformed MDCK cells, decreased Rac activity appeared to be secondary to transcriptional down-regulation of the Rac-specific GEF Tiam1; the mechanism for increased RhoA activation was not elucidated, but the effect of oncogenic Ras on RhoA and Rac activity was mimicked by stable transfection of constitutively active Raf (16Zondag G.C. Evers E.E. ten Klooster J.P. Janssen L. van der Kammen R.A. Collard J.G. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 775-782Google Scholar). H-Ras(V12)-transformed Swiss 3T3 cells also demonstrated decreased Rac and increased Rho activity compared with untransformed cells, but short term expression of a constitutively active Raf in Swiss 3T3 cells did not lead to elevation of RhoA activity; elevated RhoC·GTP levels were only seen after prolonged (>4 weeks) culture of the active Raf-overexpressing cells, suggesting that they were a consequence of selection rather than direct signaling (8Sahai E. Olson M.F. Marshall C.J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 755-766Google Scholar). In HT1080 human fibrosarcoma cells containing oncogenic N-Ras, both Rac and RhoA activity were increased compared with cells lacking the mutant N-Ras; Rac and RhoA activities were also increased when cells lacking the mutant N-Ras were stably transfected with constitutively active Raf or MEK (18Gupta S. Plattner R. Der C.J. Stanbridge E.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 9294-9306Google Scholar). In K-Ras(V12)-transformed normal rat kidney cells, no significant change of RhoA activity was observed compared with untransformed cells (23Pawlak G. Helfman D.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 336-347Google Scholar). Several older studies reported loss of stress fibers in Ras-transformed Rat1 cells, with restoration of stress fibers upon transfection of constitutively active RhoA, suggesting loss of RhoA activity in the Ras-transformed cells (7Qiu R.-G. Chen J. McCormick F. Symons M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11781-11785Google Scholar, 24Izawa I. Amano M. Chihara K. Yamamoto T. Kaibuchi K. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 2863-2871Google Scholar); others reported increased stress fibers in Ras-transformed breast cancer cells and NIH 3T3 cells without direct measurement of Rho activity (14Zhong C. Kinch M.S. Burridge K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 2329-2344Google Scholar, 15Khosravi-Far R. White M.A. Westwick J.K. Solski P.A. Chrzanowska-Wodnicka M. van Aelst L. Wigler M.H. Der C.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3923-3933Google Scholar). Because the mechanism of Rho regulation by Ras is not clear, we decided to examine the effects of oncogenic Ras on the activation state of RhoA in NIH 3T3 cells stably expressing H-Ras(V12) under control of an inducible promoter (LTR-H-Ras(A) cells (25Schönthal A. Herrlich P. Rahmsdorf H.J. Ponta H. Cell. 1988; 54: 325-334Google Scholar)); these cells have low basal and high induced levels of H-Ras(V12) and allowed us to study short term effects of Ras activation avoiding complex genetic changes that may occur during long term culture of Ras-transformed cells. Using two different methods to assess Rho activation, we found that induction of H-Ras(V12) in LTR-H-Ras(A) cells or transient transfection of H-Ras(V12) into wild type NIH 3T3 cells caused an approximate 2-fold increase in Rho·GTP levels. Concomitant with Rho activation, we found increased RhoA translocation to membranes and decreased activity of a p21WAF1/CIP1 promoter construct. The mechanism for increased Rho activation appeared to be decreased p190 Rho-GAP activity because of translocation of p190 Rho-GAP from the cytosol to a detergent-insoluble cytoskeletal fraction. Wild type NIH 3T3 fibroblasts and LTR-H-Ras(A) NIH 3T3 cells stably expressing activated Ras(V12) under the inducible murine mammary tumor virus promoter were routinely cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) as described previously (26Scheele J.S.

For transient transfection experiments, cells were plated in six-well cluster dishes and 24 h later were transfected with a total of 1.5 μg of DNA/well using LipofectAMINE PlusTM or LipofectAMINE 2000TM (Invitrogen) as described previously (27Suhasini M., Li, H. Lohmann S.M. Boss G.R. Pilz R.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6983-6994Google Scholar). The specific MEK inhibitor U0126 was from Calbiochem (28Favata M.F. Horiuchi K.Y. Manos E.J. Daulerio A.J.

The following plasmids were used: pcDNA3-EE-RhoA(wt), pcDNA3-EE-RhoA(V14), pcDNA3-EE-RhoA(63L), and pRC/CMV-BXB, described previously (27Suhasini M., Li, H. Lohmann S.M. Boss G.R. Pilz R.B. Mol.

Cell. 1992; 69: 539-549Google Scholar). The activation state of endogenous Rho was measured by two different methods: (i) measurement of absolute amounts of GTP and GTP + GDP bound to Rho and (ii) assessment of Rho-bound GTP by Western blotting. In both methods, the Rho binding domain (RBD) of Rhotekin was used to isolate Rho·GTP as originally described by Ren et al. (36Ren X.-D. Kiosses W.B. Schwartz M.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 578-585Google Scholar). Glutathione S-transferase (GST)-tagged Rhotekin RBD was purified from bacterial lysates; the bacterial expression vector was provided by M. A. Schwartz (36Ren X.-D. Kiosses W.B. Schwartz M.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 578-585Google Scholar). In the first method, there is the potential to measure activation of RhoA, B, and C simultaneously; however, NIH 3T3 cells express mainly RhoA with low amounts of RhoC and negligible amounts of RhoB (37Fritz G. Kaina B. Aktories K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25172-25177Google Scholar). The first method was modified to allow quantitation of GTP and GTP + GDP bound to transfected RhoA constructs. This method is a modification of a procedure we have used previously to measure GTP, and GTP + GDP, bound to Ras, Rap1, and Rheb (2von Lintig F.C. Dreilinger A.D. Varki N.M. Wallace A.M. Casteel D.E.

Cells grown on a 100-mm plate under the conditions indicated under “Results” and in the figure legends were extracted quickly in situ by washing once with ice-cold Tris-buffered saline, pH 7.4, and adding lysis buffer consisting of 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% CHAPS, 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. After a 1-min incubation on ice, the lysed cells were scraped with a rubber policeman, transferred to a microcentrifuge tube, and subjected to vortexing for 10 s. Cell extracts were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 2 min, and a portion of the supernatant was added to tubes containing 10 mm MgSO4 and 30 μg of GST-tagged Rhotekin RBD bound to glutathione beads; these samples were used for measuring GTP bound to Rho (“unloaded” samples). The remaining supernatant was added to tubes containing 10 μmGTP, 10 mm EDTA, and 30 μg of GST-tagged RBD on glutathione beads, allowing the free GTP to exchange for GDP bound to Rho, thus converting all of the Rho to the GTP-bound state (“loaded” samples). After gentle shaking for 1 h at 4 °C, the beads with Rho·GTP bound to the Rhotekin RBD were washed four times with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 2% Nonidet P-40, 500 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgSO4, and twice with 20 mm Tris-PO4, pH 7.4, 5 mmMgSO4. GTP was released from Rho by heating the beads for 3 min at 100 °C in 5 mm Tris-PO4, pH 7.4, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm EDTA (TDE buffer). We have shown previously >95% recovery of GTP under these conditions (26Scheele J.S. Rhee J.M. Boss G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1097-1100Google Scholar). GTP eluted from the unloaded and loaded samples was measured in a coupled enzymatic assay by conversion to ATP in the presence of ADP and nucleoside diphosphate kinase (26Scheele J.S. Rhee J.M. Boss G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1097-1100Google Scholar); the resulting ATP was measured by the firefly luciferase method in a photon-counting luminometer (MGM Instruments, Hamden, CT). This method is sensitive to 1 fmol of GTP and is quantitative because the second reaction is irreversible, from light generation, allowing both reactions to go to completion (26Scheele J.S. Rhee J.M. Boss G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1097-1100Google Scholar). Cells were extracted and processed as described above for the unloaded samples except the magnesium concentration in the initial lysis buffer was increased to 10 mm; Rho·GTP isolated by binding to the Rhotekin RBD-coated beads was quantitated by Western blotting using a RhoA-specific antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), as described by Renet al. (36Ren X.-D. Kiosses W.B. Schwartz M.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 578-585Google Scholar). Cells transfected with EE epitope-tagged RhoA constructs were extracted in situ in 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1% Nonidet P-40, 500 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.05% SDS, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin (RIPA buffer). After centrifuging the extracts, supernatants were split in half and added to tubes containing protein G-agarose beads coated with either a mouse monoclonal anti-EE antibody or control mouse IgG. The tubes were shaken gently for 1 h at 4 °C, and the beads were washed four times with RIPA buffer, and twice with 20 mmTris-PO4, pH 7.4, 5 mm MgSO4. GTP and GDP were released from the immunoprecipitated Rho as described above by heating the beads in TDE buffer. In one aliquot of the sample, GTP was measured as described above, and in another aliquot the sum of GDP plus GTP was measured as described previously (38Sharma P.M. Egawa K. Huang Y. Martin J.L. Huvar I. Boss G.R. Olefsky J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18528-18537Google Scholar) by converting GDP to GTP using pyruvate kinase and phosphoenolpyruvate with the resulting GTP (representing the sum of GDP plus GTP) measured as described above. Cells were plated at 8 × 104/well on a 24-well culture plate, and 24 h later the cells were transfected with 300 ng of DNA using PolyfectTM (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's recommendation. All cells received 25 ng of p21-Luc, and as indicated some cells additionally received 50 ng pEF-C3exo or 100 ng of pcDNA3-EE-Rho(63L). Cells were treated for 24 h with 1 μm dexamethasone, and luciferase activity was measured in cell extracts as described previously (41Gudi T. Huvar I. Meinecke M. Lohmann S.M. Boss G.R. Pilz R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4597-4600Google Scholar). We did not include an internal control vector because all four that were tested,i.e. pRSV-β-galactosidase, pCMV-β-galactosidase, pSV40-β-galactosidase, and pTK-β-galactosidase, demonstrated some increase in transcription when LTR-H-Ras(A) cells were treated with dexamethasone. Subconfluent cells grown on two 150-mm plates were extracted by incubating for 2 min in cold RIPA buffer, and extracts were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 2 min. The p21(Rac/CDC42)-binding domain of human PAK-1 bound to glutathione-agarose beads was used to isolate Rac·GTP, and the amount of Rac·GTP bound to the beads was quantitated by Western blotting with a mouse monoclonal anti-Rac antibody as described previously (42Benard V. Bohl B.P. Bokoch G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13198-13204Google Scholar), using an assay kit from Upstate Biotechnology. Cells grown on 150-mm plates were extracted by Dounce homogenization in 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 2 mmEDTA, 1 mm MgCl2 (HEM buffer). The resulting cell homogenate was centrifuged at 500 × g for 5 min to remove nuclei and subcellular organelles, and the supernatant was centrifuged at 37,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatant and pellet from the second centrifugation are referred to as cytosol and membranes, respectively, with the membrane preparation washed twice in HEM buffer to remove contaminating cytosol. Protein concentrations were determined according to Bradford (43Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Google Scholar), and equal amounts of protein from each preparation (30 μg of homogenate, 20 μg of cytosol, and 40 μg of membranes) were subjected to SDS-PAGE/Western blotting using mouse monoclonal anti-Rho-GAP (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, 1:1,000) and anti-Ras-GAP (Sigma, 1:500) antibodies, or a rabbit polyclonal anti-RhoA antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, 1:1,000). Triton X-100-insoluble cytoskeletal fractions were prepared as described previously (44Sharma S.V. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 271-281Google Scholar). Cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline and extracted in situ for 40 s at room temperature in 50 mm Na-Hepes, pH 6.4, 3 mmEGTA, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5% Triton X-100. The detergent-soluble supernatant was removed; the detergent-insoluble material was scraped off with a rubber policeman in the presence of phosphate-buffered saline and protease inhibitor mixture, and centrifuged for 10 min at 300 × g at 4 °C. Pellets were resuspended in SDS-sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE/Western blotting using the monoclonal anti-Rho-GAP antibody and an actin-specific antibody (C2, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, 1:300 dilution). Cytosolic extracts were prepared as described above and subjected to immunoprecipitation using a rabbit polyclonal anti-Rho-GDI antibody or control rabbit IgG. Immunoprecipitates were collected on protein G-agarose beads and analyzed by SDS-PAGE/Western blotting using a mouse monoclonal anti-RhoA antibody and the rabbit polyclonal anti-Rho-GDI antibody (both from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, used at 1:1,000). Cells grown on 100-mm plates were extracted by sonication in 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA. Bacterially expressed GST-RhoA was purified on glutathione-Sepharose beads and was loaded with [3H]GDP (specific activity of 11.7 Ci/mmol) by a 10-min incubation at 37 °C in 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, as described previously (45Self A.J. Hall A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 256: 67-76Google Scholar). The [3H]GDP-loaded RhoA was incubated with cell extracts in the presence of 1 mm GTP for 10 and 20 min at 37 °C, and the reaction was stopped by adding a 40-fold excess of ice-cold RIPA buffer. After washing the beads three times with RIPA buffer, they were dried on filter paper, and radioactivity was measured by liquid scintillation counting. The data are expressed as the percent increase in GDP·GTP exchange compared with [3H]GDP-loaded RhoA incubated in extract buffer. Cells grown on 150-mm plates were extracted by Dounce homogenization in HEM buffer supplemented with 1 mmNa3VO4 and a protease inhibitor mixture, and the cytosol was prepared as described above. After addition of 1% Triton X-100, 250 or 500 μg of extract protein was subjected to immunoprecipitation using protein G-agarose beads precoupled with either mouse monoclonal anti-p190 Rho-GAP antibody or control mouse IgG. The beads were washed three times with Triton X-100-containing buffer and once with a reaction buffer containing 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 mm GTP. The beads were resuspended in 100 μl of reaction buffer, and 50 ng of GST-RhoA preloaded with [γ-32PO4]GTP (specific activity 6,000 Ci/mmol) was added to initiate the reaction (45Self A.J. Hall A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 256: 67-76Google Scholar). Tubes were shaken vigorously in a water bath at 20 °C, and at the indicated times the reaction was stopped by transferring 10 μl of the reaction mixture to 1 ml of ice-cold stop buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol. Samples were collected on nitrocellulose filters, which were washed and dried overnight. Cerenkov radiation was measured in a scintillation counter, and data were expressed as a percentage of the amount of [γ-32PO4]GTP bound to RhoA in the zero time samples. Cytosolic extracts were prepared and subjected to immunoprecipitation with either the anti-Rho-GAP or anti-Ras-GAP antibodies as described above. Immunoprecipitates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE/Western immunoblotting using the same antibodies. The amount of phosphorylated Rho-GAP was determined by probing the blots with an anti-phosphotyrosine-specific antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, 1:500). MAP kinase activity was assessed by Western blotting using a phospho-ERK-specific antibody that recognizes a dually phosphorylated peptide sequence corresponding to Thr183 and Tyr185 of p42 MAP kinase, as described previously (27Suhasini M., Li, H. Lohmann S.M. Boss G.R. Pilz R.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6983-6994Google Scholar). As part of these studies, we developed a new quantitative method to assess Rho activation by measuring absolute amounts of GTP and of total nucleotides i.e. the sum of GTP plus GDP, bound to Rho. To measure Rho·GTP, it was isolated from cell extracts according to the method of Ren et al. (36Ren X.-D. Kiosses W.B. Schwartz M.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 578-585Google Scholar) using glutathione-agarose beads coated with a GST-Rhotekin RBD fusion protein; however, instead of assessing the Rho·GTP semiquantitatively by Western blotting, we eluted GTP from Rho and measured it in a coupled enzymatic assay as described previously for measuring GTP bound to other Ras-related proteins (26Scheele J.S. Rhee J.M. Boss G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1097-1100Google Scholar, 38Sharma P.M. Egawa K. Huang Y. Martin J.L. Huvar I. Boss G.R. Olefsky J.M. J. Biol.

Worley P.F. Boss G.R. Pilz R.B. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 6356-6365Google Scholar). To measure total nucleotides bound to Rho, we converted Rho·GDP to Rho·GTP by incubating a separate aliquot of extract in the absence of magnesium and in the presence of 10 μm GTP; under these conditions, Rho·GDP is converted rapidly to Rho·GTP (46Zhang B. Zhang Y. Wang Z.-X. Zheng Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25299-25307Google Scholar), and the latter was measured as just described. In extracts prepared from logarithmically growing NIH 3T3 cells, the assay yielded a linear response over a 5-fold range of cellular protein for both unloaded samples, i.e. those in which Rho·GTP was measured directly (Fig. 1 a), and for loaded samples, i.e. those in which total nucleotides bound to Rho were measured after converting Rho·GDP to Rho·GTP (Fig."

Shigellosis most often targets young children in underdeveloped countries. Invasion plasmid antigen C (IpaC) has been identified as the primary effector protein for Shigella invasion of epithelial cells. Although an initial model of IpaC function has been developed, no detailed structural information is available that could assist in a better understanding of the molecular basis for its interactions with the host cytoskeleton and phospholipid membrane. We have therefore initiated structural studies of IpaC, IpaC I′, (residues 101–363 deleted), and IpaC ΔH (residues 63–170 deleted). The secondary and tertiary structure of the protein was examined as a function of temperature, employing circular dichroism and high resolution derivative absorbance techniques. ANS (8-anilino-1-napthalene sulfonic acid) was used to probe the exposure of the hydrophobic surfaces under different conditions. The interaction of IpaC and these mutants with a liposome model (liposomes with entrapped fluorescein) was also examined. Domain III (residues 261–363) was studied using linker-scanning mutagenesis. It was shown that domain III contains periodic, sequence-dependent activity, suggesting helical structure in this section of the protein. In addition to these structural studies, investigation into the actin nucleation properties of IpaC was conducted, and actin nucleation by IpaC and some of the mutants was exhibited.

Microbiol. Rev. 1991; 55: 206-224Google Scholar). An estimated 360,000 Shigella cases occur in the United States each year, although only 18,000 are reported (2Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (2000)Shigellosis, www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dbmd/diseaseinfo/shigellosis_g.htmGoogle Scholar). In developing countries, the disease is present in most villages. It most commonly strikes young children and is responsible for an estimated 600,000 deaths/year worldwide (all Shigella spp. combined) (1Hale T.L. Microbiol. Rev. 1991; 55: 206-224Google Scholar). Shigellosis onset involves bacterial invasion of intestinal epithelial cells by a process called “pathogen-induced phagocytosis” (2Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (2000)Shigellosis, www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dbmd/diseaseinfo/shigellosis_g.htmGoogle Scholar, 3Hueck C. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. 1998; 62: 379-433Google Scholar) and requires the expression of the ipa operon. The invasion plasmid antigens (or Ipa1proteins) are effector proteins that are exported by a dedicated type III secretion system (TTSS) at the host-pathogen interface. There they directly interact with the host cell to promote actin cytoskeleton rearrangements at the site of bacterial contact (2Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (2000)Shigellosis, www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dbmd/diseaseinfo/shigellosis_g.htmGoogle Scholar). These cytoskeletal changes give rise to filopodia, which mature into membrane ruffles that coalesce to trap the pathogen within a membrane-bound vacuole (2Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (2000)Shigellosis, www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dbmd/diseaseinfo/shigellosis_g.htmGoogle Scholar). The vacuole is then quickly lysed to provide the bacterium with access to the host cytoplasm, where it proliferates and is able to directly invade neighboring cells (4Sansonetti P.J. Ryter A. Clerc P. Maurelli A.T. Mounier J. Infect. Immun. 1986; 51: 461-469Google Scholar). IpaC has been identified as the primary effector protein forShigella invasion of epithelial cells (5Marquart M.E.

Lucius D. Picking W.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1429: 45-56Google Scholar), reconstitution into complexes with IpaB in vitro (8Davis R. Marquart M.E. Lucius D. Picking W.D. Biochim. Biophys.

Kurata T. Watanabe H. Microb. Pathog. 1999; 27: 223-230Google Scholar). It has been demonstrated that IpaC possesses a distinct functional organization (Scheme I). The immediate N terminus of IpaC is required for secretion, whereas a region near the N terminus is responsible for association with IpaB, which is probably needed for proper presentation of IpaC to the target cell membrane. The central hydrophobic region of IpaC directs IpaC penetration of phospholipid membranes and contributes to interactions with IpaB (14Picking W.L. Coye L. Osiecki J.C. Barnoski Serfis A. Schaper E.

Immun. 2000; 68: 3710-3715Google Scholar and this work); however, active insertion of IpaC into target cell membranes by the TTSS greatly increases the efficiency of this process (15Blocker A. Gounon P. Larquet E. Niebuhr K. Cabiaux V. Parsot C. Sansonetti P. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 683-693Google Scholar). The C terminus of IpaC mediates IpaC-IpaC interactions and probably possesses IpaC effector function (7Tran Van Nhieu G. Caron E. Hall A. Sansonetti P.J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3249-3262Google Scholar, 14Picking W.L. Coye L. Osiecki J.C. Barnoski Serfis A. Schaper E. Picking W.D. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 39: 100-111Google Scholar). This information, however, only provides a very general picture of IpaC structure and function and its role in the S. flexneri infection process. Unfortunately, there exists no detailed structural information concerning IpaC that could provide a molecular basis for its interactions with the host cytoskeleton and phospholipid membranes. In this work, we have initiated studies into the structure of IpaC by employing a number of biophysical approaches. Truncated versions of IpaC, specifically IpaC I′ (residues 101–363 deleted) and IpaC ΔH (residues 63–170 deleted), were overexpressed in E. coliand purified, permitting structural analysis and a more comprehensive investigation into the role of the individual domains described above. The interaction of these mutants and full-length IpaC with a liposome model was also examined. In addition to these structural studies, an investigation into the actin nucleation properties of IpaC and these deletion constructs was conducted. Finally, domain III (residues 261–363), which has previously resisted attempts at purification after recombinant expression, was studied using an alternate technique, linker-scanning mutagenesis. From this, it is shown that domain III contains a sequence periodic structure-activity relationship, which suggests that the activity may be dependent on helical structure in this region. Interpretation of IpaC structure with regard to the functional properties of the wild-type protein is then discussed. DOPC (dioleoylphosphatidylcholine) and DOPG (dioleoylphosphatidylglycerol) were purchased from Avanti. ANS (8-anilino-1-naphthalene sulfonic acid) was obtained from Across Organics, and fluorescein (5,6-carboxyfluorescein, high purity) was obtained from Molecular Probes. Dialysis materials were provided by Spectra. All other chemicals were of reagent grade and obtained from Sigma and Fisher. Plasmids used to prepare recombinant IpaC and IpaC ΔH and sipC have been described previously (5Marquart M.E. Picking W.L. Picking W.D. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 4182-4187Google Scholar, 16Osiecki J.C. Barker J. Picking W.L. Serfis A.B. Berring E. Shah S. Harrington A. Picking W.D. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 42: 469-481Google Scholar, 17Picking W.L. Mertz J.A. Marquart M.E. Picking W.D. Protein Expression Purif. 1996; 8: 401-408Google Scholar). pWPI′ was designed to encode an IpaC peptide called region I′, in which residues 101–363 are deleted. This plasmid was generated as pWPC15 except that the 3′ primer was designed to place a stop codon at amino acid 101. All new plasmids were transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3) for high level protein expression. Recombinant proteins were purified via the N-terminal His6 tag by nickel chelation chromatography under denaturing conditions as described in detail previously (5Marquart M.E. Picking W.L. Picking W.D. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 4182-4187Google Scholar, 14Picking W.L. Coye L. Osiecki J.C. Barnoski Serfis A. Schaper E. Picking W.D. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 39: 100-111Google Scholar,17Picking W.L. Mertz J.A. Marquart M.E. Picking W.D. Protein Expression Purif. 1996; 8: 401-408Google Scholar). Purified proteins were step-dialyzed against 10 mmNaPO4, pH 7.2, 150 mm NaCl containing 0.5 mm dithiothreitol to remove the urea. Purified proteins in buffer were stored at −70 °C for long term storage (IpaC only) or 4 °C for short term use (<2 weeks). All protein samples were centrifuged at 13,400 × g for 5 min at 4 °C on the day of use to remove aggregates formed during storage. Tween 20 (0.1%) was added to the IpaC solutions to further stabilize them during freezing. Unfortunately, neither centrifugation nor filtration was effective at completely removing all aggregated material (observed as a small amount of optical density above 300 nm in absorbance spectra). Concentrations were therefore obtained employing derivative absorbance spectroscopy, using N-acetyl-l-tyrosine-ethyl ester derivative minima at 275 and 283 nm to establish a standard curve since IpaC possesses no tryptophan residues. Biophysical studies were conducted in 10 mm NaPO4, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.2, containing 1 mm dithiothreitol. CD spectra were recorded with a Jasco J-720 spectrophotometer (Tokyo, Japan) equipped with a Peltier temperature controller. Far UV spectra (between 195 and 260 nm) were collected using a 1-mm path length cuvette sealed with a Teflon stopper. A resolution of 0.1 nm and a scanning speed of 20 nm/min with a 2-s response time were employed. Spectra presented are an average of six consecutive spectra. Spectra were recorded at 5 °C intervals employing a thermostated cuvette holder. An incubation time of 3 min at each temperature interval (sufficient for equilibrium to be obtained) and a temperature ramp rate of 20 °C/h were employed. Protein concentrations of 8.3, 26.3, and 11.2 μm were employed for IpaC, IpaC I′, and IpaC ΔH, respectively. Noise reduction and data analysis were performed using Standard Analysis and Temperature/Wavelength Analysis programs (Jasco) and MicroCal Origin™ 6.0 software. Secondary structure content was estimated using the CONTIN (18Provencher S. Glockner J. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 33-37Google Scholar), SELCON (19Sreerama N. Woody R. Anal. Biochem. 1990; 209: 32-44Google Scholar), and CDSSTR (20Manavalan P. Johnson W.C., Jr. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 167: 76-85Google Scholar) analysis programs provided with the CDPro software suite (21Sreerama, N. CDPro: A Software Package for Analyzing Protein Spectra, lamar.colostate.edu/∼sreeram/CDPro/index.htmlGoogle Scholar). High-resolution absorbance spectra were collected on a Hewlett-Packard 8453 UV-Visible spectrophotometer (Agilent, Palo Alto, CA) fitted with a Peltier temperature controller. Temperature perturbation studies were conducted at protein concentrations of 12.7, 25.3, and 16.9 μm for IpaC, IpaC I′, and IpaC ΔH, respectively. Spectra were collected for 25 s at 2.5 °C intervals with a 3-min equilibration time before collection of each spectrum. Spectral analysis was conducted using UV-Visible Chemstation software (Agilent) and Microcal Origin™ 6.0. Second derivative spectra were calculated employing a nine-point data filter and fifth degree Savitzky-Golay polynomial and subsequently fitted to a cubic function with 99 interpolated points/raw data point, permitting 0.01-nm resolution (22Mach H. Middaugh C.R. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 222: 323-331Google Scholar). Peak positions were then determined from the interpolated curves. Optical density data were simultaneously monitored at 350 nm. Aliquots of DOPC and DOPG in chloroform were dried under nitrogen and vacuum to create thin films of either 100% DOPC or 50:50 [DOPC]:[DOPG]. Films were hydrated in a solution containing 100 mm5,6-carboxyfluorescein at pH 7.0 in water for 10 min and then sonicated in a bath sonicator for 30 min prior to extrusion through a 100-nm pore size membrane 10 times at 45 °C. A final size of ∼150 nm was determined with a Brookhaven ZetaPALS dynamic light scattering instrument (Holtsville, NY) equipped with a 25 mW 626-nm laser. Excess dye was separated from the bulk liposomes by size exclusion chromatography, employing a Sephadex G-25 column coupled to an AKTA FLPC (Amersham Biosciences). The run buffer was 10 mm NaPO4, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4. Peak fractions were collected and pooled, and lipid content was determined by a total phosphorous assay, as described (23Avanti Polar Lipids, Determination of Total Phosphorous, www.avantilipids.com/DeterminationOfTotalPhosphorus.html.Google Scholar). Solutions were stored at 4 °C and protected from light. Time-based release studies were conducted with a PTI QuantaMaster spectrophotometer with a thermostated cuvette holder. Samples were excited at 492 nm, and the emission signal was monitored at 517 nm for 10 min. Excitation slits were set at 1 nm, and emission was set at 2 nm. Data points were collected at 0.2-s intervals. Data were collected as follows: buffer was incubated for 3 min at the desired temperature prior to adding liposome solutions. Baseline fluorescence was monitored with liposomes alone for 10 min to determine residual release of fluorescein from the liposomes. Maximum fluorescein release, as defined by release in the presence of 0.1% Triton, was determined by adding Triton to the liposome solution 3 min after the start of signal collection. Protein-induced fluorescein release was examined by monitoring the fluorescein signal at 512 nm after addition of protein to the liposome solution after 3 min of incubation. Both protein and Triton solutions were added during continuous signal collection through a syringe port in the sample compartment. The protein concentration employed was 1 μm, and the total lipid concentration was 100 μm. Release was monitored at 10, 20, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, and 60 °C. Samples were measured in triplicate. The extent of release was calculated as a percentage of Triton-induced release at 600 s after background correction. Analysis was conducted using Felix (PTI) and MicroCal Origin™ software. The fluorescence of pyrene-labeled G-actin monomers increases following assembly into pyrene F-actin (24Hayward R.D. Koronakis V. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4926-4934Google Scholar). For monitoring IpaC-mediated actin nucleationin vitro, pyrene G-actin was incubated at 4 °C in G-actin buffer (5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.1 mm ATP, 0.2 mm CaCl2). Test protein (IpaC or an IpaC mutant) was then added to the sample, and pyrene fluorescence was monitored at 23 °C. A Spex FluoroMax instrument (Jobin Yvon Horiba, Edison, NJ) was used to measure pyrene fluorescence using a time-based acquisition mode with an excitation wavelength of 330 and an emission wavelength of 385 nm. After 15 min, 50× actin polymerization buffer (100 mm MgCl2, 50 mm ATP, 2.5m KCl) was added, and the change in pyrene fluorescence was monitored as a function of time. Negative controls either contained no added protein or contained IpaD, which has no actin-nucleating activity. SipC from Salmonella typhimurium, which has been shown to nucleate actin in vitro, was used as a positive control (24Hayward R.D. Koronakis V. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4926-4934Google Scholar). Linker-scanning mutagenesis was used to introduce consecutive site-specific mutations into a predicted coiled-coil segment near the C terminus of IpaC. Either NheI cleavage sites encoding Ala-Ser pairs or XhoI sites encoding Leu-Glu pairs were generated throughout the length of the putative coiled-coil region (amino acids 309–344). Primers with a 5′NheI or XhoI site and the appropriate neighboringipaC sequences running in either direction were used for inverse PCR. The product was digested with NheI orXhoI, respectively, and then ligated. The resulting plasmids were electroporated into the S. flexneri IpaC mutant strain SF621, and the ability to restore invasion and contact hemolysis functions was determined as described below. S. flexneri invasion of Henle 407 cells was monitored using a standard gentamycin protection assay as described (16Osiecki J.C. Barker J. Picking W.L. Serfis A.B. Berring E. Shah S. Harrington A. Picking W.D. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 42: 469-481Google Scholar). Semiconfluent monolayers of Henle 407 cells were seeded into 24-well plates and grown overnight. SF621 harboring the desired plasmid was grown in trypticase soy broth containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 50 μg/ml kanamycin to an A 600 of 0.4–0.6. The bacteria were diluted with serum-free MEM containing 0.45% glucose (MEM-glc), centrifuged onto the surface of semiconfluent Henle 407 monolayers, and incubated with the cells for 30 min at 37 °C. Free bacteria were removed by aspiration, and the cells were washed with MEM containing 5% calf serum and 50 μg/ml gentamycin. The cells were incubated in the final gentamycin wash for 2 h (to kill adherent, noninternalized bacteria) and rinsed with MEM-glc. The cells were lysed by overlaying them with 250 μl of 0.5% agarose in water. The agarose was then overlaid with 0.5% agar containing 2× LB medium. After overnight incubation at 37 °C, internalized bacteria formed subsurface colonies that were quantified using a ChemiImager 4400 system (Alpha Innotech Corp., San Leandro, CA). All errors are reported as standard error (S.E., n = 3) unless otherwise indicated. To better understand the function of IpaC in theS. flexneri invasion process, a series of structural studies were conducted to characterize the secondary and tertiary structure of full-length IpaC, IpaC I′, and ΔH mutants and their response to temperature. All three proteins are efficiently secreted by the S. flexneri SF621 TTSS and are able to interact with IpaB, indicating that biological functions associated with the N terminus remain intact (14Picking W.L. Coye L. Osiecki J.C. Barnoski Serfis A. Schaper E. Picking W.D. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 39: 100-111Google Scholar). The CD spectrum of IpaC at 20 °C exhibits minima at 222 and 204 nm, suggesting the presence of some helical structure (Fig. 1 A). Secondary structure estimates indicate that IpaC contains a mixture of α-helical and β-sheet structure with significant turn and random structure also present (Table I). In contrast, IpaC I′ and IpaC ΔH appear to be less structured, as indicated by a decrease in CD intensity above 210 nm. The spectrum of IpaC I′ exhibits an increase in negative intensity near 200 nm, suggesting increased random structure. Solution conditions prevented collection of data below 200 nm, preventing secondary structure estimation for both mutants. IpaC undergoes a significant change in secondary structure at fairly moderate temperatures (Table I and Fig. 1). This transition suggests a loss of helix content (Table I) and has a midpoint of 43.3 ± 0.3 °C (n = 3). In contrast, IpaC I′ and IpaC ΔH display evidence of only weak transitions between 10 and 40 °C. Although limited aggregation of some samples was observed above 30 °C, no red shifts or strong decreases in intensity indicative of absorption flattening were observed, indicating that the spectral changes are not an artifact of aggregation-dependent phenomena.Table ISecondary structure estimates for IpaCTemperatureα-Helixβ-SheetTurnRandom%%%%20 °C10 (2)1-aErrors are reported as S.E., n = 3.34 (1)22 (2)32 (2)40 °C7 (1)35 (2)23 (2)35 (1)60 °C4 (0)38 (2)23 (2)33 (0)1-a Errors are reported as S.E., n = 3. Open table in a new tab Because IpaC lacks tryptophan residues, derivative absorbance spectroscopy was employed to monitor tertiary structure changes. This method is especially useful in aggregating systems since it is not sensitive to broad spectral components such as light scattering (25Mach H. Middaugh C.R. BioTechniques. 1993; 15: 240-242Google Scholar). The spectra display two phenylalanine (Fig. 2, A and B, 253 and 260 nm) and three tyrosine (Fig. 2, C–E, 268, 276, and 285 nm) minima (22Mach H. Middaugh C.R. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 222: 323-331Google Scholar). Most plots of peak position versustemperature show similar linear increases with temperature, which is an intrinsic property of the aromatic amino acids. 3L. A. Kueltzo and C. R. Middaugh, manuscript in preparation. However, deviations from these linear plots consistent with structural alterations are observed in many cases. The IpaC Phe minimum at 253 nm is shifted to longer wavelengths relative to the two mutants and shows no temperature dependence at lower temperatures. Upon reaching the temperature at which the protein begins aggregating, the noise in the data begins to increase. The second Phe minimum shows a difference in minimum position for each of the proteins with the IpaC peak once again at the longest wavelength. An expanded version of the IpaC I′ data (Fig. 2 F) shows that IpaC I′ actually undergoes a small but very reproducible transition between 30 and 55 °C. The 267 nm IpaC I′ tyrosine minimum is observed at longer wavelengths, disappearing from the derivative spectrum at temperatures above 62 °C. Two strong transitions are observed in the plot of the 276-nm tyrosine minimum of IpaC with no similar transitions seen for either mutant. The 284-nm IpaC I′ and IpaC ΔH tyrosine minima again manifest no evidence of conformational change, whereas the IpaC absorption band shows evidence of the two transitions and is again present at a longer wavelength (Fig. 2 E). Trends in protein-associative behavior can be seen by monitoring the turbidity (OD) at 350 nm as the temperature is increased (Fig. 3). Full-length IpaC shows a large change in turbidity starting near 30 °C. Transitions are observed between 30 and 70 °C and above 70 °C. Although the changes are small, a distinct transition is observed starting at 55 °C for IpaC I′, whereas IpaC ΔH shows a small but steady increase in OD starting at 20 °C (Fig. 3, bottom panels). Both results are consistent with the formation of soluble aggregates. The effect of IpaC, IpaC I′, and IpaC ΔH upon fluorescein-containing liposomes was examined as a function of the temperature and lipid composition. Fluorescein can be sequestered in liposomes at concentrations that produce self-quenching (26Mach H. Middaugh C.R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9913-9920Google Scholar). Any interaction of a protein with such loaded liposomes that is sufficient to significantly perturb the bilayer should cause a leakage of the fluorescein, leading to its dilution and an increase in the fluorescence intensity of the fluorescein dye. Using this approach, two types of vesicles were employed: 100% DOPC, producing a neutral surface charge, and 50:50 [DOPC]:[DOPG] to produce an overall negatively charged surface. The extent of dye release at 600 s at different temperatures is shown in Fig. 4. No release is observed for IpaC I′ and IpaC ΔH. IpaC shows little release at low temperatures with DOPC liposomes, but a dramatic increase is observed at 30 °C and higher. Release at lower temperatures is greater with DOPC:DOPG liposomes. The rate of release is similar to that of the Triton control (results not illustrated). The liposomes remained above the phase transitions of the component lipids (−20 and −18 °C for DOPC and DOPG, respectively (27Silvius J.R. Jost P.C. Griffith O.H. Lipid-Protein Interactions. 2nd Ed. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1982: 515Google Scholar)) under all conditions examined. The region between amino acids 309 and 344 of IpaC is predicted to possess a coiled-coil trimerization domain based on primary structure analysis (28Pallen M.J. Dougan G. Frankel G. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 25: 423-425Google Scholar). Attempts to purify a recombinant form of this region have been unsuccessful, so a structural analysis of this region was conducted using linker-scanning mutagenesis. Initially, XhoI linkers were used to substitute Leu-Glu amino acid pairs for existing amino acids in this region of IpaC. Sequence periodicity in the generation of inactivating mutations with respect to restoring invasiveness toS. flexneri SF621 was consistent with the presence of a coiled α-helix in this region (Fig. 5 A). Although linker-scanning mutations near the C-terminal end of the putative coiled-coil show periodicity in reducing invasiveness, they do not eliminate IpaC activity completely. In contrast, when NheI linkers (encoding Ala-Ser) were introduced into the same region, substitution for the Leu335-Ile336 pair did completely eliminate IpaC invasion function, as did substitution for Leu339-Leu340 (Fig. 5 B). This difference in the effect of amino acid substitutions at this location could be explained by the fact that the Leu-Glu led to the replacement of a nonpolar pair of amino acids by a nonpolar/polar pair. On the other hand, NheI scanning results in the replacement of nonpolar residues by a polar pair. In total, these data are consistent with the presence of an α-helix within this portion of IpaC. Because a single amino acid change at Ile336 and Leu340 in the putative IpaC coiled region only partially reduced the ability of IpaC to restore invasiveness, other single amino acid changes were introduced, using Pro as the substituted amino acid because of its incompatibility with α-helix formation. When Pro was used to replace Ser3"

They display very little sequence similarity apart from the occurrence of one to four conserved CXXCH motifs which are the binding sites for the prosthetic group. The c-type cytochromes are distinguished from other cytochromes by covalent attachment of the prosthetic group to the apoprotein via one, or in most cases, two thioether linkages between the vinyl side chains of heme and the cysteines from the CXXCH motif. Because all holocytochromes c acquire their function in a different compartment from the sites of synthesis of their apoproteins and cofactor heme, their biogenesis follows a complex pathway with several steps: (a) transport and processing of the apocytochromes, (b) transport of heme, (c) transfer of reducing equivalents across the membrane in order to assure the maintenance of heme and sulfhydryl groups of the CXXCH motif under a reduced state and d) stereospecific attachment of the heme group to the apocytochromes.

Ccs1 is a pioneer protein lacking any recognizable motifs which might suggest an obvious biochemical activity in the pathway (52Inoue K. Dreyfuss B.W. Kindle K.L. Stern D.B. Merchant S. Sodeinde O.A.

The presence of strictly conserved histidinyl residues which are known ferroheme ligands led to the hypothesis that CcmC, CcmF and CcsA proteins bind and deliver heme to the apocytochromes (6Nakamoto S.S. Hamel P. Merchant S. Biochimie (Paris). 2000; 82: 603-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 31Goldman B.S. Beckman D.L. Monika E.M. Kranz R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

However, despite the conservation of histidinyl and tryptophan residues, CcsA is not a true homolog of CcmC or CcmF and clearly defines a separate member of the WWD motif family (5Xie Z. Merchant S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1365: 309-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 31Goldman B.S. Beckman D.L. Monika E.M. Kranz R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The co-occurrence of Ccs1 and CcsA homologues, encoded by genes often organized in an operon arrangement, in plastid and bacterial genomes led to the definition of a new pathway for assembling holocytochromesc (3Kranz R.

In an effort to elucidate the biochemical function of CcsA in the plastid system, we used the bacterial topological reporters alkaline phosphatase and β-galactosidase to deduce the polytopic arrangement of Chlamydomonas CcsA and thus to determine the orientation of the WWD motif and conserved histidine residues. The functional significance of these key residues was further demonstrated by site-directed mutagenesis of the ccsA gene in the plastid context and each mutant was assessed for its ability to assemble thec-type cytochromes and support photosynthetic growth. We also provide the first evidence for the existence of a system II cytochrome assembly machinery by showing that CcsA and Ccs1 are present in a 200-kDa complex that could be detected within the thylakoid membranes by BN-PAGE. Based on our results, we formulate and discuss the hypothesis that CcsA and Ccs1 constitute a subcomplex functioning in the delivery/ligation of heme to apocytochromes. C. reinhardtiiwild type strains CC125, 2137 (Chlamydomonas Genetic Center, Duke University) and WT59+ (Institut de Biologie PhysicoChimique, Paris, France) are wild type with respect to photosynthesis and c-type cytochrome biogenesis and are accordingly labeled wild type in the figures.

Beckman D.L. Kranz R.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 271: 679-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) containing the alkaline phosphatase encoding gene (phoA) was used to generate 9 ccsA-phoAtranslational fusions by a PCR-based strategy described previously (17Beckman D.L. Trawick D.R. Kranz R.G. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 268-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Various portions of the ccsA gene were amplified withPfu polymerase using the cloned ccsA gene as a template, F-CcsASac as a forward primer and one of the 9 R-CcsA oligonucleotides as a reverse primer (see list of primers below). F-CcsASac was engineered with a SacI site upstream of the first ATG codon in ccsA ORF (51Xie Z. Merchant S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4632-4639Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) and reverse primers were designed with a SalI site at the desiredccsA-phoA fusion junction. PCR products thus obtained were digested with SacI and SalI and cloned intoSacI/SalI digested pRGK200 to yield the pccsA::phoA series of plasmids. The pccsA::phoA plasmids express translational fusions of ccsA to phoA with fusions at positions 14, 65, 138, 168, 200, 247, 288, 321, 352 of CcsA polypeptide. The ccsA::LacZα fusions at positions 14, 247, and 321 were generated from the corresponding pccsA::phoA plasmids by replacing a 2.6-kb SalI-PstI fragment including the entirephoA gene with a 0.7-kb PCR-amplified lacZsegment corresponding to the α fragment of β-galactosidase and in frame with the upstream CcsA reading frame. The lacZα segment was amplified from plasmid pSKII+(Stratagene) with M13 reverse primer and a lacZ specific primer engineered with a PstI site. The PCR product was digested with SalI and PstI and then cloned intoPstI-SalI digested pccsA::phoA plasmids.

Alkaline phosphatase assays were performed on whole E. coli cells as described previously in (63Brickman E. Beckwith J. J. Mol. Biol. 1975; 96: 307-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar), except that isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was not used to induce the expression of the fusion proteins. β-galactosidase activity was measured on SDS-chloroform treated cells essentially as described in (64Kranz R.G. Haselkorn R. Gene (Amst.). 1985; 40: 203-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Alkaline phosphatase activity expressed in Miller units was calculated using the following formula: (1000·A 420 nm)/(time (min)·A 600 nm). β-Galactosidase activity is expressed in units and calculated by the following formula: (1000·(A 420 nm−(1.75·A 550 nm))/(time (min)·A 600 nm).

Mutagenic primers were designed in order to introduce a new restriction site or to alter an existing one in the sequence of the ccsA gene (see Table I). All PCR amplified regions of ccsA were sequenced on both strands. Plasmid pPmP-aadA was obtained by cloning a 5.5-kbPmeI-PstI chloroplast DNA containing theccsA gene into the XbaI (Klenow-filled) andNsiI-digested pGEM7Z plasmid (Promega). To simplify cloning, the HindIII site, located at the 3′ far end of theccsA gene was removed by site-directed mutagenesis.

C. reinhardtii vegetative cells grown in TAP liquid culture (1–2 × 106 cells/ml) were transformed by particle bombardment (using a home-made particle gun at Institut de Biologie PhysicoChimique, Paris or a Bio-Rad PDS-1000/He particle delivery system at UCLA) as described in (51Xie Z. Merchant S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4632-4639Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Particles were coated with DNA as in (67Sawant S.V. Singh P.K. Tuli R. BioTechniques. 2000; 29: 246-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). We also found in the course of this study that the transformation of gametes significantly facilitates the recovery of homoplasmic strains carrying a site-directed mutation inccsA (see section below). Gamete cells for transformation were prepared as follows. Vegetative cells grown in liquid TAP medium (0.5 × 106 cells/ml) were collected by centrifugation, washed once with sterile water and resuspended in TAP without nitrogen source in order to induce gametogenesis (60Harris E.H. The Chlamydomonas Sourcebook: A Comprehensive Guide to Biology and Laboratory Use. Academic Press, San Diego1989Google Scholar). Cells were maintained in the dark with agitation for 16–20 h, then centrifuged, washed once in water and resuspended in 50 mmsorbitol (107 cells/ml). 5 × 106 to 107 cells were plated on agar and immediately bombarded. Bombarded cells were incubated overnight under dim light. For the complementation experiments, ccsA-B6 or ccsA-ct59 cells were bombarded directly on solid minimal agar. Bombarded cells were then incubated at a higher light intensity (50 μmol/m2/s). For the generation of SpecR ccsA site-directed mutants, wild type WT59+or 2137 cells were bombarded directly onto solid fresh TAP medium containing 150 μg/ml spectinomycin. Plates were incubated under dim light (25 μmol/m2/s) until colonies appeared. The transformation of gametes was found to be 10–50 times less efficient with respect to the frequency of SpecR colonies obtained by transformation of vegetative cells. Rescued colonies and SpecR transformants were screened for the presence of the mutant copy of ccsA by amplification using ccsA specific primers flanking the mutation of interest. Initial SpecR transformants were found to be predominantly heteroplasmic when vegetative cells were used as recipient cells for transformation but homoplasmic for chloroplast genomes carrying the mutant copy of ccsA for the most part when gamete cells were transformed instead.

https://openalex.org/W2094885091,"This study describes the role of the interferon (IFN) consensus sequence-binding protein (ICSBP or IRF-8) in iNOS gene expression by murine macrophages. An ICSBP binding site in the iNOS promoter region (−923 to −913) was identified using an electrophoretic mobility shift assay and chromatin co-immunoprecipitation. Overexpression of ICSBP greatly enhanced IFN-γ-induced iNOS promoter activation in RAW264.7 cells, and IFN-γ-induced iNOS promoter activation was abolished in ICSBP−/− macrophages. Furthermore, transduction of retrovirus-ICSBP in ICSBP−/− macrophages rescued IFN-γ-induced iNOS gene expression. However, transduction of retrovirus-ICSBP in the absence of IFN-γ activation did not induce iNOS expression in either RAW264.7 cells or ICSBP−/− macrophages. Interestingly, ICSBP alone transduced into ICSBP−/− macrophages did not bind to IFN-stimulated response element site (−923 to −913) of the iNOS promoter region, although following activation with IFN-γ, a DNA·protein complex was formed that contains ICSBP and IRF-1. Co-transduction of ICSBP with IRF-1 clearly induces nitric oxide production. In addition, interleukin-4 inhibits IFN-γ-induced iNOS gene expression by attenuating the physical interaction of ICSBP with IRF-1. Complex formation of ICSBP with IRF-1 is essential for iNOS expression, and interleukin-4 attenuates the physical interaction of ICSBP with IRF-1 resulting in the inhibition of INOS gene expression.

Macrophages generate NO froml-arginine through the inducible isoform of nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), which is regulated transcriptionally. iNOS gene expression is induced by a variety of stimuli, including lipopolysaccharide (LPS), bacterial wall products, and cytokines. In particular, interferon-γ (IFN-γ) is a potent inducer of iNOS gene expression (10Xie Q.W. Cho H.J. Calaycay J. Mumford R.A. Swiderek K.M. Lee T.D. Ding A. Troso T. Nathan C.

Immunol. 1988; 141: 2407-2412PubMed Google Scholar), although the molecular mechanism for the effect is still not understood fully. The murine iNOS promoter region contains several binding sites for transcription factors implicated in iNOS regulation, including two NF-κB binding sites. The NF-κB site situated closer to the transcriptional start site is required for iNOS gene induction by LPS, because deleting the downstream site essentially abolishes iNOS transcription (12Xie Q.W. Kashiwabara Y. Nathan C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4705-4708Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Deletion of the upstream NF-κB site reduces but does not abolish iNOS transcription (12Xie Q.W. Kashiwabara Y. Nathan C. J. Biol.

The upstream portion of the iNOS promoter contains an enhancer region, with several transcription factor binding sites that mediate transcriptional responses to IFN-γ. These sites include a γ-interferon-activated site element and two IFN-stimulated response elements (ISRE) (15Gao J. Morrison D.C. Parmely T.J. Russell S.W. Murphy W.J. J. Biol.

Site-directed mutagenesis and competition experiments have shown that the ISRE site between −923 and −913 is required for the full synergistic effects of IFN-γ and LPS in the transcription of the iNOS gene (16Kamijo R. Harada H. Matsuyama T. Bosland M. Gerecitano J. Shapiro D., Le, J. Koh S.I. Kimura T. Green S.J. et al.Science. 1994; 263: 1612-1615Crossref PubMed Scopus (787) Google Scholar). The cytokine IFN-γ plays an essential role in innate and adaptive immunity (17Stark G.R. Kerr I.M. Williams B.R. Silverman R.H. Schreiber R.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 227-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (3388) Google Scholar). IFN signaling, which involves a variety oftrans- and cis-acting factors, is mediated through DNA motifs, designated ISRE and IFN-γ-activated sequence, which are found in promoters of IFN-inducible genes. The interferon consensus sequence-binding protein (ICSBP or IRF-8) is a transcription factor belonging to the IFN regulatory factor (IRF) family, which also includes the IRF-1, IRF-2, IRF-3, interferon-stimulated gene factor 3γ, and pip/IRF-4 proteins (18Taniguchi T. Ogasawara K. Takaoka A. Tanaka N. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2001; 19: 623-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (1295) Google Scholar,19Tamura T. Ozato K. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 2002; 22: 145-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Unlike the other members of the IRF family, ICSBP expression is limited to activated macrophages, B cells, and T cells (20Driggers P.H. Ennist D.L. Gleason S.L. Mak W.H. Marks M.S. Levi B.Z.

Immunol. 2001; 19: 623-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (1295) Google Scholar). The tyrosine-phosphorylated form of ICSBP does not bind to DNA independently but requires complex formation with other members of the IRF family (IRF-1 and IRF-2) or with other transcriptional elements (24Levi B.Z. Hashmueli S. Gleit-Kielmanowicz M. Azriel A. Meraro D. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 2002; 22: 153-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Previous studies found that ICSBP represses transcriptional activity of ISRE promoters in various cell types. However, recent studies suggest that ICSBP can activate genes required for the development and function of macrophages (25Wang I.M. Contursi C. Masumi A., Ma, X. Trinchieri G. Ozato K. J.

ICSBP−/− mice were shown to be highly susceptible to infection with several pathogens including Listeria monocytogenes (27Fehr T. Schoedon G. Odermatt B. Holtschke T. Schneemann M. Bachmann M.F.

Gadina M. O'Shea J. Morse III, H.C. Ozato K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 91-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). However, the molecular mechanism for the regulation of NO by ICSBP is not clear. In the present study we have analyzed iNOS gene expression in macrophages induced by IFN-γ and have identified an ICSBP binding site in the iNOS promoter region. Transduction of ICSBP with a retroviral vector in ICSBP−/− macrophages rescues IFN-γ-induced iNOS expression. Surprisingly, iNOS expression is not induced by transduction of ICSBP alone but requires co-transduction of ICSBP with IRF-1. This study provides new insights into the molecular mechanism of iNOS gene induction by IFN-γ, which indicates the importance of an ICSBP·IRF-1 complex in the regulation of iNOS gene expression. iNOS promoter fragments were inserted into the luciferase reporter vector pGL2B (Promega) as described previously (13Lowenstein C.J. Alley E.W. Raval P. Snowman A.M. Snyder S.H. Russell S.W. Murphy W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9730-9734Crossref PubMed Scopus (1008) Google Scholar). The IRF-1 expression plasmid was a gift from T. Taniguchi (University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan). All site-directed mutant plasmids were generated by two-step polymerase chain reaction using overlapping internal primers containing the mutant site (30Plevy S.E. Gemberling J.H. Hsu S. Dorner A.J. Smale S.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4572-4588Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). The RAW264.7 murine macrophage cell line (American Type Culture Collection) was maintained in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and penicillin-streptomycin. ICSBP−/− macrophages (CL-2 cells) were established from bone marrow cells obtained from ICSBP−/− mice following coincubation with the murine J2 virus, harboring v-raf and v-myc genes (25Wang I.M. Contursi C. Masumi A., Ma, X. Trinchieri G. Ozato K. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 271-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). The CL-2 cells were maintained in the same media as above, supplemented with recombinant mouse M-CSF (6 ng/ml; R & D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) and recombinant mouse GM-CSF (6 ng/ml; Peprotech, Rocky Hill, NJ) (25Wang I.M. Contursi C. Masumi A., Ma, X. Trinchieri G. Ozato K. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 271-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). IFN-γ and IL-4 were obtained from R & D Systems. LPS was purchased from Sigma. Antibodies against iNOS, ICSBP, IRF-1, and IRF-2 were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Nitrite concentration, a measure of NO synthesis, was assayed by a standard Griess reaction adapted to microplates, as described previously (31Xiong H. Kawamura I. Nishibori T. Mitsuyama M. Cell. Immunol. 1996; 172: 118-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Nitrite accumulation was determined by using NaNO2 as standard, and the data were expressed as concentration of nitrite. RAW267.4 cells were transiently transfected using Superfect (Qiagen). For each transfection, 2.5 μg of plasmid was mixed with 100 μl of RPMI 1640 (without serum and antibiotics) and 10 μl of Superfect reagent. The mixture was incubated at room temperature for 10 min, 600 μl of RPMI 1640 complete medium was added and immediately placed onto the cells in 6-well plates, and luciferase activity was measured 16–24 h later. For CL-2 cell transfection, reporter (10 μg) and expression vectors (30 μg) were transfected into 107 CL-2 cells by electroporation, and luciferase activity was measured 16 h later. When indicated, murine IFN-γ (10 ng/ml) was added to the culture for 6–12 h before harvest. The cells were harvested with reporter lysis buffer (Promega), and 20 μl of extract was assayed for luciferase as described (30Plevy S.E. Gemberling J.H. Hsu S. Dorner A.J. Smale S.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4572-4588Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Cells were co-transfected with a constitutively active cytomegalovirus promoter-β-galactosidase reporter plasmid to normalize experiments for transfection efficiency. For retroviral transduction we used a derivative of the Moloney murine leukemia virus vector pMMP412 (32Pickl W.F. Pimentel-Muinos F.X. Seed B. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 7175-7183Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), courtesy of Dr. Adrain Ting (Mount Sinai School of Medicine). To prepare pseudotyped virus human 293 EbnaT cells were seeded at a density of 4 × 106 cells in a 10-cm dish. The next day, cells were transfected using calcium phosphate with a mixture of 2.5 μg of plasmid pMD.G encoding vesicular stomatitis virus G protein, 7.5 μg of plasmid pMD.OGP encoding gag-pol, and 10 μg of the retroviral expression construct. 48 h post-transfection, the viral supernatant was collected, centrifuged at 800 ×g, and used to infect cells. RAW264.7 and CL-2 cells (5 × 106 cells) were resuspended in 12 ml of viral supernatant in the presence of polybrene (4 μg/ml), aliquoted into six-well plates, and spun at 800 × g in a microtiter rotor for 1 h at room temperature. RAW264.7 cell nuclear extracts were prepared as described previously (33Lo K. Landau N.R. Smale S.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5229-5243Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). EMSA probes were prepared by annealing complementary single-stranded oligonucleotides with 5′GATC overhangs (Genosys Biotechnologies, Inc.) and were labeled by filling in with [α-32P]dGTP and [α-32P]dCTP using Klenow enzyme. Labeled probes were purified with Nuctrap purification columns (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The sequence of the EMSA probe (−935 to −905) is 5′gatcACACTGTCTCA-ATATTTCACTTTCATAATGGAAAAT. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays were performed as described previously (34Zhu C. Gagnidze K. Gemberling J.H. Plevy S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18519-18528Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), using 105-cpm probe and 5 μg of nuclear extracts per reaction. DNA binding complexes were separated by 5% polyacrylamide-Tris/glycine-EDTA gel run at 4 °C for 4 h at 150 volts. Gels were dried and exposed to Eastman Kodak Co. X-AR 5 film at −80 °C in the presence of an intensifying screen. Nuclear protein extracts and pre-stained molecular weight markers were denatured in Laemmli buffer (10% glycerol, 2% SDS, 0.1 m dithiothreitol, 65 mmTris, 0.01 mg/ml bromphenol blue) at 90 °C, separated by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. After protein transfer, the membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat milk in TBST (Triton-containing Tris-buffered saline), incubated with anti-iNOS, anti-ICSBP, anti-IRF-1, or anti-IRF-2 antibodies (1:6000) for 1–2 h, washed with TBST, and stained with anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG conjugated to peroxidase (1:6000). Immunoreactivity was visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence reaction (enhanced chemiluminescence kit; Santa Cruz Biotechnology). For RT-PCR assays, total RNA was extracted using TRIzol (Invitrogen). cDNA was prepared from 1–3 μg of RNA with Superscript II RT (Invitrogen) and random hexamer primers (Promega). The following primers were used for PCR amplification: IL-12 p40, 5′-TCGCAGCAAGATGTG-3′ and 5′-GAGCAGCAGATGT-GAGTGGC; iNOS, 5′-CCCTTCCGAAGTTTCTGGCAGCAGC-3′ and 5′-GGCTGTC-AGAGCCTCGTGGCTTTGG-3′. PCR was carried out by a standard protocol for appropriate cycles. An equal aliquot of cDNA was amplified with β-actin primers. Aliquots of PCR reactions were resolved on a 1% agarose gel and visualized with UV light after staining with ethidium bromide. RAW264.7 cells were activated with IFN-γ for 4 h. Then cells were washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed for 15 min on ice in 0.5 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 280 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.2 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 10% glycerol, and 1 mm dithiothreitol) containing protease inhibitors. Cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 4 °C for 15 min at 14,000 rpm. Cells lysates were incubated with 2 μg of IRF-1 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) in the presence of 20 μl of 50% (v/v) protein G-agarose overnight at 4 °C with gentle rocking. After three washings with lysis buffer, precipitated complexes were solubilized by boiling in SDS buffer, fractionated by 10% SDS-PAGE, and transferred to nitrocellulose. Western blotting was performed using ICSBP antibody. The experiments were performed using a chromatin immunoprecipitation (Chip) assay kit from Upstate Biotechnology according to the manufacturer's protocol. RAW264.7 cells were cultured in complete Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, activated with IFN-γ for 4 h, fixed with 1% formaldehyde for 30 min at room temperature, and immunoprecipitated with anti-ICSBP antibody. The immunoprecipitated DNA was amplified by PCR with primers spanning from −1000 to −788 in the murine iNOS p40 promoter region. Macrophages from ICSBP−/− mice are impaired in IFN-γ-induced NO production (29Contursi C. Wang I.M. Gabriele L. Gadina M. O'Shea J. Morse III, H.C. Ozato K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 91-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), which suggests that ICSBP is involved directly in the regulation of iNOS gene expression. Because ICSBP is a transcription factor, we hypothesize that the murine iNOS promoter region may have an ICSBP site to which ICSBP can bind, resulting in the IFN-γ-induced activation of the iNOS promoter. The mouse iNOS promoter has an enhancer and basal promoter, within which a number of response elements have been localized. Those known to be active include NF-κB sites located both in the enhancer and basal promoter and two ISRE. The distal ISRE element (−923 to −913) is a strong activator, whereas the proximal one has no significant effect on iNOS promoter activation (16Kamijo R. Harada H. Matsuyama T. Bosland M. Gerecitano J. Shapiro D., Le, J. Koh S.I. Kimura T. Green S.J. et al.Science. 1994; 263: 1612-1615Crossref PubMed Scopus (787) Google Scholar, 35Martin E. Nathan C. Xie Q.W. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 977-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). In the present study, the ISRE site between −923 and −913 was selected for the analysis, because this site is important for full induction of iNOS gene expression by IFN-γ. This site was also reported previously (16Kamijo R. Harada H. Matsuyama T. Bosland M. Gerecitano J. Shapiro D., Le, J. Koh S.I. Kimura T. Green S.J. et al.Science. 1994; 263: 1612-1615Crossref PubMed Scopus (787) Google Scholar) as a binding site for IRF-1. RAW264.7 cells were activated with IFN-γ, LPS, or IFN-γ plus LPS for 4 h, and nuclear proteins were extracted for EMSA, which was performed by using probe spanning −935 to −905 of the iNOS promoter region containing −923 to −913 of the ISRE site. A protein·oligonucleotide complex was formed that is inducible by IFN-γ and unaffected by LPS (Fig. 1 A). When we used probe (−935 to −905) with mutations of ISRE site (TTTCACTTTC to GCCGTAGGCA), there was no DNA·protein complex formation (data not shown). Furthermore, ICSBP antibody blocked the formation of DNA·protein complex (Fig. 1 B), which suggests that ICSBP can bind to this ISRE site. To confirm this result, we performed chromatin co-immunoprecipitation experiments. PCR analysis showed that ICSBP antibody precipitated the iNOS promoter region (−2000 to −788) from RAW264.7 cells activated with IFN-γ for 4 h. (Fig. 1 C). Western blotting experiments revealed that IFN-γ induced ICSBP protein expression in RAW264.7 cells (Fig. 1 D). These results strongly suggest that the ISRE site (−923 to −913) of the iNOS promoter region is a binding site for ICSBP. The above data indicate that ICSBP can bind to the ISRE site (−923 to −913) in the iNOS promoter region. The effect of overexpressing ICSBP on iNOS promoter activity was analyzed next. RAW264.7 cells were co-transfected with an iNOS promoter luciferase reporter construct and an ICSBP expression plasmid for 12 h and activated with IFN-γ for 8 h prior to determination of luciferase activity. Co-transfection of ICSBP strongly enhanced IFN-induced iNOS promoter activity (Fig. 2 A). Showing the importance of the ISRE site, IFN-γ-induced activity from an iNOS promoter with a mutated ISRE site (CTTTC into TGCCT) was inhibited 90%, and co-transfection with the ICSBP expression plasmid had no effect on the IFN-γ-induced activity (Fig. 2, A and B). The synergistic induction of the mutated iNOS promoter activation by IFN-γ and LPS was reduced by 40%, but the mutation has no effect on LPS-induced iNOS promoter activity (Fig. 2 B). The results indicate that ICSBP is important for IFN-γ-induced iNOS promoter activation. To analyze further the importance of ICSBP in the activation of the iNOS promoter, we tested ICSBP−/− macrophages for IFN-γ induced NO production and iNOS mRNA and protein expression. Both RAW264.7 cells and CL-2 cells were activated with IFN-γ (10 ng/ml) for 12 h (protein) or 72 h (nitrite). CL-2 cells had a reduced iNOS protein expression and nitrite accumulation induced by IFN-γ compared with RAW264.7 cells (Fig. 3, A and B). To determine iNOS promoter activation in CL-2 cells, RAW264.7 cells and CL-2 cells were transfected with iNOS promoter luciferase reporter construct. iNOS promoter activation induced by IFN-γ was strongly impaired in CL-2 cells (Fig. 3 C). However, co-transfection of ICSBP moderately rescued the iNOS promoter activation induced by IFN-γ in CL-2 cells. All these results suggest that ICSBP is important for iNOS expression induced by IFN-γ. The data above showed that CL-2 cells were deficient in NO production induced by IFN-γ. To demonstrate the importance of ICSBP for iNOS gene expression, we transduced ICSBP into ICSBP−/− macrophages to rescue iNOS gene expression. The transduction efficiency judged by GFP fluorescence was around 70–80% by fluorescence-activated cell sorter (data not shown). Cells were activated with IFN-γ and analyzed for iNOS mRNA and protein and nitrite accumulation. After transduction of ICSBP, IFN-γ-induced iNOS expression and nitrite accumulation were rescued (Fig. 4, A–C). In addition, the synthesis of IL-12 expression, another IFN-γ-regulated gene, was rescued, as well (Fig. 4 D). Unexpectedly, transduction of ICSBP alone did not rescue iNOS expression, although ICSBP protein was clearly expressed (Fig. 4, A–C). These results suggest that ICSBP alone is not sufficient for iNOS gene expression. To explain the requirement for both IFN-γ and ICSBP to rescue iNOS transcription and NO production in CL-2 cells, we suggest that either another transcription factor may be needed or that IFN-γ induces post-translational modification of ICSBP. We first examined whether ICSBP can bind to the ISRE site of the iNOS promoter. After transduction with ICSBP or GFP as a control, CL-2 cells were incubated with or without IFN-γ for 4 h, nuclear protein was extracted, and EMSA was performed with a probe (−935 to −905) containing the iNOS promoter ISRE site (−923 to −913). Interestingly, EMSA experiments indicated that transduction with ICSBP alone did not result in DNA·protein complex formation, which was, however, seen after activation with IFN-γ (Fig. 5 A). Furthermore, cycloheximide prevented the formation of this complex (Fig. 5 B), suggesting that synthesis of another IFN-induced transcription factor is needed for ICSBP to bind to the ISRE site of iNOS promoter. ICSBP is known to form complexes with IRF-1 or IRF-2. When RAW264.7 cells were activated with IFN-γ for 4 h, Western blotting results indicated that IFN-γ strongly induces IRF-1 protein expression (Fig. 6 A). However, because IFN-γ has no effect on IRF-2 protein expression (Fig. 6 A), IRF-1 is therefore the more likely candidate as the ICSBP partner. The ISRE site in the iNOS promoter region (−923 to −913) was identified as an IRF-1 binding site in previous studies (16Kamijo R. Harada H. Matsuyama T. Bosland M. Gerecitano J. Shapiro D., Le, J. Koh S.I. Kimura T. Green S.J. et al.Science. 1994; 263: 1612-1615Crossref PubMed Scopus (787) Google Scholar), and IRF-1 −/− mice are defective in NO production. In addition, IRF-1 binds to the same ISRE site that we identified as an ICSBP site. To confirm the binding of IRF-1 to the ISRE site, we transduced ICSBP−/− macrophages with ICSBP and activated the cells with IFN-γ for 4 h. Nuclear protein was extracted, and EMSA was performed using a probe (−935 to −905) bracketing the ISRE site (−923 to −913). Both ICSBP and IRF-1 antibodies prevented the DNA·protein complex formation (Fig. 6 B), showing the presence of both proteins in the DNA·protein complex. In addition, co-immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated that a complex formed between ICSBP and IRF-1 in nuclear proteins from IFN-γ-activated RAW264.7 cells (Fig. 6 C). When RAW264.7 cells were co-transfected with an iNOS luciferase reporter and both ICSBP and IRF-1, strong luciferase activity was observed, whereas transfection with ICSBP or IRF-1 alone only weakly induced iNOS promoter activation (Fig. 6 D). Co-transduction with ICSBP and IRF-1 induced iNOS expression and nitrite accumulation, whereas transduction of with either ICSBP or IRF-1 alone was not sufficient to induce iNOS expression (Fig. 6 F). These results suggest that the complex formation of ICSBP with IRF-1 is essential for iNOS gene expression. IL-4 is a Th2 cytokine that can counteract the effects of IFN-γ and thus serves as an anti-inflammatory molecule. IL-4 can suppress iNOS expression in both primary macrophages and RAW264.7 cells treated with IFN-γ. In the present study, we demonstrated that complex formation of ICSBP with IRF-1 is essential for iNOS induction by IFN-γ. To test whether the ICSBP·IRF-1 complex is a target of IL-4, we first analyzed the effect of IL-4 on iNOS gene expression. RAW264.7 cells pretreated with IL-4 (10 ng/ml) for 1 h were activated with IFN-γ, after which iNOS mRNA and protein expression and nitrite accumulation were determined. IL-4 clearly inhibited iNOS expression and nitrite accumulation induced by IFN-γ (Fig. 7, A–C). We next analyzed the effect of IL-4 on IFN-γ-induced DNA·protein complex formation by EMSA with probe covering iNOS promoter ISRE site (−923 to −913). The results showed that IL-4 prevented the DNA·protein complex formation between ICSBP and IRF-1 (Fig. 7 D). Co-immunoprecipitation experiments indicated that the physical binding of ICSBP with IRF-1 was attenuated by the pretreatment with IL-4 (Fig. 7 E). These results suggest that the interaction of ICSBP with IRF-1 may be the target for the IL-4-mediated inhibition of IFN-γ-induced iNOS expression. This study describes the role of ICSBP in the regulation of murine macrophage iNOS gene expression. An ICSBP binding site in the iNOS promoter region (−923 to −913) was identified, and we show that the complex formed by ICSBP and IRF-1 is essential for IFN-γ-induced iNOS gene expression. IL-4, a Th2 cytokine that inhibits IFN-γ-induced iNOS gene expression, attenuates the physical interaction of ICSBP with IRF-1. Thus, complex formation of ICSBP with IRF-1 is a central element in i"

While studying the subcellular localization of a NS5B mutant lacking the C-terminal membrane-anchoring domain, NS5Bt, we found that expression of the green fluorescent protein (GFP)-fused form was exclusively nucleolar. Interestingly, the distribution of endogenous nucleolin changed greatly in the cells expressing GFP-NS5B, with nucleolin colocalized with GFP-NS5B in perinuclear regions in addition to the nucleolus, suggesting that NS5B retains the ability to bind nucleolin. The interaction between nucleolin and NS5B was demonstrated by GST pull-down assay. GST pull-down assay results indicated that C-terminal region of nucleolin was important for its binding to NS5B. Scanning clustered alanine substitution mutants library of NS5B revealed two sites on NS5B that binds nucleolin. NS5B amino acids 208-214 and 500-506 were both found to be indispensable for the nucleolin binding. We reported that the latter sequence is essential for oligomerization of NS5B, which is a prerequisite for the RdRP activity. C-terminal nucleolin inhibited the NS5B RdRP activity in a dose-dependent manner. Taken together, this indicates the binding ability of nucleolin may be involved in NS5B functions."
https://openalex.org/W2020865685,"A sperm nucleus glutathione peroxidase (snGPx), which is closely related to the phospholipid hydroperoxide glutathione peroxidase (phGPx), was recently discovered in late spermatids. Both GPx isoforms originate from a joint ph/snGPx gene, but their N-terminal peptides are encoded by alternative first exons. The expression of the two enzymes is differentially regulated in various cells, but little is known about the regulatory mechanisms. To explore the tissue-specific regulation of expression of the two isoenzymes, we first investigated their tissue distribution. Whereas phGPx is expressed at low levels in many organs, snGPx was only detected in testis, kidney, and in the human embryonic kidney cell line HEK293. Subcellular fractionation studies and immunoelectron microscopy revealed a cytosolic localization. To explore the mechanistic reasons for the differential expression pattern, we first tested the activity of the putative phGPx and snGPx promoters. The 5′-flanking region of the joint ph/snGPx gene exhibits strong promoter activity. In contrast, the putative snGPx promoter, which comprises 334 bp of intronic sequences, lacks major promoter activity. However, it strongly suppresses the activity of the ph/snGPx promoter. These data suggest negative regulatory elements in the first intron of the ph/snGPx gene, and DNase protection assays revealed the existence of several protein-binding sites. The corresponding trans-regulatory proteins (SP1, ERG1, GATA1, SREBP1, USF1, and CREBP1) were identified, and in vivo binding of EGR1 and SREBP1 was shown by chromatin immunoprecipitation. These data indicate for the first time somatic expression of the snGPx and provide evidence for the existence of intronic negative cis-regulatory elements in the ph/snGPx gene. Our failure to detect an alternative snGPx promoter suggests that transcription of the ph/snGPx gene may be regulated by a joint basic promoter.

Med. 2002; 33: 154-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar), but there are only 4 distinct seleno GPx genes. The most recently discovered member (5Pfeifer H. Conrad M. Roethlein D. Kyriakopouluos A. Brielmeier M. Bornkamm G.W. Behne D. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 1236-1238Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) of this enzyme family is the sperm nucleus glutathione peroxidase (snGPx). It constitutes a 34-kDa selenoprotein that is expressed at a high level in late spermatids of various species and has been implicated in chromatin condensation during sperm development and in antioxidative protection of sperm DNA. It is localized in the spermatid nuclei, and its expression is strongly impaired under selenium deficiency (5Pfeifer H. Conrad M. Roethlein D. Kyriakopouluos A. Brielmeier M. Bornkamm G.W. Behne D. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 1236-1238Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 6Behne D. Kyriakopoulos A. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 2001; 21: 453-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). The snGPx shares a high degree of protein-chemical similarity (5Pfeifer H. Conrad M. Roethlein D. Kyriakopouluos A. Brielmeier M. Bornkamm G.W. Behne D. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 1236-1238Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 7Roveri A. Maiorino M. Nisii C. Ursini F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1208: 211-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) with the previously described phospholipid hydroperoxide glutathione peroxidase (phGPx), because both GPx isoforms originate from a joint ph/snGPx gene (5Pfeifer H. Conrad M. Roethlein D. Kyriakopouluos A. Brielmeier M. Bornkamm G.W. Behne D. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 1236-1238Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). In fact, their C-terminal peptides (about 60% of the snGPx) are identical and they are encoded for by exons 2 to 7 of the joint ph/snGPx gene. In contrast, the N-terminal peptides of the two enzymes originate from alternative first exons (Scheme FS1). The N-terminal peptide of snGPx 7 (15 kDa) contains an arginine-rich nuclear insertion sequence, which enables nuclear localization and is unique among selenoproteins (5Pfeifer H. Conrad M. Roethlein D. Kyriakopouluos A. Brielmeier M. Bornkamm G.W. Behne D. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 1236-1238Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). In contrast, the N-terminal peptide of the phGPx is much shorter (about 3 kDa) and lacks a nuclear import sequence. Because both GPx isoforms are encoded for by the same gene, the two enzymes may be considered splicing variants of a joint ph/snGPx pre-mRNA (3Brigelius-Flohé R. Free Radical Biol. Med. 1999; 27: 951-965Crossref PubMed Scopus (869) Google Scholar, 4Kuhn H. Borchert A. Free Radical Biol. Med. 2002; 33: 154-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). However, it is not clear whether expression of the two proteins really involves the formation of a joint pre-mRNA or whether there are distinct transcription initiation sites and alternative promoters. Considering the given genetic composition (Scheme FS1) it may be speculated that the 5′-flanking region of the ph/snGPx gene is of functional relevance only for phGPx transcription. In contrast, the immediate 5′-flanking region of exon E1b (first snGPx exon) that includes the 5′ part of intron 1 (I1a in Scheme FS1) and exon 1a (first phGPx exon) may contain regulatory elements for snGPx transcription. In fact, stringent in silico structural analysis of I1a indicated the presence of putative transcription factor binding sites. These data suggested the existence of an independent transcriptional regulation of phGPx and snGPx expression.The various isoforms of seleno-GPx show a remarkable tissue-specific expression pattern (3Brigelius-Flohé R. Free Radical Biol. Med. 1999; 27: 951-965Crossref PubMed Scopus (869) Google Scholar). The phGPx is expressed at relatively low levels in most cells and tissues tested (8Knopp E.A. Arndt T.L. Eng K.L. Caldwell M. LeBoeuf R.C. Deeb S.S. O'Brien K.D. Mamm. Genome. 1999; 10: 601-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 9Dreher I. Schmutzler C. Jakob F. Kohrle J. J. Trace Elem. Med. Biol. 1997; 11: 83-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) but is much more prominent in testis (10Ursini F. Heim S. Kiess M. Maiorino M. Roveri A. Wissing J. Flohe L. Science. 1999; 285: 1393-1396Crossref PubMed Scopus (714) Google Scholar). By contrast, snGPx mRNA has only been detected in testis and its expression appears to be restricted to late stages of spermatogenesis (5Pfeifer H. Conrad M. Roethlein D. Kyriakopouluos A. Brielmeier M. Bornkamm G.W. Behne D. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 1236-1238Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Unfortunately, the regulatory mechanisms involved in high level expression of phGPx in germinative cells and repression of snGPx expression in most somatic tissues are unknown. Moreover, the molecular processes of transcriptional activation of snGPx expression during late sperm development remain to be investigated.The lack of experimental data on the regulation of expression of the ph/snGPx gene and the remarkable tissue-specific expression pattern of the two GPx isoforms prompted us to study the regulatory mechanisms involved in ph/snGPx expression. Here we report for the first time that snGPx does not only occur in the nucleus of late spermatids but also in the cytosol of interstitial kidney cells. Moreover, we found that the regulation of expression of the joint ph/snGPx gene appears to be a complex process that requires cis-regulatory elements in the 5′-flanking region of the ph/snGPx gene and the binding of negativetrans-regulatory proteins, such as SREBP1 and EGR1, to intronic sequences (I1a). The lack of major promoter activity in the 5′-flanking region of the first snGPx exon argues against the existence of alternative phGPx/snGPx promoters but strongly suggests alternative splicing of a joint ph/snGPx pre-mRNA as mechanistic reason for differential expression of the two enzymes.DISCUSSIONGPxs constitute a family of functionally related enzymes and the phGPx and snGPx are two members of this family. Whereas phGPx is expressed at low levels in many cells and tissues (3Brigelius-Flohé R. Free Radical Biol. Med. 1999; 27: 951-965Crossref PubMed Scopus (869) Google Scholar, 8Knopp E.A. Arndt T.L. Eng K.L. Caldwell M. LeBoeuf R.C. Deeb S.S. O'Brien K.D. Mamm. Genome. 1999; 10: 601-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), snGPx was only detected in late spermatids of several mammalian species (5Pfeifer H. Conrad M. Roethlein D. Kyriakopouluos A. Brielmeier M. Bornkamm G.W. Behne D. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 1236-1238Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). In these cells the enzyme was predominantly localized in the nucleus and has been implicated in chromatin structuring during sperm development and in antioxidative defense of the DNA (4Kuhn H. Borchert A. Free Radical Biol. Med. 2002; 33: 154-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 5Pfeifer H. Conrad M. Roethlein D. Kyriakopouluos A. Brielmeier M. Bornkamm G.W. Behne D. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 1236-1238Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 6Behne D. Kyriakopoulos A. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 2001; 21: 453-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). In this paper we report for the first time that snGPx is also expressed in selected somatic cells (interstitial kidney cells). Immunohistochemical staining, immunoelectron microscopy, and subcellular fractionation studies indicate that the enzyme is located predominantly in the cytosol. This localization was rather surprising because snGPx contains a nuclear import peptide that has been proposed to target the protein to the nucleus. Currently, it is unclear why the enzyme is transported into the nucleus in late spermatids and why it remains in the cytosol in interstitial kidney cells. It is possible that nuclear import requires additional factors, which may not be present at the required concentration in the kidney cells.The kidney-specific function of the snGPx has not yet been investigated. Because the enzyme is mainly expressed in interstitial cells but not in the glomeruli, the tubulus epithelium, or the collecting ducts, it is unlikely to play a role in urine production. Alternatively, the renal snGPx may be involved in antioxidative defense as it has been suggested before for other GPx isoforms (21Maiorino M. Thomas J.P. Girotti A.W. Ursini F. Free Radical Res. Commun. 1991; 12–13: 131-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). It is well known that there is an active oxidative metabolism in renal cortex, which may be accompanied by the formation of reactive oxygen species (22Gille L. Staniek K. Nohl H. Free Radical Biol. Med. 2001; 30: 865-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 23Gabbita S.P. Butterfield D.A. Hensley K. Shaw W. Carney J.M. Free Radical Biol. Med. 1997; 23: 191-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar).Compared with other selenoperoxidases, which are encoded for by separate genes, phGPx and snGPx originate from a joint ph/snGPx gene (4Kuhn H. Borchert A. Free Radical Biol. Med. 2002; 33: 154-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 5Pfeifer H. Conrad M. Roethlein D. Kyriakopouluos A. Brielmeier M. Bornkamm G.W. Behne D. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 1236-1238Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, both isoforms are differentially expressed in various cells and tissues, but virtually nothing is known about the regulatory mechanisms. Here we report that the minimal promoter of the phGPx (cytosolic isoform), which comprises the 5′-flanking region of the ph/snGPx gene and the 5′-untranslated region of its mRNA, exhibits major promoter activity. By contrast, the promoter activity of the 5′-flanking region of E1b (putative snGPx promoter) was almost negligible. These data are difficult to reconcile with the existence of alternative phGPx/snGPx promoters. They rather suggest that transcription of the ph/snGPx gene is driven by joint regulatory sequences located upstream of the 3′-ATG of the ph/snGPx gene. Interestingly, the joint ph/snGPx promoter can be strongly down-regulated by inhibitory proteins that bind to intronic regulatory sequences of I1a. Possible suppressor protein candidates include members of several transcription factor families (e.g. SP, EGR, GATA, SREBP, USF, and CREBP). Functional introniccis-regulatory elements have been reported to be involved in the regulation of expression of several genes (24Standiford D.M. Sun W.T. Davis M.B. Emerson C.P. Genetics. 2001; 157: 259-271PubMed Google Scholar, 25Zabel M.D. Byrne B.L. Weis J.J. Weis J.H. J. Immunol. 1998; 165: 4437-4445Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar), but the detailed mechanisms of action are unknown.RT-PCR of snGPx transcripts indicated the presence of incomplete splicing products that selectively contain I1a (Fig. 1). Interestingly, we have never observed splicing problems with introns 2–5 of the ph/snGPx gene. Although the mechanistic reasons for this incomplete splicing have not been investigated in this study, the identified transcription factors may be involved. It has been reported before that transcription factors that prefer to bind to double stranded DNA are also capable of binding to single stranded RNA (26Zhai G. Iskandar M. Barilla K. Romaniuk P.J. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 2032-2040Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 27Draper D.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 293: 255-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). Thus, they may be of regulatory importance for the splicing process. Alternative exons are frequently flanked by suboptimal splicing sites, and an increasing body of experimental evidence has indicated that effective outsplicing of alternative exons requires the participation of splicing enhancers and/or silencers in addition to the constitutive spliceosomal machinery (28Gee S.L. Aoyagi K. Lersch R. Hou V., Wu, M. Conboy J.G. Blood. 2000; 95: 692-699Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The presence of such auxiliary proteins may help to define the exact splicing sites, and may also be important for maturation-dependent and tissue-specific alterations of the protein expression patterns. cis-Regulatory pre-mRNA sequences that bind the trans-acting splicing factors may reside in the alternative exon itself (29Liu H.X. Zhang M. Krainer A.R. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1998-2012Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar), in the flanking introns (30Modafferi E.F. Black D.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6537-6545Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 31Ashiya M. Grabowski P.J. RNA (New York). 1997; 3: 996-1015PubMed Google Scholar), and even in an adjacent exon (32Tsukahara T. Casciato C. Helfman D.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 22: 2318-2325Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Inclusion of an alternative exon in the final mRNA is a multistep process that involves timely differentiated removal of the two flanking introns. In fact, in several alternatively spliced pre-mRNA species it has been demonstrated that one flanking exon is removed before the other (33Helfman D.M. Ricci W.M. Finn L.A. Genes Dev. 1988; 2: 1627-1638Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar,34Nasim F.H. Spears P.A. Hoffmann H.M. Kuo H.C. Grabowski P.J. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1172-1184Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Although the detailed splicing mechanism of the ph/snGPx pre-mRNA was not the focus of this study, we have identified functional cis-regulatory sequences in the 5′-flanking intron of alternative exon E1b, which may be related to the splicing process. Additional stringent in silico search for similarcis-regulatory elements in E1b also suggested the existence of SP1/WT1-binding sites and preliminary DNase protection assays suggested their functionality (data not shown). Similarly, the 3′-flanking intron of E1b (I1b) also contains binding sites for several transcription factors (GABP1, OCT1P1, and GATA3), but their functionality has not been tested. Taken together, these data suggest the presence of cis-regulatory elements in the alternative exon E1b and in the flanking introns I1a and I1b. Such a constellation is frequently found in genes containing alternative exons, and thecis-regulatory sequences may serve as binding regions for splicing enhancers and/or silencers.In the light of these findings the functional cis-regulatory elements identified in I1a and the correspondingtrans-regulatory proteins may be of dual functional importance: (i) they may act as negative regulators of transcriptional initiation of the ph/snGPx gene (Fig. 5) and (ii) they may exhibit auxiliary function for alternative splicing of the joint ph/snGPx mRNA. Work is in progress in our laboratory to provide more detailed information on either process. Selenium-containing glutathione peroxidases (GPx)1 constitute a family of antioxidative enzymes that are capable of reducing organic and inorganic hydroperoxides to the corresponding hydroxy compounds utilizing glutathione or other hydrogen donors as reducing equivalents (1Flohé L.

In contrast, the N-terminal peptide of the phGPx is much shorter (about 3 kDa) and lacks a nuclear import sequence.

Med. 1999; 27: 951-965Crossref PubMed Scopus (869) Google Scholar, 4Kuhn H. Borchert A. Free Radical Biol. Med. 2002; 33: 154-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). However, it is not clear whether expression of the two proteins really involves the formation of a joint pre-mRNA or whether there are distinct transcription initiation sites and alternative promoters. Considering the given genetic composition (Scheme FS1) it may be speculated that the 5′-flanking region of the ph/snGPx gene is of functional relevance only for phGPx transcription. In contrast, the immediate 5′-flanking region of exon E1b (first snGPx exon) that includes the 5′ part of intron 1 (I1a in Scheme FS1) and exon 1a (first phGPx exon) may contain regulatory elements for snGPx transcription. In fact, stringent in silico structural analysis of I1a indicated the presence of putative transcription factor binding sites. These data suggested the existence of an independent transcriptional regulation of phGPx and snGPx expression. The various isoforms of seleno-GPx show a remarkable tissue-specific expression pattern (3Brigelius-Flohé R. Free Radical Biol. Med. 1999; 27: 951-965Crossref PubMed Scopus (869) Google Scholar). The phGPx is expressed at relatively low levels in most cells and tissues tested (8Knopp E.A. Arndt T.L. Eng K.L. Caldwell M. LeBoeuf R.C. Deeb S.S. O'Brien K.D. Mamm. Genome. 1999; 10: 601-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 9Dreher I. Schmutzler C. Jakob F. Kohrle J. J. Trace Elem. Med. Biol. 1997; 11: 83-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) but is much more prominent in testis (10Ursini F. Heim S. Kiess M. Maiorino M. Roveri A. Wissing J. Flohe L. Science. 1999; 285: 1393-1396Crossref PubMed Scopus (714) Google Scholar). By contrast, snGPx mRNA has only been detected in testis and its expression appears to be restricted to late stages of spermatogenesis (5Pfeifer H. Conrad M. Roethlein D. Kyriakopouluos A. Brielmeier M. Bornkamm G.W. Behne D. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 1236-1238Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Unfortunately, the regulatory mechanisms involved in high level expression of phGPx in germinative cells and repression of snGPx expression in most somatic tissues are unknown. Moreover, the molecular processes of transcriptional activation of snGPx expression during late sperm development remain to be investigated. The lack of experimental data on the regulation of expression of the ph/snGPx gene and the remarkable tissue-specific expression pattern of the two GPx isoforms prompted us to study the regulatory mechanisms involved in ph/snGPx expression. Here we report for the first time that snGPx does not only occur in the nucleus of late spermatids but also in the cytosol of interstitial kidney cells. Moreover, we found that the regulation of expression of the joint ph/snGPx gene appears to be a complex process that requires cis-regulatory elements in the 5′-flanking region of the ph/snGPx gene and the binding of negativetrans-regulatory proteins, such as SREBP1 and EGR1, to intronic sequences (I1a). The lack of major promoter activity in the 5′-flanking region of the first snGPx exon argues against the existence of alternative phGPx/snGPx promoters but strongly suggests alternative splicing of a joint ph/snGPx pre-mRNA as mechanistic reason for differential expression of the two enzymes. DISCUSSIONGPxs constitute a family of functionally related enzymes and the phGPx and snGPx are two members of this family. Whereas phGPx is expressed at low levels in many cells and tissues (3Brigelius-Flohé R. Free Radical Biol. Med. 1999; 27: 951-965Crossref PubMed Scopus (869) Google Scholar, 8Knopp E.A. Arndt T.L. Eng K.L. Caldwell M. LeBoeuf R.C. Deeb S.S. O'Brien K.D. Mamm. Genome. 1999; 10: 601-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), snGPx was only detected in late spermatids of several mammalian species (5Pfeifer H. Conrad M. Roethlein D. Kyriakopouluos A. Brielmeier M. Bornkamm G.W. Behne D. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 1236-1238Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). In these cells the enzyme was predominantly localized in the nucleus and has been implicated in chromatin structuring during sperm development and in antioxidative defense of the DNA (4Kuhn H. Borchert A. Free Radical Biol. Med. 2002; 33: 154-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 5Pfeifer H. Conrad M. Roethlein D. Kyriakopouluos A. Brielmeier M. Bornkamm G.W. Behne D. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 1236-1238Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 6Behne D. Kyriakopoulos A. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 2001; 21: 453-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). In this paper we report for the first time that snGPx is also expressed in selected somatic cells (interstitial kidney cells). Immunohistochemical staining, immunoelectron microscopy, and subcellular fractionation studies indicate that the enzyme is located predominantly in the cytosol. This localization was rather surprising because snGPx contains a nuclear import peptide that has been proposed to target the protein to the nucleus. Currently, it is unclear why the enzyme is transported into the nucleus in late spermatids and why it remains in the cytosol in interstitial kidney cells. It is possible that nuclear import requires additional factors, which may not be present at the required concentration in the kidney cells.The kidney-specific function of the snGPx has not yet been investigated. Because the enzyme is mainly expressed in interstitial cells but not in the glomeruli, the tubulus epithelium, or the collecting ducts, it is unlikely to play a role in urine production. Alternatively, the renal snGPx may be involved in antioxidative defense as it has been suggested before for other GPx isoforms (21Maiorino M. Thomas J.P. Girotti A.W. Ursini F. Free Radical Res. Commun. 1991; 12–13: 131-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). It is well known that there is an active oxidative metabolism in renal cortex, which may be accompanied by the formation of reactive oxygen species (22Gille L. Staniek K. Nohl H. Free Radical Biol. Med. 2001; 30: 865-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 23Gabbita S.P. Butterfield D.A. Hensley K. Shaw W. Carney J.M. Free Radical Biol. Med. 1997; 23: 191-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar).Compared with other selenoperoxidases, which are encoded for by separate genes, phGPx and snGPx originate from a joint ph/snGPx gene (4Kuhn H. Borchert A. Free Radical Biol. Med. 2002; 33: 154-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 5Pfeifer H. Conrad M. Roethlein D. Kyriakopouluos A. Brielmeier M. Bornkamm G.W. Behne D. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 1236-1238Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, both isoforms are differentially expressed in various cells and tissues, but virtually nothing is known about the regulatory mechanisms. Here we report that the minimal promoter of the phGPx (cytosolic isoform), which comprises the 5′-flanking region of the ph/snGPx gene and the 5′-untranslated region of its mRNA, exhibits major promoter activity. By contrast, the promoter activity of the 5′-flanking region of E1b (putative snGPx promoter) was almost negligible. These data are difficult to reconcile with the existence of alternative phGPx/snGPx promoters. They rather suggest that transcription of the ph/snGPx gene is driven by joint regulatory sequences located upstream of the 3′-ATG of the ph/snGPx gene. Interestingly, the joint ph/snGPx promoter can be strongly down-regulated by inhibitory proteins that bind to intronic regulatory sequences of I1a. Possible suppressor protein candidates include members of several transcription factor families (e.g. SP, EGR, GATA, SREBP, USF, and CREBP). Functional introniccis-regulatory elements have been reported to be involved in the regulation of expression of several genes (24Standiford D.M. Sun W.T. Davis M.B. Emerson C.P. Genetics. 2001; 157: 259-271PubMed Google Scholar, 25Zabel M.D. Byrne B.L. Weis J.J. Weis J.H. J. Immunol. 1998; 165: 4437-4445Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar), but the detailed mechanisms of action are unknown.RT-PCR of snGPx transcripts indicated the presence of incomplete splicing products that selectively contain I1a (Fig. 1). Interestingly, we have never observed splicing problems with introns 2–5 of the ph/snGPx gene. Although the mechanistic reasons for this incomplete splicing have not been investigated in this study, the identified transcription factors may be involved. It has been reported before that transcription factors that prefer to bind to double stranded DNA are also capable of binding to single stranded RNA (26Zhai G. Iskandar M. Barilla K. Romaniuk P.J. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 2032-2040Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 27Draper D.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 293: 255-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). Thus, they may be of regulatory importance for the splicing process. Alternative exons are frequently flanked by suboptimal splicing sites, and an increasing body of experimental evidence has indicated that effective outsplicing of alternative exons requires the participation of splicing enhancers and/or silencers in addition to the constitutive spliceosomal machinery (28Gee S.L. Aoyagi K. Lersch R. Hou V., Wu, M. Conboy J.G. Blood. 2000; 95: 692-699Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The presence of such auxiliary proteins may help to define the exact splicing sites, and may also be important for maturation-dependent and tissue-specific alterations of the protein expression patterns. cis-Regulatory pre-mRNA sequences that bind the trans-acting splicing factors may reside in the alternative exon itself (29Liu H.X. Zhang M. Krainer A.R. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1998-2012Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar), in the flanking introns (30Modafferi E.F. Black D.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6537-6545Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 31Ashiya M. Grabowski P.J. RNA (New York). 1997; 3: 996-1015PubMed Google Scholar), and even in an adjacent exon (32Tsukahara T. Casciato C. Helfman D.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 22: 2318-2325Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Inclusion of an alternative exon in the final mRNA is a multistep process that involves timely differentiated removal of the two flanking introns. In fact, in several alternatively spliced pre-mRNA species it has been demonstrated that one flanking exon is removed before the other (33Helfman D.M. Ricci W.M. Finn L.A. Genes Dev. 1988; 2: 1627-1638Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar,34Nasim F.H. Spears P.A. Hoffmann H.M. Kuo H.C. Grabowski P.J. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1172-1184Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Although the detailed splicing mechanism of the ph/snGPx pre-mRNA was not the focus of this study, we have identified functional cis-regulatory sequences in the 5′-flanking intron of alternative exon E1b, which may be related to the splicing process. Additional stringent in silico search for similarcis-regulatory elements in E1b also suggested the existence of SP1/WT1-binding sites and preliminary DNase protection assays suggested their functionality (data not shown). Similarly, the 3′-flanking intron of E1b (I1b) also contains binding sites for several transcription factors (GABP1, OCT1P1, and GATA3), but their functionality has not been tested. Taken together, these data suggest the presence of cis-regulatory elements in the alternative exon E1b and in the flanking introns I1a and I1b. Such a constellation is frequently found in genes containing alternative exons, and thecis-regulatory sequences may serve as binding regions for splicing enhancers and/or silencers.In the light of these findings the functional cis-regulatory elements identified in I1a and the correspondingtrans-regulatory proteins may be of dual functional importance: (i) they may act as negative regulators of transcriptional initiation of the ph/snGPx gene (Fig. 5) and (ii) they may exhibit auxiliary function for alternative splicing of the joint ph/snGPx mRNA. Work is in progress in our laboratory to provide more detailed information on either process.

Central to the replication process is the T4 DNA polymerase (gene product 43 (gp43)), which catalyzes the incorporation of nucleotides in the 5′ to 3′ direction and contains a 3′ to 5′ exonuclease proofreading activity (1Alberts B.M. Frey L. Nature. 1970; 227: 1313-1318Google Scholar). Because the polymerase only synthesizes DNA in the 5′ to 3′ direction, the lagging strand must be synthesized discontinuously in stretches of oligonucleotides known as Okazaki fragments. In the absence of other proteins, the processivity of the polymerase is limited, and a trimeric sliding clamp (gp45) is required to enhance processivity (2Huang C.C. Hearst J.E. Alberts B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 4087-4094Google Scholar, 3Roth A.C. Nossal N.G. Englund P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 1267-1273Google Scholar). The toroidal sliding clamp circumscribes DNA and is assembled onto DNA by a clamp loader (gp44/62) (4Moarefi I. Jeruzalmi D. Turner J. O'Donnell M. Kuriyan J. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 296: 1215-1223Google Scholar). A helicase is required to unwind dsDNA ahead of the polymerase. The bacteriophage T4 replicative helicase (gp41) forms a hexameric ring that encircles the lagging strand and unwinds the DNA duplex with a 5′ to 3′ polarity by hydrolyzing either ATP or GTP (5Dong F. Gogol E.P. von Hippel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7462-7473Google Scholar). Single-stranded regions of DNA exposed by the action of the helicase are covered with single-stranded binding proteins (gp32). gp32 binding prevents formation of DNA secondary structure and reannealing of the duplex, thereby enhancing gp43 DNA polymerase activity (6Huberman J.A. Kornberg A. Alberts B.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1971; 62: 39-52Google Scholar). A helicase assembly protein (gp59) is required for the initial loading of the helicase onto single-stranded DNA (ssDNA)1coated with single-stranded binding proteins (7Tarumi K. Yonesaki T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2614-2619Google Scholar). The activity of the helicase is enhanced by binding of a primase (gp61) (8Dong F. von Hippel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19625-19631Google Scholar, 9Hinton D.M. Nossal N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 12858-12865Google Scholar). The primase synthesizes pentaribonucelotide primers on the lagging strand that are extended by the polymerase into stretches of Okazaki fragments. The primers are later removed, and ligases join the Okazaki fragments to form a continuous complementary strand. Previously, the T4 replisome has been studied as four basic units: a primosome formed from the helicase, primase, and helicase loading protein that is responsible for unwinding of duplex DNA and synthesis of RNA primers on the lagging strand; a holoenzyme containing the polymerase coupled to the sliding clamp on the leading strand; a lagging strand holoenzyme; and a single-stranded DNA-binding protein. However, it is unlikely that these units function separately; more likely, the activities of all four are coupled. For instance, Salinas and Benkovic (10Salinas F. Benkovic S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7196-7201Google Scholar) demonstrated coupling between leading and lagging strand DNA synthesis and suggested that the two polymerases are physically linked. It also seems apparent that the movement of the holoenzyme needs to be coupled with that of the primosome as it unwinds double-stranded DNA during leading strand synthesis. Studies in similar systems have demonstrated this type of interaction. The bacteriophage T7 gene 4 helicase/primase protein has been shown to directly interact with the T7 DNA polymerase (11Notarnicola S.M. Mulcahy H.L. Lee J. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18425-18433Google Scholar). Furthermore, the τ subunit of the DNA polymerase III holoenzyme in Escherichia coli contacts the DnaB helicase, thereby increasing its unwinding activity 10-fold (12Kim S. Dallmann H.G. McHenry C.S. Marians K.J. Cell. 1996; 84: 643-650Google Scholar). Numerous studies have suggested that there is a “functional” interaction between the holoenzyme and the primosome in the T4 replisome. Cha and Alberts (13Cha T.A. Alberts B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12220-12225Google Scholar) demonstrated that only the helicase was needed for strand displacement synthesis by the holoenzyme; the primase and gp32 had no effect on this rate of synthesis. These results indicated that there was molecular communication between the helicase and polymerase. Shrock and Alberts (14Schrock R.D. Alberts B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16678-16682Google Scholar) later suggested that the helicase and polymerase interact, through changes in the processivity of the helicase in a reconstituted replisome. Moreover, Dong et al. (15Dong F. Weitzel S.E. von Hippel P.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14456-14461Google Scholar) showed that rapid and processive strand displacement synthesis could be observed with only the helicase and polymerase in the presence of a macromolecular crowding agent (polyethylene glycol). Presumably, the crowding agent drives the helicase onto the fork, where in turn it interacts with the polymerase to give the observed results (15Dong F. Weitzel S.E. von Hippel P.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14456-14461Google Scholar, 16Delagoutte E. von Hippel P.H. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 4459-4477Google Scholar). An interaction between the polymerase and helicase in the absence of DNA, however, was not found by analytical ultracentrifugation (16Delagoutte E. von Hippel P.H. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 4459-4477Google Scholar). This led to the hypothesis that the coupling between the two proteins might be mediated by formation of a ternary complex with DNA (16Delagoutte E. von Hippel P.H. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 4459-4477Google Scholar). All of these studies provide indirect evidence of a physical interaction between the holoenzyme and the primosome in bacteriophage T4. Potential interactions between the holoenzyme and the primase and gp59 were not analyzed. Moreover, recent studies by the Drake and Von Hippel laboratories (16Delagoutte E. von Hippel P.H. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 4459-4477Google Scholar, 17Kadyrov F.A. Drake J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29559-29566Google Scholar) have indicated that the leading and lagging strand holoenzymes do not actually form a physical complex. To further investigate the formation of complexes between the two holoenzymes and between the holoenzyme and primosome, a number of cross-linking and fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) experiments were conducted. These experiments demonstrate that 1) the polymerase forms a dimer, but only in the presence of DNA or an active replication fork, 2) a physical interaction exists between the leading strand holoenzyme and the primosome, mediated primarily through gp59 and gp43, and 3) the polymerase displaces the gp32 single-stranded binding protein from gp59 upon binding. These results are discussed herein. gp43 was purified as described previously (18Frey M.W. Nossal N.G. Capson T.L. Benkovic S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2579-2583Google Scholar). The protein was dialyzed into 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol before being subjected to cross-linking. The homobifunctional, thiol-thiol cross-linker 1,6 bis-maleimidohexane (BMH) was dissolved in N,N-dimethlyformamide to a concentration of 10 μm. One μl of this solution was added to 19 μl of a solution containing 1 μm gp43 in the absence or presence of 1 μm of a partially double-stranded DNA substrate (34/62-mer, the sequence of which is as follows: 5′-ACT CCT TCC GCA CGT AAT TTT TGA CGC ACG TTG T and 5′-ACA CAG ACG TAC TAT CAT GAC GCC ATC AGA CAA CGT CGT CAA AAA TTA CGT GCG GAA GGA GT). The reaction was allowed to proceed for 3 min and was quenched with 50 mm dithiothreitol (DTT) followed by the addition of 5 μl of SDS-PAGE buffer (150 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 4% SDS, 0.1% bromphenol blue, 30% glycerol). The samples were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (micron), and subjected to a Western blot using an anti-gp43 antibody. The membrane was blocked for 2 h at 25 °C with 3% bovine serum albumin in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 140 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20 (TBST) and then incubated with a 1:3000 dilution of the anti-gp43 antibody in 3% bovine serum albumin in TBST for 10 h at 4 °C. The membrane was then washed with TBST (twice, 10 min each) followed by incubation with a 1:5000 dilution of anti-rabbit IgG antibody linked to horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Biosciences) in 3% bovine serum albumin in TBST. The membrane was again washed twice for 10 min each with TBST and developed with a luminol/hydrogen peroxide mixture (Pierce). This cross-linking procedure was repeated on an active replication system using minicircle DNA as described in the literature (10Salinas F. Benkovic S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7196-7201Google Scholar). In short, a 70-base minicircle was annealed to a 109-mer (partially complementary oligonucleotide providing a 40-base 5′ single-stranded tail that serves as a lagging strand). gp43, gp45, and gp44/62 (at a final concentration of 0.4 μm) were mixed with the DNA substrate (final concentration of 0.2 μm) in the presence of ATP (3 mm final). gp41, gp61, and gp59 (1.2 μm final concentration) were then added, and replication was initiated by the addition of dNTPs (0.8 mm final concentration), rNTPs (0.8 mm final concentration), and ATP (3 mm final concentration). After 1 min, BMH was added (to a final concentration of 5 μm), and the reaction was allowed to proceed for an additional 5 min. Cross-linking was quenched by the addition of 10 mm DTT, and the products were subjected to a Western blot as described above. The site of thiol-thiol cross-linking was mapped using AMCA-TMEA, a cross-linker containing a fluorescent probe (Fig. 2 A), which was synthesized as previously published (19Ishmael F.T. Alley S.C. Benkovic S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20555-20562Google Scholar). gp43 (300 μl of a 30 μm solution) was cross-linked in the presence of the 34/62 partially duplex DNA (3 μl of a 3 mm solution) by mixing it with 30 μl of a 3 mm solution of AMCA-TMEA for 10 min. The reaction was quenched by the addition of 10 μl 1m DTT. The DNA was removed from gp43 by applying the mixture to a mono-Q fast protein liquid chromatography column. Cross-linked, dimeric gp43 was then separated from monomeric gp43 by a Superdex-200 HPLC column. The dimeric gp43 was digested with trypsin and applied to a C-18 column as previously described (20Alley S.C. Ishmael F.T. Jones A.D. Benkovic S.J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2000; 122: 6126-6127Google Scholar). The cross-linked peptides were isolated by collecting the fraction that absorbed at 345 nm (the absorbance of the AMCA probe). This fraction was dried in a speed vac concentrator and analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometry as described previously (19Ishmael F.T. Alley S.C. Benkovic S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20555-20562Google Scholar). gp41, gp59, and gp61 were purified as previously published (19Ishmael F.T. Alley S.C. Benkovic S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20555-20562Google Scholar, 21Ishmael F.T. Alley S.C. Benkovic S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25236-25242Google Scholar, 22Valentine A.M. Ishmael F.T. Shier V.K. Benkovic S.J. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 15074-15085Google Scholar). Before labeling, each protein was dialyzed into 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol. gp41, gp59, and gp61 each contain one free, solvent-exposed cysteine residue: Cys-316, Cys-42, and Cys-144, respectively. The trifunctional cross-linker shown in Fig. 3 A was dissolved inN,N-dimethlyformamide to a concentration of 500 μm, and 5 μl of this solution was added to 50 μl of a 5 μm solution of either gp41, gp59, or gp61. The proteins were labeled for 12 h at 4 °C in the dark to ensure complete labeling of the cysteine residues by the cross-linker. Excess label was removed by applying the mixture to a 1-ml Sephadex G-25 spin column. Another form of gp41, gp41 containing a cysteine added to the C terminus as previously described (19Ishmael F.T. Alley S.C. Benkovic S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20555-20562Google Scholar) (gp41c), was also labeled in this manner. gp43 was labeled with the trifunctional, amine-reactive probe Sulfo-SBED (Pierce). The protein (500 μl of a 5 μmsolution) was dialyzed into 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol and mixed with 50 μl of a 1 mm solution of Sulfo-SBED (dissolved inN,N-dimethlyformamide). The reaction was allowed to proceed for 4 h and quenched by the addition of 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5 (final concentration). The protein was then dialyzed into 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol. gp41, gp61, or gp59 labeled with the trifunctional cross-linker (at a final concentration of 3 μm) was mixed with gp43 (final concentration of 0.5 μm) in the presence of the other two primosome proteins (3 μm each) and a forked DNA substrate (0.5 μm) in a final volume of 20 μl. gp43 labeled with Sulfo-SBED was cross-linked to primosome proteins following the same procedure. Two forked DNA substrates were used in these experiments. The first was composed of a 34-mer primer annealed to a 62-mer leading strand (with the sequence given above) and a partially complementary lagging strand of 73 nucleotides (with the sequence 5′-T38GGGTGGGAGGGAGTGGGATGATAGTACGTCTGTGT). The second DNA substrate contained a shorter lagging strand region (34/62/36-mer), where the length of the single-stranded lagging strand was 18 nucleotides (the sequence of the 36-mer was 5′-TGGGTGGGAGGGAGTGGGATGATAGTACGTCTGTGT). Cross-linking was initiated by exposure to an ultraviolet lamp for 7 min followed by the addition of 5 μl of SDS-PAGE buffer (20Alley S.C. Ishmael F.T. Jones A.D. Benkovic S.J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2000; 122: 6126-6127Google Scholar). In the lanes where reduction of the disulfide was desired, DTT at a final concentration of 100 mm was added. The proteins were immediately separated by SDS-PAGE, blotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Micron Separations), and probed with streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase (SA-HRP), as described previously (20Alley S.C. Ishmael F.T. Jones A.D. Benkovic S.J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2000; 122: 6126-6127Google Scholar). Accessible cysteine residues at gp32(Cys-166), gp59(Cys-42), gp41(Cys-316), and gp61(Cys-144) were labeled with 7-diethylamino-3-(4′-maleimidylphenyl)-4-methylcoumarin (CPM), Oregon Green 488 maleimide (OG), or tetramethylrhodamine 5′-maleimide (TMR) as required. Unlabeled proteins were dialyzed in labeling buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.3, 150 mm NaCl, and 10% glycerol) and labeled with a 5-fold excess of the appropriate fluorescent dye for 1–4 h at 4 °C. The labeled protein was then dialyzed in labeling buffer containing 10 mmβ-mercaptoethanol and frozen in aliquots at −70 °C. Alternatively, the N terminus of gp43 was specifically labeled in a lower pH buffer using Oregon Green 488 carboxylic acid, succinimidyl ester, 5-isomer (OGN). Unlabeled gp43 was dialyzed in labeling buffer at pH 6.8 and then labeled with a 3-fold excess of OGN for 4 h at 4 °C. gp43(OGN) was then dialyzed in labeling buffer at pH 7.5 and frozen in aliquots at −70 °C. All labeling processes were performed in less than 30 h to minimize any reduction in wild-type activity. The activity of the labeled proteins was confirmed using conventional activity assays. gp59(CPM) and gp41(OG) were analyzed using the ATPase assay (23Morrical S.W. Hempstead K. Morrical M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 33069-33081Google Scholar), and no significant difference was found in the rate of ATP hydrolysis from that of the wild-type gp59 and gp41 combination. The priming activity of gp61(TMR) was tested using the priming assay (22Valentine A.M. Ishmael F.T. Shier V.K. Benkovic S.J. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 15074-15085Google Scholar) or minicircle assay (10Salinas F. Benkovic S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7196-7201Google Scholar). Labeling of gp61 resulted in a 15% loss in priming activity and a 25% loss in synthesis of lagging strand products. gp43(OGN) was tested using with the ATPase assay (24Berdis A.J. Benkovic S.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9253-9265Google Scholar) and the strand displacement assay (25Alley S.C. Shier V.K. Abel-Santos E. Sexton D.J. Soumillion P. Benkovic S.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 7696-7709Google Scholar). The addition of gp43(OGN) in the ATPase assay shut down ATP hydrolysis to 75% that of unlabeled gp43, suggesting an interaction with gp45 causing the sequestering of the holoenzyme onto DNA. The strand displacement assay was conducted in a benchtop format to check the ability of gp43(OGN) to displace a 36-mer from the 34/62/36-mer DNA substrate (26Kaboord B.F. Benkovic S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10881-10885Google Scholar) and extend the 34-mer to a 62-mer. Extension of a 5′-32P]-labeled 34-mer oligonucleotide results in full-length 62-mer 32P-labeled products. The ratio of strand-displaced full-length products to unextended 34-mer was used to analyze the polymerization property of gp43(OGN). gp43(OGN) displayed 70% strand displacement activity to that of unlabeled gp43. Steady-state fluorescence experiments were performed on an ISA FluoroMax-2 spectrofluorometer at 25 °C. Primosome proteins were mixed to a final concentration of 1.2 μm each in the presence of 0.2 μm gp43 and 0.2 μm 32/64/73-mer DNA. CPM was excited at 390 nm, and FRET between the CPM and OG pair was observed by monitoring donor quenching and acceptor sensitization over the wavelength range from 430 to 530 nm. Slits were adjusted to between 1 and 3 nm to keep the spectrum on scale and were then fixed. Excitation of OG at 475 nm produced a FRET signal between the OG and TMR pair, and emission was monitored between 500 and 620 nm. The distance between the probes was determined from the energy transfer values from donor quenching (Equation 1) according to the Förster equation (27Selvin P.R. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 246: 300-334Google Scholar) (Equation2), ET=1−IADIDEquation 1 R=Ro61Eτ−1Equation 2 where E T is the transfer efficiency of the FRET process and I AD and I D are the fluorescent intensities of the donor in the presence and absence, respectively, of the acceptor. R O is the Förster distance at which the transfer efficiency is 50%, andR is the distance between the donor and acceptor.R O was calculated as described previously (25Alley S.C. Shier V.K. Abel-Santos E. Sexton D.J. Soumillion P. Benkovic S.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 7696-7709Google Scholar) using Equation 3 (28van der Meer B.W. Coker G. Chen S.-Y.S. Resonance Energy Transfer Theory and Data. VCH Publisher, New York1994Google Scholar) and determined to be 48 Å for the gp59(CPM) and gp43(OGN) pair,Ro=2.11(φDκ2η−4J)1/6Equation 3 where φD is the quantum yield of the donor,κ 2 is the orientation factor (2/3), η is the refractive index of the medium (1.4), and J is the overlap integral between the fluorescence spectrum of the donor and the absorption spectrum of the acceptor. Stopped flow fluorescence experiments were performed on an Applied Photophysics SX.18MV stopped flow reaction analyzer using fluorescence mode at a temperature of 25 °C. Excitation of CPM was performed at 390 nm. Emission of OG was measured using a 515-nm band pass filter. The changes in fluorescence were observed upon stopped flow mixing of syringe A (gp59(CPM), gp41, gp61 (each at a final concentration of 1.2 μm), gp32 (1.4 μm), DNA (32/64/73-mer, 0.2 μm)) and syringe B (gp43(OGN) (0.2 μm)). Syringe A was initially mixed versus reaction buffer to obtain a background fluorescence value. Syringe B was then replaced with gp43(OGN) and mixed versus syringe A to obtain the experimental values. A minimum of five experimental traces were recorded and averaged on two separate occasions. The fluorescence data were fit to a double exponential using the supplied software from the manufacturer. Simulation of the stopped flow FRET traces were performed using KinTekSim version 2.3 (29Barshop B.A. Wrenn R.F. Frieden C. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 130: 134-145Google Scholar) using the mechanism shown in Fig. 6 B to fit the individual rate constants for each step. The observed rate constants from the stopped flow FRET traces were optimized and varied to determine the importance of the values of the individual rates to the fit of the simulation. Using a two-hybrid approach, Salinas and Benkovic (10Salinas F. Benkovic S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7196-7201Google Scholar) identified a region of gp43 that was critical for dimerization. This region was composed of amino acids 400–601 and corresponds to an extension of the finger domain in the three-dimensional structure of the protein. This region contains two cysteine residues (Cys-507 and Cys-542) that may be close to the interface of interaction of the polymerases. As such, BMH, a thiol-thiol cross-linker, was employed to analyze this potential locus of interaction between the two proteins. gp43 was mixed with BMH in the presence or absence of a partially double-stranded piece of DNA (34/62-mer), and the products were separated by SDS-PAGE and subjected to a Western blot using an anti-gp43 antibody. No higher molecular weight species than gp43 were observed in the absence of DNA. However, when DNA was present, gp43 was cross-linked to a dimer (Fig. 1 A, lane 3), indicating that conformational changes induced by DNA binding allowed dimerization of the gp43 monomers through the associations of two gp43·DNA complexes. To ensure that the results of this experiment were physiologically relevant, a rolling circle experiment was conducted as described previously (10Salinas F. Benkovic S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7196-7201Google Scholar). All of the replisome proteins were assembled in the presence of a minicircle DNA, dNTPs, and rNTPs as described under “Experimental Procedures.” After DNA replication had been initiated, BMH was added to the mixture. The reaction was quenched, and the products were separated by SDS-PAGE and subjected to Western blot using an anti-gp43 antibody. Under conditions where active replication was occurring, a cross-link band corresponding to a gp43 dimer was observed (Fig. 1 B, lane 2). The site of cross-linking between the gp43 subunits was then mapped. gp43 was cross-linked with the thiol-thiol cross-linker AMCA-TMEA as described under “Experimental Procedures” (Fig. 2 A). Cross-linked dimeric gp43 was separated from uncross-linked gp43 by size exclusion chromatography, and the protein was digested with trypsin. The cross-linked fragment was isolated by reverse phase HPLC by monitoring the absorbance of the fluorophore, and the identity of the cross-linked fragment was elucidated by MALDI mass spectrometry as described previously (19Ishmael F.T. Alley S.C. Benkovic S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20555-20562Google Scholar) (Fig. 2 B). A mass of 3450.86 was observed, consistent with the expected mass of 3446.78 for a tryptic fragment containing Cys-507 cross-linked to a second tryptic fragment containing Cys-507. Because other possible cysteine-cysteine crosslinks have masses within this m/z envelope, additional fragments are being examined (Fig. 2 B). Our general methodology for photocross-linking involves specifically labeling a protein of interest with a cross-linker at a unique site (typically a cysteine residue), followed by the addition of the interacting protein for cross-linking. The primosome proteins, gp41, gp59, and gp61, were specifically labeled with the trifunctional cross-linker shown in Fig. 3 A at Cys-316, Cys-42, and Cys-144. The trifunctional cross-linker contains a biotin affinity handle, a photoactivable arylazide, and a cleavable disulfide bond. The structure of the cross-linker is such that after the labeled protein is cross-linked to an interacting protein, cleavage of the disulfide bond results in transfer of the biotin group to the interacting protein. In these experiments, gp43 was mixed with all of the primosome proteins (gp41, gp59, and gp61) in the presence of a forked DNA substrate (either the 34/62/73-mer or 34/62/36-mer), where one of the primosome proteins was labeled with the trifunctional cross-linker. The samples were exposed to ultraviolet light to initiate cross-linking, separated by SDS-PAGE in the presence or absence of DTT, and then subjected to a Western blot using SA-HRP as a probe. When labeled gp59 was mixed with gp43 and exposed to UV light, a higher molecular weight band was seen on the Western blot, consistent with a cross-link between gp43 and gp59 (Fig. 4 A, lane 2). The addition of DTT results in cleavage of the disulfide bond in the cross-linker and the resultant transfer of the biotin label to gp43 (Fig. 4 A, lane 4), thus verifying the interaction between gp59 and gp43. There was no difference in cross-linking between assembly of the complex on the 34/62/73 forkversus the 34/62/36 fork (data not shown). In contrast, cross-links between gp41 and gp43 or between gp61 and gp43 were not observed consistently, and when they were observed, only trace amounts of cross-linking could be seen (data not shown). gp41c (gp41 with a cysteine added to the C terminus) was also labeled and subjected to cross-linking with gp43 but did not show any interaction. Since the labels attached to gp41 and gp61 may not have been in close proximity to gp43, gp43 was labeled with the trifunctional cross-linker Sulfo-SBED and mixed with the primosome proteins. Sulfo-SBED is similar to the trifunctional cross-linker used above, with the exception that it is amine-reactive instead of thiol-reactive. Due to the large number of lysine residues on gp43, numerous labels can be placed throughout the protein, maximizing the probability of capturing an interacting protein. In the presence of the primosome proteins and fork DNA, no cross-linking was observed between gp43 and gp41 or gp61. However, cross-linking between gp43 and gp59 was again observed, since the biotin label was transferred from gp43 to gp59 upon reduction of the cross-linker (Fig. 4 B, lane 4). The interaction between gp59 and gp43 was investigated further on an active rolling minicircle. The replisome was assembled on DNA in the presence of the minicircle using gp59 labeled with the thiol-reactive trifunctional cross-linker. After the initiation of replication, cross-linking was induced by exposure to UV light. The products of the reaction were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blot as described above. Cross-link bands are observed, and when DTT is added, the biotin label is transferred to proteins corresponding to the molecular weights of gp61 and gp43, indicating that interactions between gp59, the primase, and the polymerase occur during active replication (Fig. 4"

HERG channels slowly activate on depolarization and demonstrate fast inactivation at positive potentials, resulting in small outward currents at potentials positive to 0 mV; hence, inward rectification (9Smith P.L.

Physiol. 1996; 107: 611-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). On repolarization close to resting potentials, large outward tail currents occur that slowly deactivate. These features of HERG channel dictate its role in repolarization of the cardiac action potential and frequency-dependent modulation of the action potential duration (11Lu Y. Mahaut-Smith M.P.

In these cells HERG conductance has been directly demonstrated in single cells, and in esophageal and stomach smooth muscle the presence of a “window” current within the range of the resting potential and depolarization and contraction by HERG channel blockers of whole tissue segments strongly suggest a role for ether-a-go-go-related gene K+ conductance in maintaining resting membrane potential (12Akbarali H.I. Thatte H., He, X.D. Giles W.R. Goyal R.K. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: C1284-C1290Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, transcripts forerg1 and immunohistochemical labeling have been shown in gastrointestinal smooth muscle cells (13Ohya S. Asakura K. Muraki K. Watanabe M. Imaizumi Y. Am. J. Physiol. Gastrointest. Liver Physiol. 2002; 282: 277-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). However, it is not clear how the kinetics of the cardiac isoform of the HERG channels can maintain the resting membrane potential or repolarization of spike-like action potentials of gastrointestinal smooth muscle cells. For instance, 1) the threshold for activation of the heterologously expressed cardiac isoform of the HERG current and its native form, IKr, is positive to − 50 mV (5Sanguinetti M.C. Jiang C. Curran M.E. Keating M.T. Cell. 1995; 81: 299-307Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2132) Google Scholar, 19Sanguinetti M.C. Jurkiewicz N.K. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 260: H393-H399PubMed Google Scholar), whereas the resting potential of gastrointestinal smooth muscle generally lies around −60 mV, 2) unlike the native cardiac myocytes, where large tail currents occur upon repolarization (20Sanguinetti M.C. Jurkiewicz N.K. J. Gen. Physiol. 1990; 96: 195-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (1340) Google Scholar, 21Shibasaki T. J. Physiol. 1987; 387: 227-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar), smooth muscle cells do not demonstrate large tail currents upon repolarization, and 3) it is not clear how recovery from inactivation of the cardiac HERG can generate sufficient outward current during repolarization of shorter duration of action potential trains that occur from a plateau potential of −30 mV in gastrointestinal smooth muscle.In this report, we describe the cloning and characterization of the smooth muscle isoform of erg channels, which we have denoted as erg1-sm, from rabbit and human colon. These studies demonstrate that erg1-sm is a truncated isoform that lacks 101 amino acids in the C-terminal region. We also show that there is a unique substitution of a conserved amino acid in the S4 voltage sensor region between the cardiac and smooth muscle isoforms that confers significant hyperpolarizing shift in the voltage dependence of activation for erg1-sm and results in steady-state conductance within the potential range for maintaining the resting membrane potential and demonstrates kinetics that are consistent with this isoform being able to generate repolarizing current during smooth muscle action potentials.RESULTSTo determine the physiological properties of the smooth muscle isoform of erg, we cloned and characterized the full-length cDNA from circular smooth muscle of the rabbit colon using RT-PCR. Fig. 1 A shows the presence of the full-length transcript for erg1 (∼3.5 kilobases) from the rabbit colon, human colon, and mouse heart. A similar size band was also identified in mouse small intestine (data not shown). In addition to the presence of erg1, the alternatively spliced isoform,ergB, was also detected in the human colon (Fig. 1 B). To further confirm that erg1 transcript is present in smooth muscle cells, about 40–80 cells were selected by laser capture microdissection. Multicell PCR of captured cells showed the presence of erg1 without contamination from either neurons or interstitial cells of Cajal (Fig. 1 C). Although no bands were seen for neuronal or interstitial cells of Cajal in selected smooth muscle or in circular muscle strips, the fidelity of these primers was confirmed using whole colon tissue (data not shown).The full-length transcripts for erg1 from the rabbit and human colon were sequenced using overlapping primers. In an initial analysis, these sequences were aligned against the HERG (NM_000238) and found to be ∼87% identical at the nucleotide level and ∼95% at the protein level (deposited in GenBankTM, rabbit colon accession number AF439342; human colon accession number AY130462). Within the transmembrane spanning region (S1 to S6), the sequences were identical except for the presence of a conserved amino acid substitution, alanine for valine at position 537, in the S4 region of the smooth muscle isoforms from human and rabbit erg (Fig. 2). This position corresponds to 535 for HERG due to two additional amino acids in the N terminus of the smooth muscle isoforms. The single amino acid substitution within the S4 region was also identified in the rabbit stomach smooth muscle and, as shown below, confers important kinetic properties that define its role in maintaining smooth muscle-resting potential and repolarization of the action potential. We have denoted the smooth muscle isoforms as erg1-sm.Figure 2Deduced amino acid sequence and alignment of HERG (GenBankTM NM_000238), human colon (Hu-colon), and rabbit colon (R-colon). Differences in amino acids areshadowed. The putative transmembrane segments, S1-S6, and cyclic nucleotide binding domain (CNB) are presented inbold. The difference in the S4 segment between HERG and smooth muscle isoforms is boxed andunderlined.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)The open reading frame of the smooth muscle isoforms (erg1-sm) consisted of 1058 amino acids as compared with 1159 amino acids for HERG, resulting in a truncated C terminus of 101 amino acids. This truncation was due to a frameshift resulting from a single-base deletion of G, corresponding to the position 3159 in HERG producing a premature stop codon in the 14 exon (Fig. 3) (25Itoh T.

Timothy K.W. Vincent G.M. Lehmann M.H. Keating M.T. Genomics. 1998; 51: 86-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar) in both human and rabbit colon. However, a similar deletion was not observed in cDNA from the rabbit atrial tissue, which was sequenced by RT-PCR using the same primers as for the smooth muscle.Figure 3Genomic organization of HERG and the truncation of smooth muscle isoforms in the 14th exon. A, schematic depiction of the 15 exons of HERG with the transmembrane segments presented in filled boxes. The termination site for HERG lies within the 15th exon (25Itoh T. Tanaka T. Nagai R.

Hu-, human ; R-, rabbit.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)To confirm that the smooth muscle isoform results in a truncated protein, the plasmid DNA for erg1-sm and HERG were translated in vitro and probed with streptavidin-HRP for detection of the proteins. As shown in Fig. 4 A, the protein bands for HERG were obtained around the expected size of 127 kDa. The erg1-sm band was about 10 kDa smaller in size as would be expected for a 101-amino acid truncated protein. However, a faint band around 127 kDa was also observed in both erg1-sm as well as in control (luciferase DNA) lanes, indicating an additional nonspecific protein band may be present around this molecular weight. The presence of HERG protein was, therefore, further examined by immunoblots carried out using anti-HERG antibody that was raised against the C terminus. Fig. 4 B shows that this antibody recognized the presence of HERG but did not show bands from erg1-sm or control proteins. The anti-N-terminal HERG antibody was raised against residues 174–188 of HERG, which is almost identical to that in erg1-sm. Fig. 4 Cshows that immunoblot with anti-N-terminal antibody revealed a band of 127 kDa for HERG and a slightly lower band for erg1-sm (∼120 kDa), consistent with the hypothesis that erg1-sm is a truncated isoform of HERG. To determine the expression of erg1-sm in native colonic tissues, immunoblots of isolated membrane proteins were carried out using the anti-C-terminal and anti-N-terminal HERG antibodies. Fig. 4,D and E, show that the major band revealed by anti-C-terminal antibody was around 95 kDa, which is expected forerg1b isoform. Larger molecular weight bands corresponding to glycosylated forms of erg1 (27Pond A.L. Nerbonne J.M. Trends Cardiovas. Med. 2001; 11: 286-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) were not detected in colonic smooth muscle. The anti-N terminus antibody revealed a band ∼120 kDa that most likely represents erg1-sm. Taken together these data suggest that erg1-sm is truncated and that previous findings of immunohistochemical localization of erg1 in single smooth muscle cells using the anti-C terminus antibody (12Akbarali H.I.

Preliminary studies suggested that expression of erg1-sm currents were significantly lower than that for HERG and required at least 3–4 days for full development of currents when approximately equal amounts of RNA were injected. To obtain currents of comparable amplitude, the volume of RNA injection was doubled for erg1-sm.Upon depolarization from a holding potential of −70 mV, erg1-sm K+ channels activated at potentials positive to − 60 mV. As shown in Fig. 5, the magnitude of this current increased up to −20 mV, and thereafter, larger depolarizations resulted in a progressive decrease in the amplitude, as expected for the inwardly rectifying properties of ergchannels. At potentials positive to − 20 mV, transient currents were elicited whose rate of activation and the amplitude increased with increasing step depolarization (inset, Fig. 5 A). Upon repolarization to the holding potential of −70 mV, tail currents with fast deactivation kinetics were obtained. The currents from erg1-sm were abolished by the class III anti-arrhythmic blocker, E-4031 (10 μm) (Fig. 5 B). In comparison, the currents from HERG-injected oocytes demonstrated much slower activation at negative potentials, with peak currents obtained at 0 mV. Unlike erg1-sm, currents from HERG showed no fast transient components at positive potentials (inset, Fig. 5 A, bottom panel). Upon repolarization to −70 mV, tail currents from HERG had much larger amplitudes and deactivated slowly compared with erg1-sm. The current-voltage relationship measured at the end of the test pulse showed a bell-shaped response with erg1-sm demonstrating a leftward shift of 20 mV compared with HERG (Fig. 5 C).Figure 5Biophysical properties of smooth muscle isoform of erg channels. A, raw traces of outward current obtained from erg1-sm (upper panel)- and HERG (lower panel)-injected oocytes evoked by depolarizing pulses (from −70 mV to +50 mV) followed by repolarization to −70 mV.Insets are expanded traces showing the presence of transient peak at positive potentials (0 mV to +50 mV) for erg1-sm current and absent in HERG.

Current amplitudes at the end of the pulse were normalized to maximal current and plotted against the test potential.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)The voltage dependence of activation was measured as the relative amplitude of tail currents and plotted as a function of test potential. This isochronal activation curve had a V 1/2 of −36 ± 0.7 mV with a slope factor 10 for erg1-sm and a more positive V 1/2 potential of −16 ± 0.4 mV (slope factor 9.5) for HERG (Fig. 6 A). The voltage dependence of the steady state inactivation (the rectification factor) was measured using protocols as described under “Materials and Methods.” TheV 1/2 for erg1-sm was −26 ± 2.5 mV with a slope factor of 17 mV, whereas that for HERG was −48 ± 1 mV with a slope factor of 24 (Fig. 6 B). The rightward shift meant that erg1-sm channels had less steady-state inactivation, particularly around the resting membrane potential of smooth muscle (between −70 mV and −50 mV). To determine the voltage dependence of the steady-state conductance, the fraction of channels activated at each potential was multiplied by the fraction of channels inactivated at that potential. The resulting window current showed a significant amount of steady-state current for erg1-sm channels between −60 and −50 mV (Fig. 6 C). Within this potential range, steady-state current was almost 10-fold greater for erg1-sm than HERG, consistent with the findings in native smooth muscle cells of erg-like currents maintaining the resting membrane potential (12Akbarali H.I.

A, voltage dependence of activation was measured by normalizing the peak amplitude of tail currents relative to the largest current obtained upon repolarization to −70 mV from test potentials of −70 to +50 mV. Data were fit by the Boltzmann relationship. The V 1/2for erg1-sm was −36 ± 0.7 mV (slope factor 10) (n = 8) and −16 ± 0.4 mV (slope factor 9.5) for HERG (n = 9). B, the voltage dependence of rapid inactivation (rectification factor) was measured as described under “Materials and Methods.” The data were fit by the Boltzmann equation. erg1-sm currents had V 1/2 values of −26 ± 2.5 mV with a more steep slope factor (17 mV) compared with a V 1/2 of −48 ± 1 mV and a slope factor of 24 for HERG (n = 7). Note that the values obtained for HERG are similar to those described previously (5Sanguinetti M.C. Jiang C. Curran M.E. Keating M.T. Cell. 1995; 81: 299-307Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2132) Google Scholar).C, calculated steady-state conductance of erg1-sm and HERG. The steady-state conductance was measured by multiplying the fraction of channels activated by inactivated channels at each potential. The steady-state conductance was significantly larger for erg1-sm, between −60 mV and −50 mV, near the resting membrane potential of smooth muscle.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Both activation and inactivation rates were much faster for erg1-sm than HERG (Fig. 7). Activation was fit by a double-exponential, and at almost all voltages (between −50 mV and −20 mV) time constants for activation for erg1-sm were almost 3 times smaller than for HERG currents (Fig. 7 B). The time constant for inactivation was measured using a three-pulse protocol. The oocytes were depolarized to +40 mV for 5 s followed by a short pulse for 15 ms to −140 mV to remove inactivation, and re-inactivation was induced at various test potentials from −60 mV to +40 mV. The resulting currents were fit by a single exponential and demonstrated voltage dependence. As shown in Fig. 7 C, the time constant for inactivation of erg1-sm was significantly smaller than that for HERG at all potentials. The rate of activation was measured by “envelope” of tail currents as shown in the voltage protocol of Fig. 7 D. The rate of activation was also faster for erg1-sm than HERG.Figure 7Rate of activation and inactivation of sm-erg channels. A, superimposed traces of erg1-sm and HERG activation obtained at −20-mV step depolarization. Fits to the traces are displayed as dots and superimposed on raw data.B, fast (right panel) and slow time constants (left panel) of activation for erg1-sm and HERG currents. Time constants were obtained by fitting by two exponentials to current traces at each potential (n = 7).C, time constant of inactivation. Time constants were obtained by single exponential fit to currents obtained during the test potential from −60 mV to +40 mV using the three-pulse protocol illustrated in the inset (n = 8). Rate of inactivation in erg1-sm was significantly faster at each potential.D, the rate of activation for erg1-sm and HERG, measured using an envelope of tail currents. Oocytes were depolarized to +40 mV for variable duration ranging from 25 to 250 ms to introduce complete activation and inactivation followed by repolarization step to −140 mV (as shown in the inset). Peak amplitudes of tail currents at −140 mV were measured, normalized, and plotted against pulse duration (n = 10).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Upon repolarization to −70 mV, tail currents of much smaller amplitude were recorded consistently in erg1-sm-injected oocytes compared with HERG. HERG channels transition into an open state on repolarization before slowly closing, leading to large amplitude of tail currents. Although similar transition was evident in erg1-sm at potentials positive to − 20 mV where inactivation occurs, the amplitude of the tail currents was similar to that of the amplitude of the transient outward current at that potential. The significantly smaller amplitudes of the tail currents are also consistent with findings from native cells, where tail currents due to K+ channel activation are quite small and do not show the typical hook observed for ventricular myocytes (19Sanguinetti M.C. Jurkiewicz N.K. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 260: H393-H399PubMed Google Scholar). The most likely explanation for the smaller amplitude of tail currents is the faster rate of deactivation in erg1-sm. Fig. 8 A shows tail currents obtained upon repolarization to −60 mV from a test potential of +30 mV. Deactivation was significantly faster for erg1-sm than HERG between −80 mV and −40 mV (Fig. 8 B).Figure 8Deactivation kinetics of erg1-sm.

Contractions of gastrointestinal smooth muscle are elicited by multiple action potentials that are superimposed on an underlying rhythmic slow wave activity (28Sanders K.M. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1992; 54: 439-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The upstroke of the action potentials is mediated by activation of L-type Ca2+ channels that occur during the plateau phase of the slow wave. The duration of the action potentials can also vary during the train. Activation of outward currents from erg1-sm and HERG-injected oocytes were examined using ramp depolarizations that varied in the inter-spike interval. Ramp depolarization was applied from −70 mV to −30 mV (100 ms) to mimic the upstroke of the slow wave that was then followed by the first spike by ramping from −30 mV to +20 mV in 100 ms and repolarizing back to −40 mV (50 ms). The voltage was then slowly ramped back to −30 mV in 150 ms to mimic the inter-spike interval, which was followed by a second spike as shown in the upper traces of Fig. 9(left-hand panel). The pattern of currents obtained from erg1-sm and HERG-injected oocytes with this protocol is illustrated in Fig. 9 (left-hand panel). In both, depolarization from −70 mV to −30 mV produced little outward currents; however, in the erg1-sm-injected oocytes (middle panel) a transient outward current was evoked during the first spike that partly inactivated at the peak of depolarization. Upon repolarization to −40 mV, currents slowly activated and maintained a plateau during the inter-spike interval; thereafter, further depolarization to +20 mV (the second spike) resulted in relaxation of the outward currents as the channels reverted to an inactivated state. Repolarization of the second spike and return to the holding potential resulted in significant outward currents similar to"

Biol. 1998; 8: 572-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The well characterized Dol-P-Man synthases fall into two distinct groups. One group contains the Schizosaccharomyces pombe, Caenorhabditis briggsiae, and mammalian Dol-P-Man synthases. The other group includes theSaccharomyces cerevisiae, Ustilago maydis, andTrypanosoma brucei Dol-P-Man synthases. Enzymes of the mammalian class lack the C-terminal hydrophobic domain that is characteristic of the S. cerevisiae class of Dol-P-Man synthases (7Colussi P.A. Taron C.H. Mack J.C. Orlean P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7873-7878Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The C-terminal hydrophobic domain has been proposed to stabilize the yeast enzyme by anchoring it in the cytoplasmic membrane. More recently, the mammalian Dol-P-Man synthase Dpm1 has been shown to interact with the transmembrane protein Dpm3 that retains and stabilizes the synthase in the endoplasmic reticulum membrane (8Maeda Y. Tomita S. Watanabe R. Ohishi K. Kinoshita T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4920-4929Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 9Maeda Y. Tanaka S. Hino J. Kangawa K. Kinoshita T. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2475-2482Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), thereby functionally replacing the missing C-terminal hydrophobic domain. In mycobacteria, polyprenol phosphate mannose (Polyprenol-P-Man), closely related to Dol-P-Man, is involved in lipoarabinomannan biosynthesis (10Schultz J. Elbein A.D. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1974; 160: 311-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 11Besra G.S. Morehouse C.B. Rittner C.M. Waechter C.J. Brennan P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18460-18466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), a key immunomodulator implicated in tuberculosis pathogenesis (12Chatterjee D. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 1997; 1: 579-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Based on its homology with the human Dol-P-Man synthase Dpm1, we recently identified and characterized a Polyprenol-P-Man synthase (MtPpm1) from Mycobacterium tuberculosis(13Gurcha S.S. Baulard A.R. Kremer L. Locht C. Moody D.B. Muhlecker W. Costello C.E. Crick D.C. Brennan P.J. Besra G.S. Biochem. J. 2002; 365: 441-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Unexpectedly, MtPpm1 is composed of two domains. The Dol-P-Man homologous domain is located in the C-terminal part of the protein, whereas the N-terminal domain possesses a low degree of similarity with a variety of bacterial acyltransferases. Interestingly, when genetically disconnected from the N-terminal domain, the catalytic C-terminal domain of MtPpm1 was still able to catalyze Polyprenol-P-Man synthesis in mycobacteria. However, further experiments also demonstrated that the addition of the disconnected N-terminal domain somehow increased the transferase activity of the C-terminal domain without displaying catalytic activity by itself (13Gurcha S.S. Baulard A.R. Kremer L. Locht C. Moody D.B. Muhlecker W. Costello C.E. Crick D.C. Brennan P.J. Besra G.S. Biochem. J. 2002; 365: 441-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, in related mycobacterial species, such asMycobacterium leprae, Mycobacterium avium, andMycobacterium smegmatis, orthologs of the two domains are encoded by two distinct open reading frames organized as an operon. This observation suggests that MtPpm1 has resulted from the fusion of two ancestral neighboring open reading frames, still separated in some related mycobacterial species. According to the “Rosetta stone theory” (14Pellegrini M. Marcotte E.M. Thompson M.J. Eisenberg D. Yeates T.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4285-4288Crossref PubMed Scopus (1439) Google Scholar, 15Marcotte E.M. Pellegrini M., Ng, H.L. Rice D.W. Yeates T.O. Eisenberg D. Science. 1999; 285: 751-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (1334) Google Scholar), the presence in the M. smegmatis genome of adjacent genes encoding MsPpm1 andMsPpm2 that are both homologs of MtPpm1 encoded by a single gene in M. tuberculosis suggests thatMsPpm1 and MsPpm2 interact with each other to exert a function similar to that of MtPpm1. In this report, we show that MsPpm2 is an integral membrane protein and, using a bacterial two-hybrid system (16Karimova G. Pidoux J. Ullmann A. Ladant D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5752-5756Crossref PubMed Scopus (1141) Google Scholar), we demonstrate that the synthase MsPpm1 binds to MsPpm2 in vivo. As observed with mammalian Dol-P-Man synthases,MsPpm1 also lacks the characteristic hydrophobic C terminus. Thus, the MsPpm1-MsPpm2 interaction is reminiscent of that of the mammalian Dpm1 with Dpm3 (8Maeda Y. Tomita S. Watanabe R. Ohishi K. Kinoshita T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4920-4929Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 9Maeda Y. Tanaka S. Hino J. Kangawa K. Kinoshita T. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2475-2482Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). In contrast, MsPpm1 is functionally active when expressed inEscherichia coli, similarly to the S. cerevisiaegroup of Dol-P-Man synthases (7Colussi P.A. Taron C.H. Mack J.C. Orlean P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7873-7878Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 17Kruszewska J.S. Saloheimo M. Migdalski A. Orlean P. Penttila M. Palamarczyk G. Glycobiology. 2000; 10: 983-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). As a consequence,MsPpm1 may constitute a new intermediate group of Polyprenol-P-Man synthases. The transmembrane segments (TMS) ofMtPpm1 and MsPpm2 were predicted using the following seven methods available on the World Wide Web: TMHMM (www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/TMHMM-2.0/), HMMTOP (www.enzim.hu/hmmtop/index.html), DAS (www.sbc.su.se/∼miklos/DAS/), TMPRED (www.ch.embnet.org/software/TMPRED_form.html), MEMSAT2 (bioinf.cs.ucl.ac.uk/psiform.html), TOPPRED (www.sbc.su.se/∼erikw/toppred2/), and PHDHTM (www.embl-heidelberg.de/predictprotein/submit_adv.html#top). All cloning steps were performed in E. coli XL1-Blue (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). M. smegmatis mc2155 was a generous gift from W. R. Jacobs, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY (18Snapper S.B. Melton R.E. Mustafa S. Kieser T. Jacobs W.R., Jr. Mol. Microbiol. 1990; 4: 1911-1919Crossref PubMed Scopus (992) Google Scholar) and was transformed as described previously (19Lugosi L. Jacobs W.J. Bloom B.R. Tubercle. 1989; 70: 159-170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Recombinant clones were selected on Middlebrook 7H10 agar supplemented with oleic acid-albumin-dextrose-catalase enrichment (Difco, Detroit, MI) containing 25 μg/ml kanamycin (Sigma). Liquid cultures of recombinantM. smegmatis were grown at 37 °C in Luria-Bertani (LB) broth (Difco) supplemented with 25 μg/ml kanamycin and 0.05% Tween 80. Liquid cultures of E. coli (pUC8) and E. coli(pUC8-MtPpm1/D2) were grown in LB broth at 37 °C with 100 μg/ml ampicillin to an optical density (OD) at 600 nm of 0.4 and induced for 4 h with 1 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranose. Large scale cultures of bacteria were grown as described above, harvested by centrifugation, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and stored at −20 °C until further use. E. coli DHP1 is an adenylate cyclase deficient (cya) derivative of DH1 (F−, glnV44(AS), recA1, endA1, gyrA96 (Nalr), thi1, hsdR17, spoT1, rfbD1) (16Karimova G. Pidoux J. Ullmann A. Ladant D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5752-5756Crossref PubMed Scopus (1141) Google Scholar). Protein-protein interactions leading to the cytoplasmic production and assembly of a functional adenylate cyclase in E. coli DHP1 were detected by the ability to ferment maltose. Thus, clones were checked for their ability to form red colonies at 30 °C on freshly prepared MacConkey agar plates containing 1% maltose and supplemented with 25 μg/ml kanamycin, 25 μg/ml chloramphenicol, and 100 μg/ml ampicillin when appropriate. To fuse phoA to codons 465 or 600 of MtPpm1, phoA was first amplified by PCR from E. coli XL1-Blue using primers N°226 (5′-GCCATTAAGTCTGGATCCTAACAG-3′) and N°228 (5′-CGGACACCAGAGGCGCCTGTTCT-3′) and the TaqDNA polymerase (Qiagen, Courtaboeuf, France). The 1421-bp PCR fragment was inserted into the commercially linearized pCR2.1Topo (Invitrogen) to create pCR2.1-PhoA (alkaline phosphatase). pMV261-MtPpm1 (13Gurcha S.S. Baulard A.R. Kremer L. Locht C. Moody D.B. Muhlecker W. Costello C.E. Crick D.C. Brennan P.J. Besra G.S. Biochem. J. 2002; 365: 441-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) was cut by Asp718 and blunted using the Klenow polymerase. The resulting 1802-bp fragment was inserted into pCR2.1-PhoA cleaved with EcoRV. The resulting construct was then digested with Asp718 and BglII, and the fragment was gel-purified and inserted into pMV261 (20Stover C.K. de la Cruz V.F. Fuerst T.R. Burlein J.E. Benson L.A. Bennet L.T. Bansal G.P. Young J.F. Lee M.H. Hatfull G.F. Snapper S.B. Barletta R.G. Jacobs Jr W.R. Bloom B.R. Nature. 1991; 351: 456-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (1182) Google Scholar) cleaved with the same enzymes to create pMV261-MtPpm1/PhoA465. To produce pMV261-MtPpm1/PhoA600, both pMV261-MtPpm1 and pCR2.1-PhoA were cut with BamHI and KasI. The 6716-bp fragment from pMV261-MtPpm1 and the 1392-bp fragment carrying phoA were gel-purified and ligated to produce pMV261-MtPpm1/PhoA600. The region coding for MtPpm1/D1 (corresponding to Met1 to Trp593) was amplified by PCR using primers N°148 (5′-GGACTGCAGCGCAGCTACCCACCA-3′) and N°151 (5′-TTGGATCCGGTGGTCATGTAACTCCTC-3′). The amplified 1780-bp fragment was cleaved by PstI and BamHI and inserted into PstI-BamHI-restricted pT25 (16Karimova G. Pidoux J. Ullmann A. Ladant D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5752-5756Crossref PubMed Scopus (1141) Google Scholar) to yield pT25-MtPpm1/D1. The DNA region corresponding to MtPpm1/D2 (Met594 to Glu874) was amplified by PCR using primers N°153 (5′-AGCGGTACCGAGGAGTTACATGACCAC-3′) and N°154 (5′-GAGCGCCTCGAGCATTCGGTCAC-3′). The 876-bp PCR product was cleaved byXhoI and KpnI and inserted into pT18 (16Karimova G. Pidoux J. Ullmann A. Ladant D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5752-5756Crossref PubMed Scopus (1141) Google Scholar) digested previously with the same enzymes. The resulting plasmid was termed pT18-MtPpm1/D2. A similar strategy was used for Msppm1 andMsppm2. Primers N°200 (5′-AAGGTACCGAGCGTCCCAGGTGAACGTGA-3′) and N°201 (5′-CAAAGCTTACCACGCCCCTGGCCCGGTCGA-3′) were used to amplifyMsppm1 from M. smegmatis chromosomal DNA. The 805-bp PCR product was cleaved by KpnI andHinDIII and inserted into pT18 digested previously with the same enzymes. The resulting plasmid was termed pT18-MsPpm1. Primers N°198 (5′-CCCTGCAGTCACCGATGACGACCCCCTC-3′) and N° 199 (5′-GGGTCGGGCGGACGGTGGCAGGA-3′) were used to amplify a 1853-bp fragment of Msppm1. Subsequently, the DNA fragment was cut withPstI and BamHI and then inserted into pT25 cut with the same enzymes to yield pT25-MsPpm2. All inserts were verified by DNA sequencing. TnTap is a Tn5-based mini-transposon carrying the signal sequencelessphoA reporter gene, lacking a promoter and translation initiation signals (21Ehrmann M. Bolek P. Mondigler M. Boyd D. Lange R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13111-13115Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). To construct a transposable element suitable for in vitro transposition, the phoA-neo cassette was amplified by PCR using tap-xba (5′-GCTCTAGATTTGCGGCCGCGTCGACCTGCA-3′) and tap-sac (5′-TCCGAGCTCTTTGAAAACCTGTACTTCCAG-3′) as primers and TnTap as the template. The PCR product was digested withXbaI-SacI and inserted into pMOD<MCS> (Epicentre, Madison, WI) to yield pMODTap. The transposable element carrying the phoA-neo cassette flanked by hyperactive 19-bp mosaic end (ME) was amplified by PCR using pMODTap as template and pmod-fp (5′-CGGAATTCATTCAGGCTGCGCAACTGT-3′) and pmod-rp (5′-CGGGATCCGTCAGTGAGCGAGGAAGCGGAAG-3′) as primers. The random in vitro transposition of the ME-phoA-neo-ME transposable element into pT25-MsPpm2 was performed by using the EZ::TN transposase according to the manufacturer's instructions (Epicentre, Madison, WI). The transposition reaction product was introduced into E. coli CC118 (araD139 Δ(ara, leu)7697 ΔlacX74 ΔphoAΔ20 galE galK thi rpsE rpoB argE am recA1) by electroporation. Blue AmpR and KanR colonies were selected on agar plates containing corresponding antibiotics and 40 μg/ml of X-Phosphate (Sigma). Alkaline phosphatase activity was assayed in M. smegmatis and in E. coli by measuring the rate of p-nitrophenyl-phosphate (Sigma) hydrolysis in intact cells as described previously (22Kremer L. Baulard A. Estaquier J. Content J. Capron A. Locht C. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 642-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 23Manoil C. Beckwith J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 8129-8133Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar). Enzymatic reactions were performed in triplicate in the dark at 37 °C. Reactions were stopped with 100 μl of 1 mKH2PO4, 0.1 m EDTA (pH 8.0), and the OD at the appropriate wavelength was measured. The activity is expressed in arbitrary units. Units of activity for M. smegmatis = A 420 nm × mg of protein−1 × min−1 (23Manoil C. Beckwith J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 8129-8133Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar), units of activity for E. coli = (A 420 nm − (1.75 × A 550 nm)) × 103 × min−1 × A 600 nm−1 × ml of culture−1 (24Manoil C. Methods Cell Biol. 1991; 34: 61-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). E. coli(pT18-MtPpm1/D2),E. coli(pT25-MtPpm1/D2), E. coli(pT18-MtPpm1/D2 + pT25-MtPpm1/D2), andE. coli(pT18-MsPpm1) were grown, washed, and sonicated as described previously (13Gurcha S.S. Baulard A.R. Kremer L. Locht C. Moody D.B. Muhlecker W. Costello C.E. Crick D.C. Brennan P.J. Besra G.S. Biochem. J. 2002; 365: 441-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). For further fractionation, the lysate of E. coli(pT18-MsPpm1) was centrifuged at 27,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The membrane fraction was obtained by further centrifugation of the 27,000 ×g supernatant at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. The supernatant was carefully removed, and the membranes were gently resuspended in buffer 50 mm MOPS (adjusted to pH 8.0 with KOH), 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 10 mm MgCl2 at a protein concentration of 20 mg/ml. Protein concentrations were determined using the BCA protein assay reagent kit (Pierce). Reaction mixtures for assessing [14C]Man transfer consisted of 2.4 μmGDP-[14C]Man (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, 321 mCi/mmol, 0.125 μCi), 62.5 μm ATP, 10 μmMgCl2, and crude or fractionated subcellular preparations corresponding to 80 μg of protein in a final volume of 80 μl. Exogenous lipid monophosphate substrates (C95, dolichol monophosphate) were added to the reaction mixtures at a final concentration of 0.125 mm in 0.25% CHAPS. The reaction mixtures were then incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. The reaction was terminated, and the lipids were extracted as described previously (13Gurcha S.S. Baulard A.R. Kremer L. Locht C. Moody D.B. Muhlecker W. Costello C.E. Crick D.C. Brennan P.J. Besra G.S. Biochem. J. 2002; 365: 441-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Thin-layer chromatography using 10% of the reaction mixture were conducted on aluminum-backed plates of Silica Gel 60 F254(Merck) using CHCl3/CH3OH/NH4OH/H2O (65/25/0.4/3.6). Autoradiograms were obtained by exposing chromatograms to Kodak X-Omat AR films at −70o for 4–5 days. In parallel, autoradiograms were exposed to a PhosphorImager screen, and radioactivity was quantified using a PhosphorImager detector (Storm,Amersham Biosciences). Consistent with the previously shown membrane association of the Polyprenol-P-Man synthase activity inM. tuberculosis (13Gurcha S.S. Baulard A.R. Kremer L. Locht C. Moody D.B. Muhlecker W. Costello C.E. Crick D.C. Brennan P.J. Besra G.S. Biochem. J. 2002; 365: 441-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), MtPpm1 contains TMS located in its N-terminal domain (D1). Since MtPpm1 uses GDP-Man as a substrate (11Besra G.S. Morehouse C.B. Rittner C.M. Waechter C.J. Brennan P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18460-18466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), its catalytic domain (D2) would be expected to be cytoplasmic where GDP-Man is readily available. To predict the topology of MtPpm1, we used seven different programs available on the internet (TMHMM, HMMTOP, DAS, TMPRED, MEMSAT2, TOPPRED, and PHDHTM) since the reliability of topology predictions increases substantially when different prediction methods are compared (25Nilsson J. Persson B. von Heijne G. FEBS Lett. 2000; 486: 267-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). When applied to MtPpm1, all seven programs converged to the presence of several TMS, most of which was located in the N-terminal half of the protein (D1), strongly suggesting thatMtPpm1 is an integral membrane protein (Fig. 1 A). However, the algorithms did not converge on the precise number of TMS and on the orientation of the catalytic domain (D2) of MtPpm1. In other mycobacterial species, such as M. leprae, M. avium, and M. smegmatis, the orthologs of the twoMtPpm1 domains, referred to as D1 and D2, are encoded by separate genes. The orthologs of the catalytic domain (D2) ofMtPpm1 are named Ppm1, and the orthologs of the N-terminal non-catalytic domain of MtPpm1 (D1) are named Ppm2. Application of the topology prediction algorithms on Ppm2 from M. smegmatis (MsPpm2) (Fig. 1 B), M. leprae (MlPpm2), and M. avium(MaPpm2) (data not shown) strongly suggests that these proteins, similar to the MtPpm1/D1 domain, are anchored in the bacterial membrane. In contrast, none of the seven methods predicted the presence of TMS in MsPpm1, MlPpm1, or MaPpm1, nor were signal sequences predicted in the N-terminal part of these proteins. These results suggest a cytoplasmic localization for these proteins and, by analogy, a cytoplasmic localization for the catalytic domain of MtPpm1. In Gram-negative bacteria, the topology of integral membrane proteins has largely been studied using PhoA fusions since the sites at which alkaline phosphatase has high enzymatic activity normally correspond to periplasmic domains of the membrane protein. In a previous report, we have shown that PhoA fusions can be used in mycobacteria to determine the cytoplasmic or extracytoplasmic location of proteins or protein domains (22Kremer L. Baulard A. Estaquier J. Content J. Capron A. Locht C. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 642-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). To determine the cellular location of the catalytic domain ofMtPpm1, we made use of PhoA fusions to various parts of the protein. The phoA gene was thus inserted into pMV261-MtPpm1, a plasmid previously shown to allow for overexpression of Mtppm1 in mycobacteria (13Gurcha S.S. Baulard A.R. Kremer L. Locht C. Moody D.B. Muhlecker W. Costello C.E. Crick D.C. Brennan P.J. Besra G.S. Biochem. J. 2002; 365: 441-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). ThephoA gene was inserted in-frame withMtppm1 either before (codon 465) or after (codon 600) the last predicted TMS (amino acids 509–527) of MtPpm1 (Fig. 1 A). The resulting constructs, named pMV261-MtPpm1/PhoA465 and pMV261-MtPpm1/PhoA600, respectively, were introduced into M. smegmatis mc2155, and the recombinant clones were tested for their ability to hydrolyze X-phosphate. When compared with untransformed bacteria, M. smegmatismc2155(pMV261-MtPpm1/PhoA465) exhibited an increased capacity to hydrolyze X-phosphate (25.7·10−2 ± 0.011 OD unit(s)·min−1·mg−1). In contrast,M. smegmatis mc2155 (pMV261-MtPpm1/PhoA600) did not hydrolyze X-phosphate (−0.178·10−2 ± 0.014 OD unit(s)·min−1·mg−1). These results indicate that amino acid 465 of MtPpm1 is localized in a portion of the protein facing the outside of the cell membrane, whereas the region surrounding amino acid 600 is cytoplasmic. This topology is in agreement with four out of the seven computer-assisted predictions (HMMTOP, DAS, MEMSAT, and PHDHTM). Moreover, these results are consistent with the predicted cytoplasmic location of theMtPpm1/D2 orthologs, Ppm1 from M. smegmatis,M. avium, and M. leprae. Computer predictions suggested a cytoplasmic location for MsPpm1. These predictions are consistent with the cytoplasmic location of GDP-Man and, by analogy, is strengthened by the cytoplasmic orientation of MtPpm1/D2. To experimentally localize MsPpm1, E. coli(pT18-MsPpm1) cells were fractionated, and both the soluble and membrane fractions were tested for their respective Polyprenol-P-Man synthase activities. Experiments performed in triplicate on two independent clones indicated that 94.6% (average [14C]Man incorporation, 276,249 cpm) of the Polyprenol-P-Man transferase activity is associated with the cytosolic fraction as compared with 5.4% (average [14C]Man incorporation, 15,719 cpm) associated with the membrane fraction. These data confirm that MsPpm1, when expressed independently ofMsPpm2 in E. coli, is located in the bacterial cytosol. The existence of a strictly conserved operon architecture for ppm2-ppm1 inM. leprae, M. avium, and M. smegmatissuggests that the two corresponding proteins participate in a common structural complex or metabolic pathway, consistent with the presence in M. tuberculosis of a single gene (Mtppm1) resulting from the fusion of the two corresponding open reading frames. It is thus likely that MsPpm1 and MsPpm2 are able to directly interact with each other. Among the general methodologies to identify interactions between proteins, the yeast two-hybrid system represents the most powerful in vivo approach. However, the detection of the interaction between MsPpm1 andMsPpm2 using a yeast two-hybrid system may be impaired by the association of MsPpm2 with the membrane. Therefore, to test whether MsPpm2 can interact with MsPpm1, a recently described bacterial two-hybrid system (16Karimova G. Pidoux J. Ullmann A. Ladant D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5752-5756Crossref PubMed Scopus (1141) Google Scholar) was used, which is suitable to study protein interactions even if one of the partners is membrane-associated. In this system, the interaction of two proteins results in functional complementation between two domains of the adenylate cyclase (CyaA) from Bordetella pertussis, leading to cAMP synthesis. As a soluble regulatory molecule, cAMP is then able to activate cAMP-dependent transcriptional events, which can be easily monitored (16Karimova G. Pidoux J. Ullmann A. Ladant D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5752-5756Crossref PubMed Scopus (1141) Google Scholar). The entire MsPpm1 was thus genetically fused to the 18-kDa domain of CyaA to produce pT18-MsPpm1, and MsPpm2 was fused to the 25-kDa domain of CyaA to produce pT25-MsPpm2. The cyclase-deficient E. coli strain DHP1 was co-transformed with the two constructs, and the resulting recombinant colonies were tested for their ability to metabolize maltose on McConkey agar plates supplemented with ampicillin and chloramphenicol. As shown in Fig. 2 A, E. coli DHP1 containing both fusions were able to metabolize maltose and appeared red, whereas colonies containing pT18-MsPpm1 with pT25 or pT25-MsPpm2 with pT18 were not able to metabolize maltose and remained white on McConkey-maltose plates. These results demonstrate specific interactions between MsPpm1 andMsPpm2. Since MsPpm1 and MsPpm2 correspond to domains D2 and D1 of MtPpm1, respectively, encoded by a single gene, we wanted to test whether D1 and D2 can also interact with each other, even in the absence of a covalent link between them. We therefore genetically disconnected the two domains and co-expressed them within the bacterial two-hybrid system.MtPpm1/D2 was fused to T18, and MtPpm1/D1 was fused to T25. After introduction of both constructs into E. coli DHP1, the colonies were found to be able to metabolize maltose on McConkey agar plates, in contrast to the cells containing pT18-MtPpm1/D2 and pT25 or pT25-MtPpm1/D1 and pT18 (Fig. 2 B). This result demonstrates that the two domains D1 and D2 of MtPpm1 can specifically interact with each other, even if they are not covalently linked. We have previously shown that MtPpm1/D1 has no Dol-P-Man synthase activity but increases Dol-P-Man production when its gene is overexpressed in M. smegmatis, suggesting that the M. tuberculosis MtPpm1/D1 may interact with the M. smegmatis MsPpm1 enzyme and may thereby increase its enzymatic activity. To test this hypothesis, pT18-MsPpm1 and pT25-MtPpm1/D1 were both introduced into E. coliDHP1. The recombinant bacteria showed a red color on McConkey-maltose plates (Fig. 2 C), demonstrating that MsPpm1 can interact with MtPpm1/D1. Vice versa, when pT18-MtPpm1/D2 and pT25-MsPpm2 were introduced into E. coli DHP1, the recombinant bacteria also displayed a red color on McConkey-maltose plates (Fig. 2 C). MsPpm2 and MtPpm1/D1 were both predicted to contain many TMS, suggesting that they are integral membrane proteins. Moreover, PhoA fusions demonstrated that MtPpm1 is associated with the membrane. Here, PhoA fusions were used to determine the global topology of MsPpm2. TnTap (21Ehrmann M. Bolek P. Mondigler M. Boyd D. Lange R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13111-13115Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) was randomly transposed in vitro into pT25-MsPpm2 using the EZ::TN transposase (Epicentre, Madison, WI), and the recombinant plasmids were introduced into E. coli CC118. Blue colonies obtained as a result of PhoA activity were selected on agar plates containing X-phosphate. The insertion positions of the mini-transposon were determined by DNA sequencing for 25 blue colonies that contained the phoA cassette in the Msppm2gene. Activities were measured according to Manoil (24Manoil C. Methods Cell Biol. 1991; 34: 61-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). The results confirm that MsPpm2 is an integral membrane protein and provide some insight into the topology of the protein (Fig. 3). The blue color obtained by insertion of phoA after codon 495 is similar to the results obtained after insertion of phoA in the corresponding region ofMtPpm1, indicating the extracytoplasmic location of this region for both proteins. Four of the seven algorithms predicted the existence of a TMS at approximately residue 450 (Fig. 1 B). However, the PhoA fusion data indicate that this TMS is unlikely since PhoA fusions upstream and downstream of residue 450 resulted in strong phosphatase activity. No TnPhoA insertions leading to a PhoA-positive phenotype were obtained in the region between Ala160 and Val222. However, based on the phosphatase activity of the PhoA insertions in the Gly88 to Gly116 region and the unanimous prediction of TMS Tyr117 to Ser134 and Ala160 to Ala139, this region of MsPpm1 is likely to be periplasmic. It is possible that insertions of TnTap in this region lead to unstable hybrid proteins. One colony with a very low phoA activity (phoA activity = 1.15 units) obtained after transposition revealed an insertion of TnTap in the region corresponding to Trp239 to Ala252, confirming that this portion of the protein is cytoplasmic (Fig. 3). Interestingly, the topology determined by the PhoA fusions together with the TMS predicted by all the algorithms used indicate that only very few amino acids of MsPpm2 are located at the cytoplasmic side of the membrane and may thus be available for the interaction with MsPpm1 (Figs. 3and 5).Figure 5Proposed comparative model for the stabilization of Dol-P-Man synthases and Polyprenol-P-Man synthases in membranes. As shown in A, the M. smegmatisPolyprenol-P-Man synthase MsPpm1 interacts with membrane-associated MsPpm2. LAM, lipoarabinomannan. As shown in B, the M. tuberculosis Polyprenol-P-Man synthase is a single-component enzyme harboring multiple TMS at the N terminus. As shown in C, the S. cerevisiaeDol-P-Man synthase is a single-component enzyme with a TMS near the C terminus (7Colussi P.A. Taron C.H. Mack J.C. Orlean P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7873-7878Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). As shown in D, human Dol-P-Man synthase consists of three subunits. Dpm2 associates with Dpm3, which in turn stabilizes the catalytic subunit Dpm1 (8Maeda Y. Tomita S. Watanabe R. Ohishi K. Kinoshita T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4920-4929Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 9Maeda Y. Tanaka S. Hino J. Kangawa K. Kinoshita T.

As shown in Fig. 4, E. coli co-producing T18-MtPpm1/D2 and T25-MtPpm1/D1 synthesized 4.8-fold more Dol-P-Man than E. coli cells producing T18-MtPpm1/D2 alone, demonstrating that the interaction between MtPpm1/D1 and MtPpm1/D2 leads to an increase in the catalytic activity of MtPpm1/D2. Due to the lack of a transporter, GDP-Man, a widely used mannosyl donor, is generally unable to cross biological membranes. Consequently, the enzymes that use GDP-Man are predicted to be located in the cytosol. In eukaryotes, Dol-P-Man synthase (EC 2.4.1.83) catalyzes the transfer of Man from GDP-Man to dolichol monophosphate, forming Dol-P-Man, which is subsequently translocated through the endoplasmic reticulum membrane to be used as a mannosyl donor in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum. The Dol-P-Man synthases are usually associated with the cytoplasmic side of the membrane, and two different mechanisms have been proposed for this membrane association (7Colussi P.A. Taron C.H. Mack J.C. Orlean P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7873-7878Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 17Kruszewska J.S. Saloheimo M. Migdalski A. Orlean P. Penttila M. Palamarczyk G. Glycobiology. 2000; 10: 983-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In S. cerevisiae, U. maydis, and T. brucei Dpm1 contains a C-terminal hydrophobic domain proposed to anchor the enzyme into the lipid bilayer of the membrane. In contrast, mammalian Dol-P-Man synthases are associated with the endoplasmic reticulum membrane through specific interactions with the hydrophobic protein Dpm3, in turn, stabilized by Dpm2 (8Maeda Y. Tomita S. Watanabe R. Ohishi K. Kinoshita T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4920-4929Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 9Maeda Y. Tanaka S. Hino J. Kangawa K. Kinoshita T. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2475-2482Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). In mycobacteria, the biosynthesis of cell wall glycoconjugates, such as lipoarabinomannan, also requires the transfer of Man residues through the bacterial membrane. The Man carriers in mycobacteria are Polyprenol-P-Man, isoprenoid derivatives that are shorter than Dol-P-Man and contain an unsaturated α-isoprene residue. In this study, we found that the synthesis of Polyprenol-P-Man in M. smegmatis is also mediated by two proteins, one being the catalytic MsPpm1 and the other being the “helper” protein MsPpm2.MsPpm1 and MsPpm2 interact in vivowhen co-produced in E. coli, and MsPpm2 enhances the catalytic activity of MsPpm1. Thus, as for mammalian Dpm1, MsPpm1 lacks the C-terminal hydrophobic domain but interacts instead with the integral membrane protein MsPpm2. This finding suggests a role for the two-domain structure of Ppm1 fromM. tuberculosis, in which the first domain would anchor the protein into the bacterial membrane. As shown by the bacterial two-hybrid assay, the two domains of MtPpm1 are able to interact with each other even in the absence of covalent linkage between them. Moreover, the interaction between the two domains ofMtPpm1 independently produced in E. coli results in enhanced Polyprenol-P-Man production. In addition, the capacity of interaction has been conserved between two mycobacteria that differ with respect to the genetic structure of theirppm1 genes, as illustrated by the capacity ofMsPpm1 and MsPpm2 to interact withMtPpm1/D1 and MtPpm1/D2, respectively. By analogy with the S. cerevisiae Dpm1 (ScDpm1),MtPpm1 contains a hydrophobic region responsible for its attachment to the bacterial membrane. However, in M. tuberculosis, the hydrophobic region is located in the N-terminal portion of the protein and is larger than the C-terminal hydrophobic domain of ScDpm1. On the other hand, MsPpm1 may be, to some extent, compared with the human Dpm1 as they both lack the C-terminal transmembrane domain and interact with a polypeptide (MsPpm2 versus human Dpm3) that is localized in the membrane. In contrast, MtPpm1/D2 and MsPpm1 are active when produced in E. coli, whereas human Dpm1 is not. Thus, as illustrated in Fig. 5, we propose to extend the family of Polyprenol-P-Man synthases by including two new members that use two original strategies of membrane association. MsPpm1 is a cytoplasmic soluble protein, whereasMsPpm2 is a hydrophobic protein containing of 6–8 predicted TMS. Due to the hydrophobic nature of MsPpm2, we have not been able to purify MsPpm2 to test physical interactions with MsPpm1 in vitro. However, the interactions could be studied in vivo by using a bacterial two-hybrid system based on the functional complementation between two domains of the cyaA gene from B. pertussis, which catalyzes the production of cAMP from ATP. Both the substrate and the product of the reaction are soluble in the cytosol, even if one of the partners of the two-hybrid system is anchored in the inner face of the membrane. This approach allowed us to demonstrate a specific interaction between the transmembrane protein MsPpm2 and its soluble catalytic partner MsPpm1. The bacterial two-hybrid system did not abolish the enzymatic activity of MtPpm1/D2 or MsPpm1, nor did it affect the enhancing effects ofMtPpm1/D1 and MsPpm2 on the enzymatic activities of MtPpm1/D2 and MsPpm1, respectively. Based on both the TMS prediction methods and the PhoA insertions, we deduced a topological model of MsPpm2 (Fig. 3). Surprisingly, the proposed model suggests that only few amino acids ofMsPpm2 are located at the cytoplasmic side of the membrane and may thus be available for the interaction withMsPpm1. Mutagenesis of residues of the N-terminal tail and of the first and second intracellular predicted loops ofMsPpm2 may help to identify amino acids implicated in the interaction with MsPpm1. The physical interaction demonstrated between MsPpm1 andMsPpm2 and the existence of MtPpm1 in M. tuberculosis containing the two domains fused into a single protein are an illustration of the Rosetta stone theory (15Marcotte E.M. Pellegrini M., Ng, H.L. Rice D.W. Yeates T.O. Eisenberg D. Science. 1999; 285: 751-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (1334) Google Scholar). This theory proposes that interactions between a protein of unknown function and a well characterized protein suggest that the function of the former is somewhat related to that of the latter. In accordance with this theory, the implication of MsPpm2 in the Polyprenol-P-Man synthesis pathway may have been inferred from the architecture of MtPpm1 (14Pellegrini M. Marcotte E.M. Thompson M.J. Eisenberg D. Yeates T.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4285-4288Crossref PubMed Scopus (1439) Google Scholar). In conclusion, the interaction of MsPpm1 withMsPpm2 allows us now to understand how the Polyprenol-P-Man synthase activity of M. smegmatis is associated with the membrane in the absence of a TMS in MsPpm1. Therefore, M. smegmatis uses a membrane-targeting strategy similar to that of the mammalian Dol-P-Man synthases. We thank D. Ladant and G.

These enzymes share structural and functional similarities and are therefore thought to have diverged from a common ancestral enzyme (1Jensen R.A. Annu. Rev.

The enzyme containing β-decarboxylating dehydrogenation activity involved in this process is homoisocitrate dehydrogenase (HICDH; EC 1.1.1.115). The reactions catalyzed by HICDH proceed in a manner similar to those by IPMDH and ICDH. In addition, IPMDH and ICDH show distinct identity in amino acid sequence to each other. Until recently, no genes have been identified and characterized as hicdh even in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, although its whole genome sequence has been determined (14Goffeau A. Barrell B.G. Bussey H. Davis R.W. Dujon B. Feldmann H. Galibert F. Hoheisel J.D. Jacq C. Johnston M. Louis E.J. Mewes H.W. Murakami Y. Philippsen P. Tettelin H. Oliver S.G.

Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 2344-2353Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) reported that the gene namedYIL094C of S. cerevisiae and the gene with the accession number T38612 of Schizosaccharomyces pombecould be likely candidates encoding HICDHs based on the amino acid sequence alignment for this protein family and the three-dimensional structures of IPMDH and ICDH. They further showed that the T38612product actually had HICDH activity but did not characterize it further. This new member of β-decarboxylating dehydrogenases is expected to lead us not only to elucidation of the substrate recognition but also to understanding evolution of the protein family as well as cellular metabolism including amino acid biosynthesis. However, unlike with ICDH and IPMDH, there is little information on properties of HICDH.Thermus thermophilus HB27, an extremely thermophilic bacterium, optimally grows at 70 °C. We recently found that this bacterium synthesizes lysine through AAA as an intermediate (15Kobashi N. Nishiyama M. Tanokura M. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 1713-1718Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) like fungi and yeast, although all bacteria and plants are believed to synthesize lysine through diaminopimelate. Sequence analysis of the cloned genes that were shown to be involved in the lysine biosynthesis suggested that the first half of the biosynthesis (from 2-oxoglutarate to AAA) proceeded in the same manner as that of fungi and yeast. The reactions were also suggested to be similar to those of leucine biosynthesis and a part of the tricarboxylic acid cycle (16Nishida H. Nishiyama M. Kobashi N. Kosuge T. Hoshino T. Yamane H. Genome Res. 1999; 9: 1175-1183Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The second half of the biosynthesis from AAA to lysine is, on the other hand, similar to the conversion of glutamate to ornithine in arginine biosynthesis (17Miyazaki J. Kobashi N. Nishiyama M. Yamane H. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 5067-5073Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). We have succeeded in cloning of most of the genes involved in lysine AAA biosynthesis in T. thermophilus HB27 (15Kobashi N. Nishiyama M. Tanokura M. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 1713-1718Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Nishida H. Nishiyama M. Kobashi N. Kosuge T. Hoshino T. Yamane H.

FEBS Lett. 2002; 512: 269-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). However, the gene encoding HICDH that converts homoisocitrate to 2-oxoadipate was not contained in the cloned DNA fragments. In this paper, we describe cloning of the gene encoding HICDH from T. thermophilus HB27 and, for the first time, detailed analysis of properties for HICDH including site-directed mutagenesis study. The evolutionary relationship among leucine biosynthesis, the tricarboxylic acid cycle, and newly identified lysine biosynthesis are also discussed.DISCUSSIONA gene coding for a new member of β-decarboxylating dehydrogenase, HICDH, has been cloned from an extreme thermophile,Thermus thermophilus HB27, and its involvement in lysine biosynthesis has been demonstrated. Although HICDH is indispensable for lysine AAA biosynthesis and its primary function in vivomust be the conversion of homoisocitrate to 2-oxoadipate, kinetic analysis showed that the enzyme can also utilize isocitrate, an intermediate of the tricarboxylic acid cycle, 20 times more efficiently compared with using homoisocitrate as a substrate (Table II, Fig. 3). This may indicate that the kinetic constant of an enzyme determinedin vitro does not always reflect its physiological role, or it may be possible that HICDH will substitute for ICDH in some cases. On the other hand, the catalytic efficiency in terms ofk cat/K m of ICDH for the ICDH reaction is in a range similar to that of HICDH for the same reaction. Therefore, this may suggest that ICDH can function in lysine AAA biosynthesis as well.HICDH and ICDH share similarities in primary sequence and reaction mechanism and are therefore thought to have diverged from a common ancestral enzyme (3Chen R. Jeong S. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 2344-2353Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). A common ancestor is thought to have broad substrate specificity (1Jensen R.A. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1976; 30: 409-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (814) Google Scholar), so an HICDH from T. thermophilusHB27 that can catalyze reactions contained in both lysine AAA biosynthesis and the tricarboxylic acid cycle may still have features of the ancestral-type enzyme. It should be noted that we recently found that homocitrate synthase, which catalyzes synthesis of homocitrate from 2-oxoglutarate and acetyl-CoA, the first reaction in lysine biosynthesis of T. thermophilus HB27, was able to catalyze the synthesis of citrate from oxaloacetate and acetyl-CoA, the corresponding reaction by citrate synthase in the tricarboxylic acid cycle, although homocitrate synthase has no structural similarity to citrate synthase (39Wulandari A.P. Miyazaki J. Kobashi N. Nishiyama M. Hoshino T. Yamane H. FEBS Lett. 2002; 522: 35-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Taken together with our previous results on LysJ and LysK (17Miyazaki J. Kobashi N. Nishiyama M. Yamane H. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 5067-5073Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 18Miyazaki J. Kobashi N. Fujii T. Nishiyama M. Yamane H. FEBS Lett. 2002; 512: 269-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), both of which are able to catalyze the reactions in lysine and arginine biosynthesis, dual functions and/or broad specificity may be common features of lysine biosynthetic enzymes ofT. thermophilus HB27.Amino acid residues responsible for binding the malate moiety of the substrates are completely conserved in β-decarboxylating dehydrogenases, including HICDH (Fig. 2). Therefore, the corresponding residues are presumably involved in substrate binding even in HICDH. However, amino acid residues in the β-strand 3-α-helix 4 loop that recognize the γ-moiety (Fig. 1) are not conserved between ICDH and IPMDH. According to the three-dimensional structure of IPMDH ofT. ferrooxidans, three residues (Glu88, Leu91, and Leu92 in T. ferrooxidansIPMDH numbering (38Imada K. Inagaki K. Matsunami H. Kawaguchi H. Tanaka H. Tanaka N. Namba K. Structure. 1998; 6: 971-982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar)) are specific determinants for recognition of 3-isopropylmalate (Fig. 6). Leu91 and Leu92 make hydrophobic contacts with the γ-isopropyl group of 3-isopropylmalate, and Glu88interacts with the nicotinamide ring of NAD+ for stabilizing the Michaelis complex. Glu88 also serves to prevent IPMDH from binding the γ-carboxylate group of isocitrate via charge repulsion. On the other hand, in ICDH from E. coli, two residues (Ser113 and Asn115 in the numbering of E. coli ICDH) are indicated by x-ray structural analysis to be responsible for isocitrate recognition (36Hurley J.H. Thorsness P.E. Ramalingam V. Helmer N.H. Koshland D.E., Jr. Stroud R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 8635-8639Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Ser113 forms a hydrogen bond to the γ-carboxylate group of isocitrate, and Asn115 interacts both with the γ-carboxylate group of isocitrate and with NADP+. Due to the polar environment of the γ-moiety-binding site of the ICDH, the hydrophobic isopropyl moiety of 3-isopropylmalate is excluded from the site. In HICDH, regions probably recognizing the γ-moiety are also occupied by amino acid residues different from those in ICDH and IPMDH (Figs. 1 and 2). Chen and Jeong (3Chen R. Jeong S. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 2344-2353Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) aligned amino acid sequences of several enzymes in this protein family and suggested Tyr106and Ile110 (numbering according to HICDH from S. cerevisiae) as the residues that were necessary for recognition of the γ-moiety of homoisocitrate. They speculated that the phenolic hydroxyl group of Tyr106 formed a hydrogen bond to δ-carboxylate of homoisocitrate analogous to Ser113 inE. coli ICDH. In HICDH from T. thermophilus HB27, however, the corresponding position is occupied by phenylalanine. This indicates that the mechanism for recognition of homoisocitrate has to be reconsidered in HICDH.Figure 6Superimposition of three-dimensional structures around the active sites of IPMDH of T. ferrooxidans (green; PDB 1A05) and ICDH ofE. coli (magenta; PDB 1AI2) with bound substrates.

Jeong S. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 2344-2353Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar).2 To elucidate the difference in the mechanism for substrate recognition betweenThermus and yeast HICDHs, we introduced amino acid replacements into the β-strand 3-α-helix 4 loop region ofThermus HICDH. An altered enzyme, HICDH/7Sc, containing the same sequence as that of S. cerevisiae HICDH in the loop displayed activity for homoisocitrate but not for isocitrate, indicating that the loop actually does contain the determinants for substrate specificity in HICDH. Among the altered HICDHs, all of the enzymes with Val at position 85 completely lost the ability to utilize isocitrate as a substrate. These results indicate that Arg85 is required for recognition of isocitrate as a substrate in Thermus HICDH. However, this result looks confusing, because the corresponding position (116 in E. coli ICDH) is also occupied by Val in ICDH. Val116 inE. coli ICDH does not directly interact with substrate nor NADP+, but replacement of the residue by Leu or Ser converted the ICDH to preference toward 3-isopropylmalate (9Doyle S.A. Fung S.F. Koshland D.E., Jr. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 14348-14355Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). This suggests that substrate recognition of the loop residues differs between these enzymes.The phylogenetic tree of HICDH, ICDH, and IPMDH from various sources indicates that HICDH from T. thermophilus HB27 belongs to one group along with the HICDHs from two yeasts and DR1674 fromD. radiodurans that is suggested to synthesize lysine through AAA (Fig. 3). According to the hicdh knockout experiment, the gene was shown to be involved in lysine biosynthesis. Nevertheless, unlike the case for yeast HICDHs, ThermusHICDH has higher activity for isocitrate. Our present study indicates that only a few amino acid replacements are enough to convertThermus HICDH to an enzyme that is specific to homoisocitrate. Since HICDH/7Sc displayed extremely high thermostability comparable with that of the wild-type enzyme, which may ensure that the microorganism grows at extremely elevated temperatures, we may assume that it would be possible for the organism to acquire mutations that could generate a homoisocitrate-specific enzyme. We at present do not know what causes the enzyme to have dual functions or quite higher activity for isocitrate. Physiology and metabolism will have to be investigated in detail for T. thermophilus HB27 to understand this.We previously reported that an anaerobic hyperthermophilic archaeaon,Pyrococcus horikoshii, has a gene cluster that is very similar to that of T. thermophilus HB27, with each component of the archaeon tightly linked to the corresponding counterpart inT. thermophilus HB27 in phylogenetic analysis, suggesting that the archaeaon probably synthesizes lysine through AAA as in the case of T. thermophilus HB27 (16Nishida H. Nishiyama M. Kobashi N. Kosuge T. Hoshino T. Yamane H. Genome Res. 1999; 9: 1175-1183Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). However, PH1722, an HICDH homolog, in the gene cluster of P. horikoshii does not belong to this group in the phylogenetic tree but rather to the IPMDH group (Fig. 3). Similar gene clusters were also found in two related thermoacidophilic archaea, Sulfolobus tokodaii strain 7 and Sulfolobus sulfataricus, whose genome sequences have recently been determined (40Kawarabayasi Y. Hino Y. Horikawa H. Jin-no K. Takahashi M. Sekine M. Baba S. Ankai A. Kosugi H. Hosoyama A. Fukui S. Nagai Y. Nishijima K. Otsuka R. Nakazawa H. Takamiya M. Kato Y. Yoshizawa T. Tanaka T. Kudoh Y.

U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7835-7840Crossref PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar). Recently, expression of the gene cluster was shown to be regulated by LysM, an Lrp-like transcriptional regulator, depending on the presence or absence of lysine (42Brinkman A.B. Bell S.D. Lebbink R.J. de Vos W.M. van der Oost J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29537-29549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), although the functions of the cluster have not yet been analyzed. Based on these observations, it is speculated that the twoSulfolobus species also synthesize lysine through AAA. However, it is of interest that these microorganisms carry nohicdh-homologous genes other than icd andleuB in their genomes. IPMDH (LeuB) was isolated fromS. tokodaii strain 7 and analyzed in detail (2Suzuki T. Inoki Y. Yamagishi A. Iwasaki T. Wakagi T. Oshima T. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 1174-1179Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). TheSulfolobus IPMDH cannot utilize homoisocitrate or isocitrate as substrates (2Suzuki T. Inoki Y. Yamagishi A. Iwasaki T. Wakagi T. Oshima T. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 1174-1179Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).2 This may suggest that the HICDH reaction of lysine AAA biosynthesis in Sulfolobus could be catalyzed by a putative ICDH. In order to prove this hypothesis, substrate specificity of the putative ICDH has to be analyzed. In any case, PH1722 in Pyrococcus and the putative ICDHs in theSulfolobus species could be keys to elucidate evolution of β-decarboxylating dehydrogenase. It should be also noted that the HICDH group is monophyletic, with a deep divergent point between IPMDH and ICDH groups. This suggests that HICDH has not evolved from IPMDH or ICDH but rather directly from an ancestral enzyme of β-decarboxylating dehydrogenase.Amino acid sequence identity between HICDH and ICDH is 45%, and the basic mechanisms for reactions and substrate recognition to bind a malate moiety seem similar between the two enzymes. However, although these enzymes also showed similar catalytic efficiency (k cat/K m) for the reaction with homoisocitrate or isocitrate, profiles in the kinetic parameters were different; HICDH has larger k cat andK m values, and ICDH has smallerk cat and K m values. In addition, HICDH is a much more heat-stable enzyme than ICDH. Determination of structures of both enzymes may lead us to understand not only the detailed catalytic mechanism but also molecular evolution along with the heat stability of these enzymes. Among β-decarboxylating dehydrogenases, 3-isopropylmalate dehydrogenase (IPMDH1; EC1.1.1.85), an enzyme catalyzing the fourth reaction in leucine biosynthesis, and isocitrate dehydrogenase (ICDH; EC 1.1.1.42), one of the enzymes in the tricarboxylic acid cycle, catalyze similar β-decarboxylating dehydrogenation of structurally similar compounds, 3-isopropylmalate and isocitrate, respectively (Fig. 1). These enzymes share structural and functional similarities and are therefore thought to have diverged from a common ancestral enzyme (1Jensen R.A. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1976; 30: 409-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (814) Google Scholar, 2Suzuki T. Inoki Y. Yamagishi A. Iwasaki T. Wakagi T. Oshima T. J.

Many studies have been done to elucidate the structural and functional basis for substrate specificity, heat stability, and evolution of this protein family (5Yaoi T. Miyazaki K. Komukai Y. Oshima T.

Koshland D.E., Jr. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 14348-14355Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Conversion of homoisocitrate to 2-oxoadipate is supposed to occur in lysine biosynthesis through α-aminoadipate (AAA), a pathway that has been believed to be present only in fungi and yeast (Fig. 1) (10Vogel H.J. The American Naturalist. 1964; 98: 446-455Crossref Google Scholar, 11Broquist H.P. Methods Enzymol. 1971; 17: 112-129Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 12Gaillardin C.M. Ribet A.M. Heslot H. Eur.

The enzyme containing β-decarboxylating dehydrogenation activity involved in this process is homoisocitrate dehydrogenase (HICDH; EC 1.1.1.115). The reactions catalyzed by HICDH proceed in a manner similar to those by IPMDH and ICDH. In addition, IPMDH and ICDH show distinct identity in amino acid sequence to each other. Until recently, no genes have been identified and characterized as hicdh even in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, although its whole genome sequence has been determined (14Goffeau A. Barrell B.G. Bussey H. Davis R.W. Dujon B. Feldmann H. Galibert F. Hoheisel J.D. Jacq C. Johnston M. Louis E.J. Mewes H.W. Murakami Y. Philippsen P. Tettelin H. Oliver S.G. Science. 1996; 274: 563-567Crossref Scopus (3207) Google Scholar). Recently, Chen and Jeong (3Chen R. Jeong S. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 2344-2353Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) reported that the gene namedYIL094C of S. cerevisiae and the gene with the accession number T38612 of Schizosaccharomyces pombecould be likely candidates encoding HICDHs based on the amino acid sequence alignment for this protein family and the three-dimensional structures of IPMDH and ICDH. They further showed that the T38612product actually had HICDH activity but did not characterize it further. This new member of β-decarboxylating dehydrogenases is expected to lead us not only to elucidation of the substrate recognition but also to understanding evolution of the protein family as well as cellular metabolism including amino acid biosynthesis. However, unlike with ICDH and IPMDH, there is little information on properties of HICDH. Thermus thermophilus HB27, an extremely thermophilic bacterium, optimally grows at 70 °C. We recently found that this bacterium synthesizes lysine through AAA as an intermediate (15Kobashi N. Nishiyama M. Tanokura M. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 1713-1718Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) like fungi and yeast, although all bacteria and plants are believed to synthesize lysine through diaminopimelate. Sequence analysis of the cloned genes that were shown to be involved in the lysine biosynthesis suggested that the first half of the biosynthesis (from 2-oxoglutarate to AAA) proceeded in the same manner as that of fungi and yeast. The reactions were also suggested to be similar to those of leucine biosynthesis and a part of the tricarboxylic acid cycle (16Nishida H. Nishiyama M. Kobashi N. Kosuge T. Hoshino T. Yamane H. Genome Res. 1999; 9: 1175-1183Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The second half of the biosynthesis from AAA to lysine is, on the other hand, similar to the conversion of glutamate to ornithine in arginine biosynthesis (17Miyazaki J. Kobashi N. Nishiyama M. Yamane H. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 5067-5073Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). We have succeeded in cloning of most of the genes involved in lysine AAA biosynthesis in T. thermophilus HB27 (15Kobashi N. Nishiyama M. Tanokura M. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 1713-1718Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Nishida H. Nishiyama M. Kobashi N. Kosuge T. Hoshino T. Yamane H.

FEBS Lett. 2002; 512: 269-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). However, the gene encoding HICDH that converts homoisocitrate to 2-oxoadipate was not contained in the cloned DNA fragments. In this paper, we describe cloning of the gene encoding HICDH from T. thermophilus HB27 and, for the first time, detailed analysis of properties for HICDH including site-directed mutagenesis study. The evolutionary relationship among leucine biosynthesis, the tricarboxylic acid cycle, and newly identified lysine biosynthesis are also discussed. DISCUSSIONA gene coding for a new member of β-decarboxylating dehydrogenase, HICDH, has been cloned from an extreme thermophile,Thermus thermophilus HB27, and its involvement in lysine biosynthesis has been demonstrated. Although HICDH is indispensable for lysine AAA biosynthesis and its primary function in vivomust be the conversion of homoisocitrate to 2-oxoadipate, kinetic analysis showed that the enzyme can also utilize isocitrate, an intermediate of the tricarboxylic acid cycle, 20 times more efficiently compared with using homoisocitrate as a substrate (Table II, Fig. 3). This may indicate that the kinetic constant of an enzyme determinedin vitro does not always reflect its physiological role, or it may be possible that HICDH will substitute for ICDH in some cases. On the other hand, the catalytic efficiency in terms ofk cat/K m of ICDH for the ICDH reaction is in a"

We evaluated both the growth inhibition by cisplatin and cisplatin-induced cell death in the Hmgb1−/− cells and its wild-type counterpart. No significant differences were observed in the responses of these cells to cisplatin, indicating that HMGB1 does not play a significant role in modulating the cellular responses to cisplatin in this context. Since HMGB1 significantly enhances the cytotoxicity of cisplatin in other cells, these results illustrate the importance of cell type in determining the ability of this and probably other cisplatin-DNA-binding proteins to influence the efficacy of the drug.

Lippard S.J. Chem. Rev. 1999; 99: 2467-2498Crossref PubMed Scopus (2565) Google Scholar). Whereas cisplatin is extremely effective in treating testicular cancer, the cure rate being >90% when tumors are promptly diagnosed (2Bosl G.J. Motzer R.J. N. Engl. J. Med. 1997; 337: 242-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar), the curative potential of the drug against other tumors, such as ovarian, breast, and lung cancers, is significantly undermined by intrinsic and acquired resistance (3Perez R.P. Eur. J. Cancer. 1998; 34: 1533-1542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (336) Google Scholar). Determining the factors that influence cellular sensitivity to cisplatin is thus important for understanding the anticancer activity of cisplatin and for developing a more effective platinum-based chemotherapy. The cytotoxicity of cisplatin arises from its ability to react with DNA and form covalent DNA adducts (4Lepre C.A. Lippard S.J. Nucleic Acids Mol. Biol. 1990; 4: 9-38Crossref Google Scholar). The major adducts, 1,2-intrastrand d(GpG) and d(ApG) platinum-DNA cross-links, are formed by coordination of the {Pt(NH3)2}2+ moiety to the N7 atoms of adjacent purines in double-stranded DNA. The cisplatin modification produces distinct changes in the architecture of the DNA duplex that inhibit replication and transcription and stimulate nucleotide excision repair (1Jamieson E.R. Lippard S.J. Chem. Rev. 1999; 99: 2467-2498Crossref PubMed Scopus (2565) Google Scholar). Cisplatin damage throughout the genome leads to cell cycle arrest and apoptosis (5Chu G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 787-790Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, cisplatin-DNA adducts are recognized by a variety of cellular proteins, a process that may affect the fate of platinum-DNA lesions and the responsiveness of tumor cells to cisplatin treatment (6Zlatanova J. Yaneva J. Leuba S.H. FASEB J. 1999; 12: 791-799Crossref Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 7Kartalou M. Essigmann J.M. Mutat. Res. 2001; 478: 1-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). Recognition of cisplatin-modified DNA by damage recognition proteins in the nucleotide excision repair pathway leads to the removal of platinum lesions and restoration of genomic integrity. Studies have suggested that increase in the repair of platinum-DNA adducts is key to cisplatin resistance (3Perez R.P. Eur. J. Cancer. 1998; 34: 1533-1542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (336) Google Scholar). Several proteins not involved in repair, including HMGB1, TATA-binding protein, and other structure-specific recognition proteins, also bind tightly to the major platinum-DNA adducts (1Jamieson E.R. Lippard S.J. Chem. Rev. 1999; 99: 2467-2498Crossref PubMed Scopus (2565) Google Scholar). The role that these proteins might play in mediating the cytotoxicity of cisplatin is a subject of much current interest. One hypothesis, which has been proposed in various studies, suggests that the binding of these proteins to platinum-DNA adducts blocks the removal of DNA lesions, thereby enhancing the sensitivity of cells to cisplatin (8Donahue B.A. Augot M.

HMGB1, an abundant chromosomal protein in mammalian cells, interacts with platinum-DNA intrastrand d(GpG) and d(ApG) cross-links and interferes with their repair in vitro. It is thus one of the candidate proteins for participation in the repair shielding mechanism (11Huang J.-C. Zamble D.B. Reardon J.T. Lippard S.J. Sancar A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10394-10398Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar, 15Pil P.M. Lippard S.J. Science. 1992; 256: 234-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar). HMGB1 belongs to the family of proteins that contain at least one HMG box domain, an 80-amino acid DNA-binding motif that recognizes bent DNA structures (16Read C.M. Cary P.D. Crane-Robinson C.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 1604-1613Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). HMGB1 is highly conserved in mammals with >95% amino acid identity between rodent and human forms (16Read C.M.

HMGB1 is an extremely versatile protein. It increases transcription activation involving steroid hormone receptors, p53, Hox, and Pou protein (18Boonyaratanakornkit V. Melvin V. Prendergast P.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4981-4991Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). The regulation of transcription activation by HMGB1 is attributed to its DNA binding and bending activity. Protein-protein interactions between HMGB1 and the transcription factors presumably facilitate the formation of high order nucleoprotein complexes required for transcription initiation (for a review, see Ref. 21Muller S. Scaffidi P. Degryse B. Bonaldi T. Ronfani L. Agresti A. Beltrame M. Bianchi M.E. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4337-4340Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). Hmgb1 knockout mice die shortly after birth due to hypoglycemia resulting from a defect in transcription activation by the glucocorticoid receptor (22Calogero S. Grassi F. Aguzzi A. Voigtlander T. Ferrier P. Ferrari S. Bianchi M.E. Nat. Genet. 1999; 22: 276-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). Beside its intranuclear roles, HMGB1 was also discovered recently to function as an extracellular signaling molecule during inflammation, cell differentiation, cell migration, and tumor metastasis (23Scaffidi P.

HMGB1 is secreted by certain cells, including macrophages and monocytes (21Muller S. Scaffidi P. Degryse B. Bonaldi T. Ronfani L. Agresti A. Beltrame M. Bianchi M.E. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4337-4340Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). The secretion and signaling mechanism by which HMGB1 activates cells during these processes is largely unknown. HMGB1 has been linked to cisplatin activity in a number of studies. HMGB1 binds specifically to cisplatin-modified 1,2-intrastrand d(GpG) and d(ApG) cross-links but not to the DNA adducts formed by the clinically inactive isomer,trans-diamminedichloroplatinum(II) (15Pil P.M. Lippard S.J. Science. 1992; 256: 234-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar, 26Hughes E.N. Engelsberg B.N. Billings P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13520-13527Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Addition of HMGB1 to an in vitro nucleotide excision repair assay inhibited the repair of cisplatin-DNA damage (11Huang J.-C. Zamble D.B. Reardon J.T. Lippard S.J. Sancar A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10394-10398Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar, 14Zamble D.B., Mu, D. Reardon J.T. Sancar A. Lippard S.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 10004-10013Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Given the abundance of HMGB1 in nuclei, one copy per kb of the human genome, and its roles in various biological processes, it was hypothesized that the cellular HMGB1 level might modulate the cisplatin sensitivity of cancer cells. Consistent with this notion, hormone-induced HMGB1 up-regulation in MCF-7 breast cancer cells correlates with enhanced cisplatin sensitivity (27He Q. Liang C. Lippard S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5768-5772Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Increased cisplatin sensitivity was also observed in a lung adenocarcinoma cell line transfected with a plasmid expressing HMGB2, a protein with more than 80% identity to HMGB1 (28Arioka H. Nishio K.

A recent study, however, showed that loss of NHP6A, an abundant HMG box protein in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, sensitized yeast to cisplatin, suggesting that a mechanism other than repair shielding was in effect in the yeast system (29Wong B.

To investigate further how HMGB1 might affect cisplatin sensitivity in mammalian cells, we studied the cisplatin sensitivity and cisplatin-induced apoptosis in the mouse Hmgb1−/− cell line. Here, we report the results of this work and discuss its implications. Our studies reveal little difference in the cisplatin sensitivity and cisplatin-induced apoptosis between the Hmgb1−/− and its parental cell lines, suggesting that in this mouse model, HMGB1 does not modulate cellular sensitivity to cisplatin. To our knowledge, this is the first direct examination of the impact of HMGB1 loss on cisplatin sensitivity in mammalian cells. Mouse embryonic fibroblast cell lines, Hmgb1+/+ and Hmgb1−/−, were kindly provided by M. E. Bianchi (22Calogero S. Grassi F. Aguzzi A. Voigtlander T. Ferrier P. Ferrari S. Bianchi M.E. Nat. Genet. 1999; 22: 276-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). Cells were maintained as monolayer cultures in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's media containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum and 2 mm l-glutamine at 37 °C in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2. Cell extracts were prepared from near confluent cells on 100-mm plates. Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 250 μl of buffer containing 2% SDS, 10 μg/ml of pepstatin, leupeptin and aprotinin, and 0.5 mg/ml Pefabloc in phosphate-buffered saline. The lysate was pulled through a 25G5/8 syringe needle to shear genomic DNA and was cleared by centrifugation. The protein concentrations of extracts were determined by a bicinchoninic acid protein assay kit (Sigma). The proteins in cell extracts were resolved on 12% SDS-PAGE gels and then electroblotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Bio-Rad). Following blocking with a 5% bovine serum albumin and 0.01% Tween 20 solution in Tris-buffered saline at pH 7.4, membranes were incubated in the primary antibody, rabbit α-HMGB1 (1:2,000 dilution) (Pharmingen), in 0.01% Tween 20 at pH 7.4 with Tris-buffered saline. Finally, blots were incubated in the secondary antibody, 1:2,000 dilution of α-rabbit whole antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Biosciences). After washing, blots were soaked for 1 min in chemiluminescent reagents (Sigma) and then exposed to BioMax film (Eastman Kodak Co.). Cells were seeded on 96-well plates at a density of 1,000 cells/100 μl/well. Treatment with cisplatin began the next day after cells had attached to the plates. For continuous treatment, cells were incubated in growth medium containing various concentrations of cisplatin for 72 h. For short time treatment, cells were treated with cisplatin-containing medium for 4 h followed by incubation in drug-free medium for an additional 90 h. After incubation, the cell density of each sample was determined by using WST-1, a tetrazolium salt (Chemicon International Inc.). The assay was carried out according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, 10 μl of WST-1 dissolved in Electro Coupling Solution (Chemicon International Inc.) was added to each well of 96-well plates that contained cells at the end of the incubation. Plates were incubated under standard growth conditions for 1.5 h, and the absorbance at 440 nm was recorded by using an absorbance microplate reader, SpectroMax 340pc (Molecular Devices). Percentages of surviving cells were calculated by the ratio of absorbance of cisplatin-treated cultures over that of untreated control culture. Cisplatin kill curves were obtained by plotting the percentage of survival against the concentration of cisplatin. In addition, a second set of cultures was analyzed by using sulforhodamine B (SRB). First, 10% cold trichloroacetate solution was added to the cells. Plates were incubated for 30 min at 4 °C to allow fixation to come to completion and then washed five times with distilled water. Plates were air-dried at room temperature in the hood. Trichloroacetate-fixed cells in each well were then stained with 100 μl of 0.4% (w/v) SRB in 1% acetic acid for 30 min. Excess SRB was removed by washing the plates four times with 1% acetic acid. Plates were air-dried until no remaining moisture was visible. The bound SRB was solubilized by adding 100 μl of 10 mm Tris base (pH 10.5) to each well and shaking for 5 min on a shaker platform. The absorbance at 564 nm was recorded by using the microplate reader. Cisplatin kill curves were obtained as described above. A portion (1.5 × 105) of cells was plated on 60-mm plates and allowed to attach overnight. Cells were then incubated in cisplatin-containing media for 34 h. After incubation, the attached cells in each plate were collected by trypsinization and combined with the detached cells of the same sample. Cells were washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended in the binding buffer (Pharmingen). Cell suspensions were counted with a hemocytometer and diluted to a final concentration of 1 × 106 cells/ml. An aliquot of cells (100 μl) was labeled with propidium iodide (PI) and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated annexin V (annexin V-FITC) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The labeled cell suspensions were analyzed by a flow cytometer, FACScan, equipped with a 488-nm argon laser light source (BD Biosciences). The emission filter used was 515–545 nm for FITC and 563–607 nm for DNA·PI complexes. Data were analyzed with CellQuest software. Cell debris was excluded from data analysis. Two independent methods were used to compare the cisplatin sensitivity of the Hmgb1−/− and wild-type mouse cells. The WST-1 assay measures the live cell population because WST-1 is quantitatively reduced to a colored formazan in viable cells (30Decker T. Lohmann-Matthes M.L. J. Immunol. Methods. 1988; 115: 61-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (1062) Google Scholar, 31Korzeniewski C. Callewaert D.M. J. Immunol. Methods. 1983; 64: 313-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (924) Google Scholar). The SRB assay measures cell density by quantitating colored sulforhodamine B bound to cells fixed to the plates by trichloroacetate (32Rubinstein L.V. Shoemaker R.H. Paull K.D. Simon R.M. Tosini S.

Cancer. 1993; 29A: 395-399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Similar results were obtained by using the two methods (Fig. 1). Cisplatin inhibited the growth of Hmgb1+/+ and Hmgb1−/−cells to a similar extent when added to growth medium for 72 h (Fig. 1, A and B). Likewise, a 4-h cisplatin treatment followed by an 84-h incubation in drug-free medium equally inhibited the growth of both cell lines (Fig. 1, C andD). No significant difference between the cisplatin sensitivity of Hmgb1+/+ and Hmgb1−/− cells was observed in repeated trials. A common cellular response to cisplatin exposure is activation of the apoptotic pathway (34Eastman A. Cancer Cells. 1990; 2: 275-280PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, the apoptosis of Hmgb1+/+ and Hmgb1−/− cells induced by cisplatin was probed by labeling with PI and annexin V-FITC. Early apoptotic cells lose membrane phospholipid asymmetry and expose phosphatidylserine on the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane. Previous work has demonstrated that phosphatidylserine externalization in apoptotic cells can be labeled with annexin V-FITC and quantitated by flow cytometry (35Boersma A.W.M. Nooter K. Oostsrum R.G. Stoter G. Cytometry. 1996; 24: 123-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 36Clarke R. Lund E. Johnson I.I. Pinder A.

Cytometry. 1996; 24: 131-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). The late apoptotic cells and dead cells can also be labeled with PI in addition to the annexin V labeling because of damaged cell membrane. The annexin V-FITC/PI assay has been successfully applied to study cisplatin-induced apoptosis in a number of cell lines (35Boersma A.W.M. Nooter K. Oostsrum R.G. Stoter G. Cytometry. 1996; 24: 123-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 38Pestell K.E. Hobbs S.M. Titley J.C. Kelland L.R. Walton M.I. Mol.

Fig. 2 shows the density plots of PI fluorescence versus annexin V-FITC fluorescence obtained from control (untreated) or cisplatin-treated Hmgb1+/+ and Hmgb1−/− mouse cells. These cells were continuously treated with cisplatin for 34 h before fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis. The plots illustrate four cell populations (live, apoptotic, necrotic, and late apoptotic/dead) defined by their fluorescence characteristics. Live cells are annexin V- and PI-negative. Early apoptotic cells are annexin V-positive and PI-negative; their membranes are not permeable. Necrotic cells are annexin V-negative and PI-positive because of damaged cell membrane. The late apoptotic and dead cells are both annexin V- and PI-positive. The untreated Hmgb1+/+ and Hmgb1−/− cell cultures contained very few apoptotic cells (<3%) but included 6–7% dead cells, which we assign as the background cell death in these cultures. By comparison, significant percentages of apoptotic cells and dead cells were present in cisplatin-treated cultures. The necrotic populations in all cultures were generally less than 4%, suggesting that dead cells did not arise from necrosis following cisplatin treatment. The sums of apoptotic and dead cell populations in cultures treated with various concentrations of cisplatin are plotted in Fig. 3. Hmgb1−/− cells exhibited similar levels of apoptosis as wild-type Hmgb1+/+cells for all concentrations of cisplatin. Similar apoptotic responses to cisplatin in the Hmgb1−/− and Hmgb1+/+cells were consistently observed in repeated experiments.Figure 3Cisplatin induces similar apoptotic responses in Hmgb1+/+ and Hmgb1−/− cells. Eachbar represents the sum of percentages of the early apoptotic (annexin V+/PI−) and late/dead cells (annexin V+/PI−) in the given culture.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The expression levels of HMGB1 are similar in different tissues of the same animal (40Bucci L.R. Brock W.A. Meistrich M.L. Biochem. J. 1985; 229: 233-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). It is not clear whether different animals have significantly different levels of expressed protein. Here, we used Western blotting to compare the levels of HMGB1 in the mouse fibroblasts with those in MCF-7 cells, a human breast cancer line. The same total amount of cellular proteins was subjected to SDS-PAGE separation and Western analysis using the HMGB1 antibody. The Western blot showed similar levels of HMGB1 expression in the mouse fibroblasts and MCF-7 cells (Fig. 4). The goal of this study was to explore the connection between HMGB1 levels and the sensitivity of mammalian cells to cisplatin. We addressed this question by comparing the response of wild-type cells with those of Hmgb1 knockout mouse cells established previously (22Calogero S. Grassi F. Aguzzi A. Voigtlander T. Ferrier P. Ferrari S. Bianchi M.E. Nat. Genet. 1999; 22: 276-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). Hmgb1−/− mice die shortly after birth due to a defect in the transcriptional activation of the glucocorticoid receptor, consistent with the notion that HMGB1 functions as a regulator of transcription involving steroid hormone receptors. The HMGB1 deficiency is also manifested at the cellular level. The cultured Hmgb1−/− embryonic fibroblasts are defective in transcription activation by the glucocorticoid and progesterone receptors (22Calogero S. Grassi F. Aguzzi A. Voigtlander T. Ferrier P. Ferrari S. Bianchi M.E. Nat. Genet. 1999; 22: 276-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). The Hmgb1−/− cells have a morphology and growth rate similar to those of the Hmgb1+/+ cells, and the levels of Hmgb2 and Hmgb3 mRNA are comparable in both cell lines (22Calogero S. Grassi F. Aguzzi A. Voigtlander T. Ferrier P. Ferrari S. Bianchi M.E. Nat. Genet. 1999; 22: 276-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). The Hmgb1−/− and the wild-type cell lines thus provide an adequate system for investigating the involvement of HMGB1 in cellular responses to cisplatin. Both the growth inhibition by cisplatin and cisplatin-induced apoptosis in the Hmgb1−/− and the wild-type cells were examined. Two independent methods (see “Experimental Procedures”) revealed that continuous treatment with cisplatin inhibited the growth of Hmgb1−/− cells to the same extent as that of Hmgb1+/+ cells (Fig. 1). When cells were treated with cisplatin for a short time (4 h), the survival rates of both cell lines were also similar (Fig. 1). Furthermore, the cisplatin-induced apoptosis in these cells was investigated by using annexin V-FITC/PI labeling. In cisplatin-treated cell cultures of both lines, there was a significant apoptotic (annexin V-positive) but very little necrotic population (annexin V-negative/PI-positive), suggesting that the cells die via the former pathway (Fig. 2). Increasing cisplatin concentration in the cultures resulted in increasing apoptosis in both cell lines, confirming that apoptosis of the cells was induced by cisplatin (Figs. 2 and 3). Comparison of the apoptotic population in the Hmgb1−/− and Hmgb1+/+ cultures treated with the same concentrations of cisplatin showed essentially the same degree of cell death in both cell lines (Fig. 3). Collectively, these results indicate that the Hmgb1−/− cells are as sensitive to cisplatin as the Hmgb1+/+ cells. HMGB1 has been implicated in the cytotoxicity of cisplatin since the discovery of its ability to bind cisplatin-modified DNAin vitro. A number of experiments (42Dunham S.U. Lippard S.J.

Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 2956-2964Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) have discerned the molecular interactions between HMGB1 and cisplatin-modified DNA. Few studies, however, investigated the effect of HMGB1 on cisplatin sensitivity at the cellular level. The present results suggest that HMGB1 does not play a significant role in the mechanism of cisplatin-induced cytotoxicity in the mouse embryonic cells. Given the high binding affinity of HMGB1 for cisplatin-modified DNA and the abundance of HMGB1 in mammalian cells, this observation seems surprising. There are, however, a number of scenarios that might prevent HMGB1 from interacting with cisplatin-modified DNA in the cells and modulating their responses to cisplatin. One possibility is that the HMGB1 level in the mouse embryonic fibroblasts is considerably lower than that of cells in other tissues or animals, such as MCF-7 human breast cancer cells, the subject of a previous study (27He Q. Liang C. Lippard S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5768-5772Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). A Western analysis for HMGB1 levels in both cell lines excluded this possibility. More likely is that HMGB1 proteins engage in tight interactions with other targets in the cells. HMGB1 contains two tandem HMG boxes and an extremely acidic C-terminal domain (21Muller S. Scaffidi P. Degryse B. Bonaldi T. Ronfani L. Agresti A. Beltrame M. Bianchi M.E. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4337-4340Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar), through which it interacts with several other proteins (19Jayaraman L. Moorthy N.C. Murthy K.G.K. Manley J.L. Bustin M. Prives C. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 462-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar, 20Zappavigna V. Falciola L., C.M., H. Mavilio F. Bianchi M.E.

Chem. 1999; 274: 628-634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In the mouse fibroblasts, HMGB1 proteins may be engaged in tight nucleoprotein complexes and may not be available for ready binding to cisplatin-modified DNA. A recent study discovered that during apoptosis induced by tumor necrosis factor α, HMGB1 became firmly attached to the hypoacetylated chromatin. The binding of HMGB1 to apoptotic chromatin may similarly block the interaction of HMGB1 to platinum-DNA adducts (23Scaffidi P. Misteli T. Bianchi M.E. Nature. 2002; 418: 191-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (3247) Google Scholar). Finally, as yet unidentified proteins in these embryonic cells may dominate the interaction with cisplatin-modified DNA. A comprehensive analysis of the correlation between cisplatin sensitivity and protein expression levels in cells may lead to the discovery of such protein candidates. In any event, our results stress the importance of cell type in determining the ability of this and possibly other platinated DNA-binding proteins to influence the effectiveness of cisplatin as a cytotoxic agent. HMGB1 has been postulated to influence cellular sensitivity to cisplatin through specific binding to cisplatin-DNA 1,2-intrastrand cross-links. Our results reveal little difference in the cisplatin sensitivity and cisplatin-induced apoptosis in embryonic native and Hmgb1−/− cell lines, suggesting that in this mouse model, HMGB1 does not modulate the cellular sensitivity to cisplatin."

In contrast, system III, which was discovered through extensive genetic analysis in fungi and seems to be restricted to the mitochondria of vertebrates and invertebrates, is a minimal system with a single component, the so-called cytochromec and c 1 heme lyases (CCHL and CC1HL) (36Dumont M.E.

The system III CCHLs display no sequence similarity to system I and system II components; the similarity between individual CCHLs is itself limited to the occurrence in their N-terminal domains of between one to three CPV motifs that are believed to be involved in an interaction with heme (40Steiner H.

Goldman B.S. Res. Microbiol. 2002; 153: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Genetic studies in the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii have assigned up to six loci, plastid ccsA and nuclear CCS1 to CCS5(43Howe G. Merchant S.

Two of these have been identified molecularly. CcsA, encoded by the ccsA locus (46Xie Z. Merchant S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4632-4639Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), is a multiple membrane-spanning protein and contains the tryptophan-rich motif with the “WWD” signature first noted in CcmC and CcmF of system I (4Xie Z.

Ccs1 lacks any domains or structural features that might speak to a specific chemical function, and it appears to be unique to system II (20Thöny-Meyer L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1459: 316-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 47Inoue K. Dreyfuss B.W. Kindle K.L. Stern D.B. Merchant S. Sodeinde O.A. J. Biol.

Genetic studies in Bacillus subtilis and Arabidopsis thaliana, and functional genomics in Bordetella pertussis, revealed two additional components required forc-type cytochrome biogenesis in system II (48Schiött T. Throne-Holst M. Hederstedt L. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 4523-4529Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 49Beckett C.S. Loughman J.A. Karberg K.A. Donato G.M. Goldman W.E. Kranz R.G. Mol.

Plant Cell. 2001; 13: 2539-2551Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). One is a membrane-anchored thioredoxin-like protein with its thiol-reducing active site on the p-side of the membrane, called ResA/HCF164/CcsX, respectively (49Beckett C.S. Loughman J.A. Karberg K.A.

Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 1374-1385Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the other is CcdA, discovered originally in B. subtilis (48Schiött T. Throne-Holst M. Hederstedt L. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 4523-4529Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 52Schiött T. von Wachenfeldt C. Hederstedt L. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 1962-1973Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). CcdA corresponds to the central portion of DipZ/DsbD, which functions in transmembrane thiol redox metabolism in E. coli and other bacteria (53Katzen F. Deshmukh M. Daldal F. Beckwith J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3960-3969Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In B. pertussis, DipZ/DsbD is believed to function together with CcsX to provide the reductant to reduce apocytochromes, either directly or indirectly, on the p-side of the membrane before attachment of heme to the cysteinyl thiols (49Beckett C.S. Loughman J.A. Karberg K.A. Donato G.M. Goldman W.E. Kranz R.G. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 38: 465-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). For CcsA, CcdA, or CcsX, conserved sequence motifs suggest functional domains, but this has not been the case for Ccs1, which is a highly divergent protein. Its apparently essential function in popular bacterial model systems has hindered mutational analysis (54Tichy M. Vermaas W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32396-32401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the fact that the cytochrome assembly pathways operate on multiple, divergent apoprotein substrates (two in C. reinhardtii and up to seven in B. pertussis(42Kranz R.G. Beckett C.S. Goldman B.S. Res. Microbiol. 2002; 153: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar)) may be suggestive of a direct interaction between Ccs1 and the apocytochrome. The limited sequence relationship among Ccs1 proteins would therefore be a consequence of co-evolution with the highly divergent apocytochromes. In this work, we undertake molecular and functional analyses of Ccs1. First, we confirm through molecular complementation that mutants previously assigned to the CCS1locus are the result of lesions in the Ccs1 gene. Molecular characterization of each ccs1 allele reveals that a stromal loop appears to be functionally important, at least for the stability of Ccs1 in vivo. Second, we suggest that Ccs1 functions together not only with CcsA, as has been shown in an accompanying paper (55Hamel P. Dreyfuss B.W. Xie Z. Gabilly S. Merchant S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2593-2603Google Scholar), but also with multiple other Ccs components to form a “CCS complex.” Third, we undertake membrane topological analysis and site-directed mutagenesis to generate a functional model for Ccs1. We find that a single histidine residue, located within the final transmembrane domain, preceding the large soluble domain is necessary for c-type cytochrome assembly in chloroplasts.

Arginine-auxotrophic strain arg7cw15A used for insertional mutagenesis was obtained from Prof. J.-D. Rochaix, University of Geneva, Switzerland. Wild-type strains were grown at 22–25 °C in TAP medium (58Harris E.H. The Chlamydomonas Sourcebook: A Comprehensive Guide to Biology and Laboratory Use. Academic Press, San Diego1989Google Scholar) under cool fluorescent lights (15–125 μmol m−2 s−1) with agitation (225 rpm). Mutant strains were grown under the same conditions, except that the illumination was always reduced (15–25 μmol m−2s−1). The C. reinhardtii mutant y-1(yellow-in-the-dark; CC-735) strain was grown in TAP medium at 22 °C, wrapped in aluminum foil when necessary to prevent exposure to light. To de-green light-exposed green cells, one-half of the culture was diluted every day into fresh TAP medium. In 10 days green cells were de-greened to a Chl concentration of 0.029 μg/ml. To re-green the cells (to a Chl concentration of 3.6 μg/ml), the flasks were unwrapped and exposed to light (100–125 μmol m−2s−1) at 22 °C. ccs1-6::ARG7strain was generated by insertional mutagenesis as described previously (45Dreyfuss B.W. Merchant S. Garab G. Photosynthesis: Mechanisms and Effects. Kluwer Academic Publishers, The Netherlands1998: 3139-3142Google Scholar). Briefly, arg7cw15A-recipient cells were transformed with EcoRI-linearized pARG7.8φ3 by the glass bead transformation method (59Gumpel N.J. Rochaix J.D. Purton S. Curr. Genet. 1994; 26: 438-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 60Kindle K.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1228-1232Crossref PubMed Scopus (812) Google Scholar). Arginine prototrophic colonies were screened based on their variable fluorescence to identify candidate mutants blocked on the reducing side of Photosystem II (61Fenton J.M. Crofts A.R. Photosynth. Res. 1990; 26: 59-66PubMed Google Scholar). Candidate ccs mutants were screened for accumulation of holocyt f and holocyt c 6 by heme staining and immunoblot analysis as described below. Theccs1-6::ARG7 strain was deposited into the Chlamydomonas Genetics Center (CC-3715/CC-3716). ccs1 strains grown in TAP medium (3–7 × 106 cells/ml) were collected by centrifugation, 1,500 × g for 5 min, and used directly for transformation (ccs1-6::ARG7) after resuspension in TAP medium (2 × 108 cells/ml) or (for strainsccs1-ac206 and ccs1-2 through 4) were resuspended in autolysin (prepared according to Ref. 62Funke R. Kovar J. Weeks D.P. Plant Physiol. 1997; 114: 237-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) at 2 × 108 cells/ml and incubated for 30–45 min to digest away the cell wall, after which autolysin was diluted by addition of 40 ml of TAP medium. The cells were recovered by centrifugation at 1,500 × g for 5 min. For glass bead transformation (60Kindle K.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1228-1232Crossref PubMed Scopus (812) Google Scholar), 0.3 ml of cells were vortexed for 15 s in the presence of 0.3 mg of acid-washed glass bead and DNA. 1 μg of SalI-linearized wild-type pCcs1-2 DNA (simply referred to as pCcs1 for remainder of paper (47Inoue K. Dreyfuss B.W. Kindle K.L. Stern D.B. Merchant S. Sodeinde O.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31747-31754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar)) was used for complementation transformations. Co-transformation experiments included the addition of 1 μg of EcoRI-linearized pSP109 encoding the ble marker (63Lumbreras V. Stevens D.R. Purton S. Plant J. 1998; 14: 441-447Crossref Scopus (267) Google Scholar). 1 μg of EcoRI-linearized pTZ18U was used in control transformation reactions to assess the frequency of reversion. Vortexed cells were diluted in 10 ml of TAP and transferred to 50-ml flasks for recovery overnight in a shaking incubator. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in 1 ml of minimal medium without acetate (58Harris E.H. The Chlamydomonas Sourcebook: A Comprehensive Guide to Biology and Laboratory Use. Academic Press, San Diego1989Google Scholar). 0.5 ml of cells were plated on minimal agar plates and incubated at 50–125 μmol m−2s−1 until photosynthetic colonies appeared (about 1–2 weeks). The remaining 0.5 ml of cells were plated onto TAP + zeomycin (ZeocinTM, Invitrogen) (10 μg/ml) agar plates and incubated at 50–125 μmol m−2 s−1 until zeomycin-resistant transformants appeared (about 2–3 weeks). For the “empty vector” control transformations, the entire mix was plated onto minimal agar plates for selection for phototrophic growth. The presence of introduced Ccs1 sequences was confirmed by amplification of the integrated pCcs1 DNA using a gene-specific primer (CCS1–7; see Table I of the Supplemental Material for all primers) and the Universal M13 −20 primer specific for the vector. 7 μl of genomic DNA, prepared as described previously (64Quinn J.M. Nakamoto S.S. Merchant S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14444-14454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), was amplified using Taq DNA polymerase in the presence of 5% Me2SO. Amplification conditions were 94 °C for 5 min prior to addition of polymerase, 25 cycles of 94 °C for 1 min, 52 °C for 45 s, 72 °C for 1 min, with a final 5-min extension at 72 °C. Cytochromes were detected after freeze-thaw fractionation and analysis of electrophoretically separated supernatant and pellet fractions by immunodecoration or by heme staining as described previously (43Howe G. Merchant S. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2789-2801Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 47Inoue K. Dreyfuss B.W. Kindle K.L. Stern D.B. Merchant S. Sodeinde O.A. J. Biol.

Enriched thylakoid membrane fractions were prepared from sonicated cell lysates and analyzed immediately by denaturing PAGE according to Ref. 43Howe G. Merchant S. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2789-2801Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar. To increase efficiency of transfer of electrophoretically separated enriched thylakoid membrane proteins, 0.01% SDS was added to the transfer buffer (25 mm Tris, 192 mm glycine, 20% methanol). Enriched thylakoid membrane proteins were transferred at 50 V, 4 °C for ∼2 h to 0.2-μm polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Immobilon PSQ, Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). Polyclonal antisera raised against C. reinhardtii cytochromec 6 (1:1000), cytochrome f fusion protein (1:1000) (66Chen X. Kindle K.L. Stern D.B. Plant Cell. 1995; 7: 1295-1305PubMed Google Scholar), and Trx-Ccs1 fusion protein (1:100) (see Experimental Procedures in the Supplemental Material) were used for detection of cyt c 6, cyt f, and Ccs1, respectively. Bound antibodies were detected chromagenically using alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibodies. 3 μg of genomic DNA (see the Experimental Procedures for isolation in the Supplemental Material) was digested with restriction enzymes and analyzed by Southern blot hybridization. For strains ccs1-ac206 and ccs1-1, the probe was prepared using Genesis non-radioactive nucleic acid labeling kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), hybridized, and detected chromogenically following the manufacturer's procedure. For strainsccs1-3, ccs1-4, and the insertional mutant,ccs1-6::ARG7, the probe was prepared and detected as described previously (67Church G. Gilbert W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 1991-1995Crossref PubMed Scopus (7267) Google Scholar, 68Merchant S. Hill K. Kim J.H. Thompson J. Zaitlin D. Bogorad L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 12372-12379Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Genomic DNA fromccs1-ac206, ccs1-2, ccs1-3,ccs1-4, and CC125 strains representing ∼4 kb containing Ccs1 encoding DNA was sequenced. Sequences representing both DNA strands were obtained for the entire region from CC125. For the mutant alleles, the entire gene except intron 7 was sequenced. CCS1was amplified from genomic DNA in five fragments (Fig. 1 B) by using primers sets A = CCS1–1 + CCS1–10, B = CCS1–2 + CCS1–9, C = CCS1–3 + CCS1–12, D = CCS1–4 + CCS1–11, andintron 7 = CCS1–17 + CCS1–20 using eitherTaq DNA polymerase or ExpandTM DNA polymerase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Amplification reactions (25 μl) contained 0.2 mm dNTPs, 0.64 pmol of each primer, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 5% Me2SO in addition to the manufacturer's recommended components. Reactions were preheated at 94 °C for 2 min, prior to the addition of the polymerase, followed by 30 cycles as follows: 94 °C for 30 s; 56 °C for 45 s; 72 °C for 1 min; with a final 7-min extension at 72 °C. Amplification products were gel-purified by the freeze-squeeze method (69Tautz D. Renz M. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 132: 14-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar), sequenced directly by dye termination cycle sequencing using 3′ dye-labeled dideoxynucleotide triphosphates according to the manufacturer's instruction, and run on an ABI PRISMTM DNA Sequencer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Sequences were compiled and compared using ABI PRISMTM AutoAssembler program (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Mutations were confirmed by sequencing multiple independent amplification products. The procedure for RNA isolation has been described previously (70Merchant S. Bogorad L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 462-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The abundance ofCcs1 mRNA was estimated by amplification of cDNA under conditions that were suitable for quantitative estimation of transcript abundance relative to Cpx1 transcript abundance. Total RNA was treated with RQ1-DNase (Promega, Madison, WI), phenol/chloroform-extracted, and ethanol-precipitated as preparation for template for reverse transcription. Five μg of treated RNA was used as template for Moloney murine leukemia virus-reverse transcriptase according to the manufacturer's suggested procedure (Invitrogen) using pdN6 random primers (AmershamBiosciences) (1.5 μl/20-μl reaction). Control reactions were set up with same input RNA but without the addition of reverse transcriptase (−RT). 1.5 μl of product was amplified directly in reactions (25 μl) containing 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm dNTPs, 0.64 pmol of each primer, 5% Me2SO, and 1.25 units of Taq polymerase (Fisher) with other components as specified by the manufacturer of the enzyme.Ccs1 transcripts or Cpx1 transcripts were amplified with primer sets CCS1–5 and CCS1–6 (Fig. 1 B) or CPX1–1 and CPX1–2, respectively (64Quinn J.M. Nakamoto S.S. Merchant S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14444-14454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Amplifications conditions are as follows: 94 °C for 2 min; 30 cycles at 94 °C for 30 s, 50 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 45 s and a final extension of 72 °C for 7 min (on a GeneAmp PCR system 2400; PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The yield of both products was dependent on the amount of input RNA (0.05–10 μg). The amount of pdN6 primer was determined to be saturating for synthesis of the cDNA, and the subsequent amplification reaction was in the exponential stage up to 35 cycles. The presence of the H274A mutation was confirmed bySacII digestion of the PCR product. Eight CcsB-PhoA translational fusions were generated by PCR amplification of various segments of the Synechocystis ccsB gene (slr2087) with Pfu polymerase. The pccsB:phoA plasmids expressing translational fusions of CcsB to PhoA with fusions at positions 23, 67, 134, 225, 288, 349, 410, and 458 of the CcsB polypeptide were constructed as described in the Experimental Procedures of the Supplemental Material. CcsB-encoding PCR products were cloned into pRGK200 (8Monika E.M. Goldman B.S. Beckman D.L. Kranz R.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 271: 679-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), in-frame with the downstreamphoA gene encoding alkaline phosphatase to yield the series of ccsB:phoA fusion plasmids. The reciprocal ccsB:lacZα fusions for all junctions were generated from the series of pccsB:phoAplasmids by replacing a 2.6-kb SalI-PstI fragment including the entire phoA gene with a 0.7-kb PCR-amplifiedlacZ segment corresponding to the α fragment of β-galactosidase in-fra"

Mass spectrometric analysis of the de-O-acylated lipopolysaccharide (LPS) of the mutant showed that it consisted of a bisphosphorylated glucosamine backbone with two 3-hydroxyhexadecanoic acids in amide-linkage, 4-amino-4-deoxyarabinose (Ara4N) residues on both phosphates, and a core oligosaccharide of the sequence Ara4N-(1 → 8)d-glycero-d-talo-oct-2-ulosonic acid (Ko)-(2 → 4)3-deoxy-d-manno-oct-2-ulosonic acid (Kdo). The mutant allowed investigations on the biosynthesis of the LPS as well as on its role in human infection. Mutant Ko2b showed no difference in its ability to invade human macrophages as compared with the wild type. Furthermore, isolated LPS of both strains induced the production of tumor necrosis factor α from macrophages to the same extent.

Furthermore, the organism can antagonize and repress many soil-borne plant pathogens and is considered as a plant growth-promoting rhizobacterium (6Holmes A. Govan J. Goldstein R. Emerg. Infect. Dis. 1998; 4: 221-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). However, regarding the pathogenic potential of B. cepacia, there has been a controversial discussion about the use and especially the liberation of this organism for biological control and soil decontamination purposes (6Holmes A.

The so-called cepacia syndrome occurs in ∼20% of CF patients infected with B. cepacia, and is characterized by fever, acute necrotizing pneumonia, and bacteremia with a high mortality (12Isles A. Maclusky I. Corey M. Gold R. Prober C. Fleming P. Levison H. J. Pediatr. 1984; 104: 206-210Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar). In CGD patients B. cepacia pneumonia is the second leading cause of death (13O'Neil K.M. Herman J.H. Modlin J.F. Moxon E.R. Winkelstein J.A. J. Pediatr. 1986; 108: 940-942Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 14Winkelstein J.A. Marino M.C. Johnston R.B.J. Boyle J. Curnutte J. Gallin J.I. Malech H.L. Holland S.M. Ochs H. Quie P. Buckley R.H. Foster C.B. Chanock S.J. Dickler H. Medicine. 2000; 79: 155-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (1226) Google Scholar).The genome of B. cepacia consists of two to four chromosomes with an overall genome size of 5–9 Mb and is characterized by a large number of insertion elements (15Lessie T.G. Hendrickson W. Manning B.D. Devereux R. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1996; 144: 117-128Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Wigley P. Burton N.F. J. Appl. Microbiol. 2000; 88: 914-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). These mobile elements could easily facilitate the horizontal transfer of virulence genes from other pathogenic bacteria and thus enhance the pathogenicity of B. cepacia (11Govan J.R. Deretic V. Microbiol. Rev. 1996; 60: 539-574Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Previous studies have demonstrated that B. cepacia strains are able to invade macrophages and respiratory epithelial cells (17Tipper J.L. Ingham E. Cove J.H. Todd N.J. Kerr K.G. Clin. Microbiol. Infect. 1998; 4: 450-459Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 18Martin D.W. Mohr C.D. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 24-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) and can persist in macrophages; however, without significant bacterial replication (19Saini L.S. Galsworthy S.B. John M.A. Valvano M.A. Microbiology. 1999; 145: 3465-3475Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). This property could contribute to the pathogenicity of the bacteria in lung damage and their systemic spread. A number of virulence factors are known forB. cepacia. In addition to extracellular products such as hemolysins, proteases, and lipases, iron-binding siderophores play a major role for virulence (20Sokol P.A. Darling P. Woods D.E. Mahenthiralingam E. Kooi C. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 4443-4455Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as well as mucin binding cable pili, which adhere to mucin in lungs of CF patients (21Sun L. Jiang R.Z. Steinbach S. Holmes A. Campanelli C. Forstner J. Sajjan U. Tan Y. Riley M. Goldstein R. Nat. Med. 1995; 1: 661-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Another important virulence determinant is the lipopolysaccharide (LPS),1 which is likely to contribute to the inflammatory nature of B. cepaciainfections in cystic fibrosis patients. Clinical isolates as well as environmental strains possess LPS of high inflammatory potential (22Hughes J.E. Stewart J. Barclay G.R. Govan J.R. Infect. Immun. 1997; 65: 4281-4287Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which induces much higher levels of tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) in monocytes than the LPS from Pseudomonas aeruginosa (23Zughaier S.M. Ryley H.C. Jackson S.K. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 1505-1507Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,24Shaw D. Poxton I.R. Govan J.R. FEMS Immunol. Med. Microbiol. 1995; 11: 99-106Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and stimulates the up-regulation of other proinflammatory cytokines (25Hutchison M.L. Bonell E.C. Poxton I.R. Govan J.R. FEMS Immunol. Med. Microbiol. 2000; 27: 73-77Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Shimomura H. Matsuura M. Saito S. Hirai Y. Isshiki Y. Kawahara K. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 3663-3669Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar).The common architecture of LPS and most steps of its biosynthesis are well known (27Raetz C.R. Whitfield C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 635-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (3281) Google Scholar). One sugar constituent of the inner core region, found in all LPS structures, is 3-deoxy-d-manno-oct-2-ulosonic acid (Kdo), which is directly linked to the lipid A. Most LPS contain an α(2 → 4)-linked Kdo disaccharide in their inner core region; however, several bacteria like Haemophilus,Vibrio, and Bordetella depict one phosphorylated Kdo in this position (28Holst O. Brade H. Opal S.M. Vogel S.N. Morrison D.C. Endotoxin in Health and Disease. Marcel Dekker Inc., New York1999: 115-154Google Scholar). In case of LPS from B. cepaciaATCC 25416 it was revealed that the inner core region consists of ad -glycero-d-talo-oct-2-ulosonic acid (Ko) α(2 → 4) Kdo disaccharide where the Ko residue is substituted non-stoichiometrically with 4-aminoarabinose (Ara4N) in position 8 (29Isshiki Y. Kawahara K. Zähringer U. Carbohydr. Res. 1998; 313: 21-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The unusual sugar Ko has been found earlier as a substitute for Kdo in the LPS of Acinetobacter (30Kawahara K. Brade H. Rietschel E.T. Zähringer U. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 163: 489-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 31Vinogradov E.V. Müller-Loennies S. Petersen B.O. Meshkov S. Thomas-Oates J.E. Holst O. Brade H. Eur. J.

Biochem. 1997; 243: 122-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) andTatlockia (33Kawahara K. Dejsirilert S. Ezaki T. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1998; 169: 283-287Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and was recently identified in the LPS ofYersinia pestis (34Vinogradov E.V. Lindner B. Kocharova N.A. Senchenkova S.N. Shashkov A.S. Knirel Y.A. Holst O. Gremyakova T.A. Shaikhutdinova R.Z. Anisimov A.P. Carbohydr. Res. 2002; 337: 775-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), but so far nothing is known about the significance of this substitution. Interestingly, the core region ofBurkholderia caryophylli does not contain Ko (35Molinaro A., De Castro C. Lanzetta R. Evidente A. Parrilli M. Holst O. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10058-10063Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). A lot of data exist about the biosynthesis and transfer of Kdo into the LPS (36Rick P.D. Raetz C.R.H. Brade H. Opal S.M. Vogel S.N. Morrison D.C. Endotoxin in Health and Disease. Marcel Dekker Inc., New York1999: 283-304Google Scholar); however, no data are available about the incorporation of Ko. One could assume that a specific enzyme introduces a hydroxyl function at position 3 of the side branch Kdo. On the other hand, Ko could be synthesized by an independent pathway and transferred by a specific transferase. To answer these questions we investigated the early glycosyltransferases involved in the biosynthesis of the LPS inB. cepacia ATCC 25416. First, the Kdo transferase (WaaA) of this strain was cloned and characterized to determine whether it is a mono- or bifunctional enzyme. We show here that B. cepaciaharbors a bifunctional Kdo transferase comparable to WaaA fromEscherichia coli. Second, the gene encoding heptosyltransferase I (waaC) was cloned from B. cepacia, expressed in Corynebacterium glutamicum and characterized as a monofunctional heptosyltransferase in vitro and in vivo.Although most clinical isolates belong to genomovar III, so far the type strain ATCC 25416 (genomovar I) is the only strain of the B. cepacia complex with a known LPS core structure (29Isshiki Y. Kawahara K. Zähringer U. Carbohydr. Res. 1998; 313: 21-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Whether Ko is a constituent of the LPS in other genomovars, as well, remains to be investigated. We were interested in whether it was possible to generate a deep-rough, heptose-less mutant of the type strain in order to find out whether the mutant also contained a Ko residue in its truncated LPS. To incorporate this unusual sugar the bacterium has to use an additional biosynthetic pathway or at least an additional modifying enzyme. To learn something about the reasons why bacteria replace the conserved Kdo residues partially with Ko, the biological activity of the mutant was compared with that of the wild type. The answers to some of these questions are reported here.DISCUSSIONThe main chain of the inner core region in the LPS of B. cepacia consists of a trisaccharide with two heptose and one Kdo residues. However, the substitution at position 4 of the Kdo is a Ko residue and not a second Kdo residue as inEnterobacteriaceae, nor a phosphate group as inVibrio, Haemophilus, or Bordetella.This sugar has been found in other species as well (30Kawahara K. Brade H. Rietschel E.T. Zähringer U. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 163: 489-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 34Vinogradov E.V. Lindner B. Kocharova N.A. Senchenkova S.N. Shashkov A.S. Knirel Y.A. Holst O. Gremyakova T.A. Shaikhutdinova R.Z. Anisimov A.P. Carbohydr. Res. 2002; 337: 775-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 63Sonesson A. Jantzen E. Bryn K. Tangen T. Eng J. Zähringer U. Microbiology. 1994; 140: 1261-1271Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), but only in B. cepacia ATCC 25416 Ko was found to replace Kdo in stoichiometric amounts. So far it is not known whether Ko is the product of a separate biosynthetic pathway and is transferred by a specific Ko transferase or whether it is generated by oxidation of free Kdo, CMP-Kdo, or after incorporation into the LPS. To answer these questions, it was necessary to determine first whether the Kdo transferase of B. cepacia is a mono- or bifunctional enzyme, since a monofunctional Kdo transferase would strongly support the incorporation of Ko by a specific Ko transferase. Cell-free extracts, prepared from B. cepacia ATCC 25416, were used as a source for Kdo transferase and tested in in vitro experiments. These extracts exhibited a bifunctional action, generating a disaccharide linked to the lipid A acceptor. However, it was not possible to exclude the presence of a putative Ko transferase in these assays and because it is not known whether the antibodies used were able to distinguish between Ko and Kdo in the reaction product. To investigate the Kdo transferase in detail the enzyme was cloned and expressed in the Gram-positive host C. glutamicum. The cloned enzyme displayed a bifunctional activity when Kdo was included in the assay. Interestingly, it was not possible to clonewaaA from a gene library of B. cepacia in analogy to other Kdo transferases (39Noah C. Brabetz W. Gronow S. Brade H. J. Endotoxin Res. 2001; 7: 25-33Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 64Belunis C.J. Clementz T. Carty S.M. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27646-27652Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 65Isobe T. White K.A. Allen A.G. Peacock M. Raetz C.R.H. Maskell D.J. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 2648-2651Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) in E. coli strain CJB26, harboring an intact copy of the waaA gene on a temperature-sensitive plasmid (64Belunis C.J. Clementz T. Carty S.M. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27646-27652Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). For the monofunctional Kdo transferase from H. influenzae it was shown that the enzyme supported growth of E. coli CJB26 (66White K.A. Raetz C.R.H. FASEB J. 1998; 12: L44Google Scholar). However, in another system a viable mutant could only be generated when the Kdo kinase was also present (50Brabetz W. Müller-Loennies S. Brade H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34954-34962Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). One explanation why the Kdo transferase from B. cepacia was not able to support growth could be the large phylogenetic difference between both species; E. colibelongs to the γ-group of proteobacteria with a G + C content of 52% and B. cepacia belongs to the β-group with a G + C content of 64%. The waaA gene has a G + C content of 73%.To study the biosynthesis of the inner core region more closely it was necessary to generate a genetically defined deep-rough mutant ofB. cepacia. We decided to do so by inactivation of heptosyltransferase I. The waaC gene was cloned from a gene library by in vivo complementation and tested. It displayed a monofunctional activity in vivo and in vitro, comparable to all other WaaC enzymes investigated so far (39Noah C. Brabetz W. Gronow S. Brade H. J. Endotoxin Res. 2001; 7: 25-33Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 40Gronow S. Brabetz W. Brade H. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 6602-6611Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 43Kadrmas J.L. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2799-2807Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar,67de Kievit T.R. Lam J.S. J.

Larson J. Lin L., So, M. Nassif X. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1997; 151: 41-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Thus, the heptosyltransferase of B. cepacia acted as well on acceptors containing Ko or Kdo, indicating that the enzyme is not able to distinguish between Kdo and Ko in the acceptor molecule. By inserting a kanamycin resistance cassette into waaC the gene was inactivated in vitro and introduced into B. cepacia where the plasmid was integrated into the chromosome by homologous recombination. The instable, merodiploid intermediate had to undergo a second recombination event, and thus the active copy ofwaaC and additional vector sequences were excised, leaving the inactivated copy of heptosyltransferase I on the chromosome. The resulting mutant Ko2b depicted a deep-rough LPS phenotype in silver-stained gels (Fig. 4) and could be complemented to express complete S-form LPS by transformation with a plasmid harboringwaaC from B. cepacia (data not shown).We constructed a deep-rough mutant in order to obtain an LPS with the lowest complexity to facilitate the structural analysis, which indicated that the mutant also contains Ko as a substituent for Kdo. Therefore, it is concluded that the incorporation of Ko is achieved before the first heptose residue is added to the LPS. From earlier investigations on B. cepacia LPS (70Cox A.D. Wilkinson S.G. Mol. Microbiol. 1991; 5: 641-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) it was known that only minor amounts of Kdo were detectable and that at least one phosphate group of the lipid A was substituted with Ara4N. Our data showed that both phosphate groups are substituted with Ara4N, confirming assumptions by Helander et al. (71Helander I.M. Kato Y. Kilpeläinen I. Kostiainen R. Lindner B. Nummila K. Sugiyama T. Yokochi T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 237: 272-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) that in B. cepacia also the glycosidically linked phosphate is substituted with Ara4N. Further structural investigations revealed the presence of the trisaccharide Ara4N (1 → 8) Ko (2 → 4) Kdo in the core region of strain ATCC 25416; however, the substitution of Ko with Ara4N was estimated to about 25% (29Isshiki Y. Kawahara K. Zähringer U. Carbohydr. Res. 1998; 313: 21-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). We show here that the trisaccharide Ara4N-Ko-Kdo is also present in the deep-rough mutant Ko2b. In addition, an unsubstituted Ko-Kdo disaccharide was found as well as minor amounts of a Kdo disaccharide. For unknown reasons the latter appears in most but not all preparations investigated and may depend upon the growth conditions. The major fraction contains two Ara4N residues in the lipid A moiety, whereas about 40% carry a third Ara4N residue located at the Ko (Fig. 5). The higher degree of substitution in the deep-rough mutant in comparison to the wild type might enhance the stability of the LPS in the absence of an outer core region and O-antigen.Attachment of Ara4N residues to the phosphate groups of lipid A leads to polymyxin resistance in a number of bacteria (72Hase S. Rietschel E.T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1977; 75: 23-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 73Farrar W.E. Von Graevenitz A. Rubin S.J. The Genus Serratia. CRC Press, Boca Raton1980: 121-138Google Scholar, 74Sidorczyk Z. Zähringer U. Rietschel E.T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 137: 15-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 75Helander I.M. Kilpelainen I. Vaara M. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 11: 481-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Recently, the enzyme responsible for the transfer of Ara4N to both phosphate groups of lipid A has been identified in S. enterica and E. coli and was termed ArnT (76Trent, M. S., Ribeiro, A. A., Lin, S., Cotter, R. J., and Raetz, C. R. (2001) J. Biol. Chem.Google Scholar). A homolog of the arnTgene could also be identified in the genome of B. cepacia; however, it remains to be elucidated whether the same transferase incorporates Ara4N also into the inner core region. Our results showed, that in B. cepacia the substitution with Ara4N always occurs at the outer sugar, mostly the Ko. In contrast, structural investigations of LPS on various serotypes of the genusProteus showed a substitution of the inner Kdo residue with Ara4N (77Holst O. Trends Glycosci. Glycotech. 2002; 14: 87-103Crossref Scopus (66) Google Scholar). It will be interesting to investigate and compare all those Ara4N transferases for the substrate specificity they need to accomplish their different tasks. It also remains to be elucidated how Ko is incorporated into the LPS. This becomes even more challenging since Ko was found to be a component of the LPS more often in a variety of bacteria (30Kawahara K. Brade H. Rietschel E.T. Zähringer U. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 163: 489-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 34Vinogradov E.V. Lindner B. Kocharova N.A. Senchenkova S.N. Shashkov A.S. Knirel Y.A. Holst O. Gremyakova T.A.

Microbiology. 1994; 140: 1261-1271Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Whether these organisms share a specific Ko transferase and a synthesis pathway to generate Ko or they possess machinery to transform Kdo into Ko will be the subject of future studies.The fact that LPS is a pathogenicity factor and might play an important role during an infection with B. cepacia led us to compare the wild type strain ATCC 25416 and the mutant Ko2b in biological test systems. First, the capacity to infect human monocyte-derived macrophages was analyzed. It turned out that the mutant showed infection rates comparable to the wild type (Table II). Thus, the truncation of the LPS does not seem to impair the organism to interact with macrophages and infect them. However, growth rates were slightly lower at 37 °C compared with the wild type. In a second set of experiments LPS preparations from both strains were tested for their ability to induce TNF-α release in human macrophages (Fig. 8). It is obvious that LPS from B. cepacia is a potent inducer of TNF-α, although the control LPS of S. enterica is approximately two orders of magnitude more active. If corrected for the mass difference between wild type and mutant Ko2b LPS, there is no significant variation in the biological activity of the LPS of both strains. Considering these results, mutant Ko2b appears to be suited for further biological testing. However, whether the introduced mutation impairs its capacity to survive in an in vivo model has to be investigated. Taxonomically, Burkholderia cepacia is a complex of eight species or genomovars (1Coenye T. Vandamme P. Govan J.R. LiPuma J.J. J. Clin. Microbiol. 2001; 39: 3427-3436Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar), which are all characterized as nutritionally versatile as well as notoriously drug-resistant (2LiPuma J.J. Clin.

Microbes Infect. 2001; 3: 425-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Strains have been described to live on penicillin G as the sole carbon source (4Beckman W. Lessie T.G. J. Bacteriol. 1979; 140: 1126-1128Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), others are able to degrade chlorinated aromatic substrates, such as the principal ingredient of the herbicide Agent Orange (5Folsom B.R. Chapman P.J. Pritchard P.H. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1990; 56: 1279-1285Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, the organism can antagonize and repress many soil-borne plant pathogens and is considered as a plant growth-promoting rhizobacterium (6Holmes A. Govan J. Goldstein R. Emerg. Infect. Dis. 1998; 4: 221-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). However, regarding the pathogenic potential of B. cepacia, there has been a controversial discussion about the use and especially the liberation of this organism for biological control and soil decontamination purposes (6Holmes A.

Rüdiger M. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 3109-3118Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Acylation of Vac8 is an essential subreaction of vacuole fusion and occurs at priming (44Veit M. Laage R. Dietrich L. Wang L. Ungermann C. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3145-3155Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Although Vac8 functions after trans-SNARE pairing (42Wang Y.X. Kauffman E.J. Duex J.E. Weisman L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35133-35140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), its acylation, a requirement for the function of Vac8, occurs already at priming. Due to its acylation Vac8 therefore connects priming and fusion.Here, we analyzed the function of the TMD of the t-SNARE Vam3. For this we replaced the TMD with a prenyl anchor and determined the consequences of the TMD alteration for fusion activity and for defined SNARE complex formation at substeps of fusion. We show that the TMD is essential for cis-SNARE complex function and for the transition from trans-SNARE complex formation to full fusion.DISCUSSIONOur data shed light on the possible function of a SNARE TMD during an authentic fusion reaction in a eukaryotic cell. Three stages of vacuole fusion are clearly affected by alterations in the TMD: the dissociation of cis-SNARE complexes during the priming step,trans-SNARE pairing, and palmitoylation of the fusion factor Vac8.cis-SNARE complexes are altered and more stable in the absence of the Vam3 TMD. This is most obvious for the interaction of Vam3-CCIIM with Vti1 and Ykt6. Addition of exogenous Sec18 is essential to obtain a low level of fusion of vacuoles containing Vam3-CCIIM. In agreement with this, increased Sec18 concentrations are also required to disassemble stable cis-SNARE complexes. Removal of the TMD of Vam3 might influence the conformation of the cytoplasmic domain and thus the interaction with Vti1 and Ykt6 (2Hanson P.I. Otto H. Barton N. Jahn R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16955-16961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 20Lewis J.L. Dong M. Earles C.A. Chapman E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15458-15465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), thereby interfering with priming. In addition, it is possible that the alteredcis-SNARE complex may lack certain factors necessary for efficient priming. We did, however, not detect reduced levels of Sec18, nor of the other SNAREs or of Sec17 (not shown). It is noteworthy that a similar priming defect is also observed on vacuoles lacking subunits of the Vtc-complex, a membrane integral protein complex that associates with V0 and with the v-SNARE Nyv1 (35Müller O. Bayer M.J. Peters C. Andersen J.S. Mann M. Mayer A. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 259-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Vacuoles fromvtc1Δ and vtc4Δ cells also require Sec18 addition to overcome their deficiency in priming and to partially rescue fusion. Vtc4 is present on CCIIM and wild-type vacuoles in equal amounts. 2J. Rohde, L. Dietrich, D. Langosch, and C. Ungermann, unpublished results. Our data therefore suggest a more tightly associated SNARE complex due to a lack of the Vam3 TMD rather than an effect caused by a lack of Vtc proteins.Vacuoles containing Vam3-CCIIM appeared intact in vivo and had a residual fusion activity of ∼20–30% in vitro. This activity may suffice in vivo to maintain vacuolar structure. Deletion of the vacuolar v-SNARE Nyv1 alone does not lead to vacuolar fragmentation (53Nichols B.J. Ungermann C. Pelham H.R. Wickner W.T. Haas A. Nature. 1997; 387: 199-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar), suggesting partial redundancy with another SNAREin vivo. However, deletion of Nyv1 in Vam3-CCIIM cells did cause a synthetic phenotype and resulted in vacuolar fragmentation. This demonstrates on the one hand that Nyv1 is involved in vacuolar fusion also in vivo. On the other hand it confirms that Vam3-CCIIM is not fully functional in vivo. It is important to note that vacuoles contain three t-SNAREs, Vti1, Vam7 and Vam3, of which Vti1 and Vam3 have TMDs. We thus show that a single SNARE TMD per t-SNARE complex is not sufficient to drive homotypic vacuole fusion.Our data confirm previous observations in several fusion systems that SNAREs depend on an intact coiled-coil domain to function in fusion (4Chen Y.A. Scheller R.H. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 98-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar). The observed fusion defect of the coiled-coil mutant in vacuole fusion as also observed by Wang et al. (52Wang Y. Dulubova I. Rizo J. Südhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28598-28605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) is a direct result of the poor assembly of trans-SNARE complexes. This straightforward explanation does not hold for the fusion defect observed with lipid-anchored Vam3. Here, trans-SNARE complexes containing Vam3-CCIIM accumulated to about 4-fold higher levels than in the corresponding wild type, although fusion between Vam3-CCIIM vacuoles was strongly reduced. We conclude that the formation of the trans complex during docking does not automatically induce fusion. trans-SNARE complexes may not be required throughout fusion. This observation is in contrast to a requirement of SNAREs to induce fusion of liposomes (5Weber T. Zemelman B.V. McNew J.A. Westermann B. Gmachl M. Parlati F. Söllner T.H. Rothman J.E. Cell. 1998; 92: 759-772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2002) Google Scholar, 6Nickel W. Weber T. McNew J.A. Parlati F. Söllner T.H. Rothman J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12571-12576Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), but agrees with findings that trans-SNARE complexes are dispensable for the transition from docking to fusion during homotypic vacuole fusion and cortical vesicle exocytosis (25Coorssen J.R. Blank P.S. Tahara M. Zimmerberg J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1845-1857Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 26Ungermann C. Sato K. Wickner W. Nature. 1998; 396: 543-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). In fact,trans-SNARE complexes form during the fusion reaction and can be detected, even if fusion is blocked by fusion inhibitors (this study; Refs. 26Ungermann C. Sato K. Wickner W. Nature. 1998; 396: 543-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar and 58Ungermann C. Wickner W. Xu Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11194-11199Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). In addition, the TMD may play a functional role downstream of docking. Previously, it was reported that SNAREs with long, but not with short, prenyl anchors induced fusion in the reconstituted proteoliposome system (21McNew J.A. Weber T. Parlati F. Johnston R.J. Melia T.J. Söllner T.H. Rothman J.E. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 105-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). This prompted the suggestion that bilayer-spanning membrane anchors of SNAREs present on both membranes stress lipid bilayers sufficiently upontrans-SNARE pairing to induce fusion (21McNew J.A. Weber T. Parlati F. Johnston R.J. Melia T.J. Söllner T.H. Rothman J.E. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 105-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). A caveat is the instability of the proteoliposomes used as they could not sequester 5-kDa oligonucleotides (21McNew J.A. Weber T. Parlati F. Johnston R.J. Melia T.J. Söllner T.H. Rothman J.E. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 105-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar); this indicated a severely disturbed bilayer structure and question the validity of this approach. It is possible that the SNARE TMD is required at the final step of membrane fusion, i.e. at the stage of actual lipid merger. Indeed, Grote et al. (23Grote E. Baba M. Ohsumi Y. Novick P.J. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 453-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) observed that replacement of the TMDs of other yeast SNAREs (Snc2p or Sso2p) by prenyl anchors also affected membrane fusion. Lysolipid addition to cells partially rescued this defect, possibly to overcome a stage of exocytosis arrested at hemifusion. Structurally, TMD-TMD interactions may drive fusion by supporting and finishing the “zippering up” of the coiled-coil domains (59Xu T. Rammner B. Margittai M. Artalejo A.R. Neher E. Jahn R. Cell. 1999; 99: 713-722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar) into the lipid bilayer itself (18Laage R. Rohde J. Brosig B. Langosch D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17481-17487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 19Margittai M. Otto H. Jahn R. FEBS Lett. 1999; 446: 40-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Alternatively, conformational flexibility of SNARE TMDs may support fusion. In fact, liposomes fuse efficiently when just TMD peptides corresponding to synaptic SNAREs or viral fusion proteins were incorporated into the bilayer (24Langosch D. Crane J.M. Brosig B. Hellwig A. Tamm L.K. Reed J. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 311: 709-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 60Langosch D. Brosig B. Pipkorn R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32016-32021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Since sequence variants displaying more stable α-helical conformations in isotropic solution were less fusogenic, fusogenicity may depend on the conformational flexibility of the α-helical SNARE TMDs in the membrane.Finally, the Vam3 TMD could be critical to direct or bind to other proteins that function after docking. In fact, several factors have been reported that act downstream of the SNAREs in yeast vacuole fusion, including the protein phosphatase 1, calmodulin, a subunit of the Vtc complex, the V0 proteolipid of the vacuolar ATPase (35Müller O.

EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3145-3155Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The level of Vac8 palmitoylation was reduced on vacuoles containing the Vam3-CCIIM mutant. The acylated Vac8 is, however, required after trans-SNARE pairing (42Wang Y.X. Kauffman E.J. Duex J.E. Weisman L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35133-35140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), possibly to coordinate proteins at the fusion site. It may thus couple priming and fusion. Even though its function is poorly understood it is clear that Vac8 function is associated with its palmitoylation state (41Wang Y.X. Catlett N.L. Weisman L.S. J.

The accumulation of trans-SNARE complexes may be associated with the reduction in palmitoylation, but cannot be the only reason, since trans-SNARE complexes did not accumulate between vacuoles lacking Vac8 entirely (42Wang Y.X.

The identification of a direct binding partner of the Vam3 TMD may be informative to fully elucidate the role of SNAREs and in particular their TMDs in fusion. Membrane fusion along the secretory pathway requires the specific interaction of SNAREs1 that are localized to vesicles and target organelles (1Rothman J.E. Nature. 1994; 372: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (1995) Google Scholar). Fusion reactions are controlled by Sec18/NSF and α-SNAP/yeast Sec17 that disassemble preexisting SNARE complexes or activate t-SNAREs (2Hanson P.I. Otto H. Barton N. Jahn R. J. Biol.

Upon docking of a vesicle with its target membrane, SNAREs from opposite membranes formtrans-SNARE complexes, which are a prerequisite for complete fusion (4Chen Y.A. Scheller R.H. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 98-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar). In vitro studies with recombinant SNAREs, reconstituted into liposomes, indicated that SNAREs can drive bilayer mixing by pairing in a cognate fashion (5Weber T. Zemelman B.V. McNew J.A.

Alterations in synaptobrevin or syntaxin TMDs in Caenorhabditis elegans cause strong neurotransmission defects (13Nonet M.L. Saifee O. Zhao H. Rand J.B. Wei L. J.

Moreover, the interaction of syntaxin 1A with synaptobrevin, but not SNAP-25, depends on the TMD of the t-SNARE (20Lewis J.L. Dong M. Earles C.A. Chapman E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15458-15465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In addition, in vitro fusion of liposomes requires anchoring of SNAREs via transmembrane domains (21McNew J.A. Weber T. Parlati F. Johnston R.J. Melia T.J. Söllner T.H. Rothman J.E. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 105-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar) and tight coupling between the coiled-coil and the TMD (22McNew J.A. Weber T. Engelman D.M. Söllner T.H. Rothman J.E. Mol.

J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 453-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Interestingly, TMD peptides alone are sufficient to drive fusion of liposomes (24Langosch D. Crane J.M. Brosig B. Hellwig A. Tamm L.K. Reed J. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 311: 709-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), suggesting that they constitute autonomous fusogenic domains. However, the evidence suggesting that SNAREs themselves may act as catalysts relies mostly on minimal systems. It does not exclude the possibility that SNAREs regulate other factors that could act as fusogens on cellular membranes or enhance SNARE-mediated fusion (25Coorssen J.R. Blank P.S. Tahara M.

In contrast to events occurring during elongation, at the initial step of transcription initiation,two substrate nucleoside triphosphate molecules must position accurately in the active site. Clearly a part of the binding energetics is derived from Watson-Crick interactions between the incoming bases and those in the template strand of DNA, but just as clearly, base pairing interactions are not sufficient to provide the binding energetics required for full function. Indeed, a single Watson-Crick base pair is unstable in solution (1Breslauer K.J. Frank R. Blocker H. Marky L.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 3746-3750Google Scholar). It is understood that for the Watson-Crick placement of theelongating nucleotide (position +2 at initiation), additional energy for binding of the nucleotide comes from interactions between its triphosphate, magnesium, and protein functional groups (2Arnold E. Ding J. Hughes S.H. Hostomsky Z. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1995; 5: 27-38Google Scholar, 3Patel P.H. Jacobo-Molina A. Ding J. Tantillo C. Clark A.D., Jr. Raag R. Nanni R.G. Hughes S.H. Arnold E.

Lavrik O.I. FEBS Lett. 1989; 259: 83-85Google Scholar). This interaction would not be expected to be important in binding the initiating (+1) nucleotide, and it has been shown in the T7 system that guanosine monophosphate and even the nucleoside guanosine have K m values comparable to or lower than that of the triphosphate GTP (6Martin C.T. Coleman J.E. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 2760-2762Google Scholar). Some additional interaction(s) must be at play. Most RNA polymerases show some preference for the initial base of the transcript. Escherichia coli RNA polymerase promoters often initiate with ATP, although some promoters begin with other NTPs at the first position in the transcript (7Reddy P.S. Chatterji D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 225: 737-745Google Scholar, 8Hawley D.K. McClure W.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 2237-2255Google Scholar). Of the 17 phage RNA polymerase promoters in the T7 genome, the canonical +1 position of 15 begins with GTP, while two promoters begin with ATP (9Dunn J.J. Studier F.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 166: 477-535Google Scholar). Recent studies have demonstrated that T7 RNA polymerase initiates poorly on promoters encoding A at position +1; transcription instead initiates predominantly with an encoded G at position +2 (10Jiang M. Rong M. Martin C. McAllister W.T. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 310: 509-522Google Scholar, 11Imburgio D. Anikin M. McAllister W.T. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 319: 37-51Google Scholar, 12Brieba L.G. Padilla R. Sousa R. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 5144-5149Google Scholar). The SP6 enzyme similarly demonstrates a 5–20-fold reduction in the level of RNA production on promoters lacking an encoded G at position +1 (13Nam S.C. Kang C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 18123-18127Google Scholar). The preference for initiation with GTP might suggest the importance of a strong Watson-Crick base pairing interaction between the substrate and the templating base (GC pairs being generally stronger than AT pairs), but the lack of promoters that initiate with CTP might suggest that this is not an important criterion. A remaining possibility is an interaction of the protein with the incoming base itself. This would explain the preference of a particular RNA polymerase for initiating with specific bases. Indeed, a recent study has implicated His-784 in contacting the 2-amino group of guanine in the minor groove (12Brieba L.G. Padilla R. Sousa R. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 5144-5149Google Scholar). In the current work, we demonstrate that the preference for GTP as the initiating nucleoside triphosphate by T7 RNA polymerase is indeed likely the result of base-specific, non-Watson-Crick interactions. We demonstrate that the N-7 and possibly O-6 positions along the major groove of guanine are specifically involved in positioning the substrate at position +1, explaining further the preference of this enzyme to initiate with GTP and consistent with a preference for a purine over a pyrimidine. T7 RNA polymerase was prepared from E. coli strain BL21 carrying the overproducing plasmid pAR1219 (kindly supplied by F. W. Studier), which contains the T7 RNA polymerase gene under inducible control of the lacUV5 promoter. The enzyme was purified, and its concentration was determined (ε280 = 1.4 × 105m−1 cm−1) as described previously (14King G.C. Martin C.T. Pham T.T. Coleman J.E. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 36-40Google Scholar). Purity of the enzyme was verified by SDS-PAGE. Oligonucleotides were synthesized by the phosphoramidite method on an Applied Biosystems Expedite 8909 DNA synthesizer. Single strands from a 1-μmol scale synthesis were purified trityl-on using an Amberchrom CG-161cd reverse phase resin (TosoHaas Inc.) as described previously (15Schick C. Martin C.T. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 4275-4280Google Scholar). Purity of the oligonucleotides was confirmed by denaturing (urea) gel electrophoresis of 5′-end-labeled single strands. Double-stranded DNA was made by heating complementary single strands to 90 °C, allowing the resulting mixture to cool to room temperature over 2 h. Steady-state assays of transcription were carried out at 37 °C in a total volume of 20 μl. The resulting mixture contained 30 mm HEPES (pH 7.8), 15 mmmagnesium acetate, 25 mm potassium glutamate, 0.25 mm EDTA, 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20 (Calbiochem, protein grade), 0.8 mm GTP or 7-deaza-GTP, 0.4 mm ATP, CTP, and UTP each, and less than 0.06 μm[α-32P]GTP, [α-32P]ATP, or [γ-32P]ATP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) as a label. Reactions also contained 0.2 μm promoter DNA, 0.2 μm T7 RNA polymerase, and 0.4 mm GMP where indicated. Reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 10 min and stopped by addition of an equal volume of 95% formamide, 20 mmEDTA (pH 7.8) gel loading buffer. The 3.0-μl aliquots were loaded onto a 7 m urea, 18% polyacrylamide sequencing gel. After electrophoresis for 2.5 h at 2000 V/50 watts, gels were dried and quantified using an Amersham Biosciences Storm 840 PhosphorImager. The percent fall-off was calculated for each band by taking the ratio of the intensity (Ii) of the band i corrected for the number of radioactive labels incorporated (Ii/ni) and dividing by the sum of corrected intensities of all the bands lengthi and longer and multiplied by 100% (Equation1). (Percent Fall­off)i=(Ii/ni)∑i∞(Ii/ni)×100%Equation 1 To properly assign all of the products, at least three parallel reactions were performed for each promoter construct. Conditions were as above, and reactions contained either [α-32P]GTP, [α-32P]ATP, or [γ-32P] ATP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for labeling purposes. For each band, the (molar) ratios of [α-32P]GTP to [α-32P]ATP and of [α-32P]ATP to [γ-32P]ATP incorporation were calculated. The bands were assigned on the basis of these ratios and the approximate length of the RNA products.

The molar concentration of RNA was calculated from the radioactivity and the number of labels expected in each RNA and represents an average of this calculation for parallel experiments with different radioactive labels. It has long been known that T7 RNA polymerase prefers to initiate with guanosine as the first base in the RNA transcript (16Oakley J.L. Coleman J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 4266-4270Google Scholar, 17Carter A.D. McAllister W.T. J. Mol. Biol. 1981; 153: 825-830Google Scholar, 18Dunn J.J. Studier F.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1981; 148: 303-330Google Scholar). Recent results have demonstrated a very strong preference for initiation with GTP (C in the template strand, resulting in a 5′ G) with a minor ability to initiate with ATP (10Jiang M. Rong M. Martin C. McAllister W.T. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 310: 509-522Google Scholar, 12Brieba L.G. Padilla R. Sousa R. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 5144-5149Google Scholar, 19Imburgio D. Rong M., Ma, K. McAllister W.T. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 10419-10430Google Scholar). It is well established that RNA polymerases, in general, face a unique challenge at initiation, positioning the priming (+1) nucleotide without the aid of stabilizing covalent and noncovalent interactions with an upstream heteroduplex. Does the polymerase specifically bind or position GTP as the incoming substrate in a manner unique to initiation? The most likely base-specific contacts with G within a GC pair lie along the Hoogsteen face (20Seeman N.C. Rosenberg J.M. Rich A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 804-808Google Scholar). To test the importance of a potential Hoogsteen contact in the RNA polymerase substrate GTP, we have carried out transcription in the presence of 7-deaza-GTP. As illustrated in Fig. 1, this analog is very similar to GTP with the exception that the nitrogen at the 7 position is replaced by a carbon (and the nitrogen lone pair is replaced by hydrogen). As shown in Fig. 2, synthesis of a five-base run-off transcript on a template encoding GGACU shows the 5-mer as the predominant product using GTP as substrate. In contrast, replacement of GTP by 7-deaza-GTP reduces synthesis of the run-off RNA product on this template by more than 7-fold (Fig. 2, compare lanes 2 and3).Figure 2Run-off synthesis on a template encoding GGACU. GTP, dzGTP, and/or GMP were present at 400 μmas indicated. All reactions contained 400 μm each of ATP, CTP, and UTP and 0.2 μm each of T7 RNA polymerase and promoter DNA. Numbers within the gel represent the amount (μm) of the transcript formed in a 15-min reaction at 37 °C. Assignment of the bands was carried out by comparing mobilities and, in parallel experiments, the ratios of incorporation of [α-32P]GTP and [α-32P]ATP for each band as demonstrated more fully in Fig. 3.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The reduction in transcription in the presence of 7-deaza-GTP could arise from a deficiency in the incorporation of this analog at either the initiating or elongating positions during initiation (or on other templates during subsequent elongation). To distinguish between these possibilities, GMP was added to the reaction. It has previously been shown that GMP can substitute for GTP at position +1, but of course, since it lacks the triphosphate, it cannot substitute at any other positions in the RNA (6Martin C.T. Coleman J.E. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 2760-2762Google Scholar). Lane 5 in Fig. 2 shows that the inclusion of GMP in the mixture completely restores normal transcription (note that due to the incorporation of a 5′-terminal monophosphate, run-off transcripts initiating with GMP migrate more slowly on the gel than normal products having a 5′-terminal triphosphate group). This result demonstrates that 7-deaza-GTP incorporates at position +2 as efficiently as GTP but is much less able to incorporate at position +1. These results suggest a role for the N-7 nitrogen of guanine in positioning and/or binding of the initiating NTP. In support of this conclusion, 7-methyl-GTP will also not substitute for GTP in transcription initiation. 1E. Esposito and C. Martin, unpublished. The N-7 nitrogen of guanine does not appear to be important in elongation synthesis, consistent with previous results that showed that a more dramatic (cyanoborane) substitution at this position is tolerated in dGTP as a substrate for various DNA polymerases (21Porter K.W. Tomasz J. Huang F. Sood A. Shaw B.R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11963-11969Google Scholar) and that 7-deaza-guanosine triphosphate can be used during preparative-scale enzymatic synthesis of RNAs more than 30 nucleotides long (22Xirasagar S. Elliott M.B. Bartolini W. Gollnick P. Gottlieb P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27146-27153Google Scholar). Conventional wisdom has been that T7 RNA polymerase prefers to initiate with G but can initiate well with A as the first base in the nascent transcript. This would suggest that the purine O-6 is not important. This view might be supported by the presence of two promoters in the T7 RNA polymerase genome that encode A at position +1 (9Dunn J.J. Studier F.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 166: 477-535Google Scholar). However, it has recently been shown that on promoters that encode an initial sequence AG … , initiation begins primarily with G at position +2 (12Brieba L.G. Padilla R. Sousa R. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 5144-5149Google Scholar,19Imburgio D. Rong M., Ma, K. McAllister W.T. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 10419-10430Google Scholar). To quantitatively probe this assertion, we have prepared an otherwise consensus promoter construct that encodes the run-off transcript AGGGA. As shown in Fig. 3,lane 1, instead of the clearly defined five-base run-off product dominating the longer products (as in lane 5), a variety of RNA products are synthesized on this template. Comparison oflanes 1–3 demonstrates that despite the encoding of A at position +1, only a minor fraction of products initiate with ATP. The molar distribution of RNA products formed in the presence of GTP and ATP is given in Table I and shows clearly that only about 13% of all RNA products initiate with A; the remainder misinitiate (at position +2) with G. This can be seen not only by comparing the amounts of run-off products but also by comparison of the amounts of the various shorter abortive products. Interestingly, as shown in lane 4 of Fig. 3 and compared quantitatively in Fig. 4, in the presence of GTP as the sole substrate, T7 RNA polymerase is capable of slippage transcription (23Martin C.T. Muller D.K. Coleman J.E. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 3966-3974Google Scholar) on the template that encodes AGGGA. Closer examination of the results reveals significant differences between slippage transcription on this alternate template and on the regular template encoding GGGAA (Fig. 3, lane 8). In particular, in slippage from the AGGGA promoter, there is a consistently higher fraction of fall-off at each step in the slippage. The increased fall-off at each step seen for the AGGGA-encoding template could arise either 1) from a decrease in the rate of forward synthesis at each step or 2) from an increase in the rate of complex dissociation. Examination of the data in lane 4 of Fig. 3 reveals that there is less RNA produced overall on template 1 (compare with template 2, lane 8 in Fig. 3). This is consistent with the first proposal that misinitiated G slippage leads to a significant reduction in the rate at which the growing RNA chain carries out forward slippage synthesis (in contrast, increased dissociation would lead to higher turnover and larger amounts of RNA). To provide better insight into the effect that 7-deaza-GTP has on the kinetics of initiation, we attempted to measure the K m for 7-deaza-GTP at the initiating (+1) position by using a DNA promoter construct encoding the run-off 4-mer GACU (6Martin C.T. Coleman J.E. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 2760-2762Google Scholar). Analysis of the results presented in Fig. 5 turned out to be less than straightforward. As expected, at very low concentrations of 7-deaza-GTP, misinitiation with ATP (at position +2) predominates, but substantial misinitiation occurs even at high concentrations of 7-deaza-GTP. In addition, extension of the misinitiated products is less efficient as predicted above. As shown in Fig. 5 (and in Fig. 6 B), at higher concentrations of 7-deaza-GTP, RNA synthesis (both short and full length) actually decreases rather than leveling off as might be expected. This makes the use of a simple binding equation impossible.Figure 6A, determination ofK m for ATP in the synthesis of the dinucleotide pppApC. B, 7-deaza-GTP concentration dependence of transcription from the promoter construct encoding GACU showing products pppApC (open circles) and all products (filled diamonds). Each reaction was run for 10 min at 37 °C. The smooth line represents the best fit to the competitive inhibition model (Equation 2) in which theK i of 750 ± 70 μm for 7-deaza-GTP represents its ability to competitively inhibit misinitiation at position +2.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) In this context, correct initiation with 7-deaza-GTP competes directly with misinitiation at position +2 (which produces pppApC). Therefore, if the KmATPfor misinitiation is known, we can use a competitive inhibition model to assess the inhibition constant for 7-deaza-GTP and thereby estimate the strength of its binding at the +1 position. To determine the KmATP for misinitiation on this template (in the absence of GTP or its analog), a reaction was carried out measuring initial rates of RNA synthesis as a function of increasing concentrations of ATP. The reaction mixture was identical to the one described above except that it contained 0.4 mmCTP, 0.4 mm UTP, and 10–4000 μm ATP (but no GTP or its analogs). The resulting data, presented in Fig. 6 A, were fit to the simple Michaelis-Menten equation (Equation 2),v=[ATP]KmATP+[ATP]VmaxEquation 2 yielding a value for KmATPof 930 ± 50 μm. This value can next be used to fit the data for production of pppApC in Fig. 5 according to the following equation (24Segel I.H. Enzyme Kinetics: Behavior and Analysis of Rapid Equilibrium and Steady State Enzyme Systems. Wiley, New York1975Google Scholar).v=[ATP]KmATP1+[dzGTP]KidzGTP+[ATP]VmaxEquation 3 The best fit of the data, shown in Fig. 6 B, yields a value of KidzGTP = 750 ± 70 μm. Interestingly, this value is not substantially different from the K m of 600 μm determined for initiation with native GTP on the same promoter construct (6Martin C.T. Coleman J.E. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 2760-2762Google Scholar), suggesting that the discrimination at position +1 between native GTP and its analog 7-deaza-GTP (dzGTP)2 occurs not through a difference in the strength of the binding of the nucleoside triphosphate but rather via effects on some kinetic step following the binding. Clearly, additional studies are required to determine the exact nature of the mechanistic effect. A critical function of an RNA polymerase is the selection of the position of the transcription start site. From previous studies, it is apparent that a significant part of the energetics stabilizing the initially transcribing complex comes from protein interactions with the upstream duplex region of the promoter (25Újvári A. Martin C.T. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 775-781Google Scholar). Following the separation of the DNA strands (melting), an RNA polymerase must position the first two NTPs in the active site. It seems certain that productive positioning of the first two NTPs in the normally functioning initially transcribing complex occurs a minimal distance from the upstream duplex with this distance determined by the distance along the protein between the tight binding region and the enzyme phosphoryl transfer site (10Jiang M. Rong M. Martin C. McAllister W.T. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 310: 509-522Google Scholar). Initiation occurs primarily at the 5th and 6th residues downstream of the duplex binding region (19Imburgio D. Rong M., Ma, K. McAllister W.T. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 10419-10430Google Scholar) (and with limited efficiency at the 4th position (13Nam S.C. Kang C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 18123-18127Google Scholar) 3I. Kuzmine and C. Martin, unpublished. ). The enzyme imposes a relatively strict minimal distance, but not a sharp maximal distance, as very large non-nucleosidic linkages still allow initiation at now very “distant” templating bases (26Weston B.F. Kuzmine I. Martin C.T. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 272: 21-30Google Scholar). This accounts for the occurrence of downstream misinitiation when the +1 templating base is a poor initiator either because it does not encode G or because it does not have the optimal environment (e.g. lacking a base 3′ of itself). 4I. Kuzmine, E. Esposito, and C. Martin, unpublished. Within the part of the DNA where initiation could occur, the choice of initiation seems to be dependent on the preference of T7 RNA polymerase for a particular initiating nucleotide. It is apparent that this preference is not dominated simply by the strength of the Watson-Crick interactions with the complementary base since mutation of the promoter to encode a C at this position leads to a substantial reduction in activity (19Imburgio D. Rong M., Ma, K. McAllister W.T. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 10419-10430Google Scholar). Indeed, only by using high concentrations of CMP and keeping concentrations of all other nucleotides well below the K m value for the initiating nucleotide has it been possible to produce substantial amounts of transcripts initiating with C (27Helm M. Brule H. Giege R. Florentz C. RNA. 1999; 5: 618-621Google Scholar). A recent study has implicated the 2-amino group of guanine in such stabilization (12Brieba L.G. Padilla R. Sousa R. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 5144-5149Google Scholar). As the current results show, GTP is preferred over ATP and dzGTP. The latter result implicates the involvement of a major groove contact. Replacement of nitrogen by CH at position 7 is not expected to substantially reduce the strength of the Watson-Crick base pairing, and although 7-deaza-guanine has been reported to have a lower dipole moment than guanine (3.0 versus 8.0) it is oriented in the same direction and seems unlikely to change the geometry of the stacking of the initiating nucleotides (28Seela F. Tran-Thi Q.H. Franzen D. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 4338-4343Google Scholar). The most likely explanation for the preference of the system for initiating with G, and to a lesser extent with A, is the existence of protein contacts with the Hoogsteen side of the initiating nucleotide. Correct positioning of the nucleotide in the active site is likely to involve major groove interactions with both the N-7 and O-6 of the guanine base. ATP and dzGTP each retain only a part of this interaction (N-7 or O-6, respectively) and so are disfavored compared with GTP. Since the stability of a single base pair is likely insufficient to provide the energetics necessary for correct positioning of substrate, it is easy to imagine how an RNA polymerase would have evolved to provide additional stabilization for binding and positioning of the initiating nucleotide. Note that DNA polymerases, or RNA polymerases during elongation, do not need this type of interaction because the equivalent “initiating” nucleotide is covalently linked to the growing RNA or DNA primer and enjoys additional stabilization through base stacking with its covalently linked 5′ neighbor. The problem is unique to de novoinitiation. These results suggest major groove interactions with both the N-7 and O-6 groups of guanine. Among the amino acids, the most likely candidate for simultaneous interaction with both the guanine N-7 and O-6 functional groups is arginine (see, for example, Ref. 29Jamieson A.C. Wang H. Kim S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12834-12839Google Scholar). The available crystal structures of T7 RNA polymerase do not allow precise prediction of the Arg in question; however, there are at least two possible candidates: amino acids 425 and 632. These possess a Cα that is less than 13 Å (the approximate length of an extended Arg side chain) from the N-7 of the equivalent G (number 3) in the crystal structure of the ternary complex (Protein Data Bank code 1QLN). The effect of such stabilization is highlighted by the ability of T7 RNA polymerase to make dinucleotide RNA product on any long stretch of DNA that has GG or GA encoded in the sequence (3′-CC-5′ or 3′-CT-5′ in the template), although in the absence of the promoter these products are not extended well (30Sousa R. Patra D. Lafer E.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 224: 319-334Google Scholar,31Chamberlin M. Ring J. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 2235-2244Google Scholar). 5A. Újvári and C. Martin, unpublished. These findings also allow us to speculate on the reason why most of the phage T7 promoters start with the encoding of three G residues at the beginning of the transcribed RNA sequence. In this case, the dinucleotide product formed as the result of misinitiation at position +2 is identical to the product of correct initiation. Since positionally misinitiated products are elongated less efficiently, the dinucleotide is released and can then be reused by priming at the correct position (32Kuzmine I. Martin C.T. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 305: 559-566Google Scholar)."
https://openalex.org/W2049024383,"A comparison between two pituitary-derived cell lines (αT3-1 and LβT2) that represent gonadotropes at early and late stages of development, respectively, was performed to further elucidate the genomic repertoire required for gonadotrope specification and luteinizing hormone β (LHβ) gene expression. One isolated clone that displayed higher expression levels in LβT2 cells encodes p8, a high mobility group-like protein with mitogenic potential that is up-regulated in response to proapoptotic stimuli and in some developing tissues. To test the functional significance of this factor in developing gonadotropes, a knockdown of p8 in LβT2 cells was generated. The loss of p8 mRNA correlated with loss of endogenous LHβ mRNA and the loss of activity of a transfected LHβ promoter-driven reporter, even upon treatment with gonadotropin-releasing hormone. In addition, expression of p8 mRNA in developing mouse pituitary glands mirrored its expression in the gonadotrope-derived cell lines and coincided with the first detectable appearance of LHβ mRNA. In contrast, p8 mRNA was undetectable in the pituitary glands of normal adults. Taken together, our data indicate that p8 is a stage-specific component of the gonadotrope transcriptome that may play a functional role in the initiation of LHβ gene expression during embryonic cellular differentiation.

Parsons T.F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1981; 50: 465-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (1911) Google Scholar, 2Gharib S.D. Wierman M.E. Shupnik M.A. Chin W.W. Endocr. Rev. 1990; 11: 177-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar). Luteinizing hormone is a heterodimeric protein composed of an α glycoprotein hormone subunit (αGSU) common to all members of the glycoprotein family of hormones that is non-covalently linked to a unique LHβ subunit that confers its biological specificity (1Pierce J.G. Parsons T.F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1981; 50: 465-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (1911) Google Scholar, 2Gharib S.D. Wierman M.E. Shupnik M.A. Chin W.W. Endocr. Rev. 1990; 11: 177-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar). Biosynthesis of LH depends on the coordinated expression of both the αGSU and LHβ subunit genes. In humans, the single copy αGSU gene resides on chromosome 6q12-q21 (Locus ID 1081) while the LHβ gene resides amid a cluster of six chorionic gonadotropin-β genes on chromosome 19q13.32 (Locus ID 1082). In addition to their different locations within the human genome, the pattern of expression of the genes encoding αGSU and LHβ are temporally and spatially distinct. During development αGSU is seen throughout Rathke's pouch as early as embryonic day (e) 9.5 in the mouse (3Kendall S.K. Gordon D.F. Birkmeier T.S. Petrey D. Sarapura V.D. O'Shea K.S. Wood W.M. Lloyd R.V. Ridgway E.C. Camper S.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 1420-1433PubMed Google Scholar). By later stages of pituitary development and in adult mammals, αGSU expression is limited to thyrotropes and gonadotropes (4Fiddes J.C. Goodman H.M. J. Mol. Appl. Genet. 1981; 1: 3-18PubMed Google Scholar). Gonadotrope-specific expression of the αGSU gene is controlled by an array of regulatory elements, including the pituitary glycoprotein hormone basal element (5Roberson M.S. Schoderbek W.E. Tremml G.

In a fashion similar to the αGSU promoter, the LHβ gene is regulated by a combinatorial array of transcription factors and regulatory elements. In this case, however, the elements consist of those that bind early growth response 1 (Egr1) (11Halvorson L.M. Ito M. Jameson J.L. Chin W.W. J. Biol.

Unlike αGSU, which is a marker of early pituitary development, expression of the LHβ gene is one of the last steps that defines a mature gonadotrope. As indicated above, many of the elements and proteins involved in regulation of LHβ gene expression and terminal differentiation of gonadotropes have been characterized; however, the full scope of factors required for differentiation to a mature cell that expresses all phenotypic markers of a gonadotrope, including LHβ, have yet to be identified. To that end, we compared the gene expression of cell lines that represent two distinct stages of gonadotrope development by differential display. αT3-1 cells represent early gonadotrope progenitors that express αGSU and gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) receptor but not the unique β-subunits of the glycoprotein hormones (28Windle J.J. Weiner R.I. Mellon P.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1990; 4: 597-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). The LβT2 cell line is characterized by expression of markers of fully differentiated gonadotropes, including the β-subunits of the gonadotropins (29Turgeon J.L. Kimura Y. Waring D.W. Mellon P.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 439-450Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30Graham K.E. Nusser K.D. Low M.J. J. Endocrinol. 1999; 162: R1-R5Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Because these two cell lines represent phenotypic gonadotropes at embryonic days before (αT3-1) or after (LβT2) the ability to express LHβ, characterization of differentially expressed factors may uncover components that are essential for expression of the LHβ subunit gene and should refine our understanding of gonadotrope differentiation. One factor that is more highly expressed in LβT2 cells than αT3-1 cells is the HMG-like nuclear phosphoprotein known as p8 or candidate of metastasis 1 (com1). The HMG class of proteins to which p8 is related (HMG-I/Y or HMGA) function as architectural transcription factors that promote gene activation by relieving histone H1-mediated repression of transcription (31Wood L.J. Mukherjee M. Dolde C.E., Xu, Y. Maher J.F. Bunton T.E. Williams J.B. Resar L.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5490-5502Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) and facilitating the formation of enhanceosomes as a consequence of both protein/DNA and protein/protein interactions (32Reeves R. Beckerbauer L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1519: 13-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Like p8, these proteins, which have the capacity to bend, straighten, unwind, and induce loop or supercoil formation in linear DNA molecules in vitro, are at maximal levels of expression during embryonic development and in rapidly proliferating cells (32Reeves R. Beckerbauer L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1519: 13-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). While p8 lacks characteristic “A-T hook” DNA binding domains found in the HMGA class of non-histone chromatin-binding proteins (32Reeves R. Beckerbauer L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1519: 13-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar, 33Bustin M. Reeves R. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1996; 54: 35-100Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), it does appear to bind DNA, especially upon phosphorylation (34Encinar J.A. Mallo G.V. Mizyrycki C. Giono L. Gonzalez-Ros J.M. Rico M. Canepa E. Moreno S. Neira J.L. Iovanna J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2742-2751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), and thus, p8 may perform a comparable role within cells. In the gonadotrope, p8 appears to be a stage-specific component of the cellular transcriptome that may play a functional role in the initiation of LHβ gene expression. This potential is explored herein. Total RNA was extracted from confluent αT3-1 and LβT2 cells using the method of Chomczynski and Sacchi (35Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar). Removal of chromosomal DNA contamination from samples, PCR differential display, and reamplification of DNA were performed as described in the Current Protocols in Molecular Biology (36Liang P. Pardee A.B. Science. 1992; 257: 967-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (4707) Google Scholar). Each assay was performed using one of four degenerate anchored oligo(dT) primer sets (T12MN; M can be G, A, or C and N is G, A, T, and C) where each primer set is dictated by the 3′ base (N) with degeneracy in the penultimate (M) position by itself or each in combination with one of 26 decameric primers that were originally designed to allow for coverage of the expressed genome (37Bauer D. Muller H. Reich J. Riedel H. Ahrenkiel V. Warthoe P. Strauss M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 4272-4280Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar). Clones of interest were subcloned into the pCR®II-TOPO® vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) using the standard protocol described by the manufacturer. The DNA sequence of each clone was found by dideoxynucleotide sequencing using Sp6 and/or T7 primers. Identification of clones was determined by comparing each sequence against the BLAST database (38Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol.

J. 1999; 343: 377-383Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To produce the p8-antisense vector (p8AS-pcDNA3), p8-pcDNA3 was digested with BamHI and ApaI restriction endonucleases. The p8 insert was then blunt-ended and ligated into theEcoRV site of pcDNA3. Clones were dideoxynucleotide sequenced to verify selection of a reverse orientation clone. The LHβ promoter-driven luciferase reporter vector (23Quirk C.C. Lozada K.L. Keri R.A. Nilson J.H. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 734-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) as well as the αGSU promoter-driven luciferase reporter vector (6Heckert L.L. Schultz K. Nilson J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26497-26504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) have been described previously. The gonadotrope-derived cell lines, αT3-1 and LβT2, were maintained in high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 2 mm l-glutamine and supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics (complete medium). To produce the control (C)-LβT2, p8-knockdown (KD)-LβT2, and p8-overexpressing (OE)-LβT2 cell lines, 24 × 106 LβT2 cells on a 100-mm culture dish were transfected with 16 μg of pcDNA3, p8AS-pcDNA3, and p8-pcDNA3, respectively, using 80 μl of LipofectAMINE reagent (Invitrogen) and medium lacking serum and antibiotics. Stably transfected cells were selected by introducing 500 μg/ml G418 (Invitrogen) into the complete medium 3 days following the transfection. The cells utilized in these studies, which were maintained in the above-described complete medium supplemented with G418, represent pools of clones for each cell line derived from the parent LβT2 line. The day prior to transient transfection, C-LβT2 and p8-KD-LβT2 cells were plated at a density of ∼2 × 106 cells/35-mm well. Transfections were carried out using medium lacking serum, antibiotics, and G418 selection medium with 10 μl of LipofectAMINE reagent, 2 μg each test vector, and 100 ng of pRL-CMV (Promega, Madison, WI), which was used to normalize data for transfection efficiency. Cell cultures were incubated with the transfection mixtures for ∼18 h at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2. Complete medium was then added to the cells, which where indicated, were also supplemented with 100 nm GnRH. Twenty-four hours following the addition of fresh medium and hormonal treatments, cells were lysed in passive lysis buffer (Promega) and a dual-luciferase assay was performed on each cellular lysate as per standard procedures (Promega). Transient transfections were performed a minimum of three times with at least two separate plasmid preparations for each construct that was tested. For each Northern blot, 10 or 20 μg of total RNA were separated by electrophoresis in a 1% denaturing agarose gel and transferred to nylon membrane (Hybond-N+;Amersham Biosciences) by gravity and capillary action. After UV cross-linking to fix RNA to the nylon, the membrane was prehybridized for approximately 3 h and hybridized with the appropriate radiolabeled probe overnight at 45 °C in a roller-bottle hybridization oven (Techne, Inc., Princeton, NJ). The hybridization solution consisted of 40% deionized formamide, 20 mmPIPES, 800 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 4% SDS, 80 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA. All probes were made by radiolabeling of cDNAs with [32P]deoxy-CTP or ATP (3000 Ci/mmol, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) using DECAprime II kit as per the suggestions of the manufacturer (Ambion, Austin, TX). The final washes following hybridization were in 0.5× SSC, 0.5% SDS at 65 °C. The membranes were exposed to Biomax MR film (Eastman Kodak Co., Rochester, NY) for one or more days at −80 °C. In addition, some blots were exposed to storage phosphor screens (Amersham Biosciences) for 2–18 h followed by densitometric scanning and analysis using a Storm 820 PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). Between hybridizations, each blot was stripped of radioactivity using the protocol enclosed with the nylon membrane. Northern blots were replicated at least three times, and densitometric scanning was performed on representative blots. Random-prime labeled probes used in the Northern blot analyses consisted of the full murine p8 cDNA (39Vasseur S. Mallo G.V. Garcia-Montero A. Ortiz E.M. Fiedler F. Canepa E. Moreno S. Iovanna J.L. Biochem. J. 1999; 343: 377-383Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), murine LHβ cDNA representing bases 35 through 213 (40Kumar T.R. Matzuk M.M. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 166: 335-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), murine cytoskeletal β-actin cDNA representing bases 1210 through 1657 (41Tokunaga K. Taniguchi H. Yoda K. Shimizu M. Sakiyama S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 2829Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar), a murine GnRH receptor cDNA representing bases 247 through 537 (42Tsutsumi M. Zhou W. Millar R.P. Mellon P.L. Roberts J.L. Flanagan C.A. Dong K. Gillo B. Sealfon S.C. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 1163-1169Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar), and a cDNA encompassing the murine 18 S rRNA contained within primers included in the QuantumRNA 18 S Internal Standards (Ambion). In all cases a very small amount of flanking DNA from the multiple cloning sites of each vector was included when making probes. Timed pregnancies were obtained by mating CF1 or FVB/N male × CF1 female. Noon on the day of copulatory plug detection was considered e0.5. Appropriately aged embryos were frozen in 2-methylbutane at approximately −30 °C and sectioned at 15 μm on a Hacker-Bright cryostat (Hacker Instruments and Industries, Fairfield, NJ). In situ hybridization was performed as described by Cushman et al. (43Cushman L.J. Burrows H.L. Seasholtz A.F. Lewandoski M. Muzyczka N. Camper S.A. Genesis. 2000; 28: 167-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Briefly, sections were warmed to room temperature for 30 min and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde/phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at 37 °C. Following proteinase K treatment (0.1 μg/ml), sections were fixed again in 4% paraformaldehyde/PBS and washed in PBS. Sections were acetylated using a 0.1 m triethanolamine, 0.25% acetic anhydride mixture and incubated with hybridization solution minus the probe (50% formamide, 5× SSC, 2% Boehringer blocking powder, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.5% CHAPS, 1 mg/ml yeast tRNA, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mg/ml heparin in diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated water) at 55 °C. Riboprobe was diluted in hybridization solution and allowed to hybridize overnight at 55 °C in a chamber humidified with 5× SSC. The next morning, sections were washed in a 50% formamide, 0.5× SSC mixture at 55 °C followed by a wash in 0.5× SSC at room temperature and blocked with the following solution in a chamber humidified with water: 10% heat-inactivated sheep serum; 2% BSA; 0.02% sodium azide in 50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100. Anti-digoxigenin Fab fragments (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) were diluted 1:1000 in blocking buffer, incubated on sections for 1 h at room temperature in a humidified chamber and washed in PBS. After equilibration in several washes of chromagen buffer (100 mm Tris-Cl (pH 9.5), 100 mm NaCl, 50 mm MgCl2), sections were developed overnight in the chromagen buffer with 4.5 μl/ml 4-nitro blue tetrazolium chloride and 3.5 μl/ml 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-phosphate added as substrate for alkaline phosphatase activity. Sections were rinsed with PBS, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde/PBS, washed, and mounted. In situ hybridization was repeated at least two times for each embryonic age. Plasmids were linearized as follows to generate sense and antisense probes: 435-bp αGSU cDNA (GenBankTM accession number NM0099889, bp numbers 181 through 616 of αGSU) in pGEM3ZF+ was linearized with BamHI for antisense and HindIII for sense probes; 233-bp LHβ cDNA (GenBankTMaccession number NM_008497, bp numbers 12 through 245) in BSK− was linearized with HindIII for antisense and BamHI for sense probes; and full murine p8 cDNA in pcDNA3 was linearized with EcoRI for antisense andApaI for sense probes. Digoxigenin-labeled riboprobe was generated with in vitro transcription using 10× DIG RNA labeling mix (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and purified with the RNeasy minikit (Qiagen). All animal studies were conducted in accordance with the principles and procedures approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Case Western Reserve University. To identify factors that may be essential for maturation of gonadotropes, differential display was employed to compare the mRNA populations from gonadotrope-derived cells that represent distinct developmental stages, namely αT3-1 and LβT2. Because over 300 differentially expressed cDNAs were isolated using this method, reverse Northern blots were performed to verify the expression seen by differential display (data not shown). After reamplification and nucleotide sequencing of several clones, we focused our attention on clone 100 (Fig. 1 A), which was identified as the 3′-untranslated region of p8 using the BLAST database available through the National Center for Biotechnology Information (38Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (71436) Google Scholar). p8 shows both sequence and structural similarities with factors that have proven vital for embryonic development (34Encinar J.A. Mallo G.V. Mizyrycki C. Giono L. Gonzalez-Ros J.M. Rico M. Canepa E. Moreno S. Neira J.L. Iovanna J.L. J. Biol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 32360-32369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). To confirm the differential expression of p8 in αT3-1 and LβT2 cells, we examined total RNA from each cell line by Northern blot analysis and found that mRNA encoding p8 was significantly up-regulated in LβT2 compared with αT3-1 cells (Fig. 1, B andC). To determine the functional significance of p8 mRNA, a plasmid vector driving expression of p8-antisense was used to stably transfect LβT2 cells (p8-KD-LβT2). We anticipated that this aberrant message would form double-stranded RNA with the endogenous p8 transcript and either inhibit its translation or target it for degradation, thus allowing for sequence-specific, post-transcriptional silencing of the p8 gene. Our data support the latter possibility as no detectable levels of p8 mRNA were observed in p8-KD-LβT2 cells (Fig. 2). In contrast, in LβT2 cells that were stably transfected with a plasmid encoding the sense strand of p8 (p8-OE-LβT2), a 579-nucleotide p8 mRNA representing the transcription product from the transfected vector was identified. Importantly, endogenous p8 transcript (639 nucleotides) was detected in total RNA from untransfected LβT2 cells as well as cells that have been stably transfected with the empty, negative control vector (C-LβT2). Thus, stable transfection of the p8 antisense vector effectively removed p8 mRNA from LβT2 cells. It is known that double-stranded RNA in the cytoplasm of mammalian cells can trigger profound effects, including a global suppression of translation and mRNA degradation in a sequence-nonspecific manner as part of an interferon response (45Elbashir S.M. Harborth J. Lendeckel W. Yalcin A. Weber K. Tuschl T. Nature. 2001; 411: 494-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (8185) Google Scholar), as well as apoptosis (46Zamore P.D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 746-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). To provide evidence that the loss of endogenous p8 was due to sequence-specific rather than nonspecific gene silencing, Northern blot hybridization with a radiolabeled β-actin probe was performed (Fig. 2). Levels of detectable β-actin mRNA were comparable across RNA samples from p8-KD-LβT2 cells, p8-OE-LβT2 cells, as well as C-LβT2 and normal, untransfected LβT2s, indicating that the product of this architectural gene, and likely other transcripts, was not affected by the presence of double-stranded RNA in the p8 knockdown cell line. Expression of the p8 gene appears to follow a pattern that corresponds to LHβ expression in gonadotrope-derived cell lines. To determine the potential impact of p8 on regulation of the LHβ gene, p8-KD-LβT2 and C-LβT2 cells were tested for their ability to support activity of a LHβ promoter-driven luciferase reporter after transient transfection. As expected, the C-LβT2 cell line displayed levels of luciferase activity ∼4-fold higher than that from cell lines transfected with a promoterless reporter vector (Fig. 3 A), levels that are comparable with normal LβT2 cells (data not shown). In cells lacking p8 (p8-KD-LβT2), the LHβ promoter was non-functional, even in the presence of 100 nm GnRH (Fig. 3 B). To confirm that the effect of p8 knockdown on the LHβ promoter was not due to an overall hindrance of cellular processes, an αGSU promoter-driven construct was also tested. This vector was shown to be functional in p8-KD-LβT2 cells as well as C-LβT2 cells. Thus, p8 appears to be crucial for expression of LHβ in LβT2 cells. However, overexpression of p8 does not allow for activation of LHβ-driven luciferase expression in heterologous cells (COS7 and αT3-1 cells) or enhanced activation in homologous cells (LβT2 cells) (data not shown). While there are many potential explanations for the lack of an increase in LHβ gene expression upon overexpression of p8, the simplest may be that endogenous p8 in LβT2 cells may already be exerting a maximal effect on the LHβ gene. In the heterologous cells it is possible that other factors vital to the impact of p8 on LHβ promoter activity may be absent. In other words, p8 may be necessary but not sufficient for expression of the LHβ gene, and the mechanism by which p8 regulates LHβ gene expression may be very complex and/or quite indirect. To determine the importance of p8 on activation of endogenous genes in gonadotrope-derived cells, we extended our investigation to include Northern blot analysis of the LHβ gene. As shown in Fig. 4, there is a lack of LHβ gene expression in cells that stably express the p8 antisense strand (p8-KD-LβT2). In contrast, low levels of LHβ gene expression were detected in normal, untreated LβT2 cells, C-LβT2 cells and p8-OE-LβT2 cells. To further characterize the impact of p8 removal on LHβ activity, the various LβT2 cell lines were treated with 100 nm GnRH for 6 h prior to harvest and collection of RNA for analysis by Northern blot. While this treatment paradigm increased LHβ gene expression in normal LβT2, C-LβT2, and p8-OE-LβT2 cells, it could not rescue expression of LHβ in the p8-KD-LβT2 cells. This provides further functional evidence f"

Propionibacteria are thought to be actinomycete-like microorganisms and may still cause diagnostic difficulties. The chloroform-methanol extracts of the cell mass ofP. propionicum (type strain) gave in TLC analysis the characteristic glycolipid profile containing four major glycolipids, labeled G1 through G4. These polar lipids were found to be useful chemotaxonomic markers to differentiate P. propionicum from other cutaneous propionibacteria, in particular from strains of the acnes group. Glycolipids G1–G4 were isolated and purified using gel-permeation chromatography, TLC, and high performance liquid chromatography, and their structures were elucidated by compositional and methylation analyses, specific chemical degradations, MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry, and 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectroscopy, including HMBC, TOCSY, HMQC, and NOESY experiments. Glycolipids G2 and G3 possess as backbone α-d-Glcp-(1 → 3)-α-d-Glcp-(1 → 1)-Gro (Gro, glycerol), in which position O-2 of the glycerol residue is acylated by a fatty acid (mainly C15:0) while O-3 is substituted by an alkyl ether chain. In glycolipid G3, an additional fatty acyl chain was linked to O-6 of the terminal glucose residue. Glycolipid G4 was structurally related to G2 but devoid of one glucose residue. Glycolipid G1 was isolated in small amounts, and its structure was therefore deduced from MALDI-TOF-MS experiments alone, which revealed that it possessed the structure of G2 but was lacking one fatty acid residue. In studies on the biological properties of P. propionicum glycolipids, the anti-P. propionicumrabbit antisera reacted in dot enzyme-immunoblotting test with G2 and G3.

Generally, on the basis of their habitat, members of the genus are divided into two groups (1Cummins C.S. Johnson J.L. Balows A. Trüper H.G. Dworkin M. Harder W. Schleifer K.H. The Prokaryotes. Springer-Verlag, New York1992: 834-849Google Scholar). So-called classic propionibacteria are not pathogenic and, likePropionibacterium freudenreichii, P. thoenii,P. jensenii, P. acidipropionici, and P. cyclohexanicum originate mainly from dairy products like cheese, milk products, fermented olives, or orange juice but have also been isolated from soil, silage, or other organic matter of natural environments. The second group, the so-called skin or cutaneous propionibacteria, or acnes group, is considered to consist of pathogenic strains, including species like P. acnes,P. avidum, P. granulosum, P. lymphophilum, P. propionicum, and P. innocum. They belong to the endo- and exogenous bacterial flora of human mucosa and skin and are among the indigenous oral flora and intestinal tract, occurring sometimes as opportunistic pathogens. Also, they are found in cervicovaginal secretions of healthy women as well as in secretions of uninfected conjunctiva and cornea. Besides the typical skin sickness, such as acne vulgaris or actinomycosis-like diseases caused by P. acnes or P. propionicum, respectively (2Nishijima S.A. Kurokawa I.A. Katoh N.A. Watanabe K. J. Dermatol. 2000; 27: 318-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 3Riley T.V. Ott A.K. Br. Med.

Most of them can be dangerous for high risk patients suffering from serious devastating illnesses, including tumors, tuberculosis, AIDS, organ and tissue transplantation, or foreign body implantation joining to deeply immunosuppression. Interestingly, some of these bacteria were used recently as immunostimulators, serving a protective role against virus, parasite, and bacterial infections or as antitumor adjuvants. Diagnostic difficulties are caused by specific nutritional conditions, microaerophilic preferences, and prolonged time of incubation for cultivation as well as polymorphic growth, which causes a different Gram staining. The classic as well as the opportunistic propionibacteria may still cause confusion not only in taxonomy but also in microbiological and clinical diagnoses. Thus, alternative techniques for the differentiation of the species are still needed. The modern era of microorganism systematics, proposed forActinobacteria classis novum, includingPropionibacterium (11Stackebrandt E. Rainey F.A. Ward-Rainey N.L. Int. J. Syst. Bacteriol. 1997; 47: 479-491Crossref Scopus (1327) Google Scholar), has been based on a so-called polyphasic strategy. Its origin has three dominant sources: first, the establishment of chemotaxonomy, i.e. structural constituents such as peptydoglycan, fatty acids, polar lipids, isoprenoid chinones, cytochromes, and the base composition of DNA (12Schleifer K.H.

Stackebrandt E. Methods Microbiol. 1987; 19: 405-458Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar), including PCR (18Templeton N.S. Diagn. Mol. Pathol. 1992; 1: 58-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) and/or PCR/restriction fragment length polymorphism, which has rarely been used so far for the identification of the classic and skin propionibacteria (19Riedel K.H.

It is worth emphasizing that a clear correlation exists between the chemotaxonomic and genotaxonomic characteristics of microorganisms, especially with regard to their lipid composition, mainly for the polar lipids and 16 S rRNA-DNA hybridization homology groups (21Tornabene T.G. Methods Microbiol. 1985; 18: 209-234Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 22Ross H.N.M. Grant W.D. Harris J.E. Goodfellow M. Minnikin D.E. Chemical Methods in Bacterial Systematics.

Therefore, some major glycolipids appear to be useful for the rapid recognition of bacterial isolates at the genus or species level (23Chatterjee D. Aspinall G.O. Brennan P.J. J. Biol.

However, owing to the production of propionic acid, the presence of ll-diaminopimelic acid and glycine in its peptidoglycan, this species was included in another taxon,i.e. Arachnia propionica. Then, further studies revealed metabolic and genetic relationships withPropionibacterium, which resulted in its reclassification toP. propionicum. The studied strain belonged to serotype 1 and was isolated from an advanced periodontal lesion. The identification of these bacteria by applying molecular biological techniques is questionable because of the coexistence of numerous endogenous bacterial floras. The analysis of the glycolipid profile is a promising method of choice for the identification of these bacteria and the diagnosis of infections caused by them. This work describes a study of the structures and biological properties of glycolipids isolated from P. propionicum. Structurally uncommon polar glycolipids, which occur in P. propionicum, are of taxonomic value and allow us to distinguish this taxon from other propionibacteria as well as from all microaerophilic actinobacteria (25Mordarska H. Paściak M. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1994; 123: 325-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 29Paściak M. Glycolipid markers of Propionibacterium propionicum, Ph.D. thesis. L.

The characteristic glycolipid profile ofP. propionicum contains four major glycolipids possessing novel structures, which, together with their biological properties, are reported here. The object of this investigation was the type strain P. propionicum PCM 2431 (ATCC 14157T). Other strains were also used in comparative experiments, namely P. acidipropionici PCM 2434 (NBIMCC 1371), P. acnes PCM 2400T (ATCC 6919T), P. avidum PCM 2467 (CIP 103261T, ATCC 25577), P. freudenreichii PCM 2435 (NBIMCC 1207T, ATCC 9614), and P. granulosum PCM 2462 (ATCC 25564T). Bacteria were cultivated anaerobically in an atmosphere containing CO2 (4–10%) in flasks with thioglycollate broth (Difco)/trypticase soy broth (BioMerieux) (1:1, v/v) at 37 °C for 5–7 days. The cultures were checked for purity then heat-killed, harvested by centrifugation, and washed with saline. Samples (4 μl from 50 mg/ml solutions) were applied to pre-coated TLC plates (Silica Gel 60, Merck) and developed using solvent system I (chloroform-methanol-water, 65:25:4, v/v). In the case of two-dimensional TLC, solvent system I was used in the first dimension and chloroform-acetic acid-methanol-water (80:15:12:4, v/v, solvent system II) was used in the second. Also, solvent system I was applied in the first dimension, and then chloroform-acetone-methanol-water (50:60:2.5:3, v/v, solvent system III) was applied in the second dimension. Several specific spray reagents were used to develop the chromatograms, namely vanillin, orcinol, ninhydrin, and Dittmer and Lester reagent (25Mordarska H. Paściak M. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1994; 123: 325-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The wet cell mass was extracted twice by stirring with chloroform-methanol (2:1, v/v, 15 ml/g wet mass) at 37 °C for 12 h. The combined extracts were evaporated by rotary evaporation and then suspended in chloroform-methanol-water (5:5:4.5, v/v) to remove non-lipid material (30Kates M. Burdon R.H. Knippenberg P.H. Laboratory Techniques in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology. Elsevier, Amsterdam1986: 186-274Google Scholar). Finally, the dried crude extract was dissolved in CHCl3 (50 mg/ml) and monitored by TLC for a specific glycolipid pattern as described before (25Mordarska H. Paściak M. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1994; 123: 325-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). This material was kept under N2 in the freezer before further fractionation. The crude lipid extract (500 mg) was fractionated on a column (1.8 × 45 cm) of activated Silica Gel 60 (Merck, 70–230 mesh) eluted successively with the solvents chloroform (4× 100 ml), acetone (5× 100 ml), and methanol (4× 100 ml). The eluates were monitored for polar lipids on silica gel TLC-plates using solvent system I and vanillin reagent. The acetone-soluble fractions that contained glycolipids were further fractionated on a column (1.2 × 35 cm) of Silica Gel 60 (Merck, 200–300 mesh) with gradually increased concentrations of methanol in chloroform (0, 5, 10, 15, 20, and 30 vol%) (31Papa F. Cruaud P. Luquin M. Thorel M.F. Goh K.S. David H.L. Res. Microbiol. 1993; 144: 91-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Fractions of 50 ml were collected. The eluates were monitored by TLC as before. Those glycolipid fractions that contain similarly migrating material were combined and further purified (up to 2–3 times, depending on the degree of contamination) by preparative TLC (28Gamian A. Mordarska H. Ekiel I. Ulrich J. Szponar B. Defaye J. Carbohydr. Res. 1996; 296: 55-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Briefly, 30–40 mg of a sample per Silica Gel F 254 (Merck) plate was developed in chloroform-acetic acid-methanol-water (80:15:12:4, v/v) for the G1 and G2 pair of glycolipids and in chloroform-acetone-methanol-water (50:60:2.5:3, v/v) for the G3 and G4 fractions. Glycolipid bands were detected with a UV lamp and eluted from silica gel with different chloroform-methanol solvents (2:1, 1:1, and 1:2, v/v). The final purification of fraction G3 was performed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)1 on a Waters chromatography system equipped with an M600E pump and an M996 photodiode array detector, which were controlled by the software Millennium 2010. A column (4 × 250 mm) of Nucleosil 100-5 was eluted with a linearly increasing gradient of 5–15 vol% methanol in chloroform. Fractions were collected every 30 s, over 20 min, and the degree of purification was monitored by two-dimensional TLC. The total neutral sugar content was determined by the phenol/sulfuric acid method (32Dubois M. Gilles K.A. Hamilton J.K. Rebers P.A. Smith F. Anal. Chem. 1956; 28: 350-356Crossref Scopus (40591) Google Scholar). Glucose was determined colorimetrically (33Gamian A. Boratyński J. Z˙al A. Roy R. Arch. Immunol. Ther. Exp. 1996; 44: 249-254PubMed Google Scholar). The sugar composition was identified by gas-liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (GLC/MS) after acidic hydrolysis of the lipids (34Sawardeker J.S. Sloneker J.H. Jeanes A.R. Anal. Chem. 1965; 37: 1602-1604Crossref Scopus (1477) Google Scholar). For fatty acid analysis, aliquots (0.2 mg) of the purified glycolipids were dissolved in 0.5 ml of 1m methanolic HCl and incubated at 80 °C for 1 h (35Wollenweber H.W. Rietschel E.T. J. Microbiol. Meth. 1990; 11: 195-211Crossref Scopus (148) Google Scholar). After drying in a stream of nitrogen, the liberated fatty acid methyl esters were directly analyzed by GLC/MS. In another experiment, the methanolized and dried sample was treated with 100 μl of bis(trimethylsilyl)trifluoracetamide (Sigma) at 65 °C for 4 h, and the obtained trimethylsilyl (TMS) derivatives were identified by GLC/MS. Glycerol was determined in acetate form by GLC/MS (34Sawardeker J.S. Sloneker J.H. Jeanes A.R. Anal. Chem. 1965; 37: 1602-1604Crossref Scopus (1477) Google Scholar), using the program with lower temperature starting from 100 °C, and the integrated area of the peak was counted using the factor calculated from the sample of glycerol with glucose, separately run as a standard mixture. The glycolipid fraction (0.3 mg) was methylated according to Hakomori (36Hakomori S. J. Biochem. 1964; 55: 205-208PubMed Google Scholar) and purified on a SepPak C18 cartridge (37Waeghe T.J. Darvill A.G. McNeil M. Albersheim P. Carbohydr. Res. 1983; 123: 281-304Crossref Scopus (429) Google Scholar). The product was hydrolyzed with HCl in 80% CH3COOH (0.6 m, 80 °C, 18 h), reduced with NaBD4, and acetylated. Partially methylated alditol acetates were analyzed by GLC/MS. The position of theO-acylation of the sugars was established by methylation analysis according to Prehm (38Prehm P. Carbohydr. Res. 1980; 78: 372-374Crossref Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Here, the glycolipid (0.3 mg) was solubilized in trimethyl phosphate (0.9 ml) and ultrasonicated with 2,6-di-(tert-butyl)pyridine (0.15 ml) and methyl trifluoromethanesulfonate (0.15 ml) at 50 °C for 2 h. The product was extracted twice with chloroform-water (1:1, v/v), and the organic layer, after drying, was methylated again according to Hakomori (36Hakomori S. J. Biochem. 1964; 55: 205-208PubMed Google Scholar) using deuterated methyl iodide. The methylated product was hydrolyzed with HCl in 80% CH3COOH (0.6 m, 80 °C, 18 h), reduced with NaBD4, acetylated, and analyzed by GLC/MS. The glycolipid (0.4 mg) was hydrolyzed with 1m HCl at 100 °C for 4 h. d-Glucose was quantified from the dried neutralized sample by enzymatic procedure with d-glucose oxidase (39Bergmeyer H.U. Bernt E. Bergmeyer H.U. Gawehn K. Methoden der enzymatischen Analyse. Verlag Chemie, Weinheim1974: 1250-1259Google Scholar). GLC/MS was performed on a Hewlett-Packard 5971A gas-liquid chromatograph-mass spectrometer equipped with an HP-1 glass capillary column (0.2 mm × 12 m). A temperature program of 150–270 °C at 8 °C/min was applied. MALDI-TOF mass spectra of native glycolipids were recorded with a Bruker-Reflex II spectrometer (Bruker-Franzen Analytik, Bremen, Germany) in both linear and reflection TOF configuration at an acceleration voltage of 20 kV and delayed ion extraction. The glycolipids were dissolved in chloroform-methanol (2:1, v/v, 1 μg/ml). One microliter of sample was then mixed with 1 μl of 0.5m matrix solution of 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid (Aldrich) in methanol, and aliquots of 0.5 μl were deposited on a metallic sample holder and analyzed immediately after drying in a stream of air. The mass spectra shown are the sum of at least 50 laser shots and were calibrated externally with glycolipids of known chemical structure. High resolution mass spectrometric analyses were performed in the positive ion mode using an electrospray ionization (ESI) Fourier-transform ion cyclotron resonance (FT-ICR) mass spectrometer (APEX II, Bruker Daltonics, Billerica, MA) equipped with a 7-tesla actively shielded magnet and an Apollo ion source. Samples were dissolved in a 30:30 mixture of 2-propanol and 6 mmammonium acetate, at a concentration of ∼10 ng/μl, and sprayed at a flow rate of 2 μl/min. Broad-band mass spectra (1 macquisition size) were acquired using standard experimental sequences as provided by the manufacturer. The NMR spectra of glycolipids were recorded from solutions in CDCl3/CD3OD (2:1, v/v, 0.5 ml). Measurements were achieved at 27 °C relative to tetramethylsilane (δH = 0.0) and CDCl3 (δC = 77.0). For structural assignments, one- and two-dimensional 1H NMR spectra were recorded with a Bruker DRX 600 spectrometer (operating frequency, 600 MHz). 13C NMR spectra were recorded with a Bruker AMX-360 spectrometer (operating frequency, 90 MHz). The correlation (COSY), the heteronuclear multiple bond correlation (HMBC), and the total correlation spectroscopy (TOCSY) data were recorded using standard Bruker software. The heteronuclear multiple quantum coherence (HMQC) spectrum was measured in the1H-detected mode via multiple quantum coherence with proton decoupling in the 13C domain. Nuclear Overhauser enhancement spectroscopy (NOESY) was measured using data sets (t 1 × t 2) of 2048 × 512 points, and 48 scans were acquired. A mixing time of 300 ms was employed. The sera tested in the study were obtained from rabbits immunized with P. propionicum strain PCM 2431 (ATCC 14157T). Additionally, some control sera were used from rabbit individuals, before treatment. Rabbits (5–6 months old) were immunized twice a week with a cell mass of P. propionicum according to the schedule used previously (40Gamian A. Romanowska A. Romanowska E. FEMS Microbiol. Immunol. 1992; 89: 323-328Crossref Google Scholar) with a small modification. The cells were previously disintegrated in an X-Press (AB BIOX), lyophilized, and suspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The following antigenic doses were applied: 100 μg of dry cell mass/ml for the first subcutaneous injection and doubly increasing amounts (200, 400, 800, 1600, 3200, and 6400 μg/ml) for the succeeding intravenous injections. The antisera were checked by conventional passive hemagglutination test (PHT) using sheep erythrocytes coated withP. propionicum cellular antigens prepared earlier for immunization. Because of poor antigenicity of propionibacteria, the immunization was usually prolonged by two additional injections with the highest dose of cells (6400 μg/ml). After the last injection (7–10 days) the titers of antisera were verified by PHT, then rabbits were bled. The separated antisera were decomplemented (56 °C, 30 min) and stored at −20 °C. Delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction was induced at the 2- and 4-week time points of the rabbit immunization experiment. Glycolipid suspensions in PBS (1000, 100 μg/ml) were prepared by sonication in ultrasonic water bath (37 °C, 3 min), and 0.1-ml doses were injected intracutaneously in the clipped paravertebral region of immunized animals. For control purposes 0.1 ml of bacterial cell suspension (1 mg/ml) or PBS was injected. A cellulose nitrate membrane (Micro Filtration Systems, Dublin, CA, pore size 0.45 μm) and the method employed by Papa et al. (41Papa F. Luquin M. David H.L. Res. Microbiol. 1992; 143: 327-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) (called here dot-EIA) were used with a small modification. Briefly, glycolipid antigens (dissolved in chloroform) were placed on nitrocellulose strips in an equal volume (1 μl) with decreasing concentrations (1000, 500, 100, 50, and 10 ng). Nitrocellulose was dipped in 0.2% casein in Tris-buffered saline, pH 7.5 (TBS) (with gentle shaking) for 2 h and rinsed twice with TBS. Then strips were incubated with specific antiserum diluted in TBS at 37 °C for 12 h. After the strips were washed in TBS (3×), the anti-rabbit IgG/horseradish peroxidase conjugate (DAKO) was used. The membranes were then incubated in the substrate 0.05% 4-chloro-1-naphtol (Sigma) at 20–22 °C, and washing with water stopped the reaction. The extraction of 106 g of wet bacterial cell mass of P. propionicum, obtained from 35 liters of culture medium, yielded 1.5 g of a crude lipid extract. Smaller amounts (10–15 mg) of chloroform-methanol extracts were obtained for comparative purposes from 2–3 g of wet cell mass batches of six other representative species of propionibacteria. Thin-layer chromatography of the polar lipids from thePropionibacterium strains revealed that P. propionicum contained rather high amounts of its major glycolipids, resulting in a chromatographic pattern of two pairs with two compounds each (Fig. 1). Extracts ofP. acidipropionici and P. freudenreichiicontained single components as major glycolipids, possessing different mobility than those obtained from P. propionicum. The other strains tested were devoid of major glycolipids. The characteristic glycolipids G1–G4 ofP. propionicum migrated in TLC as the two pairs G1+G2 and G3+G4, respectively. Re-chromatography of both groups applying various two-dimensional TLC developing systems did not improve the separation of their components. However, the glycolipids of P. propionicum could still be isolated and purified for chemical analysis and structural studies. From the crude lipid extract subjected to column chromatography, fractions were obtained by successive elution with chloroform, acetone, and methanol (Fig. 2). These eluates contained neutral lipids, glycolipids, and phospholipids, respectively, in yields of 15.1%, 38.8%, and 46.1% of the crude lipid extract. The acetone-soluble eluates (containing glycolipids) were separated into the two pairs G3, G4 and G1, G2, utilizing successively 5% MeOH in CHCl3and 10–20% MeOH in CHCl3, respectively, which could finally be purified by preparative TLC. From isolated G4, traces of contaminating G3 were removed by HPLC. The purity of glycolipids was confirmed by two-dimensional TLC in two pairs of solvents, by MALDI-TOF MS and HPLC. The chemical characteristics of the glycolipids (R Fvalues, yields, and quantitative sugar and fatty acids compositions) are presented in Table I. Glucose, glycerol (in non-stoichiometric amounts), and fatty acids were detected as components, but neither amino sugars nor phosphorus could be found. The composition of the fatty acids (branched iso- andanteiso-C15:0 as well as linear fatty acidsn-C15:0, n-C16:0, andn-C18:0) varied in G1–G4. After methanolysis and TMS derivatization of glycolipids G2–G4, 1-O-pentadecyl-2,3-di-O-TMS-glycerol, and less amounts of 1-O-hexadecyl-2,3-di-O-TMS-glycerol were identified (Fig. 3). The presence of glucose was proven by GLC/MS and a specific colorimetric method, which distinguishes glucose from ketoses and other aldoses (33Gamian A. Boratyński J. Z˙al A. Roy R. Arch. Immunol. Ther. Exp. 1996; 44: 249-254PubMed Google Scholar). The enzymatic procedure used for the determination of the glucose configuration revealed that in all glycolipids glucose (Glc) possessed the d configuration.Table IThe chemical composition of major glycolipids from P. propionicum PCM 2431 (ATCC 14157 T )G1G2G3G4R fvalue0.580.610.770.81Yield (%)1-aThe yield of glycolipid refers to the percent amount obtained from the crude lipid extract.0.542.610.810.94Total sugar1-bThe total neutral sugar in glycolipid determined by the phenol/sulfuric acid method (32).3051-eValues of the content of compound are given in nmol/mg of glycolipid.

The increase of the cytosolic Ca2+concentration ([Ca2+]c) promotes activation and/or nuclear import of some transcription factors, but others require the increase of the nuclear Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]N) for activation. Whether the nuclear envelope may act as a diffusion barrier for propagation of [Ca2+]c signals remains controversial. We have studied the spreading of Ca2+ from the cytosol to the nucleus by comparing the cytosolic and the nuclear Ca2+signals reported by targeted aequorins in adrenal chromaffin, PC12, and GH3 pituitary cells. Strong stimulation of either Ca2+ entry (by depolarization with high K+ or acethylcholine) or Ca2+ release from the intracellular Ca2+ stores (by stimulation with caffeine, UTP, bradykinin, or thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH)) produced similar Ca2+ signals in cytosol and nucleus. In contrast, both spontaneous and TRH-stimulated oscillations of cytosolic Ca2+ in single GH3 cells were considerably dampened during propagation to the nucleus. These results are consistent with the existence of a kinetic barrier that filters high frequency physiological [Ca2+]c oscillations without disturbing sustained [Ca2+]cincreases. Thus, encoding of the Ca2+ signal may allow differential control of Ca2+-dependent mechanisms located at either the cytosol or the nucleus. Ca2+ signals may regulate gene expression.

The increase of the cytosolic Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]c)1promotes activation and/or nuclear import of some transcription factors, such as NFAT or NFκB (2Crabtree G.R.

Berridge M.J. Lipp P. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2000; 57: 371-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The nucleus is surrounded by a double membrane, the nuclear envelope (NE), which can accumulate Ca2+ inside its lumen. It has been proposed that Ca2+ can be released directly from NE cisterna into the nucleoplasm through ion channels associated to either inositol trisphosphate or ryanodine receptors of the inner NE membrane (7Gerasimenko O.V. Gerasimenko J.V. Tepikin A.V. Petersen O.H. Cell. 1995; 80: 439-444Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar, 8Lui P.P. Kong S.K. Fung K.P. Lee C.Y.

Cell Calcium. 1998; 23: 87-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). On the other hand, cytosol and nucleoplasm communicate through 10-nm diameter nuclear pores with large ion conductance (10Stoffler D. Fahrenkrog B. Aebi U. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 391-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). However, conductance can be drastically reduced by either ATP-dependent accumulation of Ca2+ inside NE (gating) or macromolecular transport through nuclear pore complexes (plugging) (11Bustamante J.O. Michelette E.R. Geibel J.P. Dean D.A. Hanover J.A. McDonnell T.J. Pfluegers Arch. 2000; 439: 433-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). The permeability of the NE to cytosolic Ca2+ is a matter of controversy. While several authors report that [Ca2+]N follows passively changes of [Ca2+]c (12Brini M. Murgia M. Pasti L. Picard D.

This question is not trivial, as it may determine whether or not cytosolic Ca2+ signals shall be transduced into changes of gene expression. In the present work we have compared the cytosolic and the nuclear Ca2+ signals reported by targeted aequorins in several resting and stimulated cell systems (adrenal chromaffin cells, PC12 cells, GH3 pituitary cells). We find that strong stimulation of either Ca2+ entry or Ca2+release from the intracellular Ca2+ stores produced similar Ca2+ signals in cytosol and nucleus. However, both spontaneous and thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH)-stimulated [Ca2+] oscillations in GH3 cells were considerably dampened in nucleus as compared with cytosol, suggesting that nucleus can filter high frequency physiological [Ca2+]c signals.

Cells expressing apoaequorins were incubated for 1–2 h at room temperature with 1 μm coelenterazine. Coelenterazine h (from Molecular Probes), which increases the affinity of reconstituted aequorin for Ca2+ (25Shimomura O. Musicki B. Kishi Y. Inouye S. Cell Calcium. 1993; 14: 373-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), was used for imaging experiments. The standard incubation medium had the following composition (in mm): NaCl, 145; KCl, 5; CaCl2, 1; MgCl2, 1; glucose, 10; sodium-HEPES, 10, pH 7.4. Batch cell aequorin photoluminescence measurements were performed as described previously (19Montero M. Alonso M.T. Carnicero E. Cuchillo-Ibanez I. Albillos A. Garcia A.G. Garcia-Sancho J. Alvarez J.

Measuring Calcium and Calmodulin Inside and Outside Cells. Springer Laboratory Manual, Berlin2001: 147-163Crossref Google Scholar). For bioluminescence imaging measurements (23Villalobos C. Nuñez L.

FASEB J. 2002; 16: 343-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), cells were placed into a perfusion chamber thermostatted to 37 °C under a Zeiss Axiovert 100 TV microscope and perfused at 5–10 ml/min with the test solutions, prewarmed at 37 °C. At the end of each experiment cells were permeabilized with 0.1 mm digitonin in 10 mmCaCl2 to release all the residual aequorin counts. Images were taken with a Hamamatsu VIM photon counting camera handled with an Argus-20 image processor and integrated for 10-s periods. Photons/cell in each image were quantified using the Hamamatsu Aquacosmos software. Total counts per cell ranged between 2 × 103 and 2 × 105, and noise was (mean ± S.D.) 1 ± 1 cps typical cell area (about 2000 pixels). Data were quantified as rates of photoluminescence emission/total cps remaining at each time and divided by the integration period (L/LTOTAL in s−1). Emission values of less than 4 cps were not used for calculations. Calibrations for [Ca2+] are shown in Fig. 3. For calculation of oscillation indexes the differences (in absolute value) between each L/LTOTAL value and the following one were added and divided by the total number of measurements during the integration period. This parameter is sensitive to both the amplitude and the frequency of oscillations (20Villalobos C. Garcia-Sancho J. Pfluegers Arch. 1996; 431: 371-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). To assess whether the NE affects the progression of the Ca2+ wave we elicited a [Ca2+]cincrease, either by activation of Ca2+ entry or of Ca2+ release from the endoplasmic reticulum, and compared the size of the Ca2+ peaks measured in cytosol and nucleus. Fig. 1 A summarizes results in bovine adrenal chromaffin cells. Ca2+ entry was elicited either by depolarization with high K+ (70 mm) solution or by stimulation with acetylcholine. The [Ca2+] peaks were very similar in the cytosol (open bars) and in the nucleus (filled bars). Ca2+ release from the endoplasmic reticulum was induced by stimulation with caffeine (18Alonso M.T. Barrero M.J. Michelena P. Carnicero E. Cuchillo I. Garcia A.G. Garcia-Sancho J. Montero M. Alvarez J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 241-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Again the [Ca2+] peaks elicited by caffeine in the cytosol and the nucleus were very similar (Fig. 1 A). In PC12 cells the Ca2+ peaks elicited in cytosol and nucleus by either Ca2+ entry (High K+) or Ca2+ release from the intracellular Ca2+ stores (UTP or bradykinin) were similar. In GH3 pituitary cells depolarization with high K+or release of Ca2+ from the stores by stimulation with 0.1 μm TRH (22Alonso M.T. Barrero M.J. Carnicero E. Montero M. Garcia-Sancho J. Alvarez J. Cell Calcium. 1998; 24: 87-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) also produced similar Ca2+ peaks in cytosol and nucleus (Fig. 1 C). In all the cases the increase of [Ca2+]c tended to be somewhat smaller in the nucleus but the differences were small, at most 25%, even though some of them were statistically significant (Fig. 1). The apparent permeability of the NE was directly assessed by monitoring changes of [Ca2+]N on exposure of permeabilized HEK-293 cells to bathing solutions with controlled Ca2+ concentrations. When external [Ca2+] was increased from 0.1 to 2 μm,[Ca2+]N increased quickly to near thermodynamic equilibrium (Fig. 2 A). Addition of the Ca2+ ionophore ionomycin at this stage did not modify [Ca2+]N. On switching perfusion to the low [Ca2+] solution, [Ca2+]Nreturned quickly to the resting level. Half-equilibration times were about 10 s for both the increase and the decrease of [Ca2+]N. Similar results were obtained with permeabilized GH3 pituitary cells (Fig. 2 B). Single-cell measurements produced similar results (Fig. 2 C). Several putative regulatory mechanisms of nuclear permeability to Ca2+ were explored pharmacologically. Pretreatment of the cells with activators of either protein-kinase A (forskolin, 5 μm, 5 min) or protein kinase C (phorbol myristate acetate, 0.1 μm, 5 min) did not modify results in experiments similar to those in Fig. 2 A. Replacement of K+ by Na+, addition of protonophores (carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone, 10 μm) or inhibitors of the endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ pump (tert-butylhydroquinone, 40 μm) did not have any effect either. The above results suggest that the NE does not act as a significant permeability barrier for Ca2+ diffusion, and hence [Ca2+]N mimics [Ca2+]c, at least for events that last for several seconds, such as the ones tested here. However, we were surprised to find that the measured resting [Ca2+]N in GH3 cells was consistently much smaller than [Ca2+]c. The values found were (mean ± S.E.) 56 ± 14 (n= 11) and 177 ± 39 nm (n = 12), respectively. In the other cell types we found no such differences between the resting values of [Ca2+]c and [Ca2+]N. A relevant difference among these cell types is that GH3 cells display spontaneous electric activity, Ca2+ action potentials, and [Ca2+]c oscillations (27Schlegel W. Winiger B.P. Mollard P. Vacher P. Wuarin F. Zahnd G.R. Wollheim C.B. Dufy B. Nature. 1987; 329: 719-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 28Winiger B.P. Schlegel W. Biochem. J. 1988; 255: 161-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). We reasoned that a kinetic barrier could filter propagation of high frequency [Ca2+]c oscillations to the nucleus. This would result in a lower value of the average resting [Ca2+]c in GH3 cells, but not in the other cell types tested, which do not display spontaneous Ca2+ oscillations. On the other hand, this kinetic barrier would not disturb significantly the propagation to nucleus of sustained [Ca2+]c increases, such as those shown in Fig. 1. To test this working hypothesis we compared single-cell spontaneous [Ca2+]c and [Ca2+]N oscillations in GH3cells. Hypothalamic releasing factors regulate hormone secretion in several anterior pituitary cell types by increasing (TRH, growth hormone-releasing hormone) or decreasing (dopamine, somatostatin) the spontaneous activity (29Mollard P. Schlegel W. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 1996; 7: 361-365Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In GH3 cells, TRH increases the rate of action potential firing, [Ca2+]coscillations, and prolactin secretion (27Schlegel W. Winiger B.P. Mollard P. Vacher P. Wuarin F. Zahnd G.R. Wollheim C.B. Dufy B. Nature. 1987; 329: 719-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 28Winiger B.P. Schlegel W. Biochem. J. 1988; 255: 161-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 29Mollard P.

Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 3548-3554Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Fig. 3 A compares typical traces of spontaneous and TRH-induced [Ca2+]cand [Ca2+]N activity in single GH3 cells. TRH reversibly increased activity in both compartments (traces 1 and 2). Overall, the size of the [Ca2+]N peaks tended to be smaller than the [Ca2+]c ones, both during spontaneous and during TRH-induced activity. Fig. 3 B shows the averaged [Ca2+]c and [Ca2+]N traces of all the cells present in the microscope field. Since Ca2+ oscillations are not synchronic among cells, they disappeared on averaging. The average [Ca2+]N values were smaller than the [Ca2+]c ones, especially during the resting periods. During stimulation with high K+, [Ca2+]N and [Ca2+]cvalues tended to converge. This is consistent with the results obtained in the batch experiments described above (Fig. 1 C). Fig3 C compares the [Ca2+]c and the [Ca2+]N oscillations, quantified as oscillation indexes. These indexes are computed by adding the differences (in absolute value) between every [Ca2+] value and the subsequent one along the whole integration period (20Villalobos C. Garcia-Sancho J. Pfluegers Arch. 1996; 431: 371-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The average oscillation index was three to four times smaller in the nucleus than in the cytosol during the resting periods (Restor Wash). During stimulation with TRH the oscillation index increased both in cytosol and in nucleus, but still it was two to three times smaller in the nucleus (Fig. 3 C). In trace 3 of Fig. 3 A we have modeled the effects of a nuclear permeability barrier with T 12 = 10 s on the transmission of the [Ca2+]c oscillation (trace 1) to the nucleus (trace 3). The outcome was very similar to the experimental observation (comparetraces 2 and 3). The oscillation index computed from trace 1 (cytosol) was 3.9 times larger than the one computed from trace 3 (nucleus), a difference very similar to the one measured experimentally (Fig. 3 C). The kinetic barrier proposed here could fit equally well for either slowed diffusion at the NE or increased buffering of Ca2+ inside nucleus (31Teruel M.N. Chen W. Persechini A. Meyer T. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 86-94Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In both cases the appearance of free Ca2+inside the nucleus would be slower than expected. In conclusion, our results indicate that nucleus dampens Ca2+ oscillations of cytosolic origin in GH3cells, both the spontaneous and the TRH-induced. This nuclear barrier is, however, much less efficient to filter sustained increases of [Ca2+]c such as those elicited here by depolarization with high K+ solutions for several seconds or maximal stimulation with inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-generating agonists or caffeine. In practical terms, this means that propagation of the [Ca2+]c signal to the nucleus is very much dependent on signal encoding, the higher frequency signals being much less efficient than the more sustained ones. This may be a clue for understanding the effects of different stimulation patterns on nuclear events. For example, [Ca2+]coscillations increase the efficiency of gene expression via NFAT or NFκB (3Dolmetsch R., Xu, K. Lewis R.S. Nature. 1998; 392: 933-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (1683) Google Scholar). Another example is the differential activation of serum response element-regulated genes and cyclic AMP response element-regulated genes by either cytosolic or nuclear calcium rises (32Hardingham G.E. Bading H. Microsc. Res. Tech. 1999; 46: 348-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). According to our results, expression of genes controlled directly by [Ca2+]N should preferentially respond to sustained [Ca2+]c changes. We thank Dr. J. Alvarez for helpful comments and J. Fernández for technical assistance."
https://openalex.org/W1980042217,"N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase III (GnT-III) is a key enzyme that inhibits the extension ofN-glycans by introducing a bisectingN-acetylglucosamine residue. Our previous studies have shown that modification of N-glycans by GnT-III affects a number of intracellular signaling pathways. In this study, the effects of GnT-III on the cellular response to reactive oxygen species (ROS) were examined. We found that an overexpression of GnT-III suppresses H2O2-induced apoptosis in HeLaS3 cells. In the case of GnT-III transfectants, activation of Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) following H2O2treatment was markedly reduced compared with control cells. Either the depletion of protein kinase C (PKC) by prolonged treatment with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate or the inhibition of PKC by the specific inhibitor H7 attenuated the H2O2-induced activation of JNK1 and apoptosis in control cells but not in the GnT-III transfectants. Furthermore, we found that H2O2-induced phosphorylation of PKCδ was markedly suppressed in GnT-III transfectants. Rottlerin, a specific inhibitor of PKCδ, significantly inhibited H2O2-induced activation of JNK1 in control cells, indicating that PKCδ is involved in the pathway. These findings suggest that the overexpression of GnT-III suppresses H2O2-induced activation of PKCδ−JNK1 pathway, resulting in inhibition of apoptosis.

Glycobiology. 1993; 3: 97-130Google Scholar). To clarify the function of each oligosaccharide structure, many glycosyltransferases that catalyze the formation of sugar chains have been identified, cloned, and characterized. However, the precise physiological functions of each oligosaccharide structure continue to remain elusive. N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (GnT-III)1 is one such glycosyltransferase. It catalyzes the attachment of a GlcNAc residue in a β1, 4-linkage to the β1, 4-mannose residue in the core region ofN-glycans, producing a bisecting GlcNAc (2Nishikawa A. Ihara Y. Hatakeyama M. Kangawa K. Taniguchi N. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18199-18204Google Scholar, 3Narasimhan S. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 10235-10242Google Scholar). GnT-III suppresses the further processing and elongation ofN-glycans because the bisecting GlcNAc structure affects the conformation of the sugar chains; as a result, other glycosyltransferases such as GnT-II, GnT-IV, and GnT-V are no longer able to act on the oligosaccharides containing the bisecting GlcNAc (4Taniguchi N. Miyoshi E., Ko, J.H. Ikeda Y. Ihara Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1455: 287-300Google Scholar,5Taniguchi N. Ihara Y. Glycoconj. J. 1995; 12: 733-738Google Scholar). Many aspects of the biological significance of GnT-III have been examined. The metastatic potential of B16 mouse melanoma cells is decreased by the introduction of the GnT-III gene (6Yoshimura M. Nishikawa A. Ihara Y. Taniguchi S. Taniguchi N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8754-8758Google Scholar). This anti-metastatic effect of GnT-III is caused by an increase in E-cadherin-mediated homotypic adhesion (7Kitada T. Miyoshi E. Noda K. Higashiyama S. Ihara H. Matsuura N. Hayashi N. Kawata S. Matsuzawa Y. Taniguchi N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 475-480Google Scholar). The overexpression of the GnT-III gene also affects nerve growth factor signaling by suppressing the dimerization of TrkA in PC12 cells (8Ihara Y. Sakamoto Y. Mihara M. Shimizu K. Taniguchi N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9629-9634Google Scholar). Very recently, we reported that GnT-III gene induction resulted in changes in N-glycan structures and enhanced epidermal growth factor (EGF)-induced Erk phosphorylation in HeLaS3 cells, and we found that this up-regulation of Erk phosphorylation is due to the enhancement of receptor internalization (9Sato Y. Takahashi M. Shibukawa Y. Jain S.K. Hamaoka R. Miyagawa J. Yaginuma Y. Honke K. Ishikawa M. Taniguchi N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11956-11962Google Scholar). In the present study, we report on an examination of whether GnT-III overexpression modulates signaling caused by H2O2. It is known that H2O2 is a major component of the reactive oxygen species (ROS) in cells, which can trigger the activation of multiple signaling pathways that influence the cytotoxicity. For example, treatment of HeLa cells with H2O2resulted in a time- and dose-dependent induction of apoptosis accompanied by activation of various members of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) superfamily (10Wang X. Martindale J.L. Liu Y. Holbrook N.J. Biochem. J. 1998; 333: 291-300Google Scholar, 11Aikawa R. Komuro I. Yamazaki T. Zou Y. Kudoh S. Tanaka M. Shiojima I. Hiroi Y. Yazaki Y. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 1813-1821Google Scholar). We demonstrate that GnT-III overexpression in HeLaS3 cells suppresses H2O2-induced apoptosis and the activity of two stress-regulated MAPKs, JNK and p38, but not Erk 1/2. The results indicate that the suppression of PKCδ activity had an inhibitory effect on JNK activity and apoptosis in GnT-III transfectants. A HeLaS3 cell line that stably expresses human GnT-III has been established previously (9Sato Y. Takahashi M. Shibukawa Y. Jain S.K. Hamaoka R. Miyagawa J. Yaginuma Y. Honke K. Ishikawa M. Taniguchi N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11956-11962Google Scholar) and was maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. To detect the pathway activated by the overexpression of GnT-III, we utilized the Mercury Pathway Profiling Systems (Clontech). Briefly, HeLaS3 cells were cultured in 6-well plates, transiently transfected with promoter-reporter plasmids using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. These plasmids contained a luciferase gene downstream of several copies of the transcription factor-binding sequences. Transfected cells were pre-cultured for 24 h before H2O2 (Nacalai Tesque, Inc., Kyoto, Japan) was added to the media. After a 3-h treatment with H2O2, the cells were harvested and luciferase activities were measured using a luciferase reporter gene assay kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Anti-active MAPK and anti-active JNK antibodies were obtained from Promega (Madison, WI). Anti-phosphorylated Akt, p38-mapk, MKK4/SEK1, MKK3/MKK6, c-Jun, ATF-2, PKCα/βII (Thr-638/641), PKCδ (Thr-505), PKCμ (Ser-744/748), PKCζ/λ (Thr-410/413) antibodies and anti-p38-mapk, Akt, PKCδ antibodies were obtained from New England BioLabs. Anti-MAPK and anti-phosphotyrosine (4G10) antibodies were obtained from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY), and anti-JNK antibody was obtained from Santa Cruz (Santa Cruz, CA). Approximately 4 × 104 cells were plated onto a 96-well plate and allowed to grow for 24 h, after which they were treated with various concentrations of H2O2 in triplicate for 18 h. Ten μl of 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) reagent (Wako, Tokyo, Japan) was then added, and the mixture was incubated for an additional 6 h. The resulting dark crystals were dissolved in 50% isopropanol and 0.02 N HCl, and the absorbance at 550 nm was measured. For DNA analysis of apoptotic cells, cells were treated with or without H2O2 for 18 h and incubated for 10 min in 500 μl of buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm EDTA, 0.2% Triton X-100 on ice, and then centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was incubated overnight at 50 °C with 100 μg/ml Proteinase K. After phenol/chloroform extraction, DNA was precipitated with ethanol and resolved by 1.5% agarose gel electrophoresis (12Sarih M. Souvannavong V. Adam A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 191: 503-508Google Scholar). For detection of apoptotic cells, cells were treated with or without 300 μm H2O2 for 18 h and then washed once with methanol containing 1 μg/ml 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). Cells were then stained with 1 μg/ml DAPI-methanol solution for 15 min. The nuclear morphology of the cells was examined by fluorescence microscopy. Nuclear extracts for an electrophoretic mobility shift assay were prepared by resuspending phosphate-buffered saline-washed cell pellets in a high salt buffer containing Nonidet P-40 (13Baeuerle P.A. Baltimore D. Science. 1988; 242: 540-546Google Scholar). After 30 min on ice, debris was removed by centrifugation for 5 min at 15,000 × g. Equal amounts of protein were reacted with 32P-end-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide. The 32P-labeled probe was prepared by annealing the oligonucleotide CTAGCAAGGGACTTTCCGCTA with the oligonucleotide CTAGTAGCGGAAAGTCCCTTG and labeling it with Klenow fragments and [32P]dCTP (Amersham Biosciences). DNA binding proteins were resolved by electrophoresis on native 4% polyacrylamide gels, and the dried gels were visualized by autoradiography. HeLaS3 cells (80% confluent) were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and solubilized in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% (w/v) Nonidet P-40, 10% (w/v) glycerol, 5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mmdithiothreitol and then centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 15 min. The supernatants were collected, and the protein concentrations were determined using a protein assay CBB kit (Nacalai Tesque). Equal amounts of proteins were fractionated by 12.5% SDS-PAGE and then transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell, Dassel, Germany). The membrane was incubated with primary and secondary antibodies for 1 h each, and detection was performed using an ECL kit (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, lysed in lysis buffer, and centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 15 min. The supernatants were collected and incubated with 4 μg of anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (4G10) for 1 h and then with 15 μl of Protein G-Sepharose 4 Fast Flow (Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h at 4 °C. The immune complex was washed three times with lysis buffer and subjected to Western Blot analysis. For measurement of JNK1 activityin vitro, HeLaS3 cells were lysed in lysis buffer. The lysates were clarified by centrifugation, and the JNK1 was immunoprecipitated with anti-JNK1 antibody C-17 (Santa Cruz). The immune complex was recovered with Protein A-Sepharose 4 Fast Flow and washed twice with lysis buffer and twice with reaction buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 20 mm MgCl2, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 0.5 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm NaF, 0.5 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The reaction was initiated by adding 20 μl of kinase reaction mixture (reaction buffer plus 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Biosciences), 20 μm unlabeled ATP, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 μg of c-Jun (Santa Cruz) as a substrate). After 20 min of incubation at 37 °C, the reactions were terminated by the addition of 5× sample buffer and boiled for 5 min. Samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE and analyzed by phosphorimaging (BAS-2000, Fuji Film). To investigate the effect of GnT-III transfection on cell survival, we examined H2O2-induced cell death in GnT-III transfectants. GnT-III transfectants and control cells were treated with various concentrations of H2O2 for 18 h, and their viability was analyzed by means of an MTT assay. Fig. 1 A shows that H2O2-induced cell death was suppressed in GnT-III transfectants; about 60% of control cells died when the cells were treated with 300 μm H2O2, whereas less than 30% of GnT-III transfectants were found to be dead at the same concentration. A similar result on cell viability was obtained from human mammary carcinoma MCF7 cells following H2O2 exposure (data not shown). Nuclear DNAs were next examined in the same system, in order to distinguish between apoptosis and necrosis. DNA fragmentation was observed in control cells treated with 200–600 μm H2O2 for 18 h but not in the GnT-III transfectants (Fig. 1 B). The degree of DNA fragmentation was apparently reduced at concentrations higher than 600 μm of H2O2 in both cells. In this condition, almost all the cells showed signs of necrotic cell death with focal rupture of cell membranes or surface blebbing (data not shown), and no difference in cell viability was seen between control cells and GnT-III transfectants (Fig. 1 A). When cells were treated with 300 μm H2O2 for 18 h, the nuclei consistently appeared condensed and fragmented by DAPI staining in control cells (Fig. 1 C, panel b), and chromatin condensation was strongly suppressed in the GnT-III transfectants (Fig. 1 C, panel d). Next, when cells were pretreated with caspase3-specific inhibitor, DEVD-CHO, to prevent apoptotic cell death, 300 μmH2O2-induced cell death in control cells was markedly reduced to the same level as in GnT-III transfectants (Fig. 1 D). These results suggest that GnT-III overexpression down-regulates H2O2-induced apoptosis. The activation of NF-κB in GnT-III transfectants was examined because it has been demonstrated that activation of the transcription factor NF-κB has an essential role in protecting cells from apoptosis, as mediated by a variety of stressful stimuli, including oxidative stress such as H2O2 (14Meyer M. Schreck R. Baeuerle P.A. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2005-2015Google Scholar, 15Liou H.C. Baltimore D. Curr. Opin. Cell. Biol. 1993; 5: 477-487Google Scholar, 16Li N. Karin M. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 1137-1143Google Scholar). Fig. 2 A shows that GnT-III transfection had no effect on NF-κB activation following H2O2 exposure. A luciferase assay using a plasmid containing the NF-κB-binding sequence also showed similar results (Fig. 2 B). The possibility that GnT-III suppresses H2O2-induced apoptosis through PI3K/Akt up-regulation was also examined because previous reports have suggested that H2O2 activates the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway that protects cells from ROS-mediated apoptosis (17Shaw M. Cohen P. Alessi D.R. Biochem. J. 1998; 336: 241-246Google Scholar, 18Sonoda Y. Watanabe S. Matsumoto Y. Aizu-Yokota E. Kasahara T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10566-10570Google Scholar, 19Wang X. McCullough K.D. Franke T.F. Holbrook N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14624-14631Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2 C, H2O2 enhanced Akt phosphorylation in both control cells and GnT-III transfectants, and there was no difference between them. There was also no difference in cell viability in the presence or absence of wortmannin, a specific inhibitor of PI3K (Fig. 2 D). These results indicate that the inhibition of H2O2-induced apoptosis in GnT-III transfectants does not occur via NF-κB or PI3K/Akt activation. To elucidate how GnT-III suppresses H2O2-induced apoptosis, we examined MAPK activation in GnT-III transfectants because various members of the MAPK family have been implicated in apoptosis in response to oxidative stress (10Wang X. Martindale J.L. Liu Y. Holbrook N.J. Biochem. J. 1998; 333: 291-300Google Scholar, 11Aikawa R. Komuro I. Yamazaki T. Zou Y. Kudoh S. Tanaka M. Shiojima I. Hiroi Y. Yazaki Y. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 1813-1821Google Scholar). MAPKs activation in the GnT-III transfectants and control cells following H2O2 exposure is shown in Fig. 3. H2O2stimulated a striking increase in the level of Erk 1/2 phosphorylation in both control cells and GnT-III transfectants in a time- and dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3, A andB, upper panels), and no difference between control cells and GnT-III transfectants was observed. On the other hand, the phosphorylation of JNK 1/2 and p38-mapk was also enhanced by H2O2 treatment in both a time- and dose-dependent manner in control cells. However, it was suppressed in the GnT-III transfectants (Fig. 3, A andB). To investigate the activation of JNK and p38-mapk, phosphorylation of transcription-factor c-Jun and ATF-2, which are phosphorylated by JNK and p38-mapk, respectively, was examined. As expected, H2O2-induced c-Jun and ATF-2 phosphorylation was significantly suppressed in the GnT-III transfectants (Fig. 3 C). Furthermore, phosphorylation of MAPKKs, MKK4/SEK1, and MKK3/MKK6, which are able to activate JNK and p38-mapk, was examined. As shown in Fig. 3 D, H2O2-induced MKK4/SEK1 and MKK3/MKK6 phosphorylation was also suppressed in the GnT-III transfectants. These results indicate that the phosphorylation of JNK and p38-mapk by H2O2 is markedly inhibited in the GnT-III transfectants and that the inhibitory effects exist both upstream and downstream of JNK and p38-mapk. We next investigated whether protein kinase C (PKC) is involved in the suppression of H2O2-induced JNK activation and apoptosis in GnT-III transfectants, because PKC has been reported to be involved in JNK activation and apoptosis induced by UV or ionizing radiation (20Chen N., Ma, W. Huang C. Dong Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15389-15394Google Scholar,21Ito Y. Mishra N.C. Yoshida K. Kharbanda S. Saxena S. Kufe D. Cell Death Differ. 2001; 8: 794-800Google Scholar). To deplete PKC, prolonged PMA treatment was performed. In the control cells, H2O2-induced phosphorylation of JNK2 was not affected by PKC depletion, whereas phosphorylation of JNK1 was reduced to the same levels as that of the GnT-III transfectants (Fig. 4 A), indicating that the phosphorylation of JNK1 by H2O2 treatment is mediated by PKC in control cells. The fact that JNK1 activity has been reported to be required for bcl-2 phosphorylation and apoptosis (22Yamamoto K. Ichijo H. Korsmeyer S.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8469-8478Google Scholar) suggests that the PKC-JNK1 signaling pathway is involved in H2O2-induced apoptosis in HeLaS3 cells. We further investigated the effects of GnT-III overexpression in PKC and JNK1 activation. H2O2-induced JNK1 activity was significantly reduced in control cells by PKC depletion by prolonged PMA treatment but remained unchanged in GnT-III transfectants (Fig. 4 B). Similar results were obtained using a PKC-specific inhibitor, H7 (Fig. 4 C). In addition, PKC depletion by prolonged PMA treatment was effective in blocking H2O2-induced cell death in control cells, but little or no effect was detected in the GnT-III transfectants (Fig. 4 D). Similar results were obtained when the PKC-specific inhibitors, H7 and sangivamycin, were used (data not shown). Thus, it was suggested that GnT-III overexpression inhibits JNK1 activation and apoptosis in a PKC-dependent manner. It is known that the PKC family consists of three groups: conventional, novel, and atypical PKC isoforms. Neither Gö-6976 nor Ro-32–0432, both of which are conventional PKC-specific inhibitors, attenuated the H2O2-induced activation of JNK1 in control cells (data not shown), indicating that novel or atypical PKC mediates H2O2-induced JNK1 activation in HeLaS3 cells and that GnT-III overexpression might affect the activation of those PKCs. We further investigated the specific type of PKC that is affected in the GnT-III transfectants. We examined H2O2-induced phosphorylation of PKCα, βII in the conventional family, PKCζ, λ in the atypical family, and PKCδ, μ in the novel family. As shown in Fig. 5, H2O2- or PMA-induced phosphorylation on threonine residue in PKCδ was markedly decreased in the GnT-III transfectants. No difference in the protein expression level of PKCδ between control cells and GnT-III transfectants was detected (data not shown). It has also been suggested that PKCδ was phosphorylated on multiple tyrosine residues by H2O2 exposure and that tyrosine phosphorylation of PKCδ increases its kinase activity (23Sun X., Wu, F. Datta R. Kharbanda S. Kufe D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7470-7473Google Scholar, 24Konishi H. Yamauchi E. Taniguchi H. Yamamoto T. Matsuzaki H. Takemura Y. Ohmae K. Kikkawa U. Nishizuka Y. Proc.

Fig. 6 A showed that the tyrosine phosphorylation of PKCδ was enhanced by H2O2treatment in control cells but it was suppressed in the GnT-III transfectants (Fig. 6 A, upper panel). To further examine the issue of whether the suppression of PKCδ is involved in the down-regulation of JNK1 in GnT-III transfectants, we used the PKCδ-selective inhibitor, rottlerin. The results showed that rottlerin inhibited H2O2-induced PKCδ activation as expected (Fig. 6 B, upper panel), and H2O2-induced JNK1 phosphorylation was significantly suppressed in control cells but was not changed in GnT-III transfectants (Fig. 6 B, lower panel). Thus, these results suggest that GnT-III overexpression inhibits H2O2-induced JNK1 activation and apoptosis by suppressing the activation of PKCδ.Figure 6GnT-III overexpression inhibits H2O2-induced JNK1 activation through suppression of PKC δ activation. A, cells were treated with or without 600 μmH2O2 for the indicated times. Cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-phospho-tyrosine antibody (4G10). The lysates and immunoprecipitants were subjected to SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blotting using PKCδ antibody.B, cells were preincubated with or without 50 μm rottlerin for 30 min and treated with 300 μm H2O2 for 30 min. Cell lysates were analyzed by Western blotting, using specific antibodies as indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The effects of GnT-III overexpression on H2O2 signaling in HeLaS3 cells were examined. We found that overexpression of GnT-III markedly suppresses H2O2-induced apoptosis by down-regulating JNK1 activation. We propose that H2O2-induced activation of PKCδ is suppressed in GnT-III transfectants, which is responsible for inhibition of JNK1 activation. One of the major signaling pathways for influencing the survival of cells subjected to oxidative stress is mediated by NF-κB and Akt (16Li N. Karin M. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 1137-1143Google Scholar,18Sonoda Y. Watanabe S. Matsumoto Y. Aizu-Yokota E. Kasahara T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10566-10570Google Scholar, 19Wang X. McCullough K.D. Franke T.F.

Chem. 1995; 270: 27136-27142Google Scholar); several groups have reported that H2O2 induces NF-κB activation (14Meyer M. Schreck R. Baeuerle P.A. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2005-2015Google Scholar, 15Liou H.C. Baltimore D. Curr. Opin. Cell. Biol. 1993; 5: 477-487Google Scholar, 16Li N. Karin M. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 1137-1143Google Scholar). Therefore, we first examined NF-κB activation in our system, but the findings show that there is little or no NF-κB activation either in control HeLaS3 cells or GnT-III transfectants (Fig. 3). Similar results have been reported by using myocytes (27Li Y. Zhang W. Mantell L.L. Kazzaz J.A. Fein A.M. Horowitz S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20646-20649Google Scholar). Thus, we have concluded that H2O2-induced NF-κB activation might be highly cell type-dependent. There was also no difference in Akt activation between control and GnT-III transfectants. Our results support the contention that MAPKs play a critical role in H2O2-induced apoptosis in HeLaS3 cells (10Wang X. Martindale J.L. Liu Y. Holbrook N.J. Biochem. J. 1998; 333: 291-300Google Scholar). H2O2 is known to activate both Erk and JNK (10Wang X. Martindale J.L. Liu Y. Holbrook N.J. Biochem. J. 1998; 333: 291-300Google Scholar,11Aikawa R. Komuro I. Yamazaki T. Zou Y. Kudoh S. Tanaka M. Shiojima I. Hiroi Y. Yazaki Y. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 1813-1821Google Scholar). The general hypothesis is that the dynamic balance between Erk and JNK pathways is important in determining whether a cell survives or undergoes apoptosis (28Xia Z. Dickens M. Raingeaud J. Davis R.J. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1995; 270: 1326-1331Google Scholar). Wang et al. (10Wang X. Martindale J.L. Liu Y. Holbrook N.J. Biochem. J. 1998; 333: 291-300Google Scholar) reported that H2O2-induced apoptosis was markedly enhanced when ERK was inhibited by PD098059 and it decreased when JNK activation was inhibited by expression of a dominant negative mutant form of MEK4. Recent studies suggest that the JNK activity is necessary for the stress-induced activation of the cytochrome c-mediated death pathway via bcl-2/bcl-xL phosphorylation (22Yamamoto K. Ichijo H. Korsmeyer S.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8469-8478Google Scholar, 29Kharbanda S. Saxena S. Yoshida K. Pandey P. Kaneki M. Wang Q. Cheng K. Chen Y.N. Campbell A. Sudha T. Yuan Z.M. Narula J. Weichselbaum R. Nalin C. Kufe D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 322-327Google Scholar, 30Tournier C. Hess P. Yang D.D., Xu, J. Turner T.K. Nimnual A. Bar-Sagi D. Jones S.N. Flavell R.A. Davis R.J. Science. 2000; 288: 870-874Google Scholar). Our results show that GnT-III overexpression suppresses JNK1 activation but does not affect the Erk pathways, suggesting that this inhibition of JNK1 results in cell survival. p38-mapk is also activated by various stressful stimuli and is involved in the apoptosis signal (31Kimura N. Matsuo R. Shibuya H. Nakashima K. Taga T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17647-17652Google Scholar, 32Kang Y.J. Zhou Z.X. Wang G.W. Buridi A. Klein J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13690-13698Google Scholar). However, a p38-mapk-specific inhibitor, SB20358, had no effect on cell viability in our system (data not shown), indicating that p38-mapk is not involved in the prevention of H2O2-induced apoptosis in GnT-III transfectants. In this report, we have shown that PKC-JNK1 pathway is involved in H2O2-induced apoptosis in HeLaS3 cells. Although it has been reported that PKC is involved in JNK activation and apoptosis by UV or ionizing radiation, the signaling pathway of JNK activation induced by H2O2 has not been well defined. As indicated in Fig. 4, PKC inhibition by pretreatment with PMA- or PKC-specific inhibitors was effective in blocking H2O2-induced JNK1 activation and apoptosis in control cells. We have shown that GnT-III overexpression suppressed both PMA- and H2O2-induced activation of PKCδ. PKCδ belongs to the PKC family, which consists of at least 12 members and which can be classified into three groups based on their biochemical properties and sequence homologies. Conventional PKC isoforms (cPKC-α, -βI, -βII, -γ) are calcium- and phospholipid-dependent and are activated by phosphatidylserine and diacylglycerol (DAG). Novel PKC isoforms (nPKC-δ, -ε, -η, -θ, -μ) can be activated by DAG but not by calcium. Atypical PKC isoforms (aPKC-ι, -λ, -ζ,) are calcium- and phospholipid-independent. The different PKC isotypes may have specific roles in signal transduction. Recent reports have suggested that PKCδ was phosphorylated on multiple tyrosine residues by various tyrosine kinases, such as Fyn, Src, Lyn, Abl, and growth factor receptors and that the tyrosine phosphorylation of PKCδ increases its kinase activity (23Sun X., Wu, F. Datta R. Kharbanda S. Kufe D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7470-7473Google Scholar, 24Konishi H. Yamauchi E. Taniguchi H. Yamamoto T. Matsuzaki H. Takemura Y. Ohmae K. Kikkawa U. Nishizuka Y. Proc.

In this study, it was shown that H2O2-induced threonine and tyrosine phosphorylation of PKCδ was markedly suppressed in the GnT-III transfectants, resulting in down-regulation of JNK1 activation. Our results are consistent with the report that PKCδ is a pro-apoptotic molecule that activates JNK and is required for mitochondrial-dependent apoptosis (20Chen N., Ma, W. Huang C. Dong Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15389-15394Google Scholar, 34Majumder P.K. Pandey P. Sun X. Cheng K. Datta R. Saxena S. Kharbanda S. Kufe D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21793-21796Google Scholar, 35Majumder P.K.

It has been also demonstrated that PKCδ is involved in cancer metastasis. Kileyet al. (37Kiley S.C. Clark K.J. Duddy S.K. Welch D.R. Jaken S. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6748-6757Google Scholar) reported that PKCδ phosphorylates cytoskeletal substrate proteins, such as adducin, and plays an important role in migration and attachment. Suppression of the activity of PKCδ in GnT-III transfectants might be involved in decreased metastatic property of GnT-III transfectants observed in B16 mouse melanoma cells (6Yoshimura M. Nishikawa A. Ihara Y. Taniguchi S. Taniguchi N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8754-8758Google Scholar). Further studies will be required to clarify the activation mechanisms of PKCδ in response to ROS and how GnT-III overexpression suppresses H2O2-induced PKCδ activation. One possible mechanism would involve some modification by GnT-III on some molecule(s) or some domain in PKCδ itself, as we suggested for the intracellular domain of epidermal growth factor receptor in GnT-III transfectants (9Sato Y. Takahashi M. Shibukawa Y. Jain S.K. Hamaoka R. Miyagawa J. Yaginuma Y. Honke K. Ishikawa M. Taniguchi N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11956-11962Google Scholar). In summary, we have provided evidence that PKC-JNK1 pathway is involved in H2O2-induced apoptosis in HeLaS3 cells and that the overexpression of GnT-III results in the suppression of H2O2-induced apoptosis through inhibition of PKCδ-JNK1 pathway. The role of N-glycans in signaling pathway has started to be examined from many aspects. It is possible that the suppression of PKC activity by GnT-III overexpression that is observed here shares the same mechanisms underlying other phenomena observed in GnT-III transfectants."
https://openalex.org/W2026204832,"In higher eukaryotes, secretory proteins are under the quality control of the endoplasmic reticulum for their proper folding and release into the secretory pathway. One of the proteins involved in the quality control is protein disulfide isomerase, which catalyzes the formation of protein disulfide bonds. As a first step toward understanding the endoplasmic reticulum quality control of secretory proteins in lower eukaryotes, we have isolated a protein disulfide isomerase gene from the protozoan parasite Leishmania donovani. The parasite enzyme shows high sequence homology with homologs from other organisms. However, unlike the four thioredoxin-like domains found in most protein disulfide isomerases, of which two contain an active site, the leishmanial enzyme possesses only one active site present in a single thioredoxin-like domain. When expressed in Escherichia coli, the recombinant parasite enzyme shows both oxidase and isomerase activities. Replacement of the two cysteins with alanines in its active site results in loss of both enzymatic activities. Further, overexpression of the mutated/inactive form of the parasite enzyme in L. donovani significantly reduced their release of secretory acid phosphatases, suggesting that this single thioredoxin-like domain protein disulfide isomerase could play a critical role in the Leishmania secretory pathway."

The NH2-terminal domain contains a conserved CRIB (Cdc42/Rac interactive binding) motif that mediates Cdc42/Rac binding to PAKs, resulting in their consequent activation (24Burbelo P.D. Drechsel D.

A second PAK-related kinase family, the GCKs (germinal center kinases), comprise highly conserved NH2-terminal kinase domains and less conserved COOH-terminal regulatory domains. Unlike the true PAKs, GCKs do not have CRIB motifs and do not bind Rac/Cdc42 GTPases. GCKs can be subdivided into two groups based on their structural and functional properties. Group I GCKs are most similar to mammalian Gck1 and have homologous carboxyl termini containing at least two PEST motifs, two polyproline SH3 domain binding sites, and an additional ∼350-amino acid highly conserved region (22Kyriakis J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5259-5262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar).

Studies in fission yeast have shown that Sid1, a group II GCK, is essential in mediating cytokinesis, most likely by localizing and phosphorylating downstream targets at spindle pole bodies between anaphase and septation (32Guertin D.A.

The nak1 DNA sequence was determined and has been deposited in the GenBankTM database (accession number AF091345). Techniques used in PCR amplification, restriction digestion, and other cloning procedures have been described previously (39Sambrook J. Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F.

The region encoding the Nak1 catalytic domain was replaced with the ura4 selectable marker in the S. pombe diploid strain SP826 by the gene replacement method as follows (43Rothstein R.J. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 101: 202-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (2033) Google Scholar, 44Russell P. Nurse P. Cell. 1986; 45: 145-153Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar). pNak1ΔUra was derived from pNak1 by replacing the 653-bp BsiWI-NdeI fragment with a 1.8-kb fragment containing ura4. SP826 was transformed with the 6.4-kb XbaI insert of pNak1ΔUra, and Ura+ transformants were selected on PMA + Leu medium. Independent transformants were tested for stability of the Ura+ phenotype, and Southern blot analysis was performed to confirm that they contained the proper disruption in one copy of the endogenousnak1 genes. h90/h+N revertants of these strains, which occur at a frequency of ∼10−3, were detected by the iodine vapor staining test. Diploid strains were analyzed by tetrad analysis. The endogenous nak1 promoter was replaced with the repressible nmt1 promoter in the haploid S. pombestrain RL143. pGEM-nmt1-nak1 was constructed as follows: (i) a 1016-bp fragment was amplified from S. pombe strain RL143 genomic DNA using primers XK3F and B3REV, appended with an additional 3′ dA overhang, and cloned into pGEM-T (Promega) to produce pGEM-3RE; (ii) a 2951-bp ura4/nmt1 promoter fragment, amplified from pREP82x using a XF and KR primers, was cloned intoXhoI/KpnI sites of pGEM-3RE to produce pGEM-3RE/UN; (iii) a 998-bp fragment, amplified from S. pombe (strain RL143) genomic DNA using a X5F and N5REV primers, was inserted into the XhoI/NheI sites of pGEM-3RE/UN. The 4927-bp NotI/SphI DNA fragment from pGEM-nmt1-Nak1 was used to replace the endogenous nak1promoter with the pREP82X nmt1 promoter. S. pombe(strain RL143) was transformed with the nmt1-nak1replacement cassette, and Ura+ transformants were passaged on non-selective minimal medium (PMA with Leu and Ura) to select for stable Ura+ integrants. Southern blot analysis was performed to confirm integration of the nmt1-nak1 regulatory cassette into the correct locus. Actin staining and localization was undertaken according to methods described previously (45Alfa C. Fantes P. Hyams J. McLeod M. Warbrick E. Experiments with Fission Yeast, A Laboratory Course Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1993Google Scholar). pAALNGFPHA-Atb2, encoding GFP-atb2p (α-tubulin 2) was used to visualize microtubule distribution (46Feierbach B. Chang F.

Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 701-712PubMed Google Scholar). nmt1-nak1 cells were grown in the absence or presence of 100 μg/ml thiamine and rapidly fixed in 70% ethanol. Cells were stained with propidium iodide by methods described previously (45Alfa C. Fantes P. Hyams J. McLeod M. Warbrick E. Experiments with Fission Yeast, A Laboratory Course Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1993Google Scholar), analyzed for cell cycle distribution by flow cytometry, and viewed under isothiocyanate optics for DNA staining. Fluorescence micrographs were compared with corresponding DIC images for the presence of dinucleated cells and the presence of a septum. Yeast cultures were grown in minimal medium with adenine (PMA) to saturation in the presence of thiamine (100 μg/ml), washed once with PMA, diluted into thiamine-free medium, and grown to an OD600 = 0.8. Cells were subsequently collected by centrifugation and resuspended in yeast lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 100 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin). Yeast cells were vortexed with glass beads, and crude lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 7000 rpm for 1 min. Relative protein concentrations were subsequently determined by Bio-Rad protein assay. Immunoprecipitation of HA-tagged proteins from yeast cell lysates were undertaken by preclearing equal quantities of yeast cell lysate with protein A-Sepharose slurry for 20 min prior to incubation with 12CA5 (anti-HA) antibody cross-linked to protein A-Sepharose for 2 h at 4 °C. Immune complexes were centrifuged at 6000 rpm and washed three times with yeast lysis buffer (750 μl per wash); samples were divided evenly upon the last wash. Half of the samples were resuspended in SDS-PAGE protein sample buffer, boiled, separated by SDS-PAGE, Western blotted onto nitrocellulose, and probed with 12CA5 antibody to detect HA-epitope tagged proteins. The other half of the immunoprecipitates were resuspended in kinase buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm MnCl2, 5 μCi [γ-32P]ATP, 5 μm ATP, 1 μg of myelin basic protein) and incubated at 30 °C for 25 min. Kinase reactions were terminated by boiling in Laemelli buffer for 5 min, resolved by SDS-PAGE electrophoresis, and stained with Coomassie Blue. The resulting gels were destained, dried, and visualized by autoradiography. We previously identified kinases from a fission yeast cDNA library by PCR using degenerate oligonucleotides derived from conserved regions of kinase catalytic domains as primers (38Sengar A.S. Markley N.A. Marini N.J. Young D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3508-3519Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The PCR products were cloned, and their DNA sequences were determined. One clone we identified encoded a region of a novel kinase that we have named Nak1. We used this clone to generate a probe to screen a S. pombe genomic DNA library, and we identified and determined the DNA sequence of a 7-kb DNA insert containing the entire nak1 gene (see “Experimental Procedures”). The DNA sequence of nak1 revealed three exons encoding a 652-amino acid residue protein that exhibits a high degree of sequence identity with PAKs and is most closely related to the group II GCKs (Fig. 1). Like other GCKs, Nak1 has an NH2-terminal catalytic region containing the PAK GTPY/FWMAPE signature motif and other conserved domains typical of GCKs. In addition, Nak1 contains a 411-residue COOH-terminal non-catalytic domain that does not share significant sequence identity with other proteins. Similar to group II GCKs, Nak1 lacks a CRIB CDC42/RAC-binding motif characteristic of PAKs, or SH3-binding motifs unique to PAKs and group I GCKs. To investigate the function of Nak1, we constructed and examined the phenotypes ofS. pombe strains in which nak1 is deleted. One copy of the nak1 open reading frame was replaced with theura4 selectable marker in a diploid S. pombestrain (see “Experimental Procedures”). Sporulation and tetrad analysis of several independently derived Ura+ diploid strains consistently resulted in two viable Ura− spores, indicating that nak1 is essential for germination and/or cell growth. On closer examination, it was clear that the other two spores in each tetrad had germinated and given rise to microcolonies (2–8 cells) prior to growth arrest. The cells in these small colonies exhibited an abnormal round shape (data not shown). To further investigate the function of Nak1, we generated a strain in which the endogenous nak1 promoter was replaced with the thiamine-repressible nmt1 promoter (see “Experimental Procedures”). We observed that 12 h after addition of thiamine to repress nak1 expression, cells were smaller and more oval-shaped, rather than exhibiting the normal rod-shaped morphology of fission yeast (Fig. 2 A). This indicates that cells have begun to lose normal polarity, but suggests that they still retain sufficient levels of Nak1 to maintain partial cell polarity. Although the small cell size could reflect a reduced G1 phase, this effect appears to be temporary, since many cells become large and completely round by 18 h after addition of thiamine. Also, at the 18-h time point, actin was no longer polarized and was redistributed around the cellular circumference. We also observed that actin still localized to medial sites of division after loss of cell polarity. Also, microtubules, which normally extend along the long axis of cells, are short and appear to be scattered in differing directions within the cell 12 h after nak1repression and subsequently lengthen around the radial axis as cells became round and enlarged 18 h after repression. In addition,nak1-repressed cells exhibited a slow growth phenotype, which was more severe at high temperature and high salt concentration (Fig. 2 B). We also examined cell cycle progression ofnak1-repressed cells by flow cytometry. Actively growing fission yeast spend ∼70% of their time in G2, with a 2C DNA content. Nuclear division occurs in M phase resulting in binucleated cells, which enter the G1 phase of the cell cycle. However, cell division is not normally completed until S phase as DNA replication takes place. Thus, most cells contain 2C DNA content, except during S phase when the DNA content varies between 1C (cells that divide before DNA replication) and 4C (cells that remain undivided after DNA replication) (48Nurse P. Thuriaux P. Exp. Cell Res. 1977; 107: 365-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 49Novak B. Mitchison J.M. J. Cell Sci. 1989; 94: 657-662PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, we found that a large population of cells with greater than 2C DNA content accumulated upon nak1 repression (Fig. 2 C), suggesting a delay in cell division or cell separation until late S phase. This conclusion is further supported by our observation that there is a concomitant increase in the proportion of binucleated cells upon nak1 repression (TableII). Previous reports indicate that ∼10% of wild-type cells are septated/binucleated in a growing culture (50Morrell J.L. Morphew M. Gould K.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 4201-4215Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 51Colussi P.A. Orlean P. Yeast. 1997; 13: 139-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). We observed a similar level ofnmt1-nak1 binucleated cells in the absence of thiamine, but this level increased significantly 12–18 h after the addition of thiamine to repress nak1 expression. A significant proportion of these binucleated cells were septated, implying a delay in cell separation following septa formation. Together, these results indicate that Nak1 is essential for bipolar cell morphology, cell proliferation, and normal cell cycle progression.Table IInak1 repression results in cell division defectsHours after repression2-aA total of n= 355, n = 411 and n = 505 cells were scored for mononucleated and binucleated cells at 0-, 6-, and 18-h time points respectively.% Mononucleate% Binucleate% Total% Septated% No septae09288068317891868322662-a A total of n= 355, n = 411 and n = 505 cells were scored for mononucleated and binucleated cells at 0-, 6-, and 18-h time points respectively. Open table in a new tab To further examine the function and regulation of Nak1, we generated expression constructs containing a series of deletions and specific mutations within the Nak1 coding sequence (Fig. 3), including mutation of the critical ATP-binding region (HA-Nak1K39R) predicted to produce an inactive kinase. We also generated a construct predicted to encode a partially inactive kinase (HA-Nak1T171A) by site-directed mutation of a critical autophosphorylation/activation Thr residue (19Wu C. Whiteway M. Thomas D.Y. Leberer E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15984-15992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). These mutant proteins were detectable in yeast extracts by Western blot analysis using anti-HA antibody, indicating that they were stably expressed (data not shown). We found that overexpression of HA-Nak1 in a normal haploid S. pombe background did not have a significant effect on growth or morphology (data not shown). However, overexpression of either the kinase-inactive mutant (HA-Nak1K39R) or the non-catalytic domain of Nak1 (HA-Nak1262–652) produced a round morphology similar to that resulting from nak1 repression (Fig. 4 A), suggesting that these mutant proteins act in a dominant-negative manner to block endogenous Nak1 function. Furthermore, overexpression of the partially inactive mutant HA-Nak1T171A produced a similar dominant-negative morphological effect (data not shown). These morphological aberrations are also associated with slow growth at high temperature and high salt concentration (35 °C, 1.2 m KCl) (Fig. 4 B).Figure 4Overexpression of the Nak1 CTR results in dominant-negative growth and morphological phenotypes. A, wild-type (RL143) cells expressing the indicated mutant Nak1 proteins under the control of the thiamine-repressiblenmt1 promoter were grown on thiamine-free medium for 3 days at 30 °C and examined by DIC microscopy. B, RL143 cells expressing the indicated mutant Nak1 proteins were also grown on thiamine-free medium at 35 °C for 7 days in the presence of 1.2m KCl. Expression plasmids used for A andB were pREP3XHA (control), pREP3XHA-Nak1K39R, pREP3XHA-Nak11–562, K39R, pREP3XGFPHA-Nak1262–652, pREP3XGFPHA-Nak1262–562, and pREP3XGFPHA-Nak1554–652.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The causative region of Nak1 producing these dominant-negative morphological and proliferative phenotypes was mapped to the COOH-terminal end (residues 554–652), which we refer to as the CTR (COOH-terminal region). Expression of the CTR (HA-Nak1554–652) alone was sufficient to produce a dominant-negative morphological phenotype, while cells expressing the Nak1 non-catalytic domain lacking the CTR (HA-Nak262–562) appeared normal (Fig. 4 A). Moreover, expression of kinase-inactive Nak1 (HA-Nak1K39R), the non-catalytic domain (HA-Nak1262–652), or the CTR (HA-Nak1481–652) resulted in severe growth inhibition at high temperature and high salt concentration (35 °C, 1.2m KCl), but cells expressing the kinase-inactive mutant lacking the CTR (HA-Nak11–562, K39R) or the non-catalytic domain lacking the CTR (HA-Nak1262–562) were able to grow under these conditions (Fig. 4 B). In summary, these results suggest that overexpression of the CTR abrogates endogenous Nak1 activity resulting in dominant-negative phenotypes. Expression of HA-Nak1 results in full reversion of morphological and slow growth phenotypes associated with nak1 repression innmt1-nak1 strains (Fig. 5, A and B). However, expression of the partially inactive mutant (HA-Nak1T171A) or Nak1 lacking the CTR (HA-Nak11–562) only partially rescued the morphological and slow growth phenotypes. These results suggest that both kinase activity and the CTR are important for Nak1 function. To further examine the role of the CTR, we expressed HA-Nak1 and HA-Nak11–562 in a wild-type S. pombe strain, immunoprecipitated the HA-tagged proteins from cell extracts, and performed in vitro kinase assays. We found that immunoprecipitated HA-Nak1 exhibited a detectable level of autophosphorylation and phosphorylation of myelin basic protein, whereas deletion of the CTR resulted in a significant decrease in kinase activity, indicating that the CTR is critical for Nak1 kinase activity in vitro (Fig. 5 C). Together, our evidence implicates the CTR as an important regulatory sequence and suggests that Nak1 may be regulated by the association of key factors with the CTR. To examine the localization of Nak1 we constructed vectors to express GFP-tagged Nak1 from the adh1 promoter. Expression of GFP-Nak1 rescued growth and morphological defects in nak1-repressed strains, indicating that it is functional (data not shown). Visualization of various GFP-Nak1 mutants expressed in wild-type cells revealed that GFP-Nak1, GFP-Nak11–562 (lacking the CTR), GFP-Nak1481–652 (the CTR alone), and the GFP control localized throughout the cytoplasm (Fig. 6). Although other kinases, which regulate cell polarity in fission yeast, localize to cell ends in the presence of high salt (52Rupes I. Jia Z. Young P.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 1495-1510Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), GFP-Nak1 localization was observed to be unaffected in the presence of 1.2 m KCl (data not shown). Interestingly, we found that GFP-Nak1 and GFP-Nak11–562were excluded from the nucleus, whereas the GFP control and GFP-Nak1481–652 constructs localized throughout the cell including the nucleus. However, GFP-Nak1481–652 was consistently more concentrated around the nucleus. Although the significance of this observation is unclear, it may reflect active cellular mechanisms that exclude Nak1 from the nucleus and localize the Nak1 CTR to regions around the nucleus. In this study, we report the identification and characterization of the Nak1, a protein kinase in S. pombe. The lack of proline-rich SH3-binding motifs within the COOH-terminal non-catalytic domain of Nak1 indicates that Nak1 belongs to the group II subclass of GCKs. In addition to Nak1, the fission yeast genome encodes two related GCK family kinases, which include Sid1 and an uncharacterized protein kinase (accession number CAB16374 ) lacking a non-catalytic domain. Although the three GCK family members in S. pombe reveal extensive homology within their catalytic regions, it was unknown whether these kinases are functionally related. Sid1 has been previously shown to be involved in the regulation of septation and cytokinesis during the later stages of anaphase. In contrast, our results indicate that Nak1 is required for cell polarity and growth, suggesting that Nak1 and Sid1 have distinct functions. In support of this conclusion, we found that overexpression of Sid1, or the related budding yeast GC kinases Nrk1 or Sps1, failed to rescue morphology and growth defects in nak1-repressed cells, indicating that Nak1 function is not conserved between related family members (data not shown). However, our results also suggest that nak1repression results in a delay in cell division and cell separation, which indicate that proper cell division requires both Nak1 and Sid1. Although the round morphology due to nak1 repression is somewhat similar to cells defective for the Wee1 kinase,nak1-repressed cells are more spherical and larger thanwee1 mutant cells. Also, we found thatnak1-repressed cells lose specific localization of actin to the cell ends, whereas Wee1-deficient cells retain bipolar actin localization (10Verde F. Wiley D.J. Nurse P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7526-7531Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Wee1 deficiency results in a greater proportion of cells with 1C DNA content due to a longer G1phase, which allows cells to divide prior to S phase (48Nurse P. Thuriaux P. Exp. Cell Res. 1977; 107: 365-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 49Novak B. Mitchison J.M. J. Cell Sci. 1989; 94: 657-662PubMed Google Scholar). We did not observe a similar increase in the proportion of cells with 1C DNA content upon nak1 repression. Thus the abnormal round morphology of nak1-repressed cells appears to be due to dysregulation of cell polarity rather than a wee1-like defect. Interestingly, the round morphological phenotype associated with nak1 repression bears strong resemblance to the morphology of cells deficient for Pak1 (29Yang P. Kansra S. Pimental R.A. Gilbreth M. Marcus S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18481-18489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), suggesting that Nak1 and Pak1 may have related functions in the regulation of bipolar cell morphology. However, we found that overexpression of Pak1/Shk1, Orb6, or Wee1 did not suppress growth and morphology defects associated withnak1 repression (data not shown). Several proteins have been identified that appear to be involved in regulating polarized cell growth in fission yeast. Many of these proteins, such as Tea1, Bud6, SspI, and Pom1, localize to the growing cell ends (8Mata J. Nurse P. Cell. 1997; 89: 939-949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar, 11Bahler J. Pringle J.R.

Although our genetic studies suggest that Nak1 is required for polarized cell morphology, we found that GFP-Nak1 did not exhibit specific localization to the cell ends. However, GFP-Nak1 overexpression could mask low levels specifically localized to the cell ends. Nevertheless, it is possible that Nak1 influences the localization of other cell polarity components to specific sites, such as sites of growth and division. Also, since Nak1 localization overlaps with sites of cell growth and division, it may regulate the activities of cell polarity components already present at these sites. Therefore, Nak1 may regulate cell polarity and growth by influencing the localization and activities of other proteins involved in these processes. Although the COOH-terminal non-catalytic domains of GCKs have been implicated to both inhibit and mediate GCK function, the mechanism by which these domains regulate kinase activity remains unclear (34Guertin D.A. McCollum D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28185-28189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 35Creasy C.L. Ambrose D.M. Chernoff J. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4537-4546Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Our results demonstrate that a region (the CTR) within the non-kinase domain of Nak1 is important for Nak1 function as measured by in vitro kinase assays and functional complementation of nak1-repressed growth and morphological defects. Furthermore, overexpression of the CTR produced dominant-negative morphological and growth inhibitory phenotypes. This dominant-negative effect may result from the ineffectual binding of positive regulators of Nak1 to the CTR. Together, our results indicate that Nak1 is essential for cell growth, polarity, and normal cell division, and the CTR is important for Nak1 function. Further studies of the interactions between Nak1 and associated proteins may provide insight into the regulation of Nak1-dependent morphogenic mechanisms.

Nuclear transport in eukaryotic cells is triggered by specific transport signals that are recognized by soluble receptors that interact with the nuclear pore complexes. Nuclear import is mediated by nuclear localization signals present in nuclear proteins. In the case of classical basic nuclear localization signals, this process involves the importin α and importin β proteins, whose function is regulated by Ran GTPase (38Nigg E.A. Nature. 1997; 386: 779-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (921) Google Scholar, 39Görlich D. Mattaj I.W. Science. 1996; 271: 1513-1518Crossref PubMed Scopus (1067) Google Scholar). Like import, nuclear export is mediated by specific signals known as nuclear export signals (NESs).1 There are two relatively well defined exportins that transport proteins: CAS and CRM1. These receptors associate in the nucleus with their export substrates in the presence of Ran-GTP forming trimeric export complexes that are then transferred to the cytoplasm (40Yoneda Y. Genes Cells. 2000; 5: 777-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Human CRM1 binds leucine-rich NESs found in different proteins such as Rev, mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 1, cAMP-dependent protein kinase inhibitor, and cyclin B (41Toyoshima F.

In our previous studies, which focused on the identification of signals involved in differential intracellular localization of proteins 4.1R (33Luque C.M. Lallena M.J. Alonso M.A. Correas I. J. Biol.

Correas I. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 2485-2495PubMed Google Scholar). Because 4.1R isoforms expressing exon 5 are predominantly localized in the cytoplasm (34Luque C.M. Correas I. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 2485-2495PubMed Google Scholar), in this study we have aimed to identify the amino acid sequence that is responsible for this effect. We show here that exon 5 encodes a leucine-rich sequence resembling a NES. This sequence and, more specifically, two leucine residues that are also conserved in NESs are necessary for 4.1R cytoplasmic localization and for 4.1R binding to the export receptor CRM1. COS-7 cells were used for transient cDNA expression, immunofluorescence, and biochemical analyses. The cells were grown as described (33Luque C.M. Lallena M.J. Alonso M.A. Correas I. J. Biol.

The beads were then recovered by gentle centrifugation and washed with binding buffer. The beads were subsequently incubated with candidate proteins in a final volume of 100 μl for 60 min at 4 °C. The beads were recovered by gentle centrifugation and washed four times with 1 ml of binding buffer. The bound proteins were eluted by the addition of 1 ml of 1 m MgCl2, and the eluted proteins were precipitated with isopropanol. The protein pellets were resuspended in Laemmli (48Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207538) Google Scholar) sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot. To study the role that the exon 5-encoded sequence plays in 4.1R intracellular distribution, we prepared different cDNA fusion constructs in which the sequence coding for GFP was appended at the 3′ end of 4.1R coding sequences (Fig. 1). Transfection experiments were performed in COS-7 cells and the distribution patterns of the expressed proteins were analyzed 48 h post-transfection by fluorescence microscopy. Cells expressing only GFP had intense nuclear staining with some fluorescence also detected in the cytoplasm (Fig. 2 A and TableI). Cells expressing a fusion protein containing the complete amino acid sequence of a nuclear 4.1R isoform that lacked expression of exon 5 (4.1R60Δ16,18-GFP) also showed predominant nuclear staining (Fig. 2 B and Table I). By contrast, cells expressing a 4.1R isoform containing the sequence encoded by exon 5 (4.1R80Δ16-GFP) presented predominantly cytoplasmic staining (Fig. 2 C and Table I). Consistently, appending the 35 amino acids encoded by exon 5 to GFP (E5-GFP) also resulted in an increase in the number of cells showing cytoplasmic fluorescence (Fig. 2 D and Table I).Figure 2Effect of the exon 5-encoded sequence of 4.1R on the subcellular localization of GFP.

NES sequences are short sequence motifs that are necessary and sufficient to mediate the nuclear export of large proteins (38Nigg E.A. Nature. 1997; 386: 779-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (921) Google Scholar, 39Görlich D. Mattaj I.W. Science. 1996; 271: 1513-1518Crossref PubMed Scopus (1067) Google Scholar, 50Wada A. Fukuda M. Mishima M. Nishida E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1635-1641Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Important for their function is a characteristic spacing of hydrophobic residues, mainly leucine or isoleucine (38Nigg E.A. Nature. 1997; 386: 779-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (921) Google Scholar, 39Görlich D. Mattaj I.W. Science. 1996; 271: 1513-1518Crossref PubMed Scopus (1067) Google Scholar). Analysis of the amino acid sequence coded by exon 5 allowed the identification of a hydrophobic region, L26LKRVCEHLNLL, which is significantly similar to leucine-rich NES sequences (Fig. 3 A). The key hydrophobic residues shown to be important for NES function in other proteins (51Kim F.J. Beeche A.A. Hunter J.J. Chin D.J. Hope T.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5147-5155Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar,52Bogerd H.P. Fridell R.A. Benson R.E. Hua J. Cullen B.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4207-4214Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar) are also found in the putative NES in 4.1R and correspond to Leu34 and Leu36 (numbered as in the erythroid 4.1R sequence reported in Ref. 10Conboy J.G. Chan J.Y. Chasis J.A. Kan Y.W. Mohandas N. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8273-8280Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The crystal structure of the N-terminal 30-kDa domain of erythroid 4.1R comprising exon-5-encoded sequence has been determined (53Han B.G. Nunomura W. Takakuwa Y. Mohandas N. Jap B.K. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 871-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). From the tertiary structure it may be inferred that the 4.1R hydrophobic sequence, L26LKRVCEHLNLL, adopts an α-helix conformation (Fig. 3 D). Leu36 is exposed on one side of the α-helix, whereas Leu34 and the hydrophobic residues Leu26 and Val30 are exposed on the opposite side (Fig. 3 B). A similar topology has been described for other NES (50Wada A. Fukuda M. Mishima M. Nishida E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1635-1641Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 54Jacobs M.D. Harrison S.C.

Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 86-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), such as that of protein p53, in which Leu350 is located on one side of the α-helix, whereas Leu348 and the hydrophobic residues Met340 and Leu344 appear on the opposite side (Fig. 3 C). Mutation of two critical hydrophobic amino acids within NES sequences has been shown to affect the function of NES in many proteins (51Kim F.J. Beeche A.A. Hunter J.J. Chin D.J. Hope T.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5147-5155Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 52Bogerd H.P. Fridell R.A. Benson R.E. Hua J. Cullen B.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4207-4214Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). We next investigated whether mutations of the two conserved and presumably critical hydrophobic amino acids within the 4.1R leucine-rich sequence also affect 4.1R subcellular distribution. COS-7 cells were transfected with either a cDNA coding the wild-type protein for the expression of the leucine-rich sequence (4.1R80Δ16) or a cDNA encoding a protein with Leu34 and Leu36replaced by Ala34 and Gln36 within the leucine-rich sequence (4.1R80Δ16NESmut). The subcellular distribution of the expressed proteins, tagged with c-Myc sequences at the C terminus, was determined by staining with antibody 9E10. Wild-type 4.1R80Δ16 protein had a predominantly cytoplasmic distribution (Fig. 4 A and Table I) with a small percentage of the transfected cells containing the expressed protein in the nucleus and cytoplasm (Table I). By contrast, protein 4.1R80Δ16NESmut was predominantly distributed in the nucleus (Fig. 4 B and Table I). An explanation for the results obtained for the mutated 4.1R protein could be that it is first directed to the nucleus via its core region (34Luque C.M. Correas I. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 2485-2495PubMed Google Scholar) and that once there it cannot be exported to the cytoplasm because the two mutated hydrophobic amino acids, Leu34 and Leu36, are essential for nuclear export. The predicted folding of the mutant was determined using as template the crystallographic coordinates of the 4.1R80 FERM domain (53Han B.G. Nunomura W. Takakuwa Y. Mohandas N. Jap B.K. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 871-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) deposited in the Protein Data Bank (accession number 1GG3) and the FOLD-X computer algorithm (56Guerois R. Nielsen J.E. Serrano L. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 320: 369-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (1347) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3 E). Substitution of Leu34 and Leu36by Ala34 and Gln36 is not predicted to cause perturbation of folding and is slightly favorable to protein stability (the free energy of folding is 52.32 kcal·mol−1 for the wild type versus 52.14 kcal·mol−1 for the mutant). It is very unlikely that the results described above for the mutant are due to perturbation of folding. Isoform 4.1R80Δ5,16, which is similar to 4.1R80Δ16 except for lacking exon 5-encoded sequences, also accumulates in the nucleus (Fig. 4 C and Table I). All of these results indicate that although wild-type 4.1R80Δ16 is found predominantly in the cytoplasm, either the mutation in the leucine-rich sequence or the deletion of exon 5 clearly resulted in the accumulation of the protein in the nucleus. Thus, the leucine-rich sequence and, more specifically, amino acids Leu34 and Leu36 play a pivotal role in 4.1R cytoplasmic distribution in COS-7 cells. The binding site of band 3 to 4.1R consists of the L37EEDY sequence that is adjacent to the NES (57Jöns T. Drenckhahn D. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2863-2867Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Mutation of L37EEDY to S37RAGN (protein 4.1R80Δ16LEEDYmut), unlike 4.1R80Δ16NESmut, did give rise to predominant cytoplasmic staining of 4.1R80Δ16LEEDYmut(Fig. 4 D and Table I). The capacity of protein 4.1R80Δ16 to be exported from the nucleus was analyzed by injecting recombinant protein GST-4.1R80Δ16 intoXenopus laevis oocyte nuclei and processing the samples as described (58Koffa M.D. Clements J.B. Izaurralde E. Wadd S. Wilson S.A. Mattaj I.W. Kuersten S. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5769-5778Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). At 3 h post-injection, most of the protein GST-4.1R80Δ16 was detected in the cytoplasmic fraction supporting nuclear export of 4.1R80Δ16 (data not shown). The mutant protein GST-4.1R80Δ16NESmut was also detected in the cytoplasmic fraction. This unexpected result suggests that 4.1R contains additional nuclear export signal(s) that appear(s) to be functional in the X. laevis oocyte system. Proteins containing a leucine-rich NES are recognized in the nucleus by the exportin CRM1 and form a trimeric complex with RanGTP, which is exported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm (40Yoneda Y. Genes Cells. 2000; 5: 777-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). We investigated whether 4.1R80Δ16 associates with CRM1 in the RanGTP-dependent manner characteristic of export substrates. zz-tagged CRM1 was bound to IgG-Sepharose and incubated with the different substrates used in the binding assays. Bead-bound material was eluted from the column and processed as indicated under “Experimental Procedures.” A functional export substrate containing the NES of Rev fused to the C terminus of GST (GST-RevNES) (45Englmeier L. Olivo J.C. Mattaj I.W. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 30-41Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 49Englmeier L. Fornerod M. Bischoff F.R. Petosa C. Mattaj I.W. Kutay U. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 926-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) and an export-deficient control substrate containing a disrupted NES of Rev (GST-M10) were used as positive and negative controls, respectively. All of the binding assays were performed in the absence and presence of RanGTP. GST-RevNES bound efficiently to zz-CRM1, in a RanGTP-dependent manner (Fig. 5, compare lanes 1 and2). Similarly, GST-4.1R80Δ16 bound to CRM1 in a RanGTP-dependent manner (Fig. 5, compare lanes 5 and 6). By contrast, the export deficient control (GST-M10) and the 4.1R mutant in the leucine-rich sequence (GST-4.1R80Δ16NESmut) did not bind to CRM1 even in the presence of RanGTP (Fig. 5, lanes 3 and4 and lanes 7 and 8, respectively). The RanGTP-dependent binding of CRM1 to GST-4.1R80Δ16 but not to GST-4.1R80Δ16NESmut was more clearly revealed by Western blot analysis (Fig. 5, lanes 9–12). In recent years, our view of strict compartmentalization of nuclear and non-nuclear components has been challenged as plasma membrane (59Lin S.Y. Makino K. Xia W. Matin A. Wen Y. Kwong K.Y. Bourguignon L. Hung M.C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 802-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (903) Google Scholar), tight junction (60Gonzalez-Mariscal L. Betanzos A. Avila-Flores A. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 11: 315-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar), endocytic (61Vecchi M. Polo S. Poupon V. van de Loo J.W. Benmerah A. Di Fiore P.P. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 1511-1517Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), and cytoskeletal (50Wada A. Fukuda M. Mishima M. Nishida E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1635-1641Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar) proteins have been described in the nucleus. Moreover, proteins interacting with 4.1R and with predominant extranuclear localization and function have recently been detected in the nucleus. One of these proteins is actin, which is a ubiquitous, essential cytoskeletal protein and is therefore like 4.1R80Δ16 with a predominant cytoplasmic localization at steady state. Actin contains two functional NES that mediate its nuclear export in a CRM1-mediated manner. However, the physiological relevance of the shuttling of actin between the nucleus and cytoplasm is not known (50Wada A. Fukuda M. Mishima M. Nishida E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1635-1641Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). ZO-1 interacts with 4.1R in cell tight junctions (24Mattagajasingh S.N. Huang S.C. Hartenstein J.S. Benz E.J., Jr. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30573-30585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), and ZO-1 has been shown to accumulate in the nucleus in a cell density-dependent fashion (60Gonzalez-Mariscal L. Betanzos A. Avila-Flores A. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 11: 315-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). hCASK interacts with 4.1R, establishing a link between the extracellular matrix and the cortical actin cytoskeleton (21Cohen A.R. Woods D.F. Marfatia S.M. Walther Z. Chishti A.H. Anderson J.M. Wood D.F. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 129-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). It has been reported that hCASK directly enters the nucleus and thereby regulates gene expression (62Bredt D.S. Nature. 2000; 404: 241-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Conversely, a 4.1R-interacting protein, the nuclear splicing factor U2AF35 (22Lallena M.J. Martı́nez C. Valcárcel J. Correas I. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 1963-1971Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), has recently been shown to shuttle from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, but its role in the cytoplasm remains to be elucidated (63Gama-Carvalho M. Carvalho M.P. Kehlenbach A. Valcarcel J. Carmo-Fonseca M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13104-13112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). This study shows that 4.1R isoforms expressing exon 5 contain a leucine-rich sequence that shares key features with NESs known to trigger the rapid, active delivery of proteins and RNA-protein complexes from the nucleus to the cytoplasm (39Görlich D. Mattaj I.W. Science. 1996; 271: 1513-1518Crossref PubMed Scopus (1067) Google Scholar, 40Yoneda Y. Genes Cells. 2000; 5: 777-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 64Nakielny S. Dreyfuss G. Cell. 1999; 99: 677-690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar). Thus, the key hydrophobic residues important for NES function in other proteins are also found to be essential in 4.1R, and the topology adopted for the NES of proteins such as p53 (55Mittl P.R. Chene P. Grutter M.G. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 86-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) or actin (50Wada A. Fukuda M. Mishima M. Nishida E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1635-1641Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar) is similar to that adopted for 4.1R (53Han B.G. Nunomura W. Takakuwa Y. Mohandas N. Jap B.K. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 871-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Moreover, the leucine-rich sequence is required for 4.1R binding to CRM1 in a RanGTP-dependent fashion. Our previous studies on signals involved in 4.1R differential intracellular localization showed that all 4.1R molecules have a common region, designated the core region, involved in their nuclear targeting (34Luque C.M. Correas I. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 2485-2495PubMed Google Scholar). However, in this study we show that 4.1R isoforms expressing exon 5 contain a leucine-rich sequence that predominantly excludes them from the cell nuclei. A third signal comprising basic amino acids coded by the alternative exon 16 have also been involved in 4.1R nuclear targeting (33Luque C.M. Lallena M.J. Alonso M.A. Correas I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11643-11649Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 36Gascard P. Nunomura W. Lee G. Walensky L.D. Krauss S.W. Takakuwa Y. Chasis J.A. Mohandas N. Conboy J.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 1783-1798Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Finally, a fourth region mediating 4.1R intracellular localization is the 209-amino acid head piece (HP) of high molecular weight 4.1R135 isoforms that inhibits nuclear targeting of 4.1R (37Luque C.M. Lallena M.J. Pérez-Ferreiro C.M. de Isidro Y., De Cárcer G. Alonso M.A. Correas I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14925-14930Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The complexity of signals and regions identified to date as being involved in 4.1R nuclear and cytoplasmic distribution and the hierarchical fashion in which they regulate the intracellular localization of 4.1R are summarized in Fig. 6 A. Fig. 6 Brepresents schematically possible models for the intracellular traffic experienced by different 4.1R isoforms. A first group of 4.1R80 isoforms containing the constitutive core region but lacking the alternative leucine-rich sequence is directed to the nucleus by a mechanism that has yet to be elucidated. This group would be comprised of the nuclear set of 4.1R isoforms (Fig. 6 B,panel a). A second group of 4.1R80 isoforms contains the leucine-rich sequence, and these enter the nucleus via the core region and might bind to CRM1-RanGTP to be exported to the cytoplasm (Fig. 6 B, panel b). A third group of 4.1R80 isoforms expresses exon 16, and they enter the nucleus by binding to human importin α2, Rch1 (36Gascard P. Nunomura W. Lee G. Walensky L.D. Krauss S.W. Takakuwa Y. Chasis J.A. Mohandas N. Conboy J.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 1783-1798Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) (Fig. 6 B, panel c). Finally, a fourth group of 4.1R135 isoforms contains the HP domain that inhibits nuclear targeting of 4.1R (37Luque C.M. Lallena M.J. Pérez-Ferreiro C.M. de Isidro Y., De Cárcer G. Alonso M.A. Correas I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14925-14930Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The HP domain might adopt a conformation masking the regions involved in 4.1R nuclear targeting. However, an association between the HP domain and a cytoplasmic partner could also account for this effect (Fig. 6 B, panel d). Thus, there must be orchestrated regulatory mechanisms controlling the traffic of specific 4.1R isoforms to play distinct roles in different compartments. We do not know the physiological role that 4.1R isoforms containing the leucine-rich sequence play in nucleated cells, and it is rather speculative, therefore, to propose possible cytoplasmic or nuclear roles. If the presence of 4.1R80Δ16 in the cell nucleus has deleterious consequences for the cell, it is possible that the function of the leucine-rich sequence of 4.1R is to control the access of 4.1R to nuclear components. Alternatively, the sequence may be important for maintaining the cytoplasmic localization of a putative binding partner that would otherwise gain access to the nucleus to carry out specific functions. Lastly, 4.1R80Δ16 may transit to the nucleus to deliver a nuclear component, either protein or RNA, to the cytoplasm. Protein 4.1R80Δ16, and other 4.1R isoforms expressing exon 5, may be candidates for participation in the relay of information between the cytoplasm/plasma membrane and the nucleus. Investigation of the functions of 4.1R isoforms containing the leucine-rich sequence will provide new insights into this multifunctional protein.

In addition, p73-deficient mice do not present spontaneous tumors, suggesting a limited role of p73 in tumor suppression (14Yang A. Walker N. Bronson R. Kaghad M. Oosterwgel M. Bonnin J. Vagner C.

Although the phenotypes of p53- and p73-deficient mice differ, the related gene products share trans-activation function of certain pro-apoptotic p53 target genes including BAX,p21, MDM2, and GADD45 (15Kaghad M. Bonnet H. Yang A. Creancier L. Biscan J.C. Valent A. Minty A. Chalon P. Lelias J.M. Dumont X. Ferrara P. McKeon F. Caput D.

However, p73 does not regulate all p53 target genes in the same manner as p53. For example, pro-apoptotic PIGs andKILLER/DR5 genes do not respond at all or as well to exogenously expressed p73 in H1299 cells (16Zhu J. Jiang J. Zhou W. Chen X. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 5061-5065PubMed Google Scholar). The primary structure of p73 diverges from that of p53 by the inclusion of an extended carboxyl terminus greater than 200 amino acids containing a sterile α-motif (15Kaghad M. Bonnet H. Yang A.

Interactions with other proteins through this oligomerization domain could result in the variability of trans-regulatory functions. Differences in the ability of p73 to activate p53 target genes may also rely on cell-specific post-translational modifications of the protein. Recent reports have shown that p73 trans-activation of p53 targets genes is cell type-dependent (15Kaghad M. Bonnet H. Yang A. Creancier L. Biscan J.C. Valent A. Minty A. Chalon P. Lelias J.M.

The ability of p73 to induce apoptosis is also dependent on cellular context. The p73 gene product is necessary for T-cell receptor-activated induced cell death in primary T-cells and pro-apoptotic in SaOs-2 cells, whereas in developing sympathetic neurons, p73 plays an anti-apoptotic role (1Lissy N.A.

The silencing of the p73 gene in various cancers including neuroblastoma, squamous cell carcinoma, lung, and Burkitt's lymphoma supports the labeling of p73 as a tumor suppressor (27Corn P.G.

However, in some cancers including B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia, ovarian, bladder, and breast, p73 gene expression is elevated in comparison with the respective cells of origin, suggesting that p73 functions in tumor progression (30Mai M.

Although, the role of p73 in oncogenesis remains elusive, it is evident that the complex nature of p73 involvement is cell context-dependent and varies from that of its family member p53. Of particular interest for this study was the role of p73 in the regulation of p53 target gene p21 in lymphoma cells. As a cell cycle-dependent kinase inhibitor, p21 plays a major role in cell cycle regulation at the G1/S checkpoint. As reported recently (36Hingorani R., Bi, B. Dao T. Bae Y. Matsuzawa A. Crispe I.N. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 4032-4036Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), p21 also functions in T-cell homeostasis through involvement in CD95-induced apoptosis. Although p53 is mutated and protein levels are undetectable in the lymphoblastoma T-cell line Jurkat, p21 expression remains inducible during T-cell activation (37Cheng J. Haas M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 21: 5520-5530Google Scholar). Reported herein is the unexpected finding that p73 does not compensate for this p53 deficiency at the p21promoter. In fact, not only is p73 incapable of inducing thep21 gene in Jurkat cells, it acts as a dominant negative repressor of p53-dependent transcription and apoptosis in a cell type- and promoter-specific manner. Moreover, this cell-specific divergence in p73 function is associated with cell-restricted post-translational modifications of p73. HA1-p73 (α,β,γ) and p53 expression plasmids were described previously (38De Laurenzi V. Costanzo A. Barcaroli D. Terrininoni A. Falco M. Annicchiarico-Petruzzelli M. Levrero M. Melino G. J. Exp.

Jurkat T-cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 media containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 100 units/ml penicillin and streptomycin (Gemini, Invitrogen) at 37 °C, 5% CO2 in 2-liter tissue culture roller bottles with rotation. Transfections of Jurkat T-cells were carried out by electroporation using the BTX ECM 830 electroporator (Genetronics, Inc.). Twenty million cells in 400 μl of RPMI 1640 medium were electroporated in a 0.4-cm gap electroporation cuvette at 260 mV for a 50-ms pulse. For apoptosis studies involving evaluation of active caspase-3 levels, Jurkat T-cells were transfected using the AMAXA Biosystems NucleofectorTM device (program A23) following the manufacturer's instructions for human T-cells. As indicated, 50 ng/ml phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) (Sigma) and 720 ng/ml ionomycin (Calbiochem) were added to cells 1-h post-electroporation. A2870 ovarian cancer cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 media containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 0.1 unit/ml insulin at 37 °C, 5% CO2. SaOs-2 osteosarcoma cells were maintained in McCoy's media (Invitrogen) containing 15% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C, 5% CO2. A2870 and SaOS-2 cells were transfected using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent following the manufacturer's instructions (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The ratio of plasmid DNA to FuGENE 6 reagent used was 1:3. Jurkat T-cells were transferred to Falcon 2052 tubes and centrifuged at 500 × g for 8 min at room temperature. The medium was aspirated off, and cells were washed with PBS. After centrifugation, PBS was aspirated and cell pellets were resuspended in 150 μl of reporter lysis buffer (Promega). Adherent cells were harvested by aspirating media and washing cells with PBS three times. 200 μl of reporter lysis buffer were added to the wells, and the cells were scraped. Cell lysates were transferred to 96 conical well plates (NUNC) and frozen on dry ice or at −80 °C. Lysates were thawed at room temperature, and then the plate was centrifuged at 4000 rpm in a Sorvall RC5B Plus plate rotor at 4 °C. After a 20-min centrifugation, 20 μl of supernatant were transferred to an opaque 96-flat bottom well plate (NUNC). One hundred microliters of luciferase substrate (Promega) were injected into each well, and the fluorochromic reaction was analyzed by a Microplate Luminometer LB96V (EG+G Berthold). Aliquots of lysis supernatant were transferred to a standard 96-well plate for protein concentration reading using Bio-Rad protein dye reagent following manufacturer's instructions. Luciferase values were normalized to protein concentration. Mouse antibodies against HA epitope were purchased from Covance. Mouse anti-human p53 antibody, anti-p21 antibody, and anti-caspase-3 antibody were obtained from BD Biosciences. Secondary anti-mouse antibodies conjugated with horseradish peroxidase or Alexa Fluor® 594 were purchased fromAmersham Biosciences and Molecular Probes, respectively. Jurkat T-cells were transfected with 2 μg of p53, 10 μg of HA-p73α, or both expression plasmids. The amount of plasmid DNA added to each transfection was kept constant by the addition of pcDNA3.1+. Multiple transfections with the same plasmid DNA were pooled and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C, and then the cells were centrifuged at 400 × g for 5 min, the medium was removed, and the cells were resuspended in fresh medium. The cell suspension was underlaid with 3 ml of Ficoll and centrifuged at 400 ×g for 45 min at room temperature. The interface layer of live cells was removed, washed once in fresh medium, and resuspended in RPMI 1640 medium containing 50 ng/ml PMA. After a 7-h incubation, cells were centrifuged at 400 × g and then washed three times with ice-cold PBS. Cells next were resuspended in 5 volumes of Buffer A (hypotonic lysis buffer) containing 4 mmβ-mercaptoethanol and 1:200 dilution of protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma). After a 10-min incubation on ice, cells were homogenized with 16 passes of a Craftsman power drill-driven Teflon pestle. Homogenate was collected and centrifuged at 1540 ×g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant cytosolic fraction was collected, and the nuclear pellet was resuspended in Buffer D (20% glycerol, 20 mm HEPES, 0.2 mm EDTA) containing 4 mm BME and 1:200 dilution of protease inhibitor mixture. Ammonium sulfate was added to a final concentration of 0.3m. The nuclear suspension was incubated with rocking for 45 min at 4 °C and then spun at 100,000 × g for 45 min. The supernatant was immediately recovered and stored at −80 °C. Protein concentrations of extracts were obtained using Bio-Rad protein assay reagent, and the extracts were tested for exogenous protein expression by Western blot analysis. For preparation of the DNA-coated beads, PCR was performed using human genomic DNA as template and the following oligonucleotide pairs: p21 (3351–3792, segment C), 5′-[bioTEG]TTCAGGCACAGAAAGGAGGCAAG-3′ and 5′-CCTGAACAGAAGAAACCCCTGTGGT-3′; p21 (2693–3244, segment B), 5′-[bioTEG]ATTGAATGTCGTGGTGGTGGTGAGC-3′ and 5′-catctcaggctgctcagagtctgga-3′; and p21 (2260–2717, segment A), 5′-[bioTEG]TTGGGCAGCAGGCTGTGGCT-3′ and 5′-GCTCACCACCACCACGACATTCA-3′. One microgram of the resulting PCR products was incubated with 100 μl of Neutravidin bead slurry (Pierce), which had been previously blocked in blocking buffer (PBS, 1 mg/ml BSA, 1× casein solution (Vector), 0.5% Tween 20) and then maintained in binding buffer (10 mm HEPES, 60 mm NaCl, 20% glycerol, 4 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, protease inhibitor mixture). After vortexing for 2 h at room temperature, the slurry was centrifuged at 300 × g, and the supernatant was removed. To ensure that beads were saturated with DNA, the supernatant was analyzed for DNA by agarose gel electrophoresis. The DNA-coated beads were washed twice with binding buffer and then stored as a 50% slurry in binding buffer at 4 °C. The indicated amounts of programmed nuclear extracts were mixed with 100 μl of bead slurry in binding buffer containing 1× casein solution for 2 h with vortexing at room temperature. The bead suspension was sedimented at 300 × g, and the supernatant was removed. The beads were washed with 750 μl of binding buffer and then resuspended in 400 μl of binding buffer. The bead suspension was overlaid upon a 450-μl sucrose cushion (20% sucrose, 200 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20 in Buffer D). The gradient was centrifuged at 500 × g for 10 min. The supernatant and sucrose cushion were carefully aspirated, and the beads were washed once with binding buffer. SDS-PAGE loading buffer was added to the beads, and proteins associated with the bead-bound DNA were detected by Western blot analysis. Cells were transfected with 2 μg of p53, 10 μg of HA-p73, or both expression plasmids. Four hours post-electroporation, transfected Jurkat T-cells were Ficoll-purified and stimulated with 50 ng/ml PMA. After a 15-h incubation, 5 × 104 cells were isolated onto glass slides by CytospinTM centrifugation at 500 rpm (Shandon). The slides were air-dried for 15 min, and then the cells were fixed to the slides by incubation in 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min at room temperature. After three washes in PBS, cells were permeabilized with ice-cold 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.1% sodium citrate buffer for 2 min. Slides were washed with PBS containing 1% BSA and 0.05% Triton X-100 and then blocked with PBS containing 1% BSA and 5% normal goat serum for 1 h at room temperature. Primary antibody was added to the slides for overnight incubation at 4 °C in a humidity chamber. The slides were then washed three times with PBS containing 1% BSA, 0.05% Triton X-100, and then anti-mouse antibody conjugated with Alexa Fluor 594 was added to the slides at a 1:200 dilution in blocking buffer. After a 1-h incubation at room temperature, the slides were washed twice with PBS containing 1% BSA and 0.05% Triton X-100 and then one time with PBS. Excess fluid was removed from the slides and TUNEL reactions were performed using the In Situ cell death kit following the manufacturer's protocol (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Transfection-positive (Red) and TUNEL-positive (fluorescein isothiocyanate staining) cells were visualized using a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope at ×10 magnification. To best determine cells that were both positive for transfection and TUNEL, Zeiss LSM Image Examiner software version 2.5 was used to create a mask of cells only positive for both green and red fluorescence. Five representative fields (∼200 cells/field) were analyzed for each data point. Jurkat T-cells were transfected with pcDNA3.1+, 1 μg of p53 expression plasmid, 4 μg of p73 expression plasmid, or both using the AMAXA Biosystems Nucleofector device and AMAXA Human T-cell Nucleofector kit following manufacturer's directions using program A23. 1-h post-transfection, cells were Ficoll-separated and then stimulated with PMA and ionomycin for 6 h. Following a PBS wash, cells were lysed in standard radioimmune precipitation assay buffer. Protein concentrations were determined by BCA protein assay (Pierce) and samples (75 μg) size-separated by SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting with anti-caspase-3 and anti-p53 antibodies. Numerous studies demonstrate the ability of p53 family member, p73, to regulate p53 target genes including the cell cycle regulator p21 gene (15Kaghad M. Bonnet H. Yang A. Creancier L. Biscan J.C.

Since lymphoblastoma Jurkat T-cells are wild type p53-deficient, we had speculated that perhaps the p21 promoter was transcriptionally activated in these cells by p53-related protein p73 (37Cheng J. Haas M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 21: 5520-5530Google Scholar). However, the overexpression of α-, β-, or γ-p73 did not increasep21 promoter activity or endogenous p21 levels (Figs.1 A and 3 A), whereas, exogenous p53 readily activated the p21 promoter (Figs. 1 A and 3 A). Western analysis demonstrated that HA-tagged p73 was expressed (data not shown). This surprising data led us to question whether or not p73 regulated other p53 target genes in Jurkat T-cells. Interestingly, p73α did not trans-activate the multimer p53 response element PG13 (Fig. 1 B). However, exogenous p73 did trans-activate the p53 target gene mdm2 in Jurkat T-cells, indicating that its trans-regulatory potential is promoter-specific (Fig. 1 C). This specificity is also cell context-dependent. As was previously reported, we showed that exogenous p73 trans-activates the p53-responsive p21promoter in SaOs-2 osteosarcoma cells and A2870 ovarian cancer cells (Fig. 2, A and B) (15Kaghad M.

A, p53-potentiated increase of endogenous p21 levels is attenuated by p73. p21 (below) and p53 (above) immunoblots of transfected Jurkat cell lysates are shown. Jurkat cells were transfected with 1 μg of p53, 4 μg of p73, and pcDNA expression plasmids. Cells were harvested after a 6-h incubation with PMA and ionomycin. IB, immunoblot.B, p73 attenuates p53 trans-activity of the p21promoter in Jurkat cells. Jurkat cells were transfected with 4 μg of p21-LUC reporter and 1, 3, or 9 μg of p73α with and without 0.4 μg of p53 expression plasmid. C, antagonism between p73 and p53 occurs at the level of p53 target sequences as demonstrated by activity at the PG13-LUC reporter. Jurkat cells were transfected with 1 μg of PG13-LUC reporter and 1, 3, or 9 μg of p73α with and without 0.8 μg of p53 expression plasmids. Transfected cells were stimulated with PMA and harvested 6 h later. D, p73 antagonism is not recapitulated at the IL-2 promoter. Jurkat cells were transfected with 4 μg of IL-2-LUC reporter and 0.1, 0.5, or 3 μg of p73α with and without 3 μg of p53 expression plasmids. Transfected cells were stimulated with PMA/ionomycin and harvested 6 h later.

B, A2870 cells were transfected with 1 μg of p21-LUC reporter and 1.6 or 4.5 μg of p73α or 0.4 μg of p53 expression plasmid. Cells were harvested after an 18-h incubation. Fold activations are over pcDNA control as shown inlane 1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Interestingly, p73 does regulate the expression ofp21, not as a transcription enhancer but as an antagonist of p53 trans-activation. The co-expression of p53 and p73 in Jurkat T-cells has an inhibitory effect on the in vivo induction of p21 (Fig. 3 A). As shown in Fig. 3, A and B, the co-expression of p53 and p73 not only repressed p53 activation of the transfected p21promoter reporter but also inhibited increases in endogenous levels of p21. Western analysis demonstrated that endogenous p21 protein levels decreased by 57% upon overexpression of both p53 and p73 compared with cells overexpressing p53 alone (Fig. 3 A). As in all co-transfection experiments, Western analysis confirmed consistent expression levels of p53 (Fig. 3 A). Similar co-transfection experiments with the PG13-LUC reporter indicate that this antagonism occurs at the level of the p53-responsive elements (Fig. 3 C). The ability of p53 to act as either an activator or repressor at target promoters is well established. Recently reported data (2Chaudhry S. Freebern W.J. Smith J.L. Butscher W.G. Haggerty C.M.

Interestingly, the antagonism between p73 and p53 is not recapitulated at theIL-2 promoter. Specific trans-repression of theIL-2 promoter in Jurkat cells is not an activity shared by p73, because its expression shows little effect on the IL -2 promoter either in the presence or absence of p53 (Fig. 3 D). Cell-type specificity of p73 dominant negative function was demonstrated upon co-transfection of p53 and p73 expression plasmids along with p21-LUC into SaOs-2 and A2870 cell lines. Unlike in Jurkat T-cells, p73 does not repress p53 activation of the p21promoter in either SaOs-2 or A2870 cells (Fig. 4, A and B). p73 may act as a transcriptional repressor of thep21 promoter through multiple mechanisms, many of which involve the interaction of p73 with p53 DNA response elements. DNA affinity precipitation experiments were performed to determine whether or not p73 was capable of binding to segments of the p21promoter containing p53 response elements in Jurkat T-cells. Thep21 promoter contains three well characterized p53 binding sites referred to as p53 sites 1, 2, and 3 (Fig. 5 A) (41El-Diery W.S. Tokino T. Velculescu V.E. Levy D.B. Parsons R. Trent J.M. Lin D.

Biotinlyated duplex DNA fragments of the p21 promoter-encoding segments containing p53 site 1 (segment A), p53 sites 2 and 3 (segment B), or sequence 3′ to the p53 binding sites (segment C) were bound to avidin-coated beads and then incubated with Jurkat nuclear extract programmed by transfection with p73 expression plasmid. Western analysis of bead bound protein fractions confirmed that p73 binds selectively to the p21 promoter fragments containing p53 response elements (Fig. 5 B). Therefore, similar to p53, p73 recognizes the p21 promoter in Jurkat cells, although it lacks the ability to drive transcription of the gene. DNA affinity precipitation analyses of nuclear extracts programmed with both p53 and p73 demonstrated that p73 can compete for p53 binding ofp21 promoter elements.

Here we describe a novel isoform of MZF-2, designated MZF-2A, and show that it is phosphorylated by the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases. Anin vitro phosphorylation experiment revealed that the transactivation domain (TAD) of MZF-2A was phosphorylated strongly by extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and phosphorylated weakly by p38 MAP kinase but not by Jun N-terminal kinase. Experiments using “add-back” mutants showed that three serine residues (Ser257, Ser275, and Ser295) in the TAD were phosphorylated in vitro by ERK. In myeloid LGM-1 cells, various extracellular stimuli induced the phosphorylation of these serine residues, which was differentially inhibited by the protein kinase inhibitors U0126 and SB203580. Substitution of these phosphorylation sites with alanines resulted in a strong enhancement of the ability of MZF-2A to activate transcription in a luciferase reporter assay. Taken together, these results indicate that MZF-2A is a novel target for the ERK and p38 MAP kinase signaling pathways, and its transactivation activity is negatively regulated by MAP kinase-mediated phosphorylation of the TAD.

Myeloid zinc finger protein (MZF)1 is one of the candidates in this family for controlling the development of the myeloid cell lineage. MZF is a Krüppel-like C2H2 zinc finger protein expressed predominantly in myeloid progenitor cells, particularly at the myeloblast and metamyelocyte stage (5Hromas R. Collins S.J. Hickstein D.

Blocking MZF expression with antisense oligonucleotides inhibits granulocyte colony-stimulating factor-induced neutrophilic colony formation in vitro, suggesting that MZF is involved in the proliferation of myeloid progenitors and/or their differentiation to neutrophilic granulocytes (6Bavisotto L. Kaushansky K. Lin N. Hromas R. J. Exp. Med. 1991; 174: 1097-1101Google Scholar). Furthermore, disruption of the MZF gene in mice results in an accumulation of Mac-1+ myeloid cells in bone marrow and the development of neoplasias composed of highly proliferating myeloid blasts in the liver and spleen, indicating that MZF plays a role in negative regulation of proliferation and tumorigenesis of hematopoietic progenitors (10Gaboli M. Kotsi P.A. Gurrieri C. Cattoretti G. Ronchetti S. Cordon-Cardo C. Broxmeyer H.E. Hromas R. Pandolfi P.P. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1625-1630Google Scholar). We and others have shown that several isoforms of MZF proteins are produced by alternative transcriptional initiation sites and splicing from a single gene in both human and mouse cells (5Hromas R.

Human MZF-1, originally isolated from myeloid leukemia cells, encodes a 485-amino acid protein consisting of 13 zinc finger motifs that bind specific DNA sequences (5Hromas R. Collins S.J.

Biol. 1994; 14: 1786-1795Google Scholar). By the extensive screening of mouse and human cDNA libraries, we identified an alternative MZF product, termed MZF-2, which shares the sequence of its C terminus, including the zinc finger domains, with MZF-1 but also contains a long N-terminal extension consisting of an acidic domain, a leucine-rich (LeR; also called SCAN box) domain, and a transactivation domain (TAD) (7Murai K. Murakami H. Nagata S. Genes Cells. 1997; 2: 581-591Google Scholar). Functional analysis of the MZF-2 subdomains revealed that the TAD works specifically in myeloid cells and that the far N-terminal region spanning the acidic and LeR domains inhibits the neighboring TAD (13Murai K. Murakami H. Nagata S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3461-3466Google Scholar). Recently, Peterson and Morris (11Peterson M.J. Morris J.F. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 254: 105-118Google Scholar) reported another form of the gene product, MZF1B/C, whose entire structure is almost identical to that of MZF-2 but differs in the N-terminal region. The consensus MZF-binding sites are found in the promoters of several hematopoietic cell-specific genes, such as CD34, c-myb, lactoferin, and myeloperoxidase (12Morris J.F. Hromas R. Rauscher III., F.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1786-1795Google Scholar, 14Morris J.F. Rauscher III, F.J. Davis B. Klemsz M., Xu, D. Tenen D. Hromas R. Blood. 1995; 86: 3640-3647Google Scholar). The MZF-binding motif is also found in the promoter of the telomerase reverse transcriptase gene, where MZF is likely to function as a negative regulator for gene expression (15Fujimoto K. Kyo S. Takakura M. Kanaya T. Kitagawa Y. Itoh H. Takahashi M. Inoue M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 2557-2562Google Scholar). The composite structure of negative and positive regulatory domains for transcription implies that the function of MZF could be regulated by posttranslational modification and/or processing. The activity of many transcription factors is regulated in a rapid and reversible manner by specific phosphorylation. Mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases are proline-directed serine/threonine protein kinases activated by various extracellular stimuli, including growth factors, cytokines, and environmental stresses (16Cano E.

The extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and ERK5/BMK1 pathways mainly convey signals from mitogenic and differentiation stimuli, whereas the Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38 MAP kinase pathways seem to be involved in transducing various stress- and cytokine-triggered signals. Activated MAP kinases in turn phosphorylate a set of cytoplasmic substrates such as MAP kinase-activated protein kinases (18Kyriakis J.M. Avruch J. Physiol.

Here we first showed that a novel isoform of MZF-2, designated MZF-2A, is produced by an alternative use of transcription start sites and subsequent splicing. We then studied the regulatory mechanism of MZF-2A transcriptional activity and found that three serine residues in its transactivation domain are phosphorylated by ERK and p38 MAP kinasesin vitro and in vivo. Mutation of the phosphorylation sites to alanines markedly increased the transactivating potential of MZF-2A, suggesting that MZF-2A activity is negatively regulated by MAP kinase-mediated phosphorylation. The mouse myeloid cell line LGM-1 (33Lee K.H. Kinashi T. Tohyama K. Tashiro K. Funato N. Hama K. Honjo T. J. Exp. Med. 1991; 173: 1257-1266Google Scholar, 34Kinashi T. Lee K.H. Ogawa M. Tohyama K.

The expression plasmid for FLAG epitope-tagged MZF-2A, pFLAG-MZF-2A, was constructed by inserting MZF-2A cDNA downstream of the FLAG epitope sequence (MDYKDDDDKAG) in a pEF-BOS-EX expression vector (13Murai K. Murakami H. Nagata S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3461-3466Google Scholar). To construct the pGL3–4xF113B-G-Luc reporter plasmid, the SV40 promoter sequence of pGL3-Promoter vector (Promega) was replaced by a DNA fragment carrying the tetrameric MZF-binding site (AGTGGGGAgaaaggatctggctGGTGAGGGGGAAtcggatct) (12Morris J.F. Hromas R. Rauscher III., F.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1786-1795Google Scholar) and the granulocyte colony-stimulating factor promoter sequence, derived from the pBPA-4xF113B-G-Luc plasmid (13Murai K. Murakami H. Nagata S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3461-3466Google Scholar). The pRL-SV40 plasmid was purchased from Promega. The pGAL4-MZF-TAD plasmid was generated by inserting a fusion construct encoding the DNA-binding domain of yeast GAL4 (amino acids (aa) 1–146) (35Yoneyama M. Suhara W. Fukuhara Y. Fukuda M. Nishida E. Fujita T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1087-1095Google Scholar), the FLAG epitope sequence, and a cDNA fragment corresponding to the MZF-TAD (aa 155–336) in-frame into pEF-BOS-EX. The deletion mutants of pGAL4-MZF-TAD were constructed by a combination of restriction enzyme digestion and PCR. The pGAL4-Pax6 TAD plasmid was made by replacing the MZF-2A sequence of pGAL4-MZF-TAD with the cDNA fragment corresponding to the transactivation domain (aa 271–422) of mouse Pax6 (36Walther C. Gruss P. Development. 1991; 113: 1435-1449Google Scholar). pMZF-TAD was made by inserting the DNA fragment for MZF-TAD into pEF-BOS-EX. The reporter plasmid pUASG-Luc containing the interferon-β minimal promoter and three GAL4-binding sites was described previously (35Yoneyama M. Suhara W. Fukuhara Y. Fukuda M. Nishida E. Fujita T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1087-1095Google Scholar). The pGEX-MZF-TAD plasmid was constructed by inserting the DNA fragment for the MZF-TAD (aa 155–336) into the pGEX-5X1 vector (Amersham Biosciences). A series of mutants with disrupted phosphorylation sites was generated by recombinant PCR. Active human ERK1 was produced in insect Sf9 cells as described previously (37Fukunaga R. Hunter T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1921-1933Google Scholar). To produce active human p38 and JNK1, HeLa cells were transiently transfected with expression plasmids for FLAG-tagged p38 (38Derijard B. Raingeaud J. Barrett T., Wu, I.H. Han J. Ulevitch R.J. Davis R.J. Science. 1995; 267: 682-685Google Scholar) or hemagglutinin-tagged JNK1 (39Kallunki T., Su, B. Tsigelny I. Sluss H.K. Derijard B. Moore G. Davis R. Karin M. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2996-3007Google Scholar) and stimulated with 0.7m NaCl for 30 min or 10 μg/ml anisomycin for 30 min, respectively. Activated kinase was immunoprecipitated using specific antibodies (anti-FLAG M2 Affinity Gel (Sigma) for FLAG-p38 and anti-hemagglutinin 16B12 monoclonal antibodies (BAbCO) for hemagglutinin-tagged JNK1), and the immune complexes were used forin vitro phosphorylation of GST fusion proteins. The GST-MZF-TAD proteins were produced in Escherichia coliBL21-CodonPlus cells (Stratagene) and purified as described previously (40Kim M. Ogawa H. Kohu K. Ichikawa M. Satoh K. Ishidao T. Nada S. Akiyama T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 294: 1151-1154Google Scholar). Two μg of GST, GST-ATF2-(1–253), GST-Elk-1-(307–428), GST-c-Jun-(1–79) (37Fukunaga R. Hunter T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1921-1933Google Scholar), or GST-MZF-TAD protein was suspended in 20 μl of kinase buffer (20 mm Hepes-Na, pH 7.4, 10 mmMgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 25 μm unlabeled ATP) containing 2 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, and the phosphorylation reaction was initiated by the addition of each MAP kinase. After a 30-min incubation at 30 °C, samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and visualized by autoradiography. To obtain cell lines stably expressing MZF-2A protein, 5 × 106 LGM-1 cells were transfected with 20 μg ofAatII-linearized pFLAG-MZF-2A plasmid together with 1 μg of XhoI-digested pST-neoB by electroporation and cultured for 10 days in growth medium containing 0.5 mg/ml G418 (Sigma) as described previously (41Fukunaga R. Ishizaka-Ikeda E. Nagata S. Cell. 1993; 74: 1079-1087Google Scholar). The G418-resistant clones were tested for FLAG-MZF-2A expression by immunoprecipitation using anti-FLAG M2 Affinity Gel (Sigma) and subsequent Western blotting using anti-MZF-2A antiserum. For immunoprecipitation, the cells were lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (Hepes-Na, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 0.5% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% (w/v) SDS, 20 nm calyculin A (Calbiochem), 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm Pefabloc SC (Roche), 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin), and the supernatant was recovered after centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. FLAG-MZF-2A was immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG M2 Affinity Gel and analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-MZF-2A antiserum. The Anti-ACTIVE MAP kinase antibodies were purchased from Promega. Anti-mouse MZF-2A antiserum was prepared by immunizing rabbits with bacterially produced GSTMZF-TAD. LGM-1 cells were suspended at a density of 1 × 107 cells/ml in 500 μl of serum-free RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10 mm Hepes (pH 7.2) and mixed with 20 μg of plasmid DNA. After electroporation at 360 V with a capacitance of 960 microfarads in a 0.4-cm gap cuvette, the cells were transferred to 2 ml of growth medium and cultured for 18 h. Firefly and Renilla luciferase activities were assayed using the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega). The firefly luciferase activity of each sample was normalized to theRenilla luciferase activity used as an internal standard. Previously, we isolated a murine cDNA for MZF-2 that encoded a polypeptide of 814 amino acids (Fig. 1 A) (7Murai K. Murakami H. Nagata S. Genes Cells. 1997; 2: 581-591Google Scholar). In the course of characterizing the MZF-2 transcripts by Northern blotting, however, we found that the major MZF-2 mRNA species of about 3 kb encoded an alternative protein product lacking the N-terminal region of the reported MZF-2 sequence. As shown in Fig. 1 B, when poly(A)+ RNA extracted from mouse myeloid cell lines was analyzed by Northern blotting, the NP2 probe spanning the acidic and LeR domains detected a major 3-kb transcript and two minor transcripts of 4 and 8 kb in the RNAs from LG and NFS-60 cells, whereas the NP1 probe derived from the 5′ end of the cDNA hybridized only to the 4-kb transcript, indicating that the NP1 sequence was not present in the 3-kb transcript. A BLAST search of the expressed sequence tag data base using the NP2 sequence as a query identified an expressed sequence tag clone (GenBank accession number AA499285) that contained not only the NP2 region but also an additional 5′ sequence that was different from the NP1 sequence. Sequencing analysis of the 5′-flanking region of the MZF genomic clones as well as reverse-transcription-PCR analysis of the RNA from the myeloid cell lines revealed that the 5′ sequence ofAA499285 was derived from an upstream exon (designated exon 0) and represented the 5′-untranslated region of the 3-kb mRNA species (Fig. 1 A). Consequently, this mRNA would encode a 735-amino acid polypeptide that lacked the N-terminal 79 amino acids of the previously reported MZF-2 protein. We conclude that the short form of MZF-2, designated hereafter as MZF-2A (MZF-2 Alternative form), is the major product of the MZF gene, whereas the long form is very minor. In our previous study, we showed that the N-terminal region of MZF-2 negatively regulates its transcriptional activity (13Murai K. Murakami H. Nagata S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3461-3466Google Scholar). To examine whether the short form MZF-2A still retains the inhibitory domain, mouse myeloid LGM-1 cells, which do not express endogenous MZF (Fig. 1 B), were co-transfected with a luciferase reporter plasmid carrying the MZF-binding sites (pGL3–4xF113B-G-Luc) and an effector plasmid expressing MZF-2, MZF-2A, or an N-terminal deletion mutant, KM3 (Fig. 1 A) (13Murai K. Murakami H. Nagata S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3461-3466Google Scholar). The level of reporter expression was then compared. Although MZF-2A showed significant transactivating activity when compared with MZF-2 or the vector control, its activation level was much lower than that of the KM3 mutant, which lacked a 155-aa N-terminal sequence that MZF-2A contained, indicating that the N-terminal domain of MZF-2A functions as a negative regulatory domain (Fig. 1 C). We previously showed that the TAD of MZF-2A resided in the middle region of the molecule (Fig. 1 A) (13Murai K. Murakami H. Nagata S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3461-3466Google Scholar). To characterize the TAD function independent of the zinc finger domain, we generated several chimeric proteins in which various regions of the TAD were fused to the DNA-binding domain of yeast GAL4 protein and examined their ability to activate transcription of the reporter gene carrying a GAL4-binding promoter. As shown in Fig. 2 A, the GAL4-MZF-TAD fusion protein activated the transcription of the reporter gene in LGM-1 cells. Deletions from the C terminus severely impaired transcriptional activation (D1 and D2 mutants), whereas N-terminal deletions up to aa 239 did not affect it significantly (D3 and D4). Further combinations of deletions revealed that the D5 and D6 mutants were able to activate transcription, but D7 was not, indicating that the 50-aa region from aa 239–288 is the minimal TAD of MZF-2A. This finding was further supported by the inability of the D8 mutant, which lacked only the D6 region, to activate transcription. To explore the mechanism of transcriptional activation by MZF-2A, we searched databases for proteins showing any homology with the MZF-TAD and found that the D6 region showed marked homology with the transactivation domain of mouse Pax6 (Fig. 2 B) (42Tang H.K. Singh S. Saunders G.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7210-7221Google Scholar), which is a transcription factor that plays a pivotal role in the development of the central nervous system, eyes, nose, and pancreas (43Callaerts P. Halder G. Gehring W.J. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1997; 20: 483-532Google Scholar, 44Ashery-Padan R. Gruss P. Curr . Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 706-714Google Scholar). This similarity implies that MZF-2A and Pax6 might utilize common transcriptional machinery to regulate transcription. In support of this hypothesis, we found that the expression of the MZF-TAD protein inhibited GAL4-Pax6-TAD-mediated transactivation in a dose-dependent manner, presumably through competitive binding to a shared transcriptional cofactor (Fig. 2 C). Mikkola et al. (45Mikkola I. Bruun J.A. Bjorkoy G. Holm T. Johansen T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15115-15126Google Scholar) showed that the transactivation domain of zebrafish Pax6 is phosphorylated at serine 413 by the ERK and p38 MAP kinases. The conservation of this serine residue in the MZF-TAD (Fig. 2 B) prompted us to investigate whether MZF-2A was also phosphorylated and regulated by MAP kinases. For this purpose, we first examined the phosphorylation of recombinant MZF-TAD by purified ERK, p38, and JNK MAP kinases in vitro. As shown in Fig. 3 A, ERK1 phosphorylated GST-MZF-TAD more efficiently than GST-ATF2 (left panel), and p38 MAP kinase weakly phosphorylated MZF-TAD (middle panel). In contrast, JNK1 did not phosphorylate MZF-TAD at all under the same conditions in which it phosphorylated ATF2, Elk-1, and c-Jun very well (right panel). Similarly, JNK2 did not phosphorylate MZF-TAD (data not shown). Because MAP kinases are proline-directed protein kinases, we focused our next set of studies on five serine/threonine residues, Thr167, Thr170, Ser257, Ser275, and Ser295, all of which are followed by a proline residue and conserved in both human and mouse MZF-TAD sequences (Fig. 3 B, left panel). To determine which residue(s) is actually phosphorylated, a series of MZF-TAD mutants in which these serine or threonine residues were replaced with alanine residues were generated and tested for their ability to be phosphorylated by ERK1 in vitro. When all five of the sites were replaced with alanines (A5 mutant), no phosphorylation was observed (Fig. 3 B, right panel). Starting with this A5 mutant, we constructed “add-back” mutants in which each of the mutated residues was changed back to the wild-type residue, and we examined them for in vitro phosphorylation. The S257, S275, and S295 add-back mutants were phosphorylated efficiently by ERK1, whereas T163 and T170 were not. These results indicate that ERK1 phosphorylates the MZF-TAD in vitro at three serine residues, Ser257, Ser275, and Ser295, among the five putative phosphorylation sites. To investigate whether the serine residues identified above could be phosphorylated by MAP kinases in vivo, we established LGM-1 transformants that stably expressed the wild-type FLAG-MZF-2A (LGM-1/WT) or the S257A/S275A/S295A mutant (LGM-1/S257/275/295A) and examined changes in the phosphorylation state of MZF-2A after exposure of the cells to various extracellular stimuli that are known to activate MAP kinase pathways. The top panel of Fig. 4 A shows changes in electrophoretic mobility of MZF-2A on SDS-PAGE caused by extracellular stimulation. The wild-type MZF-2A appeared as two bands in serum- and IL-3-starved LGM-1 cells. When the cells were stimulated with TPA, anisomycin, FCS, or IL-3, the lower band disappeared, and the upper band increased in intensity. In contrast, the S257/275/295A mutant always appeared as a single band at the same position as the lower band of the wild-type protein, irrespective of stimulation. When the FLAG-MZF-2A protein was immunoprecipitated from the TPA-stimulated or unstimulated cells and treated with calf intestine alkaline phosphatase (Fig. 4 B, CIAP), the upper band of wild-type MZF-2A was converted into the lower band, whereas the mobility of the S257/275/295A mutant was not affected (Fig. 4 B). These results indicated that the mobility shift of MZF-2A was caused by phosphorylation and that one or more of the three serine residues (Ser257, Ser275, and Ser295) were phosphorylated by the extracellular stimuli. Western blot analysis using antibodies specific for the active form of MAP kinases revealed that a distinct set of MAP kinases was activated by the individual stimuli (Fig. 4 A, bottom panels). To explore which MAP kinase is responsible for MZF-2A phosphorylation, we used two specific inhibitors for MAP kinase pathways, U0126 and SB203580. U0126 is a potent inhibitor of MEK, an ERK-activating kinase, and consequently blocks the ERK pathway in vivo (46Favata M.F. Horiuchi K.Y. Manos E.J. Daulerio A.J. Stradley D.A. Feeser W.S. Van Dyk D.E. Pitts W.J. Earl R.A. Hobbs F. Copeland R.A. Magolda R.L. Scherle P.A. Trzaskos J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18623-18632Google Scholar). SB203580 inhibits some of the p38 members such as p38α/SAPK2a and p38β/SAPK2b, but not p38γ/SAPK3 or p38δ/SAPK4 (47Cuenda A. Rouse J. Doza Y.N. Meier R. Cohen P. Gallagher T.F. Young P.R. Lee J.C. FEBS Lett. 1995; 364: 229-233Google Scholar, 48Jiang Y. Chen C., Li, Z. Guo W. Gegner J.A. Lin S. Han J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17920-17926Google Scholar, 49Goedert M. Cuenda A. Craxton M.

Chem. 1998; 273: 15605-15610Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4 C, pretreating cells with U0126 strongly blocked TPA-induced MZF-2A phosphorylation and partially inhibited FCS- or IL-3-induced phosphorylation. This result, together with the observation that ERKs were strongly activated by TPA but very weakly activated by FCS or IL-3 (Fig. 4 A), indicates that ERK MAP kinases phosphorylate MZF-2A in vivo. On the other hand, SB203580 partially blocked the anisomycin-induced mobility shift, indicating that p38 MAP kinase members, which are activated by anisomycin (Fig. 4 A), also contributed to the phosphorylation of MZF-2A. Interestingly, combined treatment with both U0126 and SB203580 did not completely inhibit the MZF-2A phosphorylation induced by anisomycin or IL-3, suggesting that other protein kinases insensitive to these inhibitors may also be involved. These results indicate that, depending on the types of stimulation, the ERK and p38 MAP kinase pathways are differentially involved in MZF-2A phosphorylation. To test whether MAP kinase-mediated phosphorylation regulates the transactivating activity of MZF-2A, we constructed a series of FLAG-MZF-2A mutants in which one or two of the three serine residues were replaced with alanine(s) and assessed their transactivation potentials by a luciferase reporter assay using LGM-1 cells. Western blot analysis of the FLAG-MZF-2A proteins expressed in LGM-1 cells demonstrated that all the wild-type and mutant MZF-2A proteins except for the triple mutant (S257/275/295A) migrated to the position of phosphorylated MZF-2A (Fig. 5, bottom panel). This result indicates that in the growing LGM-1 cells, the wild-type and mutated MZF-2A proteins were constitutively phosphorylated at the unmutated site(s) among the three serine residues. As shown in the top panel of Fig. 5, when compared with wild-type MZF-2A, each mutant with a single substitution (S257A, S275A, and S295A) exhibited a 1.4–2.6-fold increase in reporter activity. Introduction of an additional alanine substitution resulted in a further increase in reporter expression (S275/295A, S257/295A, and S257/275A). The greatest augmentation (∼6-fold) in transcriptional activity was observed with the S257/275/295A mutant, in which all three serine residues were replaced with alanines. These results suggest that phosphorylation of these serine residues cooperatively reduces the transactivation activity of MZF-2A. Among the three serine residues, the substitution of Ser295 showed a greater enhancement in reporter expression than the others, suggesting that phosphorylation of Ser295 is the most effective in repressing the transactivation activity of MZF-2A. The enhancement of reporter expression was not a result of an increase in the protein level of the mutants because comparable amounts of MZF-2A protein were expressed in all of the constructs (Fig. 5, bottom panel). In an attempt to confirm the negative regulation of MZF-2A activity by phosphorylation, we examined the effect of the U0126 and SB203580 inhibitors on the luciferase reporter assay. However, we found that the luciferase assay with these inhibitors could was not a reliable experiment because treatment of cells with the inhibitors resulted in strong reduction of gene expression in general (data not shown). We finally examined the effect of the phosphorylation site mutation on the activity of the N-terminally deleted KM3 mutant, which showed an enhanced transcriptional activity (Fig. 1). Interestingly, the transactivation activity of the S257/275/295A mutant was almost the same as that of KM3, and disruption of the three phosphorylation sites of the KM3 mutant (KM3-S257/275/295A) resulted in only a slight additional enhancement of reporter activation (Fig. 5, top panel), indicating that the two different mutations, the N-terminal deletion and the alanine substitution of the phosphorylated sites, did not work additively to augment reporter expression. Together, these results demonstrate that the transactivation activity of MZF-2A is negatively regulated by MAP kinase-mediated phosphorylation at the three serine residues in the transactivation domain. In this report, we identified and described a novel isoform of mouse MZF-2, designated MZF-2A, which is generated by the use of an alternative transcription start site and subsequent splicing. Compared with MZF-2, MZF-2A lacks 79 N-terminal amino acids and shows a basal level of transactivation activity. Recently, Peterson and Morris (11Peterson M.J. Morris J.F. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 254: 105-118Google Scholar) identified two novel transcripts of the human MZF gene, MZF1B and MZF1C. These mRNAs differ in their 5′-untranslated region but encode the same polypeptide of 734 amino acids, designated MZF1B/C (11Peterson M.J. Morris J.F. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 254: 105-118Google Scholar). Mouse MZF-2A and human MZF1B/C are highly homologous along their entire sequences (81.7% amino acid identity) and are likely to represent the major MZF gene product in myeloid cells. We showed that the previously identified transactivation domain of MZF-2A was functional when fused to the heterologous DNA-binding domain of yeast GAL4 and defined the minimal TAD as a 50-amino acid region (aa 239–288), which is necessary and sufficient to activate transcription. The amino acid composition of this minimal TAD is very characteristic of TADs; i.e. it is rich in acidic amino acid and proline residues. There are five aspartic acid and four glutamic acid residues but no basic (arginine or lysine) residues, resulting in a low isoelectric point of 3.8. Similar acidic and proline-rich features are observed in the TAD of many other transcription factors (51Burley S.K. Roeder R.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 769-799Google Scholar) and are likely to be important for their interaction with other transcription factors. Our studies demonstrate that MZF-2A is phosphorylated by ERK and p38 MAP kinases. In vitro phosphorylation experiments showed that MZF-TAD is phosphorylated strongly by ERK, weakly by p38 kinase, and not at all by JNK1, and further analysis using “add-back” mutants revealed that three serine residues (Ser257, Ser275, and Ser295) in the TAD could be phosphorylated by ERK1 in vitro. The mobility shift analysis of MZF-2A expressed in LGM-1 cells (Fig. 5) demonstrated that any of the single (S257A, S275A, and S295A) and double (S275/295A, S257/295A, and S257/275A) serine residue mutants showed the same mobility as wild-type MZF-2A, indicating that these mutants were still phosphorylated at the remaining unmutated sites. This result indicates that all three serine residues are susceptible to phosphorylation by MAP kinases and that the phosphorylation of any one of them is sufficient to cause the mobility shift. Therefore, the phosphorylation of any of the three serine residues is likely to cause a similar, repressive effect on the transactivation potential of MZF-2A. Consistent with this, additional alanine substitutions for any of the serines cumulatively enhanced the transactivation activity of MZF-2A, and the highest activation was observed when all the phosphorylation sites were disrupted (Fig. 5). These results indicate that the phosphorylation of each serine residue functions cooperatively to repress the ability of MZF-2A to activate transcription. We have shown that various extracellular stimuli, including TPA, anisomycin, FCS, and IL-3, induce the phosphorylation of MZF-2A. Experiments with the protein kinase inhibitors U0126 and SB203580 revealed that distinct MAP kinase pathways are responsible for MZF-2A phosphorylation, depending on the type of stimulation. TPA activates ERK MAP kinases strongly, and the MEK inhibitor U0126 blocked TPA-induced MZF-2A phosphorylation almost completely, clearly demonstrating that ERKs play a predominant role in phosphorylation of MZF-2A in response to TPA stimulation. ERKs are also partly involved in FCS- or IL-3-induced phosphorylation. On the other hand, anisomycin-induced phosphorylation of MZF-2A was partially inhibited only by SB203580, suggesting that p38 MAP kinases, but not ERKs, are involved. Interestingly, combined treatment with both inhibitors mostly blocked MZF-2A phosphorylation induced by TPA or FCS but still resulted in partial inhibition of anisomycin- or IL-3-induced phosphorylation, suggesting that other protein kinase(s) insensitive to these inhibitors are involved downstream of anisomycin and IL-3. Although the JNK pathway is known to be resistant to these inhibitors (47Cuenda A. Rouse J. Doza Y.N. Meier R. Cohen P. Gallagher T.F. Young P.R. Lee J.C. FEBS Lett. 1995; 364: 229-233Google Scholar, 50Gum R.J. McLaughlin M.M. Kumar S. Wang Z. Bower M.J. Lee J.C. Adams J.L. Livi G.P. Goldsmith E.J. Young P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15605-15610Google Scholar), JNK MAP kinases are unlikely to play this role because neither JNK1 (Fig. 3) nor JNK2 (data not shown) phosphorylated GST-MZF-TAD in vitro. Another possibility is that the SB203580-insensitive p38 isoforms, such as p38γ/SAPK3 and p38δ/SAPK4 (49Goedert M. Cuenda A. Craxton M. Jakes R. Cohen P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3563-3571Google Scholar, 50Gum R.J. McLaughlin M.M. Kumar S. Wang Z. Bower M.J. Lee J.C. Adams J.L. Livi G.P. Goldsmith E.J. Young P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15605-15610Google Scholar), phosphorylate MZF-2A. These kinases are likely to mediate anisomycin-inducible and SB203580-resistant phosphorylation of eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase in KB cells (52Knebel A. Morrice N. Cohen P. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4360-4369Google Scholar), and they may similarly play a prominent role in anisomycin- or IL-3-dependent phosphorylation of MZF-2A in LGM-1 cells. These findings demonstrate that the MZF-2A transcription factor integrates MAP kinase signaling pathways in response to different extracellular stimuli, such as Elk-1, Sap-1a, and ATF2 (26Raingeaud J.

Specific phosphorylation events can regulate the activity of transcription factors via several different mechanisms involving changes in protein stability, subcellular localization, or protein-protein interactions (19Thomson S. Mahadevan L.C. Clayton A.L. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 10: 205-214Google Scholar, 28Treisman R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 205-215Google Scholar, 30Rebay I. Rubin G.M.

We showed that protein stability is not significantly affected by alanine substitution of the phosphorylation sites (Fig. 5). We also found by subcellular fractionation experiments that MZF-2A is present exclusively in the nuclear fraction, irrespective of its phosphorylation state. 2H. Ogawa, S. Nagata, and R. Fukunaga, unpublished observation. The KM3 mutant shows enhanced transcriptional activity, indicating that the N-terminal domain inhibits the transcriptional activity of the TAD. We previously proposed a model for this negative regulation in which an intramolecular interaction of the N-terminal domain with the adjacent TAD impedes the recruitment of a transcriptional cofactor(s) (13Murai K. Murakami H. Nagata S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3461-3466Google Scholar). The findings in this report that disruption of all three phosphorylation sites elevates MZF-2A transactivation activity to a level comparable with that of the KM3 mutant and that alanine substitution of the phosphorylation sites in the KM3 construct enhances its activity only weakly (Fig. 5, top panel) suggest that the alanine substitution and the N-terminal truncation could cause a similar effect on TAD function, which may imply that TAD phosphorylation is required for the N-terminal regulatory domain to repress transactivation activity. Combining this possibility with the previous model, dephosphorylation might release the TAD from the inhibitory domain and allow the TAD to interact with the transcriptional machinery (Fig. 6). Alternatively, because the LeR/SCAN domain is implicated to function as a module for protein-protein interaction (56Williams A.J. Blacklow S.C. Collins T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8526-8535Google Scholar, 57Sander T.L. Haas A.L. Peterson M.J. Morris J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12857-12867Google Scholar), TAD phosphorylation may cooperate with the LeR/SCAN domain to bind a repressor protein. In summary, this work represents the first report of MZF-2A phosphorylation by MAP kinases. A challenge for future studies is to clarify the physiological significance of MZF-2A phosphorylation and the subsequent repression of its transactivating function. Because serum and IL-3 are potent growth-promoting factors, inducible or constitutive phosphorylation of MZF-2A by these factors would contribute to reducing the growth-suppressing function of MZF-2A, and dephosphorylation and the subsequent activation of MZF-2A may be involved in cell cycle arrest and terminal differentiation of myeloid cells. In this regard, it would be intriguing to examine the regulation of MZF-2A phosphorylation in granulocyte colony-stimulating factor-driven granulocytic differentiation and maturation.
