In this study, we examined the role of the protein kinase Akt/PKB in endothelial cell survival in response to growth factor and matrix attachment signals. Vascular endothelial growth factor(VEGF)-induced cytoprotection of endothelial cell monolayers correlated with the wortmannin-sensitive induction of Akt activity. Transfection of an adenovirus expressing a dominant-negative Akt mutant decreased endothelial cell viability in the presence of VEGF. Conversely, adenoviral transduction of wild-type Akt facilitated the cell survival effects of VEGF, whereas transduction of constitutively active Akt conferred endothelial cell survival in the absence of VEGF. Constitutively active Akt also conferred survival to endothelial cells in suspension culture, whereas stimulation with VEGF did not. In suspension cultures, VEGF stimulation was unable to activate Akt, and Akt protein levels were repressed in cells undergoing anoikis. These data suggest that cross-talk between growth factor- and anchorage-dependent signaling pathways are essential for Akt activation and endothelial cell survival.

The survival of endothelial cells is critical for angiogenesis and the maintenance of blood vessel integrity.

Nature. 1997; 386: 671-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (4867) Google Scholar). VEGF biological activity is mediated through its binding to at least two endothelial cell-specific receptors, fms-like tyrosine kinase (flt-1) and fetal liver kinase (flk-1) (2de Vries C.

Heterozygous deletion of theVEGF gene results in the embryonic lethality due to the abnormal blood vessel development (4Carmeliet P. Ferreira V. Breier G. Pollefeyt S. Kieckens L. Gertsenstein M.

VEGF also functions in adult organisms to promote angiogenesis in ischemic tissue (6Banai S. Jaklitsch M.T. Shou M. Lazarous D.F. Scheinowitz M. Biro S. Epstein S.E. Unger E.F.

Augmented expression of VEGF by gene transfer has been shown to promote the formation of collateral arteries in patients with peripheral artery disease (8Baumgartner I. Pieczek A. Manor O. Blair R. Kearney M. Walsh K. Isner J.M. Circulation. 1998; 97: 1114-1123Crossref PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar), and VEGF is also associated with pathological angiogenesis such as in tumors that express high levels of this factor (9Plate K.H.

VEGF activates receptor tyrosine kinases leading to the activation of various signal transducers including phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3-kinase) (11Guo D. Jia Q. Song H.-Y. Warren R.S. Donner D.B.

In addition to its mitogenic effects, VEGF acts to promote endothelial cell survival bothin vitro and in vivo (13Alon T. Hemo I. Itin A. Pe'er J. Stone J. Keshet E. Nat.

Consistent with its function as a survival factor, VEGF withdrawal is associated with vascular regression in both developing retina and tumors (13Alon T. Hemo I. Itin A. Pe'er J. Stone J. Keshet E. Nat. Med. 1995; 1: 1024-1028Crossref PubMed Scopus (1422) Google Scholar, 16Yuan F. Chen Y. Dellian M. Safabakhsh N. Ferrara N. Jain R.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Endothelial cells are also dependent on adhesion to extracellular matrix for their survival (18Meredith J.E. Fazeli B. Schwartz M.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 953-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (1405) Google Scholar). Cell adhesion to matrix is mediated by integrins and disruption of proper integrin-ligand interactions leads to a phenomenon termed anoikis, apoptosis induced by the disruption of cell-matrix interactions (19Frisch S.M. Francis H. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 619-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (2788) Google Scholar). Endothelial cell adhesion to matrix is mediated, at least in part, by integrin αvβ3, which transmits an “outside-in” survival signal that is essential for angiogenesis (20Brooks P.C. Montgomery A.M.P. Rosenfeld M. Reisfeld R.A. Hu T. Klier G. Cheresh D.A. Cell. 1994; 79: 1157-1164Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2185) Google Scholar). Therefore, agents that induce endothelial cell apoptosis, either by antagonizing integrin binding or perturbing adhesion plaque formation, are currently being considered for cancer therapy by virtue of their ability to inhibit tumor neovascularization (21Claesson-Welsh L.

The serine/threonine protein kinase Akt/PKB is recognized increasingly as a key regulator of cell viability in a number of systems (24Dudek H. Datta S.R. Franke T.F. Birnbaum M.J. Yao R. Cooper G.M.

Activation of Akt occurs through the direct binding of the phosphoinositide products of the PI3-kinase reaction to its pleckstrin homology domain (28Franke T.F. Kaplan D.R. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1997; 88: 435-437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1528) Google Scholar). Phosphoinositol lipids also activate a protein kinase that phosphorylates Akt, resulting in further activation (29Kohn A.D. Takeuchi F. Roth R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21920-21926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar,30Stokoe D. Stephens L.R. Copeland T. Gaffney P.R.J. Reese C.B. Painter G.F. Holmes A.B. McCormick F. Hawkins P.T. Science. 1997; 277: 567-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (1054) Google Scholar). Here, we examined the involvement of Akt in the survival of cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC). VEGF-mediated HUVEC survival correlated with the wortmannin-sensitive induction of Akt activity. Adenovirus-mediated expression of a dominant-negative mutant of Akt reduced HUVEC viability in the presence of VEGF. Forced expression of wild-type Akt promoted cell survival in response to low doses of VEGF, whereas constitutive overexpression of Akt was sufficient for endothelial cell survival in the absence of VEGF. VEGF did not promote Akt activation in suspension culture nor did it inhibit anoikis. However, expression of constitutively active Akt was sufficient for survival in the absence of attachment. These data suggest that growth factor and attachment-mediated signaling pathways converge on Akt to control endothelial cell survival under conditions of angiogenesis and vessel regression. Anti-Akt antibody was purchased from Santa-Cruz. Wortmannin was purchased from Sigma. Akt plasmids were a gift from Dr. J. Testa. Recombinant human VEGF was the 165 amino acid isoform. HUVECs were cultured in monolayers in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (DMEM) under conditions of serum deprivation or stimulation with VEGF as described by Spyridopouloset al. (14Spyridopoulos I. Brogi E. Kearney M. Sullivan A.B. Cetrulo C. Isner J.M. Losordo D.W. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1997; 29: 1321-1330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). For suspension cultures, HUVEC monolayers were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) twice and incubated with PBS containing 0.5% EDTA. Cells were collected with centrifugation (2,000 rpm for 5 min) and washed with serum-depleted media. For suspension culture, bacterial culture dishes were precoated with 20 mg/ml bovine serum albumin overnight to prevent the cells from attaching to the substratum. Cells were washed twice with PBS and lysed with cell lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 137 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 20 mm NaF, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Lysates were precleaned with protein G-agarose for 30 min at 4 °C, and immunoprecipitated for 2 h with anti-Akt antibodies in the presence of 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin with or without 16 μg/ml competitor peptides (Santa Cruz). Immunoprecipitates were washed twice with cell lysis buffer, once with water, and once with kinase buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm MnCl2). Immunoprecipitated proteins were incubated in 50 μl of kinase buffer containing 2 μg of histone H2B (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and [γ-32P]ATP (5 μm, 10 μCi) for 30 min at room temperature. Kinase reactions were stopped by the addition of SDS sample buffer and subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on 15% polyacrylamide gels before autoradiography. Cells were plated on 24-well dishes at a density of 4 × 104 cells/well. After overnight incubation, the media was changed to DMEM containing 20% fetal bovine serum or the indicated concentrations of VEGF for 21 h. Cells were then washed with PBS, harvested by trypsinization, and viability was determined by the trypan blue exclusion assay (31Mesner P.W. Winters T.R. Green S.H. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 1669-1680Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 32Zhou S. Baltimore D. Cantley L.C. Kaplan D.R. Franke T.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11345-11350Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). Alternatively cells were analyzed for the appearance of pyknotic nuclei. After removal of culture media, 3.7% formaldehyde in PBS was added to the culture. After fixation for 20 min, cells were washed in PBS twice and stained with Hoechst 33342. Cells were examined with a Nikon Diaphot microscope. Cell viability was also assessed by the MTS assay. Cells were cultured in 96-well dish precoated with bovine serum albumin in the presence or absence of VEGF (100 ng/ml) for 21 h. MTS assay was performed according to the manufacturer's protocol (Promega). Cells were incubated with MTS reaction solution for 2 h. Replication-defective adenovirus vectors expressing mouse Akt proteins fused in-frame to the hemagglutinin (HA) epitope under the control of the cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter were constructed according to the method of Becker (33Becker T.C. Noel R.J. Coats W.S. Gomez-Foix A.M. Alam T. Gerard R.D. Newgard C.B. Methods in Cell Biology. 43. Academic Press, New York, NY1994: 161-189Google Scholar). In brief, HA-Akt fragment from pcDNA3-HA-Akt plasmid was inserted into the multicloning site of pACCMVpLpA plasmid. pACCMVpLpA-HA-Akt was co-transfected with pJM17 plasmid into 293 cells to allow for homologous recombination. The mutant Akt and constitutively active Akt adenoviral vectors were constructed by the same protocol. The dominant-negative mutant Akt (T308A,S473A) protein cannot be activated by phosphorylation (34Alessi D.R. Andjelkovic M. Caudwell B. Cron P. Morrice N. Cohen P. Hemmings B.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6541-6551Crossref PubMed Scopus (2530) Google Scholar) and it functions in a dominant-negative fashion (35Kitamura T. Ogawa W. Sakaue H. Hino Y. Kuroda S. Takata M. Matsumoto M. Maeda T. Konishi H. Kikkawa U. Kasuga M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3708-3717Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). The constitutively active Akt construct has the c-srcmyristoylation sequence fused in-frame to the N terminus of the HA-Akt (wild-type) coding sequence. Adenoviral Akt constructs were amplified in 293 cells and purified by ultracentrifugation through a CsCl gradient. Adeno-β-gal expresses the bacterial β-galactosidase gene from the CMV promoter (36Smith R.C. Branellec D. Gorski D.H. Guo K. Perlman H. Dedieu J.-F. Pastore C. Mahfoudi A. Denèfle P. Isner J.M. Walsh K. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1674-1689Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). HUVEC cultures were infected for 24 h with Ad-Akt or Ad-β-galactosidase at a multiplicity of infection of 50, achieving a 90% transduction efficiency (data not shown). Cells were cultured under the indicated conditions. Floating and attached cells were collected and resuspended in 200 μl of PBS containing proteinase K (0.5 mg/ml), RNase A (0.5 mg/ml), and 1% SDS. After 30 min incubation at 37 °C, 300 μl of NaI solution (6 m NaI, 13 mm EDTA, 0.5% SDS, 10 mg/ml glycogen, 26 nm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0) was added. Cell lysates were incubated at 60 °C for 15 min and 500 μl of isopropanol was added. DNA was precipitated by centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 15 min. After washing once with 50% isopropanol and once with 100% isopropanol, the DNA was dried. DNA (15 μg/lane) was examined following electrophoresis on a 1.5% agarose gel. Cells were treated as described in the figure legends, and cell lysates were prepared as described for the Akt kinase assays. 20 μg of protein was separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gel and transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore). After blocking with T-PBS (PBS containing 0.2% Tween 20) containing 5% milk for 1 h, the membrane was incubated with anti-Bcl-2 antibody (Transduction Labs), anti-Akt antibody (Santa Cruz), phospho-specific Akt antibody (New England Biolabs), or tubulin (Calbiochem). ECL (Amersham) was used for detection. Consistent with previous reports (15Gerber H.-P. Dixit V. Ferrara N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13313-13316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (838) Google Scholar, 37Levkau B. Koyama H. Raines E.W. Clurman B.R. Herren B. Orth K. Roberts J.M. Ross R. Mol.

Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1083-1093Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar), serum deprivation induces endothelial cell death (Fig.1). Serum deprivation for 21 h resulted in 50–80% decreases in HUVEC viability depending on the preparation and passage number, where higher passage cells (passage 4 or 5) were more sensitive to death than lower passage cells (not shown). It has been reported that VEGF inhibits HUVEC apoptosis induced by serum deprivation (15Gerber H.-P. Dixit V. Ferrara N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13313-13316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (838) Google Scholar). A dose dependence of VEGF in preventing HUVEC death is shown in Fig. 1 A. Under the conditions of our assays, 100 ng/ml VEGF reversed cell loss induced by serum deprivation. Consistent with an anti-apoptotic effect, treatment with VEGF also diminished the frequency of endothelial cells exhibiting pyknotic nuclei (Fig. 1 B). Inclusion of 100 ng/ml VEGF diminished the frequency of pyknotic nuclei from 19.6 ± 2.6 to 10.7 ± 0.8 in cultures that were incubated in the absence of serum for 21 h. The cell survival effects of VEGF were blocked by the PI3-kinase inhibitor wortmannin. Inhibition of VEGF-mediated cell viability by wortmannin was dose-dependent (Fig.2 A). Partial inhibition of VEGF-mediated HUVEC survival occurred when cultures were incubated with 10 or 50 nm wortmannin, whereas 200 nmwortmannin completely abrogated the survival effects of VEGF. 200 nm wortmannin also abrogated the VEGF-mediated diminution of pyknotic nuclei in the serum-deprived cultures (Fig.2 B). To determine whether VEGF regulates the activity of Akt family proteins in endothelial cells, HUVEC cultures were incubated in serum-free DMEM with or without VEGF (100 ng/ml). The kinase activity of Akt was determined in lysates immunoprecipitated with specific anti-Akt antibody. As shown in Fig.3, VEGF activated Akt kinase activity in mitogen-deprived HUVEC cultures. Because Akt is regulated by PI3-kinase in other cell types (39Franke T.F. Yang S.-I. Chan T.O. Datta K. Kazlauskas A. Morrison D.K. Kaplan D.R. Tsichlis P.N. Cell. 1995; 81: 727-736Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1829) Google Scholar), we investigated the effects of wortmannin on Akt activation by VEGF. A 30-min preincubation period with 200 nm wortmannin blocked VEGF-induced Akt activity (Fig. 3). Incubation with anti-Akt antibody competitor peptide diminished the H2B phosphorylation signal to levels seen in cultures incubated with wortmannin. Collectively, these data show that HUVEC survival correlates with Akt activity. To explore the functional significance of VEGF-induced Akt activity in endothelial cell survival, replication-defective adenoviral vectors expressing wild-type (Adeno-wtAkt), dominant-negative (Adeno-dnAkt), or constitutively active Akt (Adeno-myrAkt) were constructed (Fig.4 A). All adenovirus-encoded transgenes were fused with the HA epitope to distinguish exogenous from endogenous Akt. Control cultures were infected with an adenoviral vector expressing β-galactosidase (Ad-β-gal), which does not affect endothelial cell viability under the conditions of our assay (not shown). Western blot analyses, using anti-Akt antibodies on anti-HA immunoprecipitated material, revealed that Adeno-wtAkt, Adeno-dnAkt, and Adeno-myrAkt expressed comparable levels of protein (Fig.4 B). Akt protein kinase activity was detected in the anti-HA immunoprecipitates from cells infected with Adeno-wtAkt in the presence, but not the absence, of VEGF (Fig. 4 B) In contrast, no kinase activity was detected in the cultures infected with the Adeno-dnAkt vector in the presence or absence of VEGF. Cultures infected with Adeno-myrAkt contained high levels of HA-associated Akt activity that was not influenced by VEGF stimulation. HUVEC cultures were infected with Adeno-dnAkt to test whether Akt is essential for VEGF-mediated survival. In the absence of growth factor, the dominant-negative Akt construct did not affect endothelial cell survival, but it inhibited the cytoprotective action of VEGF (Fig.5 A). DNA prepared from the serum-deprived HUVEC cultures displayed the typical nucleosome spacing ladder upon agarose gel electrophoresis that is indicative of apoptosis (Fig. 5 B). The DNA ladder was diminished by the inclusion of VEGF in the culture media. Consistent with the data from the trypan blue exclusion assays, infection with Adeno-dnAkt blocked the ability of VEGF to inhibit DNA fragmentation. Adenoviral transduction of wild-type Akt markedly augmented VEGF-induced endothelial cell survival (Fig.6 A). Cultures infected with Ad-Akt displayed 75 and 65% less cell death than control cultures at 1 and 10 ng/ml, respectively, whereas no decrease in cell death was detected in the cultures exposed to serum-free media in the absence of VEGF. These data show that forced expression of wild-type can enhance the sensitivity of endothelial cells to VEGF survival signals at subsaturating levels of VEGF. In contrast to infection with Adeno-wtAkt, infection of cultures with Adeno-myrAkt promoted endothelial cell survival in the absence of growth factor. Analyses of serum-deprived HUVEC cultures revealed that infection with Adeno-myrAkt significantly decreases the frequency of pyknotic nuclei (Fig. 6 B) to levels similar to that observed in the presence of VEGF (Fig. 2 B). A previous study showed that VEGF induces the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 in HUVECs and that forced expression of Bcl-2 is sufficient to prevent apoptosis in the absence of VEGF (15Gerber H.-P. Dixit V. Ferrara N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13313-13316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (838) Google Scholar). Thus, we used the adenoviral Akt vectors to test for the potential involvement of Akt activation in VEGF-mediated Bcl-2 induction. As shown in Fig. 7, VEGF stimulation led to a modest induction of Bcl-2. This up-regulation was blocked by infection with Adeno-dnAkt, demonstrating that Akt is essential for VEGF-mediated induction of Bcl-2. However, infection with Adeno-myrAkt was not sufficient to induce Bcl-2, suggesting that the endothelial cell survival conferred by Akt under these conditions involves other apoptosis-regulatory proteins. To examine the role of Akt in anchorage-dependent endothelial cell survival, HUVECs were cultured in suspension under serum-deprivation conditions in nonadhesive bacteriological dishes. Under these conditions, endothelial cells rapidly underwent anoikis (19Frisch S.M. Francis H. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 619-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (2788) Google Scholar) as indicated by cell shrinkage and membrane blebbling, characteristic of the apoptotic morphology (Fig.8 A). Inclusion of VEGF in the suspension culture media had no effect on cell morphology. However, cells pre-infected with the adenoviral construct expressing constitutively active Akt appeared viable in suspension culture (Fig.8 A). To confirm that constitutively active Akt construct promotes endothelial cell viability under these conditions, MTS assays were performed on cells cultured under these conditions (Fig.8 B). Consistent with observations of cell morphology, infection with Adeno-myrAkt preserved mitochondrial function, an indicator of cellular viability (40Tanaka M. Suda T. Haze K. Nakamura N. Sato K. Kimura F. Motoyoshi K. Mizuki M. Tagawa S. Ohga S. Hatake K. Drummond A.H. Nagata S. Nat. Med. 1996; 2: 317-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar). These data show that constitutive Akt activity, but not stimulation with VEGF, is sufficient to confer survival in endothelial cells in the absence of matrix attachment. To further study the role of Akt in anchorage-dependent endothelial cell survival, activated Akt levels were assessed in HUVEC monolayer and suspension cultures using an antibody that is specific for Akt phosphorylated at residue 473 and indicative of the status of Akt activation (34Alessi D.R. Andjelkovic M. Caudwell B. Cron P. Morrice N. Cohen P. Hemmings B.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6541-6551Crossref PubMed Scopus (2530) Google Scholar). Consistent with measurements of Akt-associated histone H2B-kinase activity (Fig. 3 A), VEGF stimulation of HUVEC monolayers increased the level of phosphorylated (activated) Akt with no detectable change in the total level of Akt protein (Fig.9 A). However, VEGF stimulation had no effect on the level of Akt phosphorylation within 1 h of incubation in suspension culture (Fig. 9 A). Moreover, these suspension culture cells (<1 h) displayed lower levels of basal Akt phosphorylation though levels of Akt protein were comparable between attached cells and cells in suspension. VEGF stimulation of HUVECs in suspension for 21 h also did not induce Akt phosphorylation. At this time, HUVEC death is prevalent (Fig. 8) and Akt protein levels are reduced relative to tubulin (Fig. 9 B). Exposure of endothelial cells to survival factors and proper cell-matrix attachments are required for the formation of new blood vessels as well as the maintenance of existing vessels. Consistent with its function as a survival factor, VEGF withdrawal is associated with vascular regression in both developing retina and tumors (13Alon T. Hemo I. Itin A. Pe'er J. Stone J. Keshet E.

In this study, we explored the role of the Akt protein kinase in mediating the survival functions of VEGF and matrix attachment in endothelial cells. We have shown that VEGF-induced survival in monolayer cultures correlates with the wortmannin-sensitive activation of the Akt protein. The functional significance of Akt activation is indicated by the finding that adenovirus-mediated expression of a dominant-negative Akt mutant inhibited the cell survival effect of VEGF. We also showed that forced expression of constitutively active Akt is sufficient to confer survival to serum-deprived endothelial cells. Following the initial submission of this paper, Gerber et al. (42Gerber H.-P. McMurtrey A. Kowalski J. Yan M. Key B.A. Dixit V. Ferrara N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30336-30343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1746) Google Scholar) reported that VEGF activates Akt and that plasmid-mediated overexpression of constitutively active Akt protects endothelial cells from apoptosis, whereas a dominant-negative Akt construct inhibits the cytoprotection conferred by VEGF. The combined results of these two studies demonstrate that Akt activation is essential for VEGF-induced cytoprotection and that plasmid- or adenovirus-mediated gene transfer of constitutively active Akt can suffice for VEGF with regard to cell survival. Here, we have also shown that adenovirus-mediated transfer of wild-type Akt does not promote endothelial cell survival in the absence of VEGF, but it could potentiate the survival effects of subsaturating levels of VEGF. Thus, these data indicate that mitogen-induced activation of Akt can be a limiting event in the signaling cascade that controls endothelial cell viability. Though growth factors initiate angiogenic process, it has been proposed that proper matrix associations are essential for endothelial cell survival during neovascularization as cells migrate toward the angiogenic source (20Brooks P.C. Montgomery A.M.P. Rosenfeld M. Reisfeld R.A. Hu T. Klier G. Cheresh D.A. Cell. 1994; 79: 1157-1164Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2185) Google Scholar). Thus, it was of interest to test whether Akt was also involved in attachment-mediated endothelial cell survival and, if so, how VEGF and matrix survival signals were coordinated with regard to Akt. Consistent with reports in endothelial cells and other cell types (18Meredith J.E. Fazeli B. Schwartz M.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 953-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (1405) Google Scholar), HUVECs rapidly underwent apoptosis when incubated in suspension culture. Though VEGF stimulation did not inhibit apoptosis under these conditions, transduction of constitutively active Akt was sufficient to promote cell viability in the absence of matrix attachment. Immediately following cell detachment, VEGF was unable to stimulate Akt activation via phosphorylation of serine 473 suggesting that matrix attachment is essential for signal transduction events upstream of Akt. At later time points in suspension culture, Akt protein was selectively lost suggesting that reductions in Akt protein might also contribute to this reduction in cell viability. However, adenovirus-mediated overexpression of wild-type Akt in either the presence or absence of VEGF stimulation had no effect on endothelial cell viability in suspension culture (data not shown). Therefore, it appears that the loss of Akt protein is a consequence of the apoptotic process, as has been found in Jurkat and U937 cell death (43Widmann C. Gibson S. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7141-7147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar), and that apoptosis initiates from a failure of VEGF to promote Akt activation in the absence of matrix attachment. As noted above, attachment appears to be required for VEGF-initiated signal transduction events upstream of Akt. It has recently been shown that αvβ3 occupancy on smooth muscle cells stimulates insulin-like growth factor-1 signal transduction by enhancing the tyrosine kinase activity of the receptor (44Zheng B. Clemmons D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11217-11222Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), and similar mechanisms may be operating in endothelial cells with regard to VEGF activation of the Flk-1 receptor. An alternative hypothesis is that VEGF may function by modulating attachment-mediated survival signals. Of note, in the absence of VEGF stimulation, cell attachment has a marked influence on the basal level of Akt activation (see Fig.9 A). These data suggest that growth factor-independent mechanisms of Akt activation exist within endothelial cells, and it is possible that VEGF stimulation serves to facilitate these anti-apoptotic signals from integrins and the extracellular matrix, the production of which are also regulated by VEGF (14Spyridopoulos I. Brogi E. Kearney M. Sullivan A.B. Cetrulo C. Isner J.M. Losordo D.W. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1997; 29: 1321-1330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). In endothelial cells, VEGF promotes tyrosine phosphorylation of various signal transducers, including PI3-kinase, Ras GTPase-activating protein, and phospholipase C-γ (11Guo D. Jia Q. Song H.-Y. Warren R.S. Donner D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6729-6733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). Here, we have shown that VEGF-induced Akt activation and cytoprotection in endothelial cells was suppressed by wortmannin, a PI3-kinase inhibitor, indicating that Akt acts downstream of PI3-kinase in the VEGF signaling pathway. In contrast, VEGF mitogenic functions are transduced through protein kinase C, which is not inhibited by wortmannin (12Xia P. Aiello L.P. Ishii H. Jiang Z.Y. Park D.J. Robinson G.S. Takagi H. Newsome W.P. Jirousek M.R. King G.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 2018-2026Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar). Taken together, these data suggest that the cytoprotective and mitogenic signals of VEGF are transduced by independent pathways in endothelial cells. In summary, the findings of this study show that Akt is essential in regulating both VEGF- and attachment-mediated survival signals in endothelial cells. In particular, these data document the importance of cross-talk between these two signaling pathways in promoting Akt activation with consequences on endothelial cell survival. Because endothelial cell viability is essential for the maintenance of new blood vessels, further analysis of Akt may provide new insights about the regulatory control of angiogenesis during normal development and tumorigenesis.

Although they are both important for resistance to H2O2, only Yap1 is important for cadmium resistance, whereas Skn7 has a negative effect upon this response. The respective roles of Yap1 and Skn7 in the induction of defense genes by H2O2 were analyzed by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. Yap1 controls a large oxidative stress response regulon of at least 32 proteins. Fifteen of these proteins also require the presence of Skn7 for their induction by H2O2. Although about half of the Yap1 target genes do not contain a consensus Yap1 recognition motif, the control of one such gene, TSA1, involves the binding of Yap1 and Skn7 to its promoter in vitro. The co-operative control of the oxidative stress response by Yap1 and Skn7 delineates two gene subsets. Remarkably, these two gene subsets separate antioxidant scavenging enzymes from the metabolic pathways regenerating the main cellular reducing power, glutathione and NADPH. Such a specialization may explain, at least in part, the dissociated function of Yap1 and Skn7 in H2O2 and cadmium resistance.

Aerobic organisms have to maintain a reduced cellular redox environment in the face of the prooxidative conditions of aerobic life. The incomplete reduction of oxygen to water during respiration leads to the formation of redox-active oxygen intermediates such as the superoxide anion radical (O⨪2), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), and the hydroxyl radical (for review see Refs. 1Halliwell B. Gutteridge J.M.C. Free Radicals in Biology and Medicine. Clarendon Press, Oxford1989Google Scholar, 2Storz G. Tartaglia L.A. Farr S.B. Ames B.N.

Redox-active oxygen intermediates are also produced during the β-oxidation of fatty acids by exposure to radiation, light, metals, and redox active drugs. Redox-active oxygen intermediates perturbate the cell redox status and when present in high levels can induce toxic damage to lipids, proteins, and DNA, eventually leading to cell death. Living organisms constantly sense and adapt to such redox perturbations. The exposure of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae to low doses of H2O2 or O⨪2-generating drugs switches on within minutes a resistance to toxic doses of these oxidants (4Collinson L.P. Dawes I.W. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1992; 138: 329-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 5Jamieson D.J. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 6678-6681Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Flattery-O'Brien J. Collinson L.P. Dawes I.W. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1993; 139: 501-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The adaptive response to H2O2 involves a change in the expression of at least 167 proteins (7Godon C. Lagniel G. Lee J. Buhler J.-M. Kieffer S. Perrot M. Boucherie H. Toledano M.B. Labarre J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22480-22489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). Such a rapid and widespread genomic response suggests the existence of specific control pathways. In S. cerevisiae, the transcription factors Yap1 (8Schnell N. Krems B. Entian K.-D. Curr.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1035-1044Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar) have been implicated in a cellular pathway that controls the oxidative stress response. Yap1 is a bZIP DNA-binding protein of the AP-1 family (12Moye-Rowley W.S. Harshma K.D. Parker C.S. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 283-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar) that binds the sequence T(T/G)ACTAA termed the Yap1 response element (YRE) (9Kuge S. Jones N.

Skn7 contains a receiver domain found in the family of two-component signal transduction systems of prokaryotes and a domain similar to the DNA-binding domain of heat shock factor (Hsf1) (15Brown J.L. Bussey H. Stewart R.C. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5186-5194Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 16Morgan B.A. Bouquin N. Merril G.F. Johnston L.H. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5679-5689Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Skn7 is also capable of specific DNA binding, but its cognate DNA sequence has not been identified precisely (11Morgan B.A. Banks G.R. Toone W.M. Raitt D. Kuge S. Johnston L.H. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1035-1044Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Strains inactivated for either one of these regulators are hypersensitive to killing by H2O2 (9Kuge S. Jones N. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 655-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar, 10Krems B. Charizanis C. Entian K.-D. Curr.

This oxidative stress phenotype is related to the role of Yap1 and Skn7 in controlling the induction of several defense genes by H2O2. Yap1 controls the expression of GSH1 (γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase) (13Wu A. Moye-Rowley W.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5832-5839Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), TRX2 (thioredoxin) (9Kuge S. Jones N. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 655-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar), GLR1(glutathione reductase) (18Grant C.M. Collinson L.P. Roe J.H. Dawes I.W. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 21: 171-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar), and YCF1 (yeast cadmium factor, a glutathione S-conjugate pump)(19). More recently, Morgan showed that the induction of TRX2 and TRR1(thioredoxin reductase) by H2O2 requires a co-operation between Yap1 and Skn7 (11Morgan B.A. Banks G.R. Toone W.M. Raitt D. Kuge S. Johnston L.H. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1035-1044Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). YAP1 function can be activated by H2O2, diamide, and diethylmaleate (9Kuge S. Jones N. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 655-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar, 20Hirata D. Yano K. Miyakawa T. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1993; 242: 250-256Crossref Scopus (80) Google Scholar), and this activation is attributed to a redox stress-imposed nuclear redistribution of the protein involving the nuclear export receptor Crm1 (Xpo1) (21Kuge S. Jones N. Nomoto A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1710-1720Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar, 22Kuge S. Toda T. Lizuka N. Nomoto A. Genes Cells. 1998; 3: 521-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Yap1 is also important in cadmium tolerance because deletion of its gene results in a cadmium-hypersensitive phenotype (19Wemmie J.A. Szczypka M.S. Thiele D.J. Moye-Rowley W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32592-32597Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Hirata D. Yano K. Miyakawa T. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1993; 242: 250-256Crossref Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 23Wu A. Wemmie J.A. Edgington N.P. Goebl M. Guevara J.L. Moye-Rowley W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18850-18858Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This function is attributed to the control by Yap1 of GSH1 (13Wu A. Moye-Rowley W.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5832-5839Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and of YCF1 (19Wemmie J.A. Szczypka M.S. Thiele D.J. Moye-Rowley W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32592-32597Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to its involvement in the oxidative stress response, Skn7 is implicated in the control of cell wall biosynthesis, cell cycle, and the osmotic stress response. Overexpression of SKN7 can suppress the cell wall assembly mutation kre9 (24Brown L.L. Bussey H. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 6908-6915Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and the growth defect associated with apkc1 null deletion (15Brown J.L. Bussey H. Stewart R.C. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5186-5194Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Overexpression of SKN7also suppresses the lethality associated with loss of the G1 transcription factors SBF and MBF (16Morgan B.A. Bouquin N. Merril G.F. Johnston L.H. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5679-5689Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Skn7 is modulated by the Sln1-Ypd1 osmosensor and contributes to regulation of the HOG osmo-stress pathway (25Ketela T. Brown J.L. Stewart R.C. Bussey H. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1998; 259: 372-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The involvement of Skn7 into such diverse pathways raises the question of the possible connection between these pathways. We sought to further analyze the co-operative functions of Yap1 and Skn7 in the control of the oxidative and cadmium stress responses and found that these two regulators do not always act together in these stress responses. Although both Yap1 and Skn7 are important for resistance to H2O2, only Yap1 is important for cadmium resistance, whereas Skn7 is not only dispensable but appears to negatively affect this response. The role of Yap1 and Skn7 in the induction of defense genes by H2O2 was further analyzed by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. The data presented here identify, within a large Yap1 stress response regulon, a gene subset that also requires Skn7 for its control. This partition of the Yap1 regulon correlates with two distinct classes of defense genes. Such a specialization within the oxidative stress response may explain the dissociated function of Yap1 and Skn7 in H2O2 and cadmium resistance. All studies were performed with the wild type strain YPH98 (26Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (MATa ura3-52 lys2-801amber ade2-101ochre trp1-Δ1leu2-Δ1) and its isogenic derivatives yap1Δ-1 (yap1::LEU2), skn7Δ-1 (skn7::TRP1), yap1Δ-1, andskn7Δ-1 (yap1::LEU2, skn7::TRP1). The composition of synthetic complete, rich broth, and glucose selective media are described elsewhere (27Rose M.D. Winston F. Hieter P. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1990Google Scholar). Strains were transformed by electroporation as described (28Guthrie C. Fink G.R. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 182-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar). H2O2, t-BOOH, and cadmium sulfate were purchased from Sigma. The 12CA5 anti-HA and the 9E10 anti-Myc monoclonal antibody were purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Standard protocols and buffers were used (29Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Gene disruptions were performed by the one-step gene disruption technique (28Guthrie C. Fink G.R. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 182-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar). pSKN7 is a YEp351 plasmid carrying a 3.5-kb genomic fragment containing the entireSKN7 gene (24Brown L.L. Bussey H. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 6908-6915Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). pSKN7-HA is a tagged version ofSKN7 in which the HA epitope was introduced at theSKN7 PstI site 28 codons downstream of the ATG (15Brown J.L. Bussey H. Stewart R.C. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5186-5194Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Theskn7::TRP1 construct used to createskn7Δ-1 lacks an internal 1.5-kbPvuII-HincII fragment of the wild typeSKN7 gene, which has been replaced by the TRP1gene (24Brown L.L. Bussey H. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 6908-6915Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The yap1::LEU2 construct used to createyap1Δ-1 was prepared by removing the YAP1coding sequence from the BamHI site (+186) to theKpnI site (+1650) relative to the ATG and replacing it with the LEU2 gene. pYAP1 was constructed by subcloning a 2.5-kb EcoRI DNA fragment carrying the entireYAP1 gene (12Moye-Rowley W.S. Harshma K.D. Parker C.S. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 283-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar) into pRS426. pMF6(X-H) is a PUC18 plasmid lacking the AccI polylinker site and carrying the same 2.5-kb EcoRI YAP1 fragment. To generate pYAP1-9Myc, a polymerase chain reaction-amplified 390-bp sequence encoding 9 Myc epitopes was first introduced in vector pMF6(X-H) into the YAP1 AccI site located two codons downstream of the ATG; The YAP1-9Myc fusion was then subcloned at the EcoRI site of pRS426 to generate pYAP1-9Myc. The functionality of the YAP1-9Myc construct was evaluated by its ability to rescue the H2O2-hypersensitive phenotype ofyap1Δ-1. The TSA1-lacZ gene fusions were constructed as follows: a 4.5-kb DNA fragment spanning the entirelacZ coding sequence from the BamHI site, two codons downstream of the ATG to a KpnI site approximately 1 kb from the stop codon, was subcloned into pRS424 to generate pMT1. ANaeII to KpnI 328-bp plasmid fragment containing the α peptide lacZ sequence was then removed from pMT1 to generate pMT11. TSA1 promoter fragments corresponding to −1000, −837, −403, −243, and −204 to +1 relative to the ATG were amplified by polymerase chain reaction from genomic DNA and subcloned between the XhoI and BamHI sites of pMT11. Patch assays were performed as follows: 10-μl aliquots containing approximately 2 × 103cells of an overnight culture were spotted on rich broth or synthetic complete solid plates containing H2O2, t-BOOH, or cadmium sulfate at the indicated concentration. Plates were monitored after 3–6 days incubation at 30 °C. Yeast cells from overnight culture were diluted to an A 600 of 0.01 in synthetic complete medium and incubated with shaking at 30 °C until they reached an A 600 of 0.3. The cells were then aliquoted and incubated in the absence or in the presence of H2O2 (0.2 mm) for 20 min. Total RNA was prepared by the hot phenol method (30Schmitt M.E. Brown T.A. Trumpower B.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 3091-3092Crossref PubMed Scopus (1152) Google Scholar). For each condition tested, 20-μg RNA samples were loaded per lane on an agarose gel containing formaldehyde, separated by electrophoresis, transferred to a nylon membrane (Bio-Rad), and hybridized with the indicated random primed (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) 32P-labeled DNA probe. Hybridization of each blot with a small nuclear RNAU3 (SNR17A) specific 32P-labeled DNA probe served as a RNA loading control. Pre-hybridization, hybridization, and washes were carried out as described (29Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Hybridized membranes were exposed for autoradiography. Yeast crude extracts used in EMSAs were prepared as follows. Cells were grown to an A 600 of 0.3 and were left untreated or were treated with H2O2(0.6 mm) for 5 min and harvested. Extracts were prepared by glass bead disruption as described previously (7Godon C. Lagniel G. Lee J. Buhler J.-M. Kieffer S. Perrot M. Boucherie H. Toledano M.B. Labarre J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22480-22489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar), except for the use of a modified breakage buffer containing 200 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, complete mixture inhibitor (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The DNA binding reactions were carried out in 1× TC buffer (25 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, pH 8, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1% (v/v) CHAPS, 10% (v/v) glycerol) with 20 μg of crude yeast extracts, 5–15 fmol [32P]ATP-labeled probe, 1 μg of poly(dI-dC) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in a total volume of 20 μl. The binding reaction was incubated for 5 min at room temperature and subjected to electrophoresis in a 6% polyacrylamide gel (acrylamide/N,N′-methylenebisacrylamide weight ratio, 27.5:1) in 45 mm Tris/45 mm boric acid/1 mm EDTA for 1 h at 200 V. Measurement of the H2O2 response was carried out as described previously (7Godon C. Lagniel G. Lee J. Buhler J.-M. Kieffer S. Perrot M. Boucherie H. Toledano M.B. Labarre J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22480-22489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). Basically, mid-log cells (A 600 = 0.3) were exposed or not to H2O2 (0.2 mm) for 15 min, pulse labeled with [35S]methionine for another 15 min, and harvested. An equal aliquot of 3H-labeled cells was mixed to the35S-labeled cells and served as an internal protein concentration standard for each two-dimensional gel spot. Cell mixtures were extracted and subjected to comparative two-dimensional gel analysis. Accordingly, the previously identified 71 proteins of the H2O2 stimulon were analyzed in wild type and isogenic yap1Δ-1, and skn7Δ-1. Uninduced and H2O2-induced synthesis rate indexes (ratio of individual [35S]/[3H] spot ratios to the Act1p [35S]/[3H] spot ratio) were calculated in each strain for the 71 H2O2-stimulated proteins. Specific DNA sequences were searched within 1 kilobase from the initiation codon of identified genes with the Saccharomyces Genome Data Base package. Searches were done with the following query sequences: T(T/G)ACTAA, which corresponds to the known Yap1 recognition sequences (YRE) (9Kuge S. Jones N.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1035-1044Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar), skn7Δ-1 can tolerate higher concentrations of H2O2 (Fig.1 A). The same phenotypic profile is seen in the tolerance of t-BOOH (Fig. 1 B). Another functional distinction is the ability of YAP1overexpression to partially rescue the skn7Δ-1 peroxide-hypersensitive phenotype, whereas SKN7overexpression has no effect in yap1Δ-1 (Fig.1 B). Analysis of the cadmium tolerance further demonstrates the distinctive roles of Yap1 and Skn7 in controlling stress responses (Fig. 1 C). Whereas yap1Δ-1 is hypersensitive to cadmium (19Wemmie J.A.

The double delete yap1Δ-1,skn7Δ-1 is hypersensitive to cadmium, suggesting that the skn7Δ-1 cadmium hyperresistance phenotype is dependent upon YAP1. Therefore, Yap1 and Skn7 have distinctive roles in peroxide stress tolerance and opposite effects upon cadmium tolerance, with Yap1 acting positively and Skn7 acting negatively. A negative role for Skn7 is also suggested by the decreased cadmium tolerance observed upon overexpression ofSKN7 (not shown). These results prompted us to evaluate the role of Yap1 and Skn7 in the control of known H2O2-inducible target genes. Yap1 and Skn7 co-operate to activate TRX2 and TRR1 in response to H2O2 (11Morgan B.A. Banks G.R. Toone W.M. Raitt D. Kuge S. Johnston L.H. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1035-1044Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). We thus evaluated by Northern blot the respective roles of Yap1 and Skn7 in the control of three other known Yap1 targets, SSA1 (31Stephen D.W.S. Rivers S.L. Jamieson D.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 16: 415-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), GSH1 (13Wu A. Moye-Rowley W.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5832-5839Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and GLR1 (18Grant C.M. Collinson L.P. Roe J.H. Dawes I.W. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 21: 171-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar), and of four other H2O2-inducible genes, TSA1 (TSA or peroxiredoxin), AHP1 (an alkyl hydroperoxide reductase) (32Lee J. Spector D. Godon C. Labarre J. Toledano M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4537-4544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), CCP1 (cytochrome c peroxidase), andHSP82 (7Godon C. Lagniel G. Lee J. Buhler J.-M. Kieffer S. Perrot M.

The genes analyzed were all potently induced by H2O2 in wild type cells, and this induction was abolished inyap1Δ-1 (Fig. 2, A and B). Inskn7Δ-1 cells, the induction by H2O2 was also abolished for TSA1,CCP1, TRR1, HSP82, and SSA1and significantly diminished for TRX2 and AHP1(Fig. 2 A). In contrast, induction of GLR1 andGSH1 by H2O2 was actually stronger in skn7Δ-1 than in wild type cells (Fig. 2B). However, inyap1Δ-1,skn7Δ-1 double null cells, the induction of GSH1 by H2O2 was totally abolished, demonstrating that the H2O2-superinduced levels seen inskn7Δ-1 cells are dependent upon YAP1. Therefore, Yap1 and Skn7 co-operate in the control of several H2O2 target genes but have opposite effects in the control of other H2O2 target genes, with Yap1 acting positively and Skn7 acting negatively. These results may explain, at least in part, the opposite functions of Yap1 and Skn7 in cadmium tolerance. To further dissect the intricate functions of Yap1 and Skn7 in the control of the oxidative and metal stress responses, we searched for other target genes by comparative two-dimensional gel electrophoresis of total soluble yeast proteins. We recently identified with this method 71 proteins whose synthesis rate is significantly increased minutes after exposure to H2O2 (7Godon C. Lagniel G. Lee J. Buhler J.-M. Kieffer S. Perrot M. Boucherie H. Toledano M.B. Labarre J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22480-22489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). We sought to identify among these proteins those whose induction by H2O2 would be lost or significantly diminished in yap1Δ-1. Exponentially growing wild type andyap1Δ-1 cells were pulse-labeled after exposure to H2O2 for 15 min and then subjected to two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (Fig.3, A–C ). Uninduced and H2O2-induced synthesis rate indexes of the 71 H2O2 targets were calculated inyap1Δ-1 and divided by those of the wild type strain (yap1Δ-1/WT). 31 proteins with ayap1Δ-1/WT-induced synthesis rate index ratio equal to or below the value of 0.6 were considered as dependent upon Yap1 for their induction by H2O2. Their synthesis rate indexes are represented in Fig. 4. These proteins were sorted into functional classes (TableI). The Yap1 regulon includes most of the oxidant scavenging enzymes. These are, in addition to those mentioned above, cytosolic catalase (Ctt1p), copper/zinc and manganese superoxide dismutases (Sod1p and Sod2p), YDR453Cp, and YOL151Wp. YDR453Wp is an AhpC/TSA family member, and YOL151Wp is similar to plant NADPH isoflavonoid reductases shown to rescue the diamide hypersensitivity phenotype of a yap1 null strain (33Babiychuck E. Kushnir S. Belles-Boix E. Van Montagu M. Inzé D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26224-26231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The Yap1 regulon also includes several carbohydrate metabolism enzymes, a few heat shock proteins and proteases, amino acid metabolism enzymes, and other unclassified or unknown proteins.Figure 4Basal and H2O2-stimulated synthesis rate indexes of the proteins of the Yap1-controlled regulon.

NADH dehydrogenase or complex I (CI) is affected in most of the mitochondrial diseases and in some neurodegenerative disorders. We have studied the physiological consequences of a partial CI inhibition at the cellular level. We used a genetic model (40% CI-inhibited human-ape xenomitochondrial cybrids) and a drug-induced model (0–100% CI-inhibited cells using different concentrations of rotenone). We observed a quantitative correlation between the level of CI impairment and cell respiration, cell growth, free radical production, lipid peroxidation, mitochondrial membrane potential, and apoptosis. We showed that cell death was quantitatively associated with free radical production rather than with a decrease in respiratory chain function. The results obtained with human xenomitochondrial cybrid cells were compatible with those observed in rotenone-induced 40% CI-inhibited cells. At high concentrations (5–6-fold higher than the concentration necessary for 100% CI inhibition), rotenone showed a second toxic effect at the level of microtubule assembly, which also led to apoptosis.

A CI deficiency is characteristic of mitochondrial diseases, as an isolated defect or, in most of the cases, as a part of multiple respiratory chain deficiencies. Isolated CI deficiency has been associated with a wide spectrum of symptomatic phenotypes, varying from fatal infantile lactic acidosis to some cases of Leigh's disease, adult onset exercise intolerance, and some neurodegenerative diseases as Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON), focal dystonia, and Parkinson's disease (3Robinson B.H.

The study of transmitochondrial cell lines harboring mtDNA from LHON patients helped explain the role of some mtDNA-coded CI subunits. Cybrids carrying the mtDNA G11778A mutation in the ND4 gene associated with LHON showed a decrease in cell respiration, but no enzymatic deficiency was detected by spectrophotometry (7Hofhaus G. Attardi G. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3043-3048Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Jun et al. (8Jun A.S. Trounce I.A. Brown M.D. Shoffner J.M. Wallace D.C. Mol. Cell.

The function of the ND4 and ND5 subunits was studied by the characterization of rotenone-resistant mutants of a human cell line that in addition to nuclear mutations were also defective in these mtDNA-encoded CI subunits (9Hofhaus G.

In addition, cybrid lines created using mtDNA from Parkinson's disease patients showed a CI deficiency and increased free radical production (11Swerdlow R.H. Parks J.K. Miller S.W. Tuttle J.B.

The CI impairment was caused by a limited number of amino acid differences in mtDNA-coded subunits (between human and the three apes used in the creation of HXC). All these genetic models of CI deficiency have helped us assess the physiological effects of a particular level of complex I inhibition. Some specific complex I inhibitors have been classically used to model CI deficiencies. Rotenone is an inhibitor of the NADH dehydrogenase, which shuts off the supply of electrons to the quinol (QH2)-cytochrome c oxidoreductase (14Chance B. Hollunger G. J. Biol. Chem. 1963; 238: 418-431Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 1-Methyl-4-phenylpyridinium, the bioactivated product of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine, binds to the rotenone-binding site, thereby limiting CI activity (15Ramsay R.R. Singer T.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 189: 47-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Inhibition of CI by rotenone or 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium not only leads to a decline in mitochondrial ATP production but also enhances the generation of free radical by the mitochondrial respiratory chain and initiates lipid peroxidation reaction in isolated bovine heart mitochondria or submitochondrial particles (16Takeshige K. Minakami S. Biochem. J. 1979; 180: 129-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 17Takayanagi R. Takeshige K. Minakami S. Biochem.

Because 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine causes Parkinson's disease in humans (20Langston J.W. Ballard P. Tetrud J. Irwin I. Science. 1983; 219: 979-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (3963) Google Scholar) and rats (21Chiueh C.C. Markey S.P. Burns R.S. Johannessen J.N. Jacobowitz D.M. Kopin I.J. Psychopharmacol. Bull. 1984; 20: 548-553PubMed Google Scholar), these data suggested a role for CI deficiency and increased oxidative stress in Parkinson's disease substantia nigra and in the dopaminergic cell death in this disorder (22Cleeter M.W. Cooper J.M. Schapira A.H. J. Neurochem. 1992; 58: 786-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). The underlying physiological consequences of a partial complex I inhibition at the cellular level remain mostly unknown. Here we report the effect of different levels of CI impairment on the cell physiology. We used a genetic model (40% CI inhibited HXC lines; Ref. 13Barrientos A. Kenyon L. Moraes C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14210-14217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), and a drug-induced model (partial CI inhibition in the human osteosarcoma-derived cell line 143B) with rotenone to quantitatively correlate CI inhibition and its effect on cell respiration, cell growth, free radical production, lipid peroxidation, mitochondrial membrane potential, and apoptosis. Human xenomitochondrial cybrids (HXC) (human-chimpanzee clone HC1, human-gorilla HG13, and human-pigmy chimpanzee clone HP4) were produced and reported previously (12Kenyon L. Moraes C.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9131-9135Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). The human osteosarcoma-derived cell line 143B(TK−) and its mtDNA-less derivative, 143B/206 ρ°, were cultured as described (23King M.P. Attardi G. Science. 1989; 246: 500-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (1456) Google Scholar). Culture conditions were modified as described below under “Growth Curves.” SUB21 cell line (transmitochondrial cybrid clone containing wild type mtDNA) was previously characterized (24Hao H. Moraes C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2347-2352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) and used in some experiments as a human control cell line. We modeled a partial CI inhibition by treating the osteosarcoma cell line 143B with different concentrations of the CI inhibitor rotenone. To define the model and to assess how the CI (NADH decylubiquinone reductase) inhibition affects the KCN-sensitive endogenous cell respiration, 143B cells were treated for 24 h with 0–1 μm rotenone. CI was measured spectrophotometrically in isolated mitochondria, and cell respiration was measured polarographically in whole cells as described previously (13Barrientos A. Kenyon L. Moraes C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14210-14217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). In all the experiments, the culture medium was changed 2 h before harvesting the cells. To validate the results obtained, a genetic model of CI deficiency was used. The model consisted in HXC lines harboring mtDNA from common chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes), pigmy chimpanzee (Pan paniscus), and gorilla (Gorilla gorilla; Ref. 12Kenyon L. Moraes C.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9131-9135Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). HXC cells showed an approximately 20% decrease in the cell respiration and a 40% decrease in the CI activity (13Barrientos A. Kenyon L. Moraes C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14210-14217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). To determine whether the CI inhibition induced adaptive variations on the expression of the complex I and II subunits, immunoblotting was performed as described previously. 40 μg of mitochondrial proteins from 143B cells treated with rotenone during 24 h were used, as well as human succinate dehydrogenase flavoprotein subunit (SDH (Fp)) monoclonal and human ND1 polyclonal antibodies. After scanning the autoradiograms, band signals were quantified using NIH Image 1.62b7 software. The ratio between the different bands (ND1/SDH ratio) was considered as the division of the arbitrary densitometric values of the signals using each antibody. These ratios were used to compare untreated and rotenone-treated 143B cells. Growth measurements were made by platting 5 × 104 cells on 100-cm2 dishes in 10 ml of the appropriate medium. Cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium lacking glucose supplemented with 5 mmglucose or Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium lacking glucose supplemented with 5 mm galactose, both supplemented with 1 mm pyruvate and 10% dialyzed fetal calf serum. Cells were incubated at 37 °C, and cell counts were performed at daily intervals. For 143B and 143B/206 ρ° cells, medium was supplemented with different concentrations (0–1 μm) of rotenone. HXC lines (13Barrientos A. Kenyon L. Moraes C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14210-14217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) were grown in media with glucose or galactose without rotenone supplementation. For each assay, three independent samples from each cell type (human control lines SUB21 and 143B and the HXC lines HP4, HG13, and HC1), either intact cells (independently collected) or isolated mitochondria (independently isolated), were analyzed, and at least three measurements of each sample were obtained. To reproduce different degrees of CI inhibition, various concentrations of rotenone (0–600 nm) were added to 143B cells at approximately 80% confluence. After 4, 24, 48, and 72 h the oxidative stress determinations were conducted. Experiments were performed in triplicate. To monitor oxidative activity, the cell-permeant probe 2′-7′ dichlorofluorescein diacetate (H2DCFDA) was used. H2DCFDA passively diffuse into cells where intracellular esterases cleave the acetates, and the oxidation of H2DCF by hydrogen peroxide produces a fluorescent response (25Cathcart R. Schwiers E. Ames B.N. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 134: 111-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (733) Google Scholar). Cells were collected by trypsinization. 50 μg of cellular protein were resuspended in 500 μl of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) medium and labeled with H2DCFDA (2 μg/ml) (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) for 10–60 min in the dark at 37 °C. Fluorometric analyses at 507 nm excitation and 530 nm emission were performed using a MPF-66 fluorescence spectrophotometer (Perkin-Elmer Corp.). For all the measurements, the basal fluorescence (time 0,t 0) was subtracted. The increase in the fluorescence was used to measure the chemical process of hydrogen peroxide production. Peroxidation of cellular lipids was measured using 50 μg of cellular protein resuspended in 500 μl of PBS and labeled with cis-parinaric acid (5 mm) (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) (26Kuypers F.A. van den Berg J.J. Schalkwijk C. Roelofsen B. Op den Kamp J.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 921: 266-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) for 10–60 min in the dark at 37 °C. Cells were washed by pelleting to remove excess probe, and fluorescence at 318 nm excitation and 410 nm emission was detected as described (27Hedley D. Chow S. Cytometry. 1992; 13: 686-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Loss of parinaric acid fluorescence was used to measure the chemical process of lipid peroxidation. To measure peroxidation of mitochondrial membranes lipids, 50 μg of fresh mitochondrial protein were resuspended in 500 μl of medium A. The experimental conditions were the same as described above. Δψm was estimated using 5,5′,6,6′-tetrachloro-1,1′,3,3′-tetraethylbenzimidazole carbocyanide iodide (JC-1). JC-1 is a fluorescent compound (excitation maximum, 490 nm) that exists as a monomer at low concentrations. At higher concentrations, JC-1 forms aggregates. Fluorescence of the monomer is green (emission, 527 nm), whereas that of the J-aggregate is red (emission, 590 nm). Mitochondria with intact membrane potential (higher than 100 mV) concentrate JC-1 into aggregates that fluoresce red, whereas de-energized mitochondria cannot concentrate JC-1 and fluoresce green (28Smiley S.T. Reers M. Mottola-Hartshorn C. Lin M. Chen A. Smith T.W. Steele Jr., G.D. Chen L.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3671-3675Crossref PubMed Scopus (1295) Google Scholar). Changes in plasma membrane potential do not affect the JC-1 status. JC-1 was chosen because has been described as a reliable probe for analyzing Δψm changes in intact cells, whereas other different probes capable of binding mitochondria show a lower sensitivity (rhodamine 123) or a noncoherent behavior due to a high sensitivity to changes in plasma membrane potential (3–3′-dihexilocarbocyanide iodide) (29Salvioli S. Ardizzoni A. Franceschi C. Cossarizza A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 411: 77-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (895) Google Scholar). Cells were grown in 25-cm2 dishes until 90% confluence and incubated for 45 min with 6.5 μm JC-1. Cells were collected by trypsinization, washed in PBS, and resuspended in 500 μl of PBS, and the samples were measured on a MPF-66 fluorescence spectrophotometer (Perkin-Elmer Corp.). The ratio of the reading at 590 nm to the reading at 527 nm (590/527 ratio) was considered as a relative Δψm value. The apoptotic rotenone-induced cell death was assessed using a cell death detection enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Approximately 104 cells were used for the photometric enzyme immunoassay of cytoplasmic histone-associated DNA fragments after rotenone-induced cell death. 143B and 143B/206 ρ° were treated with different concentrations of rotenone and harvested at 24–72 h. To study the role of the mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT) pore in the rotenone-induced cell death, cells were pretreated for 30 min with 5 μm of the MPT inhibitor cyclosporin A (CyA) and incubated for 48 h, changing the medium every 8.5 h. As CyA is only able to prevent MPT in short term experiments, the assay was repeated with 15- and 30-h incubation periods and using 5 μm CyA and 50 μm of the phospholipase A2 inhibitor aristolochic acid (ArA) (Sigma), which enhances and prolongs the effect of CyA (30Imberti R. Nieminen A.L. Herman B. Lemasters J.J. Res. Commun. Chem. Pathol. Pharmacol. 1992; 78: 27-38PubMed Google Scholar, 31Pastorino J.G. Chen S.T. Tafani M. Snyder J.W. Farber J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7770-7775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). The culture medium was changed after 15 h when necessary, and the cells were processed after 30 h. 143B and 143B/206 ρo cells were seeded on glass coverslips and treated with different concentrations of rotenone for 24 h. Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS, permeabilized with 0.1% saponin, and incubated for 4 h with monoclonal antibody anti-α-tubulin (Sigma). A Texas Red-conjugated AfiniPure donkey anti-mouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc., West Grove, PA) was used as secondary antibody. Coverslips were incubated for 30 min with 10 μg/ml bis-benzimide Hoechst 3342 (Sigma) to reveal the nuclei and mounted onto glass slides with ProLongTM Antifade kit (Molecular Probes). Fluorescence was inspected with a Wild Leitz photomicroscope (Fluovert. Heerbrugg, Switzerland). The data were analyzed using the SPSS software. Results are expressed as the means ± S.D. Comparisons between cell line groups were carried out using a Levane's test (for equality of variances) and the Student's t test (for equality of means) for independent data. When a potential relationship between variables was of interest, a linear regression analysis was performed. Values with p < 0.050 were considered statistically significant. The rotenone-induced model was created by titrating the effect of different concentrations of the drug on the CI activity, measured as NADH decylubiquinone reductase. Exposure of 143B cells to increasing concentrations of rotenone produced a progressive inhibition of CI activity in isolated mitochondria (Fig.1). A 100% inhibition was achieved with 100 nm rotenone. The endogenous cell respiration was also inhibited in a dose-dependent manner but showed different inhibition kinetics (Fig. 1). CI inhibition followed a classical hyperbolic shape, whereas cell respiration inhibition showed an S-shaped curve. Only when CI was inhibited by 35–40% (< 5 nm rotenone), cell respiration begun to decrease. Between 40 and 60% of CI inhibition (5–10 nm rotenone), cell respiration decreased linearly until 30% of the normal rate. Increasing concentrations of rotenone produced further but slower decrease in CI activity and cell respiration. This cellular model of CI deficiency is caused by a limited number of amino acid changes in mtDNA-coded subunits (i.e. those amino acids that differ between humans and the three apes used in the creation of HXC (13Barrientos A. Kenyon L. Moraes C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14210-14217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). To determine whether the inhibition of CI induced adaptative variations on the expression of the complex I and II subunits, immunoblotting was performed. Using mitochondria isolated from cells incubated with different concentrations of rotenone for 24 h, no significant changes in the ND1/SDH(Fp) ratio were observed (Fig.2). A rotenone-induced CI deficiency did not produce an adaptive response in the form of an increased expression of the complex II (CII) in a period of 24 h. Respiratory competent 143B cells grew exponentially in medium containing glucose as carbon source, and they showed a substantial, although slightly reduced, growth rate in galactose-containing medium (Fig. 3 A). The doubling time in glucose (D Glu) was approximately 17 h, and in galactose (D Gal) it was 20 h (Fig.3 C). When 143B/206 ρ° cells were cultured in a medium in which glucose is substituted for galactose, these cells died and detached from the culture plate in less than 12 h (Fig.3 A), because galactose cannot be used efficiently for glycolysis. HXC, having a 40% CI deficiency, grew well in glucose-containing medium, with a D Glu of 23 h, but grew very poorly in galactose-containing medium with aD Gal almost four times higher (Fig. 3). 143B cells were susceptible to the toxic properties of rotenone so that increasing concentrations (between 0 and 500 nm) produced progressively greater inhibition of the growth rate. Fig. 3 Bshows that 143B cells can grow in galactose medium in the presence of 5 nm rotenone (concentration inducing 54% of CI inhibition, Fig. 1) but not in the presence of 7.5 nm (72% of CI inhibition, Fig. 1). HXC cells grew in galactose medium if supplemented with less than 1 nm rotenone (concentration that produced approximately 19% of CI inhibition, Fig. 1). The rotenone-induced inhibition was additive to the genetically produced 40% deficiency in these cells. Fig. 3 C compares growth parameters of the cell lines studied in the different culture conditions. The growth of the 143B/206 ρ° in glucose medium was affected by rotenone at concentrations ≥500 nm (the growth rate with 500 nm rotenone was 30% slower than untreated cells), and cells did not grow at a concentration of 600 nm. These data indicated that rotenone kills cells in a CI inhibition-independent way, when present at concentrations substantially higher than that producing complete CI inhibition in 143B cells. We studied whether a 40% deficiency in CI activity resulted in greater reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in HXC lines. ROS production was estimated using H2DCF, a dye that is converted to a fluorescent product upon oxidation by hydrogen peroxide. Fig.4 A shows ROS production as a function of time. The slope of the regression lines was significantly higher in the HC (5.64 ± 0.25; p < 0.002), HP (5.07 ± 0.31; p < 0.016), and HG (5.09 ± 0.57; p < 0.050) xenomitochondrial cell lines compared with the set of values obtained for the 143B (4.22 ± 0.40) and SUB21 (4.67 ± 0.32) control cell lines. The electron transport in HXC may be inefficiently coupled to ATP synthesis, producing an increase in the rate of ROS formation. Lipid peroxidation is a deleterious consequence of oxidative stress. To determine whether the observed increase in the rate of ROS production in the HXC cell lines produced a higher lipid peroxidation of the membranes in these cells, the loss of cis-parinaric acid fluorescence was used to measure the chemical process of lipid peroxidation (26Kuypers F.A. van den Berg J.J. Schalkwijk C. Roelofsen B. Op den Kamp J.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 921: 266-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). In a whole cell assay, the time course of the fluorescence decrease showed no significant differences among cell lines (Fig. 4 B). However, when using isolated mitochondria, an increase in the membrane lipid peroxidation was observed in HXC cells (Fig. 4 C). The fluorescence value at the start of the reaction (t 0) subtracted by the value measured after 30 min (t 30), was 1.36-fold higher in HC (p = 0.015), 1.48-fold higher in HP (p = 0.044), and 1.51-fold higher in HG (p = 0.036), compared with the mean values obtained for the control human cell lines. ROS production and mitochondrial membrane lipid peroxidation were enhanced by incubation of cells with rotenone (Fig. 5,A and B). Both parameters increased roughly linearly when concentrations of 0–100 nm rotenone were used (concentration range to produce CI inhibition) but did not increase significantly at higher concentrations. At the same concentration of rotenone, both parameters increased with longer treatment (between 4 and 72 h). A CI deficiency leads to a reduction in proton extrusion to the intermembrane space, partially depleting the cells from ATP. These factors, together with the associated increase in oxidative stress, could produce a significant drop of the mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψm). The dye JC-1 was used to monitor Δψm, estimated as the 590/527 nm emission ratio. Used as low Δψm controls, 143B/206 ρo value was 30–32% of 143B, and 143B cells incubated for 45 min with 10 μm of the uncoupler carbonyl-cyanidem-chlorophenylhydrazone showed an estimated Δψm corresponding to 45–48% of the 143B value (Fig.5 C). HXC lines exhibited a Δψm that was 83–87% of the 143B level. Rotenone-treated 143B cells showed a mild decrease in their Δψm (Fig. 5 C). Low concentrations of rotenone (between 1 and 10 nm), produced a consistent hyperpolarization of the mitochondrial membrane (a reproducible 15–18% increase compared with the control level) when cells were incubated with the drug for 4 h. At those concentrations, the Δψm was maintained above 80% of the normal value. Only in cells that were incubated for 3 days with concentrations of rotenone between 100 and 600 nm did their Δψm decrease to 60–65% of the untreated 143B cell value. For each concentration of rotenone used, Δψmdecreased slightly with the time of incubation. 143B and 143B/206 ρ° were treated with different concentrations of rotenone and harvested at 24, 48, and 72 h. In 143B cells, cell death was increased with all concentrations of rotenone up to 10–13 times the level of untreated cells after 3 days of incubation with 100 nm rotenone (Fig.6 A). Higher concentrations increased cell death exponentially. Rotenone did not significantly kill 143B/206 ρ° cells until present at concentrations higher than 100 nm. Using 600 nm rotenone, both cell lines died at indistinguishable rates (Fig. 6 A). Experiments were carried out to test whether cell death in the presence of rotenone requires MPT. Fig. 6 B shows the ability of 5 μm CyA and 50 μm ArA to prevent cell death from taking place in the presence of different concentrations of rotenone during 15 and 30 h. CyA inhibits the opening of the MPT pore (32Fournier N. Ducet G. Crevat A. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1987; 19: 297-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar), and phospholipase A2 inhibitors, such as ArA, enhance and prolong this effect (30Imberti R. Nieminen A.L. Herman B. Lemasters J.J. Res. Commun. Chem. Pathol. Pharmacol. 1992; 78: 27-38PubMed Google Scholar, 31Pastorino J.G. Chen S.T. Tafani M. Snyder J.W. Farber J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7770-7775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). Because CyA is not able to maintain mitochondrial function, it did not prevent rotenone-induced apoptosis after long periods of rotenone treatment. In cells treated with rotenone for 48 h, CyA essentially did not inhibit apoptosis (15–30% inhibition), even with changing the medium and adding fresh CyA every 8.5 h (data not shown). These data indicate that additional CyA-resistant mechanisms can have a role in the rotenone-induced apoptosis. ArA prolongs the effect of CyA for at least 16 h (31Pastorino J.G. Chen S.T. Tafani M. Snyder J.W. Farber J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7770-7775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). We incubated the cells for 15 and 30 h with different concentrations of rotenone in the presence of CyA and ArA with a change of the medium in the latter at 15 h. When CyA and ArA were used in cells treated with < 500 nmrotenone, the cell death prevention was almost complete in the 15-h incubation experiments. However, cell death was prevented by 55–75% in the 30-h incubation experiments. In experiments using 600 nm of rotenone, cell death prevention dropped to under 50%. At these concentrations of rotenone, the mtDNA-less 143B/206 ρo cell"
https://openalex.org/W2088549259,"The Epstein-Barr virus-encoded latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1) is a pleiotropic protein the activities of which include effects on gene expression and cell transformation, growth, and death. LMP1 has been shown to induce nuclear factor (NF)-κB and c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase/AP-1 activities in target cells, and in this study we demonstrate that LMP1 also engages the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade, leading to activation of the transcription factor ATF2. Mutational analysis of the LMP1 cytoplasmic COOH terminus revealed that p38 activation occurs from both the tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor (TRAF)-interacting, membrane-proximal COOH-terminal activating region (CTAR)1 domain (amino acids 186–231) and the extreme tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated death domain (TRADD) binding CTAR2 region (amino acids 351–386). Because LMP1 also engages signaling on the NF-κB axis through CTAR1 and CTAR2, we have examined whether these two pathways are overlapping or independent. We have found that inhibition of p38 by the highly specific inhibitor SB203580 did not affect NF-κB binding activity. Conversely, although the metabolic inhibitor D609 blocked NF-κB activation, it did not impair the ability of LMP1 to signal on the p38 axis, suggesting that these two LMP1-mediated pathways are primarily independent. Divergence of signals must, however, occur downstream of TRAF2 as a dominant negative TRAF2 mutant that blocks LMP1-induced NF-κB activation also inhibited p38 signaling. In addition, we have found that p38 inhibition significantly impaired LMP1-mediated interleukin-6 and -8 expression. Thus, p38 may play a significant cooperative role in regulating at least some of the pleiotropic activities of LMP1.

EBV infects resting B cells, stimulates their proliferation, and induces the outgrowth of virus-transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines expressing the nuclear antigens EBNA1, EBNA2, EBNA3A, EBNA3B, EBNA3C, and EBNA-LP and the latent membrane proteins LMP1, LMP2A, and LMP2B (1Kieff E. Fields B.C. Knipe D.M. Howley P.M. Virology. Lippincott-Raven Press, New York1996: 2343-2396Google Scholar). Among the nuclear and membrane proteins expressed as a consequence of EBV infection, the latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1) is of particular interest because it induces the oncogenic transformation of rodent fibroblast cell lines (2Wang D. Liebowitz D. Kieff E. Cell. 1985; 43: 831-840Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (992) Google Scholar, 3Baichwal V.R. Sudgen B. Oncogene. 1988; 2: 461-467PubMed Google Scholar). LMP1 expression is also essential for EBV-mediated primary B cell transformation in vitro (1Kieff E. Fields B.C. Knipe D.M. Howley P.M. Virology.

Fields B.C. Knipe D.M. Howley P.M. Virology. Lippincott-Raven Press, New York1996: 2343-2396Google Scholar). Expression of this viral oncogene in B cells can induce a plethora of activities including up-regulation of cell surface markers such as CD23, CD40, and CD54 (intercellular adhesion molecule 1) and induction of anti-apoptotic proteins such as A20 and members of the Bcl-2 family (5–7; for review, see Ref. 8Young L.S. Dawson C.W. Eliopoulos A.G. Br. Med. Bull. 1997; 53: 509-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In epithelial cells, LMP1 can also induce A20, CD40, and CD54 expression and block differentiation, a property that may be important in the pathogenesis of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (9Dawson C.W. Rickinson A.B. Young L.S. Nature. 1990; 344: 777-780Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar, 10Fahraeus R. Rymo L. Rhim J.S. Klein G.

Of particular interest is the reported ability of LMP1 to induce production of cytokines such as interleukin-6 (IL-6) (12Eliopoulos A.G. Stack M. Dawson C.W. Kaye K.M. Hodgkin L. Sihota S. Rowe M. Young L.S. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 2899-2916Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar) and IL-10 (13Nakagomi H. Dolcetti R. Bejarano M.T. Pisa P. Kiessling R. Masucci M. Int. J. Cancer. 1994; 57: 240-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), suggesting that this viral protein may activate inflammatory and immune-regulatory responses following EBV infection. Structurally, LMP1 is a 63-kDa phosphoprotein comprising a short 23-amino acid NH2-terminal cytoplasmic domain, six membrane-spanning domains of 162 amino acids, and a long 200-amino acid COOH-terminal cytoplasmic tail. Mutational analysis has identified COOH-terminal regions of the protein as being essential for transformation and phenotypic changes. The 45 most membrane-proximal residues of the LMP1 COOH terminus (amino acids 186–231) are critical for EBV-mediated transformation of primary B cells, but recent studies suggest that the long term growth of these cells also requires the distal COOH-terminal sequences (amino acids 352–386) (4Kaye K.M. Izumi K.M. Mosialos G. Kieff E. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 675-683Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Moorthy R.K. Thorley-Lawson D.A. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 1638-1646Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Izumi K.M. Kieff E.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12592-12597Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). Interestingly, these two functional domains of the LMP1 cytoplasmic tail can also activate the transcription factor NF-κB, with the extreme COOH-terminal activating region 2 (CTAR2, amino acids 351–386) being the principal contributor to this effect in the majority of cell lines (6Huen D.S. Henderson S.A. Croom-Carter D. Rowe M. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 549-560PubMed Google Scholar, 7Laherty C.D. Hu H.M. Opipari A.W. Wang F. Dixit V.M. J. Biol.

This phenomenon can be attributed to the ability of CTAR2 to associate with tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor-associated death domain (TRADD) (15Izumi K.M. Kieff E.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12592-12597Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar), a protein that mediates NF-κB signaling from aggregated TNF receptor I (TNFRI) (17Hsu H. Xiong J. Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1995; 81: 495-504Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1749) Google Scholar). The proximal CTAR1 domain of LMP1 (amino acids 187–231) induces low levels of NF-κB through its direct interaction with TNFR-associated factor 2 (TRAF2) (18Kaye K.M. Devergne O. Harada J.N.

VanArsdale T. Ware C. Kieff E. Cell. 1995; 80: 389-399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (906) Google Scholar). Importantly, these CTAR1-TRAF interactions occur through a P204xQ206xT208 TRAF binding motif, common to the cytoplasmic tails of some TNFR family members such as CD40 and CD30. In addition to NF-κB, LMP1 expression signals for activation of a Ras/MAPK/ERK pathway (21Roberts M.L. Cooper N.R. Virology. 1998; 240: 93-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) and of the JNK (c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase, also known as the stress-activated protein kinase, SAPK) cascade (22Kieser A.

This phenomenon occurs through both CTAR1 and CTAR2 domains of the protein and appears to be mediated by the adaptor protein TRAF2. p38 activation has been observed in response to a variety of stimuli, including hyperosmotic shock, UV radiation, lipopolysaccharide treatment, and stimulation by certain cytokines such as IL-1 and TNF-α and requires phosphorylation of a closely spaced tyrosine and threonine residue in the activation domain of the protein (for review, see Refs. 25Ip Y.T.

In addition, inhibition of p38 activity has been shown to interfere with TNF-mediated NF-κB transactivation and to influence TNF-induced apoptosis (31Roulston A. Reinhard C. Amiri P. Williams L.T. J.

In agreement with these data we demonstrate that inhibition of p38 signaling impairs the ability of LMP1 to induce IL-6 and IL-8 expression. pSG5-based LMP1 and LMP1 deletion mutants Δ(332–386) and Δ(187–351) have been described previously (6Huen D.S. Henderson S.A. Croom-Carter D. Rowe M. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 549-560PubMed Google Scholar). pSG5-LMP1AxAxA was generated by site-directed mutagenesis using the QuickChangeTM site-directed mutagenesis kit of Stratagene and pSG5-LMP1 as substrate. The mutated oligonucleotide primers used were: 5′-CCTCCCGCACGCTCAAGCAGCTGCCGATGA-3′ and its complementary. pSG5-LMP1AxAxA/378STOP was generated by a similar approach using the mutated primers 5′-GATGACGACCCCCACTGACCAGTTCAGCTAAGC-3′ and its complementary and pSG5LMP1AxAxA as substrate. These mutations generate a STOP codon at position 378 of the amino acid sequence of LMP1 and were verified by sequencing. pSG5CD2.192-LMP1 has been described previously (35Floettmann J.E. Rowe M. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 1851-1858Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). pIND-LMP1 was generated by excision of LMP1 coding sequences from pSG5-LMP1 using EcoRI digestion and subsequent insertion into the EcoRI site of the pIND vector (Invitrogen). The 181-bp IL-8 promoter sequences (−135 to +46) were PCR amplified from human genomic DNA using the following primers: 5′-GTGAGATCTGAAGTGTGATGACTCAGG-3′ (IL8P-Forward), which contains an artificial BglII site, and 5′-GTGAAGCTTGAAGCTTGTGTGCTCTGC-3′ (IL8P-Reverse), which contains an artificial HindIII site. The PCR product was then digested withBglII/HindIII and inserted into the corresponding restriction sites of the luciferase reporter plasmid pGL2-Basic (Promega) to generate IL8-Luc. To generate the mutAP-1/IL8-Luc vector that contains the same IL-8 promoter sequences but with a double mutation that distorts the AP-1 consensus, the 5′-GTGAGATCTGAAGTGTGATATCTCAGG-3′ (mut-IL8P-Forward) was used together with IL8P-Reverse. The PCR product was again digested withBglII/HindIII and ligated into pGL2-Basic. The hemagglutinin (HA)-p46SAPKγ-pcDNA3 and HA-p38 vectors were a gift from James Woodgett (The Ontario Cancer Institute, Ontario, Canada), and the wild type and mutated TRAF2 expression vectors pcDNA3-TRAF2 and pcDNA3-TRAF2Δ(6–86), respectively, were kindly provided by George Mosialos, Ken Kaye, and Eliott Kieff (Harvard Medical School, Boston). The CMV-driven IκBα[S32A/S36A] construct has been described previously (12Eliopoulos A.G. Stack M. Dawson C.W. Kaye K.M. Hodgkin L. Sihota S. Rowe M. Young L.S. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 2899-2916Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). This double serine to alanine mutation inhibits degradation of IκBα, rendering it a constitutively active molecule. HEK 293 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 2 mm glutamine. For transient transfections, 8 × 105 HEK 293 cells were plated out on a 25-cm2 flask and the following day were transfected using a standard calcium phosphate technique. HeLa and Rat-1 cells, cultured in RPMI and 10% fetal calf serum supplemented with 2 mm glutamine were transfected using the PrimeFector lipofection kit (EquiBio Ltd, Kent, U. K.). The xanthogenate compound D609 (tricyclodecan-9-yl-xanthogenate potassium) was purchased from Calbiochem and dissolved in growth medium immediately before use. The p38 inhibitor SB203580 was purchased from Calbiochem, dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide, and stored at −20 °C. Luciferase reporter and β-galactosidase assays were performed as described previously (12Eliopoulos A.G. Stack M. Dawson C.W. Kaye K.M. Hodgkin L. Sihota S. Rowe M. Young L.S. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 2899-2916Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). 50 ng each of a CMV-driven β-galactosidase-expressing plasmid and of 3Enh.κB-ConALuc reporter, which contains three tandem repeats of the NF-κB sites from the Igκ promoter, were used routinely to transfect 293 cells. Alternatively, 293 cells were transfected with 50 ng of IL8-Luc or mutAP-1/IL8-Luc and 50 ng of β-galactosidase, whereas HeLa cells were transfected with 1 μg each of these reporter constructs. Analysis of luciferase and β-galactosidase expression was performed at 36 h post-transfection. Oligomerization of CD2/LMP1 chimeric protein was performed as described previously (35Floettmann J.E. Rowe M. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 1851-1858Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). JNKin vitro kinase assays were performed as described previously (24Eliopoulos A.G. Young L.S. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 1725-1736Crossref Scopus (252) Google Scholar). For phospho-p38 immunoblots or p38 kinase assays, cells were lysed in 300–500 μl of kinase lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 0.5% Triton X-100, 250 mmNaCl, 3 mm EGTA, 3 mm EDTA, 2 mmsodium vanadate, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm DTT) for 20 min on ice. Cell debris were removed by centrifugation, and the protein concentration was determined using a commercially available Bio-Rad protein assay. p38 MAPK was immunoprecipitated from 200–250 μg of total protein extracts using 1 μg of anti-HA antibody (Boehringer Mannheim) for 2 h and 25 μl of protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for an additional 1 h. After immunoprecipitation, beads were washed twice with kinase lysis buffer and twice with assay buffer (25 mmTris, pH 7.5, 5 mm β-glycerophosphate, 10 mmMgCl2, 2 mm DTT, 100 μm sodium vanadate, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin). After the last wash, the beads were drained using a fine gauge Hamilton syringe and resuspended in 50 μl of assay buffer containing 2 μg of GST-ATF2(19–96) substrate (New England Biolabs) and 200 μm ATP. Kinase reactions were carried out at 30 °C for 30 min and stopped by the addition of 25 μl of 3 × Laemmli buffer and boiling for 5 min. Samples were then analyzed on a 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and ATF2 phosphorylation was detected by immunoblot using a phospho-specific ATF2 antibody (New England Biolabs) which reacts with Thr69/Thr71 doubly phosphorylated ATF2 followed by densitometric analysis using a Bio-Rad GS-690 imaging densitometer. Immunoblot analysis of anti-HA immunoprecipitates using a control p38 antibody (New England Biolabs) was also performed to demonstrate that comparable amounts of HA-p38 were analyzed in cotransfection experiments. Phosphorylation of p38 was determined by immunoblot analysis of 50 μg of cell extracts using a phospho-specific p38 MAPK (Thr180/Tyr182) antibody (New England Biolabs). For LMP1 and TRAF2 immunoblotting, 25 μg of total cell lysates isolated as described above was analyzed on a 10% gel, and LMP1 or TRAF2 expression was detected with the anti-LMP1 mAbs CS.1–4 (36Rowe M. Evans H.S. Young L.S. Hennessy K. Kieff E. Rickinson A.B. J. Gen. Virol. 1987; 68: 1575-1586Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar) or the TRAF2(C-20) polyclonal antibody (Santa-Cruz) and ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Cell nuclei isolated by resuspending cells in a solution containing 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 1.5 mm magnesium chloride, 10 mm potassium chloride, 0.5 mm DTT, and protease inhibitors were subjected to lysis in a buffer constituting 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 25% glycerol, 1.5 mmmagnesium chloride, 0.42 m sodium chloride, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm DTT, and protease inhibitors. The protein concentration of isolated nuclear extracts was determined by the Bio-Rad protein assay, according to the manufacturer's instructions. For EMSAs, a 29-bp HIV-κB probe (5′-GATCAGGGACTTTCCGCTGGGGACTTTCC-3′), a 22-bp collagenase TRE probe (5′-AGCTTGATGAGTCAGCCGGATC-3′), a 24-bp Jun2 TRE probe (5′-AGCTAGCATTACCTCATCCCGATC-3′), and a 24-bp IL-8 probe containing the AP-1 consensus (5′-GAAGTGTGATGACTCAGGTTTGCC-3′) were made by annealing complementary synthetic oligonucleotides and end labeling using [32P]ATP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and T4 polynucleotide kinase (Boehringer Mannheim) followed by spin-column purification. Binding reactions containing 10 μg of nuclear protein extract, 1 μg of poly(dI-dC) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), 0.1 ng of probe labeled to a specific activity of 2 × 108cpm/μg, and binding buffer (4% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm DTT, 0.01 m Tris·HCl, pH 7.5, and 5 mm KCl) in a volume of 20 μl were incubated for 30 min at room temperature and then resolved by electrophoresis through a 5% polyacrylamide gel in a 0.55 × TBE buffer. Gels were then dried and exposed to x-ray film for autoradiography (Kodak). In supershift experiments, nuclear extracts were preincubated for 45 min with antibodies directed against c-Fos (Santa Cruz, sc-052X) or c-Jun (Santa Cruz, sc-045X) and then for a further 30 min with radiolabeled probe before being subjected to EMSA as described above. For ATF2 depletion experiments, 10-μg nuclear extracts were incubated with 1 μg of anti-ATF2 or control c-Rel antibody (Santa Cruz, sc-242X or sc-272X, respectively) for 2 h on ice. Depletion was achieved by the addition of anti-rabbit IgG-coated agarose beads during the last 60 min of the incubation. After a brief centrifugation at 12,000 ×g, the extracts were subjected to EMSA as above. For EMSAs using recombinant ATF2, 0.5 μg of full-length ATF2 protein (Santa Cruz, sc-4007) was incubated for 30 min with collagenase TRE, Jun2 TRE, or IL-8/AP-1 probe in the presence of poly(dI-dC) and binding buffer as described above and was then analyzed on a 5% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. cDNA synthesis from total RNA and semiquantitative reverse transcription PCR were performed as described previously (12Eliopoulos A.G. Stack M. Dawson C.W. Kaye K.M. Hodgkin L. Sihota S. Rowe M. Young L.S. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 2899-2916Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). A 208-bp IL-8 cDNA fragment was generated using the primers 5′-CAGTTTTGCCAAGGAGTGCTA-3′ (IL8-Forward) and 5′-AACTTCTCCACAACCCTCTGC-3′ (IL8-Reverse) under the following conditions: denaturation at 94 °C for 45 s, annealing at 52 °C for 45 s, and extension at 72 °C for 50 s for 24 cycles followed by a final extension step at 72 °C for 50 min. PCR products were analyzed on a 1.5% agarose gel, transferred on Hybond N+, and hybridized with the oligonucleotide probe 5′-TGATTGAGAGTGGACCACA-3′ (IL8-Probe). Primers and amplification for GAPDH have been described previously. IL-8 versus GAPDH hybridization signals were quantified on a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager. The presence of IL-6 or IL-8 protein in the supernatants of cultured cells was determined by ELISAs (Pelikine human IL-6 or IL-8 ELISA, CLB, Netherlands) as described (12Eliopoulos A.G. Stack M. Dawson C.W. Kaye K.M. Hodgkin L. Sihota S. Rowe M. Young L.S. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 2899-2916Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). 12 h after transfection, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and plated on a 24-well plate at a density of 40,000 cells/ml in 1 ml of complete medium in the presence or absence of inhibitors. Supernatants were analyzed 24 h later. Alternatively, 40,000 293EcR-LMP1 cells were pretreated for 1 h with 20 μm SB203580 and then induced to express LMP1 by treatment with 10 μm ponasterone A; supernatants were analyzed 24 h later. To determine the effects of LMP1 on the p38 MAPK pathway, an ecdysone-inducible system was used to provide regulatable expression of LMP1. This system is based on the binding of the steroid hormone ecdysone analog ponasterone A to a heterodimeric receptor comprising a modified ecdysone receptor and the retinoid X receptor (RXR) which allows the subsequent activation of an ecdysone-responsive promoter to express the target gene (37No D. Yao T.-P. Evans R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 3346-3351Crossref PubMed Scopus (755) Google Scholar). HEK 293 cells carrying the pVgRXR plasmid (293EcR), which encodes the receptor subunits, were transfected with pIND-LMP1, which contains the LMP1 coding sequences under the control of ecdysone-response elements. Selected stable clones (293EcR-LMP1) were then examined for ponasterone A-inducible gene expression. Results from a representative clone (293EcR-LMP1/cl.4) are shown in Fig.1 A. Induction of LMP1 after the addition of 10 μm ponasterone A was observed as early as 6 h and increased further at 12 h to remain stable for up to 24 h of treatment. The levels of LMP1 achieved after treatment with ponasterone A were comparable to those expressed in X50-7, an EBV-transformed B cell line (Fig. 1 A, X50-7 lane). Control cultures, stably transfected with empty pIND vector, showed no LMP1 expression (Fig. 1A). Cell lysates were also analyzed for p38 phosphorylation by immunoblot using an antibody that specifically recognizes the phosphorylated form of the protein (34De Cesaris P. Starace D. Riccioli A. Padula F. Filippini A. Ziparo E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7566-7571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar,38Schwenger P. Alpert D. Skolnik E.Y. Vilcek J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 78-84Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These experiments demonstrated a transient increase in endogenous p38 phosphorylation levels in parallel with the induction of LMP1 expression (Fig. 1 B), and similar results were obtained with an additional 293EcR-LMP1 clone (293EcR-LMP1/cl.5, data not shown). The levels of p38 phosphorylation in vector control-transfected cultures remained unaffected (Fig. 1 B). To demonstrate that the observed LMP1-mediated p38 phosphorylation is functional, the ability of immunoprecipitated p38 to activate ATF2 was examined. The transcription factor ATF2 is a known substrate for p38 MAPK, being phosphorylated primarily on threonine residues 69 and 71, and this event increases its transactivating properties. HEK 293EcR-LMP1/cl.4 or control cells were transiently transfected with HA-tagged p38 expression vector and 24 h later were stimulated with 10 μm ponasterone A for various time intervals (0, 3, 6, 12, or 24 h). Lysates from these cultures were isolated, immunoprecipitated with an HA-specific antibody, and assayed for kinase activity using GST-ATF2(19–96) fusion protein as substrate. ATF2 phosphorylation was then determined by immunoblot analysis using an antibody specific for the phosphorylated form of ATF2. As shown in Fig.1 C, no increase in p38 kinase activity was observed after a 3-h exposure to ponasterone A, in agreement with the lack of induction of LMP1 expression and p38 phosphorylation at this time point. A significant increase in ATF2 phosphorylation levels was, however, noted at 6 h and peaked at 12 h of treatment, in parallel with p38 phosphorylation. A small decrease in p38 kinase activity was then observed at 24 h of stimulation (Fig. 1 C, upper panel). As a control for this experiment, HA-p38-transfected 293EcR-LMP1/cl.4 cells treated for 10 min with 20 mm sodium salicylate, which has been shown to induce p38 activation (38Schwenger P. Alpert D. Skolnik E.Y. Vilcek J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 78-84Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), were used (Fig. 1 C, first lane). Immunoblot analysis of HA immunoprecipitates using an anti-ATF2 control antibody verified that comparable amounts of HA-p38 were analyzed (Fig. 1 C,lower panel). In similar immune complex kinase assays, the anti-HA immunoprecipitate failed to phosphorylate GST substrate (data not shown). Thus, inducible LMP1 expression triggers the phosphorylation of p38 and ATF2. Activation of the p38 MAPK pathway was also observed after transient expression of LMP1. HeLa cervical carcinoma cells were transfected with increasing doses (1 or 2.5 μg) of pSG5-LMP1, an SV40 early promoter-driven LMP1 expression vector, in the presence of 0.5 μg of HA-p38, and kinase activity was determined 36 h later by immune complex kinase assays using GST-ATF2(19–96) as substrate. These experiments demonstrated that increasing levels of LMP1 expression correlated with increased p38 kinase activity (Fig.2, A and B), and similar results were obtained in HEK 293 cells (see Fig.4 C).Figure 4Both CTAR1 and CTAR2 domains of LMP1 contribute to p38 MAPK activation.

https://openalex.org/W2018448892,"Frizzled related proteins (FRPs) comprise a family of secreted molecules that contain an N-terminal cysteine-rich domain (CRD) highly similar to the CRDs of the frizzled family of membrane-anchored Wnt receptors. FRPs have been shown to interact with Wnt proteins and antagonize Wnt signaling in a Xenopusdevelopmental model. We demonstrated that FRP antagonizes the Wnt-induced increase in uncomplexed β-catenin in both transient cotransfection and stable transformation models, where Wnt-induced morphological alterations are inhibited as well. We showed further that FRP inhibits Wnt signaling in a paracrine mode using a T-cell factor luciferase reporter to measure Wnt function. Investigation of the mechanisms responsible for FRP inhibition revealed that FRP forms complexes with WNT-1 or WNT-2 through its CRD domain. Transfection analysis with FRPs containing different tags revealed that FRP itself forms complexes and that this ability is conferred by its CRD domain. Finally, we demonstrated by cotransfection that FRP forms complexes with a prototype frizzled. All of these findings are consistent with a model by which FRP inhibits Wnt signaling through interactions with Wnt and/or formation of nonfunctional complexes with the frizzled receptor.

The Wnt proteins comprise a highly conserved, multimember ligand family, which play important roles in patterning and cell fate determination (1Nusse R. Varmus H.E.

A number of downstream components of Wnt signaling have been identified by a combination of genetic and biochemical approaches. Wnts act through the cytoplasmic protein Dishevelled to inhibit the activity of the serine-threonine kinase GSK3. GSK3 appears to bind through a bridging molecule, Axin, to the β-catenin-APC 1The abbreviations used are: APC, adenomatous polyposis coli protein; CRD, cysteine-rich domain; fz, frizzled; FRP, frizzled related protein; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; RLU, relative luciferase units; GST, glutathione S-transferase; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PDGF, platelet-derived growth factor; TCF, T-cell factor; LEF, lymphoid enhancer factor. complex and phosphorylate β-catenin causing its rapid degradation. Wnt-induced inhibition of GSK3 leads to β-catenin stabilization resulting in an increased level of the uncomplexed soluble form (3Gumbiner B.M. Curr. Opin.

The latter form can interact with TCF/LEF transcription factors and, after translocation to the nucleus, activate target genes (6Behrens J. von Kries J.P. Kuhl M. Bruhn L. Wedlich D. Grosschedl R. Birchmeier W. Nature. 1996; 382: 638-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (2605) Google Scholar). There is evidence that activation of Wnt signaling can contribute to the neoplastic process (7Huguet E.L.

Finally, genetic alterations affecting APC or β-catenin, associated with increased uncomplexed β-catenin levels, have been observed in human colon cancers (14Morin P.J. Sparks A.B. Korinek V. Barker N. Clevers H. Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W. Science. 1997; 275: 1787-1790Crossref PubMed Scopus (3517) Google Scholar), melanomas (15Rubinfeld B. Robbins P. El-Gamil M. Albert I. Porfiri E.

A. 1998; 95: 8847-8851Crossref PubMed Scopus (986) Google Scholar), indicating that aberrations of Wnt signaling pathways are critical to the development of these and possibly other human cancers. Recent studies have identified the products of the multi-member frizzled family as Wnt receptors (17Bhanot P. Brink M. Harryman Samos C. Hsieh J.C. Wang Y. Macke J.P. Andrew D. Nathans J. Nusse R. Nature. 1996; 382: 225-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (1235) Google Scholar). These proteins are characterized by a large cysteine-rich extracellular domain (CRD), a seven-transmembrane spanning domain, and a cytoplasmic tail. Exogenous expression ofDrosophila frizzled 2 (Dfz2) in a suitable recipient insect cell line conferred to theDrosophila Wnt prototype, Wingless (Wg), the ability to bind to the cell surface and to signal by increasing intracellular levels of β-catenin. Furthermore, transfection of Dfz2 or several different mammalian fz cDNAs into human 293T cells conferred the ability to bind Wg. The fz CRD has been shown to be its Wnt binding domain by the ability of Wg to bind to a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored Dfz CRD in the absence of the transmembrane portion (17Bhanot P.

More evidence implicating fz as the Wnt receptor has come from experiments performed in the Xenopusembryo system in which Wnt induced axis duplication when coinjected with members of the fz family (18He X. Saint-Jeannet J.P. Wang Y. Nathans J. Dawid I. Varmus H. Science. 1997; 275: 1652-1654Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). A family of related molecules, which contain N-terminal CRDs highly similar to the fz CRD but then diverge and lack any transmembrane domain, has recently been identified. When coexpressed with Wnt family members in Xenopus embryos, such proteins including human frizzled related protein (FRP) and Frzb-1 were shown to antagonize Wnt-induced duplication of the dorsal axis (19Leyns L.

Frzb-1 has been further shown to coimmunoprecipitate with Wnt proteins in vitro and after cotransfection of COS7 cells (20Wang S. Krinks M. Lin K. Luyten F.P. Moos Jr., M. Cell. 1997; 88: 757-766Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). Moreover soluble Frzb-1 was shown to bind to 293 cells expressing a WNT-1 transmembrane chimera (19Leyns L. Bouwmeester T. Kim S.H. Piccolo S. De Robertis E.M. Cell. 1997; 88: 747-756Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar). In addition, mouse members of this family expressed as glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored fusion proteins conferred to Wg the ability to bind 293 cells (22Rattner A. Hsieh J.C. Smallwood P.M.

The present studies were undertaken to investigate the mechanisms by which FRP antagonizes Wnt function. The results have implications with respect to how FRP modulates the complex functions of the Wnt multimember family of developmentally regulated signaling molecules. pCEV/WNT-1-HFc and pCEV/WNT-2-HFc, in which the IgGHFc open reading frame (24La Rochelle W.J.

Yaniv A. Aaronson S.A. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 2819-2825Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The pcDNA/WNT-2-HFc was constructed by inserting WNT-2-HFc into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). pBabe/WNT-2-HFc containing the puromycin resistance gene was constructed by inserting the WNT-2-HFcfragment into pBabe, under the control of the cytomegalovirus transcriptional unit. pLNCX/Wnt-1-HA was kindly provided by Dr. J. Kitajewski (Columbia University, New York). In pMMT/FRP, the FRP coding region was introduced into MMTneo (24La Rochelle W.J. Dirsch O.R. Finch P.W. Cheon H.G. May M. Marchese C. Pierce J.H. Aaronson S.A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 357-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). To construct pcDNA/FRP-HA or pcDNA/FRP-FLAG, the FRP coding region lacking its stop codon (21Finch P.W. He X. Kelley M.J. Uren A. Schaudies R.P. Popescu N.C. Rudikoff S. Aaronson S.A. Varmus H.E. Rubin J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Gazit A. Wu-Morgan S.S. Yaniv A. Aaronson S.A. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 2819-2825Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), in the presence of a forward BamHI-flanked primer, GGAAGGATCCGCCGGCATGGGCATCGGGCGCA, that included a Kozak consensus sequence and a reverse EcoRI-flanked primer, GGCCGAATTCCTTAAACACGGACTGAAAGGTGGG. The FRP PCR product was inserted in frame into pcDNA3, upstream of anEcoRI-flanked HA (YPYDVPDYA) or M2 (DYKDDDDK) (Eastman Kodak Co.) epitope-encoding sequence. To construct pcDNA/CRD-FRP-HA or pcDNA/CRD-FRP-FLAG, the N-terminal fragment of FRP was PCR-amplified using the above mentioned forward BamHI-flanked primer and a reverseEcoRI-flanked primer, GGAAGAATTCGGCGATGCAGACGTCCCCCTCCGG, and the PCR product was introduced in frame upstream of the HA- or M2-encoding sequence, as detailed above. To construct pcDNA/CRD-Hfz6-FLAG, the N-terminal domain ofHfz6 (GenBankTM accession number AF072873) was PCR-amplified using the forward HindIII-flanked primer, GGAAAAGCTTGCCACCATGGAGATGTTTACATTTTTGTTG, that included a Kozak consensus sequence and a reverse EcoRI-tagged primer, GGAAGAATTCGCATGGAGGCGCACACTGGTCAAT. The PCR product was introduced in frame upstream of M2-encoding sequence as detailed above. Sequence analysis was performed to ascertain the authenticity of the PCR-generated products. pGST-E-cadherin was described previously (12Bafico A. Gazit A. Wu-Morgan S.S. Yaniv A. Aaronson S.A. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 2819-2825Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Two TCF/Luc reporter constructs, pGL3-OT containing TCF-responsive domains and pGL3-OF containing mutant-binding sites, were kindly provided by B. Vogelstein (Johns Hopkins Oncology Center, Baltimore). A schematic diagram of the constructs generated for this study is shown in Fig. 1. NIH3T3 cells were plated at 1.5 × 105 cells per 100-mm dish. After 24 h cells were transfected with 1 μg of each plasmid DNA, by the calcium phosphate coprecipitation method (25Wigler M. Silverstein S. Lee L.S. Pellicer A. Cheng Y.C. Axel R. Cell. 1977; 11: 223-232Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (845) Google Scholar) as described (26Chan A.M. Miki T. Meyers K.A. Aaronson S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7558-7562Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Cultures were incubated with the DNA precipitates for 18–20 h and then washed in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.). To ensure selection of cells coexpressing WNT-2 and FRP, different selectable markers were utilized in each construct. Cotransfectants were doubly selected by addition of 750 μg/ml geneticin (Life Technologies, Inc.) and 2 μg/ml puromycin (Calbiochem) to the medium. Cells expressing WNT-2 orFRP individually were cotransfected with control vectors containing the other selectable marker. For transient transfection 70–80% confluent cultures of 293T cells were transfected by the calcium phosphate method using 3 μg of each plasmid DNA. When necessary the amounts of DNAs used for cotransfection were adjusted to yield similar levels of protein expression. Cells were exposed for 5–6 h to the DNA precipitates and then washed in growth medium. After 48 h, cells were harvested and cell lysates prepared for analysis as indicated below. GST-E-cadherin was expressed in bacteria and purified from the bacterial lysates by binding to glutathione-Sepharose beads as described previously (12Bafico A. Gazit A. Wu-Morgan S.S. Yaniv A. Aaronson S.A. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 2819-2825Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Cells were lysed in immunoprecipitation buffer (10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7, 0.15 m NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 mm sodium vanadate, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and cell extracts were clarified by centrifugation. In order to perform a quantitative analysis, two different amounts of total protein (0.1 and 1 mg) were analyzed for each sample by incubation with Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) bound to the GST-E-cadherin. After 1 h of incubation with rotation at 4 °C, the beads were collected by centrifugation, washed, and dissolved in Laemmli buffer. Samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting with 0.5 μg/ml anti-β-catenin antibody (Transduction Laboratories). Detection was per- performed with 125I-labeled protein A (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The paracrine assay was performed as described. 2A. Gazit, A. Yaniv, A. Bafico, T. Pramila, M. Igarashi, J. Kitajewski, and S. A. Aaronson, manuscript in preparation. Briefly, 293T cells transiently transfected with 1 μg of pLNC/Wnt-1-HA or with an empty vector were cocultured with 293T cells transiently transfected with 1 μg of pcDNA/FRP-HA, pGL3-OT, or pGL3-OF and 0.1 μg of β-galactosidase expression vector. After 48 h, the relative luciferase units (RLU) were measured using the Promega luciferase assay system according to the manufacturer's protocol. The activities were normalized for transfection efficiency using β-galactosidase activity. TCF/LEF-dependent luciferase activity was calculated by subtracting RLU levels obtained with the pGL3-OF reporter from those obtained by pGL3-OT (27Korinek V. Barker N. Morin P.J. van Wichen D. de Heger R. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Clevers H. Science. 1997; 275: 1784-1787Crossref PubMed Scopus (2950) Google Scholar). Cultures were solubilized in lysing buffer (0.01 m phosphate buffer, 1% Triton, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 0.1 m NaCl, 5 μm EGTA, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 mm sodium vanadate, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Around 100 μg of total cell lysates were resolved by SDS-PAGE, and proteins were transferred to Immobilon-P membranes. After blocking with 5% bovine serum albumin in PBS, filters were incubated with the specific primary antibody (2.6 μg/ml horseradish peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse HFc, Dako; 10 μg/ml anti-FLAG M2, Kodak; 1.5 μg/ml anti-HA obtained from the Hybridoma Center, Mount Sinai School of Medicine, New York). When the anti-FLAG or the anti-HA primary antibodies were used, membranes were washed in PBS/Tween 20 and incubated for 1 h with a secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse antibody. After washing 6 times in PBS/Tween 20, membranes were subjected to ECL analysis (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For coimmunoprecipitation analysis, cells were solubilized in lysing buffer (see above), and extracts were clarified by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. Around 1.5–3 mg of total cell lysates were incubated with the specific antibody (24 μg of goat anti-mouse HFc, Pierce; 10 μg of anti-FLAG M2; 15 μg of anti-HA) for 1 h on ice and then incubated with rotation with protein A beads (Pierce) for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were collected by centrifugation, washed three times in immunoprecipitation buffer, dissolved in Laemmli buffer, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE, followed by detection with each specific antibody. The extracellular matrix fraction was prepared as follows. Cultures were washed twice with PBS containing 1 mg/ml aminocaproic acid and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and then incubated with the same solution containing 5 mm EGTA for 15 min at 37 °C. Cells were removed, and the plates were washed 2–3 times with the PBS solution and twice with distilled H2O. The extracellular matrix was then solubilized in 200 μl of Laemmli buffer. Subconfluent 293T cultures were transiently transfected with 3 μg of each plasmid DNA. Forty hours later, cells were washed and incubated for 30 min in methionine- or methionine- and cysteine-free DMEM in the absence of serum. Cells were then labeled for 3 h with 3.5 ml of the same medium containing 200 μCi of [35S]methionine (∼1,175 Ci/mmol, NEN Life Science Products) or 200 μCi of [35S]methionine and 200 μCi of [35S]cysteine (∼1,075 Ci/mmol, NEN Life Science Products). Labeled cells were rinsed with cold PBS, lysed in 0.5 ml of lysing buffer, and clarified by centrifugation. Cell extracts were incubated with 24 μg of goat anti-mouse HFc (Pierce), 15 μg of anti-HA, 10 μg of anti-PDGF, or 10 μg of anti-FLAG. Immunoprecipitates were recovered with protein A (Pierce) beads, dissolved in Laemmli buffer, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. After electrophoresis, the gels were treated with En3hance (DuPont), dried, and autoradiographed. Studies to date showing that FRPs antagonize Wnt action have generally utilized in vivo models, with the exception of one recent report in which cotransfection of 293 cells withFrzb-1 and WNT-1 resulted in the inhibition of Wnt-induced accumulation of cytosolic β-catenin (23Lin K. Wang S. Julius M.A. Kitajewski J. Moos Jr., M. Luyten F.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11196-11200Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). To confirm and extend these findings with respect to FRP, we cotransfected 293T cells with WNT-1 and FRP. This transient expression system has the advantage of inducing high levels of protein expression. However, we observed that cotransfection led to variable levels of expression of the exogenous proteins. To overcome this difficulty,WNT-1-HFc (12Bafico A. Gazit A. Wu-Morgan S.S. Yaniv A. Aaronson S.A. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 2819-2825Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) was cotransfected with the vector control or HA-tagged FRP (Fig. 1) at different DNA ratios in order to ensure that similar WNT-1 protein levels could be obtained in the presence or absence of FRP expression. Under conditions in which 293T cells transfected with WNT-1, in the presence or absence of FRP, expressed similar WNT-1 levels (Fig.2 A), FRP was also specifically detected as a 36-kDa species in WNT-1/FRP-cotransfected cells (Fig. 2 B). Total and uncomplexed β-catenin levels (12Bafico A. Gazit A. Wu-Morgan S.S. Yaniv A. Aaronson S.A. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 2819-2825Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) were quantitated in the same cells using a GST-E-cadherin binding assay as described under “Materials and Methods.” Although total β-catenin levels were not appreciably altered (data not shown), Fig.2 C shows that WNT-1 induced an increase of around 10-fold in the amount of uncomplexed β-catenin over that of the vector control. Of note, expression of FRP dramatically inhibited this increase (Fig.2 C). Similar results were obtained with WNT-2 (data not shown). These findings established, under carefully controlled conditions, that FRP acts to inhibit Wnt signaling functions responsible for increased free β-catenin levels. We next investigated the ability of FRP to inhibit Wnt functions in a stable transformation model. To do so, WNT-2 andFRP genes were cotransfected using different selectable markers into NIH3T3 cells, in which both WNT-1 and-2 induce morphologic alterations that include increased saturation density as well as higher steady state levels of uncomplexed β-catenin (12Bafico A. Gazit A. Wu-Morgan S.S. Yaniv A. Aaronson S.A. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 2819-2825Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Whereas WNT-2 transfectants exhibited abnormal growth and achieved higher cell density, double marker selected cultures expressing both FRP and WNT-2showed little if any morphological differences from vector control or FRP transfectants (Fig. 3 A). Similar results were obtained in multiple experiments. Moreover, inhibition of the transformed phenotype by FRP was correlated with inhibition of Wnt function as indicated by the substantially lower levels of WNT-2-induced free β-catenin in the stable cotranfectants (Fig. 3 B). Both Wnt and FRP proteins are processed through the secretory pathway but remain associated with cells that have been analyzed to date (21Finch P.W. He X. Kelley M.J. Uren A. Schaudies R.P. Popescu N.C. Rudikoff S. Aaronson S.A. Varmus H.E. Rubin J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6770-6775Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar,28Papkoff J. Schryver B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 2723-2730Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 29Reichsman F. Smith L. Cumberledge S. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 819-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). The sites of interactions and mechanisms by which FRP exerts its inhibitory functions on Wnt signaling remain to be elucidated. To address this question, we first analyzed the localization of FRP in transfected 293T cells. As shown in Fig.4, FRP was found to be present in cell lysates and the extracellular matrix but was not detected in the medium using conditions known to optimize FRP release into the medium of cultured fibroblasts (21Finch P.W. He X. Kelley M.J. Uren A. Schaudies R.P. Popescu N.C. Rudikoff S. Aaronson S.A. Varmus H.E. Rubin J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6770-6775Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). When the results were normalized for the amount of cell lysate, culture fluid, or extracellular matrix in the same Petri dish, FRP was found to be predominantly cell-associated (90%) with the remainder present in the extracellular matrix (Fig. 4). These results indicate that FRP remains tightly cell-associated when expressed by 293T cells. Experiments were next performed to analyze the ability of FRP to inhibit Wnt actions in a paracrine mode. To do so we utilized a recently developed transient assay involving a luciferase reporter for TCF transcriptional activation (27Korinek V. Barker N. Morin P.J. van Wichen D. de Heger R. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Clevers H. Science. 1997; 275: 1784-1787Crossref PubMed Scopus (2950) Google Scholar) as an indirect marker of Wnt-1 function. 293T cells have previously been shown to respond to autocrine Wnt-1 by stimulating TCF-dependent transcription (13Young C.S. Kitamura M. Hardy S. Kitajewski J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2474-2485Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We established a cocultivation assay in which cells transiently transfected with Wnt-1 are able to stimulate the activation of the TCF reporter in target cells in a paracrine mode.2293T cells were transfected with Wnt-1 or vector control and then cocultivated with 293T cells, which were cotransfected with the TCF reporter and either the vector control or FRP. As shown in Fig. 5, TCF reporter activity was increased over 20-fold in 293T cells in response to cocultivation withWnt-1-expressing cells. However, the responsiveness of FRP expressing 293T cells to paracrine-acting Wnt-1 was not significantly different from those expressing vector alone. These results indicate that Wnt-1 function can be inhibited by FRP in a paracrine mode. Previous studies have shown that Frzb-1 coimmunoprecipitates several members of the Wnt family (20Wang S. Krinks M. Lin K. Luyten F.P. Moos Jr., M. Cell. 1997; 88: 757-766Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar, 23Lin K. Wang S. Julius M.A. Kitajewski J. Moos Jr., M. Luyten F.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11196-11200Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). To confirm and extend these findings with respect to FRP, we performed immunoprecipitation experiments with lysates of 293T cells cotransfected with WNT-1-HFc or WNT-2-HFc in combination with either FLAG-tagged FRP or FLAG-tagged C-terminally truncated FRP encoding only its CRD (Fig. 1). Antiserum against the HFc tag was used for immunoprecipitation followed by immunoblotting with anti-FLAG to detect FRP or CRD-FRP. As shown in Fig. 6 A, FRP and CRD-FRP could be immunoprecipitated in complexes with either WNT-1 or -2. The specificity of these interactions was demonstrated by the fact that anti-HFc failed to immunoprecipitate FRP or CRD-FRP in the absence of Wnt-1 coexpression and by the fact that Wnt with a different tag, HA, was similarly able to immunoprecipitate FRP-FLAG (data not shown). To investigate further the nature of Wnt-FRP interactions as well as to examine the stoichiometry of the complex, we performed biosynthetic experiments. Thus, 293T cells were transfected withWNT-2-HFc in the presence or absence of FRP. Around 40 h later cultures were labeled for 3 h with [35S]methionine followed by immunoprecipitation analysis of cell lysates with anti-HFc. Fig. 6 B shows that anti-HFc specifically immunoprecipitated the radiolabeled 66-kDa WNT-2-HFc from lysates of WNT-2-transfected 293T cells. In contrast, both WNT-2-HFc and a 36-kDa species corresponding to FRP were coimmunoprecipitated from cotransfected cultures. No other major bands were observed, arguing against the possibility that other protein(s) participated in FRP-WNT-2 binding interactions. Of note, the intensity of the band corresponding to FRP was significantly greater than the signal associated with WNT-2-HFc in these complexes (Fig.6 B). Similar results were obtained in several independent experiments. The ratio between the intensity of the FRP and the WNT bands was around 1.7 as calculated by densitometry. As a similar number of methionines are present in both proteins, these results raised the possibility that Wnt-2 might be present in a complex containing more than one FRP molecule. In order to establish the specificity of the Wnt-FRP interactions, we performed biosynthetic experiments using PDGFB as a control for binding interactions. PDGFB, like Wnt, contains multiple cysteine residues and is also processed through the secretory pathway (30Robbins K.C. Antoniades H.N. Devare S.G. Hunkapiller M.W. Aaronson S.A.

We have cloned cDNAs encoding mouse KCC3, human KCC3, and human KCC4, three new members of this gene family. The KCC3 and KCC4 cDNAs predict proteins of 1083 and 1150 amino acids, respectively. The KCC3 and KCC4 proteins are 65–71% identical to the previously characterized transporters KCC1 and KCC2, with which they share a predicted membrane topology. The four KCC proteins differ at amino acid residues within key transmembrane domains and in the distribution of putative phosphorylation sites within the amino- and carboxyl-terminal cytoplasmic domains.

Gibson J.S. J. Exp. Biol. 1997; 200: 343-352PubMed Google Scholar). A major impediment to the study of K+-Cl−cotransport has been the lack of specific high affinity inhibitors. Convincing evidence for K+-Cl− cotransport has nonetheless been reported for a number of tissues, including epithelia (5Avison M.J. Gullans S.R. Ogino T. Giebisch G. J. Membr.

In addition to cell volume regulation, non-erythroid K+-Cl− cotransport has been implicated in trans-epithelial salt absorption (5Avison M.J. Gullans S.R. Ogino T. Giebisch G. J. Membr.

Both proteins are homologous to the other electroneutral cation-chloride cotransporters, the bumetanide-sensitive Na+-K+-2Cl− cotransporters BSC1 and BSC2 (also known as NKCC2 and NKCC1, respectively), and the thiazide-sensitive Na+-Cl− cotransporter TSC (also known as NCC) (18Mount D.B.

Heterologous expression of KCC1 in HEK-293 cells results in Cl−-dependent, furosemide-sensitive uptake of 86Rb+ that is activated by cell swelling (3Gillen C.M. Brill S. Payne J.A. Forbush III, B. J.

KCC1 transcript is abundant in both mouse and human erythroleukemia cell lines, indicating that KCC1 is the major erythroid K+-Cl− cotransporter (17Pellegrino C.M. Rybicki A.C. Musto S. Nagel R.L. Schwartz R.S. Blood Cells Mol. Dis. 1998; 24: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The widespread expression of KCC1 also suggests a significant role in non-erythroid K+-Cl− cotransport (3Gillen C.M. Brill S. Payne J.A. Forbush III, B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16237-16244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar, 16Holtzman E.J. Kumar S. Faaland C.A. Warner F. Logue P.J. Erickson S.J. Ricken G. Waldman J.

In contrast to KCC1, the expression of KCC2 is restricted to neurons within the central nervous system (15Payne J.A. Stevenson T.J. Donaldson L.F. J. Biol.

Physiol. 1997; 272: C173-C183Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), KCC2 plays an important role in the regulation of the transmembrane chloride gradient and thus affects the neuronal response to stimuli such as γ-aminobutyric acid (14Rivera C. Voipio J. Payne J.A. Ruusuvuori E. Lahtinen H. Lamsa K. Pirvola U. Saarma M. Kaila K. Nature. 1999; 397: 251-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (1686) Google Scholar,23Lu J. Karadsheh M. Delpire E. J. Neurobiol. 1999; (in press)Google Scholar). An increasing amount of data suggest further heterogeneity in the proteins that mediate K+-Cl− cotransport. At the functional level, KCC1 and KCC2 differ in K+ affinities (3Gillen C.M. Brill S. Payne J.A. Forbush III, B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16237-16244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar, 4Payne J.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: C1516-C1525Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (K m > 25 and 5.2 mm, respectively), and a dramatically higher K+ affinity (K m 0.9 mm) has also been reported for insulin-stimulated K+-Cl− cotransport in a mouse muscle cell line (9Weil-Maslansky E. Gutman Y. Sasson S. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: C932-C939Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Erythroid K+-Cl−cotransport is heterogeneous with respect to inhibition by the K+-channel blocker quinidine, with a significant quinidine-insensitive fraction of Cl−-dependent K+ flux (24Adragna N.C. Lauf P.K. J. Membr. Biol. 1994; 142: 195-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). At the molecular level, cDNA probes that include human KCC1 coding sequences detect a number of transcripts, indicative of either alternative splicing or the expression of closely related gene products. Thus, a rat 3′-UTR probe detects transcripts of 3.8 and 4.4 kb in size (3Gillen C.M. Brill S. Payne J.A. Forbush III, B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16237-16244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar), and hKCC1 probes from within the open reading frame also detect transcripts of 5.5 (20Liapis H. Nag M. Kaji D.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: C1432-C1437Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Larsen F. Solheim J. Kristensen T. Kolsto A.B. Prydz H. Hum. Mol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 16237-16244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar) in various human tissues and cell lines. Using the mouse and human EST data bases as a starting point, we have cloned cDNAs corresponding to two of these new KCC isoforms, denoted KCC3 and KCC4. Functional expression inXenopus laevis oocytes confirms that mouse KCC3 is a furosemide-sensitive K+-Cl− cotransporter, with much greater volume sensitivity than rabbit KCC1. Although highly homologous, KCCs 1–4 differ in potentially important transmembrane (TM) segments and in the distribution of putative cytoplasmic phosphorylation sites. Northern blot analysis with specific 3′-UTR probes indicates that the KCCs have distinct but overlapping expression patterns. The identification of all four KCCs thus reveals significant differences in structure, function, and expression. A BLAST (basic alignment and search tool) search (26Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (59913) Google Scholar) of the EST data base revealed a number of mouse ESTs that were homologous to rat KCC1 and KCC2. The cDNAs corresponding to four of these ESTs (IMAGE clones 568084, 633794, 313521, and 698105) were obtained from the IMAGE consortium (Research Genetics, Genome Systems and/or the ATCC) and sequenced. These ESTs contained partial open reading frames homologous to various segments of KCC1 and KCC2 (Fig.1). The 3′-end of the open reading frame and the entire 3′-UTR were identified in a fifth IMAGE cDNA (clone 1314678). The tissue distribution of mKCC3 was then assessed by RT-PCR, and widespread expression of mKCC3 was detected with the S1/AS1 primer pair (TableI), with particularly abundant transcripts in kidney and heart (data not shown). Using a primer pair (S2 and AS2 primers, Table I) spanning the gap between the IMAGE clones 313521 and 568084, a 1.2-kb fragment was amplified from C57BL/6J kidneys and subcloned into the EcoRV site of pBluescript by blunt-end ligation. PCR conditions for these and other gene-specific primers were optimized using Taq 2000 and the Opti-Prime buffer system (Stratagene). The following amplification protocol was followed, unless specified otherwise: 30 cycles of denaturation (92 °C, 2 min), annealing (54 °C, 1 min), and extension (72 °C, 1 min), followed by a final extension step (72 °C, 8 min). The extreme 5′-end of mKCC3 was cloned from BALB/c mouse kidney 5′-RACE template (CLONTECH), using two antisense primers (primers AS3 and AS4, Table I) and the AP1 adaptor primer fromCLONTECH (S3 primer). This PCR utilized AmpliTaq-Gold DNA polymerase (Perkin-Elmer) and a hot-start amplification protocol, consisting of a 9-min enzyme activation step at 94 °C, followed by 35 cycles of 94 °C for 1 min and 68 °C for 2.5 min, and a final 10-min extension at 72 °C.Table IOligonucleotide primers for PCRNameSequenceStartCloneS15′-GGAGGCAGATAATCCTTTCTCC-3′2472mKCC3S25′-GATCTTCCTGACCTACATCTCTCC-3′738mKCC3S35′-CCATCCTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGC-3′AP1 adaptorS45′-GACTCGTTTCCGCAAAACC-3′2498hKCC3S55′-GGAAGTAACATGGCACTTTTCG-3′200hKCC3S65′-AGCCATGCCCACGAACTTTACGG-3′69mKCC3S75′-AGTCAGAACTCCATCACAGGG-3′441hKCC4S85′-CTATCCTTGCCATCCTGACC-3′1723hKCC4S95′-CACACAGTTCAGCCTCTGAGC-3′4241hKCC4S105′-CTGAATGACCGTGCTTGACC-3′3624hKCC4S115′-CACGTCTGAGCAGTCAAAGGC-3′3858hKCC4AS15′-CACAGCAGTATGCATCCTCC-3′3135mKCC3AS25′-ACACTGCTCCGAGTCCAGG-3′2187mKCC3AS35′-ACCGCCATGAGTGCCAGGGCACAGCTGC-3′863mKCC3AS45′-TTCCCTAGAAGGCAGACCGGGATGTCAGGTG-3′1007mKCC3AS55′-AGAGTGCCGTGATGCTGTTGG-3′3280hKCC3AS65′-CAGGGCCATGAGCACGAGCGTG-3′796hKCC3AS75′-GAAATGGCGGTCACATTGTAC-3′513hKCC3AS85′-CCTCAGAAAATTGCTCCACATTGCTGG-3′2889hKCC4AS95′-GAAGGAGCCAATAACAATCACC-3′1895hKCC4AS105′-GCAGCAGTTGTCACTCGAAC-3′2821hKCC4AS115′-GCAACCTCTTTATGGACAACC-3′4618hKCC3AS125′-GCAGCCATGTTTCAAGTTAGTATCC-3′4185hKCC4 Open table in a new tab A human KCC EST clone (TIGR clone 150738) was obtained from the ATCC. Sequencing revealed that this cDNA is derived from the human ortholog of mKCC3. Another human 5′-EST (GenBankTM accession number F12342) exhibited strong amino acid homology with the extreme 3′ coding sequence of the other KCCs. This EST overlaps with a large number of ESTs from the 3′-UTR of hKCC3, including the IMAGE clones 22250 and 51311 (Fig. 1). The gap between these cDNAs and the TIGR clone 150738 (Fig. 1) was bridged by RT-PCR with the primer pair S4/AS5 (Table I), using a human kidney template (CLONTECH). The PCR products for this reaction were subcloned into pBluescript. Finally, the 5′-end of hKCC3 was cloned by sequential RT-PCR of human kidney with the primer pairs S5/AS6 and S6/AS7. S5 and S6 were derived from IMAGE clones 1403108 and mKCC3, respectively. Sequence analysis of another human EST cDNA (TIGR clone 150620) indicated the existence of a fourth KCC, hKCC4. Northern blot analysis revealed significant expression in muscle, and a single 5′-RACE cDNA was cloned from a human muscle template (CLONTECH) using the S3/AS8 primer pair. This 5′-RACE PCR used Advantage polymerase mix (CLONTECH) and a hot-start protocol consisting of the following: 94 °C for 1 min, followed by 35 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 62 °C for 30 s, and 68 °C for 3 min. Screening a random-primed human muscle cDNA library (CLONTECH) with a probe encompassing nucleotides 741–871 of hKCC4 yielded a single cDNA that extended 5′ of the start codon. Finally, two overlapping PCR fragments were amplified from human brain template (CLONTECH) with the S7/AS9 and S8/AS10 primer pairs (Table I), and subcloned into pCR2.1 by TA cloning (Invitrogen). All cDNA clones were sequenced on both strands using fluorescent dye terminator chemistry (Applied Biosystems). For cDNA sequence derived exclusively from PCR, at least two cDNAs from two separate PCR reactions were sequenced. Analyses of the nucleotide and amino acid sequences were performed using the GeneWorks 2.5 and MacVector 6.5 software packages (Oxford Molecular). Alignments and other analyses also made use of the computer programs BLAST (26Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (59913) Google Scholar), DNAStar, and SMART (simple modular architecture research tool) (27Schultz J. Milpetz F. Bork P. Ponting C.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5857-5864Crossref PubMed Scopus (3019) Google Scholar). Chromosomal assignments for the human KCC3 and KCC4 genes were made using a PCR-based screening approach with the National Institute of General Medical Sciences human/rodent somatic cell hybrid mapping panel 1 (28Drwinga H.L. Toji L.H. Kim C.H. Greene A.E. Mulivor R.A. Genomics. 1993; 16: 311-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). The primers used for hKCC3 mapping (S9 and AS11) amplify a 377-bp segment of the 3′ noncoding region from genomic DNA, and the hKCC4 mapping primers (S10 and AS12) amplify a 561-bp segment of the 3′ noncoding sequence. PCR reactions using DNA from the NIGMS panel were scored for the presence or absence of the appropriately sized product using agarose gel electrophoresis. The chromosomal localization of hKCC3 was verified by sequencing the chromosome 5 genomic clone pMS621, a gift of Dr. John Armour (see “Results”). Fine mapping of hKCC4 was performed by PCR using radiation hybrid analysis with the Stanford G3 panel (Research Genetics) and the S10/AS12 primer pair. Reaction products generated by PCR were alkali-denatured, applied to a nylon membrane using a dot-blot apparatus, and subjected to Southern blotting with a32P-labeled internal oligonucleotide probe (primer S11, Table I). Results were analyzed by querying the Stanford radiation hybrid map (http://www-shgc.stanford.edu/RH/). RNA was extracted from mouse tissues (C57BL/6J strain) using guanidine isothiocyanate and cesium chloride. Total RNA (10 μg/lane) was size-fractionated by electrophoresis (5% formaldehyde, 1% agarose), transferred to a nylon membrane (Stratagene), and probed sequentially with 32P-labeled randomly primed probes corresponding to full-length glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and nucleotides 4417–5062 of mKCC3 (3′-UTR). Human multiple-tissue Northern blots containing 2 μg/lane poly(A)+ RNA (CLONTECH) were hybridized to probes generated by PCR from the 3′-UTRs of hKCC3 (nucleotides 4598–4957) and hKCC4 (nucleotides 3624–4185) and to a human β-actin probe. Hybridization for all blots was performed overnight at 42 °C in 4× SSCP, 40% formamide, 4× Denhardt's solution, 0.5% SDS, and 200 μg of salmon sperm DNA, and membranes were washed twice for 10 min at room temperature in 2× SSCP, 0.1% SDS and twice for 1 h at 65 °C in 0.1× SSCP, 0.1% SDS. Exposure times varied as noted in the legends of Figs. 4 and 5.Figure 5A, Northern blot analysis of mKCC3 (48-h exposure). The transcript is abundant in kidney and heart and undetectable in brain. B, the same blot was stripped and reprobed with glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (12-h exposure).C, In vitro translation of mKCC3 protein.35S-labeled mKCC3 polypeptide was translated from cDNA by rabbit reticulocyte lysate, both with (+) and without (−) pancreatic microsomes, resolved by 7% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and visualized by autoradiography (12-h exposure).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) 1.0 μg of the full-length mKCC3 cDNA (see below) was translated in vitro using [35S]methionine and T7 RNA polymerase-coupled rabbit reticulocyte lysate (TNTTMT7, Promega), both with and without pancreatic microsomes, for 90 min at 30 °C. Protein was resolved by 7% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by autoradiography. For functional expression and in vitro translation, a full-length mKCC3 cDNA was assembled in the Xenopusexpression vector pGEMHE (29Liman E.R. Tytgat J. Hess P. Neuron. 1992; 9: 861-871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (979) Google Scholar). The resulting construct contains nucleotides 55–3812 of mKCC3. For functional comparison with mKCC3, a full-length rabKCC1 cDNA, the gift of Dr. Bliss Forbush III, was subcloned into pGEMHE. To prepare a template for cRNA, the rabbit KCC1 and mKCC3 cDNAs were linearized at the 3′-end usingNheI, and cRNA was transcribed in vitro using the T7 RNA polymerase and the mMESSAGE mMACHINE kit (Ambion). Defolliculated stage V–VI oocytes were injected with 50 nl of water or a solution containing cRNA at a concentration of 0.5 μg/μl (25 ng/oocyte). Oocytes were incubated at 17 °C in ND96 (96 mm Na+-Cl−, 2 mmK+-Cl−, 1.8 mmCa2+-Cl−, 1.0 mmMg2+-Cl−, and 5 mm Hepes/Tris, pH 7.4), supplemented with 2.5 mm sodium pyruvate and 5 mg/100 ml gentamicin, for 3 days. Functional expression of rabbit KCC1 and mKCC3 was assessed by measuring tracer 86Rb+ uptake in groups of 20–25 oocytes 3 days after water or cRNA injection. Because K+-Cl− cotransport is activated by cell swelling, both hypotonic and isotonic conditions were used.86Rb+ uptake was measured after a 30-min incubation period in either hypotonic or isotonic Na+-free and Cl−-free medium. Hypotonic medium (∼125 mosmol/kg) contained 48 mm N-methyl-d-glucamine gluconate, 2 mm K+ gluconate, 4.0 mm Ca2+ gluconate, 1.0 mmMg2+ gluconate, and 5 mm Hepes/Tris, pH 7.4. To generate the isotonic conditions (∼220 mosmol/kg) sucrose was added to a concentration of 100 mm. Ouabain was added to both solutions at a concentration of 1 mm. This incubation period was followed by a 60-min uptake period using Na+-free uptake medium, both hypotonic and isotonic. Hypotonic uptake medium (∼125 mosmol/kg) contained 48 mm N-methyl-d-glucamine-Cl−, 2 mm K+-Cl−, 1.8 mmCa2+-Cl−2, 1 mmMg2+-Cl−2, and 5 mmHepes/Tris, pH 7.4. The isotonic conditions (∼220 mosmol/kg) included 100 mm sucrose. Both uptake solutions contained 5.0 μCi/ml of 86Rb+ (New England Nuclear) and 1 mm ouabain. To determine the Cl−-dependent fraction of86Rb+ uptake, paired groups of oocytes were incubated in uptake medium without Cl− (substituted with gluconate). When indicated, 2 mm furosemide was added to both the incubation and uptake media. All uptakes were performed at 30 °C, after which oocytes were washed five times in ice-cold uptake solution without isotope to remove tracer activity in the extracellular fluid. After the oocytes were dissolved in 10% SDS, tracer activity was determined by β-scintillation counting. Full-length KCC3 and KCC4 sequences (deposited in the GenBankTM data base under accession numbers AF087436 (mKCC3), AF105365 (hKCC3), and AF105366 (hKCC4)) were determined from a number of overlapping cDNA clones (Fig.1). The complete mouse and human KCC3 cDNAs are 5132 and 5230 nucleotides long, respectively, which is close in size to the KCC3 transcripts seen on Northern blots (Figs.5 A and 6 A). Both cDNAs contain open reading frames of 3248 nucleotides, with 85% identity, and the predicted proteins consist of 1083 amino acids and exhibit 91% identity. The KCC3 3′-UTRs are only 34% identical, close to the lower limit of conservation between mouse and human orthologs (30Makalowski W. Boguski M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9407-9412Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). The hKCC4 cDNA sequence is 4237 nucleotides in length, with a 5′-UTR of 165 bp and a 3′-UTR of 622 bp. The discrepancy between the cDNA size and the size of the KCC4 transcripts (Fig.6 C), as well as the lack of a consensus polyadenylation site within the 3′-UTR, suggests that the 3′-UTR sequence is incomplete. There are three in-frame start codons between nucleotides 165 and 195 of the hKCC4 cDNA, at which translational initiation would result in proteins of 1150, 1141, or 1135 amino acids in length. However, homology to KCC1 and KCC3 begins before the third methionine (Fig.2), which is thus an unlikely translational start site. Comparison with the mouse KCC4 sequence 2D. B. Mount and E. Delpire, unpublished data. indicates significant conservation of the first nine codons, which also contain a PKC site (Fig. 2), and hence translation likely occurs at the first start codon. At least two KCC4 transcripts of 6–7 kb are detected by Northern blot analysis (Fig. 6 C), consistent with alternative splicing. In comparison with other KCC4 5′ cDNAs (Fig. 1), the single 5′-RACE cDNA contained a deletion of nucleotides 708–854, encoding TM-1 and TM-2 in the predicted KCC4 protein. The deleted region corresponds precisely to exon 4 of hKCC1 (16Holtzman E.J. Kumar S. Faaland C.A. Warner F. Logue P.J. Erickson S.J. Ricken G. Waldman J. Dunham P.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: F550-F564PubMed Google Scholar), and hence at least part of the heterogeneity in KCC4 transcripts is the result of the alternative splicing of coding exons. The four KCC proteins are 65–71% identical (Fig. 2). Sequence alignments indicate that hKCC3 shares 69% identity with rat KCC2, 65% identity with hKCC1, and 66% identity with hKCC4. The hKCC4 protein shares 71% identity with hKCC1, 66% identity with rat KCC2, and 66% identity with hKCC3. The identity between the KCCs and other cation-chloride cotransporters is in the range of 27 to 33%. A phylogenetic tree indicates that the mammalian cation-chloride cotransporters fall into two groups, one composed of the Na+-K+-2Cl− cotransporters and the Na+-Cl− cotransporter, and the other encompassing the four K+-Cl− cotransporters. As indicated by direct sequence alignments, the four KCCs form two subgroups, KCC1 paired with KCC4 and KCC3 paired with KCC2 (Fig.3). The seven mammalian cation-chloride cotransporters share a predicted membrane topology. A central core of 12 TM domains is flanked by hydrophilic amino- and carboxyl-terminal domains that are known to have a cytoplasmic orientation (18Mount D.B. Delpire E. Gamba G. Hall A.E. Poch E. Hoover R.S. Hebert S.C. J. Exp. Biol. 1998; 201: 2091-2102PubMed Google Scholar). The major structural difference between the KCCs and the Na+-linked cotransporters is the position of a large glycosylated extracellular loop, which is predicted to occur between TM-5 and TM-6 in the KCCs and between TM-7 and TM-8 in the Na+-K+-2Cl− cotransporters and the Na+-Cl− cotransporter (18Mount D.B. Delpire E. Gamba G. Hall A.E. Poch E. Hoover R.S. Hebert S.C. J. Exp. Biol. 1998; 201: 2091-2102PubMed Google Scholar). Homology is most marked in the TM domains, the intracellular loops, and the cytoplasmic carboxyl terminus (Fig. 2). A comparison of the four KCCs reveals a number of intriguing differences. KCC4 is the longest of the four because of an extension of ∼60 amino acids at the extreme amino-terminal end (Fig. 2). Although highly conserved, none of the TM domains in the four KCCs are completely identical. Within the cytoplasmic"
https://openalex.org/W2026473446,"Assembly of multi-subunit membrane protein complexes is poorly understood. In this study, we present direct evidence that the D1 protein, a multiple membrane spanning protein, assembles co-translationally into the large membrane-bound complex, photosystem II. During pulse-chase studies in intact chloroplasts, incorporation of the D1 protein occurred without transient accumulation of free labeled protein in the thylakoid membrane, and photosystem II subcomplexes contained nascent D1 intermediates of 17, 22, and 25 kDa. These N-terminal D1 intermediates could be co-immunoprecipitated with antiserum directed against the D2 protein, suggesting co-translational assembly of the D1 protein into PS II complexes. Further evidence for a co-translational assembly of the D1 protein into photosystem II was obtained by analyzing ribosome nascent chain complexes liberated from the thylakoid membrane after a short pulse labeling. Radiolabeled D1 intermediates could be immunoprecipitated under nondenaturing conditions with antisera raised against the D1 and D2 protein as well as CP47. However, when the ribosome pellets were solubilized with SDS, the interaction of these intermediates with CP47 was completely lost, but strong interaction of a 25-kDa D1 intermediate with the D2 protein still remained. Taken together, our results indicate that during the repair of photosystem II, the assembly of the newly synthesized D1 protein into photosystem II occurs co-translationally involving direct interaction of the nascent D1 chains with the D2 protein."
https://openalex.org/W2148727539,"Human CC chemokines macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1α, MIP-1β, and RANTES (regulated on activation normal T cell expressed) self-associate to form high-molecular mass aggregates. To explore the biological significance of chemokine aggregation, nonaggregating variants were sought. The phenotypes of 105 hMIP-1α variants generated by systematic mutagenesis and expression in yeast were determined. hMIP-1α residues Asp26and Glu66 were critical to the self-association process. Substitution at either residue resulted in the formation of essentially homogenous tetramers at 0.5 mg/ml. Substitution of identical or analogous residues in homologous positions in both hMIP-1β and RANTES demonstrated that they were also critical to aggregation. Our analysis suggests that a single charged residue at either position 26 or 66 is insufficient to support extensive aggregation and that two charged residues must be present. Solution of the three-dimensional NMR structure of hMIP-1α has enabled comparison of these residues in hMIP-1β and RANTES. Aggregated and disaggregated forms of hMIP-1α, hMIP-1β, and RANTES generally have equivalent G-protein-coupled receptor-mediated biological potencies. We have therefore generated novel reagents to evaluate the role of hMIP-1α, hMIP-1β, and RANTES aggregation in vitro and in vivo.

Chemokines (chemotactic cytokines) are a family of proteins primarily involved in the coordination of cellular trafficking and activation during immune responses (1Ward S.G. Westwick J. Biochem. J. 1998; 333: 457-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). They have been characterized according to the sequence context around the first cysteine residue giving rise to the C, CC, CXC, and CX3C groups. Chemokines act via a family of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) 1The abbreviations used are: GPCR, G-protein-coupled receptor; MIP, macrophage inflammatory protein; RANTES, regulated on activation normal T-cell expressed; IL, interleukin; HIV, human immunodeficiency virus; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; AUC, analytical ultracentrifugation; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; FDCP, Factor-dependent cell lines, Paterson; BSA, bovine serum albumin; NOE, nuclear Overhauser effect; NOESY, nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy; PBMC, peripheral blood mononuclear cell. 1The abbreviations used are: GPCR, G-protein-coupled receptor; MIP, macrophage inflammatory protein; RANTES, regulated on activation normal T-cell expressed; IL, interleukin; HIV, human immunodeficiency virus; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; AUC, analytical ultracentrifugation; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; FDCP, Factor-dependent cell lines, Paterson; BSA, bovine serum albumin; NOE, nuclear Overhauser effect; NOESY, nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy; PBMC, peripheral blood mononuclear cell. and are unusually large ligands (>60 amino acids) for this type of receptor. There is some controversy concerning the quaternary structure of biologically active chemokines when they bind to receptors, with evidence to suggest either monomers or dimers (2Rajarathnam K.

Monomeric chemokine secondary structures are similar, comprising a triple-stranded antiparallel β-sheet arranged in a Greek key motif and a C-terminal α-helix. Despite conservation of secondary structure, two alternative forms of chemokine dimers have been described. Typically, CC chemokines like MIP-1β are elongated, whereas CXC chemokines like IL-8 form globular dimers. Exceptions are the CC chemokine MCP-3, which can form the globular IL-8 type dimer, and the CXC chemokine PF4, which forms tetramers. Human CC chemokines MIP-1α, MIP-1β, and RANTES (13Schall T.J.

Such self-association limits the range of purification and formulation conditions available for the clinical development of these proteins. Furthermore, the interpretation of bioassays is complicated, since different protein preparations may vary in their extent of aggregation (16Mantel C. Kim Y.J. Cooper S. Kwon B. Broxmeyer H.E. Proc.

The primary goal of this work was to identify biologically active variants of hMIP-1α that no longer self-associated, thereby allowing large scale production of protein for preclinical and clinical investigation. hMIP-1α is a multifunctional CC chemokine that binds with high affinity to chemokine receptors CCR1 and CCR5 (19Gao J.L.

HIV is generally classified according to its ability to replicate in macrophages (M-tropic) or established T-cell lines (T-tropic). Viruses isolated over the course of disease progression have been reported to change their in vitro properties from M- to T-tropic, suggesting that M-tropic (CCR5-utilizing) viruses are responsible for infection and the T-tropic (CXCR4-utilizing) viruses may be associated with the rapid CD4+ cell decline and onset of symptoms (35Connor R.I. Ho D.D. AIDS Res. Hum. Retroviruses. 1994; 10: 321-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Thus a second goal of our study was to compare the antiviral properties of aggregating and nonaggregating hMIP-1α, hMIP-1β, and RANTES variants. In this paper we describe the identification of two hMIP-1α amino acid residues critical for aggregation, substitution of which yielded biologically active disaggregated proteins. Furthermore, we show that substitution of the homologous residues in hMIP-1β and RANTES inhibits their aggregation without loss of bioactivity. Solution of the three-dimensional structure of hMIP-1α by NMR has enabled comparison of these residues in hMIP-1α, hMIP-1β, and RANTES. The G-protein-coupled receptor-mediated biological activities of the disaggregated chemokines, including inhibition of HIV-1 infection, are unaffected by these substitutions. However, RANTES was found to stimulate M- and T-tropic HIV infection in a concentration-dependent manner. In contrast nonaggregating RANTES did not enhance HIV-1 infection. Synthetic genes for hMIP-1α, hMIP-1β, and RANTES were designed by back-translation from their protein sequences with codon usage optimized forSaccharomyces cerevisiae (41.Craig, S., Hunter, M. G., Edwards, R. M., Czaplewski, L. G., and Gilbert, R. J. (July 8, 1993) International patent application WO 93/13206.Google Scholar). The genes were divided into 10 oligonucleotides (synthesized by R+D Systems Ltd.), and the oligonucleotides were annealed and cloned into M13 vectors. M13 clones were used as templates for mutagenesis to create the hMIP-1β D27A, hMIP-1β E67S, RANTES E26A, RANTES E66S, and the library of hMIP-1α mutants. Mutagenesis was performed according to the method of Kunkelet al. (42Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4540) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides used for mutagenesis were 17–36 nucleotides in length (41.Craig, S., Hunter, M. G., Edwards, R. M., Czaplewski, L. G., and Gilbert, R. J. (July 8, 1993) International patent application WO 93/13206.Google Scholar). Dideoxy sequencing was used to identify the correct clone for each variant in the M13 vectors. The wild-type and variant genes were transferred asHindIII/BamHI DNA fragments into the yeast expression vector pSW6 to drive protein expression under the control of the inducible galactose promoter (43Clements J.M. Craig S. Gearing A.J.H. Hunter M.G. Heyworth C.M. Dexter T.M. Lord B.I. Cytokine. 1992; 4: 76-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Recombinant pSW6 clones containing the mutated chemokine genes were sequenced using the dideoxy sequencing method for double-stranded DNA. S. cerevisiae strain MC2 was transformed with DNA containing the wild-type and mutant chemokine genes by the LiAc/polyethylene glycol protocol (44Geitz D. St. Jean A. Woods R.A. Schiestl R.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (2863) Google Scholar) and representative clones identified. All yeast media were as described previously (45Sherman F. Fink F.R. Hicks J.B. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1986Google Scholar). Transformant cultures were induced after 24 h of growth by harvesting synthetic complete-Glu broth cultures and resuspension in synthetic complete-Glu/Gal-broth. All cultures were tested for their ability to express chemokine protein by reverse-phase HPLC analysis of cell-free supernatants 2 days after induction. Clones were considered expression-competent if a clear recombinant protein elution peak was observed (approximately ≥20% of wild-type chemokine yield). Three days after induction the proteins were purified from the yeast culture supernatants according to previously published methods (15Patel S.R. Evans S. Dunne K. Knight G.C. Morgan P.J. Varley P.G. Craig S. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 5466-5471Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Both ion-exchange and reverse-phase HPLC chromatography were used to obtain the protein at 95% purity. Nondenaturing 4–20% (w/v) gradient polyacrylamide gels (Novex) were run under nondenaturing conditions in Tris-glycine buffer. See Blue markers (Novex) and wild-type hMIP-1α (2 μg) were analyzed on each gel. All variants were scored according to their mobility relative to the wild-type protein. AUC analysis was performed using a Beckman XLA analytical ultracentrifuge with absorbance optics as described previously (15Patel S.R. Evans S. Dunne K. Knight G.C. Morgan P.J. Varley P.G. Craig S. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 5466-5471Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 385). Protein samples at 0.1 or 0.5 mg/ml were loaded in a six-sector cell to enable simultaneous measurements and comparisons of variants. PBS “A” was loaded in the reference sector. Samples were analyzed at 15,000 rpm at 25 °C for 18 h to reach equilibrium. Final solute distributions were recorded at 235, 280, and 295 nm as a function of radius. Scans were repeated after a further 3 h of centrifugation to confirm that equilibrium had been achieved. The final solute distribution ASCII data was fitted using Microcal Origin software to a model assuming a single ideal species (Ideal1) to provide an estimate of the weight average molecular weight. Data sets shown are an average of 20 scans in 0.001-cm increments across the radius of the rotor. Competitive receptor binding assays using the FDCP-mix A4 cell line (Spooncer et al. (37Spooncer E. Heyworth C.M. Dunn A. Dexter T.M. Differentiation. 1986; 31: 111-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar)) have been described previously (38Hunter M.G. Bawden L. Brotherton D. Craig S.

Blood. 1995; 86: 4400-4408Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 1 × 106 murine FDCP-mix A4 cells, various amounts of unlabeled hMIP-1α or variants, and 3.85 ng/ml 125I-hMIP-1α (250 μCi/μg; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were incubated in a total volume of 250 μl of binding medium (RPMI 1640, 20 mmHEPES, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) at 25 °C for 60 min. Phosphate-buffered saline (1 ml) was added, mixed, and the cells harvested by centrifugation. The supernatants were removed and the cells washed twice with PBS. Radioactivity in the cell pellet was determined and IC50 values for the variants estimated. Competitive receptor binding experiments on human CCR1 were performed on HEK293 P4 cell membranes (19Gao J.L. Khuns D.B. Tiffany H.L. McDermott D. Li X. Francke U. Murphy P.M. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 177: 1421-1427Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). Cell membranes (1 μg) were incubated in 50 mm Tris-HCl pH 7.4 (250 μl), containing 0.05 nm iodinated hMIP-1α (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and various concentrations of unlabeled hMIP-1α mutant proteins for 30 min at 37 °C. The membranes were harvested onto Whatman GFB filters (presoaked in 0.3% polyethyleneimine) on a Brandel harvester and washed with 5 × 1 ml of ice-cold wash buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 0.5 m NaCl, 5 mmMgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 0.05% bovine serum albumin, pH 7.4). Filters were counted on a Beckman Cobra counter and the data fitted using Prism (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA) and IC50 values determined automatically. Human embryonic kidney cell lines transfected with human CCR1 (P4 cell line, Ref. 19Gao J.L. Khuns D.B. Tiffany H.L. McDermott D. Li X. Francke U. Murphy P.M. J. Exp.

P4 cells were supplemented with 0.25 mg/ml hygromycin and 8.5 cells with 1 mg/ml G418. Cells were harvested with trypsin, washed in growth medium, and resuspended at 2–3 × 106 cells/ml. Fura-2AM-loaded cells were washed and resuspended in Tyrodes buffer to give 2–3 × 106 cells/ml. A Perkin-Elmer LS-50B fluorimeter was used to measure Fura-2 fluorescence emission intensity. Fura-2-loaded cells (2 ml, 2 × 106 cells/ml) were transferred to a 4.5-ml UV grade cuvette (Fisons); CaCl2was added to 1 mm and left to equilibrate for 2 min. The samples were excited at 340 nm with a 10 nm bandwidth and the emission continuously recorded at 500 nm with a 5 nm bandwidth. Chemokines were added (20 μl, 100 × final concentration) and the increase in intracellular calcium noted (Hunter et al. (38Hunter M.G. Bawden L. Brotherton D. Craig S. Cribbes S. Czaplewski L.G.

Cell migration was evaluated using 24-well tissue culture plate inserts with polyethylene terephthalate membranes (8-μm pore size, Falcon). Chemokines were diluted (10−7to 10−12m) in fetal calf serum-free RPMI 1640 medium and 0.5 ml of each dilution placed into the companion plate. Freshly purified human mononuclear cells were suspended at 2.5 × 106 cells/ml in fetal calf serum-free RPMI 1640 and 0.2 ml placed onto the insert filters prior to setting the inserts into the wells. The filters were removed after 2-h incubation, the medium discarded, and the filters dried. The cells were fixed in 4% (v/v) formaldehyde for 10 min, washed in PBS, stained with 2% (w/v) cresyl violet acetate and washed in PBS. Migration was assessed by averaging the count from two high-powered fields (× 400 magnification) per assay point in each experiment. The data presented are the mean number of cells/high-powered fields from four independent experiments. 15N/13C-labeled hMIP-1α and hMIP-1α D26A was prepared by established methodology using thePichia pastoris expression system (46Laroche Y. Storme V. De Meutter J. Messens J. Lauwereys M. Bio/Technology. 1994; 12: 1119-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Minor modifications reduced the concentration of [13C]methanol to 4% (w/v) used in the induction to reduce costs. hMIP-1α D26A was purified from the culture supernatant by sequential cation exchange and reverse-phase high-pressure liquid chromatography. Samples for NMR were at ∼3 mm concentration, pH 3.5, 10% (v/v) D2O. All spectra were collected at 318 K. Homonuclear assignment was performed as described by Wüthrich (47Wüthrich K. NMR of Proteins and Nucleic Acids. John Wiley, New York1986Crossref Google Scholar), and heteronuclear assignments were performed as reviewed by Whitehead et al. (48Whitehead B. Craven C.J. Waltho J.P. Reid D. Methods in Molecular Biology. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ1997: 29-52Google Scholar). 15N relaxation data were acquired as described by Kördel et al. (49Kördel J. Skelton N. Akke M. Palmer A.G. Chazin W. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 4856-4866Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Constraints for structure calculations were obtained from a 150-ms homonuclear NOE experiment (50Macura S. Huang Y. Suter D. Ernst R.R. J. Magn. Reson. 1981; 43: 259-281Google Scholar), a 150-ms simultaneous15N/13C edited NOESY experiment (51Pascal S.M. Muhandiram D.R. Yamazaki T. Forman-Kay J.I. Kay L.E. J. Magn. Reson. 1994; B103: 197-201Crossref Scopus (279) Google Scholar), and a 150-ms double-filtered NOESY experiment. All data were collected and analyzed using FELIX (Micron Separations, San Diego, CA). The constraints were divided into three ranges with upper bounds of 2.5, 3.5, and 5 Å, based on a calibration from elements of regular secondary structure. φ constraints were obtained from an heteronuclear single quantum coherence-J experiment (52Billeter M. Neri D. Otting G. Qian Y.Q. Wülthrich K. J. Biomol. NMR. 1992; 2: 257-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), constraining φ to either −60 (±40)o or −120 (±50)o. The structure calculation protocol consisted of calculation of approximate monomer structures, followed by filtering out of probable dimer NOEs using a filter cutoff of 10 Å. This process was cycled several times. Dimer NOEs were also checked against the double filtered NOESY experiment, although this was insufficiently sensitive to detect all NOEs, and acted mainly as a rigorous check that the correct dimer interface was present. The monomer structures were oriented as rigid entities via the dimer NOEs while being maintained at a separation of 100 Å. The monomers were then annealed together and the structures refined by further annealing cycles. All calculations were performed using modified variants of the protocol of Nilges et al.(53Nilges M. Clore G.M. Gronenborn A. FEBS Lett. 1988; 239: 129-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar), using XPLOR (54Brünger A.T. X-PLOR. A System for X-ray Crystallography and NMR. Yale University Press, New Haven, CT1992Google Scholar). Fig. 4, Aand B, were created using RASMOL (55Sayle R.A. Milner-White E.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 374-376Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2298) Google Scholar). An ensemble of 10 structures and a minimized mean structure of hMIP-1α D26A have been submitted to the Brookhaven Protein Data Bank, entries 1B50 and 1B53, respectively. Neutralization was assessed using PHA-stimulated PBMC as target cells with determination of soluble p24 antigen production as the end point (56Albert J. Abrahamsson B. Nagy K. Aurelius E. Gaines H. Nystrom G. Fenyü E.M. AIDS. 1990; 4: 107-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). Chemokines were tested for their ability to inhibit HIV infection by incubation of a known concentration with 100,000 PBMC (mixed from two blood donors) in a final volume of 75 μl of RPMI, 10% fetal calf serum, IL-2 (5 units/ml) for 2 h at 37 °C. Cells were infected with a known infectious titer of virus, 100 TCID50, and the virus/ligand incubation mixture incubated at 37 °C overnight. Cells were washed the following day, the relevant concentration of chemokine added back to all cultures, and incubated at 37 °C for 5 days. 105 single amino acid substituted variants of hMIP-1α were generated by oligonucleotide site-directed mutagenesis (Fig.1 A). All mutations were verified at the M13, yeast expression vector, and postexpression stages by DNA recovery and sequencing (data not shown). Initially, charged residues implicated in the aggregation process were mutated; however, the entire molecule was screened such that all hydrophilic residues were mutated to serine and all hydrophobic residues to alanine. Sixty-five of the 69 hMIP-1α residues were substituted, and the four cysteine residues were unmodified to retain structural integrity. Expression of 75% of the mutants was comparable with that of hMIP-1α, allowing purification of protein with substitutions at 55 of the 65 available residues. Substantial changes in the self-association of the hMIP-1α variant proteins were initially detected by native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Of the 79 variants analyzed, 37, representing 28 residues, migrated more rapidly through the gel than hMIP-1α (Fig. 1 B). Sedimentation equilibrium AUC analysis was used to provide a quantitative assessment of the effects of the substitutions on hMIP-1α self-association (36Varley P.G. Brown A.J. Dawkes H.C. Burns N.R. Eur. Biophys. J. 1997; 25: 437-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Twenty-three of the 37 variants analyzed had substantially reduced (<100 kDa) weight average molecular weights than hMIP-1α (>100 kDa). These variants represented 16 positions in hMIP-1α at which substitution leads to significant disaggregation (Fig. 1 C). Native gel electrophoresis appeared to enhance the effects of substitution on hMIP-1α variants, implying greater effects on self-association than observed by AUC analysis. The high glycine concentration in the gel may be responsible for the differences between the two assays. The AUC analysis is generally accepted to be a preferable method of analysis of self-association. The activity of the disaggregated hMIP-1α variants was assessed in a receptor binding assay using the murine cell line, FDCP-mix A4 (37Spooncer E. Heyworth C.M. Dunn A. Dexter T.M. Differentiation. 1986; 31: 111-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar,38Hunter M.G. Bawden L. Brotherton D. Craig S. Cribbes S. Czaplewski L.G. Dexter T.M. Drummond A.H. Gearing A.H.

Nineteen variants, representing substitution at 16 residues, were assessed for their ability to bind the murine MIP-1α receptor expressed by these cells in a competitive receptor binding assay.

Necdin, like the retinoblastoma protein, interacts with cell cycle promoting proteins such as simian virus 40 large T antigen, adenovirus E1A, and the transcription factor E2F1. Here we demonstrate that necdin interacts with the tumor suppressor protein p53 as well. The yeast two-hybrid and in vitro binding analyses revealed that necdin bound to a narrow region (amino acids 35–62) located between the MDM2-binding site and the proline-rich region in the amino-terminal domain of p53. The electrophoretic mobility shift assay showed that necdin supershifted a complex between p53 and its binding DNA, implying that the p53-necdin complex is competent for DNA binding. In p53-deficient osteosarcoma SAOS-2 cells, necdin markedly suppressed p53-dependent activation of the p21/WAF promoter. Necdin and p53 inhibited cell growth in an additive manner as assessed by the colony formation of SAOS-2 cells, suggesting that necdin does not affect p53-mediated growth suppression. On the other hand, necdin inhibited p53-induced apoptosis of osteosarcoma U2OS cells. Thus, necdin can be a growth suppressor that targets p53 and modulates its biological functions in postmitotic neurons. Necdin is expressed in virtually all postmitotic neurons, and ectopic expression of this protein suppresses cell proliferation.

Thus, necdin can be a growth suppressor that targets p53 and modulates its biological functions in postmitotic neurons. In the vertebrate central nervous system, neurons withdraw from the cell cycle immediately after differentiation from their proliferative precursors, termed neuroepithelial stem cells. Differentiated neurons are absolutely incompetent to divide even in the presence of extracellular stimuli that promote cell cycle progression of proliferative cells. Therefore, the permanent arrest of the cell cycle is the most fundamental feature displayed by differentiated neurons. However, little is known about the molecular mechanism whereby neurons exit from the cell cycle and remain quiescent all of their lives. In proliferative cells, the cell cycle is strictly controlled by various regulatory proteins. Among them, E2F1 is a principal transcription factor that controls cell cycle progression of dividing cells (reviewed in Ref. 1Adams P.D. Kaelin W.G. Cancer Biol. 1995; 6: 99-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). In the G1 phase, E2F1 is inactivated by interacting with retinoblastoma protein (Rb). 1The abbreviations used are: Rb, retinoblastoma protein; MBP, maltose-binding protein; BrdUrd, bromodeoxyuridine; PWS, Prader-Willi syndrome. During G1-S transition, this interaction disappears by phosphorylation of Rb, and released E2F1 activates transcription of its target genes that are indispensable for DNA replication. Thus, the Rb-E2F1 system is thought to govern exit from or passage through the cell cycle (reviewed in Refs. 2Nevins J.R. Science. 1992; 258: 424-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (1365) Google Scholar and 3Weinberg R.A. Cell. 1995; 81: 323-330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4312) Google Scholar). Several previous studies have suggested that the Rb-E2F1 system is also involved in the growth arrest associated with neuronal differentiation (4Lee E.Y.-H.P. Chang C.-Y. Hu N. Wang Y.-C.J. Lai C.-C. Herrup K. Lee W.-H. Bradley A. Nature. 1992; 359: 288-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (1125) Google Scholar, 5Jacks T. Fazeli A. Schmitt E.M. Bronson R.T. Goodell M.A. Weinberg R.A. Nature. 1992; 359: 295-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (1518) Google Scholar, 6Slack R.S. Hamel P.A. Bladon T.S. Gill R.M. McBurney M.W. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 1585-1591PubMed Google Scholar). Necdin is a 325-amino acid residue protein encoded in a cDNA sequence isolated from the library of neurally differentiated murine embryonal carcinoma P19 cells (7Maruyama K. Usami M. Aizawa T. Yoshikawa K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 178: 291-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The necdin gene is expressed in postmitotic neurons derived from embryonal carcinoma cells but not in transformed cell lines originating from neuroblastomas and pheochromocytomas even after they are induced to differentiate (8Aizawa T. Maruyama K. Kondo H. Yoshikawa K. Dev. Brain Res. 1992; 68: 265-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). In developing mouse brain, the necdin gene is constitutively expressed in neurons from early embryonic stages (e.g. embryonic day 10 at the forebrain) until late adult periods, whereas necdin mRNA is undetectable in neuroepithelial stem cells in the neural tube (8Aizawa T. Maruyama K. Kondo H. Yoshikawa K. Dev. Brain Res. 1992; 68: 265-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 9Uetsuki T. Takagi K. Sugiura H. Yoshikawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 918-924Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that necdin is expressed in postmitotic neurons that are differentiated from their precursor cells in an irreversible manner. Ectopic expression of necdin in NIH 3T3 cells suppresses the cell growth without affecting cell viability (10Hayashi Y. Matsuyama K. Takagi K. Sugiura H. Yoshikawa K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 213: 317-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, necdin binds to viral oncoproteins such as SV40 large T antigen and adenovirus E1A (11Taniura H. Taniguchi N. Hara M. Yoshikawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 720-728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Moreover, necdin interacts with the transcription factor E2F1 and suppresses E2F1-dependent transcription (11Taniura H. Taniguchi N. Hara M. Yoshikawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 720-728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). These characteristics of necdin resemble those of Rb, although these proteins are structurally dissimilar. Both necdin and Rb bind to the COOH-terminal transactivation domain of E2F1 (11Taniura H. Taniguchi N. Hara M. Yoshikawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 720-728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). This transactivation domain is also a target of MDM2, a cellular oncogene product that binds to SV40 large T antigen (12Brown D.R. Deb S. Munoz R.M. Subler M.A. Deb S.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6849-6857Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The necdin-binding site on E2F1 is located in a close proximity to the MDM2-binding site (11Taniura H. Taniguchi N. Hara M. Yoshikawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 720-728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 13Martin K. Trouche D. Hagemeier C. Sorensen T.S. La Thangue N.B. Kouzarides T. Nature. 1995; 375: 691-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar), although MDM2, unlike necdin, enhances E2F1-mediated transcriptional activation (13Martin K. Trouche D. Hagemeier C. Sorensen T.S. La Thangue N.B. Kouzarides T. Nature. 1995; 375: 691-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). Furthermore, MDM2 interacts with the transactivation domain of the tumor suppressor p53 and represses the p53-driven transcriptional activity (14Oliner J.D. Pietenpol J.A. Thiagalingam S. Gyuris J. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Nature. 1993; 362: 857-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (1307) Google Scholar, 15Momand J. Zambetti G.P. Olson D.C. George D. Levine A.J. Cell. 1992; 69: 1237-1245Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2792) Google Scholar). There is a substantial degree of homology between the E2F1 and p53 activation domains (13Martin K. Trouche D. Hagemeier C. Sorensen T.S. La Thangue N.B. Kouzarides T. Nature. 1995; 375: 691-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar, 14Oliner J.D. Pietenpol J.A. Thiagalingam S. Gyuris J. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Nature. 1993; 362: 857-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (1307) Google Scholar), suggesting a conservation of binding sites for specific proteins. These findings prompted us to examine whether necdin also interacts with p53. In this study, we demonstrate that necdin does form a specific complex with p53 to modulate p53-mediated biological functions. We have used the yeast two-hybrid system and in vitro binding analyses to map the necdin-binding region on p53. Using cultured cells that are often adopted for functional analyses of p53, we have examined the effects of necdin on p53-mediated transcriptional activation, growth arrest, and apoptosis. The present results implicate that necdin is a novel type of growth suppressor that targets both p53 and E2F1. GAL4 DNA-binding domain vector (pGBT9) and GAL4 activation domain vector (pGAD424) were purchased fromCLONTECH. cDNAs encoding various p53 subsequences were generated from full-length p53 cDNA (a gift from Dr. T. Akiyama, University of Tokyo) by polymerase chain reaction using specific primers and inserted into pGAD424. These vectors were introduced along with pGBT9 harboring necdin cDNAs (11Taniura H. Taniguchi N. Hara M. Yoshikawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 720-728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) intoSaccharomyces cerevisiae SFY526. Transformants were grown on leucine- and tryptophan-deficient synthetic dropout medium plates, and the colony lift filter assay for β-galactosidase activity was carried out as recommended by CLONTECH. The reaction was evaluated, and the results were separated into four ranks with the time for the appearance of blue colonies at 30 °C: +++, less than 2 h; ++, 2–6 h; +, 6–12 h; −, remaining white over 12 h. Various fragments of p53 cDNA were subcloned into pMALC2 (New England Biolabs) to make maltose-binding protein (MBP) fusion proteins. The MBP fusion proteins were affinity-purified with amylose resin as recommended by New England Biolabs. Full-length necdin cDNA was subcloned into a baculovirus transfer vector (pBlueBacHis2/B) (Invitrogen) for expression as a His-tagged fusion protein. The transfer vector and a wild-type baculovirus DNA (Bac-N-Blue AcMNPV) were introduced to Sf21 insect cells to obtain AcMNPV-Ndn. The recombinant His-tagged necdin expressed in AcMNPV-Ndn-infected Sf9 insect cells was purified using Probond metal-binding resin (Invitrogen). MBP-p53 fusion proteins (1 μg) bound to amylose resin (5 μl) was incubated with purified His-tagged necdin (100 ng) at 4 °C for 30 min in 0.5 ml of binding buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 200 mm NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA). The resin was washed with the binding buffer, and bound proteins were eluted with 20 mm maltose. His-tagged necdin was separated by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred to Immobilon membrane (Millipore) by electroblotting, and detected with an anti-necdin antibody (C2) (1:1000) (7Maruyama K. Usami M. Aizawa T. Yoshikawa K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 178: 291-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) and peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Cappel) using chemiluminescence method (Renaissance, NEN Life Science Products). Protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford method (Bio-Rad). The oligonucleotide probe containing the p53-binding site (5′-TACAGAACATGTCTAAGCATGCTGGGG-3′) was labeled with [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using T4 polynucleotide kinase. cDNAs encoding Myc tag p53 proteins were cloned into pRc/CMV (Invitrogen) for expression of Myc-tagged p53 (amino acids 1–393) (pRc-Myc-p53), its NH2-terminal deletion mutants p53 (amino acids 55–393) (pRc-Myc-p53 (55–393)), and p53 (amino acids 75–393) (pRc-Myc-p53 (75–393)). The Myc tag was added to the p53 subsequences using a 6 × Myc tag plasmid (a gift from Dr. M. W. McBurney, University of Ottawa). The expression vectors were transfected into SAOS-2 cells by the calcium phosphate method (16Graham F.L. van der Eb A.J. Virology. 1973; 52: 456-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (6495) Google Scholar). Nuclear extracts (2–4 μg of protein) were prepared by the small scale extraction method (17Schreiber E. Matthias P. Muller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3917) Google Scholar) and incubated in a reaction mixture (20 μl) containing 15 mm Hepes (pH 7.9), 1 mm EDTA, 4% Ficoll 400, 4 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 μg of sonicated salmon sperm DNA, and the 32P-labeled oligonucleotide probe. For supershift analysis, the reaction mixture was incubated at 4 °C for 60 min with hybridoma culture media (1:10) containing anti-Myc (9E10) and anti-E1A (M73) antibodies or with purified His-tagged necdin (100 ng). DNA binding activities were analyzed by electrophoresis in a 4% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel run in a buffer (25 mm Tris borate (pH 8.2), 50 mm EDTA) at 4 °C. Combinations of expression vectors of pRc-necdin, pRc-Myc-p53, and pRc-Myc-p53 (75–393) were transfected into SAOS-2 cells, and nuclear extracts were prepared 48 h after transfection. Aliquots (40 μg of protein) of extracts were incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with the anti-Myc antibody (1:5) or with an anti-necdin antibody C2 (1:125) in 250 μl of a buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 200 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The antibody-protein complexes were pelleted with protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and analyzed by immunoblotting as described above. A 2.4-kilobase pair fragment of human p21/WAF1 promoter (18Datto M.B. Yu Y. Wang X.F. J. Biol.

Virology. 1973; 52: 456-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (6495) Google Scholar). Transfectants were harvested 36 h after transfection, and luciferase activities were measured with a luminometer (Lumat LB9501, Berthold) using a reagent kit (Toyo Ink, Tokyo). Transfection efficiency was normalized with co-transfected LacZ reporter plasmid (pRc-LacZ) (11Taniura H. Taniguchi N. Hara M. Yoshikawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 720-728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The colony formation assay using SAOS-2 cells was carried out as described previously (11Taniura H. Taniguchi N. Hara M. Yoshikawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 720-728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). SAOS-2 cells grown in 60-mm dishes were transfected with pRc-Myc-p53 (5 μg), pRc-necdin (5 μg), or both (5 μg each) by the calcium phosphate method (16Graham F.L. van der Eb A.J. Virology. 1973; 52: 456-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (6495) Google Scholar). G418 (500 μg/ml) was added to the culture medium 48 h after transfection. The cells were incubated for 14 days, fixed with 10% acetate/10% methanol for 15 min, and stained with 0.4% crystal violet in 20% ethanol for 15 min to visualize the colonies. For bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) labeling, the 293 cells grown on coverslips in 35-mm dishes were transfected with pRc-LacZ (0.5 μg) and combinations of pRc-Myc-p53 (0.8 μg), pRc-necdin (1.6 μg), and pRc-necdinΔN (1.6 μg). The empty vector pRc/CMV was added to equalize the amounts of transfected DNA (4 μg/assay). BrdUrd was added to the medium (final concentration, 10 μm) 36 h after transfection, and the cells were fixed 2 h later with 70% ethanol containing 20 mm glycine-HCl (pH 2.0) for 25 min at −20 °C. BrdUrd and β-galactosidase were detected by fluorescence immunocytochemistry with an anti-BrdUrd monoclonal antibody (1:200) (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and an anti-β-galactosidase polyclonal antibody (1:2000) (Chemicon). BrdUrd and β-galactosidase were visualized with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse immunoglobulin (1:500) (Cappel) and rhodamine B-conjugated goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin (1:500) (Cappel), respectively, using a fluorescence microscope (BX 50–34-FLAD 1, Olympus). BrdUrd-positive cells among 100 β-galactosidase-positive cells were counted. U2OS cells (∼70% confluence) grown on coverslips in 35-mm dishes and transfected with pRc-Myc-p53 and/or pRc-necdin. The cells were fixed at 48, 60, and 72 h with 4% formaldehyde (pH 7.4) for 25 min at 4 °C and treated with methanol for 20 min at 20 °C and incubated with the anti-Myc antibody (1:10) and the anti-necdin antibody C2 (1:1000) for 1 h at 20 °C. Myc-tagged p53 and necdin were visualized with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse immunoglobulin and rhodamine B-conjugated anti-rabbit immunoglobulin, respectively. For Hoechst dye staining, the fixed cells were treated with 3.3 μm Hoechst 33342 for 15 min at 20 °C and observed with the fluorescence microscope. p53-immunopositive cells in 10 nonadjacent fields (total area, 10 mm2) were counted. Statistical significance was tested using Student's ttest. We first examined whether necdin interacts with p53 by the yeast two-hybrid assay. Because the NH2-terminal sequences of necdin fused to GAL4 DNA-binding protein stimulate the transcription even in the absence of GAL4 activation fusion proteins (11Taniura H. Taniguchi N. Hara M. Yoshikawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 720-728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), we used an NH2-terminally truncated form of necdin (amino acids 83–325) as a DNA-binding fusion protein in this assay. As shown in Fig. 1, full-length p53 (amino acids 1–393) strongly interacted with necdin (amino acids 83–325). Because the transactivation domain of p53 is located at the NH2terminus, NH2-terminally truncated p53 mutants were tested for necdin binding activities. An MDM2-binding site-deleted mutant (amino acids 35–393) still retained the ability to bind to necdin, but further deletions (amino acids 55–393 and 75–393) failed to bind to necdin. These results suggest that necdin binds to the transactivation domain, in which a region (amino acids 35–55) is indispensable. We then tested the in vitro binding between necdin and p53 (Fig. 2). We prepared a series of p53 deletion mutants as MBP fusion proteins and confirmed that purified MBP-p53 fusion proteins had predicted sizes of polypeptides (Fig.2 A). These MBP-p53 fusion proteins were incubated with His-tagged necdin, and formation of p53-necdin complexes in vitro was examined. As shown in Fig. 2 B, both p53 (amino acids 1–393) and p53 (amino acids 35–393) bound to necdin, whereas neither p53 (amino acids 55–393) nor p53 (amino acids 75–393) had necdin binding activities. An NH2-terminal region of p53 (amino acids 1–83), which encompasses the transactivation domain, was competent to interact with necdin. An NH2-terminal subsequence of p53 (amino acids 1–37), which contains the entire MDM2-binding region, failed to interact with necdin, whereas a region (amino acids 35–62) located between the MDM2-binding site and the proline-rich region retained the necdin binding activity. These data are schematically shown in Fig. 2 C. We have previously reported that the large T antigen, E1A, and E2F1 bind to the central domain of necdin (amino acids 83–292) (11Taniura H. Taniguchi N. Hara M. Yoshikawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 720-728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The p53-binding region on necdin was determined using various necdin deletion mutants in the two-hybrid system (Fig.3). Both necdin (amino acids 83–325) and necdin (amino acids 102–325) strongly bound to p53, but further NH2-terminal truncations of necdin (amino acids 110–325, 167–325) failed to interact with p53. Although a COOH-terminally truncated form of necdin (amino acids 83–292) retained the ability to bind to p53, a further truncated form of necdin (amino acids 83–279) had no p53 binding activity. These results suggest that the central region of necdin is indispensable for the interaction with p53. This region coincided with the region required for the interactions with the large T antigen (11Taniura H. Taniguchi N. Hara M. Yoshikawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 720-728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Although p53 and E2F1 share the binding domain on necdin, p53 showed a stronger necdin binding activity than E2F1 (Fig.3). We carried out the electrophoretic mobility shift assay to examine whether necdin affects the ability of p53 to bind to its specific DNA sequence (Fig.4). SAOS-2 cells transfected with cDNAs for Myc-tagged fusion proteins of p53 (amino acids 1–393), p53 (amino acids 55–393), and p53 (amino acids 75–393) expressed the products of predicted sizes (Fig. 4 A). These three p53 species, all of which contain the sequence-specific DNA-binding region, formed complexes with p53 site-carrying DNA (Fig. 4 B,lanes 3, 6, and 9). The signals of these p53-containing complexes were competed with excess amounts of the oligonucleotide (data not shown). These major bands were supershifted or diminished in density by the anti-Myc antibody (Fig. 4 B,lanes 5, 8, and 1 1) but not by the anti-E1A antibody used as a negative control (Fig. 4 B,lanes 4, 7, and 10), indicating that shifted complexes contain Myc-tagged p53 proteins. Addition of purified His-tagged necdin protein to the reaction mixture supershifted the complexes containing p53 (amino acids 1–393) and p53 (amino acids 55–393) (Fig. 4 C, lanes 2 and 4) but not the complex containing p53 (amino acids 75–393) (Fig.4 C, lane 6). These results imply that the necdin-p53 complexes are competent for DNA binding. In this analysis, the NH2-terminally truncated mutant p53 (amino acids 55–393), which failed to interact with necdin in the two-hybrid andin vitro binding assays (Figs. 1 and 2), bound to necdin. It seems likely that a potential binding site present in p53 (amino acids 55–74) is manifested by a conformational change due to p53-DNA complex formation in the mobility shift assay. We were unable to reconstitute the necdin-p53 complex competent for DNA binding by using purified MBP-p53 fusion protein instead of nuclear extracts of p53 cDNA-transfected cells (data not shown), suggesting that additional nuclear factors are required for the complex formation. We examined the effect of necdin on p53-driven transactivation using SAOS-2 cells. As shown in Fig. 5 A, necdin formed a nuclear complex with Myc-tagged p53 in SAOS-2 cells. Necdin bound to full-length p53 (amino acids 1–393) but not to the NH2-terminally truncated p53 (amino acids 75–393). We then transfected full-length necdin and p53 into SAOS-2 cells with a luciferase reporter vector driven by the p21/WAF1 promoter (18Datto M.B. Yu Y. Wang X.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28623-28628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar), which contains the p53-binding site. As shown in Fig. 5 B, necdin had no appreciable effect on the reporter activity in the absence of co-transfected p53, whereas the p53-stimulated activity (6-fold of the basal activity) was suppressed by full-length necdin"
https://openalex.org/W2106038332,"In an effort to understand transcriptional regulation by the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ), we have investigated its potential interaction with coregulators and have identified ARA70 as a ligand-enhanced coactivator. ARA70 was initially described as a coactivator for the androgen receptor (AR) and is expressed in a range of tissues including adipose tissue (Yeh, S., and Chang, C. (1996) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 93, 5517–5521). Here we show that ARA70 and PPARγ specifically interact by coimmunoprecipitation and in a mammalian two-hybrid assay. PPARγ and ARA70 interact in the absence of the PPARγ ligand 15-deoxy-Δ12,14-prostaglandin J2, although the addition of exogenous ligand enhances this interaction. Similarly, in transient transfection of DU145 cells, cotransfection of PPARγ and ARA70 induces transcription from reporter constructs driven by either three copies of an isolated PPAR response element or the natural promoter of the adipocyte fatty acid-binding protein 2 in the absence of exogenous 15-deoxy-Δ12,14-prostaglandin J2. However, this PPARγ-ARA70 transactivation is enhanced by the addition of ligand. Thus, ARA70 can function as a ligand-enhanced coactivator of PPARγ. Finally, we show that AR can squelch PPARγ-ARA70 transactivation, which suggests that cross-talk may occur between PPARγ- and AR-mediated responses in adipocytes."
https://openalex.org/W2065674919,"The functional role of neutrophils during acute inflammatory responses is regulated by two high affinity interleukin-8 receptors (CXCR1 and CXCR2) that are rapidly desensitized and internalized upon binding their cognate chemokine ligands. The efficient re-expression of CXCR1 on the surface of neutrophils following agonist-induced internalization suggests that CXCR1 surface receptor turnover may involve regulatory pathways and intracellular factors similar to those regulating β2-adrenergic receptor internalization and re-expression. To examine the internalization pathway utilized by ligand-activated CXCR1, a CXCR1-GFP construct was transiently expressed in two different cell lines, HEK 293 and RBL-2H3 cells. While interleukin-8 stimulation promoted CXCR1 sequestration in RBL-2H3 cells, receptor internalization in HEK 293 cells required co-expression of G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 and β-arrestin proteins. The importance of β-arrestins in CXCR1 internalization was confirmed by the ability of a dominant negative β-arrestin 1-V53D mutant to block internalization of CXCR1 in RBL-2H3 cells. A role for dynamin was also demonstrated by the lack of CXCR1 internalization in dynamin I-K44A dominant negative mutant-transfected RBL-2H3 cells. Agonist-promoted co-localization of transferrin and CXCR1-GFP in endosomes of RBL-2H3 cells confirmed that receptor internalization occurs via clathrin-coated vesicles.

A general characteristic of inflammatory responses is the migration of leukocytes from the blood to sites of injury or infection. A number of chemoattractants have been shown to cause the directed migration of leukocytes in vitro and in vivo. These include complement fragment C5a, formylated bacterial peptides (fMLP), arachidonic acid metabolites (LTB4), and a group of low-molecular weight pro-inflammatory cytokines known as chemokines (1Fernandez H.N.

The superfamily of chemokines is subdivided into different subsets based on the presence and positioning of highly conserved cysteine residues. The family, based on the configuration of the first two N-terminal located cysteines, is divided into CC, CXC, and CX3C subfamilies. All known neutrophil-targeted human chemokines belonging to the CXC subfamily (IL-8, 1The abbreviations used are: IL-8, interleukin-8; GPCR, guanine nucleotide-binding protein-coupled receptor; β2AR, β2-adrenergic receptor; GRK, G protein-coupled receptor kinases; GFP, green fluorescent protein; HEK, human embryonic kidney; RBL, rat basophilic leukemia; CCV, clathrin-coated vesicle; EMEM, Eagle's minimal essential medium; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. 1The abbreviations used are: IL-8, interleukin-8; GPCR, guanine nucleotide-binding protein-coupled receptor; β2AR, β2-adrenergic receptor; GRK, G protein-coupled receptor kinases; GFP, green fluorescent protein; HEK, human embryonic kidney; RBL, rat basophilic leukemia; CCV, clathrin-coated vesicle; EMEM, Eagle's minimal essential medium; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline.

The two receptor subtypes differ notably in their N-terminal extracellular domains, as well as in their C-terminal intracellular domains, and possess differences in their ligand specificities. CXCR1 displays greater ligand specificity by binding to IL-8 and GCP-2 with high affinity, whereas CXCR2 binds with high affinity multiple CXC chemokines in addition to IL-8, including ENA 78, NAP-2, GROα, and GROβ (6Murphy P.M.

In the case of β2-AR, agonist binding induces a change in the receptor conformation, which is necessary for the interaction of the receptor with G protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs) (17Premont T.P.

GRK-mediated phosphorylation of the β2-AR C terminus promotes binding of arrestin proteins (β-arrestins) which when bound, elicit uncoupling of the receptor from its G protein (18Lohse M.J.

Desensitized β2-ARs, internalized via CCVs, are thought to be resensitized in the acidified endosomal environment and recycled back to the cell surface to re-establish normal receptor signaling (24Zhang J. Barak L.S. Winkler K.E. Caron M.G. Ferguson S.S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27005-27014Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). In the present work we examined the role of GRK2, β-arrestins, and dynamin in regulating CXCR1 internalization. For this purpose a CXCR1-green fluorescent protein (GFP) construct (CXCR1-GFP) was transiently expressed in human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK 293) and rat basophilic leukemia 2H3 (RBL-2H3) cell lines. We demonstrate that GRK2, β-arrestins, and dynamin are required for rapid agonist-induced internalization of CXCR1. HEK 293 and RBL-2H3 cell lines were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). Dulbecco's modified essential medium and Eagle's modified essential medium (EMEM) were purchased from Biowhittaker (Walkerswille, MD). Chemiluminescent substrates and horseradish peroxidase-coupled donkey anti-rabbit antibody were purchased from Amersham (Amersham International). The plasmid containing a variant of a green fluorescence protein (pEGFP-N1) and a green fluorescence protein directed polyclonal antibody were purchased from CLONTECH (Palo Alto, CA). Human recombinant interleukin-8 (IL-8) was obtained from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN) and 125I-IL-8 was obtained from Amersham. Texas Red-transferrin conjugates were purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). RNA from human neutrophils was isolated using TriPureTM Isolation Reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and CXCR1 cDNA synthesized using SuperscriptTM II reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The coding sequence of CXCR1 was amplified using forward (AAGAGGACATGTCAAATATTACAGAT) and reverse (TTCATCGATGGTTTTCCGAGG) primers carrying EcoRI restriction enzyme recognition sequence. Polymerase chain reaction products were 5′ and 3′ terminal digested with EcoRI and cloned into pEGFP-N1 cloning vector. The final construct was sequenced through the region that was generated by polymerase chain reaction to confirm sequence fidelity. HEK 293 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified essential medium whereas RBL-2H3 cells were grown in EMEM, both containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 1:100 dilution of penicillin/streptomycin (BioWhittaker) at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2. HEK 293 cells were seeded 12 h prior to transfection in 35-mm glass bottom plates (MatTek Corp., Ashland, MA) at a density of 2 × 105cells per dish and RBL-2H3 cells were seeded at a density of 1 × 105 cells per dish 3 h prior to transfection. HEK 293 cells were transiently transfected with 5 μg of CXCR1-GFP and 7.5 μg of pcMV5 rat β-arrestin 1/pcMV5 rat β-arrestin 2, and/or 7.5 μg of pcDNA1-Amp rat GRK2. For RBL-2H3 cells, 3 h prior to transfection the cells were washed and incubated in serum-free EMEM and then transiently transfected with 5 μg of CXCR1-GFP alone or along with 5 μg of pcDNA1-Amp rat β-arrestin 1-V53D or 5 μg of pCB1 rat dynamin I-K44A. Cell lines were transfected with LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) following the manufacturer's instructions. Following transfection the cells were maintained in fresh complete medium for 12 h to recover. For stable transfections, RBL-2H3 cells were grown to 80% confluence in 100-mm dishes (Falcon) and transfected with 10 μg of CXCR1-GFP in 30 μl of LipofectAMINE. Three days after transfection, cells were harvested, diluted, and replated in media supplemented with 1 mg/ml of Geneticin (Life Technologies, Inc.). The media was replaced every 4 days and stable transformants were isolated approximately 3 weeks after transfection. Clonal selection was confirmed by observation of cells under confocal microscope. RBL-2H3 cells were subcultured overnight in 6-well plates (1 × 106cells/well) in complete EMEM. Cells were washed twice with serum-free EMEM containing 1% bovine serum albumin and 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.2) and preincubated in the same media 1 h prior to125I-IL-8 treatment. Nontransfected RBL-2H3 and RBL-2H3 cells stably expressing CXCR1-GFP were stimulated with 50 nm125I-IL-8 (3000 Ci/mmol) at 4 and 37 °C for 45 min. The reaction was stopped with 1 ml of ice-cold PBS (pH 7.4) supplemented with 1% bovine serum albumin, the cells were washed with the same buffer three times and lysed in the lysis buffer (0.5% Nonidet P-40 and 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS) on ice for 30 min. After incubation, the total volume of the well was transferred onto 10% sucrose, PBS cushion and pelleted at 10,000 rpm for 20 min. Equal volumes of the supernatant (100 μl) were aliquoted and the amount of125I-IL-8 in supernatants was measured using a γ-counter (LKB/Wallac, Turku, Finland). Incorporation of nonspecific radioactivity was determined in supernatants of nontransfected RBL-2H3 cells. Cells were seeded as described for the “Radioligand Sequestration Assay,” washed, and preincubated in serum-free EMEM for 30 min. Nontransfected and RBL-2H3 cells stably expressing CXCR1-GFP were then stimulated with 50 nm IL-8 for 60 min at 37 °C. The reaction was terminated by placing 6-well plates on ice for 15 min. The amount of the secreted β-hexosaminidase was determined by incubating 50 μl of the overlaying medium with 50 μl of 1 mm p-(nitrophenyl)-N-acetyl-β-d-glucosamide in 0.1 m sodium citrate buffer (pH 4.5) at 37 °C for 1 h. At the end of the incubation 500 μl of a 0.1 mNa2CO3, NaHCO3 buffer (pH 4.5) was added and the absorbance was measured at 400 nm. Confocal microscopy was performed on a Bio-Rad MRC-600 confocal microscope under × 60 oil immersion objective, using a fluorescein isothiocyanate filter with the emission wavelength of 488 nm. Transiently transfected HEK 293 and RBL-2H3 cells were maintained in fresh complete media. For time course studies, the cells were treated with increasing concentrations of IL-8 (10, 25, 40, 50, and 75 nm) and events following agonist stimulation were observed in 5-min time intervals up to 90 min post-agonist stimulation. To determine the effect of de novo protein synthesis that occurs during the time of observation, RBL-2H3 cells transiently expressing CXCR1-GFP were first pretreated with cyclohexamide (10 ng/ml) for 45 min at 37 °C and then stimulated with 50 nm IL-8. Events following agonist treatment were observed under confocal microscope. For colocalization studies, RBL-2H3 cells transiently expressing CXCR1-GFP were stimulated with 50 nm IL-8 and labeled with Texas Red-transferrin conjugates (15 ng/ml) for 45 min at 37 °C. The reaction was terminated by washing the cells twice with ice-cold PBS (pH 7.4). The cells were fixed in 3.6% paraformaldehyde solution and confocal microscopy was performed as described above. HEK 293 cells transiently expressing CXCR1-GFP, CXCR1-GFP, and GRK2, and CXCR1-GFP, GRK2, and β-arrestin 1 were stimulated with 50 nm IL-8 for 45 min at 37 °C. The cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS (pH 7.4), removed from plates by gentle washing, and pelleted at 100 rpm for 10 min. The cell pellet was resuspended in 3 ml of buffer A (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 2 mm EDTA), incubated on ice for 30 min and homogenized using a Dounce homogenizer. Nuclei were removed by centrifugation at 200 rpm for 10 min. The supernatant was loaded on a stepwise sucrose cushion (35 and 5% sucrose in PBS) and centrifuged at 35,000 rpm for 90 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was removed and the 35% sucrose interface fraction containing endosomes (the light vesicular fraction) was collected, diluted in buffer A, and re-centrifuged at 35,000 rpm for 45 min at 4 °C. The pellets were resuspended in 100 μl of buffer A containing 2 × SDS sample buffer and 100 μg of each protein sample was loaded onto SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Protein levels in the whole cell lysates of HEK 293 and RBL-2H3 cells were determined using Bio-Rad protein assay (Richmond, CA) with bovine serum albumin as a standard. Expression levels of β-arrestin 1, β-arrestin 2, and GRK 2 in HEK 293 and RBL-2H3 cells were examined using specific polyclonal antisera as described previously (20Ferguson S.S.G. Downey III, W.E. Colapietro A.M. Barak L.S. Menard L. Caron M.G. Science. 1996; 271: 363-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (841) Google Scholar). Equivalent amounts (100 μg) of total cell protein were separated on a 10% polyacrylamide gel and transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad). The endogenous amounts of β-arrestin 1, β-arrestin 2, and GRK 2 were determined using anti-β-arrestin 2 and anti-GRK2 rabbit polyclonal sera at a dilution of 1:2500 and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibodies using the ECL system (Amersham) according to manufacturer's instructions. The amount of total β-arrestin 1, β-arrestin 2, and GRK 2 in RBL-2H3 cells were determined relative to their respective endogenous expression in HEK 293 cells. Amounts of CXCR1-GFP in the light vesicular subcellular fraction were determined using GFP-directed polyclonal antibody at dilution 1:1000 (CLONTECH). The relative membrane and cytosol luminosity was measured using SigmaScan Pro software. Data was statistically analyzed and plotted using Microsoft Excel software. Results are the average ± S.D. from three separate identical experiments. Cells transfected with CXCR1-GFP were positive for fusion protein expression within 24–36 h post-transfection as evidenced by robust membrane fluorescence in 15% of the RBL-2H3 and 70% of the HEK 293 cells visualized by confocal microscopy. In some transfected cells under nonstimulated conditions the CXCR1-GFP conjugate accumulated in the Golgi apparatus. Dose-response experiments indicated that maximal internalization of CXCR1-GFP occurred in a range of 40–75 nm IL-8. Over a 45-min time period, agonist-occupied CXCR1-GFP conjugates carried in specific membrane-associated vesicles, gradually translocated from the plasma membrane to the cytosol (Fig.1 A, i). Sequestration data acquired in RBL-2H3 cells showed a mean decrease of 61% in membrane luminosity and a 4.2-fold increase in cytosol fluorescence intensity in response to agonist stimulation over the 45-min time period (Fig. 1 B). Although there was a significant decrease of membrane luminosity in response to IL-8 treatment in RBL-2H3 cells transiently expressing the CXCR1-GFP construct not all of the expressed receptor was internalized 45 min post-stimulation. Pretreatment of RBL-2H3 cells transiently expressing the CXCR1-GFP fusion construct with cyclohexamide resulted in rapid CXCR1-GFP sequestration with no membrane fluorescence after 45 min post-stimulation, indicating that residual membrane fluorescence was due to de novo synthesis of CXCR1-GFP conjugates (data not shown). Unstimulated cells showed very little redistribution of CXCR1-GFP over the same time frame (Fig. 1 A, ii). Stably transfected CXCR1-GFP cells internalized 125I-IL-8 at 37 °C whereas at 4 °C, CXCR1-GFP transfected cells failed to internalize 125I-IL-8 (Fig. 1 C), indicating that internalization of CXCR1-GFP is an agonist and temperature-dependent process, which is similar to IL-8 receptor internalization observed in neutrophils (14Chuntharapai A. Kim K.J. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 2587-2594PubMed Google Scholar). To assess whether CXCR1-GFP transduced functional responses, we performed β-hexosaminidase assays on IL-8 stimulated and unstimulated CXCR1-GFP stably transfected cells. IL-8 stimulation of CXCR1-GFP transfected cells resulted in a 13.4% release of hexosaminidase compared with a 4.8% release from untransfected RBL-2H3 cells stimulated with IL-8 (Fig. 1 D). Stimulation with MCP-1, a CC chemokine that does not bind CXCR1, did not induce hexosaminidase release. These results show that CXCR1-GFP expressed in RBL-2H3 cells retains several features of the wild type receptor expressed in neutrophils; the receptor can transduce signals that result in granule release, undergo agonist-induced internalization, and sequester IL-8. In contrast to RBL-2H3 cells, HEK 293 cells transiently expressing the fusion protein construct did not internalize CXCR1-GFP when stimulated with IL-8 (Fig. 2 A, i). Since previous studies (30Aramori I. Zhang J. Ferguson S.S.G. Bieniasz P.D. Cullen B.R. Caron M.G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4606-4616Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that HEK 293 cells require increased expression of β-arrestins and GRKs for internalization of some GPCRs we explored whether co-expression of these two classes of molecules with CXCR1-GFP could restore agonist-induced receptor internalization in HEK 293 cells. Co-expression of CXCR1-GFP with either GRK2 (Fig. 2 A,ii) or β-arrestin 1 alone (Fig. 2 A, iii) in HEK 293 cells failed to facilitate IL-8 induced CXCR1-GFP internalization. However, expression of CXCR1-GFP with GRK2 and β-arrestins together resulted in IL-8-induced receptor internalization (Fig. 2 A, iv) showing a 3.5-fold increase of cytosolic fluorescence and a 60% decrease in membrane fluorescence (Fig. 2 B). The increased cytosolic receptor fluorescence was associated with increased receptor labeling of the intracellular vesicles. Similar results were obtained with β-arrestin 2, another closely related member of the β-arrestin family, again co-expressed with GRK2 and CXCR1-GFP (Fig. 2 A,v). These results suggest that both GRKs and β-arrestins are required for CXCR1 internalization. Western analysis of GRK2, β-arrestin 1, and β-arrestin 2 from HEK 293 cells and RBL-2H3 cells (Fig. 3, A and B), shows a substantial difference in β-arrestin 1, β-arrestin 2, and GRK2 expression between HEK 293 cells and RBL-2H3 cells. The higher levels of GRK2 and β-arrestin 2 expression in RBL-2H3 cells likely explain why CXCR1-GFP undergoes agonist-induced internalization in RBL-2H3 cells without the requirement for co-expression with GRKs or β-arrestins. To explore the role of β-arrestins in CXCR1-GFP internalization in RBL-2H3 cells we co-expressed CXCR1-GFP along with the β-arrestin 1-V53D dominant negative mutant in RBL-2H3 cells and stimulated with IL-8. In the presence of β-arrestin 1-V53D there was no redistribution of membrane fluorescence that followed IL-8 stimulation (Fig. 4, A,ii, and B). This was in sharp contrast to cells expressing CXCR1-GFP alone (Fig. 4 A, i) or cells expressing CXCR1-GFP and wild type β-arrestin 1 (data not shown), which showed marked receptor internalization following IL-8 stimulation. These observations complement the results obtained with HEK 293 cells and clearly demonstrate a role of β-arrestins in agonist-induced CXCR1 internalization. β-Arrestins are thought to act as scaffolding proteins in coupling GPCRs to CCVs (22Goodman O.B.

Agonist stimulation promotes the formation of CXCR1-GFP containing vesicles, which are pinched off from the plasma membrane and translocated into post-endocytic compartments (19Ferguson S.S.G. Barak L.S. Zhang J. Caron M.G. Can. J. Physiol. Pharmacol. 1996; 74: 1095-1110Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar, 24Zhang J. Barak L.S. Winkler K.E. Caron M.G. Ferguson S.S.G. J. Biol.

Chem. 1997; 273: 322-328Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (151) Google Scholar). The pinching or sealing off of the vesicles from the plasma membrane is dependent upon dynamin, a GTPase containing molecule (27Damke H. FEBS Lett. 1996; 389: 48-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 28Muhlberg A.B. Warnock D.E. Schmid S.L. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6676-6683Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 29Damke H. Baba T. Warnock D.E. Schmid S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 915-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (1034) Google Scholar). The dominant negative dynamin I-K44A mutant has been utilized in determining whether GPCRs are internalized via a dynamin-dependent pathway involving CCVs. We explored whether CXCR1 required dynamin for agonist-induced receptor internalization by co-expressing CXCR1-GFP with the dynamin I-K44A dominant negative mutant. The expression of dynamin I-K44A successfully blocked redistribution of CXCR1-GFP from the membrane to the cytosol. Vesicles formed in cells expressing the dynamin I-K44A mutant simply did not pinch off from the inner surface of the plasma membrane (Fig.4 A, iii, 45 min). These results indicate that agonist-induced internalization of CXCR1 occurs via CCVs and requires functional β-arrestins and dynamin molecules. To further investigate and confirm the identity of membrane-derived vesicles that translocate agonist-occupied CXCR1-GFP from the membrane to post-endocytic compartments, we labeled RBL-2H3 cells transiently expressing the receptor-GFP construct with a Texas Red-transferrin conjugate. Transferrin has been shown to undergo receptor-mediated endocytosis through CCVs upon binding to its cognate transferrin receptor and it has been described as a significant endosomal marker (37Hirst J. Robinson M.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1404: 173-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar, 38Ponka P. Beaumont C. Richardson D.R. Semin. Hematol. 1998; 35: 35-54PubMed Google Scholar). Agonist stimulation promoted colocalization of CXCR1-GFP and dye-labeled transferrin conjugate within CCVs (Fig. 5,ii) whereas unstimulated RBL-2H3 cells transiently expressing CXCR1-GFP did not display any colocalization (Fig. 5, i). These results were further supported by isolation of the light vesicular (endosomal) subcellular fraction from transiently transfected HEK 293 cells expressing CXCR1-GFP and CXCR1-GFP, GRK2, and β-arrestin 1 that were stimulated or unstimulated with IL-8. A 9.5-fold increase in CXCR1-GFP was found in the light vesicular subcellular fraction isolated from IL-8 stimulated HEK 293 cells expressing CXCR1-GFP, GRK2, and β-arrestin 1 (Fig. 6, lane 4 versus lane 2). However, only a modest increase (3-fold) in CXCR1-GFP was found in the light vesicular subcellular fraction isolated from HEK 293 cells in the absence of transfected GRK2 and β-arrestin 1 (Fig. 6, lane 3 versus lane 1) indicating that GRK2 and β-arrestin 1 substantially enhance the efficiency of CXCR1 internalization. Together these results support a model for CXCR1 sequestration via clathrin-coated pits that are regulated by GRKs, β-arrestins, and dynamin.Figure 6Presence of high CXCR1-GFP amounts in the endosomal subcellular fraction isolated from HEK 293 cells transiently expressing CXCR1-GFP, GRK2, and β-arrestin 1. A, amounts of CXCR1-GFP in light vesicular subcellular fractions isolated from HEK 293 cells transiently expressing CXCR1-GFP (lanes 1 and 3) and CXCR1-GFP, GRK2, and β-arrestin 1 (lanes 2 and4) pre- and post-stimulation were detected using GFP-directed polyclonal antibody.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Agonist-dependent regulation of chemokine receptor desensitization, internalization, and sequestration is an important mechanism for regulating leukocyte responsiveness to chemokine stimulation. Several studies have demonstrated that exposure of neutrophils to high concentrations of ELR-CXC chemokines renders the exposed neutrophils unresponsive to additional homologous chemokine stimulation. The refractory state of neutrophils following stimulation with high chemokine concentrations appears to be dependent upon desensitization, internalization, and sequestration of CXCR1, CXCR2, or both IL-8 receptor subtypes. Initial studies using radiolabeled IL-8 showed that IL-8-binding sites were rapidly lost from the neutrophil surface following stimulation of high concentrations of IL-8 (13Samanta A.K. Oppenheim J.J. Matsushima K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 183-189Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These initial studies were later confirmed by additional work utilizing monoclonal antibodies directed at the external domains of CXCR1 and CXCR2, that demonstrated a rapid loss of CXCR1 and CXCR2 following stimulation of neutrophils with high concentrations of ELR-CXC chemokines (14Chuntharapai A. Kim K.J. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 2587-2594PubMed Google Scholar, 33Khandaker M.H. Xu L. Rahimpour R. Mitchell G. DeVries M. Pickering J.G. Singhal S.K. Feldmann R.D. Kelvin D.J. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 1930-1938PubMed Google Scholar). Recent studies by Richardson et al. (32Richardson R.M. Ali H. Pridgen B.C. Haribabu B. Snyderman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10690-10695Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that phosphorylation of critical serine residues in the C-terminal region of CXCR1 is important for internalization of the receptor following agonist stimulation. Our work here compliments these observations by demonstrating that GRK2 is necessary for internalization of CXCR1 in HEK 293 cells (Fig. 2 A, iv and v). GRK2 is a serine-threonine kinase and a member of a multigene family whose members regulate GPCR function and internalization by phosphorylating serine/threonine residues located within the cytoplasmic regions of various receptors (17Premont T.P. Inglese J. Lefkowitz R.J. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 175-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). GRK2 is abundantly expressed in human peripheral leukocytes (Ref.31Chuang T.T. Sallese M. Ambrosini G. Paruti G. De Blasi A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 267: 6886-6892Google Scholar and data not shown) and may represent the endogenous kinase responsible for CXCR1 phosphorylation in neutrophils. Alternatively one of the other members of the GRK family (GRK1 and 3–5) may serve the same function in regulating phosphorylation of CXCR1 in neutrophils. CCR5, a member of the CC chemokine family of receptors (4Rollins B.J Blood. 1997; 90: 909-928Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), is preferentially phosphorylated by GRK2 and GRK3 indicating that GRK phosphorylation likely represents a common feature of both CC and CXC chemokine receptor regulation (30Aramori I. Zhang J. Ferguson S.S.G. Bieniasz P.D. Cullen B.R. Caron M.G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4606-4616Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). While GRK phosphorylation represents a critical step in regulating the desensitization and internalization of a subset of GPCRs, it is the β-arrestin proteins which facilitate the translocation of GPCRs from the plasma membrane to CCVs. Our data in the present study places β-arrestins as central regulators of CXCR1 internalization in response to agonist stimulation. This has been substantiated using two separate cells lines displaying two different phenotypes. HEK 293 cells which have low expression of β-arrestins require expression of β-arrestin 1 or β-arrestin 2 for agonist induced internalization. In sharp contrast to HEK 293 cells, RBL-2H3 cells express higher levels of β-arrestins and do not require additional expression of β-arrestins for CXCR1 internalization (Fig. 3 A). However, agonist-induced internalization of CXCR1 could be blocked by co-expressing the dominant negative β-arrestin 1-V53D mutant in RBL-2H3 cells (Fig. 4, A, ii, and B). These experiments provide strong evidence for β-arrestin regulation of agonist-induced CXCR1 internalization. Additionally, it is also clear from our studies that cellular factors other than GRK2 and β-arrestin are involved in the CXCR1 internalization machinery. Dynamins have been previously described as key proteins involved in the pinching off or sealing of CCVs from the membrane by stimulating GTP/GDP exchange which facilitates endocytic vesicle release (27Damke H. FEBS Lett. 1996; 389: 48-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 28Muhlberg A.B. Warnock D.E. Schmid S.L. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6676-6683Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). In contrast to the angiotensin II type 1A receptor, which is able to undergo dynamin-independent endocytosis (23Zhang J. Ferguson S.S.G. Barak L.S. Menard L. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18302-18305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar), our studies indicate that in the presence of dynamin I-K44A mutant, CCVs saturated with agonist-occupied receptor are not released from the membrane into the cytosolic compartment (Fig. 4 A, iii). Thus CXCR1 appears to undergo internalization and sequestration through a dynamin-driven and clathrin-dependent internalization pathway similar to several other GPCRs (20Ferguson S.S.G. Downey III, W.E. Colapietro A.M. Barak L.S. Menard L. Caron M.G. Science. 1996; 271: 363-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (841) Google Scholar, 26Kallal L. Gagnon A.W. Penn R.B. Benovic J.L. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4606-4616Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). This is supported by two additional pieces of data, agonist-promoted colocalization of transferrin and CXCR1-GFP in endosomal vesicles of RBL-2H3 cells (Fig. 5) and redistribution of CXCR1-GFP to the light vesicular fraction following IL-8 stimulation in HEK 293 cells transiently expressing CXCR1-GFP, GRK2, and β-arrestin 1 (Fig. 6). Even though CXCR1 and CXCR2 display 77% amino acid identity and elicit several similar functional responses they appear to have divergent pathways for internalization and recycling. Chuntharapai et al. (14Chuntharapai A. Kim K.J. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 2587-2594PubMed Google Scholar) showed that CXCR1 but not CXCR2 was recycled back to the plasma membrane following agonist-induced internalization. The mechanism for the divergence of CXCR1 and CXCR2 recycling is presently unknown, although differences in the C-terminal region may play a role in how the two proteins undergo intracellular trafficking (15Prado N.P. Suzuki H. Wilkinson N. Cousins B. Navarro J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19186-19190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In this context CXCR1 and CXCR2 may have differential requirements for β-arrestin proteins, which target CXCR1 and CXCR2 to different intracellular compartments. Preliminary data in our laboratory suggests that CXCR2 internalization is regulated differently from CXCR1 in HEK293 cells. The precise role of β-arrestins in regulating CXCR1 and CXCR2 recycling awaits further investigations. It is interesting to note that β-arrestins can function as signaling molecules since studies have implicated a role for β-arrestins in the activation of tyrosine kinases (36Luttrell L.M. Ferguson S.S.G. Daaka Y. Miller W.E. Maudsley S.R. Della Rocca G.J. Lin F.-T. Kawakatsu Owada K. Luttrell D.K. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Science. 1999; 283: 655-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (1255) Google Scholar). Thus, it is conceivable that some of the functional responses elicited by CXCR1 are due to signals transduced by β-arrestins coupling to the CXCR1 receptor. While there are at least five independent mechanisms for endocytotic internalization including the clathrin- and non-clathrin-coated pits, micropinocytosis, caveolae, and phagocytosis, GPCRs appear to utilize only two: clathrin-dependent and dynamin-independent endocytotic pathways (23Zhang J.

We present here a previously undescribed model for CXCR1 chemokine receptor internalization whereby we have demonstrated that GRK2, β-arrestin, and dynamin are necessary molecules for the entry of CXCR1 into the cell. Upon IL-8 binding, GRK2 phosphorylates C-terminal serine-threonine residues on CXCR1 allowing β-arrestins to couple phosphorylated receptor to cytoplasmic complexes containing clathrin. Furthermore, our data demonstrates that dynamin is required to pinch off CCVs containing CXCR1 and allow vesicular entry of the activated receptor into the cell. The importance of chemokine receptor internalization may be to serve as a mechanism of reducing the chemotactic activity of leukocytes under conditions of high exposure to inflammatory stimuli thereby preventing their continued migration and departure from the site of inflammation. These studies provide insight into the biochemical factors involved in chemokine receptor entry into the cell and thus may further our understanding of the inflammatory process. We thank Dr. Bruce M. Gill for critical review of this paper and Anne Leaist for excellent technical assistance."

We found that the 1α,25-lactone analogues (23S)-25-dehydro-1α-hydroxyvitamin-D3-26,23-lactone (TEI-9647), and (23R)-25-dehydro-1α-hydroxyvitamin-D3-26,23-lactone (TEI-9648) bound much more strongly to the VDR than the natural (23S,25R)-1α,25(OH)2D3-26,23-lactone, but did not induce cell differentiation even at high concentrations (10−6m). Intriguingly, the differentiation of HL-60 cells induced by 1α,25(OH)2D3 was inhibited by either TEI-9647 or TEI-9648 but not by the natural lactone. In contrast, retinoic acid or 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate-induced HL-60 cell differentiation was not blocked by TEI-9647 or TEI-9648. In separate studies, TEI-9647 (10−7m) was found to be an effective antagonist of both 1α,25(OH)2D3(10−8m) mediated induction of p21WAF1,CIP1 in HL-60 cells and activation of the luciferase reporter assay in COS-7 cells transfected with cDNA containing the DRE of the rat 25(OH)D3-24-hydroxylase gene and cDNA of the human VDR. Collectively the results strongly suggest that our novel 1α,25-lactone analogues, TEI-9647 and TEI-9648, are specific antagonists of 1α,25(OH)2D3 action, specifically VDR/DRE-mediated genomic action.

To better understand the interactions of the ligand/VDR interacting with a vitamin D-responsive element (DRE) located on the promoter of regulated genes, it would be helpful to identify analogues of 1α,25(OH)2D3 that can modulate or antagonize these interactions. However, to date the only known antagonist of 1α,25(OH)2D3 is the analogue 1β,25(OH)2D3, which blocks rapid nongenomic responses but is without effect on the classical nuclear VDR (15Norman A.W.

They reported that the naturally occurring (23S, 25R)-1α,25(OH)2D3-26,23-lactone has unique biological features in comparison with 1α,25(OH)2D3. First of all, the VDR binding affinity of the naturally occurring 1α,25-lactone is very low (17Ishizuka S. Ishimoto S. Norman A.W. J.

Normally proliferating human promyelocytic leukemia cells (HL-60) show promyelocytic features and no differentiated functions (for example, nitro blue tetrazolium (NBT)-reducing activity, monocyte-specific esterase activity, and cell surface marker expression, used as differentiation markers) are detected. However, their differentiation can be induced in vitro by various compounds including all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), 9-cis-retinoic acid (9-cis-RA) (into granulocytes), 1α,25(OH)2D3, or 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) (into monocyte/macrophages) (4Abe E.

It is well known that HL-60 cells have the VDR, and its cell differentiation is induced by 1α,25(OH)2D3 through a VDR/DRE-mediated pathway (29Lee Y. Inaba M. DeLuca H.F. Mellon W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13701-13705Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); as such this is a useful system to study genomic actions of 1α,25(OH)2D3 and related analogues. We have recently synthesized various analogues of 1α,25-lactone to investigate which functionality of the 1α,25-lactone structure is responsible for its unique biological functions. In this study we report the discovery of the antagonistic biological activities of two novel 1α,25-lactone analogues ((23S)-25-dehydro-1α(OH)D3-26,23-lactone) (TEI-9647) and ((23S)-25-dehydro-1α(OH)D3-26,23-lactone) (TEI-9648). These analogues were found to block both 1α,25(OH)2D3-mediated HL-60 cell differentiation and also activation of the luciferase reporter in COS-7 cells that had been transfected with the cDNA containing the DRE of the rat 25(OH)D3-24-hydroxylase gene and cDNA of the human VDR. 25-Hydroxyvitamin D3(25(OH)D3), 1α,25(OH)2D3, 1β,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3(1β,25(OH)2D3), 1α,25(OH)2D3-26,23-lactone, and its analogues (TEI-9616, TEI-9647, and TEI-9648) were synthesized in our laboratory as described previously (20Ishizuka S.

The 20-epi-22-oxa-24a,26a,27a-trihomo-1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (KH-1060) was synthesized in our laboratory. TPA and 9-cis-RA were purchased from Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd. (Osaka, Japan). ATRA was obtained from Sigma. NBT was purchased from Tokyo Kasei Kogyo Co. Ltd. (Tokyo, Japan). May-Grünwald-Giemsa solution, Kernechrot solution and esterase staining kit were obtained from Muto Pure Chemicals Co., Ltd. (Tokyo, Japan). Anti-CD11b antibody (PE conjugated anti-human CD11b antibody) and anti-CD71 antibody (fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-human CD71 antibody) were purchased from Pharmingen (San Diego, CA). [26,27-methyl-3H]1α,25(OH)2D3(specific activity, 179 Ci/mmol) and [26,27-methyl-3H]25(OH)D3(specific activity, 17 Ci/mmol) were purchased from Amersham International plc (Little Chalfont, Buckinghamshire, United Kingdom). [1-3H]1α,25(OH)2D3 (specific activity, 16.2 Ci/mmol) was synthesized in our laboratory. HL-60 cells were obtained from Japanese Cancer Research Resources Bank. Cells were passaged twice a week to maintain exponential proliferating phase. RPMI 1640 (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Bioserum, lot number 01307-01) was used as culture medium. The monkey kidney epithelial cell line, COS-7, was maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (Nissui Pharmaceutical Co., Tokyo) with 10% dextran-charcoal-stripped fetal bovine serum (JRH Bioscience, Dexton, KS). A competitive receptor binding assay for 1α,25(OH)2D3 and 1α,25-lactone analogues was performed using VDR from HL-60 cells as described previously (31Eisman J.A. Hamstra A.J. Kream B.E. DeLuca F.H.

Exponentially proliferating HL-60 cells were disrupted by sonication in TEDK buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1.5 mm EDTA, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 300 mm KCl). After ultracentrifugation at 105,000 ×g for 60 min, supernatant was collected and used as VDR fraction. [26,27-methyl-3H]1α,25(OH)2D3(specific activity, 179 Ci/mmol, 15,000 dpm, 15.7 pg) and various amounts of 1α,25-lactone analogues to be tested were dissolved in 50 ml of absolute ethanol in 12 × 75-mm polypropylene tubes (Sarstedt, Nümbrecht, Germany). 1 ml of the HL-60 cell VDR fraction and 1 mg of gelatin were added to each tube in an ice bath. The assay tubes were incubated in a shaking water bath for 1 h at 25 °C and then chilled in an ice bath. 1 ml of 40% polyethylene glycol 6000 in distilled water was added to each tube, which was then mixed vigorously and centrifuged at 2,260 × g for 60 min at 4 °C. After the supernatant was decanted, the bottom of the tube containing the pellet was cut off into a scintillation vial containing 10 ml of dioxane-based scintillation fluid consisting of 10% naphthalene and 0.5% Omnifluor (DuPont) in 1,4-dioxane. The radioactivity was measured with Beckman liquid scintillation counter (model LS6500) using an external standard. In the assay, using chick intestinal VDR, 0.2 mg of protein/ml of chick VDR was used instead of HL-60 cell VDR fraction. A competitive binding assay of DBP in FBS for 25(OH)D3 and 1α,25-lactone analogues was performed as described previously (33Honda A. Nakashima N. Mori Y. Katsumata T. Ishizuka S. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1992; 41: 109-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Cell morphology, NBT-reducing activity and monocytic cell-specific esterase (α-naphthylbutyrate (α-NB) used as a substrate) activity was used as cell differentiation markers. HL-60 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS. Exponentially proliferating cells were collected, suspended in fresh medium, and seeded in culture vessels. 24-well culture plates (Falcon, Becton Dickinson and Co., Franklin Lakes, NJ) were used. Cell concentration at seeding was adjusted to 2 × 104 cells/ml and seeding volume was 1 ml/well. 1α,25(OH)2D3 and 1α,25-lactone analogues dissolved in ethanol were added to the culture medium at 0.1% volume and cultured with cells for 4 days at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2/air without medium change. The same amount of vehicle was added to the control culture. NBT reduction assay was performed according to the method of Collins et al. (34Collins S.J. Ruscetti F.W. Gallagher R.E. Gallo R.C. J. Exp. Med. 1979; 149: 969-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were collected and washed with PBS. After washing, cells were suspended in serum-free medium, and NBT/TPA solution (dissolved in PBS) was added. Final concentrations of NBT and TPA were 0.1% and 100 ng/ml, respectively. Then, cell suspensions were incubated at 37 °C for 25 min. After incubation, cells were collected by centrifugation and resuspended in FBS. Cytospin smears were prepared, and the counterstaining of nucleus was done with Kernechrot solution. At least 500 cells per preparation were observed. α-NB esterase activity was measured as follows: cell seeding, treatment, and collection were performed according to the method described above. Cells were resuspended in FBS and then cytospin smears were prepared. Esterase activity of cells was examined after staining with an esterase staining kit. For cell morphology examination, cytospin smears were stained with May-Grünwald-Giemsa solution. Cells were treated with compounds and collected according to the same methods described above. Collected cells were suspended in PBS, and antibodies were added. After incubation on ice for 30 min, cells were collected and washed with PBS. Cells were resuspended in PBS, and the cell surface marker expression was measured with fluorescent-activated cell sorter (FACS) (Becton Dickinson and Co.). RNA of HL-60 cells was extracted and purified using CLONsep total RNA isolation kit (CLONTECHLaboratories, Inc., Palo Alto, CA). 2 mg of total RNA were reverse-transcribed with 50 units of murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Takara Biomedicals, Shiga, Japan) in 20 ml containing 1 mm deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates, 5 mmMgCl2, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 50 mm KCl, 20 units of RNase inhibitor (RNasin, Promega Corp., Madison, WI), 2.5 mm oligo(dT) primer. Samples were diluted to 100 ml with buffer containing 2 mm MgCl2, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 50 mm KCl. 100 pmol of each primer and 2.5 units Taq DNA polymerase (Takara Biomedicals, Shiga, Japan) were added, and samples were covered with mineral oil and then subjected to PCR amplification in a programmed thermal cycler. PCR primer was selected with OLIGOTM(National Bioscience), referring to the mRNA sequence registered in GenBankTM. For p21WAF1,CIP1 amplification, the PCR primers were 5′ to 3′ AGGAGGCCCGTGAGCGATGGAAC and ACAAGTGGGGAGGAGGAAGTAGC. PCR cycles were as follows: 1 min at 94 °C for denaturation, 1 min at 59 °C for annealing, 1 min at 72 °C for polymerization, 26 cycles. For β-actin amplification, the PCR primers were 5′ to 3′ GATATCGCCGCGCTCGTCGTCGAG and CAGGAAGGAAGGCTGGAAGAGTGC. PCR cycles were as follows: 1 min at 94 °C for denaturation, 1 min at 61 °C for annealing, 1 min at 72 °C for polymerization, 20 cycles. PCR products were analyzed by 2% agarose gel electrophoresis (about 400-base pair product was obtained in p21WAF1,CIP1 PCR and about 800-base pair product was obtained in β-actin PCR). The promoter region of the rat 24-hydroxylase gene (−291/+9), which also contains two DREs (a gift from Dr. Y. Ohyama, Hiroshima University, Japan) (35Ohyama Y. Ozono K. Uchida M. Yoshimura M.

The DNA sequences of these plasmids were confirmed using an ABI 373A DNA sequencer (PE Applied Biosystems, Tokyo, Japan). The luciferase activities of the cell lysates were measured with a luciferase assay kit (Toyo Ink Co. Ltd.) according to the manufacturer's manual. Transactivation measured by luciferase activities was standardized by the galactosidase activities of the same cells determined by a β-galactosidase enzyme assay system (Promega). These plasmids, together with the hVDR expression vector, pSG5hVDR (a gift from Dr. M. R. Haussler, University of Arizona) were introduced into cells by DEAE-dextran. 16 h after the transfection, 10−8m1α,25(OH)2D3, 10−7mTEI-9647 or both, or vehicle was added. 48 h after the addition, cells were harvested in the cell lysate solution provided by luciferase assay kit (Toyo Ink). Luciferase activity was adjusted by internal β-galactosidase activity. HL-60 cells (106 cells/ml in a 100 mm-diameter dish, 10 ml) were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS and 10−8m[1-3H]1α,25(OH)2D3 (specific activity 16.2 Ci/mmol, 1.62 μCi), and 10−7m1α,25-lactone analogues, and then cultured for the indicated time. [1-3H]1α,25(OH)2D3 metabolites were extracted with chloroform-methanol (1:1, v/v), and analyzed using Zorbax Sil column (4.6 × 250-mm) eluted with 15% isopropanol inn-hexane at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Fractions were collected each 30 s for 50 min. Radioactivity in the effluent mixed with 8 ml of toluene-based scintillation fluid was measured by a Beckman model LS6500 liquid scintillation counter. On this system standard 1α,25(OH)2D3, 24-oxo-1α,25(OH)2D3, 24,25,26,27-tetranor-1α,25(OH)2D3, (23S,25R)-1α,25(OH)2D3-26,23-lactone and 1α,24R,25(OH)3D3 eluted at 16.3, 19.3, 23.8, 29.0, and 29.3 min, respectively. Fig. 1 indicates the structures of the naturally occurring 1α,25-lactone and its three analogues. TEI-9616 is a 25-dehydroxylated version of the naturally occurring (23S,25R)-1α,25(OH)2D3-26,23-lactone. TEI-9647 and TEI-9648 are both 25-dehydrated lactones of the (23S,25R)- and (23R,25R)-1α,25(OH)2D3-26,23-lactone, respectively. Formally, TEI-9647 and TEI-9648 are 23-diastereoisomers of one another. The receptor binding affinities of 1α,25-lactone and its analogues to VDR prepared from HL-60 cells are shown in Fig.2 and summarized in TableI. The VDR binding affinities of TEI-9647 and TEI-9648 were 10 and 8%, respectively, as compared with 1α,25(OH)2D3. Their binding affinities to VDR of HL-60 cells were 120–140 times stronger than that of the naturally occurring (23S,25R)-1α,25(OH)2D3-26,23-lactone. In contrast, the binding affinities of TEI-9616 and the naturally occurring (23S,25R)-1α,25(OH)2D3-26,23-lactone to the VDR of HL-60 cells were about 237 (0.48%) and 1,400 (0.07%) times weaker than that of 1α,25(OH)2D3. Similar results were obtained using chick intestinal VDR.Table IBiological characteristics of 1α,25(OH)2D3-26,23-lactone analogsAssayRelative activity1α,25(OH)2D3TEI-9616TEI-9647TEI-9648(23S,25R)-1α,25(OH)2D3-26,23-lactoneaThis is a naturally occurring vitamin D metabolite (18).

(23S,25R)-1α,25(OH)2D3-26,23-lactone bound to the plasma DBP 6.2 times stronger than 1α,25(OH)2D3. However, the DBP binding affinities of TEI-9616, TEI-9647, and TEI-9648 are 2.4, 9.3, and 2.5%, respectively, as compared with 1α,25(OH)2D3(Table I). Our preliminary data indicated that the natural (23S,25R)-1α,25(OH)2D3-26,23-lactone has very weak HL-60 cell differentiation inducing activity (36Yoshida M. Ishizuka S. Hoshi A. J. Pharm. Dyn. 1984; 7: 962-968Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). From this data and results of the VDR and DBP affinity studies, we predicted that the 1α,25-lactone analogues might be more potent in HL-60 cell differentiation than the natural (23S,25R)-1α,25(OH)2D3-26,23-lactone. We did find that TEI-9616 is a more potent HL-60 cell differentiation agent than the natural (23S,25R)-1α,25(OH)2D3-26,23-lactone; in contrast, neither TEI-9647 nor TEI-9648 could induce cell differentiation even after treatment at 10−6m (data not presented). In agreement with other studies (37Zhou J.Y. Norman A.W. Lubbert M. Collins E.D. Uskokovic M.R. Koeffler H.P. Blood. 1989; 74: 82-93Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), concentrations of 10−9 to 10−7m1α,25(OH)2D3 dose dependently induced differentiation of HL-60 cells; a concentration of 10−8m of 1α,25(OH)2D3 differentiated >50% of the cells into NBT-reducing activity positive cells during a 96-h culture period (data not presented). Fig.3 presents the morphological and histocytochemical changes in HL-60 cells after treatment with TEI-9647 or TEI-9648 in the absence or presence of 10−8m 1α,25(OH)2D3. Although undifferentiated HL-60 cells showed promyelocytic features, cells differentiated by 1α,25(OH)2D3 displayed a monocytic appearance (Fig. 3 A). However, TEI-9647 and TEI-9648 did not mediate the appearance of any monocyte-like morphological changes even after treatment at 10−6m for 96 h. Surprisingly, the HL-60 cell morphological changes induced by 10−8m1α,25(OH)2D3 were markedly inhibited in the presence of 10−6m TEI-9647 or TEI-9648 (Fig.3 A). Monocytic differentiation markers, such as NBT-reducing activity and α-NB esterase activity, are known to be up-regulated by 1α,25(OH)2D3. Therefore, we examined the effect of TEI-9647 and TEI-9648 to mediate the up-regulation of differentiation markers induced by 1α,25(OH)2D3. TEI-9647 or TEI-9648 alone could not induce activation of NBT-reducing activity or α-NB esterase activity. In contrast, they both markedly suppressed the up-regulation induced by 1α,25(OH)2D3 (Fig. 3, Band C). Next we examined separately the inhibitory effects of TEI-9647 and TEI-9648 on 1α,25(OH)2D3 action in more detail using NBT-reducing activity as a cell differentiation marker. TEI-9647 dose dependently inhibited the cell differentiation induced by 10−8m 1α,25(OH)2D3(Fig. 4 A); it caused 40% suppression at 10−9m and almost complete inhibition was observed at 10−7m. Complete suppression was observed at 10−6m TEI-9647. TEI-9648 showed a similar dose-dependent response curve, but its suppressive effect was consistently weaker than that of TEI-9647 (Fig. 4 B). In contrast, neither the naturally occurring (23S,25R)-1α,25(OH)2D3-26,23-lactone nor TEI-9616 displayed any ability to inhibit HL-60 cell differentiation, even at 10−6m (data not presented). A particularly potent analogue of 1α,25(OH)2D3 is KH-1060, which has been shown to have a 5,000–10,000-fold more potent cell differentiating activity than 1α,25(OH)2D3 (3Bouillon R. Okamura W.H. Norman A.W. Endocr. Rev. 1995; 16: 200-257Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 38Binderup L. Latini S. Binderup E. Bretting C. Calverley M. Hansen K. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1991; 42: 1569-1575Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.5, both TEI-9647 and TEI-9648 could dose dependently (10−8-10−6m) antagonize the HL-60 cell differentiating actions of KH-1060 (3 × 10−11m). Fig. 6 shows the consequences of TEI-9647 and TEI-9648 on the changes of cell surface marker expression. In HL-60 cells, 1α,25(OH)2D3 simultaneously mediates an increase in CD11b expression and a decrease in CD71 expression. Neither TEI-9647 nor TEI-9648 alone could induce such changes of cell surface marker expression (Fig. 6, left side). In contrast, TEI-9647 and TEI-9648 dose dependently blocked the reciprocal changes of CD11b and CD71 expression associated with HL-60 cell differentiation induced by 1α,25-(OH)2D3. TEI-9647 completely blocked the increase in CD11b and the decrease in CD71 expression at 10−7m (Fig. 6). Similar result"

The clustering of Fas receptor, FADD, and procaspase-8, termed death-inducing signaling complex, is essential for Fas-mediated apoptosis and caspase-8 activation (6Kischkel F.C. Hellbardt S.

In the death-inducing signaling complex formation, FADD mediates signals from Fas receptor to procaspase-8 with its C-terminal DD and N-terminal DED. FADD also participates in signaling other members of the TNFR family. FADD binds to TNFR1-associated death domain protein (TRADD), which interacts with the stimulated TNFR1 in TNF-mediated apoptosis (8Hsu H. Shu H.B. Pan M.G. Goeddel D.V.

Among the Fas-binding proteins, FADD is the only protein found in the death-inducing signaling complex (6Kischkel F.C. Hellbardt S. Behrmann I. Germer M. Pawlita M. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5579-5588Crossref PubMed Scopus (1792) Google Scholar) and has shown to be essentialin vivo by use of FADD-deficient cells that are completely resistant to Fas-mediated apoptosis (15Yeh W.C.

The downstream signal transduction of Fas- or TNF-mediated apoptosis is blocked by the N-terminal-truncated FADD that lacks death effector domain (18Chinnaiyan A.M. Tepper C.G. Seldin M.F.

FADD exists in the cytoplasm of normal cells, but it does not induce cell death except at a high concentration (1Chinnaiyan A.M. O'Rourke K. Tewari M. Dixit V.M. Cell. 1995; 81: 505-512Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2165) Google Scholar). This suggests that the signal transduction of FADD be triggered by interactions of death domains of Fas and FADD, possibly converting FADD into a form capable of recruiting procaspase-8. However, the mechanism of a signal transduction by FADD is not yet clear. To understand the mechanism of FADD-mediated signal transduction, we determined the solution structure of a murine FADD (2Zhang J. Winoto A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2756-2763Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) death domain (FADD-DD), carried out site-directed mutageneses, and analyzed the effect of mutagenesis on the binding affinity of FADD-DD for Fas-DD to map an interaction site of death domains. Thus far, the structures of Fas-DD (19Huang B. Eberstadt M. Olejniczak E.T. Meadows R.P. Fesik S.W. Nature. 1996; 384: 638-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar), FADD-DED (20Eberstadt M.

Matsuo H. Duan H. Wagner G. Cell. 1998; 94: 171-180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar) has been determined and known to have similar global folds. It has been suggested that the interactions between DDs or caspase recruitment domains are electrostatic (19Huang B. Eberstadt M. Olejniczak E.T. Meadows R.P. Fesik S.W. Nature. 1996; 384: 638-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar) (21Chou J.J. Matsuo H. Duan H. Wagner G. Cell. 1998; 94: 171-180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar), whereas those between DEDs are hydrophobic (20Eberstadt M. Huang B. Chen Z. Meadows R.P. Ng S.C. Zheng L. Lenardo M.J. Fesik S.W. Nature. 1998; 392: 941-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). But the mode of interactions has not been clear because the information about the counter-interacting domain has not been available. By determining structure of FADD-DD, we now are able to propose a model for the death domain interactions of Fas and FADD based on the structures of Fas-DD (19Huang B. Eberstadt M. Olejniczak E.T. Meadows R.P. Fesik S.W. Nature. 1996; 384: 638-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar), FADD-DD, and mutagensis experiments. Recombinant FADD was prepared from the murine FADD gene subcloned into an expression vector pET3d (Novagen) in Escherichia coli strain BL21 (DE3). When cell growth is reached at the logarithmic phase at 37 °C, protein expression was induced by adding 0.4 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 3 h. The harvested cell paste was disrupted by a sonicator in a lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and ammonium sulfate up to 30% was added to the soluble fraction of the cell extract. The precipitant was collected by centrifugation and dialyzed overnight at pH 4.0 and further purified by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography using a C8 Vydac column. Purified FADD was subjected to proteolytic digestion for 2 h at 15 °C by adding subtilisin of one-hundredth of FADD in phosphate buffer at pH 8.0. The molecular weight and N-terminal amino acid sequence of the resistant fragments were analyzed, and the corresponding DNA fragments were subcloned into a pET15b expression vector. The C-terminal fragment of FADD protein (FADD-DD) was expressed in E. coli strain BL21 (DE3) by inducing with 0.4 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 3 h at 28 °C. The protein was purified by an affinity chromatography with nickel nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose column (Qiagen). The polyhistidine tag was removed by thrombin and further purified by gel filtration in ammonium acetate buffer at pH 4.0. Purified protein that has an N-terminal cloning artifact of Gly-Ser-His-Met was lyophilized and stored at −20 °C. A uniformly 15N and/or13C -labeled protein was prepared from cells grown in M9 minimal medium containing 1 g of15NH4Cl/liter and/or 2.0 g of [U-13C]glucose/liter. NMR samples were prepared by dissolving about 10 mg of protein in 0.5 ml of 50 mm sodium acetate buffer composed of either 90% H2O, 10%2H2O, or 99.9% 2H2O, and the pH was adjusted to 4.00 ± 0.05 (glass electrode, uncorrected) with concentrated NaO2H. The heteronuclear NMR experiments were carried out with a 15N and/or 13C-labeled sample in 90% H2O, 10% 2H2O using Varian UNITYplus 600 (in Advanced Analysis Center in KIST) or Inova 500 (University of Alberta) spectrometers at 30 °C. The protein concentration was about 2 mm. Once FADD-DD protein is dissolved in water for more than a week, NMR signal begins to lose its intensity, indicating the tendency of aggregation. So all experiments were carried out within a week after dissolution. Deuterium exchange of amide protons in FADD-DD was initiated by dissolving lyophilized sample in 2H2O, and two-dimensional1H-15N HSQC spectra were recorded at 20 °C, pH 4.0. After 1 h at 20 °C, the temperature was increased to 30 °C, and spectra were acquired. According to cross-peaks intensity remaining in each spectrum, exchange rates were divided into four groups. Two-dimensional 1H-13C constant time-HSQC, three-dimensional 1H-15N NOESY-HSQC,1H-15N TOCSY-HSQC (22Zhang O. Kay L.E. Olivier J.P. Forman-Kay J.D. J. Biomol.

Starting with identifications of 15N and HN chemical shifts in1H-15N HSQC, spin systems were partly identified in 1H-15N TOCSY-HSQC, and the sequential assignments of each amino acid were made using1H-15N NOESY-HSQC. The 13C chemical shifts of each amino acid were assigned in1H-13C CT-HSQC and HCCH-TOCSY and verified by HNCACB and CBCA(CO)NH. Stereospecific assignments of Hβ protons, and methyl groups of Val and Leu were based on the intensity of HN-Hβ or HN-Hγ cross-peaks in 1H-15N TOCSY-HSQC and1H-15N NOESY-HSQC spectra (28Clore G.M. Bax A. Gronenborn A.M. J. Biomol. NMR. 1991; 1: 13-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) and NOE intensity of the stereospecifically assigned Hβ protons to δ-methyl protons of Leu. NOE distance restraints were derived from three-dimensional 1H-15N NOESY-HSQC,13C-,15N-edited NOESY, and 1H NOESY spectra in 2H2O, all with a mixing time of 75 or 150 ms. Only cross-peaks observed in 75 ms mixing time were used for the initial structure calculation to exclude a spin diffusion artifact. All NOE cross-peaks were assigned using a program PIPP. The NOE intensity was converted into three groups of classes (1.8–2.7, 1.8–3.5, 1.8–5.0), and pseudo-atom corrections were made appropriately (29Wüthrich K. Billeter M. Braun W. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 169: 949-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (1007) Google Scholar). The scalar coupling constant of the α-proton to the amide proton was obtained from the HNHA experiments. The backbone torsion angle φ was restrained to −85 to −25 for3JHNHα < 5.5 Hz, −60 to −180 for3JHNHα 7–8 Hz, −70 to −170 for3JHNHα 8–9 Hz, and −90 to −150 for3JHNHα > 9 Hz. The ψ torsion angles of helix region were restrained to −70 to −10. The side chain torsion angles χ1 were restrained based on cross-peak intensities deduced from 1H-15N HSQC-TOCSY and13C-, 15N-edited NOESY spectra. Additional backbone H-bond restraints were given where secondary structures were indicated based on NOE connectivity. For each hydrogen bond, two restraints (rNH-O, 1.7–2.3; rN-O, 2.5–3.3) were used. Additionally, J-coupling constants (30Garrett D.S. Kuszewski J. Hancock T.J. Lodi P.J. Vuister G.W. Gronenborn A.M. Clore G.M. J. Magn. Reson. Ser. B. 1994; 104: 99-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), carbon chemical shifts of Cα and Cβ resonances (31Kuszewski J. Qin J. Gronenborn A.M. Clore G.M. J. Magn. Reson. Ser.

Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 1067-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar) (33Kuszewski J. Gronenborn A.M. Clore G.M. J. Magn. Reson. 1997; 125: 171-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) were directly included in the simulated annealing protocol during refinement. At first, mutation sites were selected based on the structure of Fas death domain (19Huang B. Eberstadt M. Olejniczak E.T. Meadows R.P. Fesik S.W. Nature. 1996; 384: 638-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar), but further mutations were made when an initial structure of FADD-DD was calculated. The mutation sites are in helices α2 and α3 and the connecting loop between them. Charged residues in α2 and α3 were replaced by Ala, and hydrophobic residues in the connecting loop were replaced by Asn similar to the lpr mutant of Fas. All mutants were single amino acid substitutions and purified as wild type FADD-DD described above. For the binding affinity measurements, human Fas-DD (Gly192-Ser304) was expressed inE. coli and purified. The purified Fas-DD was coupled to sensor chip CM5 by amine coupling at pH 4.0 to get about 2,600 response units. In the same way, FADD was attached to a CM5 chip to have about 6,000 response units to measure self-association between FADD-DD and FADD. A flow of purified FADD-DD in HBS buffer (10 mmHEPES, pH 7.4, containing 150 mm NaCl, 3.4 mmEDTA, and 0.05% surfactant P20) at 5 different concentrations between 55 to 880 nm was maintained over the protein-coupled chip for 2 min to record association at the flow rate of 20 μl/min. The bound FADD-DD was dissociated by passing HBS buffer without FADD-DD for the next 6 min at the same flow rate. Binding constants were obtained by BIAevaluation software (Biocore AB) using obtained sensorgrams. The degree of self-association was estimated based on the resonance signal obtained for 2 min of association. All binding experiments were performed at 25 °C. All binding experiments were carried out with BIAcore 2000, and the N-terminal amino acid sequence of the purified protein was determined at Korea Basic Science Institute (KBSI) in Seoul. The structure of FADD-DD (residues 89–183) is well defined by 1,253 experimentally derived NOEs, 174 dihedral angle restraints, 50 hydrogen bonds, 84 coupling constants, and 83 additional chemical shifts (TableI). FADD-DD shown in Fig.1 consists of 6 helices similar to other death domains of Fas (19Huang B. Eberstadt M. Olejniczak E.T. Meadows R.P. Fesik S.W. Nature. 1996; 384: 638-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar) and the p75 neurotrophin receptor (34Liepinsh E. Ilag L.L. Otting G. Ibanez C.F. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4999-5005Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Helices α1 and α2 are interlocked with helices α4 and α5, and helices α3 and α6 are located on each side. Helix α6 is well packed against the interlocked helices, but α3 is more loosely associated. Hydrophobic residues from α1, α2, α4, α5, and α6 form the hydrophobic core of the protein, but α3 is rather isolated from the others (Fig. 1). Most hydrophobic residues are well buried except for a few residues in α1 and α6. Helix α2 has mostly positively charged residues (Arg110, Lys113, Arg114, Arg117, and Lys120) on the surface, whereas α3 has many negatively charged residues (Glu123, Asp127, Glu130, and Glu131). Helices α2 and α3 form contiguous exposed charged surfaces with opposite polarity (Fig. 4). Helix α4 is relatively long compared with other helices, with a bend in the middle, and a 310 helical turn is found between α4 and α5. Helices α1 and α6 have mostly negatively charged residues and a few hydrophobic residues on the surface (Fig. 1).Table ISummary of structural restraints derived from experimental measurements and structural statistics for the 20 final structuresNOE distance restraintsIntra-residual492Sequential291Medium-range (1 < ‖i − j‖ ≤ 4)257Long-range (‖i − j‖ ≥ 5)213Hydrogen bonds2∗50aFor each hydrogen bond, two distance restraints are used, rHN-O 1.7–2.3 and rN-O 2.5–3.3.

Positively charged residues are colored in blue, negatively charged residues are colored inred, and two hydrophobic residues (Leu119, Val121) are colored in sky blue. Only residues of FADD-DD studied by mutations are labeled. Residues with marginal effect on binding to Fas-DD are labeled in green. Val121 is the corresponding residue at the position oflpr mutant in Fas. Helices α2 and α3 in FADD-DD and Fas-DD have the same charge distribution, suggesting that interaction between two death domains is in antiparallel pattern.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) When hydrogen exchange rates of the backbone NHs were measured and classified into four classes by their exchange rates, each helix showed a different internal flexibility (Figs. 1 and 3). Helix α3 is the most flexible of all, and α5 is the least. Helix α5 in p75ICD (34Liepinsh E. Ilag L.L. Otting G. Ibanez C.F. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4999-5005Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar) is also reported to be better protected from exchange compared with other helices, indicating that the organization of hydrophobic core of death domains is similar. Residues involved in the hydrophobic core formation are distributed over α1, α2, α4, α5, and α6, as are the slowly exchanging protons. The backbone NHs of the residues at the beginning of the helices, loop regions, and some exposed sides of the helices are exchanged in 30 min at 20 °C. The φ helix hydrogen bonds generally found at the end of the helices (35Kabsch W. Sander C. Biopolymers. 1983; 22: 2577-2637Crossref PubMed Scopus (12421) Google Scholar) are observed in FADD-DD, and the exchange rates of these hydrogen-bonded backbone NHs (Val121 and Leu170) are protected; also, backbone NHs that have possible side chain N-cap interactions (Lys125, Glu139, Gly160) were protected compared with the neighboring residues with unsatisfied NHs. Because the global fold of FADD-DD is similar to that of Fas-DD and helices α2 and α3 of Fas-DD is known to be involved in FADD binding, we focused on α2 and α3. Mutants were constructed in which the charged residues in helices α2 and α3 were substituted by Ala, and Leu119 and Val121 were replaced by Asn (Fig.2). The affinity of FADD-DD and variant proteins was measured by surface plasma resonance using BIAcore system (Pharmacia Biosensor AB). R110A, R113A, R117A, E118A, V121N, and E123A mutations virtually abolished the binding affinity of FADD-DD to Fas-DD, and R114A, L119N, and D127A mutations decreased the binding affinity more than four orders of magnitude (Fig.3). All mutations decreased the binding affinity of FADD-DD but D111A, K120A, E130A, and E131A had marginal effects. All mutations constructed also decreased self-association of FADD. The association tendency can be divided into four classes based on self-association between FADD-DD and FADD. As indicated in Fig. 3, self-association is also significantly alleviated by the mutations in helices α2 and α3, indicating that self-association and binding to Fas-DD use similar surface. These results indicate that the charged residues in α2 and α3 are involved in Fas interaction and self-association, which is also shown in Fas-DD (19Huang B. Eberstadt M. Olejniczak E.T. Meadows R.P. Fesik S.W. Nature. 1996; 384: 638-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). The structure of FADD-DD (Fig. 1) indicates that its fold is similar to other death-related proteins such as Fas-DD (19Huang B. Eberstadt M. Olejniczak E.T. Meadows R.P. Fesik S.W. Nature. 1996; 384: 638-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar), FADD-DED (20Eberstadt M. Huang B. Chen Z. Meadows R.P. Ng S.C. Zheng L. Lenardo M.J. Fesik S.W. Nature. 1998; 392: 941-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar), and caspase recruitment domain of RAIDD (21Chou J.J. Matsuo H. Duan H. Wagner G. Cell. 1998; 94: 171-180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Helices α1, α2, α4, α5, and α6 form a hydrophobic core, and helix α3 is somewhat isolated from the rest of the protein and is the most flexible among the helices. Considering that α2 and α3 are involved in the binding to Fas-DD, α3 is most likely to be involved in binding modulation and adapter protein selectivity. The flexibility of α3 could be crucial in maximizing contacts between the interacting death domains. The lpr mutation in Fas receptor induces the complete loss of α3 and reduces the binding affinity of Fas-DD to FADD (36Eberstadt M. Huang B. Olejniczak E.T. Fesik S.W. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 983-985Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), and the corresponding mutation (V121N) in FADD-DD also showed similar loss in binding affinity. This may indicate that the role of α3 is conserved in death domains. FADD-DD structure has an exposed hydrophobic surface at the N- and C-terminal helices (Fig. 1), and the same pattern was reported in FADD-DED (20Eberstadt M. Huang B. Chen Z. Meadows R.P. Ng S.C. Zheng L. Lenardo M.J. Fesik S.W. Nature. 1998; 392: 941-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Because the C terminus of DED is connected to the N terminus of DD in an intact FADD, the structure of FADD would have 12 antiparallel helices comprising 6 helices from each domain and a disordered C terminus comprising residues 184–205. The interactions between DED and DD domains are expected to be from the residues of α1 and α6 of each domain. The partial digestion of FADD by subtilisin indicates that the C-terminal region comprising residues 184–205 is the most susceptible to the protease. Also the fragments that remained intact after 2 h of digestion were the N-terminal 88 residues (residues 1–88) and the C-terminal 95 residues (residues 89–183), indicating that two domains are connected by a flexible loop. Mutations of charged residues in α2 and α3 of FADD-DD indicate that the major binding sites between FADD-DD and Fas-DD appear to reside in α2 and α3. Mutations of Fas-DD (19Huang B. Eberstadt M. Olejniczak E.T. Meadows R.P. Fesik S.W. Nature. 1996; 384: 638-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar), TNFR-DD (37Tartaglia L.A. Ayres T.M. Wong G.H. Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1993; 74: 845-853Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1169) Google Scholar), and TRADD-DD (38Park A. Baichwal V.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9858-9862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) indicated that α2 and α3 are important for functions, but other regions are also implicated. However, among the residues on the surface, charged residues in α2 and α3 are most likely candidates for protein interactions. Other residues affecting the structural integrity of death domains, such as lpr mutant, could have effects on protein functions. The result of extensive mutation studies in α2 and α3 of FADD-DD indicates that this region affects binding affinity of Fas-DD for FADD-DD. As shown in Fig.4, the charge distribution in α2 and α3 of FADD-DD and Fas-DD are similar, indicating that interactions between the two proteins are anti-parallel. Helix α2 of Fas-DD interacts with α3 of FADD-DD and vice versa. In Fas-induced apoptosis, Fas receptor is trimerized upon stimulation and then recruits FADD. It is not known yet whether Fas receptor trimer is needed for creating a binding site for FADD, or trimerization is a means to expose the extra binding surface of Fas receptor to FADD. Our experiments showed that FADD-DD binds to Fas-DD with a dissociation constant of about 200 nm. Considering that FADD and Fas used in experiments are mouse and human origin, respectively, and the fact that Fas-DD binds better to an intact FADD (39Boldin M.P. Goncharov T.M. Goltsev Y.V. Wallach D. Cell. 1996; 85: 803-815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2113) Google Scholar) than FADD-DD alone, Fas receptor monomer seems to be capable of recruiting FADD. This indicates that the trimerization of Fas receptor is required to expose a binding surface rather than creating a binding surface. The whole binding surface of Fas-DD may not be available in monomer either by interacting with membrane or other factors. When induced by ligand, the whole binding surface of Fas-DD would be exposed by conformational change and recruit FADD. Once the death domain of Fas binds to FADD, the induced conformational change (3Muzio M. Chinnaiyan A.M. Kischkel F.C. O'Rourke K. Shevchenko A. Ni J. Scaffidi C. Bretz J.D. Zhang M. Gentz R. Mann M. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. Dixit V.M. Cell. 1996; 85: 817-827Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2743) Google Scholar) would convert FADD into a high affinity form for procaspase-8, triggering recruitment and activation of caspase-8. The mode of conformational change is not clear, but domain movement of DD and DED of FADD is most likely. However, the low affinity binding between DDs or DEDs may occur in a normal cell, so overexpression of proteins containing these domains can lead to cell death. In fact, the difference in affinity between the low affinity and the high affinity form of Fas receptor or FADD may not be that high. The 10-fold difference in binding affinity is equivalent to about 1.3 kcal/mol at the physiological temperature, indicating that a small conformational change can easily switch from the low affinity to high affinity form. In conclusion, FADD death domain consists of six antiparallel helices similar to other known death-related domains. Helices α2 and α3 of death domain constitute a major binding surface and appear to interact antiparallel with the death domain of Fas receptor. We think that the ligand-induced exposure of the binding site of Fas receptor and FADD is crucial to Fas-mediated apoptosis. We thank Professor B.

Unexpectedly, however, the transcription of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) long terminal repeats (LTR) is shown to be activated at the level of elongation, in human and murine cells exposed to these drugs, whereas the Rous sarcoma virus LTR, the human cytomegalovirus immediate early gene (CMV), and the HSP70 promoters are repressed. Activation of the HIV LTR is independent of the NFκB and TAR sequences and coincides with an enhanced average phosphorylation of the C-terminal domain (CTD) from the largest subunit of RNA polymerase II. Both the HIV-1 LTR activation and the bulk CTD phosphorylation enhancement are prevented by several CTD kinase inhibitors, including 5,6-dichloro-1-β-d-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole. The efficacies of the various compounds to block CTD phosphorylation and transcription in vivo correlate with their capacities to inhibit the CDK9/PITALRE kinase in vitro.

Actinomycin D is generally thought to intercalate into DNA thereby preventing the progression of RNA polymerases, with RNAP I being the most sensitive (5Perry R.P. Kelley D.E. J. Cell.

In previous work, we have shown that the average phosphorylation of RNAP II C-terminal domain (CTD) increases in cells exposed to actinomycin D (7Dubois M.F. Nguyen V.T. Bellier S. Bensaude O. J.

Chem. 1996; 271: 19009-19012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). The underphosphorylated CTD mediates multiple protein-protein interactions involved in the assembly of a preinitiation complex. The subsequent phosphorylation of the CTD occurs along the initiation of transcription and contributes to disrupt some of the interactions that lead to the assembly of the preinitiation complex on promoters. Phosphorylation of RNAP II at this step is required to elongate transcription and mediates the recruitment of various enzymatic complexes involved in processing of the primary transcript (10Corden J.L. Patturajan M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 413-416Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 11Shuman S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In contrast, phosphorylation of the CTD prior to the formation of the preinitiation complex represses the expression of specific genes (13Hengartner C.J. Myer V.E. Liao S.-M. Wilson C.J. Koh S.S. Young R.A. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 43-53Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). Hence, the increase in average phosphorylation of the CTD promoted by actinomycin D raises the possibility that different genes may have different susceptibilities to this drug. Several cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK) have been shown to phosphorylate the CTD and regulate transcription. CDK7, and its partner, cyclin H, are subunits of the general transcription factor, TFIIH, a component of the preinitiation complex (14Svejstrup J.Q. Vichi P. Egly J.-M. Trends Biochem.

Involvement of the CDK7 and CDK9/PITALRE kinases in transcription is probably best documented for the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) long terminal repeat (LTR) promoter. Transcriptional activation of the HIV LTR at the level of elongation is a key step for the viral replication cycle and has been extensively analyzed (reviewed in Refs.22Garcia J.A. Gaynor R. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. 1994; 49: 157-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar and 23Jones K.A. Peterlin B.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 717-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar). Like other retroviruses, the HIV can integrate in the cellular genome and remain silent for an indefinite period (24McCune J.M. Cell. 1995; 82: 183-188Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In the latently infected cells, the basal transcription directed by the HIV LTR is inefficient as most of the transcription initiation events abort approximately 60–80 nucleotides (including the TAR RNA) downstream of the transcription initiation site (25Sheldon M. Ratneswaran R. Hernandez N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1251-1263Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). A great variety of stimulations switch the latent-infected cells to cells producing viral proteins including Tat and viral particles. The Tat protein binds the TAR RNA and activates the transcription directed by the LTR promoter (reviewed in Refs. 26Cullen B.R.

Tat binds to a number of components of the basal transcriptional machinery such as TATA-binding protein or the RNAP II holoenzyme (28Kingsman S.M. Kingsman A.J. Eur. J.

Phosphorylation of the CTD assisted by the viral protein Tat is essential in establishing an efficient transcription of the entire viral genome (reviewed in Ref. 30Jones K.A. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2593-2599Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). The Tat protein first facilitates the phosphorylation of the CTD by CDK7. In a second step, Tat recruits the CDK9/PITALRE CTD kinase (21Zhu Y. Pe'ery T. Peng J. Ramanathan Y. Marshall N. Marshall T. Amendt B. Mathews M.B. Price D.H.

Therefore, to investigate whether an enhanced CTD phosphorylation influences the efficiency of actinomycin D and α-amanitin on transcription of identified genes, we followed their effect on the expression of a reporter gene driven by the HIV-1 LTR or by the human cytomegalovirus (CMV) immediate early promoters. Unexpectedly, both drugs were found to promote an enhanced reporter expression when the corresponding cDNA was placed under the control of the HIV-1 LTR promoter. This stimulation is shown to be at the level of elongation of transcription and is suggested to be linked to an enhanced average CTD phosphorylation which may involve the CDK9/PITALRE CTD kinase. The luciferase cDNA was placed under the control of the Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) LTR, pRSVLuc, (32De Wet J.R. Wood K.V. DeLuca M. Helinsky D.R. Subramani S. Mol. Cell.

Plasmid pLTRWTLuc contained the HIV-1 ARV-2 LTR wild type sequences from −644 to +83, plasmid pLTRΔkBLuc derived from pLTRWTLuc, and the NFκB sites A and B were deleted and replaced by a BclI linker (34Bachelerie F.

Plasmid pLTR476Luc contained the luciferase cDNA controlled by the HIV-1 ARV-2 LTR wild type sequences from −177 to +83; in the plasmid pLTR361ΔSp1Luc derived from pLTR476Luc, the three Sp1 sites (−75 to −50) have been replaced by the sequence 5′-ATATCGTGGC CTGTGTAGTC CGTGCC. Plasmids pLTRXLuc, pLTRBLuc, and pLTRBΔTARLuc contained the luciferase cDNA controlled by the HIV-1 Bru LTR between, respectively, nucleotides −644 to +83, −489 to +83, and −489 to +32 (35Schwartz O.

Virelizier J.L. Montagnier L. Hazan U. Gene (Amst.). 1990; 88: 197-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). To generate plasmid pCM/IVLuc, the CMV sequences between −324 and −18 (relative to the transcription initiation site) were amplified by PCR from plasmid pCMVLuc using the primers 5′-GCGATCTCGA GCGTCAATGACG GTAAATG and 5′-GCATGCAGCT GCTTATATAG ACCTCC. The amplified fragment was digested with XhoI andPvuII and inserted between the unique XhoI andPvuII sites of pHIVLucA41. To generate plasmid pHI/MVLuc, the pCMVLuc sequences between −18 and +738 were amplified by PCR using the primers 5′-GAATATCAGC TGCTCGTTTA GTGAACCGTC AG and 5′-CTGGCATGCG AGAATCTGAC GCAGGCAGTT. The amplified fragment was digested withPvuII and BstEII and inserted between the uniquePvuII and BstEII sites of pHIVLucA41. To generate pmTATALuc, the pHIVLucA41 sequences were amplified by PCR using the primers 5′-GCAAAAAGCA GCTGCTTGTC TGCAGCATCT GAG and 5′-AACCTGATAT CCCCTCGAGG TCACGT that replaced the TATA box sequence by GACA. The amplified fragment was digested with XhoI andPvuII and inserted between the unique XhoI andPvuII sites of pHIVLucA41. All these plasmids were controlled by sequencing the 3′ ends of the promoter fragments. Murine Ltk−, NIH 3T3, and human HeLa cells (MRL2 strain) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. The muHL6b were derived from Ltk− cells after cotransfection with pHIVLucA41 and pAGO, plasmid carrying the herpes thymidine kinase gene. The huHL6 cells were derived from HeLa cells cotransfected with pHIVLucA41 and pRSVtkneo, a plasmid carrying the neomycin resistance gene. Clones were subcloned and selected, respectively, in HAT or G418 medium for luciferase expression. In transient transfection assays, cells were transfected by the standard calcium phosphate procedure and left to grow for 24 h before addition of the various drugs; semi-confluent growing cells, 8 × 105 cells per well of a 24-well tissue culture plate, were transfected with 0.25 μg of luciferase expression vector supplemented with 2 μg of DNA with plasmid pSP64 (Promega) as a carrier. Actinomycin D, α-amanitin, and DRB were purchased from Sigma. TRB, T276339, H7, T172298, T525636, T172299, and T163693 were kindly provided by Dr. Osvaldo Flores as 10 mm stock solutions in dimethyl sulfoxide (37Mancebo H.S. Lee G. Flygare J. Tomassini J.

Cells were washed twice in ice-chilled phosphate-buffered saline and lysed on ice in buffer A (25 mm Tris-H3PO4, pH 7.8, 10 mm MgCl2, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm2-mercaptoethanol 1 mm EDTA, and 15% glycerol). Luciferase activity was determined using a Berthold luminometer and mixing 150 μl of cell lysate to 100 μl of buffer A containing 1.2 mm ATP and 0.33 mm luciferin and measuring the light emission for 10 s after mixing. Total cellular RNAs were isolated by the guanidinium thiocyanate method. 15 μg of total RNA were denatured 15 min at 65 °C in 6% formaldehyde, run on a 1.2% agarose, 6.3% formaldehyde gel. Equal loading of each lane was checked by ethidium bromide staining. The gels were blotted onto Hybond N nylon membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) that were UV cross-linked, prehybridized at 65 °C for 1 h in 0.5 mNa2HPO4, 1% bovine serum albumin, 1 mm EDTA, and 7% SDS and hybridized overnight at 65 °C to radiolabeled probes in the prehybridization solution. The membranes were washed twice at room temperature in 2× NaCl/citrate buffer (SSC), 0.1% SDS for 1 h and twice at 42 °C in 0.2× SSC, 0.1% SDS for 1 h. Membranes were autoradiographed. Quantification was performed with a FUJI BAS-1 PhosphorImager. Before reprobing, the membranes were boiled for 10 min in 0.1% SDS to strip off the hybridized probe.

The Alu5 luciferase antisense primer, 5′-TCTTTATGTT TTTGGCGTCT TCCAT, was end-labeled with T4 kinase. 20 μg of total RNA were denatured 10 min at 75 °C and annealed to the primer overnight at 42 °C in 20 μl 10 mm Pipes, pH 6.4, and 400 mm NaCl, overlaid with 20 μl of mineral oil. Nucleic acids were precipitated in ethanol and redissolved in 20 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.2, 6 mm MgCl2, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 100 μm of the four dNTPs, 0.1 unit/μl RNasin (Promega), and 1 unit/μl SuperScript II RNase H− reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.). Primer extension was performed at 42 °C for 60 min using the Alu5 luciferase primer. Nucleic acids were precipitated in ethanol, redissolved in formamide loading buffer, and run on a 10% denaturing polyacrylamide-urea gel. The dried gels were exposed for autoradiography. DNA sequences were obtained using the Alu5 primer, plasmid pHIVLucA41, and a T7 Sequencing kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The primers GCCCTCAGATGCTGCATATA and CGGTCCATCCTCTAGAGGAT were used to generate the 5′ probes (177 base pairs from −42 to +136), whereas the primers CAGCTATTCTGATTACACCCG and ATTCGCCTCTCTGATTAACG were used for the M probes (127 base pairs from +1111 to +1238). These primers were used to amplify DNA fragments by symmetric PCR (30 cycles) using pHIVLucA41Luc as a starting template. The single-strand antisense probes were amplified from these DNA fragments by asymmetric PCR (30 cycles) using only one of the primers. Run-on assays were performed following established procedures (42Linial M. Gunderson N. Groudine M. Science. 1985; 230: 1126-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). 2 × 107 nuclei were allowed to transcribe in vitro for 20 min at 30 °C in the presence of [α-32P]UTP, non-radioactive ATP, CTP, and GTP with or without α-amanitin (0.1 μg/ml), and the resulting RNAs were isolated. These RNAs were hybridized to Hybond-N+ membranes (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) on which either linearized and denatured plasmids (5 μg) or single-strand probes (1 μg) had been slotted. Hybridizations were at 65 °C in Church buffer (0.5 m sodium phosphate, 7% SDS, 1 mm EDTA, 1% serum albumin). Dehybridization washes were done at 65 °C in 0.2× SSC, 0.5% SDS. The cells were dissolved in 1× Laemmli buffer, and the samples were heated for 5 min at 95 °C before loading on sodium dodecyl sulfate-5% polyacrylamide gels. The RNAP II largest subunit was detected with the POL 3/3 antibody that recognizes an epitope located outside the CTD (43Kontermann R.E. Liu Z. Schulze R.A. Sommer K.A. Queitsch I. Dubel S. Kipriyanov S.M. Breitling F. Bautz E.K. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1995; 376: 473-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). This monoclonal antibody was visualized with an anti-mouse IgG horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Promega) and chemiluminescence (Pierce). To investigate the dose effect of α-amanitin on the expression of a reporter gene under the control of a defined promoter, firefly luciferase activity was followed in lysates from muHL6b cells exposed to varying amounts of the drug for 24 h. This clonal cell line was derived from murine Ltk− cells stably transfected with a plasmid, pHIVLucA41, in which the luciferase cDNA had been placed under the control of an HIV LTR. Unexpectedly, increasing amounts of luciferase activity were found in lysates from muHL6b cells exposed during 24 h to α-amanitin up to 30 μg/ml (Fig.1 A). The highest stimulation (∼28-fold) was achieved at 10 μg/ml, a rather elevated concentration. To extend these observations to other cell systems, we stably transfected HeLa cells with pHIVLucA41 and isolated the huHL6 clonal human cell line. α-Amanitin also stimulated the luciferase expression in huHL6 cells but with much lower efficiency than in the murine cells (only 3.5-fold). To establish whether the increase in luciferase synthesis might be related to a general interference with transcription, we investigated the response to actinomycin D, another transcriptional inhibitor acting through a different mechanism. The luciferase activity increased up to 130-fold in muHL6b cells treated with an optimal actinomycin D concentration around 0.3 μg/ml and up to 45-fold in the huHL6 cells, culminating for 0.2 μg/ml of actinomycin D (Fig. 1 B). Due to a higher actinomycin toxicity, the increase in luciferase activity dropped more rapidly than with the muHL6b cells. This increase was exponential between 0 and 20 h of treatment (Fig. 1 C), but to be observed, the cells had to remain exposed to the drug until lysis; and when actinomycin D was removed after 6 h, no significant increase was observed 18 h later (data not shown). Thus, moderate actinomycin D or α-amanitin concentrations enhance luciferase synthesis in murine and human cell lines stably transfected with a plasmid associating the HIV-1 LTR to the luciferase cDNA. But no stimulation was observed when actinomycin D (0.2 μg/ml) and α-amanitin (10 μg/ml) were added simultaneously (data not shown). This finding as well as the bell-shaped dose-response curves suggests two opposing effects: an activation and an inhibition. At high drug concentration, the latter overcomes. The increased expression of the luciferase gene in stably transfected cells might relate to a positional effect in the region of plasmid DNA insertion. Indeed, Tat transactivation of the HIV-1 LTR has been reported to differ for integrated versus unintegrated vectors (44Jeang K.-T. Berkhout B. Dropulic B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24940-24949Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, HeLa cells were transiently transfected with the pHIVLucA41 plasmid. The luciferase activity in the lysates was strongly enhanced when the cells were exposed 24 h to actinomycin D after transfection (Fig.2). The strongest effects were obtained around 0.1 μg/ml drug, and higher concentrations led to a drop in activation. The optimal drug concentration was lower than with the related huHL6 cells as the calcium phosphate treatment exacerbated an extensive cell death. The transient transfection assays allowed us to compare different promoters. Therefore, HeLa cells were transfected with plasmids associating the luciferase cDNA to other promoters such as the Rous sarcoma virus LTR (RSV), the cytomegalovirus early promoter (CMV), or the human HSP70 promoter (there was no need to stress the cells to observe a relatively high basal level of HSP70-driven luciferase expression). In the two latter cases, the luciferase activity in the lysates decreased with increasing concentrations of actinomycin D (Fig. 2). However, the Rous sarcoma virus LTR resisted inhibition up to 0.1 μg/ml actinomycin D. These results, which were also obtained upon transient transfection of NIH 3T3 cells (not shown), suggest that the effect of actinomycin D is a characteristic of the HIV LTR promoter. To establish that the increase in luciferase activity reflected an increase in the corresponding mRNA, total RNAs were isolated from muHL6b cells incubated with actinomycin D for 24 h and were analyzed by Northern blot. The luciferase probe detected a major RNA species between the 18 S and the 28 S rRNAs and a minor species below the 18 S RNA (Fig.3 A). The size of the major species (2.9 ± 0.2 kilobases) was consistent with the 2.62 kilobase pairs separating the expected transcription initiation from the termination site on the pHIVLucA41 plasmid and likely corresponded to a full-length luciferase mRNA as the luciferase cDNA coding sequence spans over 1650 bases (32De Wet J.R. Wood K.V. DeLuca M. Helinsky D.R. Subramani S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 725-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (2481) Google Scholar). In muHL6b cells treated for 24 h with actinomycin D, both RNA species markedly increased in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3 A, left). The highest increase was observed with cells treated with 0.2 μg/ml actinomycin D. At higher concentrations (2 μg/ml), the signal corresponding to luciferase mRNA remained as in the controls and decreased at 20 μg/ml (not shown). The increase in luciferase mRNA was observable after 6 h of exposure to 0.2 μg/ml actinomycin D (Fig. 3 A, right). When the muHL6b cells were exposed to α-amanitin, the 2.9 kilobase pairs of luciferase mRNA abundance also increased with time (Fig. 3 B). To evaluate the general transcriptional inhibition, the above-mentioned Northern blots were rehybridized with cellular genes probes. In RNAs prepared from muHL6b cells, the actin and the 70-kDa heat shock cognate (HSC73) probes each detected a single mRNA species with the expected sizes. When the cells were exposed to actinomycin D at concentrations above 0.02 μg/ml, both the actin and HSC73 mRNA abundance decreased indicating that these genes were inhibited (Fig.3 A). The decrease was more pronounced for HSC73 due to the shorter half-life of the corresponding mRNA in murine cells. Both signals were distinctly stronger with 0.2 μg/ml than with 2 μg/ml actinomycin D indicating that for this concentration, which was optimal for luciferase induction, the transcriptional inhibition was not complete. When the muHL6b cells were exposed to α-amanitin, the HSC73 mRNA levels also decreased (Fig. 3 B). When the RNAs were prepared from actinomycin-treated huHL6 cells, a strong increase in luciferase mRNA was also observed, but the minor species was less abundant than in muHL6b cells (Fig. 3 C). Very low concentrations of actinomycin D (0.006 μg/ml) have been reported to promote an increase in p21WAF-1 mRNA in MRC5 human fibroblasts (45Bates S. Rowan S. Vousden K.H. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 1103-1109PubMed Google Scholar). However, no reliable changes in p21WAF-1 signals were found in huHL6 cells exposed to actinomycin D in the 0.02 to 0.1 μg/ml range. Primer extension using RNAs prepared from actinomycin D-treated huHL6 cells demonstrated that under these conditions, the luciferase mRNAs were correctly initiated at the usual +1 position (Fig. 4). Thus, treatments that determine an enhanced luciferase mRNA accumulation lead to a neat decrease in housekeeping gene mRNAs indicating a general transcriptional arrest. The increase in luciferase mRNA abundance was more pronounced with actinomycin D than with α-amanitin, as anticipated by luciferase activity determinations. To establish that the accumulation of luciferase mRNA was due to an enhanced transcription of the corresponding gene, run-on assays were performed with nuclei prepared from huHL6 cells untreated or exposed to actinomycin D. The actinomycin D treatment determined a 13-fold increase in the luciferase gene signal (Fig.5 A). In contrast, the actin and HSC73 gene signals remained unaffected, and the ribosomal gene signal decreased more than 100 times as expected from the known high susceptibility of class I gene transcription (5Perry R.P. Kelley D.E. J. Cell. Physiol. 1970; 76: 127-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). To demonstrate that the luciferase gene transcription in actinomycin D-treated cells was attributable to RNAP II transcription, the run-ons were also performed in the presence of α-amanitin in the assay (0.1 μg/ml). Addition of α-amanitin to nuclei prepared from control untreated cells did not affect the 18 S rRNA signal as expected since RNAP I is insensitive to this compound; however, it completely wiped off the luciferase and the actin signals. The luciferase and actin signals as well as the remaining 18 S signal were also suppressed by addition of α-amanitin to nuclei from actinomycind-treated cells. First, it should be emphasized that this finding does not conflict the data provided in Fig. 1 A asin vitro α-amanitin poisoning of RNAP II is likely to be fast and complete, whereas in vivo it is a slow, incomplete process controlled by the penetration of the drug (46Kidder G.M.

Second, an involvement of RNAP II in ribosomal DNA transcription has been shown to occur in yeast cells that lack RNAP I activity (48Conrad-Webb H. Butow R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2420-2428Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). To discriminate between an enhanced initiation of transcription and an enhanced elongation of transcription, the run-ons"

GRK-mediated phosphorylation is also necessary for endocytosis of certain GPCRs, presumably by enhancing their interactions with β-arrestins (11Ferguson S.S. Menard L. Barak L.S. Koch W.J.

However, expression of dominant negative β-arrestin mutants has no effect on endocytosis of the angiotensin II type 1A receptor or the m1, m3, and m4 muscarinic cholinergic receptors (9Zhang J.

Alterations in the subcellular distribution of GPCRs, GRKs, and β-arrestins determine cellular responsiveness to agonists and may be important for signal transduction. Receptor endocytosis contributes to desensitization by depleting the cell surface of receptors available to interact with agonists in the extracellular fluid (1Böhm S. Grady E.F. Bunnett N.W. Biochem. J. 1997; 322: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar), and endocytosis of β2ARs is required for stimulation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (15Daaka Y. Luttrell L.M. Ahn S.

Agonists of several GPCRs induce translocation of GRK2/3 and β-arrestins from the cytosol to the plasma membrane where they interact with cell-surface receptors to participate in uncoupling and endocytosis (16Pitcher J.A.

However, the duration of these interactions and the fate of GRK2/3 and β-arrestins during endocytosis and recycling of GPCRs have not been examined. These are important issues because resensitization requires endocytosis and processing of receptors, which may entail dissociation of ligand and β-arrestin, receptor dephosphorylation, and recycling (19Yu S.S.

The purpose of the present investigation was to examine substance P (SP)-induced trafficking of β-arrestins and to determine the role of β-arrestins in endocytosis of the SP or neurokinin-1 receptor (NK1R). Regulation of cellular responses to SP are of interest in view of the important role of the NK1R in pain transmission in the spinal cord, regulation of intestinal motility and secretion, mediation of neurogenic inflammation, and in depression in humans (26Otsuka M.

By using fluorescent SP to detect the NK1R in neurons, we showed that SP causes translocation of β-arrestins to the plasma membrane and to endosomes containing the NK1R (34McConalogue K. Corvera C.U.

This approach requires transfected cells but enables direct observation of trafficking in real time for prolonged periods. We expressed dominant negative β-arrestin to determine the role of β-arrestins in NK1R endocytosis. Our aims were as follows: (a) generate cell lines expressing NK1R-GFP or wild type NK1R plus β-arrestin1-GFP (ARR-GFP) and investigate whether GFP affects the function of these proteins; (b) examine SP-induced trafficking of NK1R-GFP and ARR-GFP in real time and determine their precise subcellular distribution for 0–6 h after stimulation with SP; (c) determine if SP induces redistribution of endogenous β-arrestin1, β-arrestin2, and Gαq/11 in cells expressing wild type NK1R; and (d) examine the effect of a dominant negative mutant of β-arrestins on SP-induced endocytosis of the NK1R. Enhanced GFP (EGFP) expression vector pEGFP-N1 and JM109 bacteria were from CLONTECH (Palo Alto, CA).

A polymerase chain reaction fragment of cDNA encoding enhanced GFP (EGFP) was cloned into theHindIII/XbaI restriction sites of pGEX-2T. The resultant plasmid, pGEXGFP, was transfected into Escherichia coli strain BL21DE3. The GST-GFP protein was purified using glutathione-agarose. An emulsion was prepared from equal parts of GFP and complete Freund's adjuvant. Two New Zealand rabbits (female, 8 weeks) were immunized at intervals of 6–8 weeks. At each immunization, both rabbits received 2.0 ml of emulsion containing approximately 1 mg of GFP, divided into 8–10 intradermal sites. At the first immunization, 0.5 ml of Tri-immunol vaccine was injected intramuscularly. Antibody 9708 had a titer of 1:100,000 by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and was used in all experiments.

Open table in a new tab Constructs with EGFP at the C terminus of rat NK1R, β-arrestin1, and dominant negative rat β-arrestin1319–418 were generated by polymerase chain reaction using the following primers andPfu DNA polymerase. For NK1R, the forward primer was 5′-GGCCGGGAATTCGCCACCATGGATAACGTCCTTCCTATG-3′ (EcoRI site underlined, followed by the Kozak translation initiation site, and the N terminus of NK1R cDNA inbold), and the reverse primer was 5′-GGCCGGGGATCCCCGGCCAGCATGTTAGAGTAGAA-3′ (BamHI site underlined, C terminus of the NK1R cDNA in bold). A 1253-base pair fragment amplified from rat NK1R cDNA was separated on an agarose gel and purified using QiaEx extraction kit. For β-arrestin1, the forward primer was 5′-GGCCGGAAGCTTGCCACCATGGGCGACAAAGGGACACGA-3′ (HindIII restriction site underlined, N terminus of β-arrestin1 cDNA in bold), and the reverse primer was 5′-GGCCGGCCGCGG TCTGTTGTTGAGGTGTGGAGA-3′ (SacII site underlined, C terminus of β-arrestin1 inbold). A 1284-base pair fragment amplified from rat β-arrestin1 cDNA (Dr. R. Lefkowitz, Duke University) was purified. A fragment of bovine β-arrestin1319–418 acts as a dominant negative mutant (10Krupnick J.G. Santini F. Gagnon A.W. Keen J.H. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32507-32512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). A construct of rat β-arrestin1319–418 was generated using the forward primer 5′-GGCCGGAAGCTTGCCACCATGGTTTCCTACAAAGTCAAAGTG-3′ (HindIII site underlined, sequence corresponding to rat β-arrestin1319–325 in bold), and the same reverse primer as for wild type β-arrestin1. All constructs were ligated into pEGFP-N1 vector and used to transform JM109 E. coli in Luria broth containing 30 μg/ml kanamycin. The sequences of the chimeras were verified using a reverse primer (5′-CGTCGCCGTCCAGCTCGACCAG-3′) corresponding to the 46–67 region of the GFP. The generation and characterization of KNRK cells stably expressing rat NK1R (KNRK-NK1R cells) with N-terminal Flag (DYKDDDDK) epitope has been described (38Vigna S. Bowden G. McDonald D.M. Fisher J. Okamoto A. McVey D.C. Payan D. Bunnett N.W. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 834-845Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The Flag epitope does not affect binding, signaling, or trafficking of the NK1R. To obtain a cell line expressing NK1R-GFP, KNRK cells were transfected with cDNA encoding NK1-GFP, and colonies were screened for expression of GFP by fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry (38Vigna S. Bowden G. McDonald D.M. Fisher J. Okamoto A. McVey D.C. Payan D. Bunnett N.W. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 834-845Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To generate a cell line expressing FlagNK1R plus ARR-GFP, KNRK-NK1R cells (expressing FlagNK1R) were transfected with cDNA encoding ARR-GFP. To verify coexpression of FlagNK1R plus ARR-GFP, clones were screened by immunofluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry to detect NK1R and β-arrestin (below). Highly expressing clones were further enriched by fluorescence-activated cell sorting. Cells were maintained and prepared for experiments as described (23Grady E.F. Garland A.G. Gamp P.D. Lovett M.

Neurosci. 1994; 14: 834-845Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To express GFP constructs transiently, KNRK-NK1R cells (stably expressing FlagNK1R) were transfected by overnight incubation with 5 μg/ml cDNA encoding control vector pEGFP-N1, ARR-GFP, or ARR319–418-GFP and Lipofectin. Cells were plated on glass coverslips 48–72 h before experiments. Flow cytometry was used to assess expression of constructs and to enrich populations of cells. The GFP signal was used to detect NK1R-GFP. In cells coexpressing FlagNK1R and ARR-GFP, NK1R was detected using an M2 antibody to the extracellular Flag epitope and a secondary antibody coupled with (R)-phycoerythrin, and the GFP signal was used to detect ARR-GFP. Cells were dissociated in enzyme-free buffer, and 1.5 × 106 cells were resuspended in 200 μl of Iscove's medium containing 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (BSA) and 1 mmCaCl2. Cells were incubated with the M2 antibody (3 μg/ml) for 2 h at 4 °C, washed, and incubated with goat anti-mouse antibody coupled to phycoerythrin (2 μg/ml) for 2 h at 4 °C. Cells were resuspended in 1 ml of DMEM with 5% enzyme-free cell dissociation buffer, 0.3% fetal bovine serum, and 2 μg/ml propidium iodide and analyzed with a Facscan Flow Cytometer (Becton Dickinson). Fluorophores were excited at 488 nm, and emission was collected at 530/30 nm for GFP and 575/25 nm for phycoerythrin. Viability was assessed by exclusion of propidium iodide. Western blotting was used to confirm expression of GFP-tagged proteins, determine whether β-arrestin1 and β-arrestin2 are expressed in KNRK cells, and to assess specificity of the antibodies (37Grady E.F. Baluk P. Böhm S. Gamp P. Wong H. Payan D.G. Ansel J. Portbury A.L. Furness J.B. McDonald D.M. Bunnett N.W. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 6975-6986Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells (∼107) were pelleted and lysed in 1 ml of Laemmli or RIPA buffer containing a protease inhibitor mixture. Lysates were fractionated by SDS-PAGE on 4–15 or 12% polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose. Membranes were incubated in 3% non-fat milk in PBS for 60 min or 3% BSA in PBS for 60 min and then with antibodies to GFP (1:10,000 overnight, 4 °C), β-arrestin1 (1:250, 1 h, room temperature), β-arrestin2 (1:10,000, 1 h, room temperature), β-arrestin1 + 2 (1:10,000, 1 h, room temperature), or Gαq/11 (0.5 μg/ml, 1 h, room temperature). Membranes were washed and incubated with goat anti-rabbit or mouse IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (1:5,000) for 60 min at room temperature. Proteins were detected as described (37Grady E.F. Baluk P. Böhm S. Gamp P. Wong H. Payan D.G. Ansel J. Portbury A.L. Furness J.B. McDonald D.M. Bunnett N.W. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 6975-6986Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In controls, primary antibodies were preincubated with 1–2 μg/ml antigens overnight at 4 °C. To examine signaling by cells expressing GFP-tagged proteins, [Ca2+]i was measured with Fura-2/AM (24Garland A.M. Grady E.F. Lovett M. Vigna S.R. Frucht M.M. Krause J.E. Bunnett N.W. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 49: 438-446PubMed Google Scholar). Fluorescence was measured at 340 and 380 nm excitation and 510 nm emission, and results were expressed as the ratio of the fluorescence at the two excitation wavelengths, which is proportional to the [Ca2+]i. To generate concentration-response curves, cells were exposed once to varying concentrations of SP. To examine desensitization, cells were exposed to SP, washed, and then re-exposed to SP. All observations were in n > 3 experiments. The rate of NK1R endocytosis was quantified with 125I-SP as described (32Garland A.M. Grady E.F. Payan D.G. Vigna S.R. Bunnett N.W. Biochem. J. 1994; 303: 177-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Cells were incubated in Hanks' balanced salt solution containing 50 pm125I-SP, 0.1% BSA, 0.2 mg/ml bacitracin, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, and 20 μg/ml chymostatin for 60 min at 4 °C. They were washed and incubated at 37 °C for 0–30 min. Cells were washed with ice-cold PBS and incubated in 250 μl of ice-cold 0.2m acetic acid containing 50 mm NaCl, pH 2.5, on ice for 5 min to separate acid-labile (cell surface) from acid-resistant (internalized) label. Nonspecific binding was measured in the presence of 1 μm SP and was subtracted to give specific binding. Observations were in triplicate in n > 3 experiments. To examine trafficking of GFP-labeled proteins in real time, cells were maintained at 37 °C in DMEM containing 0.1% BSA (DMEM/BSA). Cells were observed before and after addition of 10 nm SP. To detect proteins by immunofluorescence, cells were incubated in DMEM/BSA containing 10 nm SP, 100 nm cyanine-3-conjugated SP (Cy3-SP), or no addition (control) for 60 min at 4 °C (for equilibrium binding), washed at 4 °C, and either fixed immediately or incubated in SP-free medium at 37 °C for 1 min to 8 h (for trafficking to proceed). Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in 100 mm PBS, pH 7.4, for 20 min at 4 °C. NK1R, β-arrestin1, β-arrestin2, β-arrestin1 + 2, Gαq/11, and markers of endosomes and lysosomes were localized by immunofluorescence (23Grady E.F. Garland A.G. Gamp P.D. Lovett M. Payan D.G.

All observations were in duplicate in n > 3 experiments. Cells were observed by confocal microscopy (25Grady E.F. Gamp P.D. Baluk P. McDonald D.M. Payan D.G. Bunnett N.W. Neuroscience. 1996; 16: 1239-1254Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). For observation of live cells, care was taken to minimize laser exposure by limiting the number of optical sections (2–3 per time point) and the laser intensity (<3%, aperture of 3–4 mm), so as to maintain fluorescence intensity. KNRK cells were stably transfected with cDNA encoding NK1R-GFP (KNRK-NK1R-GFP cells). Clone 3W was used for all experiments because a large proportion of cells expressed NK1R-GFP at a high and uniform level, assessed by flow cytometry (Fig.1 A) and microscopy (Fig.1 C). To generate cells coexpressing FlagNK1R and ARR-GFP (KNRK-NK1R + ARR-GFP cells), KNRK-NK1R cells were transfected with cDNA encoding ARR-GFP. Clone 23 was selected because a large proportion of cells coexpressed both NK1R and ARR-GFP at high and uniform levels, assessed by flow cytometry (Fig. 1 A) and microscopy (Fig. 5). Cells were studied at <passage 15 when they retained NK1R-GFP and NK1R plus ARR-GFP.Figure 5Localization of NK1R and ARR-GFP in KNRK-NK1R + ARR-GFP cells. Cells were incubated with carrier (A–C, control) or 10 nm SP for 60 min at 4 °C, washed, and incubated at 37 °C for 0 (D–F), 5 (G–I), 30 (G–I), or 240 min (M andO). NK1R was localized using a C-terminal primary antibody and a secondary antibody coupled to Texas Red (left panels). β-Arrestin1 was detected using GFP (center panels). Images in the right panels are formed by superimposition of images from the two other panels in the same row. In untreated cells, NK1R was at the plasma membrane (A, arrowheads) and ARR-GFP was cytosolic (B, arrows), with minimal colocalization (C). After incubation with SP at 4 °C, NK1R remained at the cell surface (D, arrowheads), and ARR-GFP was also detected at the plasma membrane (E, arrowheads), where it colocalized with the NK1R (F). After 5–30 min at 37 °C, the NK1R and ARR-GFP colocalized in superficial and the centrally located endosomes (G– arrows). After 240 min, NK1R was detected at the cell surface (M, arrowhead) and in some perinuclear pools where it colocalized with ARR-GFP (N andO, arrow). Scale bar = 10 μm.View Large Image"
https://openalex.org/W2026202026,"It has been shown previously that glucocorticoid receptors (GRs) that have undergone hormone-dependent translocation to the nucleus and have subsequently exited the nucleus upon hormone withdrawal are unable to recycle into the nucleus if cells are treated during hormone withdrawal with okadaic acid, a cell-permeable inhibitor of certain serine/threonine protein phosphatases. Using a green fluorescent protein (GFP) GR chimera (GFP-GR), we report here that okadaic acid inhibition of steroid-dependent receptor recycling to the nucleus is abrogated in cells treated for 1 h with colcemid to eliminate microtubule networks prior to steroid addition. After withdrawal of colcemid, normal cytoskeletal architecture is restored and okadaic acid inhibition of steroid-dependent GFP-GR nuclear recycling is restored. When okadaic acid is present during hormone withdrawal, GR that is recycled to the cytoplasm becomes complexed with hsp90 and binds steroid, but it does not undergo the normal agonist-dependent dissociation from hsp90 upon retreatment with steroid. However, when the cytoskeleton is disrupted by colcemid, the GR in okadaic acid-treated cells recycles from the cytoplasm to the nucleus in an agonist-dependent manner without dissociating from hsp90. This suggests that under physiological conditions where the cytoskeleton is intact, a dephosphorylation event is required for loss of high affinity binding to hsp90 that is required for receptor translocation through the cytoplasm to the nucleus along cytoskeletal tracts.

Although targeted movement of certain signaling proteins such as the steroid receptors, signal transducers and activators of transcription, and mitogen-activated protein kinases through the cytoplasm to the nucleus is necessary for signal transduction, virtually nothing is known about the machinery that enables these protein solutes to traverse the cytoplasm. Steroid receptors undergo a constant shuttling into and out of the nucleus (1Guichon-Mantel A. Lescop P. Christin-Maitre S. Loosfelt H. Perrot-Applanat M. Milgrom E.

EMBO J. 1987; 6: 3333-3340Crossref PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar). Because movement of the receptor can be initiated by addition of steroid, the GR is a particularly useful model for studying targeted protein movement through the cytoplasm. Studies performed with inhibitors suggest that the protein chaperone hsp90 and an okadaic acid-sensitive protein phosphatase may each play a role in GR translocation from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. The involvement of hsp90 in receptor movement is likely to involve dynamic assembly and disassembly of GR·hsp90 heterocomplexes. For example, Yang and DeFranco (9Yang J. DeFranco D.B. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 3-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) showed that molybdate, which binds to hsp90 and stabilizes GR·hsp90 heterocomplexes in vivo (10Raaka B.M. Finnerty M. Sun E. Samuels H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 14009-14015Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), trapped the GR in the cytoplasm of cells chronically exposed to hormone. It was suggested that the receptors can be exported from nuclei after hormone-dependent translocation, but they cannot be reimported into nuclei in the presence of molybdate (10Raaka B.M. Finnerty M. Sun E. Samuels H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 14009-14015Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Association of receptors with hsp90 is a dynamic process (11Smith D.F. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 1418-1429Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar), and it has been shown that GR and hsp90 can move together from the cytoplasm to the nucleus (12Kang K.I. Devin J. Cadepond F. Jibard N. Guichon-Mantel A. Baulieu E.E. Catelli M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 340-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). It has also been shown that treatment of cells with geldanamycin, an antibiotic that binds to hsp90 (13Whitesell L. Mimnaugh E.G. DeCosta B. Myers C.E. Neckers L.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cell. 1997; 90: 65-75Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1125) Google Scholar) and prevents formation of normal receptor·hsp90 heterocomplexes (15Smith D.F. Whitesell L. Nair S.C. Chen S. Prapapanich V. Rimerman R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6804-6812Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar), impedes steroid-induced movement of the GR from the cytoplasm to the nucleus (16Czar M.J. Galigniana M.D. Silverstein A.M. Pratt W.B. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7776-7785Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Taken together, these observations are consistent with the notion that hsp90 plays some role in GR movement. The notion that a phosphatase may be required for receptor shuttling evolved from the work of Qi et al. (7Qi M. Hamilton B.J. DeFranco D.B. Mol. Endocrinol. 1989; 3: 1279-1288Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 17Qi M. Stasenko L.J. DeFranco D.B. Mol. Endocrinol. 1990; 4: 455-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), who found that GRs in cells transformed with v-Mos, an oncoprotein that is a cytoplasmic serine/threonine protein kinase, undergo hormone-dependent transfer to the nucleus but that they are inefficiently retained, and they cycle back to the cytoplasm, where they do not regain the capacity for hormone-dependent translocation. Subsequently, DeFranco et al. (18DeFranco D.B. Qi M. Borror K.C. Garabedian M.J. Brautigan D.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 1215-1228Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) showed that okadaic acid, a serine/threonine protein phosphatase inhibitor, acts like v-Mos to trap GR that has cycled out of the nucleus into the cytoplasm in a form that cannot undergo hormone-dependent recycling to the nucleus. These observations suggest that a cytoplasmic phosphatase is required for recycling of GR that has passed through stages of nuclear import, transcriptional activation, and nuclear export (18DeFranco D.B. Qi M. Borror K.C. Garabedian M.J. Brautigan D.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 1215-1228Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). It is not known whether the phosphatase activity is required for GR transformation to a state that can be translocated or whether it is required for subsequent movement of the transformed receptor (18DeFranco D.B. Qi M. Borror K.C. Garabedian M.J. Brautigan D.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 1215-1228Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Recently, we have used cytoskeletal disrupting agents, such as colcemid and cytochalasin D, and a fusion protein of murine GR withAequorea green fluorescent protein (GFP-GR) to determine whether there is any linkage between hsp90-dependent receptor movement and the cytoskeleton (19Galigniana M.D. Scruggs J.L. Herrington J. Welsh M.J. Carter-Su C. Housley P.R. Pratt W.B. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1903-1913Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). As previously reported by Perrot-Applanat et al. (t12∼5min) steroid-dependent translocation to the nucleus both in cells with intact cytoskeleton and in cells with completely disrupted cytoskeletal networks. However, in cells with a normal cytoskeleton, the hsp90 inhibitor geldanamycin slowed translocation of the GFP-GR by close to an order of magnitude (t12∼45min), whereas in cells with disrupted cytoskeletal networks, geldanamycin had no effect on the translocation rate (t12∼5min). This suggests two mechanisms of GR movement. Under physiological conditions where the cytoskeleton is intact, diffusion is limited, and the GFP-GR utilizes a movement machinery in which the activity of hsp90 plays a role. In cells where the cytoskeletal networks have been artifactually disrupted, movement is still steroid-dependent, but the transformed GFP-GR moves through the cytoplasm by diffusion and is not affected by geldanamycin. In this work, we show that treatment of cells with okadaic acid inhibits GR transformation as defined by loss of its high affinity association with hsp90, and we show that disruption of microtubules with colcemid eliminates the okadaic acid block of hormone-dependent recycling of GFP-GR to the nucleus. We suggest that under physiological conditions where the cytoskeleton is intact, the GR shuttles between the cytoplasm and the nucleus with the help of a machinery that utilizes cytoskeletal tracts, involves the dynamic activity of hsp90, and requires the activity of an okadaic acid-sensitive phosphatase. However, when the cytoskeleton is disrupted, the GR moves through the cytoplasm by diffusion in a manner that is still steroid-dependent but does not require the okadaic acid-sensitive phosphatase activity and hsp90 dissociation. NIH/3T3 mouse embryo fibroblasts were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD). Phenol red-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) and LipofectAMINE were from Life Technologies, Inc. Geldanamycin was obtained from the Drug Synthesis and Chemistry branch of the Developmental Therapeutics Program, National Cancer Institute. Colcemid, colchicine, γ-lumicolchicine, and charcoal-stripped, delipidated calf serum were from Sigma. BuGR2 monoclonal anti-glucocorticoid receptor IgG was from Affinity BioReagents (Golden, CO), and the AC88 monoclonal IgG anti-hsp90 was from StressGen (Victoria, BC, Canada). Hybridoma cells producing the FiGR monoclonal IgG anti-GR (21Bodwell J.E. Orti E. Coull J.M. Pappin D.J.C. Smith L.I. Swift F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7549-7555Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were generously provided by Jack Bodwell (Dartmouth Medical School). Construction of the GFP-GR expression plasmid was described previously (19Galigniana M.D. Scruggs J.L. Herrington J. Welsh M.J. Carter-Su C. Housley P.R. Pratt W.B. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1903-1913Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). NIH/3T3 cells were grown on 22 × 22-mm coverslips in DMEM supplemented with 10% bovine calf serum in 35-mm tissue culture dishes. When cells were ∼60% confluent, they were rinsed three times with serum-free medium and then incubated for an additional hour in fresh medium. For each transfection of GFP-GR cDNA, a solution containing 2.5 μg of DNA and 10 μl of LipofectAMINE in 0.8 ml of Opti-MEM I medium was added to culture dishes containing 2 ml of DMEM and mixed gently to ensure uniform distribution. Cells were incubated with the transfection mixture for 6 h at 37 °C, and the medium was then replaced by complete growth medium for an additional 18 h of incubation. At the end of this incubation, the coverslips were washed extensively with and then incubated overnight in phenol red-free DMEM supplemented with 10% charcoal-stripped, delipidated bovine calf serum. The cells were used for GFP-GR translocation experiments. For receptor translocation and steroid withdrawal experiments, cells transfected as described above were incubated for 1 h with 0.1 μm corticosterone to permit GFP-GR translocation to the nucleus. The medium was then removed and cells were washed 3–4 times and incubated for 20 h in phenol red-free DMEM with charcoal-stripped serum with or without 50 nm okadaic acid. After 20 h, 0.1 μmcorticosterone was readded for 1 h to permit GFP-GR recycling into the nucleus. For microtubule disruption, 0.6 μg/ml colcemid was added 1 h prior to readdition of corticosterone. For geldanamycin inhibition of translocation, 20-h withdrawn cells were incubated for 1.5 h at 0 °C with corticosterone to permit receptor binding, and geldanamycin was added during the last 0.5 h at 0 °C to permit equilibration with the cells. At the end of the 1.5 h at 0 °C, cells were incubated at 37 °C for 20 min to permit steroid-dependent GFP-GR translocation. At the end of the 1-h incubation with corticosterone, the coverslips were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline at room temperature and simultaneously fixed and permeabilized by immersion in cold methanol (−25 °C) for 30 min. Cells were rinsed again with phosphate-buffered saline, and the coverslips were inverted onto a slide with 5 μl of mounting solution (1 mg/mlp-phenylenediamine in 10% phosphate-buffered saline, 90% glycerol, pH 9.0). Cells were photographed with a Leitz Aristoplan epiillumination microscope and a Leitz Vario-Orthomat camera using T-Max 3200 film. The bar in Fig. 1 represents 10 μm. Cells were scored for GFP-GR translocation as we have described previously (19Galigniana M.D. Scruggs J.L. Herrington J. Welsh M.J. Carter-Su C. Housley P.R. Pratt W.B. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1903-1913Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), using a score of 4 for nuclear fluorescence much greater than cytoplasmic fluorescence, 3 for nuclear fluorescence greater than cytoplasmic fluorescence, 2 for nuclear fluorescence equal to cytoplasmic fluorescence, 1 for nuclear fluorescence less than cytoplasmic fluorescence, and 0 for nuclear fluorescence much less than cytoplasmic fluorescence. The translocation scores represent the mean ± S.E. from three experiments in which >100 cells per condition per experiment were scored. Significance of differences was measured by analysis of variance followed by a Bonferroni t test. Untransfected 3T3 cells treated with corticosterone and okadaic acid, as indicated in Fig. 6, were suspended in 1.5 volumes of HEM buffer (10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 1 mm EDTA, 20 mm sodium molybdate) and ruptured by Dounce homogenization. Cell homogenates were centrifuged for 30 min at 100,000 × g, with the supernatant being the cytosol. The GR was immunoadsorbed from replicate aliquots (500 μl) of cytosol with FiGR ascites as described previously (16Czar M.J. Galigniana M.D. Silverstein A.M. Pratt W.B. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7776-7785Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The immune pellets were washed 4 times by suspension in 1 ml of TEGM buffer (10 mm TES, 2-{[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]amino} ethanesulfonic acid (pH 7.6), 50 mm NaCl, 4 m EDTA, 10% glycerol, 20 mm molybdate), and boiled in SDS sample buffer with 10% β-mercaptoethanol, and proteins were resolved on 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. After transfer to Immobilon-P membranes, the GR was probed with 2 μg/ml BuGR and hsp90 with 1 μg/ml AC88, and the immunoblots were incubated a second time with125I-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG. To determine whether okadaic acid blocks agonist-dependent recycling of the GFP-GR in the same manner as previously reported for endogenous GR in rat fibroblasts (18DeFranco D.B. Qi M. Borror K.C. Garabedian M.J. Brautigan D.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 1215-1228Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), we performed the experiments summarized in the legend to Fig.1. In 3T3 cells expressing GFP-GR, the fusion protein is localized to the cytoplasm in the absence of steroid (Fig. 1 A) and is translocated to the nucleus when cells are incubated with the agonist corticosterone (Fig. 1 C). The same agonist-dependent translocation is seen in cells incubated simultaneously with okadaic acid (Fig. 1, B andD). Under both conditions (i.e. with and without okadaic acid), withdrawal of corticosterone for 20 h is accompanied by return of the GFP-GR to the cytoplasm (Fig. 1,E and F). In the absence of okadaic acid, retreatment with corticosterone causes recycling of the GFP-GR to the nucleus (Fig. 1 G). However, in the presence of okadaic acid, agonist-dependent recycling to the nucleus is inhibited (Fig. 1 H). Fig. 2 A shows the time course of the return of GFP-GR to the cytoplasm upon withdrawal of corticosterone. In all of the experiments in this work, we use a 20-h withdrawal period before retreatment with agonist. Fig. 2 Bpresents the concentration dependence of okadaic acid inhibition of agonist-dependent GFP-GR recycling to the nucleus. In this case, cells were treated with corticosterone to translocate the GFP-GR to the nucleus and then withdrawn in the presence of various concentrations of okadaic acid. At the end of the 20-h withdrawal period, corticosterone was added to each culture, and the incubations were continued for an additional 1 h to permit the GFP-GR to reenter the nucleus. At concentrations below 25 nm okadaic acid, complete recycling to the nucleus is achieved, but at higher concentrations, increasing inhibition is observed. In the rest of the experiments in this work, we use 50 nm okadaic acid, which is the minimum concentration required for maximum inhibition of GFP-GR recycling to the nucleus. To determine the effect of cytoskeletal disruption on okadaic acid inhibition of GFP-GR recycling, corticosterone-treated cells were withdrawn in the presence or absence of okadaic acid and then treated for 1 h with colcemid. We have shown previously that a 1-h treatment with 0.6 μg/ml colcemid completely eliminates microtubules in 3T3 cells (19Galigniana M.D. Scruggs J.L. Herrington J. Welsh M.J. Carter-Su C. Housley P.R. Pratt W.B. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1903-1913Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.3, the GFP-GR is predominantly cytoplasmic in cells that have been withdrawn in the presence of okadaic acid and then treated with colcemid (Fig. 3 B,upper right). However, when these cells with disrupted cytoskeleton are treated again with corticosterone, there is complete translocation of the GFP-GR to the nucleus, even in the presence of okadaic acid (Fig. 3 B, lower right). In control cells that were treated identically but not exposed to colcemid, GFP-GR translocation to the nucleus was inhibited by okadaic acid (Fig.3 A, lower right). Thus, the colcemid treatment restored agonist-induced GFP-GR recycling to okadaic acid-treated cells. The effect of cytoskeletal disruption on the rate of agonist-induced nuclear reentry of the GFP-GR is shown in Fig.4. Reentry occurs at a similar rate (t12∼5min) in okadaic acid-free cells with disrupted cytoskeleton (open circles) as in cells with an intact cytoskeletal system (closed circles). In cells withdrawn in the presence of okadaic acid and not treated with colcemid (closed squares), about one-third of the cytoplasmic GFP-GRs move to the nucleus within the first few minutes after readdition of corticosterone, but a plateau of movement is achieved, and the remainder of the GFP-GRs stays in the cytoplasm. The GFP-GR that moves to the nucleus under this condition may be GFP-GR that was synthesized during the withdrawal period, and because it has not cycled through the nucleus, it is not affected by okadaic acid, as shown in Fig.1 D. In contrast, the GFP-GRs in okadaic acid-treated cells where the cytoskeleton has been disrupted by colcemid (open squares) undergo essentially complete agonist-induced nuclear reentry at the same rapid rate as in cells not treated with okadaic acid. In Fig. 5 A, cells withdrawn in the presence of okadaic acid (condition 3) were either treated with corticosterone (condition 4) or washed and incubated for 1 h in okadaic acid-free medium prior to treatment with corticosterone (condition 5). It is clear that the okadaic acid inhibition of GFP-GR reentry shown in condition 4 is eliminated when cells are washed free of okadaic acid, as shown in condition 5. As shown in condition 6, the agonist-dependent nuclear reentry of about one-third of the cytoplasmic GFP-GRs that occurs in okadaic acid-treated cells (cf. condition 4 with 3) is blocked if the hsp90 inhibitor geldanamycin is present during the 20-min incubation with corticosterone. Like the inhibition of reentry with okadaic acid alone, the total inhibition of reentry achieved by geldanamycin and okadaic acid together is reversed by washing the cells (condition 7). We have shown previously that the cytoskeletal network returns to normal when 3T3 cells with completely disrupted microtubules are incubated for a short time in colcemid-free medium (19Galigniana M.D. Scruggs J.L. Herrington J. Welsh M.J. Carter-Su C. Housley P.R. Pratt W.B. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1903-1913Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Fig.5 B shows that incubation of 3T3 cells in colcemid-free medium restores okadaic acid inhibition of GFP-GR nuclear reentry to colcemid-treated cells (cf. condition 5 with 4). The proposal that it is disruption of the cytoskeleton that permits the GFP-GR in colcemid-treated cells to travel through the cytoplasm to the nucleus despite the action of okadaic acid is supported by the data of conditions 6 and 7 in Fig. 5 B. In this case, the 3T3 cells that were withdrawn in the presence of okadaic acid were incubated for 1 h either with colchicine or with γ-lumicolchicine, a biologically inactive isomer of colchicine that does not interact with tubulin (22Wilson L. Biochemistry. 1970; 9: 4999-5007Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). We have previously reported that 3T3 cells treated with 1 μm colchicine lose their microtubules, whereas cells treated with 1 μm lumicolchicine do not (19Galigniana M.D. Scruggs J.L. Herrington J. Welsh M.J. Carter-Su C. Housley P.R. Pratt W.B. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1903-1913Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 5 B, okadaic acid did not inhibit GFP-GR nuclear reentry in colchicine-treated cells (condition 6), but it inhibited reentry in γ-lumicolchicine-treated cells (condition 7). The GR is recovered from hormone-free cells as a 9 S GR·hsp90 heterocomplex, and shortly after treatment of cells with steroid, it is recovered from cytosol as the 4 S hsp90-free GR (for review, see Ref. 23Pratt W.B. Toft D.O. Endocr. Rev. 1997; 18: 306-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (1543) Google Scholar). This steroid-dependent transformation of the receptor has been regarded as a prerequisite to translocation of the GR from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. In the experiment corresponding to Fig.6 A, we asked whether okadaic acid blocked receptor transformation. In this case, untransfected 3T3 cells were treated with corticosterone and okadaic acid as above, the cells were then ruptured, and the endogenous 3T3 cell GR was immunoadsorbed and assayed for receptor-associated hsp90 by Western blotting. As shown in Fig. 6 A, receptors that have undergone agonist-dependent translocation to the nucleus and been withdrawn in either the presence or absence of okadaic acid are in heterocomplexes with hsp90. Corticosterone retreatment of cells withdrawn in the absence of okadaic acid yielded hsp90-free GR, whereas corticosterone treatment of cells withdrawn in the presence of okadaic acid yielded GR·hsp90 heterocomplexes. In cells withdrawn in the presence of okadaic acid, there is no further nuclear movement after 10–15 min of retreatment with corticosterone (Fig. 4), and even after 1 h of corticosterone retreatment, receptors in these cells are recovered as GR·hsp90 heterocomplexes (data not shown). These data suggest that an okadaic acid-sensitive phosphatase activity is required for transformation of glucocorticoid receptors that have been cycled into and out of the nucleus. We showed in Fig. 3 B that cytoskeletal disruption with colcemid restores agonist-induced nuclear transfer of receptors in cells withdrawn in the presence of okadaic acid, and under these conditions, GFP-GR recycles to the nucleus within 10–15 min (Fig. 4). We have also shown that the endogenous cellular GR transfers to the nucleus within 10–15 min in colcemid-treated cells (8Czar M.J. Lyons R.H. Welsh M.J. Renoir J.M. Pratt W.B. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 1549-1560PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, we asked whether receptors that were recycled into the nucleus in cells that were withdrawn in the presence of okadaic acid and colcemid were recovered in the hsp90-free or hsp90-bound form. The 15-min interval after steroid treatment was chosen for the experiments corresponding to Fig. 6, because the GR that has transferred to the nucleus is still recovered in the cytosolic fraction after cell rupture. After 20 min of steroid treatment, most of the GR is retained in the nuclear fraction of colcemid-treated cells (data not shown). As shown in Fig.6 B, receptors that have been withdrawn in either the presence or absence of okadaic acid and then treated with colcemid are in heterocomplexes with hsp90. Corticosterone treatment of cells with a disrupted cytoskeleton that were withdrawn in the absence of okadaic acid resulted in hsp90-free GR, but in cells withdrawn in the presence of okadaic acid, receptors remain in heterocomplex with hsp90. Thus, the receptors in okadaic acid-withdrawn cells where the cytoskeleton is disrupted undergo agonist-dependent translocation to the nucleus (Fig. 3 B) without undergoing transformation as defined by agonist-dependent dissociation of the GR·hsp90 heterocomplex (Fig. 6 B). Two mechanistically different inhibitors of steroid-dependent GR cytoplasmic nuclear translocation have been identified as geldanamycin and okadaic acid. Geldanamycin markedly inhibits the rate of receptor translocation, but in time, all of the receptors eventually become localized in the nucleus (16Czar M.J. Galigniana M.D. Silverstein A.M. Pratt W.B. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7776-7785Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 19Galigniana M.D. Scruggs J.L. Herrington J. Welsh M.J. Carter-Su C. Housley P.R. Pratt W.B. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1903-1913Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Geldanamycin inhibits both the initial transfer of the GR (16Czar M.J. Galigniana M.D. Silverstein A.M. Pratt W.B. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7776-7785Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 19Galigniana M.D. Scruggs J.L. Herrington J. Welsh M.J. Carter-Su C. Housley P.R. Pratt W.B. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1903-1913Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) as well as the recycling of GR that has exited the nucleus upon withdrawal of hormone (Fig. 5 A and data not shown). Because geldanamycin is an hsp90 inhibitor, we have suggested that dynamic assembly of steroid-bound GR heterocomplexes with hsp90 and its associated immunophilins, such as FK506 binding protein 52, by the hsp90-based chaperone system plays a role in GR movement through the cytoplasm. Because geldanamycin slows but does not block GR movement, it seems that the role of the hsp90-based chaperone system is to facilitate movement. Perhaps it does so by facilitating the association of the receptor with a piece of movement machinery with which the receptor associates less efficiently when assembly of mature GR·hsp90 heterocomplexes is inhibited by geldanamycin. In contrast to geldanamycin, okadaic acid does not inhibit the initial steroid-dependent transfer of the GR from cytoplasm to nucleus; rather, it inhibits only the recycling of receptors that have passed through the original cycle of nuclear import, transcriptional activation, and nuclear export (18DeFranco D.B. Qi M. Borror K.C. Garabedian M.J. Brautigan D.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 1215-1228Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). Also, in contrast to geldanamycin's inhibition of the rate of movement, okadaic acid blocks recycling of the majority of receptors (Fig. 4). Okadaic acid appears to block receptor recycling by inhibiting a dephosphorylation event that is required for steroid-dependent receptor transformation (Fig. 6). The GR is a phosphoprotein (for review, see Ref. 24Orti E. Bodwell J.E. Munck A. Endocr. Rev. 1992; 13: 105-128PubMed Google Scholar) that becomes hyperphosphorylated after cells are exposed to agonist (25Orti E. Mendel D.B. Smith L.I. Munck A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 9728-9731Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Hoeck W. Rusconi S. Groner B. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 14396-14402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Dephosphorylation of the hyperphosphorylated GR itself could be the event required for receptor transformation, but other components of the untransformed receptor complex are also phosphoproteins (e.g. hsp90 and FK506 binding protein 52), and their dephosphorylation or the dephosphorylation of another protein may be critical for receptor transformation in intact cells. Here we have assayed receptor transformation by assaying the decrease in the fraction of receptors recovered as GR·hsp90 heterocomplexes from steroid-withdrawn cells that were retreated with corticosterone (Fig. 6). This steroid-dependent transformation of the receptor to a form that is no longer in stable heterocomplex with hsp90 is apparently required to permit the GR to associate with the movement machinery in normal cells with intact cytoskeleton. In contrast to hormone-free progesterone receptor·hsp90 or estrogen receptor·hsp90 heterocomplexes, which are constitutively localized to the nucleus (for review, see Ref. 23Pratt W.B. Toft D.O. Endocr. Rev. 1997; 18: 306-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (1543) Google Scholar), both of the GR NLSs appear to be blocked or conformationally inactive when the unliganded GR is in stable heterocomplex with hsp90. This may explain why the unliganded GR is cytoplasmic. Consistent with the notion that the NL1 is activated upon GR transformation, it has been shown that dissociation of GR from stable heterocomplex with hsp90 permits access of an NL1-specific antibody to the NLS (27Urda L.A. Yen P.M. Simons S.S. Harmon J.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1989; 3: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 28Scherrer L.C. Picard D. Massa E. Harmon J.M. Simons S.S. Yamamoto K.R. Pratt W.B. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 5381-5386Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). In cells that have been withdrawn in the presence of okadaic acid, the GR is in stable heterocomplex with hsp90 (Fig. 6), and it binds steroid normally (18DeFranco D.B. Qi M. Borror K.C. Garabedian M.J. Brautigan D.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 1215-1228Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), but receptor transformation as assayed by conversion to hsp90-free GR is blocked (Fig. 6). Several years ago, it was shown that microtubule disruption does not prevent cytoplasmic nuclear translocation of the progesterone receptor (20Perrot-Applanat M. Lescop P. Milgrom E. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 337-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) or the GR (8Czar M.J. Lyons R.H. Welsh M.J. Renoir J.M. Pratt W.B. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 1549-1560PubMed Google Scholar), and it does not affect steroid-mediated transcriptional activation by the GR (29Szapary D. Barber T. Dwyer N.K. Blanchette-Mackie E.J. Simons S.S. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1994; 51: 143-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). In cells treated with colcemid, neither geldanamycin (19Galigniana M.D. Scruggs J.L. Herrington J. Welsh M.J. Carter-Su C. Housley P.R. Pratt W.B. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1903-1913Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) nor okadaic acid (Figs. Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5) inhibits cytoplasmic nuclear translocation of the GR. Thus, when the cytoskeleton is disrupted, the GR appears to move by a different mechanism. A reasonable model for the normal cell would be that, like vesicles, the GR moves through the cytoplasm on cytoskeletal tracts requiring the participation of cytoskeleton-associated motor proteins. When the cytoskeletal network is intact, diffusion of protein solutes like the GR is limited, and in some way dynamic cycling of the liganded, transformed GR with hsp90 facilitates a connection between the NL1 and the movement system. In contrast, the comparatively stable association of the unliganded, untransformed GR with hsp90 blocks access of NLS recognition protein(s) to NL1. Okadaic acid appears to block receptor transformation, which is required for movement along the cytoskeleton-based movement system. We speculate that when the cytoskeleton is disrupted, a major limitation on diffusion of protein solutes has been removed, and the GR may diffuse through the cytoplasm, with its penetration through the nuclear pores being determined by interactions with nuclear uptake proteins such as importin (for review of the nuclear import of steroid receptors, see Ref. 5DeFranco D.B. Madan A.P. Tang Y. Chandran U.R. Xiao N. Yang J. Vitam. Horm. 1995; 51: 315-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). It is interesting that recycling of the GR in okadaic acid-withdrawn cells treated with colcemid is strictly steroid-dependent (Figs.3 B and 5 B). Yet, under these conditions, the GR appears to remain in stable association with hsp90 (Fig.6 B). Some steroid-dependent event other than dissociation from hsp90 must have occurred such that GR transformation is uncoupled from GR movement in the cell treated with both colcemid and okadaic acid. Because Perrot-Applanat et al. (20Perrot-Applanat M. Lescop P. Milgrom E. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 337-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) demonstrated that the progesterone receptor could move from the cytoplasm to the nucleus in cells where the cytoskeletal networks were completely disrupted, it has been assumed that the cytoskeleton is not involved in steroid receptor movement through the cytoplasm of the physiologically normal cell. The observations represented in this paper and those of Galigniana et al. (19Galigniana M.D. Scruggs J.L. Herrington J. Welsh M.J. Carter-Su C. Housley P.R. Pratt W.B. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1903-1913Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) suggest that there are two movement mechanisms and that intact cytoskeleton is required for GR movement in the physiologically normal cell."

We identified a msh6 mutation (msh6-F337A) that when overexpressed in wild type strains conferred a defect in both MSH2-MSH6- and MSH2-MSH3-dependent mismatch repair pathways. Genetic analysis suggested that this phenotype was due to msh6-F337A sequestering MSH2 and preventing it from interacting with MSH3 and MSH6. In UV cross-linking, filter binding, and gel retardation assays, the MSH2-msh6-F337A complex displayed a mismatch recognition defect. These observations, in conjunction with ATPase and dissociation rate analysis, suggested that MSH2-msh6-F337A formed an unproductive complex that was unable to stably bind to mismatch DNA.

DNA mismatches can arise through DNA replication errors, physical damage, and heteroduplex formation during genetic recombination. If left unrepaired, these mismatches become fixed in the genome as mutations. The best understood mismatch repair system is theEscherichia coli mutHLS long-patch repair pathway (1Modrich P. Lahue R.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 101-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (1318) Google Scholar). A model for the initiation of mismatch repair by MutH, MutL, and MutS immediately after passage of a DNA replication fork has been developed based upon in vivo studies and an in vitromismatch repair system reconstituted from purified components (1Modrich P. Lahue R.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 101-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (1318) Google Scholar, 2Lahue R.S. Au K.G. Modrich P.

In this model, a mismatch is first recognized and bound by a dimer of MutS that displays an intrinsic ATPase activity. In a reaction that requires ATP, a dimer of MutL binds to MutS and then activates the methylation sensitive endonuclease MutH. Activation of MutH results in cleavage of the unmethylated DNA strand at hemimethylated d(GATC) sites that are transiently present after replication fork passage, providing an entry point for excision and replication proteins to remove the mismatch and repair the resulting DNA gap using the parental DNA strand as a template.The ability of MutS to both recognize base pair mismatches and trigger downstream events that can be located several kilobases away from a mismatch site suggests that it can bind to DNA in at least two different modes. The first mode allows mismatch recognition, and the second mode allows MutS protein to use the energy of ATP hydrolysis to translocate along DNA with MutL so that it can activate MutH at GATC sites (1Modrich P. Lahue R.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 101-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (1318) Google Scholar, 7Allen D.J. Makhov A. Grilley M. Taylor J. Thresher R. Modrich P. Griffith J.D.

Support for the presence of multiple MutS DNA binding modes was initially obtained from DNA binding assays showing that MutS protein can specifically recognize base pair mismatches in the absence of ATP and that the addition of ATP resulted in the loss of mismatch binding specificity (8Grilley M. Welsh K.M. Su S.-S. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 1000-1004Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). An elegant electron microscopy analysis performed by the Griffith laboratory (7Allen D.J. Makhov A. Grilley M. Taylor J. Thresher R. Modrich P. Griffith J.D.

Chem. 1998; 273: 32055-32062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) provides further evidence for this idea. They showed that MutS can form ATP-dependent loop structures on DNA substrates that contain a mismatch site. The size of loop was dependent on incubation time and the presence of a mismatch site. They hypothesized that MutS can bind to a mismatch substrate in an ATP independent step. After recognition, a second binding mode is activated through an ATP-dependent conformational change in MutS resulting in the loss of its mismatch recognition functions and a shift into a mode that allows it to bidirectionally translocate along DNA away from a mismatch site. This activity results in the formation of loop structures that are thought to serve as topological intermediates for strand excision and allow MutS to scan along DNA until it identifies and activates MutH bound at GATC sites.At present, little is known about which domains in MutS are important for mismatch recognition. Recently, a DNA cross-linking analysis performed by Malkov et al. (10Malkov V.A. Biswas I. Camerini-Otero R.D. Hsieh P. J. Biol Chem. 1997; 272: 23811-23817Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) revealed that the phenylalanine 39 residue in Thermus aquaticus MutS was critical for photocross-linking of MutS to a mismatch substrate. They also showed that a mutant derivative of MutS, mutS-F39A, displayed a reduced affinity for mismatch substrate. Although this study identified a domain that is important for mismatch recognition, it did not address whether this domain functions in general DNA binding and/or in mismatch binding and whether it functions during one or more DNA binding modes.Whereas studies in bacteria have greatly increased our understanding of mismatch repair, analogous repair systems in eukaryotes appear to be more complex (1Modrich P. Lahue R.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 101-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (1318) Google Scholar, 11Kolodner R. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1433-1442Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar, 12Crouse G.F.

Several homologs of mutS andmutL have been identified in eukaryotic organisms. A feature of the MutS homologs is they all contain a highly conserved ATP binding domain. In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, sixmutS homologs and four mutL homologs have been identified, and the gene products of the MSH2, MSH3, MSH6, MLH1, and PMS1 genes have been identified as components of nuclear mismatch repair. Several studies have suggested that during mismatch recognition, MSH2 acts a scaffold for mismatch binding, whereas MSH6 and MSH3 act as specificity factors (13Alani E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5604-5615Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 14Marsischky G.T. Filosi N. Kane M.F. Kolodner R.

This hypothesis was based on genetic studies showing that msh2mutants are defective in the repair of both base pair and loop insertion/deletion mismatches, whereas msh3 mutants are principally defective in the repair of 2–4-nucleotide loop mismatches and msh6 mutants are principally defective in the repair of base-base and single nucleotide insertion/deletion mismatches (14Marsischky G.T.

Interestingly, MSH3 and MSH6 functions have been shown to overlap, as msh3 and msh6 single mutants do not display as strong a defect in mismatch repair in their respective mismatch repair assays as do msh2 mutants. msh3 msh6 double mutants, however, display a mutator phenotype that is identical to that observed in msh2 mutants (14Marsischky G.T.

Subsequent biochemical studies have shown that MSH2 can interact with MSH3 and MSH6 to form distinct complexes that bind subsets of mismatches predicted by the genetic studies and that an MLH1-PMS1 heterodimer can interact with these complexes when they are bound to a mismatch site (13Alani E.

Based on the pioneering studies performed by Malkov et al. (10Malkov V.A. Biswas I. Camerini-Otero R.D. Hsieh P. J. Biol Chem. 1997; 272: 23811-23817Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), we created site-specific mutations in putative DNA binding domains in the MSH2 and MSH6 subunits and examined the effect of these mutations in UV cross-linking and DNA binding studies. Our analysis, described below, is consistent with MSH2 acting primarily as a scaffold for interactions with MSH6 and MSH3 that confer specificity to mismatch recognition. Interestingly, a mutation in MSH6 (msh6-F337A) was identified that conferred a dominant negative phenotype that was consistent with msh6-F337A sequestering MSH2 from functioning in mismatch recognition. This analysis also suggested that subunit interactions, mismatch recognition functions, and ATPase activities are coordinated to allow for the recognition and repair of DNA mismatches. DNA mismatches can arise through DNA replication errors, physical damage, and heteroduplex formation during genetic recombination. If left unrepaired, these mismatches become fixed in the genome as mutations. The best understood mismatch repair system is theEscherichia coli mutHLS long-patch repair pathway (1Modrich P.

Several studies have suggested that during mismatch recognition, MSH2 acts a scaffold for mismatch binding, whereas MSH6 and MSH3 act as specificity factors (13Alani E. Mol. Cell.

This hypothesis was based on genetic studies showing that msh2mutants are defective in the repair of both base pair and loop insertion/deletion mismatches, whereas msh3 mutants are principally defective in the repair of 2–4-nucleotide loop mismatches and msh6 mutants are principally defective in the repair of base-base and single nucleotide insertion/deletion mismatches (14Marsischky G.T.

Interestingly, MSH3 and MSH6 functions have been shown to overlap, as msh3 and msh6 single mutants do not display as strong a defect in mismatch repair in their respective mismatch repair assays as do msh2 mutants. msh3 msh6 double mutants, however, display a mutator phenotype that is identical to that observed in msh2 mutants (14Marsischky G.T.

Subsequent biochemical studies have shown that MSH2 can interact with MSH3 and MSH6 to form distinct complexes that bind subsets of mismatches predicted by the genetic studies and that an MLH1-PMS1 heterodimer can interact with these complexes when they are bound to a mismatch site (13Alani E.

In this study, we used genetic and biochemical assays to investigate the mismatch recognition properties of MSH2-MSH6. Based on the pioneering studies performed by Malkov et al. (10Malkov V.A. Biswas I. Camerini-Otero R.D. Hsieh P. J. Biol Chem. 1997; 272: 23811-23817Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), we created site-specific mutations in putative DNA binding domains in the MSH2 and MSH6 subunits and examined the effect of these mutations in UV cross-linking and DNA binding studies. Our analysis, described below, is consistent with MSH2 acting primarily as a scaffold for interactions with MSH6 and MSH3 that confer specificity to mismatch recognition. Interestingly, a mutation in MSH6 (msh6-F337A) was identified that conferred a dominant negative phenotype that was consistent with msh6-F337A sequestering MSH2 from functioning in mismatch recognition. This analysis also suggested that subunit interactions, mismatch recognition functions, and ATPase activities are coordinated to allow for the recognition and repair of DNA mismatches.

https://openalex.org/W2036793573,"Oxygen free radicals oxidize arachidonic acid to a complex mixture of metabolites termed isoeicosanoids that share structural similarity to enzymatically derived eicosanoids. However, little is known about oxidations of arachidonic acid mediated by reactive radical nitrogen oxides. We have studied the reaction of arachidonic acid with NO2, a free radical generated by nitric oxide and nitrite oxidations. A major group of products appeared to be a mixture of arachidonic acid isomers having onetrans-bond and three cis-double bonds. We have termed these new products trans-arachidonic acids. These isomers were chromatographically distinct from arachidonic acid and produced mass spectra that were nearly identical with mass spectra of arachidonic acid. The lack of ultraviolet absorbance above 205 nm and the similarity of mass spectra of dimethyloxazoline derivatives suggested that the trans-bond was not conjugated with any of the cis-bonds, and the C=C bonds were located at carbons 5, 8, 11, and 14. Further identification was based on comparison of chromatographic properties with synthetic standards and revealed that NO2 generated 14-trans-eicosatetraenoic acid and a mixture containing 11-trans-, 8-trans-, and 5-trans-eicosatetraenoic acids. Exposure of human platelets to submicromolar levels of NO2 resulted in a dose-dependent formation of 14-trans-eicosatetraenoic acid and other isomers within platelet glycerophospholipids. Using a sensitive isotopic dilution assay we detected trans-arachidonic acids in human plasma (50.3 ± 10 ng/ml) and urine (122 ± 50 pg/ml). We proposed a mechanism of arachidonic acid isomerization that involves a reversible attachment of NO2 to a double bond with formation of a nitroarachidonyl radical. Thus, free radical processes mediated by NO2 lead to generation of trans-arachidonic acid isomers, including biologically active 14-trans-eicosatetraenoic acid, within membrane phospholipids from which they can be released and excreted into urine.

Arachidonic acid is one of the most abundant polyunsaturated fatty acids found in the cellular membrane phospholipid bilayer. A characteristic structural feature of this fatty acid is a 20-carbon chain containing four cis-double bonds that form a molecule of 5Z,8Z,11Z,14Z-eicosatetraenoic acid. These double bonds are homoconjugated resulting in threebis-allylic methylene groups. Abstraction of a single hydrogen from one of these methylene groups via a homolytic cleavage of a C–H bond is a fundamental process of arachidonic acid metabolism by enzymatic as well as nonenzymatic reactions. Enzymatic processes lead to a family of biologically active lipids such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes, known collectively as the eicosanoids (1Samuelsson B. Z. Rheumatol. 1991; 50 (Suppl. 1): 3-6PubMed Google Scholar). Syndromes of oxidative stress elevate levels of free radicals that can directly target arachidonic acid bound to phospholipids. This generates a complex mixture of oxidized products, known as isoeicosanoids, that can be cleaved off by phospholipases, circulated, and excreted in urine. Isoprostaglandins (2Reilly M.P. Lawson J.A. FitzGerald G.A. J. Nutr. 1998; 128 (suppl.): 434-438Crossref Google Scholar, 3Morrow J.D. Roberts L.J. Prog. Lipid Res. 1997; 36: 1-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar) and isoleukotrienes (4Harrison K.A. Murphy R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17273-17278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) are structurally similar to the native eicosanoids, and some of them display potent biological activity. Hydroxyl radical is a potent activator of polyunsaturated fatty acid peroxidation due to its high intrinsic oxidation potential. The oxidations of fatty acids are somehow limited by its short reactive half-life (∼10−9 s) and occur at the diffusion controlled rates within a close distance to the site of OH radical formation. Relatively less is known about transformations of polyunsaturated fatty acids induced by free radical nitrogen oxides. Nitric oxide reacts very slowly with olefins but quite fast with lipid peroxy and alkoxy radicals, which leads to unstable nitro and oxonitro derivatives of linoleic and linolenic acids, and by this mechanism nitric oxide is thought to terminate progression of lipid peroxidation (5Rubbo H. Radi R. Trujillo M. Telleri R. Kalyanaraman B. Barnes S. Kirk M. Freeman B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26066-26075Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). NO2 is a toxic free radical found in biological systems as a product of spontaneous oxidation of NO and enzymatic oxidations of nitrite (6van der Vliet A. Eiserich J.P. Halliwell B. Cross C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7617-7625Crossref PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar). NO2 is also an air pollutant and has been implicated to cause pulmonary edema and fibrosis, bronchitis, asthma, and possibly cancer (7Environmental Health Criteria 188 Nitrogen Oxides. World Health Organization, Geneva1997Google Scholar). NO2 is a potent oxidant that causes lipid peroxidation (8Pryor W.A. Lightsey J.W. Science. 1981; 214: 435-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 9Gallon A.A. Pryor W.A. Lipids. 1994; 29: 171-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar); however, the reaction of NO2 with arachidonic acid has not been characterized. Oxidation of nitric oxide to NO2 is significantly accelerated within the hydrophobic phase of cellular phospholipid bilayer (10Liu X. Miller M.S. Joshi M.S. Thomas D.D. Lancaster Jr., J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2175-2179Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar). This intramembrane reaction is facilitated by the much higher solubility of nitric oxide in hydrophobic layer of phospholipids than in the aqueous phase. Thus, it is possible that a significant amount of NO2 may be formed under aerobic conditions within the cellular phospholipid bilayer. These observations raise the possibility of novel nonenzymatic, free radical pathways involved in arachidonate transformations by NO2. In this study, we established the chemical structures of major products formed from this reaction, and we found that the predominant process mediated by NO2 leads to a new group of lipids, which we have termedtrans-arachidonic acids. Arachidonic acid was from Sigma. [1-14C]Arachidonic acid (specific activity, 57 Ci/mmol) was from NEN Life Science Products. [5,6,8,9,11,12,14,15-d8]Arachidonic acid (isotopic purity, >98%) was from Biomol (Plymouth Meeting, MI). Nitrogen dioxide was from Matheson (E. Rutherford, NJ). All solvents were of highest chromatographic grade. In a typical experiment, arachidonic acid (100 μg) was dissolved in 1 ml of hexane, and sodium arachidonate (100 μg) was dissolved in 1 ml of phosphate buffer (0.5 mm, pH 7.4). d8-Archidonic acid (10 μg) was mixed with [1-14C]arachidonic acid (10,000 cpm) and was used to prepare the internal standards for quantitative analyses. Nitrogen dioxide was prepared shortly before reaction with arachidonic acid as described (11Jiang H. Balazy M. Nitric Oxide Biol. Chem. 1998; 2: 350-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Briefly, about 1 ml of liquid was collected from the original NO2 tank. NO2 gas was delivered into arachidonate solutions either via bubbling using helium as a carrier gas (∼0.1 ml/min) or was sampled using a 50-μl gas-tight syringe. The final concentrations of NO2 were 43–430 μm. The reaction was carried for additional 3–5 min, and the lipids were isolated by extraction with organic solvents. The extracts were dissolved in small volume of methanol and analyzed by HPLC. 1The abbreviations used are: HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; PTSA, para-toluenesulfinic acid; PFB, pentafluorobenzyl; DMOX, 4,4-dimethyloxazoline; TMS, trimethylsilyl; GC/MS, gas chromatography/mass spectrometry; EET, epoxyeicosatrienoic acid(s); AA, arachidonic acid. In some experiments the lipid extracts were treated with sodium borohydride to reduce hydroperoxides. PTSA was prepared from its sodium salt (Aldrich) as described (12Kice J.L. Bowers K.W. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1962; 84: 605-610Crossref Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Briefly, the PTSA sodium salt (5 g) was dissolved in water (5 ml) and acidified with 6n H2SO4. The precipitated sulfinic acid was filtered, washed with ice-cold water and hexane, and dried. An equimolar amount of PTSA was added to arachidonic acid in dry tetrahydrofuran, and the reaction was carried out at 100 °C for 40 min. The solvent was evaporated under nitrogen, the residue was mixed with water, and lipids were extracted with ethyl acetate. The extract was dried and analyzed by HPLC. HPLC analyses were performed on a HP1050 system (Hewlett-Packard) using C18 column (250 × 4.6 mm, Beckman Instruments). Samples were eluted with a gradient of acetonitrile in water (62.5% increased to 100% in 60 min), and the effluent was analyzed by an on-line UV diode array detector. Fractions were collected by a Gilson FC 203B fraction collector. In the experiments where [1-14C]arachidonic acid was used as a substrate for NO2, the effluent was also analyzed by the on-line radioactivity monitor to detect radiolabeled products. Pentafluorobenzyl (PFB) and methyl esters were prepared as described (13Balazy M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23561-23567Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Dimethyloxazoline (DMOX) derivatives were prepared as described (14Zhang J.Y. Yu Q.T. Liu B.N. Huang Z.H. Biol. Environ. Mass Spectrom. 1988; 15: 33-44Crossref Scopus (142) Google Scholar) by treatment of fatty acids with 50 μl of 2-amino-2-methylpropanol (Aldrich) in a microvial at 150 °C for 1 h. After cooling, samples were dried under a stream of nitrogen, mixed with water, extracted with ethyl acetate, and finally purified by HPLC. The DMOX derivatives of compound I and arachidonic acid eluted at 28 and 23.5 min, respectively.N,O-Bis(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide was used to convert hydroxyl groups into trimethylsilyl (TMS) derivatives. Samples were finally dissolved in n-decane, and 1-μl aliquots were analyzed by GC/MS. The samples were hydrogenated by bubbling hydrogen gas through a solution of esterified samples of compounds I and II in hexane containing catalytic amounts of rhodium adsorbed on alumina (∼1 mg) as described (15Balazy M. Murphy R.C. Anal. Chem. 1986; 58: 1098-1101Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Electrospray tandem mass spectrometric analyzes were performed on an Esquire ion trap instrument (Brucker Daltonics, Billerica, MA). Samples (1 μg/ml) were injected using a syringe pump into a mass spectrometer operating in the negative ion polarity with a capillary exit voltage of −65 V, a skimmer voltage of −26 V, a nebulizer pressure of 16.2 psi, and a dry gas temperature of 352 °C. GC/MS analyses were performed on an HP 5890A instrument (Hewlett-Packard). Samples were analyzed using a DB-1 fused silica gas chromatographic column (10 m, 0.25-mm internal diameter, 0.25-μm film thickness, J and W Scientific, Folsom, CA) and a temperature program of 150 °C (held for 1 min after injection) to 250 °C at a rate of 8 °C/min. The temperature of the injector, transfer line and ion source was 250 °C. Relative retention times (C values) were established from a plot of retention time of a series of saturated fatty acids (PFB or methyl ester derivatives) versus their carbon chain length (18–24 carbons). The regression analysis produced a formula for a correlation line (r 2 = 0.999) that allowed conversion of retention times of analyzed compounds into their C values. Epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EET) were prepared from arachidonic acid andm-chloroperoxybenzoic acid as described (16Balazy M. Nies A.S. Biomed. Environ. Mass Spectrom. 1989; 18: 328-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). 14,15-EET and, separately, a mixture of 5,6-, 8,9-, and 11,12-EET (200–400 μg) were dissolved in dry tetrahydrofuran (100 μl) and mixed with a solution of triphenylphosphine in terahydrofuran (final concentration 0.1 mm) (17Wittig G. Haag W. Chem. Ber. 1955; 88: 1654-1661Crossref Scopus (286) Google Scholar). The reaction was carried out in a glass tube, under nitrogen, in a block heated to 100 °C for 40 min. The products were extracted with ethyl acetate and purified by HPLC. 5Z,8Z,11Z,14E-eicosatetraenoic acid (14E-AA) was synthesized as described (18Berdeaux O. Vatèle J.-M. Eynard T. Nour M. Poullain D. Noël J.-P. Sébédio J.-L. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1995; 78: 71-80Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Briefly, this synthesis involved a Wittig reaction between (Z)-7-(t-butyldiphenylsilyloxy)hept-3-enal and the ylide of (3Z,6E)-dodeca-3,6-dienyl-triphenylphosphonium bromide. The C19 tetraenoic ether was isolated and transformed in three steps to a methyl ester of 14E-AA in 81% overall yield (18Berdeaux O. Vatèle J.-M. Eynard T. Nour M. Poullain D. Noël J.-P. Sébédio J.-L. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1995; 78: 71-80Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The 14E-AA methyl ester was hydrolyzed with lithium hydroxide (0.1 n) in tetrahydrofuran/water (10:1). The stereoisomeric purity of 14E-AA (PFB derivative) was >99% as established by GC/MS. A concentrate of fresh human platelets was obtained from Hudson Valley Blood Bank (Elmsford, NY), and platelet suspensions in phosphate buffer were prepared as described (13Balazy M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23561-23567Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Platelets were exposed to NO2 as described (11Jiang H. Balazy M. Nitric Oxide Biol. Chem. 1998; 2: 350-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Briefly, stirred platelet suspensions in 1 ml (6.8×109 cells/ml) of phosphate buffer (0.5 mm, pH 7.4) were mixed with NO2 solution in helium (1–20 μl; final concentration, 0.08–0.7 μm) delivered with a gas-tight syringe, and the cells were stirred for an additional 3–5 min at room temperature. Total platelet lipids were extracted with chloroform/methanol using a Bligh and Dyer protocol without acidification. The lipid extracts were dried under nitrogen and hydrolyzed in 1 n NaOH at 60 °C for 2 h. Fatty acids were then extracted with ethyl acetate. Prior to hydrolysis, 5 ng of d8-trans-arachidonic acids was added as internal standard. Lipids were purified by HPLC, and the fractions containing trans-arachidonic acids were collected and dried. The residue was derivatized with PFB bromide and analyzed by GC/MS. Ions at m/z 303 and 311, corresponding to endogenous trans-arachidonic acids and deuterium-labeled internal standard, were monitored. The amount of thetrans-arachidonic acids formed in human platelets following exposure to NO2 was calculated from a standard curve. Plasma samples (250 μl) were prepared from blood of four healthy donors who have not taken any medication and were supplemented with 1 ng of deuterium-labeledtrans-arachidonic acids. The samples were mixed with methanol (1.25 ml) and centrifuged. The methanolic solution was evaporated to near dryness, dissolved in 1 ml of water, and extracted with ethyl acetate. The lipid extracts were purified by HPLC and analyzed by GC/MS as described above. Urine samples from three healthy donors (10 ml) were supplemented with 5 ng of deuterium-labeledtrans-arachidonic acids and equilibrated at room temperature for 20 min. Lipids were extracted using ToxElute 3210 columns (Varian) and methylene chloride. The extracts were purified by HPLC and analyzed by GC/MS as described above. Arachidonic acid reacted readily with NO2 in a dose-dependent manner generating two major compounds (I and II) and a complex mixture of less abundant products (Fig.1). Compounds I and II eluted after the peak of arachidonic acid, suggesting that they were relatively less polar than arachidonic acid. Purified material in peaks I and II did not show UV light absorbance above 205 nm. TableI shows that compounds I and II accounted for 57.3% of total products when the reaction was carried out in hexane and for 18.3% when the reaction was carried out in phosphate buffer. The combined yield of other metabolites was 11–35% of the total NO2-derived arachidonate products. Similar chromatograms were obtained when NO2 was either injected or bubbled through a solution of arachidonic acid. Removal of oxygen from arachidonic acid solutions prior to addition of NO2increased the relative intensity of peaks I and II by about 15%. Addition of catalytic amounts of copper chloride had no effect on the formation of compounds I and II. A similar profile of metabolites was obtained from the treatment of arachidonyl phosphatidylcholine with NO2 in phosphate buffer followed by a mild alkaline hydrolysis (not shown).Table IRelative abundance of products generated from the reaction of nitrogen dioxide with arachidonic acidSolventCompound ICompound IIOxidized productsHexane57.67.235.1Phosphate buffer18.33.211.1Shown are the percentages of total peak area of products absorbing at 205 nm from chromatograms obtained by HPLC analyses as shown in Fig. 1(n = 2–5). Compounds I and II were identified as a mixture of arachidonic acid isomers having one or moretrans-double bonds, whereas oxidized products contained prostaglandin F, hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids, epoxyeicosatrienoic acids, nitrohydroxyeicosatrienoic acids, and nitroeicosatetraenoic acids. Open table in a new tab Shown are the percentages of total peak area of products absorbing at 205 nm from chromatograms obtained by HPLC analyses as shown in Fig. 1(n = 2–5). Compounds I and II were identified as a mixture of arachidonic acid isomers having one or moretrans-double bonds, whereas oxidized products contained prostaglandin F, hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids, epoxyeicosatrienoic acids, nitrohydroxyeicosatrienoic acids, and nitroeicosatetraenoic acids. Electrospray mass spectrometry of compounds I and II produced strong anions at m/z 303. Collisional activation of ionm/z 303 revealed major fragment ions atm/z 285 (loss of H2O), 259 (loss of CO2), and 205 (loss of C7H14) (Fig.1). GC/MS analyses of compounds I and II (PFB derivatives) produced prominent ions at m/z 303 and revealed a characteristic pattern of peaks having retention time 0.1–0.45 min longer than the PFB ester of arachidonic acid (Fig.2). This retention time difference corresponded to an increase of C value by 0.3–0.5 relative to arachidonic acid (21.3). The mass spectrometric data suggested that compounds I and II contained several isomers having the molecular mass of 304 units and were likely to be isomers of arachidonic acid having altered double bond location and/or configuration. Catalytic reduction of I and II with hydrogen gas and rhodium revealed a single chromatographic peak showing a mass spectrum with an ion atm/z 311. Thus, reduction of double bonds in I and II produced a compound indistinguishable from saturated arachidonic acid, eicosanoic acid. The location of C=C bonds in compound I was established by GC/MS analysis of DMOX derivatives. These derivatives have been useful in establishing the double bond position in fatty acids (14Zhang J.Y. Yu Q.T. Liu B.N. Huang Z.H. Biol. Environ. Mass Spectrom. 1988; 15: 33-44Crossref Scopus (142) Google Scholar), including arachidonic acid (19Ratnayake W.M. Chen Z.Y. Pelletier G. Weber D. Lipids. 1994; 29: 707-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The DMOX derivative of compound I eluted at the relative retention time (C value) of 21.66, e.g. 0.33 units more than the DMOX derivative of arachidonic acid. The spectra contained ions characteristic for DMOX derivatives atm/z 113 (base peak) and 126, and the molecular ion appeared at m/z 357. The location of the C=C bonds was established by analysis of mass differences in a series of characteristic ions. Sequential cleavage of each of the carbon-carbon bonds directed by the ionized dimethyloxazoline moiety led to a series of ions differing by 14 units (CH2). An advance by 26 units (CH=CH) occurred when the carbon of a double bond was encountered. The ions critical for establishing C=C bond location in compound I are summarized in Table II. The mass spectra revealed no essential differences between compound I and arachidonic acid, suggesting that the double bonds in compound I were located at the same carbons as in arachidonic acid, e.g. at carbons 5, 8, 11, and 14. To confirm that compounds I and II containedtrans-double bonds, arachidonic acid was reacted with PTSA, a compound known to induce acis-trans-isomerization of olefins and methyl linoleate (20Gibson T.W.

PTSA generated compounds that were detected after the peak of arachidonic acid and appeared to have chromatographic (Fig.3) and mass spectrometric (Fig.4) properties very similar to those of compounds I and II obtained from the NO2/arachidonic acid reaction.Table IIComparison of mass spectra of arachidonic acid and compound ICompound I m/z (intensity)Arachidonic acidm/z (intensity)140 (1.1)140 (1.1)166 (11.8)166 (10.3)180 (4.9)180 (3.7)206 (6.7)206 (6.0)220 (4.6)220 (4.9)246 (8.2)246 (6.6)260 (1.4)260 (1.6)286 (2.5)286 (2.3)357 (5.8)aMolecular ion.357 (3.9)aMolecular ion.Shown are the dimethyloxazoline derivatives.

Intensity is relative to ion m/z 113. Standard samples of trans-arachidonic acid isomers were prepared form arachidonate epoxides (EET) by reaction with triphenylphosphine in tetrahydrofuran. 14E-AA prepared from 14,15-EET as well as via full synthesis (18Berdeaux O. Vatèle J.-M. Eynard T. Nour M. Poullain D. Noël J.-P. Sébédio J.-L. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1995; 78: 71-80Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar) coeluted with the product of the NO2/arachidonic acid (Figs. 3 and 4). A mixture of three arachidonate epoxides (11,12-, 8,9- and 5,6-EET) treated with triphenylphosphine showed a product at 11.6 min, which had the same retention time as a broadened peak from the NO2/archidonic acid reaction (Fig. 4). Coelution experiments were performed by mixing the synthetic 14E-AA with product I obtained either from the reaction with NO2 or PTSA followed by GC/MS analyses. These experiments resulted in selective increases of the intensity of the peak eluting at 11.35 min. The symmetrical shape of this peak suggested that the synthetic 14E-AA was not separable from the 11.35-min isomer of compound I (not shown). The C value differences and the reduction to eicosanoic acid were consistent with transrather than branched isomers of arachidonic acid. Thus, by comparison of chromatographic and mass spectroscopic properties, we identified a major product of arachidonic acid/NO2 reaction as a mixture of four mono trans-arachidonic acids (SchemeFSI). Mass spectra of material in fractions eluting at 8–10 min (Fig. 1) revealed a compound having molecular mass of 367 units that is likely to have nitro and hydroxyl groups attached to the arachidonyl chain. Mass spectrum of a major component (PFB and TMS derivative) revealed ions at m/z 438 (M-PFB, relative abundance 100%), 391 (M-PFB-HNO2, 2%), 348 (M-PFB-TMSOH, 38%), and 301 (m/z 348-HNO2, 1%). Electron ionization mass spectrum of this derivative revealed characteristic ions at m/z 619 (M+, 1.4%), 572 (M+-HNO2, 1%), 529 (M+-TMSOH, 10%), 232 (M+-NO2CHCH(OTMS)C5H11, 9%), 173 (TMSOCH(CH2)4CH3, 29%), and 181 (C6F5CH2+, 100%) (not shown). This spectrum was consistent with the structure of 14-nitro-15-hydroxy-eicosatrienoic acid. Minor products of the NO2/arachidonic acid reaction were identified as having structures consistent with isomers of hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids, EET, prostaglandin F, and nitroeicosatetraenoic acids and were not analyzed further. Development of a sensitive quantitative assay enabled us to investigate the occurrence of trans-arachidonic acids in cells exposed to NO2 and in vivo. Analyses of human platelets exposed to NO2 (0.08–0.7 μm) revealed that trans-arachidonic acids were formed within platelets in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.5). The arachidonic acid isomers from platelets coeluted with deuterium-labeled and synthetictrans-arachidonic acids standards. NO2 induced formation of 14E-AA and, relatively, 2.5-fold more of other mono trans-arachidonic acids, possibly a mixture of 11E-, 8E-, and 5E-AA. Basal levels oftrans-arachidonic acids in human platelets were 2.9–4.2 ng/106 cells. Hydrolysis of lipid extracts was essential to detect trans-arachidonic acids, indicating that these isomers were formed in esterified form, possibly from arachidonic acids bound to platelet membrane phospholipids. Human plasma levels oftrans-arachidonic acids were 50.3 ± 10 ng/ml (n = 4), whereas human urine levels were 122 ± 50 pg/ml (n = 3) (Fig.6).Figure 6Selected ion chromatograms obtained from GC/MS negative ion chemical ionization analysis oftrans-arachidonic acids in human plasma (A) and urine (B) using deuterium-labeled analogs as internal standard (ionm/z 311). Compounds were analyzed as pentafluorobenzyl esters on a 11-m GC column. Levels of the endogenous trans-isomers ranged in plasma from 22.9 to 88.8 ng/ml and in urine from 40 to 203 pg/ml. Arachidonic acid was partially removed during HPLC purifications.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Oxidations of arachidonic acid by reactive oxygen radicals generate a complex family of oxidized lipids known as isoeicosanoids. Initially formed arachidonate hydroperoxy radicals or hydroperoxides have been detected as intermediate products in formation of isoprostanoids and isoleukotrienes. We describe here a new unique family of free radical-generated lipids derived from NO2-mediated isomerization of the arachidonic acid double bonds that does not appear to involve hydroperoxides. Formation oftrans-arachidonic acids within cellular membranes is a new aspect of NO2 biochemistry and may have profound influence on cellular membrane properties. Several isomers having distinct chromatographic mobility were observed and appeared to have onetrans-bond and three cis-bonds. Thus, four such isomers of arachidonic acid can potentially be generated (Scheme FSI). Therefore, we have termed the arachidonic acid isomers having a singletrans-double bond (E configuration) astrans-arachidonic acids. Analytical data provided evidence that NO2 changed arachidonate double bond geometry without rearrangement. Analyses by GC/MS detected one sharp peak that had the retention time identical with the synthetic 14E-AA and another, broadened peak that appeared to contain several components and coeluted with a mixture of trans-arachidonic acids prepared from epoxyeicosatrienoic acids and triphenylphosphine. NO2also caused formation of smaller amounts of material (compound II) that probably contained arachidonate isomers having more than onetrans-bond. Although the relative proportion of the arachidonate trans-isomers remains to be established, the 14E-AA was separated from arachidonic acid and othertrans-isomers on a gas capillary column. This isomer cochromatographed with two synthetic standards, and comparison of the retention times allowed identification of 14E-AA as a product from the reaction of NO2 with arachidonic acid. We observed that the profile of trans-arachidonic acids produced by NO2 was nearly identical to that from the reaction of arachidonic acid with PTSA, a reagent known to inducecis-trans-isomerization of olefins that does not rearrange double bonds (21Snyder J.M. Scholfield C.R. J. Am. Oil Chem. Soc. 1982; 50: 469-470Crossref Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Several mechanisms may be involved in the formation of atrans-bond in arachidonic acid. The similarity with PTSA product profile suggested that generation of thetrans-arachidonic acids by NO2 may occur via a free radical mechanism. It is possible that NO2 initially attaches to a double bond and forms a nitroarachidonyl radical. The rearrangement of this radical followed by elimination of NO2 is likely to form a trans-bond (Fig.7, arrow a). One piece of evidence supporting formation of the nitroarachidonyl radical comes from detection of 14-nitro-15-hydroxyeicosatrienoic acid among the products of the NO2/arachidonic acid reaction (Fig. 7). This compound may originate from trapping of oxygen to the nitroarachidonyl radical or from attachment of the second molecule of NO2. Hydrolysis of such a nitro nitrite intermediate would produce a nitro alcohol (Fig. 7, arrow b). This mechanism appears to be more likely because we noticed that nitrohydroxyarachidonic acids can be isolated without reduction of samples by sodium borohydride. The NO2-mediated isomerization of arachidonic acid appeared to be an efficient process and exceeded formation of hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acids, which accounted for only ∼5% of total products. In aerobic solutions the isomerization must compete with scavenging by oxygen. For thetrans-isomers to be formed at observed yields, the rate of rotation of the nitroarachidonyl radical and elimination of NO2 would have to be greater than attachment of oxygen to this radical. In addition, these reactions must be faster than disproportionation of NO2. According to the work by Prütz et al. (22Prütz W.A. Mönig H. Butler J. Land E.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1985; 243: 125-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar), NO2 generates arachidonate radicals with a rate (∼106m−1 s−1) that is greater than the disproportionation to nitrite and nitrate. Thus, NO2-induced cis-trans-isomerization of arachidonic acid is kinetically favorable in aerobic aqueous solutions. Studies describing the effects of NO2 on living systems have focused almost exclusively on the toxicity of inhaled NO2 (7Environmental Health Criteria 188 Nitrogen Oxides. World Health Organization, Geneva1997Google Scholar). Many of these studies have established that the toxic effects of NO2 could be correlated with increased lipid peroxidation. Our findings suggest that formation oftrans-arachidonic acids within cellular phospholipids may represent an additional aspect of NO2-induced toxicity. Increased levels of trans-arachidonic acids could contribute to changes of the membrane asymmetry and fluidity that have been noted to occur following exposure to NO2 (23Li Y.D. Patel J.M. Block E.R. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1994; 129: 114-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 24Patel J.M. Block E.R. Am. Rev. Respir. Dis. 1986; 134: 1196-1202PubMed Google Scholar). Fatty acids with trans-bonds are known to have much different physical properties, e.g. a higher melting point than analogouscis-isomers. Our data suggest that isomerization of arachidonic acid is likely to occur in biological systems following exposure to NO2, which at low concentrations exists almost exclusively as a monomer (22Prütz W.A. Mönig H. Butler J. Land E.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1985; 243: 125-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). In addition to changes of the membrane biochemistry, the free trans-arachidonic acids are likely to modulate the activity of cyclooxygenases and lipoxygenases. A recent study has described inhibition of platelet aggregation by 14E-AA that coincides with inhibition of thromboxane synthesis and generation of unique metabolites (25Berdeaux O. Chardigny J.M. Sébédio J.-L. Mairot T. Poullain D. Vatèle J.-M. Noel J.P. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 2244-2250PubMed Google Scholar). Although the origin of trans-arachidonic acids in human urine remains to be determined, by analogy to the cyclooxygenase derived prostaglandins as well as isoprostaglandins, these compounds may derive at least in part from local formation in the kidney.trans-Arachidonic acids have not been detected in human plasma previously, and their rather high concentration warrants further study. It has been known that trans-linoleic acids that are found in processed foods, hydrogenated fats, and dairy products could be desaturated and elongated to certain trans-arachidonic acids in the rat liver (19Ratnayake W.M. Chen Z.Y. Pelletier G. Weber D. Lipids. 1994; 29: 707-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). A diet enriched in fatty acids containingtrans-isomers has been suspected as a risk factor in coronary artery disease and other disorders (26Feldman E.B. Kris-Etherton P.M. Kritchevsky D. Lichtenstein A.H. Am. J. Clin. Nutr. 1996; 63: 663-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar); however, the effects of trans-fatty acids on health outcome are not fully understood (27Kritchevsky D. Prostaglandins Leukotreines Essent. Fatty Acids. 1997; 57: 399-402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 28Nelson G.J. Nutr. Rev. 1998; 56: 250-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In particular, the possibility thattrans-arachidonic acids are formed within cells via a free radical mechanism involving NO2 has not been explored. Increased amounts of trans-isomers of arachidonic acid and possibly of other polyunsaturated fatty acids may originate from inhaled as well as endogenously formed NO2. Becausetrans-fatty acids are not produced by the hydroxyl radical, the detection and quantification of trans-arachidonic acidsin vivo may be used as a specific index to assess the degree of cellular injury mediated by NO2. The present study provides a basis for such an investigation. Studies into the mechanisms of cellular activation and trans-arachidonic acids may clarify their importance in vivo in syndromes such as inflammation, thrombosis, and ischemia-reperfusion injury in which damage to cellular membrane phospholipids coincides with oxidant stress."
https://openalex.org/W2002695465,"Nek2 is a human cell cycle-regulated kinase that is structurally related to the mitotic regulator, NIMA, ofAspergillus nidulans. Localization studies have shown that Nek2 is a core component of the centrosome, the microtubule organizing center of the cell, and functional approaches suggest a possible role for Nek2 in centrosome separation at the G2/M transition. Here, we have investigated the importance of an unusual leucine zipper coiled-coil motif present in the C-terminal noncatalytic domain of the Nek2 kinase. Glycerol gradient centrifugation indicated that endogenous Nek2 is present in HeLa cells as a salt-resistant 6 S complex, the predicted size of a Nek2 homodimer. Recombinant Nek2 overexpressed in insect cells also formed a 6 S complex, whereas a Nek2 mutant specifically lacking the leucine zipper motif was monomeric. Using yeast two-hybrid interaction analyses and coprecipitation assays, we found that Nek2 can indeed form homodimers both in vivo andin vitro and that this dimerization specifically required the leucine zipper motif. Moreover, deletion of the leucine zipper prevented a trans-autophosphorylation reaction on the C-terminal domain of Nek2 and strongly reduced Nek2 kinase activity on exogenous substrates. Finally, we emphasize that the Nek2 leucine zipper described here differs from classical leucine zippers in that it exhibits a radically different arrangement of hydrophobic and charged amino acids. Thus, this study reveals not only an important mechanism for the regulation of the Nek2 kinase but, furthermore, highlights an unusual organization of a leucine zipper dimerization motif.

Thus, this study reveals not only an important mechanism for the regulation of the Nek2 kinase but, furthermore, highlights an unusual organization of a leucine zipper dimerization motif. Human Nek2 belongs to a family of serine/threonine protein kinases structurally related to the NIMA mitotic regulator of the filamentous fungus, Aspergillus nidulans. NIMA is the product of a gene that, when mutated, leads to a block of cells in the G2phase of the cell cycle and, when overexpressed, drives cells into a premature mitosis from any point in the cell cycle (1Morris N.R. Genet. Res. Camb. 1976; 26: 237-254Crossref Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 2Osmani S.A. Pu R.T. Morris N.R. Cell. 1988; 53: 237-244Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). However, as physiological substrates of NIMA remain to be identified, the precise mechanism by which NIMA contributes to promote mitosis is unknown. Proteins related to Aspergillus NIMA have been found in a broad variety of species including yeast, trypanosomes, flies, and mammals (reviewed in Ref. 3Fry A.M. Nigg E.A. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 283: 270-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In humans, at least sixNIMA-related kinases or “Neks” have so far been isolated as full-length or partial sequences (4Schultz S.J. Nigg E.A. Cell Growth Differ. 1993; 4: 821-830PubMed Google Scholar, 5Schultz S.J. Fry A.M. Sütterlin C. Ried T. Nigg E.A. Cell Growth Differ. 1994; 5: 625-635PubMed Google Scholar, 6Levedakou E.N. He M.

Guidet S. Tung H.Y.L. Progress in Cell Cycle Research. 1. Plenum Press, New York1995: 187-205Google Scholar), and it is possible that these may function in different stages of the cell cycle or in different tissues. To date, the closest mammalian relative of NIMA is Nek2 (5Schultz S.J. Fry A.M. Sütterlin C. Ried T. Nigg E.A. Cell Growth Differ. 1994; 5: 625-635PubMed Google Scholar). Activity measurements indicate that Nek2 is a cell cycle-regulated kinase with maximal activity in S and G2 phases of the cell cycle (8Fry A.M. Schultz S.J. Bartek J. Nigg E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12899-12905Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Moreover, expression studies reveal that Nek2 is most abundant in meiotic, as well as mitotic, tissues (9Rhee K. Wolgemuth D.J. Development. 1997; 124: 2167-2177Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Tanaka K. Parvinen M. Nigg E.A. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 237: 264-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 11Arama E. Yanai A. Kilfin G. Bernstein A. Motro B. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 1813-1823Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), strengthening the hypothesis that Nek2, like NIMA, has a function in cell cycle progression. Recent work has revealed a potential role for Nek2 at the centrosome, the major microtubule-organizing center of the cell (12Fry A.M. Meraldi P. Nigg E.A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 470-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). Subcellular localization studies indicate that Nek2 is a core component of the centrosome, in that its centrosomal localization is independent of microtubules. Moreover, ectopic expression of active, but not inactive, Nek2 kinase in human tissue culture cells induces a striking splitting of the two centrosomes, raising the possibility that Nek2 might normally function to promote the separation of centrosomes at the G2 to M transition that is necessary for formation of a bipolar mitotic spindle (12Fry A.M. Meraldi P. Nigg E.A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 470-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). In particular, Nek2 activity might induce the dissolution or degradation of components that are required for cohesion of the two centrosomes during interphase. Intriguingly, a novel component of the centrosome has been identified through interaction with Nek2 that displays several properties of a protein predicted to be involved in centrosome-centrosome cohesion (13Fry A.M. Mayor T. Meraldi P. Stierhof Y.-D. Tanaka K. Nigg E.A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1563-1574Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). This protein, called C-Nap1, for centrosomalNek2-associated protein1, is a high molecular weight protein with extensive coiled-coil domains and most likely functions as a structural component of the centrosome. The C-terminal domain of C-Nap1 can be phosphorylated by Nek2 both in vitro and in vivo, suggesting that C-Nap1 is a bona fide centrosomal substrate of the Nek2 kinase. Finally, in support of a model implicating C-Nap1 in centrosome-centrosome cohesion, C-Nap1was found to be present within interphase centrosomes but absent from mitotic spindle poles (13Fry A.M. Mayor T. Meraldi P. Stierhof Y.-D. Tanaka K. Nigg E.A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1563-1574Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). Although the identification of C-Nap1 provides a first step toward understanding what events might be downstream of the Nek2 kinase, virtually nothing is known about upstream events, i.e. how the kinase itself is regulated. Nek2 is maximally active in S and G2, and this level of activity reflects the amount of Nek2 protein present through the different stages of the cell cycle (8Fry A.M. Schultz S.J. Bartek J. Nigg E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12899-12905Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Hence, one mode of regulation is likely to occur at the level of protein abundance by means of either regulated transcription/translation or protein turnover. Equally, Nek2, like other protein kinases, may be regulated through protein-protein complex formation. Cyclin-dependent kinases, for example, are so named because of their absolute dependence upon stoichiometric complex formation with regulatory cyclin subunits. Protein interactions can regulate kinase activity in many ways including the following: (i) allosteric modulation of the kinase domain structure, (ii) blocking the interaction of a kinase inhibitor, (iii) targeting the kinase directly to its substrates, or (iv) targeting the kinase to the correct location in the cell. As a means to study the regulation of the Nek2 kinase, we set out to look for complexes of Nek2 that may indicate potential regulatory partners. In the course of these studies, we discovered that soluble Nek2 exists in cells as a highly stable homodimer and that homodimerization is dependent upon a leucine zipper coiled-coil motif present in the C-terminal noncatalytic domain of Nek2. We found that dimerization is necessary both for a trans-autophosphorylation reaction and for Nek2 kinase activity on exogenous substrates. Finally, we emphasize that the Nek2 leucine zipper has a strikingly unusual arrangement of amino acids. This highlights the sequence flexibility that is tolerated within this particular class of dimerization motifs. Human cells were grown at 37 °C in a 7% CO2 atmosphere in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with heat-inactivated serum and penicillin/streptomycin (100 IU/ml and 100 μg/ml, respectively). HeLa epithelial cells were supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum and U2OS osteosarcoma cells with 10% fetal calf serum. Sf9 insect cells were grown in TC100 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) and supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum and penicillin-streptomycin at 27 °C. For transient transfection studies, U2OS cells were seeded onto HCl-treated glass coverslips at a density of 1 × 105 cells/35-mm dish and transfected with 10 μg of plasmid DNA using calcium phosphate precipitates as described previously (14Krek W. Nigg E.A. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3331-3341Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Cells were fixed after 24 h and analyzed by indirect immunofluorescence microscopy. Cell extracts were prepared from 108 exponentially growing HeLa cells or 107 Sf9 insect cells infected with different Nek2 baculoviruses (48 h postinfection). For this purpose, both floating and adherent cells were harvested, washed once in 1 ml of ice-cold PBS 1The abbreviation used is: PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. + 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and resuspended in 0.5 ml of gradient buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 50 or 500 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm MnCl2, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin A, 50 μg/ml chymostatin, 1/100 aprotinin). Samples were left on ice for 30 min, passed 10 times through a 27-gauge needle, and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min (4 °C). Protein concentrations were measured using a Bio-Rad protein determination reagent. Cell extracts (1 mg of total protein) were loaded on the top of a 10-ml 15–50% glycerol gradient (containing 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 50 or 500 mm NaCl, 0.2 mm EDTA) and spun at 40,000 rpm, 4 °C for 24 h in a Beckman SW 40 ultracentrifuge rotor. 400-μl fractions were collected from the top of the gradient and analyzed by Western blotting for Nek2 proteins. 100 μg of chymotrypsin (25 kDa), bovine serum albumin (67 kDa, 4.3 S), aldolase (158 kDa, 7.4 S), and catalase (232 kDa, 11.3 S) were centrifuged at the same time on equivalent glycerol gradients to determine the separation of different molecular weight complexes. The position of marker proteins in different fractions was determined by silver staining of SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Western blots were performed by transfer of proteins onto nitrocellulose using a Hoefer SemiDry blotting apparatus. As primary anti-Nek2 antibodies, we used either affinity-purified R40 antibodies (12Fry A.M. Meraldi P. Nigg E.A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 470-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar) or an affinity-purified antipeptide antibody raised against residues 278–299 of human Nek2 by Zymed Laboratories Inc. (South San Francisco, CA). Both antibodies were used at 1.0 μg/ml. Blots were developed by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). To generate the leucine zipper deletion mutant, pGEM-Nek2ΔLZ, nucleotides 998–1084 of the Nek2 cDNA were removed from pGEM-Nek2 (5Schultz S.J. Fry A.M. Sütterlin C. Ried T. Nigg E.A. Cell Growth Differ. 1994; 5: 625-635PubMed Google Scholar) using theCLONTECH site-directed mutagenesis kit. The mutagenic oligonucleotide used was the 40-mer, CCAGCCCTGTATTGAGTGAGTGTGTTCGTGAGAGACTAGC, compromising 20 nucleotides on either side of the region deleted; as a selection primer, an oligonucleotide eliminating the PstI site in the pGEM multicloning site was used. This construct was Myc-tagged by excising Nek2ΔLZ on a NaeI-XbaI fragment from pGEM-Nek2ΔLZ and inserting it into SmaI-XbaI of a pBlueScript vector carrying the Myc epitope tag (15Schmidt-Zachmann M.S. Nigg E.A. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 105: 799-806Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), creating pBS-MycNek2ΔLZ. For eukaryotic expression, the in-frame Myc-Nek2ΔLZ fusion was excised as a SalI(blunted)-XbaI fragment from pBS-MycNek2ΔLZ and subcloned into pRcCMV (Invitrogen Corp.) between the HindIII (blunted) and XbaI sites to create pCMV-MycNek2ΔLZ. For generation of the Myc-tagged version of the Nek2 C-terminal domain alone, an XmnI fragment was excised from pGEM-Nek2 and subcloned into theSmaI site of pBlueScript-Myc to generate pBS-MycNek2-Cterm. The Myc-tagged fusion protein was then excised on aHindIII-XbaI fragment and subcloned into theHindIII-XbaI site of pRcCMV, creating pCMV-MycNek2-Cterm. For yeast two-hybrid assays, fusions of Nek2 to the GAL4 DNA binding domain or GAL4 activation domain were done in the pAS2 and pACT2 plasmids, respectively. Wild-type Nek2 or Nek2ΔLZ was excised on a NaeI-XbaI(blunted) fragment from pGEM-Nek2 or pGEM-Nek2ΔLZ, respectively, and inserted into theSmaI site of pAS2 to create pAS2-Nek2 and pAS2-Nek2ΔLZ. The C-terminal noncatalytic domain of Nek2 was excised on anXmnI fragment and subcloned into the SmaI site of pAS2 to create pAS2-Nek2-Cterm. Subsequently, Nek2 was cut out of pAS2-Nek2 on a NcoI-BamHI fragment and inserted into pACT2 cut with NcoI and BamHI to generate pACT2-Nek2. pAS1-SNF1 and pACT-SNF4 (also called pSE1112 and pSE1111, respectively) were gifts of S. Elledge (Baylor College, Houston, TX). To generate a baculovirus expressing the Nek2ΔLZ mutant, Nek2ΔLZ was excised from pGEM-Nek2ΔLZ on a NaeI-XbaI fragment and subcloned into pVL1392 (Pharmingen Corp.) cut withPstI (blunted) and XbaI, giving pVL1392-Nek2ΔLZ. Recombinant Nek2ΔLZ baculovirus was generated by cotransfection of pVL1392-Nek2ΔLZ and BaculoGold DNA (Pharmingen Corp.) and subsequent amplification of viral DNA. Parent plasmids, pAS2 and pACT2, and the yeast strain, Y190, for two-hybrid interaction assays were kindly provided by S. Elledge (Baylor College, Houston, TX), and interaction analyses by histidine auxotrophy selection and β-galactosidase filter lift assays were as described in Harperet al. (16Harper J.W. Adami G.R. Wei N. Keyomarsi K. Elledge S.J. Cell. 1993; 75: 805-816Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5201) Google Scholar). Quantitative measurement of β-galactosidase activity using the substrate,O-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside, was as described in Durfee et al. (17Durfee T. Becherer K. Chen P.-L. Yeh S.-H. Yang Y. Kilburn A.E. Lee W.-H. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 555-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (1295) Google Scholar). Nek2 constructs were translated in vitro using the TnT-coupled transcription/translation kit in the presence of [35S]methionine/cysteine (Expre35S35S, NEN Life Science Products) according to manufacturer's instructions (Promega Corp.). For coprecipitation experiments, reticulocyte lysates were first incubated separately for 60 min and then together for 60 min at 30 °C. Immunoprecipitation of Nek2 proteins and in vitro kinase assays was carried out exactly as described by Fry and Nigg (3Fry A.M. Nigg E.A. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 283: 270-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Samples were then processed on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and the gels were dried and exposed to x-ray film to detect 35S- or32P-labeled proteins. For antibody staining of whole cells, U2OS cells were grown on acid-treated coverslips and fixed with methanol at −20 °C for 6 min. Following fixation, coverslips were washed three times with PBS, blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 10 min, and washed again three times with PBS. All subsequent antibody incubations were carried out in PBS containing 3% bovine serum albumin. Myc-tagged proteins were detected using undiluted tissue culture supernatant from the anti-Myc monoclonal antibody 9E10 followed by fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse Fab fragment (1:100, Sigma). Centrosome staining was carried out with an anti-γ-tubulin rabbit polyclonal antibody (1.8 μg/ml IgGs) (12Fry A.M. Meraldi P. Nigg E.A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 470-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar) followed by biotinylated anti-rabbit secondary antibodies (1:50, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and Texas Red-conjugated streptavidin (1:200, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). DNA staining was carried out with Hoechst 33258 (0.2 μg/ml in PBS). Immunofluorescence microscopy was performed using a Zeiss Axioplan II microscope (Thornwood, NY) and a ×63 oil-immersion objective. Photographs were taken using a Quantix 1400 CCD camera (Photometrics, Inc., Tuscon, AZ) and IP-Lab software, and the images were processed using Adobe Photoshop (San Jose, CA). To search for potential Nek2 complexes in cells, extracts were prepared from human HeLa tissue culture cells and subjected to centrifugation for 24 h on 15–50% glycerol gradients. Western blotting with anti-Nek2 antibodies revealed that Nek2 exists as a single complex of approximately 6 S (Fig. 1 A,top panel). This complex was maintained when extracts were prepared in the presence of 500 mm NaCl, indicating that it is highly stable and resistant to electrostatic disruption (Fig.1 A, bottom panel). We then tested whether recombinant Nek2 was also present in such a complex. For this purpose, Nek2 protein was expressed from baculoviruses in insect cells, and the cell extracts were processed by centrifugation through equivalent 15–50% glycerol gradients. Western blotting of the different gradient fractions with anti-Nek2 antibodies revealed that wild-type recombinant Nek2 was also present as a 6 S complex (Fig. 1 B, top panel). β-Casein kinase assays performed on Nek2 immunoprecipitates from across the gradient confirmed the presence of Nek2 kinase activity in the same fractions as the 6 S complex (data not shown). Moreover, the 6 S complex was also observed in extracts of insect cells expressing a catalytically inactive Nek2 mutant, Nek2-K37R (8Fry A.M. Schultz S.J. Bartek J. Nigg E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12899-12905Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), indicating that Nek2 activity itself is not required for formation of the 6 S complex (data not shown). The demonstration that Nek2, a 48-kDa protein, is present in a 6 S complex, the expected size of a 100-kDa globular protein, suggested the possibility that both cellular and recombinant Nek2 preferentially form dimers. This would also explain why no monomeric Nek2 is seen upon high level overexpression in insect cells. Therefore, we analyzed the primary sequence of Nek2 for the presence of potential dimerization motifs and identified two putative coiled-coil motifs in the C-terminal noncatalytic domain, one immediately downstream of the catalytic domain and the other at the extreme C terminus (Fig.1 C, top panel). Intriguingly, the closest relatives to vertebrate Nek2, namely NIMA (A. nidulans), NIM-1 (Neurospora crassa), and Kin3p/Npk1p (Saccharomyces cerevisiae), all contain a predicted coiled-coil motif immediately downstream of the catalytic domain, despite the lack of primary sequence conservation in this region (shown for NIMA in Fig. 1 C, bottom panel; not shown for NIM-1 and Kin3p/Npk1p; see also Ref. 18Osmani S.A. Ye X.S. Biochem. J. 1996; 317: 633-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). This first coiled-coil motif in Nek2 bears a certain resemblance to a leucine zipper in so far as it contains a heptad repeat of leucine residues in position dof the coiled-coil. It is well known that coiled-coil motifs in general act as protein-protein interaction domains and that leucine zippers, in particular, allow both homo- and heterodimerization of proteins. Therefore, to experimentally address the role of this putative leucine zipper motif, we created a deletion mutant, termed Nek2ΔLZ, that entirely lacks the leucine zipper residues 306–334. Using this mutant we adopted three approaches to test whether Nek2 does indeed form dimers and whether this dimerization is dependent upon the leucine zipper motif. First, we tested whether the leucine zipper was required for formation of the 6 S complex. The Nek2ΔLZ mutant was expressed in insect cells from a recombinant baculovirus, and cell extracts were again subjected to glycerol gradient centrifugation. Western blotting of the gradient fractions with Nek2 antibodies revealed that the 6 S complex now disappeared. Instead, Nek2 reactivity was present in fractions of approximately 4 S, i.e. the size of a monomeric globular protein of 50 kDa (Fig. 1 B, bottom panel). Thus, deletion of the leucine zipper prevents recombinant Nek2 from forming the 6 S complex, apparently leaving the mutant protein as a monomer. Second, we used a yeast two-hybrid interaction assay to directly test the potential for Nek2-Nek2 interaction in vivo. For this purpose, we created double transformants of the yeast strain, Y190, containing different Nek2 constructs fused to either the GAL4 DNA binding domain or the GAL4 activation domain. A positive interaction was indicated by growth on histidine selective medium (Fig.2 A) and a blue color on a β-galactosidase filter lift assay (data not shown). When mixed with control proteins, SNF1 or SNF4, wild-type Nek2 did not activate the reporters when present either as a DNA binding domain fusion protein or an activation domain fusion protein. However, when Nek2 was placed on the two halves of the interaction system, both reporters were clearly positive, showing that Nek2 was interacting with itself (Fig.2 A). Using the Nek2ΔLZ mutant, we found that deletion of the leucine zipper from one Nek2 molecule completely abolished the interaction with a full-length Nek2 molecule. Conversely, using one full-length Nek2 molecule and one truncated Nek2 molecule containing the C-terminal noncatalytic domain alone (but including the leucine zipper), the interaction was once again restored (Fig. 2 A). The relative strength of these interactions was determined by measuring the activity of the β-galactosidase reporter in the yeast double transformants using the substrate,O-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (Fig.2 B). The Nek2-Nek2 interaction was almost 20 times stronger than the control interaction between the yeast proteins, SNF1 and SNF4 (19Fields S. Song O. Nature. 1989; 340: 245-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (4799) Google Scholar). The interaction was even stronger between full-length Nek2 and the Nek2 C-terminal domain alone, perhaps as a result of reduced steric hindrance. This assay also confirmed that deletion of the leucine zipper completely blocked the interaction, with levels of reporter activity no greater than the negative controls. Equivalent expression of the various Nek2 proteins in all double transformants was controlled by Western blotting of yeast extracts with anti-Nek2 antibodies (data not shown). Third, an in vitro coprecipitation approach was used. A Myc-tagged version of the Nek2 C-terminal domain containing the leucine zipper was transcribed and translated in vitro either alone or in combination with untagged wild-type Nek2 or untagged Nek2ΔLZ (Fig. 3, lanes 1–3). The anti-Myc monoclonal antibody, 9E10, was then used to immunoprecipitate the Myc-tagged Nek2 C-terminal domain from these mixes (Fig. 3,lanes 4–6). The untagged full-length Nek2 molecule was coprecipitated (Fig. 3, lane 5), indicating that the full-length molecule could interact with the Nek2 C-terminal domain. However, the untagged Nek2ΔLZ was not coprecipitated (Fig. 3,lane 6), confirming that this interaction required the presence of the leucine zipper. Hence, multiple approaches concur to demonstrate that the recombinant Nek2 kinase can specifically dimerize through its leucine zipper motif. We have previously noted that the Nek2 kinase is capable of autophosphorylation and that this occurs predominantly on serine residues (8Fry A.M. Schultz S.J. Bartek J. Nigg E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12899-12905Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 20Gallant P. Fry A.M. Nigg E.A. J. Cell Sci. Suppl. 1995; 19: 21-28Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Having shown that the C-terminal domain of Nek2 could coprecipitate with full-length active Nek2, we tested whether this also led to phosphorylation of the C-terminal domain by the full-length kinase. Proteins were prepared by separate in vitro translation reactions (Fig. 4, lanes 1–4) and mixed prior to immunoprecipitation with anti-Myc antibodies (Fig.4, lanes 5–8). In this experiment, all Nek2 constructs were Myc-tagged, and hence immunoprecipitation with the anti-Myc antibody led to the isolation of all in vitro translated proteins irrespective of whether or not there was an interaction between them.In vitro kinase assays were then performed on immunoprecipitates containing mixtures of wild-type or mutant Nek2 proteins (Fig. 4, lanes 9–12). We found that the Nek2 C-terminal domain construct became strongly phosphorylated when mixed with the full-length, wild-type Nek2 but not the catalytically inactive Nek2 mutant, Nek2-K37R (Fig. 4, compare lanes 10and 11). Autophosphorylation and gel retardation of the full-length Nek2 protein was also seen with the active, but not inactive, molecule. The Nek2ΔLZ mutant, which does not interact with the Nek2 C-terminal domain, caused only very minor phosphorylation of the C-terminal domain (Fig. 4, lane 12). In addition, there was an almost negligible level of autophosphorylation of the Nek2ΔLZ protein itself. These results indicate that Nek2 protein can trans-autophosphorylate on its own C-terminal domain and that this only works efficiently in the presence of an intact leucine zipper dimerization motif. We next asked whether the dimerization motif was required for either the localization of Nek2 to the centrosome or the kinase activity of Nek2 against known exogenous substrates such as β-casein (8Fry A.M. Schultz S.J. Bartek J. Nigg E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12899-12905Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). To test its subcellular localization, a Myc epitope-tagged version of the Nek2ΔLZ mutant was subcloned into a eukaryotic expression vector and transiently transfected into human U2OS osteosarcoma cells. Colocalization of anti-Myc antibodies in transfected cells with antibodies against the known centrosomal protein γ-tubulin clearly indicated that this construct could still associate with the centrosome (Fig. 5 A). Hence, the leucine zipper motif is not by itself necessary for the localization of Nek2 to the centrosome. Furthermore, this result strongly argues that deletion of the leucine zipper does not cause major unfolding of the Nek2 kinase. To determine whether the leucine zipper was required for Nek2 kinase activity, β-casein kinase assays were carried out using equal amounts of in vitro translated Nek2 proteins (Fig. 5 B,lanes 1–3). Strikingly, we found that the activity of the Nek2ΔLZ mutant was significantly reduced (at least 5-fold) as compared with the wild-type kinase (Fig. 5 B, comparelanes 5 and 6). The mutant, Nek2-K37R, containing a substitution in the nucleotide-binding motif was inactive in this assay, as expected (Fig. 5 B, lane 4). Autophosphorylation of the wild-type Nek2 protein led to both32P labeling and a reduction in its electrophoretic mobility (Fig. 5 B, lane 5). However, the Nek2ΔLZ mutant was not detectably labeled with32P and did not show any significant change in mobility, confirming our earlier results that this mutant is unable to autophosphorylate. This striking reduction in kinase activity in the Nek2ΔLZ mutant was confirmed by comparing the activity of baculovirus-expressed recombinant proteins (data not shown). However, as deletion of the leucine zipper prevents both autophosphorylation and phosphorylation of exogenous substrates, we cannot distinguish at the present time whether full activity is strictly dependent upon dimerization or autophosphorylation (or both). Traditional leucine zippers, such as those present in the bZIP transcription factors c-Myc, c-Jun, and GCN4, contain hydrophobic residues at both of the spatially adjacent positionsa and d. This allows the creation of a hydrophobic core (a, d, a′, d′) upon dimerization (21Alber T. C"
https://openalex.org/W2041111722,"Hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor (HGF/SF) is a pleiotropic effector inducing invasion and metastasis of tumor cells that express the Met tyrosine kinase receptor. One of the effectors of HGF/SF is the urokinase-type plasminogen activator, a serine protease that facilitates tumor progression and metastasis by controlling the synthesis of the extracellular matrix degrading plasmin. Stimulation of NIH 3T3 cells that were stably transfected with the human Met receptor (NIH 3T3-Methum) with HGF/SF induced a trans-activation of the urokinase promoter and urokinase secretion. Induction of the urokinase promoter by HGF/SF via the Met receptor was blocked by co-expression of a dominant-negative Grb2 and Sos1 expression construct. Further, the expression of the catalytically inactive mutants of Ha-Ras, RhoA, c-Raf, and Erk2 or addition of the Mek1-specific inhibitor PD 098059 abrogated the stimulation of the urokinase promoter by HGF/SF. A sequence residing between −2109 and −1870 base pairs (bp) was critical for stimulation of the urokinase gene by HGF/SF. Mobility shift assays with oligonucleotides spanning an AP-1 site at −1880 bp or a combined PEA3/AP-1 site at −1967 bp showed binding of nuclear factors from NIH 3T3-Methum cells. Expression of an expression plasmid that inhibits DNA binding of AP-1 proteins (A-Fos) abrogated inducible and basal activation of the urokinase promoter. Nuclear extract from unstimulated NIH 3T3-Methum cells contained more JunD and showed a stronger JunD supershift with the AP-1 oligonucleotides, compared with HGF/SF-stimulated cells. Consistent with the levels of JunD expression being functionally important for basal expression of the urokinase promoter, we found that overexpression of wild type JunD inhibited the induction of the urokinase promoter by HGF/SF. These data suggest that the induction of urokinase by HGF/SF is regulated by a Grb2/Sos1/Ha-Ras/c-Raf/RhoA/Mek1/Erk2/c-Jun-dependent mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway.

Nature. 1995; 376: 723Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Aberrant expression of HGF/SF is associated with enhanced tumor invasion and metastasis (2Jeffers M. Rong S. Vande Woude G.F. J. Mol. Med. 1996; : 505-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar) and has been shown to be a strong negative prognostic factor in human breast cancer (3Yamashita J.-I. Ogawa M. Yamashita S.-I. Nomura K. Kuramoto M. Saishoji T. Shin S. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 1630-1633PubMed Google Scholar). The receptor for HGF/SF encoded by the c-Met protooncogene (4Bottaro D.P. Rubin J. Faletto D. Chan A. Kmiecik T. Vande Woude G. Aaronson S. Science. 1991; 251: 802-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (2065) Google Scholar) is synthesized as a single polypeptide 170-kDa precursor. After glycosylation and proteolytic cleavage, the resulting dimer has a 50-kDa α-chain exposed on the cell surface. The 145-kDa β-chain spans the plasma membrane and has a kinase domain within the cytoplasmatic region (5Nakamura T. Nishizawa T. Hagiya M. Seki T. Shimonishi M. Sugimura A. Tashiro K. Shimizu S. Nature. 1989; 342: 440-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (1967) Google Scholar). Upon HGF/SF binding, the Met receptor dimerizes and becomes phosphorylated on tyrosines located in the cytoplasmatic region of the β-chain. These tyrosine residues then act as specific binding sites for adaptor proteins (6Fixman E.D. Holgado-Madruga M. Nguyen L. Kamikura D.M. Fournier T.M. Wong A.J. Park M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20167-20172Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) with Src homology 2 domains, which transmit signals intracellularly, one effector being Ras (7Hartmann G. Weidner M. Schwarz H. Birchmeier W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21936-21939Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The exact targets of HGF/SF-Met signaling downstream of Ras have not been elucidated, and it is unclear which signal transduction pathways mediate the diverse biological signals of HGF/SF.One signal transduction pathway involved in signaling through Ras or small G-proteins of the Rho family is the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade (8Hunter T. Cell. 1997; 88: 333-346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar, 9Robinson M.J. Cobb M.H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 180-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (2274) Google Scholar) that after activation assembles in sequential kinase cascades undergoing reversible phosphorylation. The best known pathway, the Ras → Raf → Mek → Erk-MAPK cascade, is typically stimulated by growth factors and mitogens such as HGF/SF, EGF, and fibroblast growth factor (8Hunter T. Cell. 1997; 88: 333-346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar). Two other MAPK pathways (p38- and Jnk-MAPK) are stimulated primarily by stress, cytokines, or hormones and require activation of a member of the Rho family, although Ras can participate. Phosphorylation of MAPKs by both tyrosine and threonine residues leads to activation of various transcription factors, including members of the AP-1 family encompassing Jun and Fos family members that can homodimerize and heterodimerize after activation (10Brown P.H. Alani R. Preis L.H. Szabo E. Birrer M.J. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 877-886PubMed Google Scholar). Fine tuning of the transcriptional response is dependent upon which member of the AP-1 family is activated. Although c-Jun has been shown to have activating properties on gene expression, binding of JunD inhibits promoter activity (11Pfarr C.M. Mechta F. Spyrou G. Lallemand D. Carrillo S. Yaniv M. Cell. 1994; 76: 747-760Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar).Because HGF/SF has been shown to be involved in tumor cell invasion and metastasis, it has been hypothesized that tumor-associated proteases might be one target of HGF/SF-Met signaling. Indeed two groups of proteases, matrix metalloproteinases (12Dunsmore S.E. Rubin J.S. Kovacs S.O. Chedid M. Parks W.C. Welgus H.G. J. Biol.

Chem. 1982; 257: 3276-3283Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) converts plasminogen into plasmin, a serine protease with broad substrate specificity toward components of the extracellular matrix including laminin, vitronectin, and fibronectin (16Dano K.

Together, these proteolytic functions facilitate the migration of tumor cells through the extracellular matrix and basement membrane barriers. Membrane attachment of urokinase to the urokinase receptor increases the rate of plasmin formation at the plasma membrane (19Ellis V. Behrendt N. Dano K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12752-12758Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and focuses proteolytic activity at the leading edge of the tumor (20Blasi F. BioEssays. 1993; 15: 105-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). High urokinase expression is correlated with a poor prognosis of patients suffering from a variety of different types of cancer including that of the breast, ovary, and lung (21Kuhn W. Schmalfeldt B.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 5009-5017Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). An additional important enhancer sequence of the urokinase promoter is a combined PEA3/AP-1 element (24Nerlov C. Rorth P. Blasi F. Johnsen M. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 1583-1593PubMed Google Scholar) homologous to the polyoma virus enhancer A element (27Martin M.E. Piette J. Yaniv M. Tang W.J. Folk W.R. Proc. Natl.

EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3371-3378Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar).Because the HGF/SF precursor protein shares a very high sequence homology with the kringle and serine protease domains of plasminogen, it was discussed whether urokinase is a putative activator of the precursor molecule HGF/SF precursor protein. Indeed, Naldini et al. (29Naldini L. Tamagnone L. Vigna E. Sachs M. Hartmann G. Birchmeier W. Daikuhara Y. Tsubouchi H. Blasi F. Comoglio P.M.

Increased invasiveness of cancer cells after HGF/SF stimulation is accompanied by up-regulation of various proteases (2Jeffers M. Rong S. Vande Woude G.F. J. Mol.

Using dominant-negative expression vectors of signal transduction proteins, we show here that up-regulation of the urokinase promoter by HGF/SF is mediated via activation of a Grb2/Sos1/Ha-Ras/c-Raf/RhoA/Mek1/Erk2/c-Jun pathway. Moreover JunD is overexpressed in unstimulated cells and down-regulated after stimulation of the urokinase promoter with HGF/SF.Much attention has been given to identifying the adaptor proteins associated with the Met receptor following stimulation by HGF/SF. In this context, Grb2 (34Besser D. Bardelli A. Didichenko S. Thelen M. Comoglio P. Ponzetto C. Nagamine Y. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 705-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), Gab1 (54Weidner M.

These authors show that the inhibitory effect of PI 3-kinase on proliferation is mediated by S6 kinase and does not involve c-Jun expression. In our experiments we did not observe any involvement of PI 3-kinase in regulation of the urokinase promoter. Neither the PI 3-kinase inhibitor wortmannin nor a dominant-negative PI 3-kinase (45Klippel A. Reinhard C. Kavanaugh W.M. Apell G. Escobedo M.A. Williams L.T. Mol. Cell.

Therefore binding of different adaptor proteins mediate distinct biological activities of HGF/SF. Binding of Grb2/Sos1 to the Met receptor mediates effects like branching morphogenesis (52Nguyen L.

Tremblay E. Elliott B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24850-24855Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar).Our previous work (42Lengyel E. Stepp E. Gum R. Boyd D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23007-23012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) showed that Ha-Ras regulates the urokinase promoter, but at that time we did not look at Rho family members, because their role in transformation was not recognized then (56Zohn I. Campbell S.L. Khosravi-Far R. Rossman K.L. Der C.J. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1415-1438Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). The results presented here show that Ha-Ras and RhoA, both members of a superfamily whose activities are controlled by GDP/GTP cycling, are necessary for the induction of the urokinase promoter by HGF/SF. RhoA, a Rho family member, is involved in control of cell shape but also cooperates with Ras and Raf in oncogenic cell transformation and anchorage-independent growth (37Qiu R.-G. Chen J. McCormick F. Symons M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11781-11785Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar, 47Khosravi-Far R. Solski P.A. Clark J.G. Kinch M.S. Der C.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6443-6453Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar). The general role of RhoA in regulation of HGF/SF responses is not clear because inhibition of RhoA does not prevent HGF/SF-induced membrane ruffling and cell spreading (57Ridley A.J. Comoglio P. Hall A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1110-1122Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our results indicate a role for Rho in HGF/SF signaling by affecting the regulation of urokinase. The effect of RhoA on urokinase is not general to all transforming Rho family members, because a dominant-negative Rac1 mutant had no effect on urokinase promoter activity (data not shown). Although we showed involvement of RhoA in the regulatory response by HGF/SF-Met receptor signaling, this effect might not be restricted to HGF/SF alone. RhoA might regulate urokinase expression in general, because a constitutive active RhoA mutant transforms NIH 3T3 cells to grow and invade the surrounding tissue in nude mice (47Khosravi-Far R. Solski P.A. Clark J.G. Kinch M.S. Der C.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6443-6453Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar). This would suggest that the invasive phenotype of RhoA transformed cells is mediated at least in part through up-regulation of urokinase.The observation that dominant-negative mutants of Ha-Ras, RhoA, and c-Raf inhibit inducible and basal activation of the urokinase promoter by HGF/SF suggests a role for RhoA in the Erk-MAPK pathway. Involvement of RhoA in the Erk-MAPK pathway is in agreement with the inhibitory effect of C3 transferase, a RhoA inhibitor, on Erk2 activation (58Hill C.S. Wynne J. Treisman R. Cell. 1995; 81: 1159-1170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1199) Google Scholar). Although RhoA can activate the Jnk-MAPK pathway (59Khosravi-Far R. White M.A. Westwick J.K. Solski P.A. Chrzanova-Wodnicka M. van Aelst L. Wigler M. Der C.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3923-3933Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar), in the case of HGF/SF-induced urokinase regulation we did not observe any effect of a dominant-negative Jnk expression plasmid, nor could HGF induce Jnk activity in NIH 3T3-Methum cells. This argues against an involvement of Jnk downstream of RhoA for urokinase regulation. Additionally we identified Erk2 as the MAPK involved in up-regulation of urokinase by HGF/SF. RhoA is located downstream of c-Raf in the signal transduction pathway from the Met receptor to the urokinase promoter. This is consistent with previous reports (37Qiu R.-G. Chen J. McCormick F. Symons M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11781-11785Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar, 59Khosravi-Far R. White M.A. Westwick J.K. Solski P.A. Chrzanova-Wodnicka M. van Aelst L. Wigler M. Der C.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3923-3933Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar) showing that transformation by c-Raf or Ha-Ras can be inhibited by co-expression of a dominant-negative RhoA (RhoN19), suggesting involvement of RhoA somewhere between c-Raf and Erk.The NIH 3T3 cell clone used in this study, NIH 3T3-Methum, is stably transfected with the Met receptor and has a higher basal urokinase promoter activity, compared with the vector transfected NIH 3T3-neo cell clone, which has no detectable promoter activity. Therefore, even without ligand stimulation, overexpression of human Met activates the urokinase promoter and the MAPK signaling pathway. Overexpression of dominant-negative components of the MAPK pathway in NIH 3T3-Methum repressed constitutive urokinase promoter activity, which indicates that the same signaling mechanism is used as in HGF/SF-Met-induced urokinase expression.On the basis of the results reported in this paper, we propose a model (Fig. 9) addressing different signaling molecules important in the regulation of the urokinase promoter by HGF/SF-Met signaling, providing insights regarding the mechanisms by which a protein-tyrosine kinase regulates a certain cellular gene. Activation of the Met receptor by HGF/SF leads to recruitment of Grb2 and Sos1 to the receptor, thereby activating Ha-Ras and c-Raf. The signal is transduced to the nucleus through a c-Raf/Mek1/Erk2-dependent cascade and activates AP-1 family members. PI 3-kinase, Rac, Jnk, p38, S6-kinase, and ATF-2 are not involved in this response. Despite the apparent linear nature of the Ras → Raf → Mek → Erk-MAPK signaling cascade, there is evidence that it represents a subset of a complex array of signaling interactions at several levels (46Khosravi-Far R. Campbell S. Rossman K.L. Der C.J. Adv. Cancer Res. 1998; 72: 57-197Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This might also apply for the regulation of the urokinase promoter. Each component of the signaling cascade identified here as being involved in the regulation of the urokinase promoter by HGF/SF may be activated by other than the identified upstream components.The transcriptional requirements for urokinase promoter stimulation by HGF/SF, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate, or Ha-Ras are similar (42Lengyel E. Stepp E. Gum R. Boyd D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23007-23012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 60Nerlov C. De Cesare D. Pergola F. Carracciolo A. Blasi F. Johnsen M. Verde P. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4573-4582Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Mutation of both AP-1 sites at −1967 and −1880 bp in the urokinase promoter substantially impaired the ability of HGF/SF as well as 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (60Nerlov C. De Cesare D. Pergola F. Carracciolo A. Blasi F. Johnsen M. Verde P. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4573-4582Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) to stimulate the promoter. The AP-1 site at −1967 bp is a combined PEA3/AP-1 site, and a remarkable difference between 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate or Ha-Ras (42Lengyel E. Stepp E. Gum R. Boyd D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23007-23012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) and HGF/SF induction of the urokinase promoter is that the PEA3 part of this site is not required for HGF/SF induction. Addition of HGF/SF to the NIH 3T3-Methum cell clone shows a change from one complex (containing JunD) that had bound to the AP-1 sites to two complexes. Although we did not identify every single protein in these complexes, we are certain that they involve AP-1 family members. Transient overexpression of A-Fos, a hybrid protein that inhibits DNA binding of all endogenous AP-1 family members (39Olive M. Krylov D. Echlin D.R. Gardner K. Taparowsky E. Vinson C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18586-18594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar), completely down-regulated inducible urokinase expression, and a dominant-negative c-Jun construct inhibited the induction by 70%. Thus the induction of the urokinase promoter is mediated at least partially by c-Jun.Several of our observations are consistent with a role for JunD in the constitutive activity of the urokinase promoter. Unstimulated NIH 3T3-Methum cells have a higher JunD content than HGF/SF-stimulated cells, and the amount of JunD bound to oligonucleotides spanning the AP-1A and AP-1B sites of the urokinase promoter was higher for untreated cells. The high JunD expression of untreated NIH 3T3-Methum cells accounts for part of the constitutive activity of the urokinase promoter, because a dominant-negative JunD reduced the basal activity of the urokinase promoter by 60%. When stimulated with HGF/SF, the JunD content of the cell decreases, and less JunD is bound to the urokinase promoter so that other AP-1 family members, including c-Jun can mediate the activation of the urokinase promoter by HGF/SF. Similarly, Pfarret al. (11Pfarr C.M. Mechta F. Spyrou G. Lallemand D. Carrillo S. Yaniv M. Cell. 1994; 76: 747-760Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar) showed a high JunD level in resting fibroblasts and a degradation of JunD following serum stimulation, whereas in parallel the level of c-Jun increased. Overexpression of JunD partially reversed Ha-Ras transformation and growth in soft agar. Together with other studies (11Pfarr C.M. Mechta F. Spyrou G. Lallemand D. Carrillo S. Yaniv M. Cell. 1994; 76: 747-760Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar, 40Vandel L. Pfarr C.M. Huguier S. Loiseau L. Sergeant A. Castellazzi M. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 495-507PubMed Google Scholar), this lead to the assumption that JunD has an inhibitory effect on cell growth and anti-mitogenic effects. To test this idea further, we overexpressed wt JunD in NIH 3T3-Methum cells and showed that the induction of the urokinase promoter by HGF/SF could be reduced by 50%. This indicates that JunD can inhibit growth factor-induced activation of a tumor-associated protease. The inhibition of HGF/SF-mediated urokinase activation by JunD could result from antagonizing the c-Jun function, by forming JunD/c-Jun heterodimers. Interestingly, higher amounts of wt JunD caused a decrease in the repression of HGF/SF induction of urokinase promoter activity. It is thus possible that the ratio of JunD to c-Jun is an important feature for the regulation of urokinase by HGF/SF. Alternatively, high level expression of JunD could result in titration of corepressors for JunD from the urokinase promoter and impair transcriptional regulation.In conclusion, using an NIH 3T3 cell line that has been stably transfected with the Met receptor, we have demonstrated that HGF/SF induces the urokinase promoter by a Grb2/Sos1/Ha-Ras/c-Raf/RhoA/Mek1/Erk2/c-Jun-mediated signal transduction pathway.

Their repression activity appeared to be mediated by the putative corepressor KAP-1 (KRAB-associated protein-1), because KRAZ1/2 bind to KAP-1, but KRAB mutants of KRAZ1/2 that are unable to interact with KAP-1 lack repression activity, and KAP-1 has intrinsic repressor activity and potentiates KRAZ1/2-mediated repression. We dissected the KAP-1 protein into a KRAB-interacting domain and a region necessary for repression. Using a mammalian two-hybrid assay, we further demonstrated that KAP-1 deletions lacking repression activity fused to the VP16 transactivation domain strongly activated transcription when coexpressed with KRAZ1. In contrast, VP16-KAP-1 fusions retaining repression activity resulted in repression. These results provide the first evidence that KAP-1 functionally interacts with KRAB in mammalian cells and seems to exert repressor activity in the DNA-bound KRAB-KAP-1 complex, and they further support the hypothesis that KAP-1 functions as a corepressor for the large class of KRAB-containing zinc finger proteins.

A large number of studies on transcriptional factors has revealed that functional domains of many transcriptional factors are modular. They can be structurally and functionally separated into DNA-binding domains and effector (activation or repression) domains. DNA-binding domains can be classified according to common structural motifs, which are well conserved throughout evolution (1Pabo C.O. Sauer R.T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 1053-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (1221) Google Scholar). One of such motifs is the C2H2-type zinc finger repeat that has been estimated to be present in several hundreds of genes, thus being identified as a major family of DNA-binding proteins (2Bellefroid E.J.

The vast majority of the C2H2-type zinc finger proteins (ZFPs) 1The abbreviations used are: ZFP, zinc finger protein; KRAB, Krüppel-associated box; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; nt, nucleotide(s); DBD, DNA-binding domain; HA, hemagglutinin; NLS, nuclear localization signal; 6MT, six repeats of the Myc epitope; AD, activation domain; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; GST, glutathione S-transferase; TIF, transcriptional intermediary factor. 1The abbreviations used are: ZFP, zinc finger protein; KRAB, Krüppel-associated box; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; nt, nucleotide(s); DBD, DNA-binding domain; HA, hemagglutinin; NLS, nuclear localization signal; 6MT, six repeats of the Myc epitope; AD, activation domain; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; GST, glutathione S-transferase; TIF, transcriptional intermediary factor. are classified as Krüppel-like on the basis of the fact that they share a highly conserved stretch of seven amino acids (the H/C link) connecting multiple tandem repeats of the zinc finger domain (5Schuh R. Aicher W. Gaul U. Cote S. Preiss A. Maier D. Seifert E. Nauber U. Schroder C. Kemler R. Cell. 1986; 47: 1025-1032Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). In contrast to the DNA-binding domains, analysis of the structure or targets of effector domains has been hampered by the lack of amino acid sequence homology or structural motifs common among them. Nevertheless, some effector domains can be loosely categorized according to the primary amino acid content. It has been reported that activation domains are often rich in acidic amino acids and/or proline and glutamine (6Mitchell P.J. Tjian R. Science. 1989; 245: 371-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (2186) Google Scholar, 7Johnson P.F. McKnight S.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 799-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (826) Google Scholar). Less is known about repression domains; however, some of them are rich in alanine, proline, or charged amino acids (8Hanna-rose W. Hansen U. Trends Genet. 1996; 12: 229-234Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar).The Krüppel-associated box (KRAB) was first identified as an evolutionarily conserved motif consisting of 75 amino acids that has been assumed to be present in about one-third of the Krüppel-like ZFPs (9Bellefroid E.J. Poncelet D.A. Lecocq P.J. Revelant O. Martial J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3608-3612Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). It is found almost exclusively in the N terminus of the Krüppel-like ZFPs that contain zinc finger domains in their C terminus, and is subdivided into KRAB-A and B domain (9Bellefroid E.J. Poncelet D.A. Lecocq P.J. Revelant O. Martial J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3608-3612Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). Recently several KRAB domains have been shown to act as potent repressors when heterologously tethered to the promoter (10Margolin J.F. Friedman J.R. Meyer W.K. Vissing H. Thiesen H.J.

FEBS Lett. 1995; 369: 153-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The KRAB-A domain present in every KRAB domain, but not the B domain, is responsible for such transcriptional repression (10Margolin J.F. Friedman J.R. Meyer W.K. Vissing H. Thiesen H.J. Rauscher III, F.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4509-4513Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar, 11Witzgall R. O'Leary E. Leaf A. Onaldi D. Bonventre J.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4514-4518Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). The KRAB domain is rich in charged amino acids and predicted to fold into two amphipathic α helices, which might thus serve as a protein-protein interaction surface (9Bellefroid E.J. Poncelet D.A. Lecocq P.J. Revelant O. Martial J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3608-3612Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). Unlike other alanine- or proline-rich repression domains, the KRAB domain is highly conserved in a subfamily of the Krüppel-like ZFPs sharing a common amino acid sequence and a predicted secondary structure, suggesting that the KRAB domains in many different ZFPs may share a common cellular target(s) (10Margolin J.F. Friedman J.R. Meyer W.K. Vissing H. Thiesen H.J. Rauscher III, F.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

KAP-1 is a member of the RBCC subfamily of the RING finger proteins that contain the RING finger motif defined as C3HC4 finger and followed by one or two B box-type fingers and a putative coiled-coil domain (14Friedman J.R.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6701-6715Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). Although the functions of these domains are so far unknown, they have been thought to be involved in nucleic acid-protein and/or protein-protein interactions (18Freemont P.S. Ann. N. Y. Acad.

Sci. 1996; 21: 208-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar). In the C-terminal portion, KAP-1 also contains a C4HC3 zinc finger called PHD finger followed by a domain similar to the bromodomain (14Friedman J.R. Fredericks W.J. Jensen D.E. Speicher D.W. Huang X.P. Neilson E.G. Rauscher III, F.J. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2067-2078Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar, 15Moosmann P. Georgiev O. Le Douarin B. Bourquin J.P. Schaffner W.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6701-6715Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). The PHD finger is often found in concert with the bromodomain and is also present in a number of proteins implicated in chromatin-mediated transcriptional regulation, thereby suggesting that it might be involved in interactions with chromatin components (20Aasland R. Gibson T.J. Stewart A.F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 56-59Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar). The bromodomain has also been identified in several proteins that regulate transcription in the context of large multiprotein complexes and/or through interaction with, or modification of, chromatin (21Haynes S.R. Dollard C. Winston F. Beck S. Trowsdale J. Dawid I.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 2603Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar, 22Tamkun J.W. Deuring R. Scott M.P. Kissinger M. Pattatucci A.M.

Sci. 1997; 22: 151-153Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Thus, it has been proposed to mediate the protein-protein interactions influencing the assembly and/or activity of such complexes, or to be involved in interactions with chromatin (21Haynes S.R. Dollard C. Winston F. Beck S. Trowsdale J. Dawid I.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 2603Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar).A highly related protein to KAP-1 in the overall structure including the conserved domains is TIF1α, which was originally identified as a putative coactivator of the nuclear receptor (24LeDouarin B. Zechel C. Garnier J.M. Lutz Y. Tora L. Pierrat P. Heery D. Gronemeyer H. Chambon P. Losson R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2020-2033Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar). However, it was subsequently reported to interact with KRAB and repress transcription when directly recruited to the promoter (15Moosmann P. Georgiev O. Le Douarin B. Bourquin J.P. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 4859-4867Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 17Le Douarin B. Nielsen A.L. Garnier J.M. Ichinose H. Jeanmougin F. Losson R. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6701-6715Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). Therefore, KAP-1 and TIF1α have been postulated to constitute a new family of transcriptional intermediary factors and function as mediators of transcriptional repression for the large class of KRAB-containing ZFPs (17Le Douarin B. Nielsen A.L. Garnier J.M. Ichinose H. Jeanmougin F. Losson R. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6701-6715Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). However, there is no compelling evidence directly indicating that KAP-1 or TIF1α indeed interacts with KRAB in mammalian cells and exerts the repression function in a physiological context of the resultant DNA-bound KRAB-KAP-1/TIF1α complex.In this report, we describe the isolation and characterization of two novel KRAB-ZFPs, KRAZ1 and KRAZ2, which repress transcription and interact with KAP-1. We further investigated the functional interaction of KRAZ1/2 with KAP-1 using a mammalian two-hybrid assay based on the detailed molecular characterization of the functional domains in KAP-1. Our results present the first evidence that KAP-1 functionally interacts with KRAB in mammalian cells and that KAP-1 seems to function as a corepressor of KRAB-ZFPs in the complex with the DNA-bound KRAB domains.DISCUSSIONIt has recently been thought to be a universal molecular mechanism that DNA-binding transcriptional repressors exert their repression activity by recruitment of corepressors in many systems from yeast andDrosophila to mammals (14Friedman J.R. Fredericks W.J. Jensen D.E. Speicher D.W. Huang X.P. Neilson E.G. Rauscher III, F.J. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2067-2078Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). Our study, together with the previous reports (14Friedman J.R. Fredericks W.J. Jensen D.E. Speicher D.W. Huang X.P. Neilson E.G. Rauscher III, F.J. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2067-2078Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar, 15Moosmann P. Georgiev O. Le Douarin B. Bourquin J.P. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 4859-4867Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 16Kim S.S. Chen Y.M. O'Leary E. Witzgall R. Vidal M. Bonventre J.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 15299-15304Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar), revealed that KAP-1 functions as a universal corepressor for the large class of KRAB-ZFPs, because it fulfills the criteria for corepressors: first, KAP-1 interacts in mammalian cells as well as in vitro with several different KRAB domains including novel ones we isolated, but not with KRAB mutants defective in repression. Second, KAP-1 has intrinsic repressor activity, because KAP-1 efficiently represses transcription when targeted to the promoter. Third, overexpression of KAP-1 potentiates KRAB-mediated repression in a manner dependent on the interaction with KRAB. Fourth, KAP-1 seems to exert the repressor activity in a physiological context of the DNA-bound KRAB-KAP-1 complex. These findings further support the model that KRAB-ZFPs bind to cis-regulatory sequences by their putative DNA-binding domains, zinc fingers, recruit the corepressors including KAP-1 to the promoter by their KRAB domains, and thereby repress transcription (14Friedman J.R. Fredericks W.J. Jensen D.E. Speicher D.W. Huang X.P. Neilson E.G. Rauscher III, F.J. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2067-2078Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar, 15Moosmann P. Georgiev O. Le Douarin B. Bourquin J.P. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 4859-4867Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 16Kim S.S. Chen Y.M. O'Leary E. Witzgall R. Vidal M. Bonventre J.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 15299-15304Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar).We demonstrated that amino acids 239–421 of KAP-1, which almost correspond to the coiled-coil region, are essential and sufficient for the interaction with KRAB in vitro, but the RING-B1/B2 region is dispensable (Fig. 6). However, involvement of the RING-B1/B2 region in the in vivo interaction with KRAB seems to be complicated but important. The RING finger is essentially dispensablein vivo and also in vitro, but the B1/B2 finger is required only in vivo but not in vitro. These results are in agreement with the report by Moosmann et al.(15Moosmann P. Georgiev O. Le Douarin B. Bourquin J.P. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 4859-4867Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar) suggesting that the coiled-coil region of KAP-1/TIF1β or TIF1α is essential but not sufficient for the interaction with KRAB in a yeast two-hybrid assay. They clearly indicated that the B1/B2 finger of KAP-1/TIF1β is required for the functional interaction, whereas the RING finger is dispensable (15Moosmann P. Georgiev O. Le Douarin B. Bourquin J.P. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 4859-4867Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the RING finger is suggested to contribute to the efficient interaction with KRAB in vivo by the observation in our mammalian two-hybrid assay that activation by VP16-KAP1 145–421 is consistently lower than that of VP16-KAP1 N421 (Fig. 8 A, compare lanes 4 and14). Moreover, the competition experiment revealed that KAP-1 145C lacking the RING finger could partially compete with VP16-KAP-1 N487 for binding to KRAZ1, and KAP-1 239C, 145–421, or 239–421 could not (data not shown). It might thus also be possible that a third molecule(s) is required for the stable interaction between KAP-1 and KRAB in vivo and that the RING-B1/B2 finger region of KAP-1 is necessary for the interaction with such a third molecule(s).Amino acids 396–562 of KAP-1, which reside between the coiled-coil and the PHD finger, are considered to be a core domain essential for repression but not sufficient for full repression. Several explanations can be made why the N-terminal portion (the RBCC domain) or the most C-terminal portion (the bromo-like domain) should be required for full repression in addition to the core domain. First, the N- or C-terminal region may contribute to the functional conformation or stability of the KAP-1 protein. Second, KAP-1 might possess two or more independent repression modules that are composed of the N- or C-terminal region together with the core domain. The core domain may thus be shared with both repression modules and would be essential, whereas the N- or C-terminal region would be dispensable as long as the other module remains functional. Third, KAP-1 can function only within a multiprotein complex, and the N or C terminus is required for efficient incorporation of KAP-1 into such a complex through specific protein-protein interaction that is the possible function of these domains, or more simply, there might be a definite threshold of molecular mass necessary for proper formation of such a multiprotein complex.Several hypotheses have been proposed for the mechanism(s) underlying KRAB/KAP-1-mediated repression (15Moosmann P. Georgiev O. Le Douarin B. Bourquin J.P. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 4859-4867Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 17Le Douarin B. Nielsen A.L. Garnier J.M. Ichinose H. Jeanmougin F. Losson R. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6701-6715Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar, 36Pengue G. Lania L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1015-1020Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). One is the reorganization of chromatin into a repressive state by heterochromatin formation, because in the yeast two-hybrid assays, both KAP-1 and TIF1α were found to be associated with mHP1α and mMOD1, which are mouse homologs of Drosophila heterochromatin protein 1 that repress transcription by the formation of heterochromatin or a similar structure (17Le Douarin B. Nielsen A.L. Garnier J.M. Ichinose H. Jeanmougin F. Losson R. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6701-6715Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). However, we observed that KAP-1 N562 lacking the putative mHP1α/mMOD1-interacting domain (amino acids 571–579) (17Le Douarin B. Nielsen A.L. Garnier J.M. Ichinose H. Jeanmougin F. Losson R. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6701-6715Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar) could repress transcription more effectively (17.8-fold) than KAP-1 554C containing this site (7.7-fold) (Figs. 5 and 7 A), in agreement with the finding that a mutation of TIF1α within the HP1-interacting domain that disrupts the interaction in yeast did not affect repression activity in transfected mammalian cells (17Le Douarin B. Nielsen A.L. Garnier J.M. Ichinose H. Jeanmougin F. Losson R. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6701-6715Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). Thus, the formation of repressed chromatin by direct interaction with mHP1α and/or mMOD1 does not seem to be a principle mechanism of KAP-1/TIF1β- and TIF1α-mediated repression, although lack of interaction with mHP1α/mMOD1 in KAP-1 N562 remains to be confirmed.At present, the most favorable model for KRAB/KAP-1-mediated repression is active repression (8Hanna-rose W. Hansen U. Trends Genet. 1996; 12: 229-234Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar), in which KRAB or KAP-1 interacts in an inhibitory manner with specific proteins of the basal transcription machinery, thereby interfering with the assembly and/or function of them (15Moosmann P. Georgiev O. Le Douarin B. Bourquin J.P. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 4859-4867Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 36Pengue G. Lania L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1015-1020Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence support the active repression model rather than the formation of repressive chromatin (15Moosmann P. Georgiev O. Le Douarin B. Bourquin J.P. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 4859-4867Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 36Pengue G. Lania L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1015-1020Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). First, KRAB/KAP-1-mediated repression is quite efficient even in short term transient transfection assays as in this study, as well as in anin vitro transcription experiment (36Pengue G. Lania L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1015-1020Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), in which the bulk of the reporter DNA templates would not be fully assembled into chromatin. Second, it was recently demonstrated that KRAB is able to repress transcription by RNA polymerase II and III, but neither by RNA polymerase I nor T7 RNA polymerase in mammalian cells, suggesting that KRAB exerts its repression activity by interfering with some component(s) for RNA polymerase II and III transcription rather than by altering the chromatin structure into a repressive state (37Moosmann P. Georgiev O. Thiesen H.J. Hagmann M. Schaffner W. Biol. Chem. 1997; 378: 669-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). There are two potential molecular mechanisms proposed for active repression, direct and quenching repression (8Hanna-rose W. Hansen U. Trends Genet. 1996; 12: 229-234Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). For KRAB/KAP-1-mediated repression, direct repression seems to be more likely than quenching repression, because KRAB has been demonstrated to repress transcription from a number of different polymerase II-dependent promoters (12Pengue G. Calabro V. Bartoli P.C. Pagliuca A. Lania L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 2908-2914Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 15Moosmann P. Georgiev O. Le Douarin B. Bourquin J.P. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 4859-4867Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar) and suppress the activating function of various transcriptional activators (36Pengue G. Lania L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1015-1020Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), and moreover, KRAB is able to repress basal promoter activity in addition to activated transcription in anin vitro transcription experiment (36Pengue G. Lania L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1015-1020Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar).The active repression mechanism has been considered to involve specific inhibitory protein-protein interactions; however, it is also possible that active repression is accomplished without direct interaction with any components of the transcription machinery, but rather by modification of them. With regard to this possibility, the recent report by Fraser et al. (38Fraser R.A. Heard D.J. Adam S. Lavigne A.C. Le Douarin B. Tora L. Losson R. Rochette-Egly C. Chambon P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16199-16204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) seems to be instructive. They showed that TIF1α possesses intrinsic protein kinase activity responsible for autophosphorylation as well as for phosphorylation of TFIIEα, TAFII28, and TAFII55. Although functional involvement of such phosphorylation in transcriptional repression and whether KAP-1/TIF1β also has similar activity should be further studied, it is intriguing that KRAB/KAP-1-mediated repression can be regulated through phosphorylation of specific components in the basal transcription complex. It should also be noted that active direct repression and repression by chromatin reorganization are not mutually exclusive (15Moosmann P. Georgiev O. Le Douarin B. Bourquin J.P. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 4859-4867Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). The possible existence of multiple repression modules in KAP-1 (this study) and TIF1α (17Le Douarin B. Nielsen A.L. Garnier J.M. Ichinose H. Jeanmougin F. Losson R. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6701-6715Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar) might imply repression through both mechanisms.It was recently proposed that TIF1α and KAP-1/TIF1β constitute a new family of transcriptional intermediary factors (TIFs) that might play a dual role in the control of transcription at the chromatin level (17Le Douarin B. Nielsen A.L. Garnier J.M. Ichinose H. Jeanmougin F. Losson R. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6701-6715Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar), because TIF1α was originally identified as a protein enhancing transcription by the nuclear receptor in yeast (24LeDouarin B. Zechel C. Garnier J.M. Lutz Y. Tora L. Pierrat P. Heery D. Gronemeyer H. Chambon P. Losson R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2020-2033Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar), and KAP-1/TIF1β was recently reported to activate transcription by glucocorticoid receptor and C/EBPβ (39Chang C.J. Chen Y.L. Lee S.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5880-5887Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), also because they share common properties not only to repress transcription when targeted to the promoter but also to interact with mHP1α/mMOD1 and with the KRAB repressor domains. Therefore, it seems possible that TIFs might function as corepressors or coactivators in a way dependent on the chromatin status, the promoter context, or the combination of certain types of transcription factors that bring them to the promoter.It is clearly necessary to elucidate the mechanism(s) and identify the molecular target(s) in KRAB/KAP-1-mediated repression. In addition, it is also important to investigate the biological significance of KRAB/KAP-1-mediated repression. In the mammalian two-hybrid assay, we clearly demonstrated that repression of transcription by GAL4-KRAB can be converted to strong activation when coexpressed with the VP16-fused KAP1 deletions that contain the KRAB-interacting domain but no repression activity, suggesting that these VP16-KAP1 deletions would function as dominant negative mutants with regard to the physiological function of KRAB-ZFPs and/or KAP-1. Therefore, functional investigation using these deletions as a molecular probe in mammalian cells as well as in transgenic animals will facilitate the elucidation of the physiological importance of transcriptional repression by the large class of KRAB-ZFPs and their corepressor KAP-1. A large number of studies on transcriptional factors has revealed that functional domains of many transcriptional factors are modular. They can b"

Mellman I. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1989; 5: 483-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (1227) Google Scholar). However, transport of lysosomal enzymes in many cells is unaffected by a deficiency in the phosphotransferase, which is required for M6P synthesis (2Owada M. Neufeld E.F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1982; 105: 814-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). M6P-receptor-independent membrane association has been reported for several lysosomal proteins (3McIntyre G.F. Erickson A.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10588-10592Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Confirmation and further analysis of a M6P-independent sorting pathway in mammalian cells has been complicated by both the presence of the M6P pathway itself and difficulty in distinguishing effects on protein folding versus protein trafficking when deletional mutants of the protease precursors were analyzed (4Conner G.E. J. Biol Chem. 1992; 267: 21738-21745Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Tao K. Stearns N.A. Dong J. Wu Q. Sahagian C.G. Arch. Biochem.

Cytol. 1984; 86: 197-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). While the cathepsin L-like protease prodomains of these organisms have significant homology to mammalian procathepsin L (e.g.45% identity for cruzain versus mouse cathepsin L), there are no carbohydrate modifications, so they are unique experimental models for analyzing M6P-independent protein sorting. Trypanosome cysteine proteases are synthesized as precursor proteins with a hydrophobic signal peptide, a 100–122-amino acid prodomain, a 200–210-amino acid catalytic domain, and, in most cases, a 100–130-amino acid carboxyl-terminal domain (7Souza A.E.

Parasitology. 1997; 114: S61-S80Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and facilitating activity against specific macromolecular substrates (15Del Nery E. Juliano M.A. Lima A.P.C.A. Scharfstein J. Juliano L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25713-25718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The prodomain of cysteine proteases has two well defined functions, maintaining the enzyme in an inactive form (zymogen) until it reaches an appropriate site of protease function, and functioning as a structural template to ensure proper folding during translation (10Eakin A.E. Mills A.A. Harth G. McKerrow J.H. Craik C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7411-7420Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The prodomain can also act as a reversible inhibitor and a stabilizer of the mature protease (16Mach L. Mort J.S. Glossl J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13030-13035Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and has also been implicated in protease precursor trafficking (17McIntyre G.F. Erickson A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15438-15445Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18McIntyre G.F. Godbold G.D. Erickson A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 567-572Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A hypothesis for the role of the prodomain in trafficking suggests that a peptide motif near the amino terminus is recognized and bound by a membrane receptor within the Golgi (18McIntyre G.F. Godbold G.D. Erickson A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 567-572Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This receptor-prodomain interaction is proposed to direct protease precursors to appropriate cellular compartments. Release of free, active catalytic domain from the prodomain-receptor complex is thought to occur in a downstream compartment and require a final step of proteolytic processing. We analyzed the contribution to intracellular protease trafficking of each of the three major domains of the T. cruzi cathepsinL-like protease, “cruzain,” by transfection of constructs containing coding regions for the domains coupled to GFP as a reporter gene. We show that the prodomain is necessary and sufficient for trafficking. A nine-amino acid sequence motif, homologous to the putative membrane binding region of procathepsin L (18McIntyre G.F. Godbold G.D. Erickson A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 567-572Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was identified and its function confirmed by site-directed mutagenesis. Finally, the requirement of proteolytic release of the catalytic domain from the prodomain-receptor complex was confirmed by analysis of mutants in which the prodomain/catalytic domain processing site was altered. The results of these studies suggest that a protein motif trafficking pathway for lysosomal proteases arose early in eukaryotic cell evolution and may continue to function in higher eukaryotes independent of the M6P pathway. L. mexicana (MNYC/BZ/62/M379) promastigotes were grown at 27 °C in RPMI 1640 (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 10% FBS (Sigma) and 10% liver infusion tryptose medium, and T. cruzi epimastigotes (MHOM/BR/78/Sylvio-X10-CL7) were cultured in liver infusion tryptose/FBS at 27 °C (33Kendall G. Wilderspin A.F. Ashall F. Miles M.A. Kelly J.M. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2751-2758Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Mid-log cultures containing from 1 to 5 × 107 cells were used in all experiments. The synthetic DNA oligonucleotides used were synthesized on a Perkin-Elmer Applied Biosystems 394 DNA synthesizer at the Biomolecular Resource Center (University of California San Francisco) (see TableI).Table IOligonucleotides used for the GFP and cruzain constructsNameSequenceDescriptionGFP1GCGCTACTAGTCGCCACCATGGGNucleotides 595–617 in pS65T-C1; SpeI site followed by the ATG initial codon of the GFP coding sequenceGFP2CAAATGTGGTATCGATGATTATGATCAGReverse primer (nucleotides 1411–1435) downstream of the multicloning site in pS65T-C1, ClaI site underlinedPro1GGCGACGAGT ATGCTCGCGGCCGTCCTGSpeI site followed by nucleotides 22–40 of the cruzain gene, GeneBank™M84342; initial codon incorporatedPro2GCCCTGGTCCTTGACTAGTGTCACGGCGCCTCTCGCReverse primer (nucleotides 391–426 of the cruzain gene) including anSpeI siteCat2TCCTTGACTAGTGACTGGTTCGAGCCCTTTGCAATGCReverse primer upstream of the COOH-terminal region (nucleotides 950–986), including a SpeI siteCtd1GTGGGGCGAGGAAGCTTACATCCGCATTGCAAAGGNucleotides 927–961, including a HindIII siteCtd2CAGAAACAAAGAGGATCCTCAGAGGCGGCGNucleotides 1393–1422, including a BamHI siteMut1CCGGTGAAGGTGGAGGA CCCGGGCGCGCCCGCGGCAGTGGSense primer at the Pro-catalytic cleavage site (nucleotides 343–382); mutations in bold; SmaI site for screening underlinedMut2CCACTGCCGCGGGCGCGCCCGGG TCCTCCACCTTCACCGGReverse primer, nucleotides 343–382 Open table in a new tab PCR amplifications were for 25 cycles in a volume of 50 μl, containing 2 units of Pwopolymerase, 0.1 μg of each primer, and 2 ng of plasmid DNA as template on a Perkin-Elmer DNA thermal cycler. Amplification conditions were: 1-min denaturation at 94 °C, 1-min annealing at 55 °C, 2-min extension at 72 °C. The green fluorescent protein coding sequence was generated by PCR amplification using pS65T-C1 (CLONTECH) as DNA template and GFP1 and GFP2 oligonucleotides as primers. For pT-Pre-GFP we used GFP3 instead of GFP1. GFP3 contains the signal peptide of cruzain. The amplification product containing a multicloning site at the 3′ region of the GFP gene was treated with SpeI and ClaI restriction enzymes, gel-purified, and then ligated into the appropriate site in the pTEX plasmid (26Kelly J.M. Ward H.M. Miles M.A. Kendall G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 3963-3969Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) to generate pT-GFP or pT-Pre-GFP. The prodomain (Pro) and prodomain-catalytic domain (ProCat) of the cruzain gene were amplified from pCheYTc (10Eakin A.E. Mills A.A. Harth G. McKerrow J.H. Craik C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7411-7420Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using the oligonucleotide primers Pro1 and Pro2, and Pro1 and Cat2, respectively. A SpeI site was incorporated in all the primers. Following digestion with SpeI, the PCR products were gel-purified and ligated into pT-GFP. This procedure resulted in the generation of Pro and ProCat coding regions of cruzain fused upstream of the GFP coding sequence in the pT-GFP vector. The fused domains were in-frame with the GFP sequence, as verified by DNA sequencing. The specific sequences from cruzain in each case were −Leu115 to Thr14 for pT-Pro-GFP and −Leu115 to Gln195 for pT-ProCat-GFP. Both of these constructs included the cleavage site between the pro- and the catalytic domains, but neither included the cleavage site between the catalytic domain and the carboxyl-terminal domains. Amino acids are numbered based on the papain numbering system (34Drenth J. Jansonius J.N. Koekoek R. Wolthers B.F. Adv. Protein Chem. 1971; 25: 79-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). The carboxyl-terminal domain (Ctd) of the cruzain gene (Tyr186 to Leu342) contained in pCheYTc (10Eakin A.E. Mills A.A. Harth G. McKerrow J.H. Craik C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7411-7420Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was PCR-amplified using oligonucleotide primers Ctd1 and Ctd2. Either HindIII or BamHI sites were included in the primers to facilitate cloning of the resultant PCR product into the multicloning site of the GFP gene in pT-Pre-GFP. This amplification product was digested and ligated as described above. A PCR-based mutagenesis procedure was used to generate V3D and V2P substitutions at the cleavage site of the prodomain (Fig. 3 D). Two separate PCR reactions were done with primers Pro1 and Mut2 in one reaction and primers Mut1 and Cat2 in a second reaction (27Higuchi R. Krummel B. Saiki R.K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 7351-7367Crossref PubMed Scopus (2080) Google Scholar). These reactions were carried out using 1 ng of plasmid pCheYTc and the PCR conditions described above. Two DNA fragments were generated by the reactions. Following agarose gel electrophoresis, these fragments were recovered and pooled, and 1 μl of the mixture was used in a second round of PCR amplification with primers Pro1 and Cat2 and an annealing temperature of 60 °C. A resulting 1-kilobase product was cloned into pT-GFP to generate pT-Pro′Cat-GFP. The transfection procedure used was a modification of that described by Hariharan et al. (28Hariharan S.J. Ajioka J. Swindle J. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1993; 57: 15-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Parasite cultures were grown to mid log in the appropriate media supplemented with 10% FBS. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and washed twice in electroporation buffer (100 mm NaCl, 3 mm KCl, 5 mm Na2HPO4, 2 mm KH2PO4, 0.5 mmMgCl2, 0.1 mm CaCl2) and resuspended at 108 cells/ml in electroporation buffer. Four-hundred fifty microliters of cell suspension was incubated on ice for 10 min in a cuvette containing 10 μg of plasmid DNA in 50 μl of water. The cells were electroporated with a single pulse using a Transfector-600 (BTX Corp., San Diego, CA) set at 400 V and 500 microfarads using an electrode with a 0.8-mm gap. The electroporated cells were left on ice for a further 10 min and then diluted into a 5 ml of liver infusion tryptose/FBS. The parasites were incubated for 48 h before adding 20 μg/ml G418 (Geneticin, Life Technologies, Inc.). Transformants were selected by gradually increasing the G418 concentration to either 100 μg/ml for L. mexicana or 200 μg/ml for T. cruzi over 3 weeks. Parasites were subcultured every 5 days in the presence of G418 and analyzed as populations. Cell pellets were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (4 °C, 10 min, 3000 rpm) and fixed in 0.1 m sodium cacodylate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 2% paraformaldehyde and 1% sucrose. GFP fluorescence was first confirmed in fixed cells with a Zeiss Axioplan fluorescence microscope (excitation and emission of fluorescein). Each trypanosome preparation was imaged with a laser scanning microscope 410 (Carl Zeiss Inc., Thornwood, NY) equipped with an Axiovert 100 microscope (Zeiss), a 63−, 1.4 NA plan-APOCHROMAT objective lens (Zeiss), and an argon/krypton laser. The fluorescein-labeled probe and the propidium iodide were imaged separately. Alternatively, samples were imaged with an MRC 1024 unit (Bio-Rad) equipped with a Nikon Diaphot 200 inverted microscope. Propidium iodide was imaged using the 568-nm laser line and collecting emissions longer than 590 nm. For all specimens, a series of two-dimensional slice images, 0.5 μm apart were acquired starting above the top surface of the section and extending below the bottom surface. A zoom factor of 2.0 was used during the scanning, resulting in a voxel size of approximately 0.2 μm for each specimen. Each slice voxel intensity was the average of at least three successive scans. Images were transferred to a UNIX workstation for archiving and analysis. Digital image cytometry was done using the Quantitative Image Processing System in the Laboratory for Cell Analysis at the University of California San Francisco Cancer Center (29Piper J. Rutovitz D. Sudar D. Kallioniemi A. Kallioniemi O.P. Waldman F.M. Gray J.W. Pinkel D. Cytometry. 1995; 19: 10-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). The Quantitative Image Processing System images were acquired using a fluorescent Zeiss Axioscope equipped with a Xillix 1024 CCD camera and an automated filter wheel to select emission wavelengths. All mechanical controls for the system were under software control on a SUN workstation. Images were acquired sequentially for each fluorochrome, in addition to a bright field image, to show morphological features. Western blots were performed with 1:1000 dilutions of the anti-GFP monoclonal antibody (CLONTECH) as the primary antibody, in phosphate-buffered saline, 5% non-fat milk, and detected using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and ECL Western blot analysis system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Immunoelectron microscopy was performed on frozen sections from epimastigotes fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde and 0.1% glutaraldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4. Sections were probed with either rabbit antibody raised against recombinant cruzain (10Eakin A.E. Mills A.A. Harth G. McKerrow J.H. Craik C.S. J. Biol.

Controls were conducted with the nontransfected cell line and by omission of the respective primary antibody. Epimastigotes were stained for 30 min with 20 nm red LysoTracker (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR), a fluorescent probe (577 nm absorption, 590 nm emission) used to investigate protein localization in the lysosomes because of its selective accumulation in cellular compartments with low internal pH. Fixed and LysoTracker-stained epimastigotes were observed in a Zeiss microscope equipped with UV epifluorescence. The coordinates of human procathepsin L (Protein Data Bank deposition code 1CJL (22Coulombe R. Grochulski P. Sivaraman J. Menard R. Mort J.S. Cygler M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5492-5503Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar) were used to model the proregion of cruzain. Coordinates were visualized with the program CHAIN (30Sack J.S. J. Mol. Graphics. 1988; 6: 244-245Crossref Google Scholar). Optimal rotomer conformation for side chains of the cruzain sequence was selected based on the orientation of the corresponding side chain in the procathepsin L structure. These choices corresponded to a statistically likely rotomer conformation in all instances (31Ponder J.W. Richards F.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 193: 775-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (1346) Google Scholar). Fig. 4 was generated with MOLSCRIPT (32Kraulis P.J. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1991; 24: 946-950Crossref Google Scholar). All substitution mutants were constructed using a PCR-based method (27Higuchi R. Krummel B. Saiki R.K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 7351-7367Crossref PubMed Scopus (2080) Google Scholar) as above. The annealing temperature was varied empirically to maximize the yield of the products.

Open table in a new tab The extreme primers (Tex1 and Cat2) were common for the secondary reactions in all the mutants. The amplified fragments were gel-purified, digested with SpeI, and ligated in place of the corresponding wild type fragment in the pT-ProCat-GFP vector. GFP was expressed in both trypanosomes using the pT vector system (Fig. 1 A).Leishmania promastigotes expressing GFP required 2 weeks of selection in G418, while T. cruzi epimastigotes required 3 weeks. Expression of GFP alone (Fig. 1, A and B), without associated protease domains, resulted in distribution of the fluorescent protein throughout the cytoplasm of promastigotes or epimastigotes, including the flagellum, as observed previously in transfection of the related parasite, Leishmania major(19Ha D.S. Schwarz J.K. Turco S.J. Beverley S.M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 77: 57-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Fig. 1, C and D, show that constructs, which included the carboxyl-terminal domain, the last 20 amino acids of the catalytic domain, the natural processing site (VVGGP) between the catalytic domain and carboxyl terminus (downstream of GFP), and the signal peptide (−Leu115 to −Ala105) (upstream of GFP), did not alter the diffuse cytoplasmic localization of the fluorescent protein. Fig. 1, E and F, show that GFP is correctly directed to the L/E compartment of both T. cruzi and Leishmania when it is expressed downstream of the cruzain prodomain and ProCat processing site (−Leu115to Thr14). Identical trafficking is observed if the entire cruzain catalytic domain is also included (Fig. 1, G andH). Intense fluorescence is seen in the “megasome” compartment of Leishmania promastigotes and the “reservasomes” of T. cruzi epimastigotes. These are both late endosome- or lysosome-like vacuoles identified by their size, ultrastructure, pH, and position within the cell relative to propidium iodide-labeled nucleus and kinetoplast (20Duboise S.M. Vannier-Santos M.A. Costa-Pinto D. Rivas L. Pan A.A. Traub-Cseko Y.M. de Souza W. McMahon-Pratt D. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1994; 68: 119-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 21Engel J.C.

Erickson A.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10588-10592Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), the catalytic domain must eventually be cleaved from the prodomain to release soluble active protease (3McIntyre G.F. Erickson A.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10588-10592Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The effects of specific cysteine protease inhibitors on the ultrastructure of T. cruzi in culture suggested that the detrimental effects of the inhibitors are due to inhibition of autoproteolytic cleavage of the prodomain from the catalytic domain in a late Golgi compartment (21Engel J.C. Doyle P.S. Palmer J. Hsieh I. Bainton D.F. McKerrow J.H. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 597-606Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the presence of cysteine protease inhibitors, unprocessed cruzain accumulated in the Golgi and did not reach the L/E compartment. To test the hypothesis that the prodomain must be removed prior to final sorting of cruzain to this compartment, a mutant construct (Fig.3 D) was analyzed in which the processing site between prodomain and catalytic domain was altered. Western blot of T. cruzi extracts (Fig. 3 E) showed that the protein product of the transfected construct was not processed to the catalytic domain-GFP fusion protein seen in wild type organisms. Fig. 3, A—C, show that failure to cleave the prodomain resulted in abnormal accumulation of GFP in the Golgi compartment at the expense of normal L/E targeting. The M6P-independent sorting pathway for mammalian procathepsin L is thought to involve specific motifs within the prodomain interacting with a microsomal membrane receptor (3McIntyre G.F. Erickson A.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10588-10592Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Alignment of the kinetoplast prodomains with that of mammalian procathepsin L (Fig. 4 A) reveals similarity in a nine-residue sequence, which, in procathepsin L, mediates prodomain-membrane association (3McIntyre G.F. Erickson A.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10588-10592Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). A homology-based model of the prodomain, based on the crystal structure of procathepsin L (22Coulombe R. Grochulski P. Sivaraman J. Menard R. Mort J.S. Cygler M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5492-5503Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar), shows this motif is on a solvent-exposed loop between helices 1 and 2 at the amino terminus (Fig. 4 B). Based on the assumption that the arginine- and histidine-rich receptor binding motif would likely form salt bridges with negatively charged residues on the receptor, and because glutamic acid replacements in the motif would be most disruptive, five mutations were constructed and evaluated. All changed neutral or positively charged amino acids to glutamic acid. Two mutated residues were in helices flanking the loop region containing the target motif (K42E at the end of helix 1 and A53E at the beginning of helix 2, Fig. 4). Fig. 5 shows that, despite changing these amino acids to glutamic acid, normal targeting of GFP to the L/E compartment was observed. Three mutations within the loop (K44E, G46E, and R47E) all resulted in distribution of GFP throughout the cytoplasm of the cell (Fig. 5), similar to the distribution of GFP when GFP is expressed alone or with the COOH-terminal domain (Fig. 2). No retention in the endoplasmic reticulum was observed with any of the constructs, as would be expected if protein misfolding occurred. We have shown that the prodomain of the cathepsinL-like cysteine protease, cruzain, is necessary and sufficient for directing GFP to the L/E compartment of two primitive eukaryotic unicellular organisms, T. cruzi and L. mexicana. In constructs lacking any protease domain, GFP was distributed throughout the cytoplasm, including the flagellum. Addition of the carboxyl-terminal domain failed to alter this distribution, indicating that the carboxyl-terminal domain is not sufficient to direct proper protein sorting. Correct sorting with the prodomain construct occurred whether or not the catalytic domain was included. Coupled with previous analysis of Leishmania cysteine protease gene products (20Duboise S.M. Vannier-Santos M.A. Costa-Pinto D. Rivas L. Pan A.A. Traub-Cseko Y.M. de Souza W. McMahon-Pratt D. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1994; 68: 119-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 23Mottram J.C.

Chem. 1997; 272: 14285-14293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), these results suggest that neither the carboxyl-terminal domain nor the catalytic domain is required in trafficking of trypanosome cysteine proteases, at least in the extracellular stages of T. cruzi and L. mexicana. The pT-cruzain/GFP constructs correctly directed GFP in both L. mexicana and T. cruzi. This result suggests that key aspects of the cysteine protease trafficking pathway are shared between the two organisms. In fact, alignment of the kinetoplastid prodomains showed both significant homology between the prodomains of the two parasite species, as well as significant similarity to mammalian cathepsin L in a nine amino acid sequence implicated in mouse procathepsin L binding to microsomal membranes (3McIntyre G.F. Erickson A.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10588-10592Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis experiments confirmed that this motif, located on a solvent exposed loop near the amino terminus of procathepsin L (22Coulombe R. Grochulski P. Sivaraman J. Menard R. Mort J.S. Cygler M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5492-5503Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar), must be intact if proper protease sorting is to take place. Mammalian procathepsin L binds to a microsomal membrane receptor via its prodomain, which is later cleaved to release soluble mature protease into specific cellular compartments (18McIntyre G.F. Godbold G.D. Erickson A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 567-572Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Previous work by Eakin et al. (10Eakin A.E. Mills A.A. Harth G. McKerrow J.H. Craik C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7411-7420Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) indicated that the prodomain of cruzain is autoproteolytically removed from the catalytic domain at pH 5–6 at the processing site indicated in Fig. 3 (10Eakin A.E. Mills A.A. Harth G. McKerrow J.H. Craik C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7411-7420Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Cazzulo J.J. Bravo M. Raimondi A. Engström U. Lindeberg G. Hellman U. Cell. Mol. Biol. 1996; 42: 691-696PubMed Google Scholar). To test whether this autoproteolysis step was necessary for final intracellular sorting, we prepared constructs in which the normal prodomain/catalytic domain processing site was mutated to prevent proteolytic cleavage by cruzain. By Western blot, the transfected gene product was not processed (Fig.3) and the prodomain remained attached to the catalytic domain. Expression of this mutated protease-GFP construct resulted in a population of T. cruzi epimastigotes in which GFP now accumulated within the Golgi compartment. Based on these results, as well as previous studies showing that synthetic cruzain inhibitors cause accumulation of precursor cruzain in the Golgi (21Engel J.C. Doyle P.S. Palmer J. Hsieh I. Bainton D.F. McKerrow J.H. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 597-606Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we propose that removal of the prodomain occurs in an acidified late Golgi or early post-Golgi compartment. A similar location for proteolytic processing has been observed for the lysosomal glycosidase of another primitive eukaryote, Dictyostelium discoideum (25Mierendorf Jr., R.C. Cadelli J.A. Dimond R.L. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 100: 1777-1787Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The protozoa T. cruzi and L. mexicana are closely related species in one of the earliest lineages of eukaryotic cells. As experimental models they can provide a glimpse of basic protein sorting pathways that might have developed early in the evolution of the eukaryotic cell. By analogy to a model of M6P-independent trafficking of the lysosomal proteases cathepsin D and cathepsin L in mammalian cells (3McIntyre G.F. Erickson A.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10588-10592Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 17McIntyre G.F. Erickson A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15438-15445Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we propose that a membrane-associated receptor binds the prodomain of cruzain after its exit from the endoplasmic reticulum, presumably early in its Golgi transit. Evaluation of this model in primitive eukaryotic cells like T. cruzi is more straightforward because the cruzain prodomain lacks not only M6P, but any carbohydrate moiety (13Cazzulo J.J. Hellman U. Couso R. Parodi A.J.A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1990; 38: 41-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The observation that the nonglycosylated prodomain of the T. cruzi cysteine protease is necessary and sufficient for directing GFP to the L/E compartment of either organism is consistent with the model proposed by McIntyre and Erickson (17McIntyre G.F. Erickson A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15438-15445Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) for trafficking of mammalian procathepsin L. There is significant sequence similarity among these proteases in the nine-amino acid motif proposed to mediate procathepsin L binding to microsomal membranes (18McIntyre G.F. Godbold G.D. Erickson A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 567-572Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The observation that this motif is present on a solvent-accessible loop (22Coulombe R. Grochulski P. Sivaraman J. Menard R. Mort J.S. Cygler M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5492-5503Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar) and the results of the mutagenesis experiments reported here support the hypothesis of its role in prodomain-receptor interactions and the presence of a conserved M6P-independent pathway of lysosomal protease trafficking.

Here we report that CBP also interacts with a novel ATPase termedSnf2-Related CBPActivator Protein (SRCAP). Consistent with this activity, SRCAP contains the conserved ATPase domain found within members of the Snf2 family.

CBP has also been shown to have intrinsic histone acetyltransferase (HAT) activity and to bind to several proteins with HAT activity (P/CAF, ACTR, NCoA-1). This suggests that CBP alone, or acting in conjunction with these proteins, functions as a co-activator by stimulating remodeling of chromatin (9Chen H. Lin R.J. Schiltz R.L. Chakravarti D. Nash A.

The adenoviral protein E1A also binds CBP but represses the ability of CBP to function as a co-activator for CREB as well as a number of other transcription factors (4Zhang J.J. Vinkeneier U. Gu W.

This appears to be due in part to the ability of E1A to prevent binding of P/CAF and P/CIP to the C-terminal end of CBP. E1A also binds to the N-terminal end of CBP and suppresses the ability of a Gal-CBP-(1–450) chimera to activate transcription. Although P/CAF also binds to this same region, competition between P/CAF and E1A binding has not been demonstrated (5Kurokawa R. Kalafus D. Ogliastro M.-H. Kioussi C. Xu L. Torchia J. Rosenfeld M.G. Glass C.K. Science. 1998; 279: 700-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Deletion of amino acids 1–460 abolishes the ability of CBP to serve as a co-activator for CREB and STAT-1 but not for other transcription factors such as the retinoic acid receptor (5Kurokawa R. Kalafus D. Ogliastro M.-H. Kioussi C. Xu L. Torchia J. Rosenfeld M.G. Glass C.K. Science. 1998; 279: 700-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 6Swope D.L. Mueller C.L. Chrivia J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28138-28145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). In “squelching-type” assays, overexpression of CBP amino acids 1–460 has also been found to block the ability of full-length CBP to activate CREB-mediated transcription (5Kurokawa R. Kalafus D. Ogliastro M.-H. Kioussi C. Xu L. Torchia J. Rosenfeld M.G. Glass C.K. Science. 1998; 279: 700-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Studies from several laboratories indicate that this region of CBP contacts proteins, including TBP and P/CAF, which may be involved in the activation of transcription (5Kurokawa R. Kalafus D. Ogliastro M.-H. Kioussi C. Xu L. Torchia J. Rosenfeld M.G. Glass C.K. Science. 1998; 279: 700-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 6Swope D.L. Mueller C.L. Chrivia J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28138-28145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Microinjection studies support such a role for P/CAF by demonstrating that antibodies against P/CAF block the ability of a pGal-CBP-(1–450) chimera to activate transcription (13Korzus E. Torchia J. Rose D. Xu L. Kurokawa R. Mclnerney E.M. Mullen T.-M. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Science. 1998; 279: 703-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar). We have previously used studies with Gal-CBP chimeras to more precisely localize the transcription activation domain within the N-terminal end of CBP to amino acids 227–460 (5Kurokawa R. Kalafus D. Ogliastro M.-H. Kioussi C. Xu L. Torchia J. Rosenfeld M.G. Glass C.K. Science. 1998; 279: 700-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). To identify proteins that contact this region of CBP, we have utilized a yeast two-hybrid screen. Using this approach, we have identified a novel member of the Snf2 family of proteins and have termed it SRCAP (Snf2Related CBP ActivatorProtein). SRCAP contains the conserved ATPase domain found within other Snf2 family members, and here we demonstrate that immunopurified SRCAP functions as an ATPase. Results of co-transfection experiments indicate that the Gal-SRCAP chimera can activate transcription of a Gal-CAT reporter gene and that SRCAP can also enhance the ability of CBP to activate transcription. This suggests that in some circumstances SRCAP may function as a co-activator. The interaction of CBP and SRCAP is blocked by the adenoviral protein E1A, suggesting a novel mechanism for E1A-mediated transcriptional repression. To generate the plasmids pGal-CBP-(227–410), pGal-CBP-(280–460), and pGal-CBP-(227–460), PCR was used to generate a cDNA fragment encoding CBP amino acids 227–460, 280–460, and 227–410, which contain 5′ XbaI and 3′ BamHI sites. These were subcloned into the plasmid pRSV Gal-(1–147) (6Swope D.L. Mueller C.L. Chrivia J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28138-28145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) digested withXbaI and BamHI. To generate the plasmid pVP16, PCR was used to generate a cDNA fragment that encoded a methionine followed by amino acids 412–491 of VP16 (16Dalrymple M.A. McGeoch D.J. Davidson A.J. Preston C.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 7865-7879Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) and which contained a 5′XbaI site and a 3′ EcoRI site. This was subcloned into the plasmid pcDNA 3.1 (Invitrogen) digested withXbaI and EcoRI. The plasmid pVP16-clone 11 was generated by subcloning the clone 11 cDNA insert, obtained byEcoRI and BamHI digestion of the pGAD clone 11, into EcoRI- and BamHI-digested pVP16. The pAS1 CBP-(227–460) plasmid was made using PCR to generate a cDNA fragment encoding amino acids 227–460 of CBP, which containedEcoRI restriction sites at the ends. This was subcloned into the EcoRI site of the plasmid, pAS1. The plasmid pAS1 and the HeLa pGAD library were a gift of Paul MacDonald, St. Louis University, St. Louis MO. The pGal-VP16 chimera was a gift of R. Maurer, Oregon Health Sciences University, Portland, OR. The pGal-SRCAP-(1275–2971) plasmid was generated by subcloning the cDNA insert encoding SRCAP amino acids 1275–2971 obtained byNheI and BamHI digestion of the plasmid SRCAP-(1275–2971) (described below) into pRSV Gal-(1–147) digested with XbaI and BamHI. S. cerevisiae reporter host strain HF7c was co-transfected with the plasmid pAS1 CBP-(227–460) and the pGAD-HeLa library using a yeast transfection kit (CLONTECH) and grown as described (17Fields S. Methods: A Companion to Methods Enzymol. 1993; 5: 116-124Crossref Scopus (73) Google Scholar) in the presence of 10 mm 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole. The plasmid corresponding to clone 11 was isolated and sequenced by the dideoxy sequencing method. The cDNA corresponding to the AB0002307 sequence was generated by PCR. Briefly, complimentary PCR primers located at the beginning of the AB0002307 sequence and spaced about 1-kb apart were used to screen a human SKN plasmid library (Gift of S. Amara, Vollum Institute, Portland, OR). These primers were designed to introduce restriction enzyme sites that allow assembly of the full-length AB0002307 cDNA without introducing changes in the amino sequences. The most 5′-primer also encoded an initiator methionine and a consensus Kozak sequence. Following restriction digestion, the cDNA fragments were subcloned into the plasmid pcDNA 3.1 and named SRCAP-(1275–2971). The clone 11 cDNA was used to screen a cDNA plasmid library by homology. Using this approach, a series of overlapping cDNAs were obtained that extended the SRCAP coding sequences to 9126 base pairs. The sequences of all the clones were confirmed on both strands using an ABI automated DNA sequencer. HeLa cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 mg/ml penicillin, and 100 mg/ml streptomycin and were seeded at 1 × 105 cells per 3.5-cm dish 18 h prior to transfection. Each transfection utilized 200–300 ng of the pGAL-CAT reporter (pGAL4/E1b TATA) plasmid (6Swope D.L. Mueller C.L. Chrivia J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28138-28145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) and the indicated plasmids. The LipofectAMINE transfection method was used according to the directions of the manufacturer (Life Technologies, Inc.). Cells were harvested 48 h after transfection and assayed for CAT activity using the phase-extraction method (6Swope D.L. Mueller C.L. Chrivia J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28138-28145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Results were normalized to protein levels as determined by Bradford assay (33Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (218585) Google Scholar). For the labeling studies, A549 or 293 cells were incubated for 1 h with methionine/cysteine-deficient Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal bovine serum dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline, and penicillin/streptomycin and then metabolically labeled overnight in 1-ml of deficient Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and 0.25 mCi35[S]methionine/cysteine (EXPRESS Label, NEN Life Science Products). Labeled cells were lysed in 1 ml of p300 lysis buffer (18Yaciuk P. Moran E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5389-5397Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), and the supernatant was incubated with protein A-Sepharose beads and a monoclonal antibody raised to the C-terminal end of AB0002307 (SRCAP amino acids 2733–2971). Immune complexes were washed extensively, then boiled 2 min in 20 μl 2× Laemmli buffer, and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Radiolabeled proteins were visualized using a PhosphorImager. For the ATPase activity studies, nuclei of A459 cells were prepared by the method of Dignam et al. (19Dignam J.D. Levovotz R.M. Roeder R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9168) Google Scholar). The nuclei were incubated in p300 lysis buffer, centrifuged, and SRCAP immunoprecipitated by addition of anti-AB0002307 monoclonal antibody and protein A beads to the supernatant. In parallel experiments, control “mock” immunoprecipitations were performed by addition of protein A-Sepharose beads alone. Protein A beads containing the SRCAP protein were further washed with 1.0 m NaCl, 10 mmNa2PO4, pH 8, 0.5% Triton X-100 to remove nonspecifically bound proteins and followed by a final wash in ATPase buffer consisting of 20 mm Tris, pH 7.9, 0.1% Tween 20, 30 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. TheK m for ATP hydrolysis was determined as described by Cote et al. (20Cote J. Quinn J. Workman J.L. Peterson C.L. Science. 1994; 265: 53-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (726) Google Scholar). Briefly, 2–3 μl of SRCAP-protein A beads were incubated in 20 μl of ATPase buffer containing various amounts of cold ATP (10–300 μm) and 1 μCi [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol). Following a 20-min incubation at 30 °C, the unhydrolyzed ATP was removed by the addition of 150 μl of 10 mm phosphoric acid containing 5% activated charcoal (Sigma). The mixture was vortexed and centrifuged to pellet the charcoal, and the supernatant was removed to a new tube. An additional 150 μl of the phosphoric acid/charcoal solution was added, the mixture was vortexed and centrifuged, and the32Pi in the supernatant was counted. Specific32Pi released was determined by subtracting the nonspecific counts obtained from the mock immunoprecipitated protein A beads. To ensure the ATPase assay was within the linear range, various amounts of SRCAP-protein A beads (1–6 μl) were assayed as described in 100 μm cold ATP and 1 μCi [γ-32P]ATP. A yeast two-hybrid screen was employed to identify cDNA clones encoding proteins that contact CBP amino acids 227–460. In the initial screen an excess of fifty clones were obtained, and these were further analyzed by DNA sequencing. This analysis indicated that clone 11 shared sequence identity with an uncharacterized cDNA reported in GenBankTM (AB0002307) (Fig.1 A). A BLAST search with the AB0002307 sequences indicated it shared homology with two of the seven domains (V and VI) found within the ATPase domain conserved in proteins of the Snf2 family (Fig. 1 A.). Because of this homology, we decided to test whether the protein encoded by clone 11 interacted with CBP in mammalian cells. For this assay, we constructed a plasmid encoding a VP16-clone 11 chimera and co-transfected it with the plasmid encoding the Gal-CBP-(227–460) chimera. In these studies, the VP16-clone 11 chimera consistently increased about 1.5-fold the ability of the Gal-CBP-(227–460) chimera to activate transcription of the reporter gene pGal-CAT (data not shown). We reasoned that the small 1.5-fold activation of transcription observed occurred because the Gal-CBP-(227–460) chimera is a very strong transcriptional activator. To circumvent this problem, we tested interaction of the VP16-clone 11 chimera with the Gal-CBP-(227–410) and Gal-CBP-(280–460) chimeras, which contain small deletions that reduce but do not eliminate their ability to activate transcription. Shown in Fig.2, co-transfection of the plasmids encoding the VP16-clone 11 chimera with the plasmid encoding Gal-CBP-(280–460) activates transcription about 20-fold compared with that seen with the Gal-CBP-(280–460) chimera alone. Co-transfection of the plasmid encoding Gal-CBP-(280–460) with the plasmid encoding only the VP16 activation domain did not activate transcription, indicating that contact of the VP16-clone chimera with CBP is mediated by the clone 11 portion. The VP16-clone 11 chimera failed to activate transcription of the more active Gal-CBP-(227–410) chimera or Gal-(1–147), indicating that transcriptional activation is not because of a nonspecific effect.Figure 2CBP interacts in HeLa cells with SRCAP .The interaction of CBP and SRCAP cDNA (encoded by clone 11) was assessed using a mammalian two-hybrid assay. HeLa cells were transfected with 300 ng of reporter gene pGAL-CAT and with 600 ng of either pGal-CBP-(280–460), pGal-CBP-(227–410), or pGal-(1–147) and 600 ng of either pVP16, pVP16-clone 11, or pcDNA 3.1. The relative CAT enzymatic activity was determined by dividing CAT enzymatic activity of each sample by the transcriptional activity induced by the Gal-CBP-(280–460) chimera. Values are the means ± S.E. from three separate experiments in which each point was performed in triplicate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Based on the above results, we decided to clone the remainder of the AB0002307 cDNA. Using a combination of approaches (PCR and plasmid library screening), a 9.1-kb cDNA was obtained (Fig.1 A). This included the 5 kb of the AB0002307 cDNA and an additional 4.1 kb of new sequence at the 5′ end of the molecule. Within the AB0002307 sequence, we found several differences with the reported sequences, including an additional 111-base pair insertion at nucleotide 4128. The 9.1-kb composite sequence contains a continuous open reading frame. It, however, does not contain a termination codon (in the coding frame), raising uncertainty as to whether the cDNA clones obtained encode the full-length protein. The presumptive initiator ATG is positioned at nucleotide 217 and is the first ATG in the open reading that occurs in the context of a consensus Kozak sequence (21Kozak M. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 229-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (2816) Google Scholar). Using this ATG as a translational start site, a protein of 2971 amino acids with a predicted molecular weight of 315 kDa is obtained. This size is consistent with immunoprecipitation studies in which anti-AB0002307 antibodies detect a protein which migrates slower in SDS-PAGE gels than CBP (predicted molecular mass of 265 kDa, Fig.3.). A search of the NCBI data base with the AB0002307 sequence indicated that it contains a complete ATPase domain that consists of seven highly conserved regions (I, Ia–VI) which are dispersed over the length of the protein. Based on the homology to Snf2 family members and, as described below, on the ability to enhance CBP-mediated transcription, we have named this protein SRCAP. A comparison of the amino acid sequence of the SRCAP ATPase domain to the amino acid sequence of the ATPase domains found in other members of the Snf2 family is shown in Fig. 1 B. To test whether SRCAP like other members of the Snf2 family functions as an ATPase, we immunoprecipitated SRCAP protein from nuclear extracts of A549 cells using the anti-AB0002307 monoclonal antibody and protein A-Sepharose beads. Shown in Fig.4 A, incubation of the SRCAP-protein A beads in ATPase buffer containing 100 μmcold ATP and 1 μCi [γ-32P]ATP resulted in the release of 32Pi, indicating the hydrolysis of ATP was occurring. The specific ATPase activity of SRCAP was determined by subtracting out the nonspecific ATPase activity that bound to protein A in the absence of the anti-AB0002307 antibody. As shown, a linear increase in the specific ATPase activity was observed with increasing amounts of SRCAP-protein A beads. To determine theK m for the hydrolysis of ATP by SRCAP, 2 μl of SRCAP-protein A beads were incubated with 1 μCi [γ-32P]ATP and either 10, 30, 100, or 300 μm cold ATP. A plot of 1/d[Pi]/dTversus 1/[ATP] for three experiments is shown in Fig.4 B and indicated SRCAP has a K m for hydrolysis of ATP of 66 μm. Several members of the Snf2 gene family have been found to regulate transcription when tethered to a promoter by a heterologous DNA binding domain. This prompted us to ask whether SRCAP was a transcriptional activator. For these studies, we tested the ability of a plasmid encoding a Gal-SRCAP-(1275–2971) chimera to activate transcription of the Gal-CAT reporter gene in HeLa cells. Shown in Fig.5, this chimera activated transcription about 12-fold over the level of transcription induced by Gal-(1–147) and to about the same level as that observed with the Gal-CBP-(1–2441) chimera. To test whether SRCAP influenced the ability of CBP to activate transcription, we co-transfected the plasmid encoding SRCAP amino acids 1275–2971 with the plasmid encoding Gal-CBP-(1–2441). Shown in Fig.6, SRCAP enhanced the ability of the Gal-CBP to activate transcription about 2.5-fold. This enhancement of transcription was specific because SRCAP did not enhance the ability of Gal-VP16 to activate transcription. Co-transfection of the plasmid encoding the CBP-(1–2441) along with the plasmid encoding the Gal-SRCAP-(1275–2971) chimera did not result in a further increase in transcription (data not shown). The inability of exogenously introduced CBP to activate SRCAP transcription activity suggests that CBP is either not limiting in HeLa cells or that SRCAP does not function to activate transcription by recruitment of CBP. Consistent with this latter hypothesis, we have found that a Gal-clone 11 chimera which encodes the CBP binding domain of SRCAP does not activate transcription in either HeLa or F-9 cells (data not shown). The recent studies which indicate that the adenoviral protein E1A binds to the N-terminal end of CBP and inhibits the ability of a Gal-CBP-(1–450) chimera to activate transcription prompted us to determine whether E1A inhibits binding of SRCAP to CBP (5Kurokawa R. Kalafus D. Ogliastro M.-H. Kioussi C. Xu L. Torchia J. Rosenfeld M.G. Glass C.K. Science. 1998; 279: 700-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Shown in Fig. 7, transfection of plasmids encoding wild type E1A decreased transcription stimulated by interaction of the Gal-CBP-(280–460) with the VP16-clone 11 chimera. In contrast, co-transfection with a plasmid encoding an E1A mutant (RG2) that does not bind CBP did not disrupt SRCAP and CBP interaction. In the present paper we report the cloning of SRCAP, a novel member of the Snf2 gene family. The Snf2 family of genes consists of a number of proteins with diverse functions, including remodeling chromatin, regulation of transcription, and DNA repair (reviewed in Ref. 20Cote J. Quinn J. Workman J.L. Peterson C.L. Science. 1994; 265: 53-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (726) Google Scholar). A common feature of the Snf2 family of proteins is the presence of a highly conserved domain called the Snf2 domain, which functions as an ATPase (23Laurent B.C. Treich I. Carson M. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 583-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). This ATPase domain consists of seven highly conserved motifs interspersed with variable spacers of nonconserved sequences. The entire Snf2 domain is contained in about 400 amino acids in most Snf2 family members (Snf2, Iswi, Chd1, Rad16, and Mot-1) and is contained in about 670 amino acids in others (P113 and Hip116) (24Zhang Q. Ekhterae D. Kin K.-H. Gene. 1997; 202: 31-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The Snf2 domain of SRCAP is unique in that the ATPase domain is dispersed in a much larger region of about 1465 amino acids (Fig. 1 B). Despite the unique spacing between the conserved motifs, the conservation of residues within the ATPase domain is striking. Consistent with this homology, we have found that SRCAP functions as an ATPase with a K m for ATP hydrolysis of 66 μm which is similar to the reported K mfor hydrolysis of ATP by yeast Snf2 of 45 μm (20Cote J. Quinn J. Workman J.L. Peterson C.L. Science. 1994; 265: 53-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (726) Google Scholar). The ATPase activity of recombinant yeast Snf2 protein (purified from bacteria) has been reported to be stimulated 5-fold by DNA (23Laurent B.C. Treich I. Carson M. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 583-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). In contrast, the ATPase activity of SRCAP (purified from A549 cells) was not stimulated by DNA (data not shown). This result suggests that the regulation of the ATPase activity of SRCAP and yeast Snf2 may occur through distinct mechanisms. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that the lack of DNA dependence observed for the ATPase activity of SRCAP is because of differences in the protein purification protocols used, e.g. which may allow DNA to co-purify with SRCAP but not yeast Snf2. The ATPase domain has been shown to be critical for the function of several Snf2 family members. The yeast Snf2 protein is the prototype of this family. It functions as part of a multiple subunit SWI/SNF complex that appears to alleviate the repression of transcription of some promoters induced by chromatin through a process termed chromatin remodeling (reviewed in Ref. 25Peterson C.L. Tamkun J.L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 143-147Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). Although the specific mechanisms for chromatin remodeling are not completely known, it allows the binding of transcription factors to sites previously inaccessible because of the presence of nucleosomes. Mutant yeast Snf2 molecules, in which the ATPase function has been deleted, neither function in chromatin remodeling assays nor are able to activate transcription (23Laurent B.C. Treich I. Carson M. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 583-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). ATPase activity is also required for transcriptional repression mediated by the Snf2 family member MOT-1 (26Muchardt C. Yaniv M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4279-4290Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar), which utilizes ATP to dissociate TBP from DNA. However, as discussed below, the ATPase activity of SRCAP is not needed for SRCAP-mediated transcriptional activation. Although this result differs from that obtained for the yeast Snf2, an analogous finding has been reported for the human Snf2 protein (hSnf2α) (27Auble D.T. Wangt D. Post K.W. Hahn S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4842Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Similar to our studies with SRCAP, when human Snf2α is tethered to DNA by a heterologous DNA binding domain, the ATPase function is not required for activation of transcription. However, the ATPase function is essential for human Snf2α potentiation of glucocorticoid receptor-mediated transcription (27Auble D.T. Wangt D. Post K.W. Hahn S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4842Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that activation of transcription by human Snf2 (and perhaps SRCAP) occurs through several distinct mechanisms, one requiring the ATPase function and one that does not. How the SRCAP might activate transcription is not yet known. In the case of human Snf2α, deletion of the highly charged domain results in loss of transcriptional activity (27Auble D.T. Wangt D. Post K.W. Hahn S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4842Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The C-terminal end of SRCAP also contains a highly charged domain, made up of clusters of acidic and basic residues, which may contribute in a similar fashion to the ability of SRCAP to activate transcription. Examination of the primary structure of the SRCAP indicates that, in addition to binding CBP, it also likely binds to DNA. Shown in Fig.1 A, the C-terminal domain contains four copies of the motif KR(R/K)RGRP(P/R), of which multiple copies are also found in DNA binding proteins (chromosomal protein D1 and HMG-1), where it is thought to mediate the binding of these proteins to A-T-rich regions by contacts in the minor groove of DNA (28Ashley C.T. Pendleton C.G. Jennings W.W. Saxena A. Glover C.V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8394-8401Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Churchill M.E.A. Travers A.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 92-97Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). A similar motif is found in the C-terminal end of human homologs of yeast Snf2 (hSnf2α and β) and within the DNA binding domain of the Snf2 gene family protein CHD1 (30Chiba H. Muramatsu M. Nomoto A. Kato H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 1815-1820Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar, 31Stokes D.G. Perry R.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2745-2753Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The adenoviral protein E1A exerts several biological activities including transformation of cells and activation or repression of cellular and viral genes (reviewed in Ref. 32Moran E. Sem. Virol. 1994; 5: 237-340Crossref Scopus (53) Google Scholar). E1A blocks the ability of CBP to function as a co-activator for a number of transcription factors and binds to three distinct sites within CBP: amino acids 1–460, 1805–1891, and 2058–2163 (5Kurokawa R. Kalafus D. Ogliastro M.-H. Kioussi C. Xu L. Torchia J. Rosenfeld M.G. Glass C.K. Science. 1998; 279: 700-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 12Yang X.J. Ogryzko V.V. Nishikawa J.

Nature. 1995; 374: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar, 15Arany Z. Newsome D. Olread E. Livingston D.M. Erkner R. Nature. 1995; 374: 81-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar). Understanding how association of E1A with CBP alters the ability of CBP to function as a co-activator has come from studies that demonstrate that E1A binding competitively excludes binding of several proteins shown to be critical for CBP co-activator function. Binding of E1A to CBP amino acids 1805–1891 prevents binding of the histone acetyltransferase P/CAF, whereas E1A binding to CBP amino acids 2058–2163 prevents binding of the co-activator P/CIP (5Kurokawa R. Kalafus D. Ogliastro M.-H. Kioussi C. Xu L. Torchia J. Rosenfeld M.G. Glass C.K. Science. 1998; 279: 700-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 12Yang X.J. Ogryzko V.V. Nishikawa J. Howard B.H. Nakatani Y. Nature. 1996; 382: 319-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (1325) Google Scholar). Although P/CAF also binds to amino acids 1–460 of CBP, competition between P/CAF and E1A binding has not been demonstrated. In our studies, we have found that E1A binding to amino acids 280–460 of CBP excludes the binding of SRCAP to CBP, suggesting that this represents an additional method by which E1A represses the co-activator function of CBP. The primary structure of SRCAP indicates that it belongs to the Snf2 family of proteins that function to modify protein-DNA interactions, suggesting that SRCAP plays a similar role. Consistent with this notion, our results indicate that SRCAP interacts with CBP and influences its ability to activate transcription. Recent studies have indicated that different promoters which utilize CBP to activate transcription have different requirements for co-activators. For example, both P/CAF and P/CIP have been found to be required for activation of a CRE-reporter gene, whereas P/CIP but not P/CAF is required for transcription of a GAS-reporter gene (13Korzus E. Torchia J. Rose D. Xu L. Kurokawa R. Mclnerney E.M. Mullen T.-M. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Science. 1998; 279: 703-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar). It, therefore, seems likely that SRCAP may function to enhance CBP-mediated transcription at some but not all promoters."

Reduced folate carrier-deficient Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing each of these constructs were probed with anti-hemagglutinin epitope monoclonal antibodies to assess whether the insertion was exposed to the external environment or to the cytoplasm. The results are consistent with the 12-transmembrane topology predicted for this protein. The hemagglutinin epitope insertion mutants were also tested for their effects on the function of the reduced folate carrier. For these studies, each of the constructs had a carboxyl-terminal fusion of the enhanced green fluorescent protein to monitor and quantitate expression. Insertions into the external loop between transmembrane regions 7 and 8 (Pro-297), the cytoplasmic loop between transmembrane regions 6 and 7 (Ser-225), and near the cytoplasmic amino and carboxyl termini (Pro-20 and Gly-492, respectively) had minor effects on methotrexate binding and uptake. The insertion into the cytoplasmic loop between transmembrane regions 10 and 11 (Gln-385) greatly reduced both binding and uptake of methotrexate, whereas the insertion into the external loop between transmembrane regions 11 and 12 (Pro-427) selectively interfered with uptake but not binding.

MtxRII 5-3 is an Mtx-resistant cell line that is defective in reduced folate transport because it does not express the rfc mRNA (15Williams F.M.R. Murray R.C. Underhill T.M. Flintoff W.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5810-5816Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For transient transfections, MtxRII 5-3 cells were grown on sterile round glass coverslips placed in 24-well tissue culture plates and incubated with 0.2 μg of plasmid DNA complexed with LipofectAMINETM. After addition of α-medium containing 20% fetal bovine serum to each well, the cells were incubated a further 18 h prior to immunofluorescence labeling and microscopy. Stable transfectants of MtxRII 5-3 cells were obtained using the Polybrene procedure described previously (44Chaney W.G. Howard D.R. Pollard J.W. Sallustio S. Stanley P. Somatic Cell Genet. 1986; 12: 237-244Crossref Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Stable clones of the HA insertion constructs in either the 5′ΔRFC or 5′ΔRFC-EGFP background (described below) were selected and maintained in folic acid-free medium containing 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum and 2 nmfolinic acid (45Underhill T.M. Flintoff W.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 1754-1758Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Stable clones of MtxRII 5-3 cells transfected with the 5′ΔRFC-EGFP fusion products were also selected with G418 (1.2 mg/ml) in α-medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Individual colonies resistant to G418 were screened by fluorescence microscopy to ensure expression of the fusion protein. Three to five clones of each transfectant from the low folinic acid and the G418 selection regimes were isolated by limiting dilution from independently generated transfectants. The phenotype of transfectants selected for growth in low folinic acid medium were tested for Mtx resistance by dose-response curves, as described previously (43Flintoff W.F. Davidson S.V. Siminovitch L. Somatic Cell Genet. 1976; 2: 245-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). The G418-selected transfectant clones were used for Mtx uptake and binding assays (46Underhill T.M. Flintoff W.F. Somatic Cell Mol. Genet. 1989; 15: 49-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 47Flintoff W.F. Nagainis C.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1983; 223: 433-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In all experiments, at least two independently selected clones were used for the analyses. The human influenza virus HA epitope (YPYDVPDYA) was inserted into selected sites of therfc cDNA by two strategies. In the first approach, based on that described by Canfield and Levenson (34Canfield V. Levenson R. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 13782-13786Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), the cDNA was digested at unique restriction endonuclease sites (ApaI, 254; NotI, 883; CpoI, 1374; StuI, 1570; numbering based on the human rfc cDNA reported in Ref. 16Williams F.M.R. Flintoff W.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2987-2992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) predicted to be in intra- or extracellular loops. These were blunt-ended using either nuclease S1 or the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I, as appropriate to maintain reading frame, and treated with calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase. HA oligonucleotides of the sense strand were synthesized with either one or two additional G deoxyribonucleotides at the 5′ end (see oligos 1 and 2 of TableI). Each was annealed with an equimolar amount of the antisense HA oligonucleotide (oligo 3) which contains two additional G residues at the 5′ end. The double-stranded products were blunt-ended either with nuclease S1 or the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I, as appropriate to maintain reading frame, treated with T4 polynucleotide kinase, and ligated using molar ratios of insert:linearized plasmid of 5:1 and 1:1. The HA insertion constructs were used to transform XL1-Blue Escherichia coli(Stratagene). Positive clones were selected by hybridization with [γ-32P]dCTP end-labeled oligo 3 and verified by DNA sequencing. Because of the insertion strategy at the CpoI site (HA-P427), an extra valine residue was inserted at the carboxyl end of the HA epitope.Table IOligonucleotides for constructing HA insertionsOligonucleotide15′-GTACCCTTACGACGTGCCTGATTACGCT-3′25′-GGTACCCTTACGACGTGCCTGATTACGCT-3′35′-GGAGCGTAATCAGGCACGTCGTAAGGGTA-3′45′-CTTCTTCAACCGCGACGACC-3′55′-TCAGATCTTGGTTCACATTCTGAACACC-3′HA epitope insertions were by the method of Canfield and Levensen (34Canfield V.

The underlined nucleotides in oligo 5 indicate the BglII restriction site replacing therfc stop codon. The second HA insertion strategy was based on the two-step PCR method described by Howard et al. (35Howard M. DuVall M.D. Devor D.C. Dong J.-Y. Henze K. Frizzell R.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: C1565-C1576Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), using the primer sets and templates listed in Table II .The PCR reactions contained standard PCR buffer (48Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 14.15Google Scholar), 1 ng of template, and optimized levels of MgCl2. In some cases the reactions included 10% Me2SO. The PCR cycler parameters were as follows: (i) “hot start”: 1 min at 94 °C, then 5 min at 80 °C, during which the Taq DNA polymerase was added; (ii) 26 cycles of amplification: 1 min at 94 °C, 1 min at 52 °C, 2.5 min at 72 °C; and (iii) final extension for 8 min at 72 °C. The products were separated on agarose gels, and the band of the correct size was purified by the Geneclean procedure (Bio 101). The two “first-step” products for each set were diluted, mixed, and used as the template for the second round of PCR. The extension primers for each reaction were the same as used in the first round of PCR (TableII), and the same PCR conditions were used. The second-step products were purified as above, digested with either HindIII andEcoRI or ApaI and EcoRI, and cloned into the p5′ΔRFC and p5′ΔRFC-EGFP vectors described below. The HA insertion mutants are named according to the amino acid that precedes the HA epitope (i.e. HA-P20 is the HA epitope inserted after Pro-20).Table IIOligonucleotides for HA insertions by two-step PCRPrimer setHA insertion primersExtension primersTemplate1a.5′-GAACCTGGGCCTGACCCCTACCCTTACGACGTGCCTGATTACGCTGAGCTCCGGTCCTGGCG-3′5′-GTCGCTCTGTCTCTGCTCCA-3′p5′ΔRFC1b.5′-CGCCAGGACCGGAGCTCAGCGTAATCAGGCACGTCGTAAGGGTAGGGGTCAGGCCCAGGTTC-3′T7 primerp5′ΔRFC2a.5′-GCGCGCTACCAGCGTGTGTACCCTTACGACGTGCCTGATTACGCTGCCGGCTACTCGCGCG-3′5′-TCAGATCTTGGTTCACATTCTGAACACC-3′pHuMtxT42b.5′-CGCGCGAGTAGCCGGCAGCGTAATCAGGCACGTCGTAAGGGTACACACGCTGGTAGCGCGC-3′T7 primerp5′ΔRFC3a.5′-CGAAACCTCGGCTTCGTACCCTTACGACGTGCCTGATTACGCTGAGCTGGAGCGCATGAA-3′5′-TCAGATCTTGGTTCACATTCTGAACACC-3′pHuMtxT43b.5′-TTCATGCGCTCCAGCTCAGCGTAATCAGGCACGTCGTAAGGGTACGAAGCCGAGGTTTCG-3′5′-TACGGCTTCATGGCGCAGATAC-3′pHuMtxT44a.5′-TGGAACGAGGTGGACCCCTACCCTTACGACGTGCCTGATTACGCTACCACCAACAGTGCGCGG-3′5′-TCAGATCTTGGTTCACATTCTGAACACC-3′pHuMtxT44b.5′-CCGCGCACTGTTGGTGGTAGCGTAATCAGGCACGTCGTAAGGGTAGGGGTCCACCTCGTTCCA-3′T7 primerp5′ΔRFC5a.5′-GCCCATCGCCACCTTTCAGTACCCTTACGACGTGCCTGATTACGCTATTGCATCTTCTCTGTCTAAAGAGCTCT-3′5′-TCAGATCTTGGTTCACATTCTGAACACC-3′pHuMtxT45b.5′-AGAGCTCTTTAGACAGAGAAGATGCAATAGCGTAATCAGGCACGTCGTAAGGGTACTGAAAGGTGGCGATGGGC-3′T7 primerp5′ΔRFCThe forward and reverse primers and template of set 1a were used for PCR amplification of the upstream portion proximal to and including the HA insertion.

The expression plasmid pRFC contains nt −94 to +1937 of the rfc cDNA from pHuMtxT4 (16Williams F.M.R. Flintoff W.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2987-2992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) cloned into the pcDNA3 expression vector (Invitrogen). This construct lacks most of the rfc 3′-UTR including the polyadenylation signal. Plasmid p5′ΔRFC contains nt +1 to +1937 of the human RFC. The enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) was fused in-frame to the carboxyl terminus of therfc gene in p5′ΔRFC by replacing the stop codon with aBglII site. Using oligos 4 and 5 (Table I) as PCR primers, the EcoRI-BglII fragment of the rfc(nt 1697–1870) was amplified and cloned into a pcDNA3-based plasmid which contained the BamHI-NotI fragment of pEGFP-N1 (CLONTECH). The resulting plasmid, containing the 3′ end of the rfc gene fused to the EGFP, was linearized with HindIII and EcoRI, and theHindIII-EcoRI fragment of p5′ΔRFC was inserted to produce p5′ΔRFC-EGFP. The HA insertion constructs in the p5′ΔRFC and p5′ΔRFC-EGFP backgrounds were purified by the Qiagen Plasmid Midi Kit (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA). The EGFP fusion constructs were used in transfections to determine the cellular localization of the protein and for the Mtx binding and uptake studies; the HA insertion constructs without the fusion were used for anti-HA immunofluorescence microscopy to determine protein topology. The transiently transfected cells on coverslips were washed twice with PBS (1× PBS, pH 7.4, contains 137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 8.3 mmNa2HPO4, 1.5 mmKH2PO4, 0.9 mmCaCl2, and 0.5 mm MgCl2) and fixed 30 min at room temperature with freshly prepared 2% paraformaldehyde in 0.5× PBS. The cells were washed twice with PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin and 0.02% sodium azide (PBS-plus). Cells in one well of each series were permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100® in PBS at room temperature and then washed three times with PBS-plus. All cells were incubated at room temperature with 12CA5 mouse monoclonal antibody (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and then washed twice with PBS-plus. Permeabilized and non-permeabilized cells were washed once with PBS containing 0.05% Triton X-100 to remove nonspecifically bound antibody. The cells were washed twice with PBS-plus and stored overnight at 4 °C in PBS-plus. The next day, the cells were incubated at room temperature with goat anti-mouse IgG, fluorescein isothiocyanate conjugate (BIOSOURCE International, Camarillo, CA) in PBS-plus containing 10% goat serum. The cells were washed as before. The coverslips were placed on slides with mounting medium containing the DNA binding fluor DAPI, sealed, and viewed with a Zeiss Axioskop fluorescence microscope with 488 nm excitation. Images were captured using a Sony CCD digital camera and analyzed using Northern EclipseTM (version 2.0) software (Empix Imaging, Inc., Toronto, Ontario, Canada). Uptake and binding experiments were performed as described previously (46Underhill T.M. Flintoff W.F. Somatic Cell Mol.

Total cellular protein was quantified by the Bradford method (49Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (214321) Google Scholar). To normalize for specific expression of the HA-RFC-EGFP fusion proteins, the mean fluorescence values for each clone was determined by flow cytometry (FACScan, Becton-Dickinson) using MtxRII 5-3 cells as the control for cell size and background fluorescence parameters. The clones expressing the RFC-EGFP fusion proteins had mean fluorescence values at least 15 times greater than the control cells. G418-selected HA-RFC-EGFP transfectant cells were pelleted after growth in suspension culture, and ∼2 × 106 cells were washed twice with chilled PBS, resuspended in 100 μl of protease protection buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.15 m NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 1.0% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 60 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 20 μg/ml pepstatin, 0.2 mm orthovanadate, and 5× concentrated Protease inhibitor mixture tablets (Roche Molecular Biochemicals)), and flash frozen at −80 °C. After the samples were thawed on ice, the proteins were precipitated with 10 volumes of acetone, resuspended in Laemmli buffer (50Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Cr"
https://openalex.org/W2125081100,"Analysis of CCR5 variants in human immunodeficiency virus, type 1 (HIV-1), high risk cohorts led to the identification of multiple single amino acid substitutions in the amino-terminal third of the HIV-1 co-receptor CCR5 suggesting the possibility of protective and permissive genotypes; unfortunately, the low frequency of these mutations did not led to correlation with function. Therefore, we used analytical methods to assess the functional and structural significance of six of these variant receptors in vitro. These studies showed three categories of effects on CCR5 function. 1) Mutations in the first extracellular domain of CCR5 severely reduce specific ligand binding and chemokine-induced chemotaxis. 2) An extracellular domain variant, A29S, when co-expressed with CD4, supported HIV-1 infection whereas the others do not. 3) The transmembrane region variants of CCR5 support monotropic HIV-1 infection that is blocked by addition of some receptor agonists. Mutations in the first and second transmembrane domains increase RANTES (regulated on activation normal T-cell expressed) binding affinity but did not affect MIP1β binding affinity presumably based on differences in ligand-receptor interaction sites. Furthermore, the CCR5 transmembrane mutants do not respond to RANTES with the classical bell-shaped chemotactic response curve, suggesting that they are resistant to RANTES-induced desensitization. These data demonstrate that single amino acid changes in the extracellular domains of CCR5 can have profound effects on both HIV-1 co-receptor and specific ligand-induced functions, whereas mutations in the transmembrane domain only affect the response to chemokine ligands.

Virus infection begins with the binding of viral gp120 envelope protein to cellular CD4, initiating a conformational change. A segment of gp120 V3 loop subsequently interacts with the amino-terminal domains of the targeted chemokine co-receptor. This interaction supports the formation of a fusigenic complex between gp41 and cellular components (4Chan D.C. Kim P.S. Cell. 1998; 93: 681-684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1108) Google Scholar).

Later, the disease involves primarily lymphotropic HIV-1 strains that utilize CXCR4 as a co-receptor. The endogenous chemokine receptor ligands inhibit HIV-1 entry by blocking the formation of the fusigenic pore.Data supporting an essential role for the chemokine receptors in HIV pathology comes from population genetic studies that have shown variants of CCR2 and CCR5 genes to reduce HIV susceptibility and/or progression to AIDS (12Dean M.

One modification of CCR5 is a deletion in the coding region of CCR5 that leads to a truncated nonfunctional receptor, the delta 32 mutant (CCR5Δ32), protects against infection in homozygous individuals, and delays onset of AIDS in heterozygous individuals (12Dean M.

Another variant, characterized by a single base pair change in the CCR5 promotor, correlates with delayed onset of AIDS. These studies indicate thein vivo importance of CCR5 in HIV pathogenesis.Additional population analyses of CCR5 for genetic variants has identified several rare alleles (17Carrington M. Kissner T.

While these variants may affect the function of CCR5, population genetic analysis cannot tell us if these are likely to be protective changes. To evaluate their role in chemokine receptor function and HIV-1 entry, we expressed individual variants in human embryonic kidney cells (HEK-293). The first and second extracellular domains of CCR5 have been shown to participate in chemokine binding and HIV-1 fusion (18Rabut G.E. Konner J.A. Kajumo F. Moore J.P. Dragic T. J.

Thus, we have focused our studies on six codon altering allelic variants located between amino acid residues 1 and 100 of CCR5. We have investigated not only the ability of these variants to support HIV-1 infection, but also the effect of these variations on chemokine binding and chemokine-induced cell migration. Furthermore, we tested the ability of chemokines and a chemokine co-receptor-specific inhibitor, NSC 651016, to block HIV-1 infection of cells expressing these CCR5 variants.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESUnless otherwise stated all chemicals were purchased from Sigma. The distamycin analog NSC 651016 (2,2′[4,4′[[aminocarbonyl]amino]bis[N,4′-di[pyrrole-2-carboxamide-1,1′-dimethyl]]-6,8-naphthalenedisulfonic acid]hexasodium salt) was provided to the National Cancer Institute by Pharmacia Upjohn/Farmaitalia. The Drug Synthesis and Chemistry Branch, Developmental Therapeutics Program Division of Cancer Treatment, National Cancer Institute, was the immediate source of the reagent used in this study. Chemokines were purchased from the National Institutes of Health cytokine repository.Site-directed MutagenesisPlasmids that direct the expression of mutated species of CCR5 were generated by overlap PCR mutagenesis and subsequent fragment replacement. Primers were designed adjacent to the mutation site. The two fragments were extended and amplified as a single fragment and cloned into the pCRII vector. After sequence confirmation the HindIII-ClaI fragment was cloned into pcDNA (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). All constructs were confirmed by DNA sequence analysis of the entire open reading frame of CCR5. The receptors were named based on the mutation and its position. Individual amino acids (the corresponding codon) and the amino acid position are listed here for each mutant as follows: I(ATC)12T(ACC), C(TCG)20S (AGC), A(GCA)29S(TCA), I(ATC)42F(TTC), L(CTG)55Q(CAG), A(GCC)73V(GTC).CellsHEK-293 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (BioWhittaker, Walkersville, MD) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone, Logan, UT) and 2 mm glutamine and 100 units/ml penicillin and streptomycin (Quality Biologicals, Gaithersburg, MD). Parental HEK-293 cells were transfected with linearized CCR5 mammalian expression constructs by electroporation (21Howard O.M.Z. Kirken R.A. Garcia G.G. Hackett R.H. Farrar W.L. Biochem. J. 1995; 306: 217-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). After selection in media containing 400 mg/ml Geneticin (Life Technologies, Inc.) for 2 weeks, single cell cloning was performed. Three single cell clones were isolated for each mutant. HEK-CCR5 variant clones with similar receptor numbers, determined by binding assays or fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS), were chosen for additional analysis.Fluorescence-activated Cell Sorting (FACS)Monoclonal antibodies were a kind gift from Dr. Monica Tsang of R & D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Monoclonal antibody clone 45549.111, which binds to a carboxyl-terminal extracellular domain, was used in these studies. FACS analysis was performed as described previously (21Howard O.M.Z. Kirken R.A. Garcia G.G. Hackett R.H. Farrar W.L. Biochem. J. 1995; 306: 217-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar).Binding StudiesBinding assays were performed in triplicate by adding increasing amounts of unlabeled competitor and constant radiolabeled chemokine, 0.2 ng/assay (RANTES-NEX 292 and MIP1β-NEX 299, NEN Life Science Products), to individual 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tubes (22Leonard E.J. Sylvester I. Yoshimura T. Taub D.D. Oppenheim J.J. Wang J.M. Lloyd A. Coligan J.E. Kruisbeek A.M. Margulies D.H. Shevach E.M. Strober W. Current Protocols in Immunology. Greene Publishing Associates and John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1995: 6.12.1-6.12.28Google Scholar). 200 μl/samples of cells (2 × 106cells/ml) suspended in binding media (RPMI 1640, 1% bovine serum albumin, 5 mm HEPES, pH 8.0) were added to the tubes and mixed by continuous rotation at room temperature for 45 min. After incubation the cells were centrifuged through a 10% sucrose/PBS cushion, and the cell-associated radioactivity was measured using a 1272 Wallac gamma counter. A minimum of four independent binding assays were performed in triplicate for each CCR5 variant. Scatchard analysis was performed using LIGAND (Peter Munson, Analytical Biostatistics, National Institutes of Health).ChemotaxisHEK-293 cells transfected with CCR5 point mutants were resuspended in binding media (RPMI 1640 media containing 1% bovine serum albumin, 25 mm HEPES, pH 8.0) at 7.5 × 105 cells/ml. Chemokines, diluted in binding media, were placed in the lower wells of a micro-chemotaxis chamber (Neuroprobe, Cabin John, MD). Ten micrometer polyvinyl-free polycarbonate membranes (Neuroprobe) were treated with 47 μg/ml rat tail collagen type I (Collaborative Biomedical Products, Bedford, MA) in RPMI 1640 overnight, dried, and placed over the chemoattractants. After the micro-chemotaxis chamber was assembled, 50 μl of cells were placed in the upper wells. The filled chemotaxis chambers were incubated in a humidified CO2 incubator for 5.5–6.0 h. After incubation the membranes were removed from the chemotaxis chamber assembly followed by gently removing cells from the upper side of the membrane. The cells on the lower side of the membrane were stained using a Diff-Quik kit (Trends Scientific, Kalamazoo, MI). The stained and dried membrane was mounted, and the cells on the underside of the membrane were counted at a × 200 magnification. The results are reported as the average number of cells per high powered field at a given chemokine concentration.HIV-1 Infection of HEK-CCR5 Variant TransfectantsStably transfected HEK-CCR5 variants were co-transfected by electroporation with a CD4 expression vector (23Howard O.M. Korte T. Tarasova N.I. Grimm M. Turpin J.A. Rice W.G. Michejda C.J. Blumenthal R. Oppenheim J.J. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1998; 64: 6-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Following electroporation, cells were cultured for 24 h without geneticin followed by removal of the nonadherent cells. The adherent cells were counted and plated at a density of 105/well in a 24-well plate for overnight culture. Medium was removed, and the cultures were pretreated for 30 min with 1 μg/ml RANTES, MIP1β, 10 μm NSC 651016 or 10 μg/ml of dextran sulfate. Dextran sulfate serves as a background control for receptor-mediated virus infection in these semi-quantitative pro-viral DNA assays. Lymphotropic HIV-1RF (uses CXCR4 as primary co-receptor) or monotropic HIV-1Ba-L (uses CCR5 as primary co-receptor) (m.o.i. of 1 to 0.1) was added, and cultures were continued for 24 h. The cells were lysed and genomic DNA isolated by the protease K/phenol/chloroform method (24Zack J.A. Arrigio S.J. Weitsman S.R. Go A.S. Haislip A. Chen I.S. Cell. 1990; 61: 213-222Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1288) Google Scholar). PCR was performed on 0.5 μg of DNA using the M661/M667 primer pair to identify late reverse transcription products (24Zack J.A. Arrigio S.J. Weitsman S.R. Go A.S. Haislip A. Chen I.S. Cell. 1990; 61: 213-222Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1288) Google Scholar). The PCR conditions were previously reported and shown to be semi-quantitative (24Zack J.A. Arrigio S.J. Weitsman S.R. Go A.S. Haislip A. Chen I.S. Cell. 1990; 61: 213-222Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1288) Google Scholar). Following PCR, each sample was ethanol-precipitated and quantitatively transferred to a 2% agarose gel. The amount of proviral gag DNA was visualized by ethidium bromide staining. The results were photographically documented (UVP, Image Store, Upland, CA) at a 1:1 ratio. DNA from uninfected CEM-SS cells was used for the PCR-negative control, and DNA from HIV-1RF-infected CEM-SS cells was used for the PCR-positive control. Densitometry was performed using NIH Image version 1.61 (NIH shareware).DISCUSSIONPopulation genetic studies have shown that CCR5 is an important component of AIDS pathology. Furthermore, individuals heterozygotic for CCR5Δ32 have less inflammation and less severe disease associated with rheumatoid arthritis (33Garred P. Madsen H.O. Petersen J. Marquart H. Hansen T.M. Freiesleben Sorensen S. Volck B. Svejgaard A. Andersen V. J. Rheumatol. 1998; 25: 1462-1465PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, mice with homologous deletion of functional CCR5 show reduced resistance to bacterial challenge and reduced T-cell function (34Zhou Y. Kurihara T. Ryseck R.P. Yang Y. Ryan C. Loy J. Warr G. Bravo R. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 4018-4025PubMed Google Scholar). These studies indicate that it is important to identify variations in the CCR5 receptor gene and characterize the resulting changes in receptor function. Earlier, Carrington et al. (17Carrington M. Kissner T. Gerrard B. Ivanov S. O'Brien S.J. Dean M. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1997; 61: 1261-1267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) reported several rare allelic variants that might alter the function of the CCR5 receptor, but the sample size (700–5,000 depending on the cohort) was too small to study their epidemiological effect. Previous mutational analysis suggested that the amino terminus of CCR5 may be essential for HIV-1 binding, specifically a tyrosine-rich region in the first extracellular domain (18Rabut G.E. Konner J.A. Kajumo F. Moore J.P. Dragic T. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 3464-3468Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Hill C.M. Kwon D. Jones M. Davis C.B. Marmon S. Daugherty B.L. DeMartino J.A. Springer M.S. Unutmaz D. Littman D.R. Virology. 1998; 248: 357-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Further mutational analysis performed by switching receptor domains suggested that the position and composition of the extracellular loops regulate chemokine binding and HIV-1 infection (18Rabut G.E. Konner J.A. Kajumo F. Moore J.P. Dragic T. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 3464-3468Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,19Atchison R.E. Gosling J. Monteclaro F.S. Franci C. Digilio L. Charo I.F.

Chem. 1997; 272: 20420-20426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). We therefore focused our studies on the recently characterized allelic variants in the first 100 amino acids of CCR5, based on the premise that natural variants might provide uniquely informative data beyond that already determined by domain swapping and alanine scanning studies.The three amino-terminal variants, I12T, C20S, and A29S, are expressed on the cell surface but do not respond to ligand, most likely due to alteration of the ligand binding site. One of the allelic variants identified by Carrington et al. (17Carrington M. Kissner T. Gerrard B. Ivanov S. O'Brien S.J. Dean M. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1997; 61: 1261-1267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) encoded a change from isoleucine to threonine suggesting that this mutation could result in increased polarity of an already strongly polar domain. The isoleucine at amino acid position 12 is common to both mouse and human CCR5 but not other CC receptors. The functional change was dramatic; the I12T mutant did not bind ligand nor did it act as an HIV-1 co-receptor. A previous study that removed the tyrosines at amino acid positions 10, 14, and 15 and replaced them with alanines showed that the polarity of this region is important for HIV-1 infection (18Rabut G.E. Konner J.A. Kajumo F. Moore J.P. Dragic T. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 3464-3468Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Taken together, these data suggest that changes in the number of polar residues in the amino terminus of CCR5 would result in markedly altered receptor function. It is possible that the C20S variant resulted in the interruption of disulfide bond formation between the first and fourth extracellular domain, which has been predicted to be essential for receptor function (37Tournamille C. Le Van Kim C. Gane P. Blanchard D. Proudfoot A.E. Cartron J.P. Colin Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16274-16280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). There is a cysteine at this position in all the characterized CC receptors (38Nibbs R.J.B. Wylie S.M. Pragnell I.B. Graham G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12495-12504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). When Rabut et al. (18Rabut G.E. Konner J.A. Kajumo F. Moore J.P. Dragic T. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 3464-3468Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) replaced Cys-20 with alanine there was a striking decrease in HIV-1 co-receptor function. However, Hill et al. (25Hill C.M. Kwon D. Jones M. Davis C.B. Marmon S. Daugherty B.L. DeMartino J.A. Springer M.S. Unutmaz D. Littman D.R. Virology. 1998; 248: 357-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) failed to observe a similar effect. In our study, the C20S mutant did not bind chemokines nor did it act as an HIV-1 co-receptor, indicating that the cysteine at amino acid position 20 is necessary for receptor function. Analysis of data from AIDS patients suggests that C20S heterozygosity may delay progression to AIDS (17Carrington M. Kissner T. Gerrard B. Ivanov S. O'Brien S.J. Dean M. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1997; 61: 1261-1267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Our data predict that the C20S allele may be protected against AIDS and, by inference from the CCR5Δ32 studies, may also reduce the severity of arthritis.The A29S variant encoded a change from alanine to serine suggesting that this mutation could result in increased amino-terminal polarity. However, previous mutational analysis showed that amino acid changes neighboring Ala-29 did not greatly affect HIV-1 co-receptor activity (18Rabut G.E. Konner J.A. Kajumo F. Moore J.P. Dragic T. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 3464-3468Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 38Nibbs R.J.B. Wylie S.M. Pragnell I.B. Graham G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12495-12504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Since A29S was infected by HIV-1Ba-L, our results were consistent with these earlier findings. However, the minimal specific binding of CCR5 ligands to this mutant receptor was unexpected. Despite being unable to induce A29S-mediated chemotaxis, MIP1β nevertheless blocked HIV-1Ba-L infection (Fig. 5). In contrast, RANTES had no effect of the HIV-1 infection of A29S. A29S has HIV-1 co-receptor activity but reduced interaction with CCR5 ligands, suggesting that HIV-1 entry might not be effectively blocked by chemokines. Therefore, A29S is likely to be HIV-1-permissive and could be associated with more rapid progression to AIDS.These observations appear contradictory until the nature of the interaction between chemokines and their receptors is considered. Pakianathan et al. (39Pakianathan D.R. Kuta E.G. Artis D.R. Skelton N.J. Hebert C.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 9642-9648Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) showed that RANTES interacts differently with each of its receptors. The epitopes on RANTES that bind individual receptors are overlapping but distinct. Although the tertiary structures of the CC chemokine are quite similar, the primary amino acid sequences are not, suggesting that the interaction between individual chemokines and specific receptors may be distinct. Data derived from mutational analysis of CC receptors suggest that the second and third extracellular domains, in addition to the first extracellular domain, may participate in ligand function and HIV-1 entry (28Samson M. LaRosa G. Libert F. Paindavoine P. Detheux M. Vassart G. Parmentier M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24934-24941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 36Alkhatib G.

Pease J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20420-20426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) showed that the third extracellular domain of CCR3 was essential for cellular fusion with monotropic HIV-1. Although both RANTES and eotaxin are established ligands for CCR3, only eotaxin efficiently blocked CCR3 co-receptor activity, whereas RANTES only partly blocked CCR3 co-receptor activity. These data show that inhibition of HIV-1 infection and receptor binding can be uncoupled. Studies of CCR2b-CCR5 chimeras demonstrate that ligand binding, HIV-1 co-receptor activity, and receptor-mediated functional responses are not necessarily located in the same domains (19Atchison R.E. Gosling J. Monteclaro F.S. Franci C. Digilio L. Charo I.F. Goldsmith M.A. Science. 1996; 274: 1924-1926Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar, 28Samson M. LaRosa G. Libert F. Paindavoine P. Detheux M. Vassart G. Parmentier M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24934-24941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). A chimeric receptor, 2255 (composed of the amino terminus of CCR2 through the second extracellular domain linked to the carboxyl-terminal half of CCR5), had no HIV-1 co-receptor activity, but MIP1β could activate inositol phosphate release by this receptor (19Atchison R.E. Gosling J. Monteclaro F.S. Franci C. Digilio L. Charo I.F. Goldsmith M.A. Science. 1996; 274: 1924-1926Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Ligand binding assays were not performed in this study (19Atchison R.E. Gosling J. Monteclaro F.S. Franci C. Digilio L. Charo I.F. Goldsmith M.A. Science. 1996; 274: 1924-1926Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). However, another group studying CCR2b and CCR5 chimeras showed that 2255 bound MIP1α, although at a 12-fold lower affinity than wild type receptor (28Samson M. LaRosa G. Libert F. Paindavoine P. Detheux M. Vassart G. Parmentier M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24934-24941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). These data indicate that the HIV-1 co-receptor activity is located in the amino-terminal half of CCR5 and that a functional ligand interaction site is located in the carboxyl-terminal half of CCR5. In addition, analysis of a 5525 chimera showed no specific MIP1α or MCP-1 binding. Unfortunately, no MIP1β binding assays were performed in this study. Neither MIP1α nor RANTES induced increased metabolic activity of the 5525 chimera. However, MIP1β and MCP-1 induced metabolic activity in the 5525 chimera-transfected cells by 10 and 40%, respectively, demonstrating that detectable specific ligand binding and functional responses are not necessarily linked to each other. These studies are strengthened by our observations, suggesting that MIP1β blocks HIV-1 by interacting with A29S at a co-receptor activity domain distinct from both specific ligand binding and functional response domains. Furthermore, RANTES does not appear to share this site. Our results are consistent with the earlier observation that HIV-1 infection occurs independently of co-receptor activation (40Alkhatib G.

Following T cell antigen receptor stimulation, SLP-76 and Vav both undergo tyrosine phosphorylation and associate with each other via the SH2 domain of Vav and phosphorylated tyrosines of SLP-76. Furthermore, SLP-76 and Vav have a synergistic effect on interleukin (IL)-2 promoter activity in T cells. In this report, we show that two tyrosines, Tyr-113 and Tyr-128, of SLP-76 are required for its binding to Vav, both in vitro and in intact cells. Surprisingly, we find also that the interaction between SLP-76 and Vav is not required for their cooperation in augmenting IL-2 promoter activity, as the two molecules appear to function in different signaling pathways upstream of IL-2 gene expression. Overexpression of SLP-76 in the Jurkat T cell line potentiates the activities of both nuclear factor of activated T cells and AP-1 transcription factors. In contrast, overexpression of Vav leads to enhanced nuclear factor of activated T cells activity without affecting AP-1. Additionally, overexpression of Vav, but not SLP-76, augments CD28-induced IL-2 promoter activity. These findings suggest that the synergy between SLP-76 and Vav in regulating IL-2 gene expression reflects the cooperation between different signaling pathways.

Together with signaling events initiated by engagement of co-receptors on the T cell, these biological second messengers lead to cytokine production, proliferation, and differentiation, or conversely programmed cell death (3Robey E.

Activation of protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs) of the Src and Syk families is the most membrane-proximal biochemical event known following TCR engagement (6Weiss A. Chan A.C. Iwashima M. Straus D. Irving B.A. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1992; 57: 107-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of cellular proteins by these kinases is essential for all subsequent TCR-initiated signaling pathways. PTK activation may result in downstream signals through direct phosphorylation and modulation of the catalytic activities of effector molecules (such as phospholipase C-γ1) or the formation of signaling complexes by the interaction of proteins newly phosphorylated on tyrosine residues with other Src homology 2 (SH2) or phosphotyrosine-binding domain-containing proteins within the cell. A widely studied example of this in T cells is the recruitment of ZAP-70 to the newly phosphorylated tyrosines of immune receptor activation motifs (ITAMs) on the TCR ζ and CD3 chains (7Chan A.C. Iwashima M. Turck C.W. Weiss A. Cell. 1992; 71: 649-662Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (876) Google Scholar,8Iwashima M. Irving B.A. van Oers N.S. Chan A.C. Weiss A. Science. 1994; 263: 1136-1139Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar).Given the central importance of PTKs in T cell activation, a number of laboratories have attempted to identify substrates of these PTKs in an effort to gain insight into how biochemical signals are integrated. Among the substrates identified are the hematopoietic cell-specific molecules SH2 domain containing leukocyte phosphoprotein of 76 kDa (SLP-76) and Vav, both of which play critical roles in the regulation of TCR signals (9Motto D.G.

SLP-76 is an adapter protein which is comprised of three motifs allowing for protein-protein interactions: an amino-terminal acidic region containing tyrosine phosphorylation sites (11Fang N.

The importance of SLP-76 in T cell signaling has been demonstrated in experiments in the Jurkat human T cell leukemia line and in mice made deficient in SLP-76 expression through homologous recombination. When SLP-76 is overexpressed in Jurkat cells, there is a dramatic augmentation of TCR-mediated activation of the full-length IL-2 promoter or a reporter construct driven by the nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) element from the IL-2 promoter (9Motto D.G.

Immunol. 1997; 159: 1639-1647PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, TCR-mediated signals are abrogated in a mutant variant of Jurkat which has lost expression of SLP-76 (18Yablonski D. Kuhne M.R. Kadlecek T. Weiss A. Science. 1998; 281: 413-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). Studies of SLP-76-deficient mice indicate also that this adapter protein is critical for signaling via the pre-TCR, as these mice exhibit arrest of thymocyte development at the pro-T3, CD3− CD4− CD8− stage (19Clements J.L.

Vav has a pleckstrin homology, a Dbl homology, an SH2, and two Src homology 3 (SH3) domains (23Bustelo X.R. Ledbetter J.A. Barbacid M.

The Dbl homology domain of Vav is responsible for its nucleotide exchange activity while the pleckstrin homology domain regulates interactions with inositol phospholipids (25Han J. Luby-Phelps K.

The SH2 and SH3 domains mediate the interaction of Vav with other signaling molecules, including SLP-76 (26Ramos-Morales F. Druker B.J. Fischer S.

Immunity. 1996; 4: 593-602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Like SLP-76, Vav is critical for effective TCR signaling. Its overexpression in Jurkat T cells also augments the transcriptional activity of the IL-2 promoter following TCR ligation (10Wu J. Katzav S. Weiss A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4337-4346Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). T cells from Vav-deficient mice do not respond effectively to TCR stimulation (30Tarakhovsky A. Turner M. Schaal S. Mee P.J. Duddy L.P. Rajewsky K. Tybulewicz V.L. Nature. 1995; 374: 467-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar, 31Zhang R. Alt F.W. Davidson L. Orkin S.H. Swat W. Nature. 1995; 374: 470-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). Interestingly, overexpression of SLP-76 and Vav together has a synergistic effect on activation of the IL-2 promoter (29Wu J. Motto D.G. Koretzky G.A. Weiss A. Immunity. 1996; 4: 593-602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). However, previous studies have not addressed whether the interaction between SLP-76 and Vav is required for their synergy and if these two proteins function in the same signaling pathways.In the experiments described in this report we investigated these questions first by identifying the tyrosines of SLP-76 responsible for the interaction with Vav both in vitro and in intact Jurkat cells. Using this information, we performed a series of co-transfection assays and determined that the intermolecular interaction between SLP-76 and Vav is not required for their functional synergy. This finding suggested the hypothesis that overexpression of SLP-76versus Vav may impact distinct signaling pathways in T cells. Experiments are presented demonstrating that these two molecules modulate distinct signaling cascades to link T cell surface receptors with IL-2 gene expression.DISCUSSIONNumerous signaling cascades function together to link antigen recognition to gene expression in T cells. Recently, a number of studies have demonstrated the importance of adaptor molecules in regulating this network (reviewed in Refs. 51Peterson E.J. Clements J.L. Fang N. Koretzky G.A. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1998; 10: 337-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 52Pawson T. Scott J.D. Science. 1997; 278: 2075-2080Crossref PubMed Scopus (1887) Google Scholar, 53Cantrell D.

Cell Signalling. 1998; 10: 377-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Having no intrinsic enzymatic activity, adaptor molecules recruit other signaling proteins to form multimeric complexes through intermolecular associations. SLP-76 is one such adaptor protein which has been shown to bind Gads (12Liu S.K. Fang N. Koretzky G.A. McGlade J.C. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 67-75Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar), Vav (28Tuosto L. Michel F. Acuto O. J. Exp.

Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7493-7498Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar), and other as yet unidentified molecules. Although these protein-protein interactions have been documented, their physiological importance remains unclear. Because SLP-76 and Vav function synergistically in their ability to augment TCR signaling leading to activation of the IL-2 gene (29Wu J. Motto D.G. Koretzky G.A. Weiss A. Immunity. 1996; 4: 593-602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar), we initiated a series of experiments to map the tyrosines of SLP-76 important for the SLP-76/Vav interaction and to ask about the functional consequences of their binding. These experiments have led to a number of surprising findings.We and others have shown previously that the association between SLP-76 and Vav is mediated by the Vav SH2 domain binding to tyrosine-phosphorylated residues within the SLP-76 amino terminus (28Tuosto L. Michel F. Acuto O. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 1161-1166Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar,29Wu J. Motto D.G. Koretzky G.A. Weiss A. Immunity. 1996; 4: 593-602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 37Raab M. da Silva A.J. Findell P.R. Rudd C.E. Immunity. 1997; 6: 155-164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). In experiments presented in this study we found that although the binding is mediated by a single Vav SH2 domain, two SLP-76 tyrosines, Tyr-113 and Tyr-128, both appear essential for this association. This is particularly surprising since both Tyr-113 and Tyr-128 are found in identical sequence motifs (DYESP), either of which would be predicted to bind the Vav SH2. Although we are not yet sure why both SLP-76 tyrosines are required for Vav binding, several models come to mind. One possibility is that tyrosine phosphorylation of SLP-76 is sequential, and that phosphorylation of either tyrosine 113 or 128 is required for induced or maintained phosphorylation of the second residue. Thus, although only one tyrosine may be involved in direct binding to Vav, the second tyrosine is required for the phosphorylation of the Vav-binding tyrosine. However, while mutation of both tyrosines 113 and 128 abolishes TCR-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of SLP-76, mutants with either Tyr-113 or Tyr-128 mutated individually are still phosphorylated following TCR or pervanadate stimulation, making this explanation unlikely. A second possibility is that one phosphorylated tyrosine is responsible for directing the interaction with the Vav SH2 domain, while the second tyrosine is required for stabilizing this interaction, perhaps through maintaining a structural microenvironment or via an interaction with a third molecule. In this regard, SLP-76 was recently shown to simultaneously bind to the SH2 domains of Vav and the adapter protein, Nck, to form a trimolecular complex (55Bubeck Wardenburg J. Pappu R. Bu J.Y. Mayer B. Chernoff J. Straus D. Chan A.C. Immunity. 1998; 9: 607-616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that the SLP-76/Nck interaction is important for stabilizing the association between SLP-76 and Vav. Crystal or solution nuclear magnetic resonance determination of the structures of SLP-76, Vav, and Nck, when bound together, will be necessary to test this hypothesis.On the surface, a second finding from our studies, that the synergy between SLP-76 and Vav does not appear to require their association, seems surprising. One potential explanation could be that the SLP-76 tyrosine mutants dimerize with endogenous, wild-type SLP-76 and thus interact with Vav indirectly. However, multiple experimental approaches in our laboratory have failed to demonstrate evidence for a SLP-76/SLP-76 interaction, 2E. J. Peterson and G. A. Koretzky, unpublished data. making this explanation unlikely. Moreover, our result is consistent with several other observations. First, when SLP-76 mutants Y113F and Y128F are overexpressed at high levels, they augment IL-2-NFAT promoter activity to a level similar to that of wild-type SLP-76 (11Fang N. Motto D.G. Ross S.E. Koretzky G.A. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 3769-3773PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that in this assay, SLP-76 can function independently of its ability to bind Vav. Second, SLP-76 and Vav synergize in augmenting basal IL-2-NFAT promoter activity in Jurkat cells, although under these conditions, SLP-76 is not phosphorylated and does not bind Vav (29Wu J. Motto D.G. Koretzky G.A. Weiss A. Immunity. 1996; 4: 593-602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Third, it was reported that in the T cell hybridoma DC27.10, where there is no detectable association between SLP-76 and Vav (even following TCR stimulation), TCR ligation still induces IL-2 production (37Raab M. da Silva A.J. Findell P.R. Rudd C.E. Immunity. 1997; 6: 155-164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Finally, we have found recently that mice made deficient in SLP-76 expression by homologous recombination have a much more profound defect in T cell development than do mice which lack expression of Vav, suggesting that SLP-76 and Vav do not function entirely in the same pathway (19Clements J.L.

Bouchard D. Barbacid M. Bernstein A. Penninger J.M. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 554-562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Collectively, these observations, together with the experiments presented in our current study, suggest that the Vav/SLP-76 interaction is not essential for their functional synergy, at least for inducing IL-2 gene transcription. This conclusion led us to ask if SLP-76 and Vav may work together by modulating different signaling pathways in T cells.There are several examples of how different pathways may enhance signals leading to IL-2 gene expression in T cells. One involves the cooperation between signals initiated from the TCR and those stimulated by engagement of CD28 (47Fraser J.D. Irving B.A. Crabtree G.R. Weiss A. Science. 1991; 251: 313-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar). Another is the interdependence of signals leading to translocation of NFAT from the cytoplasm to the nucleus with other signals leading to AP-1 activation resulting in stimulating promoter elements within many cytokine genes (38Rao A. Luo C. Hogan P.G. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 707-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (2203) Google Scholar). Our studies suggest that the synergy between SLP-76 and Vav may reflect the cooperation of different, but overlapping signals initiated from the TCR and CD28 as Vav, but not SLP-76 impacts on the ability of CD28 to augment IL-2 gene promoter activity. This finding is consistent with the observation that while Vav is one of the major substrates for CD28-induced PTKs (57Klasen S. Pages F. Peyron J.F. Cantrell D.A. Olive D. Int. Immunol. 1998; 10: 481-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), we find that SLP-76 is phosphorylated to only a very limited extent, if at all following CD28 ligation (data not shown). Our data suggest also that SLP-76 and Vav function in different TCR-stimulated pathways as SLP-76, but not Vav couples the TCR with AP-1. This is consistent with the recent observation that activation of ERK following TCR ligation is diminished markedly in SLP-76-deficient Jurkat cells (18Yablonski D. Kuhne M.R. Kadlecek T. Weiss A. Science. 1998; 281: 413-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar) while stimulation of this second messenger is retained in Vav-deficient T cells (56Fischer K.D. Kong Y.Y. Nishina H. Tedford K. Marengere L.E. Kozieradzki I. Sasaki T. Starr M. Chan G. Gardener S. Nghiem M.P. Bouchard D. Barbacid M. Bernstein A. Penninger J.M. Curr.

Biol. 1998; 8: 563-572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Further insight into the potential mechanisms by which SLP-76 exerts its effects on TCR-mediated signaling have come from studies of the SLP-76 defective Jurkat mutant. In this cell line, TCR engagement results in activation of PTKs, but fails to couple effectively with the phosphatidylinositol as well as Ras signaling pathways (18Yablonski D. Kuhne M.R. Kadlecek T. Weiss A. Science. 1998; 281: 413-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). Thus, it appears that SLP-76, via its adaptor function, is critical for allowing TCR-stimulated PTK activation to result in optimal phosphorylation of phospholipase C γ1 in addition to signals leading to ERK activation. It remains to be determined, however, exactly which protein-protein interactions mediated by SLP-76 are critical for these more downstream signals to occur.Although the experiments in this study indicate that for TCR-stimulated IL-2 gene regulation, the interaction between SLP-76 and Vav does not appear to play a critical role, it is possible, and perhaps likely, that other T cell activation events are influenced by SLP-76 and Vav and require their interaction. For example, it has been reported that the interaction between SLP-76 and Vav may be required for TCR-induced PAK activation as well as the capping process (55Bubeck Wardenburg J. Pappu R. Bu J.Y. Mayer B. Chernoff J. Straus D. Chan A.C. Immunity. 1998; 9: 607-616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since several studies have shown that Vav plays a critical role in formation of the cap following TCR stimulation (56Fischer K.D. Kong Y.Y. Nishina H. Tedford K. Marengere L.E. Kozieradzki I.

We are currently working to reconstitute our SLP-76-deficient mice with wild-type and mutant variants of SLP-76 to begin to address this and other related questions.

Together with signaling events initiated by engagement of co-receptors on the T cell, these biological second messengers lead to cytokine production, proliferation, and differentiation, or conversely programmed cell death (3Robey E.

Activation of protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs) of the Src and Syk families is the most membrane-proximal biochemical event known following TCR engagement (6Weiss A. Chan A.C. Iwashima M. Straus D. Irving B.A. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1992; 57: 107-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of cellular proteins by these kinases is essential for all subsequent TCR-initiated signaling pathways. PTK activation may result in downstream signals through direct phosphorylation and modulation of the catalytic activities of effector molecules (such as phospholipase C-γ1) or the formation of signaling complexes by the interaction of proteins newly phosphorylated on tyrosine residues with other Src homology 2 (SH2) or phosphotyrosine-binding domain-containing proteins within the cell. A widely studied example of this in T cells is the recruitment of ZAP-70 to the newly phosphorylated tyrosines of immune receptor activation motifs (ITAMs) on the TCR ζ and CD3 chains (7Chan A.C. Iwashima M. Turck C.W. Weiss A. Cell. 1992; 71: 649-662Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (876) Google Scholar,8Iwashima M. Irving B.A. van Oers N.S. Chan A.C. Weiss A. Science. 1994; 263: 1136-1139Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). Given the central importance of PTKs in T cell activation, a number of laboratories have attempted to identify substrates of these PTKs in an effort to gain insight into how biochemical signals are integrated. Among the substrates identified are the hematopoietic cell-specific molecules SH2 domain containing leukocyte phosphoprotein of 76 kDa (SLP-76) and Vav, both of which play critical roles in the regulation of TCR signals (9Motto D.G.

Biol. 1995; 15: 4337-4346Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). SLP-76 is an adapter protein which is comprised of three motifs allowing for protein-protein interactions: an amino-terminal acidic region containing tyrosine phosphorylation sites (11Fang N.

Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaM kinase II)-mediated phosphorylation of threonine 1172 in the cytoplasmic tail of HER2/c-erbB2 can modulate tyrosine kinase activity and consensus phosphorylation sites are also found at serines 1046/1047 in the structurally related epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). We show that serines 1046/1047 are sites for CaM kinase II phosphorylation, although there is a preference for serine 1047, which resides within the consensus -R-X-X-S-. In addition, we have identified major phosphorylation sites at serine 1142 and serine 1057, which lie within a novel -S-X-D- consensus. Mutation of serines 1046/1047 in full-length EGFR enhanced both fibroblast transformation and tyrosine autokinase activity that was significantly potentiated by additional mutation of serines 1057 and 1142. A single CaM kinase II site was also identified at serine 744 within sub-kinase domain III, and autokinase activity was significantly affected by mutation of this serine to an aspartic acid making this site appear constitutively phosphorylated. We have addressed the mechanism by which CaM kinase II phosphorylation of the EGFR might regulate receptor autokinase activity and show that this modification can hinder association of the cytoplasmic tail with the kinase domain to prevent an enzyme-substrate interaction. We postulate that the location and greater number of CaM kinase II phosphorylation sites in the EGFR compared with HER-2/c-erbB2, leading to differential regulation of autokinase activity, contributes to differences in the strength of downstream signaling events and may explain the higher relative transforming potential of HER-2/cerbB2.

Stern D.F. Bioessays. 1998; 20: 41-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar). EGFR signaling is initiated by ligand binding, receptor dimerization, and autophosphorylation to create phosphotyrosine residues that provide coded SH2 domain docking sites for receptor-specific substrate recruitment (2Schlessinger J. Ullrich A. Neuron. 1992; 9: 383-391Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1291) Google Scholar). Assembly of SH2 containing intracellular effector molecules ensues at the receptor with subsequent activation of several downstream signaling pathways. Some SH2 domain proteins serve as adaptor molecules and couple receptors to phosphorylation dependent signaling cascades such as the Ras/MAP kinase pathway (3Hill C.S. Treisman R. Cell. 1996; 80: 199-211Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (1195) Google Scholar) and phosphoinositide 3-kinase activation (4Panayatou G.

Other SH2 domain substrates, such as phospholipase C-γ, have intrinsic enzymatic activity that can be stimulated by tyrosine phosphorylation.

Understanding the intrinsic feedback regulatory mechanisms of cell surface receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) such as the EGFR family, which trigger many of these downstream signaling networks, is of particular interest as they are implicated in the progression of a variety of aggressive carcinomas (8Hynes N.E. Stern D.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1198: 165-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (999) Google Scholar, 9Salomon D.S. Brandt R. Ciardiello F. Normanno N. Crit. Rev. Oncol. Hematol. 1995; 19: 183-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (2429) Google Scholar). Ligand-induced desensitization mechanisms are important aspects of the regulation of transmembrane receptors, and the EGFR has provided an ideal model system for delineating these events. Activated receptors are slowly internalized via clathrin-coated pits and are ultimately delivered to lysosomes for degradation (10Sorkin A. Carpenter G. Science. 1993; 261: 612-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 11Kornilova E. Sorkina T. Beguinot L. Sorkin A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30340-30346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). This process of ligand-induced down-regulation occurs over several hours; however, in the short term phosphorylation of the receptor on serine and threonine residues is thought to be one of the primary mechanisms for attenuation of its kinase activity. Activation of protein kinase C (PKC)-dependent signaling pathways by phorbol ester leads to a loss in high affinity EGF binding as well as an inhibition in RTK activity (12Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 9462-9469Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Countaway J.L. McQuilkin P. Girones N. Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3407-3416Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The latter is linked to site-specific phosphorylation of threonine 654 in the juxtamembrane region; however, PKC-mediated modulation of ligand binding is independent of any major serine/threonine phosphorylation sites in the receptor (13Countaway J.L. McQuilkin P. Girones N. Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3407-3416Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It has been suggested that PKC-mediated phosphorylation at threonine 654 may contribute only partially to EGFR desensitization due to low stoichiometry of phosphorylation in some cells (14Friedman B. Van Amsterdam J. Fujiki H. Rosner M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 812-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation at threonine 669 by MAP kinase may also regulate the EGFR kinase (15Takishima K. Griswold-Prenner I. Ingebristen T. Rosner M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 88: 2520-2524Crossref Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 16Northwood I.C. Gonzales F.A. Wartman M. Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15266-15276Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); however, substitution with negatively charged glutamic acid residues to mimic constitutive phosphorylation of both threonine 654 and threonine 669 partially modulated, but failed to block, EGFR signaling (17Morrison P. Takishima K. Rosner M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15536-15543Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, agents that increase cytosolic calcium, such as thapsigargin and ionophore A23187, significantly inhibit EGFR tyrosine kinase activity, and it has been suggested that this effect might be partially due to Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaM kinase II)-mediated phosphorylation at serines 1046/1047 (18Countaway J.L. Nairn A.C. Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1129-1140Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,19Theroux S.J. Taglienti-Sian C. Nair N. Countaway J.L. Robinson H.L. Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7967-7970Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have previously mapped a novel CaM kinase II phosphorylation site to threonine 1172 in erbB2/HER2 and shown that this site can contribute to the regulation of the RTK activity (20Feinmesser R.L. Gray K. Means A.R. Chantry A. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 2725-2730PubMed Google Scholar). Here, we have extended the same experimental approach to the EGFR and have identified new CaM kinase II sites in the cytoplasmic tail, which lie within a consensus -S-X-D- phosphorylation sequence. Parallel analyses of site-specific mutant receptors have revealed pronounced differences in the potential to transform mouse NIH3T3 fibroblasts and to up-regulate tyrosine autokinase activity. We identify serine 1142 (-S-l-D-) as a preferred site compared with serines 1046/1047, and phosphorylation of these sites together with serine 1057 (-S-I-D-) and serine 744 (-S-V-D-) in the kinase domain provides a clearer explanation of the regulation of EGFR signaling by CaM kinase II. Furthermore, we present evidence that the mechanism for controlling receptor tyrosine autophosphorylation may involve inhibition of cytoplasmic tail interactions with the EGFR kinase domain, thereby preventing an enzyme-substrate interaction. Site-directed mutagenesis of the human EGFR cDNA cloned into the pCMV-1 expression plasmid was performed as described previously (21Chantry A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3068-3073Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mutations were confirmed by dideoxy sequencing and restriction enzyme analysis. Other mutants used in this study have been described previously; HER-1/2-T1172A (20Feinmesser R.L. Gray K. Means A.R. Chantry A. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 2725-2730PubMed Google Scholar) and HERΔCT (21Chantry A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3068-3073Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Amino acid residues tyrosine 974 to alanine 1186 of the human EGF receptor (HERWT, 212 amino acids; HERΔ15, 197 amino acids), serine 1013 to proline 1084 of the chicken EGF receptor (CER, 72 amino acids), and serine 1013 to proline 1084 (v-erbB.ES4, 50 amino acids) were amplified from appropriate cDNAs by polymerase chain reactions (numbering of receptor residues is based on equivalent residues in the human EGFR as in Ref. 22Ullrich A.

Nature. 1984; 309: 418-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (1987) Google Scholar). Smaller EGFR GST fusion proteins were prepared in the same way to generate the following sequences; GST-1, threonine 1022 to tyrosine 1045; GST-2, phenylalanine 1041 to aspartic acid 1056; GST-3, aspartic acid 1048 to proline 1095; GST-4, phenylalanine 1062 to histidine 1105; GST-5, proline 1130 to glycine 1165; GST-III, alanine 731 to leucine 758. Amplified fragments were subcloned into the bacterial expression vector pGEX-2T (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and GST fusion proteins isolated as described previously (20Feinmesser R.L. Gray K. Means A.R. Chantry A. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 2725-2730PubMed Google Scholar). Rat CaM kinase II-α overexpressed in HEK-293 cells was purified by calmodulin-Sepharose affinity chromatography and used for in vitro phosphorylation of purified GST proteins as described (20Feinmesser R.L. Gray K. Means A.R. Chantry A. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 2725-2730PubMed Google Scholar). EGFR mutants were subcloned into the retroviral pLEN vector (23Adams M.A. Ramesh N. Miller A.D. Osborne W.R.A. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 4985-4990Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Constructs were transfected into the helper virus-free packaging cell line HEK-293-eco (ATCC) by calcium phosphate precipitation (24Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4815) Google Scholar). After 2 days, ecotropic virus-containing supernatants were collected, and viral titers were normally in the range of 1–5 × 105 colony-forming units. For focus formation assays passage 10 NIH3T3 fibroblasts (4 × 104 cells) were seeded into 6-cm dishes 18 h prior to infection (8 h) with EGFR mutant retroviruses (m.o.i. of 0.01–0.001) followed by infection (8 h) with ψ2TGFα virus (m.o.i. of 0.02), which was kindly provided by David Lee. Cells were seeded into a 6-cm plate and grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 4% fetal calf serum. Media were changed every 2 days, and after 12–14 days foci were stained with 0.5% crystal violet. HEK-293 fibroblasts (1 × 106 cells/10-cm dish) were transfected with receptor constructs subcloned into pCMV1 (30 μg of DNA) together with 10 μg of pCMV1 or pCMV1-CaM kinaseII1–290 as described previously (21Chantry A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3068-3073Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Two days after transfection, cells were stimulated with 100 ng/ml EGF for 10 min, lysed in 1 ml “lysis buffer” (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, containing 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and immunoprecipitated with monoclonal antibody 108 (20Feinmesser R.L. Gray K. Means A.R. Chantry A. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 2725-2730PubMed Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitates were washed five times and resuspended in 100 μl of “wash buffer” (50 mM HEPES, pH7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Triton X-100) containing 5 mm MnCl2, 2 mm CaCl2, 100 μm ATP, and 50 units of calmodulin. Samples that had previously been transfected with CaM kinase II1–290 were phosphorylated with 0.1 μg of purified CaM kinase II at 4 °C (30 min) to ensure complete and efficient phosphorylation of receptors. Immune complexes were washed three times in wash buffer and resuspended in 100 μl of wash buffer containing 5 mmMnCl2 and 5 mm MgCl2. Phosphorylation was initiated by addition of 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP and after 5 min at room temperature terminated by addition of EGTA to a final concentration of 10 mm. Immunoprecipitates were washed once with wash buffer containing 10 mm EGTA and resuspended in 100 μl of SDS-sample buffer. Samples were separated by SDS-7.5% PAGE, and gels were dried and exposed to x-ray film. Radioactive spots corresponding with the migration of the full-length receptor were excised and quantitated by scintillation counting. To examine receptor autophosphorylation by Western blotting, cells were transfected as above, and immunoprecipitated receptors were separated by 7.5% SDS-PAGE and transferred onto nitrocellulose. Filters were incubated with anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody (4G10; Upstate Biotechnology) or anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody (Sigma; catalog number E3138), and immunoreactive proteins were visualized using the ECL system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Four plates of HEK-293 cells (1 × 106 cells/10-cm dish) were each transfected with 100 μg of pCMV1-HERΔCT. Lysates were incubated by rotation with 50-μl packed volume of wheat germ agglutinin-Sepharose beads (1 h; 4 °C). GST-HER-WT (amino acids 974–1186) was either left unphosphorylated or phosphorylated (1 h; 4 °C) with 0.2 μg of CaM kinase II in the presence of 100 μm ATP under the same conditions described above for GST fusion protein phosphorylation. After washing wheat germ agglutinin-Sepharose-bound protein six times with wash buffer, pre- or nonphosphorylated GST-HER-WT reactions were added to beads and incubated by rotation (1 h; 4 °C) followed by a further six washes with wash buffer. Beads were resuspended in SDS-sample buffer and bound protein-separated SDS-10% PAGE followed by staining with Coomassie Blue or immunoblotting against an anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody (Sigma; catalog number E3138). Immunoreactive proteins were visualized using the ECL system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). To test whether the EGFR cytoplasmic tail is a substrate for CaM kinase II, we constructed a pGEX plasmid in which the DNA coding sequence representing amino acids 974–1186 (HER-WT) was fused to the DNA encoding GST. Purified HER-WT was efficiently phosphorylated by CaM kinase II in vitro in contrast to purified GST alone (Fig.1 a). HER-WT contains a region corresponding with a synthetic peptide (RRFLQRYSSDPTGAL; EGFR1041–1053), which has been shown previously to be a substrate for CaM kinase II and has an optimal consensus -R-X-X-S/T- phosphorylation sequence at serine 1047 (18Countaway J.L. Nairn A.C. Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1129-1140Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Serines 1046/1047 within this region are also major in vivo sites of phosphorylation in the EGFR (25Heisermann G.J. Gill G.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 13152-13158Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore prepared a GST fusion protein that has a deletion corresponding with residues 1039–1053 (HER-delta15), and in vitro phosphorylation of this protein with CaM kinase II was only partially reduced relative to HER-WT, indicating that there are additional major sites of phosphorylation in the EGFR cytoplasmic tail (Fig. 1 a). Shorter fusion proteins were also examined using the same approach; however, in this instance peptide sequences were generated from the highly homologous CER and also the structurally related v-erbBES4 oncogene. The v-erbBES4 oncoprotein is derived from the CER, and as well as having a large deletion of the ligand binding domain, also has several cytoplasmic domain mutations, including a deletion of residues equivalent to 1040–1060 in the human EGFR (26Massoglia S. Gray A. Dull T.J. Munemitsu S. Kung H.-J. Schlessinger J. Ullrich A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 10: 3048-3055Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The short 72-amino acid CER protein comprises residues serine 1016 to glutamine 1087, and this can also be efficiently phosphorylatedin vitro by CaM kinase II in contrast to the short 50-amino acid ES4 fusion protein that underwent only background phosphorylation (Fig. 1 a). These data taken together therefore suggest that the cytoplasmic tail of the EGFR is an excellent substrate for CaM kinase II in a region that includes serines 1046/1047 as well as at other unidentified sites. Phosphoamino acid analysis of HER-WT after CaM kinase II phosphorylation also indicated that these sites were only at serine residues (Fig. 1 b). Serine 1047 resides within the traditional -R-X-X-S/T- for CaM kinase II phosphorylation; however, scanning of residues 974–1186 in the EGFR reveals no other consensus sites. Several other physiological substrates for CaM kinase II have been described that do not have recognizable consensus sites (27Hanson P.I. Schulman H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 559-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar). For example, the intermediate filament protein vimentin has a phosphorylation site in which the critical determinant of site specificity is an acidic residue in the second position on the C-terminal side of the phosphorylation site (28Ando S. Tokui T. Yamauchi T. Sugiura H. Tanabe K. Inagaki M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 175: 955-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Analysis of vimentin and other peptide substrates have suggested that the sequence -S-X-D- may serve as a novel recognition site for phosphorylation by CaM kinase II with the possibility of additional preference for a hydrophobic residue at position X (27Hanson P.I. Schulman H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 559-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar, 28Ando S. Tokui T. Yamauchi T. Sugiura H. Tanabe K. Inagaki M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 175: 955-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Support for this observation comes from the identification of a CaM kinase II site at serine 142 of the cAMP response element-binding protein, which negatively regulates transcriptional activity and fits this alternative consensus (29Sun P. Enslen H. Myung P.S. Maurer R.A. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2527-2539Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar). As a starting point to mapping the other sites in HER-WT, we examined residues 974–1186 for -S-X-D- sequences. Prospective sites were found at serine 1057 (-S-I-D-), serine 1096 (-S-R-D-), and serine 1142 (-S-l-D-). Previously reported sites at serine 1046 and serine 1047 lie within -S-X-D- and -R-X-X-S- consensus sites, respectively. In addition, serine 1040 (-K-E-D-S-) resides within the -R-X-X-S- consensus but has a basic lysine instead of arginine at the third position C-terminal to the serine, and it has been reported that a limited number of substrates have this site preference for CaM kinase II (27Hanson P.I. Schulman H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 559-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar). In an effort to identify any of the potentially new sites in the EGFR as targets for CaM kinase II, EGFR-GST fusion proteins were prepared that spanned these serines, which were also individually mutated to alanine (Fig.2 a). In vitrophosphorylation identified the major site of CaM kinase phosphorylation at serine 1142 and confirmed that serines 1046/1047 can also be phosphorylated, albeit to a much lesser extent, with a clear preference for serine 1047 (Fig. 2 b). Serine 1057 also underwent a significant degree of phosphorylation comparable with serine 1047; however, serine 1096 and serine 1040 were very poorly phosphorylated (Fig. 2 b). Quantitation of in vitrophosphorylation reactions indicated that serine 1142 incorporated about 5-fold more phosphate than serines 1046/1047 and about 10-fold more than serine 1057 (data not shown). The consensus sequence and location of individual phosphorylation sites in the cytoplasmic tail of the EGFR are depicted in Fig. 2 c. Previously we have mapped a single CaM kinase II site in HER2/c-erbB2 and by two-dimensional mapping showed that this site could be hyperphosphorylated in [32P]orthophosphate-loaded cells in vivo (20Feinmesser R.L. Gray K. Means A.R. Chantry A. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 2725-2730PubMed Google Scholar). Peptide maps generated in the same way by expression of full-length EGFR or specific site mutants were complicated and have proven difficult to interpret due to overlapping migration of a number of phosphopeptide spots. We have used several proteases to generate peptides, including trypsin, chymotrypsin, and V8 protease, and due to the absence of sufficient proteolytic cleavage sites and close proximity of some of the CaM kinase II phosphorylation sites, we have been unable to distinguish in vivo sites on this basis. However, there are several phosphopeptide spots that show significantly enhanced 32P phospholabeling in the presence of constitutively active CaM kinase II1–290 (data not shown). We have therefore assessed the in vivo biological consequence of serine phosphorylation site-specific mutation by comparing the ability of EGFR mutants to induce transformed foci in 3T3 fibroblasts. In this regard, mutation of serines 1046/1047 to alanine in the EGFR increases both signaling strength and oncogenic potential (19Theroux S.J. Taglienti-Sian C. Nair N. Countaway J.L. Robinson H.L. Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7967-7970Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have used retroviral co-infection of early passage fibroblasts with the EGFR and transforming growth factor-α to induce autocrine activation and the appearance of transformed foci. The number and size of foci with the wild-type EGFR could be approximately doubled by mutation of serines 1046/1047, and additional mutation of the major phosphorylation sites at serines 1057/1142 led to a dramatic enhancement of the transformed phenotype (Fig.3). The functional significance and preference of serine 1142 in the EGFR cytoplasmic tail as a site for CaM kinase II led us to examine the whole of the EGFR intracellular tail for other -S-X-D- consensus sequences. One additional site was found at serine 744, which, based on sequence alignment of known kinases, is located within sub-domain III or helix C of the tyrosine kinase domain (30Hanks S.K. Quinn A.M. Hunter T. Science. 1988; 241: 42-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (3797) Google Scholar). This site is conserved between the type I RTKs, except HER3, and there is almost complete identity in the whole of sub-domain III between EGFR and HER2/c-erbB2 apart from substitution of the EGFR equivalent of serine 744 for glycine in HER2/c-erbB2 (Fig.4 a). A GST fusion protein comprising sub-domain III of the EGFR can be phosphorylated by CaM kinase II, and this can be prevented by mutation of serine 744 to alanine (Fig. 4 b). In addition, when the serine 744 → alanine mutation is incorporated into the full-length receptor, there is approximately a 2-fold increase in receptor autophosphorylation assessed by overexpression in HEK-293 cells and anti-phosphotyrosine blotting (Fig. 4 c). We then attempted to mimic hyperphosphorylation of serine 744 by mutation to a negatively charged aspartic acid and found that receptor tyrosine autophosphorylation is significantly impaired (Fig. 4 c). This loss of activity is unlikely to be due to an effect on overall domain structural integrity, since mutation of the same site to alanine up-regulates kinase activity. We examined whether phosphorylation of the EGFR by CaM kinase II could inhibit receptor tyrosine kinase activity by immune complex kinase assay. The kinase activity of the wild-type EGFR is reduced to about 40% by co-expression in HEK-293 cells with a constitutively active form of CaM kinase II lacking a C-terminal auto-inhibitory domain (Fig. 5). Mutation of serines 1046/1047 increased kinase activity by about 1.5-fold, which was enhanced slightly by additional mutation of serine 1057, and significantly increased by approximately 3.5-fold compared with wild-type EGFR when serine 1142 was also mutated (Fig. 5). Mutation of serine 744 to aspartic acid, making this site appear constitutively phosphorylated, severely affected kinase activity, and mutation to alanine caused a 2-fold increase relative to wild-type EGFR; however, kinase activity was not significantly inhibited by co-expression with constitutively active CaM kinase II in contrast with wild-type, S1046A/S1047A, S1046A/S1047A/S1057A, and S1046A/S1047A/S1142A (Fig. 5). The tyrosine autokinase activity of HER2/c-erbB2, in the form of a chimeric receptor comprising the extracellular domain of EGFR, was increased about 1.3-fold by mutation of threonine 1172 to alanine, and this activity could not be significantly inhibited by CaM kinase II1–290 (Fig. 5; see also Ref. 20Feinmesser R.L. Gray K. Means A.R. Chantry A. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 2725-2730PubMed Google Scholar). Since the EGFR cytoplasmic tail is a substrate for its own tyrosine kinase, we attempted to develop an experimental system for assessing whether this enzyme substrate interaction could be detected. We overexpressed in HEK-293 cells a mutant EGFR that lacks the C-terminal residues 974–1186 (HERΔCT), semipurified this receptor using wheat germ agglutinin-Sepharose, and incubated this complex with purified GST fusion protein HER-WT comprising residues 974–1186 (Fig. 6). The resulting complex was washed extensively and bound proteins separated by SDS-PAGE. The major Coomassie Blue-detectable protein migrates at approximately 130 kDa, corresponding with the size of HERΔCT, and immunoblotting of these samples against an antibody specific for the EGFR cytoplasmic tail (HERCT) indicates that the GST HER-WT can form a stable complex with HERΔCT (Fig. 6 b). It is also apparent that this interaction is significantly inhibited following prephosphorylation of GST HER-WT with CaM kinase II (Fig. 6 b), and this effect was prevented by mutation of major phosphorylation sites at serines 1046, 1047, 1057, and 1142 to alanine (data not shown). In this study, we provide evidence that CaM kinase II contributes significantly to the control of EGFR signaling and attenuation of tyrosine autokinase activity. Two serine residues at positions 1046 and 1047 have been implicated previously in EGF-induced receptor desensitization (18Countaway J.L. Nairn A.C. Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1129-1140Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We now confirm that these are phosphorylated by CaM kinase II with a marked preference for serine 1047 and find additional sites at serines 1142 and 1057 that reside within an alternative -S-X-D- consensus phosphorylation sequence. Serine 1142 is a preferred site of phosphorylation and combined site-directed mutagenesis of this, together with other CaM kinase II sites in the EGFR cytoplasmic tail, leads to overt transformation of NIH3T3 fibroblasts and increases receptor tyrosine autokinase activity about 3-fold. The tyrosine-specific phosphorylation function of RTKs is indispensible for the engagement of intracellular effector systems that govern cellular responses such as proliferation, differentiation, and migration. While receptor-specific substrate recruitment provides some definition in the transmission of distinct signals, differences in amplitude and duration of receptor tyrosine kinase activity can make important contributions to the nature of the biological response (31Marshall C.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 179-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4225) Google Scholar). For instance, transient MAP kinase activation downstream of the EGFR mediates a proliferative response in PC12 cells, while sustained activity from an activated EGFR mutant results in differentiation (32Traverse S. Seedorf K. Paterson H. Marshall C.J. Cohen P. Ullrich A. Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 694-701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). It is feasible that cell surface receptors that fail to down-regulate efficiently can lead to the relatively prolonged activation of MAP kinase and other common downstream signaling molecules and that this may be an important determinant of transforming potential. Therefore, the greater oncogenic capacity of RTKs such as the type I family member HER2/c-erbB2, which shares considerable sequence homology with the EGFR, may be a reflection of impaired mechanisms of down-regulation and kinase desensitization. Within HER2/c-erbB2 the position equivalent to the EGFR site for CaM kinase phosphorylation at serine 1047 is substituted for a glutamic acid (residue 1114 in HER2/c-erbB2). We have reported previously that HER2/c-erbB2 contains only a single CaM kinase II site at threonine 1172 within an R-X-X-S/T consensus (20Feinmesser R.L. Gray K. Means A.R. Chantry A. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 2725-2730PubMed Google Scholar). Our findings in this present study indicate that, in marked contrast to the EGFR, tyrosine autokinase activity of HER2/c-erbB2 is not affected in cells which overexpress CaM kinase II1–290, even though mutation of threonine 1172 to alanine up-regulated tyrosine autokinase activity about 1.5-fold. Taken together, these observations suggest that an important aspect of the differential signaling properties between the EGFR and HER2/c-erbB2 might relate to the number of CaM kinase II phosphorylation sites and also the absence in HER2/c-erbB2 of a major regulatory site equivalent to serine 1142 found in the EGFR. The sustained signal emanating from receptors with fewer CaM kinase II regulatory sites may in turn partly explain the observation that HER2/c-erbB2 is 100-fold more oncogenic than the EGFR in cellular transformation assays (33Di Fiore P.P. Pierce J.H. Fleming T.P. Hazan R. Ullrich A. King C.R. Schlessinger J. Aaronson S. Cell. 1987; 51: 1063-1070Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar). The carboxyl tail of the EGF receptor is thought to have a regulatory function; however, it is not yet clear whether it determines a positive or negative response. The main sites of autophosphorylation (tyrosines 992, 1068, 1086, 1148, and 1173) are found in the carboxy tail and provide interaction sites for many of the known SH2 domain-containing substrates. Many studies relating to the signal transducing properties of the carboxy tail have employed consecutive C-terminal deletions that, in most cases, remove many of the substrate binding sites. The biological effects of C-terminal deletions have yielded conflicting results. Removal of 202 C-terminal residues enhanced fibroblast transformation (34Khazaie K. Dull T.J. Graf T. Schlessinger J. Ullrich A. Beug H. Vennström B. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 3061-3071Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar); however, truncation of the C-terminal tail at residue 973 does not result in a constitutively active kinase (35Walton G.M. Chen W.S. Rosenfeld M.G. Gill G.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1750-1754Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36.Deleted in proof.Google Scholar). Naturally occurring C-terminal truncations and mutations in the EGF receptor have been found in a number of oncogenic products of avian erythroblastosis viruses (37Downward J. Yarden Y. Mayes E. Scrace G. Totty N. Stockwell P. Ullrich A. Schlessinger J. Waterfield M.D. Nature. 1984; 307: 521-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (1718) Google Scholar). Sequence alterations responsible for their increased oncogenic capacity include deletions in the carboxy tail and point mutations in the kinase domain (26Massoglia S. Gray A. Dull T.J. Munemitsu S. Kung H.-J. Schlessinger J. Ullrich A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 10: 3048-3055Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar). An internal deletion of 21 amino acids in v-erbB, corresponding to residues 1040–1060 in the human EGF receptor, were found to be essential for transformation (38Shu H.K.G. Pelley R.J. Kung H.J. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 6173-6180Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 39Lee E.B. Beug H. Hayman M.J. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 1317-1327PubMed Google Scholar). This region includes the negative regulatory CaM kinase II phosphorylation sites at serines 1046/1047 and serine 1057. These observations support an important role for CaM kinase II site-specific phosphorylation in regulating normal EGFR function. Deletion of these three regulatory sites in v-erbB could contribute to defects in desensitization followed by an accumulation of an active tyrosine kinase within the cell that is manifest as a transformed phenotype. Activation and regulation of the EGFR kinase is clearly complex and involves covalent modification as well as a number of critcal protein-protein interactions. Binding of EGF leads to receptor dimerization and simultaneous activation of the tyrosine kinase domain (40Yarden Y. Schlessinger J. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 1434-1442Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). Interactions within the kinase domains then contribute to the stabilization of an active dimeric conformation (21Chantry A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3068-3073Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The recent crystal structure of the fibroblast growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase domain has been determined, and a comparatively large buried dimeric interface was found between two conserved regions comprising helix C of the kinase domain (41Mohammadi M. Schlessinger J. Hubbard S.R. Cell. 1996; 86: 577-587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of the EGFR kinase domain is not known; however, a recent model predicts a dimeric contact between helices C that is responsible for maintaining an active conformation in both a symmetric and asymmetric dimer (42Groenen L.C. Walker F. Burgess A.W. Treutlein H.R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 3826-3836Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Interestingly, we find an additional CaM kinase II phosphorylation site at serine 744 (-S-V-D- consensus), which is located at the C-terminal end of helix C in the kinase domain (Fig. 4). This represents a region of the kinase domain that is well conserved in the type I RTK family with the exception of HER-3, which displays no kinase activity. Substitution of Serine 744 to a negatively charged aspartic acid residue to mimic phosphorylation at this site abolishes activity of the kinase, and conversely, mutation to alanine up-regulates kinase about 2-fold (Figs. 4 and 5). It is also notable that both HER2/c-erbB2 and the EGFR have identical sequences in helix C, with the exception of a substitution to glycine in HER2/c-erbB2 of the position equivalent to serine 744 in the EGFR (Fig. 4 a). The absence of this site in HER2/c-erbB2 may therefore also contribute to it being refractory to regulation by CaM kinase II (Fig. 5). There are several plausible explanations for the mechanism by which serine/threonine phosphorylation mediates inhibition of RTK activity. Receptors are known to be activated by dimerization (21Chantry A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3068-3073Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 43Schlessinger J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1988; 13: 443-447Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar); however, no marked effect of PKC or CaM kinase II on EGF receptor aggregation was observed in experiments using covalent cross-linking analysis (18Countaway J.L. Nairn A.C. Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1129-1140Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,44Northwood I.C. Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 5746-5750Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Alternative possibilities include the recruitment of tyrosine phosphatases that is sensitive to serine/threonine phosphorylation of the receptor, or that activation of serine/threonine kinases leads directly to cellular phosphatase activation and thereby indirectly modulates RTK activity (17Morrison P. Takishima K. Rosner M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15536-15543Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A model involving fold-back inhibition by the carboxyl tail of the EGF receptor has been proposed (45Ullrich A. Schlessinger J. Cell. 1990; 61: 203-212Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4593) Google Scholar). We have, for the first time, been able to detect interactions between the EGFR cytoplasmic tail and its own kinase domain and show that this interaction can be disrupted by prephosphorylation of the EGFR cytoplasmic tail with CaM kinase II (Fig. 6). These data raise the intriguing possibility that the mechanism by which CaM kinase II regulates EGFR signaling and autokinase activity is through a direct effect on a substrate interaction with an enzyme active site. Additional regulation and complete shutdown of the kinase might then be achieved by the subsequent phosphorylation of serine 744 in helix C of the EGFR kinase domain, which would disrupt the helix C interactions required for stabilization of an active kinase configuration. Serine 744 phosphorylation may also be a dominant regulatory modification, since the S744A mutant EGFR no longer retains sensitivity to kinase regulation in the presence of constitutively active CaM kinase II, in contrast with the alanine mutants in the EGFR cytoplasmic tail (Fig.5). In conclusion, the studies reported here highlight the importance of CaM kinase II in the feedback regulation and differential control of RTK signaling. We have shown that the number and location of CaM kinase sites within important structural domains can account for the degree of tyrosine kinase regulation and ultimately contribute to the strength of signal emanating from activated cell surface receptors such as HER2/c-erbB2 and the EGFR. An important goal for future research will be to fully understand the structural aspects of these events and, through the use of phosphopeptide-specific antisera raised against individual phosphorylation sites, examine spatial and temporal signal activation of these key receptor regulatory pathways in vivo.

https://openalex.org/W2001631795,"Insulin-like growth factor binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3) inhibits proliferation and promotes apoptosis in normal and malignant cells. In MCF-10A human mammary epithelial cells, 30 ng/ml human plasma-derived IGFBP-3 inhibited DNA synthesis to 70% of control. This inhibition appeared IGF-independent, since neither an IGF-receptor antibody nor IGFBP-6 inhibited DNA synthesis. Malignant transformation of MCF-10A cells by transfection with Ha-rasoncogene abolished the inhibitory effect of IGFBP-3, concomitant with an increase in IGFBP-3 secretion and cell association of approximately 60 and 300%, respectively. When mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase activation was partially inhibited using PD 98059, IGFBP-3 sensitivity in ras-transfected cells was restored, with a significant inhibitory effect at 10 ng/ml IGFBP-3. PD 98059 had no effect on IGFBP-3 secretion or cell association by ras-transfected or parent MCF-10A cells. Hs578T, a tumor-derived breast cancer cell line that expresses activated Ha-ras, similarly has a high level of secreted and cell-associated IGFBP-3. In the absence of PD 98059, DNA synthesis by Hs578T cells was reduced to 70% of control by 1000 ng/ml IGFBP-3. PD 98059 increased sensitivity to IGFBP-3, so that this level of inhibition was achieved with 100 ng/ml IGFBP-3. These results suggest that MAP kinase activation by oncogenic rasexpression causes IGFBP-3 resistance, a possible factor in the dysregulation of breast cancer cell growth."
https://openalex.org/W2066310698,"In the purple, photosynthetic bacterium,<i>Rhodobacter capsulatus</i>, the RegB/RegA two-component system is required for activation of several anaerobic processes, such as synthesis of the photosynthetic apparatus and assimilation of CO<sub>2</sub> and N<sub>2</sub> <i>.</i> It is believed that RegB is an integral membrane histidine kinase that monitors the external environment. Under anaerobic growth conditions, it transduces a signal through phosphorylation of the response regulator, RegA, which then induces target gene expression. We used an <i>in vitro</i>assay to characterize the phosphorylation of wild-type RegA and a mutant variant (RegA*) that is responsible for abnormally high photosynthesis gene expression under both aerobic and anaerobic growth conditions. Phosphorylation assays indicate that phosphorylated RegA* (RegA*∼P) is much more stable than RegA∼P, indicating that it may be locked in a conformation that is resistant to dephosphorylation. DNase I footprint assays also indicate that unphosphorylated RegA* has a much higher affinity for specific DNA binding sites than the wild-type protein. Phosphorylation of RegA* increases DNA binding 2.5-fold, whereas phosphorylation of RegA increases DNA binding more than 16-fold. Collectively, these results support the hypothesis that RegA* is a constitutively active variant that does not require phosphorylation to assume a structural conformation required to bind DNA."

It was proposed that porins, in addition to lipopolysaccharides, are responsible for this binding. We studied the interactions of human lactoferrin with the three major porins ofEscherichia coli OmpC, OmpF, and PhoE. Binding experiments were performed on both purified porins and porin-deficient E. coli K12 isogenic mutants. We determined that lactoferrin binds to the purified native OmpC or PhoE trimer with molar ratios of 1.9 ± 0.4 and 1.8 ± 0.3 and Kdvalues of 39 ± 18 and 103 ± 15 nm, respectively, but not to OmpF. Furthermore, preferential binding of lactoferrin was observed on strains that express either OmpC or PhoE. It was also demonstrated that residues 1–5, 28–34, and 39–42 of lactoferrin interact with porins. Based on sequence comparisons, the involvement of lactoferrin amino acid residues and porin loops in the interactions is discussed. The relationships between binding and antibacterial activity of the protein were studied using E. coli mutants and planar lipid bilayers. Electrophysiological studies revealed that lactoferrin can act as a blocking agent for OmpC but not for PhoE or OmpF. However, a total inhibition of the growth was only observed for the PhoE-expressing strain (minimal inhibitory concentration of lactoferrin was 2.4 mg/ml). These data support the proposal that the antibacterial activity of lactoferrin may depend, at least in part, on its ability to bind to porins, thus modifying the stability and/or the permeability of the bacterial outer membrane.

Tonnelat J. Mullet S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1960; 45: 413-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar), and in polymorphonuclear leukocytes (2Masson P.L. Heremans J.F. Schönne E. J. Exp. Med. 1969; 130: 643-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar). The biological roles of Lf include antibacterial activities through mechanisms not yet clearly elucidated. The ability of Lf to tightly chelate two ferric ions allows the protein to limit the iron availability to bacteria and ultimately causes bacteriostasis (3Oram J.D. Reiter B. Biochim. Biophys.

Moreover, Lf and an Lf-derived peptide called lactoferricin (Lfcin) (5Bellamy W. Takase M. Yamauchi K. Wakabayashi H. Kawase K. Tomita M. Biochim. Biophys.

Forsgren A. Naidu A.S. Infect. Immun. 1994; 62: 1236-1240Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Kishore A.R. Erdei E. Naidu S.S. Falsen E. Forsgren A. Naidu A.S. FEMS Microbiol.

Immun. 1992; 60: 2619-2626Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) reported potential interactions of either hLf or bLf with porins, the major pore-forming proteins of the outer membrane of various Gram-negative bacteria. In particular, the binding of Lf to porins OmpF and OmpC in E. coli was reported (13Erdei J. Forsgren A. Naidu A.S. Infect. Immun. 1994; 62: 1236-1240Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the biochemical evidence of interactions between Lf and porins was mainly based upon Western blot analyses using SDS-extracted and heat-denatured porin monomers. Because porins are potential receptors for bacteriophages and colicins (16Nikaido H. Vaara M. Microbiol. Rev. 1985; 49: 1-32Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,17Pugsley A.P. Microbiol. Sci. 1984; 1: 168-175PubMed Google Scholar), it is likely that Lf may use porins as anchoring sites at the surface of the outer membrane of bacteria. One can also hypothesize that the binding of Lf to porins either facilitates the destabilization of the bacterial outer membrane or limits the permeability of the membrane. In the present paper, we have investigated whether hLf specifically binds to porins and how it does. The binding characteristics of hLf to porins OmpC, OmpF, and PhoE in E. coli were studied. Purified native porins and porin-deficient isogenic mutants of E. coli K12 were used. The porin-binding site of hLf was located using various hLf-derived proteins. Finally, a possible relationship between hLf binding to porins and the antibacterial activity of the protein was investigated with E. coli porin mutants and through electrophysiological studies in a planar lipid bilayer system. E. coli K12 strains constitutively expressing OmpC only, EC1234; OmpF only, EC1233; PhoE only, EC1230; or no major porins at all, EC1231 (18Korteland J. Tommassen J. Lugtenberg B. Biochim. Biophys.

Tommassen (Utrecht, The Netherlands) and were routinely grown in Luria-Bertani (LB) medium at 37 °C with aerobic shaking. Native OmpC, OmpF, and PhoE porin trimers were extracted and purified to homogeneity from EC1234, EC1233, and EC1230 E. coli K12 strains, respectively, as described previously (19Lakey J.H. Pattus F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 186: 303-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Purity of porin samples was verified by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (20Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207012) Google Scholar) followed by Coomassie Blue staining. No LPSs were detected by the Limulus amoebocyte lysate assay (QCL1000, BioWhittaker). Native hLf was prepared according to Spik et al. (21Spik G. Strecker G. Fournet B. Bouquelet S. Montreuil J. Dorland L. van Halbeek H. Vliegenthart J.F.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1982; 121: 413-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). The iron-saturated and apo forms of hLf were prepared as described previously (22Mazurier J. Spik G. Biochim. Biophys.

Acta. 1983; 745: 44-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Mild tryptic digestion of hLf gave the N-terminally deleted proteins hLf−3N (residues 4–692) and hLf−4N (residues 5–692) (24Legrand D. van Berkel P.H.C. Salmon V. van Veen H.A. Slomianny M.C. Nuijens J. Spik G. Biochem.

Human serotransferrin (hTf) and bLf were purchased from Sigma and Biopole (Brussels, Belgium), respectively. All chemicals used were of the highest analytical grade. Nonmodified recombinant hLf (rhLf), rhLf−5N, a mutated rhLf, in which sequence 1GRRRR5 was deleted, and rhLf-EGS, a rhLf whose sequence 28RKVRGPP34 was replaced by EGS (the 365–367 C-terminal counterpart of sequence 28–34) were produced in a baculovirus expression system as previously reported (12Elass-Rochard E.

Protein Expression Purif. 1997; 9: 203-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The rhLf-SAST corresponds to rhLf in which39KRDS42 was substituted by residues SAST, the 372–375 C-terminal counterpart of sequence 39–42. For this purpose, a mutagenic oligonucleotide 5′-GTCAGCTGCATATCAGCATCAACCCCCATCCAGTG-3′ was synthesized by Eurogentec (Seraing, Belgium). The template for the mutagenesis was the phage M13-mp11, containing a 346-base pairEcoRI-AccI fragment of the coding sequence cloned into a pBluescript SK plasmid (27Legrand D. Salmon V. Coddeville B. Benaı̈ssa M. Plancke Y. Spik G. FEBS Lett. 1995; 365: 57-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The mutation was confirmed by DNA sequence analysis, and the mutated EcoRI-AccI was ligated back into pBluescript SK with the complementary part of the full-length cDNA of hLf as formerly described (27Legrand D. Salmon V. Coddeville B. Benaı̈ssa M. Plancke Y. Spik G. FEBS Lett. 1995; 365: 57-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Finally, the mutated cDNA was subcloned into pVL1392 (PharMingen), and the rhLf-SAST was produced in the baculovirus expression system and purified on a SP-Sepharose fast flow column, as described previously (26Salmon V. Legrand D. Georges B. Slomianny M.C. Coddeville B. Spik G. Protein Expression Purif. 1997; 9: 203-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The purity of the mutant protein was verified by 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by Coomassie Blue staining. The N-terminal amino acid sequence analysis was performed with the Edman degradation procedure, using an Applied BioSystem 477 protein sequencer. Human Lf was labeled either with125I or with 59Fe. Radioiodination of hLf (100–200 μg) was carried out with 0.3 mCi of 125I in the presence of two Iodo-Beads (Pierce), according to the manufacturer's instructions. After 10 min of incubation on ice, free iodine was removed by gel filtration on a Sephadex G-25 PD-10 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Specific radioactivity was typically between 700,000 and 1,000,000 cpm/μg of protein. For 59Fe labeling, iron was first removed from hLf as described previously (22Mazurier J. Spik G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1980; 629: 399-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Human Lf was then incubated 30 min at room temperature in a 0.25 mm sodium nitrilotriacetate, 0.1 m Tris/HCl, 0.1 m sodium bicarbonate, pH 8.2, solution containing an appropriate amount of 59Fe (33 μg/ml of carrier-free59FeCl3 in 0.1 M of HCl, 0.1 mCi/ml, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Finally, free iron was eliminated by passing the solution through a Dowex 1 × 8 column (Bio-Rad) and desalting on a PD-10 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). A typical specific radioactivity of about 5,000 cpm/μg of 59Fe-hLf was obtained. To avoid radiation damage, the radiolabeled proteins were used immediately for the binding experiments. Purified porins OmpC, OmpF, and PhoE were diluted in a 75 mm Tris/HCl, pH 6.8, buffer at a concentration of 46 nm. Denaturation of porins was achieved by boiling aliquots of the porin solutions at 95 °C for 10 min in the presence of 1% SDS (w/v). Fifty μl of the porin solutions (0.9 pmol of porin trimer) were then slot blotted to a 0.45-μm nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher & Schuell) using a Bio-Dot SF Microfiltration Apparatus (Bio-Rad). After drying, excess sites on the membrane were blocked with a phosphate-buffered saline/2% Tween 20 (w/v) solution for 45 min, and the membrane was washed with phosphate-buffered saline/0.05% Tween 20 (w/v) (washing solution). It was then incubated for 1 h with washing solution containing 125 nm unlabeled or radiolabeled hLf. For the optimal binding pH experiments, incubations were performed using 125 nmunlabeled hLf in the washing solution at pH values ranging from 5.0 to 8.0 with 0.5 pH unit increments. For Scatchard analysis (28Scatchard G. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1949; 51: 660-672Crossref Scopus (17798) Google Scholar), nitrocellulose strips were incubated with various hLf concentrations ranging from 0 to 250 nm in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.3. When experiments were performed with radiolabeled proteins, membranes were washed three times with the washing solution and dried, and the slots were cut for further counting on a Compugamma LKB-Wallac γ-radiation counter. When immunochemical staining was required, washed membranes were first incubated with rabbit polyclonal anti-hLf antibodies (1/1000 diluted whole antiserum produced in our laboratory) in a washing solution for 40 min, washed again, and incubated for 40 min with goat peroxidase-labeled anti-rabbit IgG antibodies (dilution 1/2500 in washing solution) (Biosys). Staining was achieved by using the Diaminobenzidine Peroxidase Substrate Tablet Set (Sigma) according to the manufacturer's instructions. All incubations were carried out at room temperature. Samples containing 6.25, 3.12, 1.56, 0.75, 0.37, 0.19, and 0.09 pmols of either unlabeled or 125I- or59Fe-labeled hLf dissolved in 75 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.3, were also applied to nitrocellulose paper as standards for further quantification. Quantification of hLf bound to porins was performed by densitometry analysis using a Hewlett-Packard 4C scanner and Biosoft Quantiscan software. Scatchard plot analysis was performed using Biosoft Enzfitter software. Purified native OmpC and PhoE trimers (0.9 pmol) and 0.09–3.12 pmols samples of hLf-derived proteins were immobilized on nitrocellulose paper that was blocked and washed as described above. Blots were then incubated with 125 nm of each of the hLf-derived proteins for 1 h at room temperature and immunostained as previously mentioned. Quantitation of porin-bound proteins was performed with Quantiscan software in comparison with the blotted protein standards. Radioiodinated proteins are generally used for cell binding studies. However, because we have demonstrated that125I-hLf was unable to bind to purified porins, two different methods allowed us to compare the binding parameters of hLf to mutant strains EC1230, EC1231, EC1233, and EC1234. First, the affinity constants were estimated by flow fluorocytometry. In this method, bacterial strains were grown 3–5 h in LB medium at 37 °C to an A 600 of 0.5 (5 × 108cells/ml), washed in M9 medium supplemented with essential amino acids, pH 7.3 (29Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar), harvested, and resuspended in M9 medium containing 0.2% hTf (w/v) to minimize nonspecific binding to plastic vials and to bacteria. Aliquots of a 200-μl cell suspension containing 106 cells were incubated with hLf concentrations ranging from 0 to 250 nm for 45 min. After washing, bacterial cells were incubated for 45 min in M9 medium containing 0.2% (w/v) bovine serum albumin and purified rabbit fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled anti-hLf antibodies prepared in our laboratory. Green fluorescence bound to bacteria was then measured using a Becton-Dickinson FACScan Flow Cytometer. Bacteria were gated for forward and side angle light scatters, and 10,000 events of the gated population were analyzed. The 1024 fluorescence channels were set on a logarithmic scale, and the mean fluorescence intensity was determined. The affinity constants of hLf to E. coli mutant strains were calculated by Scatchard plot analysis using the Biosoft Enzfitter software. The lack of internal hLf standard in cytometry experiments led to59Fe-hLf binding studies to estimate the total number of hLf-binding sites on bacteria. For this, 108 bacterial cells in 1 ml of M9 medium were incubated with 250 nm59Fe-hLf for 45 min. Then, cells were washed three times with M9 medium, and pellets were counted on a Compugamma LKB-Wallac γ-radiation counter. Nonspecific binding of hLf to bacteria was determined by adding a 100-fold excess of cold iron-saturated hLf to the incubation mixture. All incubations were performed at room temperature. All experiments were carried out using double quartz-distilled water, reagent grade chemicals, and a septum pressed between two Teflon cups. Schindler (30Schindler H. FEBS Lett. 1980; 122: 77-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) technique bilayers were formed across a 200-μm hole in a 12-μm-thick Teflon septum pretreated with a solution of 2% n-hexadecane inn-hexane. Conductance measurements and the criteria for bilayer formation were as described (19Lakey J.H. Pattus F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 186: 303-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The transcompartment was held to virtual earth. The sign of the membrane potential referred to that on the cis side of the membrane, and the values quoted, therefore, refer toVcis-Vtrans. 50–85 pmols of OmpC, OmpF, or PhoE native purified porins were then added to the subphase on the cis side of the preformed bilayers with the aqueous solution stirred by a magnetic bar. The membrane current was amplified with a Burr Brown current-voltage converter with an operational amplifier and feedback resistors ranging from 108 to 109 ohms. Solutions of hLf or bLf at final concentrations of 56–560 nm in a 10 mmTris acetate, 5 mm CaCl2, 0.1 m NaCl, pH 7.0, were incubated in the cis compartment at a 50 mV potential to favor interactions of hLf with porins. Recordings were filtered at 1 kHz with a EG and G low-pass filter and recorded on a Racal FM tape recorder. All experiments were performed at room temperature in a Faraday chamber. Bacterial strains EC1230, EC1231, EC1233, and EC1234 were grown 3–5 h in LB medium at 37 °C to an A 600 of 0.5 (5 × 108 cells/ml) and then diluted in 1% Bacto-tryptone (w/v) (Difco) to obtain 2 × 105 bacteria/ml. Five μl of this cell suspension were added to 250 μl of 1% Bacto-tryptone (w/v) buffered at pH 7.3 with 20 mm sodium phosphate and containing iron-saturated hLf at concentrations of 0.12, 0.5, 1.2, 2.4, 3.6, and 16 mg/ml that was previously sterilized by filtration on 0.1 μm sterile filters (Millipore). Incubations were performed in 5-ml sterile glass tubes at 37 °C for 18 h under gentle shaking. Bacteria were then diluted and grown for 24 h at 37 °C on LB agar plates for counting. The sample without hLf served as the negative control. We tested whether hLf was able to bind to nitrocellulose-immobilized porins, either in the SDS- and heat-denatured monomeric form or in the native trimeric form. Binding studies were performed with 125 nm unlabeled and iron-saturated hLf followed by immunostaining. As shown in TableI, hLf bound to native trimeric OmpC and, in a lesser extent, to denatured monomeric OmpC with hLf/porin molar ratios of 1.9 and 0.8, respectively. Human Lf bound to native trimeric PhoE in a way similar to that of OmpC trimers with a molar ratio of 1.8, but no binding was observed when PhoE porins were denatured (monomeric form). Concerning OmpF, a very low binding of hLf to either denatured or native forms of the porin was noted. The molar ratio was about 0.1. Similar results were obtained when either nonsaturated (apo) or 59Fe-saturated hLf was used as a probe (data not shown). However, the binding of 125I-labeled hLf was only observed on denatured porins OmpC and PhoE with molar ratios as low as 0.2 and 0.1, respectively (data not shown).Table IBinding of hLf to purified OmpC, OmpF, and PhoE porin trimersPorinsTreatment of porin trimersNDOmpC1.9 ± 0.40.8 ± 0.2OmpF0.1 ± 0.10.1 ± 0.1PhoE1.8 ± 0.30Solid-phase ligand-binding assays were performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Data are expressed as the amount of hLf (pmol) bound to 1 pmol of porin trimer either in the native form (N) or in the denatured form (D), i.e. boiled in the presence of SDS.

Results are given as mean ± S.E. for three independent experiments. 0, below limit of detection (<0.1). Because hLf exhibited significant binding to the OmpC and PhoE porins in the native trimeric form, further studies were performed only with these two porins. The binding of iron-saturated hLf to native porins OmpC and PhoE was estimated at pH values ranging from 5.0 to 8.0. Maximal binding of hLf to OmpC and PhoE occurred around pH 6.6 and 7.5, respectively (data not shown). On the basis of these results, an intermediate pH value of 7.3 was used to determine the hLf binding parameters to porins according to the Scatchard method (28Scatchard G. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1949; 51: 660-672Crossref Scopus (17798) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1, the binding of hLf to porins was both concentration-dependent and saturable at concentrations ranging from 10 to 250 nm. Calculated dissociation constants (Kd) were 39 ± 18 and 103 ± 15 nm, and hLf/porin trimer molar ratios were 1.9 ± 0.1 and 1.8 ± 0.2 for OmpC and PhoE, respectively. To localize the porin-binding site of hLf, the binding of eight hLf-derived proteins to native OmpC and PhoE was assayed. Furthermore, hTf and bLf were used to evaluate the specificity of hLf binding. TableII shows that none of the N- and C-terminal fragments or the N2 fragment of hLf significantly bound to OmpC or PhoE. Furthermore, the absence of residues 1–3, 1–4, and 1–5 in hLf strongly decreased the binding of the protein to PhoE. The binding of hLf−3N, hLf−4N, and rhLf−5N to PhoE was only 26, 24, and 9% of that of intact hLf, respectively. Similar results were obtained with OmpC, except that the deletion of residues 1–3 (hLf−3N) from hLf did not affect the binding of the protein. The binding of hLf−4Nand rhLf−5N to OmpC was 42 and 7% of the native hLf control, respectively. Furthermore, Table II shows that rhLf-EGS and rhLf-SAST, which correspond to hLf modified at sequences 28–34 and 39–42, respectively, also exhibited low binding capacities to both OmpC and PhoE. Lastly, whereas the binding of hTf to the porins was not detectable, bLf bound to OmpC and PhoE in a way similar to that of hLf.Table IIBinding of hLf-derived proteins to purified OmpC, OmpF, and PhoE porin trimersProteinsPorinsOmpCOmpFPhoEhLf, rhLf (1–692) or bLf1.7 ± 0.401.5 ± 0.3hTf000hLf−3N(4–692)1.7 ± 0.400.4 ± 0.1hLf−4N(5–692)0.7 ± 0.200.4 ± 0.1rhLf−5N(6–692)0.1 ± 0.100.1 ± 0.1rhLf-EGS (mutation at 28–34)0.1 ± 0.100.1 ± 0.1rhLf-SAST (mutation at 39–42)0.4 ± 0.200.2 ± 0.1hLf N-terminal fragment (4–283)000hLf C-terminal fragment (284–692)000hLf N2 fragment (91–255)000Solid-phase ligand-binding assays were performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Results are expressed as the amount of hLf-derived protein (pmol) bound to 1 pmol of purified native porin and are given as mean ± S.E. for three independent experiments. 0, below limit of detection (<0.2 for the hLf N2 fragment and <0.1 for the other proteins).

The effect of hLf on the channel conductance of OmpC, OmpF, and PhoE integrated in azolectin bilayers was studied. Porin trimers were incorporated into these bilayers by injecting detergent-solubilized protein into the bathing solution (cis compartment). The appearance of channels was shown by the stepwise increases in current when voltage clamped at 50 mV. When the potential across the bilayer was raised from 80 to 200 mV, downward current steps confirmed the closure of individual monomers. Depending on the experiment, conductance measurements revealed 1–4 porin trimers integrated into the bilayers. Fig. 2 a illustrates a representative experiment where four OmpC trimers were integrated in the membrane and incubated with 56 nm hLf. After a time lag of 160 s, injection of hLf in the cis compartment increased the noise of the current trace. The enlargment shown in theinset of Fig. 2 a demonstrates that this noise consisted of 25 pA current fluctuations because of the fast closing and opening of porin channels. These fluctuations are of the same amplitude as those observed in the absence of hLf. Raising the hLf concentrations to 560 nm significantly increased the frequency but not the amplitude of the current fluctuations (Fig. 2 b). Fluctuation did not occur when the polarity of the membrane potential was reversed (Fig. 2 b). When bLf was used instead of hLf, a blocking effect on OmpC was also observed but at a lower frequency (Fig.2 c). In contrast to OmpC, neither PhoE (Fig. 2 d) nor OmpF porins (data not shown) exhibited significant conductance alterations in the presence of 56–560 nm hLf concentrations. These results show that hLf and, to a lower extent, bLf induce open-closed transitions of the OmpC pores, whereas PhoE and OmpF are unaffected. To assess the role of OmpC or PhoE in binding hLf to the bacterial cell surface, the binding parameters of hLf to the isogenic E. coli K12 strains EC1230 (PhoE+), EC1231 (no major porins), EC1233 (OmpF+), and EC1234 (OmpC+) were investigated. Because we observed that59Fe-hLf, but not 125I-hLf, was able to bind to purified porins, the radioiron-labeled protein was used as a probe. However, because of its low specific radioactivity (about 5000 cpm/μg), 59Fe-hLf was unsuitable to perform Scatchard analysis at low ligand concentrations. Therefore, we carried out flow cytofluorometry studies using immunorevealed hLf to estimate the dissociation constants (Kd) of the ligand. Then, the number of binding sites/bacterium was compared through binding experiments with radioiron-labeled hLf. As reported in TableIII, lower Kd were calculated for the strains expressing OmpC and PhoE than for the strains expressing OmpF or no major porins at all. Moreover, 40–50,000 more binding sit"
https://openalex.org/W1974298095,"We discovered several novel interactions between proteins involved in Crm1-mediated nuclear export of the nuclear export signal containing human immunodeficiency virus type 1 protein Rev. First, a Rev/Crm1/RanGTP complex (where Ran is Ras-related nuclear protein) reacts with some nucleoporins (Nup42 and Nup159) but not others (NSP1, Nup116, and Nup1), forming a Nup/Crm1/RanGTP complex and concomitantly releasing Rev. Second, RanBP1 (or homologous proteins) can displace Nup and form a ternary RanBP1/RanGTP/Crm1 complex that can be disassembled by RanGAP via GTP hydrolysis. Third, and most surprisingly, RanBP1/RanGTP/Crm1 can be disassembled without GTP hydrolysis by the nucleotide exchange factor RanGEF. Recycling of a Ran/RanGEF complex by GTP and Mg2+ is stimulated by both Crm1 and Rev, allowing reformation of a Rev/Crm1/RanGTP complex.

One of the major unresolved problems in bidirectional macromolecular traffic across the nuclear porecomplex (NPC) 1The abbreviations used are: NPC, nuclear pore complex; cNLS, classical nuclear localization sequence; GAP, GTPase activating protein; GEF, guanine nucleotide exchange factor; GST, glutathione S-transferase; NES, nuclear export signal; LMB, leptomycin B; RRE, Rev response element; HIV-1, human immunodeficiency virus, type 1; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; Ran, Ras-related nuclear protein; kaps, karyopherins; nups, nucleoporins. is the sequence of events in which soluble transport factors interact with a distinct subset of nucleoporins (nups) (a collective term for NPC proteins). These interactions between the mobile and the stationary phase of transport are thought to facilitate translocation of cargo across the approximately 200-nm distance of the NPC (reviewed in Ref.1Ohno M. Fornerod M. Mattaj I.W. Cell. 1998; 92: 327-336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). Several distinct import and export pathways have been identified each mediated by a signal in the transport substrate and by cognate signal recognition factors (reviewed in Refs. 2Pemberton L.F. Blobel G. Rosenblum J.S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 392-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar and 3Wozniak R.W. Rout M.P. Aitchison J.D. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 184-188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). The latter are members of a structurally related family of proteins and are referred to as karyopherins (kaps) (also termed importins, exportins, transportins, Ran-binding proteins, or various three-letter terms inSaccharomyces cerevisiae). The key regulator crucial for all import and export pathways is the small GTPase Ran. Ran exists in a GDP- or GTP-bound form. The location of RanGAP primarily in the cytoplasm (4Hopper A.K. Traglia H.M. Dunst R.W. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 309-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) and RanGEF primarily in the nucleus (5Amberg D.C. Fleischermann M. Stagljar I. Cole C.N. Aebi M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 233-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 6Ohtsubo M. Okazaki H. Nishimoto T. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 1389-1397Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar) is believed to generate a nucleocytoplasmic gradient of RanGTP (nucleoplasm) and RanGDP (cytoplasm) across the NPC, which is thought to be one of the determinants for directionality of transport (7Izaurralde E. Kutay U. von Kobbe C. Mattaj I.W. Görlich D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6535-6547Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). Another likely determinant is the asymmetric distribution of nups on either side of the NPC. Ran is further modulated by two small Ran-binding proteins as follows: RanBP1 (Ran-bindingprotein 1), which binds RanGTP and stimulates GTP hydrolysis by RanGAP but inhibits GTP exchange by RanGEF (8Bischoff F.R. Krebber H. Smirnova E. Dong W. Ponstingl H. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 705-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar, 9Coutavas E. Ren M. Oppenheim J.D. D'Eustachio P. Rush M.G.

Much of our understanding of nuclear transport comes from studies of nuclear protein import. In the classical import pathway a cNLS (classical nuclear localizationsignal) is recognized and docked to the NPC by the kap α/β1 heterodimer (reviewed in Ref. 3Wozniak R.W. Rout M.P. Aitchison J.D. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 184-188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). The cNLS-bound kap α/β1 binds to several peptide repeat-containing nups in vitro(18Rexach M.

Together these data led to the proposal that RanGTP may function in repeated cycles of docking and undocking along the cytonucleoplasmic axis of the NPC (18Rexach M. Blobel G.

Alternatively, RanGTP may exert its dissociative abilities only at the end point of transport on the nucleoplasmic side of the NPC (26Görlich D. Pante N. Kutay U. Aebi U. Bischoff F.R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5584-5594Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar). Crm1 (also known as exportin1, Xpo1, or Kap124)-mediated export of NES-containing proteins was the first nuclear export pathway to be discovered (30Wolff B. Sanglier J.J. Wang Y. Chem.

Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 1195-1207Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Recently, the human homolog was found to be a soluble protein that interacts with the nucleoporin Nup214/CAN (36Fornerod M. van Deursen J. van Baal S. Reynolds A. Davis D. Murti K.G. Fransen J. Grosveld G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 807-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). Evidence that Crm1 is a kap came from inhibitor studies with the antifungal drug leptomycin B (LMB). InSchizosaccharomyces pombe LMB was shown to target Crm1 (37Nishi K. Yoshida M. Fujiwara D. Nishikawa M. Horinouchi S. Beppu T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6320-6324Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When LMB was found to inhibit nuclear export of the HIV-1 protein Rev, Crm1 was suggested to be the kap that exports Rev from the nucleus (30Wolff B. Sanglier J.J. Wang Y. Chem.

Rev contains an RNA-binding site that interacts with a specific Rev responseelement (RRE) in viral mRNA (41Hadzopoulous-Cladaras M. Felber B.K. Cladaras C. Athanassopoulos A. Tse A. Pavlakis G.N. J.

In addition to a cNLS Rev also contains an NES, a leucine-rich stretch of amino acids that is required and sufficient for nuclear export of Rev (42Malim M.H. Böhnlein S. Hauber J. Cullen B.R.

Previous studies have shown direct binding of Crm1 to an NES peptide (31Fornerod M. Ohno M. Yoshida M. Mattaj I.W.

Cell. 1997; 90: 1051-1060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1744) Google Scholar). It is now thought that Crm1 and NES interact in the absence of Ran but that a ternary complex is formed when RanGTP is present (49Askjaer P. Jensen T.H. Nilsson J. Englmeier L. Kjems J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33414-33422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). The interaction between Crm1 and NES is sensitive to LMB (31Fornerod M. Ohno M. Yoshida M.

Biol. 1997; 4: 139-147Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). A Revinteracting protein, termed Rip1, has been previously identified (50Bogerd H.P. Fridell R.A. Madore S. Cullen B.R. Cell. 1995; 82: 485-494Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar, 51Stutz F. Neville M. Rosbash M. Cell. 1995; 82: 495-506Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Rip1 is an FG peptide repeat containing nucleoporin (51Stutz F. Neville M. Rosbash M. Cell. 1995; 82: 495-506Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar) and has therefore been termed Nup42. The Nup42/Rev interaction is bridged by Crm1 (52Neville M. Stutz F. Lee L. Davis L.I. Rosbash M. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 767-775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Crm1 was shown to export an NES reporter protein (34Stade K. Ford C.S. Guthrie C. Weis K. Cell. 1997; 90: 1041-1050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (939) Google Scholar). Together these findings have defined a Crm1-mediated nuclear export pathway. However, the molecular mechanism of Crm1-mediated protein export is unknown. We have investigated Crm1-mediated nuclear export using GTP hydrolysis and exchange assays, as well as a solution binding assay, all with recombinant yeast proteins. The export substrate we have used for our studies was the HIV-1 protein Rev. As previously proposed for NLS-mediated import, we suggest that NES-dependent nuclear export may involve multiple rounds of docking and undocking at the NPC proteins. Yeast Ran and RanGAP were expressed and purified as described (24Floer M. Blobel G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5313-5316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Yeast RanGEF, RanBP1, Nup36, and the FXFG peptide repeat region of Nup1 were expressed and purified as described (27Floer M. Blobel G. Rexach M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19538-19546Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). HIV-1 Rev protein was purchased from Intracel. Crm1 was expressed as a GST fusion protein. The gene encoding Crm1 was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from S. cerevisiae genomic DNA (Promega). The PCR product was inserted as a BamHI/SalI fragment into vector pGEX-4T3 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), into which a Tev protease cleavage site had been inserted (this vector was kindly provided by Y. M. Chook). 2Y. M. Chook, unpublished observations. The protein was expressed in Escherichia coli strain DH5α. The GST fusion protein was purified on glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and the GST moiety was cleaved by incubation with 1,000 units of Tev protease (Life Technologies, Inc.) per 20 mg of protein for 12 h at 21 °C. The purified protein was stored in frozen aliquots at −80 °C. To obtain recombinant Nup42 protein the gene encoding Nup42 was amplified from S. cerevisiae genomic DNA by PCR. The resulting PCR product was inserted into pGEX-4T3 as aBamHI/SalI fragment. The protein was expressed inE. coli strain DH5α, purified, and cleaved with thrombin as described for other GST proteins (24Floer M. Blobel G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5313-5316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The protein was stored in frozen aliquots at −80 °C. Recombinant Nup116 and NSP1 were expressed as GST fusion proteins. The genes encoding Nup116 and NSP1 were amplified from S. cerevisiae genomic DNA by PCR. The PCR products were inserted as aBglII/XhoI or BamHI/SmaI fragment, respectively, into vector pGEX-4T3. The GST fusion proteins were expressed in E. coli strain BL21(DE3). The proteins were purified on glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and eluted with 10 mm glutathione as described for other GST fusion proteins (27Floer M. Blobel G. Rexach M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19538-19546Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The purified proteins were stored in frozen aliquots at −80 °C. The fragment of Nup159 containing its FG peptide repeat region was expressed as a His fusion protein as described (53Kraemer D.M. Strambio-de-Castillo C. Blobel G. Rout M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19017-19021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The protein was purified on a His-Trap column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using a linear gradient of imidazole (5–500 mm) in buffer A (150 mm KOAc, 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.3), 2 mmMg(OAc)2). The protein eluted at 200–250 mmimidazole. Fractions containing Nup159 were pooled, concentrated, and fractionated on a Superdex 200 FPLC column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with buffer A containing 1 mm dithiothreitol. Fractions containing Nup159 were pooled, and frozen aliquots were stored at −80 °C. To obtain GST-Ran the gene encoding Ran was amplified from S. cerevisiae genomic DNA by PCR. The PCR product was inserted as aBamHI fragment into vector pGEX-2TK (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The protein was purified as described for GST fusion proteins (27Floer M. Blobel G. Rexach M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19538-19546Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) in phosphate-buffered saline buffer (140 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 10 mm Na2HPO4, 1.8 mm KH2PO4 (pH 7.3)). GST-Ran was found to be mostly nucleotide-free in phosphate-buffered saline buffer, as determined by a previously described method (24Floer M. Blobel G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5313-5316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). GST-Ran could be loaded with GTP by incubation with 1 mm GTP in the presence of 5 mm Mg(OAc)2 for 1 h at 21 °C. Free nucleotide was removed by dialysis against buffer A containing 1 mm dithiothreitol. This resulted in GST-Ran that was mostly GTP-bound (80–90%). Assays were performed as described previously (27Floer M. Blobel G. Rexach M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19538-19546Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). For hydrolysis assays 0.5 nmRan-[γ-32P]GTP was incubated with other proteins as indicated in the figure legends for 15 min at 21 °C. Then 15 nm RanGAP was added, and the reactions were incubated for 20 min at 21 °C. To determine the dissociation constants for RanGTP complexes, we also measured inhibition of GTP hydrolysis after 2 min reaction time. We did not observe any differences between theK D values measured after a 2-min or a 20-min reaction. For exchange assays 0.5 or 10 nmRan-[α-32P]GTP was incubated with other proteins as indicated in the figure legends for 15 min at 21 °C. Then 20 or 80 nm RanGEF was added together with 200 μm GTP and 200 μm GDP, and the reactions were incubated for 20 min at 21 °C Assay were performed essentially as described (27Floer M. Blobel G. Rexach M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19538-19546Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). GST-RanGTP was incubated with glutathione-agarose beads (Sigma) for 20 min at 21 °C (7 μg of GST-RanGTP per 10 μl of beads) in 0.5 ml of binding buffer (150 mm KOAc, 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.3), 2 mm Mg(OAc)2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% Tween 20, and 0.1% casamino acids). For the one-step assay the following procedure was followed: after washing with binding buffer, 10 μl beads per reaction was incubated with other proteins as indicated in the figure legends in a final volume of 40 μl for 30 min at 21 °C. For the two-step assay the following procedure was followed: after washing with binding buffer, the immobilized GST-Ran was incubated with 1.7 μmRanGEF for 20 min at 21 °C. The beads were washed and 10 μl of beads per reaction was incubated with GTP and other proteins as indicated in a final volume of 40 μl for 10 min at 21 °C. The unbound fraction was collected by removing 28 μl from the meniscus after centrifugation at 2,000 × g for 1 min. The beads were washed twice with 0.5 ml of binding buffer. Then 18 μl of binding buffer was added; this constitutes the bound fraction. 6 μl of 6× Laemmli sample buffer with 2-mercaptoethanol was added to the bound and unbound fractions. After incubation at 95 °C for 10 min, the proteins in 14 μl of each sample were resolved by SDS-PAGE using 4–20% acrylamide gradient gels and stained with Coomassie Blue. A likely candidate for a Crm1 interacting nucleoporin is Nup42, based on previously reported in vivo data (50Bogerd H.P. Fridell R.A. Madore S. Cullen B.R. Cell. 1995; 82: 485-494Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar, 51Stutz F. Neville M. Rosbash M. Cell. 1995; 82: 495-506Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 52Neville M. Stutz F. Lee L. Davis L.I. Rosbash M. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 767-775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). To investigate complex formation between Crm1, Nup42, Rev, and RanGTP, we immobilized GST-Ran that contained 80–90% GTP (see “Experimental Procedures”) on glutathione beads. The final concentration of GST-RanGTP was 3 μm in these experiments. We found that Rev and Crm1 form a complex with RanGTP (Fig.1, lane 2), as has been previously described (49Askjaer P. Jensen T.H. Nilsson J. Englmeier L. Kjems J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33414-33422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). We did not detect an increase in the amount of Crm1 bound to GST-RanGTP in the presence of 1.5 μm Rev (lane 2) over the levels seen in the presence of Crm1 alone (lane 1). This result indicates that Rev does not increase the affinity of Crm1 for RanGTP if present at a concentration of 1.5 μm. If Nup42 was added together with Rev and Crm1, a Nup42/Crm1/RanGTP complex was formed (lane 3). In the presence of Nup42 the amount of Crm1 recruited to GST-RanGTP was significantly increased (compare lanes 1 and 3). However, Rev was excluded from this complex (lane 3). Nup42 did not bind to GST-RanGTP in the absence of Crm1 (lane 4). Together these results suggest that Rev is released when the Rev/Crm1/RanGTP complex binds to Nup42. We have previously used protection of RanGTP from RanGAP-induced GTP hydrolysis to measure RanGTP complex formation (24Floer M. Blobel G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5313-5316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). We therefore investigated whether the Nup42/Crm1/RanGTP complex is protected against RanGAP (Fig. 2). Preincubation of 0.5 nm RanGTP with increasing amounts of Nup42 in the presence, but not in the absence, of 1 μm Crm1 (compare Fig. 2,open circles to open squares) resulted in complete inhibition of RanGAP-stimulated GTP hydrolysis. Incubation of RanGTP with 1 μm Crm1 alone did not result in detectable levels of RanGAP inhibition (not shown). Together, the results from Fig. 1 and Fig. 2 suggest that RanGTP, Crm1, and Nup42 might form a cooperative complex. A constant for RanGTP dissociation from Nup42/Crm1/RanGTP complex is estimated to be 60 nm from these experiments. Crm1 and RanGTP were also found to form a complex with Nup159*, a fragment of the nucleoporin Nup159 containing its FG repeat region (53Kraemer D.M. Strambio-de-Castillo C. Blobel G. Rout M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19017-19021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) (closed circles). However, the affinity of this complex for RanGTP was lower, and a K D of 100 nm was estimated. These estimates reflect average dissociation constants, since the stoichiometry of the Nup42/Crm1/RanGTP or Nup159/Crm1/RanGTP complex is not known. Crm1 and RanGTP did not form a complex with the nucleoporins NSP1, Nup116, or Nup1*, a fragment of Nup1 containing its FXFG repeat region. Addition of 1 μm NSP1 (open triangles), 1 μm Nup116 (closed triangles), or 1 μm Nup1* (closed squares) in the presence of 1 μm Crm1 did not inhibit RanGAP-stimulated GTP hydrolysis. Complex formation of Crm1, RanGTP, and Nup42 was also found to inhibit GTP exchange by RanGEF (Fig. 3). In the presence of 1 μm Crm1 and increasing amounts of Nup42 GTP exchange on Ran by 20 nm RanGEF was inhibited (Fig. 3,open circles). Incubation of RanGTP with 1 μmRev and 1 μm Crm1 did not inhibit RanGAP-induced GTP hydrolysis or GTP exchange by RanGEF. 3M. Floer and G. Blobel, unpublished observations. Neither did incubation of RanGTP with 1 μm Rev, 1 μmCrm1, and increasing amounts of Nup42 further stimulate the inhibition seen in the presence of Crm1 and Nup42 (not shown). Inhibition of RanGEF-induced exchange of GTP was also seen in the presence of Crm1 and Nup159* (not shown). Together these results indicate that Crm1, RanGTP, and Nup42 or Nup159* form a complex independently of an NES-containing export substrate. How are Crm1 and RanGTP released from Nup42? Since complex formation of RanGTP with Crm1 and Nup42 results in inhibition of RanGAP-induced GTP hydrolysis, we assayed for complex disassembly by measuring release of RanGAP inhibition. Addition of the Ran-binding protein RanBP1 to the Nup42/Crm1/RanGTP complex completely restored RanGAP-induced GTP hydrolysis (Fig. 4 A). For these experiments 0.5 nm RanGTP was preincubated with 0.7 μm Crm1 and 0.25 μm Nup42. Addition of increasing amounts of RanBP1 in the presence of 15 nmRanGAP completely restored RanGAP-induced GTP hydrolysis. 50% RanGAP-induced GTP hydrolysis occurred in the presence of 0.7 nm RanBP1. The concentration of RanGTP used in this experiment is too high to allow an accurate measurement of the interaction between RanBP1 and Nup42/Crm1/RanGTP complex. However, an estimate for the free concentration of RanBP1 at 50% GTP hydrolysis of 0.2 nm is close to the K D for the RanBP1/RanGTP interaction, which has been determined to be between 0.1 and 0.6 nm for mammalian proteins (26Görlich D.

To understand further the mechanism of Crm1/RanGTP release from Nup42 by RanBP1, we investigated whether Crm1, RanGTP, and RanBP1 form a complex. For these experiments GST-RanGTP was immobilized (Fig.4 B). Addition"

The death signaling pathway of the TNFR family is well characterized, typically involving other “death domain”-containing proteins (12Nagata S. Cell. 1997; 88: 355-365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4561) Google Scholar), and is not inhibited by the anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL. These Bcl-2 family members are well characterized inhibitors of stress-induced cell death, blocking neuronal cell death in a variety of models (13Coulpier M. Junier M.P. Peschanski M. Dreyfus P.A. J.

Herein we investigate the role of the death domain and Bcl-2 family members in mediating p75NTR death signaling using microinjection technology to deliver expression plasmids into cultured neurons. We show that the p75NTR death signaling pathway is unlike the TNFR death signaling pathway as an intracellular juxta-membrane domain, and not the death domain, of p75NTR is sufficient and required to mediated death signaling. Secondly, the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members that have little influence on TNFR death signaling have profound effects on the p75NTR death pathway.

Loh, Roche, Japan) were mated to produce litters contains homozygous Bcl-2 knock-out mice. The genotypes of newborn mice were determined by polymerase chain reaction, and results were confirmed by staining of thymocytes with an anti-mouse Bcl-2 antibody (PharMingen) before dissection and microinjection of neurons isolated from individual mice of appropriate genotype. Sensory neurons were injected into the nucleus with a solution containing plasmid (100 μg/ml, with the exception of Bcl-2, which was at 50 μg/ml), tetramethylrhodamine dextran (“fluoro-ruby,” 0.15%, Molecular Probes), and phosphate-buffered saline. Where more than one plasmid was expressed in a single condition, only one injection of solution containing all plasmids was made, with the individual plasmid concentrations as specified above. Approximately 70 neurons/well were injected, with two or three wells comprising each condition. At least 2 h after completion of the injections, the number of fluoro-ruby containing cells that had survived the injection procedure was counted, and this provided the time zero 100% value for each well. Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min and then stained with an anti-rat-p75NTR antibody (MC192, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) (3Majdan M. Lachance C. Gloster A. Aloyz R. Zeindler C. Bamji S. Bhakar A. Belliveau D. Fawcett J. Miller F.D. Barker P.A. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 6988-6998Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or anti-human-Bcl-2 antibody (Bcl-2/100, (PharMingen). The plasmid containing the full-length rat p75NTR cDNA, p75NTR, is described (4Barrett G.L. Georgiou A. J. Neurosci. Res. 1996; 45: 117-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), and all p75NTR plasmids are modified versions of this original expression vector. A control plasmid, p75NTRnc (no cytoplasmic domain) is missing the entire cytoplasmic domain except the membrane anchoring Lys-274 and Arg-275. p75NTRtr is truncated with an I308A substitution followed by a stop codon, deleting the entire death domain. p75NTRΔ retains Lys-274 and Arg-275 and the last 108 amino acids creating a cytoplasmic domain including the death domain but deleted for the 33-amino acid juxta-membrane domain retained by p75NTRtr. All plasmids were constructed using polymerase chain reaction to amplify desired coding regions followed by subcloning the polymerase chain reaction products into plasmid vectors. Details of primers used in construction of these plasmids are available on request. Bcl-2 and Bcl-xLplasmids are previously described (16Huang D.C. Cory S. Strasser A. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 405-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 17Yin X.M. Oltvai Z.N. Korsmeyer S.J. Nature. 1994; 369: 321-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (1221) Google Scholar). The modified CrmA has the caspase recognition sequence modified from wild-type Leu-Glu-Ala-Asp to Asp-Gln-Met-Asp. The p75NTR death domain from Leu-342 on was cloned into pGBT9 (CLONTECH) and used to screen a C57Bl/6 P2 dorsal root ganglia neuron library cloned into the HybriZap vector (Stratagene). No death domain proteins were isolated. Interactions between the p75NTR death domain and other known death signaling proteins (FADD death domain, full-length FADD, IAP1, Trafs 1–6) cloned into pGAD10 (CLONTECH) were tested by sequential yeast transformation for growth on media selective for an interaction. To investigate whether p75NTR signals death through interaction with death domain containing proteins or via another pathway, we have activated the p75NTR pathway in a similar fashion to experiments that use ligand-free overexpression of TNFR to study apoptosis (18Boldin M.P. Mett I.L. Varfolomeev E.E. Chumakov I. Shemer-Avni Y. Camonis J.H. Wallach D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 387-391Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). We overexpressed p75NTR in neurons by microinjecting a rat p75NTR expression plasmid into the nucleus of mouse dorsal root ganglia sensory neurons (Fig. 1) and cultured them in the presence of the neural cytokine, LIF, to prevent p75NTR-independent neuronal death. These neurons were chosen because we had previously shown that their death was, at least in part, mediated by p75NTR (5Barrett G.L. Bartlett P.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6501-6505Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar, 6Cheema S.S. Barrett G.L. Bartlett P.F. J. Neurosci. Res. 1996; 46: 239-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). It was found after 16 h that approximately 20–25% of neurons injected with full-length p75NTR plasmid died (Fig.2 A), compared with neurons injected with a control β-galactosidase plasmid or a truncated p75NTR protein lacking the entire cytoplasmic domain (p75NTRnc) expressed to a similar extent. The majority of the p75NTR-mediated death was observed in the first 16 h (see Fig.3 C for example), comparable with that reported for TNFR overexpression (18Boldin M.P. Mett I.L. Varfolomeev E.E.

Chem. 1995; 270: 387-391Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar).Figure 2Effect of p75NTR overexpression on mouse sensory neuron survival. A, overexpression of p75NTR resulted in a significant (* p < 0.5) increase in neuronal cell death when compared with p75NTRnc or control β-galactosidase plasmid. Shown is a representative experiment, and from eight separate experiments there was an average increase in cell death of 21%. Neurons are cultured in the presence of survival-promoting growth factor LIF.

A, Bcl-xL and p75NTR plasmids were co-injected into neurons in the presence of LIF, and survival 16 h after injection was assessed. Bcl-xL was able to totally rescue neurons from p75NTR-mediated cell death. Note also that neurons injected with Bcl-xL had increased survival compared with Fig. 2 A. B, although the survival of neurons in the presence of LIF was not affected by expression of Bcl-2 plasmid alone (compare with Fig. 2 A), in combination with p75NTR there was a significant increase in cell death. The ability of Bcl-2 to promote cell death because of full-length p75NTR is not seen in the presence of p75NTRnc. C, Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL have opposite effects on the p75NTR-mediated killing within the first 16 h after injection. D, microinjection of either p75NTR alone or p75NTR and Bcl-2 constructs failed to increase neuronal death in the presence of NGF. E, death induced by withdrawal of NGF is inhibited by expression of the microinjected Bcl-2 plasmid. ●, uninjected and, ▪, Bcl-2-injected neurons in NGF; ○, uninjected and, ▵, Bcl-2-injected neurons after factor withdrawal. *,p < 0.05; ** p < 0.01; ***p < 0.001; error bars indicate S.E.,n = 3.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Because the cytoplasmic tail of p75NTR is required for the cytotoxic effect, we next examined whether deletion of the death domain also abolished the ability of p75NTR to kill. Surprisingly, the neuronal death observed after expression of p75NTR with a truncated cytoplasmic tail (p75NTRtr), lacking the death domain, was not significantly different from that observed with full-length p75NTR (Fig.2 B). Furthermore, a deletion p75NTR protein (p75NTRΔ), containing the death domain but deleted for the juxta-membrane portion, did not induce significant death (Fig. 2 B). Thus, the death domain was not required for p75NTR killing, and the juxta-membrane cytoplasmic tail is necessary and sufficient for killing. The p75NTR death domain has recently been shown to have a different tertiary structure to the death domain of the TNFR family and does not self-associate in vitro (19Liepinsh E. Ilag L.L. Otting G. Ibanez C.F. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4999-5005Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar), supporting the finding that the p75NTR death domain does not function to induce death. Using the yeast two-hybrid method to find p75NTR death domain binding partners, we found no evidence of specific interaction with other death domain-containing proteins (see “Materials and Methods”). Together, these results suggest that an alternative pathway to one involving death domain adapter proteins, such as TRADD and FADD, may be responsible for p75NTR-mediated killing. To further explore whether p75NTR killing was different from TNFR killing pathways, we examined whether overexpression of the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins could inhibit killing by p75NTR. Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL are well characterized inhibitors of growth factor withdrawal and stress-induced apoptosis (15Merry D.E. Korsmeyer S.J. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1997; 20: 245-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar). However, both proteins are poor inhibitors of CD95/Apo1/Fas and TNFR-mediated apoptosis (20Erhardt P. Cooper G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17601-17604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 21Strasser A. Harris A.W. Huang D.C. Krammer P.H. Cory S. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 6136-6147Crossref PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar). We found that overexpression of Bcl-xL protected neurons against p75NTR-induced death (Fig. 3 A), supporting the hypothesis that p75NTR signals through an alternative pathway to TNFR-induced apoptosis. Whereas Bcl-2 overexpression alone had no effect on cell survival in the presence of LIF (Fig. 3 B), Bcl-2 in combination with p75NTR overexpression, surprisingly, enhanced the neuronal death seen with p75NTR overexpression alone, yet in combination with p75NTRnc it had no effect (Fig. 3 B). The results are surprising because Bcl-2 is functionally indistinguishable from Bcl-xL in most cell-death systems (16Huang D.C. Cory S. Strasser A. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 405-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 22Huang D.C. Adams J.M. Cory S. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1029-1039Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar), yet in this assay we find that they have opposite effects (Fig.3 C). The cell death observed with p75NTR and Bcl-2 overexpression was totally ablated if the cells were cultured in NGF, confirming that signaling though trk may inhibit p75NTR activity (Fig. 3 D). Bcl-2 was able to protect against neuronal death induced by NGF withdrawal (Fig. 3 E). Thus, at the same expression levels in the same neuronal population, Bcl-2 was able to inhibit or enhance neuronal cell death depending on the nature of the death signal. To determine whether the paradoxical effect of Bcl-2 on p75NTR-induced killing was related to its known anti-apoptotic activity, inactive Bcl-2 mutants were utilized (17Yin X.M. Oltvai Z.N. Korsmeyer S.J. Nature. 1994; 369: 321-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (1221) Google Scholar). Like wild-type Bcl-2, expression of the Bcl-2 mutants did not affect neuronal survival. In combination with p75NTR expression, the enhanced killing effect seen with Bcl-2 co-expression was abrogated by expression of the mutant G145E Bcl-2, suggesting the protein was nonfunctional (Fig.4 A). Thus, an intact BH1 homology region is required for both the survival and death promoting activities of Bcl-2. Using a W188A mutated Bcl-2, we found that co-expression with p75NTR not only abolished the increased p75NTR killing but, more importantly, protected neurons from any p75NTR-induced death (Fig. 4 B), reminiscent of that seen with Bcl-xL, despite being unable to protect against growth factor withdrawal-induced death (17Yin X.M. Oltvai Z.N. Korsmeyer S.J. Nature. 1994; 369: 321-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (1221) Google Scholar). Thus, the mechanism by which Bcl-2 participates in the death pathway is separable from its function in the survival pathway. Bcl-2 has previously been observed to increase cell death when highly expressed both in vitro and in vivo (23Chen J. Flannery J.G. LaVail M.M. Steinberg R.H. Xu J. Simon M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7042-7047Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 24.Bernard, O., Farlie, P., Bernard, R., Frontiers of Spinal Cord Research Conference, 1996, Walter and Eliza Hall Institute, Parkville, Australia.Google Scholar, 25Uhlmann E.J. Subramanian T. Vater C.A. Lutz R. Chinnadurai G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17926-17932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that the high level of Bcl-2 is able to “prime” the death pathway such that an apoptotic stimulus via p75NTR results in rapid cell death. We examined whether Bcl-2 may not only enhance p75NTR killing but may be essential for p75NTR killing to proceed by testing whether lowering endogenous Bcl-2 would inhibit p75NTR-mediated killing. We used a Bcl-2 antisense plasmid, which has previously been shown to effectively lower Bcl-2 expression after microinjection into neurons (26Allsopp T.E. Wyatt S. Paterson H.F. Davies A.M. Cell. 1993; 73: 295-307Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar, 27Allsopp T.E. Kiselev S. Wyatt S. Davies A.M. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1995; 7: 1266-1272Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). When the Bcl-2 antisense plasmid was injected at the same time as the p75NTR plasmid, no diminution of the death signal was seen. If, however, the neurons were microinjected in the presence of NGF, to give time for the antisense to deplete endogenous Bcl-2, and then switched into LIF the next day to permit p75NTR killing, there was a significant decrease in the ability of p75NTR to kill neurons with lowered Bcl-2 (Fig.5 A); in fact, the level of killing was not significantly different from that of neurons expressing p75NTRnc (Fig. 5 A). The specificity of the Bcl-2 antisense was demonstrated by its inability to affect neuronal survival when expressed alone or in conjunction with p75NTRnc (data not shown). In addition, a control vector expressing green fluorescent protein had no affect on p75NTR killing (data not shown). The requirement for endogenous Bcl-2 for p75NTR killing was also demonstrated in neurons from newborn mice lacking Bcl-2, which showed a significant reduction in cell death induced by p75NTR compared with wild-type litter mates (Fig. 5 B), supportive of the Bcl-2 antisense experiments. To investigate whether the p75NTR-Bcl-2 death-signaling cascade was dependent on caspase activation, a modified CrmA, designed to inhibit downstream group II caspases, such as caspase 3 (28Ekert P.G. Silke J. Vaux D.L. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 330-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 29Thornberry N.A. Rano T.A. Peterson E.P. Rasper D.M. Timkey T. Garcia-Calvo M. Houtzager V.M. Nordstrom P.A.

Chem. 1997; 272: 17907-17911Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1852) Google Scholar), was overexpressed together with p75NTR. The modified CrmA was able to block the killing induced either by p75NTR alone or by co-expression of p75NTR and Bcl-2 in wild-type neurons (Fig. 5 C), suggesting that p75NTR-Bcl-2-induced apoptosis utilizes a caspase-dependent pathway. Bcl-2 has been shown to be cleaved by caspases, with the cleavage product being capable of promoting apoptosis in vitro (30Cheng E.H. Kirsch D.G. Clem R.J. Ravi R. Kastan M.B. Bedi A. Ueno K. Hardwick J.M. Science. 1997; 278: 1966-1968Crossref PubMed Scopus (1005) Google Scholar). Cleavage of Bcl-2 may occur in our system but the mutated Bcl-2 proteins would be similarly cleaved, arguing that cleavage of Bcl-2 is unlikely to be the dominant mechanism by which Bcl-2 promotes killing in our system. In addition, if caspase cleavage was the dominant mechanism, Bcl-xL might also be expected to promote death in our system as Bcl-xL has been shown to be cleaved in a similar way (31Clem R.J. Cheng E.H. Karp C.L. Kirsch D.G. Ueno K. Takahashi A. Kastan M.B. Griffin D.E. Earnshaw W.C. Veliuona M.A. Hardwick J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 554-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL are likely to have a very similar tertiary structure based on sequence similarity. The NMR structure of Bcl-xL has been determined, showing a hydrophobic cleft formed by seven α helixes where other Bcl-2 family proteins interact (32Muchmore S.W. Sattler M. Liang H. Meadows R.P. Harlan J.E. Yoon H.S. Nettesheim D. Chang B.S. Thompson C.B. Wong S.L. Ng S.L. Fesik S.W. Nature. 1996; 381: 335-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (1289) Google Scholar). Bcl-xL, and Bcl-2, may function differently by specific interaction with proteins that mediate p75NTR-induced death. For example, pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members, Bak and Bad, interact strongly with Bcl-xL but weakly with Bcl-2 (33Chittenden T. Flemington C. Houghton A.B. Ebb R.G. Gallo G.J. Elangovan B. Chinnadurai G. Lutz R.J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5589-5596Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar, 34Yang E. Zha J. Jockel J. Boise L.H. Thompson C.B. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 285-291Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1897) Google Scholar). Also, Bcl-xL, but not Bcl-2 as yet, has been shown to interact with Apaf-1, the mammalian CED-4 homologue, to regulate apoptosis via caspase-9 activation (35Pan G. O'Rourke K. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5841-5845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). Mutation of Bcl-2 at Gly-145 or Trp-188 may affect its interaction with pro- and anti-apoptotic proteins by conformational changes disrupting access to the cleft. This suggests that the conformation of the Bcl-2 protein is integral to the paradoxical functions observed herein and that Bcl-2 participates in the p75NTR-killing pathway and stress-induced survival by different molecular mechanisms. The different neuronal phenotype observed in Bcl-2- and Bcl-xL-deficient animals is consistent with our results that Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL can have quite different functions in regulating neuronal death. Mice deficient for Bcl-xL have a major loss of neurons shortly after their differentiation (36Motoyama N. Wang F. Roth K.A. Sawa H. Nakayama K. Nakayama K. Negishi I. Senju S. Zhang Q. Fujii S. et al.Science. 1995; 267: 1506-1510Crossref PubMed Scopus (1026) Google Scholar), whereas Bcl-2-deficient mice show only minor loss of neurons during embryogenesis and early neonatal life (37Deckwerth T.L. Elliott J.L. Knudson C.M. Johnson Jr., E.M. Snider W.D. Korsmeyer S.J. Neuron. 1996; 17: 401-411Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar). The latter phenotype would support the idea that during development Bcl-2 plays two contrasting roles: under conditions where there are appropriate neuritic connections leading to trk signaling, Bcl-2 may act to enhance neuronal survival, as has been shown for trigeminal sensory neurons in vitro (26Allsopp T.E. Wyatt S. Paterson H.F. Davies A.M. Cell. 1993; 73: 295-307Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar, 27Allsopp T.E. Kiselev S. Wyatt S. Davies A.M. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1995; 7: 1266-1272Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar); alternatively, as observed, Bcl-2 may also be capable of promoting neuronal death at other stages, for example when neurons may become more dependent on neural cytokine (e.g. LIF, CNTF, OsM) support in early postnatal development (38Kotzbauer P.T. Lampe P.A. Estus S. Milbrandt J. Johnson Jr., E.M. Neuron. 1994; 12: 763-773Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 39Murphy M. Reid K. Brown M.A. Bartlett P.F. Development. 1993; 117: 1173-1182PubMed Google Scholar). The LIF family signal through Janus tyrosine kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK/STAT) pathways, which can be inhibited by the neurotrophin-activated mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase pathway (40Ihara S. Nakajima K. Fukada T. Hibi M. Nagata S. Hirano T. Fukui Y. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5345-5352Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that the in vivo switch of neuron dependence between neurotrophins and neural cytokines may prime the neurons to cell death. Activation of p75NTR then may occur through NGF or BDNF signaling as has been recently shown (10Bamji S.X. Majdan M. Pozniak C.D. Belliveau D.J. Aloyz R. Kohn J. Causing C.G. Miller F.D. J.

The apparent paradoxical actions of Bcl-2 may be a program by which rapid selection of cell survival or death occurs during neuronal development and after nerve injury. There are high levels of Bcl-2 in neurons of both the central and peripheral nervous systems during periods of developmental cell death (42Merry D.E. Veis D.J. Hickey W.F. Korsmeyer S.J. Development. 1994; 120: 301-311Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and activation of p75NTR, also expressed widely in the nervous system during development, in the presence of high Bcl-2, would lead to rapid apoptosis.

Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 917-923PubMed Google Scholar). Growth-promoting effects of somatostatin have also been described in vitro on human pancreatic carcinoid (12Ishizuka J. Beauchamp R.D. Evers B.M. Townsend C.M. Thompson J.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 185: 577-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) and epidermoid carcinoma cells (13Kamiya Y. Ohmura E. Arai M. Fuji T.

As part of a study to resolve some of the apparent conflicting actions of somatostatin on cell proliferation and to identify the receptor types involved, clonal lines have been established expressing the individual human recombinant forms in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) 1The abbreviations used are: CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; bFGF, basic fibroblast growth factor; MAP, mitogen-activated protein; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; MEK, MAP/ERK kinase; STAT, signal transducer and activator of transcription; JAK, Janus kinase. 1The abbreviations used are: CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; bFGF, basic fibroblast growth factor; MAP, mitogen-activated protein; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; MEK, MAP/ERK kinase; STAT, signal transducer and activator of transcription; JAK, Janus kinase. cells. Using a well characterized in vitro model, changes in cellular proliferation on the application of test substances have been assessed by determining regeneration into denuded areas of a previously confluent monolayer as well as by direct cell counting after a 24-h recovery period (15Lauder H. Frost E.E. Hiley C.R. Fan T.-P.D. Angiogenesis. 1998; 2: 67-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Both the activated human recombinant sst2 (16Alderton F. Lauder H. Feniuk W. Fan T.-P.D. Humphrey P.P.A. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1998; 124: 323-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) and sst5 receptors (7Lauder H. Sellers L.A. Fan T.-P.D. Feniuk W. Humphrey P.P.A. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1997; 122: 663-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) in this model have been shown to have no effect on basal proliferation in the absence of exogenously added mitogenic agents, but they can inhibit that induced by a submaximal concentration of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF). This is in agreement with earlier studies demonstrating a reduced cell count after the application of the somatostatin analog RC-160 to complete media in cell lines expressing either the mouse sst2 or the sst5 receptor type (17Buscail L. Estève J.-P. Saint-Laurent N. Bertrand V. Reisine T. O'Carroll A.-M. Bell G.I. Schally A.V. Vaysse N. Susini C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1580-1584Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). By contrast, preliminary studies employing the regeneration model have shown somatostatin to stimulate basal proliferation in cells expressing the human recombinant sst4 receptor in the absence of other mitogenic agents (18Lauder H. Sellers L.A. Feniuk W. Humphrey P.P.A. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1998; 123 (abstr.): 126Google Scholar). The existence of different somatostatin receptors suggests that their functional responses may be mediated by a variety of effector systems. Although this aspect is not yet fully clarified, so far all five human receptors have been shown to be functionally coupled to inhibition of adenylate cyclase (19Patel Y.C. Greenwood M.T. Warszynska A. Panetta R. Srikant C.B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 198: 605-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar) and mediate, albeit to different degrees, the stimulation of phospholipase C with subsequent calcium mobilization (20Akbar M. Okajima F. Tomura H. Majid M.A. Yamada Y. Seino S. Kondo Y. FEBS Lett. 1994; 348: 192-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). However, it is difficult to explain the specificity and diversity of the responses to somatostatin through the apparently similar modulation and subsequent actions of a small number of second messengers. The mechanism involved in transmission of the antiproliferative effect of the sst2 receptor has been attributed to the activation of a protein tyrosine phosphatase, SHP-1 (21Lopez F. Estève J.-P. Buscail L. Delesque N. Saint-Laurent N. Theveniau M. Nahmias C. Vaysse N. Susini C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24448-24454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), and it has been suggested that such an activity may counteract the growth-promoting properties of receptors containing an intrinsic tyrosine kinase domain (22Pan M.G. Florio T. Stork P.J.S. Science. 1992; 256: 1215-1217Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Activation of the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase cascade has been demonstrated after stimulation of sst4 receptors (23Bito H. Mori M. Sakanaka C. Takano T. Honda Z. Gotoh Y. Nishida E. Shimizu T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12722-12730Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which is an important transduction mechanism utilized by many growth factor receptors, although increasing evidence suggests that the outcome of the receptor's signal depends both on the duration of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) activation and cell context (24Marshall C.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 179-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4225) Google Scholar, 25Kerkhoff E. Rapp U.R. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 1636-1640PubMed Google Scholar). A critical aspect of cell phenotype will be which ERK-responsive transcription factors are present. A number of transcription factors have been identified as targets for MAP kinase, which enters the nucleus after phosphorylation by MAP/ERK kinase (MEK) (26Marshall C.J. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1994; 4: 82-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (897) Google Scholar). The Ras/ERK pathway provides a common route by which signals from different growth-inducing receptors converge at a major regulatory element of the promoters of the c-fos and other coregulated genes, the serum response element. The major targets for the pathway in the c-fos promoter are the ternary complex factor family members, Elk1 and SAP1, whose activity is regulated by phosphorylation of a cluster of Ser/Thr-Pro motifs (Ser383 and Ser389 of Elk1) at their COOH termini (27Treisman R. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1994; 4: 96-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar). Another potential substrate for MAP kinase, belonging to a very different family of transcription factors, is signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3). The STAT proteins are involved in the transcriptional attenuation of many cytokine- and growth factor-inducible genes, and, prior to receptor activation, they appear to be cytoplasmic (28Schindler C. Shuai K. Prezioso V.R. Darnell J.E. Science. 1992; 257: 809-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (720) Google Scholar). They at least associate transiently with their cognate receptors during activation; after phosphorylation at a conserved tyrosine, which allows dimerization through reciprocal phosphotyrosine-SH2 domain interactions, they translocate to the nucleus and bind the cis-inducible element found in the promoter of the c-fos gene. STAT activation by receptors lacking intrinsic kinase activity, including G protein-coupled receptors (29Marrero M.B. Schieffer B. Paxton W.G. Heerdt L. Berk B.C. Delafontaine P. Bernstein K.E. Nature. 1995; 375: 247-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar), involves specific members of the Janus kinase (JAK) family (30Darnell J.E. Science. 1997; 277: 1630-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (3356) Google Scholar). However, STAT3 is also phosphorylated by a serine/threonine kinase thought to be MAP kinase which enhances its transcriptional activity (31Wen Z. Zong Z. Darnell J.E. Cell. 1995; 82: 241-250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1735) Google Scholar). The purpose of this study was to investigate the transduction mechanism mediating the proliferative action of somatostatin through stimulation of the human sst4 receptor and to compare the effects with those induced by the somatostatin analog L-362,855, which displays full agonist activity at this receptor type (32Smalley K.S.M. Feniuk W. Humphrey P.P.A. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1998; 125: 833-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In particular, the kinetics of the phosphorylation of ERK1 and ERK2 were monitored throughout the initial period of proliferation and compared with responses induced by bFGF. In addition, correlation between any late phase MAP kinase activity and induced phosphorylation of Elk1 or STAT3 was also determined. Chinese hamster ovary (CHO-K1) cells were obtained from The European Collection of Animal Cell Cultures (ECACC). LipofectAMINE, Geneticin (G418 sulfate, specific activity 500 μg/ml), and reagents for culturing cells were obtained from Life Technologies. Thermanox coverslips, manufactured by Nunc, were purchased through Life Technologies, otherwise Costar tissue culture plastic ware was used. bFGF and monoclonal antibodies to β-actin were obtained from Sigma. Somatostatin and L-362,855 were synthesized by the GlaxoWellcome Chemistry Unit, Department of Chemistry, University of Cambridge, U. K. PD 98059 (2′-amino-3′-methoxyflavone) and Bordetella pertussis toxin were from Calbiochem. Antibodies to ERK1 (C-16) and ERK2 (C-14) were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology; that specific to the phosphoforms (at both Thr202 and Tyr204) was supplied by New England Biolabs. Phosphospecific STAT3 antibodies recognizing either the serine (Ser727) or the tyrosine phosphorylation sites (Tyr705) and that to the phosphorylated form of Elk1 (Ser383) were also obtained from New England Biolabs. Antibodies to these transcription factors but whose specificity is independent of the phosphorylation state were supplied by Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The cDNA encoding the human sst4 receptor was subcloned into the mammalian expression vector pCIN4 harboring a neomycin-resistant gene as a selection marker. CHO-K1 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 medium (1:1) containing 10% fetal calf serum and 1 mm Glutamax I and transfected in the absence of serum with 10 μg of sst4-pCIN4 using a cationic liposome formulation-mediated transfer (LipofectAMINE). Selection was performed in the presence of complete medium containing 1 mg/ml G418 sulfate, and clonal cell lines expressing the cDNA were isolated by single cell cloning. Receptor expression was assessed by binding of125I-Tyr11-somatostatin. The transfected cell line expressing the human recombinant sst4 receptor (CHOsst4) used in the current study gave IC50values for somatostatin binding of 0.33 ± 0.06 nmwith the corresponding B max value being 2.07 ± 0.43 pmol/mg of membrane protein (n = 3). All cultures were routinely maintained in their appropriate growth medium at 37 °C in humidified air containing 5% carbon dioxide and passaged when 95% confluence was reached. Cells were grown to confluence in complete media on Thermanox coverslips. Proliferation was assessed by determining the regeneration of multiple denuded areas (400 μm wide), created by dragging a Perspex comb across the surface of the coverslip, according to the method described previously (7Lauder H. Sellers L.A. Fan T.-P.D. Feniuk W. Humphrey P.P.A. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1997; 122: 663-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The Perspex comb was designed so that 50% of the confluent monolayer was removed by the partial denudation process, leaving parallel strips of cells. Importantly, for CHO-K1 cells, it has been demonstrated previously that repopulation of the denuded areas in the presence of bFGF for 24 h is associated with a concomitant increase in cell number, abolished by protein synthesis inhibitors and independent of motorgenic processes (7Lauder H. Sellers L.A. Fan T.-P.D. Feniuk W. Humphrey P.P.A. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1997; 122: 663-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar,15Lauder H. Frost E.E. Hiley C.R. Fan T.-P.D. Angiogenesis. 1998; 2: 67-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). After partial denudation, coverslips were washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline and placed in a fresh well containing drug or vehicle in appropriate media but in the absence of fetal calf serum. Regeneration of the cell monolayer was terminated after 24 h by rapid washing in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline followed by fixing in absolute ethanol. Regeneration of the denuded areas was quantified using a Leica Q500 MC image analysis system. Image analysis has revealed that regeneration occurs by an outgrowth of CHO-K1 cells along the perimeter of the denuded areas with an insignificant number of cells becoming detached from the coverslip at any time point during the investigative period (15Lauder H. Frost E.E. Hiley C.R. Fan T.-P.D. Angiogenesis. 1998; 2: 67-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). For each coverslip, four fields of view selected at random were analyzed, and data are expressed as a percentage of the denuded area recovered. All results were calculated from a minimum of three experiments with four replicates per test group; values are expressed as the arithmetic mean ± S.E. Statistical analysis was by analysis of variance followed by Tukey's test, taking p < 0.05 as the level of significance (SigmaStat® version 2.0). The EC50 values were calculated by interpolation from the concentration-effect curves plotted and are defined as the concentration of drug which produced half its maximal possible response. To analyze changes in the phosphorylation status of ERK1 and ERK2 and the transcription factors STAT3 and Elk1 at various stages during the regenerative processes after partial denudation, whole cell protein extract was combined from eight coverslips for each treatment group. Immediately before partial denudation, cells forming the confluent monolayers of CHOsst4 cells were in either the G0 or early G1 phase of the cell cycle. Producing multiple denuded areas on a single coverslip dramatically increases the number of cells recruited into the regenerative process and amplifies the resultant biochemical signals. For endothelial cells, it has been shown that after denudation, at least 10 cells adjacent to the denuded edge respond to this process. Subsequent analysis of changes induced in the phosphorylation state of effector proteins involved in basal or growth factor-stimulated regeneration for CHO-K1 cells will thus reflect those of a large synchronized, proliferating cell population as well as from a small, contact-inhibited subpopulation localized in the central regions of the confluent strips. Application of bFGF to nondenuded, confluent CHO-K1 monolayers has very little effect on the phosphorylation status of ERK1 or ERK2, a weak transient increase in phosphorylation between 10 and 20 min after application. 2L. A. Sellers, W. Feniuk, P. P. A. Humphrey, and H. Lauder, unpublished observations. Regeneration was terminated by washing the CHOsst4 cell monolayers in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline before applying SDS-polyacrylamide gel sample buffer (50 μl of 3 × strength) to each test well (1 × sample buffer: 4% SDS, 5% glycerol, 60 mm Tris, pH 6.8, and 0.01% bromphenol blue) under reducing conditions (50 mm 2-mercaptoethanol). After solubilization of cellular protein by rapid mixing, the well contents were transferred to a separate tube and combined with two further washings of the well with deionized water (50 μl). Samples were vortexed, centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 2 min, and heated at 95 °C for 5 min. Total cell protein for each of the extracts was measured by microBCA (Pierce), and equivalent amounts of protein were resolved electrophoretically on 10% polyacrylamide gels. After electrophoretic transfer onto nitrocellulose (0.22 μm) using a semidry blotter, the membrane was washed briefly in Tris-buffered saline (TBS: 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 250 mm NaCl) and saturated overnight in TBS supplemented with 0.1% Tween 20 and 5% dried milk. For detection with the antibodies to ERK1 and ERK2, the membranes were incubated with a 1:2,000 dilution (1:1 mix of ERK1 and 2) or 1:1,000 dilution of the anti-phospho-ERK antibody. Antibodies to the phosphospecific forms of the transcription factors were used at a 1:500 dilution, whereas those to STAT3 and Elk1 were at a 1:1,000 dilution. When used, the antibody to β-actin was at a 1:5,000 dilution. All primary incubations were for 1 h at 22 °C in TBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 (TBST) followed by washing five times for 10 min each in TBST. Membranes were incubated for 1 h at 22 °C with a 1:5,000 dilution of the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody in TBST containing 5% dried milk. Excess antibody was removed by washing as above, and immunocomplexes were visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) detection, according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The Western blots shown are representative of at least three separate experiments, and each panel is taken from a single immunoblot. Using the in vitro model to determine changes in proliferation of CHOsst4 cells, the basal rate of regeneration in incomplete media, 24 h after partial denudation of a previously confluent monolayer, was 7.1 ± 0.4%. Application of somatostatin caused a concentration-dependent increase in the proliferation of these cells (Fig. 1) with its potency, expressed as an EC50 value, estimated at 19.9 ± 0.3 nm. The synthetic peptide, L-362,855, showed some agonist activity, producing concentration-dependent increases in the regeneration of CHOsst4 cells with an EC50of 63.1 ± 0.8 nm, but the maximal response (10.0 ± 0.1%) was greatly suppressed compared with that induced by somatostatin (24.1 ± 0.2%) and was only just significantly different from basal values (p = 0.045) (Fig. 1). The concentration-effect curve for bFGF reached a maximal response similar to that produced by somatostatin (Fig. 1) but was at least 300-fold more potent (EC50 0.05 ± 0.004 nm). In all further experiments, submaximal concentrations of bFGF and somatostatin were used at 10 ng/ml (0.6 nm) and 100 nm, respectively, which gave approximately equivalent amounts of regeneration (80% of the maxima). Two concentrations of L-362,855 were used: L-362,8551 at 100 nm and L-362,8552 at 1 μm. Pretreatment for 20 h with pertussis toxin (100 ng/ml) had no significant effect on either basal proliferation of CHOsst4 cells (6.9 ± 0.2%) or that induced by bFGF (10 ng/ml) treatment (22.5 ± 0.2% and 22.7 ± 0.4% with or without pertussis toxin, respectively). However, the increased proliferation evoked by application of somatostatin (100 nm) was abolished after pretreatment with the toxin to values not significantly different from basal (7.6 ± 0.5% and 21.6 ± 0.5% with or without toxin treatment, respectively). The increased proliferation of CHOsst4 cells in the presence of L-362,8552 (1 μm) also decreased after pertussis toxin pretreatment, again to values not significantly different from basal (6.8 ± 0.6% and 9.3 ± 0.2% with and without pertussis toxin, respectively). The inhibitor of MEK1, PD 98059 (2 μm), had no significant effect on the basal proliferation of CHOsst4cells (7.3 ± 0.4%) but abolished that elicited by the application of somatostatin (100 nm) from 21.2 ± 0.6% to 7.1 ± 0.6%. Proliferation induced by bFGF (10 ng/ml) was only partially blocked by PD 98059 treatment (from 21.9 ± 0.4% to 15.1 ± 0.7%). The small proliferative effect of L-362,8552 (1 μm) was also blocked by coincubation with PD 98059 (7.3 ± 0.7% and 9.2 ± 0.3% with and without PD 98059, respectively). Activation of MAP kinase during the initial processes involved in the proliferative response of CHOsst4 cells was assessed by monitoring changes in the phosphorylation status of ERK1 and ERK2. A time course of the immunoreactivity detected with the anti-phospho-ERK1 and ERK2 antibody by Western analysis of whole cell extracts of CHOsst4 cells over the initial 4 h of regeneration is shown in Fig. 2. During this period, there was no detectable change in the expression of ERK1 or ERK2 protein in CHOsst4 cells (Fig. 2 A), and this level was not affected by any drug treatment (data not shown). Proliferation under basal conditions produced little apparent change in the phosphorylation of ERK1 and ERK2 during the initial 10 min compared with levels detected in confluent monolayers prior to denudation (Fig.2 B). However, this apparent “steady state” of phosphorylation decreased over the next 20 min to almost undetectable levels by 30 min (Fig. 2 B). Proliferation in the presence of somatostatin (100 nm), L-362,8551 (100 nm), or bFGF (10 ng/ml) produced a marked increase in the phosphorylated forms of both ERK1 and ERK2 compared with predenudation levels (Fig. 2 B). The increase in the phosphorylation induced by L-362,8551 reached a peak after recovery for 20 min but diminished to undetectable levels by 1 h. In contrast, somatostatin treatment evoked a maximal response at 10 min, and although this level subsequently declined, that observed at 4 h postdenudation was substantially increased over basal (Fig.2 B). The phosphorylation of ERK1 and ERK2 in the presence of bFGF appeared biphasic in that a transient increase occurred at 10 min with a second peak following at 4 h postdenudation, although a persistent increase in the immunoreactivity over basal levels was observed throughout the entire time course (Fig. 2, B andC). The intensity of the immunoreactivity detected with the anti-phospho-ERK1 and ERK2 antibody was strongest after somatostatin (100 nm) treatment for 10 min or bFGF (10 ng/ml) treatment for 4 h (Fig. 2 C). The level of phosphorylation after regeneration in somatostatin (100 nm) or a high concentration of L-362,8552 (1 μm) for 20 min was comparable (Fig. 2 C). The level of phosphorylation observed after a 2- or 4-h incubation period with L-362,8552 was considerably lower for both ERK1 and ERK2 compared with that induced by somatostatin and comparable to that detected for samples allowed to recover for these same times under basal conditions (Fig. 2 C). Activation of the transcription factors STAT3 and Elk1 is associated with phosphorylation on serine residues Ser727(33Zhang X. Blenis J. Li H.C. Schindler C. Chen-Kiang S. Science. 1995; 267: 1990-1994Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar) and Ser383 (27Treisman R. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1994; 4: 96-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar), respectively. A time course of the immunoreactivity detected with anti-STAT3 or anti-Elk1 antibodies showed that the expression of these transcription factors remained unchanged during the early basal regenerative processes of partially denuded CHOsst4 cell monolayers (Fig.3 A). The expression of STAT3 and Elk1 was also unaffected by incubation with any of the drug treatments during this initial 4-h period (data not shown). Under basal conditions, regeneration was associated with a small increase in the serine phosphorylation of both STAT3 and Elk1 as demonstrated by the enhanced immunoreactivity compared with samples prepared immediately after denudation, together with a concomitant electrophoretic mobility shift of the proteins (Fig. 3 B). Recovery in the presence of somatostatin (100 nm) increased the phosphorylation on Ser727 of STAT3, producing two peaks: one at 20 min and a second at 4 h (Fig. 3 B). Somatostatin treatment, however, appeared to have no effect on the basal level of phosphorylation of Elk1. Recovery in the presence of L-362,8551 (100 nm) produced little change in the intensity of the immunoreactivity detected by the anti-phosphospecific antibodies to either transcr"
https://openalex.org/W1982153482,"In situ hybridization analysis demonstrated that abundant testicular orphan receptor (TR4) transcripts were detected in kidney, intestine, and bone, which are vitamin D3 target organs. Cell transfection studies also demonstrated that the expression of the vitamin D3 target gene, 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 24-hydroxylase, can be repressed by TR4 through high affinity binding (K d = 1.32 nm) to the direct repeat 3 vitamin D3 receptor response element (DR3VDRE). This TR4-mediated repression of DR3VDRE is in contrast to our earlier report that TR4 could induce thyroid hormone target genes containing a direct repeat 4 thyroid hormone response element (DR4T3RE). Electrophoretic mobility shift assay using several TR4 monoclonal antibodies when combined with either TR4-DR3VDRE or TR4-DR4T3RE showed a distinct supershifted pattern, and proteolytic analysis further demonstrated distinct digested peptides with either TR4-DR3VDRE or TR4-DR4T3RE. These results may therefore suggest that TR4 can adapt to different conformations once bound to DR3VDRE or DR4T3RE. The consequence of these different conformations of TR4-DR3VDRE and TR4-DR4T3RE may allow each of them to recruit different coregulators. The differential repression of TR4-mediated DR3VDRE and DR4T3RE transactivation by the receptor interacting protein 140, a TR4 coregulator, further strengthens our hypothesis that the specificity of gene regulation by TR4 can be modulated by protein-DNA and protein-protein interactions.

Understanding the crosstalk between steroid hormone-dependent and -independent signaling pathways is critical for gaining further insight into the integration of cellular regulatory cues that modulate development and tissue-specific gene expression. The biological effects of steroids and related hormones, including derivatives of vitamins A and D3, are mediated through their cognate receptors (1Evans R.M.

These receptors are members of a large group of ligand-activated proteins that act as transcriptional activators or repressors. However, there is another group of nuclear receptors that shares the same molecular structure as steroid hormone receptors but has no known ligands. The members of this group have therefore been named orphan receptors (5O'Malley B.W. Conneely O.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 1359-1361Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). A common characteristic of many of these orphan receptors is that they exert at least part of their function as regulators of other receptors. This may occur by several different mechanisms: competition for the same response element, heterodimer formation with the regulated receptor, or heterodimer formation with the retinoid X receptor (RXR), 1The abbreviations used are: RXR, retinoid X receptor; TR4, testicular orphan receptor; HRE, hormone response elements; VDRE, vitamin D response element; GST, glutathioneS-transferase; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; mAb, monoclonal antibody; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase; DR, direct repeat; VDR, vitamin D3 receptor; T3RE, thyroid response element; RIP140, receptor interacting protein 140; T3R, thyroid receptor. 1The abbreviations used are: RXR, retinoid X receptor; TR4, testicular orphan receptor; HRE, hormone response elements; VDRE, vitamin D response element; GST, glutathioneS-transferase; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; mAb, monoclonal antibody; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase; DR, direct repeat; VDR, vitamin D3 receptor; T3RE, thyroid response element; RIP140, receptor interacting protein 140; T3R, thyroid receptor. thus titrating out available RXR protein.

On the basis of sequence similarities, TR4 is classified as a member of the steroid hormone receptor superfamily, very close to the TR2 orphan receptor (9Chang C. Kokontis J. Acakpo-Satchivi L.

Molecular mechanisms of the differential regulation by TR4 remain unclear. Determining whether TR4 is capable of interfering with gene regulation by binding to other AGGTCA-like motifs and/or interacting with cofactor(s) might provide us more detailed information about this orphan receptor. A vitamin D3 target gene is a potential candidate of interest for more study, because its receptor functions through interaction with the vitamin D3 response element, which contains two AGGTCA repeat motifs with a 3-nucleotide space between repeats (DR3-VDRE). These response element motifs may also be recognized by TR4. Despite the similarity of hormone response elements (HRE) recognized by both VDR and TR4, these two receptors have also been found to interact in vitro with the receptor interacting protein 140 (RIP140) cofactor (18Masuyama H. Brownfiled C.M. St-Arnaud R. MacDonald P.N. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 1507-1517Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 19Yan Z.H. Karam W.G. Staudinger J.L. Medvedev A. Ghanayem B.J.

Investigating the regulation of TR4 in the vitamin D signaling pathway provides us with a molecular mechanism to explain the way TR4 regulates the gene expression in terms of protein-DNA and protein-protein interactions.Vitamin D3 is hydroxylated first in the liver at carbon 25 to yield 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 and then in the kidney at the α-position of carbon 1 to generate 1,25-(OH)2D3, the active form of vitamin D. This has various biological effects, including the maintenance of calcium homeostasis, regulation of bone remodeling, and modulation of cell growth and differentiation (20Haussler M.R. Mangelsdorf D.J. Komm B.S. Terpening C.M. Yamaoka K. Allergretto E.A. Baker A.R. Shine J. McDonnell D.P. Hughes M. Weigel N.L. O'Malley B.W. Pike J.W. Recent Prog. Horm.

The 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 24-hydroxylase gene (P450cc24) encodes a key enzyme involved in vitamin D metabolism, which is responsible for the conversion of 25-(OH)D3 and 1,25-(OH)2D3 to 24,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (24,25-(OH)2D3) and 1,24,25-trihydroxyvitamin D3, respectively (24Ohyama Y. Okuda K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8690-8695Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These metabolites are thought to be inactive forms of vitamin D (25Brommage R. DeLuca H.F. Endocr. Rev. 1985; 6: 491-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). However, 1,25-(OH)2D3 induces 24-hydroxylase activity in its target cells, and thus its presence may play a crucial role in eliminating hormone activity of the vitamin D compound (25Brommage R. DeLuca H.F. Endocr. Rev. 1985; 6: 491-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Two vitamin D-responsive elements (VDRE-1 and VDRE-2) responsible for 1,25-(OH)2D3 stimulation of transcription were identified at nucleotides −151 to −137 and nucleotides −259 to −245 of the 5′-flanking region of the rat P450cc24 gene (26Ohyama Y.

Omdahl J.L. May B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29715-29721Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Both VDREs contain two AGGTCA-like repeat motifs with a 3-nucleotide space in sense or antisense orientation and are similar to the VDREs found in the human P450cc24 gene (29Chen K.S. DeLuca H.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1263: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Examination of regulation via the 24-hydroxylase induction mechanism at the molecular level may contribute to the understanding of vitamin D in the endocrine system.In this study, we analyzed the regulation by TR4 on the vitamin D3 signaling pathway and compared the expression pattern of TR4 to that in vitamin D3 target organs. The differential regulation of target genes containing DR3VDRE and DR4T3RE by TR4 was further investigated, and the results suggested that conformational changes because of DNA-protein and protein-protein interactions might play major roles in this regulation.DISCUSSIONAccording to the sequence of the TR4 DNA binding domain and our previous results from EMSA, we conclude that TR4 binds to the AGGTCA core consensus motif arranged in a direct repeat orientation with various numbers of nucleotide spacings. In this paper, we demonstrated that TR4 binds to DR3VDRE with high affinity and thus suppresses vitamin D3-induced P450cc24 gene activation. However, in our previous studies, we demonstrated that TR4 activates the genes that contain DR4-T3RE or nonclassical T3RE by binding to their response elements (13Lee Y.-F. Pan H.-J Burbach J.P.H. Morkin E. Chang C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12215-12220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The mechanisms of different binding responses of TR4 to the same sequence in core motifs with different spacings remain unclear. The responsiveness of genes to steroid hormones involves both the binding of regulatory proteins to specific DNA sequences and the formation of critical protein-protein associations. Throughout the past decade, a number of nuclear receptor coregulators has been characterized and provides us a more detailed molecular model of how nuclear receptors regulate their target genes. Because TR4 binds to DR3VDRE and DR4T3RE with similar affinities (1.32 versus 2.0 nm), we propose that whether TR4 works as a transcriptional enhancer or a silencer might be mediated not only by direct DNA binding but also by protein-protein interactions. This indicates that in addition to the receptor and the DNA, other factors may also contribute to the selectivity of receptors in the recognition of their target genes.To test this hypothesis, EMSAs and proteolytic analyses were performed. In Fig. 4, A and B, distinct EMSA patterns were observed when TR4 was bound 32P-DR3VDRE and32P-DR4T3RE in the presence of different combinations of various TR4 monoclonal antibodies. Meanwhile, different peptide patterns were obtained when DR4- or DR3-bound TR4 was digested with trypsin. Taken together, these data suggest that TR4 binding to diverse HREs may result in distinct conformational changes that can then trigger differential regulation. This finding supports the existence of a unique spacing of the direct repeat, which serves as a binding site for an auxiliary protein that modifies receptor activity (39Umesono K. Murakami K.K. Thompson C.C. Evans R.M. Cell. 1991; 65: 1255-1266Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1488) Google Scholar). Similar approaches have also been used to study a thyroid receptor response element, RSVT3RE, which contains an inverted repeat with a 6-nucleotide space. RSVT3RE allows strong activation by c-ErbAα in the absence of thyroid hormone, and the results of antibody-induced supershift experiments indicate that binding to this element may result in a different conformation as compared with binding to a typical DR4T3RE (40Saatcioglu F. Deng T. Karin M. Cell. 1993; 75: 1095-1105Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). These results suggest that different conformational changes may be involved in determining whether TR4 would function as a positive or negative regulatory factor.As previous studies indicated that RIP140 could interact with VDR, T3R, and TR4 (18Masuyama H. Brownfiled C.M. St-Arnaud R. MacDonald P.N. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 1507-1517Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 41Collingwood T.N. Rajanayagan O. Adams M. Wagner R. Cavailles V. Kalkhoven E. Matthews C. Nystrom E. Stenlof K. Lindstedt G. Tisell L. Fletterick R.J. Parker M.G. Chatterjee V.K.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 248-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), we were interested in determining if RIP140 could differentially affect TR4-mediated gene induction and repression. Using the GST pull-down assay, we demonstrated that TR4 could interact in vitro with RIP140. We then proved that RIP140 could also enhance the trans-repressive effect of TR4 on the vitamin D3-signaling pathway. In contrast, RIP140 has only marginal effects on the vitamin D3-induced VDRE-CAT activity, although it might interact with VDR (18Masuyama H. Brownfiled C.M. St-Arnaud R. MacDonald P.N. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 1507-1517Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). On the other hand, RIP140 repressed the transactivation mediated by both TR4 (Fig.7 B, lane 5 versus 6) and liganded T3R (Fig. 7 B, lane 7 versus 10) on DR4T3RE-CAT. However, RIP140 had only very marginal repressive effects on DR4T3RE-CAT once we overexpressed TR4 and liganded T3R simultaneously. A reasonable explanation for the effect of RIP140 on DR4T3RE-CAT is that TR4 and liganded T3R may both interact with RIP140 and sequester RIP140 blocking the repressive effect of RIP140 on DR4-T3RE-CAT (Fig.8). Because RIP140 can repress both pathways mediated by TR4, it might not be recruited differently by TR4 when it is bound to DR4T3RE or DR3VDRE. However, RIP140 did show differential effects in the regulation of DR4T3RE-CAT and DR3VDRE-CAT when receptors, TR4 and VDR versus TR4 and T3R, are co-transfected. These data support the role of the protein environment surrounding the DNA as a key factor in determining gene regulation. Therefore, the dynamic interaction between the receptors and cofactors in response to their target DNA may determine the specificity of gene regulation.Although the functional reporter assay presented here was carried outin vitro, the expression patterns of TR4 in the vitamin D target organs support the potential role of TR4 in regulation of thein vivo vitamin D pathway in the endocrine system. Vitamin D and its receptor play essential roles in the regulation of calcium homeostasis and bone formation. Bone, kidney, and intestine are three major targets for such action. In addition, vitamin D is involved in the regulation of cell proliferation, differentiation, and the immune response. At present, the nonclassic targets reported include lung (35Zhong K. Chua B.H. Palmer K.C. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1994; 11: 480-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar) and hair follicles (36Reichrath J. Schilli M. Kerber A. Bahmer F.A. Czarnetzki B.M. Paus R. Br. J. Dermatol. 1994; 131: 477-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). It has been demonstrated that high levels of VDR transcripts are present in bone, kidney, and all identified nonclassic target organs. Throughout the entire process of bone differentiation, VDR transcripts were detected in osteoblasts and osteocytes of both normal and actively remodeling bone tissue (42Davideau J.L. Papagerakis P. Hotton D. Lezot F. Berdal A. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 3577-3585Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In the kidney, VDR and P450cc24 were co-localized in the distal renal tubules, the collecting ducts, the proximal tubes, and the parietal epithelial cells of the glomerulus (37Liu L. Ng M. Iacopino A.M. Dunn S.T. Hughes M.R. Bourdeau J.E. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1994; 5: 1251-1258PubMed Google Scholar, 43Kumar R. Schaefer J. Grande J.P. Roche P.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: F477-F485PubMed Google Scholar). Our data show TR4 transcripts in perichondrium, kidney, hair follicles, and lung, suggesting TR4 and VDR may be co-localized during the development of these tissues. Among the vitamin D target genes, P450cc24 has been shown to respond to vitamin D treatment in the kidney and intestine. The distribution of this enzyme in the kidney is exclusive to the proximal tubules (38Roy S. Tenenhouse H.S. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 2938-2946Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas its location in the intestine was detected in the lower part of the villi and columnar epithelium of the crypt. Our in situ data showed TR4 expression in renal tubules and intestinal villi, indicating TR4 and P450cc24 may be co-expressed in these places, thus providing physiological significance for the interaction between TR4 and VDR on the regulation of the P450cc24 gene. Moreover, immunostaining for VDR revealed that VDR was apparent in rat fetuses as early as embryonic days 9 and 11. In developing limbs at embryonic days 13–15, VDR epitopes were present in the skin, the cytoplasm of condensing mesenchymal cells, and the chondrocytes (44Johnson J.A. Grande J.P. Roche P.C. Kumar R. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1996; 11: 56-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Whether TR4 could also interact with VDR in regulating other vitamin D target genes, such as osteocalcin and alkaline phosphatase, is an intriguing question to ask.On the other hand, vitamin D3 decreases VDR/VDR homodimer formation and enhances the formation of RXR/VDR heterodimers. Thus, it potentiates RXR/VDR action by enhancement of the RXR/VDR binding affinity to VDREs and activation of target gene expression (33Rosen E.D. Beninghof E.G. Koenig R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11534-11541Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Cheskis B. Freedman L.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3329-3338Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). We then compared the binding affinity of TR4 and RXR/VDR to DR3VDRE and found that TR4 bound to DR3VDRE with a 5.5-fold higher affinity than the RXR/VDR heterodimer. These binding affinity data suggest that TR4 may be able to compete with RXR/VDR to bind to DR3VDRE and in this way, exert its repressive effect. The ratio of functional TR4·DR3VDRE complex to RXR/VDR·DR3VDRE might also be important in determining target gene action. Additionally, the failure of the repression effect observed when PCMX-TR4 was replaced with the chimeric receptor PCMX-4A4 in a reporter gene assay further supports the idea that DNA binding is essential for TR4 to exert its proper function.The responsiveness of genes to a steroid hormone receptor is principally mediated by functional interactions between DNA-bound receptors and components of the transcription initiation machinery. In this paper we demonstrated that TR4 represses the P450cc24 gene activation induced by vitamin D3 via in vitroand in vivo evidence. Both DNA binding and proper protein-protein interactions may be the key factors in determining the specific function of TR4. This study may lead to an understanding of the role of DNA binding in altering the conformation of TR4 and allowing different protein interactions resulting in a complex that is capable of mediating differential regulation. Steroid hormones are key physiological mediators of development and homeostasis (1Evans R.M. Science. 1988; 240: 889-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (6293) Google Scholar, 2Beato M. Cell. 1989; 56: 335-344Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2841) Google Scholar, 3Parker M.G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 499-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 4Tsai M.J. O'Malley B.W. Annu. Rev. of Biochem. 1994; 63: 451-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (2679) Google Scholar). Understanding the crosstalk between steroid hormone-dependent and -independent signaling pathways is critical for gaining further insight into the integration of cellular regulatory cues that modulate development and tissue-specific gene expression. The biological effects of steroids and related hormones, including derivatives of vitamins A and D3, are mediated through their cognate receptors (1Evans R.M.

https://openalex.org/W2044855908,"Pharmacophore mapping of adrenergic receptors indicates that the phenyl ring of catecholamine agonists is involved in receptor binding and activation. Here we evaluated Phe310, Phe311, and Phe303 in transmembrane VI (TMVI), as well as Tyr348 in TMVII of the α1B-adrenergic receptor (α1B-AR), which have been implicated in a catechol-ring interaction. Neither catecholamine docking studies nor mutagenesis studies of Phe311, Phe303, or Tyr348 supported a role for these residues in catechol-ring binding. By contrast, docking studies indicated that the Phe310 side chain is well positioned to interact with the catechol-ring, and substituted cysteine accessibility method studies revealed that the side chain of the 310, but not 311 residue, is both solvent accessible and directed into the agonist-binding pocket. Also, saturation mutagenesis of both Phe310 and Phe311 revealed for the former, but not for the latter, a direct relationship between side chain volume and agonist affinity, and that aromaticity is essential for wild-type agonist binding, and for both wild-type agonist potency and efficacy. Moreover, studies of Phe310 mutants combined with a previously described constitutively active α1B-AR mutant, A293E, indicated that although not required for spontaneous receptor isomerization from the basal state, R, to a partially activated conformation R′, interaction of Phe310 with catecholamine agonists is essential for isomerization from R′ to the fully activated state,R*. Pharmacophore mapping of adrenergic receptors indicates that the phenyl ring of catecholamine agonists is involved in receptor binding and activation. Here we evaluated Phe310, Phe311, and Phe303 in transmembrane VI (TMVI), as well as Tyr348 in TMVII of the α1B-adrenergic receptor (α1B-AR), which have been implicated in a catechol-ring interaction. Neither catecholamine docking studies nor mutagenesis studies of Phe311, Phe303, or Tyr348 supported a role for these residues in catechol-ring binding. By contrast, docking studies indicated that the Phe310 side chain is well positioned to interact with the catechol-ring, and substituted cysteine accessibility method studies revealed that the side chain of the 310, but not 311 residue, is both solvent accessible and directed into the agonist-binding pocket. Also, saturation mutagenesis of both Phe310 and Phe311 revealed for the former, but not for the latter, a direct relationship between side chain volume and agonist affinity, and that aromaticity is essential for wild-type agonist binding, and for both wild-type agonist potency and efficacy. Moreover, studies of Phe310 mutants combined with a previously described constitutively active α1B-AR mutant, A293E, indicated that although not required for spontaneous receptor isomerization from the basal state, R, to a partially activated conformation R′, interaction of Phe310 with catecholamine agonists is essential for isomerization from R′ to the fully activated state,R*. α1-Adrenergic receptors (α1-AR) 1The abbreviations used are: α1-AR, α1-adrenergic receptor; SCAM, substituted cysteine accessability method; [125I]HEAT, 2-[β-(4-hydroxyl-3-[125I]iodophenyl)ethylaminomethyl]tetralone; E max, the maximal effector response; TM, transmembrane; MTSEA, methanethiosulfonate ethylammonium; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; PI, phosphatidylinositol; GPCR, G-protein coupled receptor. 1The abbreviations used are: α1-AR, α1-adrenergic receptor; SCAM, substituted cysteine accessability method; [125I]HEAT, 2-[β-(4-hydroxyl-3-[125I]iodophenyl)ethylaminomethyl]tetralone; E max, the maximal effector response; TM, transmembrane; MTSEA, methanethiosulfonate ethylammonium; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; PI, phosphatidylinositol; GPCR, G-protein coupled receptor. are members of the heptahelical superfamily that share a common structural motif of seven putative α-helical transmembrane spanning regions linked by three extra- and three intracellular loops, an extracellular N terminus and intracellular C-terminal tail. Transmembrane signaling by all α1-AR subtypes (α1A, α1B, and α1D) in response to the natural catecholamine agonists, norepinephrine and epinephrine, is mediated by G-proteins of the Gq/11 family or in some instances, the Gh family of tissue transglutaminases (1Wu D. Katz A. Lee C.H. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25798-25802Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Chen S. Lin F. Iismaa S. Lee K.N. Birckbichler P.J. Graham R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32385-32391Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Based on certain key structural features, α1-ARs are more closely related to rhodopsin or the type A subfamily of GPCRs that includes β-ARs, than to the calcitonin (type B) or metabotropic (type C) subfamilies. Binding of catecholamines by both α1- and β-ARs involves the formation of a salt bridge between the basic aliphatic nitrogen atom common to all sympathomimetic amines and an aspartate (Asp125 in the hamster α1B-AR; Asp113 in the hamster β2-AR) in the third transmembrane segment (TMIII) (3Porter J.E. Hwa J. Perez D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28318-28323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 4Strader C.D. Sigal I.S. Register R.B. Candelore M.R. Rands E. Dixon R.A.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 83: 917-921Google Scholar). With rhodopsin, light induced isomerization of the retinal chromophore leads to deprotonation of a Schiff base linking the chromophore to Lys296 in TMVII (5Robinson P.R. Cohen G.B. Zhukovsky E.A. Oprian D.D. Neuron. 1992; 9: 719-725Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). In the ground state the protonated Schiff base is ionically bonded to a TMIII acidic residue (Glu113) that is equivalent to Asp125 and Asp113 in the α1B and β2-ARs, respectively (5Robinson P.R. Cohen G.B. Zhukovsky E.A. Oprian D.D. Neuron. 1992; 9: 719-725Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). With the α1B-AR there is evidence that receptor activation also is due to disruption of an ionic interaction between the TMIII aspartate and a TMVII lysine (Lys331), due to competition between the catechol protonated amine and the TMVII lysine, for binding to the TMIII aspartate (3Porter J.E. Hwa J. Perez D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28318-28323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The TMIII aspartate thus serves as a counterion and most likely is an important residue for agonist binding and activation of all adrenergic receptors. For the β2-AR, two serine residues, Ser204and Ser207, which are conserved in most adrenergic receptors, have been proposed to hydrogen bond with themeta- and para-hydroxyls, respectively, of the catechol ring (6Strader C.D. Candelore M.R. Hill W.S. Sigal I.S. Dixon R.A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13572-13578Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mutation of either serine to an alanine results in a 30-fold decrease in affinity for catecholamine agonists, and each serine contributes about 50% to receptor activation. Thus, binding of both catechol hydroxyls is required for full agonist activity. By contrast, agonist binding to the α1A-AR involves an interaction between the meta-hydroxyl and Ser188(equivalent to Ser203, not Ser204 in the β2-AR) that plays a major role in receptor activation, being responsible for 70–90% of the wild-type response. An interaction between the para-hydroxyl and Ser192(equivalent to Ser207 in the β2-AR), on the other hand, contributes minimally to receptor activation (7Hwa J. Perez D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6322-6327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Moreover, since the interacting serines in the α1A-AR are separated by four residues, whereas those in the β2-AR are separated by only three residues, docking of the catecholamine ring is in a more planar orientation in the α1A-AR, and is rotated by about 120° to that in the β2-AR. This altered catechol ring orientation may also contribute to other agonist docking differences between α1- and β-ARs. For example, stereoselectivity of binding and activation has been attributed, in part, to a hydrogen bond interaction between the chiral benzylic hydroxyl group attached to the β-carbon atom of catecholamines, and Asn293 in TMVI of the β2-AR (8Wieland K. Zuurmond H.M. Krasel C. Ijerman A.P. Lohse M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9276-9281Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Although stereoselectivity of catecholamine binding and activation is preserved with α1-ARs, the determinants of stereoselectivity have not been defined, and the Asn293 equivalent is replaced by a residue (leucine or methionine) lacking hydrogen-bonding potential. This finding again provides evidence that some of the catecholamine-binding and activation residues in α1-ARs are distinct from those in β-ARs. Previous studies of the hamster β2-AR suggested that a phenylalanine in TMVI (Phe290, equivalent to Phe311 in the α1B-AR, see Fig.1), which is conserved only in biogenic amine-binding GPCRs, is involved in forming an aromatic-aromatic interaction with the phenyl ring of catecholamines (9Strader C.D. Sigal I.S. Dixon R.A. FASEB J. 1989; 3: 1825-1832Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). This conclusion was based on the finding of a 10-fold decrease in agonist, but not antagonist, binding with mutation of Phe290 to methionine. However, no additional studies were performed to exclude a nonspecific global or local change in receptor structure with this Phe290 mutation, or to evaluate the role of the potential aromatic-aromatic interaction in receptor activation. In addition, substitution of an adjacent TMVI phenylalanine (Phe289; equivalent to Phe310 in the α1B-AR) to alanine, resulted in a 1000-fold decrease in agonist affinity with no change in antagonist binding. Finally, Tyr326 in TMVII was also suggested to potentially be involved in a catechol ring interaction, since substitution of this residue with leucine decreased agonist, but not antagonist binding by 10-fold (9Strader C.D. Sigal I.S. Dixon R.A. FASEB J. 1989; 3: 1825-1832Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). Here we show, based on macromolecular modeling studies, in which the planar orientation of the phenyl ring in α1-ARs was taken into consideration when docking catecholamines, that interaction with the phenyl ring involves Phe310 in TMVI and not Phe311 in TMVI, or Tyr348 in TMVII (equivalent to Tyr326 in the β2-AR). Furthermore, based on mutagenesis studies coupled with the evaluation of group-specific catecholamine analogs, as well as SCAM (substituted cysteine accessibility method) studies, we provide evidence that Phe310 is critically involved both in forming an aromatic-aromatic interaction with the catecholamine phenyl ring and in receptor activation. (−)-Epinephrine, (−)-norepinephrine, (±)-synephrine, (±)-halostachine, dopamine, phenethylamine, prazosin, phentolamine hydrochloride, lithium chloride, and dl-propranolol were purchased from Sigma. 5-Methylurapidil was from Research Biochemicals International.

[125I]HEAT (2200 Ci/mmol) was from Du Pont. Methanethiosulfonate ethylammonium (MTSEA) was from Toronto Research Chemicals Inc. Other chemicals were of the highest grade available commercially. The construct used was the hamster α1B-AR cDNA with an octapeptide tag (1D4) at the end of coding region in the modified eukaryotic expressing vector, pMT2′ (10Hwa J. Graham R.M. Perez D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7956-7964Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The presence of the 1D4 epitope at the C-terminal of α1B-AR does not affect its expression and function (data not shown). Site-directed mutagenesis was performed as described previously (2Chen S. Lin F. Iismaa S. Lee K.N. Birckbichler P.J. Graham R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32385-32391Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 11Deng W.P. Nickoloff J.A. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 200: 81-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (1078) Google Scholar). Briefly, two primers, one carrying the nucleotide change(s) to produce the desired amino acid mutation in the α1B-AR sequence, the other carrying the nucleotide changes to convert a unique restriction site (ClaI) to another restriction site (NarI) in a non-essential region of the vector, pMT2′, were simultaneously annealed to the denatured template and a new second strand DNA containing both primers was synthesized by treatment with T4 polymerase. The DNA was then digested with ClaI to linearize re-annealed parental plasmid and the reaction mixture used to transform Escherichia coli cells (BMH 71–18 mutS cells). Transformants were grown en mass in liquid media and used to isolate plasmid DNA. The resulting DNA was digested with ClaI again to linearize remaining parental plasmid, and transformed into DH5α-cells. Transformants were plated and plasmid DNA prepared and sequenced to confirm the presence of the desired mutation. COS-1 cells (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) were cultured and transiently transfected with the indicated constructs using the DEAE-dextran method, as described previously (2Chen S.

The transfection efficiency was 30–40%, as determined by in situ staining of cells transfected with pSVLacZ, a plasmid encoding the reporter, β-galactosidase, and treatment of the cells with 0.2% 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indoyl-β-d-galactoside. Cells were harvested 72 h post-transfection. Membranes were prepared from transfected COS-1 cells, as described previously (2Chen S. Lin F. Iismaa S. Lee K.N. Birckbichler P.J. Graham R.M. J. Biol.

The membranes were resuspended in HEM buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 1.5 mm EGTA, 12.5 mm MgCl2) containing 10% (v/v) glycerol, and stored at −70 °C. Protein concentration was determined by the Bradford method (14Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211805) Google Scholar). Membranes (50 μg of protein) were dissolved in 1% CHAPS and SDS sample buffer overnight at 4 °C, and then subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, as described previously (2Chen S. Lin F.

The resolved proteins were electroblotted onto Immobilon-P membranes and then immunostained for detection using the ECL chemiluminescence system (Amersham), as described previously (2Chen S. Lin F. Iismaa S. Lee K.N. Birckbichler P.J. Graham R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32385-32391Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). α1B-AR was detected using a monoclonal antibody against the 1D4 epitope (12Franke R.R. Sakmar T.P. Graham R.M. Khorana H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14767-14774Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The ligand binding characteristics of the membrane expressed receptors were determined in a series of radioligand binding studies performed exactly as described previously (2Chen S. Lin F. Iismaa S. Lee K.N. Birckbichler P.J. Graham R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32385-32391Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 10Hwa J. Graham R.M. Perez D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7956-7964Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), using [125I]HEAT, an α1-specific antagonist, as the radioligand. For saturation binding studies, the concentrations of [125I]HEAT used ranged from 10-fold below to 10-fold above the K d value, whereas for competition studies, a concentration near the K d of the radioligand value was used. K i values were determined using the Cheng-Prusoff equation (15Cheng Y. Prusoff W.H. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1973; 22: 3099-3108Crossref PubMed Scopus (12129) Google Scholar). The membrane concentration used in these studies was selected to allow binding of less than 10% of the total radioligand added. To avoid interassay differences replicate studies with the wild-type α1B-AR were performed with the analysis of each mutant. Binding data were analyzed using the iterative, nonlinear, curve-fitting program, Prism. For comparison of the fit to a one-site or two-site model, the F test was used, p < 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. Transfected COS-1 cells were harvested by trypsinization. After washing with phosphate-buffered saline, cells were resuspended in 1.4 ml of HEPES buffer (140 mm NaCl, 5.4 mmKCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.006% bovine serum albumin, 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) as described previously (16Javitch J.A. Fu D. Chen J. Karlin A. Neuron. 1995; 14: 825-831Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Aliquots (80 μl) of the cell suspension were incubated with 20 μl of freshly prepared MTSEA at the stated concentrations at room temperature for 2 min. Cell suspensions were then diluted 20-fold, and 100-μl aliquots were used to assay for [125I]HEAT (600 pm) binding in the presence or absence of 0.1 mm phentolamine in a total volume of 250 μl in triplicate. The result was analyzed as described above. The coordinates of the α-carbon positions were determined by overlay of putative α1-AR transmembrane residues with the transmembrane coordinates of bacteriorhodopsin (17Henderson R. Baldwin J.M. Ceska T.A. Zemlin F. Beckman E. Downing K.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 213: 899-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (2507) Google Scholar), with data files generated using the Insight II molecular modeling software from Biosym Technologies. The boundaries of the putative transmembrane domains were determined using an algorithm based on the weighted pairwise comparisons of adjacent residues (18Riek R.P. Handschumacher M.K. Sung S.-S. Tan M. Glynias M.J. Schlucter M.D. Novotny J. Graham R.M. J. Theor. Biol. 1995; 172: 245-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The positioning of each helix with respect to the adjacent helices was based where possible on data from α1B-AR mutagenesis studies (10Hwa J. Graham R.M. Perez D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7956-7964Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 18Riek R.P. Handschumacher M.K. Sung S.-S. Tan M. Glynias M.J. Schlucter M.D. Novotny J. Graham R.M. J.

The projections of the helices proposed by Baldwin (21Baldwin J.M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1693-1703Crossref PubMed Scopus (876) Google Scholar) were used to determine the tilt of each helix. The model was minimized and conflicts adjusted to remove steric clashes based on dynamic runs, as described previously (22Sung S.-S. Riek R.P. Handschumacher M.K. Novotny J. Graham R.M. FASEB J. 1991; 5: A804Google Scholar). Phosphatidylinositol (PI) hydrolysis in intact, transfected COS-1 cells was determined exactly as described previously (2Chen S. Lin F. Iismaa S. Lee K.N. Birckbichler P.J. Graham R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32385-32391Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), except that for determining basal activation of PI hydrolysis, the cells were seeded onto 6-well plates 1 day after transfection. Results are expressed as the mean ± S.E. (error bars). An analysis of variance and the Student's t test were used to determine significant differences (p < 0.05). A model of the α1B-AR developed previously (22Sung S.-S. Riek R.P. Handschumacher M.K. Novotny J. Graham R.M. FASEB J. 1991; 5: A804Google Scholar) was refined to accommodate the findings of recent mutagenesis studies and used to dock the agonist, (−)-epinephrine, into the binding pocket. In particular the refined model takes into account an interhelical stacking interaction we have identified between Ala204 in TMV and Leu314 in TMVI (10Hwa J. Graham R.M. Perez D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7956-7964Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 20Hwa J. Graham R.M. Perez D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23189-23195Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), as well as the planar orientation of the catechol ring. As shown in Fig.2 A, from this model it is evident that the TMVI Phe310 side chain is well positioned to interact with the catechol ring in a parallel stacked and displaced conformation, which is an energetically favored structure for benzene dimers (23Jorgensen W.L. Severance D.L. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1990; 112: 4768-4774Crossref Scopus (1158) Google Scholar). The TMVI Phe311 side chain, on the other hand, is directed toward TMV, or is projecting into the lipid bilayer, and Tyr348 is located toward the intracellular end of TMVII, well below the plane of the catecholamine ligand. To more directly evaluate the involvement of Phe310 in catechol ring binding, it was mutated to alanine or leucine, and the resulting mutants (F310A and F310L), as well as the wild-type α1B-AR, were then evaluated in terms of membrane expression, ligand binding, and stimulation of PI hydrolysis. As controls for the potential Phe310-catechol ring interaction, alanine and leucine mutants of two other TMVI phenylalanines, Phe311 and Phe303, and a leucine mutant of Tyr348 in TMVII, were also constructed and similarly evaluated (Fig. 2 B). Saturation binding and immunoblotting studies indicated that the F303A, F303L, and Y348L mutants were expressed in the plasma membrane and processed (glycosylation) at levels almost equal to the wild-type α1B-AR (Table I and Fig.3). All three mutants showed only small decreases (1.7–2.2-fold) in affinity for the antagonist radioligand, [125I]HEAT (Table I) and no change (Y348L) or an increase (5–20-fold, F303A and F303L) in affinity for the agonists, norepinephrine, epinephrine, and phenylephrine (Fig.4). As will be reported in a subsequent paper, 2S. Chen, M. Xu, F. Lin, and R. M. Graham, unpublished data. the increased agonist affinities observed with the Phe303 mutants are due to the fact that these substitutions result in constitutive receptor activation. Taken together, therefore, these findings do not support involvement of Phe303 or Tyr348 in an interaction with the catechol ring.Table IBinding of [ 125I]HEAT by wild-type and mutant α1B-ARsWTF310AF310LF311AF311LF303AF303LY348LAmount of DNA transfected (μg/100-mm dish)2222520222Receptor density B max(pmol/mg)8.12 ± 0.778.21 ± 1.538.09 ± 1.660.95 ± 0.05ap < 0.001 indicates significant differences versus the wild-type α1B-AR.1.70 ± 0.34bp < 0.01 indicates significant differencesversus the wild-type α1B-AR.5.88 ± 0.724.80 ± 0.18bp < 0.01 indicates significant differencesversus the wild-type α1B-AR.6.18 ± 0.51K D(pm)66.5 ± 2.466.2 ± 15.284.3 ± 30454 ± 10ap < 0.001 indicates significant differences versus the wild-type α1B-AR.60.2 ± 17121 ± 32116 ± 36145 ± 26bp < 0.01 indicates significant differencesversus the wild-type α1B-AR.[125I]HEAT saturation binding studies were carried out with membranes prepared from transfected COS-1 cells as described under “Experimental Procedures.” B max values indicate the maximum number of binding sites/mg of membrane protein.

Values in parentheses are the ratio ofK i values of the mutant to the wild-type α1B-ARs. The Phe311 mutants also displayed decreased antagonist binding (5–94-fold, Table II). However, in contrast to the Phe310 mutants, plasma membrane expression was markedly impaired with both F311A and F311L, and could not be enhanced by increasing the amounts of plasmid transfected (Table I and Fig. 3). These findings suggest that whereas substitution of Phe310with alanine or leucine results in the loss of receptor interactions involved in the binding of some but not all antagonists, mutation of Phe311 produces a global change in receptor conformation that impairs not only ligand binding, but also protein folding and membrane expression. To further characterize the effects of alanine or leucine substitution at the Phe310 and Phe311 positions, the binding of group-specific agonists was evaluated. The agonists evaluated included the natural catecholamines, (−)-norepinephrine, and (−)-epinephrine, as well as (−)-phenylephrine, which is also a full agonist but lacks the para-hydroxyl at the 4-position of the catechol ring, and a group of partial agonists: (±)-synephrine, (±)-halostachine, phenethylamine, and dopamine, which lack ameta-hydroxyl at the 3-position of the catechol ring; both catechol ring hydroxyls; both catechol ring hydroxyls and the chiral hydroxyl on the β-carbon; or only the chiral β-hydroxyl, respectively. As shown in Fig.4 A, the F310A mutant showed affinity losses of up to 1000-fold for the full agonists, but smaller losses (10–50-fold) for the partial agonists. Consistent with the involvement of Phe310 in ligand binding, the F310L mutant in which the hydrophobicity but not the aromaticity of the wild-type phenylalanine residue is preserved, displayed lesser decreases in binding of both full agonists (30–40-fold) and partial agonists (3–10-fold), than the F310A mutant (Fig. 4B).

Binding of the pterin affects the electronic structure of the prosthetic heme group in the oxygenase domain and results in a pronounced stabilization of the active homodimeric structure of the protein. However, these allosteric effects are also produced by the potent pterin antagonist of NOS, 4-amino-H4biopterin, suggesting that the natural cofactor has an additional, as yet unknown catalytic function. Here we show that the 5-methyl analog of H4biopterin, which does not react with O2, is a functionally active pterin cofactor of neuronal NOS. Activation of the H4biopterin-free enzyme occurred in a biphasic manner with half-maximally effective concentrations of approximately 0.2 μm and 10 mm 5-methyl-H4biopterin. Thus, the affinity of the 5-methyl compound was 3 orders of magnitude lower than that of the natural cofactor, allowing the direct demonstration of the functional anticooperativity of the two pterin binding sites of dimeric NOS. In contrast to H4biopterin, which inactivates nitric oxide (NO) through nonenzymatic superoxide formation, up to 1 mmof the 5-methyl derivative did not consume O2 and had no effect on NO steady-state concentrations measured electrochemically with a Clark-type NO electrode. Therefore, reconstitution with 5-methyl-H4biopterin allowed, for the first time, the detection of enzymatic NO formation in the absence of superoxide or NO scavengers. These results unequivocally identify free NO as a NOS product and indicate that reductive O2 activation by the pterin cofactor is not essential to NO biosynthesis.

The neuronal (nNOS) and endothelial isoforms are constitutively expressed and require micromolar free Ca2+for activity, whereas the isoform first described in murine macrophages is cytokine-inducible and Ca2+-independent (inducible NO synthase (type II)). The enzymes consist of an oxygenase domain with a prosthetic heme group and a flavin-containing reductase domain shuttling reducing equivalents from the cosubstrate NADPH to the heme. Unlike other P450s, NOS requires H4biopterin as a cofactor, but the actions of the pterin that underlie this requirement remain a puzzle (3Mayer B. Werner E.R. Naunyn-Schmiedeberg′s Arch.

However, the allosteric effects of H4biopterin binding are more obvious and have been more accessible to experimentation. They involve changes in the conformation of the protein around the heme and substrate binding pocket (8Crane B.R. Arvai A.S. Ghosh D.K. Wu C.Q. Getzoff E.D. Stuehr D.J. Tainer J.A.

Chem. 1994; 269: 13861-13866Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and are coupled to a transition of the heme from a low spin, hexacoordinate state to a high spin, pentacoordinate state (10McMillan K.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 16735-16745Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Also, the binding of H4biopterin promotes dimerization of the enzyme. In inducible NO synthase (type II), it increases the level of dimerizationper se (13Baek K.J. Thiel B.A. Lucas S. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21120-21129Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and in all NOS isozymes, it induces a form of the dimer that is unusually resistant to dissociation by SDS (14Klatt P. Schmidt K. Lehner D. Glatter O. Bächinger H.P. Mayer B. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3687-3695Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). The time course of conversion from low spin heme to high spin heme correlates closely with enzyme activation (12Gorren A.C.F. List B.M. Schrammel A. Pitters E. Hemmens B. Werner E.R. Schmidt K. Mayer B. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 16735-16745Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar); also, only dimeric forms of the enzyme have been found to be active (15Klatt P. Pfeiffer S. List B.M.

Thus, it could be supposed that the allosteric effects of H4biopterin fully explain the pterin dependence of NOS. However, several pterin derivatives, such as dihydrobiopterin (9Klatt P. Schmid M.

J. 1997; 328: 349-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 18Mayer B. Wu C. Gorren A.C.F. Pfeiffer S. Schmidt K. Clark P. Stuehr D.J. Werner E.R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 8422-8427Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), produce the same allosteric effects as the natural cofactor but do not support NO synthesis. Inhibition of NOS by the oxidation-resistant deaza analog of 6-methyltetrahydropterin (19Hevel J.M. Marletta M.A. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 7160-7165Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar), as well as by the potent dihydropteridine reductase inhibitor 4-amino-H4biopterin (20Werner E.R. Pitters E. Schmidt K. Wachter H. Werner-Felmayer G. Mayer B. Biochem. J. 1996; 320: 193-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), indicated that classical two-electron redox cycling of the pterin cofactor may be essential for NO synthesis. This view was supported by a recent report showing that although both the di- and tetrahydro forms of various pterin derivatives have binding capacity, NOS activation was only observed in the presence of the tetrahydro compounds (16Presta A. Siddhanta U. Wu C.Q. Sennequier N. Huang L.X. Abu-Soud H.M. Erzurum S. Stuehr D.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 298-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Finally, a study of reaction intermediates indicated that H4biopterin was necessary for reductive activation of the oxy-ferrous complex of nNOS (21Bec N. Gorren A.C.F. Voelker C. Mayer B. Lange R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13502-13508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Taken together, these data provide circumstantial evidence for an essential role of the pterin redox properties in NOS catalysis. In the crystal structure of dimeric inducible NO synthase (type II) oxygenase, the pterin is located proximal to the heme, without apparent access to the distal site where O2 activation and substrate oxidation take place (8Crane B.R. Arvai A.S. Ghosh D.K. Wu C.Q. Getzoff E.D. Stuehr D.J. Tainer J.A. Science. 1998; 279: 2121-2126Crossref PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar). Thus, chemical contributions of the pterin to NOS catalysis are only likely if they occur via the heme. Another interesting feature of pterin-NOS interactions is the highly anticooperative binding of H4biopterin to two identical binding sites of homodimeric nNOS (12Gorren A.C.F. List B.M. Schrammel A. Pitters E. Hemmens B. Werner E.R. Schmidt K. Mayer B. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 16735-16745Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The biphasic association kinetics of [3H]H4biopterin binding to a pterin-deficient form of the protein pointed to a difference of at least 1,000-fold in the affinities for the binding of the first and the second H4biopterin molecule, respectively. From the rapid association of [3H]H4biopterin, the K Dvalue of the high affinity site was calculated to be less than 1 nm (12Gorren A.C.F. List B.M. Schrammel A. Pitters E. Hemmens B. Werner E.R. Schmidt K. Mayer B. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 16735-16745Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 22Gorren A.C.F. Schrammel A. Schmidt K. Mayer B. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4360-4366Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). This high binding affinity probably explains why isolated nNOS always contains about 1 equivalent of tightly bound H4biopterin per dimer (23Schmidt H.H.H.W. Pollock J.S. Nakane M. Gorsky L.D. Förstermann U. Murad F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 365-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar, 24List B.M. Klatt P. Werner E.R. Schmidt K. Mayer B. Biochem. J. 1996; 315: 57-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The anticooperative binding of H4biopterin appears to have important functional consequences because the pterin is essential for the coupling of NADPH oxidation to l-arginine metabolism (25Heinzel B. John M. Klatt P. Böhme E. Mayer B. Biochem. J. 1992; 281: 627-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). Thus, even in the presence of saturating l-arginine concentrations, activation of pterin-deficient nNOS by Ca2+/calmodulin results in the NADPH-dependent reduction of O2 to O⨪2 and, eventually, H2O2 (12Gorren A.C.F. List B.M. Schrammel A. Pitters E. Hemmens B. Werner E.R. Schmidt K. Mayer B. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 16735-16745Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Because the two catalytic domains of dimeric NOS operate independently (22Gorren A.C.F. Schrammel A. Schmidt K. Mayer B. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4360-4366Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 26Siddhanta U. Wu C.Q. Abu-Soud H.M. Zhang J. Ghosh D.K. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 18950-18958Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), these results suggest that native nNOS containing 1 equivalent of H4biopterin per dimer generates NO and O⨪2 at the same time, two species known to react with each other very rapidly to yield peroxynitrite (28Beckman J.S. Koppenol W.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 40: C1424-C1437Crossref Google Scholar). Indeed, nNOS was found to produce free NO only in the presence of the O⨪2 scavenger SOD (29Mayer B. Klatt P. Werner E.R. Schmidt K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 655-659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Inhibition of calmodulin-dependent H2O2 formation in the presence of relatively high, i.e. micromolar, concentrations of free H4biopterin suggests that enzymatic O⨪2 formation is prevented by saturation of the low affinity pterin binding site (12Gorren A.C.F. List B.M. Schrammel A. Pitters E. Hemmens B. Werner E.R. Schmidt K. Mayer B. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 16735-16745Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), but under these conditions, autooxidation of free H4biopterin appears to produce sufficient O⨪2to completely inactivate the NO formed by the pterin-saturated enzyme, again rendering SOD essential to detect free NO (29Mayer B. Klatt P. Werner E.R. Schmidt K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 655-659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Because SOD was reported to catalyze the interconversion of NO and nitroxyl anion (NO−) under certain conditions (30Murphy M.E. Sies H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10860-10864Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar), it was proposed that the initial product of the NOS reaction is, in fact, nitroxyl that is converted to free NO by SOD (31Schmidt H.H.H.W. Hofmann H. Schindler U. Shutenko Z.S. Cunningham D.D. Feelisch M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14492-14497Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). Although we have not observed any significant oxidation of nitroxyl released from Angeli's salt by SOD under our experimental conditions, 2K. Schmidt and B. Mayer, unpublished observation. 2K. Schmidt and B. Mayer, unpublished observation. the definitive rebuttal of the nitroxyl hypothesis would require a demonstration of NO formation by nNOS in the absence of SOD or other scavengers, a goal that has not been achieved thus far. In the present study, we have reconstituted pterin-deficient nNOS with the low affinity binding pterin derivative 5-methyl-H4biopterin. Unlike H4biopterin, this compound proved not to react with O2. This property allowed, for the first time, the detection of the enzymatic formation of free NO in the absence of O⨪2 or NO scavengers. In addition, the previously calculated 3 orders of magnitude difference in the affinity of the two highly anticooperative pterin binding sites becomes visible in NOS activity assays with 5-methyl-H4biopterin. Purified rat nNOS containing approximately 1 equivalent of H4biopterin per dimer (H4B(+)nNOS) was obtained from recombinant baculovirus-infected Sf9 cells as described previously (32Harteneck C.

Pteridine-deficient nNOS containing <0.1 equivalent of H4biopterin (H4B(−)nNOS) was obtained from Sf9 cells pretreated with 2,4-diamino-6-hydroxypyrimidine as described previously (24List B.M. Klatt P. Werner E.R. Schmidt K. Mayer B. Biochem. J. 1996; 315: 57-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). NO solutions were prepared as described previously (33Kukovetz W.R. Holzmann S. J. Cardiovasc.

Schircks Laboratories (Jona, Switzerland). Other chemicals including bovine Cu- and Zn-SOD were from Sigma. The batch of 5-methyl-H4biopterin used in the present study did not contain any detectable contaminating H4biopterin. The detection limit of the applied high performance liquid chromatography method with electrochemical detection (35Hyland K. J. Chromatogr. 1985; 343: 35-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) was 33 nmH4biopterin in 1 mm solutions of 5-methyl-H4biopterin. Accordingly, the amount of contaminating H4biopterin was ≤0.0033%. Most of the experiments shown here have been repeated with a batch of 5-methyl-H4biopterin containing approximately 0.2 μm H4biopterin in 1 mm solutions with identical results. NOS activity was determined as the formation of l-[2,3,4,5-3H]citrulline from l-[2,3,4,5-3H]arginine (36Mayer B. Klatt P. Werner E.R. Schmidt K. Neuropharmacology. 1994; 33: 1253-1259Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Incubations were for 10 min at 37 °C in 0.1 ml of 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 0.3 μg of nNOS, 0.1 mml-[2,3,4,5-3H]arginine (∼60,000 counts/min), 0.2 mm NADPH, 10 μg/ml calmodulin, 0.5 mm CaCl2, 0.2 mmCHAPS, and pteridines as indicated. Of note, standard incubation conditions were modified by omitting exogenous flavins that have been recognized as potential unwanted sources of superoxide (37Xia Y. Zweier J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12705-12710Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 38Vasquez-Vivar J. Kalyanaraman B. Martasek P. Hogg N. Masters B.S.S. Karoui H. Tordo P. Pritchard K.A. Proc. Natl. Acad.

H4B(+)nNOS and H4B(−)nNOS exhibited a similar specific activity of approximately 0.4 μmoll-citrulline × mg−1 × min−1 under those conditions. The stoichiometry of NADPH oxidation and l-citrulline formation was determined with H4B(+)nNOS under slightly modified conditions, i.e. in the presence of 0.2 mm [3H]arginine, SOD (5,000 units/ml), and a limiting concentration of NADPH (10 μm). The amount of [3H]citrulline formed was measured after 3 h of incubation at 37 °C. NO and O2 were measured at 37 °C with commercially available Clark-type electrodes (Iso-NO and ISO2; World Precision Instruments, Berlin, Germany) (29Mayer B. Klatt P. Werner E.R. Schmidt K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 655-659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The electrodes were connected to an Apple Macintosh computer via an analog to digital converter (MacLab; AD Instruments Ltd., Hastings, United Kingdom), and the output current was recorded under constant stirring. The NO electrode was calibrated daily with acidified nitrite according to the recommendations of the manufacturer. Two-point calibration of the O2 electrode was performed with argon and air-saturated distilled water, respectively. O2 consumption was measured at 37 °C in sealed 1.8-ml vials completely filled with 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4. The observed rates (K obs) were divided by the O2 and pterin concentrations to obtain the respective second-order rate constants. For the measurement of NO oxidation, a solution of authentic NO was added to 0.5 ml of 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, in open glass vials at 37 °C. For the determination of enzymatic NO formation, purified nNOS (5 μg) was incubated in 0.5-ml open glass vials at 37 °C in 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 0.1 mml-arginine, 0.2 mm NADPH, 10 μg/ml calmodulin, 0.5 mmCaCl2, and variable concentrations of H4biopterin or 5-methyl-H4biopterin. Pterins were added as 100-fold concentrated aqueous solutions. Where indicated, SOD was added to give a final concentration of 1,000 units/ml. Experiments were terminated by the addition of hemoglobin (4 μm, final concentration). Specific enzyme activity was calculated from the initial linear rise in the NO concentrations. Saturation binding experiments using [3H] H4biopterin as a high affinity radioligand were performed as described previously with minor modifications (9Klatt P. Schmid M. Leopold E. Schmidt K. Werner E.R. Mayer B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13861-13866Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). H4B(−)nNOS and H4B(+)nNOS (0.5 μg each) were incubated for 10 min at 37 °C with 10 nm[3H]H4biopterin (∼14 nCi) and increasing concentrations of 5-methyl-H4biopterin (10−8to 10−2m) in 0.1 ml of a 50 mmpotassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, followed by vacuum filtration of the protein using the MultiScreen Assay System (Millipore) and liquid scintillation counting of bound radioactivity. Data were corrected for nonspecific binding in the presence of 1 mm unlabeled H4biopterin. IC50 values obtained from individual experiments were used to calculate K Ivalues according to the following equation: K I = IC50/(1 + [H4B]f/K D) with [H4B]f corresponding to the concentration of free H4biopterin (10 nm), and K Dcorresponding to the binding constant for H4biopterin (≤1 nm) (12Gorren A.C.F.

Mayer B. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4360-4366Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). To test the reactivity of 5-methyl-H4biopterin toward O2, we measured the nonenzymatic consumption of O2 by H4biopterin and its 5-methyl analog. As shown in Fig. 1 A, H4biopterin led to a consumption of O2 that was linearly dependent on the concentration of the pterin (0.1–0.5 mm). Assuming a first-order rate law with respect to O2, the calculated second-order rate constant for the reaction was 4.72 ± 0.44 m−1s−1 (n = 8) at 37 °C. In contrast to H4biopterin, the 5-methyl analog did not trigger a detectable consumption of O2 at concentrations of up to 1 mm. Because the reduction of O2 by H4biopterin results in O⨪2-mediated oxidation of NO (29Mayer B. Klatt P. Werner E.R. Schmidt K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 655-659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), we tested the two pterins for their effects on the rate of NO oxidation measured in O2-containing solutions using a Clark-type NO electrode. Fig. 1 B shows that H4biopterin (0.1 mm), but not its 5-methyl analog, led to a rapid, apparently zero-order disappearance of the NO signal. The effect of H4biopterin was completely inhibited by SOD (1,000 units/ml; data not shown). The initial rate of NO consumption by added H4biopterin (0.1 mm, final concentration) was 38.5 ± 2.7 nm s−1(n = 4) at 37 °C. This rate agrees well with the O2 consumption data showing that the initial rate of O⨪2 generation by 0.1 mm H4biopterin was about 80 nm s−1 O⨪2 under identical conditions. The interesting chemical properties of 5-methyl-H4biopterin led us to investigate its effect on NOS activity. As shown in Fig.2, the presence of 5-methyl-H4biopterin resulted in a biphasic stimulation ofl-citrulline formation by H4B(−)nNOS. The first phase occurred with an EC50 of approximately 0.2 μm, resulting in an increase of the specific activity from a residual value of about 20 nmol l-citrulline × min−1 × mg−1 to 100 nmol × min−1 × mg−1 in the presence of 10 μm 5-methyl-H4biopterin. The enzyme activity approached the basal activity of H4B(+)nNOS (∼150 nmol × min−1 × mg−1) and was not further increased by up to 0.3 mm5-methyl-H4biopterin. The basal activity of H4B(+)nNOS was not significantly affected by up to 1 mm 5-methyl-H4biopterin. The second phase of enzyme activation occurred with a calculated EC50 of about 10 mm 5-methyl-H4biopterin with both H4B(+)nNOS and H4B(−)nNOS. Determination of the stoichiometry of NADP+ andl-citrulline formation by H4B(+)nNOS showed that NADPH oxidation was largely uncoupled from l-arginine oxidation in the absence of 5-methyl-H4biopterin or at low concentrations (up to 1 μm) of 5-methyl-H4biopterin (NADP+/l-citrulline = 2.2 ± 0.2;n = 4). The presence of 0.1 mm5-methyl-H4biopterin led to an almost complete coupling of the reactions, as indicated by a NADP+/l-citrulline stoichiometry of 1.59 ± 0.07 (n = 4), which is close to the theoretical value of 1.50 (5Mayer B. John M. Heinzel B. Werner E.R. Wachter H. Schultz G. Böhme E. FEBS Lett. 1991; 288: 187-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar, 6Stuehr D.J. Kwon N.S. Nathan C.F. Griffith O.W. Feldman P.L. Wiseman J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6259-6263Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Radioligand binding experiments using [3H]H4biopterin as a high affinity ligand (9Klatt P. Schmid M. Leopold E. Schmidt K. Werner E.R. Mayer B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13861-13866Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) showed that 5-methyl-H4biopterin bound specifically to the pterin site of nNOS. As illustrated in Fig.3, the 5-methyl analog displaced [3H]H4biopterin from H4B(−)nNOS and H4B(+)nNOS with IC50 values of 78 ± 7.1 and 62 ± 1.3 μm (means ± S.E.;n = 3), respectively. Because the K Dof the low affinity site is too high to be observed in radioligand binding experiments, 5-methyl-H4biopterin most likely displaced H4biopterin bound with high affinity to H4B(+)nNOS. Based on the K D of ≤1 nm for high affinity binding of H4biopterin (12Gorren A.C.F. List B.M. Schrammel A. Pitters E. Hemmens B. Werner E.R. Schmidt K. Mayer B. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 16735-16745Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 22Gorren A.C.F. Schrammel A. Schmidt K. Mayer B. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4360-4366Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), the maximal K I values for 5-methyl-H4biopterin binding to H4B(−)nNOS and H4B(+)nNOS were calculated to be 7.2 and 5.5 μm, respectively. The inactivity of 5-methyl-H4biopterin toward O2 suggested that incubation of nNOS with an excess of this synthetic pterin should not lead to the inactivation of enzymatically produced NO, as observed with the natural cofactor. Indeed, as shown in Fig. 4, significant NO formation was detectable when H4B(−)nNOS was incubated with 5-methyl-H4biopterin (1 mm; Fig. 4 A) instead of the natural cofactor (0.1 mm; Fig.4 B). The specific enzyme activity calculated from the initial linear increase in the NO concentration was 52 ± 3 nmol × mg−1 × min−1, giving a steady-state concentration of 0.20 ± 0.05 μm NO (means ± S.E.; n = 3). The addition of SOD (1,000 units/ml) further increased this level to 0.31 ± 0.09 μm NO. The response of the electrode was completely abolished by the addition of the NO scavenger hemoglobin (4 μm, final concentration). As shown in Fig. 4 B, the enzyme did not produce any detectable NO in the presence of 0.1 mm H4biopterin without SOD. The addition of SOD (1,000 units/ml) led to the formation of NO with an apparent specific activity of 45 ± 12 nmol NO × mg−1 × min−1 and a steady-state NO concentration of 0.29 ± 0.05 μm (means ± S.E.; n = 3). Again, the signal returned to baseline after the addition of hemoglobin (4 μm, final concentration). Similar results were obtained with H4B(+)nNOS (data not shown). The concentration-dependent effects of 5-methyl-H4biopterin on NO formation by H4B(−)nNOS and H4B(+)nNOS are summarized in Fig. 5. With both preparations, half-maximal enzyme activation was observed at 5–10 μm5-methyl-H4biopterin. The maximal specific activities of H4B(−)nNOS and H4B(+)nNOS calculated from the initial rates of NO formation at 1 mm of 5-methyl-H4biopterin were 52 ± 3 and 88 ± 4 nmol NO mg−1 × min−1 (means ± S.E.;n = 3) respectively, values that are in good agreement with the rate of NO formation obtained with H4biopterin in the same assay. Compared with the parent compound H4biopterin, the 5-methyl analog exhibited markedly reduced activity toward O2, which may be due to steric hindrance by the 5-methyl group, preventing the formation of the presumed hydroperoxide intermediate at the C4a position of the pterin ring. Nevertheless, 5-methyl-H4biopterin stimulated pterin-deficient nNOS in a biphasic manner, an effect that most likely reflects binding of the pterin to the high and low affinity sites of the dimeric protein. TheK D for binding the natural cofactor, H4biopterin, to the high affinity site is too low to be determined in binding studies, but from the kinetics of [3H]H4biopterin association to H4B(−)nNOS, we have calculated that the binding constant is ≤1 nm (12Gorren A.C.F. List B.M. Schrammel A. Pitters E. Hemmens B. Werner E.R. Schmidt K. Mayer B. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 16735-16745Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 22Gorren A.C.F. Schrammel A. Schmidt K. Mayer B. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4360-4366Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Because this value is about 1 order of magnitude lower than the typical NOS assay concentrations (10–30 nm), biphasic pterin binding is not detectable in functional studies using H4biopterin as a cofactor. However, the 3 orders of magnitude lower affinity of the 5-methyl derivative apparently allowed, for the first time, monitoring of the saturation of the high affinity site in the arginine-to-citrulline conversion assay. The 50,000-fold difference in the affinities of the two binding sites (EC50 values of approximately 0.2 μm and 10 mm) agrees well with our earlier estimate that the K D values for high and low affinity binding of H4biopterin to dimeric nNOS differ by at least 3 orders of magnitude (12Gorren A.C.F. List B.M. Schrammel A. Pitters E. Hemmens B. Werner E.R. Schmidt K. Mayer B. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 16735-16745Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 22Gorren A.C.F. Schrammel A. Schmidt K. Mayer B. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4360-4366Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Because the second phase of enzyme activation required relatively high concentrations of 5-methyl-H4biopterin, it was conceivable that this effect was mediated by contaminating H4biopterin. However, this is unlikely because (i) the batch of 5-methyl-H4biopterin used throughout this study did not contain any detectable H4biopterin (≤0.0033%), and (ii) virtually identical data were obtained with a batch containing an at least 10-fold higher amount of H4biopterin (0.03%). Because the precise K D value for high affinity H4biopterin binding is unknown, it was not possible to convert the IC50 values for inhibition of [3H]H4biopterin binding by the 5-methyl analog into reliable K I values. However, based on the solid evidence that the H4biopterin binding constant is ≤1 nm (12Gorren A.C.F. List B.M. Schrammel A. Pitters E. Hemmens B. Werner E.R. Schmidt K. Mayer B. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 16735-16745Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 22Gorren A.C.F. Schrammel A. Schmidt K. Mayer B. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4360-4366Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), we have calculated that the upper limit of the K I value for the binding of 5-methyl-H4biopterin is approximately 5 μm. This calculated binding constant is about 20-fold higher than the EC50 value obtained in the arginine-to-citrulline conversion assay, indicating that the K D for high affinity H4biopterin binding to nNOS may be as low as 50 pm. There are numerous reports demonstrating NO release from intact cells, but it has proven difficult in the past to identify NO as a product of the NOS reaction. Thus far, NO formation by isolated NOS has only been detected in the presence of scavengers of either NO or superoxide. Thus, enzymatic NO formation was apparent when NOS activity was assayed as a hemoglobin-to-methemoglobin conversion (7Klatt P. Schmidt K. Uray G. Mayer B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14781-14787Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or in spin trapping electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy experiments performed with excess Fe2+-N-methyl-d-glucamine dithiocarbamate as a NO trap (37Xia Y. Zweier J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12705-12710Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Besides NO scavengers, the presence of the O⨪2 scavenger SOD was also shown to switch the outcome of the NOS reaction toward detectable free NO (29Mayer B. Klatt P. Werner E.R. Schmidt K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 655-659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 31Schmidt H.H.H.W. Hofmann H. Schindler U. Shutenko Z.S. Cunningham D.D. Feelisch M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14492-14497Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). Even though those results strongly favor the view that NOS does indeed form NO, it has remained unclear whether or not NOS would also make NO in the absence of scavengers which, with the exception of SOD, are not present in cells. Our results demonstrate for the first time that nNOS forms free NO in the absence of scavengers when the enzyme is reconstituted with the autooxidation-resistant 5-methyl analog of H4biopterin instead of the natural cofactor. The results unequivocally identify free NO as the initial product of the NOS reaction and provide further evidence for our proposal that the failure to detect NO formation by purified nNOS is a consequence of NO inactivation by O⨪2 formed during autooxidation of exogenously added H4biopterin (29Mayer B. Klatt P. Werner E.R. Schmidt K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 655-659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Unlike l-citrulline formation, NO production was not stimulated in a biphasic manner but gradually increased when the concentration of 5-methyl-H4biopterin was increased from 5 μmto 1 mm. This concentration range is clearly between the concentrations required for high affinity and low affinity activation of l-citrulline formation (see Fig. 2). Interestingly, the stoichiometry of NADP+ and l-citrulline formation showed that the presence of 0.1 mm5-methyl-H4biopterin was sufficient for virtually complete coupling of NADPH and l-arginine oxidation. These results may indicate that saturation of one pterin site of dimeric nNOS with 5-methyl-H4biopterin leads to inhibition of heme reduction and associated superoxide formation by the pterin-free subunit. Although this hypothesis appears to provide a reliable explanation for the formation of free NO by the enzyme subsaturated with 5-methyl-H4biopterin, additional studies are needed to settle the complex relationship between biphasic 5-methyl-H4biopterin binding and NOS activity. A great deal of published circumstantial evidence supports our early hypothesis that one step of the NOS reaction resembles the hydroxylation of aromatic amino acids, an enzymatic reaction in which H4biopterin functions as a donor of electrons required for reductive O2 activation (5Mayer B. John M. Heinzel B. Werner E.R. Wachter H. Schultz G. Böhme E. FEBS Lett. 1991; 288: 187-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). Thus, stimulation of NOS activity is only observed with fully reduced, i.e.tetrahydro, pterins, whereas dihydro compounds are inhibitory (9Klatt P. Schmid M. Leopold E. Schmidt K. Werner E.R. Mayer B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13861-13866Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Presta A. Siddhanta U. Wu C.Q. Sennequier N. Huang L.X. Abu-Soud H.M. Erzurum S. Stuehr D.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 298-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the redox-inactive N5-deaza analog of 6-methyl-tetrahydropterin was found to inhibit H4biopterin-supported NOS activity, although the parent compound was an active cofactor (19Hevel J.M. Marletta M.A. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 7160-7165Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Similarly, the 4-amino analog of H4biopterin, an inhibitor of dihydropteridine reductase-catalyzed pterin redox cycling (20Werner E.R. Pitters E. Schmidt K. Wachter H. Werner-Felmayer G. Mayer B. Biochem. J. 1996; 320: 193-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), potently inhibited both steps of the NOS reaction, although it produced allosteric effects identical to those of H4biopterin (17Pfeiffer S. Gorren A.C.F. Pitters E. Schmidt K. Werner E.R. Mayer B. Biochem. J. 1997; 328: 349-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 18Mayer B. Wu C. Gorren A.C.F. Pfeiffer S. Schmidt K. Clark P. Stuehr D.J. Werner E.R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 8422-8427Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Finally, a recent study demonstrated that the rate of the NOS reaction is increased by binding of non-heme iron, indicating that an additional metal center might cooperate with H4biopterin in enzyme catalysis (39Perry J.M. Marletta M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11101-11106Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, compared with the finding that 5-methyl-H4biopterin does not stimulate phenylalanine hydroxylase, 3E. R. Werner, H.-J. Habisch, A. C. F. Gorren, L. Canevari, K. Schmidt, G. Werner-Felmayer, and B. Mayer, manuscript in preparation. the present data unequivocally show that the same redox chemistry of the pterin is not required in the NOS reaction. This constitutes conclusive functional evidence that the pterin in NOS is not the site of O2 activation. Although the redox potential of 5-methyl-H4biopterin is different from that of H4biopterin, 4A. C. F. Gorren, A. J. Kungl, K. Schmidt, E. R. Werner, and B. Mayer, submitted for publication. the 5-methyl compound can still undergo certain redox reactions that are currently being investigated in our laboratory. Thus, at the present time, we cannot rule out that the pterin cofactor, in addition to its allosteric functions, interacts with the heme or another metal center of NOS through an as yet unrecognized redox chemistry."

J. D. (1997) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 94, 9596–9601). The experiments indicate that only peptide bonds close to a bound Fe2+ ion are cleaved, and provide evidence on proximity of the different cleavage positions in the native enzyme. A sequence HFIH near trans-membrane segment M3 appears to be involved in Fe2+ binding. Previously we hypothesized that E 2 and E 1conformations are characterized by formation or relaxation of interactions within the α subunit at or near highly conserved sequences, TGES in the minor cytoplasmic loop and CSDK, MVTGD, and VNDSPALKK in the major cytoplasmic loop. This concept has been tested by examining iron-catalyzed cleavage in both non-phosphorylated and phosphorylated conformations and effects of phosphate, vanadate, and ouabain. The results imply that both E 1 ↔E 2 and E 1P ↔E 2P transitions are indeed associated with formation and relaxation of interactions between cytoplasmic domains, comprising the minor loop plus N-terminal tail leading into M1 and major loop, respectively. Furthermore, it appears that either non-covalently or covalently bound phosphate bind near CSDK and MVTGD, and Mg2+ ions may bind to residues within TGES and VNDSPALKK and to bound phosphate. Thus cytoplasmic domain interactions seem to occur within or near the active site. We discuss the relationship between structural changes in the cytoplasmic domain and movements of trans-membrane segments that lead to cation transport.

Presumably conformation-dependent formation and relaxation of domain interactions underlie energy transduction in all P-type pumps. The molecular mechanism whereby Na,K-ATPase transduces the free energy of hydrolysis of ATP into active transport of Na+and K+ ions is unknown. We have a wealth of knowledge on transport reactions, covalent phosphorylation,E 1/E 2 conformational transitions, and cation occlusion, embodied in the Post-Albers kinetic mechanism (see Ref. 1Glynn I.M. Karlish S.J.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1990; 59: 171-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Active cation transport involves Nacyt-dependent phosphorylation from ATP, Na+ movement coupled to E 1P →E 2P, Kexc-activated dephosphorylation, K+ movement coupled toE 2(K) → E 1. Knowledge of the structural basis for energy transduction is meager due to lack of information on molecular structure. The best structure of Na,K-ATPase at 20–25-Å resolution reveals only the overall shape of the protein and distribution of mass of α and β subunits (2Maunsbach A.B. Skriver E. Hebert H. Soc. Gen. Physiol. 1991; 46: 159-172PubMed Google Scholar). Recent cryoelectron microscopy studies of Ca-ATPase and H-ATPase demonstrate the overall shape at 8-Å resolution, including “head”, “neck,” and membrane sectors, including 10 trans-membrane α-helical rods, most of which are tilted at an angle to the membrane (3Zhang P. Toyashima C. Yonekura K. Green N.M. Stokes D.L. Nature. 1998; 392: 835-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar, 4Auer M. Scarborough G.A. Kühlbrandt W. Nature. 1998; 392: 840-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). The topological organization with 10 trans-membrane segments confirms that shown by a variety of techniques (5Møller J.V. Juul B. Le Maire M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1286: 1-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar). Biochemical and molecular techniques are providing much information on residues involved in cation occlusion within trans-membrane segments (6Karlish S.J.D. Goldshleger R. Stein W.D. Proc. Natl.

Juul B. Le Maire M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1286: 1-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar). These studies indicate the necessity for interactions between the ATP sites and cation occlusion sites. These interactions are mediated by E 1 ↔E 2 conformational transitions, which have been studied extensively using proteolytic digestion, fluorescent probes, ligand binding, etc. (see Ref. 10Robinson J.D. Pratap P.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1154: 83-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar for a review and references). The fact that probes bound at different sites report theE 1 ↔ E 2 transition implies that substantial structural changes must occur. However, the nature of those changes has been largely obscure. All P-type pumps contain the conserved cytoplasmic sequences TGES in the minor loop between M2 and M3, MVTGD in the major loop, and TGDGVNDSPALKK in the so-called “hinge region” before M5 (5Møller J.V. Juul B. Le Maire M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1286: 1-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar). Proteolytic cleavage and site-directed mutagenesis in these sequences usually stabilizeE 1 conformations, implying an involvement in the conformational transitions (see Refs. 5Møller J.V. Juul B. Le Maire M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1286: 1-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar and 8Andersen J.P. Vilsen B.

Based on functional effects of mutations and proteolytic cleavages in the β-strand minor cytoplasmic loop of sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca-ATPase, an interaction between the minor and major cytoplasmic loop near the phosphorylation site was proposed earlier (11Green N.M. Stokes D.L. Acta Physiol. Scand. 1992; 152: 59-68Google Scholar). For yeast H-ATPase, mutations within the minor loop suggested a similar conclusion (12Harris S.L. Perlin D.S. Seto-Young D.

Recently, we have described specific iron-catalyzed or copper-catalyzed oxidative cleavage of renal Na,K-ATPase (13Goldshleger R. Karlish S.J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The process seems to involve a site-specific mechanism in which peptide bonds close to the bound metals are cleaved, presumably by OH radicals generated locally by the Fenton reaction or a reactive metal-peroxyl derivative (16Stadtman E.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 797-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (1270) Google Scholar, 17Rana T.M. Meares C.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Because more than one peptide bond can be cleaved from the same metal site, this technique provides information on interacting segments of individual subunits or neighboring subunits (unlike proteolytic cleavage). Incubation of Na,K-ATPase with Fe2+/ascorbate/H2O2 induces specific cleavage of the α subunit at the cytoplasmic surface without cleaving the β subunit (13Goldshleger R. Karlish S.J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9596-9601Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Copper-catalyzed oxidative cleavage occurs at the extracellular surface and both α and β subunits are cleaved (15Bar Shimon M. Goldshleger R. Karlish S.J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34190-34195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Iron-catalyzed cleavages are very sensitive to the conformational state (13Goldshleger R. Karlish S.J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9596-9601Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In (E 2) or E 2(Rb) conformations, we observed four major and two minor fragments of the α subunit. In E 1 orE 1Na conformations, cleavage was much slower and only one major cleavage was observed. Positions of cleavages were either identified exactly by N-terminal sequencing or, for fragments with blocked N termini, approximately using sequence-specific antibodies. In E 2 conformations only, cleavages (identified by short sequences at or near the N termini) were found at214ESE in the minor loop between M2 and M3, near367CSDK after M4 which includes the phosphorylated Asp369, near 608MVTGD in the major loop, and at712VNDS in the “hinge” region before M5. In eitherE 2 or E 1 conformations, a cleavage was seen near 263IATL, before M3. The observations suggested strongly that peptide bonds are cleaved with a probability depending on their proximity to a bound Fe3+ or Fe2+ ion, and thus imply that the different cleavage points are also in proximity to each other. Several cleavages lie in or near the highly conserved cytoplasmic sequences, suggesting that these sequences mediate mutual interactions. We proposed that, inE 2 conformations, the minor and major loops interact near the conserved sequences while, inE 1 conformations, the loops separate (13Goldshleger R. Karlish S.J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9596-9601Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). This paper extends our observations on iron-catalyzed cleavages in two ways. First, we have obtained further evidence for the site-specific mechanism. Second, we have looked at iron-catalyzed cleavages in both phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated conformations and effects of inhibitors. The results provide novel information on the energy transduction mechanism. Na,K-ATPase, with specific activities of 12–17 units/mg protein, was prepared from pig kidney (20Jørgensen P.L. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 156: 29-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) and was stored at −70 °C in a solution of 250 mm sucrose, 25 mmhistidine, pH 7.2, and 1 mm EDTA (Tris). Rat axolemma microsomes (2–3 units/mg enzyme) prepared as in Ref. 21Sweadner K.J. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 156: 65-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar or rat kidney microsomes (3–4 units/mg protein) were prepared as in Ref. 20Jørgensen P.L. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 156: 29-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar. Prior to incubation with Fe2+/ascorbate/H2O2, the microsomal membrane preparations (1.5 mg/ml) were pretreated with sodium deoxycholate 1.2 mg/ml for 15 min at 20 °C, washed twice, and resuspended in a solution containing 10 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.2. Suspensions of pig kidney Na,K-ATPase (0.1–1 mg/ml) or rat microsomal preparations (1 mg/ml) were incubated at 20 °C with freshly prepared solutions of 5 mmascorbate (Tris) plus 5 mm H2O2, without or with added FeSO4. To arrest the reaction, 5–10 mm EDTA or 5-fold concentrated gel sample buffer with 5 mm EDTA was added. Samples were assayed for Na,K-ATPase activity or applied to gels, respectively. Procedures for running of 7.5% Tricine SDS-PAGE, including precautions prior to sequencing, electroblotting to PVDF paper, immunoblots, and microsequencing of fragments have been described in detail (22Capasso J.M.

Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8668-8679Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Anti-K1012–Y1016, referred to as “anti-KETYY,” was used to detect fragments of the α subunit. Immunoblots were stained with diaminobenzidine with metal ion enhancement (15–20 μg of protein/lane) (24Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988: 509Google Scholar) or developed by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL; 3–5 μg of protein/lane) using anti-rabbit IgG horseradish peroxidase conjugate and the protocol supplied with ECL reagents from the 1998 Amersham Pharmacia Biotech catalogue. For quantification of bands, the stained PVDF paper or developed x-ray films were scanned with a Bio-Rad GS-690 imaging densitometer and analyzed with Bio-Rad Multi-Analyst software (version 1.01). For quantification of Coomassie-stained α subunit the band was cut out of the gel, and optical density of Coomassie stain extracted into 1% SDS solution was measured at 595 nm (13Goldshleger R. Karlish S.J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9596-9601Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Non-linear curve-fitting was performed using Enzfitter (Elsevier-Biosoft). For SDS-PAGE, all reagents were electrophoresis-grade from Bio-Rad. Tris (ultra pure) was from Bio-Lab, Jerusalem. l-(+)-ascorbic acid (catalogue no. 100127), 30% H2O2 (catalogue no. 822287), and α-chymotrypsin (catalogue no. 2307) were from Merck. Phosphocreatine, P6502, creatine phosphokinase P3755. and oligomycin O4876 were from Sigma. All other reagents were of analytical grade. Fig.1 presents an immunoblot using anti-KETYY to detect fragments produced in media containing different proportions of K+ and Na+ ions (sum 150 mm). In 150 mm K+ (E 2(K),left), we observed five major fragments referred to as:a, near M1; b, at 214ESE;c, near 283HFIH (previously referred to as near IATL, see below); d, near 608MVTGD; ande, at 712VNDS. ApparentM r values are 91.3, 80.6, 73.4, 38.2, and 26.3 kDa, respectively. By comparison with previous experiments done in low ionic strength media (13Goldshleger R. Karlish S.J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9596-9601Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), the cleavage near 367CSDK was largely suppressed, while that near M1 was more prominent. About half the α subunit was cleaved in these conditions. As K+ was replaced by Na+ ions, cleavage at ESE, near MVTGD, and at VNDS was progressively suppressed, essentially completely at 150 mm Na+ (E 1Na,right), while in parallel, the cleavages near M1 and HFIH were amplified. A similar change of pattern was observed upon transfer of the enzyme from low ionic strength (10 mm Tris, pH 7,E 2) to high ionic strength media (10 mm Tris, pH 7, 300 mm choline chloride, E 1). Bound Fe2+ ion is predicted to be in contact with more residues in E 2 than in E 1forms (see Ref. 13Goldshleger R. Karlish S.J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9596-9601Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar and model in Fig. 11), and thus the Fe2+should bind more tightly in E 2 forms. Fig.2 depicts the relationship between Fe2+ ion concentration and cleavage of the α subunit and inactivation of Na,K-ATPase activity, in Rb+- and Na+-containing media (E 2(Rb) orE 1Na, respectively). The curves are fitted well by simple hyperbolas with K 0.5 values of 0.57 and 3.49 μm for cleavage of the α subunit and 0.20 and 1.16 μm for inactivation of Na,K-ATPase, respectively. As discussed previously (13Goldshleger R. Karlish S.J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9596-9601Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 15Bar Shimon M. Goldshleger R. Karlish S.J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34190-34195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), the 2–3-fold lowerK 0.5 value for inactivation of Na,K-ATPase compared with cleavage could imply that oxidative reactions occur in addition to chain cleavage and inactivate the enzyme. In any event, the 5–6-fold lower values of K 0.5 in theE 2(Rb) compared with theE 1Na conformation, by either measure, are compatible with the prediction.Figure 2Fe2+ concentration dependence of cleavage of the α subunit and inactivation of Na,K-ATPase activity in Rb- or Na+-containing media. Na,K-ATPase (0.1 mg/ml) suspended in a medium containing 10 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.2, and 30 mm RbCl or NaCl, and was incubated with Fe2+ at varying concentrations and 5 mm ascorbate and H2O2 for 2 min at 20 °C. Samples were either taken for determination of the Na,K-ATPase activity or applied to a gel (45 μg of protein/lane), and the α subunit was quantified as described under “Experimental Procedures.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Fe2+ ions can replace Mg2+ ions in catalysis of Na-dependent phosphorylation (25Fukushima Y. Post R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 6853-6872Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and thus the question arose whether Fe2+ ions bind to the Mg2+ site and catalyze cleavage from this site. Fig.3 depicts the cleavages at three concentrations of Fe2+ (0, 1.5, and 15 μmadded in addition to the 0.05 μm contaminant in the solutions), and Mg2+ from 0 to 7 mm. As the Mg2+ ion concentration was raised, the cleavages at ESE, near CSDK, near MVTGD, and at VNDS were progressively suppressed, while cleavages near M1 and near HFIH were amplified (Fig. 3 A). Thus, Mg2+ ions stabilized an E 1conformation, noticeable especially at 7 mm. However, quantification of amounts of the fragments, by scanning the immunoblots, do not reveal any systematic influence of Fe2+concentration on effects of Mg2+ ions, as seen in the examples in Fig. 3 B. Hence, Fe2+ and Mg2+ ions do not compete and must bind at different sites. In Ref. 13Goldshleger R. Karlish S.J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9596-9601Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, we speculated that histidine residues in the sequence HFIH near M3 are involved in Fe2+ binding. To test this hypothesis, and also the site-specific mechanism, we compared cleavage of rat axolemma and rat kidney enzymes. Rat axolemma enzyme consists of about 65% α3, 25% α2, and only 10% α1 isoforms, while kidney enzyme is essentially all α1 isoform (26Urayama O. Sweadner K.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 156: 796-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 27Sweadner K.J. Biochim. Biophys Acta. 1989; 988: 185-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (868) Google Scholar, 28Munzer J.S. Daly S.E. Jewell-Motz E.A. Lingrel J.B. Blostein R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16668-16676Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In α3 and α2 isoforms, the second histidine is replaced by a glutamine,i.e. HFIQ. The experiment in Fig.4 A compared the time course of cleavage of axolemma and kidney enzymes. For axolemma enzyme, the cleavage near HFIH was largely absent and that at VNDS was less prominent, while the cleavages at ESE and near MVTGD were similar to those of the kidney enzyme. For axolemma, a small amount of the fragment with N terminus near CSDK also appeared, although this is less certain because the control itself contains a minor fragment with the same mobility. (The axolemma fragments cleaved near MVTGD and at VNDS have slightly lower mobility than equivalent fragments of kidney (41.8versus 39.1 and 29 versus 27 kDa, respectively). However, this cannot be taken to indicate that the cleavage sites are different, since intact α3 and α2 also have a slightly lower mobility than the α1 isoform, even though theM r value of rat α1 (112, 566) is slightly higher than α2 (111, 580) or α3 (111, 735) (27Sweadner K.J. Biochim. Biophys Acta. 1989; 988: 185-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (868) Google Scholar, 29Shull G.E. Greeb J. Lingrel J.B. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 8125-8132Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar).) Fig.4 B depicts cleavage of axolemma enzyme in Rb+- or Na+-containing media at different concentrations of added Fe2+ ions. The two major fragments, with N termini ESE and near MVTGD, increased in amount as Fe2+ was raised progressively to 10 μm, as did the minor fragments. In parallel experiments with axolemma and kidney enzyme (data not shown), it was found that cleavage of axolemma enzyme required significantly higher concentrations of added Fe2+ ions. For example, theK 0.5 values for appearance of the fragment with N terminus near MVTGD were 1 ± 0.2 μm for kidney and 1.95 ± 0.2 μm for axolemma, respectively. In the sodium-containing medium, cleavage of both the axolemma and kidney enzymes was suppressed and the fragment with N terminus ESE and the fragment near MVTGD were not observed. In summary, axolemma and kidney enzymes differ in specificity of the cleavages and affinity for Fe2+ ions, whereas the E 2(Rb) →E 1Na transition affects cleavage essentially similarly. Fig. 5 depicts iron-catalyzed cleavage of the pig kidney Na,K-ATPase in conditions of Na-dependent phosphorylation from ATP. A low concentration of ATP (5 μm) was used together with a regenerating system. In the presence of 140 mm Na+ ions, 0.5 mm Mg2+ ions, and the regenerating system, we observed cleavages typical for the E 1Na form (N termini near M1 and HFIH). Upon addition of ATP and oligomycin, the pump should be phosphorylated and, due to block of theE 1P → E 2P conformational transition (30Fahn S. Koval G.J. Albers W. J. Biol. Chem. 1966; 241: 1882-1889Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the predominant form should beE 1P. This condition indeed produced cleavages typical of an E 1 conformation. In the absence of oligomycin, the combination of ATP/Na+/Mg2+phosphorylates the pump, but the predominant form should now beE 2P. In this condition, we observed two additional cleavages typical of an E 2 form (N termini ESE and VNDS), but, strikingly, the prominent cleavage near MVTGD normally seen for unphosphorylated E 2 orE 2(K) forms did not appear. The cleavage near CSDK was not seen, but this was expected in the high ionic strength medium. Addition of a low concentration of Rb+ (2 mm) to the medium containing ATP/Na+/Mg2+ accelerates dephosphorylation from high affinity extracellular sites, leading toE 2(Rb) as the predominant form. In this condition, the fragments with N termini ESE and VNDS were somewhat amplified, but again the cleavage near MVTGD did not appear. The latter result was surprising because the cleavage near MVTGD is very prominent in the E 2(Rb) form generated directly by adding Rb+ (K+) ions to the enzyme (see Ref. 13Goldshleger R. Karlish S.J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9596-9601Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar and this paper). The cleavage pattern in the medium containing 2 mm Rb+, 150 mm Na+, and 0.5 mm Mg2+, without ATP, shows that the enzyme remained in the E 1 form. Thus, suppression of the cleavage near MVTGD in the presence of Rb+ ions and ATP/Na+/Mg2+ was associated with formation of the E 2(Rb) form via dephosphorylation ofE 2P. It seemed possible that ATP itself or the products of its hydrolysis, ADP and Pi, were responsible for suppressing the cleavage near MVTGD, and thus a number of control experiments were performed. In low ionic strength media (E 2), the cleavage near MVTGD was prominent, but neither ATP nor ADP at 5 μm had any effect (data not shown). We calculated that, during incubation with ATP/Mg2+/Na+/Rb+ in Fig. 5, 200–250 μm Pi could accumulate. Therefore, we looked for effects on cleavages of Pi(Tris), 0.1–1 mm, without or with Mg2+ and Rb+ions (Fig. 6). Addition of Pito a medium of low ionic strength indeed suppressed the cleavages near CSDK and MVTGD, without significantly affecting other cleavages (Fig.6 A). In this condition, one could expect the enzyme to be in an E 2·P form, with Pi bound non-covalently. In combination with 1 mm Mg2+ions, addition of 2 mm Pi also partially suppressed the cleavages at ESE and VNDS (Fig. 6 B, see legend for quantification based on scans). When added alone, Mg2+ ions at 1 mm or lower concentrations had little or no effect (see also Fig. 3). The presence of 1 mmRb+ ions did not alter the effect of Pi but prevented partial suppression of cleavages at ESE and VNDS by the combination of Pi and Mg2+ ions (Fig.6 C, see legend for quantification). Another effect of the combination of Pi and Mg2+ ions was observed in experiments that examined Pi concentration dependence of suppression of the cleavage near MVTGD at 0–1 mmMg2+. Data from scans of gels (Fig.7) show that lower concentrations of Pi were required in the presence of Mg2+ ions. In the presence of 1 mm Mg2+ and 2 mm Pi, a substantial fraction of the enzyme should be phosphorylated as a form referred to asE 2i-P, which is insensitive to Rb+(K+) ions (31Post R.L. Toda G. Rogers F.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 691-701Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the presence of Mg2+, Pi, and Rb+, a major fraction should not be phosphorylated (E 2(Rb)·Pi) and a minor faction could be phosphorylated in a Rb+(K+)-bound form (E 2-P·Rb) (31Post R.L. Toda G. Rogers F.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 691-701Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). An economical explanation of the results in Figs. Figure 5, Figure 6, Figure 7 is that either non-covalently bound phosphate or covalently bound phosphate, derived from ATP or Pi, directly interfere with the cleavages near CSDK and MVTGD. In addition the cleavages at ESE and VNDS are somewhat suppressed in the phosphorylated forms (see “Discussion” and Fig. 11).Figure 7Co-operative effect of Pi and Mg2+ ions in suppression of the specific cleavage near MVTGD. Na,K-ATPase (1 mg/ml) was suspended in a medium containing 10 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.2, and 0, 0.1, 1, or 5 mm Pi(Tris) and 0, 0.1, or 1 mmMgCl2. The ionic strength was maintained constant by addition of choline chloride as necessary. The suspension was incubated with 5 μm FeSO4 and 5 mmascorbate/H2O2 for 2 min at 20 °C. The diaminobenzidine-stained PVDF paper was scanned and analyzed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The figure depicts the quantity of the fragment near MVTGD at different Piconcentrations as a percentage of that without Pi, at the MgCl2 concentration of 0, 0.1, and 1 mm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Figs. 8 and9 present some paradoxical observations. As seen in Fig. 8, the presence of Mg2+/ouabain somewhat suppressed cleavages near MVTGD and at VNDS, while in the presence of Pi/Mg2+/ouabain all cleavages were suppressed except the two near M1 and HFIH. Similarly, with vanadate (2 μm)/Mg2+, only the two cleavages near M1 and HFIH were observed. Thus, the cleavage pattern with Pi/Mg2+/ouabain and vanadate/Mg2+was characteristic of E 1 forms, although the enzyme should be in an E 2 form in both conditions (see also Fig. 10). Fig. 9presents another surprising finding with Pi. With the usual order of addition of the components, first equilibration of enzyme with Pi and then incubation with Fe2+/ascorbate/H2O2, the effect of Pi was as described in Fig. 6 A. However, if the enzyme was preincubated with both Pi and Fe2+prior to addition of ascorbate/H2O2, the cleavages at ESE and VNDS were also largely suppressed, although those near M1 and HFIH were largely unchanged. The development of this effect is seen in Fig. 9. After 20 min of preincubation of Pi with Fe2+, prior to addition of ascorbate/H2O2, the cleavage pattern was similar to that with Pi/Mg2+/ouabain or vanadate/Mg2+.Figure 9Effect of preincubation of Piwith Fe2+ ions on iron-catalyzed cleavage of the α subunit.

Cell. 1997; 91: 457-466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar, 7Jacob Anderson J.S. Parker R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1497-1506Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). Yeast mRNAs also decay by alternate pathways under some circumstances. For example, some mRNAs decay by an endonucleolytic cleavage event that is the rate-limiting step in their turnover because the cleavage is independent of poly(A) shortening (2Beelman C.A. Parker R. Cell. 1995; 81: 179-183Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar). Additionally, mRNAs containing nonsense codons decay by a pathway that involves deadenylation-independent decay processes (8Muhlrad D. Parker R. Nature. 1994; 370: 578-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar, 9Ruiz-Echervarria M.J. Czaplinski K. Peltz S.W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 433-438Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar).By contrast, decay pathways in mammalian cells are not as well understood. Like yeast mRNAs, many mammalian mRNAs decay initially by exoribonucleolytic shortening of the poly(A) tract. However, subsequent decay steps involving the mRNA body generally occur so quickly that decay intermediates are not detected, thus precluding further analyses of decay pathways. Nonetheless, some recent indirect evidence suggests that mammalian mRNAs may decay by a 5′-3′ pathway. For example, a polymerase chain reaction-based analysis involving simultaneous comparisons of poly(A) tract lengths and presence of a cap structure revealed that only mRNAs with short poly(A) tracts lacked a cap structure (10Couttet P. Fromont-Racine M. Steel D. Pictet R. Grange T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5628-5633Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). This suggests that decapping of mammalian mRNAs occurs once deadenylation activities shorten the poly(A) tract to some critical length. Additional evidence for a 5′-3′ decay pathway in mammalian cells is the identification of a murine XRN1 homologue that functions in S. cerevisiae (11Bashkirov V.I. Scherthan H. Solinger J.A. Buerstedde J.-M. Heyer W.-D. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 761-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Together, these data suggest that 5′-3′ mRNA decay processes may be conserved in eukaryotes.A 3′ to 5′ decay pathway for mammalian, polyadenylated mRNAs is also likely for several reasons. (i) HeLa cells, a human cervical carcinoma cell line, contain a complex homologous to the yeast exosome (6Mitchell P. Petfalski E. Shevchenko A. Mann M. Tollervey D. Cell. 1997; 91: 457-466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar). (ii) Human H4 histone mRNA, which lacks a poly(A) tract, decays 3′-5′ in cells (12Ross J. Peltz S.W. Kobs G. Brewer G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 4362-4371Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Degradation is likely because of an exoribonuclease that pauses within the 3′-terminal stem-loop structure, generating progressively shorter decay intermediates that lack 5 nt, then 12 nt, from the 3′ end (13Caruccio N. Ross J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31814-31821Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). (iii) In vitro mRNA decay extracts prepared from mammalian cells degrade labile mRNAs 3′-5′ by rapid deadenylation followed by generation of 3′-terminal decay intermediates (reviewed in Refs. 14Ross J. Brawerman G. Belasco J. Control of Messenger RNA Stability. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1993: 417-448Crossref Google Scholar and 15DeMaria C.T. Brewer G. Jeanteur P. Progress in Molecular and Subcellular Biology. Springer-Verlag, Berlin, Germany1997: 65-91Google Scholar). The same enzymes operative in vivo presumably generate these intermediatesin vitro. However, detection of such mRNA decay intermediates in cells has proven difficult (1Ross J. Microbiol. Rev. 1995; 59: 16-95Crossref Google Scholar, 14Ross J. Brawerman G. Belasco J. Control of Messenger RNA Stability. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1993: 417-448Crossref Google Scholar). Thus, an unanswered question is whether 3′-5′ decay of polyadenylated mRNAs occurs in mammalian cells as indicated by 3′-terminal decay intermediates. Here, I have addressed this question by comparing the decay of c-myc mRNA in vitro and in cells. c-myc mRNA, which encodes the Myc transcription factor and oncoprotein, is a labile, polyadenylated transcript (reviewed in Ref. 16Schiavi S.C. Belasco J.G. Greenberg M.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1114: 95-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). In vitro, it rapidly decays by a sequential pathway involving rapid deadenylation to a deadenylated or oligoadenylated form; this is followed by degradation of the mRNA body generating easily observed 3′-terminal decay intermediates. Its decay then continues in a 3′-5′ direction (17Brewer G. Ross J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 1697-1708Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). c-mycmRNA decays by rapid deadenylation in vivo as well. Also observed is a 3′-terminal decay intermediate that appears to have a similar 3′ end as an intermediate generated during in vitrodecay. These data provide strong evidence that a 3′-5′ pathway contributes to decay of c-myc mRNA, and perhaps other polyadenylated mRNAs, in mammalian cells.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESRestriction enzymes and RNasin were obtained from Promega Corp.

For each time point, cells were harvested and total RNA was prepared by lysis of cells, phenol extraction of proteins, and pelleting of RNA through a pad of CsCl as described (12Ross J. Peltz S.W. Kobs G. Brewer G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 4362-4371Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). RNA concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically by absorption at 260 nm. Ten micrograms of each RNA sample were subjected to oligonucleotide-directed RNase H cleavage using an antisense c-myc oligodeoxynucleotide (5′-CAAGTTCATAGGTGATTGCTG-3′) which anneals approximately 400 nt upstream of poly(A) site 2 (17Brewer G. Ross J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 1697-1708Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Deadenylated RNAs were preparedin vitro by incubating the time-zero RNA sample with oligo(dT)12–18 and RNase H. The RNA samples were fractionated in a denaturing agarose gel and blotted to a membrane. The γ-globin mRNA or the 3′-end of c-myc mRNA was detected by incubating the membrane with the respective32P-labeled probes, washing the membrane, and exposing it to x-ray film as described (17Brewer G. Ross J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 1697-1708Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). This RNase H mapping procedure permits high resolution analysis of cleavage products at the 3′ end of c-myc mRNA (20Brewer G. Ross J.

Promega Notes. 1992; 40: 11-13Google Scholar).Oligo(dT)-cellulose Chromatography of Cellular RNATen milligrams of RNA purified from 5 × 108 exponentially growing K562 cells was heat-denatured and loaded onto a column containing 400 mg of oligo(dT)-cellulose in column binding buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 0.5 m sodium chloride, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate). The flow-through fraction was loaded onto the column a second time. The column was then washed with 10 ml of column binding buffer. RNA bound to the column was eluted with 10 ml of column elution buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 0.05% sodium dodecyl sulfate). The flow-through fraction and washes were pooled and defined as the unbound fraction. RNA from both the unbound fraction (i.e.poly(A−) RNA) and the eluted fraction (i.e.poly(A+) RNA) was precipitated with ethanol, recovered by centrifugation, and quantified spectrophotometrically by absorption at 260 nm.Radiolabeling of ProbesThe same c-myc probe was used for both RNase protection assays and for the RNA blot (described above). It was prepared by in vitro transcription ofSspI-digested plasmid pSP65myc(CLARI) (17Brewer G. Ross J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 1697-1708Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar) using SP6 RNA polymerase and [α-32P]UTP (>800 Ci/mmol). The probe used for detection of human γ-globin mRNA on the RNA blot was prepared by radiolabeling plasmid pJW151 (containing the human γ-globin cDNA; gift from J. Ross) by the random-primer method using [α-32P]dCTP (>3,000 Ci/mmol) (22Feinberg A.P. Vogelstein B. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 132: 6-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (16567) Google Scholar). A radiolabeled probe for detection of human H4 histone mRNA by nuclease S1 mapping was prepared by 3′-end labeling of plasmid pHh4A digested with NcoI as described (12Ross J. Peltz S.W. Kobs G. Brewer G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 4362-4371Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). A radiolabeled probe for detection of human γ-globin mRNA by nuclease S1 mapping was prepared by 3′-end labeling of plasmid pDCY2 digested withEcoRI as described (17Brewer G. Ross J. Mol. Cell.

Ross J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 1697-1708Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Human H4 histone and γ-globin mRNAs were analyzed by nuclease S1 mapping using 3′-end radiolabeled probes as described (12Ross J. Peltz S.W. Kobs G. Brewer G. Mol. Cell.

Bands were quantified by laser densitometry.Preparation of Cellular ExtractsPolysomes and the 130,000 × g postribosomal supernatant (S130) were prepared from K562 cells using Buffer A (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 1 mm magnesium acetate, 1.5 mm potassium acetate, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 1 μg each of leupeptin and pepstatin A per ml, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) as described (17Brewer G. Ross J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 1697-1708Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar).In Vitro mRNA Decay ReactionsIn vitromRNA decay reactions were incubated at 37 °C in 50-μl reactions containing 1.4 A 260 units of polysomes in a buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 5 mm magnesium acetate, 100 mm potassium acetate, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm creatine phosphate, 0.7 units of creatine phosphokinase, 1 mm ATP, 0.4 mm GTP, 0.1 mm spermine, and 40 units of RNasin. Some reactions were supplemented with 300 μg of S130 proteins. RNA was purified for each time point, and c-mycmRNA was analyzed by an RNase P1+T1 protection assay as described above.RESULTSCell-free mRNA decay systems degrade mRNAs via a 3′-5′ pathway involving gradual removal of the poly(A) tract followed by 3′-terminal degradation of the mRNA body. To examine the decay pathway of c-myc mRNA in cells, exponentially growing K562 cells were cultured in the presence of actinomycin D to inhibit new transcription. At various time points, cells were harvested for purification of total RNA. Decay of c-myc mRNA was investigated by a modified Northern blot procedure that involves oligonucleotide-directed RNase H cleavage of c-myc mRNA in purified RNA samples, prior to the gel electrophoresis and blotting steps. c-myc mRNA is cleaved approximately 400 nt from its 3′ end by this procedure Thus, the RNase H mapping assay permits examination of 3′-end decay at a resolution higher than that allowed by traditional Northern blotting (17Brewer G. Ross J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 1697-1708Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 20Brewer G. Ross J. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 181: 202-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 21Brewer G. Promega Notes. 1992; 40: 11-13Google Scholar). Fig.1 shows the results of this analysis. The time-zero point showed a heterogeneous smear (Fig. 1, top panel, lane 1). Additional treatment of the time-zero RNA with oligo(dT)12–18 and RNase H reduced this smear to a single band (top panel, lane 8). This indicated that the smear was because of heterogeneous lengths of poly(A) tracts within the population of cellular c-myc mRNA molecules. With increasing time following inhibition of transcription, the poly(A) tracts overall became shorter. By 90 min, most c-mycmRNA molecules were completely deadenylated or had short adenylate tracts (Fig. 1, top panel; compare lane 6 withlane 8). Rapid deadenylation of c-myc mRNA was specific because the poly(A) tract of γ-globin was not rapidly shortened, and the mRNA was stable over the 3-h time course (Fig.1, lower panel). Thus, c-myc mRNA was rapidly deadenylated in cells generating deadenylated or oligoadenylated mRNA molecules. These results are consistent with those from earlier studies showing rapid deadenylation of c-mycmRNA in cell-free decay reactions (17Brewer G. Ross J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 1697-1708Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar).Decay of c-myc mRNA in cell-free extracts also results in the formation of abundant decay products mapping to the 3′-UTR (17Brewer G. Ross J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 1697-1708Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). By contrast, none were obvious in the RNA blot analysis of in vivo decay shown in Fig. 1. However, it was likely that any putative 3′-terminal decay products would be very unstable in cells and thus be low in abundance (1Ross J. Microbiol. Rev. 1995; 59: 16-95Crossref Google Scholar, 14Ross J. Brawerman G. Belasco J. Control of Messenger RNA Stability. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1993: 417-448Crossref Google Scholar). Therefore, the RNA samples utilized in Fig. 1 were analyzed for possible 3′-terminal decay products by a sensitive RNase P1+T1 protection assay. A 620-nt radiolabeled RNA probe complementary to the 3′-terminal 210 nt of c-myc mRNA was employed for this assay (Fig.2 A). The time-zero RNA generated four protected fragments corresponding to intact c-myc mRNA molecules polyadenylated at four closely spaced sites, referred to as poly(A) site 2 (17Brewer G. Ross J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 1697-1708Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). These bands diminished in intensity at approximately equivalent rates during the time course. Quantitation of band intensities as a function of time indicated a half-life of 45 min for c-myc mRNA. Also observed was a very faint protected fragment that was shorter than the four full-length c-myc mRNA species; it also decreased in intensity with time (Fig. 2 A, arrow). A 14-day overexposure of the gel enhanced its intensity especially at later time points (Fig. 2 B, arrow). This band was not an artifact of the RNase-digested probe because the control incubation of probe with tRNA did not produce a band at this location in the gel (Fig. 2 B, lane 1). Additionally, this band was not detected in a hybridization of the probe with full-length, in vitro synthesized c-myc mRNA, even though the protected fragment corresponding to full-length mRNA was over-exposed (Fig. 2 C, compare lane 3 tolane 2). These data suggested that the faint, protected fragment corresponded to a low abundance, 3′-terminal product of c-myc mRNA decay in cells.Figure 2Detection of 3′-terminal decay intermediatesin vivo. A, the same RNA samples utilized in Fig. 1 were analyzed by an RNase P1+T1 protection assay using a 620-nt, 32P-labeled probe spanning the last 210 nt of c-myc mRNA as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Protected fragments were separated in a 6% polyacrylamide, 7 m urea gel and detected by a 16-h exposure to x-ray film. pA2 indicates the protected fragments corresponding to poly(A) site 2 molecules (17Brewer G. Ross J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 1697-1708Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Thearrow denotes the location of a protected fragment corresponding to a likely decay intermediate (see text).Lane M contains 32P-labeled DNA markers with nucleotide lengths denoted to the right.B, the gel was re-exposed to x-ray film for 14 days to enhance the signal for the decay intermediate (denoted by thearrow). A diagram depicting the 3′ end of the human c-myc gene is shown at the bottom. The 3′-UTR and 3′-flanking genomic DNA are denoted by the box andline, respectively. The two major polyadenylation sites are shown along with the SspI and EcoRI sites used for generation of the probe. The short line represents the region of the probe protected by undegraded c-myc mRNA that terminates at poly(A) site 2. C, RNase protection control experiment. Plasmid pGB1023 contains the full-length cDNA encoding the human c-myc mRNA that ends at the 3′-most polyadenylation site (17Brewer G. Ross J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 1697-1708Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Transcription of theHindIII-digested plasmid with SP6 RNA polymerase produces full-length mRNA with an 85-nt poly(A) tract. RNA from K562 cells (lane 2) and c-myc mRNA synthesized in vitro (lane 3) were analyzed by the RNase P1+T1 protection assay as described in panel A. Samples were fractionated in the same 6% polyacrylamide, 7 m urea gel, and protected fragments were detected by autoradiography. Lanes 1 and 2 were exposed for 5 days while lane 3was exposed for 16 h. The arrow in lane 2denotes the band corresponding to the decay intermediate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)If this band represents a decay intermediate generated following deadenylation, then it should be detectable in a poly(A−) fraction of RNA from K562 cells and not be detectable in a poly(A+) fraction. RNA was fractionated by chromatography using oligo(dT)-cellulose (see “Experimental Procedures”). Analysis of the RNA samples by agarose gel electrophoresis indicated efficient separation of ribosomal RNA (Fig. 3A). As a further control for the separation of poly(A−) and poly(A+) RNAs, fractions were analyzed for the distribution of H4 histone mRNA, which lacks a poly(A) tract; γ-globin mRNA, which is a polyadenylated mRNA with a half-life of 20 h; and c-myc mRNA, which is a labile, polyadenylated mRNA. Levels of H4 histone and γ-globin mRNAs were measured by nuclease S1 mapping assays. Quantitation of the protected fragments and comparison of signals to the signal present in total RNA indicated that all of the H4 histone mRNA was detected in the poly(A−) fraction; none was detected in the poly(A+) fraction (Fig. 3 B, lanes 3–5). As expected, most (80%) of the γ-globin mRNA was present in the poly(A+) fraction (Fig. 3 B,lanes 7–9). These analyses indicated a suitable separation of poly(A−) and poly(A+) RNAs by oligo(dT)-cellulose chromatography. The distribution of c-myc mRNA was examined by RNase P1+T1 protection assay of the fractionated RNAs. Sixty percent of c-myc mRNA was present in the poly(A−) fraction and 40% was in the poly(A+) fraction (Fig. 3 C), indicating that a substantial fraction of the full-length mRNA is likely deadenylated. A 14-day overexposure of the gel showed the presence of the band corresponding to the decay intermediate in the poly(A−) fraction while none was detectable in the poly(A+) fraction (Fig. 3 D, compare lane 3, arrow with lane 4). These data further suggested that the faint, protected fragment observed in RNase protection assays of cellular RNA is a decay intermediate of c-myc mRNA.Figure 3Assay of the 3′-terminal, c-mycdecay intermediate in poly(A−)versuspoly(A+) RNA fractions. Total RNA from exponentially growing K562 cells was fractionated by oligo(dT)-cellulose chromatography as described under “Experimental Procedures.” A, one microgram of the indicated RNAs was fractionated in a miniature, 1% agarose gel and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. The locations of the 28 and 18 S ribosomal RNAs are denoted to the left of thepanel. B, equal cell equivalents of total RNA, poly(A−) RNA, and poly(A+) RNA were analyzed for H4 histone or γ-globin mRNAs by nuclease S1 mapping as described under “Experimental Procedures” using 3′-end radiolabeled probes for each mRNA. Incubation of probes with tRNA served as hybridization controls (lanes 2 and 6). The protected fragments were fractionated on the same 8% polyacrylamide, 7m urea gel, detected by autoradiography, and quantified by densitometry. The protected fragment lengths are 104 nt for H4 histone and 167 nt for γ-globin mRNA. The sizes of32P-labeled DNA marker fragments are indicted to theleft of the panel. C, equal cell equivalents of total RNA, poly(A−) RNA, and poly(A+) RNA were analyzed for c-myc mRNA by RNase P1+T1 protection assay using a 32P-labeled probe spanning the last 210 nt of c-myc mRNA as described in the legend for Fig. 2. pA2 indicates the protected fragments corresponding to poly(A) site 2 molecules.

The gel was exposed to x-ray film for 16 h.D, the gel in panel C was re-exposed to x-ray film for 14 days to enhance the signal for the decay intermediate detected in the poly(A−) fraction (denoted by theshort arrow in lane 3).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Additionally, the results of the cellular decay experiments were compared with those from cell-free decay reactions, where decay products are readily observed (17Brewer G. Ross J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 1697-1708Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). RNase P1+T1 protection analysis of c-myc mRNA in decay reactions containing polysomes revealed a major protected fragment with a size similar to the one observed during in vivo decay (Fig.4 A, band I). (The faint, minor band above product I is not consistently observed.) A smaller, less abundant fragment not readily detected in cellular RNA was also observed (Fig. 4 A, band II). Bands I and II increased in abundance during incubation times up to 60 min, after which they decreased in abundance. These results were consistent with their being transient products of 3′-terminal decay in vitro. Decay product I was also present in a trace amount in time-zero RNA. This was not unexpected because c-mycmRNA molecules should be undergoing decay in K562 cells at the time of cell lysis. As shown in earlier studies, 3′-terminal decay products form in vitro following removal of most, if not all, of the poly(A) tract (17Brewer G. Ross J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 1697-1708Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Like the 3′-terminal decay product in cells,in vitro decay products also fractionate with poly(A−) RNA by oligo(dT)-cellulose chromatography. 2G. Brewer, unpublished observation.

CK reversibly makes CP according to the following reaction (1Marshall M. Cohen P.P. Methods Enzymol. 1970; 17: 229-234Crossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar). ATP+carbamate↔Keq=0.027,25°CADP+CPEquation 1 In this reaction one ATP molecule is used/molecule synthesized of CP, and the true substrate that is phosphorylated is carbamate, which is generated chemically from bicarbonate and ammonia (1Marshall M. Cohen P.P. Methods Enzymol. 1970; 17: 229-234Crossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 2Jones M.E. Lipmann F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1960; 46: 1194-1205Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Thorne K.J.I. Jones M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1963; 238: 2992-2998Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because of the unfavorable equilibrium of the reaction, CK is thought to functionin vivo exclusively in the direction of ATP synthesis using the CP generated by catabolic ornithine transcarbamylase in the fermentative catabolism of arginine (4Abdelal A. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1979; 33: 139-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar).In contrast to CK, CPS synthesizes irreversibly the CP that is used in the biosynthesis of pyrimidines, arginine, and urea, according to the following reaction (5Meister A. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1989; 62: 315-374PubMed Google Scholar). 2ATP+HCO3−+NH3(glutamine)→2ADP+Pi+CP(+glutamate) (Eq.2)The reaction catalyzed by CPS differs from that catalyzed by CK not only in its irreversibility in the direction of CP synthesis, but also in the use of bicarbonate and ammonia as the true substrates and in the utilization of two ATP molecules/molecule made of CP.CK and CPS also differ structurally. CK is a homodimer of a polypeptide of approximately 33 kDa (6Marina A. Uriarte M. Barcelona B. Fresquet V. Cervera J. Rubio V. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 253: 280-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), whereas CPS is a 120-kDa polypeptide that is either associated or fused to another polypeptide of approximately 40 kDa (7Rubio V. Bränden C.-I. Schneider G. Carbon Dioxide Fixation and Reduction in Biological and Model Systems. Oxford University Press, Oxford1994: 249-264Google Scholar). Alignment of the amino acid sequences of CK and CPS failed to reveal the existence of a statistically significant sequence identity between the two enzymes (8Baur H. Luethi E. Stalon V. Mercenier A. Haas D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 179: 53-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), whereas there is a high degree of sequence identity among different CKs (6Marina A. Uriarte M. Barcelona B. Fresquet V. Cervera J. Rubio V. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 253: 280-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) or different CPSs (9Simmer J.P. Kelly R.E. Rinker Jr., A.G. Scully J.L. Evans D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10395-10402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). No obvious structural similarities are found when the recently determined three-dimensional structures of CPS from Escherichia coli(10Thoden J.B. Holden H.M. Wesenberg G. Raushel F.M. Rayment I. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6305-6316Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar) and of CK from Enterococcus faecalis (11Marina A. Alzari P.M. Bravo J. Uriarte M. Barcelona B. Fita I. Rubio V. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 934-940Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) are compared. The two proteins exhibit an open β-sheet α/β structure. Whereas CPS exhibits the fold found in biotin carboxylase and in other proteins that synthesize acylphosphate bonds, the CK fold appears not to be represented in structural data bases, although it is likely to be found in other enzymes of presently unknown structure that synthesize acylphosphates and exhibit sequence similarity with CK, such as acetylglutamate kinase, γ-glutamyl kinase, and long chain fatty acyl-CoA synthetases (6Marina A. Uriarte M. Barcelona B. Fresquet V. Cervera J. Rubio V. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 253: 280-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar).Given the important differences between CPS and CK, the recent description of CK-like CPSs in the hyperthermophilic archeaPyrococcus abyssi (12Purcarea C. Simon V. Prieur D. Hervé G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 236: 189-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and Pyrococcus furiosus(13Legrain C. Demarez M. Glansdorff N. Pierard A. Microbiology (Read.). 1995; 141: 1093-1099Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 14Durbecq V. Legrain C. Roovers M. Pierard A. Glansdorff N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12803-12808Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) is puzzling. In the extracts of these extremophiles that live at 100 °C and, in the case of P. abyssi, at high pressure in the ocean bottom, the CK-like CPS was the only activity found to synthesize CP in reaction mixtures containing ATP, bicarbonate, and ammonia (12Purcarea C. Simon V. Prieur D. Hervé G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 236: 189-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 13Legrain C. Demarez M. Glansdorff N. Pierard A. Microbiology (Read.). 1995; 141: 1093-1099Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 14Durbecq V. Legrain C. Roovers M. Pierard A. Glansdorff N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12803-12808Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The polypeptide mass, homodimeric nature, and amino acid sequence (reported only for P. furiosus) of these pyrococcal enzymes (12Purcarea C. Simon V. Prieur D. Hervé G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 236: 189-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 14Durbecq V. Legrain C. Roovers M. Pierard A. Glansdorff N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12803-12808Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) are characteristic of CKs. However, similarly to CPSs, these enzymes were reported (12Purcarea C. Simon V. Prieur D. Hervé G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 236: 189-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 14Durbecq V. Legrain C. Roovers M. Pierard A. Glansdorff N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12803-12808Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) to use two ATP molecules/molecule made of CP and to exhibit ATPase activity in the absence of ammonia, although the magnitude of the ATPase was greater, relative to the overall reaction, than in classical CPSs (15Metzenberg R.L. Marshall M. Cohen P.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1958; 233: 1560-1564Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Anderson P.M. Meister A. Biochemistry. 1965; 4: 2803-2809Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). In contrast with most CPSs, which use glutamine with preference to ammonia as the nitrogen source (7Rubio V. Bränden C.-I. Schneider G. Carbon Dioxide Fixation and Reduction in Biological and Model Systems. Oxford University Press, Oxford1994: 249-264Google Scholar), the pyrococcal CPSs use exclusively ammonia (12Purcarea C. Simon V. Prieur D. Hervé G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 236: 189-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 13Legrain C. Demarez M. Glansdorff N. Pierard A. Microbiology (Read.). 1995; 141: 1093-1099Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 14Durbecq V. Legrain C. Roovers M. Pierard A. Glansdorff N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12803-12808Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) but this is also the case with the ureotelic CPSs (7Rubio V. Bränden C.-I. Schneider G. Carbon Dioxide Fixation and Reduction in Biological and Model Systems. Oxford University Press, Oxford1994: 249-264Google Scholar). Given these puzzling characteristics of pyrococcal CPS, we decided to study it in detail as it might represent an intermediate step in the evolution of CP biosynthesis (14Durbecq V. Legrain C. Roovers M. Pierard A. Glansdorff N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12803-12808Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Thus, we have cloned and hyperexpressed in E. coli the gene encoding the CPS fromP. furiosus, and we have purified and crystallized the recombinant enzyme generated in E. coli. The large amounts of pure protein obtained in this way have permitted us to study the stoichiometry, reversibility, point of equilibrium, and the nature of the substrates in the reaction. Our results unequivocally show that the enzyme catalyzes the CK reaction. Furthermore, our initial results of x-ray studies on enzyme crystals also indicate that the structure of this enzyme resembles closely that of CK. Therefore, this appears to be the first example of a CK with an anabolic role that is reserved in other organisms for CPS (the synthesis of CP as a precursor of arginine and the pyrimidines).DISCUSSIONThe present results clearly show that the CP-synthesizing activity previously reported in P. furiosus (13Legrain C. Demarez M. Glansdorff N. Pierard A. Microbiology (Read.). 1995; 141: 1093-1099Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 14Durbecq V. Legrain C. Roovers M. Pierard A. Glansdorff N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12803-12808Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) is due to an enzyme that uses chemically made carbamate and a single ATP molecule to synthesize CP reversibly. The reaction exhibits the characteristic equilibrium of the CK reaction, an equilibrium that does not favor at 37 °C the accumulation of CP. The enzyme catalyzes with comparable efficiency the forward and reverse reactions, and it is very inefficient in phosphorylating bicarbonate instead of carbamate, judging from its very small bicarbonate-dependent ATPase activity. All these properties are shared by typical CKs, such as the enterococcal enzyme (1Marshall M. Cohen P.P. Methods Enzymol. 1970; 17: 229-234Crossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 2Jones M.E. Lipmann F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1960; 46: 1194-1205Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Marina A. Uriarte M. Barcelona B. Fresquet V. Cervera J. Rubio V. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 253: 280-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Our results are in conflict with the previously reported stoichiometry of 2 mol of ADP released/mole of CP formed by the partially purified enzyme from P. furiosus, assayed at 37 °C (14Durbecq V. Legrain C. Roovers M. Pierard A. Glansdorff N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12803-12808Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) or by the enzyme isolated from P. abyssi, assayed at 27 °C (12Purcarea C. Simon V. Prieur D. Hervé G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 236: 189-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Because these earlier enzyme preparations exhibited much greater ATPase activity in the absence of ammonia than the highly purified recombinant P. furiosusenzyme used here, the discrepancy would be explained if there were contaminating ATPases in the previous preparations that might have led to overestimation of the ADP production associated with CP synthesis. This possibility should be rigorously excluded with enzyme preparations obtained from cultures of pyrococci. Alternatively, it might be speculated that the highly purified enzyme used here is an individual component of a multicomponent CPS that would exhibit the classical CPS stoichiometry of 2 mol of ADP/mole of CP and that would be present in the possibly less pure preparations previously obtained from pyrococci (12Purcarea C. Simon V. Prieur D. Hervé G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 236: 189-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 14Durbecq V. Legrain C. Roovers M. Pierard A. Glansdorff N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12803-12808Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). However, this possibility is not supported by the similar specific activity and homodimeric nature of the recombinant and naturally produced enzymes and it also makes little biological sense, because the sole practical result of using such complex machinery would be to use an extra ATP molecule/mole of citrulline made in the ornithine transcarbamylase-coupled reaction. The coupling with ornithine transcarbamylase is essential in pyrococci given the rapid decomposition of CP at high temperature (13Legrain C. Demarez M. Glansdorff N. Pierard A. Microbiology (Read.). 1995; 141: 1093-1099Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar).The high degree of sequence identity and immunological cross-reactivity of the pyrococcal enzyme and the enterococcal CK confirm the similarity of the two enzymes. Furthermore, our initial structural data obtained by x-ray crystallography clearly show that the pyrococcal enzyme exhibits a three-dimensional structure and quaternary organization that are highly similar to those of enterococcal CK and that are very different from those of CPS. Although the CK structure (11Marina A. Alzari P.M. Bravo J. Uriarte M. Barcelona B. Fita I. Rubio V. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 934-940Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) reveals the existence of two catalytic sites/enzyme dimer, the relative orientation of the sites and the absence of intramolecular tunnels joining them exclude the possibility of catalytic collaboration between the two sites that is required for the synthesis of CP from bicarbonate and ammonia in three steps (bicarbonate phosphorylation, carbamate formation, and carbamate phosphorylation) that characterizes the mechanism of CPS (10Thoden J.B. Holden H.M. Wesenberg G. Raushel F.M. Rayment I. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6305-6316Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar, 39Rubio V. Llorente P. Britton H.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 255: 262-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). In summary, all indicate that except for its extreme thermostability and low activity at normal temperatures, 3However, the activity at 100 °C of theP. furiosus enzyme may be similar to that of enterococcal CK at 37 °C. Thus, the pyrococcal enzyme released at 95 °C, under the conditions of the CK assay (1Marshall M. Cohen P.P. Methods Enzymol. 1970; 17: 229-234Crossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar), approximately 250 μmol Pi·min−1·mg protein−1, whereas the enterococcal CK produces at 37 °C in the same assay approximately 600 μmol citrulline·min−1·mg protein−1 (1Marshall M. Cohen P.P. Methods Enzymol. 1970; 17: 229-234Crossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar). the pyrococcal enzyme is endowed with the characteristics of classical CKs. The finding of similar enzymes in P. abyssi (12Purcarea C. Simon V. Prieur D. Hervé G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 236: 189-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) andPyrococcus horikoshii (a gene has been found in this organism (GenBankTM accession number 3257702) encoding a putative polypeptide exhibiting 89% sequence identity with the enzyme from P. furiosus) strongly suggests that this enzyme constitutes a constant component of the catalytic machinery of the hyperthermophiles of the Pyrococcus genus.As already indicated, the generally accepted function of CK is to synthesize ATP from ADP and the CP produced mainly in the catabolism of arginine by the arginine deiminase pathway (4Abdelal A. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1979; 33: 139-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). There are strong reasons to deny such a function for the present CK. No arginine deiminase activity was detected in the extracts of P. furiosus cells cultivated in a medium containing 0.2 g arginine·liter−1 (40Legrain C. Villeret V. Roovers M. Gigot D. Dideberg O. Pièrard A. Glansdorff N. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 1046-1055Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), suggesting that the arginine deiminase pathway is not operative in this organism. In keeping with this, no arginine deiminase putative gene was identified in the entire genome of the related organism P. horikoshii (41Kawarabayasi Y. Sawada M. Horikawa Y. Hino Y. Yamamoto S. et al.DNA Res. 1998; 5: 55-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). If such a gene had existed in P. horikoshii, it should have been identified given the constant sequence motifs that are characteristic of arginine deiminases (42Knodler L.A. Sekyere E.O. Stewart T.S. Schofield P.J. Edwards M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4470-4477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). P. furiosus cells could be grown in a defined medium containing ornithine as an arginine precursor (40Legrain C. Villeret V. Roovers M. Gigot D. Dideberg O. Pièrard A. Glansdorff N. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 1046-1055Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), and the enzymes of the biosynthetic pathway of arginine, anabolic ornithine transcarbamylase, argininosuccinate synthetase, and argininosuccinase were detected in this organism (43Van de Casteele M. Demarez M. Legrain C. Glansdorff N. Pierard A. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1990; 136: 1177-1183Crossref Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Similarly, aspartate transcarbamylase, the enzyme that catalyzes the second step of pyrimidine biosynthesis, was detected in both P. furiosus(13Legrain C. Demarez M. Glansdorff N. Pierard A. Microbiology (Read.). 1995; 141: 1093-1099Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) and P. abyssi and was characterized in the latter organism (44Purcarea C. Hervé G. Ladjimi M.M. Cunin R. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 4143-4157Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, CP has to be made in these microorganisms to be utilized by ornithine transcarbamylase and aspartate transcarbamylase in the biosynthesis of arginine and pyrimidines. The only CP-making activity detected in extracts from these microorganisms was due to the enzyme studied here (12Purcarea C. Simon V. Prieur D. Hervé G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 236: 189-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 13Legrain C. Demarez M. Glansdorff N. Pierard A. Microbiology (Read.). 1995; 141: 1093-1099Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). This enzyme appears to be coupled functionally and to form physical complexes with ornithine transcarbamylase (13Legrain C. Demarez M. Glansdorff N. Pierard A. Microbiology (Read.). 1995; 141: 1093-1099Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) and aspartate transcarbamylase (45.Purcarea, C., Enzymes Involved in Carbamoyl Phosphate Metabolism from the Hyperthermophilic and Barophilic Marine Archaebacterium Pyrococcus abyssi.Ph.D. Thesis, 1995, Université Paris-Sud, Paris.Google Scholar) for there is evidence of efficient channeling of the CP in the direction of citrulline and carbamoyl aspartate biosynthesis. The inexistence in these organisms of classical CPS is also supported by the lack of detection of a classical CPS gene in the full genome of P. horikoshii (41Kawarabayasi Y. Sawada M. Horikawa Y. Hino Y. Yamamoto S. et al.DNA Res. 1998; 5: 55-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). Again, it would be unlikely that such a gene would have escaped detection because many constant regions of characteristic sequence exist in all classical CPSs (9Simmer J.P. Kelly R.E. Rinker Jr., A.G. Scully J.L. Evans D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10395-10402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and, for example, classical CPS genes were detected (whereas no CK genes were detected) in the genomes of the other three archea that have been sequenced fully, Methanococcus jannaschii (46Bult C.J. White O. Olsen G.J. Zhou L. Fleischmann R.D. et al.Science. 1996; 273: 1058-1073Crossref PubMed Scopus (2279) Google Scholar),Archaeoglobus fulgidus (47Klenk H.P. Clayton R.A. Tomb J.F. Wite O. Nelson K.E. et al.Nature. 1997; 390: 364-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (1196) Google Scholar), and Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum (48Smith D.R. Doucette-Stamm L.A. Deloughery C. Lee H.-M. Dubois J. et al.J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 7135-7155Crossref PubMed Scopus (1034) Google Scholar). Taken together, all these data strongly suggest that the CK studied here plays a new metabolic role: the biosynthesis of CP for anabolic purposes.Such an extraordinary use of a CK appears to be rendered possible by the extreme living conditions of pyrococci. Whereas in the mesophilic world the chemical formation of carbamate (49Caplow M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1968; 90: 6795-6803Crossref Scopus (1008) Google Scholar) might be slower than required by the needs of CP, rendering essential the enzymatic formation of carbamate by CPS in the initial two steps of its reactional mechanism (39Rubio V. Llorente P. Britton H.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 255: 262-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), the high temperature in hydrothermal vents assures rapid chemical formation of carbamate without the need for enzyme catalysis. Another function fulfilled by mesophilic CPS is the provision of a high local concentration of carbamate at the site of carbamate phosphorylation within the enzyme. This becomes possible by coupling the synthesis of carbamate with the cleavage of an extra ATP molecule. However, the enzymatic synthesis of high local concentrations of carbamate appears unnecessary in P. furiosus given the high affinity of the pyrococcal enzyme for carbamate,2particularly because the concentration of carbamate may be relatively high in the habitat of P. furiosus given the finding in hydrothermal vents of high concentrations of CO2 (50Childress J.J. Lee R.W. Sanders N.K. Felbeck H. Oros D.R. Toulmond A. Desbruyeres D. Kennicutt M.C. Brooks J. Nature. 1993; 362: 147-149Crossref Scopus (80) Google Scholar) (the true reactant, rather than bicarbonate, in the chemical synthesis of carbamate (49Caplow M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1968; 90: 6795-6803Crossref Scopus (1008) Google Scholar)) and of 0.6–1 mm ammonia possibly derived from sediments (51Lilley M.D. Butterfield D.A. Olson E.J. Lupton J.E. Macko S.A. McDuff R.E. Nature. 1993; 364: 45-47Crossref Scopus (263) Google Scholar) similar to those from where P. furiosuswas grown (52Fiala G. Stetter K.O. Arch. Microbiol. 1986; 145: 56-61Crossref Scopus (701) Google Scholar). In fact, the enzyme activity in P. furiosusappears more than enough to serve the needs of arginine and pyrimidine synthesis, even at suboptimal concentrations of carbamate. Thus, from the increase in the enzyme activity given in Ref. 13Legrain C. Demarez M. Glansdorff N. Pierard A. Microbiology (Read.). 1995; 141: 1093-1099Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, when the assay temperature is raised from 60 to 90 °C, the activity in the initialP. furiosus extract would be at 90 °C approximately 10 μmol · h−1 · mg protein−1 (14Durbecq V. Legrain C. Roovers M. Pierard A. Glansdorff N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12803-12808Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), a value that is 9-fold higher than the activity of CPS in E. coliextracts, assayed at 37 °C (16Anderson P.M. Meister A. Biochemistry. 1965; 4: 2803-2809Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Another characteristic of the CPS reaction that is mimicked by the high temperature of the habitat of pyrococci is the irreversibility of the synthesis of CP, because the rapid decomposition of CP at 100 °C (13Legrain C. Demarez M. Glansdorff N. Pierard A. Microbiology (Read.). 1995; 141: 1093-1099Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) would cause the concentration of this product to be essentially nil, thus displacing strongly the reaction in the direction of CP synthesis. In summary, the extreme living conditions of the pyrococci may render unnecessary the enzymatic synthesis of carbamate by CPS with the associated expenditure of an extra ATP molecule, as a prelude to making CP, explaining the use of CK for CP synthesis in these organisms. It is of interest that CK appears to have become adapted in P. furiosus to its new anabolic function, because when compared with enterococcal CK, it exhibits greater apparent affinity for carbamate2 and is less effective in the synthesis of ATP from ADP and CP, relative to CP synthesis. Other adaptations exhibited by the pyrococcal CK that deserve further study are the much lower specific activity at 37 °C3 and much higher thermal stability than classical CK. Detailed comparisons of the three-dimensional structures of the enterococcal and pyrococcal CKs and site-directed mutagenesis of key residues in the two enzymes will be essential to ascertain the reasons for these differences. Experiments with these goals are currently in progress in our laboratory. Two types of enzymes, carbamate kinase (CK) 1The abbreviations used are: CK, carbamate kinase; CP, carbamoyl phosphate; CPS, carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase. 1The abbreviations used are: CK, carbamate kinase; CP, carbamoyl phosphate; CPS, carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase. and carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase (CPS), are known to synthesize carbamoyl phosphate (CP) from mixtures of ATP, bicarbonate, and ammonia. CK reversibly makes CP according to the following reaction (1Marshall M. Cohen P.P. Methods Enzymol. 1970; 17: 229-234Crossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar). ATP+carbamate↔Keq=0.027,25°CADP+CPEquation 1 In this reaction one ATP molecule is used/molecule synthesized of CP, and the true substrate that is phosphorylated is carbamate, which is generated chemically from bicarbonate and ammonia (1Marshall M. Cohen P.P. Methods Enzymol. 1970; 17: 229-234Crossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 2Jones M.E. Lipmann F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1960; 46: 1194-1205Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Thorne K.J.I. Jones M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1963; 238: 2992-2998Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because of the unfavorable equilibrium of the reaction, CK is thought to functionin vivo exclusively in the direction of ATP synthesis using the CP generated by catabolic ornithine transcarbamylase in the fermentative catabolism of arginine (4Abdelal A. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1979; 33: 139-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). In contrast to CK, CPS synthesizes irreversibly the CP that is used in the biosynthesis of pyrimidines, arginine, and urea, according to the following reaction (5Meister A. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1989; 62: 315-374PubMed Google Scholar). 2ATP+HCO3−+NH3(glutamine)→2ADP+Pi+CP(+glutamate) (Eq.2)The reaction catalyzed by CPS differs from that catalyzed by CK not only in its irreversibility in the direction of CP synthesis, but also in the use of bicarbonate and ammonia as the true substrates and in the utilization of two ATP molecules/molecule made of CP. CK and CPS also differ structurally. CK is a homodimer of a polypeptide of approximately 33 kDa (6Marina A. Uriarte M. Barcelona B. Fresquet V. Cervera J. Rubio V. Eur. J.

https://openalex.org/W2091558866,"The control of CD4 gene expression is believed to be linked directly to the signaling events that mediate T cell development and is directly dependent on the CD4promoter. We have previously determined that this promoter contains four factor-binding sites important for its function. One of these sites, referred to as the P4 site, contains an Ets consensus recognition sequence. Using functional and biochemical analyses, we determine that Elf-1 binds to this site and specifically activates theCD4 promoter, indicating that Elf-1 is playing an important role in CD4 promoter function. In addition, a second nuclear factor binds to this region. Although there are consensus recognition sites for other factors, we demonstrate that none of these factors binds to the P4 site, nor do other known members of the Ets family. Thus, a novel transcription factor may bind to theCD4 promoter and help mediate its function."
https://openalex.org/W1974278342,"In this paper, we present the molecular cloning and characterization of a murine homolog of the Escherichia coli chaperone ClpX. Murine ClpX shares 38% amino acid sequence identity with the E. coli homolog and is a novel member of the Hsp100/Clp family of molecular chaperones. ClpX localizes to human chromosome 15q22.2–22.3 and in mouse is expressed tissue-specifically as one transcript of ∼2.9 kilobases (kb) predominantly within the liver and as two isoforms of ∼2.6 and ∼2.9 kb within the testes. Purified recombinant ClpX displays intrinsic ATPase activity, with aK m of ∼25 μm and aV max of ∼660 pmol min−1μg−1, which is active over a broad range of pH, temperature, ethanol, and salt parameters. Substitution of lysine 300 with alanine in the ATPase domain P-loop abolishes both ATP hydrolysis and binding. Recombinant ClpX can also interact with its putative partner protease subunit ClpP in overexpression experiments in 293T cells. Subcellular studies by confocal laser scanning microscopy localized murine ClpX green fluorescent protein fusions to the mitochondria. Deletion of the N-terminal mitochondrial targeting sequence abolished mitochondrial compartmentalization. Our results thus suggest that murine ClpX acts as a tissue-specific mammalian mitochondrial chaperone that may play a role in mitochondrial protein homeostasis.

The Hsp100/Clp family of ATPases constitutes a group of molecular chaperones that participate in a broad range of biological processes in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Sequence similarity and conservation of structural features among the over 70 known family members define two classes, which are further subdivided into eight subfamilies (1Schirmer E.C. Glover J.R. Singer M.A. Lindquist S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 289-296Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar). All Hsp100/Clps examined have been demonstrated to assemble into homo-oligomeric ring-shaped structures and to modulate substrates in an ATP-dependent manner (1Schirmer E.C. Glover J.R.

J. Struct. Biol. 1998; 123: 248-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Specific substrate recognition occurs through protein-protein interactions directed by the PDZ-like domains of the Hsp100/Clp family members (3Levchenko I. Smith C.K. Walsh N.P. Sauer R.T. Baker T.A. Cell. 1997; 91: 939-947Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Members of the family participate in the disaggregation of improperly folded and damaged proteins, the facilitation of DNA transposition, the selective coordination of substrate degradation, the regulation of the inheritance of prion-like factors, and the modulation of gene expression (reviewed by Schirmer et al. (1Schirmer E.C. Glover J.R. Singer M.A. Lindquist S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 289-296Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar)). Despite the involvement of Hsp100s in such diverse processes, it is the conserved structural organization of the members that suggests that these varied functions may involve a common mechanism governing disassembly of high-order quartenary protein complexes (1Schirmer E.C.

It is an essential component of the Mu transposase life cycle where it mediates dissociation of stable MuA tetramer-DNA complexes (10Kruklitis R. Welty D.J. Nakai H.

Deletion of ClpX blocks the growth of Mu by arresting transposition at the transition between the recombination and DNA replication stages (10Kruklitis R. Welty D.J. Nakai H.

Pato M. Gama M.J. Toussaint A. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 11: 1109-1116Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The molecular chaperone properties of E. coli ClpX are further supported by its capacity to prevent the heat inactivation of the bacteriophage λO replication protein, to dissociate preformed λO aggregates, and to stimulate the binding of λO tooriλ DNA (13Wawrzynow A.

EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1867-1877Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar).While E. coli ClpX can function alone as a bona fide molecular chaperone, it also contributes to a number of processes as a regulatory subunit of the broad specificity, energy-dependent protease ClpP. In E. coli, ClpX and ClpP are translated from a single heat-shock-inducible transcript in accordance with their involvement in stress tolerance (7Gottesman S. Clark W.P. de Crecy-Lagard V.

In this two-component chaperone-protease system, ClpX does not refold proteins to mediate functional reactivation but rather utilizes its chaperone activity to selectively target specific substrates for degradation by channeling them into the proteolytic chamber of the two-ring ClpP tetradecamer.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 437-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Many of these substrates possess 7–11 amino acid C-terminal peptides that are required for recognition by the PDZ-like domains of ClpX (3Levchenko I. Smith C.K. Walsh N.P. Sauer R.T. Baker T.A. Cell. 1997; 91: 939-947Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar).While prokaryotes possess pan-cellular chaperone distribution, eukaryotes require compartment-specific chaperones to negotiate and maintain polypeptide chains within the appropriate tertiary structure and to facilitate the degradation of unsalvageable or transient protein molecules and complexes (25Martin J. Hartl F.U. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1997; 7: 41-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 26Martin J. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1997; 29: 35-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). As expected from the proposed endosymbiotic origins of the mitochondria (27Hartl F.U. Neupert W. Science. 1990; 247: 930-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar, 28Schwartz R.M. Dayhoff M.O. Science. 1978; 199: 395-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar), the molecular chaperones that direct mitochondrial function display significant sequence homolog to bacterial counterparts. In particular, mitochondrial proteins Hsp70, chaperonins Hsp60/Hsp10 and Hsp78 are homologous to E. coli DnaK, GroEL/GroES, and the class I Hsp100/Clp family, respectively. The conspicuous absence of a eukaryotic homolog of the ClpX class II Hsp/Clp subfamily was remedied following the sequencing of the complete genome of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (29Goffeau A. Barrell B.G. Bussey H. Davis R.W. Dujon B. Feldmann H. Galibert F. Hoheisel J.D. Jacq C. Johnston M. Louis E.J. Mewes H.W. Murakami Y. Philippsen P. Tettelin H. Oliver S.G.

Neupert W. Langer T. FEBS Lett. 1998; 438: 250-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). However, a mammalian homolog had remained until this point unidentified. The existence of such a member has been strongly implied by the cloning of a human homolog of ClpP that sorts to the mitochondrial matrix (31Corydon T.J. Bross P. Holst H.U. Neve S. Kristiansen K. Gregersen N. Bolund L. Biochem. J. 1998; 331: 309-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar,32Bross P. Andresen B.S. Knudsen I. Kruse T.A. Gregersen N. FEBS Lett. 1995; 377: 249-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar).In this report, we describe the identification and initial characterization of murine ClpX, a novel mammalian member of the Hsp100/Clp family of molecular chaperones that displays distinct sequence similarity with its E. coli counterpart. We demonstrate that murine ClpX is directed to the mitochondria by an N-terminal targeting peptide. In line with its likely role as a mitochondrial molecular chaperone, we show that ClpX possesses an intrinsic ATPase activity that is resilient in vitro to fluctuations in reaction conditions reflecting environmental stress. Its capacity to interact with mouse ClpP in mammalian overexpression experiments suggests that mouse ClpX/P may represent a novel system for the regulation of mitochondrial protein homeostasis.DISCUSSIONThe current study presents the cloning and initial characterization of murine ClpX, a novel member of the Hsp100/Clp family of molecular chaperones and energy-dependent protease regulators. The encoded protein of 632 amino acids is a class II member as characterized by its general structural organization as well as the presence of only one and not two nucleotide binding domains (1Schirmer E.C. Glover J.R. Singer M.A. Lindquist S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 289-296Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar). Sequence homology exhibited between the E. coli,S. cerevisiae, C. elegans, and mouse members of this chaperone subfamily is concentrated toward the central and C-terminal regions of the molecules corresponding to the ATPase and the PDZ-like substrate recognition domains. Significant amino acid sequence divergence is observed at the N terminus due to the nonconserved nature of mitochondrial targeting peptides and the obvious absence of the peptide in E. coli. An additional N-terminal difference is that only three of the homologs contain a C4-zinc finger, with its noticeable absence in S. cerevisiae (Fig. 1 B). Since a ClpP homolog is also not evident in S. cerevisiae(29Goffeau A. Barrell B.G. Bussey H. Davis R.W. Dujon B. Feldmann H. Galibert F. Hoheisel J.D. Jacq C. Johnston M. Louis E.J. Mewes H.W. Murakami Y. Philippsen P. Tettelin H. Oliver S.G. Science. 1996; 274: 546Crossref PubMed Scopus (2983) Google Scholar, 56Goffeau A. Barrell B.G. Bussey H. Davis R.W. Dujon B. Feldmann H. Galibert F.

Science. 1996; 274: 563-567Crossref Scopus (3207) Google Scholar) the C4-zinc finger of E. coli, C. elegans, and mouse ClpX is a potential candidate for mediating recruitment of ClpP. However, as is the case with DNA J, the C4-zinc binding domain may also direct recognition and binding of denatured protein substrates (47Szabo A. Korszun R. Hartl F.U. Flanagan J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 408-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). It is interesting to speculate that ClpX may possess a bimodal capacity for substrate recognition with the N-terminal C4-zinc finger nonspecifically contacting denatured polypetides and the C-terminal PDZ domains directing specific interactions with native proteins.Since the molecular chaperone activity of Hsp100/Clp family members has been directly linked to their ability to hydrolyze ATP (13Wawrzynow A.

Chem. 1987; 262: 4477-4485Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it is noteworthy that the K m of basal ATPase hydrolysis by ClpX is ∼25 μm. This value is over 20- (low salt) to 200-fold (high salt) lower than that obtained for Hsp104 (4Schirmer E.C. Queitsch C. Kowal A.S. Parsell D.A. Lindquist S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15546-15552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), 20-fold lower than that for E. coli ClpX (13Wawrzynow A. Wojtkowiak D. Marszalek J. Banecki B. Jonsen M. Graves B. Georgopoulos C. Zylicz M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1867-1877Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar), 8-fold lower than that for E. coli ClpA (48Hwang B.J. Woo K.M. Goldberg A.L. Chung C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8727-8734Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and over 40-fold lower than the value for ClpB (50Woo K.M. Kim K.I. Goldberg A.L. Ha D.B. Chung C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20429-20434Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). While the basis of these differences is presently unclear, the resiliency of ClpX ATPase activity under conditions mimicking cellular stress (4Schirmer E.C. Queitsch C. Kowal A.S. Parsell D.A. Lindquist S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15546-15552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) supports its membership in a Hsp100 class of stress tolerance proteins (6Schmitt M. Neupert W.

Fearson K. Danese P.N. Mason T.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6304-6313Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar).The absence of multiple transcripts in all tissues but the testes and the direct correspondence of the ∼2.9-kb cDNA, which we have cloned with the single ∼2.9-kb transcript identified by Northern analysis, suggest the existence of a single form of ClpX in most tissues. Within this single transcript, the identification of two alternative start ATGs (M1 and M2) by in vitro transcription/translation experiments initially posed the exciting possibility that both mitochondrial and cytosolic forms of ClpX could be generated from the same transcript as has been documented for other proteins (52Attardi G. Schatz G. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1988; 4: 289-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (1054) Google Scholar, 53Land T. Rouault T.A. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 807-815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Such a mechanism for subcellular compartmentalization would be both biologically economical as well as resourceful, since it could provide a means of controlling differential compartmentalization in response to cellular metabolic status. However, GFP fusions with ClpXM1 and ClpXM2 both localized to the mitochondria and suggest that mice, like yeast, do not possess a cytosolic form of ClpX. Indeed, the truncated second form observed in the transcription/translation reactions may simply represent an aberrant product of the in vitro reaction.The tissue-specific pattern of ClpX expression is inconsistent with a role as a constitutive chaperone and suggests that ClpX has acquired tissue-specific mitochondrial functions. The lack of an essential requirement of eukaryotic mitochondrial ClpX for general cell viability under normal growth conditions has been supported by the absence of an obvious phenotypic effect following disruption of the ClpX homolog in yeast (30van Dyck L. Dembowski M. Neupert W. Langer T. FEBS Lett. 1998; 438: 250-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). It is particularly interesting that mouse ClpX is most highly expressed in the liver where the mitochondria participate in numerous cell type-specific functions. These liver-specific mitochondrial processes include the oxidation of drugs and other toxic compounds, the formation of ketone bodies, the synthesis of components of fatty acid precursors, and the generation of critical components of the nitrogen metabolic pathway. Elucidation of the cis-acting elements responsible for the varied pattern of basal tissue transcription and the characterization of potential stress response elements including the heat shock promoter element binding sites for heat shock transcription factors (54Morimoto R.I. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3788-3796Crossref PubMed Scopus (1518) Google Scholar) awaits upcoming promoter analysis. Interestingly, the common regulatory mechanism governing expression of bacterial ClpX and ClpP (7Gottesman S. Clark W.P. de Crecy-Lagard V. Maurizi M.R. J Biol Chem. 1993; 268: 22618-22626Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which are translated from a single transcript appears to be lost in humans where ClpX localizes to chromosome 15q22.2–22.3 and ClpP to chromosome 19q13. The divergent regulatory control is supported by the highly distinct pattern of ClpX and ClpP transcripts found in analogous tissues (this study and Ref.30van Dyck L. Dembowski M. Neupert W. Langer T. FEBS Lett. 1998; 438: 250-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Such divergence suggests that ClpX and ClpP may have acquired some independent cellular functions. However, the ability of ClpX and ClpP to function as part of a chaperone-protease system is still implied by their capacity to form a stable complex in vivo.Identification of the eukaryotic targets of mouse ClpX may be informed by parallels with the bacterial system. E. coli ClpX binds to the C-terminal 7–11 amino acids of the Mu transposase (22Levchenko I. Yamauchi M. Baker T.A. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1561-1572Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), of the Mu repressor (24Laachouch J.E. Desmet L. Geuskens V. Grimaud R. Toussaint A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 437-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), of the SsrA C-terminal peptide tails (18Gottesman S. Roche E. Zhou Y. Sauer R.T. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1338-1347Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar), and of the C. crescentus cell-cycle regulator CtrA (21Jenal U. Fuchs T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5658-5669Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar) through a direct interaction with the ClpX C-terminal PDZ domains (3Levchenko I. Smith C.K. Walsh N.P. Sauer R.T. Baker T.A. Cell. 1997; 91: 939-947Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Although not highly conserved in amino acid sequence, this C-terminal targeting sequence (CTS) is characterized by a central charged core flanked by hydrophobic amino acids. Transfer of the CTS to heterologous proteins transforms them into substrates for E. coli ClpX function (22Levchenko I. Yamauchi M. Baker T.A. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1561-1572Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Since the PDZ domains of mouse are approximately 60% similar to those of C. elegans, S. cerevisiae, and E. coli, it is highly plausible that the mode and targets of substrate recognition by ClpX will also be evolutionarily conserved. To identify eukaryotic mitochondrial proteins possessing a CTS homologous to that of MuA, the Mu repressor, SsrA proteins, or CtrA, we analyzed the mitochondrial subcategory of the Yeast Protein Data base (http://www.proteome.com/YPDhome.html) (55Hodges P.E.

Interestingly, of the 293 mitochondrial proteins in the data base, only nine fulfilled our criteria (see “Experimental Procedures”) for homology to the CTS within the last 11 amino acids: electron transferring flavoprotein, β chain (GenBankTMaccession number 1323371), citrate transport protein 1 (GenBankTM accession number 536746), import receptors of the outer membrane TOM70 and TOM72 (GenBankTM accession numbers 1302050 and 529136), RIP1 component of the cytochrome bc1 complex (GenBankTM accession number 602391), NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase (GenBankTMaccession number 805022), MSH1, the yeast homolog of E. coliMutS (GenBankTM accession number 529134), proline oxidase (GenBankTM accession number 1360564), and the E2 component of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (GenBankTM accession number 1301955). The first six potential substrates are in agreement with the tight inner membrane association observed for S. cerevisiae ClpX (30van Dyck L. Dembowski M. Neupert W. Langer T. FEBS Lett. 1998; 438: 250-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). This information, which suggests a possible role of ClpX in modulation of molecular import, electron transport, biochemical pathways and cell viability during normal or stressed cellular conditions, may ultimately prove valuable in elucidating its role in mammalian mitochondrial protein homeostasis.Addendum—A human homolog has been reported recently (GenBankTM accession number AJ006267 (C. Jespersgaard, P. Bross, T. J. Corydon, B. S. Andresen, T. Kruse, L. Bolund, and N. Gregersen, unpublished data)). The Hsp100/Clp family of ATPases constitutes a group of molecular chaperones that participate in a broad range of biological processes in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Sequence similarity and conservation of structural features among the over 70 known family members define two classes, which are further subdivided into eight subfamilies (1Schirmer E.C. Glover J.R. Singer M.A. Lindquist S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 289-296Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar). All Hsp100/Clps examined have been demonstrated to assemble into homo-oligomeric ring-shaped structures and to modulate substrates in an ATP-dependent manner (1Schirmer E.C. Glover J.R.

J. Struct. Biol. 1998; 123: 248-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Specific substrate recognition occurs through protein-protein interactions directed by the PDZ-like domains of the Hsp100/Clp family members (3Levchenko I. Smith C.K. Walsh N.P. Sauer R.T. Baker T.A. Cell. 1997; 91: 939-947Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Members of the family participate in the disaggregation of improperly folded and damaged proteins, the facilitation of DNA transposition, the selective coordination of substrate degradation, the regulation of the inheritance of prion-like factors, and the modulation of gene expression (reviewed by Schirmer et al. (1Schirmer E.C. Glover J.R. Singer M.A. Lindquist S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 289-296Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar)). Despite the involvement of Hsp100s in such diverse processes, it is the conserved structural organization of the members that suggests that these varied functions may involve a common mechanism governing disassembly of high-order quartenary protein complexes (1Schirmer E.C.

A major factor in the control of transcription is the assembly of large multiprotein complexes and the operation of selectivity and regulation of the various protein/protein and protein/DNA interactions involved. Understanding the assembly of these multiprotein complexes is clearly essential for elucidating the general mechanisms that regulate gene expression. The POU domain class of proteins (1Herr W. Sturm R.A. Clerc R.G. Corcoran L.M. Baltimore D. Sharpe P.A. Ingraham H.A. Rosenfeld M.G. Finney M. Ruvken G. Horvitz H.R.

Acta. 1993; 1173: 1-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar) is an example of a large family of transcription factors whose members frequently function through the selective assembly of multicomponent complexes. Members of this class of proteins play an important role in a diverse range of regulatory processes, including the control of gene expression in development and in cellular differentiation pathways (for reviews, see Refs. 2Verrijzer C.P. van der Vliet P.C.

One member of the family, Oct-1, is ubiquitous and is present in most cells during all stages of the cell cycle. Recognition sites for the protein are widely distributed in vertebrate genomes and are present in genes that do not form any coordinately regulated group. Oct-1-binding sites are also closely related (and in certain cases, identical) to the recognition sites for other members of the family. However, Oct-1 selectively activates genes in response to developmental, cell cycle, or hormonal signals and is involved in expression of housekeeping genes (e.g. Refs. 6He X. Gerrero R. Simmons D.M.

Oct-1 also plays an important role in the selective induction of the immediate-early transcription of herpes simplex virus by the virion activator VP16 (18O'Hare P. Goding C.R. Cell. 1988; 52: 435-445Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar), and analysis of this role has helped elucidate features that may be of broad applicability to transcriptional control mechanisms (reviewed in Refs. 19O'Hare P.

These motifs represent specialized binding sites for Oct-1 and are present upstream of each of the immediate-early genes. VP16 does not bind directly to DNA, but is recruited onto these sites by interaction with Oct-1, forming the transcription complex TRF-C (18O'Hare P. Goding C.R.

The factor was isolated and cloned by Wilson et al. (33Wilson A.C. LaMarco K. Peterson M.G. Herr W. Cell. 1993; 74: 115-125Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar), and the same gene was subsequently cloned by Kristie et al. (34Kristie T.M. Pomerantz J.L. Twomey T.C. Parent S.A. Sharp P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4387-4394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Human HCF is translated as a 300-kDa precursor of 2035 amino acids (33Wilson A.C. LaMarco K. Peterson M.G. Herr W. Cell. 1993; 74: 115-125Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar,34Kristie T.M. Pomerantz J.L. Twomey T.C. Parent S.A. Sharp P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4387-4394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The protein is processed by cleavage at a number of specific sites, the HCF repeats, which are located toward the middle of the precursor (between amino acids 1012 and 1435) to give rise to a range of polypeptides from 110 to 150 kDa. After cleavage, the majority of the N- and C-terminal regions of the protein remain stably associated. Recent studies have shown that the N-terminal region contains critical determinants for association with VP16 and for complex formation on the TAATGARAT motifs (35Simmen K.A. Newell A. Robinson M. Mills J.S. Canning G. Handa R. Parkes K. Borkakoti N. Jupp R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 71: 3886-3894Google Scholar, 36Wilson A.C. Freiman R.N. Goto H. Nishimoto T. Herr W. Mol. Cell.

Residues 1–380 of HCF contain six related reiterations of a motif of ∼50 amino acids, termed the kelch repeat and originally defined in the Drosophila protein kelch (38Xue F. Cooley L. Cell. 1993; 72: 681-693Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar).In vitro translated variants of HCF comprising this region promoted complex formation with VP16 proteins lacking the activation domain (35Simmen K.A. Newell A. Robinson M. Mills J.S. Canning G. Handa R. Parkes K. Borkakoti N. Jupp R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 71: 3886-3894Google Scholar, 36Wilson A.C. Freiman R.N. Goto H. Nishimoto T. Herr W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6139-6146Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Previous results from our laboratory indicated that the N-terminal region of HCF (amino acids 2–450) interacted with VP16 and formed the DNA-binding complex with the POU domain of Oct-1 relatively poorly, whereas a fusion protein (HCF NC) of the N-terminal domain with the C terminus of HCF (amino acids 1496–2035) bound VP16 and promoted complex formation much more efficiently (37La Boissière S. Walker S. O'Hare P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 7108-7118Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a sequence homologue of HCF has been identified in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans (37La Boissière S. Walker S. O'Hare P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 7108-7118Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The primary amino acid sequence of this protein resembles a natural NC fusion, having regions of high sequence identity to human HCF both within the kelch repeats of the N terminus and in the C-terminal domain. In addition, formation of a VP16 complex using C. elegansprotein extracts has been reported (21Wilson A.C. Cleary M.A. Lai J.S. LaMarco K. Peterson M.G. Herr W. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1993; 58: 167-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In this study, we undertake further biochemical analysis of the regions of HCF involved in VP16 complex formation and examine regions of the protein that are required for the N- and C-terminal domains of HCF to associate in the complex. The results indicate that the kelch repeat region of HCF is indeed sufficient for complex formation, but that residues C-terminal to the repeats, which are necessary for the association between the N and C termini of HCF itself, may interfere with VP16 complex formation. The extreme C-terminal region of HCF, corresponding to the area of conservation with the C. elegans protein, is sufficient for interaction with the N-terminal kelch repeat domain. Plasmids for bacterial expression of VP16 and the POU domain (amino acids 270–444) from Oct-1 (39Hayes S. O'Hare P. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 852-862Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 40Walker S. Hayes S. O'Hare P. Cell. 1994; 79: 841-852Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) and for in vitro transcription and translation of VP16, HCF NC (amino acids 2–491 + 1496–2035), N450 (amino acids 2–450), and C2 (amino acids 1496–2035) have been described previously (37La Boissière S. Walker S. O'Hare P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 7108-7118Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Plasmids for the expression of other HCF mutants (see Figs. 1 and 8) were created as described below from these HCF plasmids, from pCGNHCF (which contains full-length epitope-tagged HCF) (33Wilson A.C. LaMarco K. Peterson M.G. Herr W. Cell. 1993; 74: 115-125Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar), or from pSW127M (which contains two copies of the N-terminal domain of HCF) (37La Boissière S. Walker S. O'Hare P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 7108-7118Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). All HCF expression plasmids were constructed in pGEM3Zf(+) (Promega).Figure 8a, summary of HCF C-terminal mutants. The hatched area indicated within HCF C1 is >60% identical to a region of the C terminus of the C. elegans homologue.b, SDS-PAGE analysis of the HCF mutants expressed and radiolabeled in vitro (2 μl of each programmed TnT lysate).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Expression plasmids for HCF NCa to NCe, NCeΔtag, NCaΔe, N538, and N491tag were created by cleaving pSW127M withAgeI/BamHI, purifying linear pGEM.HCF-(2–491), and inserting AgeI/BamHI fragments containing appropriate regions amplified by polymerase chain reaction. The DNAs coding for the C-terminal domains of NCa to NCe (including the C-terminal c-Myc tag and stop codon) were amplified from pSW127NC with the addition of 5′-AgeI and 3′-BamHI sites. DNA coding for CeΔtag (to terminate translation at HCF amino acid 2035 and to omit the epitope tag) was amplified as for Ce, but with a stop codon added before the 3′-BamHI site. DNA coding for CaΔe was created by ligation of DNA coding for HCF amino acids 1786–2003, amplified from pSW127NC (5′-AgeI and 3′-SacII sites added), to a SacII/BamHI oligonucleotide linker carrying codons for the c-Myc tag and stop codon (note that alanine was added between amino acid 2003 and the linker). DNA coding for HCF amino acids 491–538 was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (natural 5′-AgeI site and 3′-stop codon and BamHI added) from pCGNHCF. DNA coding for the c-Myc tag (and stop codon) was synthesized as a oligonucleotide linker with AgeI andBamHI overhangs. The expression plasmid for HCF N491 was created by cleaving pSW127M with AgeI and BamHI, end filling, and ligating the blunt ends (note that isoleucine and leucine were added before the stop codon). The plasmid for HCF N380 was created by cloning DNA coding for HCF amino acids 2–380 (including the 5′-EcoRI site and N-terminal hemagglutinin tag), amplified by polymerase chain reaction from pSW127NC (3′-stop codon and BamHI added), into theEcoRI/BamHI sites of pGEM3Zf(+). The plasmids for expression of HCF C1, C3, C4, C8, and C9 (see Fig. 8) were created by amplifying the required DNA by polymerase chain reaction from pSW127NC or pCGNHCF (5′-EcoRI and translational start site/3′-stop codon (when required) andBamHI site added) and cloning into theEcoRI/BamHI sites of pGEM3Zf(+). Plasmids for expression of HCF C5, C6, and C7 were created by cloning theAgeI/BamHI fragments from the expression plasmids for HCF NCa, NCb, and NCc, respectively, into theEcoRI/BamHI sites of pGEM3Zf(+) with anEcoRI/Age I oligonucleotide linker carrying a transcriptional start site. VP16 and the Oct-1 POU domain were expressed as glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins in Escherichia coli HB101, purified, cleaved from glutathione S-transferase, and further purified by ion-exchange or DNA-cellulose chromatography (39Hayes S. O'Hare P. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 852-862Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For direct binding analysis, HCF mutants and VP16 were expressed by in vitrotranscription and translation using rabbit reticulocyte lysate (TnT, Promega) incorporating [35S]methionine. Proteins (2 μl of programmed lysate) were separated on SDS-10% polyacrylamide gels. Gels were fixed, amplified (Amplify, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and dried, and the amounts of 35S-labeled proteins were quantified using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Inc.). Binding reactions were performed in 20 μl containing ∼1 ng of 32P-labeled oligonucleotide probe containing the sequence ATGCTAATGATAT from the herpes simplex virus-1 IE110 promoter, 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 50 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 200 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm EDTA. Typically, purified POU domain (0.25–0.5 ng), VP16 (0.5–2 ng), and up to 3 μl of TnT lysate were used in each reaction as indicated in the figure legends. Minor adjustments were made based on the specific activity of the purified preparations. Formation of the complex between HCF N- and C-terminal regions via the recruitment of the HCF C terminus into the complex was more readily detected using higher amounts of VP16 and the programmed lysate, but this N·C complex could be assayed under standard conditions (see Figs. 7 and 9). Complexes were resolved and analyzed as described previously (37La Boissière S. Walker S. O'Hare P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 7108-7118Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) and quantitated using a PhosphorImager.Figure 9Amino acids 1786–2035 are necessary and sufficient for the HCF C terminus to interact with the N terminus, allowing formation of a VP16-induced complex containing both termini. Lysates were programmed with HCF N450 alone (lane 2) or together with each of the C-terminal variants (lanes 3–11). The control assay for the unprogrammed lysate is shown inlane 1. Lysates were incubated with the POU domain (0. 5 ng), VP16 (2.0 ng), and probe and analyzed as described for Fig. 2. The nonspecific complex is marked with an asterisk. The position of the complex formed only with HCF N450 is marked N, whereas the positions of complexes containing both HCF N450 and the various C-terminal mutants are marked N+C.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) VP16 (35S-labeled and unlabeled) and HCF mutants were expressed in vitro, and the lysates were precleared (15 min, 4 °C) on protein A-Sepharose beads washed in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, and 1% Nonidet P-40. VP16 and HCF mutants were then mixed in the same buffer and incubated (20 min) before the addition of anti-VP16 monoclonal antibody (LP1, 1:100, 2 h). Immune complexes were recovered on protein A-Sepharose beads (40 min), and the beads were washed four times in the same buffer. Bound proteins were separated on SDS-7.5% polyacrylamide gels. Gels were processed for detection and quantitation as described above. We and others have previously shown that assembly of TRF-C can be recapitulated in vitro using Oct-1, or its POU DNA-binding domain, purified VP16, and HCF supplied after in vitrotranscription and translation of the gene. To pursue dissection of important determinants within HCF, plasmids were constructed to allow expression and radiolabeling of deletion mutants of HCF using in vitro transcription and translation reactions in the presence of [35S]methionine (“TnT reactions”). Fig.1 a shows a representation of full-length HCF (with domains of interest indicated), together with the composition of the HCF variants examined in this work. The regions of strong homology between the human and C. elegans HCF proteins are indicated by the darkly hatched areas in HCF NC. Products from in vitro expression were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1 b), with lane numbers corresponding to the schematic in Fig. 1 a. Each of the mutants was expressed as a single protein species with relative migration as expected. We previously demonstrated that a HCF variant consisting of a fusion between the N- and C-terminal regions promoted VP16 complex formation much more efficiently than the N-terminal region alone (37La Boissière S. Walker S. O'Hare P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 7108-7118Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). To examine this further, the amino-terminal end of the “C” domain in HCF NC was progressively deleted in the series of mutants HCF NCa to NCe (Fig. 1 a). The region of this domain that is homologous to the C. elegans protein remains intact in NC, NCa, and NCb; is partially deleted in NCc and NCd; and is completely removed in NCe. The abilities of these mutant proteins and HCF N450 to form VP16-dependent complexes were compared in gel retardation assays. Equal amounts of the HCF mutants (at each of two doses) were incubated with intact purified VP16 and POU domain together with a 32P-labeled oligonucleotide probe containing a TAATGARAT motif. Complexes were separated by electrophoresis on nondenaturing gels and visualized by autoradiography (Fig. 2). Various controls were included in the experiments. The independent binding of the POU domain to the site is shown in Fig. 2 (lane 1). Under the conditions of these experiments, the POU domain and VP16 did not form a complex in the absence of HCF (lane 2). When unprogrammed lysate was included in the reaction, an additional band was seen representing a nonspecific DNA binding activity present in the lysate (lane 3, asterisk). Variable amounts of this complex were seen throughout these experiments, and although the explanation for this is unknown, it was not related to complex formation and was not investigated further. Additional controls with all the HCF mutants showed that the induced complexes were not observed when VP16 was omitted from the reactions or when a DNA probe containing an octamer site without a 3′-GARAT motif was used (data not shown). As reported previously (37La Boissière S. Walker S. O'Hare P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 7108-7118Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), complex formation was much more efficient with HCF NC (Fig. 2, lanes 4 and 5) than with HCF N450 (lanes 20 and 21, arrow). Mutants NCa to NCc promoted complex formation relatively efficiently (lanes 6–11). Note the progressively increasing mobility of the HCF-induced complexes, with the exception of NCc, which, although 50 residues smaller than NCb, migrated marginally more slowly. Deletion of the 52 residues between amino acids 1878 and 1930 (NCd) resulted in significantly less complex formation (lanes 12 and13). All of these constructs promoted complex formation much more efficiently than the construct with the N-terminal domain alone, N450. The construct with the shortest section of additional residues from the C terminus was NCe, which contained only the 31 extreme C-terminal amino acids (plus an epitope tag), yet this construct promoted complex formation significantly better than N450 (lanes 14 and 15). To examine if these C-terminal residues were critical for the more efficient complex formation, we deleted them from NCa to yield NCaΔe (Fig. 1). These results show that although there was some reduction upon deletion of the extreme C terminus, NCaΔe still promoted complex formation more efficiently than N450 (lanes 16 and 17). To ensure that the C-terminal epitope tag was not influencing complex formation, we removed it from NCe to yield NCeΔtag. Somewhat surprisingly, there was a relatively minor (3–4-fold) but reproducible reduction in complex formation (Fig. 2, lanes 18 and19). Nevertheless, neither the “e” region itself (residues 2004–2035) nor the epitope tag appeared to account for the more efficient complex formation promoted by NCe compared with N450. One additional difference between NCe and N450 was that NCe, as for the other NC mutants, contained residues 2–491 of the N terminus, rather than residues 2–450 of the original construct used to examine the independent N-terminal region. Therefore, we next constructed plasmids to express different lengths of the N terminus of HCF (see Fig. 1). HCF N491, the N-terminal region that is present in the NC mutants, was expressed both with and without a c-Myc tag at its C terminus (Fig. 1 a, constructs 10 and 11). HCF N538 has the same number of amino acids as HCF NCe and was created to examine whether the length of the HCF molecule, rather than its sequence, had any influence on complex formation (Fig. 1 a, construct 12). HCF N380 contains the kelch repeats only (Fig. 1 a, construct 13). The ability of these HCF variants to promote complex formation was assayed as before, using equal amounts of HCF at each of two doses (Fig. 3). Although marginally less efficient than HCF NCe, HCF N491 and N491tag both formed complexes much more efficiently than HCF N450 (Fig. 3, compare lanes 5–8 with lanes 3 and4). HCF N538 appeared to form a complex at least as well as HCF NCe, whereas HCF N380 also promoted complex formation much more efficiently than HCF N450. We further compared the efficiency of these N-terminal variants of HCF, this time using equal amounts of each in vitro translated variant (Fig. 4 a) with increasing amounts of VP16. The results again show that although HCF N450 is comparatively inefficient, HCF N380 promotes complex formation at least as well as HCF N491. Together, the data indicate that HCF N380 is sufficient to promote complex formation, in agreement with previous results (35Simmen K.A. Newell A. Robinson M. Mills J.S. Canning G. Handa R. Parkes K. Borkakoti N. Jupp R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 71: 3886-3894Google Scholar, 36Wilson A.C. Freiman R.N. Goto H. Nishimoto T. Herr W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6139-6146Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), but that the presence of residues 381–450 is detrimental for complex formation. Complex formation is recovered when HCF is extended to amino acid 491 and is increased further with extension to amino acid 538 or with the addition of regions of the C terminus (NC to NCe). The dissociation kinetics of the complexes formed with the different HCF mutants were compared. In this case, to measure starting complex formation with HCF N450, a higher dose of VP16 was used (corresponding to the top dose in Fig. 4, ∼10 ng/assay). Bulk binding reactions of HCF mutants, the POU domain, VP16, and radiolabeled DNA were prepared and allowed to bind to equilibrium. An excess of unlabeled DNA probe was then added; aliquots of the mixture were loaded onto running gels at various times thereafter; and complexes were analyzed as before. Amounts of complexes remaining at each time point were quantified and are expressed graphically as percentages of the amount observed immediately before the addition of competitor DNA for each variant (Fig. 5). Complexes formed with HCF N450, N491, or N491tag were significantly less stable than those formed with either a longer or a shorter section of the N terminus (N380 or N538). It is noteworthy that although HCF N491 promoted complex formation relatively well (Figs. 3 and 4), the complex was as unstable as that formed with HCF N450. HCF has been shown to interact directly with VP16 in the absence of the other components of TRF-C (28Katan M. Haigh A. Verrijzer C.P. van der Vliet P. O'Hare P.

Direct interaction between VP16 and the HCF mutants was assayed by HCF co-immunoprecipitation using antibodies directed against VP16. Equal amounts of HCF mutant proteins were incubated with35S-labeled or unlabeled VP16 expressed in vitro. Unlabeled VP16 was used in the co-precipitation assays since the test HCF species might be masked by comigrating radiolabeled VP16. Monoclonal antibody against VP16 (LP1) was added; immune complexes were recovered and washed; and the proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Fig. 6 a shows the equalized input amounts of HCF mutants and VP16. A control demonstrated that VP16 was recovered only in the presence of antibody (Fig.6 b, lanes 1 and 2). For each HCF variant, the first lane shows the background control, precipitated in the absence of VP16, and should be compared with thethird lane showing precipitation in the presence of unlabeled VP16. (Precipitation of VP16 is demonstrated for each test variant using radiolabeled VP16 in the middle lane of each panel.) Quantitation of the amounts of mutants recovered was performed by analysis on a PhosphorImager. Specific co-precipitation above background was observed for each of the variants HCF NC, NCe, N538, N491, and N380. In contrast, the amount of HCF N450 r"

Resistance to arsenical and antimonial salts in Escherichia coli is conferred by the ars operon of conjugative R-factor R773 (1Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 1996; 1: 273-277Crossref Scopus (91) Google Scholar). This operon encodes an ATP-coupled efflux pump that actively transports the trivalent arsenicals and antimonials out of the cell; reducing the intracellular concentration of those metalloid oxyanions to subtoxic levels produces resistance (2Dey S. Rosen B.P. Georgopapadakou N.H. Drug Transport in Antimicrobial and Anticancer Chemotherapy. Marcel Dekker, New York1995: 103-132Google Scholar). The pump is composed of two subunits, ArsA, a 63-kDa catalytic subunit, and ArsB, a 45-kDa integral membrane protein that is the membrane anchor for ArsA and the oxyanion-translocating sector of the pump (3Dey S. Dou D. Tisa L.S. Rosen B.P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 311: 418-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). ArsA can be purified as a soluble ATPase in the absence of ArsB (4Rosen B.P. Weigel U. Karkaria C. Gangola P. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 3067-3070Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ArsA is arranged into two homologous halves, the N-terminal (A1) (residues 1–282) and C-terminal (A2) (residues 321–583) domains, which are connected by a flexible linker (residues 283–320) (5Chen C.-M. Misra T.K. Silver S. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 15030-15038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Kaur P. Adv. Mol. Cell Biol. 1998; 23B: 453-488Google Scholar). Each domain contains the consensus sequence for the phosphate binding loop (P-loop) of an ATP-binding site (7Walker J.E. Saraste M. Runswick M.J. Gay N.J. EMBO J. 1982; 1: 945-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (4269) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis of these sequences indicates that both of the putative nucleotide binding sites are required for catalysis and resistance (8Karkaria C.E. Chen C.M. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7832-7836Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Kaur P. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19272-19277Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Intergenic complementation and intragenic suppression studies on ArsA were suggestive of a model in which a single catalytic site was formed at the interface of an A1 and an A2 ATP binding site, possibly within a homodimer (10Kaur P. Rosen B.P. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 351-357Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Li J. Liu S. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25247-25252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). To investigate the interaction of nucleotides with the A1 and A2 sites, we have conducted stopped-flow fluorescence experiments on ArsA. We have previously shown that intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence can be used to investigate the interaction of ArsA with its ligands (12Zhou T. Liu S. Rosen B.P. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13622-13626Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). However, the presence of multiple tryptophan residues in ArsA decreased the signal-to-noise response to ligand binding, leading us to construct single tryptophan derivatives of ArsA that are optically responsive to the binding of substrates or products (13Zhou T. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19731-19737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Mutant arsAgenes were constructed containing single tryptophan codons (13Zhou T. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19731-19737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Tryptophan residues 253, 522, and 524 were changed to tyrosine residues, and a six-histidine tag was added to the C terminus, producing a histidine-tagged ArsA containing only Trp159(W159H6) (13Zhou T. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19731-19737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The single tryptophan-containing W159H6 ArsA gave approximately a 4-fold increase in the signal-to-noise ratio in response to MgATP/mol of tryptophan residue when compared with the wild type enzyme (13Zhou T. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19731-19737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). We have used this ArsA derivative for the transient kinetic studies reported herein. It has proved possible to monitor the interaction of MgATP with W159H6 by stopped-flow fluorescence spectroscopy. Based on these analyses, we propose a model for the mechanism of MgATP binding and hydrolysis. ArsA W159H6 ArsA was purified as described previously (13Zhou T. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19731-19737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), quickly frozen, and stored in small aliquots at −80 °C. The concentration of purified ArsA was determined by UV absorbance at 280 nm. The extinction coefficient for W159H6 ArsA was calculated to be 20,250 m−1cm−1 (14Aitken A. Leamonth M. Walker J.M. The Protein Protocols Handbook. Humana Press, Clifton, New Jersey1996: 3-6Crossref Google Scholar). A continuous assay was used to monitor phosphate production by ArsA. Essentially, the absorbance change at 360 nm associated with the phosphorolysis of 2-amino-6-mercapto-7-methylpurine by the inorganic phosphate generated by the ATPase activity was monitored (15Webb M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4884-4887Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). The phosphorolysis reaction was catalyzed by purine nucleotide phosphorylase. The components of the assay were provided as part of an EnzCheck phosphate assay kit (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) and used according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Assays were performed in 40 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 2 mm MgCl2, containing 0.2 mm sodium azide. The change in absorbance with time was measured in a Unicam (UV2) UV-visible spectrometer. Absorbance changes were converted into phosphate concentrations with ΔE 360 = 12 mm−1cm−1. Fluorescence measurements were performed in a Jasco FP777 spectrofluorometer maintained at 20 °C. The excitation wavelength was set at 292.5 nm for selective excitation of tryptophan fluorescence, and the emission was monitored at a wavelength of 340 nm. The bandwidths for both emission and excitation monochromators were 3 nm. The concentration of ArsA was 5 μm unless otherwise noted in 50 mmMOPS 1The abbreviation used is: MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid. -KOH (pH 7.5), 0.25 mm EDTA. In addition, time-resolved fluorescence measurements were also carried out in an Applied Photophysics (London, UK) SX.18MV stopped-flow instrument, operated at 20 °C. For measurements of the change in tryptophan fluorescence, the samples were excited with light at 292.5 nm, selected with a monochromator, and the emission monitored at wavelengths above 335 nm, using a cut-off filter. Invariably, equal volumes of the reactants were mixed together in the stopped-flow instrument, using two syringes of equal volume. Standard conditions for multiple turnover experiments were 5 μm ArsA and for single turnover experiments, 25 μm ArsA. All concentrations are for the mixing chamber, unless stated otherwise, so that the concentrations in the syringe were twice those quoted for the mixing chamber. The phosphate burst data was analyzed in terms of an exponential plus linear function using the nonlinear regression routine of the software package, SIGMAPLOT 4.0 (SPSS Software Inc., Chicago, IL). Stopped-flow traces were analyzed by fitting to single or multiple exponential functions, as appropriate, using the nonlinear regression software with the Applied Photophysics stopped-flow. Concentration dependence data were analyzed by nonlinear regression fitting to hyperbolic functions, using SIGMAPLOT 4.0. Kinetic simulations were set up using the program Pro-K (Applied Photophysics), which uses the Marquardt-Levenberg algorithm for global optimization of the reaction parameters. Previously we established that the tryptophan fluorescence of ArsA (W159H6) was sensitive to the binding of MgATP (13Zhou T. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19731-19737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Fig.1 A shows the change in tryptophan fluorescence when 5 μm ArsA was manually mixed with 1 mm MgATP; the reaction was initiated by the addition of 5 mm MgCl2 to 5 μm ArsA, 1.0 mm ATP. There was a rapid biphasic increase in the tryptophan fluorescence, to reach a plateau, before the fluorescence decayed back to the baseline level (as defined by the fluorescence of 5 μm ArsA, 1.0 mm ATP), suggesting that little product MgADP remains bound to the ArsA. However, the addition of EDTA at the end of the reaction, to chelate the Mg2+, caused a further decrease in tryptophan fluorescence, suggesting that some product MgADP remained bound at the end of the reaction (Fig.1 A). A potentially plausible explanation for the fluorescence profile of the reaction is that the binding of MgATP to the ArsA induces an enhancement in the tryptophan fluorescence, which remains constant until the ATP has been depleted, at which point the fluorescence decays as the products are released. To test this hypothesis, the mixing experiment was repeated with higher concentrations of ArsA and ATP. The period during which the enhanced fluorescence remained constant should have been diminished for higher ArsA and extended for higher ATP if this phase was determined by the time taken for the steady-state turnover of the ATP. As shown in Fig.1, B and C, no significant effect was observed upon this phase with either higher ATP or ArsA concentrations, respectively. This suggested that the enhancement in tryptophan fluorescence was due to a transient build up and decay of a reaction intermediate. The addition of excess EDTA rapidly reduced the ArsA fluorescence, presumably due to the dissociation of ADP in the absence of Mg2+ (Fig. 1), thus suggesting that the intermediate was an ArsA-Mg2+ nucleotide complex because MgCl2alone did not produce a change in the fluorescence of the ArsA (data not shown). The addition of EDTA to ArsA or ArsA/Mg2+ did not produce any change in the fluorescence of the ArsA and only a small decrease with ArsA/MgADP (data not shown). This behavior suggests that the intermediate was ArsA-MgADP·Pi. 2These data also indicate that no residual ADP remains bound to the ArsA protein following its purification. We have investigated the kinetics of formation of this intermediate in detail using stopped-flow fluorescence spectroscopy. A typical stopped-flow trace for the mixing of 5 μm ArsA, 0.5 mm ATP with 5 mm MgCl2 (mixing chamber concentrations) is shown in trace A of Fig.2. The trace was similar to that observed in manual mixing experiments but the rapid-mixing experiment identified more complex behavior at shorter times. Over the first 10 s, the profile was clearly multiphasic with a very fast increase in fluorescence, followed by a moderately fast decrease and then a slow increase in fluorescence (Fig. 3). Although the two fast phases merged, they were well resolved from the slow phase. Accordingly, the initial part of the trace was analyzed as a double exponential (during the first 4 s) and then as a single exponential over the remainder of the trace. The three phases occurred with rate constants of 52 s−1 (phase 1), 5.2 s−1 (phase 2), and 0.026 s−1 (phase 3), respectively (Fig. 3). The entire data set was also fitted to a triple exponential, which indicated similar rate constants of 48 s−1, 5.2 s−1, and 0.027 s−1 for the three phases, respectively. The slow decay of the enhanced fluorescence back toward the baseline occurred with a rate constant of approximately 2.4 × 10−3 s−1 (phase 4). Previous studies apparently indicated that the slow decay in fluorescence (phase 4) correlates with the rate of Piproduction under limited turnover conditions (e.g. 5 μm ArsA and 20 μm MgATP), suggesting that this phase is attributable to the product release step (13Zhou T. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19731-19737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar).Figure 3A stopped-flow record for the mixing of ArsA, 500 μm ATP with 5 mmMgCl2 shown over four time bases that differ from one another by an order of magnitude. The traces illustrate phase 3 (A), phase 2 and 3 (B), phase 1 and 2 (C), and phase 1 (D). The smooth curve through each trace is the best-fit to a triple exponential equation with rate constants of 48.0 (±1.02) s−1, 5.2 (±0.26) s−1 and 0.027 (±0.0023) s−1. One vertical division in traces A, B, C, and D represent a fluorescence change of 0.25, 0.5, 1.25, and 1.25%, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To clarify the mechanism, the dependence of the rate and amplitude of each phase upon the ATP concentration was determined. The amplitude of phase 2 decreased with the ATP concentration to a level around 200 μm ATP where it could no longer be distinguished from phases 1 and 3. At these concentrations, the rate constant for phase 1 was determined either by fitting to a single exponential function over the first few seconds of the trace or to a double exponential function over the entire trace (e.g. 200 s). The rate constant for the very fast phase (phase 1) increased in an apparently hyperbolic manner with the ATP concentration up to a maximum around 1.5 mm and then decreased at higher concentrations (Fig.4). 3A possible interpretation of this behavior is that there are two fluorescent transients, one of which becomes too fast to measure at high ATP concentrations. At intermediate ATP concentrations, a single exponential fit of the data is biased by a contribution from the first transient, whereas at higher ATP concentrations, the observed change reflects the second transition alone. The data obtained at ATP concentrations up to 1.5 mm could be fitted to a hyperbola, indicating maximal and minimal rates of binding of 53.9 s−1 and 7.3 s−1, and aK d of 178 μm. A minimal value can be calculated for the second-order association rate constant for the binding of ATP to the ArsA from (k max +k min)/K d, yielding a value of 0.34 × 106m−1s−1. For a fixed ATP concentration, the rate constant for phase 1 was independent of the Mg2+ concentration (data not shown). Over the ATP concentration range that phase 2 could be reliably measured, the rate constant for this phase had little concentration dependence, varying between 4.5 s−1 and 6.5 s−1 (Fig. 4, ▪). This behavior is consistent with the simple three-step mechanism shown in SchemeFS1, where the first step is a rapid equilibrium with binding constant K 2(K 2 =k −2/k 2) followed by transitions to states with high fluorescence enhancement (e.g. ArsA4-MgATP) and lower fluorescence enhancement (e.g. ArsA5-MgATP). The fluorescence transient fits two exponential terms with observed rate constants,k(1) = k −3 +k 3[MgATP]/([MgATP] +K 2) and k(2) =k 4 + k −4. The ratio of the amplitudes of the two exponential phases at high substrate concentration will provide a measure of the ratio of enhancements for the two states, calculated as 2.6 (16Ma Y.-Z. Taylor E.W. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13234-13241Google Scholar).Figure FS1View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The concentration dependence of the amplitude of phase 1 indicated an overall equilibrium constant of 760 μm (Fig.5). A plausible explanation for this behavior is that the ArsA protein exists in two interconverting conformations (e.g. ArsA1 and ArsA2) that differ in their affinities for ATP 4This is a minimal scheme because we have assumed that the MgATP only binds to the ArsA2 conformation. (see SchemeFS2). The overall K d is a function of both K 1 andK 2: K d =K 2(1 + K 1)). Accordingly,K 1 can be calculated, from the overallK d and K 2, as 3.33, indicating that 77% of the ArsA is in the ArsA1conformation before the binding of MgATP. Because the rate of phase 1 increased with the ATP concentration but was independent of the Mg2+ concentration, this implies that we were monitoring the binding of MgATP to the ArsA. A possibility is that the ArsA1 state is stabilized by the nonproductive binding of ATP in the absence of Mg2+, which must dissociate before MgATP can bind.Figure FS2View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Neither the rate constant for, nor the amplitude of, the slow increase in fluorescence (e.g. phase 3) had any apparent dependence upon the ATP concentration (data not shown). The rate constant varied nonsystematically between 0.025 and 0.05 s−1 (data not shown). The rate constant for the slow decay in fluorescence back to the baseline (phase 4) occurred with a rate constant of 2.3 × 10−3 s−1 that was also independent of the ATP concentration (data not shown). Consequently suggesting that these phases are attributable to a further isomerization of the ArsA-nucleotide complex (e.g. the formation and decay of ArsA6). In a parallel set of experiments, the binding of MgATP to ArsA was investigated. A typical stopped-flow trace for the mixing of 5 μm ArsA with 0.5 mm ATP,5 mmMgCl2 is shown in Fig. 2 B. The binding of MgATP to ArsA was characterized by a slow, apparently monophasic, fluorescence enhancement that occurred with a rate constant of 0.0334 s−1. Thus, this phase occurred at a rate comparable with the slow fluorescence enhancement that occurred when the reaction was initiated by mixing ArsA/ATP with Mg2+ (cf.0.026 s−1). However, the fast increase (phase 1) and decrease (phase 2) in fluorescence, which occurred within 4 s of initiating the reaction with Mg2+, were not apparent. There was an indication of a hyperbolic increase in the rate constant, between 0.022 s−1 and 0.058 s−1, for the slow enhancement in fluorescence when ArsA was mixed with MgATP. This behavior is consistent with a two-step binding mechanism. The rapid equilibrium binding of the ATP, which is rate limited by a slow isomerization of the ArsA·ATP complex (e.g. k 1,k −1 ≫k 2,k −2) is shown in Scheme FS3. The data could be fitted to a hyperbolic equation for such a model:k obs = k −2 +k 2[MgATP]/([MgATP] +K 1), yielding values forK 1, k 2, andk −2 of 624 μm, 0.038 s−1 and 0.022 s−1, respectively (Fig.6 A). The overallK d would be given by the following function:K d(overall) =K 1/(1 +k 2/k −2), indicating aK d of 232 (±75.5) μm. The amplitude of the ATP-induced fluorescence enhancement increased in a hyperbolic manner with the ATP concentration, indicating an overall dissociation constant (K d) of 427 (±62.3) μm (Fig.6 B). Hence, there is a small discrepancy between the predicted and measured overall K d, which could readily be reconciled by postulating a further conformational transition of the ArsA·MgATP complex. However, this seems unwarranted at this time considering the difficulty in measuring the small increase in the rate constants k 2 andk −2 and the consequent error inK 1. This behavior contrasts with that for the Mg2+ initiated reaction, where the amplitude of the slow increase in fluorescence was apparently independent of the ATP concentration. A plausible explanation is that the MgATP initially binds to an ArsA state that does not produce any change in fluorescence but which is followed by a slow transition to a state with an enhanced fluorescence. When the ArsA was pre-equilibrated with Mg2+before initiating the reaction by mixing with ATP, the traces were similar to those generated by mixing ArsA with MgATP (data not shown). This indicates that if Mg2+ can bind to ArsA in the absence of nucleotides then this must be a rapid equilibrium process. These differences in the kinetics of MgATP binding indicate that ATP can bind to ArsA in the absence of Mg2+ to induce the protein to adopt a different conformation. As shown in Fig. 7 A, when 25 μm ArsA (a 50 μm nucleotide binding site concentration) was mixed with 25 μm MgATP the stopped-flow trace generated was similar to those obtained under multiple turnover conditions (e.g. 5 μm ArsA with 500 μm MgATP). There was an increase in fluorescence, which occurred with a rate constant of 3.6 × 10−2 s−1, and a subsequent decay in fluorescence that occurred with a rate constant of 7.8 × 10−4 s−1. The protein fluorescence decayed back to a level lower than the start of the trace, indicating that there is a very fast increase in fluorescence probably due to the binding of ATP. Indeed, we consistently noted a rapid increase in fluorescence at the start of the single turnover traces that occurred with a rate constant of approximately 20 s−1. In comparison with multiple turnovers, the amplitude of the decay phase was greater in relation to that of the enhancement phase, suggesting that ADP remained bound to the ArsA after multiple turnovers. In contrast, when 25 μm ArsA was incubated with 25 μm ATP before mixing with 5 mmMgCl2 in the stopped-flow instrument, there was a rapid increase in the protein fluorescence (phases 1 and 2), followed by a slow decay (phase 4) (Fig. 7 B). There was no slow increase in fluorescence (phase 3). It was possible to fit the data to a triple exponential function with the increase and the biphasic decrease in fluorescence occurring with rate constants of 12.3 s−1 (phase 1), 6.22 s−1 (phase 2), and 2.0 × 10−3 s−1 (phase 4), respectively. The rate constants for phases 1, 2, and 4 were comparable with the calculated rate of ATP binding (cf. 14 s−1 for 25 μm ATP) and with the rate of fluorescence decay under multiple turnover conditions (cf. 4.5–6.5 s−1for phase 2 and 2.3 × 10−3 s−1 for phase 4), respectively. Although there was no slow enhancement in fluorescence (e.g. phase 3) under these single turnover conditions, the amplitude of the decay phases (e.g. phase 4) when ArsA/ATP was mixed with Mg2+ was similar to that when ArsA was mixed with MgATP (e.g. 3.0% versus2.3% fluorescence change, respectively). This slow decay in fluorescence cannot be attributed to multiple turnovers, which depleted the concentration of this intermediate, during the latter stages of the reaction, because this phase was independent of the ATP concentration (cf. from measurements of single and multiple turnovers). The slow increase and decrease in fluorescence presumably represents the transient formation of an intermediate that forms and decays at rates of 6.5 s−1 and 2.3 × 10−3s−1, respectively. If this is an in-line intermediate then the pre-equilibration with ATP (in the absence of Mg2+) must induce the ArsA to adopt a similar conformation. The binding of MgADP to ArsA was characterized by a small enhancement in the tryptophan fluorescence, precluding a rigorous analysis of the kinetics of binding. However, when ArsA was mixed with a relatively high MgADP concentration (e.g. 10 mm), the stopped-flow traces generated were similar to those for the binding of MgATP to ArsA, which had been pre-equilibrated with ATP. There was a rapid increase and decrease in the fluorescence, followed by a slow increase but not a subsequent decrease (Fig.8). Recently, we have established that the W141H6 ArsA mutant has greater optical sensitivity to the binding of ADP, and a detailed analysis of the ADP binding mechanism for this mutant will be presented elsewhere. To test whether the dissociation of MgADP was a rapid or slow process, the ArsA·MgADP complex was chased with excess MgATP. Clearly, if MgADP dissociation was a rapid process then we would have expected to observe an increase in the ArsA fluorescence as the MgATP bound. On the other hand, if dissociation of the MgADP was slow, then we would have expected to observe a decrease in the fluorescence as the MgADP dissociated. When 5 μmArsA was equilibrated with 50 μm ADP, 5 mmMgCl2, and mixed with 500 μm ATP in a stopped-flow device, there was a relatively slow decrease in fluorescence, presumably as the ADP was displaced, followed by a slow increase in fluorescence, presumably as the ATP was hydrolyzed (Fig.9). The amplitude of the decrease in fluorescence increased in a hyperbolic manner with the ArsA/MgADP incubation time (Figs. 9 and 10), indicating that the ADP induced a slow conformational change in the ArsA, which occurred with a rate constant of 1.62 × 10−4 s−1. This behavior is consistent with the increase in ArsA fluorescence that we have noted upon the binding MgADP to ArsA. This conformational change was to a form that allowed more rapid product release because the rate constant for the dissociation process increased from 0.076 to 0.131 s−1over the 8-h incubation time (Fig. 10).Figure 10The kinetics of a slow ADP-induced conformation change in ArsA. 5 μm ArsA was equilibrated with 50 μm ADP, 5 mmMgCl2 for the indicated times before mixing with 500 μm ATP in a stopped-flow device to displace the bound ADP. Both the rate and amplitude of the signal increased in an exponential manner with respective rate constants of 1.8 × 10−2 (±5.0 × 10−3) s−1, and 1.3 × 10−2 (±8.4 × 10−4) s−1. The smooth curves through the data points are the fits to a single exponential function.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) A burst in phosphate production was identified using a continuous assay to monitor phosphate release from ArsA. As shown in Fig. 11, when 1 μm ArsA was mixed with 50 μm ATP there was an exponential increase in the phosphate concentration during the first 400 s, followed by a linear steady-state release of phosphate. 5Less than 10% of the ATP was hydrolyzed over the studied time course., 6The data was best-fitted to an exponential plus a linear term with a nonzero intercept (e.g. a nonzero absorbance at the start of the experiment) as judged by a 400% decrease in residual variance of the fit. We have found a small upward drift in the absorbance of the reactants before the addition of the ArsA to initiate the reaction. The rate of the pre-steady-state phase only increased slightly with increasing ATP concentration to a value of 3.7 × 10−3 s−1 for 300 μm ATP. The pre-steady-state phase could not be readily resolved from the steady-state phase for higher ATP concentrations. In conclusion, during the phosphate burst approximately 2 nmol 7Eight measurements gave an average burst of 1.7 (±0.28) nmol. of phosphate were released at a rate faster than 3.7 × 10−3s−1 (for near saturating ATP concentrations). The steady-state rate, as determined from the linear part of the phosphate release time course, increased in a hyperbolic manner with the ATP concentration to a maximal level around 200 μmATP and thereafter was subject to substrate inhibition (Fig.12). Hence, values forV max, K m, andK i, the substrate inhibition constant, were determined from a fit of the data to the following equation for substrate inhibition: v =V max[ATP]/K m + [ATP] + [ATP]2/K i. This analysis yielded values for V max, K m, andK i of 5.4 × 10−3 nmol s−1·nmol−1 ArsA, 72 μm and 792 μm, respectively, and indicated ak cat of 5.4 × 10−3s−1 (single site catalysis) or 2.7 × 10−3 s−1 (two-site catalysis). ArsA is the catalytic subunit of the arsenite transporter and is thought to couple the hydrolysis of ATP to the movement of arsenicals and antimonials through the membrane-spanning ArsB protein. Consequently, knowledge of the ArsA ATPase mechanism will provide information of fundamental importance in understanding the energy transduction processes common to many transporters that are driven by ATP hydrolysis, such as those belonging to the ABC superfamily.

https://openalex.org/W2002401190,"Analysis of the three-dimensional crystal structure of the Dictyostelium myosin motor domain revealed that the myosin head is required to bend at residues Ile-455 and Gly-457 to produce the conformation changes observed in the ternary complexes that resemble the pre- and post-hydrolysis states (Fisher, A. J., Smith, C. A., Thoden, J. B., Smith, R., Sutoh, K., Holden, H. M., and Rayment, I. (1995) Biochemistry34, 8960–8972). Asp-454, Ile-455, and Gly-457 of smooth muscle myosin were substituted by Ala, Met, and Ala, respectively, and the mechano-enzymatic activities were determined to study the role of these residues in myosin motor function. Whereas the basal steady-state Mg2+-ATPase activity of D454A was higher than that of the wild type, the rate of the hydrolytic step is reduced ∼2,000-fold and becomes rate-limiting. M-ATP rather than M-ADP-P is the predominant steady-state intermediate, and the initial Pi burst and the ATP-induced enhancement of intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence are absent in D454A. D454A binds actin in the absence of ATP but is not dissociated from actin by ATP. Moreover, actin inhibits rather than activates the ATPase activity; consequently, D454A does not support actin translocating activity. I455M has normal actin-activated ATPase activity, Pi burst, and ATP-induced enhancement of intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence, suggesting that the enzymatic properties are normal. However, the actin translocating activity was completely inhibited. This suggests that the side chain at Ile-455 is critical for myosin motor activity but not for relatively normal enzymatic function, which indicates an apparent uncoupling between enzymatic activity and motile function. Although G457A has normal ATP-dependent actin dissociation, ATP hydrolytic step is reduced by ∼105-fold in the presence or absence of actin; consequently, G457A does not have actin translocating activity. These results indicate the importance of these conserved residues at the hinge region for normal myosin motor function.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5404-5417Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). The myosin head contains several clefts, which divide the motor domain into distinct subdomains. The cleft that splits the 50-kDa central segment of myosin S1 extends from the nucleotide binding pocket to the actin binding interface, and it is proposed that this cleft closes after ATP hydrolysis (8Rayment I.

Sci. 1994; 19: 129-134Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). This opening and closing process is thought to be coupled with weak and strong binding states, respectively. Furthermore, it is suggested that the closure of the nucleotide binding pocket triggers a conformational change to generate a bent configuration (12Wakabayashi K. Tokunaga M. Kohno I. Sugimoto T. Hamanaka Y. Takezawa T. Wakabayashi T. Amemiya Y. Science. 1992; 258: 443-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), which is coupled with cross-bridge movement. ATP is bound in a narrow tunnel formed by two loops composed of amino acid residues, which are highly conserved in the myosin superfamily (4Mooseker M.S. Chenney R.E. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1995; 11: 633-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). There are a number of interactions between the triphosphate moiety and the amino acid residues of myosin, which are thought to be important for tight ATP binding, rapid ATP hydrolysis, and the stabilization of the myosin·ADP·Pi metastable ternary complex.Kinetic studies indicate that the release of Pioccurs before the release of ADP from myosin·ADP·Pi(13Trentham D.R. Eccleston J.F. Bagshaw C.R. Q. Rev. Biophys. 1976; 9: 217-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). The analysis of the three-dimensional crystal structure of myosin·ADP· vanadate suggests that the phosphate cannot depart from the myosin active site via the same route as ATP enters, and it was proposed that the phosphate leaves the active site through the bottom of the active site pocket (14Yount R.G. Lawson D. Rayment I. Biophys. J. 1995; 68: 44s-49sPubMed Google Scholar). The binding of actin was proposed to promote the movement of the P-loop to allow the phosphate to leave via the back door (14Yount R.G. Lawson D. Rayment I. Biophys. J. 1995; 68: 44s-49sPubMed Google Scholar) in the 50-kDa fragment. In the presence of actin, the rate of product release is increased 100-fold for smooth muscle myosin S1 (15White H.D. Belknap B. Webb M.R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11828-11836Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), and the rate of the associated hydrolysis step (AM·ATP → AM·ADP·Pi), which is rate-limiting at saturating actin is decreased 4–5-fold by actin. It has been hypothesized that the movement of myosin relative to actin is achieved by a conformational change in myosin. A critical problem is the identification of such a conformational change coupled with actin sliding. Using small angle x-ray diffraction, Wakabayashi et al. (12Wakabayashi K. Tokunaga M. Kohno I. Sugimoto T. Hamanaka Y. Takezawa T. Wakabayashi T. Amemiya Y. Science. 1992; 258: 443-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) found that the myosin head forms a bent conformation after ATP hydrolysis, whereas it forms a rather extended conformation in the absence of ATP. This view was further elucidated at an atomic level by Fisher et al. (9Fisher A.J. Smith C.A. Thoden J.B. Smith R. Sutoh K. Holden H.M. Rayment I. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8960-8972Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar) and Smith and Rayment (10Smith C.A. Rayment I. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5404-5417Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar) by analyzing the crystal structure of the three ternary complexes of myosin that are thought to be analogues of the pre- and post-hydrolytic myosin-substrate complexes. A comparison of the pre- and post-hydrolysis structures revealed that the myosin motor domain bends at Ile-455 and Gly-457 1We have used sequence numbers forDictyostelium myosin for ease in comparison with the structural studies of the active site. The corresponding gizzard smooth muscle myosin sequence numbers (in parentheses) are Asp-454 (Asp-465), Ile-455 (Ile-466), and Gly-457 (Gly-468). 1We have used sequence numbers forDictyostelium myosin for ease in comparison with the structural studies of the active site. The corresponding gizzard smooth muscle myosin sequence numbers (in parentheses) are Asp-454 (Asp-465), Ile-455 (Ile-466), and Gly-457 (Gly-468). located at the β-strand, which lies between the upper part and the lower part of the central 50-kDa domain of the myosin head. This suggests that a flexible hinge region in the myosin motor domain has a critical role in the coupling of ATP hydrolysis to mechanical work.In the present study, we have made three mutant myosins in which the residues in the flexible hinge region are altered, and we analyzed the mechano-enzymatic properties to better understand the mechanism of the coupling between ATP hydrolysis and mechanical work in myosin.DISCUSSIONThere are two conserved sequences present in many nucleotide-binding proteins, as originally found by Walker et al. (33Walker J.E. Saraste M. Runswick M.J. Gay N.J. EMBO J. 1982; 1: 945-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (4220) Google Scholar). One is the P-loop that forms the triphosphate binding site, and the other corresponds to residues 454–457 in the myosin motor domain. The corresponding region in G-protein is called switch II because this region changes conformation upon GTP hydrolysis (34Milburn M.V. Tong L. deVos A.M. Brunger A. Yamaizumi Z. Nishimura S. Kim S.H. Science. 1990; 247: 939-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (836) Google Scholar, 35Pai E.F. Krengel U. Petsko G.A. Goody R.S. Kabsch W. Wittinghofer A. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2351-2359Crossref PubMed Scopus (958) Google Scholar). A comparison of the structure of the myosin·ADP·BeFx complex with myosin or the myosin· ADP·AlF4 complex indicates that a partial closure of the narrow cleft in the central 50-kDa segment upon the hydrolysis of ATP results in the movement of the lower domain of the central 50-kDa segment (9Fisher A.J. Smith C.A. Thoden J.B. Smith R. Sutoh K. Holden H.M. Rayment I. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8960-8972Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar, 10Smith C.A. Rayment I. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5404-5417Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). This requires flexibility in the peptide backbone of residues 454–457 in the switch II sequence. Another conserved residue in switch II, Asp-454, forms a hydrogen bond to a water molecule, which is coordinated to the Mg2+ that is also coordinated by the β-γ-phosphate of ATP and may play a key role in the mechano-enzymatic activity of myosin. In the present study, three smooth muscle myosin mutants with alterations in three residues in the switch II loop that might be critical for myosin motor function are expressed in Sf9 cells, and their mechano-enzymatic properties are characterized.The substitution of Asp-454 with Ala abolishes the hydrogen bonding of the side chain of residue 454 to the Mg2+ ion coordinated with the triphosphate moiety of ATP. This mutation severely disrupted normal myosin enzymatic and motor function. The results can be summarized as follows: D454A can form a rigor complex with actin, but ATP does not dissociate D454A from actin. Although the structure of the actin binding interface is preserved, the ATP-induced conformational change required to reduce actin affinity is disrupted. This is either because the affinity of ATP is reduced or because the normal coupling between the nucleotide and actin binding sites is severely disrupted. Although K ATP for D454A is increased in the presence of actin, the ATPase activity is concentration-independent above 0.1 mm ATP. Because a high concentration of ATP (up to 10 mm) failed to dissociate D454A from actin, the latter possibility is more likely. Although D454A shows significant basal Mg2+-ATPase activity, it has neither actin-activated ATPase activity nor an initial Pi burst.Based upon the three-dimensional structure of the myosin motor domain (10Smith C.A. Rayment I. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5404-5417Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar), there is a water molecule that forms a hydrogen bond with the γ-phosphate of ATP in the active site (Fig.7). This water molecule is expected to nucleophilically attack the γ-phosphate of ATP for hydrolysis. Therefore, it is plausible that the disruption of the Asp-454-water-Mg2+ interaction results in the displacement of γ-phosphate from the proper position in the active site at which it is normally attacked by a water molecule.Figure 7Three-dimensional structure of the switch II region of the myosin·MgADP·Vi complex. This shows a ribbon representation of the switch II region of myosin along with the bound ADP/Vi. The figure also shows the interactions of the conserved amino acid residues in the loops with the triphosphate moiety of ATP. The N-terminal, central, and C-terminal segments of the heavy chain are colored in green, red, and blue, respectively. ADP, Vi, and Mg2+ are colored in magenta, gray, and yellow, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Consistent with these enzymological results, the substitution of Asp-454 by Ala completely abolished the actin translocating activity. Asp-454 is completely conserved among the various myosins sequenced thus far, including myosin III, the most divergent member of myosin superfamily (4Mooseker M.S. Chenney R.E. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1995; 11: 633-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). This is reasonable because the substitution of this residue would be expected to cause severe disruption of myosin motor function.In contrast, the mutation of Ile-455 to Met did not significantly alter the enzymatic activities of myosin, i.e. actin-activated ATPase activity, tryptophan fluorescence enhancement, Piburst, and ATP-induced rapid dissociation from actin. Nevertheless, the actin translocating activity was also completely abolished in I455M. Because normal Pi burst and the actin-activated ATPase activity were retained in this mutant, the myosin·ADP·Pi metastable ternary complex is produced with nearly normal kinetics, and the change in the intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence of myosin upon ATP binding was also nearly normal. Previously, it was suggested by using energy transfer results (36Hiratsuka T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14941-14948Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and by three-dimensional structural analysis (10Smith C.A. Rayment I. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5404-5417Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar) that the tryptophan residues responsible for the change in fluorescence induced by ATP binding to myosin are Trp-501 and either Trp-113 or Trp-131. Trp-501 is surrounded by the hydrophobic residues Tyr-494, Phe-503, Phe-692, and Gly-691 in the hydrophobic environment of the myosin·ADP·Vi complex. In nucleotide-free myosin, one edge of Trp-501 is exposed to solvent. Although the mechanism for tryptophan fluorescence enhancement is not completely understood, the present results suggest that the segment of random coil containing Trp-501 experienced similar environmental changes in I455M and in the wild type. According to the three-dimensional structural analysis, it was suggested that the myosin motor domain bends at Gly-457 and Ile-455 upon ATP hydrolysis (9Fisher A.J. Smith C.A. Thoden J.B. Smith R. Sutoh K. Holden H.M. Rayment I. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8960-8972Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is plausible that the substitution of Ile-455 by Met disrupts the proper change in the torsional angle at residue 455 that is necessary for actin sliding upon product release. There are two possible explanations for the apparently normal ATP hydrolysis mechanism observed for I455M and its lack of motility: 1) the actual mechanism for the loss of motility in I455M could be due to a defect in the enzymatic pathway that has not yet been identified, and 2) ATP hydrolysis and motility are uncoupled by this mutation. Thus far, we are unable to distinguish between the two possibilities.Ile-455 is well conserved among various myosins in different classes (I, II, IV, V,VI, VII, VIII, IX, X, XIII, and XV) in the superfamily (consensus sequence of DIXG), except for myosin III, in which Ile is substituted by Met. This suggests that myosin III might not function properly as a motor protein. Interestingly, Ile in this motif is not conserved in other nucleotide-binding protein families, such as the G-proteins, in which DXXG has been found to be a conserved motif. In a G-protein, this region (switch II) also changes in conformation upon GTP hydrolysis, but in a different manner from that of myosin.The mutation of another amino acid in the flexible loop, G457A, severely inhibits the mechano-enzymatic function of myosin. The substitution of Gly-457 by Ala abolished the actin-activated ATPase activity, Pi burst, and ATP-induced intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence change, and, as a result, the actin translocating activity. The results are consistent with a previous report (37Onishi H. Morales M.F. Kojima S.I. Katoh K. Fujiwara K. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 3767-3772Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), which showed that the substitution of Gly-457 by Ala abolished the Pi burst and markedly decreased the steady-state ATPase activity. The observation that G457A was photoaffinity-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP indicates that G457A binds ATP and hydrolyzes it very slowly. As expected, the ATP hydrolysis rate was markedly reduced with this mutant (Table II). These results suggest that the inhibition of the motility in G457A is a result of the inhibition of the bond splitting step. According to the three-dimensional structure of the myosin active site, the carbonyl oxygen of Gly-457 forms a short hydrogen bond with the proton of a water molecule, which in turn forms a hydrogen bond with a γ-phosphate oxygen and is likely to be the water involved in catalysis. The amide of Gly-457 forms a hydrogen bond with a second phosphate oxygen. It is therefore likely that the position of Gly-457 is critical for catalysis. The region behind Gly-457 is very tightly packed, and the addition of the methyl group in G457A would clash with the conserved residues Asn-475 and either Gly-180 or Thr-179. It is therefore understandable that a mutation in this position has severe affects on the enzymatic and motile properties of the myosin. Although the structural changes associated with each step of the ATP hydrolysis cycle of myosin are not completely understood, recent three-dimensional structural analysis of the myosin motor domain/nucleotide complex has provided important information for understanding of the molecular mechanism of myosin motor function (8Rayment I.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5404-5417Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). The myosin head contains several clefts, which divide the motor domain into distinct subdomains. The cleft that splits the 50-kDa central segment of myosin S1 extends from the nucleotide binding pocket to the actin binding interface, and it is proposed that this cleft closes after ATP hydrolysis (8Rayment I. Holden H.M. Whittacker M. Yohn C.B. Lorenzs M. Holmes K.C. Milligand R.A. Science. 1993; 261: 50-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (1858) Google Scholar, 11Rayment I. Holden H.M. Trends Biol. Sci. 1994; 19: 129-134Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). This opening and closing process is thought to be coupled with weak and strong binding states, respectively. Furthermore, it is suggested that the closure of the nucleotide binding pocket triggers a conformational change to generate a bent configuration (12Wakabayashi K. Tokunaga M. Kohno I. Sugimoto T. Hamanaka Y. Takezawa T. Wakabayashi T. Amemiya Y. Science. 1992; 258: 443-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), which is coupled with cross-bridge movement. ATP is bound in a narrow tunnel formed by two loops composed of amino acid residues, which are highly conserved in the myosin superfamily (4Mooseker M.S. Chenney R.E. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1995; 11: 633-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). There are a number of interactions between the triphosphate moiety and the amino acid residues of myosin, which are thought to be important for tight ATP binding, rapid ATP hydrolysis, and the stabilization of the myosin·ADP·Pi metastable ternary complex. Kinetic studies indicate that the release of Pioccurs before the release of ADP from myosin·ADP·Pi(13Trentham D.R. Eccleston J.F. Bagshaw C.R. Q. Rev. Biophys. 1976; 9: 217-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). The analysis of the three-dimensional crystal structure of myosin·ADP· vanadate suggests that the phosphate cannot depart from the myosin active site via the same route as ATP enters, and it was proposed that the phosphate leaves the active site through the bottom of the active site pocket (14Yount R.G. Lawson D. Rayment I. Biophys. J. 1995; 68: 44s-49sPubMed Google Scholar). The binding of actin was proposed to promote the movement of the P-loop to allow the phosphate to leave via the back door (14Yount R.G. Lawson D. Rayment I. Biophys. J. 1995; 68: 44s-49sPubMed Google Scholar) in the 50-kDa fragment. In the presence of actin, the rate of product release is increased 100-fold for smooth muscle myosin S1 (15White H.D. Belknap B. Webb M.R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11828-11836Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), and the rate of the associated hydrolysis step (AM·ATP → AM·ADP·Pi), which is rate-limiting at saturating actin is decreased 4–5-fold by actin. It has been hypothesized that the movement of myosin relative to actin is achieved by a conformational change in myosin. A critical problem is the identification of such a conformational change coupled with actin sliding. Using small angle x-ray diffraction, Wakabayashi et al. (12Wakabayashi K. Tokunaga M. Kohno I. Sugimoto T. Hamanaka Y. Takezawa T. Wakabayashi T. Amemiya Y. Science. 1992; 258: 443-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) found that the myosin head forms a bent conformation after ATP hydrolysis, whereas it forms a rather extended conformation in the absence of ATP. This view was further elucidated at an atomic level by Fisher et al. (9Fisher A.J. Smith C.A. Thoden J.B. Smith R. Sutoh K. Holden H.M. Rayment I. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8960-8972Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar) and Smith and Rayment (10Smith C.A. Rayment I. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5404-5417Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar) by analyzing the crystal structure of the three ternary complexes of myosin that are thought to be analogues of the pre- and post-hydrolytic myosin-substrate complexes. A comparison of the pre- and post-hydrolysis structures revealed that the myosin motor domain bends at Ile-455 and Gly-457 1We have used sequence numbers forDictyostelium myosin for ease in comparison with the structural studies of the active site. The corresponding gizzard smooth muscle myosin sequence numbers (in parentheses) are Asp-454 (Asp-465), Ile-455 (Ile-466), and Gly-457 (Gly-468). 1We have used sequence numbers forDictyostelium myosin for ease in comparison with the structural studies of the active site. The corresponding gizzard smooth muscle myosin sequence numbers (in parentheses) are Asp-454 (Asp-465), Ile-455 (Ile-466), and Gly-457 (Gly-468). located at the β-strand, which lies between the upper part and the lower part of the central 50-kDa domain of the myosin head. This suggests that a flexible hinge region in the myosin motor domain has a critical role in the coupling of ATP hydrolysis to mechanical work. In the present study, we have made three mutant myosins in which the residues in the flexible hinge region are altered, and we analyzed the mechano-enzymatic properties to better understand the mechanism of the coupling between ATP hydrolysis and mechanical work in myosin. DISCUSSIONThere are two conserved sequences present in many nucleotide-binding proteins, as originally found by Walker et al. (33Walker J.E. Saraste M. Runswick M.J. Gay N.J. EMBO J. 1982; 1: 945-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (4220) Google Scholar). One is the P-loop that forms the triphosphate binding site, and the other corresponds to residues 454–457 in the myosin motor domain. The corresponding region in G-protein is called switch II because this region changes conformation upon GTP hydrolysis (34Milburn M.V. Tong L. deVos A.M. Brunger A. Yamaizumi Z. Nishimura S. Kim S.H. Science. 1990; 247: 939-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (836) Google Scholar, 35Pai E.F. Krengel U. Petsko G.A. Goody R.S. Kabsch W. Wittinghofer A. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2351-2359Crossref PubMed Scopus (958) Google Scholar). A comparison of the structure of the myosin·ADP·BeFx complex with myosin or the myosin· ADP·AlF4 complex indicates that a partial closure of the narrow cleft in the central 50-kDa segment upon the hydrolysis of ATP results in the movement of the lower domain of the central 50-kDa segment (9Fisher A.J. Smith C.A. Thoden J.B. Smith R. Sutoh K. Holden H.M. Rayment I. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8960-8972Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar, 10Smith C.A. Rayment I. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5404-5417Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). This requires flexibility in the peptide backbone of residues 454–457 in the switch II sequence. Another conserved residue in switch II, Asp-454, forms a hydrogen bond to a water molecule, which is coordinated to the Mg2+ that is also coordinated by the β-γ-phosphate of ATP and may play a key role in the mechano-enzymatic activity of myosin. In the present study, three smooth muscle myosin mutants with alterations in three residues in the switch II loop that might be critical for myosin motor function are expressed in Sf9 cells, and their mechano-enzymatic properties are characterized.The substitution of Asp-454 with Ala abolishes the hydrogen bonding of the side chain of residue 454 to the Mg2+ ion coordinated with the triphosphate moiety of ATP. This mutation severely disrupted normal myosin enzymatic and motor function. The results can be summarized as follows: D454A can form a rigor complex with actin, but ATP does not dissociate D454A from actin. Although the structure of the actin binding interface is preserved, the ATP-induced conformational change required to reduce actin affinity is disrupted. This is either because the affinity of ATP is reduced or because the normal coupling between the nucleotide and actin binding sites is severely disrupted. Although K ATP for D454A is increased in the presence of actin, the ATPase activity is concentration-independent above 0.1 mm ATP. Because a high concentration of ATP (up to 10 mm) failed to dissociate D454A from actin, the latter possibility is more likely. Although D454A shows significant basal Mg2+-ATPase activity, it has neither actin-activated ATPase activity nor an initial Pi burst.Based upon the three-dimensional structure of the myosin motor domain (10Smith C.A. Rayment I. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5404-5417Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar), there is a water molecule that forms a hydrogen bond with the γ-phosphate of ATP in the active site (Fig.7). This water molecule is expected to nucleophilically attack the γ-phosphate of ATP for hydrolysis. Therefore, it is plausible that the disruption of the Asp-454-water-Mg2+ interaction results in the displacement of γ-phosphate from the proper position in the active site at which it is normally attacked by a water molecule.Consistent with these enzymological results, the substitution of Asp-454 by Ala completely abolished the actin translocating activity. Asp-454 is completely conserved among the various myosins sequenced thus far, including myosin III, the most divergent member of myosin superfamily (4Mooseker M.S. Chenney R.E. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1995; 11: 633-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). This is reasonable because the substitution of this residue would be expected to cause severe disruption of myosin motor function.In contrast, the mutation of Ile-455 to Met did not significantly alter the enzymatic activities of myosin, i.e. actin-activated ATPase activity, tryptophan fluorescence enhancement, Piburst, and ATP-induced rapid dissociation from actin. Nevertheless, the actin translocating activity was also completely abolished in I455M. Because normal Pi burst and the actin-activated ATPase activity were retained in this mutant, the myosin·ADP·Pi metastable ternary complex is produced with nearly normal kinetics, and the change in the intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence of myosin upon ATP binding was also nearly normal. Previously, it was suggested by using energy transfer results (36Hiratsuka T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14941-14948Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and by three-dimensional structural analysis (10Smith C.A. Rayment I. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5404-5417Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar) that the tryptophan residues responsible for the change in fluorescence induced by ATP binding to myosin are Trp-501 and either Trp-113 or Trp-131. Trp-501 is surrounded by the hydrophobic residues Tyr-494, Phe-503, Phe-692, and Gly-691 in the hydrophobic environment of the myosin·ADP·Vi complex. In nucleotide-free myosin, one edge of Trp-501 is exposed to solvent. Although the mechanism for tryptophan fluorescence enhancement is not completely understood, the present results suggest that the segment of random coil containing Trp-501 experienced similar environmental changes in I455M and in the wild type. According to the three-dimensional structural analysis, it was suggested that the myosin motor domain bends at Gly-457 and Ile-455 upon ATP hydrolysis (9Fisher A.J. Smith C.A. Thoden J.B. Smith R. Sutoh K. Holden H.M. Rayment I. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8960-8972Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is plausible that the substitution of Ile-455 by Met disrupts the proper change in the torsional angle at residue 455 that is necessary for actin sliding upon product release. There are two possible explanations for the apparently normal ATP hydrolysis mechanism observed for I455M and its lack of motility: 1) the actual mechanism for the loss of motility in I455M could be due to a defect in the enzymatic pathway that has not yet been identified, and 2) ATP hydrolysis and motility are uncoupled by this mutation. Thus far, we are unable to distinguish between the two possibilities.Ile-455 is well conserved among various myosins in different classes (I, II, IV, V,VI, VII, VIII, IX, X, XIII, and XV) in the superfamily (consensus sequence of DIXG), except for myosin III, in which Ile is substituted by Met. This suggests that myosin III might not function properly as a motor protein. Interestingly, Ile in this motif is not conserved in other nucleotide-binding protein families, such as the G-proteins, in which DXXG has been found to be a conserved motif. In a G-protein, this region (switch II) also changes in conformation upon GTP hydrolysis, but in a different manner from that of myosin.The mutation of another amino acid in the flexible loop, G457A, severely inhibits the mechano-enzymatic function of myosin. The substitution of Gly-457 by Ala abolished the actin-activated ATPase activity, Pi burst, and ATP-induced intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence change, and, as a result, the actin translocating activity. The results are consistent with a previous report (37Onishi H. Morales M.F. Kojima S.I. Katoh K. Fujiwara K. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 3767-3772Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), which showed that the substitution of Gly-457 by Ala abolished the Pi burst and markedly decreased the steady-state ATPase activity. The observation that G457A was photoaffinity-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP indicates that G457A binds ATP and hydrolyzes it very slowly. As expected, the ATP hydrolysis rate was markedly reduced with this mutant (Table II). These results suggest that the inhibition of the motility in G457A is a result of the inhibition of the bond splitting step. According to the three-dimensional structure of the myosin active site, the carbonyl oxygen of Gly-457 forms a short hydrogen bond with the proton of a water molecule, which in turn forms a hydrogen bond with a γ-phosphate oxygen and is likely to be the water involved in catalysis. The amide of Gly-457 forms a hydrogen bond with a second phosphate oxygen. It is therefore likely that the position of Gly-457 is critical for catalysis. The region behind Gly-457 is very tightly packed, and the addition of the methyl group in G457A would clash with the conserved residues Asn-475 and either Gly-180 or Thr-179. It is therefore understandable that a mutation in this position has severe affects on the enzymatic and motile properties of the myosin. There are two conserved sequences present in many nucleotide-binding proteins, as originally found by Walker et al. (33Walker J.E. Saraste M. Runswick M.J. Gay N.J. EMBO J. 1982; 1: 945-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (4220) Google Scholar).

The acidic region of CBF1 is thought to play the leading role in transcriptional activation. Acidic activation domains are present, for example, in the yeast transcription factors GAL4 (25Ma J.

These results led us to expect that the acidic region of CBF1 might also directly or indirectly interact with general transcription factor(s). In this study, we report the characterization of the CBF1 protein purified from Escherichia coli transformants. Our purpose was to examine whether various responses of the CBF1 protein occurred when the temperature was lowered from normal to low, nonfreezing temperatures. CD spectra of the intact and truncated CBF1 proteins measured at various temperatures suggested that cold denaturation (37Hopkins F.G. Nature. 1930; 126: 383-384Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar,38Privalov P.L. Griko Yu.V. Venyaminov S.Yu. Kutyshenko V.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 190: 487-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar) locally occurred in the CBF1 protein in aqueous solution without denaturant and that thermal denaturation occurred in the AP2 domain. This local cold denaturation is thought to be a characteristic property of the CBF1 protein. We discuss the possible role of this local cold denaturation of CBF1 in the cold acclimation response. Plasmids pET28a and pET29b, and E. coli BL21(DE3) were from Novagen, Inc. Competent cells of E. coli JM109 (recA1, endA1, gyra96, thi-1, hsdR17, supE44, relA1, Δ(lac-proAB)/F[traD36, proAB + , lacI q , lacZΔM15]) for plasmid construction were from Takara Shuzo Co., Ltd. Cells were grown in Luria-Bertani medium (39) containing 50 mg/liter kanamycin. Restriction and DNA-modifying enzymes were from Takara Shuzo Co., Ltd. The DNA ligation kit (ligation high) and KOD DNA polymerase for the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were from Toyobo Co., Ltd. Lysyl endopeptidase (LEP), isopropyl-β-d-thio-galactopyranoside (IPTG), and guanidine hydrochloride (GdnHCl) were from Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd. Thrombin was from Sigma. The proteins used as standards for gel filtration were from Bio-Rad. DNA oligomers were synthesized by Sawady Technology Co., Ltd. Other chemicals were of reagent grade. The CBF1gene was cloned from an A. thaliana cDNA library by PCR using the synthetic DNA oligomers 5′-GTACTCTGACATATGAACTCATTTTCAGC-3′, 5′-GAGGATCCAATATTAGTAACTCCAAAGCGACACG-3′, and 5′-TCGGATCCTCGAGGTAACTCCAAAGCGACACG-3′ as primers. Recognition sites of restriction endonucleases NdeI,BamHI, and XhoI are shown by the three underlined areas, respectively. The sequences downstream of the NdeI,BamHI, and XhoI sites of the primers are complementary to the 5′- and 3′-sequences of CBF1, respectively. Thirty cycles of PCR were performed using a Trio-Thermoblock (Biometra) apparatus with KOD DNA polymerase using the procedures recommended by the supplier. The DNA product was digested with NdeI and BamHI or with NdeI andXhoI and ligated to the largeNdeI-BamHI fragment of plasmid pET28a or to the large NdeI-XhoI fragment of pET29b to generate plasmid pETCBF1(a or b), in which the CBF1 gene, encoding the CBF1 protein, is under the control of bacteriophage T7 transcription and translation signals. The sequence of theCBF1 gene in pETCBF1 was confirmed by cycle sequencing using ABI PRISMTM dye terminator cycle sequencing ready reaction kits and ABI PRISMTM 310 genetic analyzer from Perkin-Elmer. Truncation of the CBF1 gene was performed via PCR with the synthetic DNA oligomers as primers and using KOD DNA polymerase, according the procedures recommended by the supplier. The nucleotide sequences of the truncated CBF1 genes were confirmed as described above. Expression of the CBF1 protein was induced in E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells harboring plasmid pETCBF1 by the addition of IPTG. Cultivation of the E. coli transformants was carried out at 30 °C. When the absorbance of the culture at 600 nm reached 0.8, 1 mm IPTG was added to the culture medium on ice, and cultivation was then continued for an additional 5 h at 25 °C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and subjected to the purification procedures described below. The production of the CBF1 protein in cells was examined by analyzing the whole-cell extract by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) (40Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207227) Google Scholar). The solubility of CBF1 in cells was examined as follows: cells were suspended in 10 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 1 mm EDTA, sonicated for 2 min on ice, and centrifuged at 15,000 rpm (27,000 × g) for 20 min. The resulting supernatants and pellets were analyzed by SDS-PAGE . All purification procedures were carried out at 4 °C. Cells from a 250-ml culture were suspended in 25 ml of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, sonicated on ice for 2 min, and centrifuged at 15,000 rpm (27,000 × g) for 30 min. EDTA (1 mm) was present in the suspension to prevent the digestion of the CBF1 protein by proteases in E. coli. The resulting supernatant was supplemented with 10 mm imidazole and then applied to a HiTrap chelating column with Ni2+ions from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. After the column was washed, the CBF1 protein was eluted with a solution containing 300 mmimidazole, 0.5 m NaCl, 20 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, and 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol. The eluant was diluted 10-fold with a buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, and 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol and applied to Q-Sepharose FF from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. The CBF1 protein was eluted by a gradient from 0 to 0.8 m NaCl in a buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mmEDTA, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 10% glycerol. The purity of the protein was analyzed by SDS-PAGE. CBF1 with a histidine tag at the N terminus was used for gel shift assay, footprinting, CD and fluorescence measurements, and gel filtration analyses. CBF1 with a histidine tag at the C terminus was used as the substrate for the digestion with LEP to generate LEP peptides. The N-terminal sequence of CBF1 was confirmed by ProciseTM protein sequencing system from Applied Biosystems. A 21-base pair duplex that was chemically synthesized and contained the sequence of CRT/DRE was mixed with the CBF1 protein in 25 μl of a binding buffer containing 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 30 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm EDTA, and 10% glycerol, and the mixture was incubated for 20 min at room temperature and then electrophoresed on a nondenaturing 5% polyacrylamide gel at 100 V for 3 h. The bands containing DNA were visualized by ethidium bromide staining and UV illumination. DNase I footprinting was performed using a 74-base pair synthetic double-stranded DNA fragment that contained CRT/DRE and that had been labeled with 32P by end-filling with T7 sequenase from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. The binding reaction was performed as described above in the presence of 1 μg of poly(dI-dC)·poly(dI-dC) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). DNase I digestion and gel analysis were carried out as described (41Leblanc B. Moss T. DNA-Protein Interactions: Methods in Molecular Biology 2. 30. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ1994: 1-10Google Scholar). The G/A sequencing ladder was generated by performing Maxam-Gilbert chemical reaction (42Maxam A.M. Gilbert W. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 65: 499-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (9013) Google Scholar) using the same 74-base pair DNA fragment. CD spectra (200–300 nm) were measured on a J-720 automatic spectropolarimeter (Japan Spectroscopic Co., Ltd.). Spectra were obtained using solutions containing the proteins or the peptides at 0.3 mg/ml in 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer at pH 7.9 containing 0.5 mm dithiothreitol and 10% glycerol or 20 mm sodium acetate buffer at pH 5.5. The mean residue ellipticity [θ], expressed in units of deg·cm2·dmol−1, was calculated by using an average amino acid molecular weight of 110. S-Carboxymethylation of CBF1 was carried out as follows: iodoacetic acid (10 mg) was added to a solution (4 ml) of CBF1 (1.3 mg) in 200 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, saturated with N2. The tube containing the reaction mixture was sealed and shaken at room temperature for 1 h in the dark. The resultant solution was dialyzed against a buffer containing 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 9.0, and 10 mm NaCl at 4 °C overnight. Carboxymethylated CBF1 (1.3 mg) was digested with LEP (25 μg) at 37 °C for 30 min to generate five peptides, which corresponded to the amino acid residues 1–32, 40–58, 59–68, 70–119, and 120–213, shown in Fig. 1 b. These peptides were separated by reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography using a TSK gel ODS-120T column, 4.6 × 250 mm (Tosho, Tokyo, Japan) with a 60-min linear gradient from 5 to 75% acetonitrile, containing 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid at the flow rate of 1 ml/min. Identification of the peptide in each peak was performed by comparison between the measured and theoretical mass values summarized in TableI and by N-terminal amino acid sequencing by stepwise Edman degradation. The CBF1 protein has five cysteine residues. The measured mass values of 3585.62 for LEP1 and 5609.96 for LEP4 (Table I) were larger than the theoretical mass values by 116.87 and 104.66, respectively, which corresponds to the mass value of two carboxymethyl groups. These results are consistent with the fact that four cysteine residues, at positions 23, 30, 100, and 117, were carboxymethylated. The mass spectrum of LEP5 could not be determined. However, a peak from a carboxymethylated cysteine residue was detected at step 14 of the Edman degradation of LEP5, indicating that the cysteine residue at position 137 was also carboxymethylated. Based on these results, we concluded that the five cysteine residues in CBF1 were in the reduced form and were carboxymethylated with iodoacetic acid.Table IMeasured and theoretical mass values for the identification of the LEP peptidesLEP peptideMeasured massTheoretical massaTheoretical mass was calculated based on the amino acid sequence of the CBF1 protein reported by Stockinger et al.

Open table in a new tab The LEP digestion of CBF1 was performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The resultant LEP peptides were subjected to mass spectrometry using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry from PerSeptive Biosystems. Each peptide was identified by N-terminal amino acid sequencing. The gel filtration of the intact or truncated CBF1 protein was performed using Superdex 75 PC 3.2/30 in a SMART system from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech with a buffer containing 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.9, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 100 mm NaCl as the eluent with a flow rate of 30 μl/min at 4 or 25 °C. The protein concentration of CBF1 with a tag was determined from the UV absorption at 280 nm. The A 2800.1% value of 1.43 for CBF1(1–213) with a molecular weight of 25,994 was calculated by using 1,576 m−1·cm−1 for tyrosine (×7) and 5,225 m−1·cm−1 for tryptophan (×5) at 280 nm (43Goodwin T.W. Morton R.A. Biochem. J. 1946; 40: 628-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (1098) Google Scholar). A 2800.1%values of 1.57, 1.42, and 1.44 for CBF1(41–213), CBF1(41–157), and CBF1(41–146), respectively, were also calculated as described for CBF1(1–213). The concentrations of peptides were determined using the following formula: Concentration (μg/ml) = (A 224 − A 233.3) × 210 (44Groves W.E. Davis F.C. Sells B.H. Anal. Biochem. 1968; 22: 195-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). The secondary structure of CBF1 was predicted using a neural network system that was offered as a service on the World Wide Web, the Predict Protein Server (http://www.emble-heidelberg.de/predictprotein/predictprotein.html). The program was provided by Rost and Sander (45Rost B. Sander C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 584-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (2647) Google Scholar). Analytical ultracentrifugation experiments were carried out in an Optima XL-I analytical ultracentrifuge (Beckman Instruments Inc.). In velocity sedimentation experiments, CBF1 (0.12 mg/ml) in a buffer containing 100 mm NaCl, 20 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.8, and 1 mm dithiothreitol was centrifuged at 50,000 rpm and 25 or 3 °C, and radial scans at 230 nm were taken at 5-min intervals for 4 h. The sedimentation coefficient,s T,b, and the diffusion coefficient,DT,b, were calculated by the second moment method with the Optima XL-A data analysis software supplied by Beckman. The values from the data at 25 and 3 °C were corrected to the standard conditions (water, 20 °C) to obtain thes 20,w values (46van Holde K.E. Physical Biochemistry. 2nd Ed.

The cultivation of the transformants was performed at 25 or 37 °C to examine the dependence of the solubility of CBF1 in cells on the temperature. The production level of CBF1 was estimated to be ∼4 mg/liter of culture at 25 °C and ∼8 mg/liter of culture at 37 °C, from the intensities of Coomassie Brilliant Blue-stained bands in SDS-polyacrylamide gels. The corresponding bands in SDS-polyacrylamide gels of the supernatants and pellets obtained after centrifugation of the suspension of sonicated cells showed that about 80% of the protein was soluble when the cultivation was carried out at 25 °C, whereas about 90% of the protein was insoluble at 37 °C (data not shown). Based on these results, the cultivation of E. coli transformants was carried out at 25 °C after the addition of IPTG in order to obtain the CBF1 protein in soluble form. The CBF1 protein was efficiently and selectively trapped by the chelating column when a histidine tag was attached to the N or C terminus of CBF1. Elution with 300 mm imidazole solution yielded 3.3 mg of protein product containing CBF1 with 80% purity from 1 liter of culture. Subsequent ion exchange chromatography using Q-Sepharose FF yielded homogeneous CBF1, which appeared as a single band in SDS-PAGE analysis (data not shown).

https://openalex.org/W2007670707,"The scaffolding proteins of double-stranded DNA viruses are required for the polymerization of capsid subunits into properly sized closed shells but are absent from the mature virions. Phage P22 scaffolding subunits are elongated 33-kDa molecules that copolymerize with coat subunits into icosahedral precursor shells and subsequently exit from the precursor shell through channels in the procapsid lattice to participate in further rounds of polymerization and dissociation. Purified scaffolding subunits could be refoldedin vitro after denaturation by high temperature or guanidine hydrochloride solutions. The lack of coincidence of fluorescence and circular dichroism signals indicated the presence of at least one partially folded intermediate, suggesting that the protein consisted of multiple domains. Proteolytic fragments containing the C terminus were competent for copolymerization with capsid subunits into procapsid shells in vitro, whereas the N terminus was not needed for this function. Proteolysis of partially denatured scaffolding subunits indicated that it was the capsid-binding C-terminal domain that unfolded at low temperatures and guanidinium concentrations. The minimal stability of the coat-binding domain may reflect its role in the conformational switching needed for icosahedral shell assembly."
https://openalex.org/W2019757108,"Previous studies have shown that α2A-adrenergic receptor (α2A-AR) retention at the basolateral surface of polarized MDCKII cells involves its third intracellular (3i loop). The present studies examining mutant α2A-ARs possessing short deletions of the 3i loop indicate that no single region can completely account for the accelerated surface turnover of the Δ3iα2A-AR, suggesting that the entire 3i loop is involved in basolateral retention. Both wild-type and Δ3i loop α2A-ARs are extracted from polarized Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells with 0.2% Triton X-100 and with a similar concentration/response profile, suggesting that Triton X-100-resistant interactions of the α2A-AR with cytoskeletal proteins are not involved in receptor retention on the basolateral surface. The indistinguishable basolateral t12 for either the wild-type or nonsense 3i loop α2A-AR suggests that the stabilizing properties of the α2A-AR 3i loop are not uniquely dependent on a specific sequence of amino acids. The accelerated turnover of Δ3i α2A-AR cannot be attributed to alteration in agonist-elicited α2A-AR redistribution, because α2A-ARs are not down-regulated in response to agonist. Taken together, the present studies show that stabilization of the α2A-AR on the basolateral surface of MDCKII cells involves multiple mechanisms, with the third intracellular loop playing a central role in regulating these processes.

Stabilization of the α2A-AR on the basolateral surface does not appear to involve interaction with cytoskeletal proteins, because concentrations of Triton X-100 that do not destabilize direct membrane protein interaction with the cytoskeleton nonetheless extract the wild-type α2A-AR and Δ 3i loop α2A-AR with a similar concentration-response. Deletion of the 3i loop does not accelerate agonist-elicited redistribution and down-regulation of the α2A-AR, suggesting that the 3i loop likely does not prevent α2A-AR interactions with proteins involved in receptor internalization. A mutant α2A-AR containing a 3i loop of similar length but disparate sequence from wild-type α2A-AR (nonsense loop) has a surface half-life in polarized MDCKII cells indistinguishable from wild-type receptors, indicating that the specific amino acid sequences are not necessarily required for basolateral retention and suggesting that the bulk of the 3i loop may be sufficient to stabilize the α2A-AR on the basolateral surface.

The top domain is composed of a 90-amino acid β-barrel structure that forms a crown on top of F1. This crown is 50 Å from the nucleotide-binding site and does not appear to be critical in the formation of the active site. The role of the β-barrel domains is not certain, but they were postulated to be important for stabilizing F1-ATPase (6Böttcher B. Schwarz L. Gräber P. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 281: 757-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). This hypothesis is tested here by making chimeric enzymes that replace the β-barrel domains from yeastSaccharomyces cerevisiae ATPase with those from the thermophilic bacterium Bacillus PS3 enzyme. It was predicted that if the β-barrel structures were critical in stabilizing the enzyme, then the chimeric enzyme would be more thermostable than the wild-type yeast enzyme. No support for this hypothesis was obtained, but instead the results indicate that the crown made by the β-barrel domains forms critical interactions necessary for the assembly of the ATP synthase. These interactions appear to map on the face of the β-barrel crown at the noncatalytic interface between the α- and β-subunits. A list of the parent strains used in this study is shown in Table I. The yeast S. cerevisiaestrain BY101 was made by making a null mutation in the ATP1gene in the host strain W303-1A. The strain BY6A is a meiotic progeny of the diploid formed from mating BY101 with DMY301.Table IStrains and oligonucleotides used in this studyStrainGenotypeSourceBY6AMATa, ade2–1, his3, leu2, ura3–52, trp1, can1R-100, atp1∷HIS3, atp2∷LEU2This studyBY101MATα, ade2–1, his3–11,15, trp1, leu2–3,112 ura3–52, can1R-100, atp1∷HIS3This studyDMY111MATα, ade5, leu2–3,112, trp1–289, ura3–52, gal7-Δ102, atp2∷LEU2Ref.18Mueller D.M.

The nucleotides in uppercase letters indicate those that serve to target the recombination event for the YSC oligonucleotides and those that provide a KpnI restriction site for the Kan primers. The yeast media are standard recipes as described (20Sherman F. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 3-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (2545) Google Scholar): YPD, 1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, and 2% glucose; YPG, 1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, and 3% glycerol; and YPAD, 1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 20 mg/liter adenine sulfate, and 2% glucose. Synthetic minimal medium contained 2% glucose (SD) and was supplemented with adenine, histidine, arginine, methionine, tyrosine, lysine, leucine, isoleucine, and tryptophan or uracil at 20 mg/liter. The genes encoding the α-subunit (ATP1)and β-subunit (ATP2) of the ATPase were disrupted following a single-step procedure using linear plasmid DNA (21Rothstein R.J. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 101: 202-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (2033) Google Scholar). The plasmid for the null mutation in ATP2 was described earlier (18Mueller D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 5634-5639Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The knockout plasmid for the ATP1gene was made by digesting ATP1 with BglII and replacing the 210-base pair fragment with the 1767-base pairBamHI fragment containing the HIS3 gene. The resulting ATP1/HIS3 construct was released from the plasmid after digestion with BamHI and EcoRI and then used to transform (22Gietz R.D. Schiestl R.H. Methods Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 5: 255-269Google Scholar) yeast W303-1B. The chimeric subunits containing the β-barrel domain from PS3 and the remaining portion from S. cerevisiae were made by taking advantage of the ability of yeast to perform gap repair (23Ma H. Kunes S. Schatz P.J. Botstein D. Gene (Amst.). 1987; 58: 201-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). A schematic diagram for the production of the chimeric genes for the genes encoding the α-subunit (ATP1) and β-subunit (ATP2) is shown in Fig. 1. The method requires that the gene of interest (the α- and β-subunits) is cloned into a yeast centromere vector, in this case, pRS316 and pRS314 (19Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), respectively. The method also requires the presence of a unique restriction enzyme site in the region that is to be exchanged. There was not a unique restriction site available in the DNA encoding the β-barrel domains of the α- or β-subunits. Thus, a unique restriction site was added to the appropriate region by inserting the gene encoding either the chloramphenicol (Cm) or kanamycin (Kan) resistance into the region of the portion of the gene encoding the β-barrel domain of the α- and β-subunits, resulting in plasmids pY16ATP1/Cm and pRS344ATP2SB/Kan, respectively. The Cm and Kan genes were obtained by PCR using the primers shown in Table I. The Kan primers contained a KpnI site at their 5′-end to simplify the ligation of the gene into theKpnI site of ATP2. The Cm gene was blunt end-ligated into the BseRI site of ATP1 after theBseRI site was made blunt with the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase. The ligation mixture was transformed into Escherichia coli XL1-Blue, and the transformants were selected on LB medium containing either Cm or Kan. Selected clones were checked by restriction digestion to ensure the proper construct as well as to determine the orientation of the Cm or Kan resistance gene. These constructs provided unique NcoI and NruI sites in the plasmids that were used to make the chimeric constructs. The DNA encoding the PS3 β-barrel domain sequence and the junction point of the PS3/yeast sequence was amplified by PCR. PCR was performed with forward and reverse primers that contained ∼30 bases at the 5′-end that corresponded to the desired site of recombination. The last 15 bases served to prime the PS3 sequence and corresponded to the border encoding the β-barrel domain from PS3 (TableI). PCRs were performed using plasmids containing the genes for the α- and β-subunits of the ATPase from PS3, pUC118α, and pUC118β (kindly provided by Dr. Masasuke Yoshida). The PCR products consisted of the β-barrel region of either the α- or β-subunit of PS3 flanked by 30 base pairs of DNA, which correspond to the desired sites of recombination in either the yeastATP1 (encodes the α-subunit) or ATP2 (encodes the β-subunit) gene. The PCR products were used to transform yeast strain BY101 (atp1−) or DMY111 (atp2−) with the NcoI- or NruI-cut plasmid DNA, respectively. (Note that this method does not require that the yeast strain contain a null mutation in the target gene. Use of these strains, however, allowed us to directly test the ability of the chimeric constructs to complement the respective null mutation.) Upon transformation in yeast, homologous recombination occurs between the PCR product and the corresponding linear plasmid, thereby replacing the DNA encoding the yeast β-barrel domain with the PS3 DNA and circularizing the plasmid DNA. Since only the circular plasmid DNA is replicated in yeast, nearly all the resulting transformants result from the correct integration event. The transformed yeast cells were selected on minimal medium lacking the appropriate auxotrophic requirement. Colonies were taken and grown in liquid minimal medium; the plasmid DNA was isolated from the yeast; and the DNA was transformed into E. coliXL1-Blue. The plasmid DNA was isolated from the E. coli, and the DNA was sequenced by cycle sequencing (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using 33P-dideoxynucleotides and dITP in place of dGTP. The entire region that was amplified by PCR and the DNA that encodes the upstream and downstream borders of the ligation sites were sequenced to ensure that accurate homologous recombination had occurred and to ensure the absence of other mutations generated by PCR. The function of the chimeric subunits was tested by determining the growth phenotypes of cells containing each of the chimeric constructs. The plasmids containing the chimeric constructs were introduced into the yeast strains BY101 (atp1−), DMY111 (atp2−), and BY6A (atp1−,atp2−); selected on minimal glucose medium; and tested on YPG medium at 18, 30, and 37 °C. Growth on medium containing glycerol as the sole carbon source indicates a functional ATP synthase. To obtain strains able to grow on YPG medium, the colonies obtained after transformation of DMY111 with the PCR product and the single-cut pRS344ATP2SB/Kan were replica-plated onto YPG medium and incubated at 30 °C. Colonies that grew were selected and retested on YPG medium to confirm the phenotype. Plasmid DNA was isolated from the yeast, transformed into E. coli XL1-Blue, and sequenced as described above. The plasmid was also retransformed into DMY111 and tested for its ability to rescue the YPG− phenotype of DMY111. For the isolation of strains 14.1–14.20, BY6A [cATP1][cATP2-4] (the brackets indicate nonchromosomal plasmids) was grown on SD-Trp-Ura medium (3 ml); the cells were washed once with sterile water; and ∼107 cells were plated onto YPG medium and incubated at 30 °C. The plasmids were isolated from each of the 20 strains, amplified in E. coli, and retransformed into BY6A. The plasmids did not provide BY6A the ability to grow on YPG medium, indicating that the YPG+ phenotype was not due to a mutation on either cATP1 orcATP2-4. N-terminal sequence analysis of the purified α- and β-subunits of the ATPase was performed as described (24Uh M. Jones D. Mueller D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19047-19052Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mitochondria were isolated from yeast after growth on minimal medium containing the auxotrophic requirements (25Mueller D.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 164: 381-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). The extraction of the mitochondria with chloroform, Western blot analysis, and ATPase measurements were done as described (25Mueller D.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 164: 381-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined by the BCA method (26Stoscheck C.M. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 182: 50-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (1253) Google Scholar) for samples that contained membrane proteins and by a modified Bradford method for soluble proteins (26Stoscheck C.M. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 182: 50-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (1253) Google Scholar). All biochemical experiments were repeated at least twice starting from the growth of the cells, and all assays were done in at least duplicates for each preparation. The goal of this study was to determine the role of the β-barrel domain in the structure and function of F1-ATPase. The initial hypothesis was that the β-barrel domains are important for stabilizing F1-ATPase (15Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2764) Google Scholar). To test this hypothesis, chimeric subunits were made in which the β-barrel domains from the α- and β-subunits of PS3 replaced the β-barrel domains of the corresponding subunits from yeast. The primary sequence comparison of the β-barrel domains of the α- and β-subunits from yeast and PS3 is shown in Fig.2 A. The yeast and PS3 α- and β-subunits are 45 and 57% identical in this region as compared with an overall identity of 59 and 71%, respectively. Thus, this region is less well conserved than the other portions of the molecule. The primary sequences of the α- and β-subunits of the chimeric constructs are shown in Fig. 2 B. The genes encoding the chimeric PS3/yeast α- and β-subunits will henceforth be referred to as cATP1 and cATP2, respectively, whereas the wild-type yeast genes will be indicated as ATP1 andATP2, respectively. The numbering system used in Fig.2 B assigns position 1 to the first residue of the mature protein. For yeast S. cerevisiae, the first residue shown here is different from those reported earlier (27Takeda M. Chen W.J. Saltzgaber J. Douglas M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 15126-15133Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Vassarotti A. Chen W.J. Smagula C. Douglas M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 411-418Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, these sites were determined here by direct N-terminal amino acids analysis of the purified peptides, whereas the prior published determinations were obtained either by homology (27Takeda M. Chen W.J. Saltzgaber J. Douglas M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 15126-15133Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or by an indirect method (28Vassarotti A. Chen W.J. Smagula C. Douglas M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 411-418Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The amino acids in lowercase letters correspond to the sequence derived from PS3, whereas the remaining sequence is that from yeast. For the α-subunit (Atp1p), the resulting chimera (cAtp1p) had the same number of residues as the yeast α-subunit. However, the sequence QHKARNE (cf. Fig. 2 A) is unique to the β-subunit of PS3 and thus to cAtp2p. These 7 residues (residues 39–45) make the chimera 7 amino acids longer (485 residues) than the wild-type (478 residues) yeast β-subunit (Atp2p). This difference results in the slower migration of cAtp2p as compared with yeast Atp2p on SDS-polyacrylamide gel (cf. Fig. 5). The chimeric constructs were tested individually and together to see if they were able to complement the corresponding null mutations. The tests were performed in strains DMY111 (atp2−) and BY6A (atp1−,atp2−). These strains had null mutations in the gene encoding the β-subunit (ATP2) or the α-subunit (ATP1) and β-subunit of the ATPase and thus are unable to grow on medium containing glycerol as the sole carbon source (e.g. YPG). In addition, the ATP1 andATP2 genes (both the wild type and PS3/yeast chimeras) were carried on yeast vectors that also contained the URA3 andTRP1 genes, respectively, which allowed selection of cells containing the plasmids. The functional complementation of cATP1 andcATP2, as assessed by the cells' ability to grow on YPG medium, is shown in Fig. 3. The wild-type yeast ATP1 and ATP2 genes complement the respective mutations as seen in positions 1 and 5. However,cATP2 did not complement the mutations either alone (position 3) or together with cATP1 (position 7). Thus, despite forming a clear distinct domain structure separate from the rest of the α- or β-subunits, the β-barrel domains must have some species-specific structural requirements beyond just the interactions between themselves. A further understanding of the secondary requirements for function was obtained by isolating gain-of-function mutations in cATP2. Cells were isolated that were able to grow on YPG medium from DMY111 (atp2−) containing the chimeric β-subunit gene. One example of these cells is shown in Fig. 3 (position 4,cATP2-4). The plasmids in these cells were isolated and amplified in E. coli, and the sequence ofcATP2 was determined. In all but one case (cATP2-4), a single missense mutation in a codon in the β-barrel domain of the β-subunit was identified as summarized in Fig. 2 A. The clone (cATP2-4) had a deletion of the codon for G4 in addition to the missense mutation, T2K. Note that all of the mutations identified changed residues that are conserved between PS3 and yeast, rather than mutating nonconserved residues. Thus, single-base mutations in the β-barrel domain were able to provide a functional ATP synthase containing the chimeric PS3/yeast β-subunit. The β-barrel domain structures of the PS3 α- and β-subunits are nearly identical to those of the bovine subunits (15Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2764) Google Scholar, 17Shirakihara Y. Leslie A.G. Abrahams J.P. Walker J.E. Ueda T. Sekimoto Y. Kambara M. Saika K. Kagawa Y. Yoshida M. Structure. 1997; 5: 825-836Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). The main difference is the presence of the 7 additional residues in the PS3 β-subunit, which extends the second β-sheet, forming a finger-like projection from the domain. Otherwise, the overall conformation and the relative positions of the individual residues are comparable between the bovine and PS3 proteins. Inspection of the crystal structure of PS3 F1-ATPase indicates that all of the gain-of-function mutations face the interface of the α- and β-subunits that forms the noncatalytic nucleotide-binding site (Fig.4). None of the gain-of-function mutations lie at the interface between the α- and β-subunits, where residues from the α- and β-subunits make contact. Instead, the residues (especially βT2, βP24, and βE49) appear to map out a region on the surface of the β-barrel domain located on the front face on the surface of the interface that forms the noncatalytic nucleotide-binding site. The identification of the gain-of-function mutation in cATP2led to the question of whether this mutation would be sufficient to allow the functional expression of the chimeric enzyme when paired withcATP1. To test this, the cATP2 genes containing the gain-of-function mutations (Fig. 2 A) were cotransformed with cATP1 into a yeast strain (BY6A) devoid of the yeastATP1 and ATP2 genes. These cells remained unable to grow on YPG medium, which indicates that these single missense mutations were not sufficient to allow the functional expression of both cATP1 and cATP2, as is seen in Fig. 3(position 8). In this example, the gain-of-function β-subunit chimera (cATP2-4) was coexpressed with cATP1in BY6A, and together, they were unable to allow growth on glycerol medium. Thus, either cAtp1p must lack species-specific requirements present in Atp1p, or the gain-of-function mutations in cATP2must not be compatible with cAtp1p. However, gain-of-function mutations were obtained in BY6A (atp1−,atp2−) containing cATP1 andcATP2-4. The growth phenotype of one such strain, 14.1, is shown in Fig. 3 (position 9). For >20 separate isolates (14.1–14.20), the gain-of-function mutation did not lie in eithercATP1 or cATP2-4. This was determined by isolating the plasmids containing cATP1 andcATP2-4, followed by retransformation of BY6A with the plasmids. In all cases, the cells were unable to grow on YPG medium, indicating that the gain-of-function mutation did not lie in either cATP1 or cATP2-4. Furthermore, retransformation of the gain-of-function strain, e.g. 14.1, which had been cured of the plasmids with cATP1 andcATP2-4, with cATP1 andcATP2-4 resulted in strains that were able to grow on YPG medium. Thus, the gain-of-function mutation(s) allowing the functional expression of cATP1 withcATP2-4 were not in either cATP1 orcATP2-4, but must be in either the chromosomal or mtDNA. For reasons that will be more evident under “Discussion,” the initial hypothesis was that the gain-of-function mutations, which allowed the functional expression of cATP1 andcATP2-4, were in the gene encoding OSCP (ATP5 gene). To test this, ATP5 was amplified by PCR from five different strains that contained cATP1 andcATP2-4 and that were able to grow on YPG medium, and the DNA was directly sequenced. No mutations were identified in the coding region of ATP5, which indicates that the gain-of-function mutations must lie in another gene. Thus, at this point, the identity of the second gain-of-function mutations is unknown. The ability of the cells to grow on YPG medium does not provide quantitative information on the effectiveness of the ATP synthase to make ATP. This is because only 15% of the wild-type activity of the ATP synthase is necessary for the cell growth on YPG medium (29Mukhopadhyay A. Uh M. Mueller D.M. FEBS Lett. 1994; 343: 160-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Therefore, the functional complementation of the chimeric genes was tested by measuring the oligomycin-sensitive ATPase from isolated mitochondria. The results of this study are shown in TableII. In general, the amount of oligomycin-sensitive ATPase in the mitochondria correlated well with the ability of the cells to grow on YPG medium. The gain-of-function mutations allowed the expression of the oligomycin-sensitive ATPase at nearly the same level as the wild-type enzyme. In a second set of experiments, F1-ATPase was released from the membrane by chloroform, and the efrapeptin-sensitive ATPase activity was measured. The level of the ATPase activity in the chloroform extract correlated well with that in the mitochondria.Table IISpecific ATPase activity of isolated mitochondria and the chloroform-extracted preparationMitochondriaChloroform extractSpecific activity+oligomycinSpecific activity+EfrapeptinDMY111 [pRS314]0.110.110.060.05DMY111 [cATP2]0.070.050.030.02DMY111 [cATP2–4]0.430.181.360.13DMY111 [ATP2]0.920.163.50.13BY6A [ATP1][pRS314]0.070.050.020.02BY6A [ATP1][ATP2]0.430.054.70.11BY6A [cATP1][cATP2]0.10.030.10.1BY6A [cATP1][cATP2–4]0.10.030.160.0714.11.00.083.90.9The cell plasmids are indicated as nonchromosomal by the brackets.

Open table in a new tab The cell plasmids are indicated as nonchromosomal by the brackets. The plasmids pRS314 and pRS316 are the parent vectors for ATP2and cATP2 and for ATP1 and cATP1, respectively. The inactivity of the chimeric enzymes may be due to either the lack of assembly or an assembled but inactive enzyme. To test between these two possibilities, Western blot analysis using antibodies against yeast F1 was performed on the mitochondrial and chloroform-extracted preparations, as tested in Table II (Fig.5). Chloroform has been used to selectively release assembled F1 from the membrane (30Cheng M.Y. Hartl F.U. Martin J. Pollock R.A. Kalousek F. Neupert W. Hallberg E.M. Hallberg R.L. Horwich A.L. Nature. 1989; 337: 620-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar) and thus can be used as a test for assembly of F1-ATPase. This is illustrated in lane 1, where the α-subunit is present in the mitochondria isolated from cells with a null mutation inATP2, but not in the chloroform extract of the mitochondrial membranes from the same cells. The analysis shows that cAtp2p in the presence of the wild-type α-subunit resulted in the degradation of wild-type Atp1p and cAtp2p (lane 2). This is unusual since the α- and β-subunits are normally stable when expressed in yeast strains with the null mutations ATP1 a"

A purification method was designed for obtaining in large amounts apocytochrome c that was shown by amino acid analysis and mass spectroscopy to be chemically intact. The apoprotein and its noncovalent complex were characterized by absorption, fluorescence, circular dichroism, and sedimentation velocity, confirming previous reports. Sedimentation-diffusion equilibrium showed that the apoprotein and its noncovalent complex with heme were monomeric. Surprisingly, whereas apocytochrome c was quite soluble, the noncovalent complex slowly formed heavy aggregates, thus precluding experiments at the concentrations needed for structural studies. Two monoclonal antibodies that bind strongly to distinct antigenic sites on native holocytochrome were used to probe the noncovalent complex conformation. For both antibodies, the affinity for the noncovalent complex was only about 5–10-fold smaller than that for native holocytochrome c, and about 50–100-fold larger than that for apocytochrome c. These results indicate that the noncovalent complex, although not entirely native, carries some pseudo-native structural motifs.

Investigations on the mechanisms of protein folding have for many years emphasized the role of short range interactions in the formation of secondary structure elements, i.e. α-helices and β-turns/β-sheets, at early stages of the folding process (1Ptitsyn O.B. Dokl. Akad. Nauk SSSR. 1973; 210: 1213-1215PubMed Google Scholar, 2Kim P.S. Baldwin R.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1982; 51: 459-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (952) Google Scholar, 3Baldwin R.L. Roder H. Curr.

Although the necessity of a coupling between secondary structure and some long range interactions, such as specific disulfide bonds, was pointed out long ago (5Creighton T.E. Biophys. Chem. 1988; 31: 155-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), the possibility that specific long range interactions may drive the folding from the very beginning of the folding process was not taken seriously until the application to proteins of the notion of “energy landscape” (6Wolynes P.G.

Yet experimental evidence was already available that indicated the need for such long range interactions in promoting or stabilizing secondary structure elements at early stages of the folding of some proteins. Thus, the native secondary structure of hen lysozyme was shown to be recovered in less than 4 ms of folding when the native disulfide bonds were kept intact in the denatured state (7Chaffotte A.F. Guillou Y. Goldberg M.E. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 9694-9702Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), whereas no detectable secondary structure was present after 4 ms of folding when the denatured protein was reduced (8Goldberg M.E. Guillou Y. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 883-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Recent studies even showed that the regain of secondary structure during the renaturation/oxidation of reduced lysozyme is very slow and likely to depend strictly on the formation of at least some native disulfide bonds (9Roux P. Delepierre M. Goldberg M.E. Chaffotte A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24843-24849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Similarly, horse cytochrome c folds efficiently only when it carries its cofactor. Indeed, the apoprotein behaves essentially as an unfolded polypeptide chain (10Stellwagen E. Rysavy R. Babul G. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 8074-8077Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Fisher W.R. Taniuchi H. Anfinsen C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 3188-3195Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), indicating that the interactions between the polypeptide chain and the heme moiety are needed to achieve a folded state. This was confirmed by the observation that long range interactions between the heme and specific side chains of apocytochromec are formed during the initial phases of the folding of holocytochrome c (12Elöve G.A. Bhuyan A.K. Roder H. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6925-6935Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar), suggesting that these interactions contribute to either initiating the folding process or stabilizing very early intermediates, rather than only to the stabilization of the folded state. Moreover, the noncovalent binding of heme to apocytochrome c promotes a structured conformation of the polypeptide chain (13Dumont M.E. Corin A.F. Campbell G.A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7368-7378Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). However, although clearly shown to be definitely folded and compact, this conformation certainly differs from that of native cytochrome c. In particular, the far UV CD and the visible absorption spectra of the noncovalent complex differ from those of the native protein (13Dumont M.E. Corin A.F. Campbell G.A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7368-7378Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In order to gain some insight to the respective contributions of covalent and noncovalent heme/protein interactions in structuring the polypeptide chain, it seemed to us of interest to find out whether or not the noncovalent complex shares some conformational features with native holocytochrome c. We therefore undertook investigations on the conformation of the noncovalent complex between heme and apocytochrome c. In the present paper, we describe an easy, large scale purification procedure of apocytochrome c and the characterization by circular dichroism spectroscopy and analytical ultracentrifugation of the resulting apoprotein and of its noncovalent complex with heme. We also report structural investigations of the noncovalent complex, involving measurements by ELISA 1The abbreviations used are: mAb, monoclonal antibody; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; DTT, dithiothreitol; ITC, isothermal titration calorimetry. 1The abbreviations used are: mAb, monoclonal antibody; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; DTT, dithiothreitol; ITC, isothermal titration calorimetry. and isothermal titration microcalorimetry of the affinities of two “conformation-specific” monoclonal antibodies for holocytochromec, apocytochrome c, and the noncovalent heme-apocytochrome c complex. Heme was obtained as ferriporphyrin hydroxide (hematin) from Aldrich. Heme stock solutions were prepared in 0.1 m sodium hydroxide, and their concentration was determined spectrophotometrically (ε385 = 5.84 × 104m−1 cm−1) All chemicals used were reagent grade. Unless otherwise stated, the buffer was 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, containing 5 mm DTT. Horse heart holocytochrome c was purchased from Sigma and used without further purification. Apocytochrome c was obtained as described previously (10Stellwagen E. Rysavy R. Babul G. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 8074-8077Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 100 mg of holocytochrome c were dissolved in 2 ml of distilled water and supplemented first with 160 mg of silver sulfate dissolved in 18 ml of water and second with 1.6 ml of pure acetic acid. The mixture was incubated at 40 °C for 4 h and centrifuged. The purification of the apocytochrome c thus obtained was achieved as follows. The supernatant (21 ml) was dialyzed overnight at 4 °C against 2 liters of 0.1 n acetic acid and then for 24 h against 2 liters of 50 mm ammonium acetate adjusted at pH 5; the dialysis buffer was changed after the first 12 h. The dialysate was centrifuged at 8000 rpm for 30 min. in a Sorvall SS 34 rotor. The resulting supernatant (25 ml) was slowly supplemented under gentle mixing with 0.25 ml of a saturated solution of ammonium sulfate. The mixture was incubated at room temperature without agitation for 1 h and centrifuged as above. The supernatant was discarded, and the pellet was redissolved with 20 ml of 6 m guanidinium chloride in 50 mm ammonium acetate, pH 5, and 0.5 m DTT. The solution was dialyzed at 4 °C against 2 liters of ammonium acetate, pH 5, 5 mmDTT for 3 h, the buffer was changed and the dialysis carried on overnight. The dialysate was centrifuged as above to remove a fine, yellowish precipitate. The supernatant (29 ml) was separated in 1.5-ml aliquots, lyophilyzed, and stored at −20 °C in a dessicator with silica gel. The α subunit of Escherichia coli tryptophan synthase was prepared as described previously (14Djavadi-Ohaniance L. Friguet B. Goldberg M.E. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 2502-2508Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Monoclonal antibodies 5F8 and 2B5 were obtained, starting from hybridoma cell lines kindly provided by Dr. Barry Nall (Department of Biochemistry, University of Texas Health Center, San Antonio, TX). Hybridoma cells were cultured, injected intraperitoneally into pristane-primed BALB/C mice, and antibodies were purified from the resulting ascitic fluids by ammonium sulfate precipitation of the immunoglobulins followed by ion exchange chromatography on DEAE, following previously described protocols (15Friguet B. Djavadi-Ohaniance L. Goldberg M.E. Creighton T. Protein Structure: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1989: 287-310Google Scholar). The characterization of these antibodies has been reported previously (16Goshorn S.C. Retzel E. Jemmerson R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2134-2142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The preparation and characterization of antibody mAb164 was described previously (17Friguet B. Djavadi-Ohaniance L. Goldberg M.E. Res. Immunol. 1989; 140: 355-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically, using as extinction coefficients ε280 = 0.92 ml/mg·cm for apocytochrome c (10Stellwagen E. Rysavy R. Babul G. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 8074-8077Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), ε280 = 1.5 ml/mg·cm for the monoclonal antibodies (18Onoue K. Yagi Y. Grossberg A.L. Pressman D. Immunochemistry. 1965; 2: 401-415Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), ε280 = 0.46 ml/mg·cm for the α subunit of tryptophan synthase (19Miles E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 6016-6025Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and ε410 = 8.58 ml/mg·cm for holocytochrome c(20Margoliash E. Frohwirt N. Biochem. J. 1959; 71: 570-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar). Absorption spectra were recorded in a Lambda 2 double beam spectrophotometer (Perkin-Elmer) and fluorescence spectra in a LS-5 double monochromator spectrofluorometer (Perkin-Elmer), both thermostatted at 20 °C. For quantitative heme binding studies, the quenching of the intrinsic fluorescence (excitation at 295 nm, emission at 348 nm) was measured immediately after addition of the heme. The excitation and emission bandwidth were adjusted to 5 nm. When low apocytochrome c concentrations were used (0.4 μm) the solution was supplemented with 100 μg/ml of pure α subunit from Escherichia coli tryptophan synthase in order to prevent adsorption of the apocytochrome onto the walls of the cuvette; because this protein contains no tryptophan, the fluorescence background thus introduced was only moderate. The inner filter and dilution effects on the measured fluorescence due to heme addition was determined in a control experiment with a mixture of lysozyme (25 μg/ml) and tryptophan synthase α subunit (100 μg/ml), and the correction factor was applied to the fluorescence measured with apocytochrome c. Circular dichroism spectra were recorded in a CD6 spectropolarimeter (Jobin-Yvon, Longjumeau, France) equipped with a thermostatted (20 °C) cell holder. The optical path of the cells was 0.2 mm for the far UV CD spectra and 1 cm for the near UV/visible CD spectra. The scanning interval was 0.2 nm, the integration time was 1 s, and the bandwidth was kept constant at 2 nm. Five successive scans of each solution were averaged. The spectrum of the buffer alone, obtained under the same scanning conditions, was substracted from that of the sample solution to obtain the CD contribution of the protein to the spectrum. Amino acid analysis of apo- and holocytochrome c was achieved in duplicate on a Beckman 6300 amino acid analyzer after acid hydrolysis of 0.2-mg protein samples in sealed tubes for 20 h at 110 °C in 6 n HCl and 0.2% phenol. For molecular weight measurements by mass spectrometry, samples of lyophilized apo or holocytochrome cwere dissolved in water:methanol:formic acid (50:50:5) and introduced into an API 365 (Perkin-Elmer-Sciex, Thornhill, Canada) triple-quadrupole mass spectrometer at 5 μl/min by means of a syringe pump (Harvard Apparatus, South Natick, MA). The device was equipped with an atmospheric pressure ion source used to sample positive ions produced from a pneumatically assisted electrospray interface. The ionspray probe tip was held at 4.5 kV, and the orifice voltage was set at 45 V. The mass spectrum was scanned continuously from m/z700–1800 with a scan step of 0.1 and a dwell time per step of 2.0 ms resulting in a scan duration of 22.0 s. Ten scans were averaged for each analysis. Mass calibration of the instrument was accomplished by matching ions of polypropylene glycol to known reference masses stored in the mass calibration table of the instrument. Data were collected on a Power Macintosh 8600/200 and processed through the Biotoolbox 2.2 software from Sciex. Ultracentrifugations were performed in a Beckman Optima-XLA analytical centrifuge, using standard double sector cells with 1.2-mm-thick aluminum centerpieces. The temperature was 20 °C. The cells were scanned at the wavelengths indicated in the text. For sedimentation velocity runs, single scans were performed at constant time intervals. The sedimentation profiles were analyzed using the XLAVEL program (Beckman) provided with the analytical centrifuge. The observed sedimentation coefficients were corrected for density and viscosity of the solvent to obtain the standard sedimentation coefficients. For sedimentation-diffusion equilibrium studies, 0.15 μl of sample solution were laid over 50 μl of fluorochemical FC43 (3 m-Minesotta). Radial scans were recorded at 1.5-h intervals for at least 18 h to check that equilibrium was reached. When equilibrium was achieved, 5 or 10 successive scans were averaged to improve the signal to noise ratio in the recordings. The centrifuge was then accelerated to 59,000 rpm to clear the meniscus from any residual protein and determine the absorbance base line. The protein distribution at equilibrium was analyzed with the Origin-based Optima XL-A Data Analysis Software (Beckman). The different fitting models (Ideal 1, Ideal 2, and Assoc4) for single data sets (XLA-Single program) were systematically tested and the best fitting was retained on the basis of both the χ2 value and the lack of systematic deviation of the residuals. In all cases, the base line was first fixed at the value observed after meniscus clearing and allowed to float only as an ultimate fitting refinement, which was accepted only if the resulting baseline differed by less than 0.02 absorbance unit from that determined experimentally. The value of the partial specific volume used for molecular weight calculations and for sedimentation coefficient corrections was 0.719, as determined (21Cohn E.J. Edsall J.T. Proteins, Amino Acids and Peptides as Ions and Dipolar Ions. Reinhold, New York1943: 370-381Google Scholar) from the amino acid composition of cytochrome c. The affinities of antibodies for holocytochrome c and the noncovalent heme-apocytochromec complex were measured by the method of Friguet et al. (22Friguet B. Chaffotte A.F. Djavadi-Ohaniance L. Goldberg M.E. J. Immunol. Methods. 1985; 77: 305-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (1130) Google Scholar). Briefly, a constant amount of monoclonal antibody was incubated with a varying amount of the antigen until equilibrium was reached. The quantity of antibody that remained free at each concentration of antigen was monitored by a classical indirect ELISA in which holocytochrome c was coated in the microtitration plate. A nonlinear regression method was used to extract affinity constants from the saturation curves. Each affinity measurement was done in triplicate. Experiments were performed on the MicroCal MCS ultra-sensitive titration calorimeter (MicroCal Inc., Northampton, MA) using the OBSERVER software provided by the manufacturer for instrument control and data acquisition (23Wiseman T. Williston S. Brandts J.F. Lin L.N. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 179: 131-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (2433) Google Scholar). To improve base line stability, the temperature of the adiabatic jacquet was kept 5 °C below the temperature of the experiment by setting the circulating water bath at 10 °C and by activating the jacquet feedback power, and temperature was equilibrated for 12 h. During a titration experiment, the protein sample was thermostatted at 20.0 ± 0.1 °C in a stirred (410 rpm) reaction cell (1.3514 ml), and aliquots of the titrant solution were injected from a 100-μl or 250-μl syringe as indicated in the legends of the figures. The reference cell of the calorimeter contained water plus 0.01% sodium azide. Data points were averaged and stored at 2-s intervals. All buffer solutions were thoroughly degassed by stirring under vacuum before use (buffer compositions are given in the figure legends). Protein samples were prepared in buffer of the same batch to minimize artifacts due to any differences in buffer composition. Titration experiments were performed with protein concentrations in the reaction cell and in the syringe insuring a final titrant/binding-site molar ratio of 2:1 in the reaction cell. Raw calorimetric data,i.e. heats released accompanying the addition of aliquots of titrant solution into the protein solution in the reaction cell, were processed using the software package ORIGIN (23Wiseman T. Williston S. Brandts J.F. Lin L.N. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 179: 131-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (2433) Google Scholar, 24Lin L.N. Brandts J.F. Weis R.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6564-6570Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The area under the resulting peak following each injection is proportional to the heat of interaction Q. When corrected for the titrant dilution heat and normalized to the concentration of added titrant, Qis equal to the binding enthalpy ΔH′b at that particular degree of binding. The calorimetric binding isotherm was fitted by an iterative nonlinear least squares algorithm (the Marquardt method) to a binding model as indicated in the text. The association (K a) or dissociation (K d) constants, molar binding stoichiometry (N), and molar binding enthalpy (ΔH°), were determined directly from the fitted curve. The Gibbs free energy and molar entropy of binding were calculated using the equations ΔG° = −RT ln K a and ΔS° = (ΔH° − ΔG°)/T, respectively, where R is the gas constant and T the absolute temperature in Kelvin. An efficient procedure for cleaving the covalent bonds linking the heme to two cysteine residues in cytochrome c has been previously described (25Paul K.G. Acta Chem. Scand. 1950; 4: 239-246Crossref Google Scholar). Based on this procedure, we devised a new purification method based on the expected difference in solubility between apo- and holocytochrome c. Indeed, in the holoprotein a large number of hydrophobic residues are buried in the core of the molecule, in contact with the heme (26Takano T. Kallai O.B. Swanson R. Dickerson R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 5234-5255Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas in the unfolded apoprotein, these residues are exposed to the solvent. Thus, the heme and apoprotein were first resolved by treatment with silver sulfate (10Stellwagen E. Rysavy R. Babul G. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 8074-8077Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and, after centrifugation and dialysis (see under “Materials and Methods”), the resulting mixture was treated with 1% ammonium sulfate. This was enough to completely precipitate apocytochrome c, whereas holocytochrome c remained entirely soluble under these conditions. After centrifugation, the ammonium sulfate precipitate was dissolved in 6 m guanidinium chloride and 50 mmammonium acetate at pH 5 containing 0.5 m DTT. The guanidine was then removed by extensive dialysis against 50 mm ammonium acetate, pH 5, supplemented with 5 mm DTT. After dialysis, the apocytochrome c was obtained in a soluble form. A typical purification based on these steps is described in Table I.Table ILarge scale purification of apocytochrome cPurification stepVolumeProtein concentrationA 400/A 280Total proteinmlmg/mlmgHolocytochrome c stock solution2504.2100Before (NH4)2SO4254.1aThis concentration, determined by use of the extinction coefficient of apocytochrome c at 280 nm, is slightly overestimated because the residual heme contributes to the absorption at this wavelength.0.38102aThis concentration, determined by use of the extinction coefficient of apocytochrome c at 280 nm, is slightly overestimated because the residual heme contributes to the absorption at this wavelength.After (NH4)2SO4272.550.00969a This concentration, determined by use of the extinction coefficient of apocytochrome c at 280 nm, is slightly overestimated because the residual heme contributes to the absorption at this wavelength. Open table in a new tab The absorption spectrum of the resulting protein showed very little residual absorbance in the 400 nm region (Table I), indicating that no significant amount of heme remained in the purified apocytochromec. However, a very small shoulder near 350 nm could still be observed in some preparations (A 350/A 280 < 0.04). No attempt was made to identify the nature of this trace contaminant. Purified apocytochrome c was submitted to amino acid analysis to verify its chemical integrity. The amino acid composition expected from the known sequence of cytochrome c was obtained. The two cysteinyl side chains were already reported to be obtained in the reduced state (11Fisher W.R. Taniuchi H. Anfinsen C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 3188-3195Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The absorption and fluorescence spectra showed that the tryptophan residue was present and intact in the apocytochrome preparation. The mass spectrum of the apocytochrome cpreparation showed a largely predominant peak at an estimated mass of 11,743.0 ± 0.7 Da. The excess of 42 Da over the mass calculated from the known amino acid sequence of horse cytochrome c(11701.6 Da) corresponds exactly to an acetylation, a chemical modification known to exist at the N-terminal extremity of cytochromec. The same excess in mass was observed with holocytochromec, indicating that the acetylation indeed existed in the starting material. These observations lead to the conclusion that the methionine residues have not been altered by the procedure used to prepare apocytochrome c. The far UV CD and the fluorescence emission spectra of apocytochromec were recorded (data not shown) and found to be essentially identical to those previously reported (10Stellwagen E. Rysavy R. Babul G. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 8074-8077Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Fisher W.R. Taniuchi H. Anfinsen C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 3188-3195Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The far UV CD spectrum showed no signal characteristic of secondary structure, and the fluorescence emission spectrum was that of solvent exposed tryptophan residues, two features confirming that apocytochrome cappears devoid of detectable organized secondary and tertiary structure. The sedimentation coefficient of apocytochrome c (30 μm) in 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, and 5 mm DTT was determined by analytical centrifugation at 20 °C and 59,000 rpm. The observed sedimentation coefficient was 1.08 ± 0.05 S. After correction for the density and viscosity of the solvent, the standard sedimentation coefficient was found to bes 20,w = 1.13 ± 0.05 S. From this value and from the molecular weight of N-acetylated apocytochromec (11,744 Da), one could estimate the Stokes radius of the apoprotein to be about 25 Å, a value compatible with that determined by dynamic light scattering under similar solvent conditions (27Damaschun G. Damaschun H. Gast K. Zirwer D. Bychkova V.E. Int. J. Biol. Macromol. 1991; 13: 217-221Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The sedimentation profile showed a unique, symmetrical boundary, suggesting that the preparation of apocytochrome c contained no low molecular weight aggregates. This was confirmed by observing that the absorptions at 280 nm of a 62 μm solution of apocytochrome c in the centrifugation cell immediately after reaching 5000 and 59,000 rpm were, within the experimental precision (i.e. ± 2%), identical. Moreover, these plateau absorbances were equal to the absorbance measured in a spectrophotometer before the centrifugation, indicating the absence heavy aggregates. Apo-cytochrome c was saturated with heme as described previously (13Dumont M.E. Corin A.F. Campbell G.A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7368-7378Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), and its spectral properties were investigated under reducing conditions (5 mm DTT) in the absence of cyanide. As previously reported, the absorption spectrum of the heme-apocytochrome c mixture showed a Soret absorption band at about 406 nm that, after a rapid initial change, underwent a slow further increase. The fluorescence spectrum of the mixture showed a strong quenching of the tryptophan fluorescence emission, which was used to monitor the formation of the heme-cytochrome ccomplex. The results (not shown) from 5 experiments conducted at apocytochrome c concentrations of 0.4 and 2.1 μm showed simple binding with a dissociation constant of 1.4 ± 0.2 μm and 2 hemes bound per polypeptide chain, in excellent agreement with previous reports (13Dumont M.E. Corin A.F. Campbell G.A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7368-7378Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The far UV CD spectrum of the noncovalent complex showed an increase in the amplitude of the ellipticity in the 220 nm region. This confirmed previous reports indicating that the far UV CD spectrum of the noncovalent complex, although quite different from that of native holocytochromec, reflects the presence of some organized secondary structure. The hydrodynamic properties of the noncovalent complex were then investigated. A solution of apocytochrome c (4 or 8 μm) was partly saturated with a limiting amount of heme (total concentration, 2 or 4 μm, respectively) to minimize possible “nonspecific” heme binding and optical problems due to the very poor solubility of free heme at neutral pH. The sedimentation of the noncovalent complex was specifically observed by scanning the centrifugation cell at 420 nm, where apocytochrome shows no absorption. The standard sedimentation coefficient thus obtained wass 20,w = 1.88 ± 0.06 S, a value identical to that determined for native holocytochrome c(s 20,w = 1.80 ± 0.04 S). Assuming that the noncovalent complex is monomeric, this indicates that the noncovalent complex is as tightly packed as native holocytochrome c, with a Stokes radius estimated to be about 16.2 Å. That the noncovalent complex is monomeric was verified by sedimentation-diffusion equilibrium of the noncovalent complex. A 6.2 μm solution of apocytochrome c was saturated with 6.2 μm heme and submitted to centrifugation at 40,000 rpm and 20 °C. The centrifugation cell was scanned for absorbance at 560 nm, a wavelength at which only the heme-cytochromec complex absorbed, ensuring that neither unsaturated apocytochrome c nor free heme that might exist in the solution would contribute to the absorption. The absorbance distribution after 18 h of centrifugation was analyzed. The experimental data were fit using as a model an ideal solution with a unique molecular species. The best fit provided an estimate of 12,830 Da for the molecular weight of the heme-apocytochrome ccomplex, a value reasonably close to those calculated for the monomeric noncovalent complex between the apoprotein and one or two hemes (12,360 and 12,976 Da, respectively). However, whereas equilibrium seemed at fi"

The soluble state of the subunit exhibits a partially folded intermediate during equilibrium unfolding experiments, whose C-terminal domain is unfolded (Greene, B., and King, J. (1999) J. Biol. Chem. 274, 16135–16140). Four mutant scaffolding proteins exhibiting temperature-sensitive defects in different stages of particle assembly were purified. The purified mutant proteins adopted a similar conformation to wild type, but all were destabilized with respect to wild type. Analysis of the thermal melting transitions showed that the mutants S242F and Y214W further destabilized the C-terminal domain, whereas substitutions near the N terminus either destabilized a different domain or affected interactions between domains. Two mutant proteins carried an additional cysteine residue, which formed disulfide cross-links but did not affect the denaturation transition. These mutants differed both from temperature-sensitive folding mutants found in other P22 structural proteins and from the thermolabile temperature-sensitive mutants described for T4 lysozyme. The results suggest that the defects in these mutants are due to destabilization of domains affecting the weak subunit-subunit interactions important in the assembly and function of the virus precursor shell.

Although the scaffolding proteins of bacteriophage P22 participate in polymerization of the viral coat monomers into a stable icosahedral capsid lattice, the spherical complexes of 200–300 scaffolding subunits assembled within the precursor shells are metastable structures, dissociating in the cell as a prerequisite to DNA packaging and dissociating in the test tube under very mild conditions (1King J. Casjens S. Nature. 1974; 251: 112-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 2Fuller M.T. King J. Virology. 1981; 112: 529-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 3Prevelige Jr., P.E. Thomas D. King J. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 202: 743-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). The assembled state of the scaffolding subunits lacks icosahedral symmetry (4Thuman-Commike P.A. Greene B. Jakana J. Prasad B.V.V. King J. Prevelige P.E. Chiu W. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 260: 85-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) and, although closely packed, may be only loosely associated. The dissociated subunits are not covalently modified with respect to their assembled state and participate in subsequent rounds of procapsid assembly. Its biological role in coupled assembly/dissociation cycles suggests that the scaffolding protein would need to be a conformationally flexible molecule. Although the three-dimensional structure is not known, Parker et al. (5Parker M.H. Stafford III, W.F. Prevelige Jr., P.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 268: 655-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) estimated dimensions of 232 Å long by 22 Å wide from analytical ultracentrifugation data. This elongated molecule does not appear to have a tightly packed hydrophobic core like that of a typical globular protein, because no protected core was detected by deuterium exchange (6Tuma R. Prevelige Jr., P.E. Thomas Jr., G.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 4619-4627Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), and it binds many molecules of 1–1′-bi (4-anilino)naphthalene-5-sulfonic acid (bisANS), a probe for exposed hydrophobic surfaces on proteins (7Teschke C.M. King J. Prevelige Jr., P.E. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 10658-10665Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Denaturation and proteolysis experiments indicated that the C-terminal end of the molecule was a distinct easily melted domain that interacts with the coat subunits (8Greene B. King J. J. Biol.

Low stability of this domain may reflect its need to undergo conformational transitions during assembly within the cell. Despite many efforts at their isolation, mutations in the scaffolding protein gene with physiological defects in folding or assembly have been recovered at very low frequency, considering the recovery of mutations in other P22 genes (9Smith D.H. Berget P.B. King J. Genetics. 1980; 96: 331-352Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Casjens S. Eppler K. Sampson L. Parr R. Wyckhoff E. Genetics. 1991; 127: 637-647Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Only four strains of independent origin defective in scaffolding protein function have been isolated over a period spanning two decades (11Bazinet C. King J. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 202: 77-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 12Greene B. King J. Virology. 1996; 225: 82-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). This represents a property of the protein, rather than the gene, because nonsense mutations generating stop codons occur at expected frequencies (10Casjens S. Eppler K. Sampson L. Parr R. Wyckhoff E.

By comparison some 70 sites of temperature-sensitive folding (tsf) 1The abbreviations used are: tsf , temperature-sensitive for folding; ts , temperature-sensitive; DTT, dithiothreitol. mutants have been characterized in the tailspike gene. In the adjacent gene for the coat protein, some 17 sites of tsf mutations have been isolated (14Gordon C.L. King J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9358-9368Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The distinctive feature of these mutants is that they do not act by destabilizing the native state of the mutant protein; mutant proteins formed at low temperature are as thermostable as wild type when incubated at restrictive temperature. This is true both for tailspike tsf mutants (15Goldenberg D.P. King J. J. Mol. Biol. 1981; 145: 633-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 16Sturtevant J.M. Yu M.-H. Haase-Pettingell C.

Chem. 1995; 270: 16595-16601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In both cases the ts amino acid substitutions act by destabilizing an already thermolabile partially folded intermediate in the folding pathway. At restrictive temperatures these species associate to form inclusion bodies in vivo and high molecular weight aggregates in vitro (19Speed M. Wang D.I.C. King J. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 900-908Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 20Speed M. Wang D.I.C. King J. Nat. Biotechnol. 1996; 14: 1283-1287Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). In contrast, no evidence of competing off pathway aggregation reactions have been detected during scaffolding protein folding either in vivo or in vitro, even during thermal denaturation (8Greene B. King J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 274: 16135-16140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (16) Google Scholar,12Greene B. King J. Virology. 1996; 225: 82-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The mutant scaffolding proteins expressed by the fourts strains folded and assembled into procapsid-like structures within infected cells at both permissive and restrictive temperatures (12Greene B. King J. Virology. 1996; 225: 82-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). However, the procapsids formed from the mutant proteins at restrictive temperatures were not competent for DNA packaging or other steps in virus maturation (12Greene B. King J. Virology. 1996; 225: 82-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Two of the mutant strains carry single amino acid substitutions in their scaffolding protein, S242F and Y214W. The other two mutants carry more than one substitution: R74C/L177I and V45A/R74C/Q149W/A199V. The double mutation V45A/A199V, however, is silent. 2B. Greene, unpublished observations. The distribution of the substitutions is shown in Fig. 1. Assembly of a viable procapsid requires the incorporation of a dodecameric ring of the gene 1 portal protein at one vertex of the shell to form a DNA packaging channel (21Bazinet C. Benbaset J. King J. Carazo J. Carracosa J. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 1849-1856Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). During particle assembly scaffolding subunits presumably interact with coat subunits, with each other, and with portal subunits. The S242F and Y214W mutations in the C-terminal third of the scaffolding sequence are defective in insertion of the DNA packaging portal into the procapsid structure (12Greene B. King J. Virology. 1996; 225: 82-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 21Bazinet C. Benbaset J. King J. Carazo J. Carracosa J. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 1849-1856Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The mutant subunits carrying the R74C substitutions were defective in scaffolding protein release from the procapsid (12Greene B. King J. Virology. 1996; 225: 82-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). We report here the solution properties of the mutant scaffolding proteins and their behavior during equilibrium unfolding experiments. To be able to relate the properties of the purified proteins to the actual defects expressed within cells, it was necessary to characterize the purified proteins carrying the multiple substitutions because the severity of the phenotype is affected by the interaction of the substitutions. The results reported here with the purified mutant proteins indicate that unlike the tsf mutations in the coat and tailspike subunits, these mutations do destabilize the folded conformation of the subunit. However, unlike thermolabile ts mutations, of T4 lysozyme for example, which are predominantly buried (22Alber T. Sun D.P. Nye J.A. Muchmore D.C. Matthews B.W. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 3754-3758Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar), these substitutions appear to be on the subunit surface. They are most likely to be affecting the subunit-subunit interactions involved in the cycle of assembly and dissociation needed for capsid assembly by destabilizing local functional regions. The phage strains used in the preparation of wild type proteins carried the c1-7 mutation to ensure entry into the lytic pathway, 13amH101, which delays lysis, and either 2amH202 or 3amN6, which block DNA packaging. The mutant strains used for the purification of the scaffolding proteins are listed in TableI. The isolation of these mutants is described by Greene and King (12Greene B. King J. Virology. 1996; 225: 82-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Column 1 shows the amino acid substitutions originally identified from sequencing regions of gene 8. Subsequent characterization of these mutants has revealed additional mutations. 3B. Greene, P. E. Prevelige, Jr., and J. King, unpublished observations.

Open table in a new tab Phage strains carrying the 8ts mutations were used for the preparation of procapsids containing mutant scaffolding proteins. Infections with these strains were carried out at 30 °C. Apart from this the mutant procapsids were prepared by the same protocol as for wild type (3Prevelige Jr., P.E. Thomas D. King J. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 202: 743-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Procapsids were obtained from mutant-infected cells in amounts comparable with preparations of wild type procapsids. Mutant scaffolding proteins were purified from procapsids using the protocol previously described for wild type (3Prevelige Jr., P.E. Thomas D. King J. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 202: 743-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), although a higher concentration of guanidine HCl (0.9 minstead of 0.5 m) was used to extract scaffolding protein from R74C/L177I and R74C/Q149W procapsids. The yield of R74C/L177I mutant scaffolding protein was somewhat less than that of the others because it was not possible to remove all the R74C/L177I scaffolding protein from procapsids even after three extractions with guanidine HCl. Wild type and mutant scaffolding proteins were dialyzed into phosphate buffer (20 mm K2HPO4, 25 mm NaCl, pH 7.6, with HCl) before use. The concentration was checked by absorbance at 280 nm, based on an extinction coefficient of 1.61 × 104 liters mol−1cm−1 for wild type, R74C/L177I, and S242F; 2.08 × 104 liter mol−1 cm−1 for Y214W; and 2.21 × 104 liter mol−1cm−1 for R74C/Q149W. The extinction coefficients of the wild type and mutant proteins were calculated using the method of Johnson (23Johnson W.C. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biophys. Chem. 1988; 17: 145-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). Fluorescence spectra were recorded of wild type or mutant scaffolding proteins at 100 μg/ml (0.3 μm) at constant temperature, with the excitation wavelength set to 280 nm, and the emission scanned from 300 to 400 nm. The excitation and emission slit widths were 2.5 and 5 nm, and the PMT voltage was set to 700 V. Circular dichroism spectra were recorded from 200 to 250 nm at constant temperature in a 0.5-cm-pathlength cell. The spectral bandwidth was 1.5 nm, the step size was 1 nm, the averaging time was 0.4 s, and five scans were recorded and averaged for each sample. KI quenching experiments were performed in phosphate/NaCl buffer with 10 mmNa2S203 added to keep the iodide reduced (24Lakowicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. Plenum Press, New York1983: 279-283Google Scholar). The final concentration of wild type scaffolding protein was 100 μg/ml (0.3 μm); that of the two mutant proteins Y214W and R74C/Q149W was 50 μg/ml because the fluorescence of these mutants was approximately twice that of the wild type protein. To avoid possible effects of ionic strength changes on protein conformation, the ionic strength was held constant by the addition of KCl to give a total concentration of KI and KCl of 0.25 m. These concentrations of KI are sufficiently low so as to produce no inner filter effect (25Teschke C.M. King J. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 10839-10847Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Samples were excited at 280 nm, and the emission was monitored at 330 nm. Excitation and emission slit widths were 2.5 and 5 nm, the PMT voltage was 700, and the temperature was 3 °C. Wild type and mutant scaffolding proteins were diluted to 100 μg/ml (0.3 μm) in phosphate/NaCl buffer before use. In some cases DTT was added to 2 mm, and the samples were incubated for an hour at 4 °C before starting the experiment. Fresh samples were prepared for each experiment. The samples were heated from 3 to 90 °C, and denaturation was monitored by either fluorescence intensity at 330 nm with excitation at 280 nm, or circular dichroism ellipticity at 222 nm as described in the accompanying paper (8Greene B. King J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 274: 16135-16140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The fluorescence and CD spectra of the mutant proteins were first compared with that of wild type to determine whether they folded to similar conformations. Fig. 2 shows the CD spectra of the wild type and mutant scaffolding proteins at several temperatures. As expected, the mutant proteins were, like wild type, predominantly α-helical. Even at 3 °C, however, at which point all the proteins should be maximally folded, the mutant proteins all had different CD spectra than wild type. The secondary structure compositions of the folded proteins were estimated using the standards of Chang, Wu, and Yang (26Chang C.T. Wu C.-S. Yang J.T. Anal. Biochem. 1978; 91: 13-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (1025) Google Scholar). Analysis of the wild type CD spectrum suggested a composition of 30% α-helix, 10% β-sheet, 18% turn, and 42% random coil, in excellent agreement with the composition determined by Teschke et al. (7Teschke C.M. King J. Prevelige Jr., P.E. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 10658-10665Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The spectrum did not display the high θ222/θ208ratio typical of a coiled-coil but was characteristic of simple α-helices (27Zhou N.E. Kay C.M. Hodges R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2664-2670Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The spectra of the four mutant proteins at 3 °C were similar to each other and were composed of 25% α-helix, 10% β-sheet, 20% turn, and 45% random coil. The pattern of secondary structure alteration for the mutants resembled that observed for the wild type protein at higher temperatures. The spectrum of wild type scaffolding protein at 25 °C could be fit as 27% α-helix, 10% β-sheet, 19% turn, and 44% random coil. These results suggested that the mutants were in a similar conformation at 3 °C to that adopted by the wild type protein at higher temperatures. By 90 °C the spectra of the wild type and the four mutant proteins were superimposible and predominantly random coil, demonstrating that all had reached the same unfolded state. The fluorescence spectra of the two mutant proteins without extra tryptophans were similar to wild type over a range of temperatures; R74C/L177I was almost identical, whereas the fluorescence of S242F was slightly less, perhaps indicating a slightly less compact structure (Fig. 3). The fluorescence of both the mutant proteins containing extra tryptophans, Y214W and R74C/Q149W, was approximately twice that of wild type, as expected. The spectra of these two mutants appeared slightly red-shifted with respect to wild type, suggesting that the new tryptophans might be in more exposed environments than the wild type tryptophan. The degree of tryptophan exposure can be assessed by collisional quenching of fluorescence using iodide ion. Because iodide is an ionic molecule it cannot penetrate into protein interiors, so more deeply buried tryptophans are less effectively quenched. This experiment was carried out at 3 °C, at which point the proteins would be maximally folded. A Stern-Volmer plot (24Lakowicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. Plenum Press, New York1983: 279-283Google Scholar) was used to determine the degree of fluorescence quenching by iodide of wild type and the two mutant scaffoldings with extra tryptophan residues (Fig.4). The slope of a Stern-Volmer plot indicates the degree of quenching; the steeper the slope, the greater the degree of quenching. The slope for the wild type tryptophan was about 1, which indicates relatively little quenching, as expected for a tryptophan mostly protected from solvent. The Stern-Volmer plots for the mutant proteins are not linear, because two tryptophans of different accessibility contribute to the data. The initial slopes, which primarily reflect the influence of the more readily quenched tryptophan, were 1.6 for R74C/Q149W and 2.7 for Y214W as compared with a slope of 3.3 obtained for the completely denatured P22 coat protein (25Teschke C.M. King J. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 10839-10847Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The tryptophan at 149 is thus more exposed than that at 134 but may still be partially buried, whereas that at 214 is probably on or near the surface of the protein. Thermal melts of all the mutant proteins were performed as for wild type. All the scaffolding proteins were analyzed at 100 μg/ml, a concentration at which the scaffolding proteins are almost entirely monomeric (5Parker M.H. Stafford III, W.F. Prevelige Jr., P.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 268: 655-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), 4P. E. Prevelige, Jr., unpublished observations. so that the effects of self-association should not affect the observed unfolding process. The CD spectra demonstrated that the mutant proteins all began with slightly different structures at the initial temperature (Fig. 2). The thermal melts, as monitored by CD at 222 nm, showed that all the mutant proteins were also at least partially destabilized with respect to wild type (Fig. 5). Cooling of the proteins back to 3 °C resulted in some loss of the original signal (approximately 20%), but this effect did not appear to be due to aggregation and did not vary significantly between the wild type and mutant proteins. The thermal denaturations of the mutant proteins S242F and Y214W had similar characteristics. Although these proteins were initially less structured than wild type, they appeared to be stably folded at low temperatures. The unfolding transition for both these mutants began earlier than for wild type. Unlike wild type, the data for these mutants were not well fit by a two-state model, indicating that one or more domains was more strongly affected than others. This effect was more visible for Y214W, for which the early part of the denaturation curve was shifted to lower temperature, whereas the later half of the curve corresponded closely to the wild type curve. The mutant S242F appeared more uniformly destabilized. The R74C/Q149W and R74C/L177I mutations produced more dramatic destabilizations. The thermal melts of these mutant proteins were clearly not two-state but showed a sharp break between two processes at about 40 °C. The first region, accounting for approximately half of the total CD signal, was extremely unstable, because it began to denature at the lowest temperature. The melting of this region appeared very noncooperative, with the transition being almost flat rather than sigmoidal. Indeed, this phase resembled the melting of a molten globule more than a folded protein (28Ptitsyn O.B. J. Protein Chem. 1987; 6: 273-293Crossref Scopus (522) Google Scholar). The rest of the molecule, however, was as stable as wild type in the case of R74C/Q149W and only slightly destabilized for R74C/L177I. The thermal melts of the mutant proteins were also observed by fluorescence. Two mutant proteins, S242F and R74C/L177I, contained only the single wild type tryptophan residue. As observed by fluorescence (Fig. 6), the thermal melts of these two proteins were similar in shape to that of wild type and could also be fit by a simple two-state transition model. Both proteins, however, were somewhat destabilized with respect to wild type, with Tm values of 54 and 55 °C as compared with a Tm of 58 °C calculated for the wild type protein (TableII). The fluorescence data confirmed that the more stable tryptophan-containing region was not seriously affected by the R74C/L177I substitutions, despite the severe destabilization of secondary structure observed by CD.Table IITm values calculated from fluorescence dataMutantTm1Tm2° CWild type58 ± 2S242F54 ± 2Y214W54 ± 329 ± 2R74C/L177I54 ± 1R74C/Q149W55 ± 1 Open table in a new tab The substitutions that introduced extra tryptophans would be expected to reveal new phases in unfolding if the tryptophans were in different domains than the wild type tryptophan residue. The melting curve for R74C/Q149W was not significantly different from wild type and had a Tm of 55 °C. The thermal melt of Y214W, however, was clearly not two-state. These data could be well fit by two transitions, with Tm values of 54 and 29 °C. Thus it appears that the presence of an additional tryptophan residue reveals the denaturation of a second, less stable domain. It is possible that this domain is somewhat destabilized by the effects of the mutation, as the differences between the wild type and Y214W denaturation monitored by CD would also suggest. However, the noncoincidence of the CD and fluorescence data for the wild type protein (8Greene B. King J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 274: 16135-16140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (16) Google Scholar) demonstrates early denaturation of some portions of helical structure that is not picked up by monitoring fluorescence of Trp134 alone. We therefore think it is likely that the region containing Tyr214unfolds at lower temperatures than that containing Trp134in the wild type protein as well as the Y214W mutant. This would be consistent with previous results demonstrating that the C-terminal half of the protein is less stable (8Greene B. King J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 274: 16135-16140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The early unfolding event seen by CD in the thermal melt of R74C/Q149W was not observed by fluorescence. This may indicate that the destabilization of this mutant protein is primarily due to the R74C mutation, whereas the region around Q149W is not affected by this substitution. The same may be true for the L177I mutation. Under the conditions used for these experiments, these two mutant proteins were disulfide-linked dimers (5Parker M.H. Stafford III, W.F. Prevelige Jr., P.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 268: 655-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar).3 These cysteines must be on the surface of the native conformation. To distinguish the effects of dimerization from that of the mutation itself, thermal melts were redone in the presence of 2 mm DTT for these two mutants and wild type protein (Fig. 7). Thermal melts monitored by fluorescence showed no difference from wild type or with results in the absence of DTT, suggesting that dimerization does not alter stability of the region containing Trp134 or that at 149 in the Q149W mutant strain. By CD, the monomeric proteins were slightly less stable, but the thermal denaturation curves had the same characteristic two phase appearance as in the absence of DTT. Thus it appears that the mutations are intrinsically destabilizing due to loss of the arginine residue, with dimerization not exerting a significant effect on stability. The mutant proteins studied here were isolated on the basis of defects caused in the intracellular assembly of the phage procapsid at temperatures at the high end of the physiological range (39–40 °C). Both the single amino acid substitutions and multiple amino acid substitutions acted to destabilize the conformation of the purified proteins. The fluorescence quenching experiments indicated that the two tryptophans introduced are at the protein surface. The cysteine substitution for arginine must also be at the protein surface. The location of the phenylalanine at the Ser242 site is unclear. Temperature-sensitive mutations fall into at least two categories: thermolabile mutants, which destabilize the native state of the folded protein (23Johnson W.C. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biophys. Chem. 1988; 17: 145-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar), and temperature-sensitive folding mutants, which do not affect the stability of the folded state but destabilize folding intermediates (29Goldenberg D.P. Smith D.H. King J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 7060-7064Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 30Mitraki A. Fane B. Haase-Pettingell C. Sturtevant J. King J. Science. 1991; 253: 54-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 31King J. Haase-Pettingell C. Robinson A.S. Speed M. Mitraki A. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 57-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). ts mutants of T4 lysozyme represent the thermolabile class. The sites of the ts substitutions are buried in the protein and are thought to act by destabilizing the hydrophobic core (22Alber T. Sun D.P. Nye J.A. Muchmore D.C. Matthews B.W. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 3754-3758Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). In contrast the tsf mutants of the P22 tailspike are predominantly at the protein surface (32Steinbacher S. Seckler R. Miller S. Steipe B. Huber R. Reinemer P. Science. 1994; 265: 383-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar, 33Haase-Pettingell C. King J. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 267: 88-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The scaffolding ts mutants fit neither class. At least three of them are at the protein surface, and yet they appear to destabilize the native state. We believe this reflects the distinct properties of the scaffolding protein, with an extended, flexible structure that lacks a typical hydrophobic core. Folding of such a protein is expected to be a simple process that would not involve any thermal-sensitive folding intermediates. Due to its lack of packed structure, most residues would be relatively exposed to the solvent, and mutant substitutions would have mainly local effects. The observed functional defects of the mutations examined here probably result from destabilizing the conformation of segments involved in subunit-subunit assembly and dissociation reactions. A recently proposed model for scaffolding protein structure consisted of two elongated domains made up of helical segments (34Tuma R. Parker M.H. Weigele P. Sampson L. Sun Y. Krishna N.R. Casjens S. Thomas Jr., G.J. Prevelige Jr., P.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 281: 81-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Interactions between the two halves of the protein appeared to be important for stabilization of the C-terminal domain, which was markedly less stable than the full-length protein when expressed as a fragment (34Tuma R. Parker M.H. Weigele P. Sampson L. Sun Y. Krishna N.R. Casjens S. Thomas Jr., G.J. Prevelige Jr., P.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 281: 81-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). This model is supported by our results, because all the mutations result in both some loss of secondary structure even at 3 °C as well as a decrease in cooperativity of unfolding, suggesting that localized unfolding in one part of the protein disrupts its interactions with the other domain and may result in some destabilization of these regions as well. The mutations S242F and Y214W block the incorporation of the DNA packaging portal into procapsids, indicating that these mutations affect a scaffolding protein site required either for binding the portal or forming an initiation complex to which the portal is recruited. Both mutations appeared to slightly destabilize a C-terminal region, but S242F differed from Y214W in also affecting the stability of N-terminal domains as observed by CD. This difference may explain why S242F also blocks incorporation of the pilot proteins, whereas Y214W does not (12Greene B. King J. Virology. 1996; 225: 82-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The proteins carrying the R74C/Q149W and R74C/L177I substitutions had significantly decreased stability of a large portion of secondary structure. This destabilization did not seem to be affected by the formation of disulfide-linked dimers between the scaffolding protein subunits. Within cells these mutants impaired the release of the scaffolding subunits from the procapsid (12Greene B. King J. Virology. 1996; 225: 82-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). These mutant sites seem unlikely to be part of a coat-binding region given the identification of the extreme C terminus as the essential coat-binding region (8Greene B. King J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 274: 16135-16140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (16) Google Scholar). In addition, a cloned scaffolding fragment lacking the N-terminal 140 residues (including Arg74) could assemble into procapsidsin vitro (35Parker M.H. Jablonsky M. Casjens S. Sampson L. Krishna N.R. Prevelige Jr., P.E. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 1583-1586Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Instead, the site of mutation may be a region involved in scaffolding-scaffolding binding. This suggestion is consistent with recent studies of scaffolding proteins from herpesviruses, which have identified regions N-terminal to the coat-binding domain that mediate scaffolding-scaffolding interactions in vitro (36Desai P. Person S. Virology. 1996; 220: 516-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 37Pelletier A. Do F. Brisebois J.J. Lagace L. Cordingley M.G. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 5197-5208Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 38Wood L.J. Baxter M.K. Plafker S.M. Gibson W. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 179-190Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is striking that although the mutant proteins are severely destabilized, the phenotypic effect is tighter binding within the capsid lattice (12Greene B. King J. Virology. 1996; 225: 82-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Because introduction of the cysteine residues permits dimerization in vitro, this could be retarding the exit of scaffolding molecules by blocking their exit through the channels. This seems unlikely to be the case in vivo, given the reducing environment of the cytoplasm but needs further study. Taken together these results are most consistent with the idea that the mutations alter a domain with a specific active function, for example of a scaffolding “release switch,” that it can no longer perform. The mutations may directly disrupt a release domain by destabilization. Alternatively, the mutations may disrupt interactions between domains, as indicated by the dramatic loss in unfolding cooperativity observed by CD, so that the release signal cannot be propagated from the N-terminal domain that interacts with other scaffolding protein subunits to the C-terminal domain involved in binding to the coat protein.
