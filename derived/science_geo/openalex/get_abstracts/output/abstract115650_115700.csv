https://openalex.org/W1990400035,"The transcription of genes encoding soluble proteins that reside in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is induced when unfolded proteins accumulate in the ER. Thus, an intracellular signal transduction pathway must exist that mediates communication between the ER lumen and the nucleus. We have identified a gene in S. cerevisiae, IRE1, that is required for this pathway: ire1- mutants cannot activate transcription of KAR2 and PDI1, which encode the ER resident proteins BiP and protein disulfide isomerase. Moreover, IRE1 is essential for cell viability under stress conditions that cause unfolded proteins to accumulate in the ER. IRE1 encodes a transmembrane serine/threonine kinase that we propose transmits the unfolded protein signal across the ER or inner nuclear membrane. IRE1 is also required for inositol prototrophy, suggesting that the induction of ER resident proteins is coupled to the biogenesis of new ER membrane."
https://openalex.org/W2067154171,"Many transcription factors can activate the initiation of DNA replication. We have used affinity chromatography to show that the acidic activation domains of the transcription factors VP16, GAL4, and p53 each bind selectively to human and yeast replication factor A (RPA). The binding is direct and to the largest subunit of the trimeric RPA complex, RPA-1. Mutations in VP16 that reduce the ability of GAL4-VP16 to activate polyomavirus DNA replication also compromise the binding of VP16 to RPA. We suggest that transcription factors may interact with RPA either to stabilize single-stranded DNA at a replication origin or to recruit DNA polymerase alpha to the replication initiation complex."
https://openalex.org/W1483016425,"The pivotal role of tyrosine kinases in signal transduction is well established, but the role of tyrosine phosphatases remains obscure. The discovery of src homology 2 domain-containing protein tyrosine phosphatases suggested roles for these molecules in growth factor signaling pathways, since src homology 2 domains direct association of downstream signaling molecules with activated growth factor receptors and other phosphotyrosyl proteins. We have found that SH-PTP2, a putative homologue of Drosophila corkscrew, associates in vivo with the ligand-activated epidermal growth factor and platelet-derived growth factor receptors. The N-terminal src homology 2 domain of SH-PTP2 directly associates with activated receptors. SH-PTP2 itself is a phosphoprotein, and it becomes tyrosyl phosphorylated upon growth factor activation. These findings suggest several possible models for SH-PTP2 signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2012932968,"The expression of H. influenzae fimbriae is subject to reversible phase variation between three expression levels. This phenomenon is controlled at the transcriptional level of two divergently orientated genes, hifA and hifB, encoding the major fimbrial subunit and the fimbrial chaperone, respectively. The hifA and hifB promoter regions were found to be clustered through an almost complete divergent overlap with a variable DNA backbone of repetitive TA units. Variation in the number of units changes the normally strictly constrained spacing between the −35 and −10 sequences and controls the bidirectional transcription initiation, thus forming a novel mechanism directing multiple gene transcription."
https://openalex.org/W1552859356,"Using a rapid single-step affinity chromatography procedure we have isolated the unactivated estrogen receptor from bovine uterus. Results of sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western analyses for protein extracts recovered from affinity chromatography of receptor cytosols, either preincubated or untreated with estradiol, suggest a component structure for the intact oligomeric receptor which includes hsp90, hsp70, p59, a 40-kDa cyclophilin-related protein, and an uncharacterized 22-kDa protein species. We have chemically determined the amino acid sequences of eight peptides derived from the 40-kDa component and now report the cloning and primary sequence of a cDNA encoding this protein, which is designated estrogen receptor-binding cyclophilin (ERBC). Homology analyses confirm that ERBC is a new member of the cyclophilin family and contains a C-terminal domain with significant sequence homology to an internal region of p59, a binding protein for the immunosuppressant FK506 (FKBP59). This conserved region includes a 3-unit tetratricopeptide repeat domain bounded at the C terminus by a putative calmodulin binding site. We propose that the tetratricopeptide repeat domain mediates the protein interaction properties of ERBC and p59. Both immunophilins may have important roles in receptor assembly and may represent a new category of ligand- and calcium-dependent modulators of protein function."
https://openalex.org/W1491183049,"Abstract The coding region of the human vasopressin type 2 receptor gene bears mutations in the individuals affected with congenital nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, a disease characterized by the inability of the kidney to concentrate urine in response to vasopressin. Although it is assumed that the mutations result in loss of receptor function, proof of this hypothesis is lacking. We introduced one of these naturally occurring point mutations leading to a single amino acid change (Arg137-->His) into wild type cDNA. The mutant protein was expressed, and the functional properties of the receptor were examined. The mutant receptor exhibited an unaltered binding affinity for vasopressin compared to the wild type but failed to stimulate the Gs/adenylyl cyclase system. These data provide biochemical proof that the mutant receptor is the cause of the disease."
https://openalex.org/W1544786964,"Several types of basic compounds structurally related to spermidine, one of the substrates for deoxyhypusine synthase, were tested as inhibitors of this enzyme. The results indicate that inhibitory compounds associate with the enzyme at the site of spermidine binding and must possess two charged primary amino or guanidino groups, or one of each. The efficiency of inhibition is related to the maximum possible distance between the primary amino groups and is adversely affected by substitutions on the secondary amino group or in the carbon chains of polyamines. The mono-guanyl derivatives are much more effective inhibitors than the parent amines or their bis-guanylated counterparts, N1-guanyl-1,7-diaminoheptane being the most effective compound with a Ki value of about 10 nM. Based on these observations we have proposed a model for the spermidine-binding site of deoxyhypusine synthase. Studies with Chinese hamster ovary cells reveal a direct correlation between prevention of hypusine formation by several guanyldiamines and their in vitro inhibition of deoxyhypusine synthase. This evidence for disruption of the initial step in the post-translational maturation of eukaryotic initiation factor 5A provides a basis for the potential control of protein biosynthesis and cell proliferation."
https://openalex.org/W38635977,"Purification and structural characterization of a novel pterin that is the immediate biosynthetic precursor for molybdopterin formation in Escherichia coli has been accomplished. The precursor is purified from acid extracts of cells of the Escherichia coli molybdopterin-deficient mutant chlN by reverse phase and ion exchange high performance liquid chromatography. Under a variety of conditions, this precursor oxidizes directly to the previously characterized pterin, compound Z (Johnson, J. L., Wuebbens, M. M., and Rajagopalan, K. V. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 13440-13447). Like, molybdopterin, the precursor is an oxygen-sensitive, 6-alkyl pterin with a 4-carbon phosphorylated side chain. Analysis by 31P NMR indicates that the precursor phosphate is bound in diester linkage to C-2' and C-4' of the side chain to form a 6-membered ring. The precursor does not contain either of the sulfurs present in molybdopterin, and reduction with sodium borohydride yields a C-1' hydroxyl function. Two-electron oxidation of the precursor results in stoichiometric production of the fully oxidized compound Z. Liquid chromatography-mass spectroscopy of the precursor yields an MH+ ion with a mass of 346, corresponding to a structure for the precursor which is a dihydro form of compound Z."
https://openalex.org/W1607419610,"Earlier reports show that p53, both wild type and mutants, may affect transcription. Wild-type p53 activates promoters with p53-binding sites while inhibiting promoters without binding sites. Mutant p53, on the other hand, has been shown to activate transcription from specific promoters. These observations suggest that both wild-type and mutant p53 may interact with a general transcription factor(s). In this report, we have shown that the cloned TATA-binding protein (TBP) from human and yeast interacts with human p53. TBP co-immunoprecipitates with wild-type or mutant human p53 when incubated with the p53-specific monoclonal antibody and Protein A-agarose. Wild-type murine p53 has also been found to interact with human TBP. Protein blot assays have demonstrated that the interaction between p53 and human TBP is direct. By gel retention analysis, we have shown that the complex of TBP and p53 (both wild type and mutant) can bind to the TATA box. The similar qualitative binding capability of wild-type and mutant p53 with human TBP and the similarity of the two complexes in binding to the TATA box suggest that the functional discrimination between wild-type and mutant p53 may not lie in their ability to bind TBP. The nature of the p53.TBP or p53.TBP.TATA complex may determine the success of transcription."
https://openalex.org/W1488651464,"The pterin component of the molybdenum cofactor, termed molybdopterin, is synthesized in Escherichia coli by enzymes encoded at the chl loci. A late step in the biosynthetic pathway, the conversion of a molybdopterin intermediate, precursor Z, to molybdopterin, requires the activity of a two-subunit protein, the converting factor. Precursor Z has many of the features of molybdopterin but lacks the dithiolene function essential for molybdenum ligation. Conversion of precursor Z to molybdopterin is accomplished by transfer of sulfur to produce the dithiolene. The present study describes an in vitro system for molybdopterin biosynthesis comprised of purified precursor Z and purified converting factor. It is established that these components are sufficient to yield molybdopterin, identified by conversion to its characteristic products, Form A, Form B, and dicarboxamidomethylmolybdopterin. Under conditions of precursor excess, the formation of molybdopterin was stoichiometric with converting factor, as would be expected in the absence of a sulfur-regenerating system. The labile product of the reaction, molybdopterin, remained associated with the converting factor large subunit. These results establish that the source of sulfur for molybdopterin biosynthesis is the converting factor and suggest that in vivo a novel sulfur cycle must function to resupply sulfur to the converting factor."
https://openalex.org/W1491889797,"The pseudo first-order rate constant kf of the creatine kinase (CK) forward reaction as well as the CK forward flux FCK,f have been shown to correlate better with cardiac performance than the steady-state levels of ATP and PCr (Bittl, J. A., and Ingwall, J. S. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 3512-3517). In order to elucidate the relationship between the CK kinetic parameters and brain activity, we have determined, using the non-invasive NMR technique of magnetization transfer, kf and FCK,f in rats, in which brain activity was experimentally varied by administration of either thiopental sodium or bicuculline to decrease or increase electro-encephalogram (EEG) intensity, respectively. The steady-state levels of ATP and PCr, as well as the accumulation of deoxyglucose 6-phosphate (DG-6P) in brain following intraperitoneal administration of deoxyglucose, were determined simultaneously by the NMR technique, whereas the cortical EEG was recorded in a separate experiment. The EEG intensity (range, 1-20 Hz), taken as a measure for brain performance, as well as the amount of DG-6P formed in brain, reflecting the synthesis rate of high energy phosphates (ATP and PCr), linearly correlated with kf. Despite large changes in both EEG intensity (50-250%) and kf (0.12-0.69 s-1) between thiopental sodium- and bicuculline-treated rats, the ATP levels remained constant, whereas the PCr levels decreased with high EEG activity. In contrast to the expectation based on model calculations of CK kinetics, the PCr levels did not increase above control values at reduced EEG intensity (50% of controls). At EEG intensities exceeding control values (bicuculline-treated rats) FCK,f increased as predicted by CK equilibrium. In conclusion, we have shown that in the rat brain, like in the heart, the CK forward rate constant kf, in contrast to ATP and PCr levels, is a sensitive reliable indicator of both increased and reduced function."
https://openalex.org/W1838580001,"The Escherichia coli CheY protein is activated by phosphorylation, and in turn alters flagellar rotation. To investigate the molecular mechanism of activation, an extensive collection of mutant CheY proteins was analyzed by behavioral assays, in vitro phosphorylation, and 19F NMR chemical shift measurements. Substitution of a positively charged residue (Arg or Lys) in place of Asp13 in the CheY activation site results in activation, even for mutants which cannot be phosphorylated. Thus phosphorylation plays an indirect role in the activation mechanism. Lys109, a residue proposed to act as a conformational switch in the activation site, is required for activation of CheY by either phosphorylation or mutation. The 19F NMR chemical shift assay described in the preceding article (Drake, S. K., Bourret, R. B., Luck, L. A., Simon, M. I., and Falke, J. J. (1993) J. Biol Chem. 268, 13081-13088) was again used to monitor six phenylalanine positions in CheY, including one position which probed the vicinity of Lys109. Mutations which activate CheY were observed to perturb the Lys109 probe, providing further evidence that Lys109 is directly involved in the activating conformational change. Two striking contrasts were observed between activation by mutation and phosphorylation. (i) Each activating mutation generates a relatively localized perturbation in the activation site region, whereas phosphorylation triggers a global structural change. (ii) The perturbation of the Lys109 region observed for activating mutations is not detected in the phosphorylated protein. These results are consistent with a two-step model of activated CheY docking to the flagellar switch."
https://openalex.org/W87278874,"A cDNA containing an open reading frame coding for the rat kidney cytochrome P-450 arachidonic acid epoxygenase was isolated from a male rat kidney cDNA library. Sequence analysis showed that with the exception of 11 nucleotides, this cDNA is identical with the published sequence for rat liver cytochrome 2C23 and encodes a polypeptide of 494 amino acids. Nucleic acid blot hybridization indicated that the levels of expression of the corresponding mRNA are high in rat kidney and liver and are undetectable in brain and heart. The cDNA coding region was cloned into a pCMV2 vector and expressed in COS-1 cells. The recombinant microsomal protein catalyzed the NADPH-dependent metabolism of arachidonic acid to a mixture of 5,6-, 8,9-, 11,12-, and 14,15-epoxyeicosatrienoic acids as the only oxygenation products. The enantiofacial selectivity of the recombinant protein was nearly identical with that reported for the kidney microsomal enzyme and generated 8(R),9(S)-, 11(R),12(S)-, and 14(S),15(R) with optical purities of 95, 85, and 75%, respectively. On the basis of mRNA abundance and the close similarities between the regio- and stereochemical selectivity of the recombinant and kidney microsomal proteins, we concluded that cytochrome P-450 2C23 is the predominant enzyme isoform responsible for arachidonic acid epoxidation in the rat kidney."
https://openalex.org/W1504135904,"Molybdopterin, the universal component of the pterin molybdenum cofactors, contains a dithiolene group serving to bind Mo. Addition of the dithiolene sulfurs to a molybdopterin precursor requires the activity of the converting factor. Active converting factor has been purified from Escherichia coli chlA1 cells and found to have two subunits of mass 10 and 16 kDa. Electrophoresis of the purified converting factor on denaturing polyacrylamide gels revealed the presence of a 27-kDa protein as well. Partial NH2-terminal amino acid sequencing showed that the 27-kDa protein is a covalent complex of the 10- and 16-kDa proteins. The inactive converting factor purified from E. coli chlN contains both subunits, as established by amino acid sequencing of the purified material, but the 10-kDa subunit is inactive. Absence of the 27-kDa complex in chlN preparations showed that the inactive covalent complex is only formed from the active converting factor. Evidence that activation of the small subunit requires the acquisition of sulfur was obtained from the difference in the molecular masses of the 10-kDa proteins isolated from chlA1 and chlN cells and from the differential sensitivities of the chlA1 and chlN converting factors to iodoacetamide."

This enzyme, purified to homogeneity from either rabbit reticulocytes or rat pancreas, had similar properties: it migrated with an apparent M(r) of 140,000 by gel filtration, was comprised of a major polypeptide of M(r) 95,000 by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and had a high affinity for CaM (half-maximal activation"
https://openalex.org/W1543358558,"Interleukin-2 (IL-2) controls the proliferation of the murine T cell line B6.1 and induces transferrin receptor (TfR) mRNA steady-state levels 50-fold when added to arrested, IL-2-deprived cells. In addition, TfR mRNA is post-transcriptionally regulated by intracellular iron. Low iron levels activate a cytoplasmic RNA-binding protein, called iron regulatory factor (IRF) or iron-responsive element-binding protein, which coordinately stabilizes TfR mRNA and inhibits ferritin mRNA translation. Since ferritin expression is known to be modulated by cytokines, we decided to investigate the mechanism by which IL-2 activates TfR gene expression in B6.1 cells. Induction by IL-2 of both nuclear and cytoplasmic TfR RNA was compared with run-on transcription rates in isolated nuclei. The results revealed a 3-fold increase in TfR gene transcription and a 6-fold rise in nuclear TfR RNA reaching its steady-state level within 2 h. The main accumulation of mature mRNA in the cytoplasm occurred after 6 h in parallel with the activation of IRF. However, stimulation of IRF binding activity by the iron chelator desferrioxamine, in the absence of IL-2, failed to induce TfR mRNA. Moreover, deprivation of growing B6.1 cells of IL-2 resulted in cell arrest and a rapid decay of TfR mRNA, which was not prevented by the activation of IRF with desferrioxamine. TfR mRNA stabilization appears, therefore, to depend on IL-2. We conclude that TfR mRNA expression is controlled by at least three steps at the onset of cell proliferation: (i) the growth factor-dependent activation of transcription; (ii) mRNA stabilization by IRF in the cytoplasm; and (iii) an additional IL-2-dependent activity which prevents TfR mRNA degradation. Our results indicate that expression of TfR, like ferritin, is controlled by both iron and cytokines."
https://openalex.org/W1581206039,"The increase in cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration that follows mobilization of intracellular Ca2+ stores by inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate Ins(1,4,5)P3 has been reported to modulate the sensitivity of Ins(1,4,5)P3 receptors. We have examined the effects of cytosolic Ca2+ on Ins(1,4,5)P3-stimulated Ca2+ mobilization in permeabilized hepatocytes. Increasing the free Ca2+ concentration in the medium ([Ca2+]m) caused a concentration-dependent increase in the sensitivity of the stores to Ins(1,4,5)P3; the concentration of Ins(1,4,5)P3 that caused half-maximal Ca2+ mobilization (EC50) decreased from 261 +/- 11 nM (n = 3) to 50 +/- 4 nM (n = 8) as [Ca2+]m was increased from approximately 7 nM to 1.6 microM. The EC50 for this effect of Ca2+ was approximately 250 nM. In addition, higher [Ca2+]m (> 600 nM) reduced the extent of Ca2+ release induced by a maximal concentration of Ins(1,4,5)P3; elevating [Ca2+]m to 2.6 microM reduced the proportion of Ca2+ releasable by Ins(1,4,5)P3 by 94 +/- 8% (n = 3). Both effects of Ca2+ were independent of Ca2(+)-stimulated Ins(1,4,5)P3 formation. When elevated [Ca2+]m was returned to control levels, the sensitization of Ins(1,4,5)P3-mediated Ca2+ mobilization reversed completely, whereas the reduction in the size of the Ins(1,4,5)P3-sensitive Ca2+ pool was reversed by only 59 +/- 12% (n = 5) after 20 s and was not further reversed after 100 s. The two distinct effects of Ca2+ on Ins(1,4,5)P3-mediated Ca2+ release combined to control the amount of Ca2+ released by a submaximal concentration of Ins(1,4,5)P3 in a biphasic manner."
https://openalex.org/W1486217288,"The DNA methyltransferase component of the type I restriction and modification enzyme of Escherichia coli K12 has been purified. The active component, a trimer of molecular mass 170 kDa consisting of one DNA recognition subunit (S) and two modification subunits (M), showed the expected preference for modifying a hemimethylated substrate rather than an unmethylated one. Small amounts of the dimers M2 and M1S1 were also isolated. Subunit rearrangements of the three protein species occurred on ion exchange and heparin-agarose chromatography. Denaturation of the trimer gave folding intermediates, and these and the dimer forms isolated during purification may reflect the assembly of the protein in vivo. Enzyme activity was recovered on refolding the denatured protein by dilution of the denaturant. A comparison of the predicted isoelectric points of all known S subunits of type I restriction and modification enzymes revealed values that correlated with the arrangement of type I systems in several families. Electrostatic interactions may explain the different subunit stoichiometries observed during purification of type I enzymes and the differing preferences for hemimethylated DNA displayed by the three type I families."
https://openalex.org/W1574397600,"The species-specific Ca(2+)-dependent reaggregation of dissociated cells of the marine sponge Microciona prolifera is mediated by a large extracellular adhesion proteoglycan. The glycans of this molecule are involved in the interactions of the proteoglycan with itself and with the sponge cells. Monoclonal antibodies against the glycans block the aggregation of sponge cells (Misevic, G. N., Finne, J., and Burger, M. M. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 5870-5877). Proteoglycan oligosaccharides were prepared by partial acid hydrolysis of the isolated glycans, and their reactivity with the monoclonal antibodies was monitored after linkage to phospholipid and immunostaining of thin layer chromatograms. One major antibody-reactive oligosaccharide was detected and purified by ion-exchange chromatography and high performance liquid chromatography. 1H NMR spectroscopy, fast atom bombardment-mass spectrometry, methylation analysis, and sequential chemical and enzymatic degradation studies indicated the structure [formula: see text] for the oligosaccharide. The depyruvylated derivative of the oligosaccharide did not react with the aggregation-blocking antibody, which indicates that the pyruvate acetal is an essential part of the epitope."
https://openalex.org/W2066052765,"Catalytic amino acid residues in a 1,3-beta-D-glucan 3-glucanohydrolase (EC 3.2.1.39) and a homologous 1,3-1,4-beta-D-glucan 4-glucanohydrolase (EC 3.2.1.73) from barley have been investigated. To identify amino acids responsible for protonation of the glycosidic oxygen during hydrolysis, carbodiimide-mediated labeling of the enzymes with [14C]glycine ethyl ester was performed. This resulted in loss of activity and specific modification of the Glu288 residues in both enzymes. The stoichiometry of labeling was approximately 1:1, and modification was reduced in the presence of substrate analogues. Based on these data, the Glu288 residues are likely to be present at the active sites of the respective enzymes and may represent the catalytic acids in the hydrolytic reaction. The catalytic nucleophiles of the two enzymes were investigated by labeling with specific, mechanism-based epoxyalkyl-beta-oligoglucosides. Amino acid residues Glu232 and Glu231 were identified as the likely catalytic nucleophiles in the 1,3-1,4- and 1,3-beta-glucanases, respectively. Thus the position of the catalytic nucleophile and the putative proton donating amino acids in the two classes of beta-glucan endohydrolases are conserved. The acquisition of distinct substrate specificities in the evolution of these related enzymes may therefore not require the recruitment of novel catalytic amino acids but rather differences in their positioning at the active site and/or changes in substrate binding residues."
https://openalex.org/W39444505,"The crystal structure of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 2 protease has been determined in complexes with peptidic inhibitors Noa-His-Cha psi [CH(OH)CH(OH)]Val-Ile-Amp (U75875) and Qnc-Asn-Cha psi [CH(OH)CH2]Val-Npt(U92163) (where Noa is naphthyloxyacetyl, Cha is cyclohexylalanine, Amp is 2-aminomethylpyridine, Qnc is quinoline-2-carbonyl, and Npt is neopentylamine), which have dihydroxyethylene and hydroxyethylene moieties, respectively, in place of the normal scissile bond of the natural ligand. The complexes crystallize in space group P2(1)2(1)2(1), with one dimer-inhibitor complex per asymmetric unit and average cell dimensions of a = 33.28 A, b = 45.35 A, c = 135.84 A. Data were collected to approximately 2.5-A resolution. The model structures were refined with resulting R-factors of around 0.19. As expected, the HIV-2 protease structure is approximately C2-symmetric with a gross structure very similar to that of the HIV-1 enzyme. The inhibitors bind in an extended conformation positioned lengthwise in the binding cleft in a manner similar to that found in the HIV-1 protease-inhibitor complexes previously reported. The substitution of the bulkier Ile82 side chain in the HIV-2 protease may help explain the better ability of HIV-2 protease to bind and hydrolyze ligands with small P1 and P1' side groups. It appears that differences in specificity between the proteases of HIV-1 and HIV-2 are not merely a result of simple side chain substitutions, but may be complicated by differences in main chain flexibility as well."
https://openalex.org/W2166506332,"The aim of this work was to study whether changes in fructose 2,6-bisphosphate concentration are correlated with variations of the glycolytic flux in the isolated working rat heart. Glycolysis was stimulated to different extents by increasing the concentration of glucose, increasing the workload, or by the addition of insulin. The glycolytic flux was measured by the rate of detritiation of [2-3H]- and [3-3H]glucose. Under all the conditions tested, an increase in fructose 2,6-bisphosphate content was observed. The glucose- or insulin-induced increase in fructose 2,6-bisphosphate content was related to an increase in the concentration of fructose 6-phosphate, the substrate of 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase. An increase in the workload correlated with a 50% decrease in the Km of 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase for fructose 6-phosphate. Similar changes in Km have been observed when purified heart 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase was phosphorylated in vitro by the cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase or by the calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase. Since the concentration of cyclic AMP was not affected by increasing the workload, it is possible that the change in Km of 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase, which was found in hearts submitted to a high load, resulted from phosphorylation by calcium/calmodulin protein kinase; other possibilities are not excluded. Anoxia decreased the external work developed by the heart, stimulated glycolysis and glycogenolysis, but did not increase fructose 2,6-bisphosphate."
https://openalex.org/W1597272291,"CheY, the 14-kDa response regulator protein of the Escherichia coli chemotaxis pathway, is activated by phosphorylation of Asp57. In order to probe the structural changes associated with activation, an approach which combines 19F NMR, protein engineering, and the known crystal structure of one conformer has been utilized. This first of two papers examines the effects of Mg(II) binding and phosphorylation on the conformation of CheY. The molecule was selectively labeled at its six phenylalanine positions by incorporation of 4-fluorophenylalanine, which yielded no significant effect on activity. One of these 19F probe positions monitored the vicinity of Lys109, which forms a salt bridge to Asp57 in the apoprotein and has been proposed to act as a structural switch in activation. 19F NMR chemical shift studies of the labeled protein revealed that the binding of the cofactor Mg(II) triggered local structural changes in the activation site, but did not perturb the probe of the Lys109 region. The structural changes associated with phosphorylation were then examined, utilizing acetyl phosphate to chemically generate phsopho-CheY during NMR acquisition. Phosphorylation triggered a long-range conformational change extending from the activation site to a cluster of 4 phenylalanine residues at the other end of the molecule. However, phosphorylation did not perturb the probe of Lys109. The observed phosphorylated conformer is proposed to be the first step in the activation of CheY; later steps appear to perturb Lys109, as evidenced in the following paper. Together these results may give insight into the activation of other prokaryotic response regulators."
https://openalex.org/W1577233448,"The giant extracellular hemoglobin of the earthworm, Lumbricus terrestris, has four major O2-binding chains, a, b, and c (forming a disulfide-linked trimer) and d (monomer). Participation of additional chains L1, L2, and L3 is necessary for the assembly of the approximately 3,900+ kDa two-tiered hexagonal structure. We have determined the proportions of linker chains, trimer, and chain d in the hemoglobin by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography which resolves all of the components and also permits simultaneous determination of the heme content. The proportions of components were determined by two independent procedures: integration of the absorbance peaks at 220 nm and amino acid analysis of the peak fractions. The results indicate that the weight proportion of linker chains is 0.163 +/- 0.023. This value, together with molecular masses determined both by amino acid sequence analysis and by matrix-assisted laser desorption mass spectrometry, gives a molar ratio of abcd chains to linkers of 8:1, corresponding to the minimal unit (abcd)2.L. This ratio suggests that 24 (abcd)2 units and 24 linker chains form the complete structure with a total calculated mass of polypeptide of 3,975 kDa with hemes on chains a, b, c and d and on one linker. The calculated heme content is 3.1% not including carbohydrate. This accounts for a measured heme content of 3.0% on a polypeptide basis. Additional mass (approximately 133 kDa, 3.4%), attributed to carbohydrate, brings the total mass to 4,108 kDa with a minimum molecular mass/heme of 20,500 Da. The presence of equimolar quantities of three unique linker chains means that the apparent one-twelfth structural units seen by electron microscopy cannot all be identical."
https://openalex.org/W1598844032,"Incubation of cytosolic extracts of bovine brain with S-adenosyl[methyl-3H]methionine results in the predominant [3H]methyl esterification of a 36-kDa polypeptide. This reaction appears to be distinct from any of the three known types of protein carboxyl methylation reactions previously established. We show here that the methylated 36-kDa polypeptide is a component of a cytosolic protein with a native molecular mass estimated at 178 kDa by gel filtration chromatography. The methyl group is not stable on the protein and is lost as [3H]methanol with a half-life of about 180 min at pH 7.0, 37 degrees C. The methyltransferase responsible for this reaction is a cytosolic protein with a native molecular mass of about 40 kDa that is readily separated from the well described protein-L-isoaspartate (D-aspartate) O-methyltransferase (EC 2.1.1.77). The methyl ester linkage is cleaved by carboxypeptidase Y, suggesting that the 36-kDa polypeptide is methylated on its C-terminal carboxyl group. Extensive digestion of gel-purified 3H-methylated 36-kDa polypeptide with trypsin and leucine aminopeptidase results in a radioactive product that co-chromatographs with authentic L-leucine methyl ester in reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), thin layer chromatography, thin layer electrophoresis, and high resolution-sulfonated polystyrene cation-exchange chromatography. Additionally, the o-phthalaldehyde/beta-mercaptoethanol-derived isoindole derivative of the 3H digestion product co-migrates on HPLC with the corresponding isoindole for L-leucine methyl ester. We demonstrate that a similar methylation system is present in yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae but not in the bacterium Escherichia coli. These results provide evidence for a new type of reversible posttranslational modification reaction that may function to modulate the activities of its methyl-accepting substrates."
https://openalex.org/W1611469980,"A Caenorhabditis elegans cDNA encoding a homologue of the p21 ras-related CDC42, designated as CDC42Ce, was isolated from a nematode mixed stage cDNA library. The encoded protein of 188 amino acid residues has 85% identity to both human G25K and CDC42Hs and 79 and 76% identity to the yeast CDC42Sp and CDC42Sc proteins, respectively. The CDC42Ce cDNA maps to a position on C. elegans chromosome II in close proximity to lin-26, a cell lineage gene. The CDC42Ce cDNA hybridizes to 2- and 1.5-kilobase mRNAs. Their expression is developmentally regulated with highest levels at the embryonic stage, decreasing progressively during development except for an increase of the more abundant 1.5-kilobase mRNA at the L3 stage. The glutathione S-transferase/CDC42Ce fusion protein expressed in Escherichia coli displays both GTP binding and intrinsic GTPase activities. The GTPase activity of CDC42Ce is moderately stimulated by human n-chimaerin, a GTPase-activating protein for the related p21 rac1. The CDC42Ce protein complements the temperature-sensitive lethal mutation cdc42-1 in yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. These data suggest that CDC42Ce is the C. elegans homologue of the yeast CDC42. The developmental expression pattern of mRNA and is biochemical properties of its encoded protein which are closely related to CErac1 suggest that the two p21s might be involved in related biological processes."

C. (1992) Biochemistry 31, 5791-5798), the catalytic site saturation producing quenching of Trp-257 fluorescence (Divita, G., Jault, J.-M., Gautheron, D. C., and Di Pietro, A. (1993) Biochemistry 32, 1017-1024). The present results indicate that two types of fluorescent nucleotide analogues, bearing either 2'(3')N-methylanthraniloyl (mant) or 2',3'-O-(2,4,6-trinitrophenyl) (TNP) group, exhibit high-affinity binding and behave similarly to the corresponding unmodified nucleotides. Selective binding of mant GDP to the catalytic site produces a marked quenching of intrinsic fluorescence which is due to resonance energy transfer between Trp-257 and the mant group. The high efficiency of the transfer allows the determination of a short distance, 10.5 A, indicating the close proximity of catalytic site and alpha-subunit Trp-257. Selective saturation of the noncatalytic site by TNP-ADP produces a marked quenching of the extrinsic fluorescence of mant GDP bound to the catalytic site, which is correlated to an important resonance energy transfer between the two fluorescent groups. A rather short distance of 17.5 A is calculated, indicating vicinity of catalytic and noncatalytic sites."
https://openalex.org/W1491925978,"The structural and functional relationships of the intracellular portion of mouse interleukin 1 receptor (muIL-1R) type I were examined with regard to activation of the human IL-8 gene in the Jurkat T cell line. C-terminal deletion mutations of muIL-1R revealed that the C-terminal boundary for receptor function is localized between 28 and 42 amino acids from the C-terminal end. The internal deletion mutants between amino acids 364 and 474 had a loss of activity, demonstrating the requirement for a large region of the mIL-1R cytoplasmic portion for receptor function. Amino acid substitution revealed that the putative nuclear localization elements (amino acids at 429-433, 523-527, and 507-519) and putative protein kinase C or A acceptor sites (Ser-431, Ser-509, Ser-528) do not participate in IL-1 signaling to induce IL-8 gene expression. A truncated mutation within the segment, which possesses homology with gp130, beta chain of IL-6R, or a point mutation of box 1- and box 2-like elements within the gp130 homologous segment, abolished the capacity to induce IL-8 gene expression, suggesting similar structural requirements in the cytoplasmic portion of several cytokine receptors."
https://openalex.org/W1569606796,"Abstract The extracellular hemoglobins (Hbs) of annelids and tube worms are giant multisubunit proteins of up to approximately 200 polypeptides and molecular masses to at least 3,900 kDa. They differ from all other Hbs in having both O2-binding chains and chains. The latter are required for assembly and structural integrity of the protein and are deficient in or lack heme. We have determined the nucleotide sequences of the cDNA and gene for linker chain L1 of the hemoglobin of Lumbricus terrestris. The cDNA-derived amino acid sequence has 225 residues and a calculated molecular mass of 25,847 Da. The chain is 21-28% identical to linker chains of the related annelid Tylorrhynchus heterochaetus and the deep-sea tube worm Lamellibrachia sp. A remarkable feature of the linker chains is a conserved 38-39-residue segment that contains a repeating pattern of cysteinyl residues: (Cys-X6)3-Cys-X5-Cys-X10-Cys. This pattern, not present in any globin sequence, corresponds exactly to the cysteine-rich repeats of the ligand binding domains of the low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors of man and Xenopus laevis. Furthermore, the cysteine-rich segment of linker chain L1 has the sequence Asp-Gly-Ser-Asp-Glu which is characteristic of LDL receptor repeats. Similar cysteine-rich sequences also occur in two other mammalian proteins, complement C9 and renal glycoprotein GP330. The results support the conclusion that the cysteine-rich motif of the LDL receptor and annelid Hbs is a multipurpose protein-binding unit of ancient origin which has been incorporated into diverse unrelated proteins, presumably by the process of exon shuffling."
https://openalex.org/W1593584450,"We have isolated a rat cDNA whose expression suppresses the physiological consequences of the chromosomal disruption of CAP, the gene encoding the adenylyl cyclase-associated protein of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Yeast CAP is a bifunctional protein: the NH2 terminus is necessary and sufficient for cellular responsiveness to activated RAS proteins, while the COOH terminus is required for normal cellular morphology and growth control. The rat MCH1 cDNA encodes a protein of 474 amino acids that is 36% identical to S. cerevisiae CAP and is capable of suppressing the loss of the COOH-terminal functions of CAP when expressed in yeast. The MCH1 protein therefore appears to be a structural and functional homolog of the yeast cyclase-associated proteins. Northern analysis of MCH1 gene expression shows it to be constitutively expressed in all cell and tissue types examined. The cloning of a rat homolog of CAP, in addition to the cloning of a human CAP homolog by Matviw et al. (Matviw, H., Yu, G., and Young, D. (1992) Mol. Cell. Biol. 12, 5033-5040), demonstrates that both cyclase-associated proteins and their functions may have evolved with mammalian cells."
https://openalex.org/W1580401295,"The specificity of Man-P-Dol:Man5-8GlcNAc2-P-P-Dol (Oligo-P-P-Dol) mannosyltransferase activity in pig brain was investigated by comparing a variety of mannosylphosphorylisoprenols as mannosyl donors. For this comparison the beta-Man-P-isoprenols were synthesized using a partially purified preparation of mannosylphosphorylundecaprenol (Man-P-Undec) synthase from Micrococcus luteus. The bacterial mannosyltransferase efficiently catalyzed the transfer of mannose from GDP-[3H]Man to a series of defined isoprenyl monophosphate substrates. Two alpha-Man-P-dolichols were synthesized chemically and also examined as substrates. When exogenous beta-[3H]Man-P-Dol95 was tested as a substrate for Man-P-Dol:Oligo-P-P-Dol mannosyltransferase activity in pig brain microsomes, [3H]mannose was actively transferred to endogenous Oligo-P-P-Dol acceptors. The major enzymatically labeled product was Man9GlcNAc2-P-P-Dol. Under identical conditions beta-[3H]mannosylphosphorylpolyprenol (Man-P-Poly95) was an extremely poor substrate, indicating that the saturated alpha-isoprene unit of the dolichyl moiety is critical for recognition of the lipophilic mannosyl donor by the endoplasmic reticulum-associated mannosyltransferase(s). When Man-P-dolichols containing 2, 11, or 19 isoprene units were compared, the initial rates for the mannosyl transfer reactions and the affinity of the enzyme(s) for the mannophospholipid substrate increased with the length and hydrophobicity of the polyisoprenol chain. The anomeric configuration of the mannosyl moiety is apparently essential because the brain mannosyltransferases exhibited a strong preference for beta-Man-P-dolichols over the corresponding chemically synthesized alpha-stereoisomers. These results: 1) describe a simple two-step procedure for obtaining a partially purified preparation of Man-P-Undec synthase that efficiently synthesizes a variety of beta-Man-P-isoprenols; 2) indicate that pig brain Man-P-Dol:Oligo-P-P-Dol mannosyltransferase activity is relatively specific for lipophilic mannosyl donors containing 19 isoprene units with a beta-Man 1-P group attached to the saturated alpha-isoprene unit of dolichol; and 3) emphasize the importance of the reduction of the alpha-isoprene unit in the biosynthesis and function of Dol-P in mammalian cells."
https://openalex.org/W1593237546,"Post-insulin receptor signal transduction is mediated by a cascade of seryl/threonyl protein kinases which includes a family of mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases, ribosomal protein S6 kinases, and casein kinase-2. Previous studies have characterized these kinases primarily in cultured or isolated cells. We have demonstrated that intravenous injection of insulin into fasted rats significantly stimulated the activities of MAP kinases and S6 kinases in skeletal muscle, independently of the blood glucose levels in these animals. Anion exchange chromatography on Mono Q afforded the resolution of at least five peaks of insulin-stimulated myelin basic protein kinase activity. By immunological criteria, these myelin basic protein kinases included the p42mapk and p44erk1 as well as other potentially novel 44-kDa MAP kinases. Insulin-activated ribosomal S6 kinases were resolved into two major peaks by Mono Q chromatography, the latter of which contained a 100-kDa isoform of p90rsk as revealed by immunoblotting with an anti-rsk-peptide antibody. A 32-kDa S6 kinase in the earlier peak may represent a novel protein kinase in this tissue. Skeletal muscle casein kinase-2 was not significantly stimulated following insulin injection into rats under our experimental conditions. These results indicate that the intact rat can serve as a useful model system to investigate the mechanisms of insulin signal transduction."

High expression yield was obtained only with the derivative that lacked both the third Kunitz domain and the penultimate COOH tail (TFPI1-161). The purified short form was heterogeneously glycosylated with a high mannose glycan. The specific activities of the different mutant polypeptides toward FXa.tissue factor.FVIIa in a chromogenic assay were similar to that of TFPI expressed in baby hamster kidney cells, suggesting that correct folding takes place in yeast and that neither the third Kunitz domain nor the COOH-terminal region is required for this activity. However, in a clotting assay the anticoagulant activities of yeast-produced TFPI and the shortened derivative TFPI1-161 were about 5- and 50-fold lower, respectively, than for full-length TFPI from mammalian cells. Clotting assays with purified short form TFPI showed that it acted mainly via inhibition of FVIIa.tissue factor rather than FXa. The anticoagulant activity of short form TFPI was comparable with that of high affinity antibodies toward tissue factor."

One member of the family has been purified by a combination of two-dimensional electrophoresis and reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography and identified by amino acid sequence analysis as stathmin.

https://openalex.org/W1519498902,"Migration of medial smooth muscle cells (SMC) into the intima is a key step in intimal thickening of atherosclerotic tissues. We previously reported that cultured SMC secrete a potent migration factor for SMC, named SMC-derived migration factor (SDMF). We purified this factor to homogeneity from 20 liters of serum-free conditioned medium of cultured rat aortic SMC by sequential heparin-Sepharose column, red-Sepharose column, TSK-heparin high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) column, and Superose 6 HPLC column chromatographies. SDMF was found to be a 58-kDa polypeptide by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Reduction by mercaptoethanol caused only a slight decrease in its molecular mass to 53 kDa. Preparative isoelectric focusing revealed that SDMF is a basic protein with a pI of approximately 10. Purified SDMF enhanced the migration of rat SMC dose dependently, its maximal activity being 4 times that of platelet-derived growth factor-BB. In contrast, SDMF did not enhance the migration of endothelial cells from either human umbilical cord vein or rabbit retinal tissue. SDMF had no effect on the proliferation of SMC. These findings suggest that SDMF enhances SMC migration in vascular walls and that the autocrine system of SMC migration contributes to the formation of intimal thickening in atheroma formation."
https://openalex.org/W1590744420,"Abstract Using solubilized dystrophin isolated from torpedo electric tissue and in vitro blot overlay assay, we have identified dystrophin-binding proteins in membranes from Torpedo electrocyte and rat muscle. In acetylcholine receptor-rich membranes from Torpedo marmorata electric tissue, an extrinsic protein of M(r) 52,000, known as the 58-kDa protein (Froehner, S.C. (1984) J. Cell Biol. 99, 88-96), represents the major binding site for dystrophin. When membranes were solubilized by non-ionic detergents, the 52-kDa protein as well as a few proteins of M(r) 200,000, 87,000, and 45,000 co-extract and copurify with dystrophin. In rat sarcolemma, a protein doublet of approximately 58-60 kDa also binds dystrophin in vitro, this protein likely being the DAP 59 characterized by Ervasti and Campbell (Ervasti, J. M., and Campbell, K. P. (1991) Cell 66, 1121-1131). We postulate that the 52- and 59-kDa proteins are functional homologs that play the role of receptors for dystrophin in various specialized membrane domains."
https://openalex.org/W1489315177,"Histone acetyltransferase B from pea embryonic axes has been purified approximately 300-fold by a combination of chromatographic procedures, including affinity chromatography on histone-agarose. The enzyme preparation has been used for the in vitro transfer of acetyl groups from [1-14C]acetyl-CoA to non-acetylated pea histone H4. Up to three acetyl groups can be introduced into the histone. The resulting mono-, di-, and triacetylated H4 isoforms were separated and sequenced to determine the acetylated sites. Only sites 5, 12, and 16 were used by histone acetyltransferase B, but no clear preference among them was observed. The absence of modification of other potentially acetylatable sites is another indication that acetylation of the different lysine residues in the N-terminal H4 tail serves as a specific signal in different nuclear processes."
https://openalex.org/W1531889361,"Abstract The transcriptional induction of the chicken ovalbumin gene by steroid hormones is abolished by inhibitors of protein synthesis such as cycloheximide, suggesting that a labile protein mediates this process. A steroid-dependent regulatory element (SDRE) has been identified in the 5'-flanking region of the gene between -900 and -780 that is required for induction by steroids. Additional transfection experiments limit the 5'-border of the SDRE to the region between -892 and -864. To investigate whether any of the proteins binding to the SDRE are affected by estrogen or cycloheximide, protein binding was investigated using DNase I and exonuclease III footprinting and gel mobility shift assays. These experiments demonstrate that labile proteins bind to the sequences between -900 and -860 and between -810 and -820. Four oviduct nuclear proteins, including one of the labile proteins, binding to the SDRE prefer single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) in a sequence-specific manner. The binding activity of three of these ssDNA-binding proteins is increased in oviduct nuclear protein extracts from estrogen-treated chicks. These data suggest that induction of the ovalbumin gene is mediated by a complex collection of ssDNA- and double-stranded DNA-binding proteins whose activities are in turn regulated by their short half-lives or by estrogen."
https://openalex.org/W111732637,"The processing of two homologous precursors, pro-neuropeptide Y (pro-NPY) and pro-pancreatic poly-peptide (pro-PP), was studied in four neuroendocrine cell lines after transfection: CA-77 medullary thyroid carcinoma cells, AtT-20 corticotrope pituitary cells, RIN2A-19 pancreatic endocrine cells, and NB1 neuroblastoma cells. Northern blot analysis indicated that the AtT-20 cells only expressed precursor convertase 3; in contrast, NB1 cells only expressed precursor convertase 2, whereas the RIN2A-19 and CA-77 cells expressed both enzymes. Despite these differences in expression pattern of precursor convertases the four cell lines were, surprisingly, indistinguishable in respect to their processing of pro-PP and pro-NPY. In all four cell lines, pro-NPY was almost completely converted to NPY, and, in all four cell lines, only around 50% of the PP precursor was converted to PP. The relatively poor processing efficiency of pro-PP was rather similar to the processing efficiency of the endogenously produced precursors in the respective cell lines, pro-calcitonin (CA-77), proopiomelanocortin (AtT-20), proinsulin (RIN2A-19), and pro-vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (NB1). At least in the CA-77 cells, NPY and PP were apparently sorted to the regulated secretory pathway, as upon stimulation with secretagogue the release of the transfected peptides increased in parallel with the endogenously expressed peptide, calcitonin gene-related peptide. Mutagenesis studies showed that on the N-terminal side of the di-basic processing site, the otherwise important difference in structure between PP and NPY, a proline for glutamine in position 34, was not responsible for the difference in processing efficiency. On the C-terminal side of the processing site, the efficient processing of pro-NPY could not be transferred to pro-PP by exchanging the whole C-terminal domains of the precursors. It is concluded that pro-NPY is processed more efficiently than pro-PP in all neuroendocrine cell lines tested independent on their expression of the two main precursor convertases and that mutagenesis data indicate that the structural element responsible for the efficient processing of pro-NPY is not located on the N-terminal side of the dibasic processing site."

It was established in previous studies that this protein binds ATP, that the TyrR.ATP complex has enhanced affinity for tyrosine, and that the susceptibility of the TyrR protein to hydrolysis by trypsin is altered by ATP. Here we show that the TyrR protein has ATPase activity, which is stimulated by tyrosine. In this respect the TyrR protein resembles the transcriptional activator NtrC. The NtrC protein contains an internal polypeptide segment, 220 amino acid residues in length, with a high degree of identity to the TyrR protein, that contains the presumptive ATPase catalytic center."

R., and Kaguni, J. M. (1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 13137-13142). The effect of these heat shock proteins on DnaA5 and DnaA46 protein was separated from the event of DNA synthesis by incubation in two stages. Components necessary during the first stage for included GrpE and DnaK proteins, ATP at 0.2 mM or greater, and polyvinyl alcohol (8%) or glycerol, optimal at concentrations between 20 and 30%. An ATP regenerating system provided by creatine kinase and creatine phosphate was stimulatory. Addition of the activated form of DnaA5 or DnaA46 protein to a reconstituted system containing other purified replication proteins during the second stage of incubation resulted in DNA replication. Activation of DnaA5 or DnaA46 protein by heat shock proteins was thermolabile, suggesting that the temperature sensitivity of dnaA5 and dnaA46 mutants is related to this thermolabile interaction. A third heat shock protein, DnaJ protein, interfered with the activation of DnaA5 protein if present during the first stage of incubation. This inhibitory effect was less striking if included during the second stage of incubation. These results suggest a mechanism for regulation of the activity of DnaA protein."

Their structures suggested that they were closely related in their metabolism: their sugar chains were in sequence and their ceramide moieties were similarly composed, namely C16:0 and C24:1 constituted most of the fatty acids, and long-chain base components were mostly C18-dihydrosphingosine with a small portion of C18-sphingosine. The sugar chains implied two pathways branching from lactosylceramide: one to globotriaosylceramide and the other to lactotriaosylceramide, which leads to the production of Le(x) glycolipid via neolacto type 2 core chain."

J., Brockman, H. L., and Hui, D. Y. (1989) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 1005, 177-182). The rat hepatoma cell line Fu5AH, which lacks this particular CEH activity, was stably transfected with the cDNA of rat pancreatic CEH, and the effects on cholesterol and cholesteryl ester metabolism in clones with varying levels of CEH expression determined. In spite of significant amounts of intracellular enzyme protein demonstrated by Western blotting, in cell lysates there was a consistently low level of catalytic activity, and in cultured cells there was no evidence that CEH served as an effective intracellular cholesteryl ester hydrolase or synthase. In contrast, the catalytic activity of the secreted enzyme was relatively higher and there was a small, but significant, increase in the ability of high density lipoprotein (added to the medium) to promote the clearance of cholesteryl ester from cells secreting high levels of CEH. Overall, these results suggest that in the liver, intracellular CEH does not significantly affect the turnover of cholesteryl esters and warrant future studies focusing on the function of the secreted enzyme. For example, secreted CEH may modify lipoproteins and affect their interactions with cells."

Initial probing of the structure of newly synthesized SL RNA by deoxyoligonucleotide-directed ribonuclease (RNase) H cleavage revealed three accessible regions: the 5' end, sequences downstream of the 5' splice site, and a putative single-stranded sequence between stem-loops II and III, which is thought to be analogous to the mammalian Sm-binding site of U small nuclear RNAs. Using antisense 2'-O-methyl RNA oligomers, two functional elements of the SL RNA became apparent. Masking of positions 1-18 inhibited modification of the cap 4 structure of newly synthesized SL RNA and, thereby, blocked utilization of the SL RNA in trans-splicing. In addition, nucleotides +1 to +4 relative to the 5' splice site, which include the invariant GU dinucleotide were accessible to oligomer binding in the SL ribonucleoprotein particle, and their blockade resulted in complete inhibition of trans-splicing. In contrast, RNA oligomer binding to the single-stranded region between stem-loop II and III of the SL RNA had no detectable effect on trans-splicing activity of the SL RNA."
https://openalex.org/W1520048836,"Ribulose-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco) from higher plants consists of eight approximately 53-kDa large subunits and eight approximately 14-kDa small subunits. Cytosolic ribosomes synthesize the small subunits as precursors, which enter the chloroplast, undergo proteolytic processing, and assemble with large subunits. Large subunits, synthesized in the chloroplast, first form a complex with the chloroplast chaperonin 60 (Cpn60(14)). In the presence of ATP, large subunits dissociate from Cpn60(14) and assemble into Rubisco. We now describe partial characterization of a new species, Z, containing radiotracer-labeled, newly synthesized pea Rubisco large subunits. Rubisco assembly occurs in low salt in the presence of small subunits and ATP. As with Rubisco assembly, the formation of Z is ATP-dependent and is inhibited by high chloride. Once formed, Z is stable except in high chloride. Z does not appear to interact directly with small subunits. However, after Z formation, Rubisco assembly occurs in an ATP-independent reaction that requires KCl and small subunits. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that Z is a large subunit containing structure that can contribute large subunits to Rubisco under appropriate conditions. Z shares some physical characteristics with reported cyanobacterial L8 core particles. However, formation of Rubisco from Z in the absence of ATP and the presence of small subunits appears to require conditions that otherwise destabilize Z."

To localize the three intrachain disulfide bonds in PDGF, a method was devised that made it possible to cleave PDGF at specific sites. A set of PDGF derivatives in which specific amino acids were mutated to methionine residues was generated. The recombinant proteins, immunoprecipitated from metabolically labeled transfected COS cells, were then subjected to CNBr cleavage and analyzed by SDS-gel electrophoresis under nonreducing conditions. Based on whether the mutated proteins remained in one piece or fell apart after CNBr cleavage, it was possible to deduce the disulfide bond arrangement in the PDGF B-chain; one bond involves the 1st and 6th cysteine residues, another the 3rd and 7th, and the last the 5th and 8th. The latter disulfide bond was found to be dispensable for receptor binding, whereas the former two were found to be essential for the correct folding or stability of the PDGF B-chain."
https://openalex.org/W191035121,"Glycogen synthase catalyzes the transfer of the glucosyl moiety from UDP-glucose to the terminal branch of the glycogen molecule and is considered to be the rate-limiting enzyme for glycogen synthesis. However, under ideal assay conditions, i.e. 37 degrees C with saturating concentrations of UDP-glucose and the activator, glucose-6-P, the maximal catalytic activity of glycogen synthase was only 78% of the in vivo glycogen synthetic rate. Using concentrations of UDP-glucose and glucose-6-P likely to be present in vivo, the rate was only approximately 30%. This prompted us to reassess a possible role of allosteric effectors on synthase activity. Glycogen synthase was assayed at 37 degrees C using dilute, pH 7.0, buffered extracts, initial rate conditions, and UDP-glucose and glucose-6-P concentrations, which approximate those calculated to be present in total liver cell water. Several allosteric effectors were tested. Magnesium and AMP had little effect on activity. Pi, ADP, ATP, and UTP inhibited activity. When a combination of effectors were added at concentrations approximating those present in cell water, synthase activity could account for only 2% of the glycogen synthetic rate. Thus, although allosteric effectors are likely to be playing a major role in regulating synthase enzymic activity in liver cells, to date, a metabolite that can stimulate activity and/or overcome nucleotide inhibition has yet to be identified. If such a metabolite cannot be identified, an additional or alternative pathway for glycogen synthesis must be considered."

Under the experimental conditions employed, the binary G-acto-S1A2 complex does not polymerize (Chaussepied, P., and Kasprzak, A. A. (1989) Nature 342, 950-953). The released nucleotide was hydrolyzed either by alkaline phosphatase or by apyrase; to trap Ca2+, EDTA was used. From the anisotropy of N-iodoacetyl-N'-(5-sulfo-1- naphthyl)ethylenediamine (1,5-IAEDANS)-actin, it was established that during the dissociation of epsilon ATP, the G-acto-S1 complex remained stable and the equilibrium of the system was unaltered. The reactions followed first order kinetics. The dissociation rate constant, kd for epsilon ATP decreased from 5.5 x 10(-4) s-1 for free G-actin to 1 x 10(-4) s-1 for G-acto-S1A2; for Ca2+, kd was also similarly reduced from 2.8 x 10(-2) s-1 to 4 x 10(-3) s-1. Two proteolytically derived actin variants were also examined. For free subtilisin-cleaved actin, kd for epsilon ATP was elevated 2-fold but was almost unchanged for Ca2+. In the complex of the cleaved G-actin with S1A2, kd for both epsilon ATP and for Ca2+ were reduced. The removal of the last 3 amino acids from actin produced a derivative whose behavior in binding to S1, as well as in the kinetics of epsilon ATP and Ca2+ dissociation, was undistinguishable from the unmodified protein."

Stable binding of both the U2-specific 40-kDa and the common proteins requires only the 3'-terminal domain (stem-loop IIb, single-stranded region, and stem-loop IV), with loop IV providing the critical sequence determinant; stem-loop IV suffices for binding of the 40 kDa-protein, but not of the common proteins; surprisingly, the sequence of the Sm-analogous single-stranded region between stem-loops IIb and IV is not essential for protein binding. Our mutational analysis further indicates that interactions between common and specific proteins play an important role in the assembly of a stable core complex. Finally, a partially assembled U2 RNP complex could be identified as a kinetic intermediate of U2 snRNP assembly. We propose a model of the domain structure and assembly of the trans-spliceosomal U2 snRNP, which deviates in several aspects from that of the cis-spliceosomal U2 snRNP; these differences may be related to the trans-splicing-specific functions of the trypanosomal U2 snRNP."
https://openalex.org/W969228574,"Affinity labels for proteins that process other proteins (e.g. proteinases and protein kinases) are an amalgam of two components, an active site-directed peptide carrier and a non-peptidic electrophilic appendage. We have synthesized several affinity labels for the cAMP-dependent protein kinase that are composed solely of L-amino acids and therefore contain only functionality present in naturally occurring proteins. We have found that 2 adjacent cysteine residues, when covalently linked via a peptide bond and an intramolecular disulfide loop (abbreviated as Cys Cys), serves as a potent electrophile. The peptides Leu-Arg-Arg-Cys Cys-Leu-Gly (1), Leu-Arg-Arg-Ala-Cys Cys-Gly (2), and Leu-Arg-Arg-Ala-Ala-Cys Cys-Gly (3) inactivate the cAMP-dependent protein kinase in a time-dependent fashion. Since dialysis does not restore activity, but dithiothreitol does, this strongly suggests that covalent modification of the target enzyme has occurred at a cysteine residue. Although there are 2 cysteine moieties contained within the protein kinase, the 14C-acetylated affinity labels modify the enzyme only once. In addition, since ATP blocks inactivation of the protein kinase, this implies that it is the active site cysteine residue (Cys-199) that has undergone covalent modification. Based on the KI(inact) values obtained from inactivation kinetics, we conclude that the optimal site on the affinity label for the electrophilic Cys Cys is 1 amino acid removed from the 2 arginine residues (i.e. 2). In addition, the efficacy of these inhibitors is also dependent upon the size of the disulfide ring. The eight-membered disulfide ring-containing peptides 1-3 are relatively poor affinity labels compared to the 12-membered ring-containing inhibitor, [formula: see text]"
