https://openalex.org/W2090139505,"Accumulation of β-amyloid (Aβ) deposits is a primary pathological feature of Alzheimer disease that is correlated with neurotoxicity and cognitive decline. The role of glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) in Alzheimer disease pathogenesis has been debated. To study the role of GSK-3 in Aβ pathology, we used 5XFAD mice co-expressing mutated amyloid precursor protein and presenilin-1 that develop massive cerebral Aβ loads. Both GSK-3 isozymes (α/β) were hyperactive in this model. Nasal treatment of 5XFAD mice with a novel substrate competitive GSK-3 inhibitor, L803-mts, reduced Aβ deposits and ameliorated cognitive deficits. Analyses of 5XFAD hemi-brain samples indicated that L803-mts restored the activity of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and inhibited autophagy. Lysosomal acidification was impaired in the 5XFAD brains as indicated by reduced cathepsin D activity and decreased N-glycoyslation of the vacuolar ATPase subunit V0a1, a modification required for lysosomal acidification. Treatment with L803-mts restored lysosomal acidification in 5XFAD brains. Studies in SH-SY5Y cells confirmed that GSK-3α and GSK-3β impair lysosomal acidification and that treatment with L803-mts enhanced the acidic lysosomal pool as demonstrated in LysoTracker Red-stained cells. Furthermore, L803-mts restored impaired lysosomal acidification caused by dysfunctional presenilin-1. We provide evidence that mTOR is a target activated by GSK-3 but inhibited by impaired lysosomal acidification and elevation in amyloid precursor protein/Aβ loads. Taken together, our data indicate that GSK-3 is a player in Aβ pathology. Inhibition of GSK-3 restores lysosomal acidification that in turn enables clearance of Aβ burdens and reactivation of mTOR. These changes facilitate amelioration in cognitive function."
https://openalex.org/W1980916535,"The neural crest (NC) is a major contributor to the vertebrate craniofacial skeleton, detailed in model organisms through embryological and genetic approaches, most notably in chick and mouse. Despite many similarities between these rather distant species, there are also distinct differences in the contribution of the NC, particularly to the calvariae of the skull. Lack of information about other vertebrate groups precludes an understanding of the evolutionary significance of these differences. Study of zebrafish craniofacial development has contributed substantially to understanding of cartilage and bone formation in teleosts, but there is currently little information on NC contribution to the zebrafish skeleton. Here, we employ a two-transgene system based on Cre recombinase to genetically label NC in the zebrafish. We demonstrate NC contribution to cells in the cranial ganglia and peripheral nervous system known to be NC-derived, as well as to a subset of myocardial cells. The indelible labeling also enables us to determine NC contribution to late-forming bones, including the calvariae. We confirm suspected NC origin of cartilage and bones of the viscerocranium, including cartilages such as the hyosymplectic and its replacement bones (hymandibula and symplectic) and membranous bones such as the opercle. The cleithrum develops at the border of NC and mesoderm, and as an ancestral component of the pectoral girdle was predicted to be a hybrid bone composed of both NC and mesoderm tissues. However, we find no evidence of a NC contribution to the cleithrum. Similarly, in the vault of the skull, the parietal bones and the caudal portion of the frontal bones show no evidence of NC contribution. We also determine a NC origin for caudal fin lepidotrichia; the presumption is that these are derived from trunk NC, demonstrating that these cells have the ability to form bone during normal vertebrate development."

It also demonstrates that this bias is rooted in perceptions of status and the privilege (or hardship) status confers, not race per se. Archival data from the National Football League injury reports reveal that, relative to injured White players, injured Black players are deemed more likely to play in a subsequent game, possibly because people assume they feel less pain. Experiments 1–4 show that White and Black Americans–including registered nurses and nursing students–assume that Black people feel less pain than do White people. Finally, Experiments 5 and 6 provide evidence that this bias is rooted in perceptions of status, not race per se. Taken together, these data have important implications for understanding race-related biases and healthcare disparities."
https://openalex.org/W2092570035,"Anthrax lethal factor (LF) is the protease component of anthrax lethal toxin (LT). LT induces pyroptosis in macrophages of certain inbred mouse and rat strains, while macrophages from other inbred strains are resistant to the toxin. In rats, the sensitivity of macrophages to toxin-induced cell death is determined by the presence of an LF cleavage sequence in the inflammasome sensor Nlrp1. LF cleaves rat Nlrp1 of toxin-sensitive macrophages, activating caspase-1 and inducing cell death. Toxin-resistant macrophages, however, express Nlrp1 proteins which do not harbor the LF cleavage site. We report here that mouse Nlrp1b proteins are also cleaved by LF. In contrast to the situation in rats, sensitivity and resistance of Balb/cJ and NOD/LtJ macrophages does not correlate to the susceptibility of their Nlrp1b proteins to cleavage by LF, as both proteins are cleaved. Two LF cleavage sites, at residues 38 and 44, were identified in mouse Nlrp1b. Our results suggest that the resistance of NOD/LtJ macrophages to LT, and the inability of the Nlrp1b protein expressed in these cells to be activated by the toxin are likely due to polymorphisms other than those at the LF cleavage sites."
https://openalex.org/W1982077700,"Background The species Zea mays includes both domesticated maize (ssp. mays) and its closest wild relatives known as the teosintes. While genetic and archaeological studies have provided a well-established history of Z. mays evolution, there is currently minimal description of its current and past distribution. Here, we implemented species distribution modeling using paleoclimatic models of the last interglacial (LI; ∼135,000 BP) and the last glacial maximum (LGM; ∼21,000 BP) to hindcast the distribution of Zea mays subspecies over time and to revisit current knowledge of its phylogeography and evolutionary history. Methodology/Principal Findings Using a large occurrence data set and the distribution modeling MaxEnt algorithm, we obtained robust present and past species distributions of the two widely distributed teosinte subspecies (ssps. parviglumis and mexicana) revealing almost perfect complementarity, stable through time, of their occupied distributions. We also investigated the present distributions of primitive maize landraces, which overlapped but were broader than those of the teosintes. Our data reinforced the idea that little historical gene flow has occurred between teosinte subspecies, but maize has served as a genetic bridge between them. We observed an expansion of teosinte habitat from the LI, consistent with population genetic data. Finally, we identified locations potentially serving as refugia for the teosintes throughout epochs of climate change and sites that should be targeted in future collections. Conclusion/Significance The restricted and highly contrasting ecological niches of the wild teosintes differ substantially from domesticated maize. Variables determining the distributions of these taxa can inform future considerations of local adaptation and the impacts of climate change. Our assessment of the changing distributions of Zea mays taxa over time offers a unique glimpse into the history of maize, highlighting a strategy for the study of domestication that may prove useful for other species."
https://openalex.org/W2006943850,"Diet influences host metabolism and intestinal microbiota; however, detailed understanding of this tripartite interaction is limited. To determine whether the nonfermentable fiber hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC) could alter the intestinal microbiota and whether such changes correlated with metabolic improvements, C57B/L6 mice were normalized to a high-fat diet (HFD), then either maintained on HFD (control), or switched to HFD supplemented with 10% HPMC, or a low-fat diet (LFD). Compared to control treatment, both LFD and HPMC reduced weight gain (11.8 and 5.7 g, respectively), plasma cholesterol (23.1 and 19.6%), and liver triglycerides (73.1 and 44.6%), and, as revealed by 454-pyrosequencing of the microbial 16S rRNA gene, decreased microbial α-diversity and differentially altered intestinal microbiota. Both LFD and HPMC increased intestinal Erysipelotrichaceae (7.3- and 12.4-fold) and decreased Lachnospiraceae (2.0- and 2.7-fold), while only HPMC increased Peptostreptococcaceae (3.4-fold) and decreased Ruminococcaceae (2.7-fold). Specific microorganisms were directly linked with weight change and metabolic parameters in HPMC and HFD mice, but not in LFD mice, indicating that the intestinal microbiota may play differing roles during the two dietary modulations. This work indicates that HPMC is a potential prebiotic fiber that influences intestinal microbiota and improves host metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W1981901026,"On agar surface, bacterial daughter cells form a 4-cell array after the first two rounds of division, and this phenomenon has been previously attributed to a balancing of interactions among the daughter bacteria and the underneath agar. We studied further the organization and development of colony after additional generations. By confocal laser scanning microscopy and real-time imaging, we observed that bacterial cells were able to self-organize and resulted in a near circular micro-colony consisting of monolayer cells. After continuous dividing, bacteria transited from two-dimensional expansion into three-dimensional growth and formed two to multi-layers in the center but retained a monolayer in the outer ring of the circular colony. The transverse width of this outer ring appeared to be approximately constant once the micro-colony reached a certain age. This observation supports the notion that balanced interplays of the forces involved lead to a gross morphology as the bacteria divide into offspring on agar surface. In this case, the result is due to a balance between the expansion force of the dividing bacteria, the non-covalent force among bacterial offspring and that between bacteria and substratum."
https://openalex.org/W2071561737,"Objectives The role of angiotensin II type 2 (AT2) receptor stimulation in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance is still unclear. Therefore we examined the possibility that direct AT2 receptor stimulation by compound 21 (C21) might contribute to possible insulin-sensitizing/anti-diabetic effects in type 2 diabetes (T2DM) with PPARγ activation, mainly focusing on adipose tissue. Methods T2DM mice, KK-Ay, were subjected to intraperitoneal injection of C21 and/or a PPARγ antagonist, GW9662 in drinking water for 2 weeks. Insulin resistance was evaluated by oral glucose tolerance test, insulin tolerance test, and uptake of 2-[3H] deoxy-D-glucose in white adipose tissue. Morphological changes of adipose tissues as well as adipocyte differentiation and inflammatory response were examined. Results Treatment with C21 ameliorated insulin resistance in KK-Ay mice without influencing blood pressure, at least partially through effects on the PPARγ pathway. C21 treatment increased serum adiponectin concentration and decreased TNF-α concentration; however, these effects were attenuated by PPARγ blockade by co-treatment with GW9662. Moreover, we observed that administration of C21 enhanced adipocyte differentiation and PPARγ DNA-binding activity, with a decrease in inflammation in white adipose tissue, whereas these effects of C21 were attenuated by co-treatment with GW9662. We also observed that administration of C21 restored β cell damage in diabetic pancreatic tissue. Conclusion The present study demonstrated that direct AT2 receptor stimulation by C21 accompanied with PPARγ activation ameliorated insulin resistance in T2DM mice, at least partially due to improvement of adipocyte dysfunction and protection of pancreatic β cells."
https://openalex.org/W2086730664,"The readdition of an essential nutrient to starved, fermenting cells of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae triggers rapid activation of the protein kinase A (PKA) pathway. Trehalase is activated 5-10-fold within minutes and has been used as a convenient reporter for rapid activation of PKA in vivo. Although trehalase can be phosphorylated and activated by PKA in vitro, demonstration of phosphorylation during nutrient activation in vivo has been lacking. We now show, using phosphospecific antibodies, that glucose and nitrogen activation of trehalase in vivo is associated with phosphorylation of Ser(21) and Ser(83). Unexpectedly, mutants with reduced PKA activity show constitutive phosphorylation despite reduced trehalase activation. The same phenotype was observed upon deletion of the catalytic subunits of yeast protein phosphatase 2A, suggesting that lower PKA activity causes reduced trehalase dephosphorylation. Hence, phosphorylation of trehalase in vivo is not sufficient for activation. Deletion of the inhibitor Dcs1 causes constitutive trehalase activation and phosphorylation. It also enhances binding of trehalase to the 14-3-3 proteins Bmh1 and Bmh2, suggesting that Dcs1 inhibits by preventing 14-3-3 binding. Deletion of Bmh1 and Bmh2 eliminates both trehalase activation and phosphorylation. Our results reveal that trehalase activation in vivo is associated with phosphorylation of typical PKA sites and thus establish the enzyme as a reliable read-out for nutrient activation of PKA in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2123747489,"The need for the timely collection of diagnostic biosamples during symptomatic episodes represents a major obstacle to large-scale studies on acute respiratory infection (ARI) epidemiology. This may be circumvented by having the participants collect their own nasal swabs. We compared self- and staff-collected swabs in terms of swabbing quality and detection of viral respiratory pathogens.We conducted a prospective study among employees of our institution during the ARI season 2010/2011 (December-March). Weekly emails were sent to the participants (n = 84), reminding them to come to the study center in case of new symptoms. The participants self-collected an anterior nasal swab from one nostril, and trained study personnel collected one from the other nostril. The participants self-collected another two swabs (one from each nostril) on a subsequent day. Human β-actin DNA concentration was determined in the swabs as a quality control. Viral respiratory pathogens were detected by multiplex RT-PCR (Seeplex RV15 kit, Seegene, Eschborn, Germany). Of 84 participants, 56 (67%) reported at least one ARI episode, 18 participants two, and one participant three. Self-swabbing was highly accepted by the participants. The amount of β-actin DNA per swab was higher in the self- than in the staff-collected swabs (p = 0.008). β-actin concentration was lower in the self-swabs collected on day 1 than in those collected on a subsequent day (p<0.0001). A respiratory viral pathogen was detected in 31% (23/75) of staff- and in 35% (26/75) of self-collected swabs (p = 0.36). With both approaches, the most frequently identified pathogens were human rhinoviruses A/B/C (12/75 swabs, 16%) and human coronavirus OC43 (4/75 swabs, 5%). There was almost perfect agreement between self- and staff-collected swabs in terms of pathogen detection (agreement = 93%, kappa = 0.85, p<0.0001).Nasal self-swabbing for identification of viral ARI pathogens proved to be equivalent to staff-swabbing in this population in terms of acceptance and pathogen detection."
https://openalex.org/W2084590264,"Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) microscopy is widely used to study protein interactions in living cells. Typically, spectral variants of the Green Fluorescent Protein (FPs) are incorporated into proteins expressed in cells, and FRET between donor and acceptor FPs is assayed. As appreciable FRET occurs only when donors and acceptors are within 10 nm of each other, the presence of FRET can be indicative of aggregation that may denote association of interacting species. By monitoring the excited-state (fluorescence) decay of the donor in the presence and absence of acceptors, dual-component decay analysis has been used to reveal the fraction of donors that are FRET positive (i.e., in aggregates)._However, control experiments using constructs containing both a donor and an acceptor FP on the same protein repeatedly indicate that a large fraction of these donors are FRET negative, thus rendering the interpretation of dual-component analysis for aggregates between separately donor-containing and acceptor-containing proteins problematic. Using Monte-Carlo simulations and analytical expressions, two possible sources for such anomalous behavior are explored: 1) conformational heterogeneity of the proteins, such that variations in the distance separating donor and acceptor FPs and/or their relative orientations persist on time-scales long in comparison with the excited-state lifetime, and 2) FP dark states."
https://openalex.org/W2090996804,"Matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP-1) is a collagenase that is highly active in extracellular matrix and vascular remodeling, angiogenesis, and tumor progression. Vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 (VEGFR2), the main receptor for VEGF-A, is expressed on endothelial cells and promotes cell survival, proliferation, and other functions. Although MMP-1 and VEGFR2 co-exist in many normal and pathophysiological conditions, the effect of MMP-1 on cellular VEGFR2 that can promote the above processes is unknown. In this study we test the hypothesis that stimulation of endothelial cells with MMP-1 increases their levels of VEGFR2. The increased VEGFR2 is then available to bind VEGF-A, resulting in increased response. Indeed we found that endothelial cells incubated with active MMP-1 had higher mRNA and protein levels of VEGFR2. Furthermore, VEGF-A-dependent phosphorylation of intracellular signaling molecules and endothelial proliferation were elevated after MMP-1 treatment. MMP-1 caused activation of the nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) pathway (p65/RelA) in endothelial cells, and this response was dependent upon activation of protease activated receptor-1 (PAR-1). Chromatin immunoprecipitation was used to confirm NF-κB-mediated active transcription of the VEGFR2 (KDR) gene. Elevation in VEGFR2 after MMP-1 stimulation was inhibited by PAR-1 knockdown and NF-κB specific inhibition. We conclude that MMP-1 promotes VEGFR2 expression and proliferation of endothelial cells through stimulation of PAR-1 and activation of NF-κB. These results suggest a mechanism by which MMP-1 may prime or sensitize endothelial cell functions.

Additionally, it was shown that activation of PAR-1 by the serine protease thrombin enhances endothelial levels of VEGFR228, thus suggesting a key role for PAR-1 in endothelial cell functions. Given the frequent interactions MMPs have with the endothelium, it is possible that a mechanism exists by which MMPs may serve to sensitize endothelial cells for VEGFR2-mediated functions. Therefore, in the present study we specifically tested whether endothelial cell stimulation with MMP-1 would result in up-regulation of VEGFR2 expression and therefore augment VEGF-A-mediated signaling, thereby enhancing the proliferative response. We were able to show that cells treated with MMP-1 have increased levels of VEGFR2. By the use of specific inhibition protocols we also found that the mechanism by which VEGFR2 is up-regulated is mediated by PAR-1 and activation of the NF-κB pathway. These results therefore provide insights regarding the ability of MMP-1 to enhance endothelial functions/activities in conditions associated with increased levels of MMP-1. Human umbilical venous endothelial cells (HUVECs) were purchased from Cell Applications, Inc., and bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAECs) were a generous gift from Dr. Shu Chien (University of California San Diego). All cells were used between passages 2 and 4. HUVECs and BAECs were cultured in complete growth media (Cell Applications Inc.) at 37 °C and 5% CO2. At subconfluence, cells were starved overnight in serum-free maintenance media (Cell Applications Inc.) to reach a baseline level of gene expression. To evaluate changes in VEGFR2 expression over time, cells were incubated with 25 ng/ml of MMP-1 (EMD Biosciences) activated with 4-aminophenylmercuric acetate (10:1, respectively, at 37 °C for 2 h) at appropriate time points. MMP-1 activity levels were measured before each experiment and kept constant for all experiments. MMP-8 and MMP-9 were purchased by EMD Biosciences and activated as described.

FITC-conjugated chicken anti-human VEGFR2 antibody used for immunofluorescence was purchased from Genetex and was used 1:100 in 5% normal goat serum in PBS. PAR-1 primary antibody was purchased from Beckman Coulter and used for Western blotting as described. RNAi transfections were performed as indicated by the manufacturer with siRNA transfection reagent, siRNA transfection medium, control fluorescein siRNA, and human thrombin receptor siRNA (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.). VEGF-A was purchased from PeproTech and used at 5 ng/ml. To inhibit the NF-κB pathway, CAY 10512 (0.15 μm; Cayman) was used. For VEGFR2 and signaling proteins analysis, cells were lysed on ice with RIPA buffer supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitors (mixtures; Sigma and Pierce). For NF-κB analysis, endothelial cells were stimulated with MMP-1 for predetermined time points, then harvested and lysed with 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.5 mm Na3VO4, 10% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, and 50 mm NaF to obtain cytosolic fractions. After centrifugation, pellets were then lysed with the described lysis buffer supplemented with 2.5% Triton X-100 detergent for lysis of nuclear fractions. These fractions were used for Western blotting to determine nuclear levels of p65. For experiments where NF-κB was inhibited, cells were treated with 0.15 μm NF-κB inhibitor (CAY10512) overnight in serum-free media. Cells were then harvested and nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions were separated as described above. Cells were grown to subconfluence in 96-well tissue culture plates (BD Falcon). To test for elevated protein expression, HUVECs were treated with MMP-1 in serum-free media for 0, 4, 8, 12, and 24 h and BAECs were treated for 0, 1, 3, 6, and 24 h. Both cell types were serum starved for 2 h and subsequently treated with MMP-1 for 0, 5, 15, 30, or 60 min, or TNF-α for 30 min. After treatment cells were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde (for membrane VEGFR2 staining) or with ice-cold methanol (whole cell staining) for 20 min at room temperature. Cells were incubated with primary antibody against VEGFR2, NF-κB (p65 subunit), and/or β-tubulin in 5% normal goat serum in PBS for 1 h. Cells were washed with 1× PBS and then incubated with either FITC-conjugated secondary antibody, or Texas Red Avidin-D. Nuclei were stained with DAPI. Imaging was carried out using the Opera QEHS system (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) at the Sanford Burnham Medical Research Institute CPCCG with objective: ×20, 0.45 NA (Numerical Aperture). Channel 1 (nucleus) nuclei were stained with DAPI. The DAPI channel was imaged using the nonconfocal light path. The Opera's xenon arc lamp set to 365 nm was used for excitation and an emission filter of 450/50 nm was used in front of the camera. The exposure time for channel 1 was ∼40 ms. For channel 2 (FITC), the cytoplasm/membrane was excited using the 488-nm laser line. The images were acquired using the confocal system of the Opera QEHS system. The exposure time was ∼2000 ms. Nine fields were acquired for each well. The image analysis was done using Acapella 2.5. The analysis algorithm was developed at the Conrad Prebys Centre for Chemical Genomics (CPCCG). The algorithm uses inbuilt Nuclei, Membrane, and Cytoplasm detection. To examine the ability of MMP-1 to prime endothelial cells for proliferation, we measured BrdU incorporation after MMP-1 treatment using a commercial kit (Roche Applied Science). Cells were grown in 96-well plates (BD Biosciences) and transferred to starvation media with/without MMP-1 for 24 h. Starvation media was then removed and complete media was supplemented with 10 ng/ml of VEGF-A and BrdU was added for 5 h. Cells were fixed and labeled for BrdU according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, subconfluent HUVECs were transfected with 40 pmol of human PAR-1 siRNA or control fluorescein conjugate siRNA using siRNA transfection reagent (SCB, Inc.). Cells were incubated only with transfection reagents for 5 h. Complete media was subsequently added to the mixture with the cells exposed to siRNA complexes overnight. The next day the transfection media was removed and replaced with complete media. Cells were assayed for PAR-1 expression 48 h post-transfection. For cellular signaling analysis cells were treated with MMP-1 for 24 h followed with 5 ng/ml of recombinant VEGF-A (PeproTech) for 5 and 15 min in serum-free maintenance media, washed with PBS, and lysed for analysis. For each experiment, 40 μg of total protein was separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat milk in Tris-buffered saline (pH 7.4) with 0.5% Tween 20 (TBS-T). Blots were then incubated overnight at 4 °C in TBS-T, 5% milk containing primary antibodies against the studied proteins. Blots were then washed and incubated with HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies. Signal on x-rays films was detected using the chemiluminescence reagents of the EZ-ECL kit (Pierce). Band density was analyzed using the NIH Image J software. For mRNA analysis, cells were lysed and genetic material was purified according to the manufacturer's protocols (Qiagen). cDNA templates were generated from 3 μg of RNA using SuperScript III Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen). Quantitative RT-PCR were performed using the ABI Prism 7900HT Thermal Cycler, using primers for VEGFR2 (Flk-1 in BAEC or KDR in HUVEC) and β-actin as a normalization control (Table 1).

A sample of input DNA was saved and p65 was precipitated overnight with anti-rabbit DynaBeads (Invitrogen) pre-coupled with 10 mg of anti-p65 antibody (Santa Cruz sc-372). The beads were extensively washed and DNA was eluted, and the cross-links were reversed at 65 °C for 6 hr, after which both immunoprecipitated and input DNA fractions were treated with Proteinase K. DNA was recovered using Qiagen PCR product purification kit and subjected to gene-specific quantitative real time-PCR with the indicated primers (Table 1). To estimate the assay background, normal rabbit IgG (Santa Cruz sc-2027) was used instead of the p65 antibody; the levels of KDR regions precipitated with p65 antibody in the untreated cells were similar to those precipitated with the normal IgG (data not shown). All statistical results were presented as mean ± S.E. An unpaired two-tailed Student's t test was used for comparison between two groups. Analysis of variance was used to test for differences in outcomes of interest among groups. Results were determined to be significant at (*) p < 0.05. Tukey's post-hoc multiple comparison test was used to determine the significance between individual groups. All analyses were performed using SPSS version 18, Chicago, IL. Membrane-associated VEGFR2 is increased in a temporal fashion following stimulation with MMP-1 (245 ± 12.2 mean fluorescent intensity at t = 0 versus 346 ± 28.8 mean fluorescent intensity at t = 24 h, *, p < 0.05; Fig. 1, A and B). Whole cell VEGFR2 levels were also increased after treatment with MMP-1 (1.5 ± 0.28 versus 0.68 ± 0.07 Relative Density Units of MMP-1 treated versus untreated cells; p < 0.05; Fig. 1, C and D). VEGFR2/KDR gene transcript levels were elevated following treatment with MMP-1 for 30 min and 8 h (3 ± 0.2 at 30 min and 4.4 ± 0.6-fold amplification at 8 h versus 1 ± 0.3 at t = 0; *, p < 0.05; Fig. 1E). In BAECs, as in HUVECs, VEGFR2 protein and VEGFR2/Flk-1 mRNA levels were significantly higher after MMP-1 treatment compared with untreated control cells (Fig. 1, F–H). Control and MMP-1-treated cells were stimulated with VEGF-A for 5 and 15 min to examine the ability of newly expressed VEGFR2 to enhance VEGF-A-mediated signaling levels (Fig. 2). At both 5 and 15 min following stimulation with VEGF, phosphorylation levels of the target proteins VEGFR2, ERK (0.95 ± 0.01 versus 0.7 ± 0.02, p < 0.05; Fig. 2C), and JNK and MAPK were significantly higher in MMP-1-treated cells versus controls (Fig. 2, A–C). Phosphorylated VEGFR2 levels relative to β-actin loading controls were significantly elevated following a 24-h MMP-1 treatment and 5-min incubation with VEGF-A (Fig. 2, A and B; n = 6; *, p < 0.05). To measure one possible physiologic outcome that an increase in VEGFR2 due to MMP-1 stimulation might have, we measured cell proliferation via BrdU incorporation after stimulation with MMP-1. Our results (Fig. 2D) show that cells treated with MMP-1 and then stimulated with VEGF-A proliferate at a significantly faster rate compared with untreated cells exposed to VEGF-A. As a known substrate for MMP-1 (25Boire A. Covic L. Agarwal A. Jacques S. Sherifi S. Kuliopulos A. PAR1 is a matrix metalloproteases-1 receptor that promotes invasion and tumorigenesis of breast cancer cells.Cell. 2005; 120: 303-313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar), we next examined whether or not PAR-1 was responsible for the MMP-1-mediated increase in VEGFR2 levels. PAR-1 knockdown blunted the otherwise increased VEGFR2 levels upon 24 h of MMP-1 treatment seen in cells transfected with control siRNA (0.75 ± 0.17 versus 1.24 ± 0.18 Relative Density Units, respectively, p < 0.05; Fig. 3, A and B). Moreover, cells transfected with control siRNA had increased levels of VEGFR2 following MMP-1 stimulation for 24 h compared with untreated cells (1.24 ± 0.18 versus 0.56 ± 0.13 RDU, respectively, p < 0.05; Fig. 3, A and B). Upon stimulation with VEGF-A, phosphorylated VEGFR2 was decreased at 5 and 15 min in PAR-1 knockdowns (Fig. 3C) compared with control cells expressing PAR-1. Due to its prominent role in endothelial proliferation (7Secchiero P. Gonelli A. Carnevale E. Milani D. Pandolfi A. Zella D. Zauli G. TRAIL promotes the survival and proliferation of primary human vascular endothelial cells by activating the Akt and ERK pathways.Circulation. 2003; 107: 2250-2256Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar), we chose to focus on the effect PAR-1 knockdown has on ERK signaling following MMP-1 treatment. At 15 min of VEGF-A treatment, levels of p-ERK were significantly lower in MMP-1-treated PAR-1 knockdown cells compared with MMP-1-treated control siRNA-transfected cells (0.64 ± 0.02 versus 0.79 ± 0.04 RDU, respectively, p < 0.05; Fig. 3, C and D). Upon stimulation with MMP-1 for 30 min, immunostaining depicts nuclear translocation of the p65/RelA subunit into the cell nuclei, a surrogate marker for NF-κB activation (Fig. 4A), and the nuclear to cytoplasm ratio of p65 showed a peak at 30 min (0.85 ± 0.05 at t = 0 versus 1.56 ± 0.03 at t = 30 min, p < 0.05; Fig. 4B). Nuclear separation followed by Western blotting was performed to confirm the nuclear translocation of the p65 subunit following treatment with MMP-1. Phosphorylated IκB levels were markedly higher after MMP-1 treatment (Fig. 4C) and the corresponding increase in nuclear p65 is seen as well (Fig. 4, C and D). TNF-α served as a positive control for p65 nuclear translocation. Similarly to HUVECs, BAECs displayed a similar trend in response to MMP-1 treatment where the ratio of nuclear:cytoplasm p65 was 1.67 ± 0.13 at 30 min compared with 1.24 ± 0.06 in untreated cells (data not shown). In PAR-1 knockdown cells, levels of p-IκB and nuclear p65 were not different in MMP-1-treated cells compared with controls (Fig. 4, E and F). TNF-α still causes significant p65 nuclear translocation in PAR-1 knockdown cells (Fig. 4, E and F). To test the ability of the p65 subunit of NF-κB to bind and stimulate transcription of the KDR gene (KDR = VEGFR2-encoding gene), we first searched for NF-κB putative binding sites in the KDR promoter and first intron using TFSEARCH online software. KDR1 and KDR2 were located in the first intron and KDR6 in the upstream region (Fig. 5A). Then we used chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) to test the ability of p65 to directly regulate transcription of the KDR gene. Upon MMP-1 stimulation there was elevated binding of p65 to the KDR first intron (KDR1 and KDR2) and KDR upstream region (KDR6) compared with untreated cells (Fig. 5B). To discern whether the KDR gene was also being actively transcribed, these same genomic regions were analyzed in the chromatin precipitated with anti-acetylated histone H3 antibody. All three promoter regions had higher levels of acetylated histone after MMP-1 stimulation (Fig. 5C), indicating elevated levels of KDR gene transcription. Finally, to test whether the activation of NF-κB observed after MMP-1 treatment is responsible for the increased VEGFR2 levels, we treated the cells with a potent NF-κB inhibitor. Our results (Fig. 5, D and E) show that in NF-κB inhibited cells, the levels of VEGFR2 were significantly lower compared with control cells following MMP-1 treatment (0.69 ± 0.07 versus 1.6 ± 0.16; n = 3). The ability of MMP-1, -8, and -9 to stimulate VEGFR2 production in endothelial cells was tested. Cells incubated with MMP-1 consistently displayed significantly elevated VEGFR2 levels compared with control cells and cells treated with MMP-8 or -9 (data not shown). Although a wide range of MMP-1 concentrations (applied for 24 h) stimulated VEGFR2 production, 25 ng/ml consistently stimulated the largest increase in VEGFR2 levels compared with untreated controls (Fig. 6A). To assess whether MMP-1 itself or its activity is responsible for stimulating the rise in VEGFR2 levels, we incubated endothelial cells with inactive MMP-1 and analyzed VEGFR2 levels in a time-dependent fashion using high throughput imaging (Fig. 6B). There was no significant difference in VEGFR2 levels in cells treated with inactivated MMP-1 compared with untreated cells, suggesting that MMP-1 activity is responsible for enhanced VEGFR2 levels. In this study we show that stimulation of endothelial cells with MMP-1 results in elevated VEGFR2 levels. This augmented VEGFR2 expression is then associated with increased VEGF-A-dependent signaling and cell proliferation. We further demonstrate that MMP-1-mediated VEGFR2 production involves activation of PAR-1 and occurs through an NF-κB-dependent mechanism. VEGFR2 and MMPs are known to have critical roles in a wide variety of normal and pathophysiological conditions, including cell proliferation, vascular remodeling, angiogenesis, tumor progression, chronic inflammation, wound healing, etc. (1Egeblad M.

https://openalex.org/W2147539108,"Schemes designed to make farming landscapes less hostile to wildlife have been questioned because target taxa do not always respond in the expected manner. Microbats are often overlooked in this process, yet persist in agricultural landscapes and exert top-down control of crop pests. We investigated the relationship between microbats and measures commonly incorporated into agri-environment schemes, to derive management recommendations for their ongoing conservation. We used acoustic detectors to quantify bat species richness, activity, and feeding in 32 linear remnants and adjacent fields across an agricultural region of New South Wales, Australia. Nocturnal arthropods were simultaneously trapped using black-light traps. We recorded 91,969 bat calls, 17,277 of which could be attributed to one of the 13 taxa recorded, and 491 calls contained feeding buzzes. The linear remnants supported higher bat activity than the fields, but species richness and feeding activity did not significantly differ. We trapped a mean 87.6 g (±17.6 g SE) of arthropods per night, but found no differences in biomass between land uses. Wider linear remnants with intact native vegetation supported more bat species, as did those adjacent to unsealed, as opposed to sealed roads. Fields of unimproved native pastures, with more retained scattered trees and associated hollows and logs, supported the greatest bat species richness and activity. We conclude that the juxtaposition of linear remnants of intact vegetation and scattered trees in fields, coupled with less-intensive land uses such as unimproved pastures will benefit bat communities in agricultural landscapes, and should be incorporated into agri-environment schemes. In contrast, sealed roads may act as a deterrent. The “wildlife friendly farming” vs “land sparing” debate has so far primarily focussed on birds, but here we have found evidence that the integration of both approaches could particularly benefit bats."
https://openalex.org/W2057860618,"Both gastric and colorectal cancers (CRC) are the most frequently occurring malignancies worldwide with the overall survival of these patients remains unsatisfied. Identification of tumor suppressor genes (TSG) silenced by promoter CpG methylation uncovers mechanisms of tumorigenesis and identifies new epigenetic biomarkers for early cancer detection and prognosis assessment. Cystathionine-beta-synthase (CBS) functions in the folate metabolism pathway, which is intricately linked to methylation of genomic DNA. Dysregulation of DNA methylation contributes substantially to cancer development.To identify potential TSGs silenced by aberrant promoter methylation in CRC, we analyzed tumor and adjacent tissues from CRC cases using the Illumina Human Methylation45 BeadChip. We identified hypermethylation of the CBS gene in CRC samples, compared to adjacent tissues. Methylation and decreased mRNA expression of CBS were detected in most CRC cell lines by methylation-specific PCR and semiquantitative RT-PCR, as well as in gastric cancer. Treatment with 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine and/or trichostatin A reversed methylation and restored CBS mRNA expression indicating a direct effect. Aberrant methylation was further detected in 31% of primary CRCs (29 of 96) and 55% of gastric tumors (11 of 20). In contrast, methylation was seldom found in normal tissues adjacent to the tumor. CBS methylation was associated with KRAS mutations in primary CRCs (P = 0.04, by χ(2)-test). However, no association was found between CBS methylation or KRAS mutations with cancer relapse/metastasis in Stage II CRC patients.A novel finding from this study is that the folate metabolism enzyme CBS mRNA levels are frequently downregulated through CpG methylation of the CBS gene in gastric cancer and CRC, suggesting that CBS functions as a tumor suppressor gene. These findings warrant further study of CBS as an epigenetic biomarker for molecular diagnosis of gastrointestinal cancers."
https://openalex.org/W1994966186,"Cancer initiating cells (CICs) represent a unique cell population essential for the maintenance and growth of tumors. Most in vivo studies of CICs utilize human tumor xenografts in immunodeficient mice. These models provide limited information on the interaction of CICs with the host immune system and are of limited value in assessing therapies targeting CICs, especially immune-based therapies. To assess this, a syngeneic cancer model is needed. We examined the sphere-forming capacity of thirteen murine lung cancer cell lines and identified TC-1 and a metastatic subclone of Lewis lung carcinoma (HM-LLC) as cell lines that readily formed and maintained spheres over multiple passages. TC-1 tumorspheres were not enriched for expression of CD133 or CD44, putative CIC markers, nor did they demonstrate Hoechst 33342 side population staining or Aldefluor activity compared to adherent TC-1 cells. However, in tumorsphere culture, these cells exhibited self-renewal and long-term symmetric division capacity and expressed more Oct-4 compared to adherent cells. HM-LLC sphere-derived cells exhibited increased Oct-4, CD133, and CD44 expression, demonstrated a Hoechst 33342 side population and Aldefluor activity compared to adherent cells or a low metastatic subclone of LLC (LM-LLC). In syngeneic mice, HM-LLC sphere-derived cells required fewer cells to initiate tumorigenesis compared to adherent or LM-LLC cells. Similarly TC-1 sphere-derived cells were more tumorigenic than adherent cells in syngeneic mice. In contrast, in immunocompromised mice, less than 500 sphere or adherent TC-1 cells and less than 1,000 sphere or adherent LLC cells were required to initiate a tumor. We suggest that no single phenotypic marker can identify CICs in murine lung cancer cell lines. Tumorsphere culture may provide an alternative approach to identify and enrich for murine lung CICs. Furthermore, we propose that assessing tumorigenicity of murine lung CICs in syngeneic mice better models the interaction of CICs with the host immune system."

The voxel-based morphometry (VBM) method was used to measure the regional gray matter volume in three groups, the correlations of PTSD symptom severities with the gray matter volume in trauma survivors were also analyzed by multiple regression.Compared with normal controls, recent onset PTSD patients had smaller gray matter volume in left dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), and non PTSD subjects had smaller gray matter volume in the right pulvinar and left pallidum. The gray matter volume of the trauma survivors correlated negatively with CAPS scores in the right frontal lobe, left anterior and middle cingulate cortex, bilateral cuneus cortex, right middle occipital lobe, while in the recent onset PTSD, the gray matter volume correlated negatively with CAPS scores in bilateral superior medial frontal lobe and right ACC.The present study identified gray matter loss in different regions in recent onset PTSD and non PTSD after a single prolonged trauma exposure. The gray matter volume of left dorsal ACC associated with the development of PTSD, while the gray matter volume of right pulvinar and left pallidum associated with the response to the severe stress. The atrophy of the frontal and limbic cortices predicts the symptom severities of the PTSD."
https://openalex.org/W2051762829,"Background Recent studies on colour discrimination suggest that experience is an important factor in how a visual system processes spectral signals. In insects it has been shown that differential conditioning is important for processing fine colour discriminations. However, the visual system of many insects, including the honeybee, has a complex set of neural pathways, in which input from the long wavelength sensitive (‘green’) photoreceptor may be processed either as an independent achromatic signal or as part of a trichromatic opponent-colour system. Thus, a potential confound of colour learning in insects is the possibility that modulation of the ‘green’ photoreceptor could underlie observations. Methodology/Principal Findings We tested honeybee vision using light emitting diodes centered on 414 and 424 nm wavelengths, which limit activation to the short-wavelength-sensitive (‘UV’) and medium-wavelength-sensitive (‘blue’) photoreceptors. The absolute irradiance spectra of stimuli was measured and modelled at both receptor and colour processing levels, and stimuli were then presented to the bees in a Y-maze at a large visual angle (26°), to ensure chromatic processing. Sixteen bees were trained over 50 trials, using either appetitive differential conditioning (N = 8), or aversive-appetitive differential conditioning (N = 8). In both cases the bees slowly learned to discriminate between the target and distractor with significantly better accuracy than would be expected by chance. Control experiments confirmed that changing stimulus intensity in transfers tests does not significantly affect bee performance, and it was possible to replicate previous findings that bees do not learn similar colour stimuli with absolute conditioning. Conclusion Our data indicate that honeybee colour vision can be tuned to relatively small spectral differences, independent of ‘green’ photoreceptor contrast and brightness cues. We thus show that colour vision is at least partly experience dependent, and behavioural plasticity plays an important role in how bees exploit colour information."
https://openalex.org/W2026721264,"Background The household is a recognized community reservoir for Staphylococcus aureus. This study investigated potential risk factors for intra-household S. aureus transmission, including the contribution of environmental contamination. Methods We investigated intra-household S. aureus transmission using a sample of multiple member households from a community-based case-control study examining risk factors for CA-MRSA infection conducted in Northern Manhattan. During a home visit, index subjects completed a questionnaire. All consenting household members were swabbed, as were standardized environmental household items. Swabs were cultured for S. aureus. Positive isolates underwent further molecular characterization. Intra-household transmission was defined as having identical strains among two or more household members. Multiple logistic regression was used to identify independent risk factors for transmission. Results We enrolled 291 households: 146 index cases, 145 index controls and 687 of their household contacts. The majority of indexes were Hispanic (85%), low income (74%), and female (67%), with a mean age of 31 (range 1–79). The average size of case and control households was 4 people. S. aureus colonized individuals in 62% of households and contaminated the environment in 54% of households. USA300 was the predominant clinical infection, colonizing and environmental strain. Eighty-one households had evidence of intra-household transmission: 55 (38%) case and 26 (18%) control households (P<.01). Environmental contamination with a colonizing or clinical infection strain (aOR: 5.4 [2.9–10.3] P<.01) and the presence of a child under 5 (aOR: 2.3 [1.2–4.5] P = .02) were independently associated with transmission. In separate multivariable models, environmental contamination was associated with transmission among case (aOR 3.3, p<.01) and control households (aOR 27.2, p<.01). Conclusions Environmental contamination with a colonizing or clinical infection strain was significantly and independently associated with transmission in a large community-based sample. Environmental contamination should be considered when treating S. aureus infections, particularly among households with multiple infected members."

https://openalex.org/W2003967650,"Granulosa cell tumors (GCTs) are the most common ovarian estrogen producing tumors, leading to symptoms of excessive estrogen such as endometrial hyperplasia and endometrial adenocarcinoma. These tumors have malignant potential and often recur. The etiology of GCT is unknown. TGFα is a potent mitogen for many different cells. However, its function in GCT initiation, progression and metastasis has not been determined. The present study aims to determine whether TGFα plays a role in the growth of GCT cells. KGN cells, which are derived from an invasive GCT and have many features of normal granulosa cells, were used as the cellular model. Immunohistochemistry, Western blot and RT-PCR results showed that the ErbB family of receptors is expressed in human GCT tissues and GCT cell lines. RT-PCR results also indicated that TGFα and EGF are expressed in the human granulosa cells and the GCT cell lines, suggesting that TGFα might regulate GCT cell function in an autocrine/paracrine manner. TGFα stimulated KGN cell DNA synthesis, cell proliferation, cell viability, cell cycle progression, and cell migration. TGFα rapidly activated EGFR/PI3K/Akt and mTOR pathways, as indicated by rapid phosphorylation of Akt, TSC2, Rictor, mTOR, P70S6K and S6 proteins following TGFα treatment. TGFα also rapidly activated the EGFR/MEK/ERK pathway, and P38 MAPK pathways, as indicated by the rapid phosphorylation of EGFR, MEK, ERK1/2, P38, and CREB after TGFα treatment. Whereas TGFα triggered a transient activation of Akt, it induced a sustained activation of ERK1/2 in KGN cells. Long-term treatment of KGN cells with TGFα resulted in a significant increase in cyclin D2 and a decrease in p27/Kip1, two critical regulators of granulosa cell proliferation and granulosa cell tumorigenesis.

This diagnostic panel identified an Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) subset of patients (6), excluding for the first time other similar ""clinical"" conditions such as cytomegalovirus (CMV), human herpesvirus 6 (HHV6), babesiosis, ehrlichiosis, borreliosis, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumoniae, and adult rheumatic fever, which may be mistakenly called CFS. CFS patients were treated with valacyclovir (14.3 mg/kg q6h) for ≥ 12 months. Each patient improved, based upon the Functional Activity Appraisal: Energy Index Score Healthcare Worker Assessment (EIPS), which is a validated (FSS-9), item scale with high degree of internal consistency measured by Cronbach's alpha.Antibody to EBV viral capsid antigen (VCA) IgM, EBV Diffuse Early Antigen EA(D), and neutralizing antibodies against EBV-encoded DNA polymerase and EBV-encoded dUTPase were assayed serially approximately every three months for 13-16 months from sera obtained from patients with CFS (6) and from sera obtained from twenty patients who had no history of CFS.Antibodies to EBV EA(D) and neutralizing antibodies against the encoded-proteins EBV DNA polymerase and deoxyuridine triphosphate nucleotidohydrolase (dUTPase) were present in the EBV subset CFS patients. Of the sera samples obtained from patients with CFS 93.9% were positive for EA(D), while 31.6% of the control patients were positive for EBV EA(D). Serum samples were positive for neutralizing antibodies against the EBV-encoded dUTPase (23/52; 44.2%) and DNA polymerase (41/52; 78.8%) in EBV subset CFS patients, but negative in sera of controls.There is prolonged elevated antibody level against the encoded proteins EBV dUTPase and EBV DNA polymerase in a subset of CFS patients, suggesting that this antibody panel could be used to identify these patients, if these preliminary findings are corroborated by studies with a larger number of EBV subset CFS patients."
https://openalex.org/W2061091409,"Background The early molecular detection of the dysplasia-carcinoma transition may enhance the strength of diagnosis in the case of colonic biopsies. Our aims were to identify characteristic transcript sets in order to develop diagnostic mRNA expression patterns for objective classification of benign and malignant colorectal diseases and to test the classificatory power of these markers on an independent sample set. Methodology/Principal Findings Colorectal cancer (CRC) and adenoma specific transcript sets were identified using HGU133plus2 microarrays and 53 biopsies (22 CRC, 20 adenoma and 11 normal). Ninety-four independent biopsies (27 CRC, 29 adenoma and 38 normal) were analyzed on microarrays for testing the classificatory power of the discriminatory genes. Array real-time PCR validation was done on 68 independent samples (24 CRC, 24 adenoma and 20 normal). A set of 11 transcripts (including CXCL1, CHI3L1 and GREM1) was determined which could correctly discriminate between high-grade dysplastic adenoma and CRC samples by 100% sensitivity and 88.9% specificity. The discriminatory power of the marker set was proved to be high on independent samples in both microarray and RT-PCR analyses. 95.6% of original and 94.1% of cross-validated samples was correctly classified in discriminant analysis. Conclusions/Significance The identified transcripts could correctly characterize the dysplasia-carcinoma transition in biopsy samples, also on a large independent sample set. These markers can establish the basis of gene expression based diagnostic classification of colorectal cancer. Diagnostic RT-PCR cards can become part of the automated routine procedure."
https://openalex.org/W2120253221,"Quantum dots (QDs) have long promised to revolutionize fluorescence detection to include even applications requiring simultaneous multi-species detection at single molecule sensitivity. Despite the early promise, the unique optical properties of QDs have not yet been fully exploited in e. g. multiplex single molecule sensitivity applications such as single particle tracking (SPT). In order to fully optimize single molecule multiplex application with QDs, we have in this work performed a comprehensive quantitative investigation of the fluorescence intensities, fluorescence intensity fluctuations, and hydrodynamic radii of eight types of commercially available water soluble QDs. In this study, we show that the fluorescence intensity of CdSe core QDs increases as the emission of the QDs shifts towards the red but that hybrid CdSe/CdTe core QDs are less bright than the furthest red-shifted CdSe QDs. We further show that there is only a small size advantage in using blue-shifted QDs in biological applications because of the additional size of the water-stabilizing surface coat. Extending previous work, we finally also show that parallel four color multicolor (MC)-SPT with QDs is possible at an image acquisition rate of at least 25 Hz. We demonstrate the technique by measuring the lateral dynamics of a lipid, biotin-cap-DPPE, in the cellular plasma membrane of live cells using four different colors of QDs; QD565, QD605, QD655, and QD705 as labels."
https://openalex.org/W2080870030,"The HPA-1 alloimmune system carried by the platelet integrin αIIbβ3 is the primary cause of alloimmune thrombocytopenia in Caucasians and the HPA-1b allele might be a risk factor for thrombosis. HPA-1a and -1b alleles are defined by a leucine and a proline, respectively, at position 33 in the β3 subunit. Although the structure of αIIbβ3 is available, little is known about structural effects of the L33P substitution and its consequences on immune response and integrin functions.A complete 3D model of the L33-β3 extracellular domain was built and a P33 model was obtained by in silico mutagenesis. We then performed molecular dynamics simulations. Analyses focused on the PSI, I-EGF-1, and I-EGF-2 domains and confirmed higher exposure of residue 33 in the L33 β3 form. These analyses also showed major structural flexibility of all three domains in both forms, but increased flexibility in the P33 β3 form. The L33P substitution does not alter the local structure (residues 33 to 35) of the PSI domain, but modifies the structural equilibrium of the three domains.These results provide a better understanding of HPA-1 epitopes complexity and alloimmunization prevalence of HPA-1a. P33 gain of structure flexibility in the β3 knee may explain the increased adhesion capacity of HPA-1b platelets and the associated thrombotic risk. Our study provides important new insights into the relationship between HPA-1 variants and β3 structure that suggest possible effects on the alloimmune response and platelet function."
https://openalex.org/W2026865092,"The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is regulated by oncogenic growth factor signals and plays a pivotal role in controlling cellular metabolism, growth and survival. Everolimus (RAD001) is an allosteric mTOR inhibitor that has shown marked efficacy in certain cancers but is unable to completely inhibit mTOR activity. ATP-competitive mTOR inhibitors such as NVP-BEZ235 can block rapamycin-insensitive mTOR readouts and have entered clinical development as anti-cancer agents. Here, we show the degree to which RAD001 and BEZ235 can be synergistically combined to inhibit mTOR pathway activation, cell proliferation and tumor growth, both in vitro and in vivo. RAD001 and BEZ235 synergized in cancer lines representing different lineages and genetic backgrounds. Strong synergy is seen in neuronal, renal, breast, lung, and haematopoietic cancer cells harboring abnormalities in PTEN, VHL, LKB1, Her2, or KRAS. Critically, in the presence of RAD001, the mTOR-4EBP1 pathway and tumorigenesis can be fully inhibited using lower doses of BEZ235. This is relevant since RAD001 is relatively well tolerated in patients while the toxicity profiles of ATP-competitive mTOR inhibitors are currently unknown."
https://openalex.org/W1983215505,"A novel class of small molecule inhibitors for plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 (PAI-1), represented by AZ3976, was identified in a high throughput screening campaign. AZ3976 displayed an IC(50) value of 26 μm in an enzymatic chromogenic assay. In a plasma clot lysis assay, the compound was active with an IC(50) of 16 μm. Surprisingly, AZ3976 did not bind to active PAI-1 but bound to latent PAI-1 with a K(D) of 0.29 μm at 35 °C and a binding stoichiometry of 0.94, as measured by isothermal calorimetry. Reversible binding was confirmed by surface plasmon resonance direct binding experiments. The x-ray structure of AZ3976 in complex with latent PAI-1 was determined at 2.4 Å resolution. The inhibitor was bound in the flexible joint region with the entrance to the cavity located between α-helix D and β-strand 2A. A set of surface plasmon resonance experiments revealed that AZ3976 inhibited PAI-1 by enhancing the latency transition of active PAI-1. Because AZ3976 only had measurable affinity for latent PAI-1, we propose that its mechanism of inhibition is based on binding to a small fraction in equilibrium with active PAI-1, a latent-like prelatent form, from which latent PAI-1 is then generated more rapidly. This mode of action, with induced accelerated latency transition of active PAI-1 may, together with supporting x-ray data, provide improved opportunities for small molecule drug design in the hunt for therapeutically useful PAI-1 inhibitors."
https://openalex.org/W2043473407,"Bacteria employ extracytoplasmic function (ECF) sigma factors for their responses to environmental stresses. Despite intensive research, the molecular dissection of ECF sigma factor regulons has remained a major challenge due to overlaps in the ECF sigma factor-regulated genes and the stimuli that activate the different ECF sigma factors. Here we have employed tiling arrays to single out the ECF σW regulon of the Gram-positive bacterium Bacillus subtilis from the overlapping ECF σX, σY, and σM regulons. For this purpose, we profiled the transcriptome of a B. subtilis sigW mutant under non-stress conditions to select candidate genes that are strictly σW-regulated. Under these conditions, σW exhibits a basal level of activity. Subsequently, we verified the σW-dependency of candidate genes by comparing their transcript profiles to transcriptome data obtained with the parental B. subtilis strain 168 grown under 104 different conditions, including relevant stress conditions, such as salt shock. In addition, we investigated the transcriptomes of rasP or prsW mutant strains that lack the proteases involved in the degradation of the σW anti-sigma factor RsiW and subsequent activation of the σW-regulon. Taken together, our studies identify 89 genes as being strictly σW-regulated, including several genes for non-coding RNAs. The effects of rasP or prsW mutations on the expression of σW-dependent genes were relatively mild, which implies that σW-dependent transcription under non-stress conditions is not strictly related to RasP and PrsW. Lastly, we show that the pleiotropic phenotype of rasP mutant cells, which have defects in competence development, protein secretion and membrane protein production, is not mirrored in the transcript profile of these cells. This implies that RasP is not only important for transcriptional regulation via σW, but that this membrane protease also exerts other important post-transcriptional regulatory functions."
https://openalex.org/W2099957966,"Bacterial pheromone signaling is often governed both by environmentally responsive regulators and by positive feedback. This regulatory combination has the potential to coordinate a group response among distinct subpopulations that perceive key environmental stimuli differently. We have explored the interplay between an environmentally responsive regulator and pheromone-mediated positive feedback in intercellular signaling by Vibrio fischeri ES114, a bioluminescent bacterium that colonizes the squid Euprymna scolopes. Bioluminescence in ES114 is controlled in part by N-(3-oxohexanoyl)-L-homoserine lactone (3OC6), a pheromone produced by LuxI that together with LuxR activates transcription of the luxICDABEG operon, initiating a positive feedback loop and inducing luminescence. The lux operon is also regulated by environmentally responsive regulators, including the redox-responsive ArcA/ArcB system, which directly represses lux in culture. Here we show that inactivating arcA leads to increased 3OC6 accumulation to initiate positive feedback. In the absence of positive feedback, arcA-mediated control of luminescence was only ∼2-fold, but luxI-dependent positive feedback contributed more than 100 fold to the net induction of luminescence in the arcA mutant. Consistent with this overriding importance of positive feedback, 3OC6 produced by the arcA mutant induced luminescence in nearby wild-type cells, overcoming their ArcA repression of lux. Similarly, we found that artificially inducing ArcA could effectively repress luminescence before, but not after, positive feedback was initiated. Finally, we show that 3OC6 produced by a subpopulation of symbiotic cells can induce luminescence in other cells co-colonizing the host. Our results suggest that even transient loss of ArcA-mediated regulation in a sub-population of cells can induce luminescence in a wider community. Moreover, they indicate that 3OC6 can communicate information about both cell density and the state of ArcA/ArcB."
https://openalex.org/W2154305373,"Spinal cord injury (SCI) results in devastating motor and sensory deficits secondary to disrupted neuronal circuits and poor regenerative potential. Efforts to promote regeneration through cell extrinsic and intrinsic manipulations have met with limited success. Stem cells represent an as yet unrealized therapy in SCI. Recently, we identified novel culture methods to induce and maintain primitive neural stem cells (pNSCs) from human embryonic stem cells. We tested whether transplanted human pNSCs can integrate into the CNS of the developing chick neural tube and injured adult rat spinal cord. Following injection of pNSCs into the developing chick CNS, pNSCs integrated into the dorsal aspects of the neural tube, forming cell clusters that spontaneously differentiated into neurons. Furthermore, following transplantation of pNSCs into the lesioned rat spinal cord, grafted pNSCs survived, differentiated into neurons, and extended long distance axons through the scar tissue at the graft-host interface and into the host spinal cord to form terminal-like structures near host spinal neurons. Together, these findings suggest that pNSCs derived from human embryonic stem cells differentiate into neuronal cell types with the potential to extend axons that associate with circuits of the CNS and, more importantly, provide new insights into CNS integration and axonal regeneration, offering hope for repair in SCI."
https://openalex.org/W2049850221,"The Dwarf crayfish or Cambarellinae, is a morphologically singular subfamily of decapod crustaceans that contains only one genus, Cambarellus. Its intriguing distribution, along the river basins of the Gulf Coast of United States (Gulf Group) and into Central México (Mexican Group), has until now lacked of satisfactory explanation. This study provides a comprehensive sampling of most of the extant species of Cambarellus and sheds light on its evolutionary history, systematics and biogeography. We tested the impact of Gulf Group versus Mexican Group geography on rates of cladogenesis using a maximum likelihood framework, testing different models of birth/extinction of lineages. We propose a comprehensive phylogenetic hypothesis for the subfamily based on mitochondrial and nuclear loci (3,833 bp) using Bayesian and Maximum Likelihood methods. The phylogenetic structure found two phylogenetic groups associated to the two main geographic components (Gulf Group and Mexican Group) and is partially consistent with the historical structure of river basins. The previous hypothesis, which divided the genus into three subgenera based on genitalia morphology was only partially supported (P = 0.047), resulting in a paraphyletic subgenus Pandicambarus. We found at least two cases in which phylogenetic structure failed to recover monophyly of recognized species while detecting several cases of cryptic diversity, corresponding to lineages not assigned to any described species. Cladogenetic patterns in the entire subfamily are better explained by an allopatric model of speciation. Diversification analyses showed similar cladogenesis patterns between both groups and did not significantly differ from the constant rate models. While cladogenesis in the Gulf Group is coincident in time with changes in the sea levels, in the Mexican Group, cladogenesis is congruent with the formation of the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt. Our results show how similar allopatric divergence in freshwater organisms can be promoted through diverse vicariant factors."
https://openalex.org/W2057070447,"In this report, we detail Substrate Mediated Enzyme Prodrug Therapy (SMEPT) as a novel approach in drug delivery which relies on enzyme-functionalized cell culture substrates to achieve a localized conversion of benign prodrug(s) into active therapeutics with subsequent delivery to adhering cells or adjacent tissues. For proof-of-concept SMEPT, we use surface adhered micro-structured physical hydrogels based on poly(vinyl alcohol), β-glucuronidase enzyme and glucuronide prodrugs. We demonstrate enzymatic activity mediated by the assembled hydrogel samples and illustrate arms of control over rate of release of model fluorescent cargo. SMEPT was not impaired by adhering cells and afforded facile time - and dose - dependent uptake of the in situ generated fluorescent cargo by hepatic cells, HepG2. With the use of a glucuronide derivative of an anticancer drug, SN-38, SMEPT afforded a decrease in cell viability to a level similar to that achieved using parent drug. Finally, dose response was achieved using SMEPT and administration of judiciously chosen concentration of SN-38 glucuronide prodrug thus revealing external control over drug delivery using drug eluting surface. We believe that this highly adaptable concept will find use in diverse biomedical applications, specifically surface mediated drug delivery and tissue engineering."
https://openalex.org/W2110657554,"The goal of the present study was to determine whether treatment with cigarette smoke extract (CSE) induces cell loss, cellular senescence, and extracellular matrix (ECM) synthesis in primary human retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells. Primary cultured human RPE cells were exposed to 2, 4, 8, and 12% of CSE concentration for 24 hours. Cell loss was detected by cell viability assay. Lipid peroxidation was assessed by loss of cis-parinaric acid (PNA) fluorescence. Senescence-associated ß-galactosidase (SA-ß-Gal) activity was detected by histochemical staining. Expression of apolipoprotein J (Apo J), connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), fibronectin, and laminin were examined by real-time PCR, western blot, or ELISA experiments. The results showed that exposure of cells to 12% of CSE concentration induced cell death, while treatment of cells with 2, 4, and 8% CSE increased lipid peroxidation. Exposure to 8% of CSE markedly increased the number of SA-ß-Gal positive cells to up to 82%, and the mRNA expression of Apo J, CTGF, and fibronectin by approximately 3–4 fold. Treatment with 8% of CSE also increased the protein expression of Apo J and CTGF and the secretion of fibronectin and laminin. Thus, treatment with CSE can induce cell loss, senescent changes, and ECM synthesis in primary human RPE cells. It may be speculated that cigarette smoke could be involved in cellular events in RPE cells as seen in age-related macular degeneration."

RNA interference of CCTα in adherent IEC-ras did not affect PC synthesis, confirming that the enzyme was relatively inactive. However, CCTα silencing in ras-transformed IEC reduced anchorage-independent growth, a criterion for malignant transformation, as well as tumorigenicity in mice.

Although elevated CK expression could increase flux through the CDP-choline pathway, it is generally not considered to be rate-limiting for PC synthesis because the pCholine pool in cells is large compared with other intermediates. In most cases, the rate-limiting step in the pathway is the conversion of pCholine to CDP-choline catalyzed by CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase (CCT), an amphitropic enzyme that is stimulated by reversible binding to membranes in response to increased fatty acids or type II lipids, such as diacylglycerol (24Cornell R.B.

Surprisingly, pharmacological inhibition of the Ras/MAPK signaling pathway reduced CCTα mRNA and protein expression but had no effect on enzyme activity, suggesting that ras transformation expanded an inactive pool of enzyme. Cancer cells, particularly those transformed with oncogenic ras, have elevated pCholine as a result of increased choline kinase expression and increased PC synthesis and turnover. However, this seems at odds with reports of reduced CCT expression and/or activity in the same or related studies. Given these inconsistencies, we investigated the role of CCTα in ras transformation of intestinal epithelial cells (IEC)-18. Normal epithelial cells grow in contact with the extracellular matrix (ECM), and detachment of such cells from the ECM triggers a form of apoptosis called anoikis (37Khwaja A. Rodriguez-Viciana P. Wennström S. Warne P.H. Downward J. Matrix adhesion and Ras transformation both activate a phosphoinositide 3-OH kinase and protein kinase B/Akt cellular survival pathway.EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2783-2793Crossref PubMed Scopus (935) Google Scholar). By contrast, malignant cells are typically anoikis-resistant and grow as three-dimensional masses in the absence of adhesion to the ECM, one of the most stringent criteria for malignant transformation (38Simpson C.D. Anyiwe K. Schimmer A.D. Anoikis resistance and tumor metastasis.Cancer Lett. 2008; 272: 177-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). Oncogenic ras is a well known inhibitor of anoikis, and numerous studies indicate that ras-induced anoikis-resistance is required for the malignant transformation of IEC into tumors in vivo (39Rak J. Mitsuhashi Y. Erdos V. Huang S.N. Filmus J. Kerbel R.S. Massive programmed cell death in intestinal epithelial cells induced by three-dimensional growth conditions.

Biol. 1998; 8: 1331-1334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Here we provide evidence that oncogenic ras triggers CCTα up-regulation in non-malignant IEC-18 and that this is required for the ability of such cells to grow in the absence of adhesion to the ECM and form tumors in vivo. This dependence on CCTα expression was linked to increased PC synthesis in cells that were denied adhesion to the ECM. This represents a novel mechanism by which CCTα and the CDP-choline pathway contribute to the anoikis resistance of IEC-18 transformed with oncogenic ras. AlexaFluor-conjugated donkey anti-goat antibodies, TRIzol, Lipofectamine 2000, and SYBR Green quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) master mix were purchased from Invitrogen.

Eight-week-old female athymic mice (BALB/c) were from Charles River Laboratories (Wilmington, MA) and housed in the Carleton Animal Care Facility (Dalhousie University) for 1 week prior to experiments. Rat IEC-18 and three independently derived clones of IEC-18 that are transformed with H-ras (referred to as ras3, ras4, and ras7) (39Rak J. Mitsuhashi Y. Erdos V. Huang S.N. Filmus J. Kerbel R.S.

IEC-18 and ras-transformed cells were transfected with pEGFP or pCCTα-GFP (41Gehrig K. Morton C.C. Ridgway N.D.

Lentivirus was produced in HEK293T cells (cultured in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium with 10% FBS) by polyethyleneimine-mediated transfection with plasmids encoding packaging factors (pCMVΔ8.2), vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein envelope protein (pCMV-VSVG), and shRNA (pLKO.1). pLKO.1 shRNAs encode the following targeting sequences: shCCTα1, CCTAAGGACATCTACAAGAA; shCCTα2, CCTGTGAGAGTTTATGCGGAT; shCCTβA, GCATGTTTGTTCCAACACAAA; shCCTβB, GCTACTTGTTGGTAGGAGTTT. Non-targeting shNT (CAACAAGATGAAGAGCACCAA) or shGFP (TACAACAGCCACAACGTCTAT) served as controls. After 48 h, virus-containing medium was harvested and filtered, and Polybrene (1 μg/ml) was added. The medium was applied to IEC and IEC-ras cells for 24 h, followed by selection for 48–72 h in IEC-MEM containing 1 or 2 μg/ml puromycin. The effectiveness of CCT silencing was determined by immunoblotting or qPCR. Lentiviral shRNAs under the control of the doxycycline promoter (TRIPz-shCCTα1, TGACTTTTCCTCCACATC; TripZ shCCTα2, AAGTCAAATATTCCATCGG) were expressed in ras4 cells and selected with puromycin as described above. After culturing on agarose for 24 h, shRNAs were induced with or without 1 μg/ml doxycycline for 48 h prior to the start of experiments (see Fig. 9, C and D) Cells cultured on glass coverslips were fixed with 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 15 min and permeabilized with 0.5% (w/v) Triton X-100 for 10 min at 4 °C. Coverslips were incubated sequentially with a primary antibody in PBS plus 1% (w/v) BSA at 20 °C for 1 h followed by an AlexaFluor-conjugated secondary antibody for 1 h at 20 °C. Coverslips were mounted on glass slides with Mowiol® 4-88, and images were captured using a Zeiss LSM510 META confocal microscope equipped with a ×100 oil immersion (1.4 numerical aperture) objective. Microscope settings for imaging of lamin A/C in IEC-18 and IEC-ras cells were identical, but the gain was adjusted when imaging CCTα in IEC-ras cells due to the level of overexpression. Total cell lysates were prepared in SDS-PAGE buffer (12.5% SDS, 30 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 12.5% glycerol, and 0.01% bromphenol blue), sonicated for 20 s, and heated to 90 °C for 5 min prior to SDS-8% PAGE and transfer to nitrocellulose. Proteins were visualized by immunoblotting with primary antibodies for 1–2 h at 20 °C followed by secondary antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (enhanced chemiluminescence detection) or IRDye800 and IRDye680 (detection using an Odyssey infrared imaging system). Depending on the method, protein expression was quantified relative to load controls (actin or oxysterol-binding protein) using densitometry and ImageJ software version 1.4 or Odyssey Application software version 3.0. IEC-18, ras3, ras4, and ras7 cells were permeabilized on ice for 1 min with 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 0.25 m sucrose, 2.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, protease inhibitor mixture, and 300 mg/ml digitonin as described previously (33Lagace T.A.

Soluble and particulate membrane fractions were assayed in the presence or absence of PC/oleate vesicles by monitoring the conversion of phospho[14C]choline to CDP-[14C]choline (42Cornell R.

Schmittgen T.D. Analysis of relative gene expression data using real-time quantitative PCR and the 2−ΔΔCT method.Methods. 2001; 25: 402-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (123392) Google Scholar). Primer sets that amplify within the catalytic domain-encoded regions CCTα and CCTβ are as follows: CCTα forward, GCCCGGGCTCTGATGCAA; CCTα reverse, TGCTGCACCGCGTCGTAAC; CCTβ forward, GCAGATGTTCCAGGAGAGGAGTAG; CCTβ reverse, GAAGGGGGAGAGGTCTTGTTTG; GAPDH forward, TGATGACATCAAGGTGGTGAA; GAPDH reverse, TCCTTGGAGGCCATGTGGGCCAT. Adherent or detached ras4 cells were harvested, washed in PBS, trypsinized to reduce aggregates, and fixed in 5 ml of ethanol. Prior to analysis, cells were resuspended in PBS containing 50 μg/ml propidium iodide. Samples were analyzed using a FACSCalibur system (BD Biosciences), and cell cycle profiles were analyzed using ModiFit LT 3.0 software. IEC-18 and IEC-ras cells growing in monolayers were incubated with choline-free IEC-MEM for 2 h prior to incubation with [3H]choline (1.5 μCi/ml) for 3 h. For cells cultured in suspension on agarose monolayers, [3H]choline (1.5 μCi/ml) was added directly to dishes without a medium change for the indicated times (see the legend to Fig. 9). Cells were harvested from dishes in 1 ml of methanol/water (5:4, v/v), an aliquot was removed for protein quantification, and 3 ml of CHCl3 was added. After phase separation by centrifugation, the aqueous fraction containing CDP-choline, glycerophosphocholine (GPC), and pCholine was resolved by thin-layer chromatography in water/ethanol/ammonium hydroxide, (50:95:6, v/v/v) and visualized by spraying with 1% (w/v) phosphomolybdate in chloroform/methanol (1:1, v/v) and 1% (w/v) stannous chloride in 3 n HCl. Choline-labeled metabolites were identified using standards, and radioactivity was measured by liquid scintillation counting. [3H]Choline incorporation into PC was determined by liquid scintillation counting of an aliquot of the CHCl3 phase (>98% of radioactivity was in the [3H]PC, as determined by thin layer chromatography). A clonogenicity assay was used to measure cell viability as a function of colony formation following anchorage-independent growth on SeaPlaque agarose-coated plates for up to 72 h (44Rofstad E.K. Wahl A. Davies Cde L. Brustad T. Growth characteristics of human melanoma multicellular spheroids in liquid-overlay culture. Comparisons with the parent tumour xenografts.Cell Tissue Kinet. 1986; 19: 205-216PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, IEC-18, ras3, ras4, and ras7 cells were trypsinized, and 500 cells were seeded onto 60-mm dishes coated with 2 ml of 1% (w/v) SeaPlaque agarose in MEM. To calculate survival, an equivalent number of cells were seeded onto dishes without agarose to determine maximum colony number under adherent growth conditions. Cells cultured on agarose for 24, 48, and 72 h were transferred to plastic dishes and cultured in IEC-MEM. After 3–4 days, colonies were visualized by staining with Crystal Violet, and survival was calculated relative to adherent controls. Colony formation in soft agar was determined by spreading 500 IEC-18 or IEC-ras cells suspended in 0.3% (w/v) bacto-agar/IEC-MEM onto 60-mm dishes coated with 0.5% (w/v) agar/IEC-MEM. Colonies were counted after 3–4 days and expressed as a percentage relative to the number of colonies formed by an equivalent number of cells cultured on plastic dishes. To assess whether CCTα expression was required for solid tumor growth, ras4 cells (2 × 105 cells) transduced with lentiviral shGFP, shCCTα1, or shCCTα2 were injected into the righ"
https://openalex.org/W2010091236,"Broadly neutralizing antibodies are considered an important part of a successful HIV vaccine. A better understanding of the factors underlying their development during infection and of the epitopes they target is needed to elicit similar antibody responses by vaccination. We and others reported that, on average, it takes 2 to 3 years for cross-reactive neutralizing antibodies to become detectable in the sera of HIV-1-infected subjects and that they target a limited number of epitopes on the HIV Envelope. Here we investigated the emergence and evolution of the earliest cross-reactive neutralizing antibody specificities in one HIV-1-infected individual, AC053. We defined two distinct epitopes on Env that are targeted by the broadly neutralizing antibody responses developed by AC053. The first specificity became evident at 3 years post infection and targeted the CD4-binding site of Env. Antibodies responsible for that specificity neutralized most, but not all, viruses susceptible to neutralization by the plasma antibodies of AC053. The second specificity became apparent approximately a year later. It was due to PG9-like antibodies, which were able to neutralize those viruses not susceptible to the anti-CD4-BS antibodies in AC053. These findings improve our understanding of the co-development of broadly neutralizing antibodies that target more than one epitope during natural HIV-1-infection in selected HIV+ subjects. They support the hypothesis that developing broadly neutralizing antibody responses targeting distinct epitopes by immunization could be feasible."
https://openalex.org/W2003495051,"Little is known about the timing of activating memory for objects and their associated perceptual properties, such as colour, and yet this is important for theories of human cognition. We investigated the time course associated with early cognitive processes related to the activation of object shape and object shape+colour representations respectively, during memory retrieval as assessed by repetition priming in an event-related potential (ERP) study. The main findings were as follows: (1) we identified a unique early modulation of mean ERP amplitude during the N1 that was associated with the activation of object shape independently of colour; (2) we also found a subsequent early P2 modulation of mean amplitude over the same electrode clusters associated with the activation of object shape+colour representations; (3) these findings were apparent across both familiar (i.e., correctly coloured - yellow banana) and novel (i.e., incorrectly coloured - blue strawberry) objects; and (4) neither of the modulations of mean ERP amplitude were evident during the P3. Together the findings delineate the timing of object shape and colour memory systems and support the notion that perceptual representations of object shape mediate the retrieval of temporary shape+colour representations for familiar and novel objects."

Candidate ASGS siRNAs were designed and validated for efficacy and specificity on ryanodine receptor (RyR1) cDNA mini-constructs expressed in HEK293 cells using RT-PCR- and confocal microscopy-based assays. In vivo delivery of the most efficacious identified siRNAs into flexor digitorum brevis (FDB) muscles was achieved by injection/electroporation of footpads of 4–6 month old heterozygous Ryr1Y524S/+ (YS/+) and Ryr1I4895T/+ (IT/+) knock-in mice, established mouse models of MH with cores and CCD, respectively. Treatment of IT/+ mice resulted in a modest rescue of deficits in the maximum rate (∼38% rescue) and magnitude (∼78%) of ligand-induced Ca2+ release that occurred in the absence of a change in the magnitude of electrically-evoked Ca2+ release. Compared to the difference between the caffeine sensitivity of Ca2+ release in FDB fibers from YS/+ and WT mice treated with SCR siRNA (EC50: 1.1 mM versus 4.4 mM, respectively), caffeine sensitivity was normalized in FDB fibers from YS/+ mice following 2 (EC50: 2.8 mM) and 4 week (EC50: 6.6 mM) treatment with YS allele-specific siRNA. Moreover, the temperature-dependent increase in resting Ca2+ observed in FDB fibers from YS/+ mice was normalized to WT levels after 2 weeks of treatment with YS allele-specific siRNA. As determined by quantitative real time PCR, the degree of functional rescue in YS/+ and IT/+ mice correlated well with the relative increase in fractional WT allele expression."
https://openalex.org/W2092530632,"L. aenigmamus is endemic to the limestone formations of the Khammuan Province (Lao PDR), and is strongly specialized ecologically. From the survey of 137 individuals collected from 38 localities, we studied the phylogeography of this species using one mitochondrial (Cyt b) and two nuclear genes (BFIBR and GHR). Cyt b analyses reveal a strong mtDNA phylogeographical structure: 8 major geographical clades differing by 5-14% sequence divergence were identified, most of them corresponding to distinct karst areas. Nuclear markers display congruent results but with a less genetic structuring. Together, the data strongly suggest an inland insular model for Laonastes population structure. With 8 to 16 evolutionary significant units in a small area (about 200×50 km) this represents an exceptional example of micro-endemism. Our results suggest that L. aenigmamus may represent a complex of species and/or sub-species. The common ancestor of all Laonastes may have been widely distributed within the limestone formations of the Khammuan Province at the end of Miocene/beginning of the Pliocene. Parallel events of karst fragmentation and population isolation would have occurred during the Pleistocene or/and the end of the Pliocene. The limited gene flow detected between populations from different karst blocks restrains the likelihood of survival of Laonastes. This work increases the necessity for a strict protection of this rare animal and its habitat and provides exclusive information, essential to the organization of its protection."
https://openalex.org/W2063401491,"The way organisms allocate their resources to growth and reproduction are key attributes differentiating life histories. Many organisms spawn multiple times in a breeding season, but few studies have investigated the impact of serial spawning on reproductive allocation. This study investigated whether resource allocation was influenced by parental characteristics and prior spawning history in a serial spawning tropical damselfish (Pomacentrus amboinensis). The offspring attributes of isolated parents of known characteristics were monitored over a 6-week breeding period in the field. Smaller females produced larvae of longer length and larger energy reserves at hatching. This finding is contrary to several other studies that found larger females produce offspring of greater quality. We found that resource allocation in the form of reproductive output was not influenced by the number of spawning events within the breeding season, with larger females producing the greatest number of offspring. Larval characteristics changed as spawning progressed. There was a general decline in length of larvae produced, with an increase in the size of the larval yolk-sac, for all females regardless of size as spawning progressed. This trend was accentuated by the smallest females. This change in larval characteristics may reflect a parental ability to forecast unfavourable conditions as the season progresses or a mechanism to ensure that some will survive no matter what conditions they encounter. This study highlights the importance of accounting for temporal changes in reproductive allocation in studies of reproductive trade-offs and investigations into the importance of parental effects."
https://openalex.org/W1976915376,"Bcr and Abr are GTPase activating proteins that specifically downregulate activity of the small GTPase Rac in restricted cell types in vivo. Rac1 is expressed in smooth muscle cells, a critical cell type involved in the pathogenesis of pulmonary hypertension. The molecular mechanisms that underlie hypoxia-associated pulmonary hypertension are not well-defined.Bcr and abr null mutant mice were compared to wild type controls for the development of pulmonary hypertension after exposure to hypoxia. Also, pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells from those mice were cultured in hypoxia and examined for proliferation, p38 activation and IL-6 production. Mice lacking Bcr or Abr exposed to hypoxia developed increased right ventricular pressure, hypertrophy and pulmonary vascular remodeling. Perivascular leukocyte infiltration in the lungs was increased, and under hypoxia bcr-/- and abr-/- macrophages generated more reactive oxygen species. Consistent with a contribution of inflammation and oxidative stress in pulmonary hypertension-associated vascular damage, Bcr and Abr-deficient animals showed elevated endothelial leakage after hypoxia exposure. Hypoxia-treated pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells from Bcr- or Abr-deficient mice also proliferated faster than those of wild type mice. Moreover, activated Rac1, phosphorylated p38 and interleukin 6 were increased in these cells in the absence of Bcr or Abr. Inhibition of Rac1 activation with Z62954982, a novel Rac inhibitor, decreased proliferation, p38 phosphorylation and IL-6 levels in pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells exposed to hypoxia.Bcr and Abr play a critical role in down-regulating hypoxia-induced pulmonary hypertension by deactivating Rac1 and, through this, reducing both oxidative stress generated by leukocytes as well as p38 phosphorylation, IL-6 production and proliferation of pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells."

Exposure to the esterase immediately releases free mycolic acids, while concomitantly depleting trehalose mycolates. Moreover, lysis could be competitively inhibited by an excess of purified trehalose dimycolate and was abolished by a S124A mutation affecting the catalytic activity of the esterase.

Mycobacteria represent a group of ubiquitous and diverse bacterial species, many of which can establish chronic infections in humans (1Grange J. Mycobacteria and Human Disease. 2nd Ed. Oxford University Press, New York1996: 41-55Google Scholar). An estimated one-third of the world's population is infected by Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the etiologic agent of human tuberculosis (TB), 2The abbreviations used are: TBtuberculosisFMfree mycolic acidOADColeic acid/albumin/dextrose/catalaseTDMtrehalose dimycolateTMMtrehalose monomycolateTDMHTDM hydrolasemAGPmycolyl arabinogalactanNAnucleic acidPIMphosphatidylinositol myo-mannoside. which causes about 1.7 million deaths worldwide every year (2Dye C.

A distinct taxonomical classification for mycobacteria historically originated from their unique cellular morphology and acid-fastness, both directly attributed to their thick, hydrophobic, and atypically structured envelope (3Shinnick T.M.

The hydrophobicity of the envelope and consequently its low permeability to hydrophilic solutes contribute to a high level of intrinsic drug tolerance in mycobacteria (7Nikaido H. Jarlier V.

The mycobacterial cell envelope is broadly stratified into a plasma membrane made of phospholipids, a core cell wall complex of covalently linked mycolyl-arabinogalactan-peptidoglycan (mAGP), and a membrane-like outer layer (6Brennan P.J.

U.S.A. 2008; 105: 3963-3967Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). The lipid bilayer in the membrane-like outer layer, also referred to as mycomembrane, is formed by mycolyl chains of mAGP and hydrocarbon chains of the outermost glycolipids, noncovalently associated with the cell wall core of the envelope (6Brennan P.J. Nikaido H. The envelope of mycobacteria.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 29-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (1561) Google Scholar, 9Hoffmann C. Leis A. Niederweis M. Plitzko J.M. Engelhardt H.

U.S.A. 2008; 105: 3963-3967Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). The outermost lipids, which vary across mycobacterial species, are extractable to a detectable level without breaching envelope integrity, although genetic dispensability of only a few of these lipids is determined (10Ortalo-Magné A.

The mycolyl esters of trehalose, trehalose monomycolates (TMM) and trehalose 6,6′-dimycolate (TDM) are among the most conserved and abundant noncovalently associated lipids of the mycobacterial envelope. The nascent mycolyl chains, synthesized in the cytoplasm by fatty-acid synthase systems I and II, are esterified to trehalose to produce TMM, which is subsequently transported across the membrane by MmpL3 (11Takayama K.

The abundant pool of TMM in the envelope is then utilized as a universal mycolyl donor by secreted mycolyltransferases, antigen 85 complex (Ag85A, Ag85B, and Ag85C), toward the constitutive synthesis of mAGP and TDM (11Takayama K.

In addition, TMM is also used by the Ag85 complex to synthesize glucose monomycolate, which like other noncovalently linked mycolyl glycolipids, such as glycerol monomycolate and diarabino-dimycolyl glycerol, is produced under specific growth conditions depending on the type of carbon source in the medium (16Hattori Y.

The essential role of TMM as a precursor of mAGP, the core cell wall component, makes it an indispensable lipid for mycobacteria, as recently validated by the viability loss due to specific inhibition of its MmpL3 transporter (12Grzegorzewicz A.E. Pham H. Gundi V.A. Scherman M.S. North E.J. Hess T. Jones V. Gruppo V. Born S.E. Korduláková J. Chavadi S.S. Morisseau C. Lenaerts A.J. Lee R.E. McNeil M.R. Jackson M.

Agents Chemother. 2012; 56: 1797-1809Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). Dispensability of TDM in the envelope, however, remains unclear, although it can be extracted from the bacilli in petroleum ether without any effect on their viability (20Noll H. Bloch H. Asselineau J. Lederer E. The chemical structure of the cord factor of Mycobacterium tuberculosis.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1956; 20: 299-309Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but the extent of TDM depletion from the ether-treated bacteria remained unclear in these studies. Furthermore, TDM cannot be genetically depleted from mycobacteria due to the functional redundancies in the Ag85A, Ag85B, and Ag85C (13Belisle J.T. Vissa V.D. Sievert T. Takayama K. Brennan P.J. Besra G.S. Role of the major antigen of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in cell wall biogenesis.Science. 1997; 276: 1420-1422Crossref PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar). A mutation in ag85A leads to partial depletion of TDM in Mycobacterium smegmatis, and inactivation or inhibition of Ag85C in M. tuberculosis leads to partial loss in mycolyl content of mAGP as well as the synthesis of TDM (14Puech V. Guilhot C. Perez E. Tropis M. Armitige L.Y. Gicquel B. Daffé M.

Agents Chemother. 2012; 56: 1735-1743Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Moreover, the partial loss in the mycolyl contents of cell wall components in the ag85A mutant could be complemented by expression of Ag85B and Ag85C (14Puech V. Guilhot C. Perez E. Tropis M. Armitige L.Y. Gicquel B. Daffé M. Evidence for a partial redundancy of the fibronectin-binding proteins for the transfer of mycoloyl residues onto the cell wall arabinogalactan termini of Mycobacterium tuberculosis.Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 44: 1109-1122Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Although any of the three mycolyltransferases can be inactivated individually without affecting cellular viability, simultaneous inactivation of all three genes has not been possible. It is also noteworthy that their simultaneous intracellular depletion using antisense oligonucleotides severely retards the growth of M. tuberculosis (22Harth G. Zamecnik P.C. Tabatadze D. Pierson K. Horwitz M.A. Hairpin extensions enhance the efficacy of mycolyl transferase-specific antisense oligonucleotides targeting Mycobacterium tuberculosis.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 7199-7204Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). TDM is studied in M. tuberculosis as one of the most potent immunomodulatory and granulomatogenic surface glycolipids (23Hunter R.L. Olsen M.R. Jagannath C. Actor J.K.

Identification of trehalose dimycolate (cord factor) in Mycobacterium leprae.FEBS Lett. 2007; 581: 3345-3350Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Its constitutive abundance in nonpathogenic mycobacterial species raises the possibility that TDM and other noncovalently linked mycolyl-glycolipids could have crucial structural contributions in the integrity of the mycobacterial envelope. Recently, we identified Msmeg_1529, an M. smegmatis enzyme of the serine esterase superfamily that can hydrolyze purified TDM from various mycobacterial species, including M. tuberculosis in vitro (27Ojha A.K. Trivelli X. Guerardel Y. Kremer L. Hatfull G.F. Enzymatic hydrolysis of trehalose dimycolate releases free mycolic acids during mycobacterial growth in biofilms.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 17380-17389Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). This allowed us to question whether exogenous exposure to the purified recombinant esterase, henceforth called TDMH, may impact the integrity of the mycobacterial envelope. Here, we show that exposure to TDMH triggers an immediate release of free mycolic acids (FM) from noncovalently associated mycolyl-containing glycolipids, ultimately leading to rapid and extensive lysis of pathogenic species, such as M. tuberculosis, Mycobacterium bovis, and Mycobacterium marinum, as well as to a lesser extent of M. smegmatis and Mycobacterium avium. Although these findings highlight the structural contribution and importance of mycolyl glycolipids in the outer envelope of mycobacteria, they also open up new possibilities of improved detection and clearance of mycobacterial infections. Liquid cultures of M. tuberculosis (except mc27000), M. bovis (BCG), and M. avium were grown at 37 °C either in 7H90 ADC or Sauton's media with 0.05% Tween 80. For plate culture, 7H11 with OADC or Sauton's media agar was used. mc27000 was grown similarly, except its media contained 100 μg/ml pantothenic acid. For M. smegmatis, OADC was replaced with ADC in 7H9 broth or plate culture. M. marinum was grown at room temperature in 7H9OADC Tween 80 liquid medium or 7H11 OADC agar. Escherichia coli (DH5α) was grown at 37 °C in LB broth or LB agar. The open reading frame of TDMH, Msmeg_1529, was cloned in pET21b expression system with His6 tag, and the protein was purified on nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity column as described previously (27Ojha A.K. Trivelli X. Guerardel Y. Kremer L. Hatfull G.F. Enzymatic hydrolysis of trehalose dimycolate releases free mycolic acids during mycobacterial growth in biofilms.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 17380-17389Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Functional activity of each batch of purified TDMH was determined through turbidometric measurement of bacterial lysis as described previously (28Nelson D. Loomis L. Fischetti V.A. Prevention and elimination of upper respiratory colonization of mice by group A streptococci by using a bacteriophage lytic enzyme.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 4107-4112Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). For lytic activity, cells at OD of 0.5 (log phase) or OD of 3.0 (stationary phase) were harvested, washed, and resuspended in either phosphate-buffered saline with Tween 80 (PBST) or other culture media as required. Specified amounts of TDMH were mixed with the specified number of bacilli and incubated at 37 °C. At regular time intervals, an aliquot was diluted and plated for enumeration. An equal volume of storage buffer was used as a negative control for each experiment. For inhibition of lytic activity of the enzyme, 100 μg of either purified TDM (Sigma), purified apolar and polar lipids (27Ojha A.K. Trivelli X. Guerardel Y. Kremer L. Hatfull G.F.

To the lipid suspension, cells (107 cfu/ml) and 0.8 μm TDMH were added and incubated for 2 days at 37 °C prior to enumerating the viable bacilli. For the plate assay, 500 μl of 106 cfu/ml log phase cells was spread on a Sauton's agar plate, and 200 μg of purified TDMH were spotted in the center. An equal volume of storage buffer was spotted as a negative control on a separate plate with bacilli. M. tuberculosis mc27000 was grown to an OD of 0.5. Cells were harvested, washed with PBS, and diluted to 108 cfu/ml in PBST. 8 μm TDMH was added to 1 ml of cell suspension and rotated at 37 °C. At regular time intervals, 100 μl samples were collected, and ATP content was determined by adding 100 μl of ENLITEN luciferase/luciferin reagent (Promega), and the luminescence was measured using a Monolight 2010 luminometer. mc27000 cultures (OD of 0.5) were labeled with [14C]acetate for 6 h, washed, resuspended in 250 μl of PBST at a density of 109 cfu/ml, and mixed with either 8 μm TDMH or an equal volume of storage buffer at 37 °C. At specific time intervals, apolar and polar lipids were extracted in petroleum ether as published previously (27Ojha A.K. Trivelli X. Guerardel Y. Kremer L. Hatfull G.F.

The extracted lipids equivalent to 5000 cpm from each sample were spotted on a one-dimensional TLC and developed in either CHCl3/MeOH (97:3, v/v) for FM analysis, CHCl3/MeOH/H2O (90:10:1, v/v/v) for TDM analysis, or CHCl3/MeOH/NH4OH (80:20:2, v/v/v) for TMM analysis, as described earlier (13Belisle J.T.

For two-dimensional TLC, amounts equivalent to 35,000 counts of each sample were analyzed as described previously (27Ojha A.K. Trivelli X. Guerardel Y. Kremer L. Hatfull G.F.

For the analysis of FM release in the presence of exogenous TDM and TMM, 100 μg of TDM or 60 μg of TMM were sonicated in 100 μl of PBST prior to adding 50 μg of TDMH (corresponding to 20-fold molar excess of lipid to the enzyme) to a final volume of 125 μl. The lipid/enzyme mixture was incubated for 30 min, prior to adding it to a 125-μl suspension of 14C-labeled M. tuberculosis cells at 109 cfu/ml. [14C]TDM or [14C]TMM, equivalent to 100,000 cpm, was homogeneously suspended in the assay buffer as described earlier (27Ojha A.K. Trivelli X. Guerardel Y. Kremer L. Hatfull G.F.

The homogenate was then mixed with either 5 μg of TDMH, 5 μg of TDMH (S124A), or an equal volume of storage buffer and incubated at 37 °C for 2 h. The lipids present in the reaction mixture were then sequentially extracted with an equal volume of petroleum ether followed by dichloromethane. The organic layer was dried and analyzed on TLC developed in CHCl3/MeOH (97:3, v/v) (27Ojha A.K. Trivelli X. Guerardel Y. Kremer L. Hatfull G.F.

For determining nucleic acids, 10 μl of 107 cfu/ml M. tuberculosis (Erdman) was mixed with either 1 μl of 13 μg TDMH or 1 μl of storage buffer in PBST supplemented with 26 mm l-asparagine (PBSTA) and incubated at 37 °C. At various time intervals, the reactions were heat-inactivated at 80 °C for 20 min and centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 30 s, and 1 μl of the reaction was placed in a nanophotometer to measure the NA contents. For RT-PCR, 10 μl of 104 cfu/ml M. tuberculosis (Erdman) were mixed with either 13 μg of TDMH or an equivalent volume of storage buffer in PBSTA, incubated for 30 min at 37 °C, and then heat-inactivated at 80 °C for 20 min. After centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 30 s, 1 μl of the supernatant from the treated mixture was directly added as a template to the molecular beacon-based RT-PCR described previously (30El-Hajj H.H. Marras S.A. Tyagi S. Kramer F.R. Alland D. Detection of rifampin resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis in a single tube with molecular beacons.J. Clin.

The amplification conditions were as follows: 95 °C for 10 min, followed by 40 cycles of 95 °C for 30 s, 58 °C for 60 s, and 72 °C for 30 s in a StepOnePlus RT-PCR System (Applied Biosystems). The forward and reverse primer sequences were 5′-GAGATACTCGAGTGGCGAAC-3′ and 5′-GGCCGGCTACCCGTCGTC-3′, respectively, and the molecular beacon consisted of a 5′-fluorescein-GCGCCCGCGGCCTATCAGCTTGTTGGTGGCGC-dabcyl-3′. The statistical significance between treated and untreated samples was determined by a random intercept logistic regression model. mc27000 cells (109 cfu/ml) were mixed with 8 μm TDMH in PBST, harvested after a 12-h incubation, put on ice, and transferred to Leica EMPACT 2 (Leica Microsystems) membrane carriers (1.5 × 0.2 mm) for high pressure freezing in EMPACT 2 (Leica), at an average pressure of 2000 bars (31Studer D. Graber W. Al-Amoudi A. Eggli P. A new approach for cryofixation by high pressure freezing.J. Microsc. 2001; 203: 285-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). The frozen cells were then transferred to a freeze-substitution machine, Leica EM AFS (Leica), for a 5-day solvent substitution. Briefly, frozen samples were warmed up from −196 to −90 °C over 3 days in a precooled (−90 °C) 1% OsO4 and 0.1% uranyl acetate mixture dissolved in acetone. Samples were then gradually warmed up to room temperature over 18 h and subsequently rinsed in acetone for further resin infiltration and embedding. Ultrathin sections (65 nm) were cut with a Reichart Ultracut and laid on 300 mesh carbon-coated EM grids. The thin sections were post-stained with 2% uranyl acetate in methanol for 10 min, followed by Reynold's lead citrate (32Reynolds E.S. The use of lead citrate at high pH as an electron-opaque stain in electron microscopy.J. Cell Biol. 1963; 17: 208-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (17734) Google Scholar) for 7 min, and were examined with a Tecnai F20 electron microscope (FEI) equipped with a 4k × 4k camera (Gatan). Approximately 106 cfu/ml M. tuberculosis H37Rv were incubated with increasing concentrations of the purified recombinant TDMH for 24 h in PBST. Fig. 1A shows that viability of the population was reduced by at least 100-fold after exposure to 0.8 μm or higher concentrations of the enzyme (Fig. 1A). At a 10-fold excess concentration (8 μm), the enzyme could reduce the viability of 108 cfu/ml of bacilli in less than 2 h, but higher density (109 cfu/ml) required longer periods of exposure (Fig. 1B). We next evaluated TDMH activity in more complex chemical environments in which mycobacteria are routinely cultured or studied in the laboratory. TDMH activity varied widely from the highest in Sauton's media to the lowest in 7H9/OADC and DMEM/FCS (Fig. 1C), although no protein degradation was observed under these conditions (data not shown). Removal of the albumin-based supplement (OADC) restored TDMH activity in both the 7H9 and DMEM base but not to the levels observed in Sauton's broth medium (Fig. 1C). Because the activity in Sauton's media was even more pronounced than in PBS, we hypothesized that one or more components of Sauton's medium could potentially enhance the enzyme activity. Glycine has been previously found to sensitize mycobacteria against envelope-targeting agents like lysozyme (33Parish T. Wheeler P. Parish T. Stoker N. Mycobacteria Protocols. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ1998: 77-90Google Scholar). Although it is not clear how glycine could destabilize the cell envelope of mycobacteria, d-amino acids have been recently discovered to depolymerize amyloid-like protein fibers on the surface of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial envelopes (34Kolodkin-Gal I. Romero D. Cao S. Clardy J. Kolter R. Losick R. d-amino acids trigger biofilm disassembly.Science. 2010; 328: 627-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar). We therefore reasoned that a high concentration (26 mm) of l-asparagine (l-Asn) in Sauton's media could possibly sensitize mycobacteria to TDMH. Indeed, we found that an equivalent amount of l-Asn increases TDMH efficacy in PBST by 100-fold (Fig. 1D). To exclude the possible interference of Tween 80, known to influence the properties of mycobacterial envelope (35Van Boxtel R.M. Lambrecht R.S. Collins M.T. Effects of colonial morphology and Tween 80 on antimicrobial susceptibility of Mycobacterium paratuberculosis.Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1990; 34: 2300-2303Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), we tested the activity of TDMH in PBS"
https://openalex.org/W1980790114,"An important feature of addiction is the high drug craving that may promote the continuation of consumption. Environmental stimuli classically conditioned to drug-intake have a strong motivational power for addicts and can elicit craving. However, addicts differ in the attitudes towards their own consumption behavior: some are content with drug taking (consonant users) whereas others are discontent (dissonant users). Such differences may be important for clinical practice because the experience of dissonance might enhance the likelihood to consider treatment. This fMRI study investigated in smokers whether these different attitudes influence subjective and neural responses to smoking stimuli. Based on self-characterization, smokers were divided into consonant and dissonant smokers. These two groups were presented smoking stimuli and neutral stimuli. Former studies have suggested differences in the impact of smoking stimuli depending on the temporal stage of the smoking ritual they are associated with. Therefore, we used stimuli associated with the beginning (BEGIN-smoking-stimuli) and stimuli associated with the terminal stage (END-smoking-stimuli) of the smoking ritual as distinct stimulus categories. Stimulus ratings did not differ between both groups. Brain data showed that BEGIN-smoking-stimuli led to enhanced mesolimbic responses (amygdala, hippocampus, insula) in dissonant compared to consonant smokers. In response to END-smoking-stimuli, dissonant smokers showed reduced mesocortical responses (orbitofrontal cortex, subcallosal cortex) compared to consonant smokers. These results suggest that smoking stimuli with a high incentive value (BEGIN-smoking-stimuli) are more appetitive for dissonant than consonant smokers at least on the neural level. To the contrary, smoking stimuli with low incentive value (END-smoking-stimuli) seem to be less appetitive for dissonant smokers than consonant smokers. These differences might be one reason why dissonant smokers experience difficulties in translating their attitudes into an actual behavior change."
https://openalex.org/W1988081014,"Asthma has the potential to adversely affect children's school examination performance, and hence longer term life chances. Asthma morbidity is especially high amongst UK ethnic minority children and those experiencing social adversity, populations which also have poor educational outcomes. We tested the hypothesis that asthma adversely affects performance in national school examinations in a large cohort from an area of ethnic diversity and social deprivation.With a novel method (using patient and address-matching algorithms) we linked administrative and clinical data for 2002-2005 for children in east London aged 5-14 years to contemporaneous education and social care datasets. We modelled children's performance in school examinations in relation to socio-demographic and clinical variables. The dataset captured examination performance for 12,136 children who sat at least one national examination at Key Stages 1-3. For illustration, estimates are presented as percentage changes in Key Stage 2 results. Having asthma was associated with a 1.1% increase in examination scores (95%CI 0.4 to 1.7)%,p = 0.02. Worse scores were associated with Bangladeshi ethnicity -1.3%(-2.5 to -0.1)%,p = 0.03; special educational need -14.6%(-15.7 to -13.5)%,p = 0.02; mental health problems -2.5%(-4.1 to -0.9)%,p = 0.003, and social adversity: living in a smoking household -1.2(-1.7 to -0.6)%,p<0.001; living in social housing -0.8%(-1.3 to -0.2)% p = 0.01, and entitlement to free school meals -0.8%(-1.5 to -0.1)%,p<0.001.Social adversity and ethnicity, but not asthma, are associated with poorer performance in national school examinations. Policies to improve educational attainment in socially deprived areas should focus on these factors."
https://openalex.org/W2066572778,"Microtubule-associated proteins of the MAP1 family (MAP1A, MAP1B, and MAP1S) share, among other features, a highly conserved COOH-terminal domain approximately 125 amino acids in length. We conducted a yeast 2-hybrid screen to search for proteins interacting with this domain and identified α1-syntrophin, a member of a multigene family of adapter proteins involved in signal transduction. We further demonstrate that the interaction between the conserved COOH-terminal 125-amino acid domain (which is located in the light chains of MAP1A, MAP1B, and MAP1S) and α1-syntrophin is direct and occurs through the pleckstrin homology domain 2 (PH2) and the postsynaptic density protein 95/disk large/zonula occludens-1 protein homology domain (PDZ) of α1-syntrophin. We confirmed the interaction of MAP1B and α1-syntrophin by co-localization of the two proteins in transfected cells and by co-immunoprecipitation experiments from mouse brain. In addition, we show that MAP1B and α1-syntrophin partially co-localize in Schwann cells of the murine sciatic nerve during postnatal development and in the adult. However, intracellular localization of α1-syntrophin and other Schwann cell proteins such as ezrin and dystrophin-related protein 2 (DRP2) and the localization of the axonal node of Ranvier-associated protein Caspr1/paranodin were not affected in MAP1B null mice. Our findings add to a growing body of evidence that classical MAPs are likely to be involved in signal transduction not only by directly modulating microtubule function, but also through their interaction with signal transduction proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1994728727,"Much of the recent neuropsychological literature on false beliefs (delusions) has tended to focus on individual or single beliefs, with few studies actually investigating the relationship or co-occurrence between different types of co-existing beliefs. Quine and Ullian proposed the hypothesis that our beliefs form an interconnected web in which the beliefs that make up that system must somehow ""cohere"" with one another and avoid cognitive dissonance. As such beliefs are unlikely to be encapsulated (i.e., exist in isolation from other beliefs). The aim of this preliminary study was to empirically evaluate the probability of belief co-occurrence as one indicator of coherence in a large sample of subjects involving three different thematic sets of beliefs (delusion-like, paranormal & religious, and societal/cultural). Results showed that the degree of belief co-endorsement between beliefs within thematic groupings was greater than random occurrence, lending support to Quine and Ullian's coherentist account. Some associations, however, were relatively weak, providing for well-established examples of cognitive dissonance."
https://openalex.org/W2098346626,"Infochemical production, release and detection of (Z,E)-9,11-tetradecadienyl acetate, the major component of the pheromone of the moth Spodoptera littoralis, is achieved in a novel microfluidic system designed to mimic the final step of the pheromone biosynthesis by immobilized recombinant alcohol acetyl transferase. The microfluidic system is part of an “artificial gland”, i.e., a chemoemitter that comprises a microreactor connected to a microevaporator and is able to produce and release a pre-defined amount of the major component of the pheromone from the corresponding (Z,E)-9,11-tetradecadienol. Performance of the entire chemoemitter has been assessed in electrophysiological and behavioral experiments. Electroantennographic depolarizations of the pheromone produced by the chemoemitter were ca. 40% relative to that evoked by the synthetic pheromone. In a wind tunnel, the pheromone released from the evaporator elicited on males a similar attraction behavior as 3 virgin females in most of the parameters considered."
https://openalex.org/W2008022752,"Delayed wound healing is a serious clinical problem in patients after surgery. A recent study has demonstrated that bone marrow-derived c-kit-positive (c-kit(+)) cells play important roles in repairing and regenerating various tissues and organs. To examine the hypothesis that surgical injury induces the mobilization and recruitment of c-kit+ cells to accelerate wound healing. Mice were subjected to a left pneumonectomy. The mobilization of c-kit+ cells was monitored after surgery. Using green fluorescent protein (GFP(+)) bone marrow-transplanted chimera mice, we investigated further whether the mobilized c-kit+ cells were recruited to effect wound healing in a skin puncture model. The group with left pneumonectomies increased the c-kit(+) and CD34(+) stem cells in peripheral blood 24 h after surgery. At 3 days after surgery, the skin wound size was observed to be significantly smaller, and the number of bone marrow-derived GFP(+) cells and GFP(+)/c-kit+ cells in the wound tissue was significantly greater in mice that had received pneumonectomies, as compared with those that had received a sham operation. Furthermore, some of these GFP(+) cells were positively expressed specific markers of macrophages (F4/80), endothelial cells (CD31), and myofibroblasts (αSMA). The administration of AMD3100, an antagonist of a stromal-cell derived factor (SDF)-1/CXCR4 signaling pathway, reduced the number of GFP(+) cells in wound tissue and completely negated the accelerated wound healing. Surgical injury induces the mobilization and recruitment of c-kit+ cells to contribute to wound healing. Regulating c-kit+ cells may provide a new approach that accelerates wound healing after surgery."
https://openalex.org/W1982296422,"Flagellins evoke strong innate and adaptive immune responses. These proteins may play a key role as radioprotectors, exert antitumoral activity in certain types of tumor and reduce graft-versus-host disease in allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients. Notwithstanding, flagellins are highly immunogenic, and repeated use leads to their neutralization by systemic antibodies. This neutralization is not prevented by using functional deleted flagellins. These observations led us to explore the possibility of preventing initial neutralization by means of another functional flagellin that does not belong to common pathogenic bacteria but that has the capacity to activate TLR5. Here we characterized the functional capacity of the two-phase Marinobacter algicola (MA)-derived flagellins (F and FR) as systemic and mucosal adjuvants and compared their performance with that of Salmonella typhimurium (STF) flagellins (FljB and FliC). We also report for the first time on the in vitro and in vivo capacity of various flagellins to trigger TLR5 activation in the presence of species-specific anti-flagellin antibodies, the cross-neutralization mediated by these antibodies, and the sequential use of these flagellins for TLR5 activation. Our results showed that MA flagellins behave in a similar way to STF ones, inducing pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL8, CCL20, CCL2) and evoking a strong in vivo antibody response against a model epitope. More importantly, MA flagellins were fully functional, in vitro or in vivo, in the presence of a high concentration of neutralizing anti-flagellin STF antibodies, and STF flagellin was not inhibited by neutralizing anti-flagellin MA antibodies. The use of active flagellins from distinct bacteria could be a useful approach to prevent systemic neutralization of this group of adjuvants and to facilitate the rational design of flagellin-based vaccines and/or other therapeutic treatments (against ischemia, acute renal failure, tumors, ionizing radiations and also to improve the outcome of bone marrow transplants)."
https://openalex.org/W2076598349,"V(1)-ATPase is a rotary motor protein that rotates the central shaft in a counterclockwise direction hydrolyzing ATP. Although the ATP-binding process is suggested to be the most critical reaction step for torque generation in F(1)-ATPase (the closest relative of V(1)-ATPase evolutionarily), the role of ATP binding for V(1)-ATPase in torque generation has remained unclear. In the present study, we performed single-molecule manipulation experiments on V(1)-ATPase from Thermus thermophilus to investigate how the ATP-binding process is modulated upon rotation of the rotary shaft. When V(1)-ATPase showed an ATP-waiting pause, it was stalled at a target angle and then released. Based on the response of the V(1)-ATPase released, the ATP-binding probability was determined at individual stall angles. It was observed that the rate constant of ATP binding (k(on)) was exponentially accelerated with forward rotation, whereas the rate constant of ATP release (k(off)) was exponentially reduced. The angle dependence of the k(off) of V(1)-ATPase was significantly smaller than that of F(1)-ATPase, suggesting that the ATP-binding process is not the major torque-generating step in V(1)-ATPase. When V(1)-ATPase was stalled at the mean binding angle to restrict rotary Brownian motion, k(on) was evidently slower than that determined from free rotation, showing the reaction rate enhancement by conformational fluctuation. It was also suggested that shaft of V(1)-ATPase should be rotated at least 277° in a clockwise direction for efficient release of ATP under ATP-synthesis conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2010162601,"The extraordinary fidelity, sensory and regulatory capacity of natural intracellular machinery is generally confined to their endogenous environment. Nevertheless, synthetic bio-molecular components have been engineered to interface with the cellular transcription, splicing and translation machinery in vivo by embedding functional features such as promoters, introns and ribosome binding sites, respectively, into their design. Tapping and directing the power of intracellular molecular processing towards synthetic bio-molecular inputs is potentially a powerful approach, albeit limited by our ability to streamline the interface of synthetic components with the intracellular machinery in vivo. Here we show how a library of synthetic DNA devices, each bearing an input DNA sequence and a logical selection module, can be designed to direct its own probing and processing by interfacing with the bacterial DNA mismatch repair (MMR) system in vivo and selecting for the most abundant variant, regardless of its function. The device provides proof of concept for programmable, function-independent DNA selection in vivo and provides a unique example of a logical-functional interface of an engineered synthetic component with a complex endogenous cellular system. Further research into the design, construction and operation of synthetic devices in vivo may lead to other functional devices that interface with other complex cellular processes for both research and applied purposes."
