https://openalex.org/W2064390120,"Experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE) is an induced autoimmune disease mediated by CD4+ T lymphocytes. Analysis of T cell receptors of myelin basic protein-specific encephalitogenic T cell clones derived from six different PL/J (H-2u) or (PL/J x SJL) F1 (H-2uxs) mice revealed a limited heterogeneity in primary structure. In vivo, the majority of T lymphocytes recognize the N-terminal MBP-nonapeptide in association with I-Au and utilize the V beta 8 gene element. cDNA-sequencing showed that all T cell receptors from a panel of such T cell clones, grown in vitro, share the same V alpha gene segment. Despite heterogeneity in the D-J regions, the clones unexpectedly display a striking similarity in fine specificity. Based on these results, prevention and reversal of autoimmune disease with V beta 8-specific monoclonal antibodies was achieved."

https://openalex.org/W1977778060,"It has been proposed that chemically reactive lipids released during lipid peroxidation convert low density lipoprotein (LDL), the major carrier of plasma cholesterol, to an abnormal form and that receptor-mediated clearance of this altered LDL produces cholesteryl ester deposition in macrophage-derived foam cells of atheroma. Immuno-cytochemical analyses now reveal the presence of protein modified by malondialdehyde, a peroxidative end product, which colocalizes with the extracellular deposition of apolipoprotein B-100 protein of LDL in atheroma from Watanabe heritable hyperlipidemic rabbits. These findings provide direct evidence for the existence in vivo of protein modified by a physiological product of lipid peroxidation within arterial lesions."

https://openalex.org/W1996637686,"Experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE) is a paralytic autoimmune disease induced in susceptible animals by active immunization with myelin basic protein (MBP) or by passive transfer of MBP-specific T helper (TH) lymphocytes. We have analyzed the T cell receptor genes of 33 clonally distinct TH cells specific for a nonapeptide of MBP inducing EAE in B10.PL (H-2u) mice. All 33 TH cells used two α variable gene segments (Vα2.3, 61%; Vα4.2, 39%), the same α joining gene segment (Jα39), and two Vβ and Jβ gene segments (Vβ8.2-Jβ2.6, 79%; Vβ 13-Jβ 2.2, 21%). The anti-Vβ8 monoclonal antibody F23.1 was found to block completely recognition of the nonapeptide by Vβ8 TH cells in vitro and to reduce significantly the susceptibility of B10.PL mice to peptide-induced EAE."

https://openalex.org/W2001409949,"The ionic currents of carotid body type I cells and their possible involvement in the detection of oxygen tension (PO2) in arterial blood are unknown. The electrical properties of these cells were studied with the whole-cell patch clamp technique, and the hypothesis that ionic conductances can be altered by changes in PO2 was tested. The results show that type I cells have voltage-dependent sodium, calcium, and potassium channels. Sodium and calcium currents were unaffected by a decrease in PO2 from 150 to 10 millimeters of mercury, whereas, with the same experimental protocol, potassium currents were reversibly reduced by 25 to 50 percent. The effect of hypoxia was independent of internal adenosine triphosphate and calcium. Thus, ionic conductances, and particularly the O2-sensitive potassium current, play a key role in the transduction mechanism of arterial chemoreceptors."

https://openalex.org/W2010009395,"Gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA) mediates fast synaptic inhibition in the central nervous system by activating the chloride-permeable GABAA channel. The GABAA conductance progressively diminishes with time when the intracellular contents of hippocampal neurons are perfused with a minimal intracellular medium. This ""run down"" of the GABA-activated conductance can be prevented by the inclusion of magnesium adenosine triphosphate and calcium buffer in the intracellular medium. The amount of chloride conductance that can be activated by GABA is determined by competition between a calcium-dependent process that reduces the conductance and a phosphorylation process that maintains the conductance."
https://openalex.org/W2075640107,The crystal structure of the uncomplexed orthorhombic form of gramicidin A has been determined at 120 K and at 0.86 angstrom resolution. The pentadecapeptide crystallizes as a left-handed antiparallel double-stranded helical dimer with 5.6 amino acid residues per turn. The helix has an overall length of 31 angstroms and an average inner channel diameter of 4.80 angstroms. The channel of this crystalline form is void of ions or solvent molecules. The channel diameter varies from a minimum of 3.85 angstroms to a maximum of 5.47 angstroms and contains three pockets where the cross-channel contacts are 5.25 angstroms or greater. The range of variation seen for the φ and ψ torsion angles of the backbone of the helix suggests that these potential ion binding sites can be induced to travel the length of the channel in a peristaltic manner by cooperatively varying these angles. The indole rings of the eight tryptophan residues of the dimer are overlapped in three separate regions on the outer surface of the helix when viewed down the barrel of the channel. This arrangement would permit long-chained lipid molecules to nest parallel to the outer channel surface between these protruding tryptophan regions and act like molecular splines to constrain helical twist deformations of the channel.

The crystal structure of a gramicidin-cesium complex has been determined at 2.0 angstrom resolution. In this structure, gramicidin forms a 26 angstrom long tube comprised of two polypeptide chains arranged as antiparallel beta strands that are wrapped into a left-handed helical coil with 6.4 residues per turn. The polypeptide backbone forms the interior of the hydrophilic, solvent-filled pore and the side chains form a hydrophobic and relatively regular surface on the outside of the pore. This example of a crystal structure of a solvent-filled ion pore provides a basis for understanding the physical nature of ion translocation."
https://openalex.org/W2014595456,"Malaria is initiated by the inoculation of a susceptible host with sporozoites from an infected mosquito. The sporozoites enter hepatocytes and develop for a period as exoerythrocyte or hepatic stage parasites. Vaccination with irradiated sporozoites can provide protective immunity and a recent study shows that this can also be conferred by immunization with a recombinant salmonella expressing only the circumsporozoite protein that normally covers the sporozoites. Protection against infection is likely to be mediated by cytotoxic CD8+ cells, as depletion of CD8+ T cells in a sporozoite-immunized animal can completely abrogate immunity. Here we demonstrate directly the existence of CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) that recognize the circumsporozoite protein. B10.BR mice immunized with sporozoites or with recombinant vaccinia virus expressing the CS protein of Plasmodium falciparum contain CTL that specifically kill L cell fibroblasts transfected with the gene encoding the same CS protein. The peptide epitope from the CS protein that is recognized by CTL from this strain of mice is from a variant region of the protein."
https://openalex.org/W2028555129,"In order to assess the importance of a conserved amino acid in the VDJ junctional region of the beta chain of T cell receptors (TCRs) specific for pigeon cytochrome c, we generated T cell transfectant clones that express either a TCR identical to that of the cytochrome c-specific clone D6 or a mutated form of the D6 TCR, in which the conserved residue was replaced by one of two other amino acids. We have found that one substitution alters antigen fine specificity, while the other substitution abolishes all detectable cytochrome c response. On the basis of these findings, we propose that this conserved amino acid is a key residue in determining the antigen specificity of the D6 TCR."

An antisense MBP mini-gene was constructed and used to determine the function of antisense DNA in transgenic mice. Several transgenic offspring of a founder transgenic mouse, AS100, were converted from the normal to mutant shiverer phenotype. Antisense MBP messenger RNA was expressed in these mice, and the endogenous MBP messenger RNA, the MBP, and the myelination in the central nervous system were reduced."
https://openalex.org/W2092805876,"Primary mouse oocytes contain untranslated stable messenger RNA for tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA). During meiotic maturation, this maternal mRNA undergoes a 3′-polyadenylation, is translated, and is degraded. Injections of maturing oocytes with different antisense RNA's complementary to both coding and noncoding portions of t-PA mRNA all selectively blocked t-PA synthesis. RNA blot analysis of t-PA mRNA in injected, matured oocytes suggested a cleavage of the RNA⋅RNA hybrid region, yielding a stable 5′ portion, and an unstable 3′ portion. In primary oocytes, the 3′ noncoding region was susceptible to cleavage, while the other portions of the mRNA were blocked from hybrid formation until maturation occurred. Injection of antisense RNA complementary to 103 nucleotides of its extreme 3′ untranslated region was sufficient to prevent the polyadenylation, translational activation, and destabilization of t-PA mRNA. These results demonstrate a critical role for the 3′ noncoding region of a dormant mRNA in its translational recruitment during meiotic maturation of mouse oocytes."
https://openalex.org/W2059660734,"Protein sequence analysis of a bovine brain phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC; PLC-154) has permitted the isolation of a cDNA that appears to code for this protein. Transient expression of this cDNA in COS-1 cells demonstrates that the cDNA encodes a functional phospholipase C that migrates at approximately 150,000 daltons. A transcript of approximately 7 kb is observed in RNA derived from bovine brain and a related transcript of the same size is present in certain human cell lines. Southern blot analysis indicates that one or possibly two genes hybridize with a PLC-154 probe. Regions of homology between PLC-154 and the previously described PLC-148 allow the assignment of a putative catalytic domain to the central region of PLC-154."

https://openalex.org/W1521180689,"The specificities of four monoclonal antibodies rho 1D4, 1C5, 3A6, and 3D6 prepared by immunization of rod outer segments containing rhodopsin have been defined using synthetic peptides. All of these antibodies interact within the 18 residues at the COOH terminus of rhodopsin and recognize linear antigenic determinants of 4-11 residues. Twenty-seven synthetic peptide analogs of varying lengths of native sequence or containing single amino acid substitutions at each position of the COOH-terminal 18 residues have provided some insight into the mechanism of antigen-antibody binding. Our results clearly demonstrate that antibodies can be highly specific at key positions as shown by the loss of binding on single amino acid substitutions in the binding site. In contrast single amino acid substitutions at other positions in the binding site only affect affinity for some antibodies. Ionic interactions can dominate immunogenic determinants. Immunogenic determinants are not restricted to highly charged hydrophilic regions on the surface of a protein and may be dominated by hydrophobic interactions. Although certain side chains can dominate the interaction of the antigen with antibody, our results are in agreement with the interpretation that the free energies of all the contact points are additive and a certain free energy must be present to achieve binding. Antibodies with different specificities directed to the same region of the protein antigen can be produced in an immune response. Peptide antigens representing regions of a protein antigen bind best to the anti-protein antibody when the sequence is shortened to contain only those residues binding to the specificity site in the antibody. Cross-reactivity between protein antigens can be explained by conservation of the critical residues in the combining site."
https://openalex.org/W1558381483,"The differentiated human hepatoblastoma-derived cell line, HepG2, displayed two classes of specific membrane receptors for heparin-binding growth factor type 1 (HBGF-1). Specific membrane receptors were distinguished from nonreceptor heparin-like binding sites. Receptors with an apparent Kd of 9.2 +/- 0.9 pM and present at 15,000 +/- 900/cell correlated with HBGF-1 stimulation of HepG2 growth. Receptors with an apparent Kd of 2 +/- 0.4 nM and present at 180,000 +/- 18,000/cell correlated with inhibition of growth and changes in secretory products. Other hepatoma cell lines exhibited a simple positive mitogenic response to HBGF-1 and a single class of high affinity binding sites. HBGF-1 covalently cross-linked to hepatoma cell surface polypeptides of apparent mean molecular mass of 130 kilodaltons. At 37 degrees C, receptor-bound HBGF-1 was internalized (t 1/2 = 45 min) but not degraded for up to 6 h. The display of receptors decreased with increased cell density and expression of HBGF-1 mRNA and HBGF-1-like activity in the culture medium. Proliferating normal human hepatocytes also exhibited two classes of binding sites with affinities for HBGF-1 and apparent molecular weight similar to HepG2 cells. These results implicate HBGF-1 or homologues in human hepatoma cell growth and normal liver cell regeneration."

https://openalex.org/W87501499,"Stimulation of rat parotid acinar cells by the muscarinic cholinergic receptor agonist methacholine results in the formation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate [1,4,5)IP3) and inositol cyclic 1:2,4,5-trisphosphate [c1:2,4,5)IP3) which, after 40 min, accumulate to a ratio of 1:0.57. The turnover rates of these inositol trisphosphates have been determined in cholinergically stimulated rat parotid cells by measuring the degradation of the 3H-labeled compounds following receptor blockade. (1,4,5)IP3 is rapidly metabolized, with a half-time of 7.6 s; (c1:2,4,5)IP3 declines much more slowly with a half-time of almost 10 min. Because the formation and metabolism of (c1:2,4,5)IP3 are so slow, (c1:2,4,5)IP3 gradually accumulates upon prolonged receptor activation. Inositol trisphosphate turnover was compared to the receptor-mediated changes in cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentration, as measured by the fluorescent Ca2+ indicator, fura-2. The Ca2+ signal decays upon termination of inositol phosphate formation and returns to base line within 30 s. Thus, while (c1:2,4,5)IP3 may have some yet unknown biological effects on Ca2+ homeostasis, its metabolism seems far too slow to be the primary regulator of cytosolic Ca2+ levels under long term stimulatory conditions. The rate at which the Ca2+ signal decays is, however, somewhat slowed after prolonged agonist stimulation. Furthermore, the capacity of the cells to mobilize intracellular Ca2+ in response to a second agonist stimulation is slightly delayed when the duration of the first stimulus is prolonged. The results suggest that the regulation of cytoplasmic Ca2+ levels may be more complicated than initially realized and could depend on the combined actions of more than one inositol polyphosphate."
https://openalex.org/W2084566718,DNA can form structures other than the Watson-Crick double helix. The potential contributions to gene regulation from one such structure have been investigated by assembling a promoter capable of adopting cruciform base-pairing. Transcription from this promoter by RNA polymerase in vitro was repressed as the cruciform was extruded by increasing negative DNA supercoiling. Transcription in vivo was induced as supercoiling was relaxed by growth in conditions that inhibit DNA gyrase. A DNA conformational change is therefore capable of regulating the initiation of transcription.

https://openalex.org/W1599885475,"Lipocortins 1 and 2 are major substrates for the epidermal growth factor receptor and the pp60v-src tyrosine kinases in transformed cells. In the present study, we have characterized the phosphorylation of lipocortins 1 and 2 by the insulin receptor tyrosine kinase in vitro and in vivo. In vitro, the solubilized insulin receptor, partially purified from rat liver, catalyzed phosphorylation of human recombinant lipocortin 1 and purified bovine lipocortin 2. Phosphorylation of lipocortin 1 was increased 15-fold upon stimulation with 10(-7) M insulin. The apparent Km of the reaction was 3.3 microM and was not affected by insulin stimulation. Insulin stimulated phosphate incorporation into lipocortin 2 by 20-fold (apparent Km greater than 20 microM). Both lipocortins were phosphorylated exclusively on tyrosine residues as judged by phosphoamino acid analysis. Based upon peptide mapping, lipocortin 1 was phosphorylated on Tyr-21, a site phosphorylated by other tyrosine kinases. Polyclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies recognized the tyrosine-phosphorylated lipocortin 2, but not lipocortin 1 in its phosphorylated form. In hepatocytes from normal and dexamethasone-treated rats, lipocortin 1 content was less than 50 ng/10(6) cells. Insulin-induced phosphorylation of lipocortin 1 was detected in intact hepatocytes from corticosteroid-treated animals but not in cells from normal rats. No phosphorylation of lipocortin 2 was found, although its content was approximately 100 ng/10(6) cells from normal animals and increased to approximately 1 microgram/10(6) cells following treatment of rats with dexamethasone for 4 days. Thus, although lipocortins 1 and 2 are in vitro substrates of the insulin receptor kinase, only lipocortin 1 is phosphorylated in an insulin-dependent manner in intact hepatocytes, and this is only observed after dexamethasone treatment of the rats."
https://openalex.org/W1583752346,"Albumin and alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), two major serum proteins, are synthesized predominantly in the liver and yolk sac of mammals. In the present paper we report on the developmental expression of the corresponding genes in nonhepatic rat tissues. Significant quantities of mature albumin and AFP mRNAs were revealed in kidney, pancreas, heart, and lung of fetal and/or newborn rats using dot blot and Northern blot assays. Very low levels of these mRNA sequences were also detected in adult kidney and pancreas using sensitive RNA-cDNA solution hybridization assays. In situ hybridization analysis revealed that the albumin and AFP gene transcripts are present in the tubular cells of the 20-day-old fetal kidney. In order to elucidate further the mechanisms governing this expression, we studied the chromatin structure and methylation pattern in the 5'-end of these two genes. A faint band, corresponding to a specific DNase I-hypersensitive site upstream from the albumin gene, was detected in the fetal and neonatal kidney nuclei but not in adult kidney. For both genes, a site CG, demethylation of which is correlated with expression in liver and hepatoma cell lines, is highly methylated in fetal kidney even though AFP and albumin genes are expressed. Taken together, these results show the presence of a cell population in the rat kidney that actively transcribes both the albumin and AFP genes. The expression of these genes may be mediated by mechanisms differing in at least some steps from those exerted in the liver."
https://openalex.org/W1978532589,"Although the proteinase inhibitor alpha-2-antiplasmin (α2AP) is known to control the activity of plasmin through rapid formation of stable complexes, it also efficiently inactivates chymotrypsin. These interactions are shown to occur at adjacent, overlapping sites so that plasmin attacks the inhibitor at an Arg364-Met365 peptide bond, while chymotrypsin interacts at a Met365-Ser366 sequence one residue downstream. Thus, a naturally occurring plasma serine proteinase inhibitor can have multiple specificities through interactions at adjacent sites. It also illustrates the potential flexibility of the reactive site loop in this class of inhibitors."
https://openalex.org/W1491081581,"Au(DPPE)+2 (bis[1,2-bis(diphenylphosphino)ethane] gold(I] is an organo-gold antineoplastic agent that has anti-tumor activity in a variety of in vitro cell lines and in vivo rodent tumor models. Preliminary studies suggested that this compound represented a novel class of inhibitors of mitochondrial function. The purpose of this study was, therefore, to determine the mechanism of mitochondrial dysfunction induced by Au(DPPE)+2. Au(DPPE)+2 induced a rapid, dose-related collapse of the inner mitochondrial membrane potential (EC50 = 28.0 microM) that was not potentiated by Ca2+ preloading. Au(DPPE)+2-induced dissipation of mitochondrial membrane potential was accompanied by an efflux of Ca2+ from mitochondria upon exposure to Au(DPPE)+2. Ca2+ efflux in these experiments was via a reversal of the Ca2+ uniporter as efflux could be inhibited with ruthenium red. Au(DPPE)+2 did not increase the permeability of mitochondria to oxalacetate, indicating that the collapse of membrane potential may not be a result of gross increased inner membrane permeability. However, Au(DPPE)+2 may mediate an increased permeability of the inner membrane to cations and protons. Au(DPPE)+2 caused passive swelling in potassium acetate buffer in the absence of valinomycin, suggesting Au(DPPE)+2 facilitated the exchange of H+ and K+. Ca2+ cycling was not extensive and did not contribute to the decrease in membrane potential. These data suggest that one possible mechanism of Au(DPPE+2-induced uncoupling of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation is via increased permeability of the inner mitochondrial membrane to cations. The disruption of mitochondrial function may be a key process leading to hepatocyte cell injury by this drug."
https://openalex.org/W1608891501,"The asialoglycoprotein receptor (AsGR) is characteristic of fully differentiated hepatocytes. AsGR expression in confluent cultures of HepG2 cells grown in minimal essential medium (MEM) requires a 300-350-dalton dialyzable fraction of fetal bovine serum (FBS). Addition to dialyzed FBS (dFBS) of 10(-7) M biotin or biocytin (Mr 372) permitted full expression of AsGR by HepG2. Affinity chromatography of FBS on streptavidin-Sepharose abolished its ability to support AsGR production. The bound material, when released by heat denaturation and resolved by thin layer chromatography, yielded three cinnamaldehyde-positive components, of which the major detectable one migrates with authentic biocytin and reconstitutes dFBS. Sera from several species, which do not support AsGR production by HepG2, contain less than 10% biotin found in FBS as determined by direct enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. These results indicate that biotin or a derivative is the low molecular weight serum factor of FBS required for expression of AsGR. Isolation of messenger RNA from HepG2 revealed no difference in AsGR transcripts when cells were grown in MEM-10% FBS or MEM-10% dFBS. Thus a biotin-dependent post-transcriptional event permits the ultimate expression of the AsGR by HepG2 cells."
https://openalex.org/W1695236527,"Two monoclonal antibodies against the receptor for platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) were obtained by immunizing mice with pure PDGF receptor preparations derived from porcine uterus. The antibodies, denoted PDGFR-B1 and PDGFR-B2, both bound to the external domain of the receptor, as demonstrated by indirect immunofluorescence and binding of 125I-labeled antibodies to intact human fibroblasts. Both antibodies precipitated pure 175-kDa 32P-labeled autophosphorylated porcine PDGF receptor as well as a Mr 175,000 glycoprotein from metabolically labeled cells. The monoclonal antibodies did not inhibit binding of 125I-PDGF to human fibroblasts and did not stimulate these cells to undergo mitosis. Both antibodies induced clustering and down-regulation of their antigen. However, this resulted in only a partial loss of cell surface binding sites for PDGF itself, consistent with the conclusion that the monoclonals recognized only one of two or several receptors for PDGF. Clustering and down-regulation were not seen when the cells were incubated with monovalent Fab' fragments of the PDGFR-B2 antibody. The antibodies also stimulated autophosphorylation of pure PDGF receptor, and PDGFR-B2 was shown to stimulate phosphorylation of phosphofructokinase, an exogenous substrate for the PDGF receptor kinase. High concentrations of PDGFR-B2 antibody, or Fab' fragments thereof, failed to enhance the PDGF receptor kinase activity, compatible with the possibility that dimerization was of importance in the antibody-stimulated kinase activity of purified PDGF receptors."
https://openalex.org/W1679869818,"To provide a more definitive characterization of the hydroxylapatite-associated proteoglycans (HAPG) of bone, proteins were extracted from the mineralized matrix of fetal porcine calvaria with 0.5 M EDTA in the absence of guanidine HCl. The small proteoglycans obtained in the extract were fractionated by gel filtration on Sepharose CL-6B, purified by ion-exchange chromatography on Polyanion matrix (fast protein liquid chromatography), and then separated into three major populations of chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans by chromatography on hydroxylapatite, all in the presence of 7 M urea. Based on immunological and chemical properties, two classes of bone proteoglycan were resolved. In one class (HAPG1), the proteoglycan and specific CNBr-derived peptides cross-reacted with three monoclonal antibodies that recognize different epitopes of the protein core of bovine skin proteodermatan sulfate. The other class of proteoglycan included two species (HAPG2, HAPG3) which were not recognized by these antibodies. In addition, these proteoglycans did not stain with Coomassie Blue R-250 nor with silver stain nor did they bind to nitrocellulose membranes used in Western blots. However, the cationic dye Stains-all stained both HAPG2 and HAPG3; the protein cores of these proteoglycans were stained a characteristic turquoise blue, whereas the protein core of HAPG1 was stained pink. The average Mr values of the bone proteoglycans, from gradient sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis were: HAPG1, 120,000, with a protein core (chondroitinase AC-digested) of 45,000; HAPG2 and HAPG3, 110,000, with protein cores of 37,000-38,000. On 15% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, the protein cores of HAPG2 and HAPG3 migrated with an Mr 30,000, while HAPG1 protein core was unchanged (Mr 45,000). Based on amino acid analysis, the protein chains of HAPG2 and HAPG3 appear to be identical, although minor differences in the relative amount of glucosamine were evident. In contrast, the composition of HAPG1 was quite different, with higher relative amounts of hydrophobic and aromatic residues and lower amounts of Asx and Glx. The presence of 360 residues/1,000 of Asx and Glx in HAPG2 and HAPG3 may in part explain the characteristic staining and immunotransfer properties of these proteoglycans. The unique amino-terminal sequence of HAPG2 (Asn-Pro-Val-Ala-Arg-Tyr-Gln), together with the immunological and chemical properties, would indicate that HAPG2 and HAPG3 are novel proteoglycans and, unlike HAPG1, could be unique to mineralized tissues."
https://openalex.org/W1507910436,"Platelet membrane glycoprotein (GP) IIb-IIIa is a component of a receptor for the adhesive proteins fibrinogen, fibronectin, and von Willebrand factor. GPIIb is initially synthesized as a single-chain polypeptide that is proteolytically processed to yield the two chains of mature GPIIb present on the cell surface. Analysis of the amino acid sequence surrounding the proposed light-heavy chain junction of GPIIb suggests a second potential site following a pair of basic residues 12-15 residues upstream from the reported amino terminus of the light chain. We have utilized anti-peptide antibodies to examine the possibility of alternative cleavage at these two potential sites. Peptide V43 precedes the dibasic sequence and is known to reside in the heavy chain. Peptide V41 contains the sequence between the two potential sites. In immunoblots, anti-V43 reacted only with the heavy chain while anti-V41 reacted only with the light chain. Immunoprecipitation of surface-labeled platelets indicated 97% of the GPIIb light chain contains the V41 sequence while approximately 3% of GPIIb molecules lack the V41 sequence on both the light and heavy chains. These data indicate that GPIIb is primarily cleaved 12-15 amino acids upstream from the reported amino terminus of the light chain while in a minor proportion of GPIIb molecules cleavage occurs at both sites."
https://openalex.org/W2075956834,"It has been assumed that uptake of extracellular Ca2+ occurs through ligand-activated Ca2+ channels in anti-IgM stimulated human B cells. If so, then uptake should be associated with a depolarizing inward current. Instead, a hyperpolarization due to Ca2+-sensitive K+ conductance is observed. To demonstrate conductive Ca2+ channels in human B lymphocytes, we loaded the cells with 1,2-bis-(2-aminophenoxy)-ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetate (BAPTA), an intracellular Ca2+ chelating agent. This increased the magnitude of the Ca2+ current and delayed the Ca2+-dependent K+ conductance. In BAPTA-loaded B cells suspended in Ca2+-free medium and activated with anti-IgM, reintroduction of Ca2+ resulted in a depolarization that was inhibited by high (microM) concentrations of verapamil and was observed when Ca2+ was replaced by Ba2+ but not Mg2+. These data demonstrate the opening of selective, Ca2+ conductive channels in human B cells following cross-linking of surface immunoglobulins."

https://openalex.org/W1559431187,"Proteins putatively involved in the transcriptional control of rat (alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) gene expression in the liver were identified by analyzing the in vitro binding of proteins from nuclear extracts of fetal and adult rat livers to the cloned rat AFP promoter region (-197 to +48) using a combination of gel shift and DNase I footprinting assays. Three stable and specific high affinity complexes (I, II, and III) were detected by gel shift analysis of fetal rat liver extracts. Complex II was specific to extracts from fetal liver while the two others (I and III) were also formed with extracts from adult liver. Complex I was highly liver-specific since it was not detected with extracts of kidney, spleen, and brain. DNase I and gel shift competition experiments using a synthetic oligonucleotide indicated that it is formed upon binding of a liver-specific factor to region -65 to -46 of the rat AFP promoter. This region, perfectly conserved in the rat, mouse, and man, had been previously shown to be crucial for liver-specific expression of the mouse AFP gene. The binding of this liver-specific factor to this DNA region may thus represent a key step in the specificity of expression of AFP gene in liver. Gel shift and DNase I footprinting competition experiments showed that complex III was formed by binding of the widely distributed nuclear factor I to the rat AFP promoter in the region -125 to -100. It is potentially significant that, in extracts from fetal liver, nuclear factor is also involved with another binding factor in the formation of the stage-specific complex II."

In the presence of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase, species of both a tDNA(Phe) synthesized with a 3' terminal riboadenosine and a tDNA(Lys) containing only deoxynucleotides could be aminoacylated with the appropriate amino acids, although the Michaelis constant Km and observed maximal rate Vmax values for aminoacylation were increased by three- to fourfold and decreased by two- to threefold, respectively.

Divalent cations such as Ba2+, Sr2+, Ca2+, and Mg2+ are effective binding inhibitors in the 2-5 mM range. ROS 17/2.8 cells express a channel on the apical plasma membrane which conducts Ba2+ and Ca2+. With 110 mM BaCl2 or CaCl2 as charge carriers the single channel conductance is 3-5 picosiemens. In cell-excised patches the channel selects for Ba2+ over Na+ 3.3:1. In the absence of divalent ions the channel conducts Na+ ions with a single channel conductance of 13 picosiemens. This Na+ conductance decreases with physiological levels of Ca2+. The channel appears related to the (-)-[3H]DMV binding site, since its conductance is blocked by verapamil in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, DMV blocks the channel stereoselectively with relative potencies of the isomers corresponding to their affinities for the binding site. The dihydropyridine drugs BAY K 8644 or (+)-202-791 do not affect channel opening. These binding and biophysical data indicate that osteoblast cells have a phenylalkylamine receptor associated with a Ca2+ channel."
https://openalex.org/W1571193258,"Immunochemical studies were designed to localize antigenic regions recognized by two monoclonal antibodies directed against the alpha-subunit of human choriogonadotropin (hCG-alpha) and to provide information on the three-dimensional structure of hCG and its alpha-subunit. Monoclonal antibody HT13 bound to a region accessible on both hCG and the free alpha-subunit, whereas monoclonal antibody AHT20 recognized a site localized only on the free alpha-subunit. By studying the cross-reactivity of these antibodies to homologous proteins, we found that antibody HT13 did not bind to equine or ovine lutropin, whereas AHT20 was capable of binding to both subunits. This observation suggests that AHT20 recognized a structurally related antigenic determinant on alpha-subunits of different species. To delineate the portions of hCG-alpha contributing to the antigenic determinants of AHT20 and HT13, we performed competitive inhibition assays using reduced and carboxymethylated hCG-alpha, deglycosylated hCG-alpha, hCG-alpha minus the 5 COOH-terminal residues (hCG-alpha core 1), or disulfide-bridged peptides comprising residues 1-35 and 52-91 of hCG-alpha (hCG-alpha core 2). Reduced and carboxymethylated hCG-alpha did not inhibit the binding of 125I-labeled hCG-alpha to both antibodies, whereas deglycosylated hCG-alpha was as active as hCG-alpha, suggesting that antigenic determinants of both antibodies are mainly discontinuous and do not reside on the oligosacharide part of the alpha-subunit. hCG-alpha core 1 had the same capacity as intact hCG-alpha to inhibit the binding of 125I-hCG-alpha to both antibodies, indicating that the 5 COOH-terminal residues of hCG-alpha do not participate in the antigenic determinants. hCG-alpha core 1 was as potent as hCG-alpha in inhibition experiments performed with HT13, whereas, in striking contrast, hCG-alpha core 2 did not compete with 125I-hCG-alpha for binding to AHT20, suggesting that the peptides released after proteolysis of the alpha-subunit by trypsin participate in the epitope of AHT20 and are not included in the antigenic determinant of HT13. In an attempt to elucidate the amino acid residues constituting the antigenic sites of HT13 and AHT20, hapten inhibition experiments were carried out using as competitive inhibitors five different synthetic peptides spanning the primary structure of hCG-alpha. None of these peptides inhibited the binding of 125I-hCG-alpha to HT13. In contrast, two peptides analogous to regions 23-43 and 33-59 of hCG-alpha exhibited significant potency in competing with 125I-hCG-alpha for binding to AHT20.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
https://openalex.org/W1579684397,"A 55-amino acid segment, normally present between residues 241 and 295 of the 348-residue gene I protein of the filamentous bacteriophage f1, acts as an internal signal sequence for gene I protein or, when present in fusion proteins, for EcoRI endonuclease or alkaline phosphatase. The resulting proteins are inserted so that they span the membrane with sequences on the amino side of the 55-residue segment in the cytoplasm and those near the carboxy side outside the cytoplasmic membrane. The presence of these proteins in the membrane results in the rapid inhibition of cell growth, probably from a loss of the membrane potential. We describe some of the elements in this 55-residue segment that appear to be crucial for its interaction with the membrane."
https://openalex.org/W54184629,"In order to study antigenic site(s) present in the carboxyl-terminal part of the alpha-subunit of human choriogonadotropin (hCG-alpha), we attempted to produce site-specific antibodies directed against a 34-residue synthetic peptide analogous to region 59-92 of hCG-alpha. From a fusion experiment performed with a mouse injected with hCG-alpha-(59-92)-peptide conjugated to tetanus toxoid as immunogen, we selected a monoclonal antipeptide antibody (designated FA36) which has high binding activity for 125I-hCG-alpha but not for 125I-hCG in a radioimmunoassay. This antibody is of the IgG1 subclass and displays an affinity constant for 125I-hCG-alpha of 3.1 x 10(8) M-1. Hapten inhibition experiments performed by either radioimmunoassay or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with synthetic peptides spanning different portions of the region (59-92) demonstrated that the binding site of FA36 resides on (minimally) the six COOH-terminal amino acids of hCG-alpha, namely Cys-Tyr-Tyr-His-Lys-Ser, and that FA36 binds preferentially to peptides containing a carboxyl group on the COOH-terminal residue. Monoclonal immunoradiometric assays were established to determine the location of antigenic regions recognized by FA36, by antibody AHT20 (which binds only to hCG-alpha), and by antibody HT13 (which binds to both hCG and hCG-alpha). FA36 has the capacity to bind to hCG-alpha bound to either AHT20 or HT13, demonstrating that both AHT20 and HT13 antibodies are directed against antigenic regions distinct from the epitope of FA36. Monoclonal immunoradiometric assays were also carried out to study the binding of FA36 to hCG, the ovine and equine lutropin alpha-subunit, or hCG-alpha minus the 5 COOH-terminal residues (hCG-alpha core). Whereas significant binding of 125I-FA36 was observed with the ovine lutropin alpha-subunit, no binding was found with the equine lutropin alpha-subunit. As expected, FA36 did not bind to hCG-alpha core. Binding was also not detected with hCG, confirming that FA36 is specific for free hCG-alpha and that the COOH-terminal part of hCG-alpha is either weakly or (more likely) not at all accessible in the alpha/beta-dimer for antibody binding. Finally, immunoblots performed on hCG-alpha-(59-62)-peptide and various denatured alpha-subunits indicated that, with the exception of the equine lutropin alpha-subunit, FA36 detected various denatured alpha-subunits and particularly the alpha-subunit of carp gonadotropin-thyrotropin. This latter observation suggests a high degree of homology between the COOH-terminal regions of the alpha-subunits of fish gonadotropin and analogous mammalian hormones.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
https://openalex.org/W1539404498,"The effects of heparin and various related polysaccharides on the circular dichroic spectra of fibronectin and its 31-kDa NH2-terminal tryptic fragment were studied. These effects were evaluated with respect to (i) spectral features of the native proteins that are sensitive to pH denaturation and breaking of disulfide bonds, (ii) sensitivity of spectral changes to Ca2+, and (iii) the fibronectin-dependent interfacial interaction known as translocation. We found that native heparin causes an attenuation of the positive CD peak at 228 nm with both the intact protein and the fragment, and causes a small but reproducible red shift in the spectrum of the fragment. All of these changes are analogous to spectral changes seen with denaturation or reduction of the proteins. In contrast to the situation with the intact protein, the heparin-induced spectral changes in the fragment were abolished in the presence of 10 mM Ca2+. Desulfation of heparin lessened or destroyed its ability to induce these changes, and carboxymethylated heparin and dextran sulfate induced different kinds of spectral alterations. Fibronectin and heparin determinants required for the induction of the characteristic spectral shift of the NH2-terminal domain corresponded to those required for matrix-driven translocation, suggesting that the associated conformational change in fibronectin plays a role in this biophysical effect."
https://openalex.org/W1573475269,"Monoclonal antibodies 10-F-1, directed against the K4 region of plasminogen, and 10-V-1, directed against the K1-3 region of plasminogen, were adducted to colloidal gold. These antibody-gold adducts bound specifically to alpha 2-macroglobulin (alpha 2M)-plasmin. Greater than 90% of the apparent binding was eliminated when alpha 2M-methylamine was substituted for the alpha 2M-plasmin. The plasmin epitope recognized by 10-F-1 was identified at the extreme pole of the alpha 2M-plasmin complex, suggesting that plasmin protrudes from the end of the hollow cylinder formed by alpha 2M. The complexes formed between alpha 2M-plasmin and 10-V-1 were indistinguishable from those formed with 10-F-1. This suggests that exposure of plasmin surface structure in alpha 2M-plasmin, while substantial, may be limited to the single region of the inhibitor. Evidence for ternary complexes containing one alpha 2M and two plasmin molecules was obtained in the form of antibody-gold bound at both poles of alpha 2M-plasmin. The fraction of alpha 2M-plasmin that associated with more than one antibody was small. The data presented here are considered in relation to current models of alpha 2M structure and function."
https://openalex.org/W1532674759,"Mice were immunized with human red cell glucose transporter for production of monoclonal antibodies. Four peptides were synthesized that correspond to relatively hydrophilic segments of the human HepG2 glucose transporter (Mueckler, M., Caruso, C., Baldwin, S.A., Panico, M., Blench, I., Morris, H.R., Allard, W. J., Lienhard, G.E., and Lodish, H.F. (1985) Science 229, 941-945), including a C-terminal segment. After identification of hybridomas that were positive for the red cell glucose transporter, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays were done with the synthetic peptides in solution to detect peptide-binding monoclonals. The very hydrophilic C-terminal peptide 478-492 (P2), but no other peptide, gave strong and selective inhibition of antibody binding to the glucose transporter. Two C-terminal-specific monoclonal antibodies were selected. The binding of these two antibodies to immobilized inside-out vesicles of human red cell membranes could be inhibited with the peptide P2. The antibodies did not react with right-side-out vesicles. The binding of these C-terminal-specific antibodies to the glucose transporter, to immobilized vesicles, and to the peptide P2 was enhanced by the presence of the peptide 218-232 (P1), although the peptide P1 alone showed no reaction with these antibodies. This suggests that the C terminus and the segment 218-232 of the red cell glucose transporter are exposed at the cytoplasmic face of the membrane and interact in the transporter. The C-terminal-specific monoclonal antibodies reacted strongly in Western blotting with the human red cell glucose transporter."

https://openalex.org/W2405412583,"We have identified the Factor VIII amino acid sequence Asp-Tyr-Asp-Asp-Thr-Ile-Ser (1663-1669) as the binding site of a Factor VIII activity neutralizing antibody (28 Bethesda units/mg). The binding site of another neutralizing antibody (10 Bethesda units/mg) overlapped only at Asp1663 and Tyr1664, whereas an antibody with minimal neutralizing activity (0.2 Bethesda units/mg) bound only at Asp1665-Ser1669. Residues comprising antibody binding sites were determined by blocking Factor VIII neutralization and/or binding to insolubilized Factor VIII with overlapping peptides, or with variant peptides in which a single amino acid was deleted or replaced with glycine. Eight additional antibodies to flanking sequences, and with similar affinities for Factor VIII, had little or no neutralizing activity (0-3.0 Bethesda units/mg). These studies suggest that Asp1663 and Tyr1664 may be structural features important to Factor VIII function."
