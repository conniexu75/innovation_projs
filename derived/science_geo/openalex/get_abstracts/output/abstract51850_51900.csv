https://openalex.org/W1797288361,"NADPH-cytochrome c reductase in rat liver microsomes was solubilized by bromelain digestion and purified to homogeneity. An antibody preparation obtained by immunization with this enzyme was found to inhibit the NADPH-cytochrome c reductase activity of both the purified enzyme and intact microsomes by more than 90%. This antibody also inhibited the NADPH-dependent peroxidation of microsomal lipid which occurs in the presence of ferric ion chelated by ADP (ADP-Fe). The bromelain-solubilized reductase will also promote NADPH-dependent peroxidation of extracted microsomal lipid, but only if ferric ion chelated by ethylenediaminetetraaacetate (EDTA-Fe) is included in the reaction mixture. The optimal conditions for this reaction are those required for the optimal reduction of EDTA-Fe by the purified reductase. Other ferric ion chelators, regardless of whether or not they promoted the reduction of ferric ion, would not replace EDTA in promoting lipid peroxidation. A purified preparation of the microsomal enzyme, NADH-cytochrome b5 reductase, which reduces EDTA-Fe, will also promote the peroxidation of extracted microsomal lipid. Intact microsomes, in the presence of ADP-Fe, are specific for NADPH instead of NADH in promoting the peroxidation of microsomal lipids; however, in the presence of both EDTA-Fe and ADP-Fe, both NADH and NADPH promote lipid peroxidation. These results indicate that the NADPH-dependent peroxidation of microsomal lipid involves the activity of NADPH-cytochrome c reductase, and suggest that an additional microsomal electron transport component is involved. The function of this additional component in the lipid peroxidation reaction can apparently be replaced by EDTA-Fe."

Organochlorine pesticides and polychlorinated biphenyl residues were two to eight times higher in tissues of premature parturient females and pups than in similar tissues of full-term parturient females and pups collected on San Miguel Island in 1970.

https://openalex.org/W1521356588,"Abstract Synthesis of prolactin was measured in a clonal strain of functional pituitary cells in culture by incubating the cells with [3H]leucine; labeled prolactin was separated from the other labeled proteins by specific immunoprecipitation followed by dissociation with sodium dodecyl sulfate and disc gel electrophoresis. Accumulation of labeled prolactin in the cells was linear for at least 1 hour; labeled prolactin was released into the culture medium after 1 hour. Treatment with 28 nm thyrotropin-releasing hormone for 3 days increased prolactin accumulation in the medium 2.5-fold, and the increased synthesis of prolactin completely accounted for the increased accumulation. Treatment with 5 x 10-6 m hydrocortisone for 7 days decreased prolactin accumulation in the medium 2- to 5-fold, and the decrease in synthesis completely accounted for the decreased accumulation. Therefore the long term (3 to 7 days) effects on these cells of thyrotropinreleasing hormone and hydrocortisone result only in a change in the synthesis of prolactin and not in its rate of degradation. Pulse-chase experiments, using 10 µg per ml of cycloheximide or 10 mm leucine to block further incorporation of [3H]leucine into prolactin, show that there is no detectable degradation of prolactin under the usual conditions of culture. Incubation with 0.1 mm leucine does not prevent incorporation of radioactive leucine into prolactin and results in a 1.7-fold increase in labeled prolactin within 4 hours after the start of the chase. This result suggests there are two intracellular pools of leucine in GH cells, one of which does not appear to equilibrate readily with the medium."

https://openalex.org/W1539671198,"Abstract Some properties of particulate and detergent-dispersed preparations of adenylate cyclase from rat brain have been studied. The activity of the particulate enzyme was greater with Mn2+ than with Mg2+ and the activity in the presence of either cation was enhanced by F- or nonionic detergents. In the presence of the non-ionic detergent Lubrol-PX, enzyme activity was further enhanced by dithiothreitol but inhibited by F-. Adenylate cyclase activity was dispersed into a 27,000 x g for 20 min supernatant fraction by Lubrol-PX. Inclusion of dithiothreitol in the homogenizing medium facilitated the solubilization of enzyme activity. More total activity was extracted from cerebellum than from cerebrum. The activity of the dispersed enzyme was essentially unchanged by filtration (0.22-µm pore) or by centrifugation at 100,000 x g for 1 hour. Separation of the detergent from the enzyme by gel filtration resulted in a turbid fraction, the activity of which was increased by F- or Lubrol-PX. Detergent-dispersed adenylate cyclase was inhibited by Ca2+, the degree of inhibition being dependent on whether Mg2+ or Mn2+ was present. In the presence of 8 mm Mg2+, ethylene glycol bis(β-aminoethyl ether)-N,N'-tetraacetic acid (EGTA) markedly decreased enzyme activity. The concentration causing 50% inhibition was dependent on protein concentration, but was usually about 30 µm. The inhibition by EGTA was completely prevented by the addition of an equimolar concentration of Ca2+, Mn2+, or Co2+, and was partially prevented by several other divalent cations. Gel chromatographic removal of EGTA from an inhibited enzyme completely restored activity. EDTA and several other metal-binding agents, at concentrations up to 1 mm, had little or no effect on adenylate cyclase activity. EGTA had no appreciable effect on either ATPase or cyclic 3':5'-nucleotide phosphodiesterase activities from brain or on adenylate cyclase activity prepared from partially purified plasma membranes from liver. The data suggest that adenylate cyclase from brain requires some metal in addition to added Mg2+ for full expression of activity and that the metal is bound tightly to the enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1510533209,"Abstract α-d-Mannosidase has been found to be a component of Golgi membranes of rat liver, other glycosidases being of low or negligible activity except for N-acetyl-β-d-glucosaminidase, which is readily released from the membranes by 0.4 m NaCl. The mannosidase is not appreciably extracted from the membranes by 0.4 m NaCl or by 1% Triton X-100 but is released by 0.5% deoxycholate. In addition to its distinctive subcellular localization, the Golgi enzyme is clearly distinguishable from the lysosomal and soluble cytoplasmic α-d-mannosidases on the basis of pH optimum, mobility in polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, thermal inactivation rate, and kinetic properties. Possible relationships of the Golgi mannosidase to glycoprotein metabolism and to the other mannosidases are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1565736062,"Abstract Synechococcus sp. (Anacystis nidulans) C-phycocyanin and its α and β subunits have been examined with respect to spectroscopic properties and aggregation behavior. In 0.05 m phosphate buffer at pH 7.0, and a protein concentration of 2.1 x 10-5 m, the α subunit exhibited a λmax of 620 nm (em = 0.98 x 105 m-1 cm-1), and a maximum molecular ellipticity, [θ]620, of 30.2 x 104 deg cm2 per dmole, while the β subunit exhibited a λmax of 608 nm (em = 1.43 x 105 m-1 cm-1), and a maximum [θ]600 of 56.1 x 104 deg cm2 per dmole. Fluorescence polarization spectra of native phycocyanin indicate the presence of two different chromophore types in this protein, those that absorb at shorter wave length (s type) sensitizing those that absorb and emit at longer wave length (f type) (see Teale, F. W. J., and Dale, R. E. (1970) Biochem. J. 116, 161–169). The absorption characteristics of the β subunit indicate that it contains the s type of chromophore, whereas those of the α subunit are consistent with the presence of the f type of chromophore. As reported earlier by others, aggregation of phycocyanin results in a red shift of the absorption maximum, and a large increase in the extinction coefficient. Phycocyanin, under conditions where it is essentially monomeric, i.e. 7.2 x 10 -7 m protein in 0.05 m phosphate buffer at pH 7.0, is characterized by a λmax of ∼615 nm (em ∼ 2.3 x 105 m-1 cm-1), while hexameric phycocyanin, in 0.2 m acetate buffer at pH 5.5, exhibits a λmax of 621 nm (em = 3.33 x 105 m-1 cm-1). Changes in the circular dichroism spectrum observed upon phycocyanin aggregation suggest strong intermolecular interaction between the chromophores. Phycocyanin, formed by recombination of α and β subunits, was found to be indistinguishable from native phycocyanin with respect to circular dichroism and absorption spectra."

https://openalex.org/W1986960180,"The accumulation of Euglena gracilis in an illuminated region is brought about by two main mechanisms: orientation and subsequent directed movement (positive phototaxis) toward light scattered from particles in the illuminated zone; and by the trapping of cells in this region because of shock reactions experienced upon the cells encountering a sudden decrease of light intensity at the light-dark boundary (inverse photophobic responses). Phototactic orientation is mediated by inverse photophobic reactions which occur when the shadow of the stigma periodically falls upon the photoreceptor proper. Euglena also exhibits shock reactions when an already high light intensity is increased further (direct photophobic responses). The expression of both types of phobic responses depends upon stimulus intensity and adaptation of the sensory system in a seemingly complex way. A definition of the minimum components of the stimulus transduction system and a systems analytical approach to the study of input-output relationships enables one to construct an electronic analog of the cell's signal processing system that converts the photoreceptor input to commands which activate or inhibit flagellar reorientation. Computer simulation studies show that this model has considerable predictive value. It is hoped that with the approach presented in this article, a generalized model has become available for dealing with the questions of sensory transduction in aneural systems. Certainly, at this point more questions have been raised than have been answered. Where is the processing device located? Are its kinetic properties determined by electrical processes or by the rates of chemical reactions? Is the processor, and thereby the behavior of the orgamism, modulated by natural environmental parameters, and can it be modified permanently through more drastic chemical treatment of the cell? Is the system capable of permanent or transitory modification through repeated response, that is, does it exhibit phenomena analogous to learning and memory in higher organisms? These are only a few of the problems that require study in the future."

https://openalex.org/W2096674223,"The different species of Fragment D were purified from plasmin digests of either fibrinogen or highly cross-linked fibrin and examined electrophoretically in sodium dodecyl sulfate on polyacrylamide gels before and after reduction by β-mercaptoethanol. It was found that Fragment D from cross-linked fibrin is approximately twice the size of that from fibrinogen, which indicates that the COOH-terminal cross-links in the γ chain remnants are not cleaved during fibrin digestion by plasmin. The first Fragment D to appear in plasmin digests of fibrinogen is designated Fragment D1 which is composed of a β″ chain (44,500 molecular weight), a γ′ chain (42,000 molecular weight), and an α″ chain (∼15,000 molecular weight) linked together by disulfide bonds. Fragment D from fibrin differs in that it has a γ′ dimer (81,000 molecular weight) in place of γ′ chains and that it contains two each of the α′ and β″ chains. Further digestion of Fragment D1 from fibrinogen results in cleavage of the γ′ chain to give first the γ″ chain (37,000 molecular weight) and finally the γ″′ chain (27,000 molecular weight). Neither the γ″ chain nor the γ″′ chain contained the COOH-terminal cross-links found in the intact γ chain or the γ′ chain. It was possible to show by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis that fibrinogen Fragment D1 could be cross-linked in the presence or absence of native fibrinogen through the formation of γ-γ′ or γ′-γ′ dimers."
https://openalex.org/W1501626822,"Abstract Apo-retinol-binding protein (apo-RBP) from human plasma was found to be completely dissociated from prealbumin (thyroxine-binding protein) under conditions of physiological ionic strength in which native retinol-retinol-binding protein complex was tightly bound as judged by gel filtration chromatography. Addition of all-trans-retinol to apo-RBP resulted in (a) complete regeneration of the enhanced retinol fluorescence which is found in native retinol-binding protein (RBP), (b) 93 to 100% regeneration of the native absorption and circular dichroism spectra of native retinol-RPB, and (c) tight binding of the reconstituted retinol-RBP to prealbumin at physiological ionic strength. The binding between 9-, 11-, and 13-cis-retinol isomers and retinol-binding protein was compared to the binding of all-trans-retinol to the protein. All four retinol isomers were bound to retinol-binding protein in a molar ratio of 0.9 to 1.0. All four isomers were bound at the same site on the protein. The binding of all four retinols resulted in a 3- to 5-mn red shift of the chromophore absorption peak, and it led to some 10-fold enhancement of the fluorescence quantum yield. All four isomers showed an extrinsic Cotton effect of the chromophore absorption band. The rotatory strength of the all-trans-retinol-RBP was 3 times greater than that of the other retinol-RBP complexes. All the retinol isomers-RBP complexes showed small but variable changes in the chromophore absorption and circular dichroism bands upon increase in ionic strength. All the retinol-RBP complexes were bound to prealbumin (thyroxine-binding protein) at physiological ionic strength, and this binding resulted in a 10% increase of the chromophore absorption band and a variable effect on the circular dichroism band at 330 nm. These changes in the absorption occurred in less than 30 s after the addition of salt. Addition of salt to prealbumin alone had no effect on the absorption band between 240 and 300 nm. The binding between retinol isomers-RBP and prealbumin resulted in a nonlinear addition of the circular dichroism spectra of retinol-binding protein and prealbumin in the 250 to 300 nm range. Linear addition of the circular dichroism spectra was observed when the two proteins were mixed under conditions in which they did not form a stable complex. Such conditions were found to be low ionic strength buffers, 8 m urea, and 6 m guanidine HCl. Changes in ionic strength or addition of urea or guanidine HCl to the individual proteins did not lead to any significant changes in the circular dichroism spectra. Removal of the urea or guanidine HCl by dialysis led to the formation of a complex between retinol-RBP and prealbumin, as judged by the reappearance of the changes (nonlinear addition) in the circular dichroism spectra. It was concluded from this series of experiments that removal of retinol from retinol-binding protein results in a conformational change such as to make apo-RBP unable to bind to prealbumin. The binding of retinol-RBP to prealbumin results in conformational changes in either the retinol-binding protein, the prealbumin, or both. The native retinol-RBP which is isolated from human plasma is the all-trans isomer."
https://openalex.org/W1565009428,"Abstract Pyruvate kinase has been purified from bovine skeletal muscle by a procedure that includes only heat, ammonium sulfate fractionation, and chromatography on carboxymethyl Sephadex. Crystallization was accomplished by dialysis at 4° against 47% saturated ammonium sulfate. Since this simple purification scheme, with only slight modifications, has also been used to isolate turkey and rabbit muscle pyruvate kinases, it may be generally applicable to the isolation of muscle pyruvate kinase from birds and mammals. Bovine muscle pyruvate kinase prepared by the procedure described here was found to be homogeneous, as determined by disc gel electrophoresis at pH 9.5, gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate, sedimentation velocity and sedimentation equilibrium, isoelectric focusing, and immunodiffusion. It sediments at 9.9 S (s020,w) and has a maximum velocity of 400 µmoles per min per mg or more at 25°, or 2.4 times that value at 37°. The enzyme has maximal activity at pH 7.1, with an apparent Michaelis constant for phosphoenolpyruvate of 0.04 mm or less, and for ADP of 0.4 mm. Its isoelectric pH during electrofocusing is 8.9. Sedimentation equilibrium yielded a molecular weight of 230,000 with a range of ±3,000 in dilute phosphate buffer, and 57,000 ± 1,500 in 3.5 m guanidine hydrochloride, using a partial specific volume of 0.740 ml per g calculated from the amino acid composition. The molecular weight in guanidine hydrochloride, confirmed by gel electrophoresis in sodium dodecyl sulfate, indicates the presence of four polypeptide chains in the native enzyme. Binding studies suggest a total of four phosphoenolpyruvate binding sites, or one per subunit. Ion sensitivities and other chemical and physical parameters are very similar to those reported for rabbit muscle pyruvate kinase."
https://openalex.org/W1581673713,"Abstract The sigma subunit of DNA-dependent RNA polymerase from vegetative Bacillus subtilis has been purified to at least 90% purity. Purified sigma binds to core RNA polymerase and stimulates in vitro transcription of phage Oe DNA by core RNA polymerase in the presence of up to 0.2 m KCl. Sigma also stimulates RNA synthesis to different extents with phage T4 DNA and poly(dA-dT) as templates, but this stimulation is markedly sensitive to increasing ionic strength. At 0.2 m KCl sigma subunit fails to stimulate transcription of T4 DNA and actually inhibits the synthesis of RNA with poly(dA-dT) as template."

Sustained and significant increases (30 to 40 mm-Hg) in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure were maintained throughout the daily 12-hour conditioning sessions, accompanied by elevated heart rates."
https://openalex.org/W1567559703,"The reconstitution of analogs of the native chromophore retinol (vitamin A) with apo-retinol-binding protein (apo-RBP) from human plasma was studied by chromatographic and spectroscopic techniques. All-trans- and 9-, 11-, and 13-cis-retinal combined with apo-RBP in a 1:1 molar ratio while only about 0.85 mole of all-trans-retinoic acid and 0.75 mole of retinyl acetate combined with 1.0 mole of apo-RBP. The various chromophores all bound to the same site on retinol-binding protein and were competitive inhibitors of each other's binding. Upon reconstitution the absorption peak of the chromophore shifted some 9 to 12 nm to the red with the retinal chromophores, 5 nm to the red with retinyl acetate, and 15 nm to the blue with retinoic acid (at pH 9). All the chromophore-RBP complexes showed an induced (extrinsic) Cotton effect of the chromophore absorption band with a rotatory strength of the same order of magnitude as that of the retinol isomers-RBP. Similar to the behavior of the free chromophore in aqueous detergent solutions, the absorption and CD spectra of retinoic acid-RBP were pH dependent, with both the absorption and CD chromophore peak decreasing in magnitude and shifting to the red upon a decrease in pH. The reconstitution of apo-RBP with the various chromophores led to a marked (more than 90%) quenching of the fluorescence of the inherent protein chromophores. Increasing the ionic strength of a retinal-RBP complex led to a shift of the absorption to the blue (7 nm with the 9-cis-retinal), a small decrease in the size of the absorption band, and marked decrease (up to 39% with 11-cis-retinal) of the rotatory strength. Increasing the ionic strength of retinoic acid-RBP solution led to a shift of the absorption peak to the red of about 1 nm, a 2.4% increase in the absorption band, and an increase of about 1% in the rotatory strength. The same change in ionic strength had no effect on the absorption of the free chromophore in an aqueous nonionic detergent solution. Reduction of retinal-RBP complexes with NaBH4 showed that the retinal aldehyde function was free and was not covalently linked to the protein. This was also shown by illuminating frozen solutions of retinal-RBP complexes with linearly polarized light (photoselection) and measuring the resulting linear dichroism spectrum. The linear dichroism spectrum of illuminated retinal-RBP complexes was similar to that of the corresponding free retinal isomer in aqueous digitonin solution. None of the retinal isomers-RBP and retinyl acetate-RBP complexes was bound to prealbumin (thyroxine-binding protein) at physiological ionic strength, whereas retinoic acid-RBP was bound to prealbumin under the same conditions as judged by gel filtration chromatography. On the other hand, the addition of prealbumin to retinal-RBP complexes at low ionic strength resulted in a shift to the blue of the absorption peak (8 nm with 9-cis-retinal-RBP). Increasing the ionic strength of a retinal-RBP and prealbumin solution resulted in a further shift to the blue (5 nm with 9-cis-retinal-RBP) and an increase in the area of the chromophore absorption band. Adding salt to a retinoic acid-RBP solution containing prealbumin resulted in a shift of 1 nm to the red and an increase in the absorption band. It was concluded from these experiments that although the retinals, retinoic acid, and retinyl acetate bind to retinol-binding protein at the same site as the retinol isomers, the binding of these various chromophores resulted in a somewhat altered conformation of the reconstituted retinol-binding protein. This in turn made it impossible for the retinals- and retinyl acetate-RBP complexes to bind to prealbumin and led to the various subtle differences in spectroscopic behavior of the various chromophore-RBP complexes upon changes in ionic strength and interaction with prealbumin."
https://openalex.org/W1568680290,"Abstract Glycogen synthetase b has been purified about 2,000-fold from a crude extract of rat liver. The purification procedure consisted of the separation of the glycogen pellet by centrifugation, solubilization of the synthetase by phosphorolysis of the glycogen by endogenous phosphorylase, and adsorption and elution from Ca3(PO4)2 gel. The final material appears homogeneous on gel electrophoresis. A subunit molecular weight of 85,000 was obtained from electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate. The oligomer appears to have a molecular weight of 260,000 as isolated, suggesting that it is a trimer. On storage in solution in the cold, a species twice this size appears. The peak absorbance of the enzyme was at 278 nm with a value of E1%1 cm at this wave length of 14.5. The spectrum showed no evidence of conjugated chromophores. Determinations of alkali-labile phosphate and reactive sulfhydryl groups gave values of 12.4 and about 6, respectively. Activity decreased linearly to zero with the titration of the first three sulfhydryl groups (or the first two when glycogen was present), indicating that at least one of the most reactive groups is essential for activity. Incubation of the purified synthetase at 0° led to inactivation which was reversed on rewarming. Glycogen protected against this cold inactivation."
https://openalex.org/W2123003395,"Bacillus subtilis RNA polymerase transcribes phage Oe DNA more actively than phage T4 DNA, while Escherichia coli RNA polymerase is equally active with both templates. This paper investigates the role of sigma in determining this difference in template specificity by in vitro complementation of B. subtilis core polymerase and E. coli core polymerase with both the homologous and the heterologous sigma subunits. Each core polymerase retained its characteristic template specificity in the presence of either sigma subunit. To determine whether the smaller size of B. subtilis sigma (55,000 daltons) compared to that of E. coli sigma (86 to 95,000 daltons) is due to in vitro proteolysis, RNA polymerase was purified from a mixture of E. coli and B. subtilis separately labeled with different radioisotopes. Sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis of the purified polymerases demonstrated that the two sigma subunits retained their characteristic molecular weights when purified from the mixture."
https://openalex.org/W1605067347,"Abstract Chemical cleavage of methionyl bonds in human fibrinogen with cyanogen bromide produces several large fragments. One of these (N-DSK) contains NH2-terminal portions of the three chains of the parent molecule. The NH2-terminal portion of the γ chain of fibrinogen has been isolated. The γ chain fragment has tyrosine as NH2-terminal residue and homoserine as COOH-terminal residue and therefore evidently consists of one single polypeptide chain. It has a molecular weight of 11,500 as determined by ultracentrifugal analysis. molecular weight of 12,700 was found by gel electrophoresis in sodium dodecyl sulfate. The charge heterogeneity of the γ chain fragment observed upon electrophoresis in polyacrylamide gels is probably due to microheterogeneity of its carbohydrate moiety. The NH2-terminal γ chain fragment consists of 78 amino acid residues. The amino acid sequence has been determined. The fragment contains about half of the half-cystines of the whole γ chain. They occur in a cluster, which indicates an uneven distribution of half-cystines within the γ chain of fibrinogen. One of the half-cystine-containing segments shows similarities in sequence with segments in the A α and B β chains. The carbohydrate moiety in the γ chain consists of 2 residues of glucosamine, 6 residues of galactose and mannose, and 1 to 2 residues of sialic acid. The carbohydrate moiety is most likely linked to residue 52. Some differences in specificity of trypsin, plasmin, and thrombin when acting on the γ chain are discussed."

https://openalex.org/W1488954936,"Abstract Phycocyanin, a chromoprotein from Chroomonas sp., is characterized in regard to its size, subunit structure, amino acid composition, and spectroscopic properties. It is a monodisperse protein of 50,000 daltons and is composed of two polypeptide chains of 10,000 and two chains of 16,000 daltons. The proposed structure of the native protein is α2β2. The s020,w is 4.4 S, and the partial specific volume is 0.73. Unlike C-phycocyanin, a functionally related chromoprotein from blue-green and red algae, phycocyanin does not form a number of different aggregates. We suggest that the absence of these larger aggregates is related to its in vivo location. The amino acid composition of phycocyanin from Chroomonas sp. differs extensively from that of C-phycocyanin, with much greater amounts of serine, half-cystine, and lysine. Likewise, the circular dichroism and fluorescence spectra are very different, indicating major functional modifications."
https://openalex.org/W1964964688,"Abstract We described earlier the purification of Streptomyces griseus trypsin. This enzyme was demonstrated to bind diaminoalkanes and as a consequence was selectively retarded during CM-cellulose chromatography (Awad, W. M., Jr., Soto, A. R., Siegel, S., Skiba, W. E., Bernstrom, G. G. & Ochoa, M. S. (1972) J. Biol. Chem. 247, 4144–4154). In order to facilitate this procedure an affinity matrix, 1,6-diaminohexane-agarose, was synthesized and demonstrated to bind the trypsin. More significant was the finding that this agarose derivative also bound the two components with aminopeptidase activity present in Pronase. The trypsin was completely separated from the aminopeptidases by initial passage through a CM-cellulose column. Thereafter, the trypsin was selectively retarded by the hexanediamine-agarose; all associated components were eluted with 1 m NaCl at pH 8, whereas the trypsin could be eluted only after application of an acidic (pH 3) buffer. This enzyme appeared to be homogeneous by other studies. Bovine trypsin was not retarded by this chromatographic procedure. The aminopeptidases were purified by passage through the same column. Their complete selective retardation was achieved only after prior treatment with sodium ethylenediamine-tetraacetate. Calcium ion at low concentrations eluted the two enzymes separately. Calcium ion was required for the activity of each enzyme and also stabilized each enzyme against heat denaturation. Strontium ion could restore about two-thirds of the activities to the metal-free proteins as compared to the activities noted with calcium; other divalent cations provided much less activity. The maximum activity of each aminopeptidase lies between pH values of 7.5 and 10; each enzyme is stable between pH values of 6 and 11. These enzymes have been tentatively designated aminopeptidase 1 and aminopeptidase 2 after the order of their elution from hexanediamine-agarose; gel filtration revealed their approximate molecular weights to be 23,000 and 25,000, respectively. A single band was seen for each protein after acrylamide gel electrophoresis."

https://openalex.org/W2058535252,"Cultured cells from pineal glands of human fetuses release into their media a substance that has antidiuretic and hydroosmotic activities. The ratio of these activities as well as their susceptibility to tryptic digestion, specific oxidative inactivation by tyrosinase, and reductive inactivation by sodium thioglycollate, indicates the presence of a basic peptide, presumably identical with arginine vasotocin. The total amount of this peptide released into the culture media during 38 days of incubation is about ten times greater than the amount contained in nonincubated pineal glands from fetuses of the same age, strongly suggesting that fetal ependymal cells from the pineal gland can synthesize in vitro a peptide similar to arginine vasotocin."
https://openalex.org/W1709825510,"Abstract To estimate the turnover of 5-CH3-H4-folate in murine lymphoma cells L1210, L1210R (a methotrexate-resistant subline), and L5178Y, suspensions of whole cells were allowed to concentrate 5-[14C]CH3-[9,3',5'-3H]H4-folate; analysis of cell extracts showed that, for each cell line, 81 to 85% of the total cell [14C]CH3 groups were transferred to nonfolate compounds within 5 min and 82 to 91% at time intervals up to 60 min. The initial transfer of 14C appeared to be into [14C]methionine, but insoluble cell materials were also progressively 14C labeled. Of the total cell 3H, more than 87% remained identified as 5-CH3-[3H3]H4-folate at 60 min, showing that within this period most of the [3H2]H4-folate derived from 5-CH3-[3H3]H4-folate returned to maintain the labeling of the pool of 5-CH3-[3H3]H4-folate. To estimate the flux of folates through the pathway of thymidylate biosynthesis, L1210 and L1210R cells were allowed to concentrate either 5-CH3-[9,3',5'-3H]H4-folate in the presence of methotrexate or 5-HCO-[6-3H]H4-folate. Of total 3H taken up as 5-HCO-[6-3H]H4-folate, 28% appeared to be transferred to thymidylate in 60 min by L1210 cells and 52% by L1210R cells. In methotrexate-treated L1210 cells, 23% of the total 3H taken up as 5-CH3-[3H3]H4-folate was accumulated in 60 min as [3H3]H2-folate, a product of thymidylate biosynthesis. However, in cells of the methotrexate-resistant L1210R line, no [3H3]H2-folate was accumulated by the use of 2 mm methotrexate despite the demonstrated high flux of folates through the pathway of thymidylate biosynthesis. These data show the significance, for methotrexate resistance, of the 11-fold increase of dihydrofolate reductase in L1210R cells."
https://openalex.org/W1578890041,"Several microorganisms have been reported to contain the unusual sugar 6-deoxy- l -talose as a cell wall component. It is the objective of this paper to present experimental evidence for the biosynthesis of this sugar in a cell-free extract of Escherichia coli 045 according to the following reaction sequence: [see PDF for equation] [see PDF for equation] [see PDF for equation] The over-all reaction yielding thymidine diphospho (TDP)-6-deoxy- l -talose was first established using crude enzyme preparations catalyzing Reactions 1, 2, and 3. Unambiguous proof for the formation of the l isomer of 6-deoxytalose was provided by radioisotope dilution experiments. Purification of sonic extracts of E. coli 045 into fractions catalyzing individual steps of the above scheme revealed intermediary formation of TDP-6-deoxy- d -xylo-4-hexosulose. This intermediate was used as substrate to study Reactions 2 and 3. As indicated by brackets, TDP-6-deoxy- l -lyxo-4-hexosulose is a postulated enzyme-bound intermediate. TDP-4-Keto- l -rhamhose-3,5-epimerase (3,5-epimerase) and TDP-6-deoxy- l -talose dehydrogenase (4-reductase) were separated by conventional methods. Neither fraction alone was capable of 6-deoxyhexose biosynthesis, only when combined TDP-6-deoxy- l -talose was formed. When 3,5-epimerase and 4-reductase isolated from Pseudomonas aeruginosa were examined, the reaction sequence proceeded as outlined above except that TDP-6-deoxy- l -mannose ( l -rhamnose) was the end product. Mixing of 3,5-epimerase from E. coli 045 and 4-reductase from P. aeruginosa resulted in net 6-deoxyhexose biosynthesis with TDP- l -rhamnose as the only product. Conversely, when 3,5-epimerase from P. aeruginosa was mixed with 4-reductase of E. coli 045, TDP-6-deoxy- l -talose was the sole product of the reaction sequence. Thus, it appears that 3,5-epimerase and 4-reductase isolated from different sources can work together, but the product of the reaction sequence is determined by the stereospecificity of 4-reductase. Unique properties concerning the stability of TDP-6-deoxy- l -talose which are quite different from other sugar nucleotides are reported. Exposure to mild alkaline conditions results in quantitative degradation to thymidine monophosphate and 6-deoxy- l -talose-1,2-monophosphate. A specific degradation procedure to establish the structure of the cyclic sugar monophosphate is presented."

This study extends the known effects of 6-hydroxydopamine and catecholamine depletion to the social interactions of a higher primate species under free-ranging conditions."
https://openalex.org/W1671193573,"Abstract Studies have been made on the role of two hydrolases, acid RNase and cathepsin, in the regression of hormone-dependent rat mammary carcinomas. A burst of acid RNase activity as early as 6 hours after hormonal deprivation was followed by a significant increase in cathepsin activity that began 48 hours after hormone removal. The ratios of free to bound activities of these enzymes increased with tumor regression, reaching their highest ratios of 4- to 5-fold that of growing tumors 72 to 96 hours after hormone removal when most tumors had regressed to one-half of their original size. The possible mechanisms leading to the increased free activity in regressing tumors are discussed. Isolation of acid RNase in a homogeneous state has made possible quantitation of the enzyme in tumors by immuno-diffusion techniques. The increase in enzyme quantity was closely correlated with its increased activity in regressing tumors. New synthesis of acid RNase during the early phase of tumor regression is indicated by an increased concentration of the enzyme which is partially blocked in vivo by inhibitors of protein synthesis."

https://openalex.org/W2059109058,"Lectins that precipitate the soluble H substances of saliva were produced for the first time from the four commonly used sources of seed. In Ouchterlony precipitin reactions, identity was observed between extracts of Cytisus sessilifolius and Laburnum alpinum, but these extracts displayed incomplete identity with extracts from Ulex europaeus. These three sources of the precipitating lectin formed bands when tested with saliva from all secretors and none with saliva from nonsecretors. Extracts from Lotus tetragonolobus, however, formed two bands with saliva from secretors and one strong band with all saliva from nonsecretors. This new antigen, which reacts with Lotus, is present in all saliva and on red cells of all normal individuals, but it is absent in the O(h) (Bombay) type. The lectins formed bands with serums of secretor and nonsecretor individuals, but these bands were weaker than those with saliva, and revealed incomplete identity between H substance of serum and saliva. The precipitin reaction of the lectins is an efficient method for demonstrating relations among lectins and among antigens and has led to the discovery of a new human antigen."

https://openalex.org/W1608095408,"Abstract A DNA-RNA polymerase complex has been isolated from EDTA-treated Escherichia coli MRE 600. This fraction contains virtually all of the RNA synthetic capacity expressed in the EDTA-treated cells. The in vitro synthesis is sensitive to rifampicin, indicating that the complex is actively initiating RNA chains. Analysis of the product RNA by hybridization competition shows that between 20 to 30% is rRNA. Guanosine tetraphosphate (ppGpp) inhibits global RNA and rRNA synthesis equally, and no preferential inhibition of rRNA synthesis is detected."
https://openalex.org/W1592121886,"Abstract The membrane of spinach chloroplast grana has been solubilized by a method which does not involve use of detergents. This method is based on the fact that most of the membrane components are soluble in acidic ethanol. The alcoholic extract is chromatographed on a hydroxylapatite column and the pigments are removed quantitatively by washing with alcohol. The membrane proteins can then be eluted by successive washing with phosphate buffer and dilute ammonium hydroxide. Some protein remains on the column and requires sodium dodecyl sulfate for elution. The major component of the membrane is eluted in the ammonia fraction, and is freely soluble in aqueous buffers at pH 7.5. This protein was shown to bind β-carotene. None of the major chloroplast proteins are glycoproteins. The fraction which was insoluble in acidic alcohol had a bright pink color due to the presence of β-carotene. This complex was highly insoluble, even in high sodium dodecyl sulfate concentrations unless the β-carotene was first removed by extraction with an organic solvent. This complex was shown to be a precipitate of β-carotene and several peptides."
https://openalex.org/W1492115270,"Abstract The rate constants for acid RNase synthesis and degradation were measured in growing and regressing tumors. Accumulation of acid RNase in regressing tumors is the result of both enhanced synthetic and degradative processes. Increased acid RNase synthesis during tumor regression was shown indirectly by measuring the decrease in specific activity of the enzyme labeled during tumor growth and directly by measuring the rate of l-[4,5-3H2]leucine incorporation into the enzyme. The rate of acid RNase degradation was determined in growing and regressing tumors by the rate of radioactivity loss from the prelabeled enzyme. The degradation rate increased during the initial phase of tumor regression but later approached the rate present in the growing tumor."

https://openalex.org/W1584203853,"Abstract Homogeneous preparations of the two homozygous types of rhesus monkey serum prealbumin, Pt 1-1 and Pt 2-2, were studied and compared with human prealbumin. Circular dichroism showed similar secondary structure, with a roughly equal distribution of β and unordered peptide groups. Minor differences between the two monkey proteins were observed in ultraviolet absorption and fluorescence of the tyrosyl and tryptophanyl residues between pH 4 and 2 and in the fluorescence of 5-dimethylaminonaphthalene-1-sulfonate between pH 7 and 3. The changes were similar to those seen with human prealbumin although there were small but significant differences. The behavior of Pt 1-1 and Pt 2-2 in concentrated solutions of guanidine revealed the remarkable stability of these proteins. The denaturation of monkey prealbumin is incomplete in 7.3 m guanidine, pH 8.0, but goes to completion when the pH is reduced to values below pH 4.0. In contrast, denaturation of human prealbumin is complete in 7.3 m guanidine, pH 8.0. Pt 1-1, Pt 2-2, and human prealbumin showed similar binding of thyroxine (Kassoc ≃ 108 m-1, n = 1) and retinol-binding protein (Kassoc ≃ 106 m-1, n = 4), indicating similarity in their active sites."

One complex formed at low pH (∼6) is much more stable and is decomposed via the rate law -d[Cu2+-albumin]/dt = 1.1 x 107[H+][H-EDTA3-][Cu2+-albumin] The rate is found to be independent of the concentration of added buffer. The biuret complex formed by the NH2-terminal peptide fragment of albumin is decomposed via the same rate law with a rate constant of 5 x 106 m-2 s-1. The other Cu2+-albumin complexes are formed at high pH (∼9.5) and decomposed via a different rate law, namely -d[Cu2+n-albumin]/dt = k[H+][Cu2+n-albumin] where k = 2.8 x 107 m-1 s-1, 1.3 x 108 m-1 s-1, and 2.2 x 109 m-1 s-1 for n = 2, 3, and 4, respectively. The rates were independent of [EDTA]. The effect of added buffer on the decomposition of the second bound Cu2+ ion was measured. Both H-Tris and H-borate were found to catalyze the decomposition reaction, indicating that the reaction was general acid-catalyzed. The relative rates of catalysis for H3O+, H-Tris, and H-borate were 1.5 x 107:5:1."
https://openalex.org/W1547678859,"Abstract In view of the androgen control exerted upon renal gulonolactonase activity in the rat and the absence of such control upon hepatic enzyme activity, the renal enzymes from the adult male and female have been compared with each other as well as with the male hepatic enzyme. The enzymes from the three sources are immunologically alike. Moreover, these enzymes have been characterized with respect to pH optimum, relative substrate specificity, Km, metal ion requirement, and isoelectric point and found to be indistinguishable. Gulonolactonase from male rat liver has been purified to near homogeneity as judged by electrofocusing and disc gel electrophoresis. The molecular weight is estimated to be 42,000 based on gel retardation chromatography and on electrophoresis on acrylamide in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate. The turnover number is estimated to be 13,500 moles of d-gluonolactone hydrolyzed per mole of enzyme per min."
