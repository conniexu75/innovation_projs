https://openalex.org/W1997413633,"In plants, microRNAs (miRNAs) comprise one of two classes of small RNAs that function primarily as negative regulators at the posttranscriptional level. Several MIRNA genes in the plant kingdom are ancient, with conservation extending between angiosperms and the mosses, whereas many others are more recently evolved. Here, we use deep sequencing and computational methods to identify, profile and analyze non-conserved MIRNA genes in Arabidopsis thaliana. 48 non-conserved MIRNA families, nearly all of which were represented by single genes, were identified. Sequence similarity analyses of miRNA precursor foldback arms revealed evidence for recent evolutionary origin of 16 MIRNA loci through inverted duplication events from protein-coding gene sequences. Interestingly, these recently evolved MIRNA genes have taken distinct paths. Whereas some non-conserved miRNAs interact with and regulate target transcripts from gene families that donated parental sequences, others have drifted to the point of non-interaction with parental gene family transcripts. Some young MIRNA loci clearly originated from one gene family but form miRNAs that target transcripts in another family. We suggest that MIRNA genes are undergoing relatively frequent birth and death, with only a subset being stabilized by integration into regulatory networks."

Mitochondria are dynamic entities, frequently dividing and fusing with each other, during which dynamin-related GTPase Drp1 is required for the fission reaction. In this study, we analyzed mitochondrial dynamics in mitotic mammalian cells. Although mitochondria in interphase HeLa cells are long tubular network structures, they are fragmented in early mitotic phase, and the filamentous network structures are subsequently reformed in the daughter cells. In marked contrast, tubular mitochondrial structures are maintained during mitosis in Drp1 knockdown cells, indicating that the mitochondrial fragmentation in mitosis requires mitochondrial fission by Drp1. Drp1 was specifically phosphorylated in mitosis by Cdk1/cyclin B on Ser-585. Exogenous expression of unphosphorylated mutant Drp1S585A led to reduced mitotic mitochondrial fragmentation. These results suggest that phosphorylation of Drp1 on Ser-585 promotes mitochondrial fission in mitotic cells.

Mitochondrial morphology varies in response to the environment and cellular differentiation; mitochondria form connected and filamentous network structures in most fibroblasts, are arranged along the myofibrils in skeletal muscle, and are coiled around the flagella in sperm. Mitochondrial morphology is maintained in a dynamic balance between fusion and fission (7Nunnari J. Marshall W.F. Straight A. Murray A. Sedat J.W. Walter P. Mol. Biol.

The dynamin-related GTPase OPA1 and a yeast homolog Mgm1, localized in the mitochondrial intermembrane space, are also required for fusion (15Shepard K.A. Yaffe M.P. J.

These mitochondrial fusion proteins have important roles in mitochondrial function, as respiration is defective in fzo1-or mgm1-mutated yeast cells and Mfn- or OPA1-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts (12Hermann G.J.

Other dynamin-related proteins, Drp1 (mammals) and Dnm1 (yeast), participate in mitochondrial fission, and their mutation leads to highly elongated filamentous mitochondria structures (8Bleazard W.

Dissipation of the mitochondrial membrane potential and apoptotic stimuli induce mitochondrial fragmentation by inhibiting fusion or stimulating fission (10Ishihara N. Jofuku A. Eura Y. Mihara K.

Cell. 2004; 15: 5001-5011Crossref PubMed Scopus (851) Google Scholar). The molecular mechanisms of the regulation of mitochondrial fusion and fission, however, are not well understood. Mitochondria proliferate by growth and division of pre-existing mitochondria (30Posakony J.W. England J.M. Attardi G. J. Cell Biol. 1977; 74: 468-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The inheritance of mitochondria is well investigated in budding yeast by genetic and morphologic studies (6Okamoto K. Shaw J.M. Annu. Rev.

Yeast mitochondria form a network of interconnected tubules along actin filaments, and mitochondrial tubules are transported into the growing daughter buds (31Boldogh I.R. Yang H.C. Pon L.A. Traffic. 2001; 2: 368-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The mitochondrial movement depends on actin cables, class V myosin, Rab family GTPase Ypt11, and mitochondrial surface protein Mmr1 (31Boldogh I.R. Yang H.C. Pon L.A.

Mmm1, Mdm10, and Mdm12 were identified from the mitochondrial inheritance mutants, and they form a complex on the mitochondrial outer membrane (6Okamoto K. Shaw J.M. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2005; 39: 503-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar). Mitochondrial filamentous structures are maintained through the mitotic stages, and long mitochondria are transported to the daughter buds. None of the known mitochondrial fission factors, Dnm1, Fis1, Mdv1, nor Caf4, is essential for mitochondrial inheritance or cell viability (6Okamoto K. Shaw J.M. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2005; 39: 503-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar, 8Bleazard W. McCaffery J.M. King E.J. Bale S. Mozdy A. Tieu Q. Nunnari J. Shaw J.M. Nat.

On the other hand, mitochondrial fragmentation is observed at specific stages in meiosis and sporulation (33Gorsich S.W. Shaw J.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 4369-4381Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Mutant cells deficient in mitochondrial fission affect the uniform distribution of mitochondria into spores, which results in an increased number of inviable spores, although mitochondrial fission is not required for spore formation itself. It is less clear, however, how the interconnected mitochondrial network structures are inherited to mammalian daughter cells. In this study, we analyzed mitochondrial dynamics and inheritance in mitotic mammalian cells. The interconnected mitochondrial network structures in interphase HeLa cells became fragmented in the early mitotic phase and stochastically segregated into two daughter cells. Finally, the filamentous mitochondria reformed in the daughter cells. The mitotic fragmentation required the mitochondrial fission factor Drp1. Furthermore, Drp1 was specifically phosphorylated by mitosis-promoting factor (MPF, Cdk1/cyclin B), which stimulated mitotic mitochondrial fragmentation. The results demonstrated that mitochondrial morphology is regulated by Drp1-dependent mitochondrial fission in mitotic cells. Materials—Monoclonal antibodies against FLAG (M2, Sigma), Drp1 (D80320, Transduction Laboratories, San Jose, CA), and cyclin B1 (sc-245, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) were purchased from the indicated companies. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies against phosphorylated Drp1 were prepared using phosphorylated synthetic peptide IPIM-PASPQKGHAVC (the underlined Ser residue was phosphorylated). Purified Cdk1/cyclin B was purchased from New England Biochemical (Beverly, MA) (P6020S). Calf alkaline phosphatase was purchased from New England Biochemical (M0290S). Protein kinase A inhibitor was purchased from Sigma (P5990). Plasmids—The mammalian su9-RFP expression plasmid has been described previously (10Ishihara N. Jofuku A. Eura Y. Mihara K. Biochem.

All rat Drp1 mutants were prepared by PCR. Cell Culture, Synchronization, Transfection, and Analysis—HeLa cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum under 5% CO2 at 37 °C. DNA transfection was performed using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) as recommended by the manufacturer. The cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for fluorescence microscopy. For live cell imaging, HeLa cells cultured in a glass-bottomed dish at 37 °C were analyzed by a model IX81 fluorescence microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) with a cooled charge-coupled device camera (Roper Scientific, Tokyo, Japan). For visualizing mitotic cells, HeLa cells were treated with 2.5 mm thymidine for 16-24 h and released from G1/S phase in DMEM for 2-4 h (first thymidine). The cells were transfected with plasmids by Lipofectamine, treated with thymidine again for 16-24 h, and then cultured in DMEM for 12-18 h for analyzing mitotic cells. For preparing mitotic cell lysates, cells were treated with 2.5 mm thymidine for 16-24 h, released from G1/S phase in DMEM for 8 h, and then treated with 0.2 μm nocodazole for 6-8 h. Morphometric Analysis of Mitochondrial Morphology—Synchronized mitotic HeLa cells as described above were fixed and stained. Serial z-sectioned images (Fig. 1B from top to bottom) of the cells were obtained by confocal microscopy (Radiance 2000, Bio-Rad). The images of serial sections within the top one-fourth (top or peripheral), middle one-fourth (middle), or bottom one-fourth (bottom) of the cell depth were combined to reconstruct respective projection images (Figs. 1B, 2D, and 5E). Mitochondria in the top fraction were traced, and the size distribution (in μm; 0-1, 1-2, 2-3, 3-4, 4-5, and longer than 5) was quantified using Metamorph software (Roper) and shown as a percentage (Figs. 2E and 5F).FIGURE 2Inactivation of Drp1 induces morphologic changes of the mitochondria in the mitotic phase.

The annealed small interfering RNA (siRNA) was transfected to HeLa cells three times using Oligofectamine (Invitrogen) as described previously (26Jofuku A. Ishihara N. Mihara K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 333: 650-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Note that the target sequence is specific for human Drp1 but not for rat Drp1. Protein Kinase Assay—Recombinant His-Drp1 proteins were expressed and purified by metal-chelating resin and further purified by ion exchange chromatography using Q-Fast Flow (Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden). The in vitro protein kinase reaction was analyzed as reported previously (34Nishijima H. Nishitani H. Seki T. Nishimoto T. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 1105-1116Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Cdk1/cyclin B was isolated from mitotic HeLa cells as follows. Synchronized mitotic HeLa cells were solubilized by lysis buffer (40 mm Hepes-KOH buffer, pH 7.4, containing 60 mm β-glycerophosphate, 20 mm p-nitrophenylphosphate, 0.5 mm Na3VO4, 250 mm NaCl, 15 mm MgCl2, 1% Triton X-100, 5 mm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitor mixture), and the lysate was incubated with anti-cyclin B1 and protein G-Sepharose, washed in lysis buffer, and then suspended in protein kinase buffer (20 mm Hepes-KOH buffer, pH 7.4, 15 mm EGTA, and 20 mm MgCl2). Purified His-Drp1 was incubated in protein kinase buffer containing 5 ng/ml protein kinase A inhibitor, 1 μm dithiothreitol, 50 μm ATP, and [γ-32P]ATP with purified or immunoisolated Cdk1/cyclin B for 30-120 min at 30 °C. The samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and subsequent Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining and autoradiography. Mitochondrial Dynamics in Mitotic HeLa Cells—Mitochondrial morphology is maintained under dynamic movement with a balance between fusion and fission. In most cultured fibroblasts, filamentous mitochondria form network structures in the cytoplasm. It is not well understood, however, how mammalian daughter cells inherit the interconnected mitochondria. Here we observed mitochondrial dynamics in mitotic HeLa cells (Fig. 1). The HeLa cells were synchronized at the G1/S phase using the double thymidine block procedure and subsequently released into thymidine-free medium to restart the cell cycle progression. Mitochondrial morphology was visualized using mitochondria-targeted DsRed (su9-RFP) in which mitochondrial-targeting sequence (1-69 residue segment) of Neurospora crassa FoF1-ATPase subunit 9 was fused to the N-terminal end of DsRed. First, we observed live images of mitochondrial dynamics in dividing cells using time-lapse video microscopy (supplemental Fig. S1A). The filamentous network structures of the mitochondria in the interphase cells changed to smaller fragmented structures in the early mitotic phase (supplemental Fig. S1A, a and b). Restoration of the filamentous structures began in the late mitotic phase (supplemental Fig. S1A, g and h), and the mitochondria transmitted to the daughter cells regained normal filamentous network structures. For further detailed analysis of the mitotic stages, the synchronized cells were fixed and counter-stained with DAPI (Fig. 1A). The filamentous network structures of the mitochondria (tubular) were observed in most of the interphase cells (75% of counted cells) (Fig. 1A, p). From prophase to anaphase (Fig. 1A, q-s), <20% of the cells had filamentous mitochondria, and the number of cells with predominantly fragmented mitochondria clearly increased (∼30%). About half of the early mitotic cells had shorter mitochondria compared with most of the mitochondria in the interphase cells (Fig. 1A, intermediate). In the late stages of mitosis (telophase and cytokinesis phases), there were more cells with tubular mitochondria (∼50%) (Fig. 1A, t). These results indicated that mitochondrial morphology was drastically changed in HeLa cells, and fragmentation of mitochondria occurred during the early mitotic phase. Thereafter, we analyzed statistically the size distribution of mitochondria in the mitotic cells. For this purpose, serial z-section images were obtained (from top to bottom) of the cells by confocal microscopy (supplemental Movies 1-5). The section images within the top one-fourth, middle one-fourth, or bottom one-fourth of the cell depth were compiled (top, middle, and bottom, respectively) and projected (Fig. 1B). In metaphase and anaphase, mitochondria were almost completely fragmented (morphometric quantification shown in Fig. 2E); images of the bottom fractions clearly show mitochondrial fragmentation (Fig. 1B), thus providing further support for the above conclusion. Mitochondrial Fragmentation in Mitotic Cells Depends on Drp1—Next, we focused on the function of the mitochondrial fission factor Drp1 in mitotic mitochondrial fragmentation (Fig. 2). The expression of dominant negative mutant Drp1K38A inhibited mitochondrial fission and resulted in mitochondrial elongation (10Ishihara N. Jofuku A. Eura Y. Mihara K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 301: 891-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 21Smirnova E. Shurland D.L. Ryazantsev S.N. van der Bliek A.M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 351-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). In live images, filamentous mitochondrial structures were maintained throughout mitosis in Drp1K38A-expressing cells (supplemental Fig. S1B, a-h), suggesting that Drp1 activity was crucial for mitochondrial fragmentation during mitosis. In these cells, the mitochondria accumulated near the pole region but were still transmitted to the daughter cells (supplemental Fig. S1B, b-h). We further examined the effect of Drp1 knockdown using specific siRNA (Fig. 2). In control RNAi cells, mitochondria were fragmented in the early mitotic phase (∼50%) (Fig. 2B and supplemental Fig. 1C, q and r), as in Fig. 1. In contrast, the elongated mitochondrial structure was maintained throughout mitosis in Drp1 knockdown cells (∼80%) (Fig. 2, B and C, q and r). These results suggest that, in mitosis, mitochondria are fragmented by a Drp1-dependent fission reaction. For statistic analysis of mitochondrial fragmentation, the length of mitochondria in mitotic cells was measured morphometrically as shown in Fig. 1B. Typical compiled images of the peripheral fraction are shown in Fig. 2D, and quantified data are shown in Fig. 2E. In control RNAi cells, the number of mitochondria <1 μm (∼5% in interphase) clearly increased in mitosis (∼30% in prophase and metaphase), and oppositely, the number of mitochondria longer than 4 μm (∼30% in interphase) markedly decreased in the prophase and metaphase. On the other hand, in Drp1-RNAi cells, the formation of small mitochondria <1 μm in the early mitotic phase was clearly impaired (∼10% in the prophase and metaphase). These results clearly indicated that Drp1 stimulates mitochondrial fission in the early mitotic phase. Drp1 Is Mitotically Phosphorylated by Cdk1/cyclin B—The antibody against Drp1 recognized at least three bands due to alternative splicing (Fig. 3A) (21Smirnova E. Shurland D.L. Ryazantsev S.N. van der Bliek A.M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 351-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). Here, these Drp1 bands in mitotic cells had lower gel mobility compared with those from G1/S cells (Fig. 3A). Exogenously expressed FLAG-tagged Drp1, detected as a single band in G1/S cells, was also shifted upward in mitotic cells (Fig. 4B, wt). All three bands of endogenous Drp1 proteins immunoisolated from mitotic cells were shifted down by treatment with alkaline phosphatase (Fig. 3A), suggesting that Drp1 is phosphorylated in mitosis.FIGURE 4Ser-585 of rat Drp1 is phosphorylated in the mitotic phase.

https://openalex.org/W2140483939,"One of the biggest challenges for conservation biology is to provide conservation planners with ways to prioritize effort. Much attention has been focused on biodiversity hotspots. However, the conservation of evolutionary process is now also acknowledged as a priority in the face of global change. Phylogenetic diversity (PD) is a biodiversity index that measures the length of evolutionary pathways that connect a given set of taxa. PD therefore identifies sets of taxa that maximize the accumulation of 'feature diversity'. Recent studies, however, concluded that taxon richness is a good surrogate for PD. Here we show taxon richness to be decoupled from PD, using a biome-wide phylogenetic analysis of the flora of an undisputed biodiversity hotspot--the Cape of South Africa. We demonstrate that this decoupling has real-world importance for conservation planning. Finally, using a database of medicinal and economic plant use, we demonstrate that PD protection is the best strategy for preserving feature diversity in the Cape. We should be able to use PD to identify those key regions that maximize future options, both for the continuing evolution of life on Earth and for the benefit of society."
https://openalex.org/W2080089116,"The remarkable diversity, glycosylation and conformational flexibility of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) envelope (Env), including substantial rearrangement of the gp120 glycoprotein upon binding the CD4 receptor, allow it to evade antibody-mediated neutralization. Despite this complexity, the HIV-1 Env must retain conserved determinants that mediate CD4 binding. To evaluate how these determinants might provide opportunities for antibody recognition, we created variants of gp120 stabilized in the CD4-bound state, assessed binding of CD4 and of receptor-binding-site antibodies, and determined the structure at 2.3 Å resolution of the broadly neutralizing antibody b12 in complex with gp120. b12 binds to a conformationally invariant surface that overlaps a distinct subset of the CD4-binding site. This surface is involved in the metastable attachment of CD4, before the gp120 rearrangement required for stable engagement. A site of vulnerability, related to a functional requirement for efficient association with CD4, can therefore be targeted by antibody to neutralize HIV-1. Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) evades host defences thanks to its protective layers of immune camouflage. But b12 antibody pierces these barriers, so its interactions with HIV's gp120 envelope glycoprotein are of interest to vaccine and drug designers. The conformational flexibility of gp120 complicates analysis, but this obstacle has been overcome by using gp120 molecules stabilized in the CD4-bound state. Biophysical analysis with these 'frozen' gp120s shows receptor binding to occur in two steps: an initial 'handshake' followed by a shape-shifting 'bear hug'. The antibody by-passes gp120's protective shape shifting by exploiting an unexpected vulnerability of the handshake: the need for a substantial 'onrate' to efficiently engage CD4. The cover X-ray crystallographic image catches b12 antibody (green) as it grabs onto this newly identified site of vulnerability (yellow)."

Here we report three converging lines of evidence, drawn from siblings, that support the hypothesis that kin detection mechanisms exist in humans. These operate by computing, for each familiar individual, a unitary regulatory variable (the kinship index) that corresponds to a pairwise estimate of genetic relatedness between self and other. The cues that the system uses were identified by quantitatively matching individual exposure to potential cues of relatedness to variation in three outputs relevant to the system's evolved functions: sibling altruism, aversion to personally engaging in sibling incest, and moral opposition to third party sibling incest. As predicted, the kin detection system uses two distinct, ancestrally valid cues to compute relatedness: the familiar other's perinatal association with the individual's biological mother, and duration of sibling coresidence."

https://openalex.org/W2070479548,"Background The invention of the Genome Sequence 20™ DNA Sequencing System (454 parallel sequencing platform) has enabled the rapid and high-volume production of sequence data. Until now, however, individual emulsion PCR (emPCR) reactions and subsequent sequencing runs have been unable to combine template DNA from multiple individuals, as homologous sequences cannot be subsequently assigned to their original sources. Methodology We use conventional PCR with 5′-nucleotide tagged primers to generate homologous DNA amplification products from multiple specimens, followed by sequencing through the high-throughput Genome Sequence 20™ DNA Sequencing System (GS20, Roche/454 Life Sciences). Each DNA sequence is subsequently traced back to its individual source through 5′tag-analysis. Conclusions We demonstrate that this new approach enables the assignment of virtually all the generated DNA sequences to the correct source once sequencing anomalies are accounted for (miss-assignment rate<0.4%). Therefore, the method enables accurate sequencing and assignment of homologous DNA sequences from multiple sources in single high-throughput GS20 run. We observe a bias in the distribution of the differently tagged primers that is dependent on the 5′ nucleotide of the tag. In particular, primers 5′ labelled with a cytosine are heavily overrepresented among the final sequences, while those 5′ labelled with a thymine are strongly underrepresented. A weaker bias also exists with regards to the distribution of the sequences as sorted by the second nucleotide of the dinucleotide tags. As the results are based on a single GS20 run, the general applicability of the approach requires confirmation. However, our experiments demonstrate that 5′primer tagging is a useful method in which the sequencing power of the GS20 can be applied to PCR-based assays of multiple homologous PCR products. The new approach will be of value to a broad range of research areas, such as those of comparative genomics, complete mitochondrial analyses, population genetics, and phylogenetics."
https://openalex.org/W2103811383,"Parametric kernel methods currently dominate the literature regarding the construction of animal home ranges (HRs) and utilization distributions (UDs). These methods frequently fail to capture the kinds of hard boundaries common to many natural systems. Recently a local convex hull (LoCoH) nonparametric kernel method, which generalizes the minimum convex polygon (MCP) method, was shown to be more appropriate than parametric kernel methods for constructing HRs and UDs, because of its ability to identify hard boundaries (e.g., rivers, cliff edges) and convergence to the true distribution as sample size increases. Here we extend the LoCoH in two ways: “fixed sphere-of-influence,” or r-LoCoH (kernels constructed from all points within a fixed radius r of each reference point), and an “adaptive sphere-of-influence,” or a-LoCoH (kernels constructed from all points within a radius a such that the distances of all points within the radius to the reference point sum to a value less than or equal to a), and compare them to the original “fixed-number-of-points,” or k-LoCoH (all kernels constructed from k-1 nearest neighbors of root points). We also compare these nonparametric LoCoH to parametric kernel methods using manufactured data and data collected from GPS collars on African buffalo in the Kruger National Park, South Africa. Our results demonstrate that LoCoH methods are superior to parametric kernel methods in estimating areas used by animals, excluding unused areas (holes) and, generally, in constructing UDs and HRs arising from the movement of animals influenced by hard boundaries and irregular structures (e.g., rocky outcrops). We also demonstrate that a-LoCoH is generally superior to k- and r-LoCoH (with software for all three methods available at http://locoh.cnr.berkeley.edu)."

https://openalex.org/W2026112119,"The negative binomial distribution is used commonly throughout biology as a model for overdispersed count data, with attention focused on the negative binomial dispersion parameter, k. A substantial literature exists on the estimation of k, but most attention has focused on datasets that are not highly overdispersed (i.e., those with k>or=1), and the accuracy of confidence intervals estimated for k is typically not explored.This article presents a simulation study exploring the bias, precision, and confidence interval coverage of maximum-likelihood estimates of k from highly overdispersed distributions. In addition to exploring small-sample bias on negative binomial estimates, the study addresses estimation from datasets influenced by two types of event under-counting, and from disease transmission data subject to selection bias for successful outbreaks.Results show that maximum likelihood estimates of k can be biased upward by small sample size or under-reporting of zero-class events, but are not biased downward by any of the factors considered. Confidence intervals estimated from the asymptotic sampling variance tend to exhibit coverage below the nominal level, with overestimates of k comprising the great majority of coverage errors. Estimation from outbreak datasets does not increase the bias of k estimates, but can add significant upward bias to estimates of the mean. Because k varies inversely with the degree of overdispersion, these findings show that overestimation of the degree of overdispersion is very rare for these datasets."

Recently, we demonstrated that Mdm2, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, whose most prominent known function is to target and degrade p53, associates with and ubiquitinates the IGF-1R (8Girnita L. Girnita A. Larsson O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 8247-8252Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Under conditions where expression of p53 was inhibited, Mdm2 was redistributed and caused ubiquitination and proteasome-dependent degradation of the IGF-1R. However, the Mdm2 E3 ligase cannot interact directly with IGF-1R but requires β-arrestin as an adaptor (9Girnita L. Shenoy S.K. Sehat B. Vasilcanu R. Girnita A. Lefkowitz R.J. Larsson O. J. Biol.

By comparing the efficiencies of the two isoforms β-arrestin 1 and 2 in this context, β-arrestin1 was found to be superior in facilitating ubiquitination in IGF-1-stimulated cells (9Girnita L.

Cancer. 2005; 92: 2097-2101Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar).The role of β-arrestin in IGF-1R ubiquitination was unexpected because its functions have generally been associated with G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), also called seven transmembrane receptors (7TMRs) (11Lefkowitz R.J.

Arriza J.L. Aoki C. Dawson T.M. Codina J. Kwatra M.M. Snyder S.H. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17882-17890Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Lohse M.J. Benovic J.L. Codina J. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Science. 1990; 248: 1547-1550Crossref PubMed Scopus (897) Google Scholar). Further work has shown that β-arrestin not only acts as an endocytic adaptor for various 7TMRs, but also functions as a scaffolding molecule for activation of MAPKs as well as other signaling pathways (11Lefkowitz R.J. Shenoy S.K. Science. 2005; 308: 512-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (1408) Google Scholar). β-Arrestin can mediate ERK signaling in the absence of any detectable second messenger activity (15Reiter E. Lefkowitz R.J. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2006; 17: 159-165Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). Moreover, for some receptors such as the angiotensin II type 1a receptor, β-arrestins compartmentalize the signaling complexes in cytoplasmic endosomes. Upon recruitment to agonist-occupied 7TMRs on the cell membrane, β-arrestin is ubiquitinated by Mdm2 and then brings the receptors into endosomal vesicles (16Shenoy S.K. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol.

Science. 2001; 294: 1307-1313Crossref PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar). Additionally, β-arrestin ubiquitination has been shown to regulate both trafficking and ERK activation kinetics (18Shenoy S.K. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 15315-15324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). In the context of these observations and our previous finding that β-arrestin associates with the IGF-1R, we now sought to investigate whether β-arrestin and its ubiquitination play roles in IGF-1-induced signaling, with a focus on activation of ERKs and control of the cell cycle.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESReagents—Polyclonal IGF-1R antibodies (C-20 and H-60), a monoclonal antibody to phosphotyrosine (PY99), were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Santa Cruz, CA.

The R-,R+, 46, 56, and 96 mouse cell lines were from Dr. Renato Baserga (Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, PA). The cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. R-,R+, R-46, R-56, and R-96 cell lines were cultured in the presence of G-418 (Promega). Wild type, Mdm2 KO, and β-arrestin mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEFs) were cultured as described elsewhere (19McMasters K.M. Montes de Oca Luna R. Pena J.R. Lozano G.

The siRNA sequences targeting human β-arrestin1 and β-arrestin2 have been reported previously (20Ahn S. Nelson C.D. Garrison T.R. Miller W.E. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 1740-1744Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar) and were used to deplete endogenous β-arrestin levels in BE cell line. The siRNA sequences targeting mouse β-arrestin1 and 2 are 5′-AAAGCCUUCUGUGCUGAGAAC-3′ and 5′-AAGGACCGGAAAGUGUUCGUG-3′. A non-silencing RNA duplex (5′-AAUUCUCCGAACGUGUCACGU-3′), as the manufacturer indicated, was used as a control for both human and mouse cells.Transfections—40-50% confluent cells in 25-cm2 flasks, split 24 h before transfection, were transfected with siRNA (see above) using the Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the modified manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, 10 μl of transfection reagent was added to 300 μl of serum-free media, while RNA mixtures containing 12 μl of 20 μm (3.5 μg) RNA, and 188 μl of media were prepared. Both solutions were allowed to stand 5-10 min at room temperature and mixed by inversion. After a 10-20-min incubation at room temperature, the entire transfection mixture was added to cells in a flask containing 3-4 ml of fresh, serum-free media. After cells were incubated for 24 h at 37 °C, the media was replaced with normal (serum-containing) growth media. After additional incubation for 24 h, cells were divided into two flasks or 6-well plates for further experiments. All assays were performed at least 2 days after siRNA transfection. Transfections with pcDNA3 β-arrestin1 and 2 and Mdm mutants were performed as described elsewhere (17Shenoy S.K. McDonald P.H. Kohout T.A. Lefkowitz R.J. Science. 2001; 294: 1307-1313Crossref PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar).Immunoprecipitation—The isolated cells were lysed as described previously (21Girnita L. Wang M. Xie Y. Nilsson G. Dricu A. Wejde J. Larsson O. Anticancer Drug Des. 2000; 15: 67-72PubMed Google Scholar). 15 μl of protein G plus-A/G agarose and 1 μg of antibody were added to 1 mg of protein material. After overnight incubation at 4 °C on a rocker platform, the immunoprecipitates were collected by centrifugation in a microcentrifuge at 2,500 rpm for 2 min. The supernatant was discarded, whereupon the pellet was washed and then dissolved in a sample buffer for SDS-PAGE.SDS-PAGE and Western Blotting—Protein samples were dissolved in a sample buffer containing 0.0625 m Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 20% glycerol, 2% SDS, bromphenol blue, and dithiothreitol. Samples corresponding to 5-50 μg of cell protein were analyzed by SDS-PAGE with a 7.5 or 10% separation gel. Molecular weight markers (Bio-Rad) were run simultaneously. Following SDS-PAGE, the proteins were transferred overnight to nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham Biosciences, Uppsala, Sweden) and then blocked for 1 h at room temperature in a solution of 5% (w/v) skimmed milk powder and 0.02% (w/v) Tween 20 in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.5. Incubation with appropriate primary antibodies was performed for 1h at room temperature. This was followed by washes with phosphate-buffered saline and incubation with either a horseradish peroxidase-labeled or a biotinylated secondary antibody (Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h. Following the biotinylated secondary antibody, incubation with streptavidin-labeled horseradish peroxidase was performed. The detection was made with either ECL, Amersham Biosciences or by Supersignal West Pico reagents (Pierce). The films were scanned and quantified by Fluor-S imager (Bio-Rad).Immunofluorescence Confocal Microscopy—BE cells were plated on collagen-coated 35-mm glass bottom plates. After experimental conditions, cells were fixed with 5% formaldehyde diluted in phosphate-buffered saline containing calcium and magnesium before confocal analyses. For immunostaining endogenously expressed β-arrestins, polyclonal β-arrestin1/2 antibody, and anti-rabbit ALEXA 594 (Molecular Probes) were used as primary and secondary antibodies, respectively.Cell Cycle and Proliferation Analysis—Cell cycle analysis was performed with a FACS Calibur machine from Becton Dickinson. Following indicated experimental conditions cells were detached with Non-enzymatic Cell dissociation solution from Sigma, and centrifuged for 4 min at 4 °C at 1000 rpm. After two washes with phosphate-buffered saline, cells were incubated for 30 min with 70% ice-cold ethanol on ice. After another two washes, cells were centrifuged and pellet-stained with propidium iodide (50 μg/ml, Sigma) with added RNase A (20 μg/ml, Sigma) and analyzed by flow cytometry using the CellQuest® Program.RESULTSRole of β-Arrestin1 in IGF-1-induced ERK Phosphorylation—We first investigated the requirement of β-arrestin1 in IGF-1-activated ERK1/2 phosphorylation. We performed kinetic experiments (0-60 min) in wild-type and β-arrestin1 knockout (KO) MEFs and analyzed the activation of ERK in whole cell lysates. As shown in Fig. 1A, ERK1/2 in wild-type MEFs is phosphorylated after IGF-1 stimulation with a peak at 5-10 min, after which pERK declined substantially. In β-arrestin1 KO MEFs, on the other hand, ERK1/2 remained essentially inactivated upon IGF-1R stimulation (Fig. 1A). However, when the β-arrestin1 KO MEFs were transfected with β-arrestin1, ERK was strongly phosphorylated (Fig. 1, A and B). Although activity peaked at 5 min, it was quite persistent even after 60 min of IGF-1 stimulation (Fig. 1, A and B). This suggests that β-arrestin1 is not only necessary for IGF-1-induced ERK phosphorylation, but also that it prolongs the time course of ERK activation.The effects of β-arrestin depletion (Fig. 1C) obtained by siRNA on IGF-1R signaling in the human melanoma cell line BE were also examined. Cells transfected with control siRNA responded to IGF-1 with ERK phosphorylation (Fig. 1C). In BE cells transfected with β-arrestin1 siRNA no pERK signals were detected (Fig. 1, C and D). These data provide further evidence that β-arrestin1 is necessary for IGF-1-induced ERK activation. We also investigated whether β-arrestin2 played a similar role. However, no significant reduction in IGF-1-stimulated pERK was observed in BE cells transfected with β-arrestin2 siRNA (Fig. 1, C and D). In contrast, down-regulation of β-arrestin2 levels led to an increase in both basal and IGF-1-stimulated ERK activity that was sustained up to 60 min (Fig. 1, C and D). This denotes that β-arrestin1 but not β-arrestin2 plays an obligatory role in this ERK pathway.Trafficking and Ubiquitination of β-Arrestin1 following IGF-1 Stimulation—The persistent β-arrestin1-dependent ERK activity promoted by the IGF-1Rs emulates the situation observed with 7 transmembrane receptors such as the AT1aR that recruit β-arrestin2 to endosomal vesicles (22Tohgo A. Choy E.W. Gesty-Palmer D. Pierce K.L. Laporte S. Oakley R.H. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Luttrell L.M. J. Biol.

As shown in Fig. 2, under unstimulated conditions, endogenous β-arrestins are diffusely distributed in the cytoplasm as determined by immunostaining with an antibody that detects both β-arrestin isoforms. BE cells treated with control siRNA or siRNA to β-arrestin1 were serum-starved and then either stimulated or not with IGF-1 for 30 min. In the cells treated with control siRNA, ligand stimulation resulted in distinct β-arrestin-containing vesicles (Fig. 2). However, these vesicles did not appear in cells transfected with β-arrestin1 siRNA (Fig. 2), confirming that β-arrestin1 was specifically recruited to these endosomal compartments. Quite surprisingly, when the BE cells were depleted of β-arrestin2 by siRNA transfection, we observed constitutive endosomal distribution of β-arrestin1. This β-arrestin1 recruitment became more robust upon stimulation of the IGF-1R (bottom panels, Fig. 2), consistent with the observed pattern of ERK activation (Fig. 1).FIGURE 2Subcellular distribution of β-arrestin1 after IGF-1 stimulation. BE cells were transfected with control siRNA (top panels), β-arrestin1 siRNA (middle panels), or β-arrestin2 siRNA (bottom panels). The cells either remained unstimulated (left panels) or were stimulated with IGF-1 (50 ng/ml) for 30 min (right panels) and subsequently fixed and permeabilized. Cellular distribution of β-arrestin was visualized by immunolabeling with anti-β-arrestin antibody and then an Alexa594 secondary antibody followed by confocal microscopy.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Previous studies on agonist-stimulated GPCRs have demonstrated that β-arrestin has to remain stably ubiquitinated to localize on endosomes (18Shenoy S.K. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 15315-15324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Similarly, we find that both β-arrestin1 and 2 are ubiquitinated in IGF-1R-stimulated WT MEF cells. The specificity of detection of ubiquitinated β-arrestin is shown in Fig. 3A. In the ubiquitin immunoprecipitates β-arrestins were detected as discrete single bands, rather than smears, suggesting that β-arrestins are monoubiquitinated or oligoubiquitinated under these conditions. Ubiquitinated β-arrestin1 was not observed in β-arrestin1 KO and β-arrestin 1 + 2 KO MEFs, but was detectable in β-arrestin2 KO cells. As also shown, the amount of ubiquitinated β-arrestin2 was much less than that of β-arrestin1 in response to IGF-1 stimulation (Fig. 3A).FIGURE 3Mdm2 mediates ubiquitination and promotes intracellular trafficking of β-arrestin1 upon IGF-1R stimulation. A, wild type and β-arrestin1 KO MEFs were serum-depleted for 24 h, remained untreated (negative control) or stimulated with IGF-1 for 10 min and then analyzed for ubiquitination of β-arrestin1 and 2. This was performed by immunoprecipitating the cell lysates with an antibody to ubiquitin (P4D1) and immunoblotting with an antibody recognizing both β-arrestin1 and 2. B, Mdm2 KO MEFs were transfected with empty vector (Mock) or WT Mdm2, serum-starved, and finally stimulated with IGF-1. Ubiquitination of β-arrestin1 and 2 was assayed as described above. Middle and bottom panels show levels of β-arrestins and actin in protein lysate, respectively. C, effects of Mdm2 on the cellular distribution of β-arrestin1. BE cells were transfected with vector or WT Mdm2 (Mdm21-491), serum-depleted for 24 h, and analyzed for β-arrestin with and without IGF-1 stimulation as in Fig. 2. The level of Mdm2 was confirmed by Western blot.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)β-Arrestins have also been shown to be ubiquitinated by Mdm2 upon ligand activation of GPCRs, and this ubiquitination influences their biological roles (17Shenoy S.K. McDonald P.H. Kohout T.A. Lefkowitz R.J. Science. 2001; 294: 1307-1313Crossref PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar). To determine whether Mdm2 is involved in IGF-1-induced ubiquitination of β-arrestin1, we stimulated Mdm2 KO MEFs with IGF-1 and examined β-arrestin ubiquitination as indicated above. Fig. 3B shows that β-arrestin1 was not ubiquitinated in these cells unless they were transfected with WT Mdm2. This finding suggests that Mdm2 E3 ligase is responsible for ubiquitination of β-arrestin1 in response to IGF-1 stimulation. In addition, Mdm2 could also enhance the endosomal recruitment of β-arrestin under both basal and IGF-1 stimulated conditions (Fig. 3C, compare vector-transfected cells with Mdm2-transfected cells). In fact, unstimulated Mdm2-overexpressing cells also exhibited some clearly visible β-arrestin-positive endosomal vesicles (compare with control, upper panels of Figs. 3 and 2). Thus, IGF-1 stimulation results in recruitment of β-arrestin into intracellular vesicles, which is enhanced by Mdm2, perhaps by regulating β-arrestin ubiquitination status.Role of Mdm2 in IGF-1-induced ERK Phosphorylation—Because Mdm2 enhanced IGF-1-stimulated β-arrestin recruitment, we sought to determine if Mdm2 overexpression had any effect on IGF-1-stimulated β-arrestin-dependent ERK activation. Mdm2 KO MEFs were transfected with either empty vector (mock) or Mdm21-491 (WT Mdm2) (17Shenoy S.K. McDonald P.H. Kohout T.A. Lefkowitz R.J. Science. 2001; 294: 1307-1313Crossref PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar). The transfectants were serum-depleted overnight and stimulated with IGF-1 or serum and then assessed for phosphorylation of ERK1/2. The expression level of transfected Mdm2 is confirmed in the top panel of Fig. 4A. Phosphorylation of ERK1/2 in mock-transfected Mdm2 KO MEF cells increased only slightly with IGF-1 stimulation (Fig. 4A, left bottom panel). However, after introduction of the WT Mdm2 into these cells, a strong and rapid (5 min.) phosphorylation of both ERK1p42 and ERK2p44occurred. Upon stimulation with serum instead of IGF-1, phosphorylation of ERKs increased strongly in both mock and Mdm2-transfected Mdm2 KO cells (Fig. 4A, right panel) but was stabilized by Mdm2. This suggests that serum-induced ERK activation mediated by other growth factor receptor pathways is not dependent on Mdm2. Data from three experiments are presented in Fig. 4B, which suggest that Mdm2 is important for IGF-1-induced activation of ERK1/2.FIGURE 4Requirement of Mdm2 for IGF-1-induced activation of ERK phosphorylation. A, p53 and Mdm2-negative mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) were transfected with empty vector (Mock) or WT Mdm2. After 24-h samples were taken for analysis of Mdm2 expression (left upper panel) (A, top panel). Cells were transferred to dishes, and 24 h later, they were serum-depleted overnight and then stimulated with IGF-1 (50 ng/ml) or serum (10%) for 5, 10, and 20 min and assessed for pERK/ERK1/2 (A, bottom panel). B, pERK signals from the above experiments were quantified and normalized to loading controls. Means and S.D. of three experiments are shown. C, the human melanoma cell line BE was transfected with the empty vector, Mdm21-400 (dominant negative, DN Mdm2) or WT Mdm2 constructs. The expression levels of the Mdm2 constructs are shown in the upper panel. The cells were serum-depleted overnight and then stimulated with IGF-1 (50 ng/ml) for 2, 5, 10, 30, or 60 min. The lysates were analyzed for pERK/ERK1/2 and by Western blotting. D, the pERK signals from the above experiments (shown in A) were quantified and normalized to loading controls. Means and S.D. of three experiments are shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To gain insight about the cooperative roles of Mdm2 and β-arrestin in ERK activity in BE cells, we compared the effects of two different Mdm2 constructs. In addition to WT Mdm2, we made use of Mdm21-400, which like WT Mdm2 binds β-arrestin but lacks the ligase domain. Mdm21-400 (DN Mdm2) was recently shown to exert a dominant-negative effect in the sense that it blocked Mdm2-dependent ubiquitination of IGF-1R (9Girnita L. Shenoy S.K. Sehat B. Vasilcanu R. Girnita A. Lefkowitz R.J. Larsson O. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 24412-24419Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). BE cells were transfected with empty vector, DN Mdm2, or WT Mdm2, serum-starved, and treated with IGF-1 for 2-60 min. The expression of the Mdm2 constructs is confirmed in the top panel of Fig. 4C. Fig. 4C also shows that stimulation with IGF-1 for 5-10 min induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation in control cells (mock-transfected). DN Mdm2 completely blocked IGF-1-stimulated ERK activation, whereas ectopic expression of WT Mdm2 in BE cells resulted in increased ERK phosphorylation (compare with mock), which also occurred in the unstimulated cells (Fig. 4C). Quantification of the signals is illustrated graphically in Fig. 4D and demonstrates the persistence of the IGF-stimulated ERK activity (Fig. 4D).IGF-1-induced ERK Activation Can Occur with Impaired IGF-1R Tyrosine Kinase Signaling (TKS)—We next analyzed whether IGF-1R tyrosine kinase activity was required for the IGF-1-stimulated ERK pathway. For this purpose we utilized R-cells (IGF-1R KO) and R+ (R-cells stably transfected with WT IGF-1R) as negative and positive controls, respectively. In addition, we used “46 cells” that are R-cells stably transfected with an IGF-1R construct possessing a mutation in the substrate binding site (SBS) (Y950F), which does not recruit and activate Shc and IRS1, the two major transducers of IGF-1R signaling. This cell line has been shown to be deficient in IGF-1R tyrosine kinase signaling (24Dews M. Prisco M. Peruzzi F. Romano G. Morrione A. Baserga R. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 1289-1300Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). We also tested “56 cells,” which are R-cells stably transfected with IGF-1R with a truncated C-terminal domain and “96 cells,” which are R-cells expressing IGF-1R with both SBS mutation (Y950F) and truncated C terminus. Fig. 5A (right panels) verifies ligand-induced phosphorylation of IGF-1R in all cell lines except R-.R+ cells were responsive to IGF-1 in terms of ERK and Akt phosphorylation with an activity peak at 5 min. Surprisingly, ERK1/2 is phosphorylated in IGF-1-stimulated 46 cells whereas Akt is not. Compared with R+ cells, ERK phosphorylation in 46 cells is weaker and exhibits a later activity peak (30 min) (Fig. 5B). In 56 cells, IGF-1 induces phosphorylation of Akt but has only a weak and transient ERK1/2 activation (Fig. 5, A and B), suggesting that the C-terminal domain of IGF-1R is important for ERK activation. In 96 cells, with combined mutations, neither ERK1/2 nor Akt phosphorylation was stimulated by IGF-1. These data suggest that the recruitment of Shc and IRS proteins is critical only for the Akt pathway but not for ERK activation upon IGF-1R stimulation.FIGURE 5IGF-1-induced activation of ERK but not Akt can occur independently of the tyrosine kinase signaling pathways. A,R+ (overexpressing WT IGF-1R), 46 (R-stably transfected with IGF-1R with a mutation in SBS), 56 (R-stably transfected with IGF-1R and lacking the C-terminal), R-96 cells (R-stably transfected with IGF-1R with a mutation in SBS and lacking the C-terminal and with a mutation in SBS), and R-(IGF-1R KO) cells were serum-depleted for 24 h and then stimulated with IGF-1 for 0, 2, 5, 10, 30, and 60 min. Cell lysates were assayed for pERK1/2/ERK1/2 (left panels), pAkt/Akt (middle panels), and pIGF-1R/IGF-1R (right panels). B, pERK signals from the above experiments on R+, 46, 56, 96, and R-cells (shown in A) were quantified and normalized to loading controls. The graphs show means and S.D. from three experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)β-Arrestin Recruitment, Ubiquitination, and Signaling to ERK via IGF-1R Mutant Defective in TKS—To investigate possible involvement of β-arrestin1 in TKS-independent ERK activation, we first analyzed the association of β-arrestin1 with the different IGF-1R constructs. β-Arrestin has previously been shown to associate with WT IGF-1R (9Girnita L.

This indicates that β-arrestin1 is physically bound to the C-terminal domain of the receptor. We also investigated intracellular redistribution of β-arrestin in 46 cells. Fig. 6B shows that"
https://openalex.org/W1993326082,"The known galaxies most dominated by dark matter (Draco, Ursa Minor and Andromeda IX) are satellites of the Milky Way and the Andromeda galaxies. They are members of a class of faint galaxies, devoid of gas, known as dwarf spheroidals, and have by far the highest ratio of dark to luminous matter. None of the models proposed to unravel their origin can simultaneously explain their exceptional dark matter content and their proximity to a much larger galaxy. Here we report simulations showing that the progenitors of these galaxies were probably gas-dominated dwarf galaxies that became satellites of a larger galaxy earlier than the other dwarf spheroidals. We find that a combination of tidal shocks and ram pressure swept away the entire gas content of such progenitors about ten billion years ago because heating by the cosmic ultraviolet background kept the gas loosely bound: a tiny stellar component embedded in a relatively massive dark halo survived until today. All luminous galaxies should be surrounded by a few extremely dark-matter-dominated dwarf spheroidal satellites, and these should have the shortest orbital periods among dwarf spheroidals because they were accreted early."
https://openalex.org/W2005196594,"E-cadherin is a member of the cadherin family of Ca2+-dependent cell-cell adhesion molecules. E-cadherin associates with β-catenin at the membrane-distal region of its cytosolic domain and with p120 at the membrane-proximal region of its cytoplasmic domain. It has been shown that a pool of cell surface E-cadherin is constitutively internalized and recycled back to the surface. Further, p120 knockdown by small interference RNA resulted in dose-dependent elimination of cell surface E-cadherin. Consistent with these observations, we found that selective uncoupling of p120 from E-cadherin by introduction of amino acid substitutions in the p120-binding site increased the level of E-cadherin endocytosis. The increased endocytosis was clathrin-dependent, because it was blocked by expression of a dominant-negative form of dynamin or by hypertonic shock. A dileucine motif in the juxtamembrane cytoplasmic domain is required for E-cadherin endocytosis, because substitution of these residues to alanine resulted in impaired internalization of the protein. The alanine substitutions in the p120-uncoupled construct reduced endocytosis of the protein, indicating that this motif was dominant to p120 binding in the control of E-cadherin endocytosis. Therefore, these results are consistent with the idea that p120 regulates E-cadherin endocytosis by masking the dileucine motif and preventing interactions with adaptor proteins required for internalization.

Cadherins are a family of structurally and functionally related molecules that mediate Ca2+-dependent cell-cell adhesion in a homophilic manner (1Takeichi M. Development. 1988; 102: 639-655Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Gumbiner B.M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 6: 622-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (1199) Google Scholar). Ca2+ protects the extracellular domains of cadherins from proteolytic degradation and is necessary for their function. Cadherin-based adhesion is a central determinant of cell patterning during development and is necessary for the preservation of established tissue architecture in mature organisms. E-cadherin is a prototypic member of the family and is required for the establishment and maintenance of cell-cell adhesion and cell polarity in epithelia and plays key roles in tissue morphogenesis and tumorigenesis. Genetic studies have shown that E-cadherin is essential for epithelial integrity during development in Xenopus and mice (3Levine E. Lee C.H. Kintner C. Gumbiner B.M. Development. 1994; 120: 901-909Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Hermiston M.L. Gordon J.I. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 489-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar, 5Young P. Boussadia O.

At the cellular level, E-cadherin facilitates assembly of specialized intercellular junctions (desmosomes, gap, and tight junctions) necessary to link epithelial cells into functional monolayers (6Gumbiner B.

Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 415-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). The adhesive strength of cell-cell contacts depends on factors such as dimerization and lateral clustering of cadherin molecules (8Shapiro L. Fannon A.M. Kwong P.D. Thompson A. Lehmann M.S. Grubel G.

Cadherins also form high affinity complexes with catenins and other molecules that participate in the overall function and stability of adherens junctions (10Ozawa M. Baribault H. Kemler R.

E-cadherin interacts with β-catenin and α-catenin, which links the complex to the actin cytoskeleton (11Ozawa M. Kemler R. J.

Science. 1998; 279: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5199) Google Scholar) and have been implicated in remodeling actin for the regulation of E-cadherin-mediated adhesion (14Takaishi K. Sasaki T.

The trafficking of E-cadherin, its delivery to or removal from the cell surface, is one aspect of cadherin regulation that is not yet thoroughly understood. There is a growing body of evidence that shows that cell surface E-cadherin can be endocytosed and trafficked back into the cell. Ca2+ depletion induces internalization of cadherins and the subsequent disruption of junctions (16Kartenbeck J. Schmelz M. Franke W.W. Geiger B. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 881-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 17Kamei T. Matozaki T. Sakisaka T. Kodama A. Yokoyama S. Peng Y.F. Nakano K. Takaishi K. Takai Y.

It was shown that E-cadherin undergoes endocytosis and recycling in Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) 2The abbreviations used are: MDCK, Madin-Darby canine kidney cell; EA substitution, amino acid substitutions in which two conserved glutamic acid residues and a conserved aspartic acid residue in the p120-binding site were substituted with alanine residues; GFP, green fluorescent protein; HA, hemagglutinin; LA substitution, amino-acid substitutions in which a dileucine motif was changed to a dialanine motif; mAb, monoclonal antibody; siRNA, small interference RNA; Ecad, E-cadherin; EAEcad, Ecad with EA substitution; LAEcad, Ecad with LA substitution; EALAEcad, Ecad with EA and LA substitutions. 2The abbreviations used are: MDCK, Madin-Darby canine kidney cell; EA substitution, amino acid substitutions in which two conserved glutamic acid residues and a conserved aspartic acid residue in the p120-binding site were substituted with alanine residues; GFP, green fluorescent protein; HA, hemagglutinin; LA substitution, amino-acid substitutions in which a dileucine motif was changed to a dialanine motif; mAb, monoclonal antibody; siRNA, small interference RNA; Ecad, E-cadherin; EAEcad, Ecad with EA substitution; LAEcad, Ecad with LA substitution; EALAEcad, Ecad with EA and LA substitutions. cell monolayers under physiological conditions (19Le T.L. Yap A.S. Stow J.L. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 219-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). The adhesive strength at cell-cell contacts depends, in part, on the amount of E-cadherin at the cell surface (20Steinberg M.S. Takeichi M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 206-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). Therefore, endocytosis and recycling of E-cadherin provides one mechanism for dynamically regulating cadherin-based adhesion, by balancing the relative amounts of surface-exposed and sequestered intracellular E-cadherin. How the endocytosis and recycling of E-cadherin are regulated is therefore of prime importance to the control of cell-cell adhesion. In addition to β-catenin, which binds to the distal portion of the E-cadherin cytoplasmic domain, another member of the armadillo family, p120, interacts with cadherins at the membrane-proximal region of the cytosolic domain (21Reynolds A.B. Daniel J. McCrea P.D. Wheelock M.J. Wu J. Zhang Z. Mol. Cell Biol. 1994; 14: 8333-8342Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Ohkubo T. Ozawa M. J. Biol.

Reynolds A.B. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 189-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). Although not directly involved in coupling cadherins to the cytoskeleton, p120 has emerged as a critical regulator of cadherin adhesive activity and cytoskeletal organization (22Ohkubo T. Ozawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21409-21415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 23Thoreson M.A. Anastasiadis P.Z. Daniel J.M. Ireton R.C. Wheelock M.J. Johnson K.R. Hummingbird D.K. Reynolds A.B. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 189-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). In addition to regulating adhesion and actin cytoskeletal organization, recent studies have demonstrated a core function for p120 in regulating cadherin expression levels. Separate studies have shown that p120 regulates steady-state levels of E-cadherin in epithelial cells (24Davis M.A. Ireton R.C. Reynolds A.B. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 163: 525-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar) and VE-cadherin in vascular endothelial cells (25Xiao K. Allison D.F. Buckley K.M. Kottke M.D. Vincent P.A. Faundez V. Kowalczyk A.P. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 163: 535-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). In the absence of p120, cadherins become destabilized and targeted for degradation. The precise mechanism by which p120 regulates cadherin levels is not fully understood. However, several lines of evidence suggest that p120 regulates the entry of cell surface cadherins into a lysosomal degradation pathway (24Davis M.A. Ireton R.C. Reynolds A.B. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 163: 525-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar, 25Xiao K. Allison D.F. Buckley K.M. Kottke M.D. Vincent P.A. Faundez V. Kowalczyk A.P. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 163: 535-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). In the absence of p120, E-cadherin is efficiently delivered to the cell surface but is then rapidly turned over (24Davis M.A. Ireton R.C. Reynolds A.B. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 163: 525-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar). Similarly, cell surface labeling experiments indicate that p120 regulates the lysosomal degradation of cell surface pools of VE-cadherin (25Xiao K. Allison D.F. Buckley K.M. Kottke M.D. Vincent P.A. Faundez V. Kowalczyk A.P. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 163: 535-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). These data suggest that p120 likely functions at the plasma membrane to regulate cadherin internalization. In this study, we aimed to identify the amino acid residues in E-cadherin that are required for internalization of the protein. A recent study demonstrated that the signal responsible for the endocytosis of VE-cadherin resides in the cytoplasmic domain (26Xiao K. Garner J. Buckley K.M. Vincent P.A. Chiasson C.M. Dejana E. Faundez V. Kowalczyk A.P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 5141-5151Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). A candidate dileucine motif that was able to mediate association with clathrin-containing endocytic vesicles was identified at positions 587-588 in the juxtamembrane region of the E-cadherin cytoplasmic domain. These two leucine residues were substituted with two alanine residues. Endocytosis of the substituted E-cadherin was impaired, demonstrating that this motif was required for efficient internalization of the protein. Disrupting the binding of E-cadherin to p120 increased the rate at which E-cadherin was endocytosed, whereas introduction of the substitution in the p120-uncoupled construct decreased its endocytosis. Thus, the dileucine motif is dominant to p120 in the control of E-cadherin endocytosis. Based on these observations, we propose a model wherein p120 regulates E-cadherin endocytosis by masking the motif to prevent interactions with adaptor proteins required for internalization. cDNA Construction—To distinguish exogenously expressed protein from endogenous canine E-cadherin, all constructs expressed proteins fused to a hemagglutinin (HA) epitope at their carboxyl termini. Expression vectors containing the cDNAs encoding the following constructs were described previously (27Ozawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19600-19608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 28Ozawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 46014-46020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar): HA-tagged full-length E-cadherin (Ecad), and a full-length E-cadherin construct in which two conserved glutamic acid residues and a conserved aspartic acid residue in the p120-binding site were substituted with alanine residues (EAEcad). The EA substitution results in uncoupling of p120 binding (28Ozawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 46014-46020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). To mutate the two leucine residues at positions 587 and 588 to alanine residues (LA mutation) (Fig. 1B), the primer pairs 5′-CGCGGGCTCTTTGACCACCGTTCT and 5′-GCGCCACCAGATGATGATACCCGG were used. EALAEcad, a full-length E-cadherin construct carrying the EA and LA substitutions, was generated by replacing a 1938-bp SmaI-SmaI fragment from the EAEcad construct with the same fragment from the LAEcad construct. All PCR products were sequenced and subcloned into expression vectors. Expression vectors for green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged wild-type and dominant-negative dynamin IIaa, pEGFPNDyn2a and pEGFPNDyn2a(K44A), respectively (29Kasai K. Shin H.W. Shinotsuka C. Murakami K. Nakayama K. J. Biochem. 1999; 125: 780-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), were kindly provided by Dr. Kazuhisa Nakayama (Kyoto University, Japan). Cells and Transfections—MDCK cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Cells (5 × 105) were transfected with the appropriate expression vectors (10 μg) using the calcium phosphate method (10Ozawa M. Baribault H. Kemler R. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 1711-1717Crossref PubMed Scopus (1143) Google Scholar). To determine the effects of dynamin expression on the distribution of EAEcad, MDCK cell clones stably expressing EAEcad were transiently transfected with expression vectors for either wild-type or mutant dynamin using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) as described (29Kasai K. Shin H.W. Shinotsuka C. Murakami K. Nakayama K. J. Biochem. 1999; 125: 780-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). siRNAs against canine p120 were obtained from Dharmacon (Lafayette, CO), and 100 nm of four pooled siRNAs was transfected using Lipofectamine 2000. Antibodies—A mouse mAb (12CA5) directed against HA was kindly provided by Dr. Akihiko Yoshimura (Kyushu University, Japan) and was used for immunoblotting. Rat mAb against HA (3F10) and fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled 3F10 antibody were purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals (Mannheim, Germany). Rabbit anti-E-cadherin antibody was kindly provided by Dr. Rolf Kemler (Max-Planck Institut für Immunbiologie, Germany). Rabbit anti-N-cadherin antibody (H-63) was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Mouse mAbs against p120 and early endosomal antigen 1 were purchased from BD Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). LysoTracker Red DND-99 and Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated transferrin were obtained from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). All secondary antibodies were obtained from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories (West Grove, PA). Immunoblotting and Immunoprecipitation—Immunoprecipitation and immunoblot analyses were carried out as described previously (27Ozawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19600-19608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In brief, cells (2 × 106) were lysed in lysis buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, containing 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 25 μg/ml aprotinin). Immunoprecipitations were carried out with anti-HA mAb pre-absorbed to protein G-Sepharose. Fluorescence Microscopy—Immunofluorescence labeling of cells was performed as described previously (22Ohkubo T. Ozawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21409-21415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). In brief, cells were fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 20 min at room temperature. Cells were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 and incubated with primary and secondary antibodies. Cells were analyzed using a conventional Olympus fluorescence microscope (Tokyo, Japan) equipped with a CoolSNAP charge-coupled device camera (Nippon Roper). Quantification of Cell Surface E-cadherin—Cells were incubated in HEPES-buffered saline with 0.01% trypsin for 10 min at 37 °C in the presence of 2 mm Ca2+ (TC treatment) or 1 mm EGTA (TE treatment). Proteins were detected by anti-HA mAb. Cell surface E-cadherins are resistant to trypsin digestion in the presence of Ca2+ but can be degraded in the absence of Ca2+. Thus, the E-cadherin remaining after TC treatment represents the total pool of E-cadherin, whereas intracellular E-cadherin remains undigested after TE treatment. Apical and Basolateral Biotinylation—Cells (5 × 105 cells) were seeded on Transwell filters, and tight cell monolayers were incubated twice with 0.5 mg/ml sulfo-N-hydroxysuccinimidebiotin (Pierce) in either the apical or basolateral chamber at 4 °C. The cells were washed with 50 mm NH4Cl in phosphate-buffered saline at 4 °C. Cells were then stripped with 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing 1% SDS, boiled for 3 min, and passed four or five times through a 23-gauge needle. 9 volumes of 2% Triton X-100 was added, and biotinylated proteins were collected using streptavidin beads. Biotinylation Assay for Endocytosis and Recycling—The assay was performed as described with minor modifications (19Le T.L. Yap A.S. Stow J.L. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 219-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). Cells were incubated with 0.5 mg/ml sulfo-N-hydroxysuccinimide-ssbiotin at 4 °C. After washing, cells were incubated in medium containing 20 mm HEPES at 18 °C for the indicated periods of time. Cell surface biotin was removed by incubation with 60 mm glutathione or with 50 mm 2-mercaptoethanesulfonic acid at 4 °C. Cells were then lysed in lysis buffer as described above. Biotinylated proteins were collected with streptavidin beads. To measure recycling of endocytosed proteins accumulated at 18 °C, cells were stripped using glutathione or 2-mercaptoethanesulfonic acid at 4 °C and then returned to 37 °C for various times in medium containing anti-E-cadherin antibody. Cells were then washed to remove unbound antibody and lysed in lysis buffer. E-cadherin bound to anti-E-cadherin antibody during the incubation was collected using protein G-Sepharose. After washing, E-cadherin was released from the beads by boiling in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing 1% SDS. After addition of 9 volumes of 2% Triton X-100, biotinylated E-cadherin was recovered by incubation with streptavidin beads. The materials were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with anti-HA antibodies. Selective Uncoupling of p120 from E-cadherin Results in Intracellular Accumulation of the Protein—Previous studies have shown that, in MDCK cells, a pool of cell surface E-cadherin is constitutively internalized and recycled back to the surface (19Le T.L. Yap A.S. Stow J.L. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 219-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). A construct expressing wild-type E-cadherin tagged with an HA epitope (Ecad) (Fig. 1B) was introduced into MDCK cells, and stable transfectants were isolated. In confluent MDCK cells, Ecad was localized mostly on the lateral plasma membrane (Fig. 2). Substitution of the two conserved glutamic acid residues and a conserved aspartic acid residue (Glu-Glu-Asp) in the p120-binding site of E-cadherin with alanine residues has been shown to eliminate the interaction with p120 (23Thoreson M.A. Anastasiadis P.Z. Daniel J.M. Ireton R.C. Wheelock M.J. Johnson K.R. Hummingbird D.K. Reynolds A.B. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 189-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). We introduced the same substitutions into the HA-tagged full-length E-cadherin construct to yield a p120-uncoupled construct (EAEcad) (this construct is equivalent to the 764AAA mutant described by Thoreson et al. (23Thoreson M.A. Anastasiadis P.Z. Daniel J.M. Ireton R.C. Wheelock M.J. Johnson K.R. Hummingbird D.K. Reynolds A.B. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 189-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar)) (Fig. 1B). EAEcad expressed from this construct in MDCK cells did not co-precipitate p120 (Fig. 3A). In contrast to wild-type E-cadherin, a significant fraction of EAEcad was detected intracellularly (Fig. 2). To determine the origin of the intracellular EAEcad, cells were pretreated with 10 μm cycloheximide to inhibit translation and stained for the HA tag. Although some labeling in the perinuclear region, which represents the Golgi apparatus, disappeared upon treatment (data not shown), the overall localization of EAEcad was not altered significantly, indicating that the intracellular labeling did not represent a newly synthesized pool of EAEcad. Thus, although a portion of EAEcad was present on the lateral plasma membrane, the intracellular staining suggests that a significant pool of EAEcad was internalized from the cell surface. Similar changes in the cellular distribution of N-cadherin were observed after uncoupling of p120 binding (data not shown). These results are consistent with observations that p120 knockdown by siRNA expression resulted in dose-dependent elimination of cell surface E-cadherin (24Davis M.A. Ireton R.C. Reynolds A.B. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 163: 525-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar) and that overexpression of p120 selectively inhibited VE-cadherin internalization from the plasma membrane by inhibiting clathrin-dependent endocytosis of the protein (26Xiao K. Garner J. Buckley K.M. Vincent P.A. Chiasson C.M. Dejana E. Faundez V. Kowalczyk A.P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 5141-5151Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar).FIGURE 3Cell surface expression of E-cadherin and its derivatives. A, p120 did not co-precipitate with EAEcad. E-cadherin and its derivatives were collected using anti-HA antibodies, separated on a gel, and blotted with anti-HA and anti-p120 antibodies. B, TC and TE treatment showed that a significant percentage of E-cadherin and its derivatives were expressed on the surface of the cells, except for EAEcad, which had a significant presence inside the cells. Cells expressing the indicated constructs were incubated with 0.01% trypsin for 10 min at 37 °C in the presence of 2 mm Ca2+ (TC) or 1 mm EGTA (TE). Proteins were detected with anti-HA mAbs. Analysis of 2-4 other clones expressing each construct gave essentially the same results. C, quantification of the intracellular pool of E-cadherin and its derivatives. The relative amounts of the intracellular pools of wild-type and mutant E-cadherins (obtained after TE treatment) shown in B were quantified using NIH Image and expressed as a percentage of the total pool of the protein (obtained after TC treatment). D, basolateral targeting of the E-cadherins. Cells expressing the indicated constructs were grown on Transwell filters and their apical (a) or basolateral (b) membranes were biotinylated. After precipitating the biotinylated proteins using immobilized streptavidin, E-cadherins were detected using anti-HA mAbs. E, chloroquine treatment of cells did not change the expression of EAEcad. MDCK cells expressing either Ecad or EAEcad were incubated for 3 h in medium with or without 200 μm chloroquine (+ or -). The results shown in panels A, B, D, and E are typical of those obtained in three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Next, we biochemically quantified the amount of EAEcad on the surface of stably transfected MDCK cells. It is well established that Ca2+ protects cell surface cadherins from proteolytic degradation. Cells were trypsinized in the presence of Ca2+ (TC treatment) or EGTA (TE treatment) (see “Experimental Procedures”). Immunoblot analysis of cells following TC or TE treatment using anti-HA antibodies demonstrated that 90% of wild-type E-cadherin was digested following TE treatment (Fig. 3, B and C). In contrast, <40% of the p120-uncoupled construct was digested after TE treatment (Fig. 3B). Thus, <40% of EAEcad resided on the cell surface. Cell surface biotinylation of the apical and basolateral membranes of cells cultured on Transwell filters showed that EAEcad was, like wild-type E-cadherin, exclusively transported to the basolateral membrane (Fig. 3D). Therefore, intracellular accumulation of EAEcad was not caused by mis-sorting of the protein. The p120-uncoupled E-cadherin Co-localized with an Early Endosomal Antigen—To define the site of EAEcad accumulation, transfected cells were incubated with medium containing LysoTracker, a fluorescently labeled marker for lysosomes. EAEcad did not co-localize well with the lysosome marker (Fig. 4, upper panel), but a significant fraction of the protein co-localized with an early endosomal marker (30Mu F.T. Callaghan J.M. Steele-Mortimer O. Stenmark H. Parton R.G. Campbell P.L. McCluskey J. Yeo J.P. Tock E.P. Toh B.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13503-13511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar), early endosomal antigen 1 (Fig. 4, middle panel). EAEcad also co-localized with fluorescently tagged transferrin internalized from the cell surface (Fig. 4, lower panel), suggesting that it accumulates in early endosomes and that interfering with p120 binding-facilitated endocytosis. The total steady-state levels of EAEcad did not differ significantly from those of wild-type E-cadherin (Fig. 3E), consistent with the observation that EAEcad accumulated in early endosomes. Treatment of cells with chloroquine to inhibit lysosomal hydrolases did not change the expression of EAEcad (Fig. 3E). Enhanced Internalization of the p120-uncoupled E-cadherin—Accumulation of EAEcad in early endosomes suggested that interfering with p120 binding facilitated the endocytosis of the protein. To compare the extent of endocytosis of different E-cadherin proteins expressed in MDCK cells, we used a biotinylation assay (19Le T.L. Yap A.S. Stow J.L. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 219-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar) that measures the internalization of cell surface E-cadherin. Following biotinylation of cell surface proteins at 4 °C, cells were incubated for various periods of time at 18 °C, a temperature that causes the accumulation of internalized proteins in early or sorting endosomes by preventing further progression into the endocytic or recycling pathways (19Le T.L. Yap A.S. Stow J.L. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 219-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). Next, biotin was stripped from the cell surface, and the remaining sequestered biotin was measured. Under these conditions, the amount of internalized wild-type Ecad increased over the first 120 min (Fig. 5, A and B). After 2 h at 18°C, the internalized pool represented <10% of the total E-cadherin biotinylated at the beginning of the experiment. In contrast, the pool of internalized EAEcad increased more rapidly over time (Fig. 5, A and B); after 60 min, the intracellular pool of EAEcad was more than twice that of wild-type E-cadherin. Therefore, uncoupling of p120 binding to E-cadherin increases internalization of the protein. Enhanced Internalization of the p120-uncoupled E-cadherin Is Clathrin-mediated—E-cadherin endocytosis occurs via a clathrindependent pathway and can be inhibited by hypertonic shock (31Troyanovsky R.B. Sokolov E.P. Troyanovsky S.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 3484-3493Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) or dominant-negative dynamin, a GTPase that is a key regulator of clathrin-mediated endocytosis (32Paterson A.D. Parton R.G.

https://openalex.org/W2064714617,"Steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR) stimulates adrenal and gonadal steroidogenesis by increasing the influx of cholesterol into mitochondria, where it is converted to pregnenolone to initiate steroidogenesis. StAR acts on the outer mitochondrial membrane where each molecule stimulates the mitochondrial import of several hundred molecules of cholesterol, but the precise mechanism of the action of StAR remains uncertain. StAR has a sterol-binding pocket that can accommodate one molecule of cholesterol. Direct assays show that StAR can bind cholesterol with stoichiometry approaching 1:1, and several disease-causing mutants with decreased or absent activity have correspondingly decreased cholesterol binding. We show that the StAR mutant R182L, which causes severe disease and is devoid of measurable activity in transfected cells or with isolated steroidogenic mitochondria, nevertheless, can bind as much [14C]- or NBD-cholesterol as wild-type StAR under equilibrium conditions and can transfer cholesterol between liposomes in vitro. Similarly, the artificial mutant S195A had 46.5% of the activity of wild-type StAR but bound cholesterol indistinguishably from wild-type. Competition assays showed that the rate of binding (t½on) for R182L was only 36% of the wild-type and the rate of dissociation (t½off) was 57% of wild-type, whereas the t½on and t½off for S195A and S195D were essentially the same for wild-type. These data indicate that cholesterol binding and transfer activities are distinct from its activity to induce steroidogenesis. StAR appears to act by other mechanisms in addition to cholesterol binding."
https://openalex.org/W2071777774,"Background Various definitions of biological complexity have been proposed: the number of genes, cell types, or metabolic processes within an organism. As knowledge of biological systems has increased, it has become apparent that these metrics are often incongruent. Methodology Here we propose an alternative complexity metric based on the number of genetically uncorrelated phenotypic traits contributing to an organism's fitness. This metric, phenotypic complexity, is more objective than previous suggestions, as complexity is measured from a fundamental biological perspective, that of natural selection. We utilize a model linking the equilibrium fitness (drift load) of a population to phenotypic complexity. We then use results from viral evolution experiments to compare the phenotypic complexities of two viruses, the bacteriophage X174 and vesicular stomatitis virus, and to illustrate the consistency of our approach and its applicability. Conclusions/Significance Because Darwinian evolution through natural selection is the fundamental element unifying all biological organisms, we propose that our metric of complexity is potentially a more relevant metric than others, based on the count of artificially defined set of objects."
https://openalex.org/W2026116159,"The mammalian amyloid precursor protein (APP) protein family consists of the APP and the amyloid precursor-like proteins 1 and 2 (APLP1 and APLP2). The neurotoxic amyloid β-peptide (Aβ) originates from APP, which is the only member of this protein family implicated in Alzheimer disease. However, the three homologous proteins have been proposed to be processed in similar ways and to have essential and overlapping functions. Therefore, it is also important to take into account the effects on the processing and function of the APP-like proteins in the development of therapeutic drugs aimed at decreasing the production of Aβ. Insulin and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) have been shown to regulate APP processing and the levels of Aβ in the brain.

We also investigated the role of different IGF-1-induced signaling pathways, using specific inhibitors for phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK).

APP together with its paralogues, the amyloid precursor-like proteins 1 and 2 (APLP1 and APLP2), comprise the mammalian APP protein family. Although APP has been thoroughly studied, its physiological function has not yet been established, and even less is known about the two homologous proteins. Double knock-out studies in mice have indicated that APP family proteins are essential for survival and that they possess partially redundant functions (4Heber S. Herms J. Gajic V. Hainfellner J. Aguzzi A. Rülicke T. von Kretzschmar H. von Koch C. Sisodia S. Tremml P. Lipp H.P. Wolfer D.P. Müller U. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 7951-7963Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). APLP2 was suggested to play a more important role since APLP1–/–/APP–/– mice are viable and apparently normal, whereas APLP2–/–/APP–/– or APLP2–/–/APLP1–/– mice are perinatally lethal. However, gene silencing analysis in an in vitro study suggested that APLP1 rather than APLP2 may be more important for survival and differentiation (5Sakai T. Hohjoh H. Cell Biol. Int. 2006; 11: 952-956Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Earlier studies showed that the human APP gene could rescue the Drosophila homologue APPL deletion mutants, again indicating functional redundancy between the proteins in this family (6Luo L. Tully T. White K. Neuron. 1992; 9: 595-605Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). In addition, deficiency in neuronal repair mechanisms after brain injury was observed in Drosophila after deletion of the gene coding for APPL, and both human APP and APPL could induce axonal aborization (7Leyssen M. Ayaz D. Hebert S.S. Reeve S. De Strooper B. Hassan B.A. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 2944-2955Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Previously, we have shown that all members of the APP protein family are up-regulated in parallel with neurite outgrowth in human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells subjected to retinoic acid (RA) (8Adlerz L.

Functions during neurogenesis are also supported by in vivo studies in mice showing increased expression of the APP protein family during embryogenesis (9Lorent K. Overbergh L. Moechars D.

Med. 2005; 11: 464-472Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar and 18Esler W.P. Wolfe M.S. Science. 2001; 293: 1449-1454Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). Cleavage of APP at the β-secretase site leads to secretion of the large N-terminal domain (sAPPβ) and formation of a 99-amino-acid-long C-terminal membrane-bound fragment (C99). Subsequent cleavage by γ-secretase results in the parallel formation of Aβ and APP intracellular domain. However, when APP is proteolytically processed at the α-secretase site, Aβ formation is precluded. Instead, sAPPα together with an 83-amino-acid-long C-terminal membrane-bound fragment (C83) are produced. Further cleavage of C83 by γ-secretase leads to the production of APP intracellular domain and a smaller secreted peptide (p3). APLP1 and APLP2 have been shown to be proteolytically processed in similar ways (19Li Q. Südhof T.C. J. Biol.

In addition to the receptor function attributed to the full-length proteins, the secreted fragments of the APP family proteins have been proposed to play physiological roles. sAPP has been suggested to be involved in cell survival and neurite outgrowth as well as to modulate neuronal excitability, synaptic plasticity, and synaptogenesis (reviewed in Ref. 24Mattson M.P. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 1081-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (874) Google Scholar). sAPLP2 has also been shown to promote neurite outgrowth (25Cappai R. Mok S.S. Galatis D. Tucker D.F. Henry A. Beyreuther K. Small D.H. Masters C.L. FEBS Lett. 1999; 442: 95-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Previously, we showed that the processing of APP, APLP1, and APLP2 increased in response to RA and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (26Holback S. Adlerz L. Iverfeldt K. J. Neurochem. 2005; 95: 1059-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In addition, our results suggested that RA and brain-derived neurotrophic factor shifted APP processing toward the α-secretase pathway since secretion of sAPPα increased, whereas the levels of the membrane-bound C-terminal fragment C99 decreased. Under these conditions, no secretion of sAPLP1 could be detected. Growth hormones such as nerve and epidermal growth factors have also been shown to lead to secretion of sAPPα (27Refolo L.M. Salton S.R. Anderson J.P. Mehta P. Robakis N.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 164: 664-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) and sAPLP2 (23Webster M.T. Groome N. Francis P.T. Pearce B.R. Sherriff F.E. Thinakaran G. Felsenstein K.M. Wasco W. Tanzi R.E. Bowen D.M. Biochem. J. 1995; 310: 95-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 28Xu K.P. Zoukhri D. Zieske J.D. Dartt D.A. Sergheraert C. Loing E. Yu F.S. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: C603-C614Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, it was demonstrated that insulin increased extracellular levels of Aβ and sAPPα and at the same time decreased intracellular levels of Aβ (29Gasparini L. Gouras G.K. Wang R. Gross R.S. Beal M.F. Greengard P. Xu H. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 2561-2570Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, it has become evident in recent years that insulin and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) signaling, besides regulating the energy balance of the brain, also modulates cognitive processes such as learning and memory as well as neuroprotection (reviewed in Ref. 30Carro E. Torres-Aleman I. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2004; 490: 127-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). In an AD transgenic mice model, IGF-1 was demonstrated to induce Aβ clearance from the brain by up-regulating levels of transport proteins such as albumin and transthyretin (31Carro E. Trejo J.L. Gomez-Isla T. LeRoith D. Torres-Aleman I. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 1390-1397Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). IGF-1 treatment also resulted in enhanced cognitive performance, increased levels of synaptic proteins, and reduced astrogliosis associated with plaques (32Carro E. Trejo J.L. Gerber A. Loetscher H. Torrado J. Metzger F. Torres-Aleman I. Neurobiol. Aging. 2006; 27: 1250-1257Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). In addition, a positive correlation between Mini-Mental State Examination scores and serum IGF-1 concentrations in AD has been reported, and it was suggested that lower levels of IGF-1 might lead to cognitive impairment (33Watanabe T. Miyazaki A. Katagiri T. Yamamoto H. Idei T. Iguchi T. J. Am. Geriatr. Soc. 2005; 53: 1748-1753Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). These findings suggest components of the insulin/IGF-1 signaling pathways as potential therapeutic targets in AD. Many studies on AD are focused on finding means to inhibit the production and accumulation of Aβ. However, based on the proposed essential functions of the APP family, it is of importance to further elucidate how the processing of APP and the other members of the APP protein family is regulated. In this study, we show that exposure of human neuroblastoma cells to IGF-1 results in increased secretion of sAPPα, sAPLP1, and sAPLP2 as well as decreased production of Aβ. In addition, using specific inhibitors for signaling pathways activated by IGF-1, we found that phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-K), cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (cdk5), and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) have different impact on ectodomain shedding of the three homologous proteins. Cell Culture and Treatment—SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells (American Type Culture Collection) were routinely maintained in minimum essential medium with Earl's salts, 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units of/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 1% l-glutamine, and 1% non-essential amino acids as described previously (34Beckman M. Iverfeldt K. Neurosci. Lett. 1997; 221: 73-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Cells were seeded at a density of 25,000 cells/cm2 in Nunc 60-mm dishes. At 24 h as well as 4 days after seeding, the medium was changed to serum-free culture medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium:F12 with the addition of N2 supplements, 100 units of/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 1% l-glutamine). Cells were grown in 4 ml of serum-free culture medium for 6 days and then incubated for 45 min with 5 ml of serum-free culture medium devoid of insulin before treatment. Subsequently, cells were treated with 1 nm, 10 nm, or 1 μm insulin (Sigma-Aldrich) or 1, 5 or 10 nm IGF-1 (Sigma-Aldrich) for 18 h in 2 ml of serum- and insulin-free culture medium. For inhibition studies, 1 or 10 μm LY 294002 (Merck Biosciences), a specific PI3-K inhibitor, 5 or 20 μm PD 98059 (Merck Biosciences), a specific MAPK kinase (MEK) inhibitor, or 5 μm roscovitine (Sigma-Aldrich), a specific cdk5 inhibitor, was added to the cells during the washing step. The medium was then changed to serum- and insulin-free culture medium with 10 nm IGF-1 in the presence or absence of inhibitors. All cell culture reagents were purchased from Invitrogen unless otherwise indicated. Western Blot Assay—Conditioned medium (2 ml) was collected and supplemented with Complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) and concentrated as described previously (26Holback S. Adlerz L. Iverfeldt K. J. Neurochem. 2005; 95: 1059-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Cells were harvested and analyzed by Western blot assay as described previously (26Holback S. Adlerz L. Iverfeldt K. J. Neurochem. 2005; 95: 1059-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Concentrated culture medium from an equal number of cells (as determined by protein content in the cell lysate and corresponding to ∼200 μl of conditioned medium) from each culture was loaded on a 7.5% Tris-glycine polyacrylamide gel. The concentrations of antibodies used were chosen to ensure relative quantitative measurements. Primary antibody concentrations were as follows: 1:4000 for 6E10 (directed against Aβ1–17) and CT11 (directed against the C-terminal 11 amino acids of APLP1), 1:3000 for 42464 (directed against amino acids 499–557 of APLP1, cf. 11), and 1:7500 for DTII (directed against full-length APLP2), and subsequently, 1:5000 for horseradish peroxidase-coupled anti-mouse IgG, anti-rabbit IgG, and protein A. Only bands that could not be observed in the absence of primary antibodies were quantified. All Western blotting reagents were from GE Healthcare or Bio-Rad Laboratories except CT11 and DTII, which were from Calbiochem, 6E10, which was from Signet Laboratories, and protein A, which was from Sigma-Aldrich. ELISA—Conditioned medium and cell lysate were analyzed for Aβ40 in a high sensitivity sandwich ELISA according to the manufacturer (The Genetics Company Inc.). The Aβ concentration was normalized to the amount of cells in each culture (as determined by protein content in the cell lysate). Statistical Analysis—Statistical analysis was performed using analysis of variance followed by Tukey-Kramer multiple comparison test. Data are presented as mean ± S.E. unless otherwise stated. Increased Ectodomain Shedding of APP and APLP1 in Response to IGF-1—Human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells were cultured for 18 h in the absence or presence of different concentrations of insulin. Conditioned media from the cultures were analyzed by Western blot using antibodies 6E10 (directed against Aβ1–17) and 42464 (directed against amino acids 499–557 of APLP1). The results showed that treatment with 1 μm insulin led to a significantly increased secretion of both sAPPα and sAPLP1 (Fig. 1A). Since insulin at this high concentration can activate both insulin and IGF-1 receptors, the effect of different concentrations of IGF-1 on the secretion of sAPPα and sAPLP1 was also investigated. IGF-1 treatment led to an ∼10-fold increase in the release of sAPPα as well as sAPLP1 as compared with non-treated control cells (Fig. 1B). In contrast to the effects of insulin, significant effects were observed at low concentrations of IGF-1 (≥1 nm). IGF-1 treatment for 18 h did not affect the steady-state levels of the corresponding membrane-bound full-length proteins as shown by Western blot analysis of the cell lysate using antibody 6E10 and CT11 (directed against the C-terminal 11 amino acids of APLP1) (Fig. 1, C and D, and Table 1).TABLE 1Steady-state levels of full-length proteinsTreatmentAPLP1APPAPLP2MeanS.D.nMeanS.D.nMeanS.D.nControl70±10493±8488±174IGF-1100±154100±154100±364LY1089±16491±224107±393PD2092±18495±24496±364RO5106±12488±154 Open table in a new tab PI3-K, MAPK, and cdk5 Are Involved in IGF-1-induced Secretion of sAPLP1—To investigate the mechanisms that may be involved in the effects of IGF-1 on APLP1 ectodomain shedding, inhibitors for different signaling pathways were used. 10 μm specific PI3-K inhibitor LY 294002 blocked the IGF-1-induced sAPLP1 secretion by ∼90% (Fig. 2A). Furthermore, 20 μm specific MEK inhibitor PD 98059, and 5 μm specific cdk5 inhibitor roscovitine reduced the IGF-1-induced secretion of sAPLP1 by ∼60 and 40%, respectively (Figs. 2A and 3). Treatment for 18 h with either of the inhibitors did not affect steady-state levels of the membrane-bound APLP1 (Fig. 2, lower panel, and Table 1).FIGURE 3IGF-1-induced secretion of sAPPα and sAPLP1 is inhibited by the cdk5-specific inhibitor roscovitine. Shown is the relative abundance of sAPPα (open bars) and sAPLP1 (closed bars) in culture medium from SH-SY5Y cells treated with 10 nm IGF-1 in the presence or absence of 5 μm roscovitine (RO5) for 18 h as indicated.

In cells treated with IGF-1 in the presence of 10 μm LY 294002 or 5 μm roscovitine, secretion of sAPPα was reduced by ∼80% (Figs. 2B and 3). On the contrary, 20 μm specific MEK inhibitor had no effect on the IGF-1-induced secretion of sAPPα (Fig. 2B). Treatment for 18 h with inhibitors had no effect on the steady-state levels of the membrane-bound APP (Fig. 2, lower panel, and Table 1). Increased Ectodomain Shedding of APLP2 in Response to IGF-1 Does Not Involve PI3-K or MAPK—The effect of IGF-1 on the third member of the mammalian APP protein family was also investigated. Western blot analysis using antibodies DTII (directed against full-length APLP2) showed that IGF-1 significantly increased the secretion of sAPLP2 and CS GAG sAPLP2 (i.e. chondroitin sulfate glycosaminoglycan-modified sAPLP2) (Fig. 4). The increase of sAPLP2 secretion in response to 10 nm IGF-1 was not as dramatic as for APP and APLP1, ∼3-fold as compared with ∼10-fold (cf. Figs. 1 and 2). Furthermore, neither the PI3-K inhibitor nor the MEK inhibitor affected the IGF-1-induced secretion of sAPLP2 (Fig. 4). As a control, the polyvinylidene difluoride membranes were reprobed with antibody 6E10 (recognizing sAPPα) to show that in the same samples, a clear effect of the PI3-K inhibitor on the levels of sAPPα in the conditioned media could be observed (Fig. 4, B and C, upper panels). Decreased Production of Aβ40 in Response to IGF-1—To further investigate the mechanisms behind IGF-1-induced processing of APP, conditioned medium and cell lysate were analyzed for Aβ40 by a high sensitive sandwich ELISA (Table 2). After treatment with IGF-1, the levels of both intra- and extracellular Aβ40 were decreased by ∼30%. Effects of inhibitors for different signaling pathways were also analyzed, showing that in the presence of 10 μm LY 294002, the IGF-1-induced decrease in Aβ40 levels was reversed. However, as for the IGF-1-induced effects on sAPPα, 20 μm specific MEK inhibitor had no effect.TABLE 2Production of Aβ40 is reduced by IGF-1 treatmentTreatmentExtracellular levels of Aβ40Intracellular levels of Aβ40pg/μg of proteinnpg/μg of proteinnControl0.64±0.128*2.2±0.38**IGF-10.43±0.1381.6±0.38LY100.70±0.157**2.1±0.47*PD200.45±0.127NDRO50.66±0.263ND Open table in a new tab Previous studies have shown that processing of APP and secretion of sAPP increase in response to insulin (35Solano D.C. Sironi M. Bonfini C. Solerte S.B. Govoni S. Racchi M. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 1015-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). In the concentration range used (10 nm–1 μm), insulin can activate both the insulin and the IGF-1 receptor. The affinity of insulin and IGF-1 to their receptors lies within the range of 0.1–10 nm, whereas 100–500-fold higher concentrations are required for cross-activation of the receptors (reviewed in Ref. 36Navarro I. Leibush B. Moon T.W. Plisetskaya E.M. Banos N. Mendez E. Planas J.V. Gutierrez J. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. B. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1999; 122: 137-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells, used in the present study, have previously been shown to express functional insulin and IGF-1 receptors (37Mattsson M.E. Hammerling U. Mohall E. Hall K. Pahlman S. Growth Factors. 1990; 2: 251-265Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 38Kim B. van Golen C.M. Feldman E.L. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 130-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Our results suggest that the increased levels of sAPPα and sAPLP1 in response to either IGF-1 or insulin were mediated by activation of IGF-1 receptors. Activation of insulin and IGF-1 receptors triggers two major signaling pathways, the PI3-K or MAPK cascades that ultimately lead to proliferation, differentiation, or survival (reviewed in Ref. 39Dupont J. Dunn S.E. Barrett J.C. LeRoith D. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 2003; 58: 325-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). It has previously been shown that high concentrations of insulin regulate sAPP release via a PI3-K-dependent signaling pathway (35Solano D.C. Sironi M. Bonfini C. Solerte S.B. Govoni S. Racchi M. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 1015-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). We observed that a specific PI3-K inhibitor totally abolished the increase in sAPPα levels in response to IGF-1. In contrast, a specific MEK inhibitor did not significantly reduce the elevated levels of sAPPα, excluding the involvement of the MAPK signaling cascade. Previously, we have shown that RA increases the secretion of sAPPα concomitant with neurite outgrowth (8Adlerz L. Beckman M. Holback S. Tehranian R. Cortes Toro V. Iverfeldt K. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 2003; 119: 62-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 26Holback S. Adlerz L. Iverfeldt K. J. Neurochem. 2005; 95: 1059-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). PI3-K signaling has been shown to be required for RA-induced differentiation of SH-SY5Y cells (40Lopez-Carballo G. Moreno L. Masia S. Perez P. Barettino D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25297-25304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). It can be speculated that effects on sAPPα secretion and neurite outgrowth are mediated by the same signaling pathways. However, both PI3-K and MAPK were shown to be involved in IGF-1-induced neurite outgrowth in SH-SY5Y cells (38Kim B. van Golen C.M. Feldman E.L. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 130-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In addition, it has also been shown that RA increases the expression of cdk5 and p35 as well as stimulates neurite outgrowth through the MAPK pathway in another human neuroblastoma cell line (41Lee J.H. Kim K.T. J. Neurochem. 2004; 91: 634-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Here we observed that a specific cdk5 inhibitor completely blocked the IGF-1-induced secretion of sAPPα, suggesting that cdk5 plays a central role in the IGF-1-induced processing of APP. Indeed, several other studies have indicated a connection between cdk5 and APP. On one hand, a novel neuroprotective function of sAPP in preventing tau hyperphosphorylation via suppression of overactivation of cdk5 has been suggested (42Han P. Dou F. Li F. Zhang X. Zhang Y.W. Zheng H. Lipton S.A. Xu H. Liao F.F. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 11542-11552Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). On the other hand, cdk5 has been suggested to be involved in the regulation of APP processing. Activation of cdk5 by overexpression of p25 or p35 in SH-SY5Y cells led to phosphorylation of APP at Thr-668 (43Liu F. Su Y. Li B. Zhou Y. Ryder J. Gonzalez-DeWhitt P. May P.C. Ni B. FEBS Lett. 2003; 547: 193-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The same study also showed that activation of cdk5 in cells overexpressing APP with the Swedish mutation resulted in higher levels of secreted Aβ, sAPPβ, and sAPPα without affecting the steady-state levels of APP. The same group also reported that inhibition of cdk5 by roscovitine led to increased hippocampal levels of Aβ in an AD mice model (44Ryder J. Su Y. Liu F. Li B. Zhou Y. Ni B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 312: 922-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Thus, the role of cdk5 in Aβ production and accumulation is not completely clear. Enhanced production, aberrant catabolism, or abnormal transport of Aβ across the blood-brain barrier are processes that all could contribute to increased levels of Aβ inside the brain. Several enzymes have the capability to cleave Aβ, and neprilysin has been suggested to play the most important role (reviewed in Ref. 45Wang D.S. Dickson D.W. Malter J.S. J. Biomed. Biotechnol. 2006; 200658406Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Another physiologically relevant Aβ-degrading enzyme is insulin-degrading enzyme (46Kurochkin I.V. Goto S. FEBS Lett. 1994; 345: 33-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). As substrates, insulin and Aβ will compete for insulin-degrading enzyme. It has been speculated that age-related reduction of IGF-1 signaling leads to decreased transport of Aβ over the blood-brain barrier. The resulting elevated levels of Aβ in the brain may in turn lead to antagonized insulin receptor binding (loss of insulin sensitivity). As a consequence, increased insulin levels may follow and interfere with Aβ degradation and further contribute to increased Aβ load in the brain (30Carro E. Torres-Aleman I. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2004; 490: 127-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). In our study, we showed that IGF-1 led to a reduction in intraas well as extracellular levels of Aβ40 and that the PI3-K inhibitor totally reversed these effects. On the other hand, PD 98059 had no effect on secreted Aβ40 levels, again indicating that MAPK is not involved in IGF-1-induced processing of APP. The levels of secreted Aβ42, considered to be the most toxic form, were close to, or below, the detection limit, and accurate measurements could not be obtained (data not shown). However, the effects on Aβ42 secretion in response to the various treatments were similar to the effects on Aβ40 and, likewise, the presence of the PI3-K inhibitor resulted in significantly increased levels of Aβ42 (p < 0.01, n = 6). Together, our results clearly indicate that IGF-1 treatment leads to a shift in APP processing toward the α-secretase pathway instead of the amyloidogenic pathway. Previously, it has been proposed that the members of the APP family are processed in a similar way (19Li Q. Südhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 10542-10550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 20Pastorino L. Ikin A.F. Lamprianou S. Vacaresse N. Revelli J.P. Platt K. Paganetti P. Mathews P.M.

Chem. 2004; 279: 18146-18156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). In this study, a cell line with endogenous expression of all three proteins in the mammalian APP family was used. We observed that processing of APP and APLP1 and secretion of sAPPα and sAPLP1 were increased to the same extent in response to insulin or IGF-1. As for sAPPα, the IGF-1-induced increase in sAPLP1 returned to control levels after treatment with LY 294002 and was partly inhibited by roscovitine. Interestingly, and in contrast to sAPPα, PD 98059 inhibited the IGF-1-induced sAPLP1 release. APP and APLP2 are considered to be the most closely related members of the APP family. Contradictorily, we show that the PI3-K inhibitor that totally blocked the sAPPα secretion did not have any effect on the secretion of sAPLP2 or CS GAG sAPLP2. However, similar to sAPPα, and in contrast to sAPLP1, the MEK inhibitor did not affect the IGF-1-induced secretion of sAPLP2. A previous study from our group also indicated differences in the regulation of the processing of the APP protein family (8Adlerz L. Beckman M. Holback S. Tehranian R. Cortes Toro V. Iverfeldt K. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 2003; 119: 62-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). These data suggested that a PKC inhibitor, curcumin, had no effect on APLP1, blocked APLP2, and partly blocked APP ectodomain shedding. The results from our two studies indicate that the regulation of APLP1 and APLP2 is more different from each other than from APP. In conclusion, in the present study, we show that ectodomain shedding of the APP family is induced by IGF-1. However, the effect of inhibitors specific for different signaling pathways indicates that the mechanisms behind the IGF-1-induced processing of the different APP family proteins are not identical. We propose that PI3-K is involved in ectodomain shedding of APP and APLP1, but not APLP2, and that MAPK is involved only in the ectodomain shedding of APLP1. In addition, cdk5 was shown to be involved in the processing of both APP and APLP1. Proteolytic processing of APP and APLPs may be modulated by regulation of enzyme activity, by specific post-translational modifications of the substrate, or by altered subcellular localization of the substrate or the enzyme. More studies are needed to put together all the clues about the processing and the signaling pathways involved. This will lead to a more complete understanding of the physiological function of the APP protein family."
https://openalex.org/W1976641624,"Background Pakistan, among the other developing countries, has a higher prevalence rate of depression because of the current social adversities. There is, thus, a great need for systematic studies on prevalence of depression. The current study aims at exploring the prevalence of depression among households in three capital cities of Pakistan. Methodology and Principal Findings A sample of N = 820 was randomly selected, and a cross sectional telephone-based study was conducted for a duration of six months. It was found that there was a regional variation in prevalence rates for depression among the three cities. Lahore had the highest number of depressives (53.4%), as compared to Quetta (43.9%) and Karachi (35.7%). Middle age, female gender and secondary school level of education were significantly associated with depression among the study group. Conclusions/Significance The different rates of prevalence among the three cities could be attributed to local cultural influence, geographical locations and social adversities. There is a need for revision of existing health policy by the government."
https://openalex.org/W2040050240,"Mdm2 is a member of the RING finger family of ubiquitin ligases and is best known for its role in targeting the tumor suppressor p53 for ubiquitination and degradation. Mdm2 can bind to itself and to the structurally related protein MdmX, and these interactions involve the RING finger domain of Mdm2 and MdmX, respectively. In this study, we performed a mutational analysis of the RING finger domain of Mdm2, and we identified several amino acid residues that are important for Mdm2 to exert its ubiquitin ligase function. Mutation of some of these residues interfered with the Mdm2-Mdm2 interaction indicating that a homomeric complex represents the active form of Mdm2. Mutation of other residues did not detectably affect the ability of Mdm2 to interact with itself but reduced the ability of Mdm2 to interact with UbcH5. Remarkably, MdmX efficiently rescued the ubiquitin ligase activity of the latter Mdm2 mutants in vitro and within cells. Because the interaction of Mdm2 with MdmX is more stable than the Mdm2-Mdm2 interaction, this suggests that Mdm2-MdmX complexes play a prominent role in p53 ubiquitination in vivo. Furthermore, we show that, similar to Mdm2, the Mdm2-MdmX complex has Nedd8 ligase activity and that all mutations that affect the ubiquitin ligase activity of Mdm2 also affect its Nedd8 ligase activity. From a mechanistic perspective, this suggests that the actual function of Mdm2 and Mdm2-MdmX, respectively, in p53 ubiquitination and in p53 neddylation is similar for both processes.

Covalent modification of proteins by ubiquitin (“ubiquitination”) is a selective process and plays an important role in the control of many fundamental cellular processes (1Pickart C.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 503-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (2887) Google Scholar, 2Glickman M.H. Ciechanover A. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 373-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (3304) Google Scholar, 3Kerscher O.

Specific recognition of substrate proteins of the ubiquitin-conjugation system is mainly mediated by the action of ubiquitin-protein ligases (E3). 2The abbreviations used are: E3, ubiquitin-protein ligase; GST, glutathione S-transferase; HA, hemagglutinin; E2, ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme. 2The abbreviations used are: E3, ubiquitin-protein ligase; GST, glutathione S-transferase; HA, hemagglutinin; E2, ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme. Based on the presence of distinct amino acid sequence motifs, proteins with E3 activity can be roughly grouped into three classes as follows: HECT domain E3s, RING finger E3s, and U-box E3s. Structural studies indicate that RING finger domains and U-box domains adopt similar structural folds providing an interface for the interaction with their cognate E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes (4Zheng N.

Because specific recognition of substrate proteins is mediated by regions other than the RING finger or the U-box, it is commonly assumed that RING finger/U-box E3s function as adaptor proteins bringing E2s and substrate proteins into proper orientation for E2-mediated ubiquitination. HECT domain E3s have a similar modular structure (i.e. the HECT domain is responsible for the interaction with cognate E2s; substrate recognition is mediated by regions other than the HECT domain), but in contrast to RING finger or U-box E3s, HECT domain E3s appear to play a direct catalytic role in the covalent attachment of ubiquitin to substrate proteins (10Huibregtse J.M. Scheffner M. Beaudenon S. Howley P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92 (Correction (1995) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Homo-oligomerization and/or hetero-oligomerization affect the activity of the respective E3s and involve physical contacts between the respective RING finger or U-box domains. Examples for hetero-oligomer formation between RING finger/U-box E3s include the BRCA1-BARD1 complex, the Mdm2-MdmX complex, and the Bmi1-Ring1b complex (13Brzovic P.S. Rajagopal P. Hoyt D.W.

Thus, RING finger and U-box domains cannot only serve as interfaces for interaction with E2s but also for interaction with other E3s.Mdm2 and MdmX are structurally related proteins insofar as both contain an N-terminal p53-binding domain, a central zinc-binding motif, and a C-terminal RING finger domain (15Sharp D.A.

Mdm2- and MdmX-deficient mice, respectively, die early in embryogenesis, although at different stages, and the respective lethal phenotype is rescued by concomitant loss of p53 expression (18Montes de Oca Luna R.

In addition, data obtained with conditional knockout mice indicate that Mdm2 and MdmX act synergistically in p53 regulation but that MdmX has also Mdm2-independent functions in p53 regulation (22Grier J.D.

However, the functional consequences of the interaction of Mdm2 with MdmX with respect to the E3 activity of Mdm2 are still controversially discussed. Results obtained in overexpression studies suggest that binding of MdmX interferes with the E3 activity of Mdm2 (15Sharp D.A. Kratowicz S.A. Sank M.J. George D.L. J. Biol.

In contrast, in vitro ubiquitination experiments indicate that binding of MdmX stimulates the E3 activity of Mdm2 (28Badciong J.C. Haas A.L. J. Biol.

A. 2003; 100: 12009-12014Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it was recently shown that, in addition to its function in p53 ubiquitination, Mdm2 facilitates the modification of p53 with the ubiquitin-like protein Nedd8 (32Xirodimas D.P. Saville M.K. Bourdon J.C. Hay R.T. Lane D.P. Cell. 2004; 118: 83-97Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). At present it is not known whether MdmX affects the Nedd8 ligase activity of Mdm2.To further characterize the ubiquitin and Nedd8 ligase activity of Mdm2 and the effect of MdmX on these Mdm2 activities, we performed a mutational analysis of the RING finger domain of Mdm2. The results obtained indicate that the ability of Mdm2 to form homomeric complexes is required for both its ubiquitin ligase and its Nedd8 ligase activity. Furthermore, we show that both the ubiquitin ligase and the Nedd8 ligase activity of some of the Mdm2 mutants are efficiently rescued by MdmX in vitro and within cells. This supports the notion that the Mdm2-MdmX complex has intrinsic E3 activity and is actively involved in ubiquitination and neddylation of p53 in vivo.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Lines and Plasmids—H1299 cells and HEK293T cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum. Bacterial expression constructs for glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins of wild-type Hdm2 and HdmX were described previously (29Linares L.K. Hengstermann A. Ciechanover A. Muller S. Scheffner M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 12009-12014Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Bacterial expression constructs for GST fusion proteins of Mdm2, MdmX, and various RING finger mutants of Mdm2 and Hdm2, respectively (see Fig. 1), were generated by PCR-based approaches (further details will be provided upon request). The expression constructs used in transient transfection experiments (Fig. 4) encoding wild-type Mdm2 (pCocMdm2), wild-type p53, His-tagged ubiquitin, and HA-tagged HdmX were described previously (29Linares L.K.

For transient expression of Mdm2 mutants (see Fig. 4), the respective mutations were introduced by site-directed mutagenesis PCR into the wild-type Mdm2 cDNA within the frame of pCocMdm2. His-tagged Nedd8 was expressed from the eukaryotic expression vector pSG5.0 (Stratagene). For yeast two-hybrid assays, the respective cDNAs (Mdm2, Mdm2 mutants, HdmX, UbcH5b; see Table 1) were cloned into the expression vectors pGBKT7 and pGADT7 (Clontech).FIGURE 4HdmX rescues both the ubiquitin ligase activity and the Nedd8 ligase activity of Mdm2 mutants within cells. A, H1299 cells were cotransfected with expression constructs for p53, His-tagged ubiquitin (His-ub), and wild-type (wt) Mdm2 or the indicated Mdm2 mutants in the absence or presence of expression constructs for HA-tagged HdmX as indicated. Protein extracts were prepared 24 h after transfection, and 70% of the extract was used to isolate ubiquitinated proteins by Ni2+-affinity chromatography. Upon affinity purification, levels of ubiquitinated p53 were determined by Western blot analysis with the p53-specific antibody DO1. The remaining 30% of the respective cell extracts were used to determine the expression levels of HA-HdmX. Note that under the conditions used, it was not possible to determine the expression levels of wild-type Mdm2 and the Mdm2 mutants. To ensure that HdmX expression does not affect the expression of Mdm2 and the Mdm2 mutants, similar experiments were performed with HEK293T cells. This showed that HdmX rescues the ubiquitin ligase activity of the Mdm2 mutants without affecting their expression levels (supplemental Fig. 5). Asterisk denotes ubiquitinated forms of p53. B, to score for p53 degradation, cotransfection experiments were performed as described in A but in the absence of the His-tagged ubiquitin expression construct and with lower amounts of the p53 expression construct (see “Experimental Procedures”). Protein extracts were prepared 24 h after transfection and adjusted according to transfection efficiency, and levels of p53 were determined by Western blot analysis using the p53-specific antibody DO1. Loading of the individual lanes is as indicated for A. C, H1299 cells were cotransfected with expression constructs for p53, His-tagged Nedd8, and wild-type (wt) Mdm2 or the indicated Mdm2 mutants in the absence or presence of expression constructs for HA-tagged HdmX as indicated. Protein extracts were prepared 24 h after transfection and neddylated proteins purified by Ni2+-affinity chromatography. Upon affinity purification, levels of neddylated p53 were determined by Western blot analysis with the p53-specific antibody DO1. Asterisk denotes neddylated forms of p53.

Protein extracts were prepared 24 h after transfection (see below), and transfection efficiency was determined by measuring β-galactosidase activity. Levels of p53 or ubiquitinated p53, HA-tagged HdmX, and Mdm2, respectively, were determined by Western blot analysis by using transfection efficiency adjusted protein amounts. The antibodies used for detection were the mouse monoclonal antibody HA.11 (Hiss Diagnostics, Freiburg, Germany) for HA-tagged HdmX, the mouse monoclonal antibody DO1 (Calbiochem) for p53, and the mouse monoclonal antibody SMP14 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) that detects both Mdm2 and Hdm2.Ubiquitination, Neddylation, and Degradation Assays—For in vitro ubiquitination experiments, wild-type Mdm2, Hdm2, and HdmX and the various Mdm2 and Hdm2 mutants were expressed as GST fusion proteins in Escherichia coli DH5α.

Whitaker N.J. Zimmer D. Zentgraf H. Scheffner M. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 2933-2941Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) to determine the transfection efficiency (see above).

For neddylation of p53 within cells, the same procedure was applied by using an expression construct for His-Nedd8.To monitor degradation of ectopically expressed p53 within cells, one 6-cm plate of H1299 cells was transfected with expression constructs encoding p53 (10 ng), Mdm2 or the respective Mdm2 mutants (200 ng), and HdmX (600 ng).

Briefly, 1 μg of the respective plasmids (see Table 1) was transformed, and transformed cells were selected by growth in media deficient of leucine and tryptophan. After 3 days, cells were streaked on three different reporter plates (deficient of histidine, adenine, and uracil, respectively), and growth of the cells followed for up to 5 days. The relative strength of the individual protein/protein interactions is indicated by the ability of the respective cells to grow on the different reporter plates. Growth on uracil-deficient plates requires stronger interaction of the respective proteins than growth on adenine-deficient plates, whereas growth on histidine-deficient plates requires the least efficient interaction (37Butz K.

In the following, there will be no differentiation between Mdm2 and Hdm2, because similar results were obtained with both Mdm2 mutants and the respective Hdm2 mutants. Based on the crystal structure of the U-box E3 Prp19, a dimeric structure has been proposed for the Mdm2 RING finger domain with four hydrophobic residues (Ile-448, Leu-456, Ile-483, and Leu-485; Fig. 1) being critically involved in the formation of the dimer interface (38Vander Kooi C.W.

To test whether these residues may indeed be required for Mdm2-Mdm2 interaction and possibly the E3 activity of Mdm2, cDNAs encoding single point mutants of Mdm2, in which the respective amino acid residues are substituted by glutamate, were generated by PCR-based mutagenesis. In addition, a cDNA encoding a truncated form of Mdm2 devoid of the seven C-terminal residues was generated. Because the efficiency of Mdm2-Mdm2 interaction is rather low under standard in vitro coprecipitation conditions (data not shown), the binding abilities of the various mutants were determined in the yeast two-hybrid system (16Tanimura S. Ohtsuka S. Mitsui K. Shirouzu K. Yoshimura A. Ohtsubo M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 447: 5-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). This revealed that, with the exception of Mdm2L485E, the ability of the mutants to interact with themselves or with wild-type Mdm2 was significantly reduced (Table 1).To test the E3 activity of the various Mdm2 mutants, the respective proteins were expressed as GST fusion proteins in E. coli. Upon purification, the Mdm2 mutants were tested in vitro for their ability to ubiquitinate in vitro translated 35S-labeled p53, MdmX, and wild-type Mdm2, respectively (Figs. 1 and 2). Similar to the results obtained in the yeast two-hybrid system, with the exception of Mdm2L485E, the E3 activity of the Mdm2 mutants was significantly reduced, regardless of the ubiquitination substrate. Furthermore, the Mdm2 mutants were inactive in in vitro auto-ubiquitination assays (data not shown). Although these data do not prove that Ile-448, Leu-456, Ile-483, and the very C-terminal 7 residues are directly involved in the formation of Mdm2 homomers (note that it is referred to homomers rather than homodimers because the exact oligomeric state of full-length Mdm2 is not known), they indicate that these residues are critical for both Mdm2-Mdm2 interaction and the E3 activity of Mdm2.The RING finger domain of Mdm2 contains a putative WalkerA motif (amino acid residues 446–452; Fig. 1) and has been shown to bind ATP (39Poyurovsky M.V. Jacq X. Ma C. Karni-Schmidt O. Parker P.J. Chalfie M. Manley J.L. Prives C. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 875-887Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Although the ability of Mdm2 to bind ATP is not required for its E3 activity, the glycine residues of the WalkerA motif (Gly-446 and Gly-451) and the threonine residue (Thr-453) adjacent to the WalkerA motif were subjected to mutational analysis, because Thr-453 has been assumed to be involved in coordinating Zn2+, and thus, the region surrounding Thr-453 may be critical for structural integrity of the RING finger domain (40Boddy M.N. Freemont P.S. Borden K.L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 198-199Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The respective point mutants were tested for their ability to interact with themselves and with wild-type Mdm2, respectively, and for E3 activity as described above. Surprisingly, Thr-453 was not essential for the ability of Mdm2 to form homomers (Table 1) indicating that Thr-453 is not directly involved in Zn2+ binding (see “Discussion”). Similarly, mutation of Gly-446 or Gly-451 did not detectably affect Mdm2-Mdm2 interaction. However, the E3 activity of Mdm2G451S, Mdm2T453C, and Mdm2T453A was significantly reduced in vitro (Figs. 1 and 2), whereas Gly-446 appeared to be less critical for E3 activity. Together with the notion that Cys-447 of Mdm2 is critical for E3 activity but not for Mdm2-Mdm2 interaction (data not shown), the results obtained indicate that the region encompassing residues 447–453 is of critical importance for Mdm2 E3 activity.MdmX Rescues the Ubiquitin Ligase Activity of Mdm2-Hdm2 Mutants in Vitro—Mouse MdmX and its human ortholog HdmX can form heteromeric complexes with Mdm2 and were reported to stimulate the E3 activity of Mdm2 (15Sharp D.A.

The role of Zn2+ in vision is likely related, in part, to rhodopsin, the light receptor that initiates phototransduction in the rod outer segments (ROS) 5The abbreviations used are: ROS, rod outer segment; AFM, atomic force microscopy; F-D, force-distance; GPCR, G protein-coupled receptor; MD, molecular dynamics; SMFS, single-molecule force spectroscopy; WLC, worm-like chain. 5The abbreviations used are: ROS, rod outer segment; AFM, atomic force microscopy; F-D, force-distance; GPCR, G protein-coupled receptor; MD, molecular dynamics; SMFS, single-molecule force spectroscopy; WLC, worm-like chain. of retinal photoreceptor cells (4Palczewski K.

Eye Res. 1996; 15: 1019-1024Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Furthermore, changes are observed in the pattern of thermal bleaching and regeneration of rhodopsin by 11-cis-retinal in the presence and absence of Zn2+ (6Stojanovic A. Stitham J. Hwa J. J. Biol.

Rhodopsin in native ROS disc membranes has been previously characterized by single-molecule force spectroscopy (SMFS) to reveal the molecular interactions that stabilize the dark state of the receptor (9Sapra K.T. Park P.S. Filipek S. Engel A. Muller D.J. Palczewski K. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 358: 255-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The receptor is organized into several stable structural segments that present barriers to unfolding. Forces required to unfold these segments provide a direct measure of the molecular interactions stabilizing the protein in a particular region. SMFS has also been used to characterize the molecular interactions underlying the stability of a few other membrane proteins including bacteriorhodopsin and halorhodopsin from Halobacterium salinarium (10Oesterhelt F.

The sensitivity of SMFS assays enables one to probe the effects of environmental factors like temperature, pH, ion concentration, and oligomeric assembly on the molecular interactions stabilizing a protein (12Kedrov A.

In the current study, we use SMFS to monitor the effect of Zn2+ on molecular interactions stabilizing dark-state rhodopsin. Force-distance (F-D) curves obtained from native bovine ROS disc membranes in the presence of Zn2+ revealed that the location of stable structural segments in rhodopsin is unaffected by the inclusion of this bivalent metal ion. However, forces required to unfold these segments in the presence of Zn2+ were significantly increased. Thus, Zn2+ appears to strengthen the molecular interactions that stabilize the native structure of rhodopsin. ROS Disc Membrane Preparation—All experimental procedures were carried out under dim red light. Centrifugation steps were performed at 4 °C. ROS were purified from fresh bovine retinas as described (17Papermaster D.S. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 81: 48-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar) and stored at -80 °C. To obtain disc membranes, ROS membranes were resuspended using a glass hand-held homogenizer with 13 ml of buffer A (2 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4) and incubated overnight at 4 °C. The membrane suspension was centrifuged at 26,500 × g for 30 min. Membranes were then washed twice with 13 ml of buffer A and three times with 3 ml of buffer B (2 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 2mm EDTA, pH 7.4), after collecting each time by centrifugation at 26,500 × g for 30 min. Membranes resuspended in buffer A were used for SMFS and atomic force microscopy (AFM) imaging. Alternatively, membranes were resuspended in buffer C (67 mm potassium phosphate, 1 mm magnesium acetate, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 18% sucrose, pH 7.0) and stored at -80 °C. Membranes stored in buffer C were washed twice with buffer A prior to SMFS studies. SMFS—SMFS was performed as described previously (9Sapra K.T. Park P.S. Filipek S. Engel A. Muller D.J. Palczewski K. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 358: 255-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Disc membranes were adsorbed onto freshly cleaved mica surface. Rhodopsin was attached nonspecifically to Si3N4 cantilevers (NPS, Veeco Metrology; nominal spring constant ≈0.08 newton/m) by applying a contact force of ≈1 nN between the AFM stylus and the membrane surface. After a contact time of ≈0.5-1 s, the stylus was retracted from the membrane surface at a constant velocity of 300 nm/s. Experiments were performed on Picoforce (dI-Veeco, USA) and Multimode (dI-Veeco, USA) AFM instruments. Spring constants for AFM cantilevers were calibrated in buffer solution by use of the equipartition theorem (18Butt H.-J. Jaschke M. Nanotechnology. 1995; 6: 1-7Crossref Scopus (1313) Google Scholar, 19Florin E.-L. Rief M. Lehmann H. Ludwig M. Dornmair C. Moy V.T. Gaub H.E. Biosens. Bioelectron. 1995; 10: 895-901Crossref Scopus (415) Google Scholar). All cantilevers exhibited similar spring constants within the uncertainty of the calibration method (≈10%). All SMFS experiments were performed in SMFS assay buffer (150 mm KCl, 25 mm MgCl2, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.8) at room temperature, unless indicated otherwise. In experiments where membranes were treated with ZnCl2 (Fluka, Sigma), CaCl2 (Merck, Sigma), CdCl2 (Sigma), CoCl2 (Sigma), or CuCl2 (Sigma), the assay buffer was supplemented with the specified concentrations of bivalent metal ions. ROS disc membranes were diluted in assay buffer supplemented with metal ions and incubated on ice for 40-60 min in complete darkness. When membranes were treated with EDTA (Sigma), MgCl2 was excluded from the assay buffer. F-D curves were collected over a period of less than 1 h. Selection and Analysis of F-D Curves—F-D curves were first separated based on length (9Sapra K.T. Park P.S. Filipek S. Engel A. Muller D.J. Palczewski K. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 358: 255-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). All F-D curves exhibiting similar overall unfolding spectra and lengths were selected and aligned using identical procedures and criteria established previously (20Müller D.J. Kessler M. Oesterhelt F. Moller C. Oesterhelt D. Gaub H. Biophys. J. 2002; 83: 3578-3588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Every peak of a single F-D curve was fitted using the worm-like chain (WLC) model with a persistence length of 0.4 nm (21Rief M. Gautel M. Oesterhelt F. Fernandez J.M. Gaub H.E. Science. 1997; 276: 1109-1112Crossref PubMed Scopus (2595) Google Scholar). The number of extended amino acid residues at each peak was calculated from the contour length obtained from the WLC fits assuming an amino acid residue length of 0.36 nm. This approach allowed assignment of unfolding events to structural segments of rhodopsin as described previously (20Müller D.J. Kessler M. Oesterhelt F. Moller C. Oesterhelt D. Gaub H. Biophys. J. 2002; 83: 3578-3588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Molecular Dynamics (MD) Simulations—Rhodopsin monomers and dimers were immersed in a membrane composed of dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine phospholipids. The final system contained 153 dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine molecules for the rhodopsin monomer (Protein Data Bank code 1U19) and 105 for the rhodopsin dimer (PDB code 1N3M). Positions of Zn2+ were taken from the most updated rhodopsin crystal structures: site 1 from 1GZM and sites 2-4 from 1U19. Periodic box dimensions were 6.33 × 6.33 × 11.0 and 10.0 × 6.33 × 11.0 nm for the rhodopsin monomer and dimer, respectively. Each Zn2+ was given a charge of +2. A simple point charge water model (22van der Spoel D. van Maaren P.J. Berendsen H.J.C. J. Chem. Phys. 1998; 108: 10220-10230Crossref Scopus (542) Google Scholar) was used and counterions were added to maintain an overall charge equal to zero. The particle mesh Ewald procedure (23Darden T.

Initial equilibration of the system was performed by 500 ps MD with Cα atoms of rhodopsin and all Zn2+ frozen. During subsequent 1000 ps MD the Cα atoms and Zn2+ were restrained to their initial positions using harmonic potentials. In MD simulations testing the stability of Zn2+ in its binding sites, Zn2+ was initially positioned in each of the crystal structure binding sites with the freedom to move and Cα atoms of rhodopsin were restrained to their initial positions with harmonic potential. MD simulations were conducted in Gromacs (25Van Der Spoel D. Lindahl E. Hess B. Groenhof G. Mark A.E. Berendsen H.J. J. Comput. Chem. 2005; 26: 1701-1718Crossref PubMed Scopus (11231) Google Scholar) using the standard ffgmx forcefield modified for describing lipids (26Berger O. Edholm O. Jahnig F. Biophys. J. 1997; 72: 2002-2013Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1602) Google Scholar). Unfolding Single Rhodopsin Molecules from Native ROS Disc Membranes—Native ROS disc membranes containing rhodopsin were studied by SMFS (9Sapra K.T. Park P.S. Filipek S. Engel A. Muller D.J. Palczewski K. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 358: 255-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Discs flatly adsorbed onto supporting mica were predominantly burst open and displayed a raft-like organization of rhodopsin (9Sapra K.T. Park P.S. Filipek S. Engel A. Muller D.J. Palczewski K. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 358: 255-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 27Fotiadis D. Liang Y. Filipek S. Saperstein D.A. Engel A. Palczewski K. Nature. 2003; 421: 127-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar). Single rhodopsin molecules were attached nonspecifically to an AFM stylus. This molecular bridge established between the AFM stylus and the receptor was used to exert a mechanical pulling force sufficient to unfold the protein. The nonspecific nature of protein attachment to the AFM stylus resulted in interactions with both the terminal region and loops of rhodopsin. Only curves with lengths corresponding to the full-length of the rhodopsin polypeptide chain were selected for analysis. This selection criterion ensured that the F-D curves analyzed represent the unfolding of rhodopsin from its terminal region into an entirely stretched conformation. Previous characterization of disc membranes by SMFS revealed that the membranes adsorbed onto the supporting mica predominantly expose the extracellular surface of rhodopsin (9Sapra K.T. Park P.S. Filipek S. Engel A. Muller D.J. Palczewski K. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 358: 255-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Thus, SMFS pulling occurs from the amino-terminal region of rhodopsin. Two major classes of F-D curves were detected that correspond to the unfolding of an entire rhodopsin polypeptide chain. Curves with a length of ≈65 nm correspond to the unfolding of rhodopsin with an intact native disulfide bond between Cys110 and Cys187 and curves of length ≈95 nm correspond to the unfolding of rhodopsin in the absence of the native disulfide bond (9Sapra K.T. Park P.S. Filipek S. Engel A. Muller D.J. Palczewski K. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 358: 255-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Only curves of length ≈65 nm were considered in WLC model analyses (Fig. 1). Each force peak of F-D curves was fit using the WLC model, which describes the stretching of a polymer of a given length (21Rief M. Gautel M. Oesterhelt F. Fernandez J.M. Gaub H.E. Science. 1997; 276: 1109-1112Crossref PubMed Scopus (2595) Google Scholar). This procedure revealed the number of unfolded residues stretched above the membrane surface for a particular force peak, and allowed us to locate molecular interactions established by the protein and map such information on to the secondary structure of rhodopsin (Fig. 2).FIGURE 2Secondary structure of rhodopsin mapped with stable structural segments. Values from WLC model fitting (Table 1, Fig. 1) were used to estimate the location of stable structural segments in the secondary structure of rhodopsin. Each stable structural segment and its name is colored differently. Arrows indicate the start and end of each structural segment, and the corresponding amino acid residue number is indicated. Numbers in brackets are the values obtained from WLC model fits, which indicate the number of amino acid residues stretched above the membrane. Zn2+-binding sites observed in crystal structures of rhodopsin are shown in white. Amino acid residues that coordinate Zn2+ at those sites are as follows: Zn2+1, Asn151 and His152;Zn2+2, Glu122 and His211;Zn2+3, Glu201 and Gln279;Zn2+4, Glu197 and His195.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Zn2+ Binding Increases the Stability of Rhodopsin—To examine the effect of Zn2+ on the molecular interactions established within rhodopsin we performed SMFS on disc membranes in SMFS assay buffer supplemented with 200 μm ZnCl2. F-D curves revealed the same location for each stable structural segment as that detected in the absence of ZnCl2 (Fig. 1, Table 1). The presence of Zn2+ increased unfolding forces and thus the strength of molecular interactions stabilizing structural segments (Fig. 3A, Table 1). Increased unfolding force was observed for all segments except for the first stable structural segment of the NH2-terminal region (N1) and the stable structural segment involving helix VII (H7). The largest force increases were observed in the four structural segments contained between extracellular loop E1 and helix VI (E1; H3, H4, C2, E2; H5, C3; H6.1). Forces required to unfold these segments were 40-46 pN higher in the presence of 200 μm ZnCl2 than in its absence. Other segments that displayed appreciable increases in unfolding force include helix I (27 pN) and the cytoplasmic tail (30 pN). All other structural regions showed more minor increases in unfolding force. The increase in forces required to overcome unfolding barriers in the presence of 200 μm ZnCl2 points to a stabilizing effect of Zn2+ on the molecular interactions in those regions.TABLE 1Unfolding forces of stable structural segments Open table in a new tab The dependence of the apparent stabilization of stable structural segments on Zn2+ concentration was characterized by performing SMFS in the presence of ZnCl2 at concentrations ranging from 0 to 400 μm (Fig. 4). All structural segments exhibiting an appreciable increase in stability in the presence of 200 μm ZnCl2 showed a clear concentration-dependent relationship with saturation occurring at ≈100 μm of the bivalent metal ion. Estimates of the EC50 for these effects were determined from concentration-dependent curves. EC50 values of 40 and 37 μm were obtained from concentration-dependent curves for structural segments H3, H4, C2, E2 and H5, C3, respectively. The EC50 values revealed from SMFS measurements are in agreement with the equilibrium dissociation constant (KD) of 2-10 μm determined biochemically for Zn2+ binding to rhodopsin (5Shuster T.A. Nagy A.K. Conly D.C. Farber D.B. Biochem. J. 1992; 282: 123-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Disc membranes studied in SMFS assays were prepared in buffer containing 2 mm EDTA, so most of the free and solvent-exposed Zn2+ should be absent. To test the completeness of Zn2+ chelation, we collected F-D curves in the presence of 1 mm EDTA. The standard SMFS assay buffer used in this study contained 25 mm MgCl2 (“Experimental Procedures”), which would interfere with the chelation of Zn2+ by EDTA. Accordingly, SMFS of disc membranes done in the presence of EDTA was performed in buffer lacking MgCl2. The absence of MgCl2 in the SMFS assay buffer did not significantly change the forces required to unfold stable structural segments (Fig. 3B). Inclusion of 1 mm EDTA resulted in a minor decrease in the externally applied force required to unfold many of the stable structural segments. A Zn2+-binding site has been proposed to reside within the transmembrane helices of rhodopsin (6Stojanovic A. Stitham J. Hwa J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 35932-35941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), which would be inaccessible to EDTA during the preparation of membranes. Unfolding of rhodopsin during SMFS might expose this site to EDTA. The total reduction of forces observed in the presence of EDTA may derive in part from the chelation of this protected Zn2+ during rhodopsin unfolding and in part to a small amount of free or solvent-exposed Zn2+ present even after disc membrane preparation. Stabilization of Rhodopsin by Zn2+ Is Specific—To determine whether the apparent stabilization of stable structural segments was due specifically to Zn2+ rather than to nonspecific electrostatic effects, other bivalent metal ions were tested. SMFS assays were performed in the presence of 200 μm CaCl2, CdCl2, CoCl2, or CuCl2. F-D curves obtained in the presence of 200 μm CuCl2 did not show any specific peaks corresponding to stable structural segments like the other metal ions (data not shown) and were not included in the analyses. Each of the other bivalent metal ions tested exhibited the same stable structural segments as those observed in the absence of added metal ions and in the presence of 200 μm ZnCl2 (Fig. 1). However, none of those bivalent metal ions were able to mimic the full effects on the magnitude of unfolding forces observed in the presence of ZnCl2 (Fig. 3A), which suggests that the apparent stabilization afforded by Zn2+ binding is specific. The increase in force required to overcome unfolding barriers observed in the presence of 200 μm ZnCl2 were partially reproducible at a couple of the stable structural segments in the presence of CdCl2 and CoCl2. In the presence of CoCl2, F-D curves displayed an equal increase in unfolding force for structural segment E3 as that observed in the presence of ZnCl2. F-D curves recorded in the presence of CdCl2 showed a marked but lower increase in unfolding force compared with those obtained with ZnCl2 in segment H5, C3. The ability of Co2+ and Cd2+ to partially mimic the effects of Zn2+ in those specific segments may indicate that these ions bind, to some extent, to Zn2+-binding sites responsible for those regions. Effect of Zn2+ on the Native Disulfide Bond between Cys110-Cys187—The native disulfide bond between Cys110 and Cys187 in rhodopsin is highly conserved among Family A G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and stabilizes the structure of this receptor. In SMFS studies, the native disulfide bond between Cys110 and Cys187 in rhodopsin remains intact in some instances but is absent in others (9Sapra K.T. Park P.S. Filipek S. Engel A. Muller D.J. Palczewski K. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 358: 255-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), resulting in two classes of F-D curves. The presence of the native disulfide bond of rhodopsin reduces the effective length of the entirely stretched polypeptide chain by 77 amino acid residues, which resulted in F-D curves with a length of ≈65 nm. F-D curves exhibiting lengths of ≈95 nm are indicative of a stretched rhodopsin molecule in the absence of the native disulfide bond. The native Cys110-Cys187 disulfide bond is likely replaced by a non-native disulfide bond between Cys185 and Cys187 during unfolding in these instances (9Sapra K.T. Park P.S. Filipek S. Engel A. Muller D.J. Palczewski K. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 358: 255-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Formation of this alternative covalent bond can be favored by environmental changes or by naturally occurring point mutations that cause destabilization or misfolding of rhodopsin, which leads in turn to retinitis pigmentosa (9Sapra K.T.

The ratio of the two classes of F-D curves was determined for each of the different ZnCl2 concentrations tested (Fig. 5). The proportion of curves representing the unfolding of rhodopsin with an intact Cys110-Cys187 disulfide bond became greater as the concentration of ZnCl2 was increased in the assay buffer. Thus, Zn2+ appears to stabilize or favor the maintenance of this disulfide bond. An increase in the proportion of curves corresponding to the unfolding of rhodopsin in the presence of the Cys110-Cys187 bond was also observed in the presence of CaCl2, CdCl2, and CoCl2. Whereas the apparent stabilization of rhodopsin indicated by increases in pulling force required to unfold structural segments appears to be a specific effect of Zn2+, the stabilization and preservation of the Cys110-Cys187 disulfide bond appears to be a result of nonspecific electrostatic effects. This nonspecific effect can involve hydrophilic residues in close proximity to Cys110 and Cys187. Alternatively, the bivalent metal ions may alter the surrounding lipid bilayer in a manner that favors the preservation of the native Cys110-Cys187 disulfide bond. SMFS on bovine ROS disc membranes was performed to elucidate the role of Zn2+ in the structure of rhodopsin. F-D curves record the unfolding pathway of individual rhodopsin molecules and provide information about the molecular interactions that stabilize the protein. Molecular interactions of the receptor stabilize structural segments that establish barriers to unfolding. The magnitude of the force required to unfold stable structural segments reflects the strength of molecular interactions stabilizing that segment (35Janovjak H. Kedrov A. Cisneros D.A. Sapra K.T. Struckmeier J. Muller D.J. Neurobiol. Aging. 2006; 27: 546-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 36Muller D.J. Sapra K.T. Scheuring S. Kedrov A. Frederix P.L. Fotiadis D. Engel A. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2006; 16: 489-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The presence of ZnCl2 in SMFS assay buffer resulted in an increase in the force required to unfold most of the stable structural segments of the receptor. The location of the stable structural segments, however, remained unchanged. The Zn2+-induced increase in the unfolding force of stable structural segments was saturable and specific to Zn2+. Thus, Zn2+ interacts specifically with rhodopsin and can alter molecular interactions within the protein that stabilizes the structure of the receptor. The stability of rhodopsin is often inferred from thermal bleaching studies. ZnCl2 (15-100 μm) increases the rate of thermal bleaching of rhodopsin, both in solution and in ROS membranes (6Stojanovic A. Stitham J. Hwa J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 35932-35941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 8del Valle L.J. Ramon E. Canavate X. Dias P. Garriga P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 4719-4724Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), suggesting that exogenous Zn2+ decreases the thermal stability of the protein. This effect is in apparent disagreement with the SMFS data. Both the SMFS and thermal bleaching data point to an effect on the structure of the receptor molecule. Thermal bleaching assays indirectly detect effects on the structure of the receptor by measuring the hydrolysis of the chromophore. It may be incorrect to assume a direct correlation between the hydrolysis rate of the chromophore and the structural stability of rhodopsin. Hence, SMFS may provide a better measure of protein stability because it directly detects molecular interactions occurring within a protein. Is the Effect of Zn2+ Physiologically Relevant?—The eye has one of the largest pools of Zn2+ in the human body and the retina, in particular, contains one of the highest concentrations of Zn2+ in ocular tissues (2Grahn B.H.

Ophthalmol. 1982; 27: 114-122Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Significant levels of chelatable Zn2+ are found in photoreceptor cells (38Ugarte M. Osborne N.N. Gen.

Acta Histochem. 1990; 89: 107-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The concentration of free Zn2+ in photoreceptor cells, however, is unknown. If the concentration of free Zn2+ in photoreceptor cells is comparable with those found in brain then it could reach the micromolar range (41Frederickson C.J. Int. Rev. Neurobiol. 1989; 31: 145-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (963) Google Scholar). This range of Zn2+ concentration suggests that the effects observed in the current study can be physiologically significant. A Zn2+-binding site in rhodopsin has been proposed to involve His211 (6Stojanovic A. Stitham J. Hwa J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 35932-35941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). H211P is a naturally occurring point mutation that causes misfolding and results in retinitis pigmentosa. Misfolding of this and other point mutants of rhodopsin results in the replacement of the native disulfide bond between Cys110 and Cys187 by the non-native disulfide bond between Cys185 and Cys187 (29Hwa J. Klein-Seetharaman J. Khorana H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4872-4876Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Disruption of the Zn2+-binding site involving His211 has been proposed to underlie the mechanism of these effects (6Stojanovic A. Stitham J. Hwa J. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W1998760501,"Along food chains, i.e., at different trophic levels, the most abundant taxa often represent exceptional food reservoirs, and are hence the main target of consumers and predators. The capacity of an individual consumer to opportunistically switch towards an abundant food source, for instance, a prey that suddenly becomes available in its environment, may offer such strong selective advantages that ecological innovations may appear and spread rapidly. New predator-prey relationships are likely to evolve even faster when a diet switch involves the exploitation of an unsaturated resource for which few or no other species compete. Using stable isotopes of carbon and nitrogen as dietary tracers, we provide here strong support to the controversial hypothesis that the giant noctule bat Nyctalus lasiopterus feeds on the wing upon the multitude of flying passerines during their nocturnal migratory journeys, a resource which, while showing a predictable distribution in space and time, is only seasonally available. So far, no predator had been reported to exploit this extraordinarily diverse and abundant food reservoir represented by nocturnally migrating passerines."
https://openalex.org/W2082441148,"Muscle creatine kinase (CK) is a crucial enzyme in energy metabolism, and it exists in two forms, the reduced form (R-CK) and the oxidized form (O-CK). In contrast with R-CK, O-CK contained an intrachain disulfide bond in each subunit. Here we explored the properties of O-CK and its regulatory role on muscle CK. The intrachain disulfide bond in O-CK was demonstrated to be formed between Cys74 and Cys146 by site-directed mutagenesis. Biophysical analysis indicated that O-CK showed decreased catalytic activity and that it might be structurally unstable. Further assays through guanidine hydrochloride denaturation and proteolysis by trypsin and protease K revealed that the tertiary structure of O-CK was more easily disturbed than that of R-CK. Surprisingly, O-CK, unlike R-CK, cannot interact with the M-line protein myomesin through biosensor assay, indicating that O-CK might have no role in muscle contraction. Through in vitro ubiquitination assay, CK was demonstrated to be a specific substrate of muscle ring finger protein 1 (MURF-1). O-CK can be rapidly ubiquitinated by MURF-1, while R-CK can hardly be ubiquitinated, implying that CK might be degraded by the ATP-ubiquitin-proteasome pathway through the generation of O-CK. The results above were further confirmed by molecular modeling of the structure of O-CK. Therefore, it can be concluded that the generation of O-CK was a negative regulation of R-CK and that O-CK might play essential roles in the molecular turnover of MM-CK."

Here, we tested both the deadbolt and the extension models. According to the deadbolt model, a hairpin loop in the β3 tail domain could act as a deadbolt to restrain the displacement of the β3 I domain β6-α7 loop and maintain integrin in the low affinity state. We found that mutating or deleting the β3 tail domain loop has no effect on ligand binding by either αIIbβ 3 or αVβ3 integrins. In contrast, we found that mutations that lock integrins in the bent conformation with disulfide bonds resist inside-out activation induced by cytoplasmic domain mutation. Furthermore, we demonstrated that extension is required for accessibility to fibronectin but not smaller fragments. The data demonstrate that integrin extension is required for ligand binding during integrin inside-out signaling and that the deadbolt does not regulate integrin activation.

Cell Biol. 2006; 18: 579-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). These long range conformational changes involve integrin extension. Conversely, ligand binding also induces integrin extension, which leads to the separation of the α- and β-subunit legs and the transmembrane and cytoplasmic regions (11Luo B.-H. Springer T.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2006; 18: 579-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Recent co-crystal structures of integrin αIIbβ3 headpiece bound to ligands revealed the molecular basis for the large conformational changes that accompany ligand binding (12Xiao T. Takagi J. Wang J.-h. Coller B.S. Springer T.A. Nature. 2004; 432: 59-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar). The conformational changes in the ligand binding site that increase affinity for ligand are allosterically linked by a crankshaft-like α7-helix displacement in the β3 I domain to a 60° change in the angle between the β3 I and hybrid domains and to a 70 Å increase in separation between the α- and β-subunits at their knees. Since the hybrid domain and connecting β-leg domains are central in the interface between the integrin headpiece and legs in the bent conformation, integrin extension enables hybrid domain swingout.

Two effects of extension are important for integrin activation. First, extension places the ligand binding site 150–200 Å further above the cell surface and orients it pointing away from, rather than toward, the surface of the cell on which it expressed. This favors accessibility to ligands on other cells and in the extracellular matrix. Second, extension enables hybrid domain swing-out and conversion of the headpiece from the closed, low affinity to the open high affinity state (11Luo B.-H. Springer T.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2006; 18: 579-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). There is controversy about the requirement of extension for integrin activation.

Xiong J.P. Maddock C. Goodman S.L. Arnaout M.A. Yeager M. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 168: 1109-1118Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). As a supplement or alternative to integrin extension, regulation of integrin affinity by a “deadbolt” has been proposed. This proposal is based on the observation of an interaction at a small 60 Å2 interface between the β-tail domain CD loop (the deadbolt) and the β-I domain β6 strand-α7 helix region in the unliganded αVβ3 crystal structure (22Xiong J.P. Stehle T. Goodman S.L. Arnaout M.A. Blood. 2003; 102: 1155-1159Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). It was hypothesized that 1) this interaction restricts the displacement of the β-I domain β6-α7 loop and thus keeps the integrin in the low affinity state and 2) that loss of this interaction would induce inside-out activation without extension. Here, we directly tested the deadbolt model by mutating or deleting the β-tail domain CD loop and show that these mutations have no effect on ligand binding by αIIbβ 3 or αVβ3 integrins. We further demonstrate that integrins locked in the bent conformation are resistant to inside-out activation and that extension is important to promote accessibility of cell surface integrins for soluble ligands.

Two groups of investigators independently tested the deadbolt model and have combined their data in this paper. One group produced and assayed ligand binding to CHO cell lines stably expressing either wild-type or mutant αIIbβ3 with five residues (Asp-672–Lys-676) deleted from the β-tail CD loop. The activation state of these integrins was evaluated by measuring the ability of CHO cell transfectants to bind macromolecular ligands. Wild-type and mutant αIIbβ3 were expressed similarly in CHO cells (Fig. 2A). Basal binding of fibrinogen and the ligand-mimetic, activation-dependent antibody PAC-1 (28Shattil S.J. Hoxie J.A.

In contrast, Mn2+ induced similar binding of fibrinogen and PAC-1 mAb to the wild-type and αIIbβ3_Δ672–676 CHO cell transfectants (Fig. 2B). These data show that deletion of the deadbolt does not constitutively activate αIIbβ3 integrin.FIGURE 2Effect of β-tail domain CD loop mutation on ligand binding by αIIbβ3 expressed on CHO cells.

These mutations had no effect on the expression of αIIbβ 3 or αVβ3 on the cell surface (data not shown). The activation state of these mutant integrins was evaluated by measuring soluble ligand binding to 293T cells transiently transfected with the mutant or wild type receptors (Fig. 3). None of the CD loop mutants showed constitutively high affinity for human fibrinogen, fibronectin, or the ligand mimetic antibody PAC-1 under physiological conditions (Fig. 3, A–C). Furthermore, CD loop mutants all were activated by Mn2+ and activating mAbs to the same level as wild-type integrins. In addition, CD loop mutations had no effect on the binding of fibronectin fragments Fn7–10 or Fn9–10 (Fig. 3D). As a positive control, the cytoplasmic GFFKR to GAAKR mutation (αV_GAAKR), which mimics inside out activation (7Luo B.-H. Springer T.A. Takagi J. PLoS Biol. 2004; 2: 776-786Google Scholar), constitutively activated binding of the fibronectin fragments (Fig. 3D). These data demonstrate that the β-tail domain CD loop does not restrain activation of either integrin αIIbβ 3 or αVβ3. Integrins Locked in the Bent Conformation Are Resistant to Inside-out Activation—Fluorescence resonance energy transfer and mutagenesis studies revealed that integrin inside-out activation requires unclasping or separation of the cytoplasmic and transmembrane domains (7Luo B.-H. Springer T.A. Takagi J. PLoS Biol. 2004; 2: 776-786Google Scholar, 8Kim M. Carman C.V. Springer T.A. Science. 2003; 301: 1720-1725Crossref PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar, 35Luo B.-H. Carman C.V.

Chem. 2005; 280: 7294-7300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). However, it has been questioned whether integrin extension is required for inside-out activation (37Arnaout M.A. Mahalingam B. Xiong J.P. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2005; 21: 381-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). Previously, we showed that introducing a disulfide bond between residues 307 of the αV β-propeller domain and 563 of the β3 I-EGF domain 4, with the αV G307C and β3 R563C mutations, locked the αVβ3 integrin in the low affinity, bent conformation (4Takagi J. Petre B.M. Walz T. Springer T.A. Cell. 2002; 110: 599-611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (907) Google Scholar). Residues αV-307 and β3–563 are in close proximity in the bent αVβ3 conformation (3Xiong J.-P. Stehle T. Diefenbach B. Zhang R. Dunker R. Scott D.L. Joachimiak A. Goodman S.L. Arnaout M.A. Science. 2001; 294: 339-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (1088) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). To test the requirement for integrin extension during inside-out activation, we combined the disulfide bond-forming αV G307C and β3 R563C mutations with the αV_GFFKR/GAAKR cytoplasmic domain mutation, which induces inside-out activation. The disulfide bond was formed in high efficiency in this αV_GAAKR_G307C/β3_R563 mutant (Fig. 4A). Consistent with previous results (7Luo B.-H. Springer T.A. Takagi J. PLoS Biol. 2004; 2: 776-786Google Scholar), the GAAKR mutant (αV_GAAKR/β3) bound anti-LIBS antibodies D3 and LIBS1 to the β3 leg (31Honda S. Tomiyama Y. Pelletier A.J. Annis D. Honda Y. Orchekowski R. Ruggeri Z. Kunicki T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11947-11954Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) constitutively, indicating that the integrin was extended (Fig. 4B). However, binding of LIBS antibodies by αV_GAAKR/β3 was reversed when the intersubunit disulfide bond was introduced in the αV_GAAKR_G307C/β3_R563C mutant (Fig. 4B). The high affinity (IC50 = 2.5 nm) (38Dechantsreiter M.A. Planker E. Matha B. Lohof E. Holzemann G. Jonczyk A. Goodman S.L. Kessler H. J. Med. Chem. 1999; 42: 3033-3040Crossref PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar) cyclo-RGDfV peptide induced LIBS binding by wild-type αVβ3 and further enhanced LIBS binding by αV_GAAKR/β3 (Fig. 4B). By contrast, the mutants αV_GAAKR_G307C/β3_R563C and αV_G307C/β3_R563C did not bind LIBS antibodies even in the presence of cyclo-RGDfV (Fig. 4B), showing that these mutants were locked in the bent conformation. Ligand binding assays showed that mutant integrin αV_GAAKR/β3 bound fibrinogen and fibronectin constitutively in Ca2+/Mg2+ (Fig. 4C). By contrast, the mutants αV_GAAKR_G307C/β3_R563C and αV_G307C/β3_R563C did not bind fibrinogen and fibronectin even in the presence of Mn2+ and activating mAb (Fig. 4C). These data demonstrate that integrins locked in the bent conformation are resistant to inside-out activation, i.e. integrin extension is required for inside-out activation as measured by both LIBS epitope exposure and soluble ligand binding. Ligand Accessibility Is Important for Integrin Ligand Binding—A negative stain EM study suggested that the soluble integrin αVβ3 in the bent conformation could bind a fragment of its ligand, fibronectin (21Adair B.D. Xiong J.P. Maddock C. Goodman S.L. Arnaout M.A. Yeager M. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 168: 1109-1118Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). These data lead to the suggestion that integrin extension may not be required for ligand binding. We designed experiments to investigate whether bent integrins are accessible to ligands on the cell surface. Introduction of a glycan wedge into the hybrid domain at its interface with the β-I domain by introducing an NIT305 sequon with the β3_N305T mutation has been shown to stabilize integrins in the high affinity state by favoring swing-out of the hybrid domain (Fig. 1) (23Luo B.-H. Springer T.A. Takagi J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 2403-2408Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). We combined the αV_G307C/β3_R563C mutations that form the intersubunit disulfide bond with the glycan wedge mutation. The disulfide bond was formed with high efficiency in this αV_G307C/β3_N305T_R563C mutant (Fig. 4A). For wild-type αVβ3 integrin, LIBS epitope exposure was partially induced by Mn2+ treatment and fully induced by cyclo-RG-DfV peptide or Fn7–10 in the presence of Mn2+ (Fig. 5A). The wedge mutant (αV/β3_N305T) bound LIBS antibodies constitutively, irrespective of the conditions used. By contrast, the αV_G307C/β3_N305T_R563C and αV_G307C/β3_R563C mutants did not bind LIBS antibodies even in the presence of cyclo-RGDfV peptides or Fn7–10 (Fig. 5A), showing that these mutant integrins were locked in the bent conformation. In contrast to wild-type αVβ3, the disulfide-bonded wedge mutant αV_G307C/β3_N305T_R563C did not bind full-length human fibronectin, even when activated (Fig. 5B). Distinctive results were obtained with small fibronectin fragments. The disulfide-bonded wedge mutant αV_G307C/β3_N305T_R563C bound the Fn7–10 and Fn9–10 fragments constitutively (Fig. 5, C and D). However, the amount of binding was lesser than that for the other mutants and wild-type αVβ3 (Fig. 5, C and D). Consistent with previous results, the disulfide-bonded mutant αV_G307C/β3_R563C did not bind fibronectin, Fn7–10, and Fn9–10, even in activating conditions. As controls, the wedge mutant (αV/β3_N305T) or the wedge mutation combined with single cysteine mutations (αV_G307C/β3_N305T and αV/β3_N305T_R563C) bound fibronectin and the Fn7–10 or Fn9–10 fragments constitutively (Fig. 5, B–D). These data demonstrate that even when activated, integrins in the bent conformation are not accessible to large soluble ligands, although they are accessible to small soluble ligand fragments. Fn Fragments Induce Extension of Cell Surface αVβ3—As mentioned above, a negative stain EM study reported that soluble αVβ3 remained in the bent conformation when exposed to 1 mg/ml Fn fragment in 0.2 mm Ca2+/0.2 mm Mn2+ (21Adair B.D. Xiong J.P. Maddock C. Goodman S.L. Arnaout M.A. Yeager M. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 168: 1109-1118Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Notably, under the same conditions, we found that Fn 7–10 efficiently induced extension of cell surface αVβ3, as reported both by the LIBS1 and D3 antibodies (Fig. 5A). In the αVβ3 structure (3Xiong J.-P. Stehle T. Diefenbach B. Zhang R. Dunker R. Scott D.L. Joachimiak A. Goodman S.L. Arnaout M.A. Science. 2001; 294: 339-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (1088) Google Scholar), residue Ser-674 at the tip of the CD loop of the β-tail domain contacts the β-I domain. The buried surface area is quite small at 60 Å2. According to the deadbolt model, the residues at the tip of the CD loop, by contacting the β6-strand near the β6-α7 loop of the β-I domain, restrain the integrin in the resting, low affinity state (22Xiong J.P. Stehle T. Goodman S.L. Arnaout M.A. Blood. 2003; 102: 1155-1159Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 37Arnaout M.A. Mahalingam B. Xiong J.P. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2005; 21: 381-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). Activating mutations in the β6-α7 loop of the β2 I domain (39Ehirchiou D. Xiong Y.M. Li Y. Brew S. Zhang L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 8324-8331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) have been interpreted as supporting the deadbolt model (37Arnaout M.A. Mahalingam B. Xiong J.P. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2005; 21: 381-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). However, rearrangement of this region is directly coupled to rearrangement of the ligand binding site and thus to the affinity change (12Xiao T. Takagi J. Wang J.-h. Coller B.S. Springer T.A. Nature. 2004; 432: 59-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar). Introduction of disulfide bonds (40Luo B.-H. Takagi J. Springer T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 10215-10221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) or other mutations (41Hato T. Yamanouchi J. Yakushijin Y. Sakai I. Yasukawa M. J. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2006; 4: 2278-2280Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 42Barton S.J. Travis M.A. Askari J.A. Buckley P.A. Craig S.E. Humphries M.J. Mould A.P. Biochem. J. 2004; 380: 401-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) into the β6-α7 loop and α7-helix induced high affinity by causing the rearrangement of the ligand binding site of the β-I domain, and there is no evidence that these mutations disrupt interaction with the β-tail domain CD loop. Therefore, mutation of the β-tail domain CD loop is required to test the deadbolt model. This model was independently tested using different mutations and cell lines in two different laboratories, with similar results. We found that mutations to Ala of three residues in this loop, or deletions of residues 672–674 or 672–676, did not activate ligand binding by integrins αVβ3 or αIIbβ3 and had no effect on the ability of these integrins to be activated by Mn2+ or antibodies. If local rearrangement of the β3 tail domain were sufficient for integrin affinity regulation, as proposed in the deadbolt model, we should at least detect the binding of small fibronectin fragments to CD loop mutants. However, we found that the CD loop mutations had no effect on the binding of the Fn7–10 and Fn9–10 fragments. Therefore, we conclude that the β-tail domain CD loop does not regulate ligand binding and does not act as a deadbolt. Recently, it was reported that exchanging D658GMD in the β-tail domain CD loop of the β2 subunit with D672SSG of the β3 subunit or with N658GTD, which introduces a glycan wedge sequence, activated the αMβ2 integrin (43Gupta V. Gylling A. Alonso J.L. Sugimori T. Ianakiev P. Xiong J.P. Arnaout M.A. Blood. 2006; (in press)Google Scholar). A crystal structure of αMβ2 is not available. Whether the β-tail domain CD loop of αMβ2 contacts the β-I domain is unknown, and the overall orientation of the β-tail domain relative to the β-I domain in β2 integrins is unknown, making the structural consequences of mutations in the CD loop difficult to predict. However, it is known that multiple substitutions in the β2 subunit, including those in I-EGF domain 3, are activating, consistent with disruption of interactions in the bent conformation (15Beglova N. Blacklow S.C. Takagi J. Springer T.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 282-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 44Zang Q. Lu C. Huang C. Takagi J. Springer T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22202-22212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Integrin activation is observed after many types of mutations. We believe that our finding of a lack of effect of deletion or mutation of the β-tail domain CD loop, in the context of the structurally characterized αVβ3 integrin, which served as the basis for the deadbolt proposal, is the more telling test of this model. Our data further demonstrate that transition from the bent to extended conformation (i.e. integrin extension) is not only required for integrin affinity regulation but also required for accessibility to biological ligands. Integrin αVβ3 with the αV_GFFKR/GAAKR cytoplasmic mutation, which induces inside-out activation, bound ligands with high affinity in nonactivating conditions and was in the extended conformation, as shown by constitutive LIBS epitope exposure. However, this constitutive LIBS exposure and ligand binding activity was reversed when a disulfide bond was introduced between the αV β-propeller domain and the β3 I-EGF 4 domain, which locked the integrin in the bent conformation. It has been demonstrated that activating mutations in the transmembrane and cytoplasmic regions of αIIbβ3 induce constitutive LIBS epitope exposure (7Luo B.-H. Springer T.A. Takagi J. PLoS Biol. 2004; 2: 776-786Google Scholar, 35Luo B.-H. Carman C.V. Takagi J. Springer T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 3679-3684Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), showing that integrin extension can occur in the absence of ligand binding. These results are consistent with a wide body of evidence that suggests that integrin affinity regulation is concomitant with extension during inside-out activation (11Luo B.-H. Springer T.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2006; 18: 579-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Integrin αVβ3 with a disulfide bond between the αV β-propeller domain and the β3 I-EGF 4 domain and activated with a hybrid domain glycan wedge appeared to remain in the bent conformation as intended because the LIBS1 and D3 epitopes were not exposed. Although the glycan wedge mutant activated binding to soluble fibronectin, this binding was completely reversed by the introduced disulfide bond. However, the double mutant with the glycan wedge and the disulfide to restrain the bent conformation bound Fn7–10 and Fn9–10 fragments, although binding was lower than in the absence of the disulfide. These results demonstrate that the introduced disulfide did not prevent activation and that integrin extension is required for access to the large macromolecular ligands to which integrins bind physiologically. In addition, we demonstrate that Mn2+ and binding of Fn7–10 induce LIBS epitope exposure in integrin αVβ3, suggesting that these agents induced αVβ3 integrin extension on the cell surface. Notably, we used the same Mn2+ concentration (0.2 mm) and fibronectin fragment concentration (1 mg/ml) as used in a recent EM study that suggested that after binding of these agents, αVβ3 remained in a bent conformation (21Adair B.D. Xiong J.P. Maddock C. Goodman S.L. Arnaout M.A. Yeager M. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 168: 1109-1118Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). However, aggregation was present in the EM preparations, which may have resulted in the absence of sampling of extended integrins (11Luo B.-H. Springer T.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2006; 18: 579-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 21Adair B.D. Xiong J.P. Maddock C. Goodman S.L. Arnaout M.A. Yeager M. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 168: 1109-1118Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Our results on cell surface αVβ3 are consistent with other EM studies on soluble αVβ3 bound to cyclo-RGDfV peptide (4Takagi J. Petre B.M. Walz T. Springer T.A. Cell. 2002; 110: 599-611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (907) Google Scholar), soluble αIIbβ3 bound to RGD peptide (13Iwasaki K. Mitsuoka K. Fujiyoshi Y. Fujisawa Y. Kikuchi M. Sekiguchi K. Yamada T. J. Struct. Biol. 2005; 150: 259-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), and α5β1 headpiece fragments bound to Fn7–10 (14Takagi J. Strokovich K. Springer T.A. Walz T. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 4607-4615Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar), which showed that integrins were extended and/or had the open head-piece conformation with the hybrid domain swung out after ligand binding. In conclusion, our results fail to show any role for a deadbolt in the integrin in which this model was proposed, αVβ3, or in integrin αIIbβ3, suggest that integrins extend on the cell surface under conditions in which extension was not found in one EM study, and show that integrin extension is important for both affinity regulation and ligand accessibility."

In addition, a systematic comparative analysis of our cDNA database of amphioxus identified a large number of genes whose vertebrate counterparts are involved in lymphocyte function. Among these genes, several genes were found to be expressed in the vicinity of the lymphocyte-like cells by in situ hybridization and up-regulated after exposure to microbial pathogens.

UDP-glucose, the activated form of glucose, plays an essential role in the metabolism of carbohydrates in all organisms. UDP-glucose is the main glucosyl donor for the formation of glycogen, starch, and cellulose, as well as for the synthesis of glucose-containing glycolipids, glycoproteins, and proteoglycans (1Flores-Diaz M. Alape-Giron A. Persson B. Pollesello P. Moos M. von Eichel-Streiber C. Thelestam M. Florin I. J. Biol.

In addition, other important nucleotide sugars such as UDP-xylose, UDP-glucuronic acid, and UDP-galactose are derived from UDP-glucose. In bacteria some of these activated sugars are used to build the bacterial polysaccharide capsule that often represents the sole determinant of virulence of these organisms. In Streptococcus pneumoniae, for example, it was known that mutants containing an inactivated UGPase gene (galU) are completely avirulent, as they are unable to form the polysaccharide capsule (3Bonofiglio L. Garcia E. Mollerach M. Curr. Microbiol. 2005; 51: 217-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Similarly, UGPase is involved in the biosynthesis of the lipopolysaccharide core in Escherichia coli, resulting in a reduced adhesion behavior of E. coli galU mutants (4Genevaux P. Bauda P. DuBow M.S. Oudega B. Arch. Microbiol. 1999; 172: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The protozoan parasite Leishmania is the causative agent of a widespread group of diseases collectively known as Leishmaniasis. The disease affects more than 12 million people world-wide and until now there is no specific drug available to cure the disease. 3World Health Organization (special program for research and training in tropical diseases). 3World Health Organization (special program for research and training in tropical diseases). Leishmania express various glycoconjugates on their cell surface that is dynamically modified during the parasite life cycle allowing the survival and proliferation in the sand fly vector as well as in the mammalian host (6Naderer T. Vince J.E. McConville M.J. Curr. Mol. Med. 2004; 4: 649-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 7Sacks D.L. Modi G. Rowton E. Spath G. Epstein L. Turco S.J. Beverley S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 406-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). The biosynthesis of glycoconjugates essentially depends on the availability of activated nucleotide sugars. UGPase represents a key position in the activation of glucose and galactose, which are major components of Leishmania glycoconjugates. Formation of UDP-glucose is a prerequisite for the synthesis of UDP-galactose, which is achieved either by nucleotide transfer from UDP-glucose onto galactose 1-phosphate or by epimerization of UDP-glucose to UDP-galactose. As galactose-containing glycoconjugates are important virulence factors in Leishmania major, its UGPase has been intensively characterized. Like other pyrophosphorylases the L. major UGPase requires a divalent metal ion, Mg2+, and acts reversibly in vitro. The enzymatic reaction follows an ordered bi-bi reaction mechanism with sequential binding of UTP preceding glucose 1-phosphate. Interestingly, UDP and UMP are not recognized by the enzyme and do not facilitate the binding site for glucose 1-phosphate (8Lamerz A.-C. Haselhorst T. Bergfeld A.K. von Itzstein M. Gerardy-Schahn R. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 16314-16322Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Thus, the γ-phosphate group of UTP is essential for both binding of the nucleotide and inducing of the presumed change in conformation, which then allows the glucose 1-phosphate to the active site. Several mutagenesis studies and a modeling approach in eukaryotic UGPases have been performed, which identified specific residues important for catalytic activity (9Katsube T. Kazuta Y. Tanizawa K. Fukui T. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 8546-8551Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 10Chang H.Y. Peng H.L. Chao Y.C. Duggleby R.G. Eur. J.

Wilczynska M. Karpinski S. Kleczkowski L.A. Plant Mol. Biol. 2004; 56: 783-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). However, these investigations alone were not enough to resolve the catalytic mechanism. The knowledge of the three-dimensional structure is, therefore, of utmost importance. In this study we succeeded in solving the three-dimensional structure of the L. major UGPase apoprotein and of the complex of UGPase with the product UDP-glucose. Comparison of the two structures revealed an induction from an open to a closed conformation when the product is bound accompanied by major domain motions. In combination with mutagenesis data, our results provide first insight into the mechanism of UDP-glucose formation and establish the structural basis for the rational design of inhibitors that specifically affect the L. major enzyme. Protein Expression and Purification—The gene encoding UGPase from L. major was subcloned into the His tag expression vector pET-22b (Novagen). The recombinant plasmid pET-UGP-His was transformed into E. coli expression strain BL21(DE3), overexpressed, and purified by Ni2+ chelating chromatography as described previously (8Lamerz A.-C. Haselhorst T. Bergfeld A.K. von Itzstein M. Gerardy-Schahn R. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 16314-16322Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). As a last additional purification step the buffer of the purified protein was changed by using a HiTrap desalting column (Amersham Biosciences) to buffer A (1 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm MgCl2, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl). Finally, the protein was concentrated to 20 mg/ml. Selenomethionine-labeled protein was produced in the methionine-auxothrophic E. coli strain B834(DE3) and grown in minimal medium without methionine supplemented with selenomethionine (0.3 mm). After induction with 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside the cells were grown at 15 °C for 18 h. The purification procedure was identical to that of the native protein. Incorporation of selenomethionine was confirmed by determination of the molecular mass using ESI-MS. Site-directed Mutagenesis—Plasmids for the expression of mutant UGPase were generated by site-directed mutagenesis of pET-UGP-His using the QuikChange Site-directed Mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The following mutagenic primers were used: 5′-GGGCTGTGCGACGCCGCGACGCTGCTCGAGGTC-3′ (K95A); 5′-GGGCGCCGCCGGGGAACGGTGACATCTAC-3′ (H191N); 5′-GGGCGCCGCCGGGGCTCGGTGACATCTAC-3′ (H191L); 5′-GAGAAGAGGGTGCTGGATCTGCGGGAGTCCGCC-3′ (L281D); and 5′-CTTCGCGCCAGTGGCGACGTGCGCCGATC-3′ (K380A). Integrity of the constructs was confirmed by sequencing. The mutants were expressed and purified as described above. In Vitro Activity Measurement—The in vitro activity of mutant and wild type UGPase was measured in the forward reaction by a coupled enzymatic assay as described previously (8Lamerz A.-C. Haselhorst T. Bergfeld A.K. von Itzstein M. Gerardy-Schahn R. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 16314-16322Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Briefly, the assay was performed at 25 °C in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm UTP (Roche), 1 mm glucose 1-phosphate (Sigma), 1 mm NAD+ (Roche Applied Science), and 0.05 units of UDP-glucose dehydrogenase (Calbiochem). The reaction was started by the addition of wild type or mutant UGPase. The reduction of the cofactor NAD+ to NADH + H+ was monitored at 340 nm and the initial linear rates were used to calculate the enzymatic activity. Crystallization and Data Collection—Crystals were grown at 18 °C using the sitting drop vapor diffusion method. As the crystallization of selenomethionine-labeled protein yielded better diffracting crystals, the labeled protein was used for all trials. Crystals of the apoprotein were grown from 21% PEG 3350, 100 mm BisTris, pH 7.0, 200 mm Li2SO4. Crystals of UGPase in complex with UDP-glucose were obtained from 27% PEG monomethyl ether 2000, 100 mm BisTris, pH 6.5. For co-crystallization UDP-glucose (5 mm) was used in excess. All crystals belong to space group C2221 and contain one molecule per asymmetric unit. Diffraction data of the apoprotein as well as the multiwavelength anomalous dispersion data sets of the complex were collected at beamline BW6 at the German Electron Synchrotron (Hamburg, Germany). Data sets were integrated, scaled, and merged by using DENZO and SCALEPACK (13Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38436) Google Scholar).

D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19728) Google Scholar). The positions of 16 selenomethionine atoms present in the asymmetric unit of the complexed form were determined using the program SHELXD (15Sheldrick G.M. Schneider T.R. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 319-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (1877) Google Scholar). Data were phased and refined to a resolution of 2.3 Å with MLPHARE. Initial phases were improved by solvent flattening with the program DM from the CCP4 package (Table 1). The resulting electron density map was used in an automated structure refinement approach. ARP/wARP including the warpNtrace protocol (16Perrakis A. Morris R. Lamzin V.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 458-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (2563) Google Scholar) were used to obtain a first glycine trace of the protein structure. Starting from this initial model the complete catalytic domain and most of the N-terminal domain of the model could be built. The model was refined in CNS (17Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol.

A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13006) Google Scholar). The loop region between the catalytic domain and the C-terminal domain was not well defined in the electron density of the ligand bound structure, whereas this part was traceable in the apo structure. The apo structure was solved by molecular replacement using the likelihood-based molecular replacement program PHASER-1.2 (19McCoy A.J. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Storoni L.C. Read R.J. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2005; 61: 458-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (1596) Google Scholar). The coordinates of 482 residues could be refined using the excellent difference electron density map, except for the first six and the last six residues. The loop containing residues 267 to 274 and residues 467 to 469 showed weak density. It was not possible to detect any electron density in the two structures, which could be assigned to Mg2+. However, in the apo structure two peaks of electron density are located at the active site and at the protein surface, which apparently are sulfate ions (SO2-4) from the screening buffer. The refinement was done with CNS and the model rebuilding was performed in O. The well defined C-terminal domain of the apo structure was used to solve the missing C-terminal domain of the ligand structure by molecular replacement. The final model of the ligand structure contained all residues beside the first and the last six residues of the full-length protein. The ligand UDP-glucose was built into the model with the automated ligand building module from ARP/wARP version 6.1. Averaged Sigma-A-weighted and composite omit (2Fo - Fc) maps were used for model building of the ligand in O. Water molecules were added and refined by CNS. The statistical data of the refinement are presented in Table 2, including the Protein Data Bank accession codes.TABLE 2Refinement statisticsData setsUDP-glucoseApoProtein atoms in the asymmetric unit37223722Solvent content (%)41.446.0Solvent atoms22575SC42− ions2LigandUDP-glucoseResolution (Å)20-2.320-2.4RcrysaRcrys = ∑|Fobs - Fcalc|/∑Fobs.0.21 (0.25)0.21 (0.30)RfreebRfree was determined from 5% of the data (10% of the apo dataset) that were omitted from the refinement.0.25 (0.31)0.26 (0.35)R.m.s.deviation bond lengths (Å)0.0080.006R.m.s.deviation bond angles (°)1.51.3Protein B-factor (Å2)28.048.7Ligand B-factor (Å2)17.0Ramachandran φ/ψ distribution (%)cRamachandran plot distribution refers to the most favored/additional/generously/disallowed regions as defined by Procheck (5).90.2/9.1/0/0.787.2/11.8/0.7/0.2PDB entry2OEG2OEFa Rcrys = ∑|Fobs - Fcalc|/∑Fobs.b Rfree was determined from 5% of the data (10% of the apo dataset) that were omitted from the refinement.c Ramachandran plot distribution refers to the most favored/additional/generously/disallowed regions as defined by Procheck (5Laskowski R.A.

Open table in a new tab Searches for related sequences were performed with BLAST, searches for related structures were done with DALI. Sequence and structural alignments were done with GCG (Wisconsin Package version 10.3, Accelrys, San Diego, CA) and TOP3D (20Lu G. Protein Data Bank Quarterly Newsletter. 1996; 78: 10-11Google Scholar), respectively. Calculation of the tilt angles of the domain motion was done with DynDom. Figures were generated with PYMOL, MOLSCRIPT (21Kraulis P.J. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1991; 24: 946-950Crossref Google Scholar), RASTER3D (22Merritt E.A. Bacon D.J.

The 2.3-Å resolution structure of the 54.5-kDa full-length L. major UGPase complexed with UDP-glucose (closed conformation) was solved by multiwavelength anomalous dispersion using selenomethionine-substituted protein. Except for a small part of the N and C terminus the whole model (S7-P488) could be built with two surface loops (Lys267-Asp274 and Asn466-Ser471) associated with weak electron density. The model has overall good stereochemistry with 99% of the residues in the preferred Φ/ψ conformation and final R values of Rcrys = 0.21 and Rfree = 0.25. Also, the substrate-free apoprotein (open conformation) crystallized in the space group C2221 but with a different unit cell and its structure was solved by molecular replacement. The model of the apoprotein was refined to 2.4 Å with final R values of Rcrys = 0.21 and Rfree = 0.26. In the apo model 87% of the residues displayed a main chain conformation in the most favored regions and 12% in the additional allowed regions as defined by the Ramachandran plot. All residues with unusual main chain conformation were either very well defined in the electron density map or occupied flexible regions of the model. A summary of the data collection is presented in Table 1 and the refinement statistics are summarized in Table 2. Overall Structure—UGPase contains an N-terminal domain, a central catalytic domain, and a C-terminal domain (Fig. 1, A and B). The catalytic domain harbors the nucleotide sugar binding site and resembles the Rossmann-fold seen in many nucleotide-binding proteins. It consists of a central highly bent, twisted and mixed sheet composed of seven β-strands arranged in the order 4-3-1-7-11-8-14 that are parallel aligned except β11. This central sheet is topped at one end by a small two-stranded anti-parallel β-sheet (β2a-β2b) and flanked at the opposite side by a long two-stranded anti-parallel β-sheet (β9-β10), which points to a protruding extension. The central sheet is additionally surrounded by 11 α-helices and seven 310 helices. The side of the central sheet that faces the N-terminal domain is partially covered by the α-helix α8. In contrast, the top side of the central sheet is solvent accessible and faces the nucleotide sugar moiety. Furthermore, a sequence insertion in the Leishmania enzyme forms the long loop (residues Arg261-Leu280) protruding from the catalytic domain, which has the appearance of a handle (Fig. 1B). The N-terminal domain is discontinuously formed by residues Ser7-Thr44 encompassing the two N-terminal α-helices α1 and α2, and two further building blocks (residues Asn163-Pro188 and Pro331-Ala355) that protrude from the catalytic domain (Fig. 1B). These segments contain a four-stranded anti-parallel β-sheet (β5a, β6, β12, and β13), flanked on one side by α1 and α2 and on the other side by the short β-strand β5b and a310 helix. The C-terminal domain is connected to the catalytic domain via a long loop that encompasses two anti-parallel β-strands (β15 and β16) and a 310 helix. The domain comprises residues Asp391-Pro488 that are arranged in a left-handed parallel β-helix (LβH) composed of three complete rungs. The first rung contains a large loop and is atypically composed of a shortened β-strand, two subsequent α-helices, and another β-strand. The second and the third rung are formed by three canonical short β-strands. The LβH is assembled by tandem repeats of imperfect hexa-peptides, which harbor strongly conserved hydrophobic residues at the so-called i-positions (Fig. 1B) pointing toward the interior of the LβH. Generally, small residues occupy the corner positions at the sharp turns. Active Site—The refined structure of L. major UGPase in complex with UDP-glucose, the product of the enzymatic reaction, defines the location of the active site of the enzyme (Fig. 2A). Fig. 2B shows the well defined electron density corresponding to UDP-glucose. The UDP-glucose is bound in a deep groove located at the center of the catalytic domain that consists of highly conserved residues. The nucleotide moiety is fixed by a mixture of hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions established by residues of the conserved NB loop (nucleotide binding loop (Fig. 1B)). The NB loop (residues Lys80-Lys95), which constitutes a roof above the nucleotide on the active site, contains the glycine-rich consensus sequence motif KLNGGLGTXMG(X)4K. The basic residues His191 and Lys380 interact with the negatively charged phosphate groups of UDP-glucose (Fig. 3A). The glucose moiety of the product is bound to a depression that is adjacent to the nucleotide. The hydroxyl groups of the sugar are fixed by numerous hydrogen bonds (Fig. 3A). These observations are in good agreement with data obtained from saturation transfer difference-NMR, indicating that all protons of the sugar moiety are in intimate contact with the protein (8Lamerz A.-C. Haselhorst T. Bergfeld A.K. von Itzstein M. Gerardy-Schahn R. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 16314-16322Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). At the end of the cleft Phe305 contacts the sugar moiety in the closed conformation, thereby limiting the space available for sugar binding. The SB loop (substrate binding loop, residues Thr250-Gly257) covers the sugar within the binding site and contains the two highly conserved glycines, Gly256 and Gly257, that rearrange during the catalytic reaction (see below).FIGURE 3A, close up view of the active site.

When the nucleotide moiety of UTP is superimposed with the uridyl group of UDP-glucose, the β- and γ-phosphate groups of UTP can be positioned into a small cavity above the nucleotide binding site that is lined by Lys380 and Lys95 (Fig. 3B) leading to a conformation of UTP similar to that of dTTP in the structurally related glucose-1-phosphate thymidylyltransferase (RmlA/RffH) (24Blankenfeldt W. Asuncion M. Lam J.S. Naismith J.H. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6652-6663Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 25Sivaraman J. Sauve V. Matte A. Cygler M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44214-44219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Based on our structural data we mutated several substrate binding residues in the active site of UGPase to further study the importance of these residues for catalysis. Lys380 forms a hydrogen bond to the α-phosphate group of UDP-glucose. Most probably, both residues Lys380 and Lys95 bind to the phosphate groups of the substrate UTP. Therefore, no catalytic activity for the K380A mutant was observed, in contrast to a residual activity of 0.5% for the K95A mutant (Table 3). Residue His191 binds and stabilizes the β-phosphate group of UDP-glucose and probably also the phosphate group of the substrate glucose 1-phosphate. When His191 is substituted by the apolar leucine, a residue of similar size, the enzyme is inactive because the hydrogen bond between histidine and the β-phosphate is abolished. In the H191N mutant asparagine may still be able to form a hydrogen bond to the substrate, which is in agreement with the observed reduced activity of 0.3% of the H191N mutant and the natural occurrence of asparagine at position 223 in the human UDP-N-acetylglucosamine PPase (AGX) (26Peneff C.

Open table in a new tab Comparison of Open and Closed Forms—Upon product binding and presumably also upon substrate binding UGPase undergoes a large conformational change that involves a rearrangement of the C-terminal domain toward the active site and in functional loops of the catalytic domain. Superposition of the catalytic domain in the open and closed conformation results in a r.m.s. deviation of 3.4 Å in the 301 position of Cα-atoms. In comparison the N- and C-terminal domains can be superimposed with r.m.s. deviation values of 0.3 and 0.7 Å, respectively. The latter domain of the open form is tilted toward the catalytic domain about 17° in the closed conformation (Figs. 2A and 4). The superposition of both structures in the open and the closed conformations reveal a significant relocation of the NB loop toward the ligand (Fig. 2A). On the opposite edge of the active site the SB loop with the conserved glycines, Gly256 and Gly257, moves over the sugar moiety of the product and the side chain of Phe305 rearranges to tighten up the active site (Figs. 2A, 3A, and 4). The handle-like extension formed by β-strands, β9 and β10, and the connecting loop adopts very different conformations in the apo and the UDP-glucose-complexed UGPase structures. Currently, the role of the handle movement is not clear. However, residues Gly256 and Gly257 at the beginning and Glu284 at the end of the handle, as well as the adjacent residues Val246 to Ala260 and Leu281 to Ser303 perform a 12° turn toward the sugar moiety in the UDP-glucose UGPase complex compared with the apo structure (Figs. 2A and 4). This fact justifies the assumption that the large movement of the handle is at least partially induced by ligand binding. UGPases of eukaryotic origin are about 500 residues long and show 40% similarity in protein sequence (Fig. 1B). Prokaryotic UGPases in general are shorter and their sequences align with a very limited degree of conservation. Nevertheless, both human as well as yeast UGPase are able to complement UGPase (GalU)-deficient E. coli mutants (27Peng H.L. Chang H.Y.

https://openalex.org/W2015214795,"Parkin-associated endothelin receptor-like receptor (Pael-R) is a substrate of the E3 ubiquitin ligase Parkin, which has been implicated in the pathogenesis of Parkinson disease. Misexpression of human Pael-R in Drosophila has been shown to induce selective loss of dopaminergic neurons, a symptom of Parkinson disease. Using this model, we investigated whether thioredoxin (TRX), an evolutionarily conserved antioxidant and molecular chaperone, could suppress the neurotoxicity induced by Pael-R. The Drosophila genome contains three TRX-encoding genes, namely TrxT, Trx-2, and dhd. When each of the TRX genes was overexpressed together with Pael-R in all neurons, the number of dopaminergic neurons and level of locomotor activity were significantly increased compared with control flies. To assess the role of the antioxidant activity of TRX in this context, we generated redox-defective mutants, TrxT(C35A) and TrxT(D26A/K57I), and coexpressed each of them with Pael-R. The mutants suppressed the Pael-R neurotoxicity similarly to wild-type TrxT, although the extent of the rescue was slightly reduced for the locomotor activity. We confirmed that both mutants remained active as chaperones, suggesting that this activity may be the major cause of the suppression. In the absence of Pael-R, overexpression of TRX in all neurons increased the level of locomotor activity in aged flies and extended the mean longevity by 15%. Furthermore, overexpression of TRX suppressed neurotoxicity in a Drosophila model of Machado-Joseph disease expressing polyglutamine. These results establish that Drosophila TRX can function as an anti-aging agent and as a suppressor of Pael-R- and poly-glutamine-induced neurotoxicity.

Parkin is also associated with Hsp70 and carboxyl terminus of Hsc70-interacting protein (CHIP; a chaperone-dependent E3 ligase), which together control the ubiquitination and degradation of an insoluble form of Pael-R (11Imai Y. Soda M. Hatakeyama S. Akagi T. Hashikawa T. Nakayama K.I. Takahashi R. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 55-67Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). Pael-R has been shown to exhibit neurotoxicity in Drosophila, because misexpression of human Pael-R caused selective loss of DA neurons with aging and this phenotype was suppressed by overexpression of human Parkin (hPk) (12Yang Y. Nishimura I. Imai Y. Takahashi R. Lu B. Neuron. 2003; 37: 911-924Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Recently, CHIP was found to be a component of Lewy bodies in the human brain, where it colocalizes with α-synuclein and Hsp70 (13Shin Y. Klucken J. Patterson C. Hyman B.T. McLean P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 23727-23734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). In a cell culture model, overexpression of CHIP inhibited the formation of α-synuclein inclusion bodies and reduced the α-synuclein protein level. These observations support the hypothesis that the Parkin-linked ubiquitin-proteasome pathway plays a central role in the pathogenesis of PD, perhaps also including late-onset cases. Thioredoxin (TRX), a dithiol-reducing enzyme, is induced by a variety of oxidative stimuli, including UV irradiation, inflammatory cytokines, and chemical carcinogens and plays crucial roles in the regulation of cellular responses such as gene expression, cell proliferation, and apoptosis (14Nishinaka Y. Masutani H. Nakamura H. Yodoi J. Redox. Rep. 2001; 6: 289-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The sequence containing the redox active site, Cys-Gly-Pro-Cys-Lys, is conserved among all TRX family proteins (15Holmgren A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 237-271Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A wide variety of cellular functions of TRX have been reported in various cells and organisms, including a cytoprotective effect against oxidative stress (16Nakamura H. Matsuda M. Furuke K.

Commun. 1993; 192: 760-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). TRX has also been shown to regulate the stability of apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 through ubiquitination-proteasomal degradation (20Liu Y. Min W. Circ. Res. 2002; 28: 1259-1266Crossref Scopus (313) Google Scholar) and to interact with unfolded and denatured proteins as a molecular chaperone (21Kern R. Malki A. Holmgren A. Richarme G. Biochem. J. 2003; 371: 965-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). These functional properties of TRX suggest that it may serve as an efficient inhibitor of PD symptoms. In the present study, we used a Drosophila model to examine whether TRX could suppress the neurotoxicity induced by Pael-R. The Drosophila genome contains three genes encoding TRX-like proteins, namely Dhd (22Salz H.K. Flickinger T.W. Mittendorf E. Pellicena-Palle A. Petschek J.P. Albrecht E.B. Genetics. 1994; 136: 1075-1086Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), Trx-2 (23Bauer H. Kanzok S.M. Schirmer R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 17457-17463Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), and thioredoxin T (TrxT) (24Svensson M.J. Chen J.D. Pirrotta V. Larsson J. Chromosoma. 2003; 112: 133-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), all of which contain the conserved redox active site. We found that overexpression of each of the Drosophila TRXs could suppress the Pael-R-induced phenotypes, such as the selective loss of DA neurons and reduced locomotor activity, as efficiently as human Parkin. Because the redox-defective TRX mutants were also able to suppress the Pael-R-induced phenotypes, the antioxidant activity is unlikely to be responsible for the suppression. The neuroprotective function of TRX was also observed in a Drosophila model of Machado-Joseph disease (MJD) expressing polyglutamine (25Warrick J.M. Paulson H.L. Gray-Board G.L. Bui Q.T. Fischbeck K.H. Pittman R.N. Bonini N.M. Cell. 1998; 93: 939-949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we demonstrated that overexpression of TRX in the absence of Pael-R improved locomotor activity in aged animals and extended adult longevity. Plasmid Construction and Molecular Biology—Poly(A) RNA was isolated from third instar larvae using a Fast RNA kit (Bio101, Vista, CA) and a Quick Prep Micro mRNA purification kit (Amersham Biosciences) and then reverse-transcribed using a Ready-To-Go T-Primed First-Strand kit (Amersham Biosciences).

Chem. 2002; 277: 17457-17463Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) cDNAs were amplified by PCR using a KOD-PLUS DNA polymerase kit (Toyobo, Osaka, Japan) with the following EcoRI site-flanked upstream primers and XhoI site-flanked downstream primers: TrxT, F1 (5′-ACTCATATGGTGTACCCAGTGCGGAA-3′) and R1 (5′-TGCCTCGAGCTAGTGCTCCAGAACGGCA-3′); dhd, F2(5′-CTAGAATTCATGGCATCCGTACGCACCAT-3′) and R2 (5′-TACCTCGAGTTACGCCTTCACCAGCTTGG-3′); Trx-2, F3(5′-ACTGAATCATGGCTGCCATGCAGAAGAA-3′) and R3 (5′-TGCCTCGAGTTAGGTTCCAATTTCGGCA-3′). The obtained PCR products were digested with EcoRI and XhoI (Toyobo), and the resulting cDNA fragments were subcloned into the EcoRI/XhoI sites of pBluescript SK+ (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and sequenced with a BigDye Terminator Cycle Sequencing FS Ready Reaction kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). A redox-defective mutant, TrxT(C35A), was generated by PCR mutagenesis using the TrxT cDNA as a template and primers M1 (5′-TGCGGACCTGCCAAGATAATAGCACCC-3′) and M2 (5′-CCAGTCTGCATAAAAATCAATTACCAC-3′). Another redox-defective mutant, TrxT(D26A/K57I), was generated by PCR mutagenesis using the TrxT cDNA as a template with primers M3 (5′-AAGCTGGTGGTAATTGCTTTTTATGCA-3′) and M4 (5′-GTCCTCGGCGAGGATTAGCTGCTGGTC-3′) for the D26A mutation and M5 (5′-GTCCACGTTCACGATGAGTACGACGAC-3′) and M6 (5′-GAGAACGAGGACATTACGGTCGAATAC-3′) for the K57I mutation. The wild-type and mutant TrxT cDNAs were subcloned into pGEX-4T-1 to create GST fusion proteins and pUAST (26Brand A.H. Perrimon N. Development. 1993; 118: 401-415Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to produce transgenic flies expressing TrxT under GAL4 control. The constructs were introduced into the genome by P-element-mediated transformation (27Rubin G.M. Spradling A.C. Science. 1982; 218: 348-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (2339) Google Scholar). Fly Stocks—Flies were reared on glucose cornmeal agar medium at 25 °C. Strain yw67c23 Df(1)w67c23 was used as a recipient for transgenic flies. P{UAS-GFP.S65T}T2 was obtained from the Kyoto Stock Center (Kyoto, Japan). P{UAS-Pael-R} and P{UAS-human parkin} were gifts from B. Lu (Rockefeller University, New York, NY) (12Yang Y. Nishimura I. Imai Y. Takahashi R. Lu B. Neuron. 2003; 37: 911-924Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). P{UAS-MJDtr-Q78}was from N. Bonini (University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA) (25Warrick J.M. Paulson H.L. Gray-Board G.L. Bui Q.T. Fischbeck K.H. Pittman R.N. Bonini N.M.

P{GAL4-elav.L}2 was combined with P{UAS-Pael-R} to make elav > Pael-R stocks, which facilitate further genetic crosses with various upstream activating sequence (UAS) transgenes. P{GAL4-elav.L}3 was used for other crosses as elav-GAL4 driver. dhdP8 and dhdJ5 were gifts from H. Salz (Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH) (22Salz H.K. Flickinger T.W. Mittendorf E. Pellicena-Palle A. Petschek J.P. Albrecht E.B. Genetics. 1994; 136: 1075-1086Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Both mutants were backcrossed six times into yw67c23 Df(1)w67c23. Insulin Disulfide Reduction Assay—TRX activity was determined using an insulin precipitation assay as previously described (28Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 9113-9119Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). GST-TrxT fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) and purified using glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The protein concentrations were determined using a Bio-Rad protein assay system with bovine serum albumin as the standard. After preincubation of the recombinant proteins in 100 μl of assay mixture containing 0.1 μg/ml bovine insulin (Sigma), 2 mm EDTA, and 0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, for 15 min at room temperature, the reaction was initiated by adding 0.4 μl of 10 mm dithiothreitol. Increases in the absorbance at 595 nm were monitored at 25 °C using a Model U-1100 spectrophotometer (Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan). Assays were performed with concentrations of 50 and 75 μg/ml for TrxT and 50 μg/ml for TrxT(C35A) and TrxT(D26A/K57I). Chaperone Activity—The chaperone activity of TrxT was determined by monitoring the refolding of citrate synthase (Sigma) as described previously (21Kern R. Malki A. Holmgren A. Richarme G. Biochem. J. 2003; 371: 965-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 29Jakob U. Gaestel M. Engel K. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1517-1520Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Citrate synthase at a concentration of 1 μm was denatured in 8 m urea and 13.3 mm dithiothreitol for 1 h at 25°C. Renaturation was initiated by 24-fold dilution in 149 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 0.74 mm EDTA for 90 min at 25 °C in the presence or absence of GST fusion proteins. The citrate synthase activity was determined by adding a 40-μl aliquot of each citrate synthase mixture to 800 μl of assay mixture containing 158 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.023 mm acetyl CoA, 0.5 mm oxaloacetic acid, and 0.12 mm 5,5′-dithiobis-2-nitrobenzoic acid and measuring the absorbance at 412 nm using a Model UV-160A spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) for 30 s. Climbing Activity—Climbing activity assays were performed as described previously (30Le Bourg E. Minois N. Exp. Gerontol. 1999; 34: 157-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Briefly, a total of 10–20 flies were bumped down to the bottom of a graduated cylinder (diameter 2 cm; length 20 cm), and pictures were taken at 18 s after the bumping to observe the distances that individual flies had climbed up the wall of the cylinder. In total, 10 trials were carried out for each time point and genotype, and the mean (±S.E.) distance was calculated. Experiments involving TRX transgenes were carried out using at least two independent transgenic lines for each construct. Immunohistochemistry—Adult brains were dissected from flies in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and immediately fixed in 4% formaldehyde/PBS for 1 h. Next, the tissues were washed in PBS containing 0.03% Triton X-100 (PBST) for 10 min, incubated in methanol for 20 min, washed four times in PBST for 10 min each, blocked in 10% goat serum/PBST for 2 h at room temperature, and incubated with an anti-tyrosine hydroxylase antibody (31Neckameyer W. Woodrome S. Holt B. Mayer A. Neurobiol. Aging. 2000; 21: 145-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) at a dilution of 1:1000 in 10% goat serum/PBST at 4 °C overnight. After three washes in PBST for 10 min each, the tissues were incubated with an Alexa 568-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) at a dilution of 1:2000 in PBST for 2 h at 25°C. The samples were then washed with PBS and mounted with GEL/MOUNT (Cosmo Bio, Tokyo, Japan). Between 5 and 10 fly heads were examined for each genotype per time point. Hydrogen Peroxide Resistance—S2 cells were transfected with pUAS-GFP, pUAS-TrxT, pUAS-TrxT(C35A), or TrxT(D26A/K57I) using Effectene (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) together with pUAS-lacZ and pWAGAL4 (a gift from Dr. Y. Hiromi, National Institute of Genetics, Mishima, Japan). At 48 h after transfection, the cells were exposed to 20 mm H2O2 for 16 h and then lysed with 250 μl of lysis buffer (100 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.8, 0.2% Triton X-100, and 1 mm dithiothreitol). Debris was removed by centrifugation, and the β-galactosidase activity in the supernatant was determined. Briefly, 30 μl of each cell extract was added to 270 μl of reaction solution (100 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, 1 mm MgCl2, and 350 μm 2-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside) and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. The reaction was stopped by adding 500 μl of 1 m Na2CO3, and the absorbance at 420 nm was measured. Viability was determined as the percentage of β-galactosidase activity in H2O2-treated cells relative to that in untreated cells. Longevity—Newly eclosed males of appropriate genotypes were collected within 24 h and transferred to new vials containing food every 2–3 days until all the flies had died. A total of 90 flies/genotype (30 flies/vial) was used for longevity assays, and the number of dead flies was counted at the time of each transfer. Experiments were performed at 25 °C. Drosophila TRX Genes—The Drosophila genome contains three genes that encode TRX-like proteins, namely Dhd (22Salz H.K. Flickinger T.W. Mittendorf E. Pellicena-Palle A. Petschek J.P. Albrecht E.B. Genetics. 1994; 136: 1075-1086Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), Trx-2 (23Bauer H. Kanzok S.M. Schirmer R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 17457-17463Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), and TrxT (24Svensson M.J. Chen J.D. Pirrotta V. Larsson J. Chromosoma. 2003; 112: 133-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). These three TRX proteins have a conserved redox active site consisting of Cys-Gly-Pro-Cys-Lys (supplemental Fig. S1). TrxT consists of 157 amino acid residues with a carboxyl-terminal extension of ∼50 amino acids compared with the other two proteins and is expressed at a high level in the testes (24Svensson M.J. Chen J.D. Pirrotta V. Larsson J. Chromosoma. 2003; 112: 133-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). However, its biochemical properties are poorly characterized. To examine whether TrxT has insulin-reducing activity similar to other TRX proteins, we cloned a cDNA encoding TrxT and expressed it as a GST fusion protein in E. coli. The purified fusion protein was subjected to insulin disulfide reduction assays as described under “Experimental Procedures” (Fig. 1a). To assess the role of the redox active site, we generated redox-defective mutants, TrxT(C35A) and TrxT(D26A/K57I), in which cysteine, glutamate, and lysine residues were replaced with alanine or isoleucine at the indicated positions (supplemental Fig. S1). The wild-type TrxT fusion protein showed insulin disulfide-reducing activity, whereas the redox-defective mutants did not. These results demonstrate that Drosophila TrxT is an active redox protein and further confirm that the conserved active site residues, including Cys-35, Asp-26, and Lys-57, are essential for its redox function. Another biochemical property of TRX is a chaperone activity. TRX from E. coli has also been shown to function as a chaperone (21Kern R. Malki A. Holmgren A. Richarme G. Biochem. J. 2003; 371: 965-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined whether Drosophila TRX has a chaperone activity using citrate synthase-refolding assays as described under “Experimental Procedures.” As shown in Fig. 1b, chaperone activity of TrxT was detected in a dose-dependent manner, whereas no activity was detected with GST alone or ovalbumin as controls. Furthermore, the redox-defective mutants TrxT(C35A) and TrxT(D26A/K57I) showed similar high chaperone activities to wild-type TrxT. These results are consistent with a previous study using a redox-defective TRX from E. coli (21Kern R. Malki A. Holmgren A. Richarme G. Biochem. J. 2003; 371: 965-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Therefore, these mutants are useful for assessing the contribution of the antioxidant activity of TRX without affecting its chaperone activity. Panneural Expression of TrxT Inhibits Pael-R Neurotoxicity in Drosophila—Because oxidative stress and dysfunction of the ubiquitin-proteasomal system have been considered to promote PD symptoms, we examined whether TRX could inhibit the neurodegenerative process in a Drosophila model. To achieve this, we used a transgenic Drosophila model that misexpresses human Pael-R, a substrate of the E3 ubiquitin ligase Parkin, which has been associated with autosomal recessive juvenile PD (5Imai Y. Soda M. Inoue H. Hattori N. Mizuno Y. Takahashi R. Cell. 2001; 105: 891-902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (933) Google Scholar, 12Yang Y. Nishimura I. Imai Y. Takahashi R. Lu B. Neuron. 2003; 37: 911-924Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). These flies show age-dependent selective degeneration of DA neurons. Although the behavioral phenotype of the model has not yet been characterized, it is highly likely that motor function declines in an age-dependent manner, as observed in another PD Drosophila model that misexpresses α-synuclein (32Feany M.B. Bender W.W. Nature. 2000; 404: 394-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (1725) Google Scholar). We used climbing assays to assess the locomotor function of the Pael-R-misexpressing flies. On day 5, the average climbing activity of control flies coexpressing GFP was 18.3 ± 0.2 cm, and this declined to 4.7 ± 0.3 cm on day 50 (Fig. 2a). In co-overexpression experiments, hPK was included as a positive control (12Yang Y. Nishimura I. Imai Y. Takahashi R. Lu B. Neuron. 2003; 37: 911-924Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). On day 5, no dramatic change was observed in the climbing activity of flies co-overexpressing TrxT, Trx-2, dhd, or hPK, although the activities of the latter three genotypes were slightly higher than that of control flies (p < 0.05). However, coexpression of each of these proteins dramatically improved the climbing activity in 50-day-old flies, producing average activities of 10.3 ± 0.4, 9.9 ± 0.7, 10.6 ± 0.4, and 10.1 ± 0.8 cm for TrxT, Trx-2, dhd, and hPK, respectively. These results indicate that overexpression of any of the Drosophila TRX genes can suppress the Pael-R-induced defects in climbing activity in aged animals. Next, we examined the number of DA neurons, because these are selectively lost in Pael-R-misexpressing flies. Adult brains of the various genotypes were dissected and immunochemically stained using an anti-tyrosine hydroxylase antibody to visualize DA neurons. We counted the number of DA neurons in the dorsomedial clusters (Fig. 2, b–e). The average number of DA neurons in young (5-day-old) control flies coexpressing GFP was ∼19, of which 80% on average had been lost in 50-day-old flies. The phenotype was clearly rescued by coexpression of the TRX transgenes, producing mean numbers of DA neurons of 12.5 ± 0.8, 10.3 ± 0.6, and 10.9 ± 1.3 for TrxT, Trx-2, and dhd, respectively. The level of rescue was again equivalent to that obtained in positive control flies coexpressing hPk (10.3 ± 0.8). These results establish that overexpression of any of the Drosophila TRX genes can suppress the Pael-R-induced neurotoxicity in Drosophila. Redox-defective TrxT Mutants Suppress Pael-R Toxicity—TRX functions, at least, as an antioxidant and a molecular chaperone. To assess the contribution of its antioxidant activity to the suppression of Pael-R-induced neurotoxicity, each of the redox-defective TrxT constructs was introduced into the Drosophila genome and coexpressed with Pael-R. As shown in Fig. 3a, overexpression of either mutant form of TrxT improved the climbing activity similar to wild-type TrxT at 50 days of age. Specifically, the average climbing activities were 10.3 ± 0.4, 8.7 ± 0.1, and 8.9 ± 0.3 cm for flies coexpressing TrxT, TrxT(C35A), and TrxT(D26A/K57I), respectively. The slightly lower levels of climbing activity observed for the mutants may suggest that there is some contribution of the antioxidant activity. With respect to the numbers of DA neurons, similar levels of rescue were observed for the wild-type TrxT and redox-defective TrxT mutants. Specifically, the average numbers of DA neurons were 12.5 ± 0.9, 11.8 ± 0.9, and 11.7 ± 0.8 for TrxT, TrxT(C35A), and TrxT(D26A/K57I), respectively (Fig. 3b). These results suggest that the antioxidant activity of TRX is unlikely to be the major cause of the suppression of Pael-R neurotoxicity in Drosophila. TRX Promotes the Viability of Cells Exposed to Hydrogen Peroxide—We next investigated the extent to which TRX can protect cells from the oxidative stress induced by hydrogen peroxide, using cultured S2 cells. Cell viability was monitored by the activity of β-galactosidase, which was cotransfected with wild-type TrxT or redox-defective TrxT mutants (Fig. 4). Wild-type TrxT increased the cell viability compared with control expressing GFP (29.7% versus 41.6%). The TrxT mutants lacking redox activity were also capable of increasing the cell viability (39.5 and 33.6% for TrxT(C35A) and TrxT(D26A/K57I), respectively). However, there were significant differences in the viabilities between the wild-type TrxT and TrxT mutants, suggesting that the antioxidant activity of TRX also contributes to cell viability. Mutations in Trx Family Genes Alter Resistance to Pael-R—To address the functional redundancy of TRX family genes, we examined whether loss-of-function mutations in TRX genes could influence the Pael-R-induced phenotype. When elav > GAL4 was combined with dhdP8, a null allele of dhd, the average climbing ability (2.4 ± 0.2 cm) was significantly reduced compared with those with wild-type (7.4 ± 0.3 cm) (Fig. 5). When dhdJ5 was combined, the climbing activity was further reduced (0.8 ± 0.1 cm) from those with dhdP8 (t test, p < 0.01). Because dhdJ5 was deleted for TrxT and dhd, the results imply that both genes were required for the resistance to Pael-R and that the functions of TRX family proteins were additive in terms of resistance to the Pael-R-induced neurotoxicity. Overexpression of Trx Suppresses MJD-derived Polyglutamine Toxicity—To examine whether TRX can suppress neurotoxicity in other models of neurodegenerative disease, we overexpressed TRX transgenes in a Drosophila MJD model expressing a carboxyl-terminal fragment of ataxin-3 that contains the glutamine"
https://openalex.org/W1995647493,"Despite the existence of a functional arginine vasopressin (AVP) system in the adult heart and evidence that AVP induces myogenesis, its significance in cardiomyogenesis is currently unknown. In the present study, we hypothesized a role for AVP in cardiac differentiation of D3 and lineage-specific embryonic stem (ES) cells expressing green fluorescent protein under the control of atrial natriuretic peptide (Anp) or myosin light chain-2V (Mlc-2V) promoters. Furthermore, we investigated the nitric oxide (NO) involvement in AVP-mediated pathways. AVP exposure increased the number of beating embryoid bodies, fluorescent cells, and expression of Gata-4 and other cardiac genes. V1a and V2 receptors (V1aR and V2R) differentially mediated these effects in transgenic ES cells, and exhibited a distinct developmentally regulated mRNA expression pattern. A NO synthase inhibitor, l-NAME, powerfully antagonized the AVP-induced effects on cardiogenic differentiation, implicating NO signaling in AVP-mediated pathways. Indeed, AVP elevated the mRNA and protein levels of endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) through V2R stimulation. Remarkably, increased beating activity was found in AVP-treated ES cells with down-regulated eNOS expression, indicating the significant involvement of additional pathways in cardiomyogenic effects of AVP. Finally, patch clamp recordings revealed specific AVP-induced changes of action potentials and increased l-type Ca2+ (ICa,L) current densities in differentiated ventricular phenotypes. Thus, AVP promotes cardiomyocyte differentiation of ES cells and involves Gata-4 and NO signaling. AVP-induced action potential prolongation appears likely to be linked to the increased ICa,L current in ventricular cells. In conclusion, this report provides new evidence for the essential role of the AVP system in ES cell-derived cardiomyogenesis. Despite the existence of a functional arginine vasopressin (AVP) system in the adult heart and evidence that AVP induces myogenesis, its significance in cardiomyogenesis is currently unknown. In the present study, we hypothesized a role for AVP in cardiac differentiation of D3 and lineage-specific embryonic stem (ES) cells expressing green fluorescent protein under the control of atrial natriuretic peptide (Anp) or myosin light chain-2V (Mlc-2V) promoters. Furthermore, we investigated the nitric oxide (NO) involvement in AVP-mediated pathways. AVP exposure increased the number of beating embryoid bodies, fluorescent cells, and expression of Gata-4 and other cardiac genes. V1a and V2 receptors (V1aR and V2R) differentially mediated these effects in transgenic ES cells, and exhibited a distinct developmentally regulated mRNA expression pattern. A NO synthase inhibitor, l-NAME, powerfully antagonized the AVP-induced effects on cardiogenic differentiation, implicating NO signaling in AVP-mediated pathways. Indeed, AVP elevated the mRNA and protein levels of endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) through V2R stimulation. Remarkably, increased beating activity was found in AVP-treated ES cells with down-regulated eNOS expression, indicating the significant involvement of additional pathways in cardiomyogenic effects of AVP. Finally, patch clamp recordings revealed specific AVP-induced changes of action potentials and increased l-type Ca2+ (ICa,L) current densities in differentiated ventricular phenotypes. Thus, AVP promotes cardiomyocyte differentiation of ES cells and involves Gata-4 and NO signaling. AVP-induced action potential prolongation appears likely to be linked to the increased ICa,L current in ventricular cells. In conclusion, this report provides new evidence for the essential role of the AVP system in ES cell-derived cardiomyogenesis.

AVP is involved in the regulation of body fluid osmolality, blood volume and pressure via the stimulation of specific receptors with distinct pharmacological profiles and intracellular second messengers (1Holmes C.L. Landry D.W. Granton J.T. Crit. Care. 2003; 7: 427-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 2Thibonnier M. Berti-Mattera L.N. Dulin N. Conarty D.M. Mattera R. Prog. Brain Res. 1998; 119: 147-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). AVP activity is mediated by at least 3 different G-protein-coupled receptors, called V1a, V1b (also known as V3), and V2. The V1a receptor (V1aR), abundantly expressed in vascular smooth muscle cells, hepatocytes, and platelets, and V1b receptor (V1bR), predominantly found in the anterior pituitary, are linked to the phosphoinositol signaling pathway with intracellular calcium as second messenger. In contrast, the V2 receptor (V2R) is coupled to the adenylate cyclase signaling with intracellular cAMP as the second messenger. V2R has long been recognized to be exclusively expressed in kidney (3Laugwitz K.L. Ungerer M. Schoneberg T. Weig H.J. Kronsbein K. Moretti A. Hoffmann K. Seyfarth M. Schultz G. Schomig A. Circulation. 1999; 99: 925-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), but there is increasing evidence of extrarenal V2R expression (4Bernat A. Hoffmann P. Dumas A. Serradeil-le Gal C.

Recently, a role was suggested for AVP as a novel myogenesis-promoting factor (7Scicchitano B.M. Spath L. Musaro A. Molinaro M. Adamo S. Nervi C. Mol.

Cell. 2005; 16: 3632-3641Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). AVP was shown to regulate the expression of early and late myogenic differentiation markers in cultured myogenic cell lines. In addition, studies on endothelial and osteoblast-like cells indicated a potential involvement of nitric oxide (NO) in proliferation pathways mediated by AVP (6Kaufmann J.E. Iezzi M. Vischer U.M. J.

Peptides. 2005; 26: 1661-1666Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). NO is a universal signaling molecule implicated in many physiological and pathophysiological functions. In the adult heart, NO is involved in the regulation of heart rate, contractility, and coronary perfusion. Moreover, increasing evidence indicates an important role of NO in cardiac differentiation (10Kanno S. Kim P.K. Sallam K. Lei J. Billiar T.R. Shears 2nd, L.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 12277-12281Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). In a previous report, we addressed mechanisms promoting differentiation of the mammalian cardiac conduction system in murine embryonic stem (ES) cells (11Gassanov N. Er F. Zagidullin N. Hoppe U.C. FASEB J. 2004; 18: 1710-1712Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cardiomyogenic differentiation in ES cells is manifested by the appearance of spontaneously and rhythmically beating cardiomyocytes within developing embryoid bodies (EBs). Differentiation of ES cells to the cardiac lineage provides a model for the exploration of mechanisms and genes involved in the earliest steps of cardiac development. Therefore, the aim of this study was to undertake a detailed analysis of the cardiomyogenic actions of AVP during ES cell differentiation and the role of NO in AVP-mediated pathways. To determine whether AVP specifically affects the differentiation of atrial or ventricular phenotypes, we used ES cell clones expressing the green fluorescent protein (GFP) gene under the control of cardiac-restricted atrial natriuretic peptide (Anp) or myosin light chain-2V (Mlc-2V) promoters and a D3 ES cell line as a wild type counterpart. In addition, we examined the effects of AVP on the action potential (AP) profile and expression of the L-type Ca2+ (ICa,L) channel in ES cell-derived cardiomyocytes. In this study, we demonstrate that AVP promotes ES cell-derived cardiomyogenic differentiation through stimulation of its receptors and involves NO signaling. Moreover, a unique developmentally regulated pattern of AVP receptor expression was found throughout the differentiation period of ES cells. We further show specific alterations of the AP pattern and increased ICa,L expression in ES cell-derived ventricular phenotypes in response to AVP. This report provides new evidence for the essential role of the AVP system in cardiomyogenesis, as determined by the application of combined molecular-biological, flow cytometric, and electrophysiological studies. Cell Culture—To generate ventricular-specific ES cells, the CMVenh/MLC-2V/GFP construct (a generous gift from Dr. C. L. Mummery, Hubrecht Laboratory, University Medical Center, Utrecht, The Netherlands) was stably transfected into D3 ES cells with a FuGENE 6 kit (Roche) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The transfected ES cells were cultured for 10 days in the presence of neomycin (G418), and resistant clones were further selected. The ANP-EGFP expressing ES cell line has been described previously (11Gassanov N. Er F. Zagidullin N. Hoppe U.C. FASEB J. 2004; 18: 1710-1712Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). ES cells were grown feeder-independent in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 1,000 units/ml leukemia inhibitory factor (Chemicon International Inc., Temecula, CA), 15% fetal calf serum, penicillin/streptomycin, non-essential amino acids, glutamax, and β-mercaptoethanol (Invitrogen). For differentiation, about 400 cells were allowed to aggregate in hanging drops to form EBs, which were rinsed off after 2 days and subsequently propagated in suspension (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 20% fetal calf serum) for additional 4 days. Finally, at day 6, EBs were plated separately on gelatincoated 24-well plates and cultivated in the presence or absence of AVP for 14 days as indicated. All experiments were performed on EBs of 3 different clones in each cell line at days 14-15 after plating, unless the developmental stage is specified otherwise. AVP concentration was determined in preliminary studies where spontaneously beating activity of developing EBs was assessed in the presence of increasing AVP concentrations (10-9 to 10-5 m) (Bachem Bioscience, PA). Because a maximal response was observed for treatment with 10-7 m AVP, this concentration was used throughout the study. Selective 10-7 m V1aR (β-mercapto-β,β-cyclopentamethylene-propionyl1, O-Me-Tyr2, [Arg8]vasopressin), V2R (adamantaneacetyl1, O-Et-d-Tyr2, Val4, aminobutyryl6, [Arg8,9]vasopressin), or oxytocin receptor (OTR) (β-mercapto-β,β-cyclopentamethylene-propionyl-Tyr (Me)2-Ile-Thr-Asn-Cys-Pro-Orn-Tyr-NH2) antagonists were added to the AVP containing differentiation media. When appropriate, EBs were also cultured in the presence of 10-4 ml-NAME (N,G-nitro-l-arginine-methyl ester, Sigma) with or without AVP supplementation. Flow Cytometry Analysis (FACS)—ANP-EGFP and MLC-2V-GFP expressing EB outgrowths at early (designated as days 2-4 after plating), intermediate (days 6-8), and late (days 12-14) developmental stages were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline and harvested after treatment with Accutase (Innovative Cell Technologies Inc., CA). The cells were suspended in phosphate-buffered saline containing Ca2+ (1 mm) and Mg2+ (0.5 mm), and a minimum of 10,000 viable cells were acquired for each sample. GFP expressing cells were analyzed and sorted in the FL1 channel on the basis of the forward-scattered and side-scattered light in FACS Aria™ Cell Sorter (BD Bioscience) as the cells traversed the beam of an argon ion laser (488 nm). Data were analyzed by using Cell Quest software (BD Bioscience). The sorted cells were collected in corresponding differentiation medium and allowed to reattach to culture dishes. Gene expression studies were performed after 24-36 h. Reverse Transcriptase-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR)—Total RNA from D3 EB outgrowths or GFP-positive ANP-EGFP or MLC-2V-GFP expressing ES cells at different developmental stages was extracted by TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). RT-PCR of genes of V1aR, V1bR, V2R, Gata-4, Mlc-2V, ANP, cardiac α-actin, myogenin, MyoD, and endothelial nitric-oxide synthase (eNOS) was performed with 2 μg of DNase-treated (Turbo DNase-free, Ambion Inc.) total RNA. For all PCR studies, dose-response curves were established for different amounts of RNA, and the samples were quantified in the curvilinear phase of PCR amplification (12Jankowski M. Rachelska G. Donghao W. McCann S.M. Gutkowska J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 11765-11770Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The primers and PCR conditions are described in Table 1. The PCR products were size fractionated by 2% agarose gel electrophoresis and analyzed with the Storm 840 Imaging Systems and ImageQuant software (version 4.2, GE Healthcare). The concentrations of mRNA were normalized with respect to 18 S gene.TABLE 1PCR primers and conditionsNameSequenceAnnealing temperature°CV1aR5-ATGCTGGTGGTGATGACGGCTGACCGCTAC-362(533 bp)5-CATCTGGACACTGAAGAAAGGTGCCCAGCA-3V1bR5-TCACCTGGACCACCATGGCCAT-362(333 bp)5-CTTCATTAGGGGCATTCTCGT-3V2R5-ATGGTGGGCATGTATGCCTCCTCCTACATG-362(462 bp)5-AGTGTCATCCTCACGGTCTTGGCCA-3Mlc-2V5-TGTGGGTCACCTGAGGCTGTGGTTCAG-365(189 bp)5-GAAGGCTGACTATGTCCGGGAGATGC-3Anp5-CTGATGGATTTCAAGAACCTGCTAGACC-354(346 bp)5-CTGTTATCTTCGGTACCGGAAGCTGTTGCAGCC-3eNOS5-AACCAGCGTCCTGCAAAC-355(181 bp)5-CAAAGAAAAGCTCTGGGTGC-3Gata-45-CACTATGGGCACAGCAGCTCC-361(145 bp)5-TTGGAGCTGGCCTGCGATGTC-3α-Actin5-TGTTACGTCGCCTTGGATTTTGAG-354(494 bp)5-AAGAGAGAGACATATCAGAAGC-3MyoD5-GCTCTGATGGCATGATGGAT-356(164 bp)5-GTGGAGATGCGCTCCACTAT-3Myogenin5-ATCCAGTACATTGAGCGCCT-356(186 bp)5-GCAAATGATCTCCTGGGTTG-3 Open table in a new tab Immunoblotting—For Western blot analysis, enzymatically dispersed cells were lysed with radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer. Protein concentration was quantified spectrophoto-metrically by Bradfords assay (Bio-Rad). 20 μg of total protein were loaded and fractioned by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions. Separated proteins were transferred electrophoretically to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Amersham Biosciences). Blots were incubated with the primary antibody against mouse eNOS (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) overnight at +4 °C, followed by incubation with peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Amersham Biosciences) the next day for 1 h at room temperature. The 140-kDa eNOS protein fragment was visualized with an ECL kit (Amersham Biosciences). ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD) was applied for densitometric analysis of selected band intensities. β-Actin was used as internal control. Small Interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated eNOS Gene Silencing—eNOS siRNA duplexes (sense, 5-CGUGGAUGAGCCAGCUCAATT-3; antisense, 5-UUGAGCUGGCUCAUCCACGTG-3) targeted to the 21-nucleotide mouse eNOS mRNA sequence (CACGTGGATGAGCCAGCTCAA) and validated siRNA negative control (scrambled siRNA) were designed commercially (Qiagen, ON, Canada) and prepared as recommended by the manufacturer. The methodology of siRNA transfection in ES cells was adopted and modified from previous reports (13Zou G.M. Wu W. Chen J. Rowley J.D. Biol. Cell. 2003; 95: 365-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 14Hay D.C. Sutherland L. Clark J. Burdon T. Stem Cells. 2004; 22: 225-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). Differentiating D3 EBs in suspension were transferred to 24-well plates, followed by transfection with eNOS siRNA (Qiagen) according to the instructions provided. After 24 h, the cells were retransfected as before and incubated in differentiation media in the presence or absence of AVP or AVP with the additional antagonists. EB outgrowths were examined for beating activity and the protein levels of eNOS and β-actin were detected by Western blotting. Electrophysiology—Single cells were obtained by dissection of spontaneously beating EB areas and collagenase dispersion. AP and ICa,L recordings were carried out in the whole cell patch clamp configuration with an Axopatch 200B amplifier (Axon Instruments, CA) while sampling at 10 kHz and filtering at 2 kHz. The recording bath solution contained (in mmol/liter): NaCl 135, KCl 5, CaCl2 2, MgCl2 1, glucose 10, HEPES 10; pH was adjusted to 7.4 with NaOH, and temperature was kept constant at 35-36 °C. Recordings and analysis of ICa,L were performed as indicated in Ref. 15Gassanov N. Brandt M.C. Michels G. Lindner M. Er F. Hoppe U.C. Cell Calcium. 2006; 39: 175-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar. For ICa,L recordings, NaCl was replaced with tetraethylammonium chloride (TEA-Cl) (135 mmol/liter) and 4-aminopyridine (4 mmol/liter) was added to block Ito. The pipette solution contained (in mmol/liter): Cs-aspartate 120, CsCl 15, NaCl 5, MgCl2 1, Mg2ATP 4, EGTA 5, HEPES 5; pH was adjusted to 7.4 with CsOH. Borosilicate microelectrodes were pulled with tip resistances of 2-4 MΩ (Narishige Inc., Japan). Statistical Analysis—Results are presented as mean ± S.E. Comparisons between groups were evaluated by one-way analysis of variance. p values of <0.05 were considered as significant. AVP Enhances Cardiomyogenesis in ES Cells—First, our study addressed the role of AVP in ES cell-derived cardiomyogenesis. Spontaneous cardiomyocyte differentiation of D3 cells was assessed in the presence of AVP or AVP with additional V1aR, V2R, or OTR antagonist. The incidence of spontaneously beating activity was analyzed by microscopy of 120 EB out-growths in each subgroup. As shown in Fig. 1A, 10-7 m AVP exposure significantly increased the percentage of EBs with beating foci in D3 cells compared with the untreated (control) group (39.2 ± 4.9 versus 23.3 ± 3.4%; p < 0.05). The effect of AVP on the number of contracting D3 EBs tended to be inhibited by both V1aR and V2R antagonists. To determine the impact of AVP on specialized cardiac phenotypes, further experiments were performed on lineage-specific ANP-EGFP and MLC-2V-GFP expressing ES cell lines. Treatment with AVP significantly increased the percentage of beating EBs expressing ANP-EGFP (47.5 ± 3.9 versus 25.9 ± 4.0%; p < 0.05) (Fig. 1B) and MLC-2V-GFP (45.0 ± 5.8 versus 32.5 ± 3.6%; p < 0.05) (Fig. 1C). In the ANP-EGFP cell line, AVP-induced effects were strongly inhibited when V2R was specifically blocked (30.8 ± 4.7%; p < 0.05 versus AVP), whereas only a minor reduction in the number of contracting EBs was detected for V1aR antagonist (43.3% ± 6.2). An opposite but nonsignificant effect was observed in MLC-2V-GFP expressing ES cells, where the inhibitory effect of the V1aR antagonist (34.2 ± 2.4%) prevailed over that of the V2R blocker (42.4 ± 6.9%). No inhibitory action of OTR antagonist was apparent in the investigated ES cell lines (Fig. 1, A-C). The role of NO in AVP-mediated ES cell differentiation was evaluated in EB aggregates of all 3 cell lines subjected to additional treatment with l-NAME, a nonspecific NOS inhibitor. As illustrated in Fig. 1, A-C, AVP effects were largely abolished if EBs were exposed to l-NAME. Next, we quantified the GFP expression pattern in AVP-treated transgenic ES cells by flow cytometry. Generally, MLC-2V-GFP-positive EBs displayed lower fluorescent intensities (as evidenced by fluorescence intensity ranging from 103 to 104 counts), but a greater number of green fluorescent cells than ANP-EGFP expressing myocytes (Fig. 2, A-D). However, in both cell lines, AVP induced a significant increase in the number of cells emitting green fluorescence compared with the untreated population (Fig. 2, E and F), without affecting the fluorescence intensities. This was particularly evident in ANP-EGFP expressing cardiac cells (7.6 ± 0.9 versus 4.4 ± 0.3%, n = 12; p < 0.05), whereas the effect on the MLC-2V-GFP-positive cell population was less pronounced (11.9 ± 1.3 versus 8.2 ± 0.7%, n = 13; p < 0.05). Application of l-NAME significantly reduced the percentage of GFP-positive cells in both cell lines (ANP-EGFP, 2.9 ± 0.7%; p < 0.05 versus AVP; MLC-2V-GFP, 6.3 ± 0.4%; p < 0.05 versus AVP). GFP expressing cells, isolated from EBs at various differentiation stages, were sorted by FACS, and the cardiogenic potency of AVP was further investigated by RT-PCR analysis of cardiac marker genes. In both cell lines, consistent enhancement of Gata-4 expression by AVP was found throughout cardiac differentiation (Fig. 3, A and B). Terminally differentiated, AVP-treated cardiomyocytes exhibited higher Anp, Mlc-2V, and cardiac α-actin mRNA levels (Fig. 3, B and E). Interestingly, V1aR was involved predominantly in the AVP-induced increase of Gata-4 and Mlc-2V expression, whereas the considerably V2R-mediated inhibition was observed for the Anp gene transcript in differentiated cardiac cells.FIGURE 3Expression of Gata-4, Anp, Mlc-2V, and α-actin genes in ANP-EGFP (A) and MLC-2V-GFP (B) positive ES cells by semi-quantitative RT-PCR. Gene expression was normalized to the ribosomal 18 S signal. Significantly increased expression of Gata-4 was found in both cell lines upon exposure to AVP. This effect was predominantly inhibited by V1aR antagonism (upper panels). Late stage AVP-treated cardiomyocytes also displayed higher expression of Anp, Mlc-2V (middle panels), and α-actin gene transcripts (lower panels). For each gene, at least 5 replicate RT-PCR determinations were performed at the indicated time points.

However, no specific expression for both genes was found by RT-PCR (data not shown). Developmental Profiles of AVP Receptor Expression—Detailed developmentally regulated expression profiles of AVP receptors were established by RT-PCR in untreated D3 EBs at days 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 20, and 25 after plating. The results demonstrated that V1aR, V1bR, and V2R were abundantly expressed in the early developmental stage (days 1-6) (Fig. 4, A and B). However, as development progressed, all 3 investigated receptors exhibited major differences with respect to their relative abundance in differentiating EBs. At every time point studied, V2R was expressed at highest levels throughout the differentiation period with a slight decrease at days 20-25. In contrast, expression of V1aR decreased sharply after day 6, and was barely detectable at days 15-25. V1bR mRNA expression was transiently down-regulated at around day 10, but increased by days 15-25 to levels similar to those at days 1-6. AVP Increases eNOS Expression—To evidence the possible link between AVP and NO signaling pathways in cardiomyogenesis, we investigated eNOS expression, a NOS isoform abundantly synthesized during ES cell-derived differentiation (16Bloch W. Fleischmann B.K. Lorke D.E. Andressen C. Hops B. Hescheler J. Addicks K. Cardiovasc. Res. 1999; 43: 675-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), using RT-PCR and Western blotting. In these experiments, ES cells of the D3 line were treated with AVP in the presence or absence of V1aR, V2R, OTR antagonists, or l-NAME. RT-PCR analysis (Fig. 5A) showed up-regulation of eNOS mRNA under AVP exposure. This effect was reversed by treatment with V2R antagonist or l-NAME. Incubation of EBs with the V1aR antagonist did not influence eNOS mRNA level. Western blotting confirmed the involvement of eNOS in AVP-mediated cardiomyocyte differentiation (Fig. 5B), because the exposure of EBs to AVP increased eNOS protein. The AVP-induced rise in eNOS expression was reduced by V2R antagonist, and an even stronger decline was detected in l-NAME-treated ES cells. In contrast, application of the V1R antagonist only slightly diminished eNOS protein expression in AVP-treated EB aggregates. The AVP-mediated increase in eNOS expression seems to be partly regulated also by OTR, as lower eNOS mRNA and protein levels were observed in ES cells treated with OTR antagonist. AVP Effects in eNOS siRNA-transfected Cells—To further validate the functional relevance of the above described findings, we used specific siRNA-mediated targeting of the eNOS gene and evaluated whether a decrease in endogenous eNOS expression would affect the AVP-mediated effects on contracting EBs. The siRNA-induced knock-down of gene expression was specific to the targeted gene, as eNOS protein was unaffected by scrambled siRNA transfection at days 2 and 5, and down-regulated in ES cells transfected with eNOS siRNA (Fig. 6, A and B). Because the highest decrease (by 75%) in relative eNOS protein expression was detected at day 5 after the second transfection (0.3 ± 0.09 versus 1.2 ± 0.16%, p < 0.05) (Fig. 6C), the spontaneously beating activity of transfected EB outgrowths (n = 192 in each subgroup) was analyzed at day 5. Indeed, beating incidence in transfected ES cells was lower (13.0 ± 1.8%; p < 0.05) compared with the non-transfected (24.0 ± 2.7%) or scrambled siRNA group (22.4 ± 2.6%) (Fig. 6D). An increased number of contracting EBs was found in AVP-treated transfected cells (21.4 ± 1.7%; p < 0.05). AVP failed to raise spontaneously beating in EB outgrowths with additional exposure to the V1aR antagonist (14.1 ± 1.7%). In contrast, the V2R antagonist showed no impact in AVP-induced cardiomyogenic effects with eNOS depletion (20.3 ± 3.1%). Electrophysiological Profile of AVP-treated Cardiomyocytes—The precise phenotypic characteristics were established by examining AP recordings of cardiomyocytes isolated from spontaneously beating, AVP-treated (n = 38) and control EBs (n = 27) of the D3 line. Based on the typical AP configuration and electro-physiological parameters described in Table 2, all cardiac cell subtypes (pacemaker-, ventricular-, and atrial-like) could be identified among differentiated ES cells (Fig. 7, A and B). AVP tended to increase the number of atrial-like cells (37 ± 1.0, n = 14, versus 30 ± 2.6%, n = 8) while decreasing the pacemaker-like phenotypes (13 ± 0.8, n = 5, versus 22 ± 1.1%, n = 6). Interestingly, AVP-treated ventricular-like myocytes displayed a more prominent plateau phase compared with the same control phenotype (Fig. 7B). This finding was reflected in the significantly increased action potential duration at 90% of repolarization (APD90) values measured in ventricular-like cells isolated from AVP-stimulated EBs (312 ± 13 ms, n = 19, versus 240 ± 11 ms, n = 13; p < 0.05). Unlike the ventricular phenotype, no significant changes of AP pattern and basic electrophysiological properties in response to AVP were found for pacemaker- and atrial-like cardiomyocytes (Table 2).TABLE 2Electrophysiological properties of AVP-treated cardiomyocytesPacemaker-likeAtrial-likeVentricular-likeAPD90aAPD90, action potential duration measured from maximal depolarization to 90% repolarization.

Open table in a new tab Guided by the AVP-induced specific changes in AP profile in ventricular cells, we investigated whether AVP influences the expression of ICa,L, a key determinant of the AP plateau phase in ventricular cells, in terminally differentiated MLC-2V-GFP expressing cardiomyocytes. As shown in Fig. 8, AVP markedly increased the ICa,L current density (18.7 ± 2.0 pA/pF at 0 mV, n = 17) compared with controls (11.4 ± 1.2 pA/pF, n = 14; p < 0.05) without affecting the voltage dependence. The results presented in this work suggest a new role for AVP and its receptors in cardiac development. We demonstrate that: 1) AVP induces differentiation of atrial and ventricular precursor cells through V2R and V1aR, respectively; 2) both effects are mediated at least in part by NO as they can be inhibited by l-NAME; 3) V2R mediates the AVP action predominantly via eNOS up-regulation, whereas, in addition, AVP promotes cardiac differentiation in an eNOS-independent manner (as shown in siRNA-transfected cells) mainly via V1aR. The hypothesis that AVP is involved in the regulation of cardiomyogenesis emerged from previous reports showing an essential role of AVP in the differentiation of skeletal muscle (7Scicchitano B.M.

In bacteria, the thioredoxin-coupled arsenate reductase catalyzes the reduction of arsenate to arsenite by intramolecular thiol-disulfide cascade. The oxidized arsenate reductase ArsC is subsequently regenerated by thioredoxin through an intermolecular thiol-disulfide exchange process. The solution structure of the Bacillus subtilis thioredoxin-arsenate reductase complex represents the transiently formed intermediate during the intermolecular thiol-disulfide exchange reaction. A comparison of the complex structure with that of thioredoxin and arsenate reductase proteins in redox states showed substantial conformational changes coupled to the reaction process, with arsenate reductase, especially, adopting an “intermediate” conformation in the complex.

Thiol-disulfide exchange reactions between proteins are involved in many important cellular oxidation and reduction processes (1Sevier C.S. Kaiser C.A. Nat. Rev. Mol.

Thioredoxin generally functions as protein thiol-disulfide oxidoreductase for maintaining the reducing environment in cells (2Holmgren A. Johansson C. Berndt C. Lonn M.E. Hudemann C. Lillig C.H. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2005; 33: 1375-1377Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar, 3Arner E.S. Holmgren A. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 6102-6109Crossref PubMed Scopus (2026) Google Scholar). Upon interaction with its substrates, the intermolecular thiol-disulfide exchange reaction is involved, and finally an intramolecular disulfide bond is formed between the two cysteine residues in Trx. The regeneration of active Trx is accomplished by TrxR, which utilizes the reducing equivalents from NADPH. Trx catalyzes the reduction of a wide range of downstream protein targets, one of which is the well documented arsenate reductase (ArsC) family (7Rosen B.P. FEBS Lett. 2002; 529: 86-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (642) Google Scholar). ArsC catalyzes the reduction of arsenate (As(V)) to arsenite (As(III)) and is the key enzyme involved in arsenic detoxification (7Rosen B.P. FEBS Lett. 2002; 529: 86-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (642) Google Scholar). Several families of ArsC have been identified and studied extensively (8Messens J. Silver S. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 362: 1-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The thioredoxin-coupled ArsC family includes Bacillus subtilis ArsC on the chromosomal skin element and the Staphylococcus aureus ArsC on the plasmid pI258. Previous studies revealed that three redox active cysteine residues (Cys10, Cys82, and Cys89) are critical for the enzymatic activity of S. aureus ArsC (9Messens J. Hayburn G. Desmyter A. Laus G. Wyns L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16857-16865Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), all of which are conserved in B. subtilis ArsC. A disulfide cascade mechanism was proposed based on structural, biochemical, and mutagenesis studies (10Zegers I. Martins J.C. Willem R. Wyns L. Messens J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 843-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 11Messens J. Martins J.C. Van Belle K. Brosens E. Desmyter A. De Gieter M. Wieruszeski J.M. Willem R. Wyns L. Zegers I. Proc. Natl.

Residue Cys10 of ArsC is responsible for the initial nucleophilic attack on arsenate to form the ArsC-As(V) covalent intermediate. A subsequent attack by Cys82 releases the arsenite compound and introduces an intramolecular disulfide bond Cys10–Cys82. The final nucleophilic attack by Cys89 marks the completion of a single catalytic reaction cycle, converting the enzyme into its inactive form (oxidized form) and exposing an intramolecular disulfide bridge, Cys82–Cys89, onto the protein surface. The active ArsC (reduced form) is subsequently regenerated by Trx through the intermolecular thiol-disulfide exchange reactions (14Ji G. Garber E.A. Armes L.G. Chen C.M. Fuchs J.A. Silver S. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7294-7299Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 15Messens J. Van Molle I. Vanhaesebrouck P. Limbourg M. Van Belle K. Wahni K. Martins J.C. Loris R. Wyns L. J. Mol.

The flow of reducing equivalents through the NADPH-TrxR-Trx-ArsC-As(V) pathway involves both intra- and intermolecular thiol-disulfide exchange reactions, thereby providing a perfect model system. To date, the structures of both Trx and ArsC have been studied extensively (10Zegers I. Martins J.C. Willem R. Wyns L. Messens J. Nat. Struct.

Arscott L.D. Muller S. Lennon B.W. Ludwig M.L. Wang P.F. Veine D.M. Becker K. Schirmer R.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 6110-6117Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar, 5Lennon B.W.

Biol. 1994; 236: 800-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). However, the transiently formed intermediate state of Trx-ArsC interaction, which would provide essential information concerning the reaction mechanism, remains poorly understood. Attempts to crystallize the Trx-ArsC complex have failed thus far (15Messens J. Van Molle I. Vanhaesebrouck P. Limbourg M. Van Belle K. Wahni K. Martins J.C. Loris R. Wyns L. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 339: 527-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The only structures available for the Trx-substrate complex linked by a disulfide bond are the structures of human Trx complexed with short peptides from its substrates NFκB and Ref-1 (19Qin J.

Gronenborn A.M. Structure (Lond.). 1996; 4: 613-620Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Essential questions regarding the Trx-ArsC interaction remain unanswered: what are the transient conformations of ArsC and Trx in the complex, and how are the conformational properties of the proteins in different stages coupled to the reaction processes? We have reported previously the solution structures and backbone dynamics of B. subtilis ArsC in both the reduced and oxidized forms (designated as re-ArsC and ox-ArsC) (13Guo X. Li Y. Peng K. Hu Y. Li C. Xia B. Jin C. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 39601-39608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). For further understanding of the catalytic mechanisms of Trx-ArsC pathway, here we have determined the solution structures of B. subtilis Trx in both reduced and oxidized forms (designated as re-Trx and ox-Trx), and specifically we have solved the structure of the Trx-ArsC complex by NMR spectroscopy. The structure of the Trx-ArsC complex in conjunction with those of Trx and ArsC proteins in different states presents an atomic resolution view of the conformational changes along the reaction pathway. Sample Preparations—The trxA gene encoding the B. subtilis Trx was cloned into the pET21a(+) vector (Novagen), and the protein was expressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3). The pET28a(+) arsC plasmid (13Guo X. Li Y. Peng K. Hu Y. Li C. Xia B. Jin C. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 39601-39608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) and the pET21a(+) trxA plasmid were used as DNA templates in PCR amplification with primers designed to generate mutants of ArsC_C10SC15AC82S and Trx_C32S. Sample preparations of ArsC_C10SC15AC82S, Trx and Trx_C32S were similar to that previously reported (13Guo X. Li Y. Peng K. Hu Y. Li C. Xia B. Jin C. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 39601-39608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The purity of the proteins was determined to be greater than 95% as judged by SDS-PAGE. The Trx-ArsC mixed disulfide complex was made using the mutants Trx_C32S and ArsC_C10SC15AC82S by the 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) incubation method following the reported protocol (15Messens J.

Structure Calculations—The details of NMR spectra collection, processing, and analysis, as well as the structure calculations of the re-Trx and ox-Trx, can be found in the supplemental “Methods” data. The structure of Trx-ArsC complex was calculated using the program CNS (21Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16979) Google Scholar) and refined by AMBER (22Pearlman D.A. Case D.A. Caldwell J.W. Ross W.R. Cheatham III, T.E. DeBolt S. Ferguson D. Seibel G. Kollman P. Comput. Phys. Commun. 1995; 91: 1-41Crossref Scopus (2689) Google Scholar). Inter-proton NOE-derived distance restraints, the residual dipolar coupling (RDC)-derived long-range restraints, hydrogen bond restraints based on hydrogen-deuterium exchange experiments, and dihedral angle restraints based on chemical shifts (23Cornilescu G. Delaglio F. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1999; 13: 289-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (2740) Google Scholar) were used for the structure calculation. Two hundred structures were calculated using the program CNS, and the 100 structures with the lowest energy were selected and further refined using AMBER. Finally, the 20 lowest energy structures were selected as representative of the Trx-ArsC complex. The final structures were analyzed using the program packages MOLMOL (24Koradi R. Billeter M. Wuthrich K. J. Mol. Graph. 1996; 14: 29-32Crossref Scopus (6498) Google Scholar) and PROCHECK_NMR (25Laskowski R.A. Rullmannn J.A. MacArthur M.W. Kaptein R. Thornton J.M. J. Biomol. NMR. 1996; 8: 477-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (4474) Google Scholar). Interaction between Trx and ArsC—It has been demonstrated that the active S. aureus ArsC could be regenerated by Trx (14Ji G. Garber E.A. Armes L.G. Chen C.M. Fuchs J.A. Silver S. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7294-7299Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). To confirm that this pathway is conserved in B. subtilis, we performed in vitro experiments of the interaction between Trx and ArsC monitored by two-dimensional 15N-edited heteronuclear single quantum coherence spectroscopy (HSQC) spectra. Unlabeled re-Trx was added into the NMR sample of the 15N-labeled ox-ArsC, and the two-dimensional 15N-edited HSQC spectra showed that the conformation of ArsC switched from the oxidized form to the reduced form (13Guo X. Li Y. Peng K. Hu Y. Li C. Xia B. Jin C. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 39601-39608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). A similar experiment in which unlabeled ox-ArsC was added into 15N-labeled re-Trx showed that the reduction of ArsC was coupled to the oxidization of Trx (supplemental Fig. 1). In contrast, we performed titration experiments using unlabeled re-Trx and 15N-labeled re-ArsC. At a Trx:ArsC molar ratio of 1:1 or higher, the 15N-labeled ArsC showed spectra identical to that of the re-ArsC HSQC, indicating that there is no interaction between re-Trx and re-ArsC. These results demonstrate the in vitro interaction and thiol-disulfide exchange between re-Trx and ox-ArsC. In addition, we performed in vitro enzymatic assay by measuring the oxidation of NADPH (14Ji G. Garber E.A. Armes L.G. Chen C.M. Fuchs J.A. Silver S. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7294-7299Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) and confirmed that B. subtilis ArsC activity is also coupled to the NADPH-TrxR-Trx pathway. Solution Structure of the Trx-ArsC Complex—To fully characterize the interaction between Trx and ArsC, especially the conformational changes coupled to the redox reactions, we determined the solution structure of the B. subtilis Trx-ArsC mixed disulfide complex by NMR spectroscopy. The superimposed 20 lowest energy structures and the ribbon representation of the complex are shown in Fig. 1A. During the Trx-ArsC interaction, residue Cys29 of Trx acts as the nucleophilic attacker and forms an intermolecular disulfide bridge with Cys89 of ArsC. Because of the transient nature of the Trx-ArsC interaction, a stable Trx-ArsC complex with a mixed disulfide bond between Trx-Cys29 and ArsC-Cys89 was prepared using mutants Trx_C32S and ArsC_C10SC15AC82S following the 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) incubation procedures described by Messens et al. (15Messens J. Van Molle I. Vanhaesebrouck P. Limbourg M. Van Belle K. Wahni K. Martins J.C. Loris R. Wyns L. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 339: 527-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The structure of the complex is well determined based on both NOE-derived distance restraints and RDC restraints (Table 1). A total of 112 intermolecular NOE restraints were identified at the interface of the complex, and the relative orientation of the two proteins was determined by RDC measurements. The backbone root mean square deviation from mean structure is 0.6 ± 0.2 Å for the secondary structures of the whole complex and 0.23 ± 0.03 and 0.39 ± 0.07 Å for the individual Trx and ArsC molecules in the complex (designated as c-Trx and c-ArsC), respectively. The interaction between the two proteins buried a total of ∼1350 Å2 of solvent-accessible area (∼630 Å2 for Trx and 720 Å2 for ArsC), about 65% of which is contributed by nonpolar amino acid residues. The residues that are directly involved in the interaction (with unambiguous NOE peaks) include Ala26, Trp28, Val57, Asp58, Gln61, Ala64, Gly65, Val69–Ile72, and Val88 of c-Trx and residues Ile39, Ile67, Asn73, and Lys88–Pro94 of c-ArsC. Residues Lys88–Pro94, located in the extended loop of c-ArsC, are sandwiched between two walls formed by residues Trp28, Asp58, and Gly65–Ile72 in c-Trx. Residues Met70 and Ser71 of c-Trx fit into a groove formed by residues Ile67, Asn73, and Lys88–Pro94 of c-ArsC in a similar fashion (Fig. 1, B–D). The segment Lys88–Pro94 of ArsC interacts with the Trx active site in the anti-parallel orientation, similar to the human Trx-Ref-1 complex (20Qin J. Clore G.M. Kennedy W.P. Kuszewski J. Gronenborn A.M. Structure (Lond.). 1996; 4: 613-620Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), and mainly involves hydrophobic interactions. Notably, the side chains of residue Met91 in c-ArsC and Met70 in c-Trx are both inserted into the other subunit, which may contribute to the stabilization of the complex.TABLE 1Structural statistics of the Trx-ArsC complexComplexc-Trxc-ArsCNMR distance and dihedral restraints Distance restraints Total unambiguous NOE678233963386 Intra-residue259512611334 Inter-residue Sequential (|i—j| = 1)1681853828 Medium range (|i—j| < 4)1014497517 Long range (|i—j| > 5)1492785707 Intermolecular112 Total ambiguous NOE221511371078 Hydrogen bonds702842 Disulfide bonds100 Total dihedral angle restraints Phi1275671 Psi1325775 RDC restraints1547975Restraint violations Distance (>0.3 Å)3 Dihedral angle (>5°)0Energy Mean AMBER energy (kcal/mol)-12,545.51 ± 18.28 NOE distance restraints violation energy71.52 ± 2.76 Torsion angle restraints violation energy2.20 ± 0.49r.m.s.dar.m.s.d., root mean square deviation. from mean structure (Å) Heavy1.14 ± 0.160.68 ± 0.051.12 ± 0.13 Backbone0.80 ± 0.200.29 ± 0.040.67 ± 0.11 Secondary structure heavy0.98 ± 0.150.56 ± 0.050.94 ± 0.12 Secondary structure backbone0.65 ± 0.200.23 ± 0.030.39 ± 0.07Ramachandran statistics Residues in most favored regions (%)79.6 Residues in additional allowed regions (%)17.3 Residues in generously allowed regions (%)2.3 Residues in disallowed regions (%)0.8a r.m.s.d., root mean square deviation. Open table in a new tab Conformational Changes of Trx—The detailed descriptions of structures of re-Trx and ox-Trx can be found in the supplemental data and in Supplemental Fig. 2. The overall structures of re-Trx, ox-Trx, and c-Trx are similar, whereas subtle local conformational adjustments are observed in c-Trx (Fig. 2A and B). In particular, the short helix Gln61–Lys66 in c-Trx is slightly displaced from its original positions in the free forms. This local structural change orients the helix so that its C-terminal end is shifted toward the protein surface, which can be favorable for the interactions of residues Ala64 and Gly65 in c-Trx with ArsC. Furthermore, residue Val88 locates at the C-terminal end of the fifth β-strand in both re-Trx and ox-Trx, whereas in c-Trx it also moves away from its original position and interacts with ArsC. The conformational changes of the active site are not significant. However, the side chain of the active cysteine residue Cys29 appears to adjust its positions in different states (Fig. 2B). In c-Trx, the side chain of Cys29 moves slightly toward the protein surface to form the intermolecular disulfide bond as compared with re-Trx. After Trx switches to the oxidized form, the side chain of Cys29 moves back and further inward because of the formation of the intramolecular Cys29–Cys32 disulfide bond. Intermediate Conformation of c-ArsC—The overall structures of ArsC in free or complex states are similar, whereas the region from residue Thr80 to Glu99 shows an “intermediate” conformation in c-ArsC (Fig. 2, C and D). Particularly, segment Cys82–Cys89, which is involved in a helix to loop conformational transition between re-ArsC and ox-ArsC (13Guo X. Li Y. Peng K. Hu Y. Li C. Xia B. Jin C. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 39601-39608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), adopts an intermediate conformation in c-ArsC (Fig. 2D). The helical structure present in re-ArsC is not completely formed in the complex intermediate. However, the segment Cys82–Cys89 moves a considerable distance away from its position in the ox-ArsC and shows a high tendency to forming the helix. Most residues in this segment are located at intermediate positions between the reduced and oxidized forms, but some residues show conformations closer to the reduced form. The side chain position of Ser82 (mutated from Cys82) in c-ArsC is similar to Cys82 in re-ArsC, and the side chain of Lys88 in c-ArsC is also much closer to its position in re-ArsC than in ox-ArsC. Residue Cys89, however, locates at an intermediate position in the complex and points toward the protein surface to form the intermolecular disulfide bond with Cys29 of Trx. In contrast, the conformation of segment Pro90–Glu99 appears closer to ox-ArsC (Fig. 2D). This part is mostly extended in ox-ArsC structure, but it becomes mostly coiled and moves downward (as viewed in Fig. 2, C and D) in re-ArsC. In c-ArsC, the segment Pro90–Glu99 closely resembles the conformation of ox-ArsC (Fig. 2D). In addition, the segment Lys88–Val96 is closer to the short helix Ser69–Ile72 in re-ArsC than in ox-ArsC, whereas it is also located at an intermediate position in c-ArsC (Fig. 2C). Biological Implications—We have presented the solution structure of the Trx-ArsC complex from B. subtilis. In the complex structure, ArsC adopts an intermediate conformation compared with the reduced and oxidized forms, representing a structural transition from the oxidized form to the reduced form. Extensive interactions between ArsC and Trx were observed in the covalently linked complex. Specifically, a pair of methionine residues were observed to insert their side chains into the other subunit. Interestingly, the E. coli TrxR-Trx interaction involved the hydrophobic side chains of a pair of arginine residues similar to that of the methionine residues in the B. subtilis Trx-ArsC interaction (5Lennon B.W. Williams Jr., C.H. Ludwig M.L. Science. 2000; 289: 1190-1194Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar), which may represent a coevolution of the specific residues. In previous studies, a docking model of the S. aureus Trx-ArsC complex was proposed that placed the Cys82–Cys89 loop in the interacting surface (15Messens J. Van Molle I. Vanhaesebrouck P. Limbourg M. Van Belle K. Wahni K. Martins J.C. Loris R. Wyns L. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 339: 527-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Our solution structure of the B. subtilis Trx-ArsC complex, however, shows that the loop Cys82–Cys89 itself does not contribute much to the Trx-ArsC interaction. Instead, the neighboring segment, Lys88–Pro94, forms most of the intermolecular interaction with Trx. In addition, the crystal structures of the corresponding triple mutant ArsC_C10SC15AC82S of S. aureus and its 5-thio-2-nitrobenzoic acid adduct are also available (26Messens J. Van Molle I.

Both structures show a conformation similar to the reduced form of the wild type ArsC, with an intact helix between Cys82 and Cys89. Because the 5-thio-2-nitrobenzoic acid adduct of S. aureus ArsC_C10SC15AC82S is able to react with Trx, it appears that the reactivity of ArsC-Cys89 may play a major role in the reaction between ArsC and Trx. Previous studies have suggested that S. aureus re-Trx may be able to discriminate between the folds of the reduced and the oxidized ArsC and that it interacts only with the oxidized form (15Messens J. Van Molle I. Vanhaesebrouck P. Limbourg M. Van Belle K. Wahni K. Martins J.C. Loris R. Wyns L. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 339: 527-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Our results also showed that there is no interaction between the B. subtilis re-Trx and re-ArsC. Although the ability of Trx to discriminate ox-ArsC from re-ArsC based on conformational differences is still debatable, it is possible that the conformation of ox-ArsC may be preferable for interaction with Trx. In particular, the segment Lys88–Pro94 undergoes extensive conformational changes during the reaction processes, showing the most extended conformation in the oxidized state (Fig. 2, C and D). The structures of human Trx complexed with peptides of its substrates showed that the peptides adopt an extended conformation (19Qin J. Clore G.M. Kennedy W.P. Huth J.R. Gronenborn A.M. Structure (Lond.). 1995; 3: 289-297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 20Qin J. Clore G.M. Kennedy W.P. Kuszewski J. Gronenborn A.M. Structure (Lond.). 1996; 4: 613-620Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). It is reasonable to suggest that the extended conformation of segment Lys88–Pro94 in ox-ArsC may facilitate its recognition and interaction by Trx. Furthermore, in re-ArsC, the closer distance between loop Lys88–Val96 and helix Ser69–Ile72 appears to close the groove on ArsC surface. In ox-ArsC, the loop Lys88–Val96 moves away and opens up the groove, which may help to properly dock the interacting residues of both proteins into the surface grooves. It is very likely that both the reactivity of ArsC-Cys89 and the conformation of ox-ArsC work cooperatively to facilitate the thiol-disulfide exchange reaction between Trx and ArsC in vivo. Conclusions—We have presented the solution structure of the Trx-ArsC complex, the first protein-protein complex structure between the thioredoxin and arsenate reductase families reported thus far. The structure represents an intermediate conformation during the intermolecular thiol-disulfide exchange reaction that exists only transiently under natural conditions. Our structural investigations have demonstrated the changes in the conformational properties of the enzymes at different reaction stages, which probably contribute to the progression of the reaction. The Trx-ArsC-As(V) pathway involves a series of redox reactions, and our structural and biochemical studies of the Trx-ArsC complex and the free proteins establish a dynamic picture of the conformational fluctuations of both enzymes coupled to the reaction processes.

https://openalex.org/W2127914992,"Fidelity of DNA synthesis, catalyzed by DNA polymerases, is critical for the maintenance of the integrity of the genome. Mutant polymerases with elevated accuracy (antimutators) have been observed, but these mainly involve increased exonuclease proofreading or large decreases in polymerase activity. We have determined the tolerance of DNA polymerase for amino acid substitutions in the active site and in different segments of E. coli DNA polymerase I and have determined the effects of these substitutions on the fidelity of DNA synthesis. We established a DNA polymerase I mutant library, with random substitutions throughout the polymerase domain. This random library was first selected for activity. The essentiality of DNA polymerases and their sequence and structural conservation suggests that few amino acid substitutions would be tolerated. However, we report that two-thirds of single base substitutions were tolerated without loss of activity, and plasticity often occurs at evolutionarily conserved regions. We screened 408 members of the active library for alterations in fidelity of DNA synthesis in Escherichia coli expressing the mutant polymerases and carrying a second plasmid containing a β-lactamase reporter. Mutation frequencies varied from 1/1000- to 1000-fold greater compared with wild type. Mutations that produced an antimutator phenotype were distributed throughout the polymerase domain, with 12% clustered in the M-helix. We confirmed that a single mutation in this segment results in increased base discrimination. Thus, this work identifies the M-helix as a determinant of fidelity and suggests that polymerases can tolerate many substitutions that alter fidelity without incurring major changes in activity.

DNA polymerases function in DNA replication, repair, and recombination and are essential for maintaining the integrity of the genome. Multiple DNA polymerases have been found in prokaryotes, eukaryotes, and viruses and may have different properties, including variations in the accuracy, or fidelity, of DNA synthesis (1Bessman M.J.

Suthar A. Tai J. Yeung A. Truong C. Stewart J.L. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 1576-1584Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The majority of studied mutators harbor amino acid substitutions in well conserved polymerase motifs. Mutator polymerases have also been used extensively in biotechnological applications, such as DNA sequencing and error-prone PCR (20Tabor S. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6339-6343Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Far fewer antimutator enzymes have been identified due to the lack of selection methods. The ones identified thus far either exhibit substantially diminished catalytic activity or possess increased 3′-5′ exonuclease proofreading (21Muzyczka N. Poland R.L. Bessman M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 7116-7122Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Gillin F.D. Nossal N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 5225-5232Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Reha-Krantz L.J.

Recent efforts to identify antimutators in proofreading-deficient constructs through 96-well screening have focused only on 3 residues within Motif C and have produced antimutators with less than 10% of wild-type activity (24Summerer D. Rudinger N.Z. Detmer I. Marx A. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 2005; 44: 4712-4715Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). DNA polymerase I (Pol I) 4The abbreviation used is: Pol I, polymerase I.4The abbreviation used is: Pol I, polymerase I. is a high fidelity polymerase belonging to Family A, which includes Taq Pol I, T7 DNA polymerase, and human DNA polymerase γ, θ, and ν (6Rattray A.J. Strathern J.N. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2003; 37: 31-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 25Sharief F.S. Vojta P.J. Ropp P.A. Copeland W.C.

In this work, we identified determinants of Pol I fidelity that do not involve alterations in proofreading by the 3′-5′ exonuclease and that do not cripple the polymerase activity. This was attained by conducting a comprehensive analysis of amino acid substitutions in Pol I that result in antimutator or mutator activity. We focused on mutations that directly affect nucleotide selection at the incorporation step. We report on the spectrum of amino acid substitutions that both maintain activity and confer either antimutator or mutator phenotypes. Our results indicate that although the catalytic site is optimized for base selection without loss of activity, it is still feasible to create more accurate DNA polymerases without greatly reducing catalytic activity. Furthermore, many of the mutations that affect fidelity are distant from the active site. Escherichia coli strain JS200 (SC-18 recA718 polA12 uvrA155 trpE6 lon-11 sulA1) was first described as SC18-12. Creation of the plasmids pECpolI-3′exo- and pLA230 have been previously described (27Shinkai A. Patel P.H. Loeb L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18836-18842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 28Shinkai A. Loeb L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46759-46764Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Custom oligonucleotides and chemicals were purchased from IDT (Coralville, IA) and Sigma unless otherwise specified. Creation of a Pol I Mutant Library—The E. coli polA gene encoded in plasmid pECpolI-3′exo- was mutated to introduce a PstI restriction site at nucleotide 1493. The polymerase domain was amplified from this plasmid using the primers GGACGTTACGCTGCAGAAG and CGACGGCCAGTGAATTCTTAG according to the error-prone PCR GeneMorph II kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), which includes error-prone Taq Pol I mutant 53 (29Patel P.J. Kawate H. Adman E. Ashbach M. Loeb L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5044-5051Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The PCR product was gel-purified (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), cut using PstI and EcoRI (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA), and ligated into a pECpolI-3′exo- dummy vector. The dummy vector had Pol I nucleotides 2219-2646 deleted, resulting in an inactive polymerase. The ligated plasmids were transformed into TOP10 cells (Invitrogen). Library size was calculated by counting a fraction of the surviving transformants. Selection of Active Pol I Mutants—The library was transformed into JS200 cells, which were then plated on 2XYT agar and grown overnight at 37 °C. Surviving colonies were inoculated into LB and grown at 30 °C. Individual plasmids from both the unselected and selected library were recovered and sequenced. Analysis of the library mutation spectrum was performed on Phred-Phrap software (30Guo H.H. Choe J. Loeb L.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 9205-9210Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 31Ewing B. Hillier L. Wendl M.C. Green P. Genome Res. 1998; 8: 175-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (4827) Google Scholar). The index of substitutability at each position was calculated as the percentage of clones containing a mutation at that residue divided by the total number of clones sequenced. Comparison of Evolutionary Conservation Index with Substitutability Index—An index of evolutionary conservation (Fig. 2B) was calculated based on an alignment of the E. coli polymerase domain with orthologues from 30 members of Family A, including representatives from bacteria (E. coli, Yersina pestis, Vibrio cholera, H. influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bordetella pertussis, Neisseria meningitidis, Nostoc7120, Taq, Deinococcus radians, Bst, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Clostridium tetani, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Chlamydia trachomatis, and Helicobacter pylori), phage (T5, T7, and Spo1), and eukaryotes (Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, Homo sapiens DNA polymerase γ and θ, Mus musculus, Drosophila melanogaster, Leishmania major, Plasmodium falciparum, Arabidopsis thaliana, and Trypanosoma brucei) (32Ciccarelli F.D.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 787-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). The DNA polymerases analyzed were DNA polymerase I (bacteria) or DNA polymeraseγ (eukaryotes) unless otherwise noted. DNA polymeraseγ sequences were included to further differentiate residues that are absolutely required for catalytic activity. Sequences were obtained from Pubmed (available on the World Wide Web at www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) and aligned with ClustalW version 1.83 (available on the World Wide Web at www.ebi.ac.uk/clustalw/). Screen for Mutations in Pol I That Alter Fidelity of DNA Synthesis—Plasmid pECpolI was recovered from active clones and transformed into fresh JS200. After recovery, cells were transformed with the second plasmid pLA230 and grown in LB to an A600 of 2.0 at 30 °C. The culture was then inoculated to a final dilution of 5 × 10-6 into 1 ml of 2XYT containing chloramphenicol (30 μg/ml) and kanamycin (50 μg/ml). Cultures were then grown with aeration for 20 h at 37 °C and plated on LB agar containing either chloramphenicol and carbenicillin (100 μg/ml) or chloramphenicol and kanamycin at a dilution sufficient for 100-500 colonies per plate. Several controls were included: wild type sequences, D424A,I709N, and D424A, I709N,A759R (34Camps M. Naukkarinen J. Johnson B.P. Loeb L.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 9727-9732Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Assays were performed in duplicate. Assay for Pol I Polymerase Activity—JS200 cells containing pECpolI mutants were grown in LB at 30 °C with 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to induce protein expression. Cells were grown to an A600 of 2.0, at which time a 1.5-ml aliquot was pelleted, washed with 1 ml of 20 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.2), and resuspended in 0.1 ml of the same buffer. Cells were lysed with 5 μl of lysozyme (10 mg/ml) and disrupted by freezing (-80 °C) and thawing. The cell extract was collected by centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 15 min. The polymerase activity of the supernatant was assayed for ability to incorporate radioactive dTMP into activated calf thymus DNA at 37 °C as previously described (35Glick E. Anderson J.P. Loeb L.A. BioTechniques. 2002; 33: 1136-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Assays were performed in triplicate. The background polymerase activity of the cell, measured from cells grown with an empty plasmid vector, was subtracted from all measurements. Protein Purification—Mutant and wild-type Klenow fragments, encompassing the 3′-5′ exonuclease domain and the polymerase domain, were subcloned into the pLEX vector (Invitrogen), expressed, and purified as previously described (27Shinkai A. Patel P.H. Loeb L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18836-18842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). This Pol I construct included a six-histidine N terminus tag. In brief, the pLEX expression plasmid was introduced into E. coli GI724 (F2, l2, lacIq, lacPL8, ampC::Ptrp cI, mcrA, mcrB, INV(rnnd-rnnE)), and cells were grown at 30 °C in 500 ml of induction medium composed of M9 salts, 0.2% casamino acids, 0.5% glucose, 1 mm MgCl2, and 100 mg/ml carbenicillin. When the cultures reached an A600 of 0.5, tryptophan was added to a final concentration of 100 μg/ml, and the culture was incubated at 37 °C for 4 h. The cells were collected by centrifugation, washed with 40 ml of binding buffer (5 mm imidazole, 0.5 m NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9), and suspended in 4 ml of the same buffer containing 200 μg/ml lysozyme and 0.04 ml Protease Inhibitor Mixture III (Calbiochem). Extracts were prepared by freezing/thawing on ice for 2 h, followed by centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 15 min, and loaded onto a 4-ml nickel-resin column (Novagen, San Diego, CA). The column was washed with 80 ml of wash buffer (15 mm imidazole, 0.5 m NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9) and serially with 8 ml of high imidazole wash buffer (30, 60, 120, and 200 mm imidazole, 0.5 m NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9) and eluted with 8 ml of 400 mm imidazole, 0.5 m NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9. The eluted sample was mixed with 2.5 ml of 80% glycerol and 12.5 μl of 1 m dithiothreitol and stored at 80 °C. Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Bradford. To assay the polymerase and 3′-5′ exonuclease activity, a DNA duplex with a 5′ overhang (template strand) was prepared using a template oligonucleotide, CCCGGGAAATTTCCGGAATTCGATATTGCTAGCGGGAATTCGGCGCG, and the primer oligonucleotide CGCGCCGAATTCCCGCTAGCAATAG, the latter of which was 32P-radiolabeled at the 5′ terminus. The purified enzyme (40 fmol) was incubated with the DNA duplex (20 fmol) in 10 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm KCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol at 37 °C for 30 min. Klenow 3′-5′ exonuclease-proficient enzyme (4 fmol) was used as a control. Reactions were terminated with 20 μl of 98% formamide, 10 mm EDTA; 5 μl of each product was analyzed by electrophoresis through 14% denaturing acrylamide electrophoresis and quantified by phosphorimaging analysis. M13 Gapped Assay—We characterized the DNA synthesis fidelity of purified mutant and wild-type polymerase in vitro on the M13 gapped forward mutation assay, as previously described (36Bebenek K. Kunkel T.A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 217-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Gap fill-in reactions occurred in 10 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm KCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol at 37 °C with all four dNTPs at 50 μm each. The complete fill-in of the M13 gapped substrate was monitored by gel (data not shown) and by the consistency of mutation rates after incubation with increased amounts of the DNA polymerase. To explore the protein sequence space of Pol I, we generated a random mutation library of the polA gene using error-prone PCR. Because we wanted to focus on mutations in the polymerase domain, nucleotides at positions 1493-2784 that encode the polymerase catalytic domain were randomly substituted, and the 3′-5′ exonuclease proofreading activity was inactivated by a D424A substitution (27Shinkai A. Patel P.H. Loeb L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18836-18842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 37Derbyshire V. Freemont P.S. Sanderson M.R. Beese L. Friedman J.M. Joyce C.M. Steitz T.A. Science. 1988; 240: 199-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). For simplicity, mutants henceforth will only be named by their polymerase domain genotype. For example, the D424A mutant is referred to as “wild type,” whereas the double mutant D424A,I709N is referred to as only I709N. A library of greater than 1.0 × 104 mutants was established, with a mean amino acid substitution of 4.2 per gene (polymerase domain only). To select for active mutants, the library was transfected into JS200 E. coli cells, which contain a temperature-sensitive allele of Pol I; growth at the restrictive temperature requires complementation with a plasmid-borne active Pol I (27Shinkai A. Patel P.H. Loeb L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18836-18842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 38Witkin E.M. Roegner M.V. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 4166-4168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Approximately 10% of the original library formed colonies at the restrictive temperature. From the surviving population, 592 individual clones were sequenced to reveal a spectrum of tolerable substitutions across the polymerase domain (Fig. 1). A mean of 2.8 amino acid mutations were present in the active clones. Across the entire polymerase domain, the probability (30Guo H.H. Choe J. Loeb L.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 9205-9210Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar) that a single random amino acid substitution will inactivate the enzyme is 34 ± 2% (mean ± S.E.). To compare the tolerance to substitutions at different amino acid positions, an index of substitutability was calculated based on the percentage of active clones that harbored a mutation at that residue (30Guo H.H. Choe J. Loeb L.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 9205-9210Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). These indices were consistent with the prediction that the active site of the polymerase, located in the interior-facing surfaces of the enzyme, harbors the most highly conserved residues, whereas residues located on the outer surfaces and lacking direct contact with the reaction substrates more readily tolerate substitutions (Fig. 2A and Table 1). To quantify how well these results match the amino acid conservation among Family A DNA polymerases, we compiled a protein sequence alignment of 30 Family A DNA polymerase species (17 prokaryotic, 10 eukaryotic, and 3 viral) and calculated indices for evolutionary conservation at each position (Fig. 2B). By comparing the substitutability of different amino acid residues in Pol I with the evolutionary conservation among Family A polymerases, we were able to identify regions of discrepancy between the functional and evolutionary conservation (Fig. 2B). Residues where the functional tolerance is at least 35% greater than the evolutionary conservation include 516, 656, 720, 723, 726, 738, 757, and 802.TABLE 1Mean substitutability indices of Pol I regionsSubstitutability inside region (mean ± S.E.)Substitutability outside region (mean ± S.E.)t test (p value)%%Entire protein0.68 ± 0.03Evolutionarily conserved (Motifs A, B, and C)0.31 ± 0.070.71 ± 0.052.4E-05Family A conserved (Motifs A, B, C, 1, 2, and 6)0.37 ± 0.040.76 ± 0.053.9E-08Helices0.74 ± 0.050.62 ± 0.030.16β strands0.61 ± 0.090.69 ± 0.030.46Hinges0.48 ± 0.100.70 ± 0.040.054 Open table in a new tab To assess the accuracy of the mutant polymerase enzymes, we screened 408 clones from our active library for their polymerase fidelity using a second plasmid pLA230 as a reporter (28Shinkai A. Loeb L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46759-46764Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). This reporter contains an opal (TAA) codon at the N terminus of the β-lactamase protein, which terminates its translation. Errors that are produced in this codon during the Pol I-catalyzed replication of pLA230 render the bacteria resistant to the antibiotic carbenicillin. The reversion frequency has been shown to be inversely related to the in vitro fidelity of the Pol I enzyme (28Shinkai A. Loeb L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46759-46764Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The reversion frequency for cells expressing the wild-type Pol I was 8.9 ± 1.9 × 10-7 (mean ± S.E.). Clones with a reversion frequency at least 10-fold below or above wild-type were classified as antimutators and mutators, respectively (Fig. 3). The lowest and highest reversion frequency were ∼1/1000- and 1000-fold that of wild type. Approximately 12% (51Loh E. Loeb L.A. DNA Repair (Amst.). 2005; 4: 1390-1398Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) of the clones were antimutators, whereas only 2.4% (10Trifunovic A. Wredenberg A. Falkenberg M. Spelbrink J.N. Rovio A.T. Bruder C.E. Bohlooly Y.M. Gidlof S. Oldfors A. Wibom R. Tornell J. Jacobs H.T. Larsson N.G. Nature. 2004; 429: 417-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (1957) Google Scholar) were mutators. To determine the catalytic activity of the same 408 clones, we measured their capacity to incorporate radiolabeled dTMP into activated calf thymus DNA in vitro (35Glick E. Anderson J.P. Loeb L.A. BioTechniques. 2002; 33: 1136-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The activity of the polymerases varied greatly (Fig. 3), ranging from 15 to 125% of that of clones expressing similar amounts of wild-type enzyme as determined by Western blots. The only clones with activity greater than wild-type were mutators. Both mutators and antimutators were obtained without significant diminution in catalytic activity. To verify that the results of our reversion and polymerase activity assays were internally valid, we included three wild-type controls that had nucleotide substitutions that did not change the encoded amino acid sequence. In addition, two previously characterized extreme mutators, I709N and the double mutant I709N,A759R, were included (28Shinkai A. Loeb L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46759-46764Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 34Camps M. Naukkarinen J. Johnson B.P. Loeb L.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 9727-9732Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Their reversion frequencies are ∼200- and 1700-fold, respectively, above wild-type, consistent with prior studies. In order to confirm that the enhanced fidelity of DNA synthesis measured in vivo reflects a greater accuracy by the DNA polymerase, we purified the polymerase from a mutant, K601I,A726V, that exhibited a 10-fold enhanced accuracy without a significant reduction in activity. First, both the mutant and a wild-type control were cloned into the pLEX vector and expressed with a six-histidine N terminus tag. After chromatography on a nickel column, both the purified mutant polymerase and the wild-type control polymerase were tested for 3′-5′ exonuclease activity to ensure that the mutant did not exhibit any proofreading (Fig. 4). The polymerases were incubated with double-stranded DNA with a mismatched G:A (primer-template) at the 3′-primer terminus. Less than 0.001% of the terminal nucleotides were hydrolyzed in 30 min at 37 °C in a reaction containing a 4 nm concentration of the mutant or wild-type DNA polymerase and 2 nm DNA. 3′-5′ exonuclease activity was also absent when the polymerases were incubated with double-stranded DNA with a matched A:T at the 3′-primer terminus (data not shown). The fidelity of the mutant protein and of the wild type were then measured in vitro using an M13 gapped forward mutation assay (36Bebenek K. Kunkel T.A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 217-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar), in which the enzymes catalyze the incorporation of four dNTPs into gapped M13 circular DNA. The complete fill-in of the M13 gapped substrate was monitored by gel (data not shown) and by the consistency of mutation rates after incubation with increased amounts of the DNA polymerase. A 5-fold increase in the amount of enzyme used for fill-in did not alter the mutation frequency significantly. In two separate experiments, the frequency of mutations in the gapped segment of M13 DNA was 3.1- and 2.6-fold less in reactions catalyzed by K601I,A726V than in reactions catalyzed by the wild-type polymerase (Table 2). 68 and 82% of the mutations were single base substitutions with the wild-type and mutant polymerase, respectively. The largest reduction in error rate, 10-fold, occurred with A to C transversions (Table 3). The mutant exhibited reduced mutation rates for 10 of the possible 12 misinserted bases. Mutation rates for the remaining two, A to G transitions and C to A transversions, were increased less than 2-fold. Many of the error rates for the wild-type Klenow control were comparable with those that have been previously published (13Bebenek K. Joyce C.M. Fitzgerald M.P. Kunkel T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13878-13887Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).TABLE 2Forward mutation rate of K601I,A726V mutant relative to wild typeDNA polymerasePlaques scoredMutant frequencyRelative mutation rateTotalMutantWild type13,326780.004611.0017,301900.004191.00K601I,A726V32,512890.001500.3226,722710.001640.39 Open table in a new tab TABLE 3Error spectrum of purified mutant K601I,A726V and wild-type Klenow DNA polymerasesChangeMispairWild type (Klenow 3′exo)K601I,A726V (Klenow 3′exo-)A → GA·dCTP1/230,0001/150,000A → CA·dGTP1/93,000≤1/980,000A → TA·dATP1/340,0001/890,000G → AG·dTTP1/340,0001/890,000G → CG·dGTP1/29,0001/53,000G → TG·dATP1/26,0001/100,000C → AC·dTTP≤1/420,0001/400,000C → GC·dCTP1/130,0001/360,000C → TC·dATP1/23,0001/46,000T → AT·dTTP1/250,000≤1/890,000T → GT·dCTP1/360,0001/530,000T → CT·dGTP1/53,0001/110,000 Open table in a new tab The mapping of mutations present in each antimutator and mutator revealed regions where mutations were more frequent.

To this end, myristoylated peptides representing the Gα13 SRI (Myr-G13SRIpep) and its random counterpart were evaluated for their effects on PAR1 activation. Initial studies demonstrated that Myr-G13SRIpep and Myr-G13SRIRandom-pep were equally taken up by human platelets and did not interfere with PAR1-ligand interaction. Subsequent experiments revealed that Myr-G13SRIpep specifically bound to platelet RhoA guanine nucleotide exchange factor (p115RhoGEF) and blocked PAR1-mediated RhoA activation in platelets and human embryonic kidney cells. These results suggest a direct interaction of Gα13 SRI with p115RhoGEF and a mechanism for Myr-G13SRIpep inhibition of RhoA activation. Platelet function studies demonstrated that Myr-G13SRIpep specifically inhibited PAR1-stimulated shape change, aggregation, and secretion in a dose-dependent manner but did not inhibit platelet activation induced by either ADP or A23187. It was also found that Myr-G13SRIpep inhibited low dose, but not high dose, thrombin-induced aggregation. Additional experiments showed that PAR1-mediated calcium mobilization was partially blocked by Myr-G13SRIpep but not by the Rho kinase inhibitor Y-27632. Finally, Myr-G13SRIpep effectively inhibited PAR1-induced stress fiber formation and cell contraction in endothelial cells. Collectively, these results suggest the following: 1) interaction of Gα13 SRI with p115RhoGEF is required for G13-mediated RhoA activation in platelets; 2) signaling through the G13 pathway is critical for PAR1-mediated human platelet functional changes and low dose thrombin-induced aggregation; and 3) G13 signaling elicits calcium mobilization in human platelets through a Rho kinase-independent mechanism.

Thrombin and thrombin receptors in platelets play critical roles in heart attack, stroke, and thromboembolic processes (reviewed in Ref. 1Hollenberg M.D. Compton S.J. Pharmacol. Rev. 2002; 54: 203-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). Consequently, investigating the mechanisms of thrombin receptor-mediated signaling pathways is of great importance to developing therapeutic approaches or anti-thrombotic agents (2Brass L.F. Chest. 2003; 124: S18-S25Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar) to treat certain cardiovascular diseases.The first thrombin receptor was cloned and sequenced by Coughlin and co-workers in 1991 (3Vu T.K. Hung D.T. Wheaton V.I. Coughlin S.R. Cell. 1991; 64: 1057-1068Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2650) Google Scholar). It was found that this receptor is a member of the seven-transmembrane receptor class that signals through different G proteins. Thrombin acts by first cleaving the extracellular N-terminal domain of the receptor, and the new N terminus (SFLLRN) then binds to the second extracellular loop of the receptor protein to cause cellular activation (3Vu T.K. Hung D.T. Wheaton V.I. Coughlin S.R. Cell. 1991; 64: 1057-1068Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2650) Google Scholar). To date, four protease-activated receptors (PARs), 2The abbreviations used are: PAR, protease-activated receptor; SRI, switch region I; PRP, platelet-rich plasma; PGI2, prostaglandin I2; TMB, tetramethylbenzidine; BSA, bovine serum albumin; HRP, horseradish peroxidase; HEK, human embryonic kidney; MALDI-TOFMS, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometric analysis; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; GPCR, G protein-coupled receptor; Ab, antibody; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; Myr, myristoylated; Bio, biotinylated; TRAP, thrombin receptor agonist peptide.2The abbreviations used are: PAR, protease-activated receptor; SRI, switch region I; PRP, platelet-rich plasma; PGI2, prostaglandin I2; TMB, tetramethylbenzidine; BSA, bovine serum albumin; HRP, horseradish peroxidase; HEK, human embryonic kidney; MALDI-TOFMS, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometric analysis; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; GPCR, G protein-coupled receptor; Ab, antibody; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; Myr, myristoylated; Bio, biotinylated; TRAP, thrombin receptor agonist peptide. i.e. PAR1, PAR2, PAR3, and PAR4, have been cloned, all of which except for PAR2 are identified as receptors for thrombin (4Coughlin S.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11023-11027Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). Regarding platelets, there is a species-specific expression of the PAR subtypes. For example, PAR3 and PAR4 (but not PAR1) are expressed in mouse platelets. The functional significance of these receptors was demonstrated by the finding that knock-out of either PAR3 or PAR4 led to impaired thrombin-induced platelet activation (5Hamilton J.R. Cornelissen I. Coughlin S.R. J. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2004; 2: 1538-7933Crossref Scopus (81) Google Scholar). In contrast to mouse, human platelets possess PAR1 and PAR 4 but not PAR 3 receptors. Therefore, in this case, the combination of PAR1 and PAR4 signaling pathways is thought to account for a substantial portion of thrombin-mediated platelet activation (6Kahn M.L. Nakanishi-Matsui M. Shapiro M.J. Ishihara H. Coughlin S.R. J. Clin. Investig. 1999; 103: 879-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar).As mentioned previously, PAR signaling pathways involve G protein-initiated effector activation. Furthermore, PARs are thought to couple to different G proteins depending upon the cell type. Our present understanding of PAR-G protein signaling in platelets is primarily based on the collective information obtained from experimental approaches in two separate species, i.e. mouse and human. Specifically, Offermanns et al. (7Offermanns S. Toombs C.F. Hu Y.H. Simon M.I. Nature. 1997; 389: 183-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar) evaluated the potential role of PAR-Gq signaling using Gq knock-out mice. The results using these mice demonstrated a complete inhibition of thrombin-induced platelet aggregation but not shape change (7Offermanns S. Toombs C.F. Hu Y.H. Simon M.I. Nature. 1997; 389: 183-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). Further studies indicated that PARs may also be coupled to Gi (8Klages B. Brandt U. Simon M.I. Schultz G. Offermanns S. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 745-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar), because thrombin caused a decrease in cAMP levels in the wild-type as well as in the Gq null mice platelets. As an extension of this work, the effects of a conditional G13 knock-out on mouse platelet function were also evaluated (9Moers A. Nieswandt B. Massberg S. Wettschureck N. Gruner S. Konrad I. Schulte V. Aktas B. Gratacap M.P. Simon M.I. Gawaz M. Offermanns S. Nat. Med. 2003; 9: 1418-1422Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). It was found that the G13 null platelets exhibited diminished thrombin-induced platelet shape change, aggregation, and RhoA activation at low thrombin concentrations but appeared to have a normal thrombin response at higher thrombin concentrations (9Moers A. Nieswandt B. Massberg S. Wettschureck N. Gruner S. Konrad I. Schulte V. Aktas B. Gratacap M.P. Simon M.I. Gawaz M. Offermanns S. Nat. Med. 2003; 9: 1418-1422Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Furthermore, knock-out of both Gq and G13 resulted in a complete unresponsiveness of platelets to thrombin (10Moers A. Wettschureck N. Gruner S. Nieswandt B. Offermanns S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 45354-45359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Therefore, taken together these results suggest that Gq,G13, and possibly Gi play important roles in the intracellular signaling pathway of thrombin receptor activation in mouse platelets.However, the results in mice cannot necessarily be extrapolated to human platelet activation, because different PAR profiles are found in each case. Regarding human platelets, initial in vitro experiments indicated that thrombin could stimulate both Gαq/11 and Gα12/13 phosphorylation in human platelet membranes, suggesting that these two G protein families may functionally couple to PARs (11Covic L. Gresser A.L. Kuliopulos A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 5458-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Support for a Gq-mediated pathway for both PAR1 and PAR4 receptors in human platelets was provided by studies using PAR-specific peptides. The results indicated that although both PAR1 and PAR4 receptor activation caused an increase in intraplatelet calcium levels, the kinetics of this calcium mobilization appeared to be different for each receptor type (11Covic L. Gresser A.L. Kuliopulos A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 5458-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). In a subsequent study employing human platelets deficient in Gαq and PLC-β2 (12Vaidyula V.R. Rao A.K. Br. J. Haematol. 2003; 121: 491-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), it was found that the PAR1 and PAR4-induced calcium responses were reduced relative to normal platelets (12Vaidyula V.R. Rao A.K. Br. J. Haematol. 2003; 121: 491-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Consequently, it appears that both PAR1 and PAR4 have the capacity to signal through Gq and elicit calcium mobilization in human platelets.Other reports have provided indirect evidence linking the human G12/13 signaling pathway to PAR1-mediated platelet function (13Rasmussen U.B. Gachet C. Schlesinger Y. Hanau D. Ohlmann P. Obberghen-Schilling E. Pouyssegur J. Cazenave J.P. Pavirani A. J. Biol.

Thus, it was found that selective activation of PAR1 with the peptide YFLLRNP resulted in platelet shape change (13Rasmussen U.B. Gachet C. Schlesinger Y. Hanau D. Ohlmann P. Obberghen-Schilling E. Pouyssegur J. Cazenave J.P. Pavirani A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14322-14328Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that could be blocked by the Rho kinase inhibitor Y-27632 (14Dorsam R.T.

Aepfelbacher M. Watson S.P. Siess W. Blood. 1999; 94: 1665-1672Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because RhoA activation has been linked previously to G13 signaling (8Klages B. Brandt U. Simon M.I. Schultz G. Offermanns S. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 745-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar, 17Paul B.Z. Daniel J.L. Kunapuli S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28293-28300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), these results led the authors to suggest that this shape change response is mediated through the G12/13 signaling pathway (14Dorsam R.T. Kim S. Jin J. Kunapuli S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 47588-47595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). It was also reported that in the presence of Gi activation, selective stimulation of G12/13 signaling by low doses of agonists resulted in platelet aggregation and αIIbβ3 integrin activation (14Dorsam R.T. Kim S. Jin J. Kunapuli S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 47588-47595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 18Nieswandt B. Schulte V. Zywietz A. Gratacap M.P. Offermanns S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 39493-39498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). These findings were interpreted as evidence that PAR1-mediated G12/13 signaling can contribute to human platelet aggregation if Gi signaling is simultaneously activated. Although recent evidence suggests that human PARs may not directly signal through Gi, such Gi signaling would presumably occur as a consequence of PAR-mediated ADP secretion (19Kim S. Foster C. Lecchi A. Quinton T.M. Prosser D.M. Jin J. Cattaneo M. Kunapuli S.P. Blood. 2002; 99: 3629-3636Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar).These data therefore suggest that human platelet PAR1 primarily signals through Gq and G12/13. Despite these findings, however, the relative contribution of each specific G protein to the overall PAR1-mediated signaling process in human platelets remains unclear, and the requirement for G12/13 signaling in this response is presently unknown. In this study we report the use of a myristoylated peptide representing the SRI of Gα13 (Myr-G13SRIpep) to study PAR1-mediated G13 signaling and function in intact human platelets. Our results provide evidence that PAR1-induced RhoA activation involves the interaction of Gα13 SRI with p115RhoGEF. Platelet functional experiments revealed that Gα13 SRI signaling is required for PAR1-induced functional change in both human platelets and human endothelial cells. Finally, the results identify a Rho kinase-independent G13 signaling pathway involving the mobilization of intraplatelet calcium. Taken together, these data indicate that signaling of Gα13 through SRI is critical for PAR1-induced cellular activation.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESReagents—Myristoylated (Myr) Gα13 SRI peptide (Myr-LLARRPTKGIHEY, Myr-G13SRIpep) and Myr-Gα13SRI random peptide (Myr-LIRPYLHRATKEG, Myr-G13SRIRandom-pep) were synthesized by GenScript Corp.

Human platelet-rich plasma (PRP, anticoagulated with acid/citrate/dextrose, 2–3 × 108 platelets/ml) were purchased from Life Source Blood Services (Glenview, IL), and outdated platelets were kindly provided by the Hospital Blood Bank, University of Illinois, Chicago.Platelet Membrane Preparation and Solubilization—Solubilized platelet membranes were prepared as described previously (20Manganello J.M. Djellas Y. Borg C. Antonakis K. Le Breton G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28003-28010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Briefly, outdated human platelets were incubated with 3 mm aspirin for 45 min and pelleted by centrifugation at 1,600 × g for 20 min. The platelet pellets were washed with buffer A (25 mm Tris-HCl, 5 mm MgCl2, pH 7.4) containing PGI2 (40 nm), sonicated on ice, and centrifuged at 1,600 × g for 5 min. The supernatant was placed into centrifuge tubes, and the pellets were again resuspended, sonicated, and centrifuged. The supernatants were then combined and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min. The pellet was resuspended in buffer A plus 10 mm CHAPS, homogenized, and centrifuged again at 100,000 × g for 30 min. The resulting membrane pellet was resuspended in buffer A to yield a final protein concentration of 2–4 mg/ml.Purification of Recombinant p115—Full-length p115RhoGEF cDNA was ligated into BamHI, XhoI sites of pFastBacHTc vector with hexahistidine tag at the N terminus.

Recombinant p115 protein was purified from the cytosolic fractions of infected cells using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity column with the yield of 0.5 mg from 500 ml of Sf9 cell culture. The protein was ∼90% pure by SDS-PAGE visualization.Dot Blot for Myristoylated Peptides—Human PRP was incubated with 100 μm biotinylated Myr peptides or free biotinylation reagent (as a secondary control) for 5 min. The platelets were then washed three times by centrifugation in Tyrode's buffer containing PGI2 (40 nm), disrupted with lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl containing 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 50 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml each of leupeptin and pepstatin, and 0.2% Nonidet P-40, pH 7.5), and sonicated on ice (three 45-s bursts with 15-s pauses). The platelet samples were next loaded on methanol-pretreated polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, blocked by 5% nonfat dry milk, and incubated with HRP-conjugated goat anti-biotin Ab at room temperature for 1 h. After incubation, the membranes were washed three times with Tyrode's buffer and subsequently incubated with HRP substrates. The film was then developed and fixed.Matrix-assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometric Analysis (MALDI-TOFMS)—MALDI-TOFMS analysis was performed as described previously (21Lee B.S. Krishnanchettiar S. Lateef S.S. Gupta S. Rapid Commun. Mass Spectrom. 2005; 19: 1545-1550Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Specifically, human PRP was incubated with 500 μm Myr-G13SRIpep or Myr-G13SRIRandom-pep for 5 min at room temperature. Following incubation, the platelets were washed three times with Tyrode's buffer containing PGI2 (40 nm) and disrupted with lysis buffer and sonicated as described above. The platelet samples were then mixed 1:1 with the matrix solution (10 mg of cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid in 1 ml of aqueous solution of 50% acetonitrile containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid). Finally, the sample aliquots were spotted onto a MALDI-TOF target and analyzed at 1,764 daltons using a Voyager-DE PRO mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems) equipped with a 337 nm pulsed nitrogen laser.3H-TRAP1 Binding to Intact Human Platelets—To ensure that the association of 3H-TRAP1 with platelets was not because of uptake of the ligand, displacement studies were employed to measure the extent of the specific binding. In these studies, PRP was initially incubated with 500 μm Myr-G13SRIpep or Myr-G13SRIRandom-pep for 5 min at room temperature. At this point, 40 nm 3H-TRAP1 was added, and the reaction mixture was incubated at 4 °C for 10 min. The reaction was then supplemented with 40 μm unlabeled TRAP1 (to determine specific binding) and incubated for an additional 10 min. Aliquots (1 ml) of the PRP were immediately layered over a silicon oil mixture (75 μl; 81% Dow 550; 19% Dow 200) in a centrifuge tube and centrifuged at 7,000 × g for 1 min to separate the platelets from their plasma (22Feinstein M.B. Michel I. Born G.V.R. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1974; 84: 926-934Google Scholar, 23Kattelman E.J. Venton D.L. Le Breton G.C. Thromb. Res. 1986; 41: 471-481Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The supernatant was quickly removed by aspiration, and the tube tips containing the platelet pellets were cut and transferred to scintillation vials. One ml of 0.3 n NaOH was added to solubilize the platelets, and 100 μl of 3 n HCl were added to neutralize the reaction mixture. Finally, 10 ml of scintillation fluid were added, and the solution was counted on a Beckman LS 6500 liquid scintillation counter. Under these conditions, specific binding of 3H-TRAP1 was ∼33%.Pulldown Assay for GTP-Rho—RhoA activation was determined as described previously with slight modifications (24Manganello J.M. Huang J.S. Kozasa T. Voyno-Yasenetskaya T.A. Le Breton G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 124-130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Briefly, 400 μl of PRP were incubated with 500 μm Myr-G13SRIpep, 500 μm Myr-G13SRIRandom-pep, or Me2SO vehicle at room temperature for 5 min and then treated with 25 μm PAR1 agonist (TRAP1) for 1 min. One volume of cold lysis buffer was added, and the samples were incubated on ice for 10 min. The platelet lysates were then centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 1 min, and the supernatant was incubated (4 °C for 1 h) with 20 μg of glutathione S-transferase-Rho binding domain fusion protein-conjugated beads. The beads were washed three times with lysis buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE. Activated RhoA was detected by Western blot analysis using a polyclonal antibody against RhoA. In separate experiments, 400 μl of HEK cells were incubated with 500 μm Myr-G13SRIpep, 500 μm Myr-G13SRIRandom-pep, or Me2SO vehicle at room temperature for 15 min and then treated with 50 μm TRAP1 for 1 min. After centrifugation, 400 μl of cold lysis buffer was added, and the sample was sonicated on ice. The cell lysates were then centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 1 min, and the supernatant was subjected to the same procedure as described above.Measurement of p115 RhoGEF Binding to G13SRIpep—The design of this experiment was to coat Nunc-Immuno plate wells with G13SRIpep or G13SRIRandom-pep and to measure whether either peptide could capture p115RhoGEF from solubilized human platelets using a sandwich ELISA. However, to establish that equal amounts of G13SRIpep and G13SRIRandom-pep were immobilized to the wells, the following experiment was first conducted. In brief, the wells were coated with various concentrations (0.1 nm to 400 μm) of biotinylated G13SRIpep or biotinylated G13 SRIRandom-pep at 4 °C overnight. The wells were then washed three times with TBS buffer containing 0.03% Tween 20 and blocked with 3% BSA in TBS-Tween buffer. Following incubation at room temperature for 1 h with avidin-HRP, the wells were washed seven times with TBS-Tween buffer, and the TMB substrates were added. When the appropriate color appeared, 50 μl of 1 n HCl were added to stop the reaction, and the absorbance (A) at 450 nm was measured in each sample. A comparison of the A450 values revealed that 0.23 μm G13SRIpep and 12.5 μm G13SRIRandom-pep resulted in equal coating of the wells (Fig. 5A).In the sandwich ELISA experiments, the Nunc-Immuno plate wells were equally coated with either G13SRIpep or G13SRIRandom-pep and blocked as outlined above. After washing three times with TBS-Tween buffer, 100 μg of solubilized platelet membrane protein (20Manganello J.M. Djellas Y. Borg C. Antonakis K. Le Breton G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28003-28010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) were added, and the samples were incubated at room temperature for 2 h. The wells were then supplemented with p115RhoGEF Ab and incubated at room temperature for an additional 1 h. After three washes with TBS-Tween buffer, the HRP-linked secondary Ab was added, and the reaction was incubated at room temperature for an additional 1 h. Finally, TMB substrates were added, and the A450 values were measured.In alternative ELISA experiments, the Nunc-Immuno plate wells were coated with 100 μg/ml recombinant human p115RhoGEF and blocked with 3% BSA. The wells were then supplemented with Bio-G13SRIpep or Bio-G13SRIRandom-pep. After incubation at 37 °C for 4 h, the avidin-HRP was added, and the A450 values were measured as described above.Platelet Shape Change—Human PRP was incubated with Me2SO (vehicle control), Myr-G13SRIpep, or Myr-G13SRIRandom-pep for 5 min, followed by addition of 3 mm EGTA and 10 μm indomethacin. After 2 min of incubation, shape change was induced by adding different agonists and measured by the turbidimetric method (23Kattelman E.J. Venton D.L. Le Breton G.C. Thromb. Res. 1986; 41: 471-481Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) using a model 400 aggregometer (Chrono-Log, Havertown, PA).Platelet Aggregation in PRP—Human PRP was incubated with Me2SO vehicle, Myr-G13SRIpep, or Myr-G13SRIRandom-pep at room temperature for 5 min and 10 μm indomethacin for 2 min. Platelet aggregation was induced by adding different agonists, and measured by the turbidimetric method (23Kattelman E.J. Venton D.L. Le Breton G.C. Thromb. Res. 1986; 41: 471-481Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) using a model 400 aggregometer (Chrono-Log).Platelet Aggregation in Resuspended Platelets—Human PRP was incubated with 500 μm Myr-G13SRIpep or Myr-G13SRIRandom-pep for 5 min. Following the addition of 40 nm PGI2, the plasma was removed by centrifugation at 500 × g for 3 min. Platelets were resuspended in Tyrode's buffer (supplemented with 1 mm calcium and 0.38% BSA), and the platelet count was adjusted to 3 × 108 platelets/ml. Following addition of 10 μm indomethacin and 0.05 units/ml apyrase, thrombin (0.1 or 0.2 units/ml) was added, and platelet aggregation was measured.Platelet Dense Granule Secretion—Human PRP was pretreated with Me2SO vehicle, 75–250 μm Myr-G13SRIpep, or 250 μm Myr-G13SRIRandom-pep and incubated with luciferin/luciferase for 3 min before stimulation. Platelet dense granule secretion was induced by adding 25 μm TRAP1, and secreted ATP was measured with a Chrono-Log lumi-aggregometer.Platelet Calcium Mobilization—Human PRP was incubated with Fura-2 and 500 μm Myr-G13SRIpep (or 500 μm Myr-G13SRIRandom-pep) for 30 min. The platelets were then supplemented with 10 μm indomethacin, 0.05 units/ml apyrase and sedimented by centrifugation at 500 × g for 3 min. Following resuspension in Tyrode's buffer (supplemented with 1 mm calcium, 0.38% BSA, 10 μm indomethacin, and 0.05 units/ml apyrase), platelet calcium mobilization was induced with 25 μm TRAP1 or 10 μm ADP. In the experiments with Y-27632, the platelets were loaded with Fura-2 as described above. Platelets were then incubated with vehicle or 30 μm Y-27632 for 3 min, and calcium mobilization was induced with 25 μm TRAP1. The samples were excited at 340/380 nm, and the fluorescent emissions were detected at 510 nm using a PTI spectrofluorometer.Stress Fiber Formation and Cell Contraction—Human live microvascular endothelial cells were seeded on coverslips and starved for 24 h after the cells became 100% confluent. The cells were then preincubated with 500 μm Myr-G13SRIRandom-pep, Myr-G13SRIpep, or vehicle (in 6% BSA Hanks' buffer) for 30 min and stimulated with 50 μm TRAP1 or vehicle for 15 min. After fixation with 3.7% formaldehyde and permeabilization with 0.1% Triton X-100, the cells were stained with Alex Fluor 488 phalloidin/4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. Finally, the cells were washed and mounted, and the images were obtained using a confocal microscope (Zeiss LSM 510).Statistical Analysis—Data were analyzed with GraphPad PRISM statistical software (San Diego, CA). Statistical significance is defined as p < 0.05 or p < 0.0001, as indicated.RESULTSCharacterization of Myr-G13SRIpep Uptake by Intact Human Platelets—Our previous studies showed that a peptide representing Gα13 SRI can be useful to study G13 signaling (24Manganello J.M.

Based on the presence of κB-like DNA motifs in the region upstream of the TNF gene, some have proposed a direct role for NF-κB in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced TNF gene transcription in cells of the monocyte/macrophage lineage. However, we have previously demonstrated a general and critical role for a minimal TNF promoter region bearing only one of the κB-like motifs, κ3, which is bound by nuclear factor of activated T cell proteins in lymphocytes and fibroblasts in response to multiple stimuli and Ets proteins in LPS-stimulated macrophages. Here, in an effort to resolve these contrasting findings, we used a combination of site-directed mutagenesis of the TNF promoter, quantitative DNase I footprinting, and analysis of endogenous TNF mRNA production in response to multiple stimuli under conditions that inhibit NF-κB activation (using the proteasome inhibitor lactacystin and using cells lacking either functional NF-κB essential modulator, which is the IκB kinase regulatory subunit, or the Nemo gene itself). We find that TNF mRNA production in response to ionophore is NF-κB-independent, but inhibition of NF-κB activation attenuates virus- and LPS-induced TNF mRNA levels after initial induction. We conclude that induction of TNF gene transcription by virus or LPS does not depend upon NF-κB binding to the proximal promoter; rather, a stimulus-specific post-induction mechanism involving NF-κB, yet to be characterized, is involved in the maintenance of maximal TNF mRNA levels.

TNF expression is rapidly induced in response to multiple extracellular stimuli, including engagement of antigen receptor on T and B cells and infection by certain viruses and bacteria (1Aggarwal B.B. Puri R.K. Human Cytokines: Their Role in Disease and Therapy. Blackwell Science Inc., Cambridge, MA1995Google Scholar); indeed, TNF is one of the first genes expressed in activated T cells (2Goldfeld A.E. McCaffrey P.G. Strominger J.L. Rao A. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 178: 1365-1379Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). TNF is also a potent activator of the NF-κB family of proteins, which activate transcription by binding to DNA motifs with the consensus sequence 5′-GGGRNYYYCC-3′, where R is a purine (typically A), Y is a pyrimidine (typically T), and N is any nucleotide (3Chen L.F.

Immun. 2005; 6: 439-445Crossref Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Shortly after the identification of NF-κB as an inducible DNA-binding factor (5Nabel G. Baltimore D. Nature. 1987; 326: 711-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (1456) Google Scholar, 6Baeuerle P.A. Baltimore D. Cell. 1988; 53: 211-217Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (798) Google Scholar), four DNA motifs resembling NF-κB-binding sites were described in the promoter of the murine TNF gene (7Shakhov A.N.

A. 1990; 87: 9769-9773Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). A role for NF-κB in LPS-induced TNF gene transcription was initially postulated based upon the murine TNF promoter sites (7Shakhov A.N. Collart M.A. Vassalli P. Nedospasov S.A. Jongeneel C.V. J. Exp.

Furthermore, the three κB-like motifs in the human TNF promoter do not function as LPS- or virus-inducible enhancers when multimerized and fused to a heterologous promoter, as would be expected for a true NF-κB site (11Goldfeld A.E. Doyle C. Maniatis T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9769-9773Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Later studies identified three additional NF-κB-like sites in the human TNF promoter, κB1, κB2, and ζ (Fig. 1). Of these κB-like sites, κB1, which lies 500–510 bp upstream of the TNF transcription start site, has the highest affinity for NF-κB (9Udalova I.A. Knight J.C. Vidal V. Nedospasov S.A. Kwiatkowski D.

The closely spaced κB2, ζ, and κ1 sites (corresponding to murine κB2a) have been reported to be weak NF-κB p50/p65-binding sites (9Udalova I.A. Knight J.C. Vidal V. Nedospasov S.A. Kwiatkowski D. J.

Although the κ1 site at –597 to –588 bp relative to the TNF mRNA cap site was reported to be a stronger p50/p65-binding site than κB2 in one report (16Ziegler-Heitbrock H.W. Sternsdorf T. Liese J.

It has been reported that point mutations of these sites reduce LPS induction of the TNF gene roughly 2-fold (9Udalova I.A. Knight J.C. Vidal V. Nedospasov S.A. Kwiatkowski D. J. Biol.

Doyle C. Maniatis T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9769-9773Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Consistent with these results, multiple studies have concluded that the 200 proximal base pairs of the human TNF promoter, which lack κ1 and κ2 (Fig. 1), are sufficient for its induction by LPS in multiple monocytic cell lines (11Goldfeld A.E.

Goldfeld A.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5232-5244Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Furthermore, whereas multimers of true NF-κB sites can confer LPS inducibility when placed upstream of a heterologous promoter, multimers of isolated copies of κ3 cannot (11Goldfeld A.E. Doyle C. Maniatis T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9769-9773Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 14Yao J. Mackman N. Edgington T.S. Fan S.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17795-17801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). A role for NF-κB in LPS-induced TNF gene regulation was also initially suggested by the observation that inhibition of TNF gene expression was associated with treatment of cells with pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate or sodium salicylate, which can inhibit LPS-induced nuclear localization of NF-κB (16Ziegler-Heitbrock H.W.

Blood. 1995; 86: 4144-4152Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, these studies provided no direct evidence of a functional role for NF-κB in TNF gene expression. Later studies showed that ectopic expression of a dominant-negative form of the NF-κB inhibitor protein, IκBα, resulted in a decrease in TNF transcription and synthesis in LPS-treated human primary macrophages or monocytic cell lines (10Kuprash D.V. Udalova I.A. Turetskaya R.L. Kwiatkowski D. Rice N.R. Nedospasov S.A. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 4045-4052PubMed Google Scholar, 29Foxwell B. Browne K. Bondeson J. Clarke C. de Martin R. Brennan F.

Chem. 1999; 274: 11667-11671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) also suggesting a role for NF-κB in TNF gene expression. In an effort to resolve the basic discrepancy between the lack of function of upstream κB-like motifs in the TNF promoter and the apparent influence of NF-κB upon LPS-mediated TNF transcription in the studies described above, we examined the effects of altering the interaction of NF-κB with the TNF promoter and the time dependence of NF-κB inhibition upon TNF gene expression in human and murine cells in response to multiple extracellular stimuli. We took the experimental approaches of promoter mutagenesis, in vitro footprinting assays, gene reporter assays, and specific inhibition of the NF-κB pathway by using both a pharmacological inhibitor, lactacystin, and cells lacking NEMO, a component of the kinase complex required for NF-κB activation. Here we show the following: (i) TNF mRNA expression in T cells activated by calcium influx is independent of NF-κB; (ii) the initial phase of TNF mRNA expression in virus-stimulated T cells or LPS-stimulated monocytic cells is not blocked by inhibition of NF-κB activity; and (iii) a novel late phase inhibition of TNF mRNA expression occurs following TNF induction by virus or LPS when the NF-κB activity is inhibited. Thus, we show that although NF-κB does not regulate TNF gene expression through the 200 proximal base pairs of the TNF promoter, it does appear to play a role in sustaining TNF mRNA levels following induction of the gene by virus in T cells and by LPS in cells of the monocyte/macrophage lineage, pointing to an indirect or secondary effect of NF-κB in TNF induction by these stimuli, perhaps through cross-talk with other signal transduction pathways or transcription factors involved in direct regulation of the gene. EMSA and Quantitative DNase I Footprinting—Bacterially expressed and purified NF-κB p50/p65 heterodimer and NFATp were prepared as described previously (31Jain J. Burgeon E. Badalian T.M. Hogan P.G.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3074-3089Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) was incubated at a final volume of 20 μl at increasing concentrations with oligonucleotide probes of the κ3 site (5′-GATCCTGGGTTTCTCCA-3′ and 5′-GATCTGGAGAAACCCAG-3′) or the PRDII site (5′-GATCCTGGGAAATTCCA-3′ and 5′-GATCTGGAATTTCCCAG-3′) end-labeled with 32P using T4 polynucleotide kinase.

https://openalex.org/W2142196823,"The general stress response of Bacillus subtilis and close relatives provides the cell with protection from a variety of stresses. The upstream component of the environmental stress signal transduction cascade is activated by the RsbT kinase that switches binding partners from a 25 S macromolecular complex, the stressosome, to the RsbU phosphatase. Once the RsbU phosphatase is activated by interacting with RsbT, the alternative sigma factor, sigmaB, directs transcription of the general stress regulon. Previously, we demonstrated that the N-terminal domain of RsbU mediates the binding of RsbT. We now describe residues in N-RsbU that are crucial to this interaction by experimentation both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, crystal structures of the N-RsbU mutants provide a molecular explanation for the loss of interaction. Finally, we also characterize mutants in RsbT that affect binding to both RsbU and a simplified, binary model of the stressosome and thus identify overlapping binding surfaces on the RsbT ""switch."""

Little is known about the activities and substrate specificities of the scores of TTM homologs present in bacterial and archaeal proteomes, nearly all of which are annotated as adenylate cyclases.

We have identified 11 conserved amino acids in the tunnel that are critical for tripolyphosphatase and ATPase activity. The most salient findings are that (i) CthTTM is 150-fold more active in cleaving tripolyphosphate than ATP and (ii) the substrate specificity of CthTTM can be transformed by a single mutation (K8A) that abolishes tripolyphosphatase activity while strongly stimulating ATP hydrolysis.

The signature biochemical property of this branch of the TTM superfamily is the ability to hydrolyze NTPs to nucleoside diphosphates and Pi in the presence of manganese (2Ho C.K. Pei Y. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34151-34156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Their defining primary structure features are two glutamate-containing motifs that are required for catalysis by every family member and which comprise the metal-binding site. The crystal structure of the S. cerevisiae RNA triphosphatase Cet1 bound to manganese and sulfate (a proposed mimetic of the product complex with phosphate) revealed a then-novel tertiary structure in which the active site is situated within a topologically closed tunnel composed of eight antiparallel β strands (18Lima C.D. Wang L.K. Shuman S. Cell. 1999; 99: 533-543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Extensive mutational analyses of yeast Cet1 identified a large ensemble of side chains essential for triphosphatase activity in vitro and in vivo, many of which make direct or water-mediated contacts with the divalent cation or the sulfate anion (3Bisaillon M. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17261-17266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). It was thought initially that the Cet1-like RNA triphosphatases arose de novo in unicellular eukarya in tandem with the emergence of caps as the defining feature of eukaryal mRNA. This notion has been eclipsed by the finding that the heretofore unique tertiary structure and active site of yeast RNA triphosphatase are recapitulated in the crystal structures of archaeal and bacterial proteins of unknown biochemical function, including proteins from Pyrococcus (Protein Data Bank (PDB) accession codes 1YEM and 2DC4), Vibrio (2ACA), and Nitrosomonas (2FBL) (1Gong C. Smith P. Shuman S. RNA. 2006; 12: 1468-1474Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The Cet1-like archaeal/bacterial proteins are usually annotated as belonging to the so-called CYTH family (19Iyer L.M. Aravind L. BMC Genomics. 2002; 3: 33Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), which is defined by its two biochemically characterized founding members, an Aeromonas hydrophila adenylate cyclase CyaB and a mammalian thiamine triphosphatase (20Sismeiro O. Trotot P. Biville F. Vivares C. Danchin A. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 3339-3344Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Lakaye B. Makarchikov A.F. Antunes A.F. Zorzi W. Coumans B. DePauw E. Wins P. Grisar T. Bettendorf L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13771-13777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). A crystal structure of a Cet1-like adenylate cyclase from Yersinia (2FJT) has been reported recently (22Gallagher D.T. Smith N.N. Kim S.K. Heroux A. Robinson H. Reddy P.T. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 362: 114-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Given that the Cet1 clade, CyaB, and thiamine triphosphatase are all metal-dependent enzymes that act on triphosphate-containing substrates, we concluded that the tunnel fold first described for Cet1 is the prototype of a larger enzyme superfamily, which we named “triphosphate tunnel metalloenzyme” (TTM) to reflect the defining structural features (1Gong C. Smith P. Shuman S. RNA. 2006; 12: 1468-1474Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Although it is now clear that TTM proteins are distributed widely among bacterial, archaeal, and eukaryal taxa, virtually nothing is known about the presumptive enzymatic activities and substrate specificities of the dozens of TTM homologs present in bacterial and archaeal proteomes. Indeed, the majority of these TTM proteins are annotated as adenylate cyclases without any evidence that they have this activity. Here we have presented a biochemical characterization and structure-function analysis of a 156-amino-acid TTM protein from the bacterium Clostridium thermocellum (CthTTM). Although annotated as an adenylate cyclase (GenBank™ EAM47091), CthTTM had no detectable adenylate cyclase activity in our hands. Rather, CthTTM is a metal-dependent phosphohydrolase that specifically cleaves the β-γ phosphoanhydride bond of tripolyphosphate and nucleoside triphosphates. We have determined the effects of 35 mutations of 14 amino acids within the putative triphosphate tunnel of CthTTM and thereby distinguished the functional groups required for global phosphohydrolase activity from ones selective for activity on nucleotide versus inorganic phosphoanhydride. Recombinant CthTTM—The open reading frame encoding CthTTM was amplified from C. thermocellum genomic DNA (purchased from the American Type Culture Collection) with primers that introduced an NdeI site at the start codon and a BamHI site 3′ of the stop codon. The PCR product was digested with NdeI and BamHI and inserted into pET16b to generate an expression plasmid encoding the CthTTM polypeptide fused to an N-terminal His10 tag. Alanine and conservative substitution mutations were introduced by PCR using the two-stage overlap extension method (23Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene. 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6850) Google Scholar). The inserts of all plasmids were sequenced to exclude the acquisition of unwanted coding changes during amplification or cloning. Wild-type and mutant pET-CthTTM plasmids were transformed into Escherichia coli BL21(DE3). Cultures (250 ml) were grown at 37 °C in Luria-Bertani medium containing 0.1 mg/ml ampicillin until the A600 reached ∼0.6. The cultures were adjusted to 0.1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside and incubated at 37 °C for 3 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, and the pellet was stored at -80 °C. All subsequent procedures were performed at 4 °C. Thawed bacteria were resuspended in 25 ml of buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.25 m NaCl, 10% sucrose). Lysozyme, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and Triton X-100 were added to final concentrations of 1 mg/ml, 0.5 mm, and 0.1%, respectively. The lysates were sonicated to reduce viscosity, and insoluble material was removed by centrifugation. The soluble extracts were applied to 1-ml columns of nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen) that had been equilibrated with buffer A. The columns were washed with 10 ml of the same buffer and then eluted stepwise with 4-ml aliquots of 50, 100, and 200 mm imidazole in buffer B (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.25 m NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.05% Triton X-100). The polypeptide compositions of the column fractions were monitored by SDS-PAGE. The His10-CthTTM polypeptide was recovered predominantly in the 200 mm imidazole fraction. The 200 mm imidazole eluates were dialyzed against 50 mm NaCl in buffer C (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, 0.05% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol) and then applied to 1-ml columns of DEAE-Sephacel that had been equilibrated with 50 mm NaCl in buffer C. The columns were washed with 8 ml of the same buffer and then eluted stepwise with 4-ml aliquots of 100, 200, and 500 mm NaCl in buffer C. CthTTM was recovered in the flow-through. The proteins were stored at -80 °C. Protein concentrations were determined by using the Bio-Rad dye reagent with bovine serum albumin as the standard. The yield of wild-type CthTTM was 10 mg from a 250-ml bacterial culture. Nucleoside Triphosphatase Assay—Reaction mixtures containing (per 10 μl) 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 2 mm MnCl2, and 100 μm [γ-32P]ATP or [α-32P]ATP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), and CthTTM, as specified, were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. An aliquot (1.5 μl) of the mixture was applied to a polyethyleneimine-cellulose TLC plate, which was developed with 0.5 m LiCl and 1 m formic acid. The radiolabeled material was visualized by autoradiography and 32Pi formation was quantified by scanning the TLC plate with a Fujix BAS2500 imager. Alternatively, reaction mixtures (50 μl) containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 2 mm MnCl2, 100 μm unlabeled NTP or dNTP, and CthTTM, as specified, were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. The reactions were quenched by adding 1 ml of malachite green reagent (BIOMOL Research Laboratories, Plymouth Meeting, PA). Phosphate release was determined by measuring A620 and interpolating the value to a phosphate standard curve. Tripolyphosphatase Assay—Reaction mixtures (50 μl) containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.0, 10 mm MgCl2 or 0.5 mm MnCl2, 100 μm inorganic tripolyphosphate (PPPi) (Sigma), and CthTTM, as specified, were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. The reactions were quenched by adding 1 ml of malachite green reagent. Release of phosphate was determined by measuring A620 and interpolating the value to a phosphate standard curve. Glycerol Gradient Sedimentation—An aliquot (100 μg) of CthTTM was mixed with catalase (50 μg), bovine serum albumin (50 μg), and cytochrome c (50 μg). The mixture was applied to a 4.8-ml 15–30% glycerol gradient containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.2 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.05% Triton X-100. The gradient was centrifuged at 50,000 revolutions/min for 17 h at 4 °C in a Beckman SW55Ti rotor. Fractions (∼0.18 ml) were collected from the bottom of the tube. Aliquots of even-numbered fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and assayed for nucleoside triphosphatase and tripolyphosphatase activities. A TTM from C. thermocellum—The primary structure of the 156-amino-acid putative TTM from C. thermocellum (CthTTM) is aligned in Fig. 1A to a closely related TTM protein from Nitrosomonas europaea (NeuTTM; 151 amino acids) for which a crystal structure is available (PDB accession code 2FBL). The NeuTTM fold is distinguished by the fact that the eight-stranded antiparallel β barrel is not a closed tunnel but rather a C-shaped “cup” that is prevented from closing by virtue of the insertion of a broken C-terminal helix into one end of the tunnel (Fig. 1B). The position of the C-terminal segment in the tunnel aperture appears to be stabilized by a hydrogen bond from a conserved lysine in the β1 strand of the tunnel (Lys-7 in NeuTTM; Lys-8 in CthTTM) to a backbone carbonyl at the break in the C-terminal helix (Fig. 1B). The primary structures of CthTTM and NeuTTM have 73 positions of side chain identity/similarity. Especially striking is the identity of the constellation of acidic and basic residues that project into the tunnel (Fig. 1B) and are the equivalents of the essential constituents of the Cet1 active site. CthTTM Is a Nucleoside Triphosphate Phosphohydrolase— Reaction of purified CthTTM with 100 μm [α-32P]ATP in the presence of a divalent cation resulted in quantitative conversion of the labeled substrate to ADP (Fig. 2A). No labeled product corresponding to 3′,5′-cyclic AMP was detected. A parallel reaction of CthTTM with 100 μm [γ32P]ATP resulted in conversion of nearly all of the labeled material to inorganic phosphate (Fig. 2A). The rate of release of 32Pi from [γ-32P]ATP was identical to the rate of conversion of [α-32P]ATP to [α-32P]ADP in parallel reaction mixtures containing the same enzyme concentrations (Fig. 2B), indicating that CthTTM catalyzed the hydrolysis of ATP to ADP and Pi. ATP hydrolysis by CthTTM was optimal at pH 8.0–8.5 in Tris buffer and declined sharply as the pH was increased to 9.5 or decreased to ≤7.0 (Fig. 3A). No ATP hydrolysis was evident in the absence of a divalent cation (Fig. 2A). ATPase activity increased with manganese concentration up to an optimum of 2.5 mm and declined as the concentration was increased to 5, 10, and 20 mm (Fig. 3B). Other divalent cations (magnesium, cobalt, nickel, cadmium, calcium, copper, and zinc) were unable to support ATPase activity at 2 mm concentration (data not shown). CthTTM activity displayed a hyperbolic dependence on ATP concentration (Fig. 3C). From a double reciprocal plot, we calculated a Km value of 26 μm ATP and a kcat of 25 min-1. NTP specificity was examined by colorimetric assay of the release of Pi from unlabeled ribonucleotides ATP, GTP, CTP, or UTP and deoxynucleotides dATP, dGTP, dCTP, and dTTP. CthTTM was active with all eight nucleoside triphosphates (Fig. 3D). Hydrolysis of Inorganic Tripolyphosphate Exceeds NTP Hydrolysis—CthTTM displayed vigorous activity in releasing Pi from PPPi in the presence of a divalent cation cofactor, which could be either magnesium or manganese (Fig. 4A). The extent of Pi formation was proportional to CthTTM concentration and saturated at a level corresponding to 1 mol of Pi/mol of input PPPi substrate (Fig. 4A and data not shown). CthTTM failed to release Pi from inorganic pyrophosphate (PPi) in the presence of magnesium or manganese, even at enzyme concentrations sufficient for maximal Pi release from tripolyphosphate (Fig. 4A). We conclude that CthTTM converts PPPi to PPi plus Pi. Thus, CthTTM is dedicated to hydrolysis of the β-γ phosphoanhydride linkage of triphosphate-containing substrates, whether inorganic or nucleoside-linked. The specific activity in magnesium-dependent tripolyphosphate cleavage corresponded to a turnover number of ∼3800 min-1. This value is 150-fold higher than CthTTM ATPase activity. When various metals were tested at 2 mm concentration, magnesium supported the highest tripolyphosphatase activity, followed by manganese and cobalt, which were about one-half and one-forth as effective as magnesium, respectively (Fig. 4B). Nickel, copper, calcium, cadmium, and zinc were ineffective (Fig. 4B). Magnesium supported optimal activity at 10–20 mm, whereas manganese-dependent activity was optimum at 0.31–0.62 mm and declined at higher concentrations (Fig. 4C). Tripolyphosphatase activity with magnesium or manganese was optimal at pH 9.0–9.5 in Tris buffer (Fig. 4D). Activity was virtually nil at pH ≤6.5 (Fig. 4D). CthTTM Is a Homodimer—The quaternary structure of CthTTM was gauged by zonal velocity sedimentation through a 15–30% glycerol gradient. Marker protein catalase (248 kDa), bovine serum albumin (66 kDa), and cytochrome c (13 kDa) were included as internal standards. CthTTM sedimented as a discrete peak in fractions 20–22 overlapping the “light” side of the bovine serum albumin peak (Fig. 5). The ATP and tripolyphosphatase activity profiles peaked in fractions 20–22 and coincided with an abundance of the CthTTM polypeptide (Fig. 5). A plot of the S values of the three standards versus fraction number yielded a straight line (data not shown). An S value of 3.6 was determined for CthTTM by interpolation to the internal standard curve. We surmise that CthTTM is a homodimer of the 156-amino-acid polypeptide. These native sizing results are consistent with crystallographic evidence that NeuTTM is a homodimer (2FBL), as are many other TTM proteins, including the founding TTM protein Cet1 (18Lima C.D. Wang L.K. Shuman S. Cell. 1999; 99: 533-543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 24Lehman K. Schwer B. Ho C.K. Rouzankina I. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22668-22678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Structure-guided Alanine Scan of the CthTTM Tunnel— Fourteen conserved residues projecting into the tunnel were targeted for alanine scanning: Glu-4, Glu-6, and Lys-8 in β1; Arg-39 and Arg-41 in β3; Lys-52 in β4; Glu-62 and Glu-64 in β5; Lys-87 and Arg-89 in β6; Glu-100 and Asp-102 in β7; and Glu-115 and Glu-117 in β8 (Fig. 1). CthTTM and the CthTTM-Ala proteins were produced in E. coli as His10 fusions and purified from soluble bacterial extracts by nickel-agarose chromatography (Fig. 6A). The His10-CthTTM polypeptide (calculated mass 20.5 kDa) migrated anomalously “heavy” during SDS-PAGE (Fig. 6A). Each protein was assayed for ATP hydrolysis as a function of enzyme concentration (Fig. 6B). Several distinct classes of mutational effects were observed. Nine of the mutants were severely defective, with ATPase specific activities <1% of the wild-type value. These were E6A, R39A, R41A, K52A, E62A, K87A, R89A, D102A, and E117A. Three other mutants, E4A, E64A, and E115A, were 3% as active as wild-type CthTTM. Our operational definition of an essential residue is one at which side chain removal by alanine substitution reduces activity to ≤5% of wild-type CthTTM. By this criterion, Glu-4, Glu-6, Arg-39, Arg-41, Lys-52, Glu-62, Glu-64, Lys-87, Arg-89, Asp-102, Glu-115, and Glu-117 are essential residues and likely constituents of the phosphohydrolase active site. The E100A change had only a modest effect (22% of wild-type ATPase specific activity). Thus, Glu-100 was not essential for ATP hydrolysis. The remarkable finding was that the K8A change elicited a ∼16-fold increase in ATPase specific activity compared with wild-type CthTTM (Fig. 6B). We observed this effect with two independent preparations of the K8A protein. A substrate titration experiment (not shown) revealed that K8A resulted in a 21-fold increase in kcat (530 min-1) and a 3-fold increase in Km (75 μm) relative to wild-type CthTTM. The gain-of-function effect can be rationalized by reference to the corresponding β1 lysine in NeuTTM (Fig. 1B), which forms a hydrogen bond to the main chain carbonyl at the break in the C-terminal helix that we presume impedes the adoption of the closed tunnel architecture seen in Cet1. The twelve side chains essential for CthTTM triphosphatase activity are splayed apart in the C-shaped cup conformation of NeuTTM compared with their positions in the closed Cet1 tunnel, which implies that the CthTTM β barrel must undergo a conformational change to trigger catalysis. We postulate that loss of the inhibitory hydrogen bond in the K8A protein favors the adoption of a catalytically competent tunnel conformation. Effects of Alanine Mutations on Tripolyphosphatase Activity— All 14 of the alanine mutations abolished or severely diminished magnesium-dependent tripolyphosphatase activity (Fig. 7A). However, the tripolyphosphatase activity of mutants E100A and D102A was restored (to 46 and 96% of wild-type, respectively) when manganese replaced magnesium as the metal cofactor (Fig. 7B). The relatively benign effect of the E100A change on the manganese-dependent tripolyphosphatase was consistent with its modest effects on the manganese-dependent ATPase (Fig. 6B). The notable finding was that Asp-102 was essential for manganese-dependent ATPase, yet dispensable for manganese-dependent tripolyphosphatase. Thus, the exact constellation of functional groups required for catalysis by CthTTM depends on the nature of the metal cofactor and the triphosphate substrate. Perhaps the most striking instance of substrate dependence was the finding that the K8A change stimulated ATP hydrolysis but suppressed the hydrolysis of tripolyphosphate (Figs. 6B and 7). We speculate that Lys-8 makes a key ionic contact with the α phosphate dianion of PPPi that is not applicable to ATP, because its α phosphate is a monoanion. Probing Structure-Activity Relationships via Conservative Substitutions—Twenty-one conservative substitutions were introduced at 12 of the residues defined as essential in the alanine scan: Glu-4, Glu-6, Arg-39, Arg-41, Lys-52, Glu-62, Glu-64, Lys-87, Arg-89, Asp-102, Glu-115, and Glu-117 (Fig. 8). As noted in the alanine scan, the magnesium-dependent tripolyphosphatase activity was more sensitive to inactivation by conservative mutations than were either of the manganese-dependent hydrolytic reactions (Fig. 8). Based on the crystal structure of the Cet1-Mn2+ complex (18Lima C.D. Wang L.K. Shuman S. Cell. 1999; 99: 533-543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) and their clustering close together in the NeuTTM structure (Fig. 1B), Glu-4, Glu-6, Glu-115, and Glu-117 are likely metal-binding residues. These four glutamates were strictly essential for Mg2+-PPPase, insofar as their replacement with either aspartate or glutamine eliminated activity. We surmise that the carboxylate moiety is critical (i.e. the isosteric glutamine was ineffective) and that activity requires a critical distance from the carboxylate to the main chain of the tunnel strand that is not satisfied by the shorter Asp side chain. Yet, several of the conservative substitutions for these glutamates elicited significant gains of tripolyphosphatase function (relative to the Ala mutants) in the presence of manganese. For example, the E6D change restored Mn2+-PPPase activity to a near wild-type level, whereas the E6Q change had no salutary effect (Fig. 8). Thus, CthTTM tolerates the shorter Asp side chain for tripolyphosphate hydrolysis with manganese as the cofactor. A plausible interpretation of this result is that Glu-6 directly coordinates the metal ion as part of an octahedral complex (as is the case for the equivalent glutamate of Cet1) and that the larger atomic radius of manganese (0.8 Å) versus magnesium (0.65 Å) allows Asp-6 to reach and engage a manganese coordination complex but not a magnesium complex. A similar ablation of magnesium-dependent phosphohydrolase activity, although preserving manganese-driven catalysis, was noted previously for a Glu→Asp mutation of baculovirus RNA triphosphatase (13Martins A. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45522-45529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), which is a putative member of the TTM family. The striking finding here is that the E6D change did not restore manganese-dependent ATPase activity (Fig. 8); this is another instance in which the enzymic requirements for catalysis by CthTTM differ for nucleoside versus inorganic triphosphate substrates. The Cet1 equivalent of CthTTM Glu-4 coordinates the metal cofactor directly. Changing Glu-4 to either Asp or Gln resulted in restoration of Mn2+-PPPase activity to ∼20% of wild-type (Fig. 8), a gain of function relative to the grossly defective E4A mutant (Fig. 7). Apparently, the role of this side chain in the Mn2+-PPPi complex can be fulfilled, in part, by the amide of Gln or the carboxylate of Asp. The Cet1 analog of CthTTM Glu-115 makes a water-mediated contact to the divalent cation (18Lima C.D. Wang L.K. Shuman S. Cell. 1999; 99: 533-543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Replacing Glu-115 with Asp or Gln afforded a modest increase in Mn2+-PPPase activity (25 and 35% of wild-type, respectively) compared with the E115A mutant (Fig. 8). We speculate that CthTTM has residual activity when Glu-115 is mutated, because a water can still join the Mn2+-PPPi complex. The Cet1 equivalent of CthTTM Glu-117 coordinates the divalent cation directly. Here we find that the conservative E117D mutant was globally defective in triphosphate hydrolysis, implying a stringent requirement for the longer main chain-to-carboxylate linker. (We did not test the effects of a glutamine substitution for Glu-117.) The essential positively charged residues Arg-39, Arg-41, Lys-52, Lys-87, and Arg-89 are good candidates to contact the anionic phosphates of the PPPi and NTP substrates, as suggested by the interactions of several of the equivalent side chains with a sulfate in the Cet1 tunnel (18Lima C.D. Wang L.K. Shuman S. Cell. 1999; 99: 533-543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). In CthTTM, Arg-39 in strand β3is strictly essential for all phosphohydrolase activities, insofar as replacement with lysine or glutamine phenocopied the global catalytic defect of the alanine mutant (Fig. 8). We speculate that Arg-39 makes an essential bidentate interaction via its guanidinium nitrogens that cannot be fulfilled by lysine. At CthTTM residue Lys-87 in strand β6, the glutamine mutant was globally defective (Fig. 8), indicating that positive charge is critical at this position (Fig. 8). Arg-89 in strand β6 is strictly essential for Mg2+-PPPase and Mn2+-ATPase (neither lysine nor glutamine supported activity), but it could be functionally replaced by lysine (although not glutamine) for manganese-dependent tripolyphosphate hydrolysis (Fig. 8). In the NeuTTM structure (Fig. 1B), the equivalent of CthTTM Arg-89 engages in a bidentate salt bridge with Asp-102. It is noteworthy that the strict essentiality of Asp-102 for Mg2+-PPPase and Mn2+-ATPase (neither glutamate nor asparagine sufficed) correlated with the requirement for its Arg-89 interaction partner, whereas the lack of a requirement for Asp-102 for Mn2+-PPPase activity (alanine, glutamate, and asparagine mutants were active) correlated with the ability of lysine to replace Arg-89 for Mn2+-PPPase. These data suggest that the salt bridge is required to properly orient Arg-89 for catalysis of Mg2+-PPPase and Mn2+-ATPase, whereas lysine is able to engage the Mn2+-PPPase complex without forming an ion pair with another side chain. According to the homologous NeuTTM structure, CthTTM Arg-41 in strand β3 makes a bifurcated contact from its terminal guanidinium nitrogens to the Oϵ2 atom of Glu-64 in strand β5. Although replacing Arg-41 with glutamine abolished activity and phenocopied the R41A mutant, we observed metal-specific effects of the R41K substitution whereby the lysine failed to support Mg2+-PPPase but resulted in a partial restoration of function for Mn2+-PPPase (Fig. 8). Conservative changes at the Arg-41-interacting Glu-64 position had either mild (Mn2+-PPPase) or moderate (Mg2+-PPPase, Mn2+-ATPase) impact on activity, with glutamine being slightly superior to aspartate (Fig. 8). Lys-52 in strand β4 could not be replaced by arginine for any of the activities tested (Fig. 8), perhaps because the bulkier arginine creates a steric clash. (We did not test the effects of glutamine at position 52). Lys-52 makes an ionic interaction with Glu-62 in strand β5. It is notable that Glu-62 could be replaced by glutamine with little impact on Mn2+-PPPase, whereas aspartate was detrimental (Fig. 8). E62Q also supported residual levels of Mg2+-PPPase and Mn2+-ATPase activity (Fig. 8). These results indicate that, although a Glu at position 62 provided optimal activity, the relevant property of this residue was probably its capacity to accept a hydrogen bond. We found that CthTTM is a metal-dependent tripolyphosphatase and nucleoside triphosphatase. It was most assuredly not an adenylate cyclase in our hands, notwithstanding that it, and virtually every other TTM homolog in the NCBI data base, is annotated as an adenylate cyclase in the absence of corroborating functional data. Our survey of various substrates, although not exhaustive, established the chemical specificity of CthTTM for hydrolysis of the β-γ phosphoanhydride linkage of triphosphate-containing substrates. CthTTM displayed little or no discrimination of the sugar or base components of nucleoside triphosphate substrates, which were hydrolyzed to form a nucleoside diphosphate and Pi. The key finding was that CthTTM was at least two orders of magnitude more active in cleaving tripolyphosphate than ATP. This strong preference for an inorganic triphosphate is unprecedented among TTM proteins studied previously. For example, T. brucei Cet1 can hydrolyze PPPi but only 0.5% as well as it hydrolyzes ATP (9Gong C. Martins A. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 50843-50852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Chlorella virus RNA triphosphatase cleaves PPPi 3% as well as it hydrolyzes ATP (15Gong C. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15317-15324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The ensemble of side chains important for CthTTM tripolyphosphatase and ATPase activity, irrespective of metal cofactor choice, consists of 11 amino acids: Glu-4, Glu-6, Arg-39, Arg-41, Lys-52, Glu-62, Glu-64, Lys-87, Arg-89, Glu-115, and Glu-117. We discussed above the likely contributions of several of these side chains to metal and triphosphate binding based on structural and functional studies of other TTM proteins and the homologous NeuTTM crystal structure. A fuller appreciation of their catalytic contributions will hinge on obtaining crystal structures of this and other TTM proteins with genuine triphosphate substrates bound in the active site. It is most remarkable that the substrate specificity of CthTTM can be transformed by single missense mutation. The K8A change virtually abolished tripolyphosphatase activity while strongly stimulating the hydrolysis of ATP. This result highlights the plasticity of the CthTTM substrate choice and has implications for the rapid acquisition of novel specificities within the TTM superfamily through changes in the residues that line the tunnel walls. We discussed above the likely roles of tunnel conformational equilibria and substrate-specific contacts in mediating the changes in activity accompanying the K8A mutation. It is worth pointing out that the equivalent lysine→alanine change in the β1 strand of yeast Cet1 had no effect on ATPase or RNA triphosphatase activity (3Bisaillon M. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17261-17266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), which is sensible, because Cet1 has no equivalent of the “inhibitory” C-terminal helix of NeuTTM that clogs one of the ends of the tunnel. Our studies of CthTTM emphasize that nothing can be taken for granted about the activity of any particular TTM protein, be it substrate specificity or structure-activity relationships, which need to be probed directly for each TTM family member of interest."

For serotype 3 reoviruses, viral attachment is a multistep process initiated by low affinity binding to sialic acid followed by high affinity binding to junctional adhesion molecule-A (JAM-A) (1Barton E.S.

Accumulating evidence suggests that σ1 undergoes dramatic conformational changes during viral disassembly and that these changes facilitate key steps in the cell entry process (4Furlong D.B.

We previously determined the structure of the C-terminal half of σ1, which comprises the head domain plus a short region of the tail (6Chappell J.D. Prota A. Dermody T.S. Stehle T. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). This structure provided clues about the interaction of the head domain with its receptor JAM-A and the nature of trimer contacts. The head domain contains a water-filled cavity formed by three eight-stranded β-barrels, one donated by each monomer. The tail region consists of three β-spiral repeats. One of the most remarkable features of the σ1 structure is a cluster of aspartic acid residues at the base of the head domain (6Chappell J.D. Prota A. Dermody T.S. Stehle T. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Molecular dynamics studies suggest that these residues are likely to play a role in mediating conformational changes in σ1 (17Cavalli A. Prota A.E. Stehle T. Dermody T.S. Recanatini M. Folkers G. Scapozza L. Biophys. J. 2004; 86: 3423-3431Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). However, at 2.6 Å resolution, the structure did not allow precise placement of water molecules and visualization of contacts between amino acids with sufficient accuracy to explain how such a unique arrangement of amino acids is compatible with a higher order structure. In this study, we determined a high resolution structure of a fragment of T3D σ1 that comprises the head domain and a single β-spiral repeat of the tail. The structure has been refined to a resolution of 1.75 Å, allowing us to discern with high clarity details of the subunit interface in the vicinity of the aspartic acid cluster. Furthermore, we have analyzed two σ1 mutants with alterations in the vicinity of the subunit interface to determine the effects on receptor binding capacity and trimer stability. Our studies suggest that the aspartic acid cluster serves as a molecular switch that, depending on the microenvironment, can stabilize or destabilize the formation of a trimeric structure. Protein Expression, Purification, and Analysis—A cDNA encoding residues 293-455 of T3D σ1 was amplified by PCR and introduced into pGEX4T-3 (GE Healthcare). Mutations were engineered using site-directed PCR with appropriate mutagenic primers. Expression was induced with 0.2 mm IPTG in Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3) pLys-S cells (Novagen) at 25 °C. Bacteria were centrifuged to form a pellet, solubilized in 50 mm Tris (pH 7.8), 3 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 100 μg/ml lysozyme, submitted to 50% duty-cycle sonication pulses using a Branson Sonifier 450, and centrifuged at 15,000 × g. The soluble fraction was purified using a 5-ml GSTrapFF column (GE Healthcare) and eluted with 30 mm reduced glutathione, 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 3 mm EDTA, and 50 mm Tris (pH 8.05). Controlled tryptic protease treatment was performed overnight at 4 °C to remove the glutathione S-transferase (GST) tag. The sample was equilibrated using PD-10 desalting columns and purified further using Mono Q anion-exchange chromatography (GE Healthcare) with an increasing gradient of NaCl in 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.1). The σ1-Y313A mutant protein was cleaved with thrombin on-column and further purified by gel filtration using a Superdex 75 column (GE Healthcare). Human JAM-A (hJAM-A), expressed as a GST fusion protein, was purified as described (18Prota A.E. Campbell J.A. Schelling P. Forrest J.C. Peters T.R. Watson M.J. Aurrand-Lions M. Imhof B. Dermody T.S. Stehle T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 5366-5371Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Analytical scale gel filtration was performed using a Superdex 75 column mounted on a SMART system (GE Healthcare) in 20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl. Protein Crystallization and Data Collection—Purified T3D σ1 head domain was subjected to size-exclusion chromatography in 20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, and 0.01% sodium azide and concentrated using Millipore 5 MWCO filters to 13.6 mg/ml, as assessed by direct measurement of absorbance at 260 and 280 nm using the relationship: c[mg/ml] = (1.55 × A280 nm) - (0.76 × A260 nm), since the T3D σ1 head domain does not react linearly with either Bradford or Lowry dyes (data not shown). Crystals of native σ1 protein were grown from 10-12% polyethylene glycol 8000, 0.2 m magnesium sulfate, and 0.1 m sodium cacodylate (pH 6.9) by mixing an equal amount of protein and precipitant solution. σ1-D345N was concentrated to 8 mg/ml, and crystals were grown using the same conditions used to cultivate crystals of the wild-type protein but with 20% polyethylene glycol 8000. Crystals were flashfrozen using glycerol as cryoprotectant. Data from wild-type crystals were collected at the Brookhaven National Laboratory Synchrotron (beamline X29 features high flux radiation and ADSC Quantum-315 CCD detector). Data for σ1-D345N crystals were collected at the X6S beamline of the Swiss Light Source (Villigen, Switzerland) using a MarCCD detector. Both data sets were collected from single crystals and processed with HKL2000 (19Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38609) Google Scholar). Structure Determination—Crystals of wild-type σ1 belong to space group P21 (a = 83.93 Å, b = 51.38 Å, c = 108.87 Å, β = 95.66°) and contain six molecules, forming two complete trimers, in the asymmetric unit. The structure was determined by molecular replacement using the trimeric σ1 head domain (6Chappell J.D. Prota A. Dermody T.S. Stehle T. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) as a search model in AMoRe (20Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1994; 50: 157-163Crossref Scopus (5030) Google Scholar). Alternating rounds of model building and refinement were performed initially using the programs O (21Jones T.A. Zhou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect.

The structure of this protein was solved and refined to 1.85 Å using Coot and Refmac5. Structure factors and coordinates have been deposited with the Protein Data Bank with accession codes 2OJ5 and 2OJ6 for the wild-type and mutant proteins, respectively.TABLE 1Data collection and refinement statistics for the wild-type σ1 and σ1-D345N crystal structuresData setWild-type σ1σ1-D345NDiffraction dataaData sets were collected at 100 K and a wavelength of 1.1 Å (wild-type) and 1.0 Å (D345N).

Open table in a new tab Surface Plasmon Resonance—A BIAcore CM5 chip (Pharmacia Biosensor AB) was coated with mouse ascites containing monoclonal anti-GST antibody (Sigma) to 10,000 RU protein (∼2000 RU antibody) by amine coupling. Purified GST or GST-hJAM-A ectodomain fusion protein at a concentration of 2 μm in HEPES-buffered saline (pH 7.0) were captured by injection across individual flow cells of an antibody-coated CM5 chip for 3 min at 30 μl/min using a BIAcore 2000 (Pharmacia Biosensor AB). Purified T3D σ1 head domain was injected across the conjugated chip surface at 30 μl/min. Following σ1 binding, chip surfaces were regenerated with a 20-μl pulse of 10 mm glycine (pH 2.5). Affinity constants for σ1 binding to hJAM-A were determined using separate kon and koff nonlinear regression with BIAevaluation 3.0 software (Pharmacia Biosensor AB), assuming a 1:1 Langmuir binding model (25Karlsson R. Falt A. J. Immunol. Methods. 1997; 200: 121-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). Purification of the σ1 Head—The previously crystallized T3D σ1 protein (6Chappell J.D. Prota A. Dermody T.S. Stehle T. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) contained a flexible linker between the C-terminal two β-spiral repeats of the tail. This flexibility likely contributed to the observed diffraction limit of 2.6 Å for these crystals. To obtain better diffracting crystals of T3D σ1, we designed a modified construct containing the entire head domain and only the C-terminal β-spiral repeat of the tail (residues 293-455). We also tested an additional construct comprising only the head domain (residues 309-455), but it did not yield soluble and trimeric protein, suggesting that the C-terminal β-spiral contributes to trimer formation. The protein was produced with a cleavable N-terminal GST tag and purified via sequential glutathione affinity chromatography and anion exchange chromatography. Subsequent gel filtration showed that the protein elutes at an apparent molecular weight of ∼45 kDa, consistent with a trimer (see Fig. 4A). N-terminal sequencing confirmed that the product released following protease treatment was the σ1 head domain with two additional amino acids from the protease recognition sequence (data not shown). Binding of the σ1 Head Domain to JAM-A—To determine whether the purified protein folds natively, we quantitatively assessed the capacity of the σ1 head domain to bind to JAM-A using surface plasmon resonance. The JAM-A ectodomain, expressed and purified as a GST fusion protein (18Prota A.E. Campbell J.A. Schelling P. Forrest J.C. Peters T.R. Watson M.J. Aurrand-Lions M. Imhof B. Dermody T.S. Stehle T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 5366-5371Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), was captured on a biosensor surface with a GST-specific antibody. When injected across the biosensor surface, purified σ1 head bound saturably and reversibly to the GST-JAM-A ectodomain but not to GST alone (Fig. 1A). Kinetic analysis of the σ1-GST-JAM-A interaction using BIAevaluation 3.0 software indicated a KD of ∼7 × 10-9 m, a value that approximates the KD determined for a larger fragment of σ1 (2Barton E.S. Forrest J.C. Connolly J.L. Chappell J.D. Liu Y. Schnell F. Nusrat A. Parkos C.A. Dermody T.S. Cell. 2001; 104: 441-451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). These results indicate that the purified σ1 head domain is functional and that the JAM-A-binding domain of σ1 lies within residues 293-455. Overall Structure of the σ1 Head Domain at 1.75 Å Resolution—Diffraction data were collected at the National Synchrotron Light Source (Brookhaven National Laboratory) using crystals of the purified σ1 head domain. The structure was solved by molecular replacement using the previously determined lower resolution structure of a C-terminal fragment of σ1 (6Chappell J.D. Prota A. Dermody T.S. Stehle T. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) and refined to 1.75 Å (Table 1). An omit map for a portion of the refined structure calculated without model bias (supplemental Fig. 1) demonstrates that the model is accurate. Concordantly, both working and free R-factors (38Brünger A.T. Nature. 1992; 355: 472-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (3872) Google Scholar) are very low (Table 1), indicating that the structure is well refined and of high quality. A total of six monomers, arranged into two almost identical trimers, are present in the asymmetric unit of the crystals. A ribbon tracing of one trimer is shown in Fig. 1B. Each σ1 monomer is composed of an eight-stranded β-barrel. The overall conformation of the monomers is very similar, with the exception of two longer and presumably flexible loops: the G-H loop at the top of each monomer and the D-E loop at its base. With the exception of His-388, all σ1 residues occupy allowed regions in the Ramachandran diagram (24Collaborative Computational Project Number 4Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19797) Google Scholar). However, since the density corresponding to His-388 is unambiguous, it appears that a salt bridge to Glu-348 fixes its side chain in its observed conformation. Asp-345 is located in the generously allowed region of the Ramachandran diagram; it forms, together with Asp-346, a β-hairpin between β-strands B and C (supplemental Fig. 1). The dihedral angles classify this region as a type II′ β-hairpin (26Sibanda B.L. Thornton J.M. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 202: 59-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Contacts in the σ1 Trimer—Trimer formation buries from solvent an area of 2292 Å2 per monomer. Residues in the tail account for about 25% of this area, primarily through hydrophobic interactions between the strands of the β-spiral. The three β-barrel domains that form the head engage in a more complex pattern of interactions. Multiple contacts between the subunits at the outer edges of each monomer result in binding surfaces that extend from the base of the head to its top (Fig. 2A). However, a large cavity exists at the center of the trimer, and this cavity is surrounded by smaller regions that lack intersubunit contacts (Fig. 2A). The central cavity measures ∼15 Å in height and ∼10 Å in width and contains a large number of ordered water molecules that are connected to the exterior surface through channels at the top of the trimer (Fig. 2B). The cavity probably also contains many less well ordered water molecules, which are not visible in our electron density maps. Dimensions of the channels leading toward the cavity suggest that water molecules can flow freely to the top of the trimer. In contrast, the bottom of the cavity is sealed by the three Tyr-347 side chains. The Aspartic Acid Sandwich—An unusual cluster of aspartic acid residues lies just below the water-filled cavity. Each monomer contributes two aspartic acid residues, Asp-345 and Asp-346, to this cluster, giving rise to a total of six aspartic acid side chains that are arranged in close proximity. Asp-345 and Asp-346 are located at the very tip of a β-hairpin between β-strands B and C (Fig. 3, A and B). β-Hairpins are small structural motifs stabilized by a defined backbone hydrogen bond pattern (27Blanco F. Ramírez-Alvarado M. Serrano L. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1998; 8: 107-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). The hairpins of the three monomers face each other, with the side chains of Asp-345 making key contacts. The aspartic acids are partitioned between two layers that each contain three tyrosine residues, Tyr-347 at the top and Tyr-313 at the bottom (Fig. 3, C and D). Each Asp-346 side chain forms a salt bridge with Arg-314 from a neighboring monomer, but the Asp-345 side chains are not engaged in any ionic interactions (with other residues or with cations) that would negate their negative charges. The accumulation of three negative charges in such a hydrophobic environment would be highly unfavorable. Although hydrogen atoms cannot be seen in our electron density maps even at the high resolution obtained (1.75 Å), the location and orientation of the carboxyl groups strongly suggests that they are protonated. A protonated state of Asp-345 is also suggested by molecular dynamics studies of σ1 (17Cavalli A. Prota A.E. Stehle T. Dermody T.S. Recanatini M. Folkers G. Scapozza L. Biophys. J. 2004; 86: 3423-3431Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Each protonated carboxylate forms two hydrogen bonds. One of these involves the hydrogen atom of the Asp-345 carboxyl group and the carbonyl oxygen of a neighboring Asp-346 residue; a second is formed between the carbonyl oxygen and the backbone amide group of Asp-346 in a neighboring monomer. Since these two hydrogen bonds occur three times, and since there are few other hydrogen bonds involved in head trimerization, the aspartic acid sandwich likely makes a major contribution to trimer stability. The cluster of aspartic acids is sandwiched between hydrophobic residues that block access of solvent molecules to the carboxylate groups. One side of this sandwich (the “top” in Fig. 3D) is formed by Val-344 and Tyr-347, the other (the “bottom” in Fig. 3D) is formed by Tyr-313 and Met-309. Two well ordered water molecules located directly on the 3-fold axis are also present in this arrangement of amino acids. These water molecules interact with Tyr-313 and Asp-345, respectively, and they are held in place by an extensive hydrogen bond network. Buried water molecules can sometimes be exchanged without major unfolding. However, residues in the immediate vicinity of the two water molecules have temperature factors that are among the lowest of the entire structure (supplemental Fig. 2), suggesting that thermal mobility is low in this area. Thus, it is unlikely that the water molecules can be exchanged. Purification and Characterization of σ1 Y313A—To explore potential conformational changes of σ1, we generated substitutions of two key residues of the cluster, Tyr-313 (Y313A) and Asp-345 (D345N). The mutant proteins were analyzed for receptor binding properties and the capacity to form trimers. We reasoned that substitution of Tyr-313 with a smaller amino acid might allow influx of water molecules to the aspartic acid cluster, thereby causing the trimer to undergo structural changes triggered by charged Asp-345 side chains. The σ1-Y313A mutant protein was expressed as a GST fusion in bacteria, purified by glutathione affinity, proteolytically cleaved from the GST tag on-column, and further purified using gel filtration. Purified σ1-Y313A is soluble and elutes as a monomer by gel filtration chromatography (Fig. 4A). Treatment of σ1-Y313A with each of three different cross-linking reagents of various lengths (11.4 to 16.1 Å) failed to alter the chromatographic mobility of the mutant protein (data not shown). σ1-Y313A was incapable of binding to JAM-A by either gel filtration (data not shown) or surface plasmon resonance (Fig. 4B), indicating that a trimeric form of σ1 is required for JAM-A engagement. Circular dichroism spectra of σ1-Y313A show a secondary structure content similar to that of wild-type σ1, suggesting that σ1-Y313A is folded properly (data not shown). Thus, our results indicate that residue Tyr313 is required for trimerization and that the trimeric form of σ1 is essential for receptor binding. Characterization and Structure Analysis of σ1 D345N—To determine whether structural and functional changes occur upon replacement of Asp-345 with asparagine, we engineered a D345N mutation in the wild-type T3D σ1 head construct. We anticipated that hydrogen bonds might form between the asparagine residues, stabilizing the trimer interface in much the same manner as accomplished by the protonated Asp-345 side chains. The mutant protein was purified using the strategy employed for purification of the wild-type T3D σ1 head domain. The σ1-D345N mutant forms trimers at neutral pH (Fig. 4A) and binds to JAM-A with an affinity similar to that of wild-type σ1 (Fig. 4B). Thus, σ1-D345N is biochemically and functionally indistinguishable from the wild-type protein. To test whether the D345N mutation in the T3D σ1 head domain alters the conformation of the aspartic acid sandwich, we determined the structure of σ1-D345N. The mutant protein was crystallized using conditions similar to those employed to crystallize the wild-type protein. We collected a complete data set from the σ1-D345N crystals to 1.85 Å and solved the structure by molecular replacement using the wildtype protein structure as a model (Table 1). The σ1-D345N mutant crystallized as a trimer with a structure that is nearly identical to that of the wild-type T3D σ1 head domain (Fig. 1B). At the subunit interface, the two water molecules observed just above and below residues 345 are at almost exactly the same position in σ1-D345N (Fig. 5). The amino groups of Asn-345 form the same hydrogen bond pattern as the hydroxyl group of protonated Asp-345. Thus, the mutant structure provides evidence that in trimeric, wild-type σ1 all Asp-345 residues must be protonated. Formation of σ1 Trimers—Although a C-terminal fragment of σ1 has been crystallized (6Chappell J.D. Prota A. Dermody T.S. Stehle T. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), further characterization at an atomic level of resolution has enhanced an understanding of its trimeric nature. Interactions that form the trimer are highly complex. The base of the trimer is held firmly together by hydrophobic interactions, a standard means of inducing the formation of oligomeric structures. In contrast, contacts at the center and top of the trimer involve interrupted surfaces, cavities filled with water molecules, trapped individual water molecules, very few hydrophobic contacts, and protonated side chains that form hydrogen bonds. These types of interactions are unusual for protein-protein contacts. We think that the σ1 head is designed to exist as both monomeric and trimeric species. In fact, the mutation of only one residue, Y313A, results in soluble, folded protein that is entirely monomeric. A single substitution at the base of the t"
https://openalex.org/W2044966091,"In human, nine aminoacyl tRNA synthetases are associated with the three auxiliary proteins, p18, p38, and p43, to form a stable multiprotein complex. The p43 component, which has a potent tRNA binding capacity, is associated to the complex via its N-terminal moiety. This protein is also the precursor of the endothelial monocyte-activating polypeptide II (p43(EMAPII), corresponding to the C-terminal moiety of p43), a cytokine generated during apoptosis. Here we examined the cellular pathway that, starting from the p43 subunit of the complex, leads to this extracellular cytokine. We identified a new intermediate in this pathway, named p43(ARF) for Apoptosis-released Factor. This intermediate is produced in cellulo by proteolytic cleavage of endogenous p43 and is rapidly recovered in the culture medium. This p43 derivative was purified from the medium of human U937 cells subjected to serum starvation. It contains 40 additional N-terminal amino acid residues as compared with the cytokine p43(EMAPII) and may be generated by a member of the matrix metalloproteinase family. Recombinant p43(ARF) is a monomer in solution and binds tRNA with a Kd of ∼6nm, 30-fold lower than that of p43. Highly purified p43(ARF) or p43(EMAPII) do not stimulate the expression of E-selectin by human umbilical vein endothelial cells. Our results suggest that the cleavage of p43 and its cellular delocalization, and thus the release of this tRNA binding subunit from the complex, is one of the molecular mechanisms leading to the shut down of protein synthesis in apoptosis.

Protein synthesis is essential for cell growth. In cells undergoing apoptosis, the translation process is rapidly inhibited and correlates with caspase-dependent cleavage of the eukaryotic translation initiation factors eIF3, eIF4B, and eIF4G (1Morley S.J. Coldwell M.J. Clemens M.J. Cell Death Differ. 2005; 12: 571-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) and with phosphorylation of eIF2α (2Saelens X. Kalai M. Vandenabeele P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41620-41628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Inhibition of protein synthesis by addition of cycloheximide to culture cells also promotes apoptosis. Translation is not completely inhibited at early stages of apoptosis. For instance, the mRNA encoding antiapoptotic proteins XIAP or c-Myc may be produced, allowing cell recovery during the process of programmed cell death. By contrast, translation is not inhibited during the process of necrotic cell death (3Saelens X. Festjens N. Parthoens E. Vanoverberghe I. Kalai M. van Kuppeveld F. Vandenabeele P. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 168: 545-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Although modification of translation initiation factors seems to be one of the primary steps of regulation of translation in apoptotic cells, other components of the protein synthesis machinery, including aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, are also the target of apoptotic proteases (4Knies U.E.

The presence of p43, or of p43-related proteins, in the cytoplasm but also in the nucleus of rabbit kidney cells has been observed by immunoelectron microscopy (11Popenko V.I. Ivanova J.L.

The mature p43(EMAPII) has been ascribed to a proinflammatory cytokine that stimulates chemotactic migration of polymorphonuclear granulocytes and mononuclear phagocytes and induces tissue factor activity on endothelial cells. Whether p43(EMAPII) or its precursor, the p43 component of MARS, is the real cytokine remains controversial (13Kao J. Houck K. Fan Y. Haehnel I. Libutti S.K. Kayton M.L. Grikscheit T. Chabot J.

We previously reported that the p43 component of MARS is a substrate for caspase 7 (5Shalak V. Kaminska M. Mitnacht-Kraus R. Vandenabeele P. Clauss M. Mirande M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23769-23776Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), but other data also indicated that p43 may not be primarily cleaved by this apoptotic protease (18Liu J. Schwarz M.A. Exp. Cell Res. 2006; 312: 2231-2237Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), suggesting that the maturation of p43 into p43(EMAPII) may involve intermediate maturation stages. In this report, we investigated the pathway of p43 cleavage during apoptosis, we identified and characterized a new intermediate referred to as p43(ARF) for Apoptosis-released Factor, and analyzed the subcellular localization and the putative functions of p43, p43(ARF), and p43(EMAPII) during development of apoptosis. Cell Culture and Induction of Apoptosis—The 32D murine myeloid precursor cell line (gift from Matthias Clauss, Max-Planck-Institut, Bad Nauheim, Germany) is dependent on an exogenous supply of IL-3 for growth (19Baffy G. Miyashita T. Williamson J.R. Reed J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6511-6519Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 32D cells were grown in RPMI medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS), 2 mm glutamine, 100 μg/ml of penicillin and streptomycin, and 10% conditioned medium derived from the IL-3-producing cell line WEHI. To induce apoptosis, cells were washed three times in the same medium lacking conditioned medium and incubated in the same medium for the times indicated. The human promonocytic cell line U937 (American Type Culture Collection) was grown in RPMI medium supplemented with 10% FCS and 2 mm glutamine, 100 μg/ml of penicillin and streptomycin, and induced to undergo apoptosis by serum withdrawal. Development of apoptosis was assessed by DNA fragmentation analysis (20Herr I. Wilhelm D. Bohler T. Angel P. Debatin K.M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6200-6208Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar), and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage. Cell survival was determined by the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide MTT assay (Sigma) and cell death by the trypan blue (0.05%) exclusion assay. Cell extracts and culture media were analyzed by Western blotting. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) were grown as previously described (21Wautier J.L. Paton R.C. Wautier M.P. Pintigny D. Abadie E. Passa P. Caen J.P. N. Engl. J. Med. 1981; 305: 237-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). After digestion by collagenase, HUVEC were cultured in M199 containing human AB serum (15% v/v) until confluence. Antibodies and Western Blot Analysis—Monoclonal antibodies directed to poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase and to GFP were from BD Biosciences. Polyclonal anti-p43(EMAPII) antibodies have been described previously (5Shalak V. Kaminska M. Mitnacht-Kraus R. Vandenabeele P. Clauss M. Mirande M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23769-23776Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Western blot analyses were conducted with goat anti-rabbit or goat anti-mouse secondary antibodies conjugated with peroxidase (Chemicon) and the ECL detection reagents (Amersham Biosciences). Determination of E-selectin Expression—Endothelial cell E-selectin expression was measured as described previously (22Wautier M.P. Chappey O. Vicart P. Paulin D. Wautier J.L. Cell Biol. Toxicol. 1999; 15: 153-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Briefly, confluent HUVEC grown in 96-well microtiter plates until confluence were incubated for 4 h at 37°C in M199 medium containing 20% FCS and tumor necrosis factor α (5 ng/ml; 0.3 nm) or p43, p43(ARF), and p43(EMAPII) appropriately diluted in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, and 0.01% Tween 20. Cells were washed once with M199 medium supplemented with 10% FCS, incubated with monoclonal antibodies directed to E-selectin (R&D Systems) in RPMI medium supplemented with 10% FCS for 1 h on ice, washed four times in the same medium, incubated for 1 h on ice in the same medium containing 125I-labeled anti-mouse IgG (Amersham Biosciences), and washed four times before measuring the radioactivity. Inducible Expression of p43 in U937 Cells—The cDNAs encoding p43, p43(ARF), or p43(EMAPII) were introduced between the BamHI and XbaI sites of the pTRE2hyg vector under the control of the tetracycline-response element (BD Biosciences). U937 Tet-Off (U937TO) cells grown in RPMI medium supplemented with 10% FCS and G418 at 0.3 mg/ml were transfected with Effectene (Qiagen). Stable transformants were isolated by selection with hygromycin, in the presence of tetracycline (transcription from the Tet-responsive element is turned off). Expression of the recombinant proteins was turned on by removal of tetracycline from the culture medium. Stably transfected cells were cultured in the absence of FCS to induce apoptosis and stained with the vital dye 7-amino-actinomycin D (7-AAD) and with Annexin V-PE (BD Biosciences) and subjected to FACS analysis (PAS-III; Partec) to identify early apoptotic cells (Annexin V-PE-positive and 7-AAD-negative). Purification of p43(ARF) from the Supernatant of U937 Apoptotic Cells—U937 cells (109 cells) growing in RPMI medium containing 10% FCS were washed three times in RPMI without FCS and incubated in serum-free RPMI medium for 5 days at 37 °C. Cell culture medium was centrifuged at 40,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C, diluted 1.5-fold by addition of 60 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, and 0.03% Tween 20, and directly applied to a Mono S HR 5/5 column. Elution was achieved by a linear gradient (60-column volume) of NaCl from 0 to 300 mm in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 2 mm DTT, and 0.01% Tween 20. Fractions containing p43(ARF), detected by Western blotting, were dialyzed (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 2 mm DTT, and 0.01% Tween 20), applied to a Mono Q HR 5/5 column equilibrated in the same buffer, and eluted by a linear gradient (40-column volume) of NaCl from 0 to 250 mm. Fractions containing p43(ARF) were dialyzed (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 2 mm DTT, and 0.01% Tween 20), applied to a Mini S PE 4.6/50 column equilibrated in the same buffer, and eluted by a linear gradient (50-column volume) of NaCl from 0 to 300 mm. Fractions containing p43(ARF) were concentrated by ultrafiltration (Vivaspin 500, 5000 MWCO) and subjected to N-terminal amino acid sequence analysis by automated Edman degradation. Protein Overexpression and Purification—The cDNA fragment encoding p43(ARF) was produced by PCR with oligonucleotides 5′-cccccatggctggtaccaaagaacagataa and 5′-cccctcgagttatttgattccactgttgctca and inserted into the NcoI-XhoI sites of the bacterial expression vector pET-28b (Novagen) to give pET/p43(ARF). The construct was verified by DNA sequencing. The protein encoded by pET/p43(ARF) was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) grown in Luria Bertani medium supplemented with kanamycin (50 μg/ml). Culture (1.5 liters) was grown at 37 °C to an A600 = 0.5, transferred at 28 °C, and expression was induced by addition of 1 mm isopropyl 1-thioβ-d-galactopyranoside for 4 h. Cells were washed twice with ice-cold extraction buffer (30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 30 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 2 mm DTT), resuspended in 23 ml of the same buffer containing 1 mm diisopropyl-fluorophosphate, and sonicated. All subsequent steps were conducted at 4 °C. After centrifugation at 18,000 × g for 30 min, the clear supernatant was applied to a 33-ml S-Sepharose FF column (Amersham Biosciences). p43(ARF) was eluted by a linear gradient (25-column volume) of NaCl from 50 to 350 mm in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, containing 1 mm DTT. After extensive dialysis against 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, and 1 mm DTT, fractions were applied to a 25-ml Q-Sepharose FF column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated in the same buffer. The flowthrough fraction was recovered and immediately applied to a 30-ml Source 15S column equilibrated in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT and eluted by a linear gradient (23-column volume) of NaCl from 50 to 300 mm. Fractions containing p43(ARF) were concentrated by ultrafiltration, dialyzed against 25 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, 2 mm DTT, 55% glycerol, and stored at –20 °C at a protein concentration of ∼30 mg/ml. Protein concentration was determined by using a calculated absorption coefficient of 0.35 A280 units·mg–1·cm2. Sedimentation Equilibrium—Ultra-centrifugation experiments were conducted as described previously (23Agou F. Waller J.P. Mirande M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29295-29303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) in a Beckman Optima XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge, using a 60 Ti rotor and a double sector cell of 12-mm path length. Equilibrium was verified from the superimposition of duplicate scans recorded at 4-h intervals. The experimental sedimentation equilibrium data were fitted to a model for a single homogeneous species following Equation 1 c(r)=c(rref)exp{[Mr(1-v¯ρ)ω2/2RT](r2-rref2)}(Eq.1) where c(r) is the protein concentration at radial position r, c(rref) is the concentration of the protein at an arbitrary reference radial distance rref, Mr is the molecular mass, and v̄ the partial specific volume (0.733 at 4 °C for p43(ARF)) of the solute, ρ is the density of the solvent, ω is the angular velocity of the rotor, and R and T are the molar gas constant and the absolute temperature, respectively. Gel Retardation Assay—Protein-tRNA interactions were assayed using a band shift assay as previously described (5Shalak V. Kaminska M. Mitnacht-Kraus R. Vandenabeele P. Clauss M. Mirande M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23769-23776Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The genes for human tRNA Arg2, for rabbit elongator tRNAMet, or for minihelices corresponding to the acceptor-TΨC stem-loop domain of these two tRNAs, placed under the control of the T7 polymerase promoter, were subjected to in vitro transcription as described (10Guigou L. Shalak V. Mirande M. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 4592-4600Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 24Kaminska M. Shalak V. Mirande M. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 14309-14316Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Briefly, 32P-labeled tRNAs were synthesized in a reaction mixture (50 μl) containing 1 μg of linearized template DNA, 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 6 mm MgCl2, 1 mm spermidine, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.01% Triton X-100, 1 mm each CTP, UTP, and GTP, 10 μm [α-32P]ATP (200 Ci/mmol), 1000 units/ml T7 RNA polymerase. After incubation at 37 °C for 1 h, the transcripts were purified by electrophoresis on a denaturing 12% polyacrylamide gel (mono:bis, 19:1), recovered from the gel by soaking in H2O, precipitated with ethanol, and resuspended in 5 mm MgCl2. Transcripts were renatured by heating at 90 °C and slow cooling (90 to 30 °C in 2 h). Homogeneous protein was incubated at increasing concentrations with radiolabeled tRNA in an 11-μl volume containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol, and bovine serum albumin at 0.1 mg/ml. After incubation at 25 °C for 30 min, the mixture was placed on ice and loaded on a 6% polyacrylamide gel (mono: bis, 29:1) containing 5% glycerol in 0.5× Tris borate-EDTA at 4 °C. After electrophoresis, the gel was fixed, dried, and subjected to autoradiography. Free and bound tRNA were quantified by densitometry analysis. Because the amount of labeled transcripts added in the assays was negligible compared with the amount of protein added, concentration of protein at which half of the tRNA formed a complex corresponded to the apparent Kd value of the complex. Confocal Imaging—The cDNAs encoding human p43 and its derivatives were introduced between the EcoRI and BamHI sites of pEGFP-N1 (BD Biosciences). HeLa-ST cells were grown in F12 medium supplemented with 10% FCS. Cells were transfected with Effectene (Qiagen). Cells were grown in 8-well Lab-Tek II chambers (Nalge Nunc International) and observed by confocal laser scanning microscopy using a Leica TCS SP2 confocal microscope. Release of p43(ARF) during Apoptosis—When murine 32D cells were subjected to apoptosis by IL-3 deprivation, p43(EMAPII) was recovered in the culture medium (Fig. 1) as reported previously (4Knies U.E. Behrensdorf H.A. Mitchell C.A. Deutsch U. Risau W. Drexler H.C. Clauss M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12322-12327Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The release of mature p43(EMAPII) is observed after 16–20 h of IL-3 withdrawal. However, several other p43-related polypeptides, the native p43 polypeptide and a proteolytic intermediate of ∼26–28 kDa, were also observed in the culture medium (Fig. 1). We also detected the presence of other proteins in the culture medium, including the 76-kDa species of ArgRS, an integral component of MARS, 12 h after onset of apoptosis (results not shown). The finding that the matured form of p43, p43(EMAPII), but also the p43 and ArgRS proteins that are integral components of the MARS complex, were found in the culture medium but were not subjected to proteolysis suggested that cytolysis also occurred in the population of apoptotic 32D cells. Accordingly, ∼30–40% of the cells were permeable to trypan blue after 12 h of IL-3 starvation, as observed previously (19Baffy G. Miyashita T. Williamson J.R. Reed J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6511-6519Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the presence of p43(EMAPII) in the culture medium could be attributed either to secretion from apoptotic cells or to leakage from permeable necrotic cells. Therefore, we looked for a cell type where cytolysis would not rapidly occur after onset of apoptosis. The human promonocytic U937 cell line undergoes apoptosis before cytolysis occurs (25Wright S.C. Kumar P. Tam A.W. Shen N. Varma M. Larrick J.W. J. Cell. Biochem. 1992; 48: 344-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). When U937 cells were subjected to serum starvation, DNA fragmentation and cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, two landmarks of apoptosis, occurred after 52–68 h of serum withdrawal (Fig. 2). The viability of the cells, measured by the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay, decreased after 52 h of starvation but the extent of dead cells that did not exclude trypan blue remained constant after more than 100 h of incubation (Fig. 2). In the meantime, antibodies directed to p43(EMAPII) were used to monitor the level of p43 in cell extracts prepared at different times of starvation. The p43 content of U937 cells drastically decreased after 92 h of serum deprivation, and a single polypeptide of ∼26 kDa could be detected in the culture medium after 52–68 h of onset of apoptosis (Fig. 2). This polypeptide was distinct from p43(EMAPII) used as a marker. Only trace amounts of this polypeptide could be observed in the cellular fraction. By contrast with 32D cells, no polypeptide related to ArgRS, a marker of MARS, was detected in the culture medium fraction (results not shown). These results clearly showed that the p43 component of MARS is subjected to proteolysis during progression of apoptosis and that a degradation product is released in the culture supernatant. This degradation product of p43 was named p43(ARF), for Apoptosis-released Factor. No p43(EMAPII) degradation product could be detected in the culture medium of U937 cells subjected to apoptosis. Purification and Structural Characterization of p43(ARF)—To characterize the p43 derivative generated during apoptosis, a 800-ml culture containing 109 U937 cells was subjected to serum withdrawal for 5 days and p43(ARF) was purified from the cell culture supernatant following three chromatographic steps on MonoS, MonoQ, and MiniS PE columns. The elution of p43(ARF) was monitored by Western blotting with antibodies directed to p43(EMAPII). About 0.2 μg of p43(ARF) was isolated and its N-terminal sequence was determined by automatic Edman degradation. The sequence SGTKEQIKGG was obtained and exactly matched the sequence of human p43 from residues 107 to 116. The calculated molecular mass of p43(ARF) is 22.5 kDa, in reasonably good agreement with the apparent mass of 26 kDa estimated by SDS-PAGE. The recombinant p43(ARF) protein produced in E. coli displayed an electrophoretic mobility similar to p43(ARF) isolated from the supernatant of U937 cells. The discrepancy between the observed and calculated masses is certainly related to the aberrant migration of p43, which also displays an apparent molecular mass of 43 kDa for a calculated mass of 34 kDa. We showed previously that caspase 7, an apoptotic protease, is able to convert in vitro p43 into p43(EMAPII) (5Shalak V. Kaminska M. Mitnacht-Kraus R. Vandenabeele P. Clauss M. Mirande M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23769-23776Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The sequence of cleavage of p43 into p43(ARF) (103TTVS↓SGTK110) does not correspond to any consensus cleavage site for a protease of the caspase family. Matrix metalloproteinases, including macrophage elastase, correspond to a family of proteases that possess a broad capacity to cleave components of the extracellular matrix but also non-matrix proteins that regulate in cellulo a variety of biological processes (26Nagase H. Visse R. Murphy G. Cardiovasc. Res. 2006; 69: 562-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (2432) Google Scholar). Recombinant p43 and the MARS complex were subjected to controlled proteolytic digestion by elastase (Fig. 3). In both cases, the free and MARS-associated forms of p43 were cleaved by elastase to give a polypeptide of ∼26 kDa, comigrating with recombinant p43(ARF), which was resistant to further proteolysis. The N-terminal amino acid sequence, SXGTKE, of the polypeptide recovered after elastase digestion of recombinant p43 was determined by Edman degradation. It is located 1 amino acid residue upstream of the N-terminal sequence of p43(ARF) isolated from apoptotic U937 cells. This suggests that, in vivo, elastase could be involved in processing p43 into p43(ARF), with the additional release of the N-terminal Ser residue by an aminopeptidase. Alternatively, another member of the large matrix metalloproteinase family with a slightly different specificity might be involved in the processing of p43 into p43(ARF). Whatever the protease involved in the cleavage, our data show that this segment of p43 is freely accessible. Recombinant p43(ARF) was expressed in E. coli from the pET28b plasmid but without a His tag. Indeed, because the calculated isoelectric point of p43(ARF) is very basic (pI of 8.72), the protein eluted from the sulfopropyl cation exchanger at a NaCl concentration of 260 mm was already more than 80% homogeneous. The purified recombinant p43(ARF) is readily soluble at a protein concentration up to 30 mg/ml. It displayed an apparent molecular mass of 26 kDa by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 3). The oligomeric structure of p43(ARF) was determined by sedimentation equilibrium (Fig. 4). We previously determined that p43 is a dimer in solution, whereas p43(EMAPII) is a monomer (5Shalak V. Kaminska M. Mitnacht-Kraus R. Vandenabeele P. Clauss M. Mirande M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23769-23776Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The p43 derivative p43(EMAPII) is a compact domain based on an OB-fold structure (7Renault L. Kerjan P. Pasqualato S. Menetrey J. Robinson J.C. Kawaguchi S. Vassylyev D.G. Yokoyama S. Mirande M. Cherfils J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 570-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). When p43(ARF) was subjected to centrifugation equilibrium at an initial protein concentration of 33 μm, experimental data could be fitted to a single species with a molecular mass of 22,641 ± 812 Da. The monodispersity of p43(ARF) in solution, bearing a 40-amino acid residue extension as compared with p43(EMAPII), containing 12 Lys residues, suggests that p43(ARF) is a discrete entity with a well defined structural organization. Taking into account a calculated molecular mass of 22,504 Da for the monomer, we concluded that p43(ARF) is a monomer in solution. Thus, the site of dimerization of p43 is comprised within the first 106 amino acid residues of the protein. The tRNA Binding Potential of p43(ARF)—Recombinant p43, the precursor of p43(ARF), has the capacity to bind tRNA with a dissociation constant Kd of ∼0.2 μm, as determined by a gel retardation assay (5Shalak V. Kaminska M. Mitnacht-Kraus R. Vandenabeele P. Clauss M. Mirande M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23769-23776Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). By co"
https://openalex.org/W2058169847,"Background The mesoderm of the amphibian embryo is formed through an inductive interaction in which vegetal cells of the blastula-staged embryo act on overlying equatorial cells. Candidate mesoderm-inducing factors include members of the transforming growth factor type β family such as Vg1, activin B, the nodal-related proteins and derrière. Methodology and Principle Findings Microarray analysis reveals different functions for activin B and the nodal-related proteins during early Xenopus development. Inhibition of nodal-related protein function causes the down-regulation of regionally expressed genes such as chordin, dickkopf and XSox17α/β, while genes that are mis-regulated in the absence of activin B tend to be more widely expressed and, interestingly, include several that are involved in cell cycle regulation. Consistent with the latter observation, cells of the involuting dorsal axial mesoderm, which normally undergo cell cycle arrest, continue to proliferate when the function of activin B is inhibited. Conclusions/Significance These observations reveal distinct functions for these two classes of the TGF-β family during early Xenopus development, and in doing so identify a new role for activin B during gastrulation."
https://openalex.org/W2044355536,"Dictyostelium amoebae faced with starvation trigger a developmental program during which many cells aggregate and form fruiting bodies that consist of a ball of spores held aloft by a thin stalk. This developmental strategy is open to several forms of exploitation, including the remarkable case of Dictyostelium caveatum, which, even when it constitutes 1/103 of the cells in an aggregate, can inhibit the development of the host and eventually devour it. We show that it accomplishes this feat by inhibiting a region of cells, called the tip, which organizes the development of the aggregate into a fruiting body. We use live-cell microscopy to define the D. caveatum developmental cycle and to show that D. caveatum amoebae have the capacity to ingest amoebae of other Dictyostelid species, but do not attack each other. The block in development induced by D. caveatum does not affect the expression of specific markers of prespore cell or prestalk cell differentiation, but does stop the coordinated cell movement leading to tip formation. The inhibition mechanism involves the constitutive secretion of a small molecule by D. caveatum and is reversible. Four Dictyostelid species were inhibited in their development, while D. caveatum is not inhibited by its own compound(s). D. caveatum has evolved a predation strategy to exploit other members of its genus, including mechanisms of developmental inhibition and specific phagocytosis."
https://openalex.org/W2075567747,"Developmental proteins play a pivotal role in the origin of animal complexity and diversity. We report here the identification of a highly divergent developmental protein superfamily (DANGER), which originated before the emergence of animals (approximately 850 million years ago) and experienced major expansion-contraction events during metazoan evolution. Sequence analysis demonstrates that DANGER proteins diverged via multiple mechanisms, including amino acid substitution, intron gain and/or loss, and recombination. Divergence for DANGER proteins is substantially greater than for the prototypic member of the superfamily (Mab-21 family) and other developmental protein families (e.g., WNT proteins). DANGER proteins are widely expressed and display species-dependent tissue expression patterns, with many members having roles in development. DANGER1A, which regulates the inositol trisphosphate receptor, promotes the differentiation and outgrowth of neuronal processes. Regulation of development may be a universal function of DANGER family members. This family provides a model system to investigate how rapid protein divergence contributes to morphological complexity."
https://openalex.org/W2130360100,"The transcriptional activator CprK1 from Desulfitobacterium-hafniense, a member of the ubiquitous cAMP receptor protein/fumarate nitrate reduction regulatory protein family, activates transcription of genes encoding proteins involved in reductive dehalogenation of chlorinated aromatic compounds. 3-Chloro-4-hydroxyphenylacetate is a known effector for CprK1, which interacts tightly with the protein, and induces binding to a specific DNA sequence (“dehalobox,” TTAAT—-ATTAA) located in the promoter region of chlorophenol reductive dehalogenase genes. Despite the availability of recent x-ray structures of two CprK proteins in distinct states, the mechanism by which CprK1 activates transcription is poorly understood. In the present study, we have investigated the mechanism of CprK1 activation and its effector specificity. By using macromolecular native mass spectrometry and DNA binding assays, analogues of 3-chloro-4-hydroxyphenylacetate that have a halogenated group at the ortho position and a chloride or acetic acid group at the para position were found to be potent effectors for CprK1. By using limited proteolysis it was demonstrated that CprK1 requires a cascade of structural events to interact with dehalobox dsDNA. Upon reduction of the intermolecular disulfide bridge in oxidized CprK1, the protein becomes more dynamic, but this alone is not sufficient for DNA binding. Activation of CprK1 is a typical example of allosteric regulation; the binding of a potent effector molecule to reduced CprK1 induces local changes in the N-terminal effector binding domain, which subsequently may lead to changes in the hinge region and as such to structural changes in the DNA binding domain that are required for specific DNA binding.

Halogenated hydrocarbons are often toxic molecules. They are widespread environmental pollutants because of their numerous applications, for example in industry (degreasers), agriculture (pesticides), and private households (flame retardants). Although these compounds are generally very stable, they can be converted in many sediments and soils by reductive dehalogenation. Several strictly anaerobic bacteria capable of dehalogenation have been isolated including Desulfomonile, Dehalobacter, and Desulfitobacterium. These organisms use chlorinated compounds as terminal electron acceptors (halorespiration) and thus remove the chloride atom while energy is conserved via electron transport phosphorylation (1Smidt H. de Vos W.M. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2004; 58: 43-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar, 2El Fantroussi S. Naveau H. Agathos S.N. Biotechnol.

The prospect of using these organisms in bioremediation of sediments contaminated with a variety of chlorinated aromatic compounds is promising. Desulfitobacterium dehalogenans can reductively dechlorinate phenolic compounds at the ortho position (4Utkin I. Woese C. Wiegel J. Int. J. Syst.

Licht D. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1992; 58: 2874-2878Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A large number of the proteins involved in halorespiration are encoded in the chlorophenol reductive dehalogenase (cpr) gene cluster, which contains cprTK1ZEBA1C open reading frames in D. hafniense. The product of the cprA1 gene, a 3-chloro-4-hydroxyphenylacetate (CHPA) reductive dehalogenase has been isolated and characterized from D. hafniense (8Christiansen N. Ahring B.K. Wohlfarth G. Diekert G. FEBS Lett. 1998; 436: 159-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). It was found that the cprA1 gene is induced by the electron acceptor CHPA. The activation by CHPA is carried out at the transcription level by CprK1, a transcriptional activator protein that is encoded in the same cpr gene cluster. CprK1 is a member of the CRP/FNR (cAMP receptor protein/fumarate nitrate reduction regulatory protein) family of regulators that is ubiquitous in bacteria (9Smidt H. van Leest M. van der Oost J. de Vos W.M. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 5683-5691Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). CrpK1 from D. hafniense binds to a specific DNA sequence (“dehalobox,” TTAAT—-ATTAA), located in the promoter region of several cpr genes including cprA1, with high affinity in the presence of CHPA. This enables the recruitment of RNA polymerase, which then proceeds with transcription of the corresponding genes (10Gábor K. Veríssimo C.S. Cyran B.C. Ter Horst P. Meijer N.P.

Previously, a close homologue called CprK was identified in the related halorespiring bacterium, D. dehalogenans, which shows 91% sequence identity with CprK1 from D. hafniense. Upon binding of CHPA, CprK activates transcription of dehalobox-containing promoters in D. dehalogenans (11Pop S.M. Gupta N. Raza A.S. Ragsdale S.W. J. Biol.

DNA binding studies have shown that CprK1 and CprK are only capable of binding its target DNA when the protein is in its reduced state (10Gábor K. Veríssimo C.S. Cyran B.C. Ter Horst P. Meijer N.P.

Recently, the x-ray structures of oxidized CprK1 from D. hafniense in complex with CHPA and reduced CprK from D. dehalogenans in its unliganded form have been determined by Joyce et al. (13Joyce M.G. Levy C. Gábor K. Pop S.M. Biehl B.D. Doukov T.I. Ryter J.M. Mazon H. Smidt H. van den Heuvel R.H. Ragsdale S.W. van der Oost J. Leys D. J. Biol.

They reveal that both CprKs exhibit high structural similarity to the cAMP receptor protein (CRP) (14Harman J.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1547: 1-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 15Fic E. Polit A. Wasylewski Z.

Microbiol. 2005; 56: 433-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Two identical subunits form an asymmetric dimer with each monomer folded in two distinct domains: the N-terminal effector binding domain and the C-terminal DNA binding domain. The dimer interface of CprK1 is predominantly made up by the central α-helices connecting the effector binding domain with the DNA binding domain containing a helixturn-helix motif. An intermolecular disulfide bond between Cys11 and Cys200 connects the effector binding domain to the DNA binding helix of the opposite monomer. In addition to this intermolecular disulfide bond, CrpK from D. dehalogenans, but not CprK1 from D. hafniense, has an intramolecular disulfide bond between Cys105, which is conserved in FNR and most other CprK homologs and Cys111 (11Pop S.M.

Chem. 2004; 279: 49910-49918Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In the x-ray structure of liganded oxidized CprK1 from D. hafniense, one CHPA molecule is bound per subunit in the β-barrel of the effector binding domain. The observed binding site is similar in position to the binding site of cAMP (3′, 5′-cyclic adenosine monophosphate) in CRP (13Joyce M.G. Levy C. Gábor K. Pop S.M. Biehl B.D. Doukov T.I. Ryter J.M.

This structure is not compatible with tight binding to dehalobox dsDNA. In the crystal structure of unliganded reduced CprK from D. dehalogenans, the C-terminal DNA binding domains dimerize extending to overall dimer interface, while similar DNA binding contacts are made between individual CprK dimers in the oxidized structure. Therefore, this structure is also not compatible with DNA binding. Comparison of the two crystal structures allowed us to postulate that the binding of CHPA to CprK1 causes reorientation of the N-terminal β-barrels with respect to the central α-helix at the dimer interface and with conformational changes in the C-terminal DNA binding domains as a consequence (13Joyce M.G. Levy C. Gábor K. Pop S.M. Biehl B.D. Doukov T.I. Ryter J.M. Mazon H. Smidt H. van den Heuvel R.H. Ragsdale S.W. van der Oost J. Leys D. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 28318-28325Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The ultimate proof of this suggestion, i.e. the crystal structure of effector-bound reduced CprK1 protein is not available. The present x-ray structures thus provide high resolution structural information on CprK; however, they do not provide details about protein flexibility and do not allow the continuous monitoring of e.g. redox- and ligand- and/or DNA-induced structural changes, which might be conformational changes and/or changes in protein dynamics. Besides the fact that structural changes are caused by the binding of an effector molecule, it is also important to find the crucial features that enable these molecules to cause such changes. Both CprKs bind CHPA with micromolar affinity promoting an interaction with dehalobox dsDNA (13Joyce M.G. Levy C. Gábor K. Pop S.M. Biehl B.D. Doukov T.I. Ryter J.M. Mazon H.

On the basis of the x-ray structures, it was suggested that: (i) the presence of the chloride group in the ortho position and (ii) the pKa interrogation mechanism (formation of phenolate) allow DNA binding. Here we report for the first time on the structural changes of CprK1 that occur during the protein activation process, i.e. from the oxidized unliganded form to the reduced liganded form allowing transcriptional activation. In addition, we report on the effector specificity of CprK1. For this we used a small library of potential effector molecules known to be dehalogenated by D. dehalogenans and D. hafniense in combination with macromolecular native mass spectrometry (17van den Heuvel R.H.

Native mass spectrometry was used to study oligomerization of CprK1 and interaction with potential effectors and dehalobox dsDNA, whereas limited proteolysis was used to characterize redox- and effector-induced structural changes of CprK1. Preparation of CprK1 and Dehalobox dsDNA—CprK1 was overproduced and purified according to a previously established method, using Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) and the pET24d-derived pWUR176 expression vector (10Gábor K. Veríssimo C.S. Cyran B.C. Ter Horst P. Meijer N.P. Smidt H. de Vos W.M. van der Oost J. J. Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 2604-2613Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). CprK1 was analyzed by denaturing gel electrophoresis using a 10% (w/v) polyacrylamide gel. The gel was stained with 0.1% (v/v) Coomassie Brilliant Blue G250 for 3 min and destained overnight in 10% (v/v) acetic acid and 30% (v/v) methanol. Protein concentrations were determined using the method developed by Bradford (22Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217546) Google Scholar). The oligonucleotide pair (5′-AGGTAAAGTTAATACACATTAATACTTGCG-3′ containing an inverted repeat (dehalobox underlined) and its complementary strand) was synthesized by MWG (Ebersberg, Germany). Complementary oligonucleotides were annealed in a buffer containing 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl and 1 mm EDTA by heating to 95 °C and incubating at this temperature for 2 min, then cooling down slowly to room temperature. The sample buffer was exchanged to ultrapure water using Vivaspin 0.5 ml 3,000 Da cut-off columns (Vivascience, Germany). Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—A 52-bp DNA fragment from the promoter region of the ortho-chlorophenol reductive dehalogenase encoding cprA1 gene was PCR-amplified from D. hafniense genomic DNA using oligonucleotide primers BG1748 (5′-GGTTGAGAAATTCAGGTAAAG-3′) and BG1749 (5′-GGATCACATACGCAAGTATTAATG-3′). The resulting PCR product, which contained the TTAATacacATTAA CprK1 target sequence (dehalobox), was purified and radioactively labeled at the 5′-end as described previously (10Gábor K. Veríssimo C.S. Cyran B.C. Ter Horst P. Meijer N.P. Smidt H. de Vos W.M. van der Oost J. J. Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 2604-2613Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The reaction mixtures contained POP buffer (20% (v/v) glycerol, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 2.5 mm EDTA, 250 mm NaCl), 2.5 mm dithiothreitol, 1 μg poly(dG-dC)-poly(dG-dC), 1.5 nm 32P-labeled DNA, and 0.25 μm purified CprK1 (dimer concentration). Effector compounds, if present, were added from an aqueous stock solution to a final concentration of 6.25, 20, or 200 μm. After incubation at 24 °C for 30 min, the obtained protein-DNA complexes were separated on a nondenaturing 6% (w/v) polyacrylamide gel and electrophoresed at 10 mA constant current at 4 °C in TB buffer (89 mm Tris and 89 mm boric acid). The gels were then dried, exposed to a phosphor screen for several hours, and analyzed. Macromolecular Native Mass Spectrometry—For nanoflow electrospray mass spectrometry experiments, ultrafiltration units (ultrafree-0.5 Centrifugal Filter Device, Millipore) with a cut-off of 5,000 Da were used to exchange the buffer of CprK1 sample in 100 mm ammonium acetate, pH 8.0 (pH increased by adding ammonia). For DNA binding measurements, 5-10 mm dithiothreitol, 40-400 μm phenol derivative, 2-5 μm dehalobox dsDNA, and 4 μm Cprk1 (dimer concentration) were mixed and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. The phenols (CHPA, HPA, 2,4-DCP, 2-Br-4-CP, 2,3-DCP, 3,5-DCP, 2,4,5-TCP, and 2,4,6-TCP) were dissolved in water or in 100 mm ammonium acetate, pH 8.0. Native mass spectrometry measurements were performed in positive ion mode using an electrospray ionization time-of-flight instrument (LC-T; Micromass) equipped with a Z-spray nano-electrospray ionization source. To produce intact ions in vacuo from large complexes in solution, ions were cooled by increasing the pressure in the first vacuum stages of the mass spectrometer (23Tahallah N. Pinkse M. Maier C.S. Heck A.J. Rapid Commun. Mass Spectrom. 2001; 15: 596-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 24Krutchinsky A.N. Chernushevich I.V. Spicer V.L. Ens W. Standing K.G. J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 1998; 9: 569-579Crossref Scopus (173) Google Scholar). In addition, efficient desolvation was needed to sharpen the ion signals to determine the stoichiometry of the complexes from the mass spectrum. Therefore, source pressure conditions and electrospray voltages were optimized for transmission of the macromolecular protein complexes. The needle and sample cone voltage were 1,400 V and 140 V, respectively. The pressure in the interface region was adjusted to 8 millibars by reducing the pumping capacity of the rotary pump by closing the speedivalve. Electrospray needles were made from borosilicate glass capillaries (Kwik-Fil, World Precision Instruments) on a P-97 puller (Sutter Instruments), coated with a thin gold layer by using an Edwards Scancoat (Edwards Laboratories) six Pirani 501 sputter coater. The spectra were mass-calibrated by using a solution of 10 mg/ml cesium iodide in 50% (v/v) isopropyl alcohol. Limited Proteolysis Coupled to Matrix-assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization Mass Spectrometry—For limited proteolysis measurements, 6 μm CprK1 (dimer concentration) was incubated in the absence or presence of 400 μm effector, 29 μm dehalobox dsDNA, and 10 mm dithiothreitol in 100 mm ammonium acetate, pH 8.0 for 30 min at room temperature. Experiments were also performed at concentrations of 600 μm for 2,4-DCP, 800 μm for 2-Br-4-CP and 2,4,6-TCP, 5 mm for 2,3-DCP, and 7 mm for 3,5-DCP. As a control, limited proteolysis was performed on the protein bovine serum albumin. These data clearly showed that the halogenated phenolic compounds do not have an effect on the proteolytic activity of trypsin. Limited proteolysis of CprK1 was performed using sequencing grade modified (0.27 μm) trypsin (Roche Applied Science). Aliquots of 2 μl of each digest were taken at 2 min, 15 min, 1 h, 6 h, and 22 h, and mixed with 8 μl of 0.2% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid to quench trypsin activity. Trypsin digests were desalted and concentrated with μC18-ZipTips (Millipore) and analyzed on a matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization TOF-TOF mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems 4700 Proteomics analyzer) using α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid as the matrix. The mass spectra were recorded in positive ion reflectron mode at 20 kV accelerating voltage, and spectra were internally calibrated using the single protonated trypsin autodigestion peaks. The raw mass spectra were processed using Data Explorer software, version 4.0. Fluorescence Measurements—Intrinsic fluorescence experiments were performed with an SPF 500c spectrofluorimeter (SLM Aminco) at 20 °C. Excitation was carried out at 280 nm, and emission fluorescence was recorded at 330 nm. A 10-mm path length quartz cell with a stirrer was used. Excitation and emission slit widths were respectively 10 and 5 nm. Halogenated phenolic compound was added to an 800-μl solution of 0.2 μm CprK1 (dimer concentration) in 100 mm ammonium acetate, pH 8.0 with 0.75 mm dithiothreitol. The observed fluorescence emission quenching was plotted against the compound concentration using KaleidaGraph (Synergy Software). The data were fitted to Equation 1, F=F1×[Lt]/(Kd+[Lt])(Eq.1) where F is the fluorescence emission at 330 nm at a given added ligand concentration, F1 the fluorescence emission at the end of the titration, Kd the apparent dissociation constant, and [Lt] the total ligand concentration (25Clarke A.

Biophys. 1998; 352: 130-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The Quaternary Structure of CprK1 Does Not Depend on the Protein Redox State—It was previously shown that oxidized CprK1 contains an intermolecular disulfide bond between Cys11 and Cys200 (13Joyce M.G. Levy C. Gábor K. Pop S.M. Biehl B.D. Doukov T.I. Ryter J.M. Mazon H. Smidt H. van den Heuvel R.H. Ragsdale S.W. van der Oost J. Leys D. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 28318-28325Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). We performed denaturing gel electrophoresis of CprK1 under oxidizing and reducing conditions to determine the conditions necessary to reduce CprK1 in vitro (Fig. 1A). The data clearly showed that CprK1 was almost fully reduced at pH 8 at dithiothreitol concentrations of 5 and 10 mm after incubation of 30 min at room temperature. We studied the oligomerization state of CprK1 at pH 8 under reducing and oxidizing conditions by using native nanoflow electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (Fig. 1B). In both conditions, one dominant ion series was observed around 3,400 mass-to-charge (m/z) values corresponding to a mass of 52,739 ± 4 Da, representing dimeric CprK1. The measured mass of the dimeric species is lower than the expected mass of the dimer (52,998 Da) on the basis of the amino acid sequence. This is caused by the deletion of the N-terminal methionine in CprK1 (expected mass 52,736 Da). In both mass spectra we also observed a low abundant species with a mass of 53,003 ± 7 Da, which is the full-length dimeric protein, thus including the N-terminal methionine. These data thus clearly indicate that the redox state of CprK1 does not influence its oligomeric state. This is in agreement with size-exclusion chromatography data from Gábor et al. (10Gábor K. Veríssimo C.S. Cyran B.C. Ter Horst P. Meijer N.P. Smidt H. de Vos W.M. van der Oost J. J. Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 2604-2613Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), which have suggested that wild-type CprK1 and the disulfide bridge-deficient mutants [C11S]CprK1 and [C200S]CprK1 exist as a homodimer. CprK1-mediated Dehalobox dsDNA Binding Is Induced by Reducing Conditions and the Effector CHPA—The phenol derivative CHPA is a known effector of CprK1 (10Gábor K. Veríssimo C.S. Cyran B.C. Ter Horst P. Meijer N.P. Smidt H. de Vos W.M. van der Oost J. J. Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 2604-2613Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Fig. 2A shows the electrospray ionization mass spectrum of CprK1 incubated with dehalobox dsDNA at pH 8 under reducing conditions. In this mass spectrum we observed three ion series around m/z 2,500, 3,400, and 4,400, respectively. The first series represents dehalobox dsDNA with a determined mass of 18,410 ± 3 Da (expected mass 18,407 Da). The second and third series represent dimeric CprK1 and the complex between dimeric CprK1 and one molecule of dsDNA with a determined mass of 71,165 ± 3 Da (expected mass 71,143 Da), respectively. The observed slight mass increase is likely caused by a few water or buffer molecules still present in the CprK1-dsDNA complex (27Sobott F. McCammon M.G. Hernandez H. Robinson C.V. Philos. Transact. A. Math. Phys. Eng. Sci. 2005; 363: 379-391PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 2B shows the mass spectrum obtained after the addition of 400 μm CHPA to the dehalobox dsDNA-CprK1 solution at pH 8 under reducing conditions. The spectrum clearly shows a transition from free CprK1 and free dsDNA to a CprK1-dsDNA complex. CHPA did not induce DNA binding if the experiment at pH 8 was repeated under oxidizing conditions (Fig. 2C), confirming the importance of the reduction of the disulfide bridge. We did not observe interaction of CprK1 with 30-mer dsDNA having a random sequence (data not shown), strongly indicating that the interactions are specific for the DNA sequence containing the TTAAT—-ATTAA dehalobox. Intriguingly, although the addition of CHPA enhanced efficiently the binding of DNA to CprK1, the ternary complex comprising CHPA was not observed. CHPA interacts tightly with CprK1 (0.83 μm), and the complex is also retained in the CprK1 crystals (13Joyce M.G. Levy C. Gábor K. Pop S.M. Biehl B.D. Doukov T.I. Ryter J.M. Mazon H. Smidt H. van den Heuvel R.H. Ragsdale S.W. van der Oost J. Leys D. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 28318-28325Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Thus, in solution phase a strong interaction exists between CprK1 and CHPA, but this complex dissociates in the process of forming gas-phase ions or during the analysis of gas-phase ions in the mass spectrometer. It should be noted here that the applicability of mass spectrometry to investigate non-covalent biological complexes is strongly dependent on the nature of the interactions between the partners in the complex (28Rogniaux H. Sanglier S. Strupat K. Azza S. Roitel O. Ball V. Tritsch D. Branlant G. Van Dorsselaer A. Anal. Biochem. 2001; 291: 48-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 29Loo J.A. Mass Spectrom. Rev. 1997; 16: 1-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (1165) Google Scholar). When hydrophobic interactions play a prominent role in the binding, the preservation of the complex during the electrospray measurements is highly compromised. Interactions between the acyl CoA-binding protein and ligands were not observed in conditions normally used for non-covalent complexes because hydrophobic interactions are critical to the preservation of these complexes in solution (30Robinson C.V. Chung E.W. Kragelund B.B. Knudsen J. Aplin R.T. Poulsen F.M. Dobson C.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 8646-8653Crossref Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Also leucine zipper complexes are poorly retained in the mass spectrometer because of the prominent role hydrophobic interactions play in these complexes (31Wendt H. Durr E. Thomas R.M. Przybylski M. Bosshard H.R. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 1563-1570Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). For CprK1, crystallographic data have shown that hydrophobic interactions play an important role in the interactions between CprK1 and CHPA. On the other hand also six hydrogen bond interactions (to Tyr76, Gly85, Lys86, Thr90, Asn92, and Tyr130) and two salt bridges (with Lys86 and Lys133) between the protein and CHPA are present (13Joyce M.G. Levy C. Gábor K. Pop S.M. Biehl B.D. Doukov T.I. Ryter J.M. Mazon H. Smidt H. van den Heuvel R.H. Ragsdale S.W. van der Oost J. Leys D. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 28318-28325Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). We here observe that, under the experimental conditions used, only the hydrogen bond interactions and salt bridges are not sufficient to preserve the interactions between CprK1 and its effectors in the mass spectrometer. CprK1 Is Activated by Different Phenolic Compounds—The chlorinated phenol CHPA is a strong effector for CprK1; however, the identity of alternative effector molecules is largely unknown. We investigated the specificity of CprK1 by using a library of potential effector molecules (Fig. 3). CprK1 was mixed with dehalobox dsDNA and phenolic compound at pH 8 under reducing conditions. The effector potential of the different phenolic compounds was determined by measuring the relative amount of dsDNA-CprK1 complex formed upon incubation with the specific compound using native mass spectrometry (Fig. 4A). The data clearly show that both CprK1 reduction and effector binding are required for efficient dehalobox dsDNA binding. Under reducing conditions, but in the absence of a phenolic compound, a low level of complex was formed between CprK1 and the dehalobox dsDNA, which was not present under oxidizing conditions. Similarly, when reduced CprK1 was incubated with 4-hydroxyphenylacetate (HPA), a phenol derivative lacking a halogen atom at the ortho position, the meta-substituted 3,5-dichlorophenol (3,5-DCP) or cAMP, the allosteric effector for the CprK1 structural homologue CRP a low level of complex was observed, which was not present when oxidized CprK1 was incubated with these compounds. This low level of DNA binding is likely because"
https://openalex.org/W2019050218,"Background Insects detect a multitude of odors using a broad array of phenotypically distinct olfactory organs referred to as olfactory sensilla. Each sensillum contains one to several sensory neurons and at least three support cells; these cells arise from mitotic activities from one or a small group of defined precursor cells. Sensilla phenotypes are defined by distinct morphologies, and specificities to specific odors; these are the consequence of developmental programs expressed by associated neurons and support cells, and by selection and expression of subpopulations of olfactory genes encoding such proteins as odor receptors, odorant binding proteins, and odor degrading enzymes. Methodology/Principal Findings We are investigating development of the olfactory epithelium of adult M. sexta, identifying events which might establish sensilla phenotypes. In the present study, antennal tissue was examined during the first three days of an 18 day development, a period when sensory mitotic activity was previously reported to occur. Each antenna develops as a cylinder with an outward facing sensory epithelium divided into approximately 80 repeat units or annuli. Mitotic proliferation of sensory cells initiated about 20–24 hrs after pupation (a.p.), in pre-existing zones of high density cells lining the proximal and distal borders of each annulus. These high density zones were observed as early as two hr. a.p., and expanded with mitotic activity to fill the mid-annular regions by about 72 hrs a.p. Mitotic activity initiated at a low rate, increasing dramatically after 40–48 hrs a.p.; this activity was enhanced by ecdysteroids, but did not occur in animals entering pupal diapause (which is also ecdysteroid sensitive). Conclusions/Significance Sensory proliferation initiates in narrow zones along the proximal and distal borders of each annulus; these zones rapidly expand to fill the mid-annular regions. These zones exist prior to any mitotic activity as regions of high density cells which form either at or prior to pupation. Mitotic sensitivity to ecdysteroids may be a regulatory mechanism coordinating olfactory development with the developmental choice of diapause entry."
https://openalex.org/W2078410475,"Time series of Circulation Weather Type (CWT), including daily averaged wind direction and vorticity, are self-classified by similarity using Kohonen Neural Networks (KNN). It is shown that KNN is able to map by similarity all 7300 five-day CWT sequences during the period of 1975-94, in London, United Kingdom. It gives, as a first result, the most probable wind sequences preceding each one of the 27 CWT Lamb classes in that period. Inversely, as a second result, the observed diffuse correlation between both five-day CWT sequences and the CWT of the 6(th) day, in the long 20-year period, can be generalized to predict the last from the previous CWT sequence in a different test period, like 1995, as both time series are similar. Although the average prediction error is comparable to that obtained by forecasting standard methods, the KNN approach gives complementary results, as they depend only on an objective classification of observed CWT data, without any model assumption. The 27 CWT of the Lamb Catalogue were coded with binary three-dimensional vectors, pointing to faces, edges and vertex of a ""wind-cube,"" so that similar CWT vectors were close."
https://openalex.org/W2087543612,"Several severe glaciations occurred during the Neoproterozoic eon, and especially near its end in the Cryogenian period (630–850 Ma). While the glacial periods themselves were probably related to the continental positions being appropriate for glaciation, the general coldness of the Neoproterozoic and Cryogenian as a whole lacks specific explanation. The Cryogenian was immediately followed by the Ediacaran biota and Cambrian Metazoan, thus understanding the climate-biosphere interactions around the Cryogenian period is central to understanding the development of complex multicellular life in general. Here we present a feedback mechanism between growth of eukaryotic algal phytoplankton and climate which explains how the Earth system gradually entered the Cryogenian icehouse from the warm Mesoproterozoic greenhouse. The more abrupt termination of the Cryogenian is explained by the increase in gaseous carbon release caused by the more complex planktonic and benthic foodwebs and enhanced by a diversification of metazoan zooplankton and benthic animals. The increased ecosystem complexity caused a decrease in organic carbon burial rate, breaking the algal-climatic feedback loop of the earlier Neoproterozoic eon. Prior to the Neoproterozoic eon, eukaryotic evolution took place in a slow timescale regulated by interior cooling of the Earth and solar brightening. Evolution could have proceeded faster had these geophysical processes been faster. Thus, complex life could theoretically also be found around stars that are more massive than the Sun and have main sequence life shorter than 10 Ga. We also suggest that snow and glaciers are, in a statistical sense, important markers for conditions that may possibly promote the development of complex life on extrasolar planets."
