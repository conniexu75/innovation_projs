https://openalex.org/W1940436875,"An enzyme which catalyzes the dismutation of superoxide radicals (O2·- + O2·- + 2H+ → O2 + H2O2) has been purified by a simple procedure from bovine erythrocytes. This enzyme, called superoxide dismutase, contains 2 eq of copper per mole of enzyme. The copper may be reversibly removed, and it is required for activity. Superoxide dismutase has been shown to be identical with the previously described copper-containing erythrocuprein (human) and hemocuprein (bovine). Stable solutions of the superoxide radical were generated by the electrolytic reduction of O2 in an aprotic solvent, dimethylformamide. Slow infusion of such solutions into buffered aqueous media permitted the demonstration that O2·- can reduce ferricytochrome c and tetranitromethane, and that superoxide dismutase, by competing for the superoxide radicals, can markedly inhibit these reactions. Superoxide dismutase was used to show that the oxidation of epinephrine to adrenochrome by milk xanthine oxidase is mediated by the superoxide radical. An assay of several tissues indicates that superoxide dismutase is widely distributed within mammalian organisms."

https://openalex.org/W1593027298,"The complete amino acid sequence of pea seedling histone IV has been determined with the tryptic peptides from the maleylated protein and compared to the sequence of calf thymus histone IV. Both proteins contain 102 amino acid residues and have identical sequences except at two genetically determined positions: Residue 60 is valine in the calf but isoleucine in the pea, and Residue 77 is lysine in the calf but arginine in the pea. In addition to these changes, lysyl Residue 20 is methylated in the calf histone but not in the pea histone, and the amount and distribution of e-N-acetyllysine is different in the two histones. In calf histone IV, Residue 16 is acetylated to the extent of 50% and is the only lysyl residue so modified. Only about 6% of the pea histone IV molecules are acetylated, and the acetyl groups are distributed between Residue 16 and at least one of three other lysyl residues: 5, 8, or 12. Evidence obtained by peptide mapping suggests that Residue 8 is the other acetylated residue. These similarities and differences are discussed in the context of possible structure-function relationships of histone IV."

https://openalex.org/W2050015430,"The 12-day-old embryos of rats with a deficiency of zinc showed a reduced uptake of tritiated thymidine when compared with controls, as shown by liquid scintillation and autoradiography. The high incidence of gross congenital malformations resulting from zinc deficiency may thus be caused by DNA impaired DNA synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1507483808,"Abstract A contercurrent distribution system has been devised for bovine thyrotropin which permits easy removal of several impurities, including one of the peptide chains of luteinizing hormone. The remaining chain of luteinizing hormone, which has a number of properties similar to those of thyrotropin, can then be removed by gel filtration. The thyrotropin is biologically active after the countercurrent distribution and no evidence has been found for the separation of subunits as occurs with luteinizing hormone. The active thyrotropin contains more methionine, tyrosine, and lysine than previously reported. Electrophoresis of the reduced and S-carboxamidomethylated derivatives of thyrotropin and luteinizing hormone in urea-containing gels reveals polymorphism beyond that exhibited by the native hormones. In the case of thyrotropin, the added polymorphism does not seem to represent dissociation into subunits. Polymorphism of native luteinizing hormone obtained as a by-product of the preparation of thyrotropin has also been found. Because the luteinizing hormone which is most difficult to separate from thyrotropin by chromatography cannot be distinguished from thyrotropin by conventional gel electrophoresis, new electrophoretic criteria have been developed to establish when thyrotropin preparations are free of luteinizing hormone or either of its peptide chains. Immunochemical studies show that an antiserum directed against one of the chains of luteinizing hormone crossreacts with both thyrotropin and luteinizing hormone, although, under the same conditions, each of the two hormones does not significantly cross-react with antisera prepared against the native form of the other. Data on the composition of the two chains of luteinizing hormone are given which confirm earlier observations of others that thyrotropin and one of the chains of luteinizing hormone have similar molar ratios of amino acids."
https://openalex.org/W2034679935,"INTOXICATION with alcohol is frequently associated with diarrhoea, and disturbances of intestinal function have been reported to be common in chronic alcoholics studied shortly after drinking-bouts1–5. Because the normal diet of alcoholics is characteristically poor, it is not clear whether the transient malabsorption frequently found can be attributed to a direct toxic effect of ethanol on the small intestine, or to a nutritional deficiency. We therefore studied the effects of the experimental ingestion of ethanol in man on vitamin B12 absorption under controlled metabolic ward conditions in the absence of nutritional deficiency."

Of the compounds tested only those with α-(1 → 3)-glucosidic linkages were attacked, and the enzymatic hydrolysis occurred with retention of configuration of the anomeric carbon atom involved in cleavage. Some properties of the enzyme have been investigated. Optimum pH and temperature for activity are 4.5 and 50°, respectively. The values of Km and Vmax under standard assay conditions are 4.6 x 10-2 m glucose equivalents and 0.16 µmole of glucose equivalent per min. The molecular weight of the enzyme estimated by column chromatography on Sephadex G-100 was found to be approximately 47,000. Zn++ and Fe++ were found to be reversible inhibitors of the enzyme while Ag+ and Hg+ abolished activity irreversibly. The use of this enzyme in structural carbohydrate chemistry is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1982792932,"Histamine concentration in fetal rat brain is high at 17 days gestation but decreases sharply just before birth. Values subsequently increase to a maximum postnatal concentration 5 to 10 days after birth, and then steadily decline to low adult values by time of weaning. Spermidine follows a pattern similar to that of histamine but with a 24- to 48-hour lag. The developmental pattern for histamine in the central nervous system is different from that for other neural amines. It appears that the marked fetal and neonatal changes in brain histamine correlate best with periods of rapid cell proliferation and growth during brain maturation."
https://openalex.org/W1550542709,"Abstract Previous studies showed that the carcinogen N-hydroxy-2-fluorenylacetamide could react with RNA following enzymatic activation of the hydroxamic acid by deacetylation or esterification. Present studies indicate that 2'-(3')-GMP, but not 2'-(3')-AMP, -CMP, or -UMP, competes effectively with RNA in these reactions. 8-(N-2-Fluorenylamino)-guanosine was isolated and identified after incubation of guanosine, N-hydroxy-2-fluorenylacetamide, and soluble rat liver enzymes in a system favoring deacetylation. This adduct is also formed from reaction of N-2-fluorenylhydroxylamine and guanosine at pH 7.4. 2-Nitrosofluorene, an oxidation product of the hydroxylamine, does not participate in formation of the adduct. 8-(N-2-Fluorenylacetamido)guanosine was recovered following incubation of guanosine, N-hydroxy-2-fluorenylacetamide, rat liver-soluble enzymes, and 3'-phosphoadenosine 5'-phosphosulfate or ATP and MgCl2. The 5'-mononucleotide analogues of the guanosine adducts were identified after nucleic acid modified by reaction with enzymatically activated derivatives of N-hydroxy-2-fluorenylacetamide was treated with phosphodiesterase. Digestion of the nucleotide adducts with alkaline phosphatase yielded the guanosine adducts. These data, considered with results of the competition studies, implicate carbon 8 of nucleic acid guanine as the predominant site of adduct formation. Generation of the enzymatically activated derivatives of N-hydroxy-2-fluorenylacetamide in the presence of DNA or protein results in the incorporation of the carcinogen into these macromolecules. The isolation of 8-(N-2-fluorenylamino)guanosine and 8-(N-2-fluorenylacetamido)guanosine from aqueous solutions by adsorption onto Sephadex G-10 and elution with ethanol is detailed. A nondestructive method for the determination of the specific activity of labeled nucleic acids as their cetyltrimethylammonium salts is described."

Both inactivations show saturation kinetics and protection by substrate or competitive inhibitor. Labeling of the proteins by 1 molecule of glycidol-P per catalytic subunit results in complete loss of enzymatic activity. Both labeled proteins respond to alkali and H2NOH treatment with liberation of all radioactivity, indicating that formation of esters of glycerol-P caused the inactivations."

https://openalex.org/W2080402625,Hematologic and coagulation studies were conducted on Atlantic bottlenose dolphins and killer whales. Hematologic values were similar to those in man. These animals differed from other mammals in that the Hageman factor (factor XII) was absent and this absence caused marked prolongation of coagulation. Levels of factors VIII and V were high and those of VII and X were low compared with levels in man.
https://openalex.org/W1533226040,"Abstract Using specifically labeled 3-3H-phosphoenolpyruvate, the stereochemistry of CO2 (or HCO3-) addition was determined for the reactions catalyzed by P-enolpyruvate carboxylase (from peanuts and Acetobacter xylinum), P-enolpyruvate carboxykinase (from pigeon liver), and P-enolpyruvate carboxytransphosphorylase (from Propionibacterium shermanii). In all cases the addition occurs from the same side of the plane of enzyme-bound P-enolpyruvate, the si side. These results relate the stereochemical course of the protons in these carboxylation reactions to that in the enolase, fumarase, and phosphoglucose isomerase reactions. Furthermore, the conservation of the addition in evolution implies that this stereochemistry may have significance to the reaction mechanism."

https://openalex.org/W1600770488,"Abstract Crystalline bovine crotonase has a molecular weight of 164,000 ± 3,000 in phosphate buffer as determined by the method of sedimentation equilibrium in the ultracentrifuge. In contrast, crotonase has a molecular weight of 28,000 ± 500 in 6 m guanidine hydrochloride, or about one-sixth that of the native enzyme. The enzyme contains no disulfide bonds inasmuch as the total number of free thiol groups titrated with 5,5'-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoate) is equal to the total half-cystine content. Tryptic peptide maps indicate only about one-sixth the expected number of peptide based upon the lysine and arginine content of the enzyme. End group analysis shows serine at the NH2 terminus and aspartic acid at the COOH terminus of the molecule. These data suggest that crotonase is composed of 6 subunit polypeptide chains, with each chain containing about 260 residues in an identical or very similar sequence, and that the 6 chains are combined through noncovalent interactions to form the native enzyme."

https://openalex.org/W1534676825,"Abstract The alanine racemase from Lactobacillus fermenti has been purified 800-fold with a yield of 8%. The enzyme required pyridoxal phosphate as a cofactor, and the dissociation constant was calculated to be 0.15 µm. A sulfhydryl compound was necessary for maximal activity. Either glutathione or 2-mercaptoethanol was effective. The pH optimum was between pH 9.0 and 9.5. The enzyme was stabilized in its most active form by acetate ion. In the presence of acetate the Km for l-alanine was 10 mm; the Km for d-alanine was 7.3 mm, and the enzyme was inhibited by d-cysteine, d-serine, and d-α-amino-n-butyrate but not the corresponding l isomers. In the absence of acetate the enzyme had a lower specific activity, the Km for l-alanine was 16 mm; the Km for d-alanine was 15 mm, and the enzyme was inhibited by d- and l-cysteine, l-serine, and d- and l-α-amino-n-butyrate. A more detailed study of the recemase inhibition by d-cysteine indicated that with l-alanine as substrate, the slopes of the 1/v versus 1/[S]o plots were increased but the 1/v intercepts did not change. With d-alanine as substrate, the slopes and both the 1/v and 1/[S]o intercepts were altered. The only model of enzymatic behavior which predicted this effect was E ⇌ EL ⇌ FD ⇌ F + D E ⇌ F E + I ⇌ EI where E and F are two forms of the enzyme, D is d-alanine, L is l-alanine, and I is the inhibitor."

https://openalex.org/W1505799968,"The kinetics of tryptic hydrolysis of the arginyl and lysyl bonds at positions B-22 and B-29 on zinc-free bovine insulin, studied as a function of insulin concentration and pH, was compared with the results of previous studies on the oxidized B chain of insulin. When the insulin concentration was low (0.1 mg per ml or less) at pH 9.0 and 30°, the time course of the reaction was found to be satisfactorily described by first order kinetics. Under these conditions the rate constants for the hydrolysis of the arginyl and lysyl bonds of insulin were 1/45 and 1/9, respectively, of those for the hydrolysis of the corresponding bonds in the oxidized B chain of insulin. These results indicate that when the B chain is folded into the secondary and tertiary structure characteristic of the insulin molecule, both of the basic residues become more inaccessible to the enzyme than the corresponding residues in the oxidized B chain, but the effect is much greater for the arginine than for the lysine residue. The initial velocity for the hydrolysis of these two bonds was measured as a function of insulin concentration at pH 9.0 and 10.5 over the substrate concentration range of 0.01 to 10.0 mg per ml. At pH 9.0 and substrate concentrations below 0.1 mg per ml, the initial velocity was directly proportional to the substrate concentration, indicating first order kinetics. Above this concentration of insulin, the increment in the initial velocity decreased with increasing substrate concentration up to a concentration of 2 mg per ml in a fashion similar to but not adequately described by Michaelis-Menten kinetics. At concentrations above 2 mg per ml, the initial velocity again became directly proportional to the substrate concentration, which was indicative of a second region of first order kinetics. Similar results were obtained at pH 10.5, with the exception that the two ranges of first order behavior were shifted to slightly higher substrate concentrations. It is proposed that the effects of increasing substrate concentration on the initial velocity of the reaction may be attributed to aggregation of insulin molecules. At an insulin concentration of 1 mg per ml, the optimum pH for the hydrolysis of insulin occurred at pH 8.5, a value somewhat higher than that (pH 7.8) observed for model peptides. A comparison of the relative rate of hydrolysis of the arginyl to lysyl bond as a function of pH showed this ratio to change from 3.5:1 at pH 8.0 to a value of 9:1 at pH 10.5. This change in the relative rates with pH is ascribed to partial deprotonation of the e-amino group of the lysine residue at high pH."
https://openalex.org/W2089552658,"PHOSPHOGLUCONATE dehydrogenase (PGD) has been found to be polymorphic in several species, including the rat, when studied by starch gel electrophoresis1. Investigation of this enzyme in the rat revealed three distinct electrophoretic phenotypes, giving respectively a slow migrating component, the S phenotype, a fast migrating component, the F type, and the SF phenotype, giving a triplet of electrophoretic bands comprising both the slow and the fast migrating bands, and also a strongly staining band with intermediate mobility2. As in all mammals, rat PGD was found to be controlled by an autosomal gene locus. The S phenotype seemed to be a consequence of a homozygous PGD genotype, PGDSPGDS. The SF and F types, commonly found in wild but not laboratory rats, were considered to be the product of genotypes PGDFPGDS and PGDFPGDF respectively. Each (presumably allelic) gene was thought to code for one type of polypeptide subunit (either s or f) and the triplet zymogram in heterozygotes was considered to be the result of the random association in pairs of subunits of these two varieties, thus producing three dimeric oligomers: ss, sf and ff. The three types of rat PGD were not found to differ from each other with respect to optimal pH, KM and stability."

In temperate zones both factors show dramatic changes in the annual cycle. In the tropics, daylength shows much less significant variation than it does in the temperate zones and temperatures are generally quite high throughout the year. These variations are even less in the equatorial zone. The most prominent seasonally varying climatic feature is usually rainfall. Its influence on the reproductive activity of tropical fish has not been clearly determined."

https://openalex.org/W1513138765,"Abstract Mitochondria that have catalyzed oxidative phosphorylation at 37° in 3H-labeled water, and which are then chilled and subjected to gel filtration near 0°, retain small amounts of tritium. Retention is decreased by lowering the temperature of incubation below 37°. At 37° most of the response is complete in 1 min of incubation, and after 5 min of incubation only about 3 µatoms of hydrogen from media water are retained per mg of protein. The extent of tritium retention is not modified by inhibitors or uncouplers of oxidative phosphorylation. Comparison of 3H and 18O retention in a less sensitive experiment shows that the tritium retention is not accompanied by an equivalent retention of 18O from H18OH. 3H released from 2-3H-glutamate and 18O released from 18O-Pi during oxidative phosphorylation are not demonstrably retained by mitochondria. The results indicate that the tritium retention from media water may represent proton exchange with mitochondrial structures, probably mitochondrial proteins, and that the exchange is largely independent from oxidation or phosphorylation processes. The data give no support for possible transient localization of hydrogen from substrates or oxygen from Pi in mitochondrial water pools during oxidative phosphorylation, or for protein conformation changes associated with phosphorylation."
