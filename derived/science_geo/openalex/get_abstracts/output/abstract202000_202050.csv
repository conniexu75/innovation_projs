https://openalex.org/W2070230215,"In the course of examining single unit responses from the cortex of unrestrained and unanesthetized cats, we have come upon a population of cells that appears to be sensitive to auditory stimuli only if the cat ""pays attention"" to the sound source. We have described these responses, since they have not been previously reported and since they illustrate an important difference between the information which can be gleaned from experiments of this type and that obtained in the usual ""acute"" microelectrode experiment."

https://openalex.org/W2028951226,"Chiasm- and callosum-sectioned (split-brain) cats and controls were trained to displace the correct one of two different objects, using each forelimb half the time. During this discrimination training, vision was restricted to one eye, thus confining visual input and learning to a single hemisphere in the split-brain animals. It was found that either forelimb could be used about equally well by all the animals."

https://openalex.org/W2014526919,"Dichloromethane and chloroform have been found to inhibit the action of liver beta-glucuronidase on phenolphthalein glucuronic acid at concentrations which produce a considerable enhancement of bacterial beta-glucuronidase. Other solvents, including n-butanol, benzene, and toluene, have very little effect on the liver enzyme but nevertheless potentiate the bacterial enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W2160334412,"A consequence of the recent study of the mechanism of gastric secretion has been the presumption, implicit (1) if not explicit (2), that the distinctive gastric transmucosal potential has a fundamental role in the formation of hydrochloric acid. The following report indicates that the isolated surviving elasmobranch gastric mucosa does secrete acid but, unlike that of other vertebrates, does so without developing a significant epithelial potential difference. The gastric transmembrane potential is neither necessary for hydrogen ion secretion nor is its generation a fundamental feature of the mechanism that leads to the formation of hydrochloric acid."

https://openalex.org/W2029369241,"RECENTLY, Quastel and Bickis1 published a very interesting and stimulating article concerning the energy relationships in several intact cell types, including the Ehrlich ascites carcinoma cell. They determined the ratio of lactate produced to the difference between oxygen consumed in the cell system with and without added glucose (average value 5.8). The assumption was made that the amount of adenosine triphosphate produced in the two systems was the same. They reasoned that if the total production of energy remained constant in the two cell systems, the ratio phosphorus/oxygen would be about 3."

Experimental milling of the kernels gave brans with the largest amounts and flours with the least amounts of activity, the Sr90 concentrations being related practically linearly to the weights of total ash in the various milling products."

https://openalex.org/W2083608256,"ROBERTS1 recently described an X-ray fluorescence Spectrographic method for the determination of strontium in animal bone using the Philips PW 1520 spectrograph fitted with a quartz analysing crystal. In our laboratories a lithium fluoride crystal was available and was used for similar analyses since, compared with a quartz crystal, it increases the intensity of the strontium KÎ± line by a factor of 2.8 and the line/background ratio by a factor of 1.15. Thus the counting time to achieve a given coefficient of variation (due to the counting statistics) can be reduced by a factor of 3.5 or, if the same counting time is compared, the coefficient of variation can be reduced by a factor of 1.9, by using the lithium fluoride crystal."
https://openalex.org/W1966312957,Albino rats with as much as 99 percent damage to the cerebral cortex were trained on a position habit in a simple T-maze. The operated rats were found to learn the problem as efficiently as normal animals even when a 30-second delay was imposed between the response and the food.

https://openalex.org/W2073086466,THE long-term effects of low-level chronic irradiation on living organisms have attracted increasing interest in connexion with the observed contamination from man-made radioactive sources over large areas of the Earth's surface. No experimental evidence exists that definite biological changes are induced in a large population under very low continuous exposure.

https://openalex.org/W2103932159,IT has been suggested that the gist of certain unpublished observations on the condition of certain plants in the area of the Marshall Islands affected by fall-out from the 1954 Bikini hydrogen bomb test should be made public in order to stimulate further investigation on the subject of cumulative effects of low-level radioactivity in plants. These observations have hitherto remained unpublished because of their preliminary and inconclusive nature.
https://openalex.org/W2006793566,"IT has been found1 that following the moistening of a dry soil two independent decomposition processes occur, namely, (1) decomposition of soluble organic material without nitrification and (2) decomposition of non-soluble organic material with nitrification. Both rates of decomposition fall off rapidly, with (1) as the soluble substrate is exhausted and with (2) as physical changes, among others, occur at the surface. These changes appear to involve organic gels the surface area of which is increased by drying, possibly as a result of fragmentation or increased porosity. On first moistening, a greater surface area is exposed to solution processes (followed by (1)), and to decomposition (2) than later when, under continued moist conditions, reversible changes occur in the colloids leading to reduced surface area. Prolongation of the dry state, without the soil necessarily becoming drier, increases the magnitude of (1) and (2), which indicates that ageing, a typical colloidal phenomenon, is involved. Moreover, since the behaviour described under (1) and (2) is repetitive with successive dryings and rewettings the changes in the colloids must be reversible, indicating that elastic gels are involved."
https://openalex.org/W2009304664,"ZOTTERMAN1 and his co-workers have reported that in the rat and in man the taste of water consists in a reduction of the spontaneous firing of the salt receptors. According to Deutsch's theory2 of need and reward, satiation of thirst is due to the reception of a certain quantity of messages signalling the ingestion of water. The quantity of fluid ingested would be proportionate to the number of signals generated by it. It follows that as a hypotonic solution of saline reduces the spontaneous firing of salt receptors less than the same volume of water, it would generate less of a âwater signalâ. A rat should therefore drink more saline solution even when water is present. This has already been noted by workers such as Richter3 and Bare4 and ascribed to a preference for weak saline solutions. But if the above hypothesis is correct, the ingestion of saline by the rat is not due to a preference but to the fact that it has been given âdiluted waterâ, if we can put it that way."

Airborne fallout collected 612 miles from the test site released 51.8 percent of its Sr(90) activity. Aircraft-collected fallout released 40.5 percent of its Sr(90) activity when collected from a tower shot and 86 percent when collected from a balloon shot."

The records, inscribed at various paper speeds, are easily quantified. The tracing patterns can be identified with specific activities of undisturbed animals. The activities are monitored by means of closed-circuit television."
https://openalex.org/W2028716020,"IN all members of the proteus group of Amoebae1 there occur spherules of a pale blue colour to which the name âexcretion spheresâ was given by early writers. This designation was changed to ânutritive spheresâ by Hayes2 in 1924. The reaction of these bodies to various reagents has been described in an appendix by Hayes to Taylor's paper entitled âA. proteus, some New Observations on its Nucleus Life History and Cultureâ, and further information about them was later published by Taylor3."
