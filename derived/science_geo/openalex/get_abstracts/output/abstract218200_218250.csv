https://openalex.org/W2034144459,This article describes the induction the induction and suppression of breast cancer in albino rats; the study was conducted to permit the analysis of the mechanisms of the causes and extinction of cancer 2 of the central problems in cancer research. A single feeding of 20 mg of 712 dimethylbenz(a)anthracene (712-DMBA) dissolved in sesame oil developed mammary cancer in all of over 700 healthy female rats of the Sprague-Dawley strain. The mammary cancer evoked by the aromatic hydrocarbons were all rather similar in cytologic appearance and all had the cellular pattern of papillary adenocarcinoma. Experiments also showed that while 712-DMBA and 2-aminophenanthrene were strong carcinogens benz(a)anthracene and phenanthrene did not evoke mammary cancer. It appears that the methyl and amnio groups convert the otherwise inactive parent molecular species to powerful carcinogens. 3 factors seem to determine mammary carcinogenicity in polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons: 1) the electron transfer 2) the geometric factor and 3) the molecular thickness. Regression of mammary cancer has been induced by 2 types of alteration of the endocrine status the withdrawal of the hormones essential for the life and growth of the cancer usually done through ovariectomy on the administration of appropriate hormones. In an experiment female rats previously induced with mammary cancer through administration of 712-DMBA were given for 30 days 20 mcg of estradiol-17 and 4 mg of progesterone. In a group of 100 rats treated this way 52 were free from cancer at necropsy whereas their control companions succumbed to cancer. This experiment was repeated under more rigorous conditions with rats with large mammary cancers; the results were equally successful.

This single enzyme appears to be responsible for the entire 17/3estradiol-mediated transfer of hydrogen between pyridine nucleotides in soluble extracts of this tissue. Experiments which were reported in 1958 (2, 3) showed that soluble enzyme preparations derived from human placenta promoted a reversible transhydrogenation between pyridine nucleotides in the presence of low concentrations of 17&hydroxyst,eroids or 17-ketosteroids, notably 17/I-estradiol or estrone. These enzyme preparations also contained an active 17/3-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase which interconverts 17@estradiol and estrone, and reacts with diphosphopyridine nucleotide (DPN) or triphosphopyridine nucleotide (TPN) (8, 9, 11). We suggested (2, 3) that the 17/3-estradiol-mediated transfer of hydro"

https://openalex.org/W2030186609,Pyrocatechol has been identified as one of two main substances isolated from bark of aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.) which inhibited Hypoxylon pruinatum (Klot.) Cke. Total inhibition of this fungus was obtained at a dosage of 640 parts per million. Tests with bark extract from two localities showed that inhibition was maximal in samples obtained in the dormant season and from the base of the trees.

In the present experiment, similarly dramatic subjective experiences occurred within 1 hour when subjects were told of the possibility and appropriateness of such phenomena."

Activation of the central nervous system, indicated by behavioral and heart rate responses, depends upon the rate but not the dose of exposure. The arousal reaction is not dependent upon direct visual stimulation. The nervous system is probably directly sensitive to ionizing radiation."

https://openalex.org/W1963720041,"FROM an examination of the effects of various factors, for example, temperature, external pH, and provision of a suitable nitrogen source on salt absorption and protein synthesis in tissue slices, Steward and Millar1 concluded that the two processes are closely related. The possibility that the relationship is an indirect one through a common dependence on respiratory energy was not at that time excluded. New evidence for a more direct connexion came from the observation that chloramphenicol, which is known to be a specific inhibitor of protein synthesis in microorganisms2 and in higher plants3, also inhibits salt absorption in storage tissue slices4."

The question arose as to the circumstances in which these cells might be discharged, and for this reason it seemed important to carry out a quantitative investigation during the circulatory eosinophilia which follows the re-injection of foreign protein in sensitized animals. Percentage changes in bone marrow eosinophils have been noted in these conditions3."
