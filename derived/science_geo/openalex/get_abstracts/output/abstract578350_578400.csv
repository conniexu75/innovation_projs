https://openalex.org/W2575837388,"Cervical cancer remains one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Here we report the extensive molecular characterization of 228 primary cervical cancers, one of the largest comprehensive genomic studies of cervical cancer to date. We observed notable APOBEC mutagenesis patterns and identified SHKBP1, ERBB3, CASP8, HLA-A and TGFBR2 as novel significantly mutated genes in cervical cancer. We also discovered amplifications in immune targets CD274 (also known as PD-L1) and PDCD1LG2 (also known as PD-L2), and the BCAR4 long non-coding RNA, which has been associated with response to lapatinib. Integration of human papilloma virus (HPV) was observed in all HPV18-related samples and 76% of HPV16-related samples, and was associated with structural aberrations and increased target-gene expression. We identified a unique set of endometrial-like cervical cancers, comprised predominantly of HPV-negative tumours with relatively high frequencies of KRAS, ARID1A and PTEN mutations. Integrative clustering of 178 samples identified keratin-low squamous, keratin-high squamous and adenocarcinoma-rich subgroups. These molecular analyses reveal new potential therapeutic targets for cervical cancers."
https://openalex.org/W2582492205,"Whole-genome shotgun sequencing and sequencing of the gene encoding the 16S rRNA in samples from a variety of body sites in a large cohort of mothers and their infants reveals that, during the 6 weeks after birth, changes in the composition and function of the microbiome are driven by body site but not by the mode of delivery. Human microbial communities are characterized by their taxonomic, metagenomic and metabolic diversity, which varies by distinct body sites and influences human physiology. However, when and how microbial communities within each body niche acquire unique taxonomical and functional signatures in early life remains underexplored. We thus sought to determine the taxonomic composition and potential metabolic function of the neonatal and early infant microbiota across multiple body sites and assess the effect of the mode of delivery and its potential confounders or modifiers. A cohort of pregnant women in their early third trimester (n = 81) were prospectively enrolled for longitudinal sampling through 6 weeks after delivery, and a second matched cross-sectional cohort (n = 81) was additionally recruited for sampling once at the time of delivery. Samples across multiple body sites, including stool, oral gingiva, nares, skin and vagina were collected for each maternal–infant dyad. Whole-genome shotgun sequencing and sequencing analysis of the gene encoding the 16S rRNA were performed to interrogate the composition and function of the neonatal and maternal microbiota. We found that the neonatal microbiota and its associated functional pathways were relatively homogeneous across all body sites at delivery, with the notable exception of the neonatal meconium. However, by 6 weeks after delivery, the infant microbiota structure and function had substantially expanded and diversified, with the body site serving as the primary determinant of the composition of the bacterial community and its functional capacity. Although minor variations in the neonatal (immediately at birth) microbiota community structure were associated with the cesarean mode of delivery in some body sites (oral gingiva, nares and skin; R2 = 0.038), this was not true for neonatal stool (meconium; Mann–Whitney P > 0.05), and there was no observable difference in community function regardless of delivery mode. For infants at 6 weeks of age, the microbiota structure and function had expanded and diversified with demonstrable body site specificity (P < 0.001, R2 = 0.189) but without discernable differences in community structure or function between infants delivered vaginally or by cesarean surgery (P = 0.057, R2 = 0.007). We conclude that within the first 6 weeks of life, the infant microbiota undergoes substantial reorganization, which is primarily driven by body site and not by mode of delivery."
https://openalex.org/W2576658154,"Immune responses involve coordination across cell types and tissues. However, studies in cancer immunotherapy have focused heavily on local immune responses in the tumor microenvironment. To investigate immune activity more broadly, we performed an organism-wide study in genetically engineered cancer models using mass cytometry. We analyzed immune responses in several tissues after immunotherapy by developing intuitive models for visualizing single-cell data with statistical inference. Immune activation was evident in the tumor and systemically shortly after effective therapy was administered. However, during tumor rejection, only peripheral immune cells sustained their proliferation. This systemic response was coordinated across tissues and required for tumor eradication in several immunotherapy models. An emergent population of peripheral CD4 T cells conferred protection against new tumors and was significantly expanded in patients responding to immunotherapy. These studies demonstrate the critical impact of systemic immune responses that drive tumor rejection."

In this study, to investigate the effects of MDS on human progenitor subtypes that control neuronal output and influence brain topology, we analyzed cerebral organoids derived from control and MDS-induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) using time-lapse imaging, immunostaining, and single-cell RNA sequencing. We saw a cell migration defect that was rescued when we corrected the MDS causative chromosomal deletion and severe apoptosis of the founder neuroepithelial stem cells, accompanied by increased horizontal cell divisions. We also identified a mitotic defect in outer radial glia, a progenitor subtype that is largely absent from lissencephalic rodents but critical for human neocortical expansion. Our study, therefore, deepens our understanding of MDS cellular pathogenesis and highlights the broad utility of cerebral organoids for modeling human neurodevelopmental disorders.

The human cerebral cortex develops from a pseudostratified layer of neuroepithelial stem cells (NESCs) into a functionally complex, six-layered structure with a folded (gyrencephalic) surface. The molecular underpinnings of brain size and topology are encoded by the genome and distinguish us from species with a small and smooth (lissencephalic) brain surface, such as mice. Although brain folding in the human does not begin until the end of the second trimester (after gestation week [GW] 23) (Chi et al., 1977Chi J.G. Dooling E.C. Gilles F.H.

Genetic and infectious diseases that disrupt these processes underlie a number of cortical malformations and cause mental retardation, mortality, and morbidity (Guerrini and Dobyns, 2014Guerrini R.

Despite the prevalence and societal burden of cortical malformations, our understanding of how disease-linked mutations disrupt brain development is still limited. Miller-Dieker syndrome (MDS) is a severe cortical malformation characterized by nearly absent cortical folding (lissencephaly) often associated with reduced brain size (microcephaly), craniofacial dysmorphisms, mental retardation, and intractable epilepsy (Dobyns et al., 1983Dobyns W.B.

Insight into lissencephaly pathogenesis is largely derived from mouse models and limited analyses of postmortem human brains. Reduction in LIS1 levels in Pafah1b1 mutant mice leads to defects in neuronal migration (Hirotsune et al., 1998Hirotsune S. Fleck M.W. Gambello M.J. Bix G.J. Chen A. Clark G.D. Ledbetter D.H.

Collectively, these studies led to the prevailing model that lissencephaly is due to defective neuronal migration (Kato and Dobyns, 2003Kato M. Dobyns W.B. Lissencephaly and the molecular basis of neuronal migration.Hum. Mol. Genet. 2003; 12: R89-R96Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the mouse brain is naturally lissencephalic, suggesting that certain aspects of cortical development may not be adequately assessed in mice. Recent work has uncovered critical cellular and molecular differences between cortical development in humans and mice, further underscoring the need to develop human model systems. In the developing human cortex, the outer subventricular zone (OSVZ) is greatly expanded (Smart et al., 2002Smart I.H. Dehay C. Giroud P. Berland M. Kennedy H.

OSVZ progenitors, which include transit-amplifying intermediate progenitor (IP) cells and outer or basal radial glia (oRG/bRG) (Hansen et al., 2010Hansen D.V. Lui J.H. Parker P.R. Kriegstein A.R.

Although IP cells are conserved between humans and mice, oRG cells are largely absent from the developing cortices of lissencephalic rodents (Shitamukai et al., 2011Shitamukai A. Konno D. Matsuzaki F. Oblique radial glial divisions in the developing mouse neocortex induce self-renewing progenitors outside the germinal zone that resemble primate outer subventricular zone progenitors.J.

Multiple lines of evidence suggest that the high abundance and proliferative capacity of oRG cells are critical for the vast developmental and evolutionary increase in cortical size (Stahl et al., 2013Stahl R.

Using a multifaceted approach integrating histology, live cell imaging, and single-cell transcriptomics, we uncover cell type-specific defects in lissencephaly spanning the stages of neuroepithelial cell expansion, neuronal migration, and the mitotic properties of oRG progenitors, providing deeper insight into human cortical development and lissencephaly. To study MDS pathogenesis, we generated iPSCs from three MDS individuals (Figures 1A–1C) using non-integrating episomal reprogramming vectors (Okita et al., 2011Okita K. Matsumara Y. Sato Y. Okada A.

Cell-autonomous correction of ring chromosomes in human induced pluripotent stem cells.Nature. 2014; 507: 99-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, and data not shown). To assess the effect of MDS on NESCs, we implemented a published suspension culture method whereby equal numbers of dissociated iPSCs are quickly re-aggregated in serum-free cortical differentiation medium (Kadoshima et al., 2013Kadoshima T. Sakaguchi H. Nakano T. Soen M. Ando S. Eiraku M. Sasai Y. Self-organization of axial polarity, inside-out layer pattern, and species-specific progenitor dynamics in human ES cell-derived neocortex.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2013; 110: 20284-20289Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar). Initially and on day 3, there were no significant differences in the size of wild-type (WT) and MDS aggregates (Figures S1A and S1C). However, by 2.5 weeks of suspension culture (day 18 ± 1), the MDS organoids were significantly smaller (Figure 1D; Figures S1B–S1D). We observed that 25% of MDS organoids (n = 3 individuals, 2 iPSC clones each) were very small (less than 0.5 mm in circumference; Figure 1D) and invariably disintegrated before they could be analyzed. Of note, organoids derived from both of the MDS4 clones exhibited particularly poor growth in suspension and were therefore omitted from most of the subsequent assays. The larger organoids were fixed and sectioned after 5 weeks of differentiation for further characterization. At this time point, the organoids consisted of NESCs organized into multiple pseudo-stratified VZ-like progenitor regions expressing SOX2 (Figures 1E). Cortical patterning was verified by co-expression of the dorsal telencephalon progenitor marker PAX6 (Georgala et al., 2011Georgala P.A. Carr C.B. Price D.J. The role of Pax6 in forebrain development.Dev. Neurobiol. 2011; 71: 690-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) in the VZ-like regions, which were surrounded by doublecortin (DCX)-positive neurons also expressing the deep-layer subcortical projection neuron marker CTIP2 (Molyneaux et al., 2005Molyneaux B.J.

Consistent with reduced organoid size, we found markedly increased apoptosis in the MDS cortical VZ-like regions, whereas the marker of proliferation was not significantly altered (Figures 1F–1H). Interestingly, although acute removal of Pafah1b1 in the mouse telencephalon at embryonic day (E) 8-E8.5 leads to NESC apoptosis, genetic Pafah1b1 heterozygosity does not exhibit a strong phenotype in the mouse neuroepithelium (Hirotsune et al., 1998Hirotsune S.

Our results suggest that the human genetic model may be more sensitive in recapitulating lissencephaly severity and highlight an early defect in the founder population of neuroepithelial stem cells independent of neurogenesis or neuronal migration. NESCs undergo interkinetic nuclear migration (INM) coordinately with the cell cycle and expand through symmetrical divisions with vertically oriented cleavage planes (60°–90° relative to the ventricular surface) at the apical VZ surface (Götz and Huttner, 2005Götz M. Huttner W.B. The cell biology of neurogenesis.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 777-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (1549) Google Scholar). These cell-intrinsic properties, including apical-basal polarity, dynamic behavior, and precise regulation of mitotic spindle orientation, are recapitulated in vitro in cortical organoids (Movie S1; Kadoshima et al., 2013Kadoshima T. Sakaguchi H. Nakano T. Soen M. Ando S. Eiraku M. Sasai Y. Self-organization of axial polarity, inside-out layer pattern, and species-specific progenitor dynamics in human ES cell-derived neocortex.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2013; 110: 20284-20289Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar). We consistently found that both WT and MDS SOX1 and SOX2 NESC nuclei were distributed throughout the apical-basal VZ axis in a pseudo-stratified fashion, with mitotic cells expressing phospho-Vimentin and phospho-Histone H3 (Figures 2A and 2B ), located at the apical surface. Other apical determinants, including α protein kinase C (αPKC), N-Cadherin, and Pericentrin, which marks the centrosomes, were generally localized at the apical surface in both genotypes (Figures 2A–2C). Notably, we sometimes observed a less organized cellular structure and a discontinuous VZ surface in MDS organoids (Figure 2B, right). LIS1 and ASPM (a microcephaly causative gene) were shown to regulate mitotic spindle orientation in the developing mouse forebrain, with loss of function leading to increased horizontal divisions associated with premature neurogenesis (Fish et al., 2006Fish J.L. Kosodo Y. Enard W. Pääbo S. Huttner W.B. Aspm specifically maintains symmetric proliferative divisions of neuroepithelial cells.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

To determine whether a similar defect is present in human lissencephaly, we analyzed mitotic cells in VZ-like regions of week 5 cortical organoids using time-lapse imaging (Figure 2C) and immunostaining (Figure 2D). In WT organoids, the majority of cleavage planes in the VZ were perpendicular to the apical surface, with an average angle of ∼65° (Figures 2E–2H). In contrast, dividing cells in the VZ regions"

To gain a mechanistic understanding of their function, we mapped OSKM-binding, stage-specific transcription factors (TFs), and chromatin states in discrete reprogramming stages and performed loss- and gain-of-function experiments. We found that OSK predominantly bind active somatic enhancers early in reprogramming and immediately initiate their inactivation genome-wide by inducing the redistribution of somatic TFs away from somatic enhancers to sites elsewhere engaged by OSK, recruiting Hdac1, and repressing the somatic TF Fra1. Pluripotency enhancer selection is a stepwise process that also begins early in reprogramming through collaborative binding of OSK at sites with high OSK-motif density. Most pluripotency enhancers are selected later in the process and require OS and other pluripotency TFs. Somatic and pluripotency TFs modulate reprogramming efficiency when overexpressed by altering OSK targeting, somatic-enhancer inactivation, and pluripotency enhancer selection. Together, our data indicate that collaborative interactions among OSK and with stage-specific TFs direct both somatic-enhancer inactivation and pluripotency-enhancer selection to drive reprogramming."

Most mammalian organs display a similar architecture (Figure S1A): a membranous cellular lining encapsulates a core of parenchymal cells supported by a stromal vascular fraction (SVF). The SVF is a heterogeneous group of cells, composed of immune cells, fibroblasts, endothelial cells, and mural cells (MCs). Mural cells comprise two cell types required to stabilize vascular networks. Pericytes surround smaller caliber vessels, whereas vascular smooth muscle cells surround larger vessels (Armulik et al., 2011Armulik A. Genové G. Betsholtz C. Pericytes: developmental, physiological, and pathological perspectives, problems, and promises.Dev. Cell. 2011; 21: 193-215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1714) Google Scholar). Importantly, pericytes have been identified as mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), progenitors with the capacity to attach to tissue culture plastic that can be expanded in vitro for multiple passages and induced to differentiate into osteogenic, chondrogenic, or adipogenic lineages (Crisan et al., 2008Crisan M.

In vivo lineage tracing studies have reported pericytes as progenitors of white adipocytes (Tang et al., 2008Tang W. Zeve D. Suh J.M. Bosnakovski D. Kyba M. Hammer R.E. Tallquist M.D. Graff J.M. White fat progenitor cells reside in the adipose vasculature.Science. 2008; 322: 583-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (840) Google Scholar), follicular dendritic cells (Krautler et al., 2012Krautler N.J.

Commun. 2011; 2: 499Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Pericytes have also been proposed to have the capacity to give rise to neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes (Dore-Duffy et al., 2006Dore-Duffy P. Katychev A. Wang X. Van Buren E. CNS microvascular pericytes exhibit multipotential stem cell activity.J. Cereb. Blood Flow Metab. 2006; 26: 613-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar) or to play a major role as fibroblast progenitors in fibrotic responses (Göritz et al., 2011Göritz C. Dias D.O.

A pericyte origin of spinal cord scar tissue.Science. 2011; 333: 238-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar, Greenhalgh et al., 2013Greenhalgh S.N. Iredale J.P. Henderson N.C. Origins of fibrosis: pericytes take centre stage.F1000Prime Rep. 2013; 5: 37Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Owing to technological breakthroughs allowing for the generation of induced pluripotent stem cells, it is currently possible to generate large numbers of patient-derived stem cells and differentiate them into specific cell types (Sancho-Martinez et al., 2012Sancho-Martinez I. Baek S.H. Izpisua Belmonte J.C. Lineage conversion methodologies meet the reprogramming toolbox.Nat. Cell Biol. 2012; 14: 892-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). However, clinical translation of this approach has proven extremely challenging, mainly due to genetic and epigenetic aberrations caused by in vitro culture, risk of tumorigenesis, and the lack of efficient strategies for cell delivery into certain solid organs (Ben-David and Benvenisty, 2011Ben-David U. Benvenisty N. The tumorigenicity of human embryonic and induced pluripotent stem cells.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2011; 11: 268-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar). Importantly, none of these limitations apply to tissue-resident progenitors. As such, boosting the potential of endogenous stem cells constitutes an attractive strategy for the development of new regenerative therapies. From this perspective, due to their broad distribution and reported multipotency, pericytes are considered to hold significant clinical potential. However, most reports claiming multipotency of pericytes are exclusively based on experiments performed utilizing cells cultured in vitro or on observations made in animals that received transplants of pericytes previously propagated in vitro. Importantly, artificial conditions and high concentration of mitogens that characterize cell culture systems may induce progenitor potential that may not be shared by the corresponding endogenous cells in vivo under physiological conditions (Snippert and Clevers, 2011Snippert H.J. Clevers H. Tracking adult stem cells.EMBO Rep. 2011; 12: 113-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Lineage tracing based on permanent genetic labeling constitutes the most reliable strategy to map the fate of any given cell population in vivo (Buckingham and Meilhac, 2011Buckingham M.E. Meilhac S.M. Tracing cells for tracking cell lineage and clonal behavior.Dev.

Lineage tracing of pericytes has been previously performed using a constitutive Pdgfrb-Cre transgene (Foo et al., 2006Foo S.S. Turner C.J. Adams S. Compagni A. Aubyn D. Kogata N. Lindblom P. Shani M.

White fat progenitor cells reside in the adipose vasculature.Science. 2008; 322: 583-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (840) Google Scholar). Here, we show that, although in adulthood, platelet-derived growth factor receptor β (PDGFRβ) expression is largely restricted to pericytes and vascular smooth muscle, during embryogenesis, PDGFRβ and the constitutive Pdgfrb-Cre allele are expressed in multiple cell lineages, rendering the latter unsuitable for tracking the progeny of mural cells. Notably, we have identified the Tbx18 gene as being selectively expressed by all pericytes and vascular smooth muscle cells of specific organs in adult mouse, including retina, brain, heart, skeletal muscle, and white and brown fat depots. Following this expression profile, we generated a Tbx18-CreERT2 line that allowed for high-efficiency, time-controlled, genetic labeling of pericytes and vascular smooth muscle cells in intact tissues. This tool enabled us to track the progeny of pericytes during aging and in diverse pathological settings. Surprisingly, results from these experiments revealed that in brain, heart, skeletal muscle, and fat, endogenous pericytes do not significantly contribute to other cell lineages. As a substantial number of experiments indicating that pericytes are MSCs have been performed on pericytes from these organs (Chen et al., 2015Chen W.C. Baily J.E. Corselli M. Díaz M.E. Sun B.

Major domains of Tbx18 expression during embryogenesis have been previously described (Cai et al., 2008Cai C.L. Martin J.C. Sun Y. Cui L. Wang L. Ouyang K. Yang L. Bu L. Liang X. Zhang X. et al.A myocardial lineage derives from Tbx18 epicardial cells.Nature. 2008; 454: 104-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar, Kraus et al., 2001Kraus F. Haenig B. Kispert A. Cloning and expression analysis of the mouse T-box gene Tbx18.Mech. Dev. 2001; 100: 83-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), but little is known regarding Tbx18 expression in adulthood. To investigate whether this gene was actively expressed in adult tissues, multiple organs were dissected from 8-week-old Tbx18H2B-GFP/WT mice (Cai et al., 2008Cai C.L. Martin J.C. Sun Y. Cui L. Wang L. Ouyang K. Yang L. Bu L. Liang X. Zhang X. et al.A myocardial lineage derives from Tbx18 epicardial cells.Nature. 2008; 454: 104-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar) and processed for histological analyses. As displayed in Figures 1A–1K, nuclear GFP fluorescence (previously shown to faithfully report active Tbx18 expression; Cai et al., 2008Cai C.L. Martin J.C. Sun Y. Cui L. Wang L. Ouyang K. Yang L. Bu L. Liang X.

In addition to expression by numerous interstitial cells, a robust GFP signal was also detected in smooth muscle of the aorta and ureters (Figures 1L and 1M) and in the membranous linings of several organs (pia mater, epicardium, and pleura). In the heart, GFP fluorescence was also detected in pacemaker cells of the sino-atrial node (Figure 1N), a population known to be TBX18 dependent (Kapoor et al., 2013Kapoor N. Liang W. Marbán E.

Res. 2009; 104: 388-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). No detectable GFP signal was observed in the kidney, gastrointestinal tract, or its accessory glands (Figures 1P–1T). We subsequently investigated the cell identity of interstitial Tbx18-expressing cells. Immunohistochemistry of brain, cardiac and skeletal muscle, and brown and white fat depots using markers specifically recognizing highly specialized cell types of these organs and the basement membrane marker Laminin demonstrated that Tbx18-GFP+ interstitial cells did not correspond to parenchymal cells and were separated from these by a well defined basal lamina (Figure S1B). This observation placed interstitial Tbx18-GFP+ cells as components of the stromal vascular fraction. Immunostaining with an anti-CD45 antibody demonstrated that interstitial Tbx18-GFP+ cells did not belong to the myeloid lineage (Figure S1C). Further analyses showed that Tbx18-GFP+ cells did not express the endothelial marker CD31/platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule 1 (PECAM1) but were always located in the immediate vicinity of vascular endothelial cells, expressed the pan-pericyte marker CD140b/PDGFRβ, and had cytoplasmic projections enveloping smaller caliber vessels (Figure 2A). In the vicinity of larger arterioles and arteries, Tbx18-GFP+ cells were spindle-shaped, and expressed markers of vascular smooth muscle (Figure 2B). The vast majority of interstitial Tbx18-GFP+ cells were negative for the fibroblast marker CD140a/PDGFRα, with the exception of a very small subset of Tbx18-GFP+ cells, mainly in the vicinity of large vessels (Figures S2G–S2L). Interstitial Tbx18-GFP+ cells expressed CD146 (a marker of mural cells and endothelium; Figures S2A–S2F) as well as the pericyte and vascular smooth muscle marker NG2 (Figures S2G–S2L). Additional histological analyses using markers frequently used for the isolation of tissue-resident progenitors (Figure S3) allowed us to define a generic cell-surface antigen profile of interstitial Tbx18-expressing cells of brain, retina, cardiac ventricles, skeletal muscle, and fat depots as CD31−, CD34−, CD45−, CD117−, Sca1−, CD29+, CD140b+, CD146+, and NG2+ (Table S1). Distribution, morphology, and cell-surface antigen signatures unequivocally identified interstitial Tbx18-GFP+ cells of fat depots, central nervous system (CNS), and cardiac and skeletal muscle as pericytes and vascular smooth muscle. Immuno-gold electron microscopy analyses confirmed the identity of Tbx18-GFP+ cells as mural cells, including pericytes (Figure S2M). Importantly, in these organs, Tbx18-GFP expression did not mark a subset of mural cells but rather labeled all pericytes (defined as PDGFRβ+, CD146+ double-positive cells; Figures 2C and S3Q) and vascular smooth muscle cells (identified as αSMA+ cells; Figure 2D). Moreover, our analyses revealed that, in such organs, all perivascular Tbx18-GFP+ cells were pericytes or vascular smooth muscle cells, as they always expressed markers of pericytes or vascular smooth muscle. However, we cannot exclude that other perivascular mesenchymal lineages might express Tbx18 at levels below our threshold of detection. Based on the membrane antigen profile of mural cells (Table S1), we established a fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) protocol that, using Tbx18-H2B:GFP fluorescence and two fluorophore-conjugated antibodies recognizing CD146 and CD31, allowed for isolation of highly purified populations of pericytes and vascular smooth muscle and endothelium from multiple tissues (Figures S4A and S4B). Utilizing this protocol, we isolated pericytes and vascular smooth muscle cells from peri-gonadal white adipose depots of Tbx18H2B-GFP/WT animals. These cells could be kept in culture for longer than 6 months (23 passages), retaining expression of Tbx18 and mesenchymal markers (Figure S4C). Interestingly, Tbx18 expression levels were considerably lower than those observed in vivo, and detection of the nuclear signal from the Tbx18-H2B:GFP allele required the use of an anti-GFP antibody. Recent studies revealed that sustained Tbx18 expression depends on short-range signals from neighboring cells (Bohnenpoll et al., 2013Bohnenpoll T. Bettenhausen E. Weiss A.C. Foik A.B. Trowe M.O. Blank P. Airik R. Kispert A. Tbx18 expression demarcates multipotent precursor populations in the developing urogenital system but is exclusively required within the ureteric mesenchymal lineage to suppress a renal stromal fate.Dev. Biol. 2013; 380: 25-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), and it is possible that the observed Tbx18 downregulation is a consequence of removing these cells from their endogenous niche. In keeping with the reported plasticity of pericytes in vitro, when cultured in the appropriate media, Tbx18+ cells could differentiate into fat, bone, and cartilage, as expected from MSCs (Figures S4D–S4F). These observations confirmed that cultured Tbx18-GFP+ pericytes and vascular smooth muscle cells behaved as MSCs in vitro. However, they did not address whether these cells would exhibit similar properties in their in vivo niche (Snippert and Clevers, 2011Snippert H.J. Clevers H. Tracking adult stem cells.EMBO Rep. 2011; 12: 113-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). A substantial amount of in vivo evidence placing pericytes as tissue-resident progenitors is derived from genetic lineage tracing experiments using the Pdgfrb-Cre mouse line, in which expression of a constitutive Cre is under the control of a fragment of the Pdgfrb promoter (Foo et al., 2006Foo S.S. Turner C.J. Adams S. Compagni A. Aubyn D. Kogata N. Lindblom P. Shani M. Zicha D. Adams R.H. Ephrin-B2 controls cell motility and adhesion during blood-vessel-wall assembly.Cell. 2006; 124: 161-173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). In adult animals, PDGFRβ expression is confined to pericytes, vascular smooth muscle, and a restricted subset of other stromal lineages (Armulik et al., 2011Armulik A. Genové G. Betsholtz C. Pericytes: developmental, physiological, and pathological perspectives, problems, and promises.Dev. Cell. 2011; 21: 193-215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1714) Google Scholar). However, during embryogenesis, PDGFRβ is broadly expressed throughout the embryo (Figure 3A). We have found that Pdgfrb-Cre extensively labels multiple cellular lineages from early developmental time points (Figure 3A). Pdgfrb-Cre labels embryonic hemogenic endothelium and produces extensive labeling of hematopoietic lineages in adult animals (90% of bone marrow cells vs. 96% labeled by Tie2-Cre; Figure 3B). Extensive labeling was also observed in adult kidney, lungs, skeletal muscle, and brain (Figure 3C). These patterns of widespread labeling cannot be accounted for by transdifferentiation of pericytes into other cellular lineages and highlight the unsuitability of Pdgfrb-Cre for selective cell fate tracing of mural cells, including pericytes. To specifically test the in vivo progenitor potential of pericytes, we generated an engineered Tbx18 allele in which a Cre-ERT2 cassette, encoding a tamoxifen-inducible variant of Cre recombinase, was inserted 8 bp downstream of the start codon (Figure 4A). Intra-peritoneal administration of 1 mg tamoxifen to adult (8-week-old) Tbx18CreERT2/Wt;Rosa26tdToma/Wt animals for three consecutive days (Figure 4B) produced robust and reproducible labeling of more than 90% of pericytes and 85% of vascular smooth muscle in brain, heart, and brown and white fat depots (Figures 4C, 4D, and S5). Importantly, immunohistochemistry for Cre recombinase at time 0 revealed that, in Tbx18-CreERT2; tdTomato-labeled pericytes, CreERT2 protein was localized to the nucleus. However, in non-tdTomato-labeled pericytes, CreERT2 protein, despite being present at levels comparable to those of tdTomato-labeled cells, was not localized to the nucleus. These observations demonstrated that absence of tdTomato labeling in a small fraction of mural cells (5%–10% of pericytes and 10%–15% of vascular smooth muscle cells, depending on the tissue being considered; Figures 4C and 4D) reflect a lack of Tbx18-CreERT2 activation in this small fraction of Tbx18-CreERT2-expressing cells rather than constitute evidence for the existence of a Tbx18- or Tbx18low subset of mural cells. Tbx18-CreERT2 also produced extremely efficient labeling of the membranous linings of the brain and heart, pia mater, and epicardium, respectively. These labeling patterns completely mirrored domains of active Tbx18 expression observed using the Tbx18-H2B:GFP allele. To investigate whether pericytes serve, during aging, as tissue resident progenitors that transdifferentiate into distinct cell lineages, organs were collected from Tbx18CreERT2/Wt;Rosa26tdToma/Wt animals 8 and 87 weeks post-induction. Surprisingly, analysis of brain, heart, skeletal muscle, and brown and white adipose depots revealed that Tbx18-CreERT2 lineage-traced cells retained PDGFRβ expression throughout the experimental time course and did not significantly contribute to other cell lineages. In brain, lineage-traced cells did not co-localize with neuronal or glial markers (Figures 4E–4G; 3 animals per time point, 12 histological sections per animal), and in the heart, lineage-traced cells did not co-localize with cardiomyocyte markers (Figures 4H–4J; 3 animals per time point, 12 histological sections per animal). In distinct fat depots, labeled adipocytes were extremely rare (less than 0.01%), similar to labeling frequencies observed at time 0 (3 animals per time point, 12 histological sections per animal; Figures 4K–4P). Absence of transdifferentiation of pericytes contradicted the expectation that pericytes are multipotent tissue-resident progenitors that can contribute multiple cell types toward organ homeostasis during aging. Pericytes have been designated a source of white adipocyte progenitors (Tang et al., 2008Tang W. Zeve D. Suh J.M. Bosnakovski D. Kyba M. Hammer R.E. Tallquist M.D. Graff J.M. White fat progenitor cells reside in the adipose vasculature.Science. 2008; 322: 583-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (840) Google Scholar) and recent reports suggested that at least a subset of beige adipocytes is derived from smooth muscle (Long et al., 2014Long J.Z. Svensson K.J. Tsai L. Zeng X. Roh H.C. Kong X. Rao R.R. Lou J. Lokurkar I. Baur W. et al.A smooth muscle-like origin for beige adipocytes.Cell Metab. 2014; 19: 810-820Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). In this context, the clinical importance of mural cells is not associated with tissue regeneration, but rather is linked to obesity and associated metabolic disorders, being a cell type to target to prevent excessive production of new fat-storing cells. Lineage tracing using Pdgfrb-Cre and in vitro differentiation experiments were the basis of previous reports suggesting pericytes as adipocyte progenitors (Tang et al., 2008Tang W. Zeve D. Suh J.M. Bosnakovski D. Kyba M. Hammer R.E. Tallquist M.D. Graff J.M. White fat progenitor cells reside in the adipose vasculature.Science. 2008; 322: 583-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (840) Google Scholar). However, as shown in Figure 3, Pdgfrb-Cre is unsuitable for pericyte-specific lineage tracing. Our pulse-chase studies using the Tbx18-CreERT2 allele suggested that neither pericytes or vascular smooth muscle had the potential to directly contribute to adipocytes during aging (Figures 4K–4P). Animals utilized in these experiments were maintained on a lean diet, and we wondered whether manifestation of the adipogenic potential of pericytes might require a strong adipogenic stimulus. To test this, we subjected Tbx18CreERT2/Wt;Rosa26tdToma/Wt animals to a high-fat regimen. Animals were induced with tamoxifen at 8 weeks of age and subsequently transferred to a high-fat diet. After 6 weeks of treatment, animals were euthanized and relevant fat depots were harvested for histological analyses (Figure 5A). As expected, this diet was a strong adipogenic stimulus, with high-fat-chow-fed mice displaying a 29% increase in body weight over the 6-week period versus a 12% increase in body weight for lean-chow-fed controls (Figure 5B). High-fat-diet-treated mice displayed enlarged adipose depots and hepatic steatosis (Figure 5C). To investigate whether lineage-traced pericytes or vascular smooth muscle had converted into lipid-storing cells, histological sections from three major fat depots (interscapular brown, perigonadal white, and inguinal white) were immunostained using an anti-perilipin antibody to unequivocally identify adipocytes. As a positive control for adipocyte labeling by tdTomato, sections of similar tissues isolated from Pdgfrb-Cre:Rosa26tdTomato/Wt animals kept on lean chow were used. As observed in Figures 5D–5F, Pdgfrb-Cre labeled the majority of adipocytes, regardless of the fat depot considered. On the other hand, as shown in Figures 5G–5L, in the three types of fat depots analyzed, Tbx18-CreERT2 lineage-traced cells did not colocalize with the adipocyte marker perilipin, except for extremely rare events that occurred at a frequency similar to that observed at time 0 (less than 0.01% of adipocytes labeled; four animals, 16 histological sections per animal) but rather retained PDGFRβ expression (Figures 5M–5O), revealing that these cells had maintained their pericyte or vascular smooth muscle cell phenotype throughout the time course of the experiment. These results indicated that even under a strong adipogenic stimulus, adult pericytes and vascular smooth muscle cells did not transdifferentiate into adipocytes, challenging recent studies placing pericytes and vascular smooth muscle as progenitors of white and beige adipocytes, respectively (Long et al., 2014Long J.Z. Svensson K.J. Tsai L. Zeng X. Roh H.C. Kong X. Rao R.R. Lou J. Lokurkar I.

Most mammalian organs react to mechanical or biochemical stress by eliciting a fibrotic response characterized by accumulation of fibroblasts secreting high amounts of extracellular matrix (ECM). This response is initially protective by nature, but excessive or permanent fibrosis can constitute a severe limitation to tissue regeneration and limit organ function. Recent studies have suggested that pericytes are the major precursor of fibroblasts in fibrotic responses (Greenhalgh et al., 2013Greenhalgh S.N. Iredale J.P. Henderson N.C. Origins of fibrosis: pericytes take centre stage.F1000Prime Rep. 2013; 5: 37Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar).

ApoE4 constitutes the most important genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD), ApoE3 is neutral, and ApoE2 is protective. How ApoE isoforms influence AD pathogenesis, however, remains unclear. Using ES-cell-derived human neurons, we show that ApoE secreted by glia stimulates neuronal Aβ production with an ApoE4 > ApoE3 > ApoE2 potency rank order. We demonstrate that ApoE binding to ApoE receptors activates dual leucine-zipper kinase (DLK), a MAP-kinase kinase kinase that then activates MKK7 and ERK1/2 MAP kinases. Activated ERK1/2 induces cFos phosphorylation, stimulating the transcription factor AP-1, which in turn enhances transcription of amyloid-β precursor protein (APP) and thereby increases amyloid-β levels. This molecular mechanism also regulates APP transcription in mice in vivo. Our data describe a novel signal transduction pathway in neurons whereby ApoE activates a non-canonical MAP kinase cascade that enhances APP transcription and amyloid-β synthesis."

Still, only a small fraction of the human proteome has chemical ligands. Here, we describe a platform that marries fragment-based ligand discovery with quantitative chemical proteomics to map thousands of reversible small molecule-protein interactions directly in human cells, many of which can be site-specifically determined. We show that fragment hits can be advanced to furnish selective ligands that affect the activity of proteins heretofore lacking chemical probes. We further combine fragment-based chemical proteomics with phenotypic screening to identify small molecules that promote adipocyte differentiation by engaging the poorly characterized membrane protein PGRMC2. Fragment-based screening in human cells thus provides an extensive proteome-wide map of protein ligandability and facilitates the coordinated discovery of bioactive small molecules and their molecular targets."

https://openalex.org/W2580755748,"Hypoxia is a poor-prognosis microenvironmental hallmark of solid tumours, but it is unclear how it influences the fate of disseminated tumour cells (DTCs) in target organs. Here we report that hypoxic HNSCC and breast primary tumour microenvironments displayed upregulation of key dormancy (NR2F1, DEC2, p27) and hypoxia (GLUT1, HIF1α) genes. Analysis of solitary DTCs in PDX and transgenic mice revealed that post-hypoxic DTCs were frequently NR2F1hi/DEC2hi/p27hi/TGFβ2hi and dormant. NR2F1 and HIF1α were required for p27 induction in post-hypoxic dormant DTCs, but these DTCs did not display GLUT1hi expression. Post-hypoxic DTCs evaded chemotherapy and, unlike ER- breast cancer cells, post-hypoxic ER+ breast cancer cells were more prone to enter NR2F1-dependent dormancy. We propose that primary tumour hypoxic microenvironments give rise to a subpopulation of dormant DTCs that evade therapy. These post-hypoxic dormant DTCs may be the source of disease relapse and poor prognosis associated with hypoxia."
https://openalex.org/W2581248702,"Mitochondria are double-membraned organelles with variable shapes influenced by metabolic conditions, developmental stage, and environmental stimuli. Their dynamic morphology is a result of regulated and balanced fusion and fission processes. Fusion is crucial for the health and physiological functions of mitochondria, including complementation of damaged mitochondrial DNAs and the maintenance of membrane potential. Mitofusins are dynamin-related GTPases that are essential for mitochondrial fusion. They are embedded in the mitochondrial outer membrane and thought to fuse adjacent mitochondria via combined oligomerization and GTP hydrolysis. However, the molecular mechanisms of this process remain unknown. Here we present crystal structures of engineered human MFN1 containing the GTPase domain and a helical domain during different stages of GTP hydrolysis. The helical domain is composed of elements from widely dispersed sequence regions of MFN1 and resembles the 'neck' of the bacterial dynamin-like protein. The structures reveal unique features of its catalytic machinery and explain how GTP binding induces conformational changes to promote GTPase domain dimerization in the transition state. Disruption of GTPase domain dimerization abolishes the fusogenic activity of MFN1. Moreover, a conserved aspartate residue trigger was found to affect mitochondrial elongation in MFN1, probably through a GTP-loading-dependent domain rearrangement. Thus, we propose a mechanistic model for MFN1-mediated mitochondrial tethering, and our results shed light on the molecular basis of mitochondrial fusion and mitofusin-related human neuromuscular disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2576833703,"The brain is highly sensitive to proper fuel availability as evidenced by the rapid decline in neuronal function during ischemic attacks and acute severe hypoglycemia. We previously showed that sustained presynaptic function requires activity-driven glycolysis. Here, we provide strong evidence that during action potential (AP) firing, nerve terminals rely on the glucose transporter GLUT4 as a glycolytic regulatory system to meet the activity-driven increase in energy demands. Activity at synapses triggers insertion of GLUT4 into the axonal plasma membrane driven by activation of the metabolic sensor AMP kinase. Furthermore, we show that genetic ablation of GLUT4 leads to an arrest of synaptic vesicle recycling during sustained AP firing, similar to what is observed during acute glucose deprivation. The reliance on this biochemical regulatory system for ""exercising"" synapses is reminiscent of that occurring in exercising muscle to sustain cellular function and identifies nerve terminals as critical sites of proper metabolic control."
https://openalex.org/W2583057870,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) perform critical functions in normal physiology and disease by associating with Argonaute proteins and downregulating partially complementary messenger RNAs (mRNAs). Here we use clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) and CRISPR-associated protein 9 (Cas9) genome-wide loss-of-function screening coupled with a fluorescent reporter of miRNA activity in human cells to identify new regulators of the miRNA pathway. By using iterative rounds of screening, we reveal a novel mechanism whereby target engagement by Argonaute 2 (AGO2) triggers its hierarchical, multi-site phosphorylation by CSNK1A1 on a set of highly conserved residues (S824-S834), followed by rapid dephosphorylation by the ANKRD52-PPP6C phosphatase complex. Although genetic and biochemical studies demonstrate that AGO2 phosphorylation on these residues inhibits target mRNA binding, inactivation of this phosphorylation cycle globally impairs miRNA-mediated silencing. Analysis of the transcriptome-wide binding profile of non-phosphorylatable AGO2 reveals a pronounced expansion of the target repertoire bound at steady-state, effectively reducing the active pool of AGO2 on a per-target basis. These findings support a model in which an AGO2 phosphorylation cycle stimulated by target engagement regulates miRNA:target interactions to maintain the global efficiency of miRNA-mediated silencing."

Here we show in a transgenic mouse model expressing mutant human tau predominantly in the EC that the formation of mature tangles in old mice was associated with excitatory cell loss and deficits in grid cell function, including destabilized grid fields and reduced firing rates, as well as altered network activity. Overt tau pathology in the aged mice was accompanied by spatial memory deficits. Therefore, tau pathology initiated in the entorhinal cortex could lead to deficits in grid cell firing and underlie the deterioration of spatial cognition seen in human AD."

Combinatorial application of six pathway inhibitors induces post-mitotic cortical neurons with functional electrophysiological properties by day 16 of differentiation, in the absence of glial cell co-culture. The resulting neurons, transplanted at 8 d of differentiation into the postnatal mouse cortex, are functional and establish long-distance projections, as shown using iDISCO whole-brain imaging.

The microbiota influence host biology in numerous ways, very few of which are understood at the level of molecular mechanism (Donia and Fischbach, 2015Donia M.S. Fischbach M.A. HUMAN MICROBIOTA.

In a previous survey of biosynthetic gene clusters from the human microbiome, we reported the presence of thousands of biosynthetic loci of unknown function, including large families that are present in >50% of the subjects from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Human Microbiome Project (Donia et al., 2014Donia M.S. Cimermancic P. Schulze C.J. Wieland Brown L.C. Martin J. Mitreva M. Clardy J. Linington R.G.

The small-molecule products of these genetic elements represent large gaps in our knowledge of what the microbiota are capable of producing and constitute an enticing opportunity to discover new mediators of interspecies interactions. As a test case for expanding our knowledge of the biosynthetic capacity of the microbiota, we set out to characterize a family of nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) gene clusters that are found in a variety of gut bacterial genome sequences (Donia et al., 2014Donia M.S. Cimermancic P. Schulze C.J. Wieland Brown L.C. Martin J. Mitreva M. Clardy J. Linington R.G. Fischbach M.A. A systematic analysis of biosynthetic gene clusters in the human microbiome reveals a common family of antibiotics.Cell. 2014; 158: 1402-1414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). These clusters attracted our attention for two reasons. First, they are present in >90% of the stool samples from the Human Microbiome Project (HMP), suggesting that the metabolites they encode are widely distributed among healthy humans. Second, they reside almost exclusively in gut bacterial genome sequences; only a few environmental isolates harbor a cluster in the family, raising the possibility that their small-molecule products play a role in interspecies signaling in the gut. We began by performing a multi-gene BLAST search (Medema et al., 2013Medema M.H. Takano E. Breitling R. Detecting sequence homology at the gene cluster level with MultiGeneBlast.Mol. Biol. Evol. 2013; 30: 1218-1223Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar) to identify new clusters in the family from genome sequences that had been deposited since our previous analysis. This search yielded 19 new clusters at a threshold of 30% average sequence identity, increasing the size of the family to 47 (Figure 1). The resulting reanalysis shows a family that has the following characteristics. (1) It consists of four clades: one features a three-module NRPS (e.g., bgc52), another a two-module NRPS and a loading module on a separate protein (e.g., bgc35), a third consists solely of a two-module NRPS (e.g., bgc26), and a fourth contains NRPSs of variable domain architecture. In every case, the NRPS features a terminal reductase (R) domain. (2) Almost all of the gene clusters are found in anaerobic Firmicutes from the class Clostridia, although a few of the clusters are found in Gram-negative organisms (Bacteroides and Desulfovibrio). (3) Nearly all of the clusters reside in isolates from the human gut and that of other mammals (Figure 1). Very few of the clusters are found in relatives of these organisms that are free-living or inhabit a non-intestinal host-associated niche, implying a function that is relevant to the biology of host colonization. (4) Each clade contains clusters from hosts that have never been isolated; genome sequences of the hosts from which these clusters derive were assembled from metagenomic samples in a recent study (Nielsen et al., 2014Nielsen H.B. Almeida M. Juncker A.S. Rasmussen S. Li J. Sunagawa S. Plichta D.R. Gautier L. Pedersen A.G. Le Chatelier E. et al.MetaHIT ConsortiumIdentification and assembly of genomes and genetic elements in complex metagenomic samples without using reference genomes.Nat. Biotechnol. 2014; 32: 822-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar). As such, the only way to access these clusters is to synthesize them, a problem of increasing importance as the volume of metagenomic sequence data increases and tools are developed for assembling short-read metagenomic data into cluster-size fragments. We selected 14 of these clusters for analysis (colored red or blue in Figure 1). Clusters were chosen to represent the diversity of sequences and domain architectures from the four clades of the family. Since none of the host organisms have been manipulated genetically and most are from a bacterial class (Clostridia) that is largely refractory to genetic manipulation, we decided not to make targeted genetic deletions in any of the native host strains. Instead, we expressed gene clusters heterologously in two commonly used laboratory hosts, Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis. The host organisms of three of the clusters (bgc34, bgc35, and bgc52) were available from laboratories or culture collections; clusters from these hosts were cloned in their native form (omitting regulatory genes) into E. coli or B. subtilis vectors in which expression was driven by a strong promoter (see Figure S1 for more details). The remaining 11 clusters were either from organisms that could not be obtained or from metagenomic sequence data, so the host organism was never isolated. These clusters were synthesized directly from primary genome or metagenome sequence with optimized codons (leaving out regulatory genes) and cloned into E. coli or B. subtilis expression vectors under the control of a strong promoter. Cluster-harboring strains were cultivated at 5 mL scale for 1–2 days to determine whether they produce a pathway-specific metabolite. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) analysis of culture fluid extract from E. coli strains harboring bgc35 and bgc52 showed evidence of seven and eight new peaks, respectively (Figure 2), which is notable, since both clusters are from Gram-positive hosts. From 4 L of culture fluid, we purified multi-milligram quantities of each compound (Figure 2). Three lines of evidence reveal that these molecules are a family of pyrazinones and dihydropyrazinones: (1) the purified compounds have UV absorption maxima at 220 and 300 nm, consistent with a pyrazinone core; (2) high-resolution LC-MS analysis of the compounds yields masses and empirical formulae consistent with a series of α-amino-acid-derived pyrazinones and dihydropyrazinones with variable side chains at both positions (Table S4); and (3) 1D and 2D nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) experiments show chemical shifts and correlations characteristic of pyrazinones (Data S1) (MacDonald et al., 1976MacDonald J.C. Bishop G.G. Mazurek M. 13C and proton NMR spectra of 2(1H)pyrazinones.Tetrahedron. 1976; 32: 655-660Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar). An E. coli strain harboring bgc34 produced a subset of the bgc35 products, but at a level so low it would not have been observed without a targeted mass ion search. Results from two other clusters showed additional modes of diversity in the family. When bgc38 was expressed in B. subtilis, we observed one new peak corresponding to a pyrazinone with ethyl and methylindole side chains, indicating that α-aminobutyrate (or an unknown precursor) can be a native monomer; bgc39 was a low-level producer of the bgc38 products. bgc33 and bgc86 were of particular interest; these clusters were discovered from a metagenomic sample, so their host organisms were never isolated (Figure 1). An E. coli strain carrying a synthetic, codon-optimized version of bgc33 yielded two classes of molecules: a pyrazinone that derives from methionine and valine (15) and a corresponding set of N-acylated dipeptide aldehydes, including one that bears an N-octanoyl acyl chain (16) (Figure 2; Table S5). In comparison, only the pyrazinone product (15) can be identified from the E. coli strain harboring bgc86. In addition to the 16 molecules that were produced at a titer sufficient to purify milligram quantities for NMR experiments, we identified 16 additional pathway-dependent molecules from bgc35 and bgc52. These metabolites are produced at a lower titer and their structures are proposed on the basis of diagnostic high-resolution tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) fragmentation patterns (Figure S2; Table S4). In addition to the seven clusters from which we observed products, seven additional clusters were synthesized and expressed in E. coli DH10β, E. coli BAP1, or B. subtilis 168 (colored blue in Figure 1); no high-titer products were observed from any of these BGCs using an LC-MS trace comparison. In total, from 7 of 14 heterologously expressed clusters, we discovered 32 compounds, of which 28 are previously unknown molecules (Figure 2; Table S4). The results from our heterologous expression experiments raise an important question: Are the molecules we isolated the native products of the cluster or artifacts of expression in E. coli or B. subtilis? To address this question, we used two complementary approaches. First, we cultivated the bgc52 producer, Ruminococcus sp. 5_1_39BFAA, in 12 different culture media in an effort to find a condition under which we could observe production of the bgc52 products. LC-MS analysis of cell-free culture extracts from one of the media, M17, revealed peaks identical to five of the most prominent compounds produced under conditions of heterologous expression in E. coli (Figure S3), suggesting that these pyrazinones are the native products of bgc52 (it is unlikely these compounds derive from a different biosynthetic pathway in the same organism, since Ruminococcus sp. 5_1_39BFAA harbors only one additional nonribosomal peptide synthetase in its genome, a condensation-thiolation di-domain protein). Using a similar approach, we could not find a condition under which the bgc35 producer, Clostridium sp. KLE 1755, produced the molecules we observed from E. coli-bgc35. As an alternative approach, we overexpressed the 280-kDa, two-module bgc35 NRPS in E. coli and purified it as an N-terminal His6 fusion protein. We then attempted to reconstitute the biosynthetic pathway by incubating the NRPS with Sfp and coenzyme A (to 4′-phosphopantetheinylate both thiolation domains), amino acid substrates (either all 20 proteinogenic amino acids or aromatic amino acids only), ATP for monomer activation, and NADH as a cofactor for the terminal reductase domain. LC-MS analysis of a time course of this reaction showed the formation of two products identical to compounds 2 and 4, suggesting that these are native products of bgc35 (Figure 2). Having identified the small-molecule products of a subset of the gut NRPS family, we next turned to the question of how widely distributed this cluster family is in the human population. In previous work, we showed that of the smaller subset of 28 clusters that were known at the time, at least one cluster was present in >90% of the ∼100 stool metagenomic samples from HMP phase 1. These data were derived from a global analysis that involved mapping metagenomic reads to proteins from 14,000 biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) using the fast, metagenomics-optimized algorithm mBLASTx (Donia et al., 2014Donia M.S. Cimermancic P. Schulze C.J. Wieland Brown L.C. Martin J. Mitreva M. Clardy J. Linington R.G. Fischbach M.A. A systematic analysis of biosynthetic gene clusters in the human microbiome reveals a common family of antibiotics.Cell. 2014; 158: 1402-1414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). Here, we used two complementary methods to determine the abundance of the gut NRPS family in publicly available metagenomic datasets. First, since we had a smaller set of BGCs to map, we developed a highly sensitive and specific analytical method in which we used BLASTn to map quality-filtered metagenomic reads from the 149 metagenomic stool samples from HMP phase 1 to the large NRPS gene in each BGC. Using this analysis, we found that at least one of the clusters is present in >88% of the 149 stool samples. Second, we used a recently developed approach that leverages a large gene catalog of >9 million gut microbiome genes (Li et al., 2014Li J. Jia H. Cai X. Zhong H. Feng Q. Sunagawa S. Arumugam M. Kultima J.R. Prifti E. Nielsen T. et al.An integrated catalog of reference genes in the human gut microbiome.Nat.

MetaQuery: a web server for rapid annotation and quantitative analysis of specific genes in the human gut microbiome.Bioinformatics. 2015; 31: 3368-3370Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) and found that at least one of the clusters was present in >93% of 1,267 publicly available stool samples (minimum abundance = 1 copy/1,000 cells). Together, these results confirm that this gene cluster family is widely distributed in healthy human subjects. A cluster might be present in a metagenomic sample, but not expressed in the gut; indeed, many metabolic pathways present in metagenomic samples are expressed at very low levels in corresponding metatranscriptomic datasets (Franzosa et al., 2014Franzosa E.A.

Moya A. Metatranscriptomic approach to analyze the functional human gut microbiota.PLoS ONE. 2011; 6: e17447-e17449Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). To address whether the gut NRPS clusters are transcribed under conditions of native host colonization, we recruited reads from publicly available RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) datasets from the stool samples of eight healthy subjects (Franzosa et al., 2014Franzosa E.A. Morgan X.C. Segata N. Waldron L. Reyes J. Earl A.M. Giannoukos G. Boylan M.R. Ciulla D. Gevers D. et al.Relating the metatranscriptome and metagenome of the human gut.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2014; 111: E2329-E2338Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). Illumina reads from several runs on each sample were combined and used to construct a BLAST database, which we then searched using the 47 full-length gut NRPS BGCs as query sequences. Seven of the eight samples (87.5%) harbored at least one actively transcribed gene cluster from this family, and the robust level of transcription observed in most samples is notable, given that the anaerobic Firmicutes from which the gut NRPS clusters derive are often lower-abundance members of the community (Figures 3 and S4).Figure S4Metatranscriptomic Analyses of BGCs in Figure 1, Related to Figures 1 and 3View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The NRPSs in this family harbor a C-terminal reductase domain that catalyzes the chain-terminating release of a C-terminal aldehyde (Figures 1 and 3). The newly liberated dipeptide aldehydes exist in equilibrium with the cyclic imine; in the presence of oxygen, this dihydropyrazinone oxidizes spontaneously and irreversibly to the fully aromatic pyrazinone. Three lines of evidence suggest that the active form of the gut NRPS product is the initially released dipeptide aldehyde: First, under physiological conditions, the peptide aldehydes are stable for long enough to be active. We measured the half-life of oxidation for three compounds (the peptide aldehyde versions of 5, 10, and 12) in vitro at physiological pH; they ranged from 3 to 28 hr (Figure S5), which would provide sufficient time for systemic distribution in the host. Indeed, compounds 1 and 2 are stable enough that we isolate milligram quantities of the cyclic imine after >24 hr of aerobic E. coli culture. Moreover, these molecules are produced in the gut, which is anaerobic, so the slow process of spontaneous oxidation would not begin until the compounds encounter oxygenated host tissues. Notably, the major product of bgc33, N-octanoyl-Met-Phe-H (16), is N-acylated, preventing it from cyclizing and oxidizing to a pyrazinone. These findings raise the possibility that peptide aldehydes are the predominant active product of every cluster in the family. Second, peptide aldehydes have a long history in the literature of being highly potent, cell-permeable protease inhibitors. Starting with the discovery of the leupeptins from soil isolates of Streptomyces almost four decades ago (Aoyagi et al., 1969aAoyagi T. Miyata S. Nanbo M. Kojima F. Matsuzaki M. Ishizuka M.

Kawamura K. Kondo S. Leupeptins, new protease inhibitors from Actinomycetes.J. Antibiot. 1969; 22: 283-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar), numerous peptide aldehydes—mostly N-carboxybenzyl (Cbz) protected di-, tri-, and tetrapeptide aldehydes—have been synthesized and shown in vitro and in vivo to have potent inhibitory activity against serine and cysteine proteases and the proteasome (Lee and Goldberg, 1998Lee D.H.

Wolfenden R. Aldehydes as inhibitors of papain.J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 8195-8197PubMed Google Scholar). Dipeptide aldehydes were the starting point for the development of the clinically used dipeptide boronate proteasome inhibitor bortezomib (Figure 3) (Adams et al., 1998Adams J. Behnke M. Chen S. Cruickshank A.A. Dick L.R. Grenier L. Klunder J.M. Ma Y.-T. Plamondon L. Stein R.L. Potent and selective inhibitors of the proteasome: dipeptidyl boronic acids.Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 1998; 8: 333-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar). Cbz-protected versions of multiple gut NRPS products, including Cbz-Val-Phe-H, have been synthesized and shown to inhibit various cysteine proteases (Mehdi et al., 1988Mehdi S. Angelastro M.R. Wiseman J.S. Bey P. Inhibition of the proteolysis of rat erythrocyte membrane proteins by a synthetic inhibitor of calpain.Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Peptidyl aldehyde derivatives as potent and selective inhibitors of cathepsin L.Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 1995; 5: 1501-1504Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Third, since dipeptide aldehydes with a free amino group have not been tested as protease inhibitors, we assessed the activity of three of the bgc52 and bgc35 products (Val-Phe-H, Leu-Phe-H, and Phe-Phe-H) and the bgc33-derived compound 16 against a panel of proteases in vitro, comparing them to the corresponding pyrazinones and N-tert-butyloxycarbonyl (N-Boc) protected dipeptide aldehydes (Figures 3 and S5). Consistent with previous reports on N-Cbz-protected dipeptide aldehydes (Mehdi et al., 1988Mehdi S. Angelastro M.R. Wiseman J.S. Bey P. Inhibition of the proteolysis of rat erythrocyte membrane proteins by a synthetic inhibitor of calpain.Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Peptidyl aldehyde derivatives as potent and selective inhibitors of cathepsin L.Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 1995; 5: 1501-1504Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar), the N-Boc protected dipeptide aldehydes were active at low- to mid-nanomolar against the lysosomal cysteine proteases cathepsins B and L. The free-amino dipeptide aldehydes had similarly potent (single-digit nanomolar) activity against cathepsin L but greatly reduced activity against cathepsin B, showing that they are capable of highly potent inhibitory activity and exhibit selectivity not seen in their N-Boc protected counterparts (Figures 3 and S5). This difference in selectivity was also seen in compound 16, which had undetectable activity against cathepsin L but 13 nM activity against cathepsin S. None of the compounds tested here had quantifiable activity against trypsin or chymotrypsin at the concentrations tested. Overall, these data suggest that the dipeptide aldehydes harbor potent and selective protease inhibitory activity, as assessed in vitro. The proteases we assayed were chosen based on literature precedent, so the enzyme inhibition data do not point to a specific target. To determine the target of the peptide aldehydes in an unbiased way, we applied a quantitative chemical proteomic method, termed isotopic tandem orthogonal proteolysis-activity-based protein profiling (isoTOP-ABPP) (Weerapana et al., 2010Weerapana E. Wang C. Simon G.M. Richter F. Khare S. Dillon M.B.D. Bachovchin D.A. Mowen K. Baker D. Cravatt B.F.

Olson A.J. et al.Proteome-wide covalent ligand discovery in native biological systems.Nature. 2016; 534: 570-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar), to measure the global interactions of a representative dipeptide aldehyde, bgc35 product Phe-Phe-H, with cysteine residues in the human cell lysates. We treated membrane preparations of the human innate immune (monocytic) cell line THP-1 with the bgc35 product Phe-Phe-H or vehicle, and then these samples were treated with a cysteine reactive iodoacetamide-alkyne (IA-alkyne) probe and conjugated to an isotopically differentiated (light or heavy, respectively) TEV protease-cleavable biotin tag using copper-catalyzed azide–alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC or click) chemistry. Vehicle- and peptide-treated samples were then combined, enriched, subjected to sequential trypsin and TEV digests, and evaluated by LC-MS/MS. Site-specific blockade of IA-alkyne labeling as measured by quantitation of heavy/light MS1 chromatographic peaks designates cysteine residues that are targeted by Phe-Phe-H (heavy/light ratios, or R values > 5, red line; Figures 3D, 3E, and S6). Treatment of THP-1 membranes with 250 nM Phe-Phe-H, the lowest concentration tested, fully blocked IA-alkyne labeling of the catalytic cysteine of cathepsin L (CTSL1; Cys138, R > 20) while showing only partial (cathepsin C [CTSC] R = 2.9 for catalytic cysteine Cys258) or negligible (R < 2.0; cathepsins B [CTSB], H [CTSH], S [CTSS], and Z [CTSZ]) cross-reactivity with other cathepsins (Figure 3D). Phe-Phe-H also interacted with a subset of additional cathepsin targets when tested at higher concentrations (25 μM; R > 5 for CTSC, CTSS, and CTSZ) in THP-1 (Figures 3D and 3E) and other human cell proteomes (Ramos, H1975; Data S2). Phe-Phe-H showed remarkable selectivity for cathepsins, exhibiting no additional targets across the more than 3,500 total quantified cysteines across three different human cell proteomes (R < 2.0; Data S2). Additional experiments at the characteristic acidic pH of the lysosome (pH 5 or 5.5), where cathepsins reside, produced similar results (Data S2). Together, these data designate the cathepsins (specifically cathepsin L) as principal targets of the gut NRPS product Phe-Phe-H. We have found 32 compounds that represent a subset of the molecular output from this family of NRPSs. Gene clusters in this family are widely distributed in the human gut microbiome, and they are transcribed robustly under conditions of host colonization. The discovery approach we used (to express cloned or synthetic BGCs in E. coli or B. subtilis) revealed two unanticipated findings that may be relevant to similar discovery efforts in the future. First, bgc35 and bgc52 were functional in E. coli in their native form (driven by an E. coli promoter); this is notable, given that these clusters are from a Gram-positive host. E. coli might therefore be an appropriate heterologous host for a broader range of gene clusters than previously imagined. Second, the E. coli strain harboring bgc34 produced a subset of the bgc35 products, but at a level so low it would not have been observed without a targeted mass ion search; likewise, bgc39 was a low-level producer of the bgc38 products. Importantly, the amino acid sequences of the NRPS genes from the bgc34-bgc35 and bgc38-bgc39 pairs share 70% and 51% identity, respectively, pointing to the potential importance of subtle changes in primary sequence that alter expression level as a determinant of whether an NRPS will work in a heterologous host. Notably, of the 4 out of 32 molecules that were previously known, three are produced by an unrelated NRPS conserved across all known skin-associated species of Staphylococcus. Thus, the gut and Staphylococcus NRPSs are an example of convergent evolution toward a common scaffold, suggesting that the same compounds might play a biological role in more than one host-associated niche (Wyatt and Magarvey, 2013Wyatt M.A. Magarvey N.A.

https://openalex.org/W2580082637,"Acute megakaryoblastic leukemia (AMKL) is a subtype of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in which cells morphologically resemble abnormal megakaryoblasts. While rare in adults, AMKL accounts for 4-15% of newly diagnosed childhood AML cases. AMKL in individuals without Down syndrome (non-DS-AMKL) is frequently associated with poor clinical outcomes. Previous efforts have identified chimeric oncogenes in a substantial number of non-DS-AMKL cases, including RBM15-MKL1, CBFA2T3-GLIS2, KMT2A gene rearrangements, and NUP98-KDM5A. However, the etiology of 30-40% of cases remains unknown. To better understand the genomic landscape of non-DS-AMKL, we performed RNA and exome sequencing on specimens from 99 patients (75 pediatric and 24 adult). We demonstrate that pediatric non-DS-AMKL is a heterogeneous malignancy that can be divided into seven subgroups with varying outcomes. These subgroups are characterized by chimeric oncogenes with cooperating mutations in epigenetic and kinase signaling genes. Overall, these data shed light on the etiology of AMKL and provide useful information for the tailoring of treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2582002895,"Cells in dense bacterial suspensions can self-organize into highly robust collective oscillatory motion, while individual cells move in an erratic manner; their interaction is modelled to reveal a weak synchronization mechanism. In recent years, various effects of collective behaviour have been reported in 'active matter'—systems that contain large numbers of self-propelled particles. Such studies offer clues to understanding organization in biological systems at various scales and to strategies for designing smart materials. Yilin Wu and colleagues studied dense suspensions of Escherichia coli bacteria and observed a striking effect of collective oscillatory motion. Individual bacteria move in an erratic manner, but when they are averaged over tens or hundreds of micrometres, steady, synchronized oscillations become apparent. The authors present a model of noisy self-propelled particles with strictly local interactions that can account for the observations. Such oscillatory behaviour could point to a new direction for studying self-organization in active matter. Collective oscillatory behaviour is ubiquitous in nature1, having a vital role in many biological processes from embryogenesis2 and organ development3 to pace-making in neuron networks4. Elucidating the mechanisms that give rise to synchronization is essential to the understanding of biological self-organization. Collective oscillations in biological multicellular systems often arise from long-range coupling mediated by diffusive chemicals2,5,6,7,8,9, by electrochemical mechanisms4,10, or by biomechanical interaction between cells and their physical environment11. In these examples, the phase of some oscillatory intracellular degree of freedom is synchronized. Here, in contrast, we report the discovery of a weak synchronization mechanism that does not require long-range coupling or inherent oscillation of individual cells. We find that millions of motile cells in dense bacterial suspensions can self-organize into highly robust collective oscillatory motion, while individual cells move in an erratic manner, without obvious periodic motion but with frequent, abrupt and random directional changes. So erratic are individual trajectories that uncovering the collective oscillations of our micrometre-sized cells requires individual velocities to be averaged over tens or hundreds of micrometres. On such large scales, the oscillations appear to be in phase and the mean position of cells typically describes a regular elliptic trajectory. We found that the phase of the oscillations is organized into a centimetre-scale travelling wave. We present a model of noisy self-propelled particles with strictly local interactions that accounts faithfully for our observations, suggesting that self-organized collective oscillatory motion results from spontaneous chiral and rotational symmetry breaking. These findings reveal a previously unseen type of long-range order in active matter systems (those in which energy is spent locally to produce non-random motion)12,13. This mechanism of collective oscillation may inspire new strategies to control the self-organization of active matter14,15,16,17,18 and swarming robots19."
https://openalex.org/W2582869721,"In transgenic mouse models of neuropsychiatric disease, loss of nicotinic cholinergic signaling in cortical inhibitory interneurons causes neurocognitive behavioral deficits and reduced neuronal activity in prefrontal circuits. Chronic administration of nicotine can restore this cortical hypofrontality phenotype. The prefrontal cortex (PFC) underlies higher cognitive processes1 that are modulated by nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) activation by cholinergic inputs2. PFC spontaneous default activity3 is altered in neuropsychiatric disorders4, including schizophrenia5—a disorder that can be accompanied by heavy smoking6. Recently, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) identified single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the human CHRNA5 gene, encoding the α5 nAChR subunit, that increase the risks for both smoking and schizophrenia7,8. Mice with altered nAChR gene function exhibit PFC-dependent behavioral deficits9,10,11, but it is unknown how the corresponding human polymorphisms alter the cellular and circuit mechanisms underlying behavior. Here we show that mice expressing a human α5 SNP exhibit neurocognitive behavioral deficits in social interaction and sensorimotor gating tasks. Two-photon calcium imaging in awake mouse models showed that nicotine can differentially influence PFC pyramidal cell activity by nAChR modulation of layer II/III hierarchical inhibitory circuits. In α5-SNP-expressing and α5-knockout mice, lower activity of vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) interneurons resulted in an increased somatostatin (SOM) interneuron inhibitory drive over layer II/III pyramidal neurons. The decreased activity observed in α5-SNP-expressing mice resembles the hypofrontality observed in patients with psychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia and addiction5,12. Chronic nicotine administration reversed this hypofrontality, suggesting that administration of nicotine may represent a therapeutic strategy for the treatment of schizophrenia, and a physiological basis for the tendency of patients with schizophrenia to self-medicate by smoking13."

Furthermore, otherwise inefficient and non-stereoselective transformations with Z-1,2-dichloroethene and 1,2-dibromoethene can be effected with substantially improved efficiency and Z selectivity.

In this study, we describe the equilibrium ensemble of structures of Slo2.2, a neuronal Na+-activated K+ channel, as a function of the Na+ concentration. We find that Slo2.2 exists in multiple closed conformations whose relative occupancies are independent of Na+ concentration. An open conformation emerges from an ensemble of closed conformations in a highly Na+-dependent manner, without evidence of Na+-dependent intermediates. In other words, channel opening is a highly concerted, switch-like process. The midpoint of the structural titration matches that of the functional titration. A maximum open conformation probability approaching 1.0 and maximum functional open probability approaching 0.7 imply that, within the class of open channels, there is a subclass that is not permeable to ions."
https://openalex.org/W2582553588,"Afferent inputs to the ventral tegmental area (VTA) control reward-related behaviors through regulation of dopamine neuron activity. The nucleus accumbens (NAc) provides one of the most prominent projections to the VTA; however, recent studies have provided conflicting evidence regarding the function of these inhibitory inputs. Using optogenetics, cell-specific ablation, whole cell patch-clamp and immuno-electron microscopy, we found that NAc inputs synapsed directly onto dopamine neurons, preferentially activating GABAB receptors. GABAergic inputs from the NAc and local VTA GABA neurons were differentially modulated and activated separate receptor populations in dopamine neurons. Genetic deletion of GABAB receptors from dopamine neurons in adult mice did not affect general or morphine-induced locomotor activity, but markedly increased cocaine-induced locomotion. Collectively, our findings demonstrate notable selectivity in the inhibitory architecture of the VTA and suggest that long-range GABAergic inputs to dopamine neurons fundamentally regulate behavioral responses to cocaine."
https://openalex.org/W2581845926,"The cellular mechanisms governing non-muscle myosin II (NM2) filament assembly are largely unknown. Using EGFP-NM2A knock-in fibroblasts and multiple super-resolution imaging modalities, we characterized and quantified the sequential amplification of NM2 filaments within lamellae, wherein filaments emanating from single nucleation events continuously partition, forming filament clusters that populate large-scale actomyosin structures deeper in the cell. Individual partitioning events coincide spatially and temporally with the movements of diverging actin fibres, suppression of which inhibits partitioning. These and other data indicate that NM2A filaments are partitioned by the dynamic movements of actin fibres to which they are bound. Finally, we showed that partition frequency and filament growth rate in the lamella depend on MLCK, and that MLCK is competing with centrally active ROCK for a limiting pool of monomer with which to drive lamellar filament assembly. Together, our results provide new insights into the mechanism and spatio-temporal regulation of NM2 filament assembly in cells.

https://openalex.org/W2580202267,"Substantial evidence suggests that breast cancer initiation, recurrence and drug resistance is supported by breast cancer stem cells (BCSCs). Recently, we reported a novel role of Aurora kinase A (AURKA) in BCSCs, as a transactivating co-factor in the induction of the c-Myc oncoprotein. However, the mode of action and transcriptional network of nuclear AURKA in BCSCs remain unknown. Here, we report that nuclear AURKA can be recruited by Forkhead box subclass M1 (FOXM1) as a co-factor to transactivate FOXM1 target genes in a kinase-independent manner. In addition, we show that AURKA and FOXM1 participate in a tightly coupled positive feedback loop to enhance BCSC phenotype. Indeed, kinase-dead AURKA can effectively transactivate the FOXM1 promoter through a Forkhead response element, whereas FOXM1 can activate AURKA expression at the transcriptional level in a similar manner. Consistently, breast cancer patient samples portrayed a strong and significant correlation between the expression levels of FOXM1 and AURKA. Moreover, both FOXM1 and AURKA were essential for maintaining the BCSC population. Finally, we demonstrated that the AURKA inhibitor AKI603 and FOXM1 inhibitor thiostrepton acted synergistically to inhibit cytoplasmic AURKA activity and disrupt the nuclear AURKA/FOXM1-positive feedback loop, respectively, resulting in a more effective inhibition of the tumorigenicity and self-renewal ability of BCSCs. Collectively, our study uncovers a previously unknown tightly coupled positive feedback signalling loop between AURKA and FOXM1, crucial for BCSC self-renewal. Remarkably, our data reveal a novel potential therapeutic strategy for targeting both the cytoplasmic and nuclear AURKA function to effectively eliminate BCSCs, so as to overcome both breast cancer and drug resistance."

We uncovered both common as well as specific MLL-AF9 and MLL-AF4 target genes, which were all marked by H3K79me2, H3K27ac and H3K4me3. Apart from promoter binding, we also identified MLL-AF9 and MLL-AF4 binding at specific subsets of non-overlapping active distal regulatory elements. Despite this differential enhancer binding, MLL-AF9 and MLL-AF4 still direct a common gene program, which represents part of the RUNX1 gene program and constitutes of CD34+ and monocyte-specific genes. Comparing these data sets identified several zinc finger transcription factors (TFs) as potential MLL-AF9 co-regulators.

Genetically determined accessibility was enriched at distal enhancers, but random monoallelically accessible (RAMA) elements were enriched at promoters and may act as gatekeepers of monoallelic mRNA expression. Allelic choice at RAMA elements was stable across cell generations and bookmarked through mitosis. RAMA elements in neural progenitor cells were biallelically accessible in embryonic stem cells but premarked with bivalent histone modifications; one allele was silenced during differentiation. Quantitative analysis indicated that allelic choice at the majority of RAMA elements is consistent with a stochastic process; however, up to 30% of RAMA elements may deviate from the expected pattern, suggesting a regulated or counting mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W2580946396,"Opportunistic fungal infections are a leading cause of death among immune-compromised patients, and there is a pressing need to develop new antifungal therapeutic agents because of toxicity and resistance to the antifungal drugs currently in use. Although C-type lectin receptor- and Toll-like receptor-induced signaling pathways are key activators of host antifungal immunity, little is known about the mechanisms that negatively regulate host immune responses to a fungal infection. Here we found that JNK1 activation suppresses antifungal immunity in mice. We showed that JNK1-deficient mice had a significantly higher survival rate than wild-type control mice in response to Candida albicans infection, and the expression of JNK1 in hematopoietic innate immune cells was critical for this effect. JNK1 deficiency leads to significantly higher induction of CD23, a novel C-type lectin receptor, through NFATc1-mediated regulation of the CD23 gene promoter. Blocking either CD23 upregulation or CD23-dependent nitric oxide production eliminated the enhanced antifungal response found in JNK1-deficient mice. Notably, JNK inhibitors exerted potent antifungal therapeutic effects in both mouse and human cells infected with C. albicans, indicating that JNK1 may be a therapeutic target for treating fungal infection."
https://openalex.org/W2572503237,"Synaptic vesicle recycling is essential for maintaining normal synaptic function. The coupling of exocytosis and endocytosis is assumed to be Ca2+ dependent, but the exact role of Ca2+ and its key effector synaptotagmin-1 (syt1) in regulation of endocytosis is poorly understood. Here, we probed the role of syt1 in single- as well as multi-vesicle endocytic events using high-resolution optical recordings. Our experiments showed that the slowed endocytosis phenotype previously reported after syt1 loss of function can also be triggered by other manipulations that promote asynchronous release such as Sr2+ substitution and complexin loss of function. The link between asynchronous release and slowed endocytosis was due to selective targeting of fused synaptic vesicles toward slow retrieval by the asynchronous release Ca2+ sensor synaptotagmin-7. In contrast, after single synaptic vesicle fusion, syt1 acted as an essential determinant of synaptic vesicle endocytosis time course by delaying the kinetics of vesicle retrieval in response to increasing Ca2+ levels."
https://openalex.org/W2580165755,"Adaptive social behavior requires transmission and reception of salient social information. Impairment of this reciprocity is a cardinal symptom of autism. The amygdala is a critical mediator of social behavior and is implicated in social symptoms of autism. Here we found that a specific amygdala circuit, from the lateral nucleus to the medial nucleus (LA-MeA), is required for using social cues to learn about environmental cues that signal imminent threats. Disruption of the LA-MeA circuit impaired valuation of these environmental cues and subsequent ability to use a cue to guide behavior. Rats with impaired social guidance of behavior due to knockout of Nrxn1, an analog of autism-associated gene NRXN, exhibited marked LA-MeA deficits. Chemogenetic activation of this circuit reversed these impaired social behaviors. These findings identify an amygdala circuit required to guide emotional responses to socially significant cues and identify an exploratory target for disorders associated with social impairments."
https://openalex.org/W2571875265,"The blood-brain barrier (BBB) prevents the entry of many drugs into the brain and, thus, is a major obstacle in the treatment of CNS diseases. There is some evidence that the LDL receptor (LDLR) is expressed at the BBB and may participate in the transport of endogenous ligands from blood to brain, a process referred to as receptor-mediated transcytosis. We previously described a family of peptide vectors that were developed to target the LDLR. In the present study, in vitro BBB models that were derived from wild-type and LDLR-knockout animals (ldlr-/- ) were used to validate the specific LDLR-dependent transcytosis of LDL via a nondegradative route. We next showed that LDLR-targeting peptide vectors, whether in fusion or chemically conjugated to an Ab Fc fragment, promote binding to apical LDLR and transendothelial transfer of the Fc fragment across BBB monolayers via the same route as LDL. Finally, we demonstrated in vivo that LDLR significantly contributes to the brain uptake of vectorized Fc. We thus provide further evidence that LDLR is a relevant receptor for CNS drug delivery via receptor-mediated transcytosis and that the peptide vectors we developed have the potential to transport drugs, including proteins or Ab based, across the BBB.-Molino, Y., David, M., Varini, K., Jabès, F., Gaudin, N., Fortoul, A., Bakloul, K., Masse, M., Bernard, A., Drobecq, L., Lécorché, P., Temsamani, J., Jacquot, G., Khrestchatisky, M.

https://openalex.org/W2581349936,"Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) is one of the most common gynecological cancers, with diagnosis often at a late stage. Metastasis is a major cause of death in patients with EOC, but the underlying molecular mechanisms remain obscure. Here, we utilized an integrated approach to find potential key transcription factors involved in ovarian cancer metastasis and identified STAT4 as a critical player in ovarian cancer metastasis. We found that activated STAT4 was overexpressed in epithelial cells of ovarian cancer and STAT4 overexpression was associated with poor outcome of ovarian cancer patients, which promoted metastasis of ovarian cancer in both in vivo and in vitro. Although STAT4 mediated EOC metastasis via inducing epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of ovarian cancer cells in vivo, STAT4 failed to induce EMT directly in vitro, suggesting that STAT4 might mediate EMT process via cancer–stroma interactions. Further functional analysis revealed that STAT4 overexpression induced normal omental fibroblasts and adipose- and bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells to obtain cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAF)-like features via induction of tumor-derived Wnt7a. Reciprocally, increased production of CAF-induced CXCL12, IL6 and VEGFA within tumor microenvironment could enable peritoneal metastasis of ovarian cancer via induction of EMT program. In summary, our study established a model that STAT4 promotes ovarian cancer metastasis via tumor-derived Wnt7a-induced activation of CAFs."
https://openalex.org/W2577099526,"Microglia are the intrinsic immune sentinels of the central nervous system. Their activation restricts tissue injury and pathogen spread, but in some settings, including viral infection, this response can contribute to cell death and disease. Identifying mechanisms that control microglial responses is therefore an important objective. Using replication-incompetent adenovirus 5 (Ad5)-based vectors as a model, we investigated the mechanisms through which microglia recognize and respond to viral uptake. Transgenic, immunohistochemical, molecular-genetic, and fluorescence imaging approaches revealed that phosphatidylserine (PtdSer) exposure on the outer leaflet of transduced cells triggers their engulfment by microglia through TAM receptor-dependent mechanisms. We show that inhibition of phospholipid scramblase 1 (PLSCR1) activity reduces intracellular calcium dysregulation, prevents PtdSer externalization, and enables months-long protection of vector-transduced, transgene-expressing cells from microglial phagocytosis. Our study identifies PLSCR1 as a potent target through which the innate immune response to viral vectors, and potentially other stimuli, may be controlled."
https://openalex.org/W2580620104,"Isozyme-specific post-translational regulation fine tunes signaling events. However, redundancy in sequence or activity renders links between isozyme-specific modifications and downstream functions uncertain. Methods to study this phenomenon are underdeveloped. Here we use a redox-targeting screen to reveal that Akt3 is a first-responding isozyme sensing native electrophilic lipids. Electrophile modification of Akt3 modulated downstream pathway responses in cells and Danio rerio (zebrafish) and markedly differed from Akt2-specific oxidative regulation. Digest MS sequencing identified Akt3 C119 as the privileged cysteine that senses 4-hydroxynonenal. A C119S Akt3 mutant was hypomorphic for all downstream phenotypes shown by wild-type Akt3. This study documents isozyme-specific and chemical redox signal-personalized physiological responses."
https://openalex.org/W2581410353,"The recruitment of vascular endothelial cells from the tumor microenvironment (TME) to promote angiogenesis plays key roles in the progression of renal cell carcinoma (RCC). The potential impact of immune cells in the TME on RCC angiogenesis, however, remains unclear. Here, we found that recruitment of mast cells resulted in increased RCC angiogenesis in both in vitro cell lines and in vivo mouse models. Mechanistic analyses revealed that RCC recruited mast cells by modulating PI3K→︀AKT→︀GSK3β→︀AM signaling. A clinical survey of human RCC samples also showed that higher expression of the PI3K→︀AKT→︀GSK3β→︀AM signaling pathway correlated with increased angiogenesis. Interruption of PI3K→︀AKT→︀GSK3β→︀AM signaling via specific inhibitors led to decreased recruitment of mast cells, and targeting this infiltrating mast cell-related signaling via an AKT-specific inhibitor suppressed RCC angiogenesis in xenograft mouse models. Together, these results identified a novel role of infiltrating mast cells in RCC angiogenesis and metastasis and suggest a new strategy for treating RCC by targeting this newly identified signaling pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2580466919,"Epoxides are highly useful synthons and biosynthons for the construction of complex natural products during total synthesis and biosynthesis, respectively. Among enzyme-catalyzed epoxide transformations, a reaction that is notably missing, in regard to the synthetic toolbox, is cationic rearrangement that takes place under strong acid. This is a challenging transformation for enzyme catalysis, as stabilization of the carbocation intermediate upon epoxide cleavage is required. Here, we discovered two Brønsted acid enzymes that can catalyze two unprecedented epoxide transformations in biology. PenF from the penigequinolone pathway catalyzes a cationic epoxide rearrangement under physiological conditions to generate a quaternary carbon center, while AsqO from the aspoquinolone pathway catalyzes a 3-exo-tet cyclization to forge a cyclopropane-tetrahydrofuran ring system. The discovery of these new epoxide-modifying enzymes further highlights the versatility of epoxides in complexity generation during natural product biosynthesis."
https://openalex.org/W2580877189,"Tumor suppressor genes and the immune system are critical players in inhibiting cancer initiation and/or progression. However, little is known about whether a tumor suppressor gene can function through both immune-dependent and -independent mechanisms. Retinoic acid receptor responder 2 (RARRES2) is transcriptionally downregulated in multiple cancer types. Previous studies suggested that it can serve as an immune-dependent tumor suppressor by acting as a chemoattractant to recruit anticancer immune cells expressing its receptor, the chemerin chemokine receptor 1 (CMKLR1), to sites of tumor. In this study, we investigated the role of RARRES2 in adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC), a rare lethal malignancy in which aberrant Wnt/β-catenin signaling is frequently detected. We show that RARRES2 expression is downregulated in ACC as compared with normal and benign adrenocortical tissues, which is a result of CpG hypermethylation. Despite minimal CMKLR1 expression and lack of phenotypic tumor-suppressive effect with exogenous RARRES2 treatment, RARRES2 overexpression in ACC cell lines not only reduced cell proliferation, cell invasion and tumorigenicity in vitro, but also inhibited tumor growth in vivo in two immunodeficient mouse xenograft models. Mechanistically, RARRES2 overexpression in ACC cells inhibited Wnt/β-catenin pathway activity by promoting β-catenin phosphorylation and degradation, it also inhibited the phosphorylation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase. Thus our study identifies RARRES2 as a novel tumor suppressor for ACC, which can function through an immune-independent mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W2580883480,"The hypoxia-regulated tumor-suppressor von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) is an E3 ligase that recognizes its substrates as part of an oxygen-dependent prolyl hydroxylase (PHD) reaction, with hypoxia-inducible factor α (HIFα) being its most notable substrate. Here we report that VHL has an equally important function distinct from its hypoxia-regulated activity. We find that Aurora kinase A (AURKA) is a novel, hypoxia-independent target for VHL ubiquitination. In contrast to its hypoxia-regulated activity, VHL mono-, rather than poly-ubiquitinates AURKA, in a PHD-independent reaction targeting AURKA for degradation in quiescent cells, where degradation of AURKA is required to maintain the primary cilium. Tumor-associated variants of VHL differentiate between these two functions, as a pathogenic VHL mutant that retains intrinsic ability to ubiquitinate HIFα is unable to ubiquitinate AURKA. Together, these data identify VHL as an E3 ligase with important cellular functions under both normoxic and hypoxic conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2581149693,"Molecular targeting is an import strategy to treat advanced colon cancer. The current study demonstrates that expression of GRM3, a metabotropic glutamate receptor mainly expressed in mammalian central nervous system, is significantly upregulated in majority of human colonic adenocarcinomas tested and colon cancer cell lines. Knockdown of GRM3 expression or inhibition of GRM3 activation in colon cancer cells reduces cell survival and anchorage-independent growth in vitro and inhibits tumor growth in vivo. Mechanistically, GRM3 antagonizes TGFβ-mediated activation of protein kinase A and inhibition of Protein kinase B (AKT). In addition, TGFβ signaling increases GRM3 protein stability and knockdown of GRM3 enhances TGFβ-mediated tumor suppressor function. Further studies indicate that miR-487b-3p directly targets GRM3. Overexpression of miR-487b-3p mimics the effects of GRM3 knockdown and suppresses the tumorigenicity of colon cancer cells in vivo. Expression of miR-487b-3p is decreased in colon adenocarcinomas and inversely correlates with GRM3 expression. Taken together, these studies indicate that upregulation of GRM3 expression is a functionally important molecular event in colon cancer, and that GRM3 is a promising molecular target for colon cancer treatment. This is particularly interesting and important from a therapeutic standpoint because numerous metabotropic glutamate receptor antagonists are available, many of which have been found unsuitable for treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders for reasons such as inability to readily penetrate blood brain barriers. As GRM3 is upregulated in colon cancer, but rarely expressed in normal peripheral tissues, targeting GRM3 with such agents would not likely cause adverse neurological or peripheral side effects, making GRM3 an attractive and specific molecular target for colon cancer treatment."

https://openalex.org/W2582457248,"Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is characterized by the accumulation of B cells in the hematopoietic system and lymphoid tissues. Although inhibitors targeting the B-cell receptor (BCR) pathway have been successful in the treatment of the disease, the underlying mechanisms leading to BCR over-activity in CLL are not fully understood. In this study, we found that HSP90, a highly conserved molecular chaperone, is overexpressed in CLL compared with resting B cells. HSP90 overexpression is accompanied by the overexpression of several BCR kinases including LYN, spleen tyrosine kinase, Bruton tyrosine kinase and AKT. Chemical and immune-precipitation demonstrated that these BCR constituents are present in a multi-client chaperone complex with HSP90. Inhibition of HSP90 with PU-H71 destabilized the BCR kinases and caused apoptosis of CLL cells through the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. Further, PU-H71 induced apoptosis in the presence of stromal co-culture or cytoprotective survival signals. Finally, genetic knockdown of HSP90 and its client AKT, but not BTK, reduced CLL viability. Overall, our study suggests that the chaperone function of HSP90 contributes to the over-activity of the BCR signaling in CLL and inhibition of HSP90 has the potential to achieve a multi-targeting effect. Thus, HSP90 inhibition may be explored to prevent or overcome drug resistance to single targeting agents."
https://openalex.org/W2579497510,"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the third leading cause of death worldwide; smoking is the main risk factor for COPD, but genetic factors are also relevant contributors. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of the lung function measures used in the diagnosis of COPD have identified a number of loci, however association signals are often broad and collectively these loci only explain a small proportion of the heritability. In order to examine the association with COPD risk of genetic variants down to low allele frequencies, to aid fine-mapping of association signals and to explain more of the missing heritability, we undertook a targeted sequencing study in 300 COPD cases and 300 smoking controls for 26 loci previously reported to be associated with lung function. We used a pooled sequencing approach, with 12 pools of 25 individuals each, enabling high depth (30x) coverage per sample to be achieved. This pooled design maximised sample size and therefore power, but led to challenges during variant-calling since sequencing error rates and minor allele frequencies for rare variants can be very similar. For this reason we employed a rigorous quality control pipeline for variant detection which included the use of 3 independent calling algorithms. In order to avoid false positive associations we also developed tests to detect variants with potential batch effects and removed them before undertaking association testing. We tested for the effects of single variants and the combined effect of rare variants within a locus. We followed up the top signals with data available (only 67% of collapsing methods signals) in 4,249 COPD cases and 11,916 smoking controls from UK Biobank. We provide suggestive evidence for the combined effect of rare variants on COPD risk in TNXB and in sliding windows within MECOM and upstream of HHIP. These findings can lead to an improved understanding of the molecular pathways involved in the development of COPD."
