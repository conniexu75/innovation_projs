https://openalex.org/W1990253071,"Vessel sprouting by migrating tip and proliferating stalk endothelial cells (ECs) is controlled by genetic signals (such as Notch), but it is unknown whether metabolism also regulates this process. Here, we show that ECs relied on glycolysis rather than on oxidative phosphorylation for ATP production and that loss of the glycolytic activator PFKFB3 in ECs impaired vessel formation. Mechanistically, PFKFB3 not only regulated EC proliferation but also controlled the formation of filopodia/lamellipodia and directional migration, in part by compartmentalizing with F-actin in motile protrusions. Mosaic in vitro and in vivo sprouting assays further revealed that PFKFB3 overexpression overruled the pro-stalk activity of Notch, whereas PFKFB3 deficiency impaired tip cell formation upon Notch blockade, implying that glycolysis regulates vessel branching."
https://openalex.org/W2155465642,"Short-duration γ-ray bursts are intense flashes of cosmic γ-rays, lasting less than about two seconds, whose origin is unclear. The favoured hypothesis is that they are produced by a relativistic jet created by the merger of two compact stellar objects (specifically two neutron stars or a neutron star and a black hole). This is supported by indirect evidence such as the properties of their host galaxies, but unambiguous confirmation of the model is still lacking. Mergers of this kind are also expected to create significant quantities of neutron-rich radioactive species, whose decay should result in a faint transient, known as a 'kilonova', in the days following the burst. Indeed, it is speculated that this mechanism may be the predominant source of stable r-process elements in the Universe. Recent calculations suggest that much of the kilonova energy should appear in the near-infrared spectral range, because of the high optical opacity created by these heavy r-process elements. Here we report optical and near-infrared observations that provide strong evidence for such an event accompanying the short-duration γ-ray burst GRB 130603B. If this, the simplest interpretation of the data, is correct, then it confirms that compact-object mergers are the progenitors of short-duration γ-ray bursts and the sites of significant production of r-process elements. It also suggests that kilonovae offer an alternative, unbeamed electromagnetic signature of the most promising sources for direct detection of gravitational waves."

Furthermore, during normal brain development, genes are expressed in patterns specific to developmental stage and neuroanatomical structure. We identified de novo mutations in persons with schizophrenia and then mapped the responsible genes onto transcriptome profiles of normal human brain tissues from age 13 weeks gestation to adulthood. In the dorsolateral and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex during fetal development, genes harboring damaging de novo mutations in schizophrenia formed a network significantly enriched for transcriptional coexpression and protein interaction. The 50 genes in the network function in neuronal migration, synaptic transmission, signaling, transcriptional regulation, and transport. These results suggest that disruptions of fetal prefrontal cortical neurogenesis are critical to the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. These results also support the feasibility of integrating genomic and transcriptome analyses to map critical neurodevelopmental processes in time and space in the brain."

We show that human hSTING(H232) adopts a ""closed"" conformation upon binding c[G(2',5')pA(3',5')p] and its linkage isomer c[G(2',5')pA(2',5')p], as does mouse mSting(R231) on binding c[G(2',5')pA(3',5')p], c[G(3',5')pA(3',5')p] and the antiviral agent DMXAA, leading to similar ""closed"" conformations. Comparing hSTING to mSting, 2',5'-linkage-containing cGAMP isomers were more specific triggers of the IFN pathway compared to the all-3',5'-linkage isomer. Guided by structural information, we identified a unique point mutation (S162A) placed within the cyclic-dinucleotide-binding site of hSTING that rendered it sensitive to the otherwise mouse-specific drug DMXAA, a conclusion validated by binding studies. Our structural and functional analysis highlights the unexpected versatility of STING in the recognition of natural and synthetic ligands within a small-molecule pocket created by the dimerization of STING."

Alternative splicing of RNA affects almost all multiexonic genes to promote genetic diversity (Black, 2000Black D.L.

Of the three modes of RNA splicing that also include exon skipping and alternative splice site usage; intron retention (IR) is the least understood. IR is a form of alternative splicing that occurs when an intron, having been transcribed as part of a pre-mRNA, is not spliced out, thus resulting in an otherwise mature mRNA retaining an unprocessed sequence. Intron-retaining transcripts often contain a premature termination codon (PTC) and are therefore either targeted for degradation by the nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) pathway or their expression is restricted to the nucleus (Lejeune and Maquat, 2005Lejeune F.

As a result, IR has been overlooked as a means of normal gene regulation (Bicknell et al., 2012Bicknell A.A. Cenik C. Chua H.N. Roth F.P. Moore M.J.

Careful dissection of the molecular circuitry controlling myelopoiesis has served as a paradigm for cellular differentiation. Lineage commitment toward granulopoiesis begins with the hemopoietic stem cell losing its ability to self-renew, and the stepwise acquisition of specific myeloid identity (Rosenbauer and Tenen, 2007Rosenbauer F. Tenen D.G. Transcription factors in myeloid development: balancing differentiation with transformation.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2007; 7: 105-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). The terminal phases of myeloid development are marked by distinct transcriptional and translational changes, including changes in the expression of cell surface markers (Novershtern et al., 2011Novershtern N. Subramanian A. Lawton L.N. Mak R.H. Haining W.N. McConkey M.E. Habib N. Yosef N. Chang C.Y.

Touw I.P. Friedman A.D. Regulation of granulopoiesis by transcription factors and cytokine signals.Leukemia. 2000; 14: 973-990Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). These are accompanied by unique changes in the shape and size of the cell, including dramatic changes leading to a multilobular nucleus in the final stage of granulopoiesis (Lee et al., 1999Lee G. Foerster J. Lukens J. Paraskevas F. Greer J. Rogers G. Wintrobe’s Clinical Hematology.10 edn. William and Wilkins, Baltimore1999Google Scholar). Although this unique morphological change has been extensively studied, its mechanisms remain unknown. Although removal of PTC containing transcripts by NMD is essential for the normal development of hemopoetic stem and progenitor cells (Weischenfeldt et al., 2008Weischenfeldt J. Damgaard I. Bryder D. Theilgaard-Mönch K. Thoren L.A. Nielsen F.C. Jacobsen S.E.W. Nerlov C. Porse B.T. NMD is essential for hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells and for eliminating by-products of programmed DNA rearrangements.Genes Dev. 2008; 22: 1381-1396Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), the extent of IR coupled with NMD has not been explored. To investigate the impact of alternative splicing, and specifically IR in granulopoiesis, we performed massively parallel mRNA sequencing (mRNA-seq) and mass spectrometry on pure populations of promyelocytes, myelocytes, and mature granulocytes isolated from murine bone marrow. Because loss of mRNA following NMD and the abundance of low complexity regions in introns make it difficult to quantify IR, we developed an algorithm, IRFinder, which detects changes in levels of IR between two samples from mRNA-seq data. Bioinformatic analysis of our data revealed a unique pattern of alternative IR accumulation in genes involved in granulocyte function and nuclear morphology (including Lmnb1), leading to decreased protein levels in granulocytes. Inhibition of NMD using caffeine treatment or knockdown of the core NMD factor, Upf1, resulted in the accumulation of intron-retaining transcripts, indicating that IR triggered NMD. Re-expression of Lmnb1, which expressed one of the highest levels of IR in mouse bone marrow, significantly altered granulocyte nuclear shape, size, and peripheral granulocyte numbers, suggesting that programmed IR is a critical regulatory pathway in normal granulocyte development. To study IR in sequential stages of granulopoiesis, we performed mRNA sequencing (mRNA-seq) and mass spectrometry on primary mouse promyelocytes, myelocytes, and granulocytes purified using fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) (Figures 1A and S1A available online). Bioinformatic analysis (see Experimental Procedures) of the mRNA-seq data from polyA-enriched RNA showed 2,432 differentially regulated genes (Table S1), of which 563 were transcribed into 948 alternatively spliced isoforms with significant changes in expression between promyelocytes and granulocytes (p < 0.05, Audic and Claverie Test (Audic and Claverie, 1997Audic S. Claverie J.M. The significance of digital gene expression profiles.Genome Res. 1997; 7: 986-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (2390) Google Scholar) (Table S2). We created an algorithm called IRFinder (Figure 1B) to discover retained introns and highlight differentially retained introns between paired samples. We found 121 introns transcribed from 86 genes (Table S3) that were retained at significantly different levels between promyelocytes and granulocytes (p < 0.05, Audic and Claverie Test (Audic and Claverie, 1997Audic S. Claverie J.M. The significance of digital gene expression profiles.Genome Res. 1997; 7: 986-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (2390) Google Scholar). Of these 86 genes, 30 displayed alternative IR in multiple introns. In order to validate our mRNA-seq data, we used quantitative reverse transcription PCR (RT-qPCR) with primers specific to both introns and correctly spliced exons for 20 of these intron-retaining transcripts detected by IRFinder. By measuring the ratio of intronic expression normalized to exonic expression, we directly confirmed IR in 80% (16/20) of these transcripts (Figures 1C and S1B). mRNA-seq performed on human granulocytes identified IR in the same genes shown in Figure 1C (see Intron Retention Is Conserved between Human and Mouse) for human data). These intron-retaining transcripts were polyadenylated and highly enriched in the cytoplasm (Figure 2), confirming that they are fully processed and exported mRNAs rather than splicing intermediates. 83/86 (97%) intron-retaining mRNAs contained at least one PTC (Table S3), making them putative candidates for degradation via the NMD pathway (Belgrader et al., 1994Belgrader P.

Two-tailed Mann Whitney U-test was used to determine significance, denoted by ∗ (p < 0.05), ∗∗ (p < 0.001). Heatmaps of expression levels for the 121 retained introns and 948 alternatively spliced isoforms in mouse promyelocytes, myelocytes, and granulocytes revealed striking differences between alternative splicing and IR (Figure 3A). Non-IR alternative splice isoforms displayed dynamic changes in expression, with some isoforms being highly expressed in only the middle stage of differentiation, predominantly in the first and last stages or in gradients. In contrast, IR predominantly accumulated during differentiation, with low levels in promyelocytes, increasing through myelocytes to the highest levels in granulocytes. Distinct patterns of isoform versus intron-retaining transcript expression suggested that they are differentially regulated. We also noticed that groups of introns from the same transcript were either concomitantly spliced out or retained (Figures 1C and S1B). This sets IR apart from other types of splicing in which different exons of the same transcript may be included or excluded independently. We next determined whether alternatively expressed genes were enriched for specific Gene Ontology categories (Figures 3B and S2). As expected, functions specific to granulocytes were significantly represented (Figure 3B). Notably, IR, but not total gene expression or alternative splicing, was significantly associated with the nuclear periphery and nuclear lamina (Figure 3B). This suggests that IR may regulate remodeling of the nuclear envelope and shape, which are unique characteristics of granulocytic differentiation. To determine the proportion of intron-retaining transcripts versus correctly spliced transcripts, we calculated the median number of reads that mapped to retained introns against those that mapped to all known transcripts for each IR gene correcting for length and total mappable reads in each sample (Figure 3C). We found that over 25% of all transcripts from 24 genes retained introns. To determine whether changes in the splicing machinery may be a mechanism responsible for IR, we analyzed the mRNA expression and protein levels of small nuclear ribonuclear protein genes belonging to each of the major spliceosomal complexes (Kanehisa et al., 2012Kanehisa M. Goto S. Sato Y. Furumichi M. Tanabe M. KEGG for integration and interpretation of large-scale molecular data sets.Nucleic Acids Res. 2012; 40: D109-D114Crossref PubMed Scopus (3371) Google Scholar). The majority of the U1 and U2 subunits were downregulated (up to 125-fold) during granulopoiesis (Figure 3D), whereas the other subunits were mostly stable (Figure 3E). Protein levels of Sf3b1, for example, which has been recently shown to be essential for intron definition (Shao et al., 2012Shao W. Kim H.-S. Cao Y. Xu Y.-Z. Query C.C. A U1-U2 snRNP interaction network during intron definition.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2012; 32: 470-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), decreased 7-fold. This indicated that IR may arise from the downregulation of spliceosomal components that are responsible for the recognition of intron and exon boundaries, especially at the branch point and the 5′ extremity of the intron, but not the subsequent stages of lariat formation and cleavage. A recent report identified differential GC content between introns and exons as essential for spliceosomal recognition (Amit et al., 2012Amit M. Donyo M. Hollander D. Goren A. Kim E. Gelfman S. Lev-Maor G. Burstein D. Schwartz S. Postolsky B. et al.Differential GC content between exons and introns establishes distinct strategies of splice-site recognition.Cell Rep. 2012; 1: 543-556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Introns with high relative GC content use a mode of splicing that involves intron definition rather than exon definition. In this “intron definition” mode of splicing, changes in splicing efficiency are more likely to result in a retained intron rather than skipped exons. We calculated intronic and flanking exonic GC content for IR genes and for all other genes expressed during granulopoiesis (Figure 3F). We found significantly higher GC content in retained introns compared to spliced introns in both mouse and human mRNA-seq data (Figure 3F, see Intron Retention Is Conserved between Human and Mouse for human data). This finding leads us to believe that IR genes operate through a model of intronic recognition, making them more susceptible to IR than other genes. To determine the consequences of IR, we first investigated whether intron-retaining transcripts can escape NMD and undergo translation. Incorrect recognition of translation termination, which allows translational stop codon readthrough or translation reinitiation has been shown to bypass NMD (Neu-Yilik et al., 2011Neu-Yilik G. Amthor B. Gehring N.H. Bahri S. Paidassi H. Hentze M.W. Kulozik A.E. Mechanism of escape from nonsense-mediated mRNA decay of human β-globin transcripts with nonsense mutations in the first exon.RNA. 2011; 17: 843-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, Zhang and Maquat, 1997Zhang J. Maquat L.E. Evidence that translation reinitiation abrogates nonsense-mediated mRNA decay in mammalian cells.EMBO J. 1997; 16: 826-833Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). We investigated the presence of these mechanisms of NMD escape by attempting to map our mass spectrometry data from the same cell extracts to intronic sequences and to the 3′UTR of intron-retaining genes. We found that 6,031 mass spectra mapped to the coding region of genes with IR but no spectra mapped to introns or 3′UTRs of these genes, suggesting that proteins are not produced when IR occurs (Table S4). Thus, intron-retaining transcripts do not escape NMD, either via translation reinitiation or stop codon readthrough. To assess whether small noncoding RNAs, such as microRNAs, were being expressed from retained introns, we performed small RNA-seq on primary mouse promyelocyte, myelocyte, and granulocyte samples. We found no known microRNA or hairpin-like small RNA expressed from within retained introns (Table S5), ruling out the possibility that their expression determines granulocytic differentiation. To directly test whether IR triggers NMD, the NMD pathway was inhibited using caffeine in combination with actinomycin D (Ivanov et al., 2007Ivanov I. Lo K.C. Hawthorn L. Cowell J.K. Ionov Y. Identifying candidate colon cancer tumor suppressor genes using inhibition of nonsense-mediated mRNA decay in colon cancer cells.Oncogene. 2007; 26: 2873-2884Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) and accumulation of intron-retaining transcripts was measured by whole-genome expression analysis. Treatment of cells with caffeine leads to downregulation of SMG1, a member of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-related protein kinase family (Yamashita et al., 2001Yamashita A. Ohnishi T. Kashima I. Taya Y. Ohno S. Human SMG-1, a novel phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-related protein kinase, associates with components of the mRNA surveillance complex and is involved in the regulation of nonsense-mediated mRNA decay.Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2215-2228Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar) known to inhibit the phosphorylation of the core NMD factor, UPF1, thereby blocking the NMD pathway. Of the 86 genes that exhibited differential IR, 75 had higher levels of IR in granulocytes; 39 of 86 showed significantly increased expression levels after caffeine treatment (p < 0.05, RUV procedure described in Experimental Procedures with Holm-Bonferroni correction). Although caffeine treatment is known to have pleiotropic effects including upregulation of alternatively spliced isoforms (Shi et al., 2008Shi J. Hu Z. Pabon K. Scotto K.W. Caffeine regulates alternative splicing in a subset of cancer-associated genes: a role for SC35.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2008; 28: 883-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) in addition to NMD blockade (Ivanov et al., 2007Ivanov I. Lo K.C. Hawthorn L. Cowell J.K. Ionov Y. Identifying candidate colon cancer tumor suppressor genes using inhibition of nonsense-mediated mRNA decay in colon cancer cells.Oncogene. 2007; 26: 2873-2884Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), the identification of the 39 intron-retaining genes represented a significant enrichment (p < 0.05, Fisher’s exact test). Because IR leading to NMD would result in decreased mRNA, and therefore decreased protein levels, we examined our mass spectrometry data to determine protein expression. Mass spectrometry data were available for 21 out of these 39 IR genes, with 18/21 showing reduced protein levels when IR was highest (p = 0.0015, binomial test), further suggesting that IR leads to NMD and consequently reduced gene expression during granulopoiesis (Table S6). To assess whether IR is also an important regulatory mechanism conserved in human granulopoiesis, we performed mRNA-seq on human granulocytes and measured the extent of IR. Using IRFinder, we found 855 genes expressed in human granulocytes in which at least one intron was retained (Table S7). Of the 86 genes that exhibited differential IR during murine granulopoiesis, 71 were expressed in human granulocytes, and 36 of these showed IR. This significant overlap (p = 2.85 × 10−22, hypergeometric test) between human and mouse genes demonstrated that IR was conserved. To investigate whether conservation of IR was due to sequence homology between human and mouse genes, we measured the levels of intron retention of “orthologous introns” among the 36 genes with conserved IR. Despite our demonstration that this is a conserved process within genes, there was no correlation in the levels of IR for orthologous introns in each gene. To confirm the biological function of IR during granulopoiesis, we selected Lmnb1, a key nuclear protein, for further analysis. Lmnb1 was among three genes (Lmnb1, Lmnb2, and Lbr) linked to nuclear structure in granulocytes and showed one of the highest levels of differential IR using mRNA-seq (Figures 1C and 3C), as well as downregulation of protein levels measured by mass spectrometry (Table S6). Our mRNA-seq data revealed high levels of IR across multiple introns of the Lmnb1 gene in mature murine granulocytes, whereas much less intron retention was detected in promyelocytes or myelocytes (Figure 1C). Using RT-qPCR (Figure 4A), over 100-fold greater retention of introns five to ten was detected in mature granulocytes compared to promyelocytes. Introns one to four were not differentially retained in any of the three stages of granulopoiesis (Figure 4A), confirming the specificity of this mechanism. Higher levels of IR correlated with the downregulation of correctly spliced mRNA transcripts by up to 100-fold (Figure 4A) and low levels of protein expression (Figures 4B and 4C) of Lmnb1 in myelocytes and granulocytes. Immunofluorescence demonstrated the loss of Lmnb1 expression at the nuclear membrane (Figure 4C). Consistent with data from primary cells, we demonstrated accumulation of Lmnb1 introns during all-trans retinoic acid-induced differentiation of the MPRO cell line into granulocytes, and this change also correlated with a decrease in spliced mRNA expression (Figure 4D). These results suggest that the function of IR is to reduce Lmnb1 expression in maturing granulocytes. To determine whether Lmnb1 transcripts with retained introns were degraded by NMD, this pathway was inhibited using caffeine coupled with actinomycin D (Ivanov et al., 2007Ivanov I. Lo K.C. Hawthorn L. Cowell J.K. Ionov Y. Identifying candidate colon cancer tumor suppressor genes using inhibition of nonsense-mediated mRNA decay in colon cancer cells.Oncogene. 2007; 26: 2873-2884Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), and accumulation of intron-retaining transcripts was measured by RT-qPCR (Figure 5A). A significant accumulation of Lmnb1 mRNA with retained introns was found in primary promyelocytes, myelocytes, and granulocytes treated with caffeine, with the highest level observed in granulocytes (Figure 5B). Accumulation of intron-retaining Lmnb1 transcripts was also observed in differentiated MPRO cells (Figure 5C). For both primary myeloid and MPRO cells, there was a significant increase in the level of retained introns 7 and 8 after caffeine treatment during differentiation, compared to the level of native IR (Figures 4A and 4D) in each sample (Prom:Myel p < 0.0003; Myel:Gran, p < 0.0475; Control:ATRA, p < 0.0001). Due to the possible pleiotropic effects of caffeine, we also performed siRNA knockdown of Upf1 in primary granulocytes (Figure 5D), which resulted in a significant accumulation of intron-retaining Lmnb1 mRNA and other intron-retaining transcripts shown in Figure 1C (Figure 5E), thus confirming the results of caffeine treatment. Importantly, expression of correctly spliced mRNA transcripts was not elevated following inhibition of NMD using either approach (Figures 5B, 5C, and 5E). These data suggest that IR-coupled NMD is a specific mechanism involved in the degradation of mRNA transcripts including Lmnb1 that failed to splice out introns in maturing granulocytes. To examine the contribution of transcriptional regulation in the control of IR gene expression, we determined the levels of nascent transcripts for 36 intron-retaining genes and known transcriptionally regulated controls during granulopoiesis (Guibal et al., 2009Guibal F.C.

Pathologic gene transactivation in HF is associated with recruitment of histone acetyl-transferases and local chromatin hyperacetylation. We therefore assessed the role of acetyl-lysine reader proteins, or bromodomains, in HF. Using a chemical genetic approach, we establish a central role for BET family bromodomain proteins in gene control during HF pathogenesis. BET inhibition potently suppresses cardiomyocyte hypertrophy in vitro and pathologic cardiac remodeling in vivo. Integrative transcriptional and epigenomic analyses reveal that BET proteins function mechanistically as pause-release factors critical to expression of genes that are central to HF pathogenesis and relevant to the pathobiology of failing human hearts. This study implicates epigenetic readers as essential effectors of transcriptional pause release during HF pathogenesis and identifies BET coactivator proteins as therapeutic targets in the heart."

In the present study, we identified a specific Skp2 inhibitor using high-throughput in silico screening of large and diverse chemical libraries. This Skp2 inhibitor selectively suppresses Skp2 E3 ligase activity, but not activity of other SCF complexes. It also phenocopies the effects observed upon genetic Skp2 deficiency, such as suppressing survival and Akt-mediated glycolysis and triggering p53-independent cellular senescence. Strikingly, we discovered a critical function of Skp2 in positively regulating cancer stem cell populations and self-renewal ability through genetic and pharmacological approaches. Notably, Skp2 inhibitor exhibits potent antitumor activities in multiple animal models and cooperates with chemotherapeutic agents to reduce cancer cell survival. Our study thus provides pharmacological evidence that Skp2 is a promising target for restricting cancer stem cell and cancer progression."

By integrating genome-wide mRNA expression responsiveness to DAF-16 with genome-wide in vivo binding data for a compendium of transcription factors, we discovered that PQM-1 is the elusive transcriptional activator that directly controls development (class II) genes by binding to the DAF-16-associated element (DAE). DAF-16 directly regulates class I genes only, through the DAF-16-binding element (DBE). Loss of PQM-1 suppresses daf-2 longevity and further slows development. Surprisingly, the nuclear localization of PQM-1 and DAF-16 is controlled by IIS in opposite ways and was also found to be mutually antagonistic. We observe progressive loss of nuclear PQM-1 with age, explaining declining expression of PQM-1 targets.

We have combined X-ray crystallography, cryo-EM, molecular dynamics and computational modeling to determine the structures of aerolysin mutants in their monomeric and heptameric forms, trapped at various stages of the pore formation process. A dynamic modeling approach based on swarm intelligence was applied, whereby the intrinsic flexibility of aerolysin extracted from new X-ray structures was used to fully exploit the cryo-EM spatial restraints. Using this integrated strategy, we obtained a radically new arrangement of the prepore conformation and a near-atomistic structure of the aerolysin pore, which is fully consistent with all of the biochemical data available so far. Upon transition from the prepore to pore, the aerolysin heptamer shows a unique concerted swirling movement, accompanied by a vertical collapse of the complex, ultimately leading to the insertion of a transmembrane β-barrel."

A particularly reactive intermediate formed during glycolysis, 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate, could nonenzymatically modify specific lysines in proteins, providing a means by which accumulation of metabolic intermediates could provide regulatory feedback to balance or control flux through various pathways. Proteomic analysis showed that the 3-phosphoglyceryl-lysine formed when certain lysine residues interacted with 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate produced naturally in cells and was particularly common in proteins that function in glycolysis.

This indicates that reward and aversiveness are represented independently as two dimensions, even by neurons that are closely related to motor function.

Although individual mutations in bound sequence motifs can influence TF binding, most binding differences occur in the absence of nearby sequence variations. Instead, combinatorial binding was found to be significant for genetic and evolutionary stability; cobound TFs tend to disappear in concert and were sensitive to genetic knockout of partner TFs.

Our work reveals a mechanism for regulating DNA replication under adverse growth conditions. Additionally, our data indicate that unfolded proteins can actively and directly alter substrate recognition by cellular proteases. Whether and when to initiate DNA replication are important decisions facing nearly all cells. In particular, cells must be able to control the onset of DNA replication in response to changing environmental conditions. Under favorable conditions, cells often strive to grow and proliferate and hence will promote DNA replication initiation. Conversely, in stressful conditions, cells must prevent the initiation of replication and instead shift their priorities to cytoprotective functions. The molecular mechanisms used to transduce information about prevailing environmental conditions to the replication machinery remain incompletely understood, particularly in bacteria. In all organisms, replication initiation depends on the formation of highly organized nucleoprotein complexes at chromosomal origins (Kawakami and Katayama, 2010Kawakami H. Katayama T. DnaA, ORC, and Cdc6: similarity beyond the domains of life and diversity.Biochem. Cell Biol. 2010; 88: 49-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In eukaryotes, the multisubunit origin recognition complex (ORC) binds to origins and drives assembly of preinitiation replication complexes (Bell, 2002Bell S.P. The origin recognition complex: from simple origins to complex functions.Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 659-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). In bacteria, DNA replication requires the AAA+ ATPase DnaA (Leonard and Grimwade, 2011Leonard A.C. Grimwade J.E. Regulation of DnaA assembly and activity: taking directions from the genome.Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2011; 65: 19-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). When bound to ATP, DnaA forms an oligomeric structure along the origin, unwinds the DNA duplex, and recruits other components of the replication machinery, thereby initiating DNA replication. Given its central role, DnaA represents a major target for regulatory mechanisms that dictate the timing of DNA replication. Although major progress has been made in elucidating the mechanisms controlling DnaA during exponential growth (Ishida et al., 2004Ishida T. Akimitsu N. Kashioka T. Hatano M. Kubota T. Ogata Y.

Microbiol. 2007; 65: 979-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), it remains largely unexplored how DnaA and cell-cycle progression are regulated in response to nutrient limitation or stressful environmental conditions. The α-proteobacterium Caulobacter crescentus is a model for dissecting the regulation of the bacterial cell cycle. Caulobacter cells divide asymmetrically, producing daughter cells that differ with respect to morphology and replicative fate (Tsokos and Laub, 2012Tsokos C.G. Laub M.T. Polarity and cell fate asymmetry in Caulobacter crescentus.Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2012; 15: 744-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The daughter stalked cell immediately enters S phase after cell division, whereas the daughter swarmer cell enters a G1 phase and cannot initiate DNA replication until after differentiating into a stalked cell. Caulobacter cells initiate replication once, and only once, per cell cycle (Marczynski, 1999Marczynski G.T. Chromosome methylation and measurement of faithful, once and only once per cell cycle chromosome replication in Caulobacter crescentus.J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 1984-1993PubMed Google Scholar). As in most bacteria, DNA replication in Caulobacter requires DnaA (Gorbatyuk and Marczynski, 2001Gorbatyuk B. Marczynski G.T. Physiological consequences of blocked Caulobacter crescentus dnaA expression, an essential DNA replication gene.Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 40: 485-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), and the availability of active DnaA dictates the timing of replication initiation (Jonas et al., 2011Jonas K. Chen Y.E.

Biol. 2011; 21: 1092-1101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In rich media, the abundance of Caulobacter DnaA does not change significantly during the cell cycle (Gorbatyuk and Marczynski, 2005Gorbatyuk B. Marczynski G.T.

Microbiol. 2011; 82: 312-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), indicating that DnaA is controlled mainly at the level of activity in these conditions. Like in E. coli, Caulobacter DnaA can switch between an active, ATP-bound form and an inactive, ADP-bound form (Fernandez-Fernandez et al., 2011Fernandez-Fernandez C. Gonzalez D. Collier J.

The protein HdaA, a homolog of E. coli Hda, stimulates ATP hydrolysis by DnaA in Caulobacter (Collier and Shapiro, 2009Collier J. Shapiro L.

Biol. 2011; 21: 1092-1101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Additional factors regulating DnaA activity likely exist but remain to be identified. Growth of Caulobacter cells in certain stressful conditions, including nutrient starvation and stationary phase, results in a substantial reduction in DnaA levels and a cessation of DNA replication (Gorbatyuk and Marczynski, 2005Gorbatyuk B. Marczynski G.T. Regulated degradation of chromosome replication proteins DnaA and CtrA in Caulobacter crescentus.Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 55: 1233-1245Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, Lesley and Shapiro, 2008Lesley J.A. Shapiro L. SpoT regulates DnaA stability and initiation of DNA replication in carbon-starved Caulobacter crescentus.J. Bacteriol. 2008; 190: 6867-6880Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The decrease in DnaA likely constitutes an important adaptation to stress and starvation by preventing cell-cycle progression when cells need to devote their energy and resources to survival strategies rather than proliferation. The drop in DnaA levels results in part from the proteolysis of DnaA (Gorbatyuk and Marczynski, 2005Gorbatyuk B. Marczynski G.T. Regulated degradation of chromosome replication proteins DnaA and CtrA in Caulobacter crescentus.Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 55: 1233-1245Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, Lesley and Shapiro, 2008Lesley J.A. Shapiro L. SpoT regulates DnaA stability and initiation of DNA replication in carbon-starved Caulobacter crescentus.J. Bacteriol. 2008; 190: 6867-6880Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), but the protease(s) involved and the mechanisms through which stress ultimately triggers proteolysis remain elusive. To better understand how DnaA is regulated in Caulobacter, we isolated mutations that restore the viability of a strain overproducing DnaA; an oversupply of DnaA drives the overinitiation of replication and is lethal (Jonas et al., 2011Jonas K. Chen Y.E. Laub M.T. Modularity of the bacterial cell cycle enables independent spatial and temporal control of DNA replication.Curr. Biol. 2011; 21: 1092-1101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Strikingly, all of the mutations mapped to dnaK, dnaJ, and grpE, which encode for the Hsp70 molecular chaperone system (Genevaux et al., 2007Genevaux P. Georgopoulos C. Kelley W.L. The Hsp70 chaperone machines of Escherichia coli: a paradigm for the repartition of chaperone functions.Mol. Microbiol. 2007; 66: 840-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, Hartl and Hayer-Hartl, 2009Hartl F.U. Hayer-Hartl M. Converging concepts of protein folding in vitro and in vivo.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2009; 16: 574-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (843) Google Scholar). We find that this chaperone is required for DnaA accumulation and the initiation of DNA replication. Cells lacking active DnaK target DnaA for degradation by the protease Lon in two mutually reinforcing ways. (1) Loss of DnaK activity triggers the synthesis of Lon. (2) Unfolded proteins that accumulate following a loss of DnaK activity, and that are themselves degraded by Lon, allosterically activate the protease to degrade DnaA. Collectively, our findings indicate that the Caulobacter cell cycle coordinates DNA replication with the status of intracellular protein folding through the highly conserved Hsp70 chaperone and a AAA+ protease. Our work further suggests that unfolded proteins are not simply passive substrates of Lon but can play an active role in determining substrate recognition following heat shock and other stresses, a phenomenon that may be broadly conserved. Overexpression of Caulobacter dnaA results in the overinitiation of DNA replication and is lethal (Jonas et al., 2011Jonas K. Chen Y.E. Laub M.T. Modularity of the bacterial cell cycle enables independent spatial and temporal control of DNA replication.Curr. Biol. 2011; 21: 1092-1101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that mutations bypassing the lethality of dnaA overexpression would provide insight into the regulation of DnaA and DNA replication. To isolate such mutations, we grew a culture of cells lacking the chromosomal copy of dnaA and carrying a plasmid with M2-dnaA driven by a xylose-inducible promoter (Pxyl). On plates containing xylose, most cells died, as expected; however, prolonged incubation resulted in a few slow-growing colonies, harboring putative suppressor mutations. Because the chromosomal copy of dnaA had been deleted and because cells lacking a functional copy of dnaA cannot survive (Gorbatyuk and Marczynski, 2001Gorbatyuk B. Marczynski G.T. Physiological consequences of blocked Caulobacter crescentus dnaA expression, an essential DNA replication gene.Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 40: 485-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), we ruled out the possibility that colony growth was due to plasmid loss or mutations that abolish DnaA activity. To eliminate clones with plasmid-based mutations that simply reduced Pxyl-M2-dnaA expression, we assessed the lethality of the plasmid by retransforming it into wild-type cells and sequencing Pxyl-M2-dnaA. Most clones contained mutations in Pxyl and were therefore excluded from further analysis. In five clones, we identified mutations in the plasmid-borne dnaA leading to the amino acid substitutions I399T, A407T, V426E (discovered twice independently), and I448V (Figure 1A). All four residues are highly conserved and reside in the DNA binding domain of DnaA, suggesting that these mutations reduce DNA binding. In 30 clones, there were no mutations in Pxyl, dnaA, or elsewhere on the plasmid, suggesting that each harbored a chromosomal suppressor. We sequenced the genomes of ten of these clones. Strikingly, in all ten, the mutations mapped to dnaK, which encodes the major protein chaperone Hsp70 (Figure 1A). Together with the cochaperone DnaJ and the nucleotide exchange factor GrpE, this highly conserved chaperone promotes the folding of a wide range of proteins (Genevaux et al., 2007Genevaux P. Georgopoulos C. Kelley W.L. The Hsp70 chaperone machines of Escherichia coli: a paradigm for the repartition of chaperone functions.Mol. Microbiol. 2007; 66: 840-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, Hartl and Hayer-Hartl, 2009Hartl F.U. Hayer-Hartl M. Converging concepts of protein folding in vitro and in vivo.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2009; 16: 574-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (843) Google Scholar). We then sequenced dnaK, dnaJ, and grpE in our remaining 20 clones finding that each had a mutation in one of these three genes. In total, we identified 25 mutations in dnaK, four in dnaJ, and one in grpE (Figure 1A; Table S1 available online). Most mutations in dnaK resulted in substitutions of conserved residues in the ATPase and substrate binding domains. We also identified three nonsense mutations producing truncations and one 51 bp duplication within the dnaK coding region. All of the mutations identified in dnaJ were nonsense mutations that would retain the N-terminal J-domain, which interacts with DnaK (Genevaux et al., 2007Genevaux P. Georgopoulos C. Kelley W.L. The Hsp70 chaperone machines of Escherichia coli: a paradigm for the repartition of chaperone functions.Mol. Microbiol. 2007; 66: 840-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). In contrast to the parent dnaA overexpression strain, each suppressor strain tolerated growth in xylose when Pxyl-M2-dnaA was induced, but not in glucose when dnaA expression was only driven by leaky expression from the Pxyl promoter (Figure 1B), indicating that the suppressor mutations caused a reduction in active DnaA. For each suppressor strain, flow cytometry and phase microscopy indicated that the replication overinitiation phenotype of the parent strain in xylose had been greatly reduced. In the parent strain, growth for 2 hr in xylose led to a significant accumulation of extra chromosomes per cell and an inhibition of cell division (Jonas et al., 2011Jonas K. Chen Y.E. Laub M.T. Modularity of the bacterial cell cycle enables independent spatial and temporal control of DNA replication.Curr. Biol. 2011; 21: 1092-1101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) (Figure 1C). In contrast, the suppressor strains harboring mutations in dnaA, dnaK, dnaJ, or grpE showed only a mild accumulation of chromosomes and were able to divide, although cultures of strains with mutations in dnaK, dnaJ, or grpE grew slowly and were often heterogeneous, with some filamentous and small cells. Quantitative immunoblotting revealed that the suppressor strains with mutations in dnaK, dnaJ, and grpE consistently contained lower levels of M2-DnaA when grown in xylose (Figure 1D), suggesting that mutations in the chaperone system alter DnaA steady-state levels. DnaK is essential for viability in C. crescentus (da Silva et al., 2003da Silva A.C. Simão R.C. Susin M.F. Baldini R.L. Avedissian M. Gomes S.L. Downregulation of the heat shock response is independent of DnaK and sigma32 levels in Caulobacter crescentus.Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 49: 541-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). To investigate the role of DnaK in regulating DNA replication and DnaA, we used a depletion strain, in which the co-operonic dnaK and dnaJ genes are under the control of Pxyl at the native dnaKJ locus. Shifting cells from xylose to glucose resulted in the depletion of DnaK within 9 hr (Figure 2A). Flow cytometry revealed that over the course of DnaK/J depletion fewer cells entered S phase, whereas cells with a single chromosome accumulated, indicating that loss of DnaK/J resulted in an inability to initiate DNA replication (Figure 2B). Consistent with previous data (Susin et al., 2006Susin M.F. Baldini R.L. Gueiros-Filho F. Gomes S.L. GroES/GroEL and DnaK/DnaJ have distinct roles in stress responses and during cell cycle progression in Caulobacter crescentus.J. Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 8044-8053Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), prolonged depletion of DnaK/J led to filamentous cells without midcell division septa, a phenotype typical for G1 arrested Caulobacter cells. Overexpressing dnaA from a plasmid concomitant with the depletion of DnaK/J prevented cells from arresting in G1 (Figure 2C). In contrast to cells that possess DnaK/J, overproducing DnaA in DnaK/J-depleted cells did not cause replication overinitiation (Figure 2C), consistent with the finding that point mutations in dnaK, dnaJ, or grpE also suppressed replication overinitiation (Figure 1). Together, our data demonstrate that the DnaK (Hsp70) chaperone is required for DNA replication and that overproducing DnaA can bypass the need for DnaK/J in replication initiation. To test if the abundance of DnaA was affected by the loss of DnaK/J, we measured DnaA levels by immunoblotting. Strikingly, as DnaK/J were depleted, the level of DnaA also strongly declined. After 6 hr of DnaK/J depletion, DnaA was reduced by ∼80%, and after 9 hr it was barely detectable (Figure 2A). In contrast to DnaA, levels of the loading control protein RpoA remained high. The decrease in DnaA coincided with the cessation of replication that follows depletion of DnaK/J (Figure 2B), indicating that an absence of DnaA is a likely cause of the replication arrest. To assess whether the reduction in DnaA results from increased proteolysis, we measured DnaA degradation rates in vivo using chloramphenicol shutoff assays. In the presence of DnaK/J, DnaA had a half-life of ∼45 min (Figure 2D), which is slightly faster than previously reported (Gorbatyuk and Marczynski, 2005Gorbatyuk B. Marczynski G.T. Regulated degradation of chromosome replication proteins DnaA and CtrA in Caulobacter crescentus.Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 55: 1233-1245Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). In contrast, in cells depleted of DnaK/J for 5.5 hr, the half-life of DnaA was only 14 min, demonstrating that loss of DnaK/J results in more rapid degradation of DnaA in vivo. Prolonged depletion of DnaK/J also reduced growth rate and led to lower rates of DnaA synthesis (Figure S1; data not shown). However, DnaA synthesis did not decrease more than the synthesis of other proteins such as RpoA (Figure S1), suggesting that active proteolysis is the primary mechanism driving a drop in DnaA levels following depletion of DnaK/J. To determine which protease is responsible for DnaA degradation, we individually eliminated each of the five major ATP-dependent proteases in a DnaK/J depletion strain and measured the effect on DnaA steady-state levels by immunoblotting. We did not detect a significant change in steady-state DnaA levels after depleting cells of the essential protease subunits ClpP or ClpX for 8 hr, or in strains lacking functional ClpA, HslV, or a Lon-like protein (CCNA_00108), regardless of whether DnaK/J was depleted (Figures 3A and S2). The only protease mutant that substantially increased DnaA levels was Δlon (Figures 3A and S2). In the presence of DnaK/J, DnaA protein was slightly, but significantly, more abundant (∼1.7-fold) in Δlon cells compared to cells harboring wild-type lon. After depleting DnaK/J for 6–9 hr, steady-state DnaA levels were three to four times higher in the Δlon mutant compared to cells expressing wild-type lon. Because DnaA synthesis rates were not affected by the Δlon mutation (data not shown), the observed changes in DnaA steady state levels are likely caused by stabilization of the protein. A deletion of ftsH resulted in a modest (30%–40%) reduction in DnaA levels although this decrease may be indirect as Lon levels are increased ∼50% in an ftsH mutant (data not shown).Figure S2The Effect of Various Protease Mutations on DnaA Steady-State Levels in Cells Depleted of DnaK/J, Related to Figure 3Show full caption(A) Western blots showing DnaA and RpoA protein levels in the DnaK/J depletion strain and isogenic strains with mutations in lon, CCNA_00108 (lon-like), hslV, ftsH or clpA.

ClpX was depleted for 3 hr (-IPTG) before cells were shifted to glucose to also deplete DnaK/J. To examine the effect of Lon on DnaA stability, we performed in vivo degradation assays. As noted, the depletion of DnaK/J results in the rapid degradation of DnaA, with a protein half-life of ∼14 min (Figures 2D and 3B). Consistent with the observed increase in DnaA steady-state levels (Figures 3A and S2), we found that a deletion of lon caused a dramatic stabilization of DnaA, both in the presence and absence of DnaK/J (Figure 3B). In contrast to DnaA, CtrA (a ClpXP substrate) was not stabilized by a Δlon mutation (Figure S3A). We also measured DnaA stability in cells depleted of ClpP but did not see an effect after 8 hr of ClpP depletion in rich media (Figures S3B and S3C). A previous study suggested that ClpP, but not ClpX or ClpA, affects DnaA stability (Gorbatyuk and Marczynski, 2005Gorbatyuk B. Marczynski G.T. Regulated degradation of chromosome replication proteins DnaA and CtrA in Caulobacter crescentus.Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 55: 1233-1245Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), although that work examined cells in minimal media depleted of ClpP for 12 hr, which leads to a significant loss in cell viability (Jenal and Fuchs, 1998Jenal U. Fuchs T. An essential protease involved in bacterial cell-cycle control.EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5658-5669Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar), and used a different antibody. We conclude that Lon is the primary protease for DnaA but do not rule out a minor role for ClpP or a role in alternative conditions. To characterize the phenotypic consequences of a Δlon mutation in a DnaK/J depletion strain, we analyzed DNA replication, and cell morphology over the course of DnaK/J depletion. Strikingly, the stabilization of DnaA following DnaK/J depletion in a Δlon strain was sufficient to rescue the replication initiation defect of a DnaK/J depletion alone (Figure 3C). Instead of arresting with a single chromosome, cells harbored multiple chromosomes, indicating that the stabilized DnaA protein was active for replication initiation. These cells also became filamentous with multiple division septa suggesting that a loss of DnaK/J and Lon somehow affects cell division. In contrast to Δlon, none of the other protease mutations had a replication phenotype that differed substantially from the DnaK/J depletion alone (data not shown). Taken together, our data indicate that (1) Lon is a primary protease for DnaA and (2) depletion of the DnaK/J chaperone promotes DnaA proteolysis by Lon. How does the absence or disruption of DnaK/J trigger increased degradation of DnaA by Lon? We initially hypothesized that the loss of DnaK/J might affect the abundance of Lon. Indeed, Lon levels steadily increased over the course of DnaK/J depletion (Figure 4A). We suspected that the depletion of DnaK/J may induce Lon as part of the heat shock regulon that responds to proteotoxic stress. In E. coli, DnaK/J normally binds and destabilizes the sigma factor σ32, which can otherwise activate the heat shock regulon (Arsène et al., 2000Arsène F. Tomoyasu T. Bukau B. The heat shock response of Escherichia coli.Int. J. Food Microbiol. 2000; 55: 3-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar), including lon (Phillips et al., 1984Phillips T.A. VanBogelen R.A. Neidhardt F.C. lon gene product of Escherichia coli is a heat-shock protein.J. Bacteriol. 1984; 159: 283-287Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In Caulobacter, DnaK likely operates similarly to prevent the accumulation of active σ32 under nonstress conditions (da Silva et al., 2003da Silva A.C. Simão R.C. Susin M.F. Baldini R.L. Avedissian M. Gomes S.L. Downregulation of the heat shock response is independent of DnaK and sigma32 levels in Caulobacter crescentus.Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 49: 541-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar); hence, the depletion of DnaK should induce a heat shock response. Consistent with this hypothesis, we found, using DNA microarrays, that the depletion of DnaK/J for 5 hr resulted in an upregulation of genes encoding many known heat shock proteins (Figure 4B; Table S4). Among the induced genes were all of the ATP-dependent proteases (Figure 3A), including lon, which was 3.7-fold upregulated (Figure 4B). Importantly, the transcriptional changes induced by the depletion of DnaK/J were attenuated in a strain producing the mutant σ32(E174V), indicating that DnaK/J affects the heat shock regulon at least partly through σ32 (Figure 4B). We had identified σ32(E174V), along with σ32(Q202R), as suppressors of the lethality of a DnaK/J depletion strain (Figure 4C). In Caulobacter, σ32 is essential for viability so these mutations are likely partial loss-of-function alleles. These residues (E174 and Q202) are located in the conserved region 3 of σ32, which is required for binding to RNA polymerase. In E. coli this region also directly interacts with DnaK (Rodriguez et al., 2008Rodriguez F. Arsène-Ploetze F. Rist W. Rüdiger S. Schneider-Mergener J. Mayer M.P. Bukau B.

(p. 558 8) used a recently developed cytometric method to quantitate signaling through biochemical pathways in individual rat pheochromocytoma cells responding to growth factors. The signaling pathways studied provided about 1 bit of information, or only enough for a binary (on or off) decision. In spite of the simplicity, the results showed interactions between pathways with shared components. In some cases, information carried between inputs and intermediate outputs was less than that between the input and more “downstream” outputs, indicating that information was carried through multiple paths. Similarly, in the presence of pharmacological inhibitors of one pathway, others were able to compensate to allow robust transfer of information. Thus, in spite of noise and variation in signal intensities in individual cells, robust transfer of information from the growth factors was achieved."
https://openalex.org/W2025244901,"Planar cell polarity (PCP) is cellular polarity within the plane of an epithelial tissue or organ. PCP is established through interactions of the core Frizzled (Fz)/PCP factors and, although their molecular interactions are beginning to be understood, the upstream input providing the directional bias and polarity axis remains unknown. Among core PCP genes, Fz is unique as it regulates PCP both cell-autonomously and non-autonomously, with its extracellular domain acting as a ligand for Van Gogh (Vang). We demonstrate in Drosophila melanogaster wings that Wg (Wingless) and dWnt4 (Drosophila Wnt homologue) provide instructive regulatory input for PCP axis determination, establishing polarity axes along their graded distribution and perpendicular to their expression domain borders. Loss-of-function studies reveal that Wg and dWnt4 act redundantly in PCP determination. They affect PCP by modulating the intercellular interaction between Fz and Vang, which is thought to be a key step in setting up initial polarity, thus providing directionality to the PCP process."

Complexes of postsynaptic neuroligins and LRRTMs with presynaptic neurexins contribute widely to excitatory synapse development, and mutations in these gene families increase the risk of developing psychiatric disorders. We find that LRRTM4 has distinct presynaptic binding partners, heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs). HSPGs are required to mediate the synaptogenic activity of LRRTM4. LRRTM4 shows highly selective expression in the brain. Within the hippocampus, we detected LRRTM4 specifically at excitatory postsynaptic sites on dentate gyrus granule cells. LRRTM4(-/-) dentate gyrus granule cells, but not CA1 pyramidal cells, exhibit reductions in excitatory synapse density and function. Furthermore, LRRTM4(-/-) dentate gyrus granule cells show impaired activity-regulated AMPA receptor trafficking. These results identifying cell-type-specific functions and multiple presynaptic binding partners for different LRRTM family members reveal an unexpected complexity in the design and function of synapse-organizing proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1976786580,"Leucine-rich repeat (LRR) proteins have recently been identified as important regulators of synapse development and function, but for many LRR proteins the ligand-receptor interactions are not known. Here we identify the heparan sulfate (HS) proteoglycan glypican as a receptor for LRRTM4 using an unbiased proteomics-based approach. Glypican binds LRRTM4, but not LRRTM2, in an HS-dependent manner. Glypican 4 (GPC4) and LRRTM4 localize to the pre- and postsynaptic membranes of excitatory synapses, respectively. Consistent with a trans-synaptic interaction, LRRTM4 triggers GPC4 clustering in contacting axons and GPC4 induces clustering of LRRTM4 in contacting dendrites in an HS-dependent manner. LRRTM4 positively regulates excitatory synapse development in cultured neurons and in vivo, and the synaptogenic activity of LRRTM4 requires the presence of HS on the neuronal surface. Our results identify glypican as an LRRTM4 receptor and indicate that a trans-synaptic glypican-LRRTM4 interaction regulates excitatory synapse development."

It is unknown if the translocases cooperate and where the β-barrel of newly imported proteins is formed. We established a position-specific assay for monitoring β-barrel formation in vivo and in organello and demonstrated that the β-barrel was formed and membrane inserted while the precursor was bound to SAM. β-barrel formation was inhibited by SAM mutants and, unexpectedly, by mutants of the central import receptor, Tom22. We show that the cytosolic domain of Tom22 links TOM and SAM into a supercomplex, facilitating precursor transfer on the intermembrane space side.

Here, we use Drosophila as a model to explore the effects of diet on tumor progression.

We demonstrate that high dietary sugar also converts Ras/Src-transformed tissue from localized growths to aggressive tumors with emergent metastases. Whereas most tissues displayed insulin resistance, Ras/Src tumors retained insulin pathway sensitivity, increased the ability to import glucose, and resisted apoptosis. High dietary sugar increased canonical Wingless/Wnt pathway activity, which upregulated insulin receptor gene expression to promote insulin sensitivity. The result is a feed-forward circuit that amplified diet-mediated malignant phenotypes within Ras/Src-transformed tumors. By targeting multiple steps in this circuit with rationally applied drug combinations, we demonstrate the potential of combinatorial drug intervention to treat diet-enhanced malignant tumors."

The transmembrane mucin 1 (MUC1) oncoprotein is aberrantly overexpressed in breast cancer cells and associates with HER2. The present studies demonstrate that silencing MUC1 C-terminal subunit (MUC1-C) in HER2-overexpressing SKBR3 and BT474 breast cancer cells results in the downregulation of constitutive HER2 activation. Moreover, treatment with the MUC1-C inhibitor, GO-203, was associated with disruption of MUC1–C/HER2 complexes and decreases in tyrosine-phosphorylated HER2 (p-HER2) levels. In studies of trastuzumab-resistant SKBR3R and BT474R cells, we found that the association between MUC1-C and HER2 is markedly increased (∼20-fold) as compared with that in sensitive cells. In addition, silencing MUC1-C in the trastuzumab-resistant cells or treatment with GO-203 decreased p-HER2 and AKT activation. Moreover, targeting MUC1-C was associated with the downregulation of phospho-p27 and cyclin E, which confer trastuzumab resistance. Consistent with these results, targeting MUC1-C inhibited the growth and clonogenic survival of both trastuzumab-resistant cells. Our results further demonstrate that silencing MUC1-C reverses resistance to trastuzumab and that the combination of GO-203 and trastuzumab is highly synergistic. These findings indicate that MUC1-C contributes to constitutive activation of the HER2 pathway and that targeting MUC1-C represents a potential approach to abrogate trastuzumab resistance."

Neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson’s, Alzheimer’s, and Huntington diseases, are defined by their progressive loss of structure or function of anatomically defined groups of neurons. Neurodegenerative diseases affecting children are at the most severe end of the spectrum, often affecting key regulatory enzymes in neuronal function and energy metabolism. These diseases include lysosomal, peroxisomal, and mitochondrial defects such as Tay-Sachs, Zellweger, and Leigh syndromes, respectively, resulting in a host of specific early-onset neurodegenerative phenotypes. Although significant progress has been made in the underlying pathogenesis for both the adult and pediatric forms of disease, treatment currently remains out of reach for most patients (Thompson and Levitt, 2010Thompson B.L. Levitt P. The clinical-basic interface in defining pathogenesis in disorders of neurodevelopmental origin.Neuron. 2010; 67: 702-712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Much of cerebellar growth occurs after birth (Rakic and Sidman, 1970Rakic P. Sidman R.L. Histogenesis of cortical layers in human cerebellum, particularly the lamina dissecans.J. Comp.

Pontocerebellar hypoplasia (PCH) represents a group of rare inherited progressive neurodegenerative disorders with prenatal onset and up to seven subtypes with clear evidence for time-dependent loss of brain parenchyma (Barth, 1993Barth P.G.

The defect is observed at birth, and thus the condition was initially considered as a hypoplasia, but degenerative features are fully documented (Namavar et al., 2011Namavar Y. Barth P.G.

Additional features of PCH include progressive microcephaly, defects of the corpus callosum, and clinical features of swallowing and feeding difficulties along with limb spasticity. Death usually results from chronic medical complications within the first 10 years of life, and no treatments exist. Mutations in the evolutionarily conserved transfer RNA (tRNA) splicing endonuclease (TSEN) complex, including TSEN54, TSEN34, and TSEN2, were identified in some PCH patients to date (Budde et al., 2008Budde B.S.

In addition, PCH is associated with mutations in the CHMP1A gene, a regulator of BMI1-INK4A (Mochida et al., 2012Mochida G.H. Ganesh V.S. de Michelena M.I. Dias H. Atabay K.D. Kathrein K.L.

Yourshaw M. Mamsa H. Rudnik-Schöneborn S. Menezes M.P. Hong J.E. Leong D.W. Senderek J. Salman M.S.

Genet. 2012; 44: 704-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Thus, a host of pathways regulating RNA biology, polycomb signaling, and protein synthesis interplay in the etiology of PCH. Purine nucleotide metabolism is one of the most-studied processes in biology, critical for synthesis of ATP and guanosine triphosphate (GTP) to meet requirements both for energy production and nucleic acid synthesis (Nyhan, 2005Nyhan W.L. Disorders of purine and pyrimidine metabolism.Mol. Genet. Metab. 2005; 86: 25-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). The de novo purine synthetic pathway initiates with ribose-5-phosphate conversion to inosine monophosphate (IMP), which is then converted to either ATP or GTP, depending upon cellular requirements. The salvage pathway converts hypoxanthine and guanine to IMP and GMP, respectively, through the enzyme hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HGPRT) (see Table S1 for abbreviations, available online), which is mutated in Lesch-Nyhan syndrome. Adenine salvage to AMP occurs through adenine phosphoribosyltransferase, which is mutated in some patients with renal failure. Although these fundamental steps are understood at the biochemical level, the mechanisms of cellular vulnerability to purine toxicity are not well understood, and other than in Lesch-Nyhan syndrome, neurological consequences are rarely described (Camici et al., 2010Camici M. Micheli V. Ipata P.L. Tozzi M.G. Pediatric neurological syndromes and inborn errors of purine metabolism.Neurochem. Int. 2010; 56: 367-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In this study, we identify AMPD2 as necessary for guanine nucleotide biosynthesis and protein translation. Our data provide evidence that AMP deaminase activity is critical during neurogenesis. We describe a distinct type of PCH in five families caused by a defect in this enzymatic step that can be overcome at the cellular level by administration of a purine nucleotide precursor. In order to identify additional causes of pontocerebellar hypoplasia, we recruited a cohort of 30 probands and their families with a presumptive diagnosis of PCH. We previously excluded cases with overlapping conditions such as Walker-Warburg syndrome, cortical pachygyria, or evidence of altered metabolism such as elevations of serum lactate or abnormal peaks on standard clinical serum tandem mass spectroscopy. From these 30 families, 23 had documented parental consanguinity (first or second cousin marriages), and 21 displayed more than one affected member, which is consistent with the recessive mode of inheritance for PCH. Of the 30 probands, most had evidence of mild to moderate microcephaly, hypotonia/spasticity of the limbs, and progressive contractures. All patients had the classical MRI features of PCH (cerebellum and pontine size reduced at least by 50%) and were enrolled in this institutional review board (IRB)-approved genetic study. Exome sequence was generated in 68 individuals from either two probands (from multiplex families) or both parents and affected (from simplex families) and interrogated for homozygous, compound heterozygous, and de novo sequence changes and compared with our in-house database from 1,500 Middle Eastern exomes. One family each had a demonstrable mutation in EXOSC3 and TSEN2, and three families had mutations in TSEN54, all of which were predicted to be damaging to protein function and segregated according to a strictly recessive mode of inheritance. The results validated our recruitment strategy for PCH and suggested additional causes in the remaining families. Although several potentially mutated genes emerged from this screen, one was recurrent—the adenosine monophosphate deaminase-2 gene (AMPD2). AMPD2 encodes one of three known AMP deaminase homologs, which converts AMP to IMP. In total, five unique homozygous mutations in AMPD2 were independently identified in this cohort (Figures 1A and 1B ), including two premature stop codons: one in family PCH-1022 and the other within the most significant linkage interval in family PCH-1298 (Figure S1A). The other three mutations occur in α helixes, alter the charge, polarity, or helical propensity of highly conserved amino acids (Figures 1C and S1B) (Pace and Scholtz, 1998Pace C.N. Scholtz J.M. A helix propensity scale based on experimental studies of peptides and proteins.Biophys.

Chem. 2006; 281: 14939-14947Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Sanger sequencing confirmed that all five mutations segregated according to a strictly recessive model of inheritance with full penetrance (Figure S1C). These variants were not present in our in-house exome sequences of an additional 1,500 individuals or in publically available SNP databases. The results suggest that AMPD2 loss results in PCH.Figure S1Mutations in AMPD2 Predict Changes in Protein Structure and Loss of Brainstem and Cerebellar Structures, which Is Typical of PCH, Related to Figure 1Show full caption(A) Whole-genome SNP analysis of linkage results from family PCH-1298 with chromosomal position (x-axis) and multipoint LOD score (y-axis) showing maximum LOD score peak of 2.6 on chromosome 1 containing AMPD2 (red arrow).(B) Homology modeling of AMPD2 on the crystal structure of A. thaliana AMP deaminase (FAC1) as template.

Comparing brain MRI features among the five patients, we retrospectively identified a pathognomonic structural brain anomaly, which we propose as PCH type 9, that is distinct from other patients with PCH. In all patients, there was hypoplasia/atrophy of the cerebellum, with a fluid-filled posterior fossa (mega cisterna magna) and flattening of the ventral part of the pons. The unique finding was present on axial images in which the brainstem takes on a “figure 8” appearance, with relative preservation of the cerebellar vermis. There was also generalized atrophy of the cerebral cortex and severe corpus callosum hypoplasia (Figures 1A and S1D and Table S2), but other organs were spared. AMPD2 is one of three paralogs in mammals mediating the conversion of AMP to IMP (Bausch-Jurken et al., 1992Bausch-Jurken M.T. Mahnke-Zizelman D.K. Morisaki T. Sabina R.L.

Chem. 1992; 267: 22407-22413Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which are all branched from a single ancestral AMP Deaminase gene common with AMD1 (Figure 2A), the unique AMP deaminase in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Meyer et al., 1989Meyer S.L.

Production of amd strain, cloning, nucleotide sequence, and properties of the protein.Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 8734-8743Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Human AMPD2 has the most sequence similarity to AMD1 (53% identity and 69% similarity over 623 amino acids), as compared with AMPD1 and 3. Individuals with AMPD1 homozygous mutations display Myoadenylate deaminase deficiency (MIM+102770), which is possibly the most prevalent genetic disease in humans. However, only a small percent of homozygous-deficient individuals show symptoms, including exercise-stress-induced accumulation of AMP with resultant muscle weakness and cramping (Fishbein et al., 1978Fishbein W.N.

AMPD3 shows homozygous inactivating mutations in healthy individuals (Ogasawara et al., 1987Ogasawara N. Goto H. Yamada Y. Nishigaki I. Itoh T. Hasegawa I. Park K.S. Deficiency of AMP deaminase in erythrocytes.Hum. Genet. 1987; 75: 15-18PubMed Google Scholar), with increased adenosine nucleotide levels in erythrocytes (Mendelian Inheritance in Man [MIM]: 612874). RT-PCR analysis of the gene family in human tissue shows expression of AMPD1 predominantly restricted to muscle but shows AMPD2 and -3 with widespread expression (Figure S2A).Figure S2AMPD2 Is Ubiquitously Expressed, and Mutations Cause Loss of Function with No Compensatory Expression of AMPD3, Related to Figure 2Show full caption(A) RT-PCR expression pattern of human AMPD1, AMPD2, AMPD3, HPRT (Hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase) and ACTIN.

Mean ± SD of two replicates. To determine whether human AMPD2 is a functional ortholog of yeast AMD1, we expressed AMPD2 in the yeast amd1 mutant (Jones, 1982Jones E.W.F.G.R. Regulation of amino acid and nucleotide biosynthesis in yeast.in: Strathern J.N. Jones E.W. Broach J.R. The Molecular Biology of the Yeast Saccharomyces: Metabolism and Gene Expression. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982: 181-299Google Scholar). As previously reported (Saint-Marc et al., 2009Saint-Marc C. Pinson B. Coulpier F. Jourdren L. Lisova O. Daignan-Fornier B. Phenotypic consequences of purine nucleotide imbalance in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Genetics. 2009; 183: 529-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), this mutant shows a strong germination and/or growth of spore phenotype in the presence of adenine, which is rescued by forced expression of yeast AMD1 under the tetracycline response element (Figure S2B). Presumably, the presence of exogenous adenine effectively stresses the cells, resulting in further accumulation of adenosine nucleotides. Using the same vector system, we found that human AMPD2 complementary DNA (cDNA) showed near-complete rescue of growth (Figure 2B). We next expressed in the yeast amd1 mutant each of the identified patient mutations introduced in the AMD1 gene in order to test for altered activity. In the presence of doxycycline, AMD1 rescued the amd1 phenotype, but mutated versions of the yeast gene failed to complement the growth defect (Figure 2C). We conclude that the patient mutations represent null alleles. Some residual activity was, however, observed in conditions of overexpression for corresponding mutations E778D and R674H (Figure S2C), suggesting that some patient missense mutations may maintain minimal residual activity. In order to determine the effect of mutations on protein function in mammalian cells at physiological expression levels, we obtained skin fibroblast cultures from patients and one unaffected parent in three different families. AMPD2 protein was nearly completely absent in patient cells (Figure 2D). By the assessment of AMP deaminase activity from lysed patient cells in the presence of exogenous AMP (Kirkwood et al., 2012Kirkwood J.S. Lebold K.M. Miranda C.L. Wright C.L. Miller G.W. Tanguay R.L. Barton C.L. Traber M.G. Stevens J.F. Vitamin C deficiency activates the purine nucleotide cycle in zebrafish.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 3833-3841Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), we found reduction of 80%–90% of activity (Figure 2E), suggesting no compensatory effect by AMPD3 expression in these cells (Figure S2D). We conclude that patient cells show severe reductions in AMPD2 levels and AMP deaminase activity. The near-complete absence of enzymatic AMP deaminase activity prompted a search for a phenotype in patient cells. However, we found that cell growth and survival of fibroblasts were unaffected under basal growth conditions and found no evidence of altered purine nucleotide levels (Figures S3A and S3B). The amd1 yeast mutant shows growth restriction only in the presence of exogenous adenine, which feeds directly into AMP through APRT (Alfonzo et al., 1997Alfonzo J.D. Sahota A. Taylor M.W. Purification and characterization of adenine phosphoribosyltransferase from Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1341: 173-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Thus, we considered that addition of exogenous purines to these cells might uncover relevant phenotypes. We utilized adenosine, which is both bioavailable and feeds into AMP through adenosine kinase (Figure 3A), and found a dose-dependent effect on cell survival in patient fibroblasts in the range of 50–500 μM concentrations, dropping to about half of untreated survival rates. Cells from unaffected family members showed no effect of adenosine at these concentrations (Figures 3B and 3C). We conclude that, like the yeast amd1 mutant, metabolic stress is required to uncover phenotypic consequences in AMPD2 mutant cells.Figure 3Adenosine Supplementation Reduces Viability of AMPD2-Deficient Patient-Derived CellsShow full caption(A) Schematic of nucleotide metabolic pathway.

See also Figure S3 and Tables S1 and S3. To study the mechanism of human neuronal vulnerability in AMPD2 mutants, we generated induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from families PCH-1298 and PCH-1236 and from both affected (AMPD2 homozygous mutants) and unaffected (heterozygous controls). Because there is generalized brain affection in PCH9 patients (including microcephaly and corpus callosum involvement), we reasoned that standard neural-induction-protocol-derived cells might capture the neuronal vulnerability observed in patients. We demonstrated expression of pluripotency markers, differentiation to three germ layers after embryoid body formation, and generation of neural progenitor cells (NPCs) using standard methods of derivation (Chambers et al., 2009Chambers S.M. Fasano C.A. Papapetrou E.P. Tomishima M. Sadelain M. Studer L. Highly efficient neural conversion of human ES and iPS cells by dual inhibition of SMAD signaling.Nat. Biotechnol. 2009; 27: 275-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (2421) Google Scholar) (Figures 3D and S3C). Growth rates and purine nucleotide levels were indistinguishable in standard culture medium (Figures S3D and S3E), as were survival of neural progenitor cells. We confirmed the absence of AMPD2 and a nearly complete loss of AMP deaminase activity (Figure S3F). Standard NPC medium lacks adenosine (Table S3), whereas concentrations from 20 nM to 300 μM are well documented in mammalian brain (Rathbone et al., 1999Rathbone M.P. Middlemiss P.J. Gysbers J.W. Andrew C. Herman M.A. Reed J.K. Ciccarelli R. Di Iorio P. Caciagli F. Trophic effects of purines in neurons and glial cells.Prog. Neurobiol. 1999; 59: 663-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). Thus, we tested a range of adenosine concentrations and found that the survival of AMPD2 mutant, but not control NPCs, dropped considerably at concentration as low as 5 μM (Figures 3E and 3F), which is an order of magnitude more sensitive than the isogenic patient fibroblasts. To test for specificity of the effect, we transduced affected NPCs with either AMPD2 or a fluorescent tag and found restoration of survival specifically following AMPD2 transduction (Figure S3G). Thus, the addition of physiological adenosine concentrations to the AMPD2 mutant cells can recapitulate the neural-specific defect observed in patients, providing a model to further explore the underlying mechanisms leading to neurodegeneration. We predicted that cellular uptake of adenosine is necessary for cellular toxicity in AMPD2 mutant cells. We thus treated NPCs with 5-Iodotubercidin to inhibit adenosine uptake and found that it efficiently blocked adenosine toxicity (Figure S4A). In contrast, treatment with the adenosine receptor antagonist CSG15943 did not rescue adenosine-mediated toxicity, and the class P1 purinergic receptor agonist 5‘-(N-ethylcarboxamido)-adenosine (NECA) was not sufficient to compromise survival (Figures"
https://openalex.org/W2146860878,"In addition to well-characterized CD34(+) hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs), the human hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) hierarchy contains a rare CD34(-) population with severe combined immunodeficiency-repopulating capacity. However, little is known about the molecular characteristics of these CD34(-) cells or their relationship to the CD34(+) populations. Here, we show that the self-renewing Lin(-)CD34(-)CD38(-)CD93(hi) population contains cells that not only function as HSCs, but can also be placed above the CD34(+) populations in the hematopoietic hierarchy. These cells have an active Notch pathway, in which signaling through Delta4 is crucial for maintenance of the primitive state, and combined signals from Jagged1 and TGF-β are important in controlling its quiescence. They are also refractory to proliferative signals and show a repressed canonical Wnt pathway, in part regulated by Notch. Overall, therefore, CD34(-) cells represent an immature and quiescent human HSC population maintained through a distinctive network of cellular signaling interactions."

Mashek D.G. Mammalian triacylglycerol metabolism: Synthesis, lipolysis, and signaling.Chem. Rev. 2011; 111: 6359-6386Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). A second esterification at the sn-2 position is catalyzed by acylglycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase. The phosphate is then hydrolyzed by phosphatidic acid phosphohydrolase (lipin), and then a final acylation is catalyzed by diacylglycerol acyltransferase to form TAG. In addition to their roles in TAG synthesis, the phosphatidic acid and diacylglycerol intermediates in this pathway are precursors for all the glycerophospholipids, and they initiate signaling pathways. The pathway of TAG biosynthesis is remarkable for the number of isoenzymes that catalyze each step. For example, four independent GPAT isoforms, each encoded by a separate gene, catalyze the formation of lysophosphatidic acid, but it is unclear why GPAT enzyme redundancy is required. Studies of mice with deleted GPATs show that the isoforms present in liver include primarily GPAT1 (2Hammond L.E. Gallagher P.A. Wang S. Hiller S. Kluckman K.D. Posey-Marcos E.L. Maeda N.

Hepatic triacylglycerol synthesis is enhanced by the increased availability of long-chain fatty acids synthesized within hepatocytes from dietary glucose or from fatty acid that enters hepatocytes exogenously from dietary chylomicron remnants or as free fatty acids lipolyzed from adipose tissue. Because SREBP1c concomitantly up-regulates both GPAT1 and the enzymes that catalyze the de novo synthesis of fatty acids, including acetyl-CoA carboxylase and fatty acid synthase (14Moon Y.A.

At 8 weeks of age, littermate controls and Gpat1−/− and Gpat4−/− mice were either fasted for 24 h or fasted for 24 h and then refed a high sucrose diet for 48 h before sacrifice. The high sucrose diet was modified from Research Diets D12450B (10% kcal of fat, 20% kcal of protein, and 70% kcal of carbohydrate (525 g/kg of sucrose, 175 g/kg of corn starch)). To isolate hepatocytes, after mice were anesthetized with 250 mg/kg of Avertin, a 22-gauge catheter was inserted into the vena cava, and the liver was perfused with wash buffer (10 mm Hepes, 132 mm NaCl, 6.7 mm KCl, 20 mm glucose, 0.5 m adenosine, 100 mm EGTA, 140 nm insulin, pH 7.4) and then with digestion buffer (100 mm HEPES, 57 mm NaCl, 6.7 mm KCl, 5 mm CaCl2, 20 mm glucose, 0.45 mg/ml type 1 collagenase, pH 7.4).

The hepatocytes were dissociated and filtered through a cell strainer, centrifuged at 4 °C at 50 × g for 3 min, and then washed once in Williams’ medium E. The cells were resuspended in Williams' medium E:Percoll (16 ml:14 ml), centrifuged at 4 °C at 400 × g for 8 min, and washed with Williams' medium E. Cells were plated onto 60-mm collagen-coated dishes and incubated for 90 min in Williams' medium E + 10% FBS. After the cells attached, the medium was changed to Williams' medium E, 100 units of penicillin/streptomycin, 50 nm insulin, 0.1 μm dexamethasone, and 0.1% BSA. Hepatocytes were cultured overnight in 60-mm plates and then scraped and homogenized in cold Medium I (250 mm sucrose, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol) with 10 up-and-down strokes with a Teflon glass motor-driven homogenizer. Liver was minced and then homogenized similarly. Total membranes were isolated by centrifuging the homogenate at 100,000 × g for 1 h. GPAT specific activity was assayed for 10 min at room temperature in a 200- μl reaction mixture containing 75 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 4 mm MgCl2, 1 mg/ml BSA (essentially fatty acid-free), 1 mm dithiothreitol, 8 mm NaF, 800 μm [3H]glycerol 3-phosphate, and 80 μm palmitoyl-CoA (20Lu B.

The reaction was initiated by adding 10–30 μg of membrane protein after incubating the membrane protein on ice for 15 min in the presence or absence of 2 mm N-ethylmaleimide (NEM), which inactivates GPAT isoforms 2, 3, and 4. The reaction products were extracted into CHCl3, dried under N2, resuspended in 4 ml of Cytoscint, and counted on a scintillation counter. NEM-resistant activity (GPAT1) was calculated by subtracting NEM-sensitive activity from total activity.

Sixteen to 20 h after plating, hepatocytes were labeled with 0.5 ml of labeling buffer (Krebs Ringer buffer, 10 mm HEPES, 5.5 mm glucose, 0.25% fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin (BSA), and 1 mm carnitine) containing 500 μm [1-14C]acetic acid or [1-14C]palmitic acid for 2 h. Media were removed, and CO2 was liberated by adding 100 μl of 70% perchloric acid and trapped in 1 m NaOH. An aliquot of the NaOH was counted to measure radiolabeled CO2. To quantify intracellular oxidation metabolites, fresh Krebs Ringer buffer and 100 μl of 70% perchloric acid were added to each plate, and acidified supernatants were collected. The acidified media and cell supernatants were incubated overnight with BSA and then centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 20 min. Aliquots of the supernatant were counted to measure radiolabeled acid-soluble metabolites (ASM), a measure of incomplete fatty acid oxidation. Cells were washed with 1% BSA and then with phosphate-buffered saline before lipids were extracted (16Folch J. Lees M. Sloane Stanley G.H.

Lipid extracts and standards were separated by thin layer chromatography on Partisil LK5D silica gel plates in a two-phase system: chloroform:methanol:ammonium hydroxide (65:25:4, v/v/v) run to 50% of the plate and then dried and followed by heptane:isopropyl ether:acetic acid (60:40:4, v/v/v) run to the top of the plate.

Livers were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen, pulverized, and weighed. The pulverized liver (50–100 mg) was homogenized in acetonitrile:water:formic acid (50:49.7:0.3; v/v) at a final concentration of 50 mg/ml. Acylcarnitines were analyzed by flow injection tandem mass spectrometry (17An J. Muoio D.M. Shiota M. Fujimoto Y. Cline G.W. Shulman G.I. Koves T.R. Stevens R. Millington D. Newgard C.B.

Samples were stored at −80 °C before analysis. Data represent means ± S.E. of at least three independent experiments performed in triplicate unless indicated otherwise. In vitro models were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance comparing each genotype versus controls and post hoc comparisons of diet conditions within each genotype. Data were considered significant at p < 0.05. To compare the contributions of GPAT1 and GPAT4 to the total amount of GPAT activity, we isolated and cultured primary hepatocytes from control, Gpat1−/−, and Gpat4−/− mice and measured GPAT specific activity in the presence and absence of NEM, which inhibits GPAT2, 3, and 4 (Fig. 1A). When compared with wild type hepatocytes, total GPAT specific activity in Gpat1−/− hepatocytes was 35% lower and minimal residual NEM-resistant GPAT activity remained, whereas NEM-sensitive GPAT activity was unchanged. Total GPAT specific activity in Gpat4−/− hepatocytes was 42% lower than in control hepatocytes; NEM-resistant GPAT specific activity was unchanged, but NEM-sensitive GPAT activity was 60% lower. The residual NEM-sensitive GPAT activity is likely due to GPAT2 and -3. These results show that isolated and cultured primary hepatocytes retained GPAT activity and that the specific activity was similar in Gpat1−/− and Gpat4−/− hepatocytes. To determine whether other GPAT isoforms were affected by deletion of either GPAT1 or GPAT4, we measured mRNA expression of each GPAT isoform (Fig. 1B). In Gpat1−/− hepatocytes, Gpat3 mRNA abundance was 2-fold higher than in wild type hepatocytes, but NEM-sensitive GPAT activity did not change, indicating a lack of compensation. In the absence of GPAT4, the mRNA expression of Gpat2 and -3 increased 2.5- and 3.5-fold, respectively. GPAT2 activity is extremely low in liver (5Wang S. Lee D.P. Gong N. Schwerbrock N.M. Mashek D.G. Gonzalez-Baró M.R. Stapleton C. Li L.O. Lewin T.M. Coleman R.A. Cloning and functional characterization of a novel mitochondrial N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase (GPAT2).Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2007; 465: 347-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), and even when the amount of Gpat2 mRNA doubles, it probably does not contribute substantially to total NEM-sensitive GPAT activity. However, because we cannot differentiate between GPAT3 and GPAT4 protein or activity, the 42% lower NEM-sensitive GPAT activity (Fig. 1B) could reflect partial compensation by GPAT3. Because GPAT1 is up-regulated by SREBP1c, we hypothesized that it might be functionally and specifically linked to de novo lipogenesis, such that newly synthesized fatty acids would be incorporated into TAG. Using [1-14C]acetate, we measured the ability of control, Gpat1−/−, and Gpat4−/− hepatocytes to incorporate de novo synthesized fatty acid into TAG and PL. The incorporation of acetate into TAG and PL was equal in hepatocytes from wild type and Gpat4−/− mice; however, in Gpat1−/− hepatocytes, the incorporation of [14C]acetate into PL was 78% lower than in controls, and the incorporation into TAG was virtually absent (Fig. 2, A and B). When wild type and Gpat4−/− hepatocytes were cultured in the presence of the fatty acid synthase inhibitor C75, [14C]acetate incorporation into TAG was inhibited 80–85% (Fig. 2A). However, in Gpat1−/− hepatocytes, C75 had no additional effect, indicating that the absence of GPAT1 in hepatocytes had abolished the incorporation of the de novo synthesized fatty acid. In wild type and Gpat4−/− hepatocytes, C75 decreased acetate incorporation into PL by 60%, but only by 27% in Gpat1−/− hepatocytes (Fig. 2B). In each group of hepatocytes, the addition of C75 decreased the incorporation of acetate into free fatty acids by more than 72% (data not shown). These results show that GPAT1, but not GPAT4, is required to incorporate de novo synthesized fatty acid into complex lipids. In addition to de novo synthesis, liver fatty acids are also derived from exogenous sources. To distinguish between the functions of GPAT1 and GPAT4 in the use of exogenous fatty acids, we measured the incorporation of [1-14C]palmitate into glycerolipids in primary hepatocytes. In contrast to fatty acids derived from de novo synthesis, the incorporation of [1-14C]palmitate into TAG and PL was not altered by the absence of either GPAT1 or GPAT4 (Fig. 3, A and B), indicating that neither isoform was essential for the use of exogenous fatty acid. Thus, in both Gpat4−/− and Gpat1−/− hepatocytes, the remaining GPAT isoforms can fully incorporate exogenous fatty acid into glycerolipids. Previous studies have strongly suggested that GPAT1 competes with CPT1 for acyl-CoAs at the outer mitochondrial membrane (12Hammond L.E. Neschen S. Romanelli A.J. Cline G.W. Ilkayeva O.R. Shulman G.I. Muoio D.M. Coleman R.A. Mitochondrial glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase-1 is essential in liver for the metabolism of excess acyl-CoAs.J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 25629-25636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). To confirm this competition for acyl-CoAs and to determine whether GPAT4 located on the endoplasmic reticulum competes similarly, we measured the incorporation of [1-14C]palmitate into ASM, a measure of incomplete fatty acid oxidation. Gpat1−/− hepatocytes oxidized [14C]palmitate at a rate 200% higher than control hepatocytes, but the incorporation of [14C]palmitate into ASM by Gpat4−/− hepatocytes was unchanged (Fig. 3C). Of the total ASM extracted from the media and cells, intracellular ASM comprises only 5% of the total ASM (Fig. 3C, inset); thus, media ASM reflect 95% of the total ASM produced. These data show that only GPAT1 competes with CPT1 for acyl-CoAs, thereby diminishing the flux of fatty acid into the mitochondria for oxidation. To confirm the disparate effects of each GPAT isoform on the β-oxidation of exogenous versus de novo synthesized fatty acid in vivo, we measured hepatic acylcarnitine content in wild type, Gpat1−/−, and Gpat4−/− mice after food was removed for 24 h. Because fasting increases the flux of adipose-derived fatty acids into the liver, more fatty acids are transported to the mitochondria via CPT1, thereby elevating the content of hepatic long-chain acylcarnitines. These metabolites are subsequently reconverted to acyl-CoAs in the mitochondrial matrix, where they enter the β-oxidation pathway. In fasting mice of each genotype, the content of free carnitine (C0), acetylcarnitine (C2), and short-chain (C3-C6) and medium-chain (C8-C12) acylcarnitine species was similar (Fig. 4, A and C). Consistent with the hypothesized ability of GPAT1 to compete with CPT1 for acyl-CoAs, total long-chain (C14-C22) acylcarnitine content in fasted Gpat1−/− liver was 3-fold higher than in control liver (Fig. 4C). The most abundant long-chain acylcarnitine species, 14:0, 16:1, 16:0, 18:2, 18:1, and 18:0, were 2–6-fold higher than in control liver (Fig. 4E). In contrast, and consistent with the in vitro data, the acylcarnitine content in livers of fasted Gpat4−/− mice was similar to that of control mice. Because GPAT1 was essential for the incorporation of de novo synthesized fatty acids into complex lipids in vitro, we predicted that the absence of hepatic GPAT1 in vivo would also increase the transport of de novo synthesized fatty acids into mitochondria. To test this hypothesis, we fasted mice for 24 h and then refed them with a high sucrose diet for 48 h to stimulate de novo lipogenesis. The total long-chain (C14-C22) acylcarnitine content of Gpat1−/− liver remained 3.5-fold higher than that of controls, and the most abundant long-chain acylcarnitine species, 14:0, 16:1, 16:0, 18:2, 18:1 and 18:0, ranged from 2- to 5-fold higher (Fig. 4, D and F). In contrast, no differences were observed in the hepatic acylcarnitine content of Gpat4−/− mice that had been fasted and then refed (Fig. 4, B, D, and F). Thus, GPAT1, but not GPAT4, was required in vivo to diminish CPT1-mediated transport of both de novo synthesized and exogenous fatty acid. Because the absence of GPAT1 increased hepatic β-oxidation of de novo synthesized fatty acids in vivo, we predicted that the liver TAG content would be low. After a 24-h fast, hepatic TAG content in control, Gpat4−/−, and Gpat1−/− liver was similar. After refeeding a high sucrose diet to enhance de novo lipogenesis, the TAG content in control and"

Here we elucidate molecular events at synapses that cause this plasticity and the resulting behavioral response to cocaine in mice. In response to D1-dopamine-receptor signaling that is induced by drug administration, the glutamate-receptor protein metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5) is phosphorylated by microtubule-associated protein kinase (MAPK), which we show potentiates Pin1-mediated prolyl-isomerization of mGluR5 in instances where the product of an activity-dependent gene, Homer1a, is present to enable Pin1-mGluR5 interaction. These biochemical events potentiate N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR)-mediated currents that underlie synaptic plasticity and cocaine-evoked motor sensitization as tested in mice with relevant mutations. The findings elucidate how a coincidence of signals from the nucleus and the synapse can render mGluR5 accessible to activation with consequences for drug-induced dopamine responses and point to depotentiation at corticostriatal synapses as a possible therapeutic target for treating addiction."

https://openalex.org/W2048679131,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are thought to control tumor metastasis through direct interactions with target genes. Thyroid hormone (T3) and its receptor (TR) are involved in cell growth and cancer progression. However, the issue of whether miRNAs participate in T3/TR-mediated tumor migration is yet to be established. In the current study, we demonstrated that T3/TR negatively regulates mature miR-17 transcript expression, both in vitro and in vivo. Luciferase reporter and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays localized the regions responding to TR-mediated repression to positions −2234/−2000 of the miR-17 promoter sequence. Overexpression of miR-17 markedly inhibited cell migration and invasion in vitro and in vivo, mediated via suppression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP)-3. Moreover, p-AKT expression was increased in miR-17-knockdown cells that led to enhanced cell invasion, which was blocked by LY294002. Notably, low miR-17 expression was evident in highly metastatic cells. The cell migration ability was increased by T3, but partially reduced upon miR-17 overexpression. Notably, TRα1 was frequently upregulated in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) samples and associated with low overall survival (P=0.023). miR-17 expression was significantly negatively associated with TRα1 (P=0.033) and MMP3 (P=0.043) in HCC specimens.

Here, STAT3 expression, activity and cellular functions were examined in two main histotypes of esophageal carcinomas. In situ, immunohistochemistry for STAT3 and STAT3-Tyr705 phosphorylation (P-STAT3) in esophageal squamous cell carcinomas (ESCC, n=49) and Barrett’s adenocarcinomas (BAC, n=61) revealed similar STAT3 expression in ESCCs and BACs (P=0.109), but preferentially activated P-STAT3 in ESCCs (P=0.013). In vitro, strong STAT3 activation was seen by epidermal growth factor (EGF) stimulation in OE21 (ESCC) cells, whereas OE33 (BAC) cells showed constitutive weak STAT3 activation. STAT3 knockdown significantly reduced cell proliferation of OE21 (P=0.0148) and OE33 (P=0.0243) cells. Importantly, STAT3 knockdown reduced cell migration of OE33 cells by 2.5-fold in two types of migration assays (P=0.073, P=0.015), but not in OE21 cells (P=0.1079, P=0.386). Investigation of transcriptome analysis of STAT3 knockdown revealed a reduced STAT3 level associated with significant downregulation of cell cycle genes in both OE21 (P<0.0001) and OE33 (P=0.01) cells. In contrast, genes promoting cell migration (CTHRC1) were markedly upregulated in OE21 cells, whereas a gene linked to tight-junction stabilization and restricted cell motility (SHROOM2) was downregulated in OE21 but upregulated in OE33 cells. This study shows frequent, but distinct, patterns of STAT3 expression and activation in ESCCs and BACs. STAT3 knockdown reduces cell proliferation in ESCC and BAC cells, inhibits migration of BAC cells and may support cell migration of ESCC cells. Thereby, novel STAT3-regulated genes involved in ESCC and BAC cell proliferation and cell migration were identified. Thus, STAT3 may be further exploited as a potential novel therapeutic target, however, by careful distinction between the two histotypes of esophageal cancers."

Derivation of eggs or sperm from pluripotent stem cells or direct reprogramming from somatic cells would have huge effects on assisted reproductive technology. Here we discuss important ethical, legal, and social issues that would be raised by the development of such female or male gametes for clinical use. Recent advances in stem cell biology have now made it conceivable that human eggs or sperm could potentially be derived from pluripotent stem cells or direct reprogramming of somatic cells. Most notably, Saitou and colleagues recently demonstrated the successful induction of sperm and oocytes from mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) (Hayashi et al., 2011Hayashi K. Ohta H. Kurimoto K. Aramaki S. Saitou M. Cell. 2011; 146: 519-532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (918) Google Scholar, Hayashi et al., 2012Hayashi K. Ogushi S. Kurimoto K. Shimamoto S. Ohta H. Saitou M. Science. 2012; 338: 971-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). Although there is room for improvement in the protocols, the work abolished several technical barriers in mouse cells with the demonstration that viable progeny could be derived from pluripotent stem cells. Similarly, over the last decade, much progress has been made in the differentiation of human germ cells from both human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) and human iPSCs (hiPSCs). A recent report indicated that hiPSCs can be differentiated into primordial germ cells (PGCs) via use of bone morphogenetic proteins (Panula et al., 2011Panula S. Medrano J.V. Kee K. Bergström R. Nguyen H.N. Byers B. Wilson K.D. Wu J.C. Simon C. Hovatta O. Reijo Pera R.A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2011; 20: 752-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). In addition, hESCs and hiPSCs differentiated directly into male germ cell lineages, including postmeiotic, spermatid-like cells, without receiving genetic manipulation (Easley et al., 2012Easley 4th, C.A. Phillips B.T. McGuire M.M. Barringer J.M. Valli H. Hermann B.P. Simerly C.R. Rajkovic A. Miki T. Orwig K.E. Schatten G.P. Cell Rep. 2012; 2: 440-446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Although production of human oocytes from female pluripotent stem cells has not yet been described, the data from the mouse experiments may help overcome some of the critical problems and lead to the rapid derivation of human oocytes. Five years have passed since an international consortium published a consensus paper on various issues concerning stem-cell-derived gametes (The Hinxton Group, 2008). The time is right to reconsider the research response to the production of human germ cells in vitro from PSCs or somatic cells, as well as what steps might ensure the ability to move research to clinical applications. This research should improve our understanding of human developmental biology and should contribute to advancing knowledge of the pathology, diagnosis, and uses of assisted reproductive technology (ART). As we move forward, however, many ethical, legal, and social issues lie ahead. One key issue is the need to assess the function of induced germ cells; this implies the need for research that tests human induced sperm and eggs to determine if they can successfully participate in fertilization and produce normal embryos. For example, generation of sperm and eggs positive for specific male and female germ cell markers and negative for those specific to pluripotent stem cells should be ensured. Additionally, appropriate epigenetic programming, properly imprinted sperm and egg chromatin, and appropriate organization of the sperm and egg nucleus and mitochondrial structure should be evaluated. Thereafter, the creation of human embryos may, as a final biological assay, be exceptionally necessary in a preclinical stage to ensure safety of the induced cells. Currently, many countries allow derivation of hESCs from surplus in vitro fertilization (IVF) embryos, subject to some conditions, but many jurisdictions limit or ban production of human embryos for research purposes. This raises the question of where and under what circumstances the research necessary to explore the medical potential of human induced germ cells can be legally and ethically performed. Should such cells be brought to the clinic, a different set of controversial issues will appear. In this article, we scrutinize the questions concerning embryo research and point out some of the issues that eventual clinical use will raise. In fertility clinics, ART generally begins with ovulation via hormonal stimulation followed by oocyte retrieval for IVF. In cases of male infertility, the use of intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) is often required to produce viable embryos with one or a few sperm. Following fertilization, embryos are cultured, generally for 3–5 days, and one or more is selected for transfer to the uterus (Niakan et al., 2012Niakan K.K. Han J. Pedersen R.A. Simon C. Pera R.A. Development. 2012; 139: 829-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Remaining preimplantation embryos are then either stored under cryopreservation for future embryo transfer to a patient or discarded. Following successful pregnancies, cryopreserved embryos may subsequently be discarded, given to other prospective parents, or donated to research. Research that makes use of surplus embryos must meet guidelines of institutional review boards (IRBs) or equivalent bodies, especially in terms of prior informed consent of parental donors. Notably, the derivation of hESC lines is generally conducted using the existing and surplus embryos that were originally created for ART and are no longer required for reproductive purposes. For many people, and governments, the fact that the embryos were initially created for reproductive purposes is crucial to their ethical use for research once intended reproductive uses are no longer contemplated. Regarding national policy of human embryo creation for research purposes, we investigated 17 countries that permit hESC derivation from the surplus embryos (Table S1 available online). Fifteen of these countries permit creation of embryos for research purposes in at least some circumstances: Australia, Belgium, Canada, China, Denmark, India, Israel, Japan, Singapore, South Africa, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, the UK, and the US (in some but not all states). All of these countries, by statutes or by guidelines, limit the culture period of the created embryo to either the 14th day of embryo development or the formation of the primitive streak, which begins roughly at that time. This restriction has been justified on the grounds that the formation of the primitive streak signifies the start of a unique, human being (The President’s Council on Bioethics, 2002The President’s Council on BioethicsHuman Cloning and Human Dignity: An Ethical Inquiry. The US Government, Washington, D.C.2002Google Scholar). In some of the permissive countries, researchers are required to provide specific justification for why they need to create embryos for research. In Australia, Belgium, Canada, India, Israel, Japan, Singapore, South Africa, South Korea, Spain, and the UK, the laws or guidelines require a public license or authorization to create human embryos for research. In addition to the need to account for the creation of embryos for research purposes, some explanation for the decision not to use surplus IVF embryos is also required in the review process. In countries that allow the creation of embryos for research, therapeutic cloning using somatic cell nuclear transfer is frequently indicated as a permitted purpose. Others include hESC derivation, parthenogenesis, and special embryos including “hybrid embryos” in Australia and “cytoplasmic hybrids” in Singapore and the UK. Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Japan, and the UK permit research that creates human embryos for improving or providing instruction in ART. The Australian act indicated the possibility of creating human embryos using “precursor cells” from human embryos. Notably, the “precursor cells” might be regarded as the germ cells induced from hESCs, but not from hiPSCs. Japan has guidelines for inducing germ cells from human iPSCs, ESCs, and tissue-specific stem cells, but those guidelines currently prohibit fertilization using the induced germ cells. Thus, it seems clear that researchers in Australia, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, and the UK, might, after prior consultation or permission from a regulatory authority, be allowed to create human embryos and develop them in culture for about 14 days in order to investigate developmental potential of the induced germ cells. In the US, current federal laws and NIH guidelines only prohibit federal funding of research that results in the destruction or risk of damage to human embryos. Research that does not receive federal funding is not subject to that restriction. In contrast, several states enacted statutes that directly impact human embryo research. These statutes vary widely (National Conference of State Legislatures, 2008). The statutes in California, Connecticut, Illinois, Iowa, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, and New York generally encourage embryonic stem cell research, but with varying restrictions (Table S1). On the other hand, some states, such as Michigan and Louisiana, discourage or ban human embryo research including hESC research. Yet, except in some states with restrictive policies, US researchers with nonfederal funding may be allowed to create human embryos using induced germ cells for research, though perhaps after approval by both a local stem cell research oversight committee as well as an IRB. To our knowledge, Japan is the only jurisdiction with a special guideline on human germ cell induction from stem cells. In Japan, hESC guidelines were established by the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology (MEXT) in 2001. The guidelines banned germ cell induction research after considering potential ethical issues raised by the creation of an individual with the induced germ cells. In 2004, the Council for Science and Technology Policy adopted a basic policy, holding that in order to preserve human dignity, human embryo creation for research purposes is in principle not permitted. But, the policy contained two exceptions: research for improving or providing instruction in ART and hESC derivation from surplus embryos. For the purpose of ART, only gametes donated by infertility or gynecologic patients may currently be used. On November 30, 2007, Yamanaka and colleagues reported the generation of hiPSCs (Takahashi et al., 2007Takahashi K. Tanabe K. Ohnuki M. Narita M. Ichisaka T. Tomoda K. Yamanaka S. Cell. 2007; 131: 861-872Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14960) Google Scholar). One week later, on December 7, 2007, Yamanaka suggested that research on human germ cell induction should be temporarily restricted until MEXT established proper guidelines. The Ministry issued a notification informing research institutions of the temporary prohibition on germ cell induction from hiPSCs on February 21, 2008, just 3 months after the derivation of hiPSCs was reported. After this temporary prohibition, the MEXT Bioethics and Biosafety Committee continued to investigate the requirements that would permit the research. Following 1 year of discussion, the committee concluded that the ban on germ cell induction could be conditionally lifted considering major scientific and medical benefits, such as elucidation of gametogenesis, the pathologies of infertility, and congenital diseases. However, the ban on creating human embryos using germ cells induced from iPSCs continued, both because of the 2004 national basic policy banning human embryo creation for research purposes and because of the perception of technical barriers for obtaining mature and fertile germ cells from iPSCs or tissue stem cells at that time. In 2010, the Ministry formulated “Guidelines on Research into Producing Germ Cells from Human Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells or Human Tissue Stem Cells.” At about the same time, the Ministry revised the hESC utilization guidelines to allow germ cell induction from hESCs. The Japanese authorities thus acted quickly to respond to ethical concerns triggered by a scientific breakthrough, imposing a temporary ban and then lifting it, in part, within 2 years due to constructive discussions by researchers, policy makers, and the committee. The use of germ cells derived from pluripotent hESCs or iPSCs to create human embryos for research purposes is legal in some countries and not in others. Except for Japan, no country seems to have considered this issue directly. If human germ cells induced from pluripotent stem cells are to have an opportunity to be used in clinical applications, the creation of human embryos will be essential as a final functional assay. However, this functional assay should be limited in use as an exceptional assay to evaluate the developmental potential of induced germ cells in a preclinical stage. Countries will have to consider, or reconsider, their positions on creation of human embryos for research in light of this possible application. In doing so, some countries may want to consider whether, in terms of moral status, embryos created for research purposes from pluripotent stem-cell-derived germ cells are similar to or are different from other embryos. The main difference that we see of possible ethical significance is that embryos created from induced germ cells from hiPSCs would not require the process of gamete donation, which, for women, is unpleasant and risky. This difference, however, seems to be minor compared to the overall similarities given that all embryos have the potential to become human life. As a result, all the embryos created either for research or for reproductive purposes deserve equivalent moral respect. When we are able to generate germ cells from human pluripotent stem cells or somatic cells, people may benefit, both from making ART possible in cases where few or no eggs or sperm are produced and from improved understanding of and treatment for reproductive failure. Autologous production of germ cells from pluripotent stem cells might provide hope for patients who were never fertile or who lost their fertility from chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or other events but who wish to have a child that carries half of their genome. The creation of mature metaphase II oocytes from the patient’s own iPSCs might also provide a pool of oocytes for use in age-related oocyte senescence or to support a type of germline gene therapy that replaces mitochondrial DNA in human oocytes by spindle transfer for inherited mitochondrial diseases (reviewed in Trounson and Dewitt, 2013Trounson A. Dewitt N.D. Cell Stem Cell. 2013; 12: 636-638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Induced germ cells could also be useful in basic research and contribute further to unveiling pathways of human preimplantation development. This could lead to findings that improve IVF success rates by providing new culture techniques and improved cryopreservation methods. Conversely, adoption of this kind of technology without rigorous study could have adverse consequences. The most worrisome possibility is that children conceived from germ cells differentiated from pluripotent stem cells might suffer serious health impairments, at birth, later in childhood, or even in adulthood. Thalidomide and Diethylstilbestrol were powerful warnings about the possible dangers of insufficiently tested interventions early in embryonic development. In addition to issues of physical safety, the possible uses of human germ cells differentiated from pluripotent stem cells raise the possibility of perplexing new ethical, legal, and social issues. For example, posthumous conception using germ cells that are infinitely generated from iPSCs or somatic cells might produce unprecedented social concerns, as well as novel pedigree diagrams. Or if germ cells were frequently induced from a particular iPSC line, many siblings might be born in a region without knowing about their genetic relationships, potentially expanding an issue that may already be a problem with sperm donation. The technology could also be used to produce many embryos, allowing prospective parents to select their “best” embryo from scores of options, where their idea of “best” might be driven by many different ideas of the “best” genetic traits for a child, or even to create a “savior sibling” primarily to provide transplantation therapy for a relative. The clinical uses of induced germ cells would greatly expand the current issues that ART already confronts. Broad and open discussions with the general public as well as medical, scientific, and ethical experts will be essential. Furthermore, a different set of controversies might be raised if one could induce oocytes from XY (chromosomally male) cells or induce sperm from XX (chromosomally female) cells (The Hinxton Group, 2008), however remote this possibility may be. Researchers will have to justify such research to the public in terms of both scientific plausibility and medical benefits. Research on differentiation of germ cells from human iPSCs raises many ethical, legal, and social implications. Herein, we reconsider the regulations. A retrospective look at ART reveals a complicated history. Some technologies that were once considered controversial, such as intrauterine insemination and IVF, are now considered and accepted as mainstream, with an estimated 5 million births aided by IVF to date (Lomax and Trounson, 2013Lomax G.P. Trounson A.O. Nat. Biotechnol. 2013; 31: 288-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Human induced germ cells could aid even more people."
https://openalex.org/W2025796680,"Caveolae, submicroscopic bulb-shaped plasma membrane pits, are an abundant feature of many mammalian cells (Parton and del Pozo, 2013). Caveolae and the major proteins of caveolae, caveolins (Rothberg et al., 1992), and cavins (Hill et al., 2008), are linked to a number of human diseases such as muscular dystrophy, cardiomyopathy, and lipodys -trophy (see Glossary) (Bruno et al., 1993; Fernandez et al., 2006; Hayashi et al., 2009).As illustrated, caveolae show a striking tissue distribution with abundant caveolae in some cell types but an apparent absence from others. This is paralleled by highly variable expression of caveolins and cavins from tissue to tissue and the association of caveolar dysfunction with specific disease conditions (Allen et al., 2011; Bruno et al., 1993; Hansen et al., 2013; Hayashi et al., 2009).Caveolae are generated at the plasma membrane as caveolins and cavins come together to form the characteristic curved microdomain (Parton and del Pozo, 2013). They can bud from the plasma membrane, and the budded caveolae then fuse with early endosomes. The bulk of the caveolar components are then recycled back to the cell surface, but caveolae can also be disassembled and the components degraded after incorporation into the intralumenal vesicles of multivesicular late endosomal compartments (Parton and del Pozo, 2013). Caveolae at the plasma membrane can be flattened and their components dispersed in response to mechanical stress at the plasma membrane, allowing mechanoprotection or expansion of the plasma membrane (Sinha et al., 2011). Though the mechanism remains elusive, caveolae and caveolins are also known to regulate cellular signaling pathways (Garcia-Cardena et al., 1997) by direct or indirect means."

Significance: This is the first time adult human sarcomeric myosins have been isolated and characterized by transient kinetics. Human striated skeletal muscles are composed of fused multinucleated cells known as muscle fibers. Adult striated muscle fibers are classified as either slow/type I, fast/type II, or mixed, based on the type of metabolism (aerobic versus anaerobic), the maximum shortening velocity, and the contractile protein isoforms expressed (1Schiaffino S. Reggiani C. Fiber types in mammalian skeletal muscles.Physiol. Rev. 2011; 91: 1447-1531Crossref PubMed Scopus (1609) Google Scholar, 2Canepari M. Pellegrino M.A. D'Antona G. Bottinelli R. Skeletal muscle fibre diversity and the underlying mechanisms.Acta Physiol. (Oxf.). 2010; 199: 465-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Combinations of different fiber types cooperate to produce contractile activity tuned to the functional demands on the muscle. For example, muscles requiring rapid, short term contractile activity, such as the extensor digitorum longus, are composed almost entirely of fast/type II fibers, whereas slow postural muscles, such as the soleus, contain a large number of slow/type I fibers. Myosin is the motor protein that, together with actin, is responsible for the generation of force and movement by the muscle fiber. The isoform of myosin expressed in a muscle fiber therefore plays a central role in determining the contractile properties of muscle fibers. Specifically, the ATPase activity and maximum shortening velocity of a fiber are highly correlated with myosin isoform composition (3Bárány M. ATPase activity of myosin correlated with speed of muscle shortening.J. Gen. Physiol. 1967; 50: 197-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (1385) Google Scholar, 4Stienen G.J. Kiers J.L. Bottinelli R. Reggiani C.

Physiol. 1996; 495: 573-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). Skeletal muscle myosin consists of two heavy chains (MyHC) 6The abbreviations used are: MyHC, myosin heavy chain; LC, light chain; ELC, essential light chain; RLC, regulatory light chain; S1, myosin subfragment 1; EO, extra-ocular; eGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein. and two pairs of light chains: the regulatory light chains (RLC) and essential light chains (ELC). The C termini of the myosin heavy chains dimerize as a coiled coil (“myosin tail”), whereas the N termini form the two myosin “heads” or “motor domains.” A short neck joins the C-terminal tail of each MyHC to the motor domain, and each neck is stabilized by a pair of light chains (one ELC and one RLC). The motor domain of the MyHC imparts the primary contractile character to the muscle fiber, whereas the ELC and RLC play modulating roles. Adult human skeletal muscles express four distinct MyHCs, each encoded by a separate gene (6Weiss A. Leinwand L.A. The mammalian myosin heavy chain gene family.Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 417-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). The expression pattern is species-specific and is also regulated temporally and spatially. Slow/type I fibers predominantly express MyHC-I (known as MyHC-β when expressed in heart muscle). Fast/type II fibers in adult skeletal muscles express a mixture of the MyHC isoforms IIa and IId and, in a few specific muscles, the extraocular isoform (EO). MyHC-EO is thought to be a very fast isoform because of its expression only in uniquely rapid twitch fibers in the extraocular muscles and laryngeal muscles (7Sartore S. Mascarello F. Rowlerson A. Gorza L. Ausoni S. Vianello M. Schiaffino S. Fibre types in extraocular muscles. A new myosin isoform in the fast fibres.J. Muscle Res.

Spatial and temporal patterns of myosin heavy chain expression in developing rat extraocular muscle.J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1996; 17: 297-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). As far as we are aware, EO-MyHC has only been found in fibers expressing a mixture of myosin isoforms, and therefore no studies have been done using fibers containing only MyHC-EO (10Kjellgren D. Thornell L.-E. Andersen J. Pedrosa-Domellöf F. Myosin heavy chain isoforms in human extraocular muscles.Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2003; 44: 1419-1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). A fifth isoform MyHC-IIb, which is the predominant myosin in the fast skeletal fibers of rodents, is not expressed in healthy human muscles; however, the gene is present and encodes a functional motor (11Resnicow D.I. Deacon J.C. Warrick H.M. Spudich J.A. Leinwand L.A. Functional diversity among a family of human skeletal muscle myosin motors.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 1053-1058Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), and its RNA is detectable in the muscles of patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (12Harrison B.C. Allen D.L. Leinwand L.A. IIb or not IIb? Regulation of myosin heavy chain gene expression in mice and men.Skeletal Muscle. 2011; 1: 5Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Among the MyHC isoforms most abundantly expressed in mammalian adult fast skeletal muscle (IIa, IId, and IIb), sequence identity is very high, between 91 and 95%. The specialized MyHC-EO shares only 81–82% identity with IIa, IIb, and IId, whereas the MyHC-β is 81 and 71% identical to the fast muscle isoforms and MyHC-EO, respectively (13Weiss A. Schiaffino S. Leinwand L.A. Comparative sequence analysis of the complete human sarcomeric myosin heavy chain family. Implications for functional diversity.J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 290: 61-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). These differences are relatively small, holding out the prospect that it may be possible to correlate the differences in properties of the MyHC isoforms with specific changes in sequence. This does, however, require access to preparations of pure MyHC isoforms. In the adult skeletal muscle of mammals, ∼80% of individual muscle fibers express a single myosin isoform. Thus it has been possible to define the contractile characteristics of muscle fibers expressing a homogeneous MyHC (14Pellegrino M.A. Canepari M. Rossi R. D'Antona G. Reggiani C. Bottinelli R. Orthologous myosin isoforms and scaling of shortening velocity with body size in mouse, rat, rabbit and human muscles.J. Physiol. 2003; 546: 677-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Studies using single muscle fibers have shown that the MyHC present does define the maximum velocity of shortening of both fibers and in vitro motility assays (5Bottinelli R. Canepari M. Pellegrino M.A. Reggiani C. Force-velocity properties of human skeletal muscle fibres. Myosin heavy chain isoform and temperature dependence.J.

Orthologous myosin isoforms and scaling of shortening velocity with body size in mouse, rat, rabbit and human muscles.J. Physiol. 2003; 546: 677-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). However, detailed biochemical kinetics of a homogeneous myosin isoform has been limited by the very small quantities of myosin that can be prepared from individually characterized muscle fibers (15Nyitrai M. Rossi R. Adamek N. Pellegrino M.A. Bottinelli R. Geeves M.A. What limits the velocity of fast-skeletal muscle contraction in mammals?.J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 355: 432-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Until relatively recently, it was not possible to either separate MyHCs from mixtures or express individual recombinant conventional striated muscle myosin. This restriction resulted in the fact that we have limited information about the biochemical properties of individual mammalian striated muscle myosins and even less information about most human muscle isoforms. Although there is some information about the kinetic properties of cardiac and fast skeletal myosins, there is no kinetic information about the human EO and IIb proteins apart from our recent steady-state studies (11Resnicow D.I. Deacon J.C. Warrick H.M. Spudich J.A. Leinwand L.A. Functional diversity among a family of human skeletal muscle myosin motors.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

More recently, we developed this mammalian muscle cell expression system further to produce active human MyHC motor domains with associated light chains (11Resnicow D.I. Deacon J.C. Warrick H.M.

Identification of functional differences between recombinant human α and β cardiac myosin motors.Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2012; 69: 2261-2277Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). We refer to these constructs as MyHC-S1, analogous to subfragment 1 prepared from muscle tissue. In our previous work using recombinant S1 proteins produced with this expression system, the ATPase and in vitro motility properties of the individual human skeletal muscle MyHC isoforms were shown to be distinct (11Resnicow D.I. Deacon J.C. Warrick H.M. Spudich J.A. Leinwand L.A. Functional diversity among a family of human skeletal muscle myosin motors.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 1053-1058Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In this study, we use the same constructs to complete a more thorough biochemical kinetic characterization of the MyHCs and correlate the properties of each MyHC with the differences in motor domain sequence. Transient kinetics measurements define the rate and equilibrium of various steps in the cross-bridge cycle (Schemes 1 and 2). We have used the three recombinant human adult fast skeletal MyHC isoforms, IIa, IId, and IIb, as well as the specialized MyHC-EO. We contrast the new data collected here with our previous data on the human cardiac α and β (skeletal isoform I) isoforms (18Deacon J.C. Bloemink M.J. Rezavandi H. Geeves M.A. Leinwand L.A. Identification of functional differences between recombinant human α and β cardiac myosin motors.Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2012; 69: 2261-2277Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The results show that EO has very fast kinetics and is quite distinct from the other three fast muscle isoforms. All four isoforms are distinct from the slow muscle MyHC-I (β-cardiac isoform), whereas the α-cardiac isoform shares many kinetic properties with the fast muscle isoforms, although it has a distinct sequence. Of note also is that the IIb isoform is a functional protein but does not appear to be similar to IIb from small mammals despite high sequence similarity.SCHEME. 2The interaction of S1 with actin, ATP and ADP. S1, actin, ATP, and ADP are represented as M, A, T, and D, respectively. Dashed (-) interactions represent a weakly bound complex, and dotted (·) interactions represent strongly bound states. Cross-bridge detachment from the rigor state (A·M) involves the complex binding ATP, governed by the association constant, K′1, followed by the rate-limiting isomerization, k′+2, after which actin-myosin affinity becomes weak, and the complex separates rapidly (22Millar N.C.

Deacon J.C. Warrick H.M. Spudich J.A. Leinwand L.A. Functional diversity among a family of human skeletal muscle myosin motors.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 1053-1058Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Briefly, active recombinant human skeletal muscle MyHC-S1 (residues Met-1 to Pro-843) was expressed in the C2C12 myoblast cell line (transformed murine muscle cell precursors) following differentiation of C2C12 cells in culture into functional myotubes. Replication incompetent recombinant adenoviruses were produced using the AdEasy system (Qbiogene) containing expression cassettes encoding S1 of the human skeletal myosins, with a C-terminally fused enhanced GFP (eGFP) and His6 tag, under the transcriptional control of a CMV promoter. These adenoviruses were used to infect C2C12 myotubes in culture and resulted in overexpression of recombinant myosin proteins. S1-eGFP-His6 proteins were purified in three steps. Infected C2C12 cells were lysed using a Dounce homogenizer in low salt lysis buffer to precipitate endogenous, full-length C2C12 myosins. Lysates were clarified by centrifugation then subjected to nickel affinity chromatography. Eluates were dialyzed into low salt buffer and then subjected to anion exchange chromatography by FPLC. We isolated proteins from ∼1500 to 3000 cm2 of cultured C2C12 cells per preparation, yielding up to ∼1 mg of purified MyHC per preparation at up to ∼10 μm final concentration. As reported by Resnicow et al. (11Resnicow D.I. Deacon J.C. Warrick H.M. Spudich J.A. Leinwand L.A. Functional diversity among a family of human skeletal muscle myosin motors.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 1053-1058Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), the S1 proteins purified by this method are isolated in complex with the mouse ELC and RLC proteins present in the C2C12 cells except the MyHC-EO, which has no light chains present. SDS-PAGE from protein preparations were similar to those of Resnicow et al. (11Resnicow D.I. Deacon J.C. Warrick H.M. Spudich J.A. Leinwand L.A. Functional diversity among a family of human skeletal muscle myosin motors.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 1053-1058Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), and typical gels are shown in the supplemental materials. These gels show the presence of three LC bands previously identified as a combination of mouse light chains 1, 2, and 3 plus the atrial/fetal light chain. The ratio of ELC to RLC was always close to 1:1 (see supplemental Table 1 for details). Rabbit skeletal muscle actin was prepared according to methods described previously (19Pardee J.D. Spudich J.A. Purification of muscle actin.Methods Enzymol. 1982; 85: 164-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (980) Google Scholar) and labeled with pyrene at Cys-374 (20Criddle A.H. Geeves M.A. Jeffries T. The use of actin labelled with N-(1-pyrenyl)iodoacetamide to study the interaction of actin with myosin subfragments and troponin/tropomyosin.Biochem. J. 1985; 232: 343-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). All kinetic experiments were performed at 20 °C in 20 mm MOPS buffer, pH 7.0, with 100 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm azide, unless indicated otherwise. Measurements were performed with a High-Tech Scientific SF-61 DX2 stopped flow system. Pyrene-actin fluorescence was excited at 365 nm, and emission was detected after passing through a KV389-nm cut-off filter (Schott, Mainz, Germany). A Kodak 47B filter was used in combination with the KV389 filter to avoid interference of the eGFP fluorescence with the pyrene fluorescence signal. Tryptophan fluorescence was excited at 295 nm and observed through a WG320 filter. The stated concentrations of reactants are those after mixing in the stopped flow observation cell, unless otherwise specified. Stopped flow data were analyzed using the software provided by TgK Scientific (Kinetic Studio), as well as with Origin (Microcal). Without actin present, the kinetics of MyHC-S1 with ATP (T) or ADP (D) were interpreted based on the seven-step model described by Bagshaw et al. (21Bagshaw C.R. Eccleston J.F. Eckstein F. Goody R.S. Gutfreund H. Trentham D.R. The magnesium ion-dependent adenosine triphosphatase of myosin. Two-step processes of adenosine triphosphate association and adenosine diphosphate dissociation.Biochem. J. 1974; 141: 351-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar), where k+i and k−i are the forward and reverse rate constants, and Ki (= k+i/k−i) represents the equilibrium constant of the ith step of the reaction (Scheme 1). In the presence of actin, the kinetics of the interaction of S1 with ATP or ADP were analyzed based on the model previously developed for myosin (22Millar N.C. Geeves M.A. The limiting rate of the ATP-mediated dissociation of actin from rabbit skeletal muscle myosin subfragment 1.FEBS Lett. 1983; 160: 141-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 23Siemankowski R.F. Wiseman M.O. White H.D. ADP dissociation from actomyosin subfragment 1 is sufficiently slow to limit the unloaded shortening velocity in vertebrate muscle.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1985; 82: 658-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). As shown in Scheme 2, ATP binds rapidly and reversibly to actin-myosin, followed by a rate-limiting isomerization (k′+2) of the complex, which leads to rapid dissociation of actin. ADP competes with ATP for the nucleotide-binding site, and its binding to actin-myosin is governed by the dissociation constant, KAD (= k−AD/k+AD). Pyrene-actin fluorescence is quenched in the pyrene-actin-S1 complex. Therefore, an increase in fluorescence intensity can be observed as a result of pyrene-actin dissociation from S1. The dissociation reaction can be induced by the addition of ATP to the pyrene-actin-S1 complex, and resulting fluorescence transients can be analyzed to define the kinetics of the reaction. Equation 1 was derived from the interaction of actin·S1 with ATP (Scheme 2) and was used to analyze ATP-induced actin·S1 dissociation to determine the constants, K′1k′+2, k′+2, and 1/K′1. kobs=K′1k′+2[ATP]/(1+K′1[ATP])(Eq. 1) Equation 2 was derived from the interaction of actin·S1 with ATP and ADP (Scheme 2) and assumes that ADP is in rapid competition with ATP for binding to AM and K′1[ATP] < 1, such that the equation is linear with respect to [ATP]. The equation was used to analyze the data for ATP induced dissociation of actin from the complex in the presence of ADP. kobs=K′1k′+2[ATP]/1+[ADP]/KAD(Eq. 2) If the kobs in the absence of ADP is ko, then Equation 2 can be normalized to make comparison of different myosin isoforms easier. krel=kobs/ko=1/(1+ADP]/KAD(Eq. 3) The two amplitudes observed in the ADP displacement from S1 are proportional to the concentration of the S1 present as free S1 or S1·ADP. The amplitudes depend on the total ADP concentration as defined as follows: Aslow=(Amax[ADP])/(K6K7+[ADP])+Amin(Eq. 4) Afast=(AmaxK6K7)/([ADP]+K6K7)+Amin(Eq. 5) In all cases, the data in the figures refer to individual experimental measurements, whereas Table 1 gives the mean values of the fitted constant for two to three separate measurements using different protein preparations.TABLE 1Transient kinetic parameters measured for EO, IIa, IIb, and IId myosin S1 isoformsEO-S1IIa-S1IIb-S1IId-S1β-S1β-S1aHuman α- and β-S1 without the eGFP tag.

Open table in a new tab Three-dimensional homology models were generated for the human skeletal myosin isoforms IIa, IIb, IId, and EO using the SWISS-MODEL automatic comparative protein modeling server (24Schwede T.

Kopp J. Schwede T. The SWISS-MODEL workspace. A web-based environment for protein structure homology modelling.Bioinformatics. 2006; 22: 195-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (6033) Google Scholar). The primary sequences of the human isoforms were pairwise aligned with the sequence of three scallop myosin head structures as templates (Protein Data Bank codes 1kk8, 1qvi, and 1sr6) using the CLUSTALW alignment protocol. The alignments were submitted to the alignment interface of SWISS-MODEL, and the generated models were validated using WHAT CHECK (26Hooft R.W. Vriend G. Sander C. Abola E.E. Errors in protein structures.Nature. 1996; 381: 272Crossref PubMed Scopus (1805) Google Scholar). A sequence identity of 60% (±0.5%) was found when aligning the human skeletal myosin head sequences with class II scallop myosin, allowing us to build well resolved homology models (27Miller B.M. Bloemink M.J. Nyitrai M. Bernstein S.I. Geeves M.A. A variable domain near the ATP-binding site in Drosophila muscle myosin is part of the communication pathway between the nucleotide and actin-binding sites.J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 368: 1051-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The scallop myosin structures used as templates were chosen because they represent various conformational states of myosin during the cross-bridge cycle: the post-power stroke state containing ADP-BeFx in the nucleotide pocket (Protein Data Bank code 1kk8), the pre-power stroke state containing ADP-VO4 (Protein Data Bank code 1qvi), and one scallop myosin structure without a nucleotide in the binding pocket (Protein Data Bank code 1sr6) representing the near rigor state of myosin. ATP binding to actin·S1 was determined for each myosin isoform using rapid mixing in a stopped flow apparatus. The ATP-induced dissociation of actin·S1 complexes was followed by monitoring the fluorescence of a pyrene label covalently attached to Cys-373 of actin. Fig. 1A shows an example of the pyrene fluorescence changes observed upon mixing 0.25 μm pyrene-labeled actin·EO-S1 with 5 μm ATP at 20 °C. The signal was fitted using a single exponential equation resulting in kobs = 12.4 s−1 and amplitude = +36%. Varying the ATP concentration and plotting kobs as a function of ATP concentration (range, 2.5–40 μm) results in a linear relationship between kobs and allowed the determination of the second order rate constant of ATP binding to actin·S1 (K′1k′+2, = 3.5 ± 0.2 μm−1 s−1 see Fig. 1B). Over a wider concentration range, the relation between kobs and [ATP] was described by a hyperbola as predicted in Equation 1 (see Fig. 1C). Fitting the EO data yielded, a maximum rate constant of ATP induced dissociation k′+2 = 1152 ± 60 s−1 and an apparent ATP affinity for AM (1/K′1 = 318 μm). The same method was used to measure the"
https://openalex.org/W2012750167,"Aberrant AKT activation is prevalent across multiple human cancer lineages providing an important new target for therapy. Twenty-two independent phosphorylation sites have been identified on specific AKT isoforms likely contributing to differential isoform regulation. However, the mechanisms regulating phosphorylation of individual AKT isoform molecules have not been elucidated because of the lack of robust approaches able to assess phosphorylation of multiple sites on a single AKT molecule. Using a nanofluidic proteomic immunoassay (NIA), consisting of isoelectric focusing followed by sensitive chemiluminescence detection, we demonstrate that under basal and ligand-induced conditions that the pattern of phosphorylation events is markedly different between AKT1 and AKT2. Indeed, there are at least 12 AKT1 peaks and at least 5 AKT2 peaks consistent with complex combinations of phosphorylation of different sites on individual AKT molecules. Following insulin stimulation, AKT1 was phosphorylated at Thr308 in the T-loop and Ser473 in the hydrophobic domain. In contrast, AKT2 was only phosphorylated at the equivalent sites (Thr309 and Ser474) at low levels. Further, Thr308 and Ser473 phosphorylation occurred predominantly on the same AKT1 molecules, whereas Thr309 and Ser474 were phosphorylated primarily on different AKT2 molecules. Although basal AKT2 phosphorylation was sensitive to inhibition of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), basal AKT1 phosphorylation was essentially resistant. PI3K inhibition decreased pThr451 on AKT2 but not pThr450 on AKT1. Thus, NIA technology provides an ability to characterize coordinate phosphorylation of individual AKT molecules providing important information about AKT isoform-specific phosphorylation, which is required for optimal development and implementation of drugs targeting aberrant AKT activation."
https://openalex.org/W2077410318,"Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is usually incurable. Contrary to genetic mechanisms involved in PDAC pathogenesis, epigenetic alterations are ill defined. Here, we determine the contribution of epigenetically silenced genes to the development of PDAC. We analyzed enriched, highly methylated DNAs from PDACs, chronic pancreatitis (CP) and normal tissues using CpG island microarrays and identified WNK2 as a prominent candidate tumor suppressor gene being downregulated early in PDAC development. WNK2 was further investigated in tissue microarrays, methylation analysis of early pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN), mouse models for PDAC and pancreatitis, re-expression studies after demethylation, and cell growth assays using WNK2 overexpression. Demethylation assays confirmed the link between methylation and expression. WNK2 hypermethylation was higher in tumor than in surrounding inflamed tissues and was observed in PanIN lesions as well as in a PDAC mouse model. WNK2 mRNA and protein expressions were lower in PDAC and CP compared with normal tissues both in patients and mouse models. Overexpression of WNK2 led to reduced cell growth, and WNK2 expression in tissues correlated negatively with pERK1/2 expression, a downstream target of WNK2 responsible for cell proliferation. Downregulation of WNK2 by promoter hypermethylation occurs early in PDAC pathogenesis and may support tumor cell growth via the ERK–MAPK pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2090403556,"Numerous Gram-negative bacterial pathogens use type III secretion systems to deliver effector molecules into the cytoplasm of a host cell. Many of these effectors have evolved to manipulate the host ubiquitin system to alter host cell physiology or the location, stability, or function of the effector itself. ExoU is a potent A2 phospholipase used by Pseudomonas aeruginosa to destroy membranes of infected cells. The enzyme is held in an inactive state inside of the bacterium due to the absence of a required eukaryotic activator, which was recently identified as ubiquitin. This study sought to identify the region of ExoU required to mediate this interaction and determine the properties of ubiquitin important for binding, ExoU activation, or both. Biochemical and biophysical approaches were used to map the ubiquitin-binding domain to a C-terminal four-helix bundle of ExoU. The hydrophobic patch of ubiquitin is required for full binding affinity and activation. Binding and activation were uncoupled by introducing an L8R substitution in ubiquitin. Purified L8R demonstrated a parental binding phenotype to ExoU but did not activate the phospholipase in vitro. Utilizing these new biochemical data and intermolecular distance measurements by double electron-electron resonance, we propose a model for an ExoU-monoubiquitin complex."

Understanding how FKBPL levels are controlled within the cell is therefore critical. We have identified a novel role for RBCK1 as an FKBPL-interacting protein, which regulates FKBPL stability at the post-translational level via ubiquitination. Both RBCK1 and FKBPL are upregulated by 17-β-estradiol and interact within heat shock protein 90 chaperone complexes, together with estrogen receptor-α (ERα). Furthermore, FKBPL and RBCK1 associate with ERα at the promoter of the estrogen responsive gene, pS2, and regulate pS2 levels. MCF-7 clones stably overexpressing RBCK1 were shown to have reduced proliferation and increased levels of FKBPL and p21. Furthermore, these clones were resistant to tamoxifen therapy, suggesting that RBCK1 could be a predictive marker of response to endocrine therapy. RBCK1 knockdown using targeted small interfering RNA resulted in increased proliferation and increased sensitivity to tamoxifen treatment. Moreover, in support of our in vitro data, analysis of mRNA microarray data sets demonstrated that high levels of FKBPL and RBCK1 correlated with increased patient survival, whereas high RBCK1 predicted for a poor response to tamoxifen. Our findings support a role for RBCK1 in the regulation of FKBPL with important implications for estrogen receptor signaling, cell proliferation and response to endocrine therapy."
https://openalex.org/W1975051088,"Paclitaxel has been extensively used as an antitumor drug to treat a broad range of epithelial cancers, including breast and cervical cancers. However, the efficacy of this drug is greatly limited by the development of acquired resistance. Identification of the underlying resistance mechanisms may inform the development of new therapies that elicit long-term response of tumors to paclitaxel treatment. Here we report that increased expression of TNFAIP1 (tumor necrosis factor alpha-induced protein 1) confers acquired resistance to paclitaxel. TNFAIP1 is shown to compete with paclitaxel for binding to β-tubulin, thereby preventing paclitaxel-induced tubulin polymerization, cell cycle arrest and ultimate cell death. We also show that expression of TNFAIP1 is regulated by the transcriptional factor Sp1. In a xenograft mouse model, increased expression of TNFAIP1 decreases, whereas knockdown of TNFAIP1 increases tumor response to paclitaxel. Therefore, these results reveal tnfaip1 as a novel paclitaxel-resistance associated gene and suggest that TNFAIP1 may represent a valuable therapeutic target for the treatment of cancer."

Poliovirus 3AB is a 109-amino acid protein with a natively unstructured N-terminal domain. HeLa cells transduced with 3AB protein displayed intracellular membrane disruption; specifically, the formation of cytoplasmic invaginations.

Farnesyl diphosphate (FPP) 5The abbreviations used are: FPP, farnesyl diphosphate; GGPP, geranylgeranyl diphosphate; GPP, geranyl diphosphate; FOH, farnesol; AGOH, anilinogeraniol; GGOH, geranylgeraniol; DMSO, dimethyl sulfoxide; AGPP, anilinogeraniol diphosphate; AFPP, anilinofarnesol diphosphate; AG-Cys, anilinogeranylcysteine; AF-Cys, anilinofarnesylcysteine; F-Cys, farnesylcysteine; GG-Cys, geranylgeranylcysteine; AFOH, anilinofarnesol. and geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGPP) are isoprenoid diphosphate intermediates in the mevalonate pathway. FPP and GGPP are formed by head-to-tail condensation of five-carbon isoprene units from isopentenyl diphosphate and dimethylallyl diphosphate to form geranyl diphosphate (GPP). Subsequent steps involve sequential conjugation of the isopentenyl group of isopentenyl diphosphate with GPP to form the 15-carbon FPP and the 20-carbon GGPP, respectively. FPP and GGPP are substrates for protein prenyltransferases that catalyze post-translational isoprenylation of cysteine residues at the C termini of a wide variety of proteins. Condensation of two molecules of FPP by squalene synthase initiates the formation of mevalonate pathway end products that include cholesterol, numerous steroid hormones, coenzyme Q10, and dolichol (1Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Regulation of the mevalonate pathway.Nature. 1990; 343: 425-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (4537) Google Scholar). The mevalonate pathway produces FPP and GGPP without making the corresponding isoprenols. However, many cells can incorporate an exogenously provided unnatural analog of farnesol (FOH), anilinogeraniol (AGOH), into a diphosphate derivative that can then serve as a substrate for protein isoprenylation (2Miriyala S.

Studies using radiolabeled FOH and geranylgeraniol (GGOH) suggest that these naturally occurring isoprenols are substrates for the same pathway (Fig. 1) (7Fliesler S.J. Keller R.K.

The relative efficiency and biochemical relationship of this “isoprenol-dependent,” “scavenging,” or “recycling” pathway to the much better characterized mevalonate pathway are not known. This information could be of fundamental importance to understanding the efficacy and side effects associated with pharmacological inhibition of the rate-limiting enzyme of the mevalonate pathway, HMG-CoA reductase, which is a widely used clinical strategy for treatment of hypercholesterolemia and protection from coronary artery disease but may also have benefits in other settings (10Thurnher M. Nussbaumer O. Gruenbacher G. Novel aspects of mevalonate pathway inhibitors as antitumor agents.Clin. Cancer Res. 2012; 18: 3524-3531Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). By depleting FPP and GGPP, statins also inhibit protein isoprenylation and synthesis of other mevalonate pathway end products. Inhibition of isoprenylation of Ras and Rho family small GTPases by statins results in decreases in cell proliferation and migration, which may underlie the beneficial effects of statins observed in cancer and cardiovascular disease that are independent of their cholesterol-lowering actions (11Zhou Q. Liao J.K. Pleiotropic effects of statins. Basic research and clinical perspectives.Circ. J. 2010; 74: 818-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). Mevalonate pathway inhibition also results in idiopathic side effects such as rhabdomyolysis (12Buettner C. Lecker S.H. Molecular basis for statin-induced muscle toxicity: implications and possibilities.Pharmacogenomics. 2008; 9: 1133-1142Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), which may involve decreased production of other mevalonate pathway end products such as coenzyme Q10. Statins are of possible benefit in treatment of some cancers (Ref. 13Nielsen S.F. Nordestgaard B.G. Bojesen S.E. Statin use and reduced cancer-related mortality.N. Engl. J. Med. 2012; 367: 1792-1802Crossref PubMed Scopus (711) Google Scholar; but see Ref. 14Nielsen S.F. Nordestgaard B.G. Bojesen S.E. Cancer patients should not be treated with statins. Reply.Ugeskr. Laeger. 2013; 175: 76PubMed Google Scholar), and up-regulation of the mevalonate pathway in breast cancer cells harboring gain-of-function mutations in the p53 tumor suppressor promotes an invasive phenotype that can be reversed by statin treatment (15Freed-Pastor W.A. Mizuno H. Zhao X. Langerød A. Moon S.H. Rodriguez-Barrueco R. Barsotti A. Chicas A. Li W. Polotskaia A. Bissell M.J. Osborne T.F. Tian B. Lowe S.W. Silva J.M. Børresen-Dale A.L. Levine A.J.

We used tandem mass spectrometry to explore the metabolism of exogenously supplied isoprenols by MDA-MB-231 cells and other human cancer cell lines and, for the first time, quantitatively compared the efficiency with which exogenous isoprenols can supply substrates for protein prenyltransferases to those generated endogenously by the mevalonate pathway. We show that, in some cases, exogenous isoprenols can serve as a significant source of isoprenoid phosphate substrates for protein isoprenylation. Surprisingly, metabolism of exogenous isoprenols is up-regulated as result of p53 silencing or mevalonate pathway inhibition in breast cancer cells, indicating that this process is regulated independently of components of the mevalonate pathway that are controlled by p53 or inhibited by statins. These results have broader implications for understanding the efficacy, side effects, and biological consequences of mevalonate pathway inhibition.

For metabolic labeling experiments, cells were treated with various concentrations of isoprenols as described previously for analysis of AGOH incorporation into proteins (2Miriyala S. Subramanian T.

For studies of the effects of statins, cells were cultured in the presence or absence of GGOH-d6 for 6 days with supplementation on day 3 with concurrent treatment with vehicle or mevinolin at concentrations of 1–25 μm. Stably transfected MDA-MB-231 clonal cell lines with inducible p53-targeting engineered microRNAs were cultured in the presence or absence of doxycycline to induce p53 silencing as described (15Freed-Pastor W.A.

Extraction of isoprenoid diphosphates was accomplished using the method previously described (19Tong H. Holstein S.A. Hohl R.J. Simultaneous determination of farnesyl and geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate levels in cultured cells.Anal. Biochem. 2005; 336: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) with modifications as noted below. Cells cultured to confluence in the presence of vehicle control (0.03% DMSO) or vehicle containing isoprenols were washed once with PBS and lifted using trypsin/EDTA into 15-ml polypropylene tubes. Cells were washed once with ice-cold PBS and pelleted by centrifugation at 4 °C for 10 min at 20,000 × g. The cell pellet was resuspended in 1.2 ml of ice-cold freshly prepared extraction solvent (1:1.5:5 isopropyl alcohol, 75 mm ammonium hydroxide, and acetone) containing 1.0% octyl β-d-glucopyranoside. Anilinogeraniol diphosphate (AGPP)-d5 or anilinofarnesol diphosphate (AFPP)-d5 (500 pmol) was added as a recovery standard and for quantitation of all isoprenoid diphosphates recovered from cells. The mixture was vortexed for 5 min, sonicated in a water bath containing ice for 5 min, and then centrifuged for 5 min at 20,000 × g to precipitate proteins. The supernatant was transferred to a new tube, and the protein pellet was re-extracted with 1.5 ml of extraction solvent and centrifuged for 5 min at 20,000 × g. The supernatants were combined and evaporated to dryness under a stream of nitrogen. The residue was resuspended in 100 μl of 25 mm ammonium hydroxide containing 1.0% octyl β-d-glucopyranoside, vortexed, and transferred to a polypropylene autosampler vial for HPLC-MS/MS analysis. FOH and GGOH were extracted from serum or human plasma using acetonitrile to precipitate plasma proteins with 500 pmol of FOH-d6 and GGOH-d6 as internal standards. LC-MS/MS analyses of isoprenoid phosphates were performed using an AB SCIEX 4000 QTRAP hybrid triple quadrupole/linear ion trap mass spectrometer in multiple reaction monitoring mode. Isoprenoid phosphates were separated using a Macherey-Nagel NUCLEODUR C8 gravity column (5 μm, 125 × 2 mm). The mobile phase consisted of 25 mm ammonium acetate with 0.1% triethylamine as solvent A and acetonitrile and 25 mm ammonium acetate (4:1) with 0.1% triethylamine as solvent B. Separation was achieved using a linear gradient of 0–100% solvent B over 10 min. The flow rate was 0.5 ml/min with a column temperature of 30 °C (2Miriyala S. Subramanian T. Panchatcharam M. Ren H. McDermott M.I. Sunkara M. Drennan T. Smyth S.S. Spielmann H.P. Morris A.J. Functional characterization of the atypical integral membrane lipid phosphatase PDP1/PPAPDC2 identifies a pathway for interconversion of isoprenols and isoprenoid phosphates in mammalian cells.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 13918-13929Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The sample injection volume was 10 μl. Unless noted otherwise, the mass spectrometer was operated in negative electrospray ionization mode. Optimal ion source settings determined by infusion of synthetic standards were a declustering potential of −70 V, entrance potential of 10 V, collision energy of −54 V, collision cell exit potential of −1 V, curtain gas of 20 p.s.i., ion spray voltage of −4500 V, ion source gas of 40 p.s.i., and temperature of 550 °C. Multiple reaction monitoring transitions were as follows: FPP-d6, m/z 387.6/78.8 and 387.3/158.5; GGPP-d6, m/z 455.9/78.8 and 455.9/158.6; AGPP, m/z 403.9/78.9 and 403.9/158.6; AFPP, m/z 472.8/79.0 and 472.8/158.4; AGPP-d5, m/z 408.9/78.9 and 408.9/158.6; GGPP, m/z 449/78.8 and 449/158.7; FPP, m/z 381/79 and 381/159; GPP, m/z 312.7/79 and 312.7/158.7; geranylgeranyl phosphate, m/z 369/79; geranyl phosphate, m/z 233/79; and anilinogeraniol phosphate, m/z 323.9/78.9. AGPP was also detected in positive mode with instrument-optimized ion source settings by monitoring transitions m/z 406/228, 406/193, and 406/107. Peak identification and integration were accomplished using AB SCIEX Analyst software. When necessary, calibration was accomplished by reference to standard curves obtained using material that was independently quantitated by digestion and phosphorus determination. Isoprenoid diphosphates were quantitated by stable isotope dilution using AGPP-d5 or AFPP-d5 as the internal standard. Isoprenols were measured using the chromatography method noted below for prenylcysteines by monitoring the following ion pairs: 205.3/81 and 205.3/121 for FOH, 211.2/81 and 211.3/121.6 for FOH-d6, 273.2/81 and 273.121.6 for GGOH, and 279.3/81.2 and 279.3/122.2 for GGOH-d6. The isoprenoid diphosphate assays have a lower limit of detection of 0.1 pmol and were linear up to column loadings of 100 pmol. Prenylcysteines were prepared from protein pellets obtained after extraction of isoprenoid diphosphates from labeled cells. The protein fractions were resuspended in 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.4) and 2 mm calcium acetate in a bath sonicator. Small aliquots of the resuspended sample were used for protein concentration estimation by BCA. Known quantities of labeled proteins were digested by overnight incubation with Pronase E (10 mg) at 37 °C. Proteolysis was terminated by the addition of 2 ml of water-saturated n-butyl alcohol, anilinogeranylcysteine (AG-Cys)-d5, and anilinofarnesylcysteine (AF-Cys)-d5 (50 pmol) added as a standard or for quantitation of the prenylcysteines, and the mixture was centrifuged at 1500 × g for 10 min to produce two phases. The upper phase was harvested into a new tube, whereas the lower phase was re-extracted with 2 ml of water-saturated n-butyl alcohol. After centrifugation for 10 min at 1500 × g, the upper phase was harvested and pooled together into the new tube. The n-butyl alcohol was evaporated under a stream of nitrogen to dryness; the residue was redissolved in 100 μl of chloroform/methanol/water (10:10:3) and centrifuged in a microcentrifuge at full speed for 10 min to remove any particulate material; and the supernatant was transferred to a polypropylene autosampler vial for HPLC-MS/MS analysis. Analyses of prenylcysteines were carried out using a Shimadzu ultra fast liquid chromatograph coupled with an AB SCIEX 4000-QTRAP hybrid triple quadrupole/linear ion trap mass spectrometer in multiple reaction monitoring mode. Prenylcysteines were analyzed using the Macherey-Nagel NUCLEODUR C8 gravity column. The mobile phase consisted of 0.1% TFA with water as solvent A and 0.1% TFA with acetonitrile as solvent B. For the analyses of prenylcysteines, the separation was achieved using a gradient of 10–100% solvent B for 8 min and maintained at 100% solvent B for the last 2 min. The column was equilibrated back to the initial conditions over 3 min. The flow rate was 0.5 ml/min with a column temperature of 30 °C. The sample injection volume was 10 μl. The mass spectrometer was operated in the positive electrospray ionization mode with optimal ion source settings determined by synthetic standards of prenylcysteines with a declustering potential of 56 V, entrance potential of 10 V, collision energy of 25 V, collision cell exit potential of 4 V, curtain gas of 20 p.s.i., ion spray voltage of 5500 V, ion source gas 1/gas 2 of 40 p.s.i., and temperature of 550 °C. Multiple reaction monitoring transitions were as follows: m/z 349.2/135.1 and 349.2/228.1 for AG-Cys; m/z 326.3/95 and 326.3/81.3 for farnesylcysteine (F-Cys); m/z 394.3/122.2 and 394.3/81 for geranylgeranylcysteine (GG-Cys); m/z 417.3/203.1 and 417.3/93.1 for AF-Cys; m/z 354.3/107.1 and 354.3/135.1 for AG-Cys-d5; m/z 422.3/203.1 and 422.3/81.1 for AF-Cys-d5; m/z 332.3/95 and 332.3/81.3 for F-Cys-d6; and m/z 400.3/149.3, 400.3/122.2, and 400.3/81 for GG-Cys-d6. Calibration was accomplished by reference to standard curves obtained using known quantities of synthetic prenylcysteine standards. These assays were linear up to column loadings of 100 pmol and had detection limits of 0.01 pmol. FPP, GGPP, aniline-containing analogs, and deuterium-labeled variants of these compounds and their corresponding isoprenols shown in Fig. 2 were synthesized as described under “Experimental Procedures” and analyzed by electrospray ionization HPLC-MS/MS with quantitation accomplished by stable isotope dilution (Fig. 3, A and B, and supplemental Figs. S1 and S2). Incubation of MDA-MB-231 cells with exogenously supplied FOH-d6 resulted in formation of FPP-d6 and GGPP-d6 (Fig. 3C). The synthetic isoprenol AGOH has been widely used as a probe to monitor protein isoprenylation in live cells by Western blotting using antibodies that recognize the aniline moiety (6Troutman J.M. Roberts M.J. Andres D.A. Spielmann H.P. Tools to analyze protein farnesylation in cells.Bioconjug. Chem. 2005; 16: 1209-1217Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). As previously reported in other cell types (2Miriyala S. Subramanian T. Panchatcharam M. Ren H. McDermott M.I. Sunkara M. Drennan T. Smyth S.S. Spielmann H.P. Morris A.J. Functional characterization of the atypical integral membrane lipid phosphatase PDP1/PPAPDC2 identifies a pathway for interconversion of isoprenols and isoprenoid phosphates in mammalian cells.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 13918-13929Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), incubation of MDA-MB-231 cells with AGOH resulted in accumulation of the corresponding diphosphate, AGPP, identifying the molecular intermediate in the process by which AGOH becomes a substrate for protein prenyltransferases (Fig. 3D). We concurrently discovered that cells also formed AFPP (see Fig. 2 for structure) from AGOH, which we presume is a result of condensation of AGPP with an additional isoprene unit (Fig. 3D; see also Fig. 1). To investigate the efficiency of these processes, we incubated cells with increasing concentrations of the synthetic aniline-containing isoprenols and monitored their incorporation into isoprenoid diphosphates. We observed concentration-dependent formation of both AGPP and AFPP when cells were incubated with exogenous AGOH. We also found that exogenously provided anilinofarnesol (AFOH) was converted to AFPP. The levels of isoprenoid diphosphates formed from these exogenous unnatural isoprenol probes were comparable to the levels of endogenously formed FPP and GGPP, and levels of these endogenous isoprenoid diphosphates were similar to levels reported by other researchers using an enzymatic assay (20Holstein S.A. Tong H. Kuder C.H. Hohl R.J. Quantitative determination of geranyl diphosphate levels in cultured human cells.Lipids. 2009; 44: 1055-1062Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). However, total cellular isoprenoid diphosphate levels increased additively in the presence of these unnatural exogenous isoprenols (Fig. 4A). Importantly, we also observed accumulation of FPP-d6 and GGPP-d6 in cells treated with increasing concentrations FOH-d6, indicating that the ability of these cells to generate isoprenoid diphosphates from exogenous isoprenols is not limited to these aniline-containing analogs. The additive increases in isoprenoid diphosphates observed with the aniline-containing probes were also observed when cells were incubated with FOH-d6 at concentrations in excess of 20 μm, suggesting that rather than being a consequence of AGPP accumulating because it cannot be further metabolized by the mevalonate pathway, exogenous isoprenols are metabolized to generate a pool of isoprenoid diphosphates that is regulated and accumulates separately from that generated by the mevalonate pathway (Fig. 4B). We used these methods to compare incorporation of AGOH and FOH-d6 into isoprenoid diphosphates in three different cancer cell lines, MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells, HepG2 hepatoma cells, and SUIT-2 pancreatic cancer cells. Formation of isoprenoid diphosphates from these exogenous precursors was 2–4-fold more efficient in MDA-MB-231 cells than in the two other cell types (TABLE 1, TABLE 2).FIGURE 3Detection and quantitation of isoprenoid diphosphates formed from exogenous isoprenols in mammalian cell extracts by electrospray ionization HPLC-MS/MS tandem mass spectrometry.

The latter was recently expounded on by findings from Puma-deficient mice, indicating that loss of this proapoptotic p53 target gene results in protection from IR-induced lymphomagenesis rather than enhanced susceptibility to. Similar to Puma, the transcription factor interferon regulatory factor 5 (Irf5) has been reported as a p53 target gene and is required for DNA damage-induced apoptosis. To date, no studies have been performed to elucidate the in vivo role of IRF5 in tumorigenesis. Given its essential role in DNA damage-induced apoptosis, we explored the tumor suppressor function of IRF5 in IR-induced thymic lymphomagenesis. Somewhat surprisingly, we found that thymic lymphoma development was significantly suppressed in Irf5−/− mice as compared with wild-type littermates. Suppression was due, in part, to reduced thymocyte and HSC apoptosis, resulting in reduced compensatory proliferation, and reduced replication stress-associated DNA damage. The observed effects were independent of p53 or Puma as these proteins were upregulated in Irf5−/− mice in response to IR. This study demonstrates an important new role for IRF5 in maintaining HSC homeostasis after IR and supports the non-redundant functions of IRF5, p53 and PUMA in DNA damage-induced lymphomagenesis. We propose that IRF5 may be an attractive target for developing therapeutic agents to ameliorate radiation-induced bone marrow injury."

The 44-amino acid E5 protein of bovine papillomavirus binds to and activates the PDGFβ receptor (PDGFβR), resulting in oncogenic transformation of cultured fibroblasts. Previously, we isolated an artificial 36-amino acid transmembrane protein, pTM36-4, which transforms cells because of its ability to activate the PDGFβR despite limited sequence similarity to E5. Here, we demonstrated complex formation between the PDGFβR and three pTM36-4 mutants: T21E, T21Q, and T21N. T21Q retained wild type transforming activity and activated the PDGFβR in a ligand-independent manner as a consequence of binding to the transmembrane domain of the PDGFβR, but T21E and T21N were severely defective. In fact, T21N substantially inhibited E5-induced PDGFβR activation and transformation in both mouse and human fibroblasts. T21N did not prevent E5 from binding to the receptor, and genetic evidence suggested that T21N and E5 bind to nonidentical sites in the transmembrane domain of the receptor. T21N also inhibited transformation and PDGFβR activation induced by v-Sis, a viral homologue of PDGF-BB, as well as PDGF-induced mitogenesis and signaling by preventing phosphorylation of the PDGFβR at particular tyrosine residues. These results demonstrated that T21N acts as a novel inhibitor of the PDGFβR and validated a new strategy for designing highly specific short transmembrane protein inhibitors of growth factor receptors and possibly other transmembrane proteins.Background: Certain artificial small transmembrane proteins can activate the PDGFβ receptor to promote cellular growth transformation.Results: A point mutant of one such protein binds to this receptor and inhibits activation induced by different ligands.Conclusion: Small transmembrane proteins can be engineered to inhibit PDGFβ receptor activity.Significance: This strategy could be generalized for designing novel inhibitors of growth factor receptors, which may have therapeutic implications.
