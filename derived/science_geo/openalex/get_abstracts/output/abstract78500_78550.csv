https://openalex.org/W1978396103,"Studies of behavior in yellow bullheads showed that they recognized individuals of their own species by means of pheromones. After training by reward and punishment, blinded bullheads were able to discriminate between the odors of two donor fish, but they lost this ability when deprived of their sense of smell. The main source of the intraspecific chemical stimuli involved in recognition is the mucus. A change in status after fighting was chemically communicated to other bullheads."

https://openalex.org/W2048134930,"Damage induced by ultraviolet light or x-rays to the DNA of a eucaryotic organism, Tetrahymena pyriformis, is repaired by a process similar to the repair system present in bacteria. This repair process, which involves defect excision and subsequent resynthesis of the damaged section of DNA, occurs in the dark. Photoreactivation of damage induced by ultraviolet light is also indicated by a reduction in observed repair synthesis. An improved method for detecting repair synthesis is described. Repair synthesis is measured in parental DNA strands isolated from cultures that have undergone normal DNA replication after the repair process."

https://openalex.org/W2003144199,INVESTIGATIONS of snail neurones have shown that some cells can maintain their action potentials in solutions free of sodium1–4 and are not affected by tetrodotoxin3. These nerves may have a calcium carrying current system similar to that described in barnacle muscle5.
https://openalex.org/W2044061883,"Intense colored light from a gas laser evokes a photoelectric potential in the photoreceptor cells of the ventral eye of Limulus. This potential has two components, both of which have the action spectrum of a rhodopsin with an absorbancy maximum at 530 nm. The evidence is consistent with the hypothesis that the photoelectric potential arises directly from the orderly array of rhodopsin molecules which are an integral part of the photoreceptor cell membrane."

Two forces—rapidly growing population and, in much of the world, rapidly rising incomes—are expected to result in increases in the demand for food even more rapid than those that have occurred during the past."
https://openalex.org/W2035720885,"THERE are two types of pigmented cells in normal human skin, the junctional dendritic melanocyte and the intradermal melanosome-phagocytosing melanophage (Fig. 1). In contrast to the melanocyte and its contained melanosome synthesizing process which have been thoroughly investigated, the cellular physiology of the melanophage remains unknown despite recent advances in electron microscopy and gradient biochemistry. The two cells containing melanin appear similar under the light microscope but electron microscopy reveals definite structural differences. The normal melanocyte contains various stages of melanosome synthesis occurring individually in close association with the Golgi apparatus. On the other hand, the actively phagocytosing melanophage concentrates its melanosomes1–3 as degradative conglomerates into specially developed phagocytic vacuoles structurally resembling the lysosomes found in such tissues as kidney, liver and pancreas4,5. Lysosomes were found to be rich in acid phosphatase4,5, which predicted the presence of this hydrolytic enzyme in the phagocytic vacuoles of the dermal melanophage6. We found subsequently that acid phosphatase activity is concentrated in the melanophages and that there is little or no such activity in the melanocytes at the epidermal–dermal junction7. On the other hand, the melanophages contain little if any tyrosinase while the junctional melanocytes are shown to contain an abundance of this oxidative enzyme, primarily within the premelanosomes8. It is further observed with the electron microscope, using the modified Gomori reaction, that the electron opaque accumulation of lead sulphide resulting from acid phosphatase activity occurs primarily in the melanosome-concentrating phagocytic vacuoles of the melanophages7."

Rather, a methanol extract of top smelt is an attractant, as is methanol extract of shrimp."
