These 'apoptotic' cells expose phosphatidylserine (PS) on their surface as an 'eat-me' signal. Miyanishi et al. show that the receptors Tim4 and Tim1 are implicated in phagocyte recognition of PS, while Park et al. show that the BAI1 protein is a receptor for PS in mammalian macrophages. Apoptotic cells expose phosphatidylserine as an 'eat-me' signal for macrophages. This paper shows that the receptors Tim4 and Tim1 are implicated in phagocyte recognition of phosphatidylserine. In programmed cell death, a large number of cells undergo apoptosis, and are engulfed by macrophages to avoid the release of noxious materials from the dying cells1,2. In definitive erythropoiesis, nuclei are expelled from erythroid precursor cells and are engulfed by macrophages. Phosphatidylserine is exposed on the surface of apoptotic cells3 and on the nuclei expelled from erythroid precursor cells4; it works as an ‘eat me’ signal for phagocytes5,6. Phosphatidylserine is also expressed on the surface of exosomes involved in intercellular signalling7. Here we established a library of hamster monoclonal antibodies against mouse peritoneal macrophages, and found an antibody that strongly inhibited the phosphatidylserine-dependent engulfment of apoptotic cells. The antigen recognized by the antibody was identified by expression cloning as a type I transmembrane protein called Tim4 (T-cell immunoglobulin- and mucin-domain-containing molecule; also known as Timd4)8. Tim4 was expressed in Mac1+ cells in various mouse tissues, including spleen, lymph nodes and fetal liver. Tim4 bound apoptotic cells by recognizing phosphatidylserine via its immunoglobulin domain. The expression of Tim4 in fibroblasts enhanced their ability to engulf apoptotic cells. When the anti-Tim4 monoclonal antibody was administered into mice, the engulfment of apoptotic cells by thymic macrophages was significantly blocked, and the mice developed autoantibodies. Among the other Tim family members, Tim1, but neither Tim2 nor Tim3, specifically bound phosphatidylserine. Tim1- or Tim4-expressing Ba/F3 B cells were bound by exosomes via phosphatidylserine, and exosomes stimulated the interaction between Tim1 and Tim4. These results indicate that Tim4 and Tim1 are phosphatidylserine receptors for the engulfment of apoptotic cells, and may also be involved in intercellular signalling in which exosomes are involved."

https://openalex.org/W2120030399,"The plant growth regulator auxin controls cell identity, cell division and cell expansion. Auxin efflux facilitators (PINs) are associated with auxin maxima in distal regions of both shoots and roots. Here we model diffusion and PIN-facilitated auxin transport in and across cells within a structured root layout. In our model, the stable accumulation of auxin in a distal maximum emerges from the auxin flux pattern. We have experimentally tested model predictions of robustness and self-organization. Our model explains pattern formation and morphogenesis at timescales from seconds to weeks, and can be understood by conceptualizing the root as an ‘auxin capacitor’. A robust auxin gradient associated with the maximum, in combination with separable roles of auxin in cell division and cell expansion, is able to explain the formation, maintenance and growth of sharply bounded meristematic and elongation zones. Directional permeability and diffusion can fully account for stable auxin maxima and gradients that can instruct morphogenesis. Polar auxin transport is a factor in almost all developmental processes in plants but there is still much to be learned about how it operates. In cells, directional auxin transport is controlled by the PIN protein carrier complex. A new computational model has been developed to describe diffusion and PIN-facilitated auxin transport in and across the cells of the root system. The model addresses two major issues in plant development. First it supports the concept of an auxin maximum and gradient to guide root growth. Second, it shows how a single molecule can generate a field of information: a concentration gradient across the organ growth zone is closely associated with auxin maxima. A related paper shows that four PLETHORA genes are vital for root development and are candidate output factors for the auxin gradient. A computational model that spans molecular and cellular levels describing diffusion and PIN-facilitated auxin transport in and across cells within the root system is experimentally tested. The model strongly supports that plant roots are able to generate an auxin maximum and a highly robust auxin gradient with morphogenic properties."

Miyanishi et al. show that the receptors Tim4 and Tim1 are implicated in phagocyte recognition of PS, while Park et al. show that the BAI1 protein is a receptor for PS in mammalian macrophages. Apoptotic cells must be removed by phagocytes to avoid local inflammation. They expose phosphatidylserine, which is normally restricted to the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane, on their surface, acting as an 'eat-me' signal. This paper shows that the BAI1 protein is an upstream receptor for phosphatidylserine in mammalian macrophages Engulfment and subsequent degradation of apoptotic cells is an essential step that occurs throughout life in all multicellular organisms1,2,3. ELMO/Dock180/Rac proteins are a conserved signalling module for promoting the internalization of apoptotic cell corpses4,5; ELMO and Dock180 function together as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for the small GTPase Rac, and thereby regulate the phagocyte actin cytoskeleton during engulfment4,5,6. However, the receptor(s) upstream of the ELMO/Dock180/Rac module are still unknown. Here we identify brain-specific angiogenesis inhibitor 1 (BAI1) as a receptor upstream of ELMO and as a receptor that can bind phosphatidylserine on apoptotic cells. BAI1 is a seven-transmembrane protein belonging to the adhesion-type G-protein-coupled receptor family, with an extended extracellular region7,8,9 and no known ligands. We show that BAI1 functions as an engulfment receptor in both the recognition and subsequent internalization of apoptotic cells. Through multiple lines of investigation, we identify phosphatidylserine, a key ‘eat-me’ signal exposed on apoptotic cells10,11,12,13, as a ligand for BAI1. The thrombospondin type 1 repeats within the extracellular region of BAI1 mediate direct binding to phosphatidylserine. As with intracellular signalling, BAI1 forms a trimeric complex with ELMO and Dock180, and functional studies suggest that BAI1 cooperates with ELMO/Dock180/Rac to promote maximal engulfment of apoptotic cells. Last, decreased BAI1 expression or interference with BAI1 function inhibits the engulfment of apoptotic targets ex vivo and in vivo. Thus, BAI1 is a phosphatidylserine recognition receptor that can directly recruit a Rac–GEF complex to mediate the uptake of apoptotic cells."

https://openalex.org/W2023710365,"Caspase-1 is an essential effector of inflammation, pyroptosis, and septic shock. Few caspase-1 substrates have been identified to date, and these substrates do not account for its wide range of actions. To understand the function of caspase-1, we initiated the systematic identification of its cellular substrates. Using the diagonal gel proteomic approach, we identified 41 proteins that are directly cleaved by caspase-1. Among these were chaperones, cytoskeletal and translation machinery proteins, and proteins involved in immunity. A series of unexpected proteins along the glycolysis pathway were also identified, including aldolase, triose-phosphate isomerase, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, α-enolase, and pyruvate kinase. With the exception of the latter, the identified glycolysis enzymes were specifically cleaved in vitro by recombinant caspase-1, but not caspase-3. The enzymatic activity of wild-type glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, but not a non-cleavable mutant, was dampened by caspase-1 processing. In vivo, stimuli that fully activated caspase-1, including Salmonella typhimurium infection and septic shock, caused a pronounced processing of these proteins in the macrophage and diaphragm muscle, respectively. Notably, these stimuli inhibited glycolysis in wild-type cells compared with caspase-1-deficient cells. The systematic characterization of caspase-1 substrates identifies the glycolysis pathway as a caspase-1 target and provides new insights into its function during pyroptosis and septic shock.

The systematic characterization of caspase-1 substrates identifies the glycolysis pathway as a caspase-1 target and provides new insights into its function during pyroptosis and septic shock. Caspases are aspartate-specific cysteine proteases known for their function in regulating programmed cell death and inflammation. Phylogenetically, they are subdivided into the CED3-related enzymes that initiate and execute cell death and the caspase-1-related proteins that process and mature cytokines, viz. IL-1β, 2The abbreviations used are:ILinterleukinTIMtriose-phosphate isomeraseGAPDHglyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenaseCHAPS3-[(3-cholamidopropyl) dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acidLPSlipopolysaccharideBisTris2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl) amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl) propane-1,3-diolTBSTris-buffered salineMALDI-TOFmatrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight. IL-18, and IL-33. Apoptotic caspases execute cell death through the restricted cleavage of key cellular proteins required to maintain cell viability, resulting in the morphological changes observed during apoptosis, including membrane blebbing, nuclear condensation, and cytoskeletal dismantling (1Nicholson D.W. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 1028-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (1306) Google Scholar). interleukin triose-phosphate isomerase glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl) dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid lipopolysaccharide 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl) amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl) propane-1,3-diol Tris-buffered saline matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight Caspase-1 is essential during inflammation because of its role in the activation of cytokine signaling pathways. With the exception of its cytokine substrates, very little is known regarding the spectrum of cellular proteins it targets upon full activation. Similar to other caspases, caspase-1 is found in cells as an inactive precursor and is activated in response to inflammatory triggers, including pathogen-derived molecules, as well as danger signals released from infected or dying cells (2Scott A.M. Saleh M. Cell Death Differ. 2007; 14: 23-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Caspase-1 activation is achieved in a macromolecular complex known as the inflammasome through its recruitment to a scaffolding molecule generally via the adaptor ASC (3Mariathasan S. Monack D.M. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2007; 7: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (701) Google Scholar). Scaffolding molecules that activate caspase-1 within the inflammasome belong to the cytosolic Nod-like family of pathogen recognition receptors and include Nalp1–3, Ipaf, and Naip5 (4Tschopp J. Martinon F. Burns K. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 95-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar). More recently, a distinct caspase-1 activation platform, the ASC pyroptosome, has been characterized (5Fernandes-Alnemri T. Wu J. Yu J.W. Datta P. Miller B. Jankowski W. Rosenberg S. Zhang J. Alnemri E.S. Cell Death Differ. 2007; 14: 1590-1604Crossref PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar). It differs from the inflammasome in that it does not contain a Nod-like scaffolding protein but is assembled through the oligomerization of ASC. Although caspase-1 is activated transiently within the Nalp inflammasomes, resulting in controlled inflammation and the restricted processing of cytokine substrates, it is fully activated within the pyroptosome, leading to a distinct form of inflammatory cell death known as pyroptosis (6Saleh M. Green D.R. Cell Death Differ. 2007; 14: 1559-1560Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Pyroptosis exhibits features common to both apoptosis and necrosis, including nuclear condensation, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, and membrane swelling (5Fernandes-Alnemri T. Wu J. Yu J.W. Datta P. Miller B. Jankowski W. Rosenberg S. Zhang J. Alnemri E.S. Cell Death Differ. 2007; 14: 1590-1604Crossref PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar). It was initially observed in macrophages infected with the intracellular pathogen Salmonella typhimurium (7Monack D.M. Navarre W.W. Falkow S. Microbes Infect. 2001; 3: 1201-1212Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) but was later found to occur in response to infection with other intracellular pathogens (8Fink S.L. Cookson B.T. Infect. Immun. 2005; 73: 1907-1916Crossref PubMed Scopus (1518) Google Scholar, 9Swanson M.S. Molofsky A.B. Autophagy. 2005; 1: 174-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Because only a few substrates for caspase-1 have been identified thus far, the mechanism by which caspase-1 kills the cell via pyroptosis remains obscure. Another instance in which caspase-1 is activated is during septic shock (10Kuida K. Lippke J.A. Ku G. Harding M.W. Livingston D.J. Su M.S. Flavell R.A. Science. 1995; 267: 2000-2003Crossref PubMed Scopus (1461) Google Scholar, 11Li P. Allen H. Banerjee S. Franklin S. Herzog L. Johnston C. McDowell J. Paskind M. Rodman L. Salfeld J. Towne E. Tracey D. Wardwell S. Wei F.-Y. Wong W. Kamen R. Seshadri T. Cell. 1995; 80: 401-411Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1314) Google Scholar). Hyperproduction of cytokines alone does not account for the totality of caspase-1 effects during septic shock. One characteristic of this condition is an impaired ventilatory muscle contractility that causes ventilatory failure and respiratory arrest (12Hussain S.N. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1998; 179: 125-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), and caspase-1-deficient mice, but not IL-1β/IL-18 double knock-out mice, are protected from this condition (13Sarkar A. Hall M.W. Exline M. Hart J. Knatz N. Gatson N.T. Wewers M.D. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 2006; 174: 1003-1010Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). To understand the role of caspase-1 in pyroptosis and septic shock, we sought to identify its cellular substrates. Here, we used the diagonal gel proteomic approach and identified multiple caspase-1 direct targets. These included structural proteins, chaperones, translation machinery proteins, and proteins involved in immunity. A series of unexpected proteins along the glycolysis pathway were also identified as caspase-1 substrates, including aldolase, TIM, GAPDH, enolase, and pyruvate kinase. Here, we show that Salmonella infection, which fully activates caspase-1 and induces pyroptosis (7Monack D.M. Navarre W.W. Falkow S. Microbes Infect. 2001; 3: 1201-1212Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), caused a pronounced degradation of these glycolysis enzymes and lowered the glycolytic rate of wild-type macrophages, but not caspase-1-deficient cells. Similarly, we show that the glycolysis enzymes were processed in the diaphragm muscle of wild-type septic mice. Detailed analysis of the caspase-1 substrates is likely to shed light on caspase-1 function in pyroptotic cell death and septic shock.

Human recombinant caspase-1 was from Merck. TRIzol RNA extraction reagent, oligo(dT)12–18 primers, random hexamers, and Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase were from Invitrogen. RNase inhibitor and an in vitro transcription/translation kit were from Promega Corp. The QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit was from Stratagene. Diagonal Gel—18 × 106 THP-1 cells or human peripheral blood mononuclear cells were lysed in 200 μl of Laemmli SDS loading buffer (50 mm Tris (pH 6.8), 2% SDS, 0.1% bromphenol blue, 10% glycerol, and 2.5% β-mercaptoethanol) and sonicated three times for 15 s each (with the sonicator speed adjusted to prevent foaming). 400 μg of protein was resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE (first dimension). After migration, the lane containing the protein was excised and soaked in 40% ethanol and 10% acetic acid for 10 min, in ethanol 30% for 10 min, and then in ultrapure water twice for 10 min each. The lane was air-dried until the gel started to curl; soaked in CHEG buffer (0.1% CHAPS, 50 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.2), 2 mm EDTA, and 10% glycerol with 5 mm dithiothreitol freshly added) with or without 50 μg of recombinant caspase-1 or caspase-3 (Merck); and incubated overnight at 37 °C in a sealed bag. The lane was washed with water to remove the excess protease and then incubated in Laemmli SDS loading buffer for 10 min in a 95 °C water bath in a conical tube. After cooling, the lane was loaded onto a second dimension 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and resolved again. After migration, the gel was fixed in 10% acetic acid and 40% ethanol and then silver-stained. Cleaved proteins, which were located under the diagonal, were excised from the gel and identified by mass spectrometry at the McGill University and Génome Québec Innovation Centre by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. RNA Extraction and Reverse Transcription-PCR—Total RNA was isolated from THP-1 cells using TRIzol reagent. Every 1 × 106 cells were lysed in 200 μl of TRIzol and extracted with 40 μl of chloroform. cDNAs were created via reverse transcription using oligo(dT) or random hexamers. Plasmid Preparation and Site-directed Mutagenesis—Enolase, aldolase, TIM, and pyruvate kinase were amplified by PCR from THP-1 cDNA. For the primers used, please see supplemental Table 1. The PCR products were cloned into the pcDNA3.1/neo vector. The plasmids cloned from cDNA were confirmed by sequencing. The GAPDH cDNA was purchased from American Type Culture Collection (catalog no. 57091) and recloned into the pcDNA3.0 vector. Potential cleavage site mutations were introduced by site-directed mutagenesis using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit following the manufacturer's instructions.

In Vitro Transcription/Translation—[35S]Methionine-labeled substrates were obtained by coupled in vitro transcription/translation using the Promega TnT reticulocyte lysate system or the wheat germ lysate system. 0.7 μg of the cDNA constructs was incubated with T7 polymerase, rabbit reticulocyte or wheat germ lysate, amino acid mixture minus methionine, and [35S]methionine for 1.5 h at 30 °C. Caspase Cleavage Assays—Cleavage of the in vitro transcribed and translated 35S-labeled substrates was performed in a 20-μl reaction containing 2 μlof in vitro transcribed and translated 35S-labeled substrates by incubation at 37 °C for 4 h in the presence or absence of purified human recombinant caspase-1 (170 ng) in CHEG buffer (with 10 mm dithiothreitol freshly added). The cleavage reaction was terminated by the addition of Laemmli SDS loading buffer and resolved by SDS-PAGE. The gel was fixed in 10% acetic acid and 40% ethanol for 0.5 h; the signal was then amplified by incubating the gel with NAMP 100V amplifying solution (Amersham Biosciences) for 30 min. The gel was placed on a Whatman paper, dried at 70 °C for 1 h, and exposed at –80 °C, and the signal was viewed by autoradiography. Salmonella Preparation for Infection—Salmonella strain SL1344 was cultured aerobically at 37 °C in LB broth or on LB agar without antibiotics. Bacteria were freshly plated on LB agar. To obtain stationary-phase bacteria for infection of THP-1 cells, LB broth was inoculated with a single colony and grown overnight in 3 ml of LB broth with shaking. The next day, before infection, bacteria were diluted 1:10 in LB broth and grown to A600 = 0.9 (equivalent to 105 bacteria/μl) at 50 rpm/min (∼3.5 h), and then bacteria were harvested by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 1 min, washed once with an equal amount of phosphate-buffered saline and once with culture medium (without antibiotics), and incubated for 20 min at 37 °C in cell culture medium (without antibiotics) in a tissue culture incubator in a conical tube with the cap loose. The bacteria were used immediately for infection of cells. Cell Culture and Infection—THP-1 cells were maintained at a density of ∼1 × 106 cells/ml. 1 day prior to infection, cells (5 ml at 1 × 106 cells/ml) were harvested, washed, and resuspended in fresh medium without antibiotics in a 10-cm plate. THP-1 cells were incubated overnight with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (20 ng/ml) to differentiate the cells into adherent macrophage-like cells. The next day, the medium and non-adherent cells were removed and replaced with fresh medium without antibiotics. The cells were then primed overnight with 50 ng/ml crude Escherichia coli LPS (serotype 0111:B4 L4391; Sigma). The next day, cells were infected with Salmonella at a multiplicity of infection of 1:1, 5:1, or 10:1 bacteria/THP-1 cells. Culture plates were centrifuged at 500 × g for 10 min and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min to allow phagocytosis to occur. The medium was then replaced with fresh medium without antibiotics and incubated for an additional 4–16 h. Preparation of Peritoneal Macrophages—Wild-type (C57BL/6) and caspase-1 knock-out (back-crossed onto the C57BL/6 background) mice were injected intraperitoneally with 2 ml of 3% thioglycolate, and peritoneal macrophages were collected after 96 h. Briefly, mice were intraperitoneally injected with 5 ml of RPMI 1640 medium using a 26.5-gauge needle, and peritoneal macrophages were taken out with a 5-ml syringe and an 18-gauge needle. The cell suspension was passed through a 100-μm filter, spun, and resuspended in fresh medium. 105 cells/well were plated in a 96-well plate. Mouse Model of LPS-induced Septic Shock—C57BL/6 mice (8–12 weeks old) were injected intraperitoneally with 20 mg/kg LPS from E. coli (serotype 055:B5; Sigma). Control mice were injected intraperitoneally with saline. The mice were killed 12 or 24 h post-injection by injection of 60 mg/kg pentobarbital. The diaphragm muscle (100 mg) was homogenized in 1 ml of buffer containing 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μm leupeptin, 1 μm pepstatin A, 0.4 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm sodium orthovanadate, and 30 mm sodium fluoride and then centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 20 min, and the supernatant was collected for Western blotting. Lactate Measurement—Peritoneal macrophages from wild-type or caspase-1 knock-out mice were plated in 96-well plates at a density of 1 × 105 cells/well. The cells were primed overnight with LPS (50 ng/ml) and then infected with Salmonella at a multiplicity of infection of 10:1 bacteria/peritoneal macrophages. After 4 h of infection, the culture medium was collected for lactate measurement using a kit from Trinity Biotech (catalog no. 735-10) following the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, 10 μl of cell culture medium was incubated with 1 ml of lactate reagent at room temperature for 10 min, and then the absorbance was read at 540 nm. The lactate concentration was calculated using an equation derived from a standard absorbance. GAPDH Assay—The assay mixture (1 ml) contained 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.8), 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (catalog no. G-5251, Sigma), 0.5 mm NAD+, and GAPDH from THP-1 cell lysates in CHEG buffer (80 μg of total protein) or in vitro transcribed and translated GAPDH and GAPDH(D189A) (10 μl). The reaction was initiated by the addition of GAPDH to the assay mixture, and the activity was monitored by NAD reduction at 340 nm. Absorbance was recorded every 10 s during 5 min. Sample Preparation for GAPDH Assay—For the assay using GAPDH from cell lysates, THP-1 cells were lysed in CHEG buffer, and 80 μg total proteins was diluted in 100 μl of CHEG buffer and incubated with or without 170 ng of caspase-1 at 37 °C for 3 h. For the assay using in vitro transcribed and translated GAPDH or its mutant D189A, in vitro transcribed and translated products (10 μl) were diluted in a total of 20 μlof CHEG buffer and then incubated with or without caspase-1 for 3 h. Western Blotting—For Western blotting, 1.2 × 106 cells were lysed in 100 μl of 1× SDS-PAGE buffer, sonicated three times for 10 s each, and then spun down at 13,000 rpm for 15 min. 40 μl was loaded onto a 4–12% Criterion XT precast BisTris/SDS-polyacrylamide gel (Bio-Rad), migrated at 125 V for 1.5 h, and transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane at 50 V for 1 h. The membrane was then blocked in 5% milk in TBS containing 0.1% Tween for 1 h at room temperature. The primary antibodies were diluted as described above in 5% milk in TBS containing 0.1% Tween and incubated overnight with the membrane with shaking at 4 °C. The blot was washed three times for 10 min each with TBS containing 0.1% Tween at room temperature. The secondary antibodies were diluted as described above in 5% milk in TBS containing 0.1% Tween and incubated with the membrane for 1 h at room temperature. The blot was washed three times for 5 min each with TBS containing 0.3% Tween and then three times for 5 min each with TBS containing 0.1% Tween. The signal was developed by incubating the blot with SuperSignal West Femto maximum sensitivity substrate reagent (catalog no. 34095, Pierce) for 5 min at room temperature. The Caspase-1 Digestome—To identify caspase-1 substrates, we used the diagonal gel proteomic approach (14Ricci J.E. Munoz-Pinedo C. Fitzgerald P. Bailly-Maitre B. Perkins G.A. Yadava N. Scheffler I.E. Ellisman M.H. Green D.R. Cell. 2004; 117: 773-786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). In this method, cellular proteins are separated on a first dimension denaturing SDS-polyacrylamide gel lane, which after migration is washed to remove residual SDS, dehydrated, and then rehydrated in a caspase activation buffer containing the caspase of choice. Following the in-gel processing of the caspase substrates, the gel lane is loaded horizontally on a second dimension SDS-polyacrylamide gel, resulting in the migration of the majority of cellular proteins along a diagonal line and of the cleaved proteins under the diagonal (Fig. 1, A and B). The cleavage products were identified by mass spectrometry. To validate the method, we initially screened for caspase-3 targets and identified multiple caspase-3 known substrates along with novel substrates (Table 1) (data not shown). For the caspase-1 screen, we chose to work with cell lysates from LPS-stimulated THP-1 macrophages as a source of cellular proteins on the diagonal gel. To control for the caspase-1 digestion, we performed a Western blot on the caspase-1 diagonal gel and detected the drop of mature IL-1β under the diagonal at 17 kDa as expected (Fig. 1C). Spots that dropped under the diagonal on the caspase-1 gel were excised and processed for mass spectrometry. After eliminating hits with <10% peptide coverage of the sequence of the cleaved product, we obtained 41 proteins that were processed by caspase-1. These included proteins involved in different processes essential for cell survival, such as translation, cytoskeletal architecture and function, signaling, and energy metabolism (Fig. 1D). These processes were also targeted by caspase-3 in the diagonal gel screen and are targeted by executioner caspases in vivo during apoptosis. Despite acting on common cellular pathways, caspase-1 and caspase-3 did not cleave the same proteins along these pathways. 30% of the caspase-1 substrates were also processed by caspase-3, whereas the remaining 70% were specific to caspase-1.TABLE 1List of the known caspase substrates and glycolysis enzyme substrates that were identified in the caspase-1 or caspase-3 diagonal gel experiments by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometryProteinGenBank™ accession no.FunctionCaspase-1Caspase-3Known caspase substrateRef.Cellular myosin heavy chaingi 553596Cytoskeletal proteinXX30Gerner C.

To validate this result, we first performed in vitro caspase cleavage assays. Although both caspase-1 and caspase-3 processed an in vitro transcribed and translated [35S]methionine-labeled form of the classical caspase target poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (15Gu Y. Sarnecki C.

Chem. 1995; 270: 18715-18718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar), only caspase-1, but not caspase-3, cleaved the glycolysis enzymes aldolase, TIM, GAPDH, and enolase (Fig. 2B). On the other hand, pyruvate kinase was cleaved by both caspases (Fig. 2B). Because the cleavage of GAPDH by caspase-1 was more efficient than that of the other glycolysis enzymes in vitro, we further characterized this cleavage event. The addition of increasing amounts of caspase-1 led to enhanced GAPDH processing in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3A). In comparison with the full processing of pro-IL-1β by caspase-1 that required 1 ng of our caspase-1 preparation, maximum cleavage of the GAPDH proform required 50 ng of the enzyme (Fig. 3A), suggesting that in vivo, GAPDH processing would occur under conditions in which caspase-1 is fully activated, leading to pyroptotic cell death, rather than in response to stimuli that activate caspase-1, transiently leading to cytokine maturation. Caspase processing could lead to either a gain- or loss-of-function consequence for the substrate. To examine the effect of caspase-1 on GAPDH function, we performed GAPDH enzymatic activity assays in vitro in the presence or absence of caspase-1. Our results indicated that incubation of cell lysates with caspase-1 diminished GAPDH activity by up to 70% compared with the activity measured in the absence of caspase-1 (Fig. 3B), suggesting a loss-of-function effect of caspase-1 on GAPDH. We next sought to identify the caspase-1 cleavage site in GAPDH. On the basis of the size of the cleavage product, we mapped four potential caspase cleavage sites and mutated their corresponding aspartic acid residues to alanine (Fig. 3C). We then performed in vitro caspase cleavage assays and identified the sequence KTVD189↓G as the caspase-1 cleavage site in GAPDH. The mutation D189A abrogated the processing of GAPDH by caspase-1 (Fig. 3D). Alignment of protein sequences from different species revealed that the caspase-1 cleavage site in GAPDH and the sequence flanking it have been highly conserved throughout evolution (Fig. 3E). To address the significance of the caspase-1 cleavage, we compared the enzymatic activity of wild-type GAPDH with"
https://openalex.org/W1981691061,"Hedgehog (HH) morphogen is essential for metazoan development. The seven-transmembrane protein smoothened (SMO) transduces the HH signal across the plasma membrane, but how SMO is activated remains poorly understood. In Drosophila melanogaster, HH induces phosphorylation at multiple Ser/Thr residues in the SMO carboxy-terminal cytoplasmic tail, leading to its cell surface accumulation and activation. Here we provide evidence that phosphorylation activates SMO by inducing a conformational switch. This occurs by antagonizing multiple Arg clusters in the SMO cytoplasmic tail. The Arg clusters inhibit SMO by blocking its cell surface expression and keeping it in an inactive conformation that is maintained by intramolecular electrostatic interactions. HH-induced phosphorylation disrupts the interaction, and induces a conformational switch and dimerization of SMO cytoplasmic tails, which is essential for pathway activation. Increasing the number of mutations in the Arg clusters progressively activates SMO. Hence, by employing multiple Arg clusters as inhibitory elements counteracted by differential phosphorylation, SMO acts as a rheostat to translate graded HH signals into distinct responses. The Hedgehog (HH) morphogen governs cell differentiation and proliferation in a diverse array of patterning events in many animal species, ranging from insects to mammals. The seven-transmembrane protein Smoothened transduces the HH signal across the plasma membrane but molecular mechanisms of its activation are poorly understood. Zhao et al. demonstrate the mechanism by which the cytoplasmic tail of Smoothened transmits the HH signal.

This drug is neuroprotective and has several identified molecular targets. However, it has a narrow therapeutic range and the one or more underlying mechanisms of its therapeutic action are not understood. Here we describe a pharmacogenetic study of Li(+) in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Exposure to Li(+) at clinically relevant concentrations throughout adulthood increases survival during normal aging (up to 46% median increase). Longevity is extended via a novel mechanism with altered expression of genes encoding nucleosome-associated functions. Li(+) treatment results in reduced expression of the worm ortholog of LSD-1 (T08D10.2), a histone demethylase; knockdown by RNA interference of T08D10.2 is sufficient to extend longevity ( approximately 25% median increase), suggesting Li(+) regulates survival by modulating histone methylation and chromatin structure."

Current protocols for the extraction of proteins from yeast cells are likely to introduce artifacts into quantification procedures because of incomplete or selective extraction. Principal Findings We have developed a novel procedure for protein extraction from S. cerevisiae based on chemical lysis and simultaneous solubilization in SDS and urea, which can extract the great majority of proteins to apparent completeness. The procedure can be used for different Saccharomycetes yeast species and varying growth conditions, is suitable for high-throughput extraction in a 96-well format, and the resulting extracts can easily be post-processed for use in non-SDS compatible procedures like 2D gel electrophoresis. Conclusions An improved method for quantitative protein extraction has been developed that removes some of the sources of artefacts in quantitative proteomics experiments, while at the same time allowing novel types of applications."

Findings We identified several mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation complex subunits, including several encoded by mtDNA, that are upregulated by hsp90 inhibitors, without corresponding changes in mRNA abundance. Post-transcriptional accumulation of mitochondrial proteins observed with hsp90 inhibitors is also seen in cells treated with proteasome inhibitors. Detailed studies of the OSCP subunit of mitochondrial F1F0-ATPase revealed the presence of mono- and polyubiquitinated OSCP in mitochondrial fractions. We demonstrate that processed OSCP undergoes retrotranslocation to a trypsin-sensitive form associated with the outer mitochondrial membrane. Inhibition of proteasome or hsp90 function results in accumulation of both correctly targeted and retrotranslocated mitochondrial OSCP. Conclusions Cytosolic turnover of mitochondrial proteins demonstrates a novel connection between mitochondrial and cytosolic compartments through the ubiquitin-proteasome system. Analogous to defective protein folding in the endoplasmic reticulum, a mitochondrial unfolded protein response may play a role in the apoptotic effects of hsp90 and proteasome inhibitors."
https://openalex.org/W1978411440,"During neuronal differentiation, lamellipodia and filopodia explore the environment in search for the correct path to the axon's final destination. Although the motion of lamellipodia and filopodia has been characterized to an extent, little is known about the force they exert. In this study, we used optical tweezers to measure the force exerted by filopodia and lamellipodia with a millisecond temporal resolution. We found that a single filopodium exerts a force not exceeding 3 pN, whereas lamellipodia can exert a force up to 20 pN. Using metabolic inhibitors, we showed that no force is produced in the absence of actin polymerization and that development of forces larger than 3 pN requires microtubule polymerization. These results show that actin polymerization is necessary for force production and demonstrate that not only do neurons process information, but they also act on their environment exerting forces varying from tenths pN to tens of pN."
https://openalex.org/W2098335118,"We quantify the influence of the topology of a transcriptional regulatory network on its ability to process environmental signals. By posing the problem in terms of information theory, we do this without specifying the function performed by the network. Specifically, we study the maximum mutual information between the input (chemical) signal and the output (genetic) response attainable by the network in the context of an analytic model of particle number fluctuations. We perform this analysis for all biochemical circuits, including various feedback loops, that can be built out of 3 chemical species, each under the control of one regulator. We find that a generic network, constrained to low molecule numbers and reasonable response times, can transduce more information than a simple binary switch and, in fact, manages to achieve close to the optimal information transmission fidelity. These high-information solutions are robust to tenfold changes in most of the networks' biochemical parameters; moreover they are easier to achieve in networks containing cycles with an odd number of negative regulators (overall negative feedback) due to their decreased molecular noise (a result which we derive analytically). Finally, we demonstrate that a single circuit can support multiple high-information solutions. These findings suggest a potential resolution of the ""cross-talk"" phenomenon as well as the previously unexplained observation that transcription factors that undergo proteolysis are more likely to be auto-repressive."
https://openalex.org/W1975086865,"The human pathogenic yeast Candida albicans utilizes host complement regulators for immune evasion. Here we identify the first fungal protein that binds Factor H and FHL-1. By screening a protein array of 4088 proteins of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, phosphoglycerate mutase (ScGpm1p) was identified as a Factor H- and FHL-1-binding protein. The homologous C. albicans Gpm1p (CaGpm1p) was cloned and recombinantly expressed as a 36-kDa His-tagged protein. Purified CaGpm1p binds the host complement regulators Factor H and FHL-1, but not C4BP. The CaGpm1p binding regions in the host proteins were localized; FHL-1 binds via short consensus repeats (SCRs) 6 and 7, and Factor H utilizes two contact regions that are located in SCRs 6 and 7 and in SCRs 19 and 20. In addition, recombinant CaGpm1p binds plasminogen via lysine residues. CaGpm1p is a surface protein as demonstrated by immunostaining and flow cytometry. A C. albicans gpm1-/- mutant strain was generated that did not grow on glucose-supplemented but on ethanol- and glycerol-supplemented medium. Reduced binding of Factor H and plasminogen to the null mutant strain is in agreement with the presence of additional binding proteins. Attached to CaGpm1p, each of the three host plasma proteins is functionally active. Factor H and FHL-1 show cofactor activity for cleavage of C3b, and bound plasminogen is converted by urokinase-type plasminogen activator to proteolytically active plasmin.

Thus, the surface-expressed CaGpm1p is a virulence factor that utilizes the host Factor H, FHL-1, and plasminogen for immune evasion and degradation of extracellular matrices. Candida albicans is the most important human pathogenic yeast and causes disseminated infections (1Beck-Sague C. Banerjee S. Jarvis W.R. Am. J. Public Health. 1993; 83: 1739-1742Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 2Pfaller M. Wenzel R. Eur. J. Clin. Microbiol. Infect. Dis. 1992; 11: 287-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). The yeast form represents a common saprophyte in healthy individuals, which resides mainly on the skin, oral cavity, urogenital, and gastrointestinal tracts. In addition, C. albicans can cause systemic infections predominantly in immunocompromised or granulocytopenic patients (3Fisher-Hoch S.P. Hutwagner L. Clin. Infect. Dis. 1995; 21: 897-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). C. albicans systemic infections, which are difficult to diagnose and treat, can be lethal (4Edwards Jr., J.E. N. Engl. J. Med. 1991; 324: 1060-1062Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Virulence of C. albicans is based on its ability to bind to host cells (5Calderone R.A. Fonzi W.A. Trends Microbiol. 2001; 9: 327-335Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1005) Google Scholar). Several secretory proteolytic enzymes are involved in tissue invasion of C. albicans (6Schaller M. Borelli C. Korting H.C. Hube B. Mycoses. 2005; 48: 365-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). In addition, morphogenetic transition from yeast to hyphal forms correlates with the infection process and causes adherence to host cells and tissue penetration (7Rooney P.J. Klein B.S. Cell Microbiol. 2002; 4: 127-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). As a commensal, C. albicans has evolved highly effective strategies of immune evasion to survive in the host (8Romani L. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2004; 4: 1-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar). The complement system represents an important part of host innate immunity. Four activation pathways have been described. The alternative pathway, which is initiated spontaneously, and by default, the lectin and classical pathway, which are triggered by antibodies or carbohydrates, are relevant for the recognition and elimination of microbes (9Walport M.J. N. Engl. J. Med. 2001; 344: 1058-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (2405) Google Scholar). The role of the recently described thrombin pathway (10Huber-Lang M. Sarma J.V. Zetoune F.S. Rittirsch D. Neff T.A. McGuire S.R. Lambris J.D. Warner R.L. Flierl M.A. Hoesel L.M. Gebhard F. Younger J.G. Drouin S.M. Wetsel R.A. Ward P.A. Nat. Med. 2006; 12: 682-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (769) Google Scholar) for immune defense needs to be worked out. C. albicans activates both the alternative and classical pathways of complement (11Kozel T.R. Weinhold L.C. Lupan D.M. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 3360-3368Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). C3b molecules bind directly to the C. albicans surface or via mannan-specific IgG antibodies, which occur naturally in human serum (12Zhang M.X. Kozel T.R. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 4845-4850Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Upon entry into a human host, any microbe is attacked by the host complement system. However, pathogenic microbes control complement activation at their surface. This type of complement escape is mediated either by the acquisition of host regulators to the surface of the pathogen or by expression of endogenous complement regulators (13Zipfel P.F. Skerka C. Hellwage J. Jokiranta S.T. Meri S. Brade V. Kraiczy P. Noris M. Remuzzi G. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2002; 30: 971-978Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). An increasing number of pathogenic microbes utilize host complement regulators for immune evasion and for down-regulation of complement activation. For the yeast C. albicans, acquisition of the central fluid phase alternative pathway regulators Factor H and FHL-1 and the classical pathway regulator C4BP have been demonstrated (14Meri T.

In their bound configuration these host proteins maintain their regulatory activities and protect the microbes against complement-mediated phagocytosis and lysis. For several pathogens the ligands for the host regulators have been identified and include classical virulence factors like the M protein of S. pyogenes. Factor H- and FHL1-binding proteins of C. albicans have been proposed (13Zipfel P.F. Skerka C. Hellwage J. Jokiranta S.T. Meri S. Brade V. Kraiczy P. Noris M. Remuzzi G. Biochem. Soc.

For detection of C3b degradation products, a polyclonal goat anti-C3 antiserum (Calbiochem) was used. Recombinant CaGpm1p was detected with PentaHis antiserum (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Factor H, Factor I, and C3b were obtained from Calbiochem, uPA was from Chemicon (Hofheim, Germany), and plasminogen was from Chromogenix (Milano, Italy). enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay phosphate-buffered saline room temperature bovine serum albumin short consensus repeats urokinase-type plasminogen activator ϵ-aminocaproic acid Expression of Recombinant Proteins—The C. albicans phosphoglycerate mutase gene CaGPM1 was amplified by PCR using genomic DNA from strain SC5314 and primers S1 (5′-GAATTCGTATGCCAAAGTTAGTTTTAGT-3′) and S2 (5′-TCTAGATATTTCTTTTGACCTTGAGCAG-3′); EcoRI and XbaI restriction sites are underlined. The resulting 760-bp DNA fragment contained the complete CaGPM1 coding region flanking an additional EcoRI and a XbaI restriction site. The DNA fragment was subcloned into Escherichia coli cloning vector pCR4Blunt-TOPO (Invitrogen) and subsequently cloned into the EcoRI and XbaI sites of the Pichia pastoris vector pPICZαB (Invitrogen). CaGpm1p was recombinantly expressed as a His-tagged protein in P. pastoris strain X33. Protein expression was induced with 1% methanol. After 3 days of expression the culture supernatant was harvested, and recombinant CaGpm1p was precipitated with 80% ammonium sulfate. FHL-1 (SCR 1-7) and recombinant deletion constructs of Factor H (SCRs 1-5, SCRs 1-6, SCRs 8-11, SCRs 11-15, SCRs 15-18, and SCRs 19 and 20) were expressed in the baculovirus system as described (26Kuhn S. Zipfel P.F. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 162: 225-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). All recombinant proteins were purified by nickel affinity chromatography using HisTrap columns in anÁkta fast protein liquid chromatography system (GE Healthcare) and concentrated in PBS using Vivaspin 15R concentrators with a cut off of 10 kDa (Vivascience, Hannover, Germany). Protein Binding Assays—The ProtoArray Yeast Proteome PPI kit (Invitrogen), representing 4088 purified recombinant yeast proteins of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, spotted onto a glass slide, was used to identify Factor H- and FHL-1-binding proteins. Arrays were probed either with Factor H or FHL-1 (6 μg each), and bound proteins were detected with fluorescence-labeled antibodies. The arrays were scanned using a fluorescent microarray scanner (Gene Pix 4000B, Molecular Devices). Significant interactions were identified by analyzing the acquired data with the ProtoArray Prospector software (Invitrogen). Additional arrays were probed exclusively with the antibodies to identify background reactivity. For ELISA CaGpm1p (0.25 μg in carbonate-bicarbonate buffer, Sigma) was immobilized onto a microtiter plate (half-area plate, Corning) at RT overnight. Nonspecific binding sites were blocked with PBS containing 2% BSA for 2 h at RT. After incubation with the ligand protein (0.75 μg) for 2 h at RT, wells were washed 3 times with PBS-T buffer (PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20) and incubated with primary antiserum (1:1000 dilution in blocking solution) for 1 h at RT. After washing with PBS-T, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antisera (1:2000 dilution in blocking solution) were added and incubated for 1 h at RT. After washing, substrate o-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride (Sigma) was added. The reaction was stopped with 2 m H2SO4, and the optical density was measured at 490 nm in an ELISA plate reader (SpektraMax 190, Molecular Devices). Immunofluorescence Assays and Flow Cytometry—C. albicans yeast or hyphal cells (108) were incubated at RT for 30 min in PBS supplemented with 2% BSA. After blocking of nonspecific binding sites, the cells were incubated at 4 °C overnight with rabbit anti-CaGpm1p antiserum or with preimmune serum (1:50 dilution). After incubation, cells were washed 3 times with blocking buffer. A goat anti-rabbit antiserum labeled with Alexa 488 was added at a dilution of 1:200 in blocking buffer at RT. Cells were again washed three times and examined with a laser scanning microscope (LSM 510 META, Zeiss). C. albicans yeast cells were analyzed by flow cytometry. After incubation at 4 °C for 30 min with CaGpm1p antiserum (1:100 dilution in 1% BSA-PBS), C. albicans yeast cells were washed with PBS supplemented with 1% BSA (1% BSA-PBS). Alexa Flu- or ® 488-labeled goat anti-rabbit serum was used as secondary antibody (1:200 dilution in 1% BSA-PBS). After incubation at 4 °C for 30 min, the cells were washed with 1% BSA-PBS and examined by flow cytometry (LSR II, BD Biosciences). Forward and sideward scatters were used for the identification of the cells, and fluorescent events of 10,000 cells were counted. Preparation of C. albicans Cytoplasmic and Cell Wall Fraction—For cell wall fraction preparation C. albicans was grown in a YPD preculture at 30 °C overnight. Afterward, C. al-bicans cells were cultivated in Soll's medium (27Swoboda R.K. Bertram G. Delbruck S. Ernst J.F. Gow N.A. Gooday G.W. Brown A.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 13: 663-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), pH 4.5, at 30 °C overnight followed by growth in Soll's medium, pH 6.5, at 37 °C for 45 min. The cells were harvested by centrifugation and stored at -20 °C. After resuspending the pellet in PBS supplemented with 25 mm DTT and 12.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (final concentrations), the cells were lysed by glass beads in a Mini-BeadBeater (Biospec Products) followed by three freeze and thaw cycles. For the isolation of cytoplasmic proteins, cell lysate of the C. albicans null mutant and the wild type strain was centrifuged, and the supernatant was collected. Cell debris was resuspended in PBS and again centrifuged. This step was repeated 10 times. Proteins derived from cell wall pellet were extracted by reducing loading buffer Roti-Load1 (Roth, Karlsruhe, Germany) incubated at 99 °C for 5 min and then separated by SDS-PAGE. Cofactor Assay—Cofactor activity of CaGpm1p-bound complement regulators Factor H and FHL-1 was performed as described (15Meri T. Hartmann A. Lenk D. Eck R. Wurzner R. Hellwage J. Meri S. Zipfel P.F. Infect. Immun. 2002; 70: 5185-5192Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). CaGpm1p was coated to the surface of a microtiter plate (half-area plate, Corning), and Factor H (0.2 μg/well) or FHL-1 (0.2 μg/well) was bound to this matrix. After extensive washing with PBS, C3b (0.4 μg/well) and Factor I (0.8 μg/well) were added. After the incubation at 37 °C the supernatant was separated by SDS-PAGE, and C3 degradation products were analyzed by Western blot using an anti-C3 antiserum and a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse serum as secondary antibody. Disruption and Reintegration of CaGPM1 Gene—The CaGPM1 gene was disrupted using the hisG-URA3-hisG cassette (28Fonzi W.A. Irwin M.Y. Genetics. 1993; 134: 717-728Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The 5′ region of CaGPM1 was amplified by PCR using chromosomal DNA of C. albicans SC5314 as a template and primers SP1-SacI (5′-ATATATCGAGCTCGTTAGATCACCTTTTACTCTCAAG-3′, position -354 to -330) and SP2-KpnI (5′-ATATATGCGGTACCATCAAAGGATAATTGGAGCAAGG-3′, position -29 to -25) (underlined sequences are complementary to the genomic sequence of the CaGPM1 gene). The resulting 325-bp PCR product was digested with SacI/KpnI and cloned into the disruption vector pMB7, yielding plasmid pG0 (28Fonzi W.A. Irwin M.Y. Genetics. 1993; 134: 717-728Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Primer SP3 SalI (5′-ATATATGCGTCGACCTTGGCCCGAACTGAAGAATTCA-3′, position +748 to +771) and primer SP4 PstI (5′-ATAAATGACTGCAGGATATAAGTGTCGATGATTCTAG-3′, position +837 to +814) were used to amplify the 3′ region. The 334-bp product was digested with SalI and PstI and cloned into plasmid pG0, resulting in pG1. For gene disruption, plasmid pG1 was treated with SacI and PstI. The 3.3-kilobase SacI/PstI fragment of plasmid pG1 containing the URA-blaster flanked by short sequences from the 5′ and 3′ ends of CaGPM1 and portions of the promotor and terminator, respectively, was used to transform C. albicans Ura- strain CAI-4. Transformation was performed in the presence of lithium acetate. After selection on Sabouraud (1% (w/v) peptone (casein), 2% (w/v) glucose) medium, the resulting Ura+ transformants were examined for gene replacement by PCR and Southern analysis. In the first step one allele of CaGPM1 was replaced by the hisG-URA3-hisG cassette (CAP1). Strain CAP1 was plated on 5-fluoroorotic acid-containing medium for isolation of Ura- segregants (CAP2). A second transformation with the same disruption construct led to the isolation of a Cagpm1 null mutant (CAP3) on Sabouraud-GE (1% (w/v) peptone (casein), 3% (w/v) glycerol, 2% (w/v) ethanol) plates. Again, Ura- segregants were selected (CAP4). For homologous reintegration of the CaGPM1 gene, CaGPM1 was amplified by PCR with primer SP1-SacI (5′-ATATATCGAGCTCGTTAGATCACCTTTTACTCTCAAG-3′, position -354 to -330) and SP5-KpnI (5′-ATATATGCGGTACCCTTAATTTCTGAGTCTAACAGAAC-3′, position +866 to +842). The resulting 1220-bp PCR product was SacI/KpnI-digested and cloned into the disruption vector pMB7, yielding plasmid pG2. Primer SP6 SalI (5′-ATATATGCGTCGACTGTAATGTGGATGTTAGTTTGCT-3′, position +868 to +891) and primer SP7 PstI (5′-ATAAATGACTGCAGCAATTGGTAACTCAATATATACTC-3′, position +1200 to +1176) were used to amplify the downstream region. This resulting 332-bp product was digested with SalI and PstI and cloned into plasmid pG2, yielding pG3. CaGPM1 was reintroduced into the null mutant strain CAP4 by transformation with the 5.6-kilobase SacI/PstI insert of pG3 that harbors the CaGPM1 gene, upstream as well as downstream regions for homologous recombination, and the URA3 gene as a selectable marker, and yielded CAP5. Candida ELISA—For Candida ELISAs, C. albicans yeast cells from an overnight culture were washed with PBS, diluted into carbonate-bicarbonate buffer (Sigma) to 1 × 107 cells/ml and immobilized onto a microtiter plate (MaxiSorb, Nunc) at 4 °C overnight. After washing with PBS-T buffer once, nonspecific binding sites were blocked with PBS containing 1× Roti-Block (Roth) for 2 h at RT. After incubation with 20% normal human serum/EDTA (normal human serum/diluted in blocking solution supplemented with 0.05% Tween 20 (Block-T) and 10 mm EDTA) for 1 h at 37 °C, wells were washed 3 times with PBS-T and incubated with primary antiserum (1:1000 dilution in Block-T) for 1 h at RT. After washing with PBS-T buffer, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antisera (1:1000 dilution in Block-T) were added and incubated for 1 h at RT. After washing, substrate o-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride (Sigma) was added. The reaction was stopped with 2 m H2SO4, and the optical density was measured at 490 nm in an ELISA plate reader (SpektraMax 190, Molecular Devices). Activation of Plasminogen and Assaying Plasmin Activity—Plasmin activity was measured as described (29Bergmann S. Rohde M. Preissner K.T. Hammerschmidt S. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2005; 94: 304-311PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, recombinant CaGpm1p (0.25-2 μg) was immobilized onto the surface of a microtiter plate (half-area plate, Corning). After blocking with PBS containing 2% BSA, plasminogen (0.6 μg/well) was added for 2 h at RT. Unbound plasminogen was removed by washing with PBS/substrate buffer. Plasminogen activator uPA (4 ng/well) and chromogenic substrate S-2251 (d-valyl-leucyl-lysine-p-nitroanilide dihydrochloride, Sigma; 150 μg/well) in 0.32 m Tris-HCl, 1.77 m NaCl, pH 7.5, were added. Plasmin activity was measured at 37 °C in intervals of 30 min by recording the absorbance at 405 nm (SpektraMax 190, Molecular Devices). Identification of ScGpm1p as a Factor H- and FHL-1-binding Protein—We have previously shown that host complement regulators Factor H and FHL-1 bind to the pathogenic yeast C. albicans (15Meri T. Hartmann A. Lenk D. Eck R. Wurzner R. Hellwage J. Meri S. Zipfel P.F. Infect. Immun. 2002; 70: 5185-5192Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). To identify yeast proteins that bind Factor H and FHL-1, a protein microarray representing 4088 recombinant proteins of the related yeast S. cerevisiae was used, and four Factor H-binding (YDR047W, YKL152C, YGR191W, YBL024W) and three FHL-1-binding (YDR047W, YKL152C, YBL024W) proteins were identified. All three FHL-1-binding proteins do also bind Factor H, and YGR191W binds specifically Factor H but not FHL-1. Spot YKL152C, which bound both Factor H and FHL-1, represents the phosphoglycerate mutase ScGpm1p (Fig. 1A). The C. albicans homologue CaGpm1p showed the highest homology to the S. cerevisiae protein (78%). Because this protein was recently identified as a plasminogen-binding protein (30Crowe J.D. Sievwright I.K. Auld G.C. Moore N.R. Gow N.A. Booth N.A. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 47: 1637-1651Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar), it was selected for further analyses. To confirm this interaction, the Gpm1p of C. albicans was cloned and recombinantly expressed in the yeast P. pastoris. The culture supernatant and various fractions obtained by nickel chelate chromatography were separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by silver staining (Fig. 1B). Two prominent bands of 36 and 31 kDa were detected in the supernatant and the elute fraction. Western blotting with α-His antiserum identified the 36-kDa band as the recombinant CaGpm1p protein (Fig. 1B, lane 5), suggesting that the second 31-kDa band represents a degradation product that lacks the His tag. CaGpm1p Binds Human Plasma Proteins—Binding of Factor H and FHL-1 to recombinant CaGpm1p was assayed by ELISA. CaGpm1p was immobilized to the microtiter plate, and purified Factor H and FHL-1 were added. Both immune regulators bound to CaGpm1p. CaGpm1p was recently identified as a plasminogen-binding protein (30Crowe J.D. Sievwright I.K. Auld G.C. Moore N.R. Gow N.A. Booth N.A. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 47: 1637-1651Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar), and this interaction was confirmed for the recombinant yeast protein. The classical pathway regulator C4BP did not bind to immobilized CaGpm1p (Fig. 2). Factor H and FHL-1 as well as plasminogen bound to recombinant immobilized CaGpm1p. Mapping of the Binding Regions in Factor H and FHL-1—To localize binding sites for CaGpm1p within the two host regulators, recombinant deletion constructs of FHL-1 and of Factor H representing SCRs 1-5, SCRs 1-6, SCRs 1-7/FHL-1, SCRs 8-11, SCRs 11-15, SCRs 15-18, and SCRs 19 and 20 (26Kuhn S. Zipfel P.F. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 162: 225-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) were tested for CaGpm1p binding. FHL-1 (SCRs 1-7) and SCRs 1-6 did bind to immobilized CaGpm1p, but SCRs 1-5 showed rather weak binding. In addition, recombinant deletion constructs of Factor H SCRs 19 and 20 did clearly bind, whereas SCRs 15-18 bound to a smaller extent. Constructs SCRs 8-11 and SCRs 11-15 did not bind (Fig. 3A). Based on these results it is concluded that FHL-1 has one interacting region with CaGpm1p, located in SCRs 6 and 7 (region I). Factor H has two binding regions, one shared with FHL-1 and a second region (region II) located in the C terminus, i.e. SCRs 19 and 20 (Fig. 3B). In the ELISA assays region I binds with higher intensity than region II. Lysine-dependent Binding of Plasminogen to CaGpm1p—To characterize the CaGpm1p plasminogen interaction in more detail we analyzed the role of the lysine analogue ϵ-aminocaproic acid (ϵACA). ϵACA inhibited plasminogen binding to CaGpm1p in a dose-dependent manner. Inhibition of about 20% was observed with 0.1 mm ϵACA, and maximal inhibition (>90%) was observed with 10 mm of the inhibitor (Fig. 4). Thus, binding of plasminogen to CaGpm1p is mediated by lysine residues. CaGpm1p Is a Surface Protein of C. albicans—To confirm CaGpm1p expression on the surface of intact C. albicans, an antiserum was raised against the recombinant yeast protein. Confocal laser scanning microscopy showed expression of CaGpm1p on the surface of intact C. albicans yeast cells (Fig. 5A, upper, left panel). Staining was particularly prominent on the tip of the hyphae (Fig. 5A, lower, left panel). In addition, surface localization of CaGpm1p is demonstrated by flow cytometry (Fig. 5B). Furthermore, the native 27.5-kDa CaGpm1p protein was identified in the cytoplasmic fraction and also in a cell wall extract by Western blotting using the specific antiserum (Fig. 5C, lanes 1 and 2). Preimmune serum showed no reactivity (data not shown). To exclude contamination of the cell wall fraction with intracellular proteins, the presence of the intracellular protein γ tubulin was assayed. Staining for the 53-kDa γ tubulin is detected in the cytoplasmic but not in the cell wall fraction (Fig. 5C, bottom panel), thus, demonstrating that the cell wall extract is free of major cytoplasmic contaminants. In summary, three independent methods show expression of CaGpm1p at the surface of C. albicans. Generation of a C. albicans gpm1 Null Mutant Strain—To verify the role of CaGpm1p in the binding of Factor H, FHL-1, and plasminogen to C. albicans, a Cagpm1 knock-out mutant was generated using the Ur"
https://openalex.org/W2008065215,"DExD/H-box proteins are ubiquitously involved in RNA-mediated processes and use ATP to accelerate conformational changes in RNA. However, their mechanisms of action, and what determines which RNA species are targeted, are not well understood. Here we show that the DExD/H-box protein CYT-19, a general RNA chaperone, mediates ATP-dependent unfolding of both the native conformation and a long-lived misfolded conformation of a group I catalytic RNA with efficiencies that depend on the stabilities of the RNA species but not on specific structural features. CYT-19 then allows the RNA to refold, changing the distribution from equilibrium to kinetic control. Because misfolding is favoured kinetically, conditions that allow unfolding of the native RNA yield large increases in the population of misfolded species. Our results suggest that DExD/H-box proteins act with sufficient breadth and efficiency to allow structured RNAs to populate a wider range of conformations than would be present at equilibrium. Thus, RNAs may face selective pressure to stabilize their active conformations relative to inactive ones to avoid significant redistribution by DExD/H-box proteins. Conversely, RNAs whose functions depend on forming multiple conformations may rely on DExD/H-box proteins to increase the populations of less stable conformations, thereby increasing their overall efficiencies."
https://openalex.org/W2021907631,"Programmed cell death (PCD) is involved in a variety of biologic events. Based on the morphologic appearance of the cells, there are two types of PCD as follows: apoptotic (type I) and autophagic (type II). However, the molecular machinery that determines the type of PCD is poorly defined. The purpose of this study was to show whether the presence of the cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor p21WAF1/CIP1, a modulator of apoptosis, determines which type of PCD the cell undergoes. Treatment with C2-ceramide was associated with both the cleavage of caspase-3 and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase and the degradation of autophagy-related Beclin 1 and Atg5 proteins, without a change in the cyclin-CDK activity, which culminated in apoptosis in p21+/+ mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). On the other hand, C2-ceramide did not cleave caspase-3 or poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase and kept Beclin 1 and Atg5 proteins stable in p21-/- MEFs, events that this time culminated in autophagy. When expression of the p21 protein was inhibited by small interfering RNA or when the overexpression of Beclin 1 or Atg5 was induced, autophagy rather than apoptosis was initiated in the p21+/+ MEFs treated with C2-ceramide. In contrast, the exogenous expression of p21 or the silencing of Beclin 1 and Atg5 with small interfering RNA increased the number of apoptotic cells and decreased the number of autophagic cells among C2-ceramide-treated p21-/- MEFs. γ-Irradiation, which endogenously generates ceramide, induced a similar tendency in these MEFs. These results suggest that p21 plays an essential role in determining the type of cell death, positively for apoptosis and negatively for autophagy."

https://openalex.org/W2016542252,"N-Methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptors are tetrameric protein complexes composed of the glycine-binding NR1 subunit with a glutamate-binding NR2 and/or glycine-binding NR3 subunit. Tri-heteromeric receptors containing NR1, NR2, and NR3 subunits reconstitute channels, which differ strikingly in many properties from the respective glycine- and glutamate-gated NR1/NR2 complexes and the NR1/NR3 receptors gated by glycine alone. Therefore, an accurate oligomerization process of the different subunits has to assure proper NMDA receptor assembly, which has been assumed to occur via the oligomerization of homodimers. Indeed, using fluorescence resonance energy transfer analysis of differentially fluorescence-tagged subunits and blue native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis after metabolic labeling and affinity purification revealed that the NR1 subunit is capable of forming homo-oligomeric aggregates. In contrast, both the NR2 and the NR3 subunits formed homo- and hetero-oligomers only in the presence of the NR1 subunit indicating differential roles of the subunits in NMDA receptor assembly. However, co-expression of the NR3A subunit with an N-terminal domain-deleted NR1 subunit (NR1ΔNTD) abrogating NR1 homo-oligomerization did not affect NR1/NR3A receptor stoichiometry or function. Hence, homo-oligomerization of the NR1 subunit is not essential for proper NR1/NR3 receptor assembly. Because identical results were obtained for NR1ΔNTD/NR2 NMDA receptors (Madry, C., Mesic, I., Betz, H., and Laube, B. (2007) Mol.

Excitatory neurotransmission in the mammalian brain is mainly mediated by ionotropic glutamate receptors (iGluRs). 4The abbreviations used are:iGluRionotropic glutamate receptorAMPA(RS)-2-amino-3-(3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolyl)propionic acidBN-PAGEblue native PAGECFPcyan fluorescent proteinEeffective FRET efficiencyFRETfluorescence resonance energy transferHEKhuman embryonic kidneyImaxmaximal currentNMDAN-methyl-d-aspartic acidNTDN-terminal domainYFPyellow fluorescent proteinECFPenhanced CFPEYFPenhanced YFPwtwild typePNGasepeptide:N-glycosidase FDTTdithiothreitolTricineN-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine Based on pharmacological studies, iGluRs have been grouped into three distinct subfamilies: (RS)-2-amino-3-(3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolyl)propionic acid (AMPA) receptors, kainate receptors, and N-methyl-d-aspartic acid (NMDA) receptors (1Cull-Candy S. Brickley S. Farrant M. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2001; 11: 327-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (1414) Google Scholar). All iGluR subunits share a common modular design of four distinct regions: (i) an extracellular N-terminal domain (NTD) of about 400 amino acids sharing homology with the bacterial leucine-, isoleucine-, and valine-binding protein, implicated to play a role in iGluR oligomerization and modulation, (ii) an extracellular S1S2 ligand binding domain sharing homology with the bacterial glutamine-binding protein that binds agonists in a Venus-flytrap like mechanism, (iii) a membrane-associated domain composed of four membrane segments forming the ion channel, and (iv) an intracellular C-terminal domain involved in linking the receptor to the membrane scaffold and signal transduction proteins (2Madden D.R.

Brickley S. Farrant M. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2001; 11: 327-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (1414) Google Scholar). Cloning of NMDA receptor subunits revealed that the glycine-binding NR1 subunit is a single gene product occurring in eight splice variants (a–h), whereas the glutamate-binding NR2 and the glycine-binding NR3 subunits are encoded by four (NR2A–NR2D) and two (NR3A and -B) different genes, respectively (1Cull-Candy S. Brickley S. Farrant M. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2001; 11: 327-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (1414) Google Scholar). The so-called “conventional” type of NMDA receptors is a tetrameric membrane protein composed of two NR1 and NR2 subunits, each (3Laube B. Kuhse J. Betz H. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 2954-2961Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), that requires both glutamate and the co-agonist glycine for channel activation (4Johnson J.W. Ascher P.

Studies on native and recombinant iGluRs suggest that their subunits assemble in a two-step mechanism as dimer of dimers (9Ayalon G. Stern-Bach Y. Neuron. 2001; 31: 103-113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 10Schorge S. Colquhoun D. J. Neurosci. 2004; 23: 1151-1158Crossref Google Scholar, 11Tichelaar W.

For the conventional NMDA receptor it has been suggested that receptor assembly occurs via dimerization of an NR1 and an NR2 homodimer (10Schorge S. Colquhoun D. J. Neurosci. 2004; 23: 1151-1158Crossref Google Scholar, 13Papadakis M. Hawkins L.M. Stephenson F.A. J. Biol.

However, subunit oligomerization and assembly of NR3 containing NMDA receptor is not completely understood, and many questions remain unanswered. Here, using fluorescently and His-tagged NR1, NR2, and NR3 subunits in combination with fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET), blue native PAGE (BN-PAGE) and electrophysiological recordings, we analyzed oligomerization intermediates of the different subunits after heterologous expression in HEK cells and Xenopus oocytes. Our results support the idea that NR1/NR2 or NR1/NR3 heterodimers are intermediate states of NMDA receptor assembly and that subunit composition of tetrameric NMDA receptors is defined by a dimer of heterodimers. Reagents—All reagents were obtained from RBI Sigma (Taufkirchen, Germany). DNA Constructs, Oocyte Expression, and Electrophysiology—The cDNAs of NMDA receptor subunits NR1-1a (rat), NR2A (mouse), NR2B (mouse) (15Kuryatov A. Laube B. Betz H. Kuhse J. Neuron. 1994; 12: 1291-1300Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar), and NR1-1a (mouse) kindly provided by Dr. Seeburg and NR3A (rat) kindly provided by Dr. Woodward were subcloned into enhanced cyan fluorescent protein (ECFP) and into enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (EYFP) expression vectors, pECFP-N1 and pEYFP-N1 to generate the C-terminally tagged fusion constructs NR1-YFP, NR1-CFP, NR2A-YFP, NR2A-CFP, NR2B-YFP, NR2B-CFP, NR3A-YFP, and NR3A-CFP (see also Fig. 1A). Appropriate restriction sites were introduced by site-directed mutagenesis (QuikChange XL Site-directed Mutagenesis Kit, Stratagene, CA) and confirmed by DNA sequencing as follows: SacI/BamHI for NR1, NheI/BamHI for NR2A, KpnI/BglII for NR2B, and SalI/BamHI for NR3A. Subsequently, the resulting fragments were ligated in-frame with the vectors. To generate N-terminally tagged fusion constructs CFP-NR1 and YFP-NR1, the NR1 subunit cDNA was subcloned into ECFP and EYFP expression vectors, pECFP-C1 and pEYFP-C1 (Clontech). A signal peptide sequence was introduced 5′ of the CFP and YFP coding sequences. All constructs were verified by DNA sequencing, electrophysiological recordings, and imaging techniques. The NR1ΔNTD construct was generated by excising the nucleotide sequence encoding for amino acids 23–376 with the restriction endonuclease PvuI. For biochemical characterization in Xenopus oocytes, NR1, NR2, and NR3 cDNAs were provided with a C-terminal hexahistidyl tag and subcloned into the pNKS2 oocyte expression vector (16Grudzinska, J., Schemm, R., Häger, S., Nicke, A., Schmalzing, G., Betz, H., and Laube, B. (2005) 45, 727–739Google Scholar). In vitro synthesis of cRNA (mCAP mRNA Capping Kit, Ambion) was performed as described (6Madry C. Mesic I. Bartholomäus I. Nicke A. Betz H. Laube B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2007; 354: 102-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). For the expression of NMDA receptors, 25 ng of cRNA/oocyte was injected. Xenopus laevis oocytes were isolated and maintained as described (17Laube B. Kuhse J. Rundstrom N. Kirsch J. Schmieden V. Betz H. J. Physiol. 1995; 483: 613-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Two-electrode voltageclamp recording of glutamate- and glycine-induced whole cell currents was performed according to a previous study (18Laube B. Hirai H. Sturgess M. Betz H. Kuhse J. Neuron. 1997; 18: 493-503Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). Transfection of HEK293 Cells—The culture conditions for human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells (ATCC#CRL1537) and the protocols for transfection with Lipofectamine® 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol have been described previously (19Laube B. Kuhse J. Betz H. J. Physiol. 2000; 522: 215-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). HEK293 cells were grown in minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 1% (v/v) penicillin-streptomycin (5000 units), 1% (v/v) glutamine and maintained at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 environment. For transfection cells were plated onto fibronectin (Roche Applied Science)-coated 1-cm glass coverslips for transfection placed in 24-well dishes and maintained in supplement free minimal essential medium. Unless stated otherwise, 0.25 μg of DNA of each construct were used per transfection. Transfected cells were cultured in the presence of the NMDA receptor inhibitor MK801 (100 μm) for 48 h. Cells were fixed 18 h after transfection with 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 12 min at room temperature. Non-CFP- or -YFP-tagged NMDA receptor subunits (NR2A-PCIS and NR1-pCis) were antibody labeled after fixation using primary antibodies to the NR1 subunit (1:200, BD Biosciences) and NR2A/B (1:200, Chemicon) and secondary antibody to mouse and rabbit respectively, labeled with Alexa 546 fluorophore. After fixation cells were permeabilized in 0.01 (w/v) Triton X-100 (Serva, Heidelberg, Germany) for 3 min followed by incubation in 2% (w/v) serum albumin for 30 min before processing for immunofluorescence. Detection and Calculation of FRET Efficiencies Using Acceptor Photo-bleaching—Fluorescence signals were detected with a confocal laser scanning microscope type Leica TCS-SP (Wetzlar, Germany) using dual laser excitation at 458 nm (ECFP) and 514 nm (EYFP) and emission windows of 470–495 nm for ECFP and 565–580 nm for EYFP controlled by the image software Leica-TCS-NT version 1.6.551. All fluorescence data were collected with a 63× objective. Effective FRET efficiency (%) between eCFP (donor) and eYFP (acceptor) was measured with acceptor photo-bleaching methods and quantified using the equation as described previously (20Zimmermann T. Rietdorf J. Girod A. Georget V. Pepperkok R. FEBS Lett. 2002; 531: 245-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Images of the donor were obtained before and after bleaching of the acceptor in a selected square (see Fig. 1B). Fluorescence intensities of the donor in this square before and after bleaching were used to calculate the FRET efficiencies according to a previous study (20Zimmermann T. Rietdorf J. Girod A. Georget V. Pepperkok R. FEBS Lett. 2002; 531: 245-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). The bleaching procedure was unchanged for all experiments. Briefly, 514 nm laser intensity was adjusted to a value not influencing donor emission as was confirmed in cells that were only transfected with CFP fusion constructs. The acceptor was bleached with 10 successive scans to 80–100% to levels comparable to non-transfected neighboring cells. Metabolic Labeling and Purification of Hexahistidyl-tagged Proteins from Xenopus Oocytes—X. laevis oocytes were injected with 50-nl aliquots of cRNA (0.5 μg/μl). cRNA-injected and non-injected control oocytes were metabolically labeled by overnight incubation with l-[35S]methionine (>40 TBq/mmol, Amersham Biosciences) at ∼100 MBq/ml (0.2 MBq per oocyte) in sterile ND96 solution (96 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1mm MgCl2, and 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) at 18 °C and chased with 10 mm unlabeled methionine after 24 h as indicated. His-tagged NR1 and NR3A proteins were then purified by Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen) chromatography from n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside (0.5%, w/v) extracts of oocytes as detailed previously (21Sadtler S. Laube B. Lashub A. Nicke A. Betz H. Schmalzing G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16782-16790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Shortly, oocytes were homogenized in 0.1 m phosphate buffer (20 μl per oocyte) containing 0.4 mm Pefabloc SC (Fluka, Buchs, Switzerland) and the indicated detergent (n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside, ULTROL Grade, Calbiochem-Novabiochem GmBH, Bad Soden, Germany). The homogenate was incubated on ice for 15 min, and the extract was then cleared by centrifugation (10 min at 15,000 rpm in a desktop centrifuge). 100 μl of the clear supernatant were diluted with 400 μl of the above buffer and supplemented with 30 μl of Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose beads and 10 mm imidazole. After 30 min of incubation under continuous inversion, the agarose-bound proteins were washed 4 times with 1 ml of phosphate buffer containing 0.1% n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside, 0.08 mm Pefabloc SC, and 30 mm imidazole. Subsequently, the proteins were released from the Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose beads with non-denaturing elution buffer consisting of 0.5% (w/v) n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside, 100 mm imidazole/HCl (pH 7.8), 20 mm Tris-HCl, and 10 mm EDTA and kept at 0 °C until analyzed by PAGE. For the biochemical determination of subunit stoichiometry, oocytes injected with NR1 and NR3 (wt or His-tagged) subunit cRNAs at the ratios indicated were labeled and purified by Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid chromatography as described above. The purified protein was then separated on 10% Tricine-SDS-PAGE gels, which were fixed, dried, and exposed to PhosphorImager screens. The radioactivity of individual [35S]methionine-labeled polypeptide bands was quantified using a PhosphorImager (445 SI, Amersham Biosciences) and evaluated using the software package Image-QuaNT as described (16Grudzinska, J., Schemm, R., Häger, S., Nicke, A., Schmalzing, G., Betz, H., and Laube, B. (2005) 45, 727–739Google Scholar). BN-PAGE and SDS-PAGE—BN-PAGE was carried out as described (22Schägger H. Cramer W.A. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 217: 220-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (1043) Google Scholar). Just before gel loading, purified proteins were supplemented with blue native sample buffer to a final concentration of 10% glycerol, 0.2% Serva blue G, and 20 mm sodium 6-amino-n-capronate, and applied onto polyacrylamide gradient gels. As a size standard, molecular mass markers (Amersham Biosciences) were run in two different lanes on both borders of the gel. This resulted in incomplete separation and thus poor correlation with the molecular mass marker but enabled separation of a wide range of protein sizes in a short time. For SDS-PAGE, protein samples were supplemented with SDS sample buffer containing 20 mm dithiothreitol (DTT) and electrophoresed in parallel with molecular mass markers (Precision Plus Protein All Blue Standard, Bio-Rad) on 10% Tricine-SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Gels were blotted, fixed, dried, and exposed to BioMax MR films (Kodak, Stuttgart, Germany) at –80 °C. Surface Protein Labeling Using Fluorescent Dyes—After 4 days in culture, oocytes expressing NR1 and NR3A-His subunits were incubated for 20 min at 4 °C in 65 nmol/oocyte of the Cy-NHS-ester dye Cy5 (Amersham Biosciences) in phosphate buffer (20 mm Na2HPO4/NaH2PO4, pH 8.5; 110 mm NaCl; 1 mm MgCl2). After washing NMDA receptor complexes were purified as described above. Gels containing Cy5-labeled protein samples were scanned with a gel imager (Typhoon 9400, Amersham Biosciences) as described (6Madry C. Mesic I. Bartholomäus I. Nicke A. Betz H. Laube B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2007; 354: 102-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Glycosylation Analysis—For analysis of the glycosylation status, 10-μl aliquots of affinity-purified receptor protein were supplemented with reducing (20 mm DTT) SDS sample buffer and 1% (w/v) octylglucoside (Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA) and incubated for 2 h at 37 °C with either 5 International Union of Biochemistry (IUB) milliunits of endoglycosidase H or PNGase F (New England Biolabs GmBH, Frankfurt, Germany) as indicated. Statistical Analysis—Results represent means ± S.D. and were analyzed using GraphPad Prism version 4.0 (GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, CA). Statistical significance was assessed using one-way analysis of variance with the Newman-Keul multiple comparison test for post hoc comparison of the results obtained from the FRET analyses and considered to be statistically significant at p < 0.05. Statistical significance of electrophysiological data was determined at the p < 0.05 (*) and p < 0.01 (**) levels using a Student's two-tailed t test. In this study, a biophysical and biochemical approach based on FRET and BN-PAGE was used to investigate the role of the NR1, NR2, and NR3 subunits in NMDA receptor oligomerization. For this purpose, spectral variants of the green fluorescent protein were fused to either the C or N terminus of NMDA receptor subunits and analyzed by measuring FRET after acceptor photo-bleaching combined with confocal microscopy (23Kenworthy A.K. Methods. 2001; 24: 289-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). Furthermore, BN- and SDS-PAGE analyses of metabolically labeled and under non-denaturating conditions purified NMDA receptor complexes were performed to verify the FRET data by independent biochemical approaches. Differentially Tagged NR1 Subunits Show a FRET Signal, Indicative for Homo-oligomerization—In an initial set of experiments we calibrated our FRET detection system by analyzing two appropriate controls (i) to quantify the maximal detectable FRET efficiency and (ii) to avoid false-positives of FRET signals by acceptor bleaching (24Karpova T.S. Baumann C.T. He L. Wu X. Grammer A. Lipsky P. Hager G.L. McNally J.G. J. Microscopy. 2003; 209: 56-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). We expressed two types of constructs for our controls: (i) a negative control expressing only the soluble enhanced cyan fluorescence (CFP) and enhanced yellow fluorescence (YFP) constructs and (ii) a positive control expressing a CFP-linker-YFP tandem construct, known to provide a strong energy transfer (20Zimmermann T. Rietdorf J. Girod A. Georget V. Pepperkok R. FEBS Lett. 2002; 531: 245-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 24Karpova T.S. Baumann C.T. He L. Wu X. Grammer A. Lipsky P. Hager G.L. McNally J.G. J. Microscopy. 2003; 209: 56-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). For the CFP-YFP tandem construct, we detected a FRET efficiency of E = 17.8 ± 2.1%, which is similar to results found in the literature (12Qiu S. Hua Y.L. Yang F. Chen Y.Z. Luo J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 24923-24930Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 20Zimmermann T. Rietdorf J. Girod A. Georget V. Pepperkok R. FEBS Lett. 2002; 531: 245-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 24Karpova T.S. Baumann C.T. He L. Wu X. Grammer A. Lipsky P. Hager G.L. McNally J.G. J. Microscopy. 2003; 209: 56-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). However, co-expression of the soluble CFP and YFP constructs as a negative control yielded a FRET efficiency of E = 5.1 ± 0.6%, a phenomenon previously also described as pseudo-FRET (24Karpova T.S. Baumann C.T. He L. Wu X. Grammer A. Lipsky P. Hager G.L. McNally J.G. J. Microscopy. 2003; 209: 56-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). FRET efficiencies similar to this background signal were subsequently defined as nonspecific association of the respective constructs. Based on recent biochemical and biophysical results indicating a homo-oligomerization of the recombinant NR1 subunit upon single expression (12Qiu S. Hua Y.L. Yang F. Chen Y.Z. Luo J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 24923-24930Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 13Papadakis M. Hawkins L.M. Stephenson F.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 14703-14712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), we first analyzed the FRET efficiency of combinations of two differentially tagged NR1 subunits with opposing intra- and extracellular localized fluorophores (Fig. 1). Co-expression of CFP- and YFP-N-terminally tagged NR1 subunits (CFP-NR1 and YFP-NR1, respectively) with an extracellular orientation of the respective fluorophores revealed a highly significant FRET efficiency of E = 8.7 ± 1.0% compared with our negative control (Fig. 1; p < 0.001). Co-expression of NR1 subunits with both fluorophores fused to the intracellular oriented C terminus (NR1-CFP and NR1-YFP), again resulted in a strong FRET efficiency of E = 10.2 ± 0.7% (p < 0.001 (Table 1 and Figs. 1 and 2). In contrast, combining the extracellularly tagged CFP-NR1 with the intracellularly tagged NR1-YFP subunit or vice versa resulted in highly significantly reduced FRET efficiencies (NR1-CFP/YFP-NR1: E = 4.7 ± 0.4%; CFP-NR1/NR1-YFP: E = 3.0 ± 1.1% (Table 1 and Fig. 1)), which were similar to the results obtained with the soluble constructs of CFP and YFP (p > 0.05 for both). These data are (i) consistent with a proper insertion and orientation of our fluorophores relative to the membrane and (ii) in line with recent data showing an homo-oligomerization of the NR1 subunit in heterologous expression systems (12Qiu S.

Open table in a new tab To confirm that our method indeed detects specific subunit interactions mediated by subunit assembly, we measured the FRET efficiency between an N-terminally tagged GluR2 subunit, a member of the AMPA-subtype iGluR family, and the NR1 subunit. Both iGluR subunits co-localize in postsynaptic densities but do not co-assemble (1Cull-Candy S. Brickley S. Farrant M. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2001; 11: 327-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (1414) Google Scholar). Consistent with an efficient homo-oligomerization of the GluR2 subunit, co-expression of the N-terminally tagged CFP-GluR2 and YFP-GluR2 subunits revealed a FRET efficiency of E = 8.5 ± 0.9%, which is similar to the signal obtained with the respective CFP-NR1 and YFP-NR1 subunits. In contrast, co-expression of the CFP-NR1 and the YFP-GluR2 subunit resulted in a highly significant reduced FRET efficiency of E = 4.0 ± 1.3% (p < 0.01), a value not statistically different from our negative control (p > 0.5). These data showed that (i) NR1 and GluR2 subunits do not oligomerize and (ii) our method allows us to discriminate between randomly co-localized and properly assembled subunits of AMPA- and NMDA-receptor subtypes. NR2 and NR3 Constructs Display FRET Signals Only after Co-expression with the NR1 Subunit—After demonstrating self-association of the NR1 subunit and based on the assumption that NMDA receptor assembly occurs in a dimer of homodimer fashion (10Schorge S. Colquhoun D. J. Neurosci. 2004; 23: 1151-1158Crossref Google Scholar, 12Qiu S. Hua Y.L. Yang F. Chen Y.Z. Luo J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 24923-24930Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), we expected that co-expression of NR3A-YFP and NR3A-CFP constructs would result in a strong FRET signal. However, co-expression of these constructs did not result in a significant FRET signal (E = 4.8 ± 0.7%, p > 0.5 (Fig. 2 and Table 1)), suggesting that (i) our C-terminal constructs of the NR3A subunit may not be capable to induce FRET, (ii) the expressed NR3A subunits became rapidly degraded, or (iii) an additional subunit is required for efficient oligomerization. To test the assumptions mentioned above, we first wanted to know whether our fluorescently tagged NR1 and NR3A constructs are capable of forming functional hetero-oligomeric channels (6Madry C. Me"
https://openalex.org/W1986514138,"Mia40p and Erv1p are components of a translocation pathway for the import of cysteine-rich proteins into the intermembrane space of mitochondria. We have characterized the redox behavior of Mia40p and reconstituted the disulfide transfer system of Mia40p by using recombinant functional C-terminal fragment of Mia40p, Mia40C, and Erv1p. Oxidized Mia40p contains three intramolecular disulfide bonds. One disulfide bond connects the first two cysteine residues in the CPC motif. The second and the third bonds belong to the twin CX9C motif and bridge the cysteine residues of two CX9C segments. In contrast to the stabilizing disulfide bonds of the twin CX9C motif, the first disulfide bond was easily accessible to reducing agents. Partially reduced Mia40C generated by opening of this bond as well as fully reduced Mia40C were oxidized by Erv1p in vitro. In the course of this reaction, mixed disulfides of Mia40C and Erv1p were formed. Reoxidation of fully reduced Mia40C required the presence of the first two cysteine residues in Mia40C. However, efficient reoxidation of a Mia40C variant containing only the cysteine residues of the twin CX9C motif was observed when in addition to Erv1p low amounts of wild type Mia40C were present. In the reconstituted system the thiol oxidase Erv1p was sufficient to transfer disulfide bonds to Mia40C, which then could oxidize the variant of Mia40C. In summary, we reconstituted a disulfide relay system consisting of Mia40C and Erv1p.

Precursors of proteins containing cleavable matrix targeting sequences followed by transmembrane segments are initially using the general import pathway mediated by the TIM23 (translocase of the inner membrane 23) complex until the transmembrane segment reaches the inner membrane where it undergoes translocation arrest. By a subsequent proteolytic step the mature protein is released into the IMS. On the other hand, there are many proteins of relatively small size that lack presequences but contain motifs of conserved cysteine residues, such as the twin CX9C motif in the copper chaperone Cox17p and in Cox19p, Mdm35p, Mic14p, and Mic17p or the twin CX3C motif in the family of small Tim proteins (6Beers J.

In fungi, the large hydrophilic IMS domain of Mia40p is anchored to the inner membrane by an N-terminal transmembrane segment. In animals and plants, Mia40 is present as a much shorter soluble protein (21Hofmann S. Rothbauer U. Muhlenbein N. Baiker K. Hell K. Bauer M.F. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 353: 517-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). All homologs harbor a highly conserved domain of about 60 amino acid residues. This domain contains six invariant cysteine residues in a CPC-CX9C-CX9C arrangement. Replacement of a cysteine pair either in the CPC or in one of the CX9C segments with a pair of serine residues was lethal, indicating the crucial role of the cysteine residues for the function of Mia40p (13Naoe M.

Although not directly shown so far, this suggests a transfer of disulfide bonds from Mia40p to the interacting IMS proteins. The generation of intramolecular disulfide bonds has been proposed to trigger folding of substrates and thereby trapping of imported substrates in the IMS (26Lu H. Allen S. Wardleworth L. Savory P. Tokatlidis K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 18952-18958Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 27Herrmann J.M. Kohl R. J. Cell Biol. 2007; 176: 559-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Two redox forms of Mia40p have been detected in mitochondria, an oxidized and a reduced form. The oxidized form of Mia40p is required for the import of substrates into mitochondria (15Mesecke N. Terziyska N. Kozany C. Baumann F. Neupert W. Hell K. Herrmann J.M. Cell. 2005; 121: 1059-1069Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar).Mia40p works together with Erv1p in the import pathway of small IMS proteins. Erv1p belongs to the class of FAD-containing sulfhydryl oxidases which transfer electrons from thiols to non-thiol electron acceptors and thereby generate disulfide bonds in proteins (28Sevier C.S. Kaiser C.A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 836-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar, 29Coppock D.L. Thorpe C. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2006; 8: 300-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Indeed, thiol oxidase activity has been measured for Erv1p in vitro (30Lee J. Hofhaus G. Lisowsky T. FEBS Lett. 2000; 477: 62-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 31Hofhaus G. Lee J.E. Tews I. Rosenberg B. Lisowsky T. Eur. J.

Herrmann J.M. Cell. 2005; 121: 1059-1069Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). Moreover, Erv1p interacts with Mia40p via disulfide bonds (15Mesecke N. Terziyska N. Kozany C. Baumann F. Neupert W. Hell K. Herrmann J.M. Cell. 2005; 121: 1059-1069Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar, 16Rissler M. Wiedemann N. Pfannschmidt S. Gabriel K. Guiard B. Pfanner N. Chacinska A. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 353: 485-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that Erv1p and Mia40p form a disulfide relay system to generate intramolecular disulfide bonds in the small IMS proteins. In such a pathway, the role of Erv1p would be to transfer disulfide bonds to Mia40p to regenerate oxidized Mia40p. The pathway for the generation of disulfide bonds in the mitochondria appears to differ from the disulfide relay systems in the endoplasmic reticulum and the bacterial periplasm (33Nakamoto H. Bardwell J.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1694: 111-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 34Kadokura H. Katzen F. Beckwith J. Annu. Rev.

Acta. 2004; 1699: 35-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar), because Mia40p has apparently no homologs in these compartments.The redox cycle of Mia40p, in particular the molecular basis of the redox states of Mia40p and the identity and function of its disulfide bonds, have not been determined. Likewise, the generation of disulfide bonds in Mia40p and the shuttle of disulfide bonds between Mia40p and Erv1p have not been analyzed. Here we describe the isolation and characterization of a recombinant domain of Mia40p (Mia40C) which contains all cysteine residues of complete Mia40p. This domain is catalytically functional. In the oxidized form of Mia40C, all cysteine residues are present as intramolecular disulfide bonds. The pattern of these bonds was determined by mass spectrometry. The disulfide bonds connecting two CX9C segments stabilize Mia40p, and the redox-sensitive disulfide bond between the first two cysteine residues has a crucial function for the disulfide exchange reactions with Erv1p and substrate proteins. In a reconstituted system the reduced form of Mia40C was oxidized in a reaction catalyzed by recombinant Erv1p. Our results demonstrate that Erv1p and its substrate Mia40p are sufficient to form a functional disulfide relay system.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPlasmids and Yeast Strains—To generate pGEX-6P-1-Mia40C, amino acid residues 284–403 of Mia40p were amplified by polymerase chain reaction using the primers Mia40For850BamH1 (5′-CTCGGATCCGCTTATAACCCAGACACTGG-3′) and Mia40Sc_StBglXho (5′-CTCCTCGAGAGATCTTTAAGGTTTGGATTCCTCATTC-3′) and the plasmid pGEM4-Mia40 as template. The PCR fragment was cloned into the vector pGEX-6P-1 (GE Healthcare) using BamHI and XhoI as restriction sites. The cysteines Cys-1 and -2 of Mia40p were changed to serines by a PCR reaction using the primers Mia40For571SpeI (5′-GAAGATAATACTAGTGACAAAAC-3′) and Mia40Rev-C1,2S (5′-GGGTCCATGGGCCATACCTCCCAAGGAAGGAGAGTCCCAATTTATCTCACC-3′) and the plasmid pVTU102-Mia40-His8 (14Terziyska N. Lutz T. Kozany C. Mokranjac D. Mesecke N. Neupert W. Herrmann J.M. Hell K. FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 179-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) as template. The resulting construct was digested with SpeI and NcoI and cloned into pGEM4-Mia40-His. To generate pGEX-6P-1-Mia40C-C1,2S the plasmid pGEM4-Mia40-His-C1,2S was used as a template for amplification of a fragment with the primers Mia40For850BamH1 and Mia40Sc_StBglXho. After digestion with BamHI and XhoI, this fragment was cloned into the vector pGEX-6P-1. The strain expressing Mia40C in the wild type background was generated in the diploid strain YPH501 by replacing the nucleotides –4 to 849 of one allele of MIA40 with a GAL10 promotor-containing cassette followed by the coding sequence of eight histidine residues by homologous recombination.Expression and Purification of Mia40C and Erv1p from Escherichia coli—To obtain recombinant Mia40C, E. coli XL1blue cells containing the plasmid pGEX-6P1 expressing glutathione S-transferase (GST)-Mia40C or GST-Mia40C-C1,2S were grown in 3 liters of LB medium at 37 °C to A600 nm of 0.5–0.8. Isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was then added to a final concentration of 1 mm, and bacterial growth was continued for 5 h. The induced cell culture was centrifuged, washed, and resuspended in 60 ml of buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and 0.2 mg/ml lysozyme. Cells were disrupted by sonification and centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant containing glutathione S-transferase-Mia40C was applied to a column with 8 ml of glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with buffer A. The column was washed with 20 volumes of buffer A. The beads were then resuspended with 30 ml of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 200 mm NaCl. Prescission protease was added to a final concentration of 0.05 mg/ml. After incubation for 3 h at 30 °C, the cleaved Mia40C protein was removed. The fraction removed contained Mia40C and forms of Mia40C which were linked by intermolecular disulfide bonds. To obtain a homogenous fraction of monomeric Mia40C, the protein was loaded on a Superdex 75 gel filtration column for further purification. Erv1p-His6 was expressed in the E. coli strain BL21 (DE3) and purified as described (30Lee J. Hofhaus G. Lisowsky T. FEBS Lett. 2000; 477: 62-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar).4-Acetamido-4′-maleimidylstilbene-2,2′-disulfonic Acid (AMS) Alkylation Assay—Purified Mia40C (15–35 μm) in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 40 mm NaCl was preincubated at 25 or 95 °C with 5 mm DTT or left untreated. Samples were incubated for 30–60 min at 25 °C in the presence or absence of 15–30 mm concentrations of the thiol-specific reagent AMS (Invitrogen). AMS reacts with free thiol groups, resulting in a mobility shift of the protein on SDS-PAGE due to its increase in size of 0.5 kDa per added molecule AMS. SDS-PAGE sample buffer with or without 80 mm DTT was then added, and the samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and staining with Coomassie Blue.Redox Reactions with Recombinant Proteins—In the reconstitution experiments of the Mia40p-Erv1p disulfide transfer system, various redox forms of Mia40C were used. To generate the partially reduced Mia40p containing two free thiol groups, the protein was incubated in the presence of 5 mm DTT for 10 min at 25 °C. Then DTT was removed by gel filtration using a NAP5 column (GE Healthcare). The protein was eluted in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 40 mm NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA. Fully reduced Mia40p was obtained by heat denaturation of the protein for 10 min at 95 °C in the presence of 5 mm DTT. DTT was removed as described above. In the reconstitution experiments the indicated redox form of Mia40C was mixed with Erv1p in the amounts depicted and incubated for the indicated times at room temperature. Then the redox states of Mia40C were analyzed by modification with AMS and subsequent SDS-PAGE and staining with Coomassie Blue. The reactions were performed under microanaerobic conditions in a nitrogen-filled glove bag.HPLC and Mass Spectrometry—For the mass spectrometry (MS) analysis, proteins or enzymatically digested peptides were injected on a reverse-phase chromatograph column, PepMap C18 0.3/15 (LC Packings, Sunnyvale, CA), and eluted with a 35-min linear gradient of acetonitrile in water (5–50%) containing 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid with a flow rate of 4 ml/min. The MS analysis was performed on-line with a LCQ Deca XP ion-trap spectrometer equipped with an electrospray ionization source (ThermoFinnigan, San Jose, CA). The LCQ was operated in positive mode under manual control in the Tune Plus view with default parameters and active automatic gain control. MS/MS analysis was done to confirm the sequence of the precursor ions using low energy collision-induced dissociation with relative collision energy of 35%.CD Spectroscopy—Far-ultraviolet CD measurements were performed using a Jasco J-715 spectrometer. Final CD spectra were obtained by averaging four consecutive scans, and the secondary structure content was estimated.RESULTSRecombinant Mia40p C-terminal Domain Is Folded—To characterize Mia40p, we purified a truncated form of Mia40p consisting of amino acid residues 284–403, Mia40C (Fig. 1, A and B). This segment of Mia40p was sufficient to confer viability to yeast cells when targeted to the intermembrane space of mitochondria lacking authentic Mia40p. 3N. Terziyska and K. Hell, unpublished data. It contains that part of the protein which is conserved throughout the eukaryotic kingdom (12Chacinska A. Pfannschmidt S. Wiedemann N. Kozjak V. Sanjuan Szklarz L.K.

Herrmann J.M. Hell K. FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 179-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). All six cysteine residues of Mia40p are present in this protein segment (Fig. 1A). We analyzed the protein by CD spectroscopy. This revealed folding of the protein with a content of 30% α-helical structure (Fig. 1C). Furthermore, folding was demonstrated by partial resistance of the purified protein against added protease. Upon treatment with trypsin a fragment of about 9.8 kDa was generated (Fig. 1D). According to analysis by mass spectrometry, this fragment consisted of amino acid residues 284–367. Thus, the tightly folded domain contains the highly conserved cysteine residues of Mia40p.Mia40p Contains Three Disulfide Bonds with Different Sensitivity to Reducing Agents—In mitochondria, Mia40p is mainly present in an oxidized state (15Mesecke N. Terziyska N. Kozany C. Baumann F. Neupert W. Hell K. Herrmann J.M. Cell. 2005; 121: 1059-1069Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). Upon treatment with DTT, a reduced form of Mia40p was generated that displays a slower mobility than the oxidized form upon non-reducing SDS gel electrophoresis. The Mia40C protein was used to characterize the redox states of Mia40p. To this end, purified Mia40C was incubated with the agent AMS, which reacts with free thiol groups. Modification of thiol groups by AMS can be detected by SDS gel electrophoresis, since the modification results in an increase of the molecular mass of the protein by 0.5 kDa per AMS bound. An altered molecular mass of the purified Mia40C protein was not observed upon treatment with AMS (Fig. 2A, lane 2). This lack of free thiol groups points to a fully oxidized protein with three disulfide bonds. After incubation with the reducing agent DTT, a shift in the electrophoretic mobility of the Mia40C protein was observed, indicating its modification by AMS (lane 4). An even larger shift of Mia40C was detected when the protein was incubated at 95 °C in the presence of DTT before AMS treatment (lane 6). Obviously not all disulfide bonds could be reduced without heat denaturation. Partially reduced Mia40C appeared to be modified by two molecules of AMS, indicating the presence of two thiol groups and two disulfide bonds. Heat denaturation under reducing conditions generated fully reduced Mia40C. The observed mobility shift of this species was larger than expected for a completely reduced Mia40C protein modified with six AMS molecules, indicating an unusual running behavior of modified Mia40C.FIGURE 2Disulfide bonds in Mia40C with different sensitivity to reducing agents. A, redox states of purified Mia40C. Mia40C was incubated with 5 mm DTT at 25 or 95 °C or left untreated. Then samples were treated with or without 30 mm AMS for 30 min, subjected to reducing SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by Coomassie Blue staining. The estimated numbers of bound AMS are depicted. B, redox states of Mia40C in mitochondria. Mitochondria were isolated from cells expressing Mia40C. After lysis in 4% SDS, mitochondrial extract was incubated with 10 mm DTT at 25 or 95 °C or left untreated. Proteins were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid, resuspended in buffer containing 2% SDS, and treated in the presence or absence of 15 mm AMS. Samples were analyzed by non-reducing SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining. C, sensitivity of Mia40C to trypsin in different states of reduction. Mia40C was incubated at 25 or 95 °C in the presence or absence of 5 mm DTT and then treated with trypsin (0.05 mg/ml) for 20 min at 25 °C. After blocking trypsin activity, samples were analyzed by reducing SDS-PAGE on a urea gel and Coomassie Blue staining. f, trypsin-resistant fragment.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We checked whether the redox states observed with the recombinant protein reflect the redox behavior of Mia40p in mitochondria. Mia40C was expressed in wild type cells, and its redox states were analyzed. In mock-treated mitochondria most of Mia40C was not modified by AMS. After treatment with DTT, Mia40C was partially reduced and modified by AMS (Fig. 2B). In addition, heat denaturation in the presence of DTT resulted in a large shift of electrophoretic mobility indicating full reduction of Mia40p. Thus, the redox states of the protein in mitochondria are very similar to those seen with the isolated protein.To determine the number of disulfide bonds and their redox sensitivity, we measured the molecular mass of Mia40C in the presence and absence of reducing agent and the thiol-modifying reagent NEM by mass spectrometry (Table 1). Untreated Mia40C had a measured molecular mass of 13,842.2 Da, which is 6 Da less than the calculated mass for the theoretical sequence of completely reduced Mia40. This supports the presence of all the cysteines in the oxidized state forming three disulfide bonds. Consistent with the lack of free thiols, treatment with NEM did not alter its molecular mass. A molecular mass of 13,848.8 Da corresponding to fully reduced Mia40C was observed when the sample was treated at 95 °C in the presence of DTT. Modification of this sample with NEM resulted in a mass of 14,598.8 Da (a mass difference of 750 Da to the fully reduced Mia40p), corresponding to the covalent addition of six NEM molecules (i.e. 125 Da/NEM molecule). Thus, under these conditions, Mia40C was fully reduced. In contrast, when Mia40C was treated with DTT at room temperature, Mia40C was only partially reduced. Its molecular mass of 13,844.2 Da suggests that partially reduced Mia40C contains two free thiol groups and, still, two disulfide bonds. Modification of this sample with NEM resulted in a mass of 14,094.6 Da, confirming the presence of two thiol groups.TABLE 1Assignment of redox states of Mia40p by mass spectrometryTreatmentMeasured molecular massCalculated molecular massModificationNo. disulfide bondsRedox stateDaDaNone13,842.213,842.43OxidizedNone + NEM (100 eq)13,842.113,842.40 NEM3Oxidized10 min of 100 mm DTT, 95 °C13,848.813,848.40Reduced10 min of 100 mm DTT, 95 °C, + NEM (200 mm + 100 eq)14,598.814,599.16 NEM0Reduced30 min of 1 mm DTT13,844.213,844.42Partially reduced30 min of 1 mm DTT + NEM (2 mm + 100 eq)14,094.614,094.62 NEM2Partially reduced Open table in a new tab In summary, the results demonstrate the presence of three disulfide bridges in Mia40C.

https://openalex.org/W2021777472,"Background Obtaining a complete phenotypic characterization of a freely moving organism is a difficult task, yet such a description is desired in many neuroethological studies. Many metrics currently used in the literature to describe locomotor and exploratory behavior are typically based on average quantities or subjectively chosen spatial and temporal thresholds. All of these measures are relatively coarse-grained in the time domain. It is advantageous, however, to employ metrics based on the entire trajectory that an organism takes while exploring its environment. Methodology/Principal Findings To characterize the locomotor behavior of Drosophila melanogaster, we used a video tracking system to record the trajectory of a single fly walking in a circular open field arena. The fly was tracked for two hours. Here, we present techniques with which to analyze the motion of the fly in this paradigm, and we discuss the methods of calculation. The measures we introduce are based on spatial and temporal probability distributions and utilize the entire time-series trajectory of the fly, thus emphasizing the dynamic nature of locomotor behavior. Marginal and joint probability distributions of speed, position, segment duration, path curvature, and reorientation angle are examined and related to the observed behavior. Conclusions/Significance The measures discussed in this paper provide a detailed profile of the behavior of a single fly and highlight the interaction of the fly with the environment. Such measures may serve as useful tools in any behavioral study in which the movement of a fly is an important variable and can be incorporated easily into many setups, facilitating high-throughput phenotypic characterization."
https://openalex.org/W2050489832,"Splicing of fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR2) alternative exons IIIb and IIIc is regulated by the auxiliary RNA cis-element ISE/ISS-3 that promotes splicing of exon IIIb and silencing of exon IIIc. Using RNA affinity chromatography, we have identified heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein M (hnRNP M) as a splicing regulatory factor that binds to ISE/ISS-3 in a sequence-specific manner. Overexpression of hnRNP M promoted exon IIIc skipping in a cell line that normally includes it, and association of hnRNP M with ISE/ISS-3 was shown to contribute to this splicing regulatory function. Thus hnRNP M, along with other members of the hnRNP family of RNA-binding proteins, plays a combinatorial role in regulation of FGFR2 alternative splicing. We also determined that hnRNP M can affect the splicing of several other alternatively spliced exons. This activity of hnRNP M included the ability not only to induce exon skipping but also to promote exon inclusion. This is the first report demonstrating a role for this abundant hnRNP family member in alternative splicing in mammals and suggests that this protein may broadly contribute to the fidelity of splice site recognition and alternative splicing regulation.

This is the first report demonstrating a role for this abundant hnRNP family member in alternative splicing in mammals and suggests that this protein may broadly contribute to the fidelity of splice site recognition and alternative splicing regulation. Alternative splicing represents an important mechanism whereby a single gene transcript can give rise to numerous spliced mRNAs, thereby greatly expanding the ribonomic and proteomic diversity that can be obtained from a limited gene number (1Black D.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2003; 72: 291-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (1947) Google Scholar, 2Matlin A.J. Clark F. Smith C.W. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 386-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (959) Google Scholar). Despite increasing recognition that the majority of metazoan gene transcripts are subject to alternative splicing, the molecular mechanisms that regulate this process remain poorly understood. This is particularly true for alternatively spliced gene transcripts that display tightly regulated expression of distinct splice variants in different cell types or at different stages of development. The constitutive splicing process is directed by consensus sequences at the 5′ and 3′ splice sites as well as a branch point sequence generally located 20–40 nucleotides (nt) 2The abbreviations used are:ntnucleotide(s)FGFR2fibroblast growth factor receptor 2ISEintronic splicing enhancerISSintronic splicing silencerhnRNPheterogeneous ribonucleoproteinCELFCUG-BP and ETR-3-like factorBis-Tris2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diolRTreverse transcriptionPPTpreprotachykinin. 2The abbreviations used are:ntnucleotide(s)FGFR2fibroblast growth factor receptor 2ISEintronic splicing enhancerISSintronic splicing silencerhnRNPheterogeneous ribonucleoproteinCELFCUG-BP and ETR-3-like factorBis-Tris2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diolRTreverse transcriptionPPTpreprotachykinin. upstream of the 3′ splice site. However, these sequence determinants are not sufficient to accurately specify the actual splice sites that are used for splicing of constitutive as well as alternative exons. In recent years, numerous studies have demonstrated an important role for an additional layer of cis-acting control sequences often referred to as auxiliary cis-elements (2Matlin A.J. Clark F. Smith C.W. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 386-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (959) Google Scholar, 3Ladd A.N. Cooper T.A. Genome Biology. 2002; http://genomebiology.com/2002/3/11/reviews/0008PubMed Google Scholar). These sequences have been identified in both exons and introns and can have either positive or negative effects on splicing of a given exon. As such they are commonly referred to as exonic splicing enhancers or silencers and intronic splicing enhancers or silencers (ISEs or ISSs). These elements function largely through the activity of RNA-binding proteins that associate with them and influence the efficiency with which nearby splice sites are recognized by the basal splicing machinery. Most alternatively spliced exons are associated with multiple auxiliary cis-elements that can positively or negatively affect its inclusion. These observations have led to models of combinatorial control, in which the splicing outcome is determined by the net effect of several cis-elements that interact with differentially expressed RNA-binding proteins in varied cellular milieus (1Black D.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2003; 72: 291-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (1947) Google Scholar, 2Matlin A.J. Clark F. Smith C.W. Nat. Rev. Mol.

Sci. 2000; 25: 381-388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar). Although several cell-type-specific factors have previously been described, differential expression of such factors alone has not proven sufficient to account for cell-type-specific splicing decisions, which also involve contributions from ubiquitously expressed regulatory factors. Thus a challenge in the field of splicing regulation has been to determine the different contributions of numerous cis-elements and RNA-binding proteins and how their combined functions yield distinct splicing patterns in different cells.Our studies have focused on alternative splicing of fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR2) transcripts. Mutually exclusive splicing of two exons, IIIb and IIIc, gives rise to two functionally different receptors, FGFR2-IIIb and FGFR2-IIIc, in epithelial and mesenchymal cells, respectively. These exons encode the C-terminal half of an Ig-like domain in the receptor's extracellular domain in a region that determines ligand-binding specificity. Consequently, the two different receptor isoforms display distinct binding preferences for the FGF family of ligands (5Ornitz D.M. Xu J. Colvin J.S. McEwen D.G. MacArthur C.A. Coulier F. Gao G.

Several auxiliary cis-elements that have been shown to play a role in regulation of these alternative exons are shown in Fig. 1A. Although several abundant and ubiquitously expressed factors, including polypyrimidine tract-binding protein, TIA-1, and hnRNP A1, have been shown to bind to several of these elements and play a role in splicing regulation, the mechanism by which cell-type-specific alternative splicing of this transcript occurs has not been fully elucidated (7Carstens R.P.

We have focused our recent studies on an element we have termed ISE/ISS-3, so named because it has been shown to promote splicing of exon IIIb (as an ISE) and at the same time to repress splicing of exon IIIc (as an ISS) in epithelial cells (9Hovhannisyan R.H. Carstens R.P. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 25: 250-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 15Hovhannisyan R.H. Warzecha C.C. Carstens R.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: 373-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Thus in cells that express FGFR2-IIIb (e.g. DT3 cells) deletion of this element in transfected FGFR2 minigenes results in a partial switch from exon IIIb splicing to exon IIIc splicing, whereas the exclusive inclusion of exon IIIc in cells that express FGFR2-IIIc (e.g. AT3 or 293T cells) is unaffected by the same deletion. We have also shown that this sequence displays epithelial cell-type-specific functions in a heterologous minigene context, suggesting that it may associate with at least one regulatory factor whose expression is limited to cells expressing FGFR2-IIIb (15Hovhannisyan R.H. Warzecha C.C. Carstens R.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: 373-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). In the present study we describe one of the proteins, heterogeneous ribonucleoprotein M (hnRNP M), that binds directly and specifically to the wild-type ISE/ISS-3 sequence. In a cell line that normally includes exon IIIc (293T), we determined that overexpression of hnRNP M induced exon IIIc skipping, suggesting that this factor plays a role in silencing of this exon in cells that express FGFR2 IIIb. Transfection studies using minigenes containing several unrelated alternative exons showed that hnRNP M can induce either exon skipping or exon inclusion in different contexts. Therefore, we have identified hnRNP M as a factor involved in FGFR2 splicing regulation, and we propose that this factor may also play a more general role in the regulation of diverse alternatively spliced metazoan gene transcripts.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPlasmid Construction—The plasmids and minigenes used in this study were constructed using standard cloning techniques. pI-11-FS, pI-11-FS-CXS, and pI-11-FS-CXS-IIIb Mut minigenes and their derivatives were previously described (9Hovhannisyan R.H. Carstens R.P. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 25: 250-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 16Muh S.J. Hovhannisyan R.H. Carstens R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50143-50154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The plasmid minigene containing the R35 (28Cooper T.A. Methods Mol. Biol. 1999; 118: 391-403PubMed Google Scholar) exon was generated by PCR of the R35 (28Cooper T.A. Methods Mol. Biol. 1999; 118: 391-403PubMed Google Scholar) plasmid (kindly provided by Thomas Cooper) using primers TNT-Xba-F (5′-GGCCTCTAGAGTCGAAGTCCTCACCTGGTG-3′) and TNT-Not-R (5′-GCGCGGCCGCACTAGTTTAGAGGGGAGAGCGC-3′). This amplified a SalI to SpeI segment from the original construct that contained the exon and cTNT-derived intronic sequences (17Cooper T.A. Mol. Cell Biol. 1998; 18: 4519-4525Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). This fragment was inserted into the XbaI and NotI sites of the pI-11(-H3)-PL vector (9Hovhannisyan R.H. Carstens R.P. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 25: 250-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), thereby positioning the exon between two adenoviral derived flanking exons. The preprotachykinin minigene pPPT-106 (kindly provided by Gil Cote) was previously described (18Jin W. Huang E.S. Bi W. Cote G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28035-28041Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). For in vitro transcription we modified the pDP19 vector (Ambion) by inserting the sequence 5′-GAATTATCGATCTCGAG-3′ between the EcoRI and HindIII sites to generate pDP19RC-ΔEE. This modification permitted insertion of ClaI/XhoI fragments containing ISE/ISS-3 (or control sequences) under the control of the T7 promoter for in vitro transcription. To obtain the 3×WT and 3×MT inserts, the two pairs of primers were kinased and annealed: 43nt-ISE3-Sal-Xho-F (5′-TCGACGTGTGGTGATGGGCCTGCAGAGGTGAGCTGGCCGGTGTCTCTCC-3′) with 43nt-ISE3-Sal-Xho-R (5′-TCGAGGAGAGACACCGGCCAGCTCACCTCTGCAGGCCCATCACCACACG-3′), and 43nt-3xGU Mut-Sal-Xho-F (5′-TCGACGTGTGACGATGGGCCTGCAGAGACGAGCTGGCCGACGTCTCTCC-3′) with 43nt-3xGU Mut-Sal-Xho-R (5′-TCGAGGAGAGACGTCGGCCAGCTCGTCTCTGCAGGCCCATCGTCACACG-3′). The annealed oligonucleotides were ligated, digested by XhoI and SalI, and separated on polyacrylamide gels to select three tandem copies of the sequence. Thus we obtained two new constructs, one containing three repeats of wild-type 43-nt sequence from ISE/ISS-3 (3×WT) and another containing three repeats of mutant 43-nt sequence from ISE/ISS-3 in which three GU-AC substitutions occurred in each repeat (3×MT) flanked by ClaI and XhoI sites (Fig. 1C). To create the templates for pulldown assays PCR of these sequences was performed to introduce a ClaI site at the 5′-end of the sequence, and the products were re-cloned as ClaI/XhoI fragments into the DP19RC-ΔEE plasmid. Similarly, the previously described “full-length” ISE/ISS-3, 5′-AC, and BS fragments were also inserted in pDP19RC-ΔEE (Fig. 1B). To make the construct for expression of hnRNP M, pIN-ΔInt-hnRNP M, an EcoRV-AgeI fragment from the pHCM4 construct (kindly provided by Maurice Swanson) was inserted in the previously described pIRESneo3-ΔInt vector (15Hovhannisyan R.H. Warzecha C.C. Carstens R.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: 373-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 19Newman E.A. Muh S.J. Hovhannisyan R.H. Warzecha C.C. Jones R.B. McKeehan W.L. Carstens R.P. RNA (N.Y.). 2006; 12: 1129-1141Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Generation of N-terminal FLAG-tagged hnRNP M was carried out by inserting the same EcoRV-AgeI fragment into the FLAG expression vector pINX-N-FF-B. The latter construct was derived by insertion of sequences encoding two tandem copies of the FLAG tag upstream of the multicloning site of pIRESneo3ΔInt (sequence available on request). All plasmid constructs were prepared with Qiagen MidiPrep kits. Sequences were confirmed by the University of Pennsylvania Sequencing Facility.UV Cross-linking—To prepare RNA probes for UV-cross-linking experiments we performed in vitro transcription with T7 RNA polymerase (Ambion) after digestion of the pDP-based plasmids with XhoI using the manufacturer's recommendations. The specific activity of the 169-nt RNA transcript was 2.7 × 1013 cpm/μmol. 500,000 cpm, or 19 fmol, of [32P]UTP-radiolabeled RNA substrates were incubated at 30 °C with 12–20 μg of KATO III or 293T cell nuclear extracts in a volume of 20 μl for 20 min in 1.5-ml Eppendorf tubes. The nuclear extracts from 293T cell transiently expressing the FLAG-tagged plasmids were generated by transfection of 5 μg of plasmid in 60-mm plates using TransIT-293 Transfection Reagent (Mirus) in accordance with manufacturer recommendations. 48 h after transfection, nuclear extracts were prepared following a previously described protocol (20Tsai A. Carstens R.P. Nat. Protoc. 2006; 1: 2820-2827Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). After incubation, the tubes were opened, placed on ice, and UV-irradiated in a Stratalinker 2400 (Stratagene) at a distance of 5 cm with an energy of 6000 μJ × 100. After addition of 2 μl of a stock RNase mix (10 mg/ml RNase A and 10 units/μl RNase T1) the samples were incubated at 37 °C for 60 min. Reactions were stopped with 4× LDS sample buffer (Invitrogen) and loaded onto 10% NuPAGE Bis-Tris gel (Invitrogen). The gel was run at constant 200 V for 60–70 min, then fixed, dried, and visualized by radiography.Immunoprecipitation of UV Cross-linked Proteins—Immunoprecipitation of UV-cross-linked proteins was carried out following the RNase step of the UV cross-linking protocol. Precipitation of endogenous hnRNP M from KATO III nuclear extracts was performed by first pre-clearing the UV-cross-linked extracts by addition to 30 μl of pre-washed Protein G-agarose (Roche Applied Science) in 450 μl of NET-2 buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 0.01% Nonidet P-40, 1× protease inhibitor (Sigma)) at 4 °C and rotation for 30 min. The pre-cleared supernatant was then harvested after centrifugation at 1000 × g for 1 min. 1.5 μl of hnRNP M antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) was added to the precleared extract and rotated at 4 °C for 60 min and then added to another 30 μl of pre-washed protein G-agarose and incubated for an additional 60 min. The beads were then washed three times with 500 μl of NET-2 buffer, and the precipitated proteins were eluted by addition of 20 μl of 2× sample loading buffer and boiling for 5 min. The mix was transferred to a Bio-Rad microspin column, centrifuged at 500 × g for 5 min, electrophoresed on 10% NuPAGE Bis-Tris gels, and analyzed by Western blotting. Immunoprecipitation of FLAG-tagged hnRNP M from transiently transfected 293T cell nuclear extracts was carried out by addition of the UV-cross-linked extracts to 40 μl of pre-washed anti-FLAG M2-agarose slurry (Sigma) in 400 μl of cold NET-2 buffer. After rotation at 4 °C for 60 min, the beads were washed twice with 400 μl of NET-2 buffer and eluted by incubating for 30 min with rotation at 4 °C with 10 μg of 3× FLAG peptide in 60 μl of NET-2 buffer. The eluted proteins were harvested using Bio-Rad microspin columns and analyzed by Western as described below.Affinity Purification—To obtain microgram quantities of unlabeled RNA for affinity chromatography in vitro transcription reactions were performed in a 50-μl volume containing 0.1 μg/μl linearized DNA template, 2 units/μl T7 RNA polymerase (Ambion), 7.5 mm NTPs, 0.1 unit/μl inorganic pyrophosphatase (Sigma), 0.4 unit/μl SUPERase-In (Ambion) in buffer containing 80 mm Hepes-KCl, pH 7.5, 24 mm MgCl2, 2 mm spermidine, and 40 mm dithiothreitol. The reaction mix was incubated overnight at 37 °C and RNA was gel-purified from 10% denaturing acrylamide gels. Pulldown assays were performed similar to previously described protocols (21Buratti E. Dork T. Zuccato E. Pagani F. Romano M. Baralle F.E. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1774-1784Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar, 22Caputi M. Freund M. Kammler S. Asang C. Schaal H. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 6517-6526Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), with the following modifications. A 200-μl reaction mixture containing 1 nmol of RNA, 100 mm NaOAc, pH 5.0, and 20 mm sodium m-periodate (Sigma) was incubated in the dark at room temperature for 1 h. The oxidized RNA was precipitated with ethanol and resuspended in 500 μl of 100 mm NaOAc, pH 5.0. 200 μl of adipic acid dehydrazide bead slurry (100 μl of packed beads, Sigma) were washed twice with 1 ml of 100 mm NaOAc, pH 5.0. The resuspended RNA was added to the beads and rotated overnight at 4 °C. The beads with bound RNA were then washed twice with 1 ml of 2 m NaCl and three times with 1 ml of Buffer D (23Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9143) Google Scholar) freshly supplemented with 0.5 mm dithiothreitol and 1× phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. A 1-ml final volume of a mix containing 500 μl of KATO III nuclear extract in the presence of 1.6 mm MgCl2, and 5 mg/ml heparin was added to the washed beads. After rotating for 30 min at room temperature the beads were washed four times with 1 ml of buffer D supplemented with 2 mm MgCl2 and 75 μg/ml heparin. The proteins were eluted by addition of 60 μl of 1.5× SDS loading buffer and heating at 90 °C for 5 min. Beads and buffer were transferred to Handee spin columns (Pierce) and centrifuged at 1000 × g for 1 min. Eluted samples were loaded on 4–12% NuPAGE Bis-Tris gel (Invitrogen). The gel was stained using either SilverSNAP (Pierce) or Colloidal Blue staining kit (Invitrogen), and the bands of interest were excised and submitted for analysis using tandem mass spectrometry performed by the University of Pennsylvania Proteomics Core Facility.Western Blotting—To detect antibodies against hnRNP M we used the standard technique described previously (24Geng J. Carstens R.P. Protein Expr. Purif. 2006; 48: 142-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), with modifications. The nitrocellulose filter was blocked with 2.5% Carnation milk overnight at 4 °C. The primary antibody was used at a 1:200 dilution for mouse monoclonal hnRNP M1–4 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or 1:1,000 dilution for monoclonal anti-FLAG M2 (Sigma). The secondary anti-mouse Ig, horseradish peroxidase-linked whole antibody (Amersham Biosciences) was used at a 1:10,000 dilution.Cell Culture, Transfection, RNA Purification, and RT-PCR Analysis—These procedures were performed as previously described (9Hovhannisyan R.H. Carstens R.P. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 25: 250-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). For transient co-transfections, 293T cells were co-transfected in 12-well plates with 2 μg of total amount of plasmid (1 μg of a minigene and either 0.3, 0.5, or 1.0 μg of pIN-ΔInt-hnRNP M, normalized to 1 μg with empty vector using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen)). RNA was harvested 48 h after transfection. RNA from stably transfected AT3 and DT3 cells was prepared after 2 weeks of growth in selective media. Quantification was performed using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager. Primers pI-11(-H3)-F and PIP11-R (16Muh S.J. Hovhannisyan R.H. Carstens R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50143-50154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) were used to assay for inclusion or skipping of exon IIIc and exon R35 (28Cooper T.A. Methods Mol. Biol. 1999; 118: 391-403PubMed Google Scholar) in pI-11-FS, pI-11-FS-CXS-IIIb-Mut, and pI-11-R35 (28Cooper T.A. Methods Mol. Biol. 1999; 118: 391-403PubMed Google Scholar) constructs and T7 (5′-TAATACGACTCACTATAGGG-3′) and Rat-PPT-Ex5-R (5′-GTGAGAGATCTGACCATGCC-3′) primers for assay of inclusion or skipping of PPT exon 4 in the pPPT-106 construct. Molar amounts of final products where alternatively spliced exons were either included or skipped were normalized using exon included/exon excluded ratios: 1:2.05 for pI-11-FS and pI-11-FS-CXS-IIIb Mut constructs; 1:1.21 for pI-XN-R35 (28Cooper T.A. Methods Mol. Biol. 1999; 118: 391-403PubMed Google Scholar); and 1:1.23 for pPPT-106.RESULTSIdentification of Sequences in the 5′ Half of ISE/ISS-3 That Are Sufficient to Promote Exon IIIb Inclusion and Exon IIIc Skipping in Cells That Express FGFR2-IIIb—Using stable transfection minigene assays, we previously carried out extensive mutational analysis of an 85-nt sequence constituting ISE/ISS-3 and determined that mutations or deletions within the 5′-end of the sequence were more detrimental to its function than alterations at the 3′-end (Fig. 1B) (9Hovhannisyan R.H. Carstens R.P. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 25: 250-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 15Hovhannisyan R.H. Warzecha C.C. Carstens R.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: 373-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). These experiments were carried out using an FGFR2 minigene, pI-11-FS-CXS, that contains both exons IIIb and IIIc and their flanking introns, but in which ISE/ISS-3 is deleted and replaced by two convenient restriction enzymes (Fig. 2A). Transfection of the DT3 cell line, which expresses endogenous FGFR2-IIIb, with pI-11-FS-CXS demonstrated predominant splicing of exon IIIc (Fig. 2B, lanes 1–3). Analysis of results with these minigenes, performed by RT-PCR using primers complementary to sequences in the exons flanking exons IIIb and IIIc, revealed a product of 386 or 383 bp depending on whether exon IIIb or exon IIIc was spliced, respectively. Because this size difference is difficult to distinguish, we digest these RT-PCR products separately with AvaI or HincII, which digest products containing exon IIIb or IIIc, respectively. Comparison of the fraction of products digested with these enzymes can therefore be used to determine the percentage of products that contain exon IIIb or IIIc. Transfection of a minigene in which ISE/ISS-3 has been restored to its normal position results in predominant splicing of exon IIIb and skipping of exon IIIc (Fig. 2B, lanes 4–6). Insertion of three tandem copies of the 43 nt that comprise the 5′ half of ISE/ISS-3 (3×WT) (Fig. 1C) likewise restores predominant exon IIIb inclusion (Fig. 2B, lanes 7–9). However, insertion of the same tandem copies containing the GU to AC mutations shown in Fig. 1C (3×MT) yields predominant exon IIIc splicing in transfected DT3 cells (Fig. 2B, lanes 10–12). Importantly, these results demonstrating the function of ISE/ISS-3 in promoting exon IIIb inclusion and exon IIIc skipping are only observed in cells that express endogenous FGFR2-IIIb. Transfection of these minigenes into cells that express endogenous FGFR2-IIIc (e.g. AT3 and 293T) results in exclusive splicing of exon IIIc, and this outcome is observed in either the presence or absence of ISE/ISS-3 (data not shown).FIGURE 2Tandem repeats of the 5′ half of ISE/ISS-3 mediate cell-type-specific activation of exon IIIb and silencing of exon IIIc. A, schematic of the pI-11-FS-CXS minigene. Boxes represent exons, and solid lines represent introns. Alternatively spliced exons with their sizes (in nt) are indicated as shaded boxes. The ClaI and XhoI sites in the parental vector replace ISE/ISS-3, and this plasmid version is thus designated “No insert.” U and D indicate heterologous adenoviral exons upstream and downstream of exons IIIb and IIIc, respectively. The 85-nt full-length ISE/ISS-3, 3×WT, or 3×MT sequences were inserted as indicated between the ClaI and XhoI sites. B, results of RT-PCR of RNA from DT3 cells stably transfected with the indicated minigenes. U, undigested product; A, product digested with AvaI; H, product digested with HincII, shown above each lane. M, molecular weight markers. The RT-PCR products that contain either exon IIIb or exon IIIc (U-B/C-D) or exclude these exons (U-D) are schematized at the right. The percent exon IIIb inclusion is indicated beneath results for each minigene. Quantification represents the percentage of products that include exon IIIb (the band remaining after HincII digestion) divided by the sum of these products and products, including exon IIIc (the band remaining after AvaI digestion).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Identification of hnRNP M as an ISE/ISS-3-binding Protein—Given the important role of ISE/ISS-3 in mediating cell-type-specific splicing of FGFR2 exon IIIb in lieu of exon IIIc, we carried out biochemical assays to identify factors that bound specifically to this regulatory element. To characterize protein factors that bind ISE/ISS-3 we initially carried out in vitro UV-cross-linking studies using radiolabeled RNAs containing the three tandem copies of the 5′ half of ISE/ISS-3 (3×WT), the same tandem copies containing mutations (3×MT), or unrelated control RNA sequences. For our studies, we used nuclear extracts prepared from a cell line, KATO III, that also expresses FGFR2-IIIb as such extracts are expected to express the full complement of factors required for expression of this isoform, including potential cell-type-specific factors (9Hovhannisyan R.H. Carstens R.P. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 25: 250-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). After UV-cross-linking and RNase digestion, SDS-PAGE analysis was carried out to identify the molecular masses of proteins that cross-linked to the 3×WT probe, but not to the 3×MT control. As shown in Fig. 3A, several proteins that cross-linked specifically to the 3×WT RNA were identified. These included bands of ∼110, 80, 70, 55, 50, and 20 kDa. To identify these proteins, we performed RNA affinity chromatography by covalently linking the same RNAs to adipic acid dihydrazide-agarose beads. After binding with KATO III nuclear extracts, the beads were washed, and bound proteins were eluted and analyzed on silver-stained SDS-PAGE gels. Although a number of proteins bound both the wild-type and mutant RNAs, several bands corresponding in size to those seen by cross-linking were noted to be more abundant in eluates from the wild-type ISE/ISS-3 RNA compared with the mutant or bead-alone controls. Among the latter were several proteins in the 70- to 80-kDa size range. This region of the gel was excised and submitted for tandem mass spectrometry (Fig. 3B). To further characterize those proteins that specifically bound the wild-type sequence, the same region of the gel containing proteins bound to the mutant control RNA was also excised and analyzed. Mass spectrometry analysis identified hnRNP M as the protein that matched the greatest number of peptides from"

https://openalex.org/W2161230062,"Root hair tip growth provides a unique model system for the study of plant cell polarity. Transgenic plants expressing constitutively active (CA) forms of ROP (Rho-of-plants) GTPases have been shown to cause the disruption of root hair polarity likely as a result of the alteration of actin filaments (AF) and microtubules (MT) organization. Towards understanding the mechanism by which ROP controls the cytoskeletal organization during root hair tip growth, we have screened for CA-rop2 suppressors or enhancers using CA1-1, a transgenic line that expresses CA-rop2 and shows only mild disruption of tip growth. Here, we report the characterization of a CA-rop2 enhancer (cae1-1 CA1-1) that exhibits bulbous root hairs. The cae1-1 mutation on its own caused a waving and branching root hair phenotype. CAE1 encodes the root hair growth-related, ARM domain-containing kinesin-like protein MRH2 (and thus cae1-1 was renamed to mrh2-3). Cortical MT displayed fragmentation and random orientation in mrh2 root hairs. Consistently, the MT-stabilizing drug taxol could partially rescue the wavy root hair phenotype of mrh2-3, and the MT-depolymerizing drug Oryzalin slightly enhanced the root hair tip growth defect in CA1-1. Interestingly, the addition of the actin-depolymerizing drug Latrunculin B further enhanced the Oryzalin effect. This indicates that the cross-talk of MT and AF organization is important for the mrh2-3 CA1-1 phenotype. Although we did not observe an apparent effect of the MRH2 mutation in AF organization, we found that mrh2-3 root hair growth was more sensitive to Latrunculin B. Moreover, an ARM domain-containing MRH2 fragment could bind to the polymerized actin in vitro. Therefore, our genetic analyses, together with cell biological and pharmacological evidence, suggest that the plant-specific kinesin-related protein MRH2 is an important component that controls MT organization and is likely involved in the ROP2 GTPase-controlled coordination of AF and MT during polarized growth of root hairs."
https://openalex.org/W2133993376,"G protein-coupled receptors are known to be organized within different membrane compartments or microdomains of individual cells. Here, we have used a fluorescent A3 adenosine receptor (A3-AR) agonist, ABEA-X-BY630, and the technique of fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) to investigate the diffusional characteristics of functional agonist-occupied A3-AR complexes in single living cells. In Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing the human A3-AR, the fluorescent A3-AR agonist was able to inhibit forskolin-stimulated [3H]cAMP production (pEC50=8.57), and this was antagonized by the A3-selective antagonist MRS1220 (pK(B)=9.32). The fluorescent ligand also stimulated phosphoinositide hydrolysis (pEC50=7.34). Ligand binding to the A3-AR on the membranes of single cells and subsequent increases in single cell [Ca2+]i were monitored simultaneously in real time using confocal microscopy. FCS measurements in small-membrane microdomains (approximately 0.2 microm2) revealed two agonist-occupied A3-AR components with differing diffusion characteristics (diffusion coefficients=2.65x10(-8) and 1.19x10(-9) cm2/s, respectively). The binding of ligand to these two components was reduced from 5.1 and 14.9 to 2.6 and 3.3 receptors/microm2, respectively, by MRS1220 (100 nM). These data provide direct evidence for at least two populations of agonist-occupied A3-receptor complexes, showing different motilities within the membrane of single living cells."
https://openalex.org/W2136711090,"The complexity of the tumor microenvironment necessitates that cell behavior is studied in a broad, multi-scale context. Although tomographic and microscopy-based far and near infrared fluorescence (NIRF, >650 nm) imaging methods offer high resolution, sensitivity, and depth penetration, there has been a lack of optimized NIRF agents to label and track cells in their native environments at different scales. In this study we labeled mammalian leukocytes with VivoTag 680 (VT680), an amine reactive N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) ester of a (benz) indolium-derived far red fluorescent probe. We show that VT680 diffuses into leukocytes within minutes, covalently binds to cellular components, remains internalized for days in vitro and in vivo, and does not transfer fluorescence to adjacent cells. It is biocompatible, keeps cells fully functional, and fluoresces at high intensities. In a tumor model of cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) immunotherapy, we track and quantify VT680-labeled cells longitudinally at the whole-body level with fluorescence-mediated molecular tomography (FMT), within tissues at single cell resolutions by multiphoton and confocal intravital microscopy, and ex vivo by flow cytometry. Thus, this approach is suitable to monitor cells at multiple resolutions in real time in their native environments by NIR-based fluorescence imaging."
https://openalex.org/W2096712929,"Background It is thought that mast seeding is a rare reproductive strategy in the tropics, since tropical climates are less variable, and fruit consumers tend to be more generalist in these regions. However, previous tests of this hypothesis were based on only few tropical datasets, and none from tropical South America. Moreover, reproductive strategies have been quantified based on the coefficient of variation of interannual seed production, an index that potentially confounds masting and high interannual variability in seed production. Methodology/Principal Findings We developed a new approach to model the monthly variability in seed production for 28 tree species, and 20 liana species monitored during 5 years in a tropical forest of Central French Guiana. We found that 23% of the species showed a masting pattern, 54% an annual fruiting pattern, and 23% an irregular fruiting pattern. The majority of masting species were trees (8 out of 11), most of them animal-dispersed. The classification into reproductive strategies based on the coefficient of variation was inconsistent with our results in nearly half of the cases. Conclusions/Significance Our study is the first to clearly evidence the frequency of the masting strategy in a tropical forest community of Eastern South America. The commonness of the masting strategy in tropical plants may promote species coexistence through storage dynamics."
https://openalex.org/W2145026073,"Rapid calcium concentration changes in postsynaptic structures are crucial for synaptic plasticity. Thus far, the determinants of postsynaptic calcium dynamics have been studied predominantly based on the decay kinetics of calcium transients. Calcium rise times in spines in response to single action potentials (AP) are almost never measured due to technical limitations, but they could be crucial for synaptic plasticity. With high-speed, precisely-targeted, two-photon point imaging we measured both calcium rise and decay kinetics in spines and secondary dendrites in neocortical pyramidal neurons. We found that both rise and decay kinetics of changes in calcium-indicator fluorescence are about twice as fast in spines. During AP trains, spine calcium changes follow each AP, but not in dendrites. Apart from the higher surface-to-volume ratio (SVR), we observed that neocortical dendritic spines have a markedly smaller endogenous buffer capacity with respect to their parental dendrites. Calcium influx time course and calcium extrusion rate were both in the same range for spines and dendrites when fitted with a dynamic multi-compartment model that included calcium binding kinetics and diffusion. In a subsequent analysis we used this model to investigate which parameters are critical determinants in spine calcium dynamics. The model confirmed the experimental findings: a higher SVR is not sufficient by itself to explain the faster rise time kinetics in spines, but only when paired with a lower buffer capacity in spines. Simulations at zero calcium-dye conditions show that calmodulin is more efficiently activated in spines, which indicates that spine morphology and buffering conditions in neocortical spines favor synaptic plasticity."
https://openalex.org/W2100659202,"NIMA-related kinases (Neks) have been studied in diverse eukaryotes, including the fungus Aspergillus and the ciliate Tetrahymena. In the former, a single Nek plays an essential role in cell cycle regulation; in the latter, which has more than 30 Neks in its genome, multiple Neks regulate ciliary length. Mammalian genomes encode an intermediate number of Neks, several of which are reported to play roles in cell cycle regulation and/or localize to centrosomes. Previously, we reported that organisms with cilia typically have more Neks than organisms without cilia, but were unable to establish the evolutionary history of the gene family.We have performed a large-scale analysis of the Nek family using Bayesian techniques, including tests of alternate topologies. We find that the Nek family had already expanded in the last common ancestor of eukaryotes, a ciliated cell which likely expressed at least five Neks. We suggest that Neks played an important role in the common ancestor in regulating cilia, centrioles, and centrosomes with respect to mitotic entry, and that this role continues today in organisms with cilia. Organisms that lack cilia generally show a reduction in the number of Nek clades represented, sometimes associated with lineage specific expansion of a single clade, as has occurred in the plants.This is the first rigorous phylogenetic analysis of a kinase family across a broad array of phyla. Our findings provide a coherent framework for the study of Neks and their roles in coordinating cilia and cell cycle progression."
https://openalex.org/W1975030791,"Maintaining quiescent cells in G0 phase is achieved in part through the multiprotein subunit complex known as DREAM, and in human cell lines the transcription factor E2F4 directs this complex to its cell cycle targets. We found that E2F4 binds a highly overlapping set of human genes among three diverse primary tissues and an asynchronous cell line, which suggests that tissue-specific binding partners and chromatin structure have minimal influence on E2F4 targeting. To investigate the conservation of these transcription factor binding events, we identified the mouse genes bound by E2f4 in seven primary mouse tissues and a cell line. E2f4 bound a set of mouse genes that was common among mouse tissues, but largely distinct from the genes bound in human. The evolutionarily conserved set of E2F4 bound genes is highly enriched for functionally relevant regulatory interactions important for maintaining cellular quiescence. In contrast, we found minimal mRNA expression perturbations in this core set of E2f4 bound genes in the liver, kidney, and testes of E2f4 null mice. Thus, the regulatory mechanisms maintaining quiescence are robust even to complete loss of conserved transcription factor binding events."
https://openalex.org/W2081598467,"The SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) spike is the largest known viral spike molecule, and shares a similar function with all class 1 viral fusion proteins. Previous structural studies of membrane fusion proteins have largely used crystallography of static molecular fragments, in isolation of their transmembrane domains. In this study we have produced purified, irradiated SARS-CoV virions that retain their morphology, and are fusogenic in cell culture. We used cryo-electron microscopy and image processing to investigate conformational changes that occur in the entire spike of intact virions when they bind to the viral receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). We have shown that ACE2 binding results in structural changes that appear to be the initial step in viral membrane fusion, and precisely localized the receptor-binding and fusion core domains within the entire spike. Furthermore, our results show that receptor binding and subsequent membrane fusion are distinct steps, and that each spike can bind up to three ACE2 molecules. The SARS-CoV spike provides an ideal model system to study receptor binding and membrane fusion in the native state, employing cryo-electron microscopy and single-particle image analysis."

The abnormal light-dependent regulation of the chloroplast ATP synthase in the <i>Arabidopsis thaliana cfq</i> (coupling factor quick recovery) mutant was caused by a point mutation (G to A) in the <i>atpC1</i> gene, which caused an amino acid substitution (E244K) in the vicinity of the redox modulation domain in the γ-subunit of ATP synthase. Equilibrium redox titration revealed that this mutation made the regulatory sulfhydryl group energetically much more difficult to reduce relative to the wild type (<i>i.e.</i> raised the <i>E<sub>m</sub></i><sub>,7.9</sub> by 39 mV). Enzymatic studies using isolated chloroplasts showed significantly lower light-induced ATPase and ATP synthase activity in the mutant compared with the wild type. The lower ATP synthesis capacity in turn restricted overall rates of leaf photosynthesis in the <i>cfq</i> mutant under low light. This work provides <i>in situ</i> validation of the concept that thioredoxin-dependent reduction of the γ-subunit regulatory disulfide modulates the proton electrochemical potential energy requirement for activation of the chloroplast ATP synthase and that the activation state of the ATP synthase can limit leaf level photosynthesis."

Such information is necessary to determine the extent to which structural changes in different parts of the protein molecule are coupled together in defining the cooperativity of the overall folding transition.

IL has also been shown to be a heterogeneous ensemble of intermediates (32Bhuyan A.K. Udgaonkar J.B. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 9158-9168Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 33Sridevi K.

Mol. Biol. 2004; 337: 699-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Different members of the IE ensemble are populated in different solvent conditions; hence, the structural properties of IE appear different in different folding conditions (30Pradeep L. Udgaonkar J.B. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 324: 331-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 31Pradeep L. Udgaonkar J.B. J. Biol.

The extent of cooperativity present in the major structural transition (the IE to IL structural transition), which constitutes the fast phase of folding, is poorly understood at the individual residue level. Barstar offers itself as an interesting model system for this type of study, because the kinetics of the fast phase (i.e. of the IE to IL transition) are different when monitored using different probes, under some but not all folding conditions (29Agashe V.R. Shastry M.C. Udgaonkar J.B. Nature. 1995; 377: 754-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 31Pradeep L. Udgaonkar J.B. J. Biol.

In this study, the pulsed SX methodology in conjunction with mass spectrometry has been applied to a library of 10 single Cys, single Trp-containing mutant forms of barstar, in which the single Cys residue is located at various buried and exposed locations of the protein. Fig. 1a shows the locations of the single tryptophan and the cysteine residues so introduced. For each mutant protein, the accessibility of the individual cysteine thiol group to a cysteine-specific labeling reagent, methyl methanethiosulfonate (MMTS), and the fluorescence of the sole tryptophan were measured at different times during the folding process. Only a 3-fold dispersion is seen in the site-specific rates of the fast change in cysteine thiol accessibility during folding, but a more detailed analysis of the dependence on urea concentration of the kinetics of the fast folding reaction measured at two different sites (Cys3 and Trp53) in one of the mutant proteins suggests that the fast folding reaction comprises more than one step. The method for the purification of barstar and its mutant variants has been described in detail previously (36Khurana R. Hate A.T. Nath U. Udgaonkar J.B. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 1133-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Ten different mutant variants, Cys3, Cys14, Cys25, Cys36, Cys40, Cys42, Cys62, Cys67, Cys82, and Cys89, each with a single Trp residue (Trp53) and a single Cys residue (at the residue position indicated in the name), were generated by site-directed mutagenesis (18Sinha K.K. Udgaonkar J.B. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 353: 704-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 19Sinha K.K. Udgaonkar J.B. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 370: 385-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Protein purity was checked by mass spectrometry using a Micromass Q-TOF Ultima mass spectrometer coupled with an ESI source. The masses determined for Cys3, Cys14, Cys25, Cys36, Cys40, Cys42, Cys62, Cys67, Cys82, and Cys89 were 10,232, 10,216, 10,232, 10,232, 10,232, 10,202, 10,190, 10,232, 10,246, and 10,216 Da, respectively. These masses indicate that the N-terminal methionine residue remained uncleaved during the expression of the mutant proteins. Protein concentrations were determined for all of the above mutant proteins by measuring the absorbance at 280 nm, using an extinction coefficient of 10,000 m–1 cm–1. Boric acid, EDTA disodium salt, MMTS, 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitribenzoic acid), and cysteine·HCl was of ultrapure grade from Sigma. Urea (ultrapure grade) was from U. S. Biochemical Corp. Dithiothreitol (ultrapure grade) was obtained from Invitrogen, formic acid (GPR grade) was from BDH, and acetonitrile (HPLC grade) was from Qualigens. The native buffer used for all of the equilibrium and kinetic experiments was composed of 200 mm sodium borate and 1 mm EDTA at pH 9.2. The unfolding buffer was native buffer containing 6 m urea for all the kinetic experiments or 8 m urea for all of the equilibrium unfolding experiments at pH 9.2. Urea concentrations were determined from the measurement of the refractive index on an Abbe 3L refractometer from Milton Roy. All buffers and solutions were filtered through 0.22-μm filters and degassed before use. All of the experiments were carried out at 25 °C. MMTS-labeled protein was prepared by reaction of the protein in 8 m urea (unfolding buffer) at pH 9.2, with a 100-fold molar excess of MMTS for ∼5 min. The labeling reaction was quenched by the addition of a 1000-fold molar excess (to the protein) of cysteine·HCl (in 1% formic acid) to the reaction mixture. The addition of cysteine·HCl also decreased the pH of the solution to ∼2, which ensured that labeled protein did not lose any label. Following this, the labeled protein was separated from cysteine, urea, and other small molecules present in the reaction mixture by passing the protein through a Hi-Trap Sephadex G-25 desalting column on an Akta chromatography system. The extent of labeling was checked by mass spectrometry, and the protein was found to be >95% labeled as judged from the expected 46-Da increase in the mass of the protein. The stability of MMTS, the labeling reagent used in this study, depends upon the pH of the solution in which it is reconstituted; hence, its decomposition process imposes a time constraint on the use of a MMTS solution after its preparation. The rate of decomposition of MMTS was measured under various conditions (i.e. at pH 9.5 and 8, in water at pH 6 ± 0.5, and in aqueous solutions containing 0.6–2.0 m urea at pH 6.3 ± 0.5, as described earlier) (37Roberts D.D. Lewis S.D. Ballou D.P. Olson S.T. Shafer J.A. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 5595-5601Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). In brief, fresh solutions of dithiothreitol and 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitribenzoic acid) were prepared in 20 mm Tris buffer at pH 8. Dithiothreitol was added to the solution containing excess 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitribenzoic acid), and the concentration of the released TNB2– ions was determined by measuring the absorbance at 412 nm, using an extinction coefficient of 14,100 m–1 cm–1. The concentration of MMTS in solution was determined as a function of time by monitoring the loss of absorbance of the TNB2– ions at 412 nm after the addition of an aliquot of the solution to the reaction mixture containing dithiothreitol and excess 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitribenzoic acid). MMTS was found to decompose with a time constant of ∼4 min at pH 9.5 and ∼60 min at pH 8 (data not shown). It is, however, fairly stable when reconstituted in water and aqueous solutions containing urea. It was found to decompose less than 5% in 3 h when reconstituted in aqueous solution containing 2.0 m urea at pH 6.5 ± 0.3 (data not shown). For all of the pulsed SX experiments, the MMTS solution was reconstituted in water containing 0.6–2.0 m urea at pH 6.3 ± 0.5 and was used within 2 h of its preparation. All pulsed SX experiments were carried out using a Biologic SFM-400 Q/S unit operating in the quenched flow mode. Both refolding and labeling reactions were performed at pH 9.2 and 25 °C. The protein was unfolded in 6 m urea (unfolding buffer) for at least 3 h prior to refolding experiments. After a variable time of refolding, a 4 ms pulse of MMTS label was applied. The labeling reaction was quenched by the addition of excess cysteine in 1% formic acid. Three different quenched flow programs were used to achieve the refolding times of 0, 5–23, and >23 ms. For the 0 ms refolding time point, 30 μl of 140.4 mm MMTS (in water) were mixed with 330 μl of refolding buffer inside the quenched flow machine for 5 ms, and the resulting solution was mixed with 40 μl of unfolded protein solution (150 μm stock) for 4 ms. The labeling reaction was quenched with the addition of 103 μlof 410 mm cysteine·HCl (in 1% formic acid) solution. For refolding times in the range of 5–23 ms, refolding was initiated by mixing 24 μl of unfolded protein solution (195 μm stock) with 208 μlof refolding buffer at pH 9.2 and 25 °C in various delay loops to achieve the desired refolding time points, and then the resulting solution was pulsed with 80 μl of 40.9 mm MMTS solution (in water containing 0.6 m urea) for 4 ms. The labeling reaction was quenched with the addition of 80 μl of 410 mm cysteine·HCl (in 1% formic acid) solution. To achieve refolding times greater than 23 ms, refolding was initiated by mixing 12 μl of unfolded protein solution (195 μm stock) with 104 μl of refolding buffer, at pH 9.2 and 25 °C in a 90-μl delay loop (total intermixer volume = 116 μl). After a variable delay time, a pulse consisting of 40 μl of 40.9 mm MMTS (in water containing 0.6 m urea) was applied for 4 ms. The labeling reaction was quenched with the addition of 40 μl of 410 mm cysteine·HCl (in 1% formic acid) solution. The concentration of protein at the time of labeling was 15 μm in all of the above pulsed SX experiments. The concentration of MMTS at the time of labeling was 10.5 mm, except in the experiments where the dependence on MMTS concentration of the cysteine accessibility-monitored refolding kinetics was studied. In those experiments, an identical protocol was followed except that the calculated amount of MMTS solution (9.75 m stock solution) was dissolved in water containing 0.6 m urea, so as to give the desired MMTS concentration at the time of labeling. The concentration of cysteine·HCl in all of the above experiments was 10-fold higher than that of MMTS at the time of quenching. In the experiments where the dependence on urea concentration of the cysteine accessibility monitored refolding kinetics was studied, a protocol identical to that described above was followed, except that the refolding buffer contained the calculated amount of urea, so as to give the desired urea concentration at the time of refolding. Also, the MMTS solution was reconstituted in water containing the desired urea concentration. Control experiments were done to ensure that the concentrations of MMTS and cysteine·HCl used in the above experiments were sufficient to fully label the unfolded protein and quench the labeling reaction, respectively. All of the pulsed SX experiments were completed within 2 h of the preparation of MMTS solution. All samples were processed in an identical manner. Each sample was desalted on an Akta chromatography system, using a Hi-Trap Sephadex G-25 desalting column. MilliQ water at pH 3 (pH adjusted with formic acid) was used for elution. A control experiment was performed to ensure that there was no cross-contamination between two samples during desalting. Five samples collected at the same time point of refolding, when desalted one after the other, gave the same composition of labeled and unlabeled protein (within ±3%), as determined by mass spectrometry (data not shown). A high concentration of free cysteine was present in the samples after the pulsed SX experiments. It was conceivable that the labeled protein might be reduced if the samples were not desalted for a long time. The following control experiment was done to determine the time frame within which the samples had to be desalted. Samples were collected in duplicate after the pulsed SX experiments. One set (Set A) was desalted right after the pulsed SX experiment (within 2 h), and another set (Set B) was desalted 15 h later. The amount of labeled protein in each sample of Set B is found to be only 1–2% less than the corresponding sample of Set A. Moreover, no peaks corresponding to the addition of the cysteine moiety to the unlabeled protein were observed in any of the mass spectra in any of the above experiments. To be safe, desalting was completed within 2 h after the pulsed SX experiments for all samples. The extents of labeling in samples from the pulsed SX experiments were determined using ESI-mass spectrometry. A Micromass Q-TOF Ultima mass spectrometer coupled with an ESI source, which was operated under Mass Lynx software control, was used. For acquisition of the mass spectra, the capillary and cone voltages were maintained at 3 kV and 80 V, respectively, the desolvation temperature was set to 150 °C, and the source temperature was set to 80 °C. Samples collected after desalting were mixed with acetonitrile (containing 0.2% formic acid) in a 1:1 ratio and were infused into the mass spectrometer using a syringe pump (Harvard Apparatus, Holliston, MA) at a flow rate of 10 μl/min. All of the spectra were collected in the positive ion mode. The concentration of protein in each sample was typically 2–3 μm, and typically an ion count of ∼150 was obtained in a 1 s data acquisition window. Instrument calibration was achieved with a separate injection of horse heart myoglobin. Typically, a mass spectrum consisting of a series of multiply charged peaks corresponding to the masses of the two protein species (unlabeled and MMTS-labeled protein) was observed in each 1-s scan. For each sample, the data acquired over 60 s were averaged. All of the resultant m/z spectra were processed in the following way using the Mass Lynx version 4.0 software. Background noise subtraction was done using a second order polynomial below 30% of the curve with a tolerance value of 0.01, followed by a two-point smoothening with a Savitzky-Golay algorithm (supplied with the Mass Lynx software) using a smoothening window (in channels) of ±23. The extent of labeling was determined from these smoothened m/z spectra by calculating the average relative ion intensity of the labeled protein from the ninth, tenth, and eleventh charged state peaks (these were the three most intense peaks in the mass spectra). Folding was monitored using the change in fluorescence of Trp53 as a probe. All equilibrium unfolding experiments were performed on a Fluoromax-3 fluorimeter (Jobin Yvon). The protein samples were incubated in different concentrations of urea for at least 3 h prior to the fluorescence measurements. Identical results were obtained if the time of incubation was 24 h. Excitation of tryptophan fluorescence was carried out at 295 nm, using a slit width of 0.5 nm. Emission was monitored at 320 nm using a slit width of 10 nm. The final protein concentrations in equilibrium unfolding experiments were 3–5 μm. All kinetic experiments were carried out using a Biologic SFM-4 stopped-flow machine. Proteins were unfolded in 6 m urea (unfolding buffer) for at least 3 h prior to the refolding experiments. Refolding was initiated by mixing 30 μl of unfolded protein with 270 μl of refolding buffer inside the stopped-flow mixing module. Sample excitation was carried out at 295 nm, and emission was monitored at 320 nm using an Oriel bandpass filter with a bandwidth of ±10 nm. In all experiments, a mixing dead time of 1.8 ms was achieved by using an FC-08 cuvette with a path length of 0.8 mm and a total flow rate of 5 ml/s. The final protein concentrations in fluorescence-monitored kinetic refolding experiments were 15–25 μm. In the experiments where the dependence of the fluorescence-monitored refolding kinetics on urea concentration was studied, an identical protocol as above was followed, except that refolding was initiated by appropriate dilution of refolding buffer, unfolding buffer, and unfolded protein inside the stopped-flow mixing module, so as to give the final desired urea concentration at the time of refolding. Determination of the Bimolecular Rate Constants for MMTS Labeling of a Cysteine Thiol in a Protein—The exchange reaction (SX) between a thiol labeling reagent and a protected thiol group of a protein can be modeled by a Linderstrom-Lang type of equation (22Ha J.H. Loh S.N. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 730-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 24Sridevi K. Udgaonkar J.B. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 1568-1578Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), which was conceptualized originally to explain amide-hydrogen exchange phenomena in proteins. The exchange reaction between a thiol labeling reagent and a protected thiol group of a protein can be modeled as follows. Closed(-S-H)⇋kclosedkopenOpen(-S-H)→[MMTS]kbExchanged(-S-S-CH3)SCHEME 2 A cysteine-thiol protected in the protein structure can get labeled with MMTS only when a structural opening reaction (i.e. local or global unfolding) exposes that thiol transiently to the solvent. In the above scheme, kopen and kclosed are the kinetic rate constants for opening and closing of a cysteine thiol residue in the closed-to-open reaction, and kb is the second order rate constant of the reaction of that thiol group with MMTS in the unfolded protein. Under steady state conditions, the observed rate constant of exchange of the thiol in the closed state is given by the following. kex=kopen×kb[MMTS]kclosed+kb[MMTS](Eq. 1) Two limiting cases of Equation 1 exist, depending upon the relative rates of the closing reaction (kclosed) and of chemical exchange from the open unfolded state (kb[MMTS]). If kclosed kb[MMTS], then the following is true. kex=kopen(Eq. 2) This is known as the SX1 limit, and under this condition, kex measures the rate of structural opening in the closed-to-open reaction. On the other hand, if kclosed kb[MMTS], then the following is true. kex=kopen×kb[MMTS]kclosed=Kopen×kb[MMTS](Eq. 2) This is known as the SX2 limit, and under this condition, kex measures the equilibrium constant between the closed and open states. The above two mechanisms can be distinguished, because the rate of labeling for the SX2 mechanism is dependent on the concentration of MMTS, whereas it is not for the SX1 mechanism.

https://openalex.org/W2109117519,"Accumulating evidence suggests that dysregulated expression of lytic genes plays an important role in KSHV (Kaposi's sarcoma associated herpesvirus) tumorigenesis. However, the molecular events leading to the dysregulation of KSHV lytic gene expression program are incompletely understood.We have studied the effect of KSHV-encoded latent protein vFLIP K13, a potent activator of the NF-kappaB pathway, on lytic reactivation of the virus. We demonstrate that K13 antagonizes RTA, the KSHV lytic-regulator, and effectively blocks the expression of lytic proteins, production of infectious virions and death of the infected cells. Induction of lytic replication selects for clones with increased K13 expression and NF-kappaB activity, while siRNA-mediated silencing of K13 induces the expression of lytic genes. However, the suppressive effect of K13 on RTA-induced lytic genes is not uniform and it fails to block RTA-induced viral IL6 secretion and cooperates with RTA to enhance cellular IL-6 production, thereby dysregulating the lytic gene expression program.Our results support a model in which ongoing KSHV lytic replication selects for clones with progressively higher levels of K13 expression and NF-kappaB activity, which in turn drive KSHV tumorigenesis by not only directly stimulating cellular survival and proliferation, but also indirectly by dysregulating the viral lytic gene program and allowing non-lytic production of growth-promoting viral and cellular genes. Lytic Replication-Induced Clonal Selection (LyRICS) may represent a general mechanism in viral oncogenesis."

Each [Fe-S] cluster assembly machinery minimally consists of a sulfur-providing cysteine desulfurase and a molecular scaffold where [2Fe-2S] or [4Fe-4S] clusters are transiently assembled prior transfer to target apo-proteins. NifS is a pyridoxal phosphate-containing enzyme that catalyzes the desulfurization of l-cysteine to provide sulfur for [Fe-S] cluster formation (16Zheng L. White R.H. Cash V.L. Jack R.F. Dean D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2754-2758Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar, 17Zheng L. White R.H. Cash V.L. Dean D.R. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4714-4720Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar), and NifU serves as the molecular scaffold for the NifS-directed assembly of [Fe-S] clusters (18Yuvaniyama P. Agar J.N.

Indeed, in vitro experiments showed that NifU could transfer a [4Fe-4S] cluster to apoNifH 3ApoNifH refers to a form of NifH from which [4Fe-4S] cluster has been removed by chelation. 3ApoNifH refers to a form of NifH from which [4Fe-4S] cluster has been removed by chelation. and reconstitute an active holo-NifH (14Dos Santos P.C.

The involvement of NifU and NifS in the assembly of the P-cluster and the FeMo-co embedded within the NifDK protein is less clear. Strains lacking both nifU and nifS exhibited a 10-fold decrease in NifDK activity that could not be recovered by addition of FeMo-co (10Jacobson M.R. Cash V.L. Weiss M.C. Laird N.F. Newton W.E. Dean D.R. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1989; 219: 49-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Complementation by FeMo-co addition is a characteristic property of apoNifDK containing the P-clusters but lacking FeMo-co. The phenotype of nifUS mutants thus suggests that the absence of NifUS mostly impairs P-cluster synthesis but does not clarify whether nifUS mutants are capable of synthesizing FeMo-co. Other nif genes, nifB, nifE, nifH, nifN, nifQ, nifV, and nifX, have been shown to be involved in the biosynthesis of FeMo-co (7Ludden P.W. Rangaraj P. Rubio L.M. Smith B.E. Richards R.L. Newton W.E.

Rev. 2004; 104: 1159-1174Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). The nifB gene encodes a SAM-radical protein required to synthesize NifB-co, an [Fe-S] cluster of unknown structure that serves as a biosynthetic intermediate during the early steps of FeMo-co biosynthesis (20Shah V.K. Allen J.R. Spangler N.J. Ludden P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1154-1158Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Allen R.M. Chatterjee R. Ludden P.W. Shah V.K. J. Biol.

A. 2006; 103: 5297-5301Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Unlike the wild-type strain, nifN or nifE mutant strains accumulate a measurable amount of NifB-co under nitrogen fixing growing conditions, because the FeMo-co biosynthetic pathway is interrupted at the level of NifB-co processing. NifB-co can be isolated from cytoplasmic membranes of a K. pneumoniae nifN mutant strain by treatment with the detergent Sarkosyl (20Shah V.K. Allen J.R. Spangler N.J. Ludden P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1154-1158Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Radiolabeling experiments with 55Fe and 35S isotopes have shown that iron and sulfur from NifB-co are transferred to FeMo-co during cofactor synthesis in vitro (21Allen R.M. Chatterjee R. Ludden P.W. Shah V.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26890-26896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). However, it is not known whether NifB-co is the only source of iron and sulfur to FeMo-co. NifB-co contains neither molybdenum nor an organic acid, such as homocitrate (20Shah V.K. Allen J.R. Spangler N.J. Ludden P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1154-1158Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A standing hypothesis has been that the simple [2Fe-2S] or [4Fe-4S] clusters assembled by NifU and NifS could serve as metabolic substrates during the early steps of FeMo-co synthesis (i.e. the synthesis of NifB-co) (7Ludden P.W. Rangaraj P. Rubio L.M. Smith B.E. Richards R.L. Newton W.E. Catalysts for Nitrogen Fixation: Nitrogenases, Relevant Chemical Models, and Commercial Processes. 1st Ed.

However, direct experimental evidence supporting this hypothesis is lacking. The impairment of nifU and nifS mutant strains to synthesize active NifDK protein could be the result of cumulative effect over the activity of some of the [Fe-S] cluster-containing proteins that are involved in FeMo-co synthesis and NifDK maturation, for example NifH, NifB, or NifEN. To address this question, we have investigated here the effect of nifU and nifS mutations on the accumulation of NifB-co and on the activity of the NifB protein. K. pneumoniae Strains and Growth Conditions—K. pneumoniae strains UN (wild type) and UN1217 (nifN4536::mu) have been previously described (23MacNeil T. MacNeil D. Roberts G.P. Supiano M.A. Brill W.J. J. Bacteriol. 1978; 136: 253-266Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Strains generated during the course of this study are described in supplemental Table S1. Growth in minimal medium, nif derepression, cell collection, and cell breakage has been described (20Shah V.K. Allen J.R. Spangler N.J. Ludden P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1154-1158Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For growth on plates, LC medium (1% Tryptone, 0.5% yeast extract, and 0.5% NaCl) was solidified with separately autoclaved 1.5% agar solution. Kanamycin (50 μg/ml), spectinomycin (100 μg/ml), chloramphenicol (17.5 μg/ml), and ampicillin (25 μg/ml) were added as required. A. vinelandii strain UW45 (nifB mutant) (24Nagatani H.H. Shah V.K. Brill W.J. J. Bacteriol. 1974; 120: 697-701Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was cultivated in 20-liter carboys and derepressed for nitrogenase expression as described before (25Shah V.K. Davis L.C. Brill W.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1972; 256: 498-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Escherichia coli DH5α, BL21, and S17-1 strains were grown in Luria-Bertani medium at 37 °C with shaking (200 rpm). For growth of E. coli on plates, medium solidified with 1.5% agar was used. Antibiotics were used at standard concentrations (26Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar). Plasmid Constructions and DNA Manipulations—Plasmid constructions, PCR, and transformation of E. coli were carried out by standard methods (26Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar). Plasmids generated during the course of this work are listed in supplemental Table S1. Isolation of genomic DNA from K. pneumoniae strains was carried out using the DNAeasy™ Tissue Kit (Qiagen). Procedures for K. pneumoniae transformation (27Shokolenko I.N. Alexeyev M.F. BioTechniques. 1995; 18: 596-598PubMed Google Scholar), conjugation, and gene replacement (28Walker K.A. Miller V.L. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 4056-4066Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) have been described. Generation of K. pneumoniae nifU and nifS Mutant Strains—Mutations in nifU or nifS consisted of in-frame deletions spanning the complete amino acid coding sequences of nifU or nifS without altering any other DNA sequence in the nif gene cluster (Fig. 1). These deletions were constructed on suicide plasmids to force recombination with the genomic DNA of K. pneumoniae UN1217 and to promote exchange of gene alleles. Oligonucleotides were designed to amplify by PCR the nif DNA regions flanking nifU or nifS using K. pneumoniae genomic DNA as template. DNA fragments were amplified using Pfu DNA polymerase and ligated into the corresponding restriction sites of plasmid pEP185.2 to construct pRHB288 (ΔnifU), pRHB289 (ΔnifS), and pRHB290 (ΔnifUS), respectively. In pRHB288 (ΔnifU), the 1.9-kb KpnI DNA fragment containing part of nifN and the complete nifX was blunt-end ligated to the 2.5-kb PstI DNA fragment containing the nifSVW genes. In pRHB289 (ΔnifS), the 2.73-kb KpnI DNA fragment containing part of nifN and the complete nifX and nifU genes was blunt-end-ligated to the 1.26-kb PstI DNA fragment containing the complete nifVW genes. In pRHB290 (ΔnifUS), the 1.9-kb KpnI DNA fragment containing part of nifN and the complete nifX gene was blunt-end ligated to the 1.8-kb NotI DNA fragment containing the complete nifVWZ genes. Plasmid pRHB291 was generated from pRHB290 by replacing the 630-bp DNA fragment between two BamHI restriction sites within nifX and nifV by the 1.2-kb kanamycin resistance cassette from pUC4K. Fidelity of all constructions was confirmed by sequencing both DNA strands. The nifU and nifS mutations were introduced into the chromosome of strain UN1217 by allelic exchange events. First, UC0 was generated by conjugation of K. pneumoniae UN1217 with E. coli S17-1 (pRHB291) followed by selection of a Kmr Cms phenotype. After isolating genomic DNA from resulting Kmr Cms colonies, incorporation and segregation of mutant allele into the chromosome was checked by PCR. Second, pRHB288 (ΔnifU), pRHB289 (ΔnifS), or pRHB290 (ΔnifUS) were transferred to strain UC0 by conjugation to generate UC1, UC2, and UC3, respectively. Ampr Cmr clones with plasmids integrated into the chromosome by single crossover events were selected and confirmed by PCR analysis. Third, selected Ampr Cmr clones were continuously cultured in liquid LC medium containing 25 μg/ml ampicillin for more than 100 generations to enrich for cells having the second allelic exchange. Cultures were then diluted and plated onto solid LC medium containing 25 μg/ml ampicillin. Kms Cms colonies (which had a second allelic exchange event) were selected, and the deletions in nifU, nifS, or nifU and nifS were confirmed by PCR analysis (Fig. 1). Genetic Complementation of ΔnifU, ΔnifS, and ΔnifUS Mutant Strains—To perform genetic complementation analysis of ΔnifU and ΔnifS mutants, strains UC1, UC2, and UC3 were transformed with plasmid pRHB257 according to (27Shokolenko I.N. Alexeyev M.F. BioTechniques. 1995; 18: 596-598PubMed Google Scholar). Plasmid pRHB257 is a derivative of the low copy number plasmid pEXT21 that carries wild-type nifUS genes. Plasmid pRHB257 was generated by cloning a 2275-bp BamHI and HindIII DNA fragment, which covers from the restriction enzyme site at the 3′-end of nifX to the stop codon of nifS, into the BamHI and HindIII sites of pEXT21 (Fig. 1). Generation and Expression of GST-NifB Fusion Proteins in K. pneumoniae—NifB from K. pneumoniae was expressed as a glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein. The chimera was constructed in the pRHB153 plasmid, a derivative of plasmid pGEX-4T-3 (GE Healthcare) (29Hernandez J.A. Igarashi R.Y. Soboh B. Curatti L. Dean D.R. Ludden P.W. Rubio L.M. Mol. Microbiol. 2007; 63: 177-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The nifB gene was PCR-amplified from the chromosome of K. pneumoniae UN1217 using oligonucleotides nifB-N1 5′-CCCCATATGACTTCCTGCTCCTCTTTTTCTGG-3′ and nifB-C1 5′-GGGCTCGAGTCAGGCGACCCCCTTATGCG-3′ as primers. The nifB gene cartridge was then digested with NdeI and XhoI and ligated into the corresponding sites of plasmid pRHB153 to generate plasmid pRHB233. Two strategies were used to express gst-nifB at different cellular levels. First, to keep gst-nifB expression at wild-type levels, the chromosomal copy of nifB was replaced by a gst-nifB allele so that expression was controlled by the natural nifB promoter. A 1-kb DNA fragment containing the nifA gene, the nifB promoter (PnifB), and a XbaI restriction site at the 5′-end, was PCR-amplified from the chromosome of K. pneumoniae UN1217 using oligonucleotides nifA-m1 (5′-CCCCTCTAGAATCGCCAACGCCATCCACCATAAT-3′) and nifA-c1 (5′-GGTCGTACCTTCGTGGTTGGGC-3′) as primers. In addition, a 2.1-kb DNA fragment containing the gst-nifB gene and a SacI restriction site at the 3′-end was PCR-amplified from pRHB233 using oligonucleotides RNF17 (5′-ATGTCCCCTATACTAGGTTATTGGAAATTAAG-3′) and nifB-c3 (5′-CCGAGCTCTCAGGCGACCCCCTTATGCGGCAA-3′) as primers. Both DNA fragments were ligated into the XbaI and SacI sites of the suicide plasmid pDS132, which carries an sacB gene (30Philippe N. Alcaraz J.P. Coursange E. Geiselmann J. Schneider D. Plasmid. 2004; 51: 246-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar), to generate plasmid pRHB292. Plasmid pRHB292 was transferred to strains UN (wild type), UN1217 (nifN::mu), and UC3 (ΔnifUS nifN::mu) to generate strains UC4, UC5, and UC8, respectively. After selecting Cmr clones, the integration of pRHB292 into the chromosome was confirmed by PCR analysis. Clones with integrated pRHB292 were cultured in liquid LC medium and subsequently plated onto solid LB medium supplemented with 5% sucrose to select for plasmid excision in sucrose-resistant colonies. Substitution of gst-nifB for nifB was confirmed by PCR analysis of chromosomal DNA isolated from strains UC4, UC5, and UC8. Cells from K. pneumoniae UC5 and UC8 strains were grown, derepressed for nitrogenase, and collected by standard procedures (20Shah V.K. Allen J.R. Spangler N.J. Ludden P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1154-1158Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The second strategy aimed at boosting expression of gst-nifB up to levels that facilitated purification of NifB. To achieve this, the wild-type copy of nifB was removed from the chromosome of UN1217, and the gst-nifB gene was expressed from plasmid pRHB233 so that expression was controlled by an isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (IPTG)-inducible Ptac promoter. A 1-kb XbaI-EcoRI DNA fragment containing nifA, and a 1-kb EcoRI-SphI DNA fragment containing nifQ, were amplified from UN1217 genomic DNA by PCR and ligated into the XbaI and SphI sites of pDS132 to generate plasmid pRHB235 (ΔnifB). Plasmid pRHB235 was transferred to strains UN (wild type), UN1217 (nifN::mu), and UC3 (ΔnifUS nifN::mu) to generate strains UC9, UC10, and UC11, respectively, by a procedure analogous to that described above for gst-nifB replacement. Finally, plasmid pRHB233 was transferred to UC9, UC10, and UC11 mutant strains for GST-NifB expression under different genetic background generating strains UC16, UC17, and UC18, respectively. Cells from K. pneumoniae UC16, UC17, and UC18 strains were subjected to IPTG induction (5 μm IPTG) and nif derepression at the same time. Generation of a K. pneumoniae nifENX Mutant Strain—A K. pneumoniae ΔnifENX mutant strain (UC15) was generated. A nifTY-nifU DNA fragment having a complete deletion of the nifENX operon deleted was first cloned in plasmid pDS132 and then introduced into the chromosome of K. pneumoniae UN by allelic exchange to generate UC15. A 986-bp nifTY DNA fragment carrying XbaI restriction site at the 5′-end and EcoRI restriction site at the 3′-end was amplified by PCR using primers nifT-N2 (5′-CCCTCTAGATGCCCCGCGTCATGCGGCGGCAG-3′) and nifY-C2 (5′-CCCGAATTCGAGCGTAACGTGGGGAAGAGCGTCC-3′). A 1053-bp nifU DNA fragment carrying EcoRI restriction site at the 5′-end and an SphI restriction site at the 3′-end were amplified by PCR using primers nifU-p (5′-CCCGAATTCGATCCGGACCCGCGCCGCTAGCC-3′) and nifU-C3 (5′-CCCGCATGCTCAGGCCGCCACCACTTCCATATAA-3′). Both DNA fragments were digested by the corresponding restriction enzymes and co-ligated into the XbaI and SphI sites of pDS132 to generate plasmid pRHB294. Transfer of pRHB294 into K. pneumoniae UN, clone selection, and segregation of ΔnifENX mutation were performed using plasmid pDS132 as described above. Deletion of nifENX genes from the chromosome of UC15 was confirmed by PCR analysis. Strain UC15 did not exhibit nitrogenase activity in vivo, as expected. Purification of GST-NifB from K. pneumoniae Cells—GST-NifB proteins were purified from cells of strains UC5, UC8, UC17, and UC18 by affinity chromatography using GSH-Sepharose resin (GE Healthcare). For preparation of GST-NifB, 25 g of collected cell paste was resuspended in 80 ml of 2× buffer A (10 mm sodium phosphate, 1.8 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 8.5, 140 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 10% glycerol, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.02% n-dodecyl-β-d-maltopyranoside, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml DNaseI, and 1 mm DTH). Cells were disrupted by 10 cycles of sonication (1 min per cycle) using a Fisher Sonic Dismembrator 550 equipped with a 12-mm tip at 25% power output inside an anaerobic glove box. After adjusting pH of lysate to pH 7.4, cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 27,000 × g for 30 min in a Beckman Ti-50.2 ultracentrifuge rotor. The clarified cell-free extract (supernatant) was applied onto a 5-ml GSH-Sepharose column. The column was then washed with three column volumes of buffer A supplemented with 1% Triton X-100 and 10 column volumes of buffer A to remove contaminants. The GST-NifB was eluted from the column applying three column volumes of buffer B (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.02% n-dodecyl-β-d-maltopyranoside, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 mm reduced glutathione, and 1 mm DTH). Eluted GST-NifB protein was concentrated to 3-5 mg/ml inside an anaerobic glove box using an Amicon cell equipped with YM100 Millipore ultrafiltration membranes. Purification of the GST-NifB fusion protein was accomplished within 6 h at 16 °C. Purified NifB preparations were drop-frozen and stored in liquid nitrogen. In Vivo and in Vitro Nitrogenase Activities—In vivo nitrogenase activity was determined by ethylene production at 30 °C for 30 min in 1-ml culture samples as previously described (31Stewart W.P.D. Fitzgerald G.P. Burris R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1967; 58: 2071-2078Crossref PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar). NifDK activity in cell-free extracts was obtained after titration with an excess of the complementary component, NifH, as described (32Shah V.K. Brill W.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1973; 305: 445-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Specific activity is defined as nanomoles of ethylene formed per min/mg of protein in the extract. In Vitro FeMo-co-dependent or NifB-co-dependent Apo-NifDK Activation Assays—Protocols for the isolation of FeMo-co (33Shah V.K. Brill W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1994; 269: 1154-1158Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have been described previously. Preparation of crude NifB-co extracts was carried out according to previous study (20Shah V.K. Allen J.R. Spangler N.J. Ludden P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1154-1158Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with a modified cell breakage procedure. K. pneumoniae cells in a 3-ml suspension were broken inside an anaerobic glove box by sonication for 2 min and 15% power output using a Fisher Sonic Dismembrator 550 equipped with a 3-mm tip. Crude NifB-co extract refers to NifB-co solubilized from lysed cells of K. pneumoniae strains with Sarkosyl detergent (n-lauroyl sarcosine) but not purified through further chromatographic steps. Assays for NifB-co dependent in vitro activation of apo-NifDK present in extracts of A. vinelandii strain UW45 (nifB) were performed as described before (20Shah V.K. Allen J.R. Spangler N.J. Ludden P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1154-1158Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with modifications. 9-ml serum vials sealed with stoppers were repeatedly evacuated and flushed with argon gas and rinsed with 0.3 ml of anaerobic buffer. The complete reactions contained: 100 μl of 25 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, 10 μl of 1 mm Na2MoO4, 20 μl of 5 mm homocitrate, 200 μl of ATP-regenerating mixture (containing 3.6 mm ATP, 6.3 mm MgCl2, 51 mm phosphocreatine, 20 units/ml creatine phosphokinase, and 6.3 mm DTH), 200 μl of UW45 cell-free extracts (≈3"
https://openalex.org/W2005083476,"Background Plants defend themselves against herbivorous insects, utilizing both constitutive and inducible defenses. Induced defenses are controlled by several phytohormone-mediated signaling pathways. Here, we analyze transcriptional changes in the North American Arabidopsis relative Boechera divaricarpa in response to larval herbivory by the crucifer specialist lepidopteran Plutella xylostella (diamondback moth) and by the generalist lepidopteran Trichoplusia ni (cabbage semilooper), and compare them to wounding and exogenous phytohormone application. Methodology/Principal Findings We use a custom macroarray constructed from B. divaricarpa herbivory-regulated cDNAs identified by suppression subtractive hybridization and from known stress-responsive A. thaliana genes for transcript profiling after insect herbivory, wounding and in response to jasmonate, salicylate and ethylene. In addition, we introduce path analysis as a novel approach to analyze transcript profiles. Path analyses reveal that transcriptional responses to the crucifer specialist P. xylostella are primarily determined by direct effects of the ethylene and salicylate pathways, whereas responses to the generalist T. ni are influenced by the ethylene and jasmonate pathways. Wound-induced transcriptional changes are influenced by all three pathways, with jasmonate having the strongest effect. Conclusions/Significance Our results show that insect herbivory is distinct from simple mechanical plant damage, and that different lepidopteran herbivores elicit different transcriptional responses."
https://openalex.org/W2049940479,"The second messenger nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NAADP) releases Ca(2+) from the acidic Ca(2+) stores of many organisms, including those of the sea urchin egg. We investigated whether the pH within the lumen of these acidic organelles changes in response to stimuli. Fertilization activates the egg by Ca(2+) release dependent upon NAADP, and accordingly, we report that fertilization also alters organellar pH in a spatio-temporally complex manner. Upon sperm fusion, vesicles deep in the egg center slowly acidify, whereas cortical vesicles undergo a rapid alkalinization. The cortical vesicle alkalinization is independent of exocytosis and cytosolic pH but coincides with the NAADP-dependent fertilization Ca(2+) wave. Microinjection of NAADP mimicked the fertilization cortical response, suggesting that it occurred within NAADP-sensitive acidic Ca(2+) stores. Our data show that NAADP and physiological stimuli alter the pH within intracellular organelles and suggest that NAADP signals through pH as well as Ca(2+)."

https://openalex.org/W2112564147,"Reliable inference of ancestral sequences can be critical to identifying both patterns and causes of molecular evolution. Robustness of ancestral inference is often assumed among closely related species, but tests of this assumption have been limited. Here, we examine the performance of inference methods for data simulated under scenarios of codon bias evolution within the Drosophila melanogaster subgroup. Genome sequence data for multiple, closely related species within this subgroup make it an important system for studying molecular evolutionary genetics. The effects of asymmetric and lineage-specific substitution rates (i.e., varying levels of codon usage bias and departures from equilibrium) on the reliability of ancestral codon usage was investigated. Maximum parsimony inference, which has been widely employed in analyses of Drosophila codon bias evolution, was compared to an approach that attempts to account for uncertainty in ancestral inference by weighting ancestral reconstructions by their posterior probabilities. The latter approach employs maximum likelihood estimation of rate and base composition parameters. For equilibrium and most non-equilibrium scenarios that were investigated, the probabilistic method appears to generate reliable ancestral codon bias inferences for molecular evolutionary studies within the D. melanogaster subgroup. These reconstructions are more reliable than parsimony inference, especially when codon usage is strongly skewed. However, inference biases are considerable for both methods under particular departures from stationarity (i.e., when adaptive evolution is prevalent). Reliability of inference can be sensitive to branch lengths, asymmetry in substitution rates, and the locations and nature of lineage-specific processes within a gene tree. Inference reliability, even among closely related species, can be strongly affected by (potentially unknown) patterns of molecular evolution in lineages ancestral to those of interest."
https://openalex.org/W2067111046,"Scrapie and chronic wasting disease are contagious prion diseases affecting sheep and cervids, respectively. Studies have indicated that horizontal transmission is important in sustaining these epidemics, and that environmental contamination plays an important role in this. In the perspective of detecting prions in soil samples from the field by more direct methods than animal-based bioassays, we have developed a novel immuno-based approach that visualises in situ the major component (PrP(Sc)) of prions sorbed onto agricultural soil particles. Importantly, the protocol needs no extraction of the protein from soil. Using a cell-based assay of infectivity, we also report that samples of agricultural soil, or quartz sand, acquire prion infectivity after exposure to whole brain homogenates from prion-infected mice. Our data provide further support to the notion that prion-exposed soils retain infectivity, as recently determined in Syrian hamsters intracerebrally or orally challenged with contaminated soils. The cell approach of the potential infectivity of contaminated soil is faster and cheaper than classical animal-based bioassays. Although it suffers from limitations, e.g. it can currently test only a few mouse prion strains, the cell model can nevertheless be applied in its present form to understand how soil composition influences infectivity, and to test prion-inactivating procedures."
https://openalex.org/W2023013984,"Background We have previously described a four antigen malaria vaccine consisting of DNA plasmids boosted by recombinant poxviruses which protects a high percentage of rhesus monkeys against Plasmodium knowlesi (Pk) malaria. This is a multi-stage vaccine that includes two pre-erythrocytic antigens, PkCSP and PkSSP2(TRAP), and two erythrocytic antigens, PkAMA-1 and PkMSP-1(42kD). The present study reports three further experiments where we investigate the effects of DNA dose, timing, and formulation. We also compare vaccines utilizing only the pre-erythrocytic antigens with the four antigen vaccine. Methodology In three experiments, rhesus monkeys were immunized with malaria vaccines using DNA plasmid injections followed by boosting with poxvirus vaccine. A variety of parameters were tested, including formulation of DNA on poly-lactic co-glycolide (PLG) particles, varying the number of DNA injections and the amount of DNA, varying the interval between the last DNA injection to the poxvirus boost from 7 to 21 weeks, and using vaccines with from one to four malaria antigens. Monkeys were challenged with Pk sporozoites given iv 2 to 4 weeks after the poxvirus injection, and parasitemia was measured by daily Giemsa stained blood films. Immune responses in venous blood samples taken after each vaccine injection were measured by ELIspot production of interferon-γ, and by ELISA. Conclusions 1) the number of DNA injections, the formulation of the DNA plasmids, and the interval between the last DNA injection and the poxvirus injection are critical to vaccine efficacy. However, the total dose used for DNA priming is not as important; 2) the blood stage antigens PkAMA-1 and PkMSP-1 were able to protect against high parasitemias as part of a genetic vaccine where antigen folding is not well defined; 3) immunization with PkSSP2 DNA inhibited immune responses to PkCSP DNA even when vaccinations were given into separate legs; and 4) in a counter-intuitive result, higher interferon-γ ELIspot responses to the PkCSP antigen correlated with earlier appearance of parasites in the blood, despite the fact that PkCSP vaccines had a protective effect."
https://openalex.org/W2075326406,"The light-harvesting chlorophyll a/b-binding protein of photosystem II (LHCIIb) fulfills multiple functions, such as light harvesting and energy dissipation under different illuminations. The crystal structure of LHCIIb at the near atomic resolution reveals an antiparallel strands structure in the lumenal loop between the transmembrane helices B/C. To study the structural and functional significances of this structure, three amino acids (Val-119, His-120, and Ser-123) in this region have been exchanged to Phe, Leu, and Gly, respectively, and the influence of the mutagenesis on the structure and function of LHCIIb has been investigated. The results are as follows. 1) Circular dichroism spectra of the mutations reveals that the antiparallel strands in the lumenal region are very important for adjusting pigment conformation in the neoxanthin domain of LHCIIb. Although the mutagenesis causes only a slight loss of the Neo binding in the complexes (V119F, 0.09; S123G, 0.19; and H120L, 0.27), it imparts remarkable changes to the pigment conformation. 2) Substituting Ser-123 with Gly results in a higher susceptibility to photodamage, an increased tendency to aggregate, and enhanced fluorescence quenching induced by the medium acidification. These results demonstrate that this antiparallel strands domain plays an important role in regulating the pigment conformation and in adjusting the aggregation and the fluorescence yield of LHCIIb.

FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 4201-4206Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Under strong light conditions, the function of LHCIIb is to regulate a balanced distribution of absorbed energy between different PSs through its ability to migrate between PSI and PSII (3Allen J.F. Physiol. Plant. 1995; 93: 196-205Crossref Scopus (131) Google Scholar), or to dissipate overexcited energy (non-photochemical quenching (NPQ)) via different mechanisms, e.g. its conformational change (4Pascal A.A.

The proton gradient over the thylakoid membrane (ΔpH) caused by reduced carbon dioxide fixation under strong light might be one of the sensors that initialize the protonation of integral photosynthetic proteins, which in turn, increases NPQ as a consequence (8Crofts A.R. Yerkes C.T. FEBS Lett. 1994; 352: 265-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). It has been observed that the two negatively charged residues (Glu) in the lumenal region of PsbS are protonation sites, which induce a series of physiological processes and then increase the NPQ under excessive light conditions (9Li X.P.

LHCIIb is claimed to be one of the candidates for protonation because there are several potential protonation sites in the lumenal region (11Walters R.G. Ruban A.V. Horton P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14204-14209Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that LHCIIb exists in two different states (the U state: unquenched state, and the Q state: quenched state) (12Horton P. Ruban A.V. Wentworth M. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B: Biol. Sci. 2000; 355: 1361-1370Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Protonation controls the balance of the two states of LHCIIb (13Wentworth M. Ruban A.V. Horton P. J. Biol.

The two Luts, which locate in the center of LHCIIb, form an internal cross-brace interacting with helices A and B. The Vio has low affinity to LHCIIb and readily migrates out of LHCIIb during the xanthophyll cycle (15Goss R. Lohr M. Latowski D. Grzyb J. Vieler A. Wilhelm C. Strzalka K. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 4028-4036Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Binding Neo is a peculiar characteristic of LHCII because 90% of thylakoid Neo is bound to LHCIIb trimers (16Croce R. Remelli R. Varotto C. Breton J. Bassi R. FEBS Lett. 1999; 456: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Neo has the lowest efficiency of energy transfer to Chl in all carotenoids (17Connelly J.P. Muller M.G. Bassi R. Croce R. Holzwarth A.R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 281-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), but it is a good scavenger for singlet O2*, which is very important for photoprotection in PSII (18Remelli R. Varotto C. Sandona D. Croce R. Bassi R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33510-33521Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). It has been observed with recombinant LHCIIb that Neo is subject to reversible dissociation under different high ambient temperatures despite its high affinity to LHCIIb (19Hobe S. Trostmann I. Raunser S. Paulsen H. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 25156-25166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In Cuscuta reflexa, a plant that does not synthesize Neo, the N1 binding position could be replaced by 9-cis Vio (20Snyder A.M. Clark B.M. Robert B. Ruban A.V. Bungard R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 5162-5168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The isomerism of all-trans Vio to 9-cis Vio, which replaces 9-cis Neo in the N1-position, could easily be induced under elevated temperatures in native LHCIIb, isolated from winter rye leaves (21Niedzwiedzki D. Krupa Z. Gruszecki W.I. J. Photochem. Photobiol. B: Biol. 2005; 78: 109-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). It suggests that a 9-cis-5,6-epoxy-3-hydroxy carotenoid is required for this position. Monomeric LHCIIb is organized as three transmembrane (TM) α-helices (helices A, B, C) and one amphiphilic α-helix (helix D) and an amphipathic short 310-helix (helix E) at the lumenal side. Between helices E and C, the structure folds into two antiparallel strands, which are stabilized by an interstrand ionic pair (Asp-111-His-120) and other H-bonds (14Liu Z.F. Yan H.C. Wang K.B. Kuang T.Y. Zhang J.P. Gui L.L. An X.M. Chang W.R. Nature. 2004; 428: 287-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (1355) Google Scholar). It is proposed that the lumenal region is not only a connector between the TM helices B and C of LHCIIb, but also a switch that regulates the multiple functions of LHCIIb (22Mick V. Eggert K. Heinemann B. Geister S. Paulsen H. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 5467-5473Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The aim of this work was to investigate the structural and functional significances of the antiparallel strands structure between the TM helices B/C. For this purpose, three amino acids (Val-119, His-120, and Ser-123) in the region have been exchanged to Phe, Leu, and Gly, respectively. The changes in pigment stoichiometries, characteristics of optical spectra, capacity for non-radiative dissipation, the characteristics of macro structure in a low detergent medium, and the characteristics of low pH-induced fluorescence lowering of different LHCIIb species have been investigated, and the possible functional mechanisms of the motif are discussed in this article. Construction of the Lhcb1 Gene—Lhcb1 cDNA was synthesized using random primers and a RT-PCR kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) from total RNA isolated from 14-day-old pea (Pisum sativum L.) seedlings. The Lhcb1 gene was amplified from 1 μl of cDNA in a 20-μl PCR reaction mixture containing 0.2 μm forward primer 5′-C(A/G)ATGGC(T/C)GCTTCATC(A/C)ATGGC-3′, and the reverse primer 5′-CC(C/T)CTTCACAAAAACACAATACGAC-3′ and 0.5 μl of (200 units/μl) Taq DNA polymerase (Promega). Forty cycles of the PCR program (30 s at 94 °C, 30 s at 60 °C, and 120 s at 72 °C) were run, followed by a final extension step at 72 °C for 10 min. The PCR product was cloned into the pMD-18T vector (Takara, Shiga, Japan) and transformed into Escherichia coli strain DH5α. The gene was checked by sequencing and aligned with GenBank™ Lhcb1 sequences. The gene entry number is AY845253. Two restriction sites (NdeI and XhoI) were introduced to the 5′ and 3′ termini of Lhcb1, respectively, via PCR with the forward primers 5′-ACATATGAGGAAGTCTGCTACCAC-3′ and the reverse primer 5′-ACTCGAGATTTCCTGGAAGGAAGTTGG-3′. The NdeI-XhoI fragments were inserted into the pET-23 (a) expression vector (Novagen) and transferred into E. coli strain BL21. By introducing the restriction site XhoI, an additional sequence CTCGAG was added to the reading frame in the 3′-end, which resulted in adding two extra amino acids Leu and Glu to Lhcb1. All the genes were checked by sequencing and aligning with GenBank™ Lhcb1 sequences. Mutagenesis—Site-directed mutagenesis to Lhcb1 was carried out with a MutanBEST site-directed mutagenesis kit (Takara Tokyo, Japan). The mutagenesis primers designed for the mutations were as follows: S123G, 5′-TGCCTTGTGCATGAACC-3′; H120L, 5′-TGCTTTGTGCAAGAACC-3′; V119F, 5′-AGCTTGTTTCATGCAC-3′. In the mutant expression clone, the sequences of the entire section, which had been amplified by PCR during the mutagenesis procedure, were verified by DNA sequencing. The apoproteins of different Lhcb1 species were overexpressed and isolated using the method described in Ref. 23Paulsen H. Rümler U. Rüdiger W. Planta. 1990; 181: 204-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar. Preparation of Recombinant LHCIIb—The Lhcb1 apoproteins were reconstituted with total thylakoid pigments according to the method described in Paulsen et al. (23Paulsen H. Rümler U. Rüdiger W. Planta. 1990; 181: 204-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). The trimeric LHCIIb were reconstituted in a Ni2+-chelating Sepharose fast flow column (chelating Sepharose fast flow: Amersham Bio-sciences, Uppsala Sweden; column: 0.8 cm × 4 cm, Bio-Rad) according to the method of Rogl et al. (24Rogl H. Kosemund K. Kuhlbrandt W. Collinson I. FEBS Lett. 1998; 432: 21-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). The reconstituted trimeric complexes were separated by sucrose density gradients centrifugation in a 12.5-ml centrifuge tube containing 0.1-1.0 m sucrose density gradient, 2.0 mm dodecyl β-d-maltoside (DM) (Sigma), and 5 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.5), and centrifuged at 230,000 × g and 4 °C for 18 h. The bands corresponding to trimers were collected. Pigment Analysis—Sucrose gradient bands containing trimeric LHCIIb were analyzed for their pigment stoichiometry with Waters 600 high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) (Waters). The pigments were extracted with 2-butyl alcohol according to the method described in Ref. 25Martinson T.A. Plumley F.G. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 228: 123-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar. The 2-butyl alcohol extract was applied to an RP-C18 HPLC column (Merck, Germany) and separated with a gradient from 70 to 100% acetone, at a rate of 1 ml/min. Pigments were quantified by comparing the integrated peak areas to calibrated peaks of known pigment quantity. Absorption Spectra—Samples were diluted with the dilution buffer to ∼10 μg/ml Chl. The absorption spectra were recorded using a Shimadzu UV-VIS 2550 spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) at room temperature. The wavelength step was 0.5 nm, the scan rate was 100 nm/min, and the optical path-length was 1 cm. Circular Dichroism Spectra—CD spectra were recorded in a Jasco 810 spectropolarimeter (Jasco, Tokyo, Japan) at 10 °C. The concentration of the samples was adjusted to OD = 1 at the Qy transition of Chl a. The spectra were measured from 350 to 750 nm at a scan rate of 100 nm/min. The measurements were repeated four times and averaged. Low Temperature Fluorescence Emission Spectra—The low temperature fluorescence emission spectra were recorded with a Hitachi F-4500 spectrofluorometer (Hitachi, Japan). The samples were diluted to 50 ng/ml Chl with 80% (v/v) glycerol in 50 mm HEPES/NaOH (pH 7.5) and then frozen in a sample tube by immersing the sample in liquid nitrogen. The fluorescence emission spectra were recorded from 600 to 780 nm, with the excitation wavelengths set to 480 nm or 436 nm, and slit widths set to 5 nm for excitation and 2.5 nm for emission. Chlorophyll Fluorescence Yield—Changing of Chl fluorescence yield upon the acidification of the medium was monitored with a Walz PAM 101 fluorometer (Walz, Effeltrich, Germany) with the method described in Ref. 26Ruban A.V. Young A. Horton P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1186: 123-127Crossref Scopus (112) Google Scholar, with the following modification: concentration of samples was adjusted to 0.5 μg/ml Chl in a medium containing 0.2 mm DM, 5 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.5) before the measurement. Acidification of the medium was achieved by adding HCl so that the pH of the medium reached the desired values (pH 6.0, 5.5, 5.0, and 4.5), and the Chl fluorescence was monitored continuously with the fluorometer. 30 s after the acidification; the N,N′-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCCD) (Sigma) was injected to the medium, so that the final concentration of DCCD was 0.02 mm. The changes of Chl fluorescence yield were further monitored. The whole measuring procedure was carried out with stirring at 20 °C. Thermal Stability Analysis—The thermal stability of reconstituted LHCII was measured by observing the decrease of energy transfer from complex-bound Chl b to Chl a upon gradual dissociation of the complexes at 37 °C. The samples were diluted to 10 μg/ml Chl with dilution buffer (12.5% (w/v) sucrose, 2.0 mm DM, and 5 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.5)). The decay of Chl a fluorescence emission (excitation and emission wavelengths of 480 and 680 nm with slit widths of 5 and 2.5 nm, respectively) was measured in a Hitachi F-4500 spectrofluorometer thermostatted to 37 °C. Measurements were taken for 18 min at 1-s intervals. The course of fluorescence decay was fitted into first-order kinetics (Y = Y0 + A·exp (-k·X)). The lifetimes of the complexes at the elevated temperature (37 °C) ware calculated based on the rate constant (k). The quality of the fitting was evaluated using residual R2 criteria. The R2 criterium was set to 0.95 for a good fitting. Photobleaching—The concentration of the samples was adjusted with the dilution buffer so that the absorption at the maximum in the Qy region was 0.75. The complexes were then illuminated with white light (4000 μE·m-2·s-1) with stirring. After each time interval, the cuvette was removed from the light source, and the absorption spectrum was recorded with a Shimadzu UV-VIS 2550 spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) in the range of 600-750 nm (27Formaggio E. Cinque G. Bassi R. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 314: 1157-1166Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Characteristics of Aggregation—LHCIIb aggregation was induced according to the method described in Ref. 28Gruszecki W.I. Grudzinski W. Gospodarek M. Patyra M. Maksymiec W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1757: 1504-1511Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar. The LHCIIb samples were diluted with detergent-free buffer so that the DM concentration was 0.049 mm. The sample was then centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The pellet containing LHCIIb aggregate was resuspended in 5 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.5) containing 0.049 mm DM. Fluorescence emission spectra were measured at 77 K as described above. Pigment Stoichiometries—The three amino acids, Val-119, His-120, and Ser-123, in the antiparallel strands in the lumenal loop domain between the TM helices B/C were exchanged to Phe, Leu, and Gly, respectively. All the mutants yielded stable reconstituted monomeric and trimeric complexes, as is shown with partially denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) (Fig. 1). The mobility of different mutant complexes was similar as that of the wild type (WT) LHCIIb, both in sucrose density gradient (data not shown) and in PAGE. The pigment stoichiometry of the WT and the mutant LHCIIb were calculated based on the pigment: (2 Luts) ratio as described in Ref. 29Yang C.H. Kosemund K. Cornet C. Paulsen H. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16205-16213Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar (Table 1). From Table 1, we can see that the reconstituted WT LHCIIb bound 7.61 Chl a, 7.20 Chl b, and 0.98 Neo. Compared with the WT LHCIIb, the three mutants bound about 0.55 less Chl b and 0.09 (V119F), 0.19 (S123G), and 0.27 (H120L) less Neo per monomer, respectively. It is shown from the pigment stoichiometry of different LHCIIb species that the mutagenesis in the lumenal loop not only reduced the Neo binding, but also disturbed the Chl b occupancy.TABLE 1Pigment composition of different recombinant LHCIIb complexesLhcb1Chl aChl bLutNeoWT7.61 ± 0.42aAll values are given as the average of 3-5 individual measurements ± standard deviation.7.20 ± 0.3120.98 ± 0.02S123G7.59 ± 0.126.65 ± 0.1120.79 ± 0.02H120L7.65 ± 0.116.58 ± 0.1720.71 ± 0.02V119F7.72 ± 0.036.62 ± 0.0420.89 ± 0.01a All values are given as the average of 3-5 individual measurements ± standard deviation. Open table in a new tab Absorption Spectra—To obtain information on the influence of mutagenesis on the transition energy of the chromophores in LHCIIb, absorption spectra of the recombinant LHCIIb were measured at room temperature (Fig. 2). The absorption maximum in the Qy region was at 674 nm (Qy transition of Chl a). The Qy transition of Chl b appeared at 650 nm as a shoulder. It is clearly shown, that the Qy transition of Chl b at 650 nm reduced strongly in all mutant LHCIIbs. Comparing the absorption spectra of the three mutants with those measured with the recombinant WT LHCIIb lacking Neo (30Croce R. Weiss S. Bassi R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29613-29623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 31Palacios M.A. Caffarri S. Bassi R. van Grondelle R. van Amerongen H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1656: 177-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), it can be seen that the mutant LHCIIb showed a similar decrease at 650 nm to the recombinant WT LHCIIb lacking Neo. The mutagenesis strongly influenced the absorption spectra in the Soret region. From the difference spectra (Fig. 2B), it is shown that all mutants possess a pronounced decrease in the absorption at 488 nm, which was ascribed to the 0-0 absorbance transition of Neo (32Ruban A.V. Pascal A.A. Robert B. Horton P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24862-24870Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Comparing the absorption spectra with the pigment stoichiometry measured with HPLC, it is apparent that the decrease in the absorbance at 488 nm is related mostly to the amount of Neo, because the amplitude at 488 nm in the difference spectra correlates well with the loss of Neo binding in different mutants. Circular Dichroism Spectra—Circular dichroism in the visible range reflects the excitonic pigment-pigment interactions, which is a powerful method to study the organizational state of LHCIIb. The CD spectrum of the WT LHCIIb (Fig. 3) exhibits the negative CD bands at 680 nm and 650 nm, with a shoulder at 648 nm in the Qy region and at 493 nm and 473 nm in the Soret region, the same as for the fully pigmented complexes (19Hobe S. Trostmann I. Raunser S. Paulsen H. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 25156-25166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 33Hobe S. Prytulla S. Kuhlbrandt W. Paulsen H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3423-3429Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the three mutants LHCIIb presented similar CD spectra, to varying extent, to those shown by the recombinant LHCIIb lacking part of Neo (19Hobe S. Trostmann I. Raunser S. Paulsen H. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 25156-25166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In the WT LHCIIb, the amplitude of the negative band at 493 nm was maximal in the Soret region, while the amplitude of the band at 473 nm was ∼two-thirds of that of 493 nm. In the mutants V119F, H120L, and S123G, the amplitude of the negative CD band at 493 nm decreased, while that of the CD band at 473 nm increased strongly. The ratio of the amplitude of these two negative CD signals in the Soret region (CD473 nm/CD493 nm: Neo-band) (Table 2) was calculated as described in Ref. 19Hobe S. Trostmann I. Raunser S.

From Table 2, we can see that compared to the WT LHCIIb, the change of the Neo-band is H120L > V119F > S123G. Comparing the change of the Neo-band (Table 2) with changes of the amount of the bound Neo in the complex (Table 1), it is apparent that the two factors are not correlated.TABLE 2Ratio of the amplitude of the CD signals at 473 nm and 493 nm (CD473 nm/CD493 nm: Neo band) in different recombinant LHCIIb complexesLhcb1Neo band (CD473 nm/CD493 nm)WT0.66 ± 0.15aThe values are given as the average of 5-8 individual measurements ± standard deviation.S123G1.23 ± 0.13H120L1.86 ± 0.04V119F1.70 ± 0.05a The values are given as the average of 5-8 individual measurements ± standard deviation. Open table in a new tab Low Temperature Fluorescence Emission Spectra—Fig. 4 shows the low temperature fluorescence emission spectra of all mutant species. From Fig. 4, it is shown that the fluorescence emission spectra of the different mutants are essentially identical to the WT LHCIIb; all exhibit characteristics of LHCIIb with one emission peak at 679 nm and a satellite peak at 740 nm, with no visible fluorescence emission from Chl b at shorter wavelength. The mutagenesis to the amino acids (Val-119, His-120, and Ser-123) in the lumenal region did not hinder the complete energy transfer from Chl b to Chl a within the complexes. Thermal Stability of Different LHCIIb Species—To test whether the mutagenesis causes changes in the structural stability of LHCIIb, the thermal stability of different LHCIIb species were investigated by monitoring the decay kinetics of Chl b-sensitized Chl a fluorescence emission at 37 °C, because only within the intact complexes can the excitation energy in Chl b be transferred to Chl a. The lifetime of the decay procedure was taken as a measure of the stability of different LHCIIb species (Table 3). To our surprise, the thermal stabilities of the trimeric form of all the mutants did not change significantly, although the pigment-pigment interactions, as we observed in CD spectra, did change drastically in different LHCIIb species.TABLE 3Stability of different recombinant complexes toward thermal denaturationLhcb1τ(s)WT132.13 ± 5.84aAll values are given as the average of 3-5 individual measurements ± standard deviation.S123G133.71 ± 10.39H120L134.17 ± 13.25V119F134.67 ± 7.37a All values are given as the average of 3-5 individual measurements ± standard deviation. Open table in a new tab LHCIIb Photoprotection—Under strong light conditions, if the overexcited singlet Chls* cannot be dissipated into heat, they may turn into triplet Chls*, which in turn react with 3O2* and form 1O2*. The singlet O2* is highly reactive and it oxidizes the Chls rapidly. As Neo is a good scavenger for singlet O2* (16Croce R. Remelli R. Varotto C. Breton J. Bassi R. FEBS Lett. 1999; 456: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), it is of interest to investigate whether changes in the Neo binding result in changes in the characteristics of photoprotection of LHCIIb under strong light conditions. The photobleaching of LHCIIb was evaluated by monitoring the decrease in the Qy absorption of the Chls bound in the complexes under strong illumination. Fig. 5 presents the time course of the photobleaching of LHCIIb under strong illuminations. From Fig. 5, it is shown that although the initial rate of photobleaching of different mutants remained unchanged, the stability of the mutant LHCIIb was reduced to different extents. The observed data were fitted into a first-order exponential decay function (Y = Y0 + A·exp(-k·X)) and the parameters Y0, A, and k were taken to analyze the photoprotection capacity of different LHCIIb species. The Y0 value is the asymptote for the decay function, which indicates the amount of pigment protected from bleaching (30Croce R. Weiss S. Bassi R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29613-29623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). The parameter A indicates the amount of pigment photobleached in the reaction, and τb (τb = 0.693/k) is the lifetime of the pigment in different LHCIIb species. Table 4 presented these parameters for the different LHCIIb species. In Table 4, it is shown that the photoprotection index of S123G is altered strongly. The Y0 value of S123G is reduced significantly compared with the WT LHCIIb, from 0.34 in the WT to about 0.08 in S123G (Table 4). The changes of the resistance to photodamage of H120L and V119F were not as significant a"
https://openalex.org/W2091872267,"Introduction HIV-1 is often acquired in the presence of pre-existing co-infections, such as Herpes Simplex Virus 2 (HSV-2). We examined the impact of HSV-2 status at the time of HIV-1 acquisition for its impact on subsequent clinical course, and total CD4+ T cell phenotypes. Methods We assessed the relationship of HSV-1/HSV-2 co-infection status on CD4+ T cell counts and HIV-1 RNA levels over time prior in a cohort of 186 treatment naïve adults identified during early HIV-1 infection. We assessed the activation and differentiation state of total CD4+ T cells at study entry by HSV-2 status. Results Of 186 recently HIV-1 infected persons, 101 (54 %) were sero-positive for HSV-2. There was no difference in initial CD8+ T cell count, or differences between the groups for age, gender, or race based on HSV-2 status. Persons with HIV-1/HSV-2 co-infection sustained higher CD4+ T cell counts over time (+69 cells/ul greater (SD = 33.7, p = 0.04) than those with HIV-1 infection alone (Figure 1), after adjustment for HIV-1 RNA levels (−57 cells per 1 log10 higher HIV-1 RNA, p<0.0001). We did not observe a relationship between HSV-2 infection status with plasma HIV-1 RNA levels over time. HSV-2 acquistion after HIV-1 acquisition had no impact on CD4+ count or viral load. We did not detect differences in CD4+ T cell activation or differentiation state by HSV-2+ status. Discussion We observed no effect of HSV-2 status on viral load. However, we did observe that treatment naïve, recently HIV-1 infected adults co-infected with HSV-2+ at the time of HIV-1 acquisition had higher CD4+ T cell counts over time. If verified in other cohorts, this result poses a striking paradox, and its public health implications are not immediately clear."
https://openalex.org/W2111928171,"Background Phototrophy of the extremely halophilic archaeon Halobacterium salinarum was explored for decades. The research was mainly focused on the expression of bacteriorhodopsin and its functional properties. In contrast, less is known about genome wide transcriptional changes and their impact on the physiological adaptation to phototrophy. The tool of choice to record transcriptional profiles is the DNA microarray technique. However, the technique is still rarely used for transcriptome analysis in archaea. Methodology/Principal Findings We developed a whole-genome DNA microarray based on our sequence data of the Hbt. salinarum strain R1 genome. The potential of our tool is exemplified by the comparison of cells growing under aerobic and phototrophic conditions, respectively. We processed the raw fluorescence data by several stringent filtering steps and a subsequent MAANOVA analysis. The study revealed a lot of transcriptional differences between the two cell states. We found that the transcriptional changes were relatively weak, though significant. Finally, the DNA microarray data were independently verified by a real-time PCR analysis. Conclusion/Significance This is the first DNA microarray analysis of Hbt. salinarum cells that were actually grown under phototrophic conditions. By comparing the transcriptomics data with current knowledge we could show that our DNA microarray tool is well applicable for transcriptome analysis in the extremely halophilic archaeon Hbt. salinarum. The reliability of our tool is based on both the high-quality array of DNA probes and the stringent data handling including MAANOVA analysis. Among the regulated genes more than 50% had unknown functions. This underlines the fact that haloarchaeal phototrophy is still far away from being completely understood. Hence, the data recorded in this study will be subject to future systems biology analysis."
https://openalex.org/W1987057093,"It is not known why leader peptides are removed by the mitochondrial processing peptidase after import into the matrix space. The leaders of yeast aldehyde dehydrogenase (pALDH) and malate dehydrogenase were mutated so that they would not be processed after import. The recombinant nonprocessed precursor of yeast pALDH possessed a similar specific activity as the corresponding mature form but was much less stable. The nonprocessed pALDH was transformed into a yeast strain missing ALDHs. The transformed yeast grew slowly on ethanol as the sole carbon source showing that the nonprocessed precursor was functional in vivo. Western blot analysis showed that the amount of precursor was 15-20% of that found in cells transformed with the native enzyme.

By using carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone, we showed that the nonprocessed precursor was degraded in the matrix space. The nonprocessed precursor forms of precursor yeast malate dehydrogenase and rat liver pALDH also were degraded in the matrix space of HeLa cell mitochondria faster than their corresponding mature forms.

Collectively, this study showed that the precursor form is less stable in the matrix space than is the mature form and provides an explanation for why the leader peptide is removed from the precursors. The vast majority of mitochondrial matrix space proteins are nuclear encoded and synthesized as precursor proteins with an extension of amino acids at their N-terminal end that functions as a mitochondrial import signal sequence (1Neupert W.

It was shown that pre-fumarase was less active than its mature form (7Sass E. Blachinsky E. Karniely S. Pines O. J. Biol.

Deletion of the mitochondrial processing peptidase was lethal to aerobically growing yeast (9Yaffe M.P. Ohta S. Schatz G. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 2069-2074Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). This implies that in vivo it is necessary to convert some, if not all, of the precursor proteins to their mature counterpart. It is not known what is the fate of a precursor protein should it remained unprocessed. Recently, however, investigators found that the leaders cleaved by MPP are degraded to smaller fragments by two protease enzymes present in plant mitochondria and chloroplast (10Glaser E. Nilsson S. Bhushan S. Biol. Chem. 2006; 387: 1441-1447Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). These enzymes are not reported to be found in yeast or mammalian cells. While studying structure/functional relationships of leader sequences (11Hammen P.K. Waltner M. Hahnemann B. Heard T.S. Weiner H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21041-21048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 12Waltner M. Weiner H. J. Biol.

Chem. 1993; 268: 19906-19914Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we were able to convert some into ones that became nonprocessable and found that they were imported into mitochondria, but the long term fate of the protein was not investigated. It is known that synthetic peptide corresponding to the leader sequence can bind to the mitochondrial membranes (14Pak Y.K. Weiner H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14298-14307Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is possible then that the nonprocessed precursor proteins might bind to the matrix side of the inner membrane after they were translocated into the matrix space. Alternatively, the presence of the leader sequence might affect the rate of folding as well as the stability of the protein, thus increasing the rate of degradation. The three-dimensional structure of the mature form of human liver mitochondrial ALDH, but not the precursor, has been determined (15Steinmetz C.G. Xie P. Weiner H. Hurley T.D. Structure (Lond.). 1997; 5: 701-711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar, 16Ni L. Zhou J. Hurley T.D. Weiner H. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 2784-2790Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The first seven residues were not detected, so it cannot be stated with certainty where the leader might be located on the precursor molecule. It possibly could be located on the surface of the subunit as the first seven residues of mature protein appeared to be located on the surface. Should this be the case then the leader would be exposed to solvent. If for other proteins the N termini are buried in the protein, then it is apparent why it must be removed before the protein folds in the matrix space. A number of diseases have been reported that are a result of missing a nuclear coded matrix space protein (17MacKenzie J.A. Payne R.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2007; 1772: 509-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). A mutation occurring in the leader could make it nonprocessable, and then, if the precursor proved to be unstable, an explanation for finding a decreased level of protein can be offered. We undertook a study to investigate the fate of a nonprocessed precursor protein. By employing a yeast strain that had three of its chromosomal ALDHs disrupted (18Wang X. Mann C.J. Bai Y. Ni L. Weiner H. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 822-830Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and modifying yeast pALDH so it became nonprocessable, it was possible to study the fate of a nonprocessed precursor ALDH in vivo.We went on to also use rat pALDH and precursor malate dehydrogenase (pMDH) in HeLa cells to test further the stability of the nonprocessed precursor proteins. We report here that the nonprocessed precursor of yeast pALDH was active but rapidly degraded in the mitochondrial matrix space. We show here that rat nonprocessed pALDH and yeast nonprocessed pMDH were also degraded in matrix space faster than their corresponding mature forms. Yeast Strains and Growth Conditions—Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain was used to isolate yeast mitochondria for the import reactions. The triple ALDH-disrupted yeast strain HWTHL10, which was previously constructed in this laboratory (18Wang X. Mann C.J. Bai Y. Ni L. Weiner H. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 822-830Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), was used for ALDH expression in yeast, yeast growth complement assays, and pulse-chase experiments. Nontransformed yeast was grown in YPD (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, and 2% glucose). Transformed yeast was grown in acetate medium (2% glucose, 0.5% acetate, pH 5.7, 0.67% yeast nitrogen base, and 0.074% complete supplement mixture lacking uracil) or in ethanol medium (2% ethanol, 0.5% glucose, 0.67% yeast nitrogen base, and 0.074% complete supplement mixture lacking uracil). Cloning of ALDH and MDH Genes—Yeast and rat mitochondrial pALDHs as well as the mutated form of the rat liver enzyme were previously cloned (11Hammen P.K. Waltner M. Hahnemann B. Heard T.S. Weiner H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21041-21048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 18Wang X. Mann C.J. Bai Y. Ni L. Weiner H. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 822-830Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). They were subcloned in the Escherichia coli expression vector pT7-7 and the bacterial/yeast shuttle vector pRS316m that carried the yeast pALDH native promoter and terminator. The yeast R18Q,R22Q mutant pALDH was prepared by overlapping-extension PCR and subcloned in the above two vectors. The mature ALDH was prepared by deleting the presequence portion (residues 2-25) and subcloned into pT7-7. pMDH was cloned using yeast genomic DNA as a template, and primers for PCR were selected on the basis of the published sequence. The pMDH was cloned into pET-24a vector. The mutant pMDH was made by overlapping extension PCR and subcloned to the pET-24a vector. Mitochondrial Import—[35S]Methionine-labeled pALDHs were synthesized using a TnT Quick kit (Promega). Isolation of yeast mitochondria was conducted according to a published protocol (19Glick B.S. Pon L.A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 260: 213-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). The import of precursor proteins into isolated yeast mitochondria was carried out as described previously (20Mukhopadhyay A. Heard T.S. Wen X. Hammen P.K. Weiner H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13712-13718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). HeLa cells were kindly provided by Prof. Steven Broyles (Purdue University). The cells were suspended in import buffer and homogenized. Mitochondria were isolated by differential centrifugation as performed previously (21Mukhopadhyay A. Ni L. Yang C.S. Weiner H. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2005; 62: 1890-1899Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). For import of proteins, TnT-synthesized precursor proteins were added to isolated HeLa cell mitochondria and incubated for 30, 60, or 90 min. The import reaction for pMDH and mutant pMDH volume was 100 μl. After incubation for 30 min, 30 μl was removed and proteinase K was added to terminate the import reaction. The remaining 70 μl was kept at room temperature. After another 30 min of incubation, 30 μl was removed and proteinase K was added to this 30 μl to stop the import reactions. The remaining 40 μl was kept at room temperature for another 30 min. 30 μl was then removed, and proteinase K was added. For each time period, proteins imported into mitochondria were determined. To investigate precursor protein degradation in HeLa cell mitochondria, a slightly different protocol was employed. The TnT-synthesized precursor proteins were incubated with isolated HeLa cell mitochondria. The import reaction volume was 100 μl and was incubated for 30 min at 30 °C. After incubation for 30 min, proteinase K was added to the 100-μl import reaction to terminate the import. A 30-μl sample was removed. The mitochondria were centrifuged, and the proteins imported within 30 min were determined. The remaining 70 μl was kept at room temperature. After another 30 min of incubation, 30 μl was removed. The mitochondria were isolated, and the proteins imported were determined. The remaining 40 μl was kept at room temperature for another 30 min. Finally, a 30-μl sample was removed. Mitochondria were isolated, and the amount of imported proteins was determined. The inhibition of MPP by o-phenanthroline was performed with yeast mitochondria. Yeast mitochondria were isolated as described (4Mukhopadhyay A. Hammen P. Waltner-Law M. Weiner H. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 1026-1035Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Purified mitochondria were incubated with 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8 mm o-phenanthroline on ice for 15 min to inhibit MPP. Import of wild type rat pALDH was then performed with mitochondria incubated with each concentration of o-phenanthroline. The import was carried out as outlined for HeLa cell mitochondria import. Briefly, import was carried out for 30 min, and then proteinase K was added. A 30-μl sample was removed, and mitochondria were isolated. The amount of protein imported after 30 min was quantified. The remaining 70 μl of the reaction solution was kept at room temperature in the presence of proteinase K to destroy all proteins not imported into mitochondria. After 30 min another 30-μl aliquot was removed; mitochondria were isolated, and the amount of imported protein was quantified. Processing by Purified Yeast MPP—Processing was performed as described previously (4Mukhopadhyay A. Hammen P. Waltner-Law M. Weiner H. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 1026-1035Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Briefly, a processing assay consisted of 2 μl of TnT Quick system, 1 μl (∼0.05 μg) of the processing enzyme, 2 μl of buffer containing 100 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.3, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.1 mm MnCl2 (final volume was adjusted to 20 μl with water) and was incubated for 30 min at 27 °C. The reaction was terminated by the addition of an equal volume of SDS treatment buffer. Samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE and analyzed by a PhosphorImager. Protein Expression and Purification—Plasmids carrying yeast ALDH genes on the pT7-7 vector were transformed into the E. coli strain BL21(DE3)-RIL CodonPlus (Novagen) and then induced overnight at 16 °C with 0.4 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogal-actoside in Terrific Broth to express the aldehyde dehydrogenases. Cells were harvested, resuspended in the buffer (20 mm sodium phosphate pH 7.4, 2.0 mm EDTA, 1.0 mm dithiothreitol, and 1.0 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride), and then lysed by a French cell press at 4 °C. The samples were clarified and then treated with 5 mg/ml protamine sulfate. After dialysis, proteins were loaded on a DEAE-Sephacel column (Sigma) and then eluted with a linear NaCl gradient (0-500 mm). Samples were analyzed for catalytic activity assay with propionaldehyde as substrate and NAD as coenzyme and then subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis. Fractions containing the highest activities were collected and dialyzed against an EDTA-free buffer (20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, and 0.1 mm dithiothreitol). The protein was further separated on a pre-packed 5-ml Econo-Pac CHT-II cartridge (Bio-Rad) by elution with a sodium phosphate gradient (20-250 mm). Enzyme assays or activity staining was carried out essentially as described previously (18Wang X. Mann C.J. Bai Y. Ni L. Weiner H. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 822-830Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Yeast Growth Rate Comparison—Transformed HWTHL10 cells were first grown to the same cell density in acetate-containing medium. Cells were washed twice with water, resuspended in the ethanol medium, and then inoculated into the ethanol liquid medium or on agar plates. The initial cell density was manipulated to be the same for the various yeast cells harboring different plasmids. After a period of growth at 30 °C, cell densities of the liquid culture or colony sizes on agar plates were compared. Protein Extraction from Yeast—Yeast cells were lysed by French cell press in a nondenaturing buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride) followed by clarification by centrifugation to prepare nondenatured protein samples that could be used in the activity assays. For the Western blot analysis, proteins were also extracted by treating the yeast cells at 97 °C for 10-15 min in the SDS buffer (200 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 400 mm dithiothreitol, 4% SDS, 20% glycerol, and 0.2% bromphenol blue) followed by centrifugation to clarify the solutions. Yeast ALDH Level Comparison—The ALDH levels in yeast were compared by activity staining and Western blot analysis. Transformed HWTHL10 cells were initially grown to same cell density in the acetate medium. Cells were washed twice with water and then re-grown in the ethanol medium. ALDHs were extracted from the yeast cells using the above homogenization method followed by activity staining or extracted by the above SDS-treating method followed by Western blot analysis. The ALDH levels were compared by analyzing the band densities with the ChemiImager (Alpha Innotech). Submitochondrial Localization of ALDH—Radiolabeling and mitochondrial import reactions with the yeast wild type pALDH and mutant pALDH were performed in two separate Eppendorf tubes. The nonimported pALDHs were destroyed by proteinase K treatment. Mitochondria with imported pALDHs were combined, pelleted, washed with the mitochondrial suspension medium (0.6 m mannitol and 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4), and then resuspended in the same medium. The mitochondria were then subjected to digitonin treatments (0, 0.05, 0.10, 0.15, 0.20, 0.25, and 0.30% (w/v)) (22Hartl F.U. Ostermann J. Guiard B. Neupert W. Cell. 1987; 51: 1027-1037Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar) for 60 s and then immediately diluted with the mitochondrial suspension medium. Supernatants and pellets were separated by centrifugation at 48,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C and then subjected to SDS-PAGE analysis followed by quantification with the PhosphorImager. Pulse-Chase and Immunoprecipitation—Pulse-chase experiments were performed based upon those designed by Fujiki and Verner (23Fujiki M. Verner K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1914-1920Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Transformed yeast was grown in the acetate medium to mid-log phase. Cells were washed twice with water, resuspended at 0.5-1.0 A600/ml in 10 ml of the ethanol medium lacking methionine, and then incubated for 1-2 h at 30 °C. Cells were collected and then resuspended in 1 ml of the methionine-free medium. Pulse was performed at 30 °C for 10-20 min by the addition of 20-50 μCi of [35S]methionine in the presence or absence of 20 μm carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP). Cells were washed once with water after centrifugation and then resuspended in the methionine-free medium. Chase was initiated by the addition of 100 mg/ml unlabeled methionine. Aliquots were taken at different times. Chase was terminated by the addition of 50 mm NaN3 and then incubated on ice. Proteins were extracted by SDS treatment. Immunoprecipitation was performed according to the protocols provided by Santa Cruz Biotechnology, the manufacturer of protein A-agarose. Limited Digestion of Precursor Proteins with Proteinase K—Wild type rat pALDH and mutant precursor R17Q were incubated with proteinase K at a concentration of 0.28 μg/ml for 0, 30, 60, and 90 min. The samples were run on 10% SDS-PAGE followed by PhosphorImager analysis. In Vitro and in Vivo Import of Nonprocessed Yeast pALDH—From the amino acid sequence of yeast pALDH, we predicted that the precursor had a leader peptide consisting of 24 amino acids because the amino acid sequence RHXHR starts at position 18, a consensus site recognized by mitochondrial processing peptidase (Fig. 1) (3Gakh O. Cavadini P. Isaya G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1592: 63-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). The positively charged residues at positions 18 and 22 were mutated to glutamine to destroy the purported processing site. The wild type and the mutant pALDH were incubated with purified yeast MPP and found that the wild type was processed, whereas the mutant was not (Fig. 2A). To investigate the fate of a nonprocessed precursor in the matrix space, the wild type and the nonprocessed pALDH were employed in an in vitro and in vivo import study. TnT-synthesized wild type and the mutant pALDH were incubated with isolated yeast mitochondria. The data showed that the wild type yeast pALDH and the mutant precursor (R18Q,R22Q) proteins both were imported as expected. The wild type was processed whereas the R18Q,R22Q double mutant was not processed (Fig. 2B).FIGURE 2Processing and import of yeast pALDH. A, processing of yeast pALDH mutants by purified MPP.

Lane 1, pALDH; lane 2, mutant; lane 3, pALDH.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The triple ALDH-disrupted yeast strain HWTHL10, previously constructed in this laboratory (18Wang X. Mann C.J. Bai Y. Ni L. Weiner H. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 822-830Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), was used here to test for the in vivo import and processing of the modified pALDH leader. This yeast strain was transformed with the recombinant plasmids carrying the yeast pALDH genes and also with empty vector pRS316m as control. Western blot was used to determine whether or not pALDH was produced (Fig. 2C). The wild type ALDH gene produced a mature-size ALDH implying that the precursor was imported and processed just as it was in the in vitro study. The R18Q,R22Q double mutant gene produced a precursor size ALDH implying that this form could have been imported but not processed. Both pALDH and the Mutant pALDH Are Localized in mitochondrial Matrix Space—To verify that the mutant nonprocessed pALDH was translocated to the matrix space and not stuck inside the inter-membrane space, a fractionation study after import was performed. TnT-synthesized wild type and nonprocessed pALDH were incubated with isolated yeast mitochondria, and after proteinase K digestion, a digitonin fractionation was used to determine where in the yeast mitochondria were the ALDHs localized. Cytochrome b2, an inter membrane space protein, appeared in the supernatant fraction starting from 0.05% digitonin (w/v) (Fig. 3). Aconitase, a matrix protein, started to appear in the supernatant starting from 0.10% digitonin. The mature ALDH and the nonprocessed mutant pALDH had similar distributions and were found essentially in the same fractions with aconitase. These findings led us to suggest that the both proteins were imported into the mitochondrial matrix space. The Nonprocessed pALDH Is Functional in Vivo—The inability of triple disrupted yeast strain to grow on ethanol allowed us to compare the growth rate on ethanol to determine whether the nonprocessed pALDH was functional. Yeast strain HWTHL10 carrying the empty vector pRS316m did not grow on ethanol, whereas yeast carrying the wild type pALDH did gene grow (Fig. 4). Yeast carrying the mutant pALDH gene also grew but at a slower rate compared with the cells carrying the wild type precursor (Fig. 4). The yeast growth rates in liquid medium showed that the mutant grew at ∼10% that of the wild type. These results indicated that the mutant pALDH could partially complement growth of the deleted yeast strain on ethanol medium, showing that the enzyme was functional in vivo. Less Mutant pALDH Accumulated in the Yeast Compared with the Wild Type ALDH—To determine the amount of imported ALDH in mitochondria, HWTHL10 cells carrying different recombinant plasmids were transformed. Cells grown to the same A600 were found to possess the same amount of total protein, as determined by the Bradford method. The extracts from cells with the same amount of total protein were either separated by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blot analysis or separated by isoelectric focusing gel electrophoresis followed by activity staining. The Western blot revealed that the amount of mutant pALDH was only 15-20% of mature ALDH. The activity staining showed that the activity of mutant pALDH was also ∼15% of mature ALDH. This indicated that the mutant pALDH was nearly as active as the mature ALDH. The slow yeast growth of nonprocessed pALDH on ethanol as we observed here was a result of having a lower total activity of aldehyde dehydrogenase in the cells. Yeast Mature ALDH and the Mutant pALDH Had Similar Specific Activity—To verify that the mutant pALDH and mature ALDH had the same specific activity, both proteins were expressed in E. coli. It was possible to purify the mutant pALDH to homogeneity. The specific activity was found 21 units/mg protein. The mature ALDH co-eluted with a non-ALDH protein and was purified to just 50% as judged by SDS-PAGE analysis followed by quantification. The solutions of enzymes with same amount of aldehyde dehydrogenase activity, determined by fluorometric assays, were subjected to SDS-PAGE analysis followed by quantification. The quantity of the mature ALDH was found to be about 80% that of the mutant pALDH. This implies that the activity of the mutant pALDH (21 units/mg) could be estimated to be about around 80% that of the mature ALDH (25.3 units/mg) showing that both proteins had a similar specific activity consistent to what was found with the in vivo study. The Mutant pALDH Was Degraded Faster than the Wild Type ALDH in Mitochondrial Matrix Space—Finding less pALDH mutant in the transformed yeast made it appear that the mutant enzyme was less stable in vivo than was the native enzyme. To test for this, a pulse-chase followed by an immunoprecipitation experiment was performed. The transformed HWTHL10 carrying the wild type pALDH or the mutant pALDH was initially radiolabeled with [35S]methionine in the presence or absence of CCCP (Fig. 5A), a proton ionophore that uncouples mitochondria and inhibits protein import (23Fujiki M. Verner K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1914-1920Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the case of the wild type yeast pALDH gene, m"

BSD is a member of the cytidine deaminase (CDA) family; it is a zinc-dependent enzyme with three cysteines and one water molecule as zinc ligands. The crystal structures of BSD were determined in six states (i.e. native, substrate-bound, product-bound, cacodylate-bound, substrate-bound E56Q mutant, and R90K mutant). In the structures, the zinc position and coordination structures vary. The substrate-bound structure shows a large positional and geometrical shift of zinc with a double-headed electron density of the substrate that seems to be assigned to the amino and hydroxyl groups of the substrate and product, respectively. In this intermediate-like structure, the steric hindrance of the hydroxyl group pushes the zinc into the triangular plane consisting of three cysteines with a positional shift of ∼0.6 Å, and the fifth ligand water approaches the opposite direction of the substrate with a shift of 0.4 Å. Accordingly, the zinc coordination is changed from tetrahedral to trigonal bipyramidal, and its coordination distance is extended between zinc and its intermediate. The shift of zinc and the recruited water is also observed in the structure of the inactivated E56Q mutant. This novel observation is different in two-cysteine cytidine deaminase Escherichia coli CDA and might be essential for the reaction mechanism in BSD, since it is useful for the easy release of the product by charge compensation and for the structural change of the substrate.

The zinc ion plays crucial roles in forming the catalytic centers of enzymes and stabilizes the three-dimensional structures of proteins (1McCall K.A. Huang C. Fierke C.A. J.

EC 3.5.4.23) from Aspergillus terreus strain S-712 (ATCC 28865) is a zinc-dependent homotetrameric enzyme composed of one zinc ion and 130 amino acids per subunit (4Kimura M. Kamakura T. Tao Q.Z.

Biochem. 2000; 127: 955-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). It catalyzes the conversion of a cytidine derivative blasticidin S (BS) into non-toxic deaminohydroxy BS (OH-BS) (Fig. 1A) (6Yamaguchi I. Shibata H. Seto H. Misato T. J. Antibiot. 1975; 28: 7-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 7Yamaguchi I. Seto H. Misato T. Pesticide Biochem. Physiol. 1986; 25: 54-62Crossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar). BS is a potent antifungal and cytotoxic peptidyl nucleoside antibiotic (8Takeuchi S. Hirayama K. Ueda K. Sakai H. Yonehara H. J. Antibiot. Ser. A. 1958; 11: 1-5PubMed Google Scholar). The structural determination of the 50S ribosomal subunit and BS complex revealed a mechanism inhibiting peptide translocation in protein synthesis (9Hansen J.L. Moore P.B. Steitz T.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 330: 1061-1075Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). Because the cytidine core of the BS molecule tightly binds to the corresponding guanine base at the P-site of the 50S ribosome with a Watson-Crick base pair, the uridination of the cytidine core by deamination prevents the induction of the interaction with guanine. Because of this property, BS and BSD are widely used as reporting markers for transformation in the genetic engineering of eukaryotic cells (10Kimura M. Takatsuki A. Yamaguchi I. Biochim. Biophys.

BSD is a member of the cytidine deaminase (CDA) family and has high sequence homology to tetrameric CDAs such as Bacillus subtilis CDA (BsCDA), Saccharomyces cerevisiae CDA (ScCDA), human CDA (HsCDA), and mouse CDA (MmCDA) (11Johansson E.

Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 7825-7833Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). CDA is a zinc-dependent enzyme of the pyrimidine salvage pathway and catalyzes the reaction of cytidine to produce uridine. The proposed reaction mechanism suggests that a deprotonated water molecule is provided by the reaction between a zinc ion and a catalytic glutamate residue, and the amino group of the substrate nucleoside is replaced by a hydroxyl group. The CDA family shares the two common sequence motifs C(H)XE and PCXXC, which are involved in catalysis and zinc binding, respectively (15Reizer J. Buskirk S. Bairoch A. Reizer A. Saier Jr., M.H. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 853-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). In the CDA family, two different types of cytidine deaminase structure have been revealed: tetrameric CDAs, which are assembled with a 222 symmetry and their zinc ligands comprise three cysteines (CCC) (11Johansson E. Mejlhede N. Neuhard J. Larsen S. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 2563-2570Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar); and dimeric CDAs, which are composed of two pseudodimer subunits and take one histidine and two cysteines (HCC) as zinc ligands (16Betts L. Xiang S. Short S.A. Wolfenden R. Carter Jr., C.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 635-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). CCC coordination is rarely found in the catalytic centers of zinc enzymes, because the excessive negative charge of additional deprotonated cysteine ligands might reduce the catalytic activity of dimeric CDAs. HsCDA is pharmacologically important in the metabolism of cytidine-derived anticancer drugs (17Müller W.E.G. Zahn R.K. Cancer Res. 1979; 39: 1102-1107PubMed Google Scholar); therefore, information on the structure and function of CDAs will be valuable for the detoxification of drug-sensitive hematopoietic cells (18Steuart C.D. Burke P.J. Nat. New Biol. 1971; 223: 109-110Crossref Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Thus, information on the reaction mechanism, including the charge compensation of the zinc environment, has been analyzed and discussed (19Xiang S. Short S.A. Wolfenden R. Carter Jr., C.W. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1335-1341Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 20Xiang S. Short S.A. Wolfenden R. Carter Jr., C.W.

Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1335-1341Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The zinc ion takes various numbers and kinds of ligands because of its zero ligand-field stabilization energy owing to its having a filled d orbital and its function as a Lewis acid for accepting pairs of electrons. In particular, its coordination flexibility for polypeptide chains appears to be essential in many types of enzymatic reaction. As observed in crystallographic studies to date, the coordination geometry of the zinc ion varies and the zinc ion appears to act as a powerful electrophilic catalyst through the activation of an accompanying water molecule and a carboxylate group. The zinc ion is classified as a borderline cation according to its polarizability in hard and soft acid/base (HSAB) theory; it mostly prefers moderate nitrogen ligands although it can also accept hard and soft anions. As a result, four amino acid side chains, i.e. histidine, aspartic acid, glutamic acid, and cysteine, have been observed as protein ligands. Most reaction mechanisms of zinc enzymes have been discussed in terms of bond valence buffer theory. However, the dynamic properties of catalytic zinc remain to be elucidated, since the measurement of the properties is difficult because of the silent character of zinc in various spectroscopic methods. To elucidate the novel substrate recognition and reaction mechanisms; here we report the crystal structures of BSD in six states: native, substrate-bound, product-bound, cacodylate-bound, substrate-E56Q mutant, and R90K mutant. The appearance of two different zinc coordination structures suggests charge compensation resulting from dynamic adjustments in coordination in several crystalline states. Structural Determination of BSD—Recombinant BSD and its mutant were expressed in E. coli, purified and crystallized according to the procedure described in previous reports (5Kimura M. Sekido S. Isogai Y. Yamaguchi I. J. Biochem. 2000; 127: 955-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 22Nakasako M. Kimura M. Yamaguchi I. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1999; 54: 547-548Crossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Crystallization was carried out using a solution of 20% (w/v) PEG8000, 50 mm magnesium chloride, and 0.1 m sodium cacodylate at pH 7.0 as precipitant. The cacodylic ion occupied the active site of BSD in the crystal obtained from this solution; therefore, it was called a cacodylate-bound crystal, and the cacodylate buffer was changed to 50 mm Tris (pH 7.0) to obtain completely native crystals. These crystals belong to the space group P212121, and one asymmetric unit contains one BSD tetramer. The multiwavelength anomalous diffraction (MAD) method was used to determine phases, and the data set was collected under cryogenic conditions using the Rigaku R-AXIS IV at the BL45XU-PX station of SPring-8, Harima, Japan, as the first attempt to perform a trichromatic procedure (23Yamamoto M. Kumasaka T. Fujisawa T. Ueki T. J. Synchrotron Rad. 1998; 5: 222-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). This procedure enables us to take diffraction images with a rapid alteration of three-wavelength x-ray beams. Hence, the dispersive differences of anomalous effects can be estimated very accurately (24Kumasaka T. Yamamoto M. Yamashita E. Moriyama H. Ueki T. Structure. 2002; 10: 1205-1210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The data for structural refinements were also collected separately. All diffraction images were processed using an HKL suite (25Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38572) Google Scholar) (see Table 1). The positions of the four zinc atoms were determined using Bijvoet and dispersive anomalous Patterson maps. The initial MAD phase set was calculated using the program MLPHARE (26Number Collaborative Computational Project Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19769) Google Scholar) and further improved using DM (26Number Collaborative Computational Project Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19769) Google Scholar) by noncrystallographic symmetry averaging for the tetrameric assembly of BSD. The electron density maps allowed the unambiguous modeling of 125 residues in each subunit except for one N-terminal and four C-terminal residues. Densities corresponding to cacodylic ions as well as zinc ions were observed in the anomalous difference Fourier map using the collected data (the f″ value of arsenic atom is ∼3.5e- at an x-ray wavelength of 1.02 Å); thus, the ion models were also included. The Ramachandran plot of the refined model was sound, because all the residues except glycines and prolines were in their most favored and allowed regions (27Laskowski R.A. McArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thronton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). All the structural models in this study were constructed using program O (28Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. 1991; D50: 110-119Crossref Scopus (13011) Google Scholar) and refined with CNS (29Brünger A.T. et al.Acta Crystallogr. Sect.

OH-BS was produced from BS by an enzymatic process. A marginally active E56Q mutant and a charge-compensation residue R90K mutant were constructed by site-directed mutagenesis using a PCR technique. All the crystals except one had a similar lattice parameter with the same space group to the crystal in the native state, and their initial structures were immediately determined by rigid body refinement of the native structure. On the other hand, only the crystal of the substrate-native enzyme complex belonged to a different space group, P43212, despite the similar crystallization conditions. The crystal contained two subunits in an asymmetric unit and its structure was determined by the molecular replacement method on the basis of the structure of the substrate-unbound state using the program AMoRe (26Number Collaborative Computational Project Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19769) Google Scholar). During the structural refinement of the substrate-native complex, 2FO - FC maps showed a double-headed electron density near the catalytic zinc ion that was likely to be the reaction intermediate of BS. The corresponding molecular models of such BS states (see Figs. 1 and 2, and text) were constructed with MOLDA (30Yoshida H. Matsuura H. J. Chem. Software. 1997; 3: 147-156Crossref Google Scholar) and optimized with MOPAC7 (31Stewart J.J.P. J. Comp. Aid. Mol. Design. 1990; 4: 1-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (2816) Google Scholar). The structural restriction of the model was included except the torsion and bond angle between the pyrimidine and carbohydrate rings in the structural refinement with CNS and Refmac. Overall Structure—The tetrameric BSD structure is 45 × 45 × 40 Å (Fig. 1B). The refined BSD model consists of four identical peptides of 125 amino acids (A-, B-, C-, and D-chains). All subunits have identical folding patterns and are related by a 222 point group symmetry. In fact, the root mean square differences among the four subunits are within 0.4 Å for the main chain atoms. Each subunit is composed of a six-stranded β-sheet, sandwiched by α-helices (Fig. 1C) and is classified into the modified Greek key motif similarly to CDAs. The structure of the N-terminal-half of one monomer (1–80) begins with an α-helix (α1, Gln5-Ser20). This α-helix is embraced by an anti-parallel β-sheet (β1, Val29-Ser36; β2, Ile40-Val44; β3, Cys73-Gly78). An additional α-helix (α2, Ala55-Ala65) protrudes from the other side of the β-sheet wall. A long lariat-like region (loop β2-α2: Asn45-Pro53) connects the β-sheet (β1, β2, β3) and α2. A very short strand (β4, Ile84-Leu85) and a continuous loop connect the latter half of the monomer. This portion contains two anti-parallel strands (β5, Lys103-Lys107; β6, Thr114-Gly117) and two α-helices (α3, Cys88-Leu98; α4, Arg119-Leu121). In this domain, all secondary structures have the same orientation except α4. The crystal structures of the native and substrate-bound states (Fig. 1, B and C) are very similar, as indicated by the r.m.s. difference for all protein atoms at ca. 0.6 Å despite of the different space groups. Active Site Pockets and Substrate Recognition—The active site is located at the bottom of a deep (10 Å in depth) and narrow (5 Å in width) pocket formed by the helices α2 (Tyr47A, Cys54A, Glu56A), α3 (Cys88A, Cys91A) and residues from two adjacent subunits (Tyr126B and Phe49C) (Fig. 1C). The three aromatic residues form the side wall of the pocket, and Tyr126 from the adjacent subunit likely plays the role of a lid for the pocket entrance. Part of the pocket is composed of a loop connecting β2 and α2 in the adjacent subunit. The pocket surface is positively charged because of Arg82 and the zinc ion (Fig. 2). Furthermore, a flexible C-terminal region (Val127-Gly130) extends into the pocket. The recognition scheme with the pyrimidine ring of BS is similar to that between EcCDA and cytidine (16Betts L. Xiang S. Short S.A. Wolfenden R. Carter Jr., C.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 635-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). However, four amino acids (Ser28, Phe49, Arg82, and Tyr126) interact with the carbohydrate (enopyranuronic acid) portion and the additional tail portion including the guanidium group (Fig. 2). To expand the active site pocket for accepting the larger tail portion, BSD folds the loop regions in a more compact manner than other CDAs: (i) strand β1 is shortened, (ii) loop α1-βl protrudes to the molecular surface, and (iii) loop β2-α2 occupies the inside of the molecule. Tetramer Formation—Subunit interfaces of the tetramer are located near active site pockets. The interface is formed by the loop (residues 47–52) of β2 to α2 and four α2 helices from all subunits at the symmetric center. Tyr47, His48, Phe49, and Asp97 form a hydrogen bond network to stabilize subunit association. The mutation of these residues probably influences tetramer formation, and the H48Q mutant of BSD shows no catalytic activity (data not shown). Additionally, two interactions tightly support the tetramer: (i) α2 and the loop (residues 23–28) of α1-β1, and (ii) C-terminal residues 124–126 and two helices α3 from neighboring subunits. In the formation of the tetramer architecture, each Arg90 of four subunits may play a key role. Each arginine faces each other at the center of the tetramer interface, and shows two alternative conformations proximal and distal to the zinc (Fig. 3A). Arg90A (Arg90 of subunit A) in the proximal configuration forms hydrogen bonds with three main chain carbonyl groups: Gly51A, Thr50C, Thr50D. The latter two carbonyls also form hydrogen bonds with the adjacent Arg90B in the distal configuration. This hydrogen bond network tightly connects the subunits to each other. The vacant space of the tetrameric center is likely occupied by two water molecules. Four residual peaks that were assigned to water were observed. However, the distances between the two pairs of peaks were too short to be hydrogen bonds. Therefore, two alternate arrangements of the four arginines and two water molecules are proposed, as shown in Fig. 3A. In one arrangement (cyan atoms) Arg90A and Arg90C are in the proximal configuration and Arg90B and Arg90D are in the distal configuration. In the other arrangement (yellow atoms), Arg90A and Arg90C are in the distal configuration and Arg90B and Arg90D are in the proximal configuration. Compared with other CDAs, the pool of water molecules observed in the tetramer interfaces of BsCDA and MmCDA was eliminated in BSD (Fig. 3). This is the result of the loop β2-α2 occupation for expanding active site pocket as described before. To determine the role of Arg90, three mutants, R90K, R90A, and R90T, were constructed and expressed in E. coli. However, R90K could only be expressed as a soluble protein and purified using a BS affinity column. This result suggests that the positive charge of Arg90 is essential to enzyme function. The R90K mutant has a similar structure to the native enzyme except for the tetramer interface region. Each Lys90 employs two new water molecules, and the tetrameric center recruits a chloride ion that might compensate for the positive amino group of Lys90 (Fig. 3B). Putative Reaction Scheme—In the structure in the substrate-bound state, the substrates were unambiguously identified in the electron density map. An unexpected feature in the electron density map of BS was observed at the 4-amino (4-NH2) group of the cytidine core near the zinc ion (Fig. 4). Although the density corresponding to the amino group of the substrate or the hydroxyl group of the product was negligible, a double-headed electron density was detected around the catalyzed 4-amino group, where an amino group was exchanged for a hydroxyl group during catalytic reaction. Either of the heads could be assigned to a nitrogen or oxygen atom of unit occupancy, and the temperature factor of each atom was comparable to that of adjoining atoms in the refined model. Thus, in accordance with the suggested reaction scheme (Fig. 1A), the double-headed density could be interpreted as the amino and hydroxyl groups in the reaction intermediate of BS (BS*). However, a tear drop-shaped density was observed in the omit map in subunit A (Fig. 4C), and this density could not be satisfactorily assigned to the hydroxyl group predicted in the model. This suggests that the structure exists in a state between the enzyme-water-BS complex and the tetrahedral intermediate 1 in Fig. 1A, whereby the hydroxyl group might be in an ionic state rather than covalently bonded with the C4 atom of the pyrimidine ring. Zinc Coordination and Substrate Binding in Six States—The structure of the active center in the native state shows that the zinc ion coordinated in a tetrahedral geometry with Cys54, Cys88, and Cys91 (Fig. 5A and Table 2). This geometry is shared by other CDA structures. As proposed for the reaction mechanism of CDA (16Betts L. Xiang S. Short S.A. Wolfenden R. Carter Jr., C.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 635-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar), a water molecule usually accompanying the zinc ion probably replaced the fourth ligand shown as Wat1 in Fig. 5A. This complete native structure with no substrates or inhibitors contains three water molecules, including Wat1, around the catalytic center. The positions of the water molecules correspond to those of the 4-amino group; one of the water molecules, Wat5, occupies the leaving ammonia binding site. This geometry is also observed in the OH-BS complex (Fig. 5D) and cacodylic acid binding states.TABLE 2Crystallographic statistics for refinementNativeSubstrate complex (E56Q)Substrate complexProduct complexCacodylate complexR90K mutantSpace groupP212121P212121P43212P212121P212121P212121Cell dimensions (Å)a = 54.12, b = 68.76, c = 146.43a = 55.33, b = 69.58, c = 145.99a = 54.69, c = 197.63a = 54.30, b = 69.28, c = 146.54a = 54.67, b = 69.29, c = 144.71a = 54.80, b = 69.95, c = 145.84Resolution limit (Å)1.51.81.81.51.81.6Unique reflections88,09448,59928,55089,14750,04874,811Completeness (%)99.391.598.599.894.199.9<I/σI>33.233.632.233.933.66.3RmergeaRmerge = ΣhklΣi Ii(hkl) – <I(hkl)>/ΣhklΣi Ii(hkl)7.85.77.29.15.77.0Refinement Resolution range (Å)50.0–1.550.0–1.850.0–1.850.0–1.550.0–1.850.0–1.6 Rcryst/Rfree (%)bRcryst = Σhkl Fobs(hkl) – Fcalc(hkl)/ΣhklFobs(h kl), where Fobs and Fcalc are the observed and calculated structure amplitudes, respectively.

From the tetrahedral geometry, the zinc ion apparently shifts ∼0.6 Å toward the hydration water molecule hydrogen-bonded with Arg90 and enters the triangular plane of three cysteine Sγ atoms (Table 2), despite the corresponding structures of the polypeptide chains being nearly identical. At the same time, the water molecule (Wat2) exhibits a small but significant positional shift of ca. 0.4 Å. The positional shift of Wat2 is associated with the alternative conformation of Arg90, which faces the center of enzymatic tetrameric 222 symmetry. Thus, the zinc coordination shift may be influenced by the conformation of Arg90 and the signal of the shift may be transferred to other subunits through Wat3 as shown in Fig. 3A. The E56Q mutant and BS complex each show a similar conformation to the putative intermediate complex (Fig. 5B). However, this structure showed a weak electron density of the fourth water ligand, and the 4-amino group is far from zinc and interacts with Gln56Oϵ. We examined four possibilities of ambiguity of the Oϵ/Nϵ inversion and substrate/product. The two possibilities of Gln56 χ3 inversion could be distinguished by the temperature factors of Oϵ and Nϵ. From the result, we conclude that there is an interaction between the 4-amino group and GlnOϵ and that there are two possible structures: (i) the substrate BS is maintained in its 4-amino group; and (ii) the substrate is processed to an OH-BS product and the 4-amino group is substituted for a hydroxyl group. In the case (i), the 4-amino group and the heterocyclic N3 nitrogen of the cytidine core should interact with GlnOϵ and GlnNϵ, and Wat1 should not be stably coordinated to zinc in the E56Q mutant before binding to the substrate. The possibility of Wat1 existence might be small because of the result of the structure refinement even in the residual density observed in the FO - FC map. On the other hand, this structure could be considered to be trapped the exiting product in the case (ii). The 4-OH group and the N3 nitrogen would interact with GlnOϵ and GlnNϵ there, respectively. However, the interaction in latter is unfavorable. The FO - FC map also revealed the possibility of an alternative conformation of Gln56 even in low occupancy. Its χ2 angle is rotated, and the polar group is moved away from BS. Coordinate and structure factors have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank (PDB). The accession codes are PDB 1WN5, 1WN6, 2Z3G, 2Z3H, 2Z3I, and 2Z3J for the cacodylate-bound, substrate-bound, ligand free, product-bound enzymes, and E56Q and R90K mutants, respectively. Change in Coordination Geometry—The zinc coordination shift from tetragonal to trigonal bipyramidal is caused by the steric distortion of the pyrimidine ring and the carbohydrate-pyrimidine bond during substrate-product transition. The structure of the EcCDA and uridine complex suggests that the relative angle between the pyrimidine and ribose rings is distorted during the catalytic reaction (20Xiang S. Short S.A. Wolfenden R.

Current protocols require odontology expertise for proper recovery of the dental pulp. Dental pulp specimen exposed to laboratory environment yields contaminants detected using universal 16S rDNA-based detection of bacteria.We developed a new protocol by encasing decontaminated tooth into sterile resin, extracting DNA into the dental pulp chamber itself and decontaminating PCR reagents by filtration and double restriction enzyme digestion. Application to 16S rDNA-based detection of bacteria in 144 teeth collected in 86 healthy people yielded a unique sequence in only 14 teeth (9.7%) from 12 individuals (14%). Each individual yielded a unique 16S rDNA sequence in 1-2 teeth per individual. Negative controls remained negative. Bacterial identifications were all confirmed by amplification and sequencing of specific rpoB sequence.The new protocol prevented laboratory contamination of the dental pulp. It allowed the detection of bacteria responsible for dental pulp colonization from blood and periodontal tissue. Only 10% such samples contained 16S rDNA. It provides a new tool for the retrospective diagnostic of bacteremia by allowing the universal detection of bacterial DNA in animal and human, contemporary or ancient tooth. It could be further applied to identification of host DNA in forensic medicine and anthropology."

Hong Kong Chinese are mainly first or second generation migrants from China, who have shared an economically developed environment for years, but grew up in very different environments in Hong Kong or contemporaneously undeveloped Guangdong, China. We assessed if environment during growth had sex-specific associations with lipids and body shape, but not diabetes.We used multivariable regression in a population-based cross-sectional study, undertaken from 1994 to 1996, of 2537 Hong Kong Chinese residents aged 25 to 74 years with clinical measurements of ischaemic heart disease (IHD) risk, including HDL-cholesterol, ApoB, diabetes and obesity. Waist-hip ratio was higher (mean difference 0.01, 95% CI 0.001 to 0.02) in men, who had grown up in an economically developed rather than undeveloped environment, as was apolipoprotein B (0.05 g/L, 95% CI 0.001 to 0.10), adjusted for age, socio-economic status and lifestyle. In contrast, the same comparison was associated in women with lower waist-hip ratio (-0.01, 95% CI -0.001 to -0.02) and higher HDL-cholesterol (0.05 mmol/L, 95% CI 0.0004 to 0.10). The associations in men and women were significantly different (p-values<0.001). There were no such differences for diabetes.Growth in a developed environment with improved nutrition may promote higher sex-steroids at puberty producing an atherogenic lipid profile and male fat pattern in men but the opposite in women, with tracking of increased male IHD risk into adult life."
