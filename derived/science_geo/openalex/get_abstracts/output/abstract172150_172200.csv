https://openalex.org/W2170781328,"To identify subdivisions of the human parietal cortex, we collected fMRI data while ten subjects performed six tasks: grasping, pointing, saccades, attention, calculation, and phoneme detection. Examination of task intersections revealed a systematic anterior-to-posterior organization of activations associated with grasping only, grasping and pointing, all visuomotor tasks, attention and saccades, and saccades only. Calculation yielded two distinct activations: one unique to calculation in the bilateral anterior IPS mesial to the supramarginal gyrus and the other shared with phoneme detection in the left IPS mesial to the angular gyrus. These results suggest human homologs of the monkey areas AIP, MIP, V6A, and LIP and imply a large cortical expansion of the inferior parietal lobule correlated with the development of human language and calculation abilities."
https://openalex.org/W2022286642,"Spine Ca2+ is critical for the induction of synaptic plasticity, but the factors that control Ca2+ handling in dendritic spines under physiological conditions are largely unknown. We studied [Ca2+] signaling in dendritic spines of CA1 pyramidal neurons and find that spines are specialized structures with low endogenous Ca2+ buffer capacity that allows large and extremely rapid [Ca2+] changes. Under physiological conditions, Ca2+ diffusion across the spine neck is negligible, and the spine head functions as a separate compartment on long time scales, allowing localized Ca2+ buildup during trains of synaptic stimuli. Furthermore, the kinetics of Ca2+ sources governs the time course of [Ca2+] signals and may explain the selective activation of long-term synaptic potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD) by NMDA-R-mediated synaptic Ca2+."
https://openalex.org/W2003736664,"The ADF (actin-depolymerizing factor)/cofilin family is a stimulus-responsive mediator of actin dynamics. In contrast to the mechanisms of inactivation of ADF/cofilin by kinases such as LIM-kinase 1 (LIMK1), much less is known about its reactivation through dephosphorylation. Here we report Slingshot (SSH), a family of phosphatases that have the property of F actin binding. In Drosophila, loss of ssh function dramatically increased levels of both F actin and phospho-cofilin (P cofilin) and disorganized epidermal cell morphogenesis. In mammalian cells, human SSH homologs (hSSHs) suppressed LIMK1-induced actin reorganization. Furthermore, SSH and the hSSHs dephosphorylated P cofilin in cultured cells and in cell-free assays. Our results strongly suggest that the SSH family plays a pivotal role in actin dynamics by reactivating ADF/cofilin in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2319602304,"Many applications have been found for carbon nanotubes, and we can now add a role as a 'nanothermometer' to this list. We describe how the height of a continuous, unidimensional column of liquid gallium inside a carbon nanotube (up to about 10 micrometres long and about 75 nanometres in diameter) varies linearly and reproducibly in the temperature range 50-500 degrees C, with an expansion coefficient that is the same as for gallium in the macroscopic state. We chose gallium as our thermal indicator because it has one of the greatest liquid ranges of any metal (29.78-2,403 degrees C) and a low vapour pressure even at high temperatures. This nanothermometer should be suitable for use in a wide variety of microenvironments."
https://openalex.org/W2042779695,"Caspase-2 is one of the earliest identified caspases, but the mechanism of caspase-2-induced apoptosis remains unknown. We show here that caspase-2 engages the mitochondria-dependent apoptotic pathway by inducing the release of cytochrome <i>c</i> (Cyt <i>c</i>) and other mitochondrial apoptogenic factors into the cell cytoplasm. In support of these observations we found that Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL can block caspase-2- and CRADD (caspase and RIP adaptor with death domain)-induced cell death. Unlike caspase-8, which can process all known caspase zymogens directly, caspase-2 is completely inactive toward other caspase zymogens. However, like caspase-8, physiological levels of purified caspase-2 can cleave cytosolic Bid protein, which in turn can trigger the release of Cyt <i>c</i> from isolated mitochondria. Interestingly, caspase-2 can also induce directly the release of Cyt <i>c</i>, AIF (apoptosis-inducing factor), and Smac (second mitochondria-derived activator of caspases protein) from isolated mitochondria independent of Bid or other cytosolic factors. The caspase-2-released Cyt<i>c</i> is sufficient to activate the Apaf-caspase-9 apoptosome<i>in vitro</i>. In combination, our data suggest that caspase-2 is a direct effector of the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway."
https://openalex.org/W1987767376,"In budding yeast, the phosphatase Cdc14, a key regulator of exit from mitosis, is released from its inhibitor Cfi1/Net1 in the nucleolus during anaphase. A signaling cascade, known as the mitotic exit network (MEN), controls this release. We have identified a regulatory network, the FEAR (Cdc fourteen early anaphase release) network that promotes Cdc14 release from the nucleolus during early anaphase. The FEAR network is comprised of the polo kinase Cdc5, the separase Esp1, the kinetochore-associated protein Slk19, and Spo12. We also show that the FEAR network initiates Cdc14 release from Cfi1/Net1 during early anaphase, and MEN maintains Cdc14 in the released state during late anaphase. We propose that one function of Cdc14 released by the FEAR network is to stimulate MEN activity."
https://openalex.org/W2007215986,"Signaling through tyrosine kinase receptors (TKRs) is thought to be modulated by receptor-mediated endocytosis and degradation of the receptor in the lysosome. However, factors that regulate endosomal sorting of TKRs are largely unknown. Here, we demonstrate that Hrs (epatocyte growth factor-egulated tyrosine kinase ubstrate) is one such factor. Electron microscopy studies of hrs mutant larvae reveal an impairment in endosome membrane invagination and formation of multivesicular bodies (MVBs). hrs mutant animals fail to degrade active epidermal growth factor (EGF) and Torso TKRs, leading to enhanced signaling and altered embryonic patterning. These data suggest that Hrs and MVB formation function to downregulate TKR signaling."
https://openalex.org/W1976479871,"During neurotransmitter release, the neuronal SNARE proteins synaptobrevin/VAMP, syntaxin, and SNAP-25 form a four-helix bundle, the SNARE complex, that pulls the synaptic vesicle and plasma membranes together possibly causing membrane fusion. Complexin binds tightly to the SNARE complex and is essential for efficient Ca(2+)-evoked neurotransmitter release. A combined X-ray and TROSY-based NMR study now reveals the atomic structure of the complexin/SNARE complex. Complexin binds in an antiparallel alpha-helical conformation to the groove between the synaptobrevin and syntaxin helices. This interaction stabilizes the interface between these two helices, which bears the repulsive forces between the apposed membranes. These results suggest that complexin stabilizes the fully assembled SNARE complex as a key step that enables the exquisitely high speed of Ca(2+)-evoked neurotransmitter release."
https://openalex.org/W2052714004,"Inverted repeats (IRs) that can form a hairpin or cruciform structure are common in the human genome and may be sources of instability. An IR involving the human Alu sequence (Alu-IR) has been studied as a model of such structures in yeast. We found that an Alu-IR is a mitotic recombination hotspot requiring MRE11/RAD50/XRS2 and SAE2. Using a newly developed approach for mapping rare double-strand breaks (DSBs), we established that induction of recombination results from breaks that are terminated by hairpins. Failure of the mre11, rad50, xrs2, and sae2 mutants to process the hairpins blocks recombinational repair of the DSBs and leads to generation of chromosome inverted duplications. Our results suggest an additional role for the Mre11 complex in maintaining genome stability."
https://openalex.org/W2058101038,"The utility of morphine for the treatment of chronic pain is hindered by the development of tolerance to the analgesic effects of the drug. Morphine is unique among opiates in its ability to activate the mu opioid receptor (MOR) without promoting its desensitization and endocytosis. Here we demonstrate that [D-Ala(2)-MePhe(4)-Gly(5)-ol] enkephalin (DAMGO) can facilitate the ability of morphine to stimulate MOR endocytosis. As a consequence, rats treated chronically with both drugs show reduced analgesic tolerance compared to rats treated with morphine alone. These results demonstrate that endocytosis of the MOR can reduce the development of tolerance, and hence suggest an approach for the development of opiate analogs with enhanced efficacy for the treatment of chronic pain."
https://openalex.org/W2058712930,"Presynaptic short-term plasticity is an important adaptive mechanism regulating synaptic transmitter release at varying action potential frequencies. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms are unknown. We examined genetically defined and functionally unique axonal subpopulations of synapses in excitatory hippocampal neurons that utilize either Munc13-1 or Munc13-2 as synaptic vesicle priming factor. In contrast to Munc13-1-dependent synapses, Munc13-2-driven synapses show pronounced and transient augmentation of synaptic amplitudes following high-frequency stimulation. This augmentation is caused by a Ca2+-dependent increase in release probability and releasable vesicle pool size, and requires phospholipase C activity. Thus, differential expression of Munc13 isoforms at individual synapses represents a general mechanism that controls short-term plasticity and contributes to the heterogeneity of synaptic information coding."
https://openalex.org/W2112906768,"Transcription of the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) gene is regulated in a calcium- and neuron-selective manner; however, the mechanisms that underlie this selectivity are not known. We have characterized a new calcium-response element, CaRE1, that is required for activity-dependent transcription of BDNF exon III and have cloned a transcription factor, CaRF, that activates transcription from BDNF promoter III in a CaRE1-dependent manner. The transcriptional activity of CaRF is regulated in a calcium- and neuron-selective manner, suggesting that CaRF may confer selectivity upon the activity-dependent induction of BDNF exon III expression."
https://openalex.org/W2157622411,"A central hypothesis of neural development is that patterned activity drives the refinement of initially imprecise connections. We have examined this hypothesis directly by altering the frequency of spontaneous waves of activity that sweep across the mammalian retina prior to vision. Activity levels were increased in vivo using agents that elevate cAMP. When one eye is made more active, its layer within the LGN is larger despite the other eye having normal levels of activity. Remarkably, when the frequency of retinal waves is increased in both eyes, normally sized layers form. Because relative, rather than absolute, levels of activity between the eyes regulate the amount of LGN territory devoted to each eye, we conclude that activity acts instructively to guide binocular segregation during development."
https://openalex.org/W2036256965,"FtsK acts at the bacterial division septum to couple chromosome segregation with cell division. We demonstrate that a truncated FtsK derivative, FtsK50C, uses ATP hydrolysis to translocate along duplex DNA as a multimer in vitro, consistent with FtsK having an in vivo role in pumping DNA through the closing division septum. FtsK50C also promotes a complete Xer recombination reaction between dif sites by switching the state of activity of the XerCD recombinases so that XerD makes the first pair of strand exchanges to form Holliday junctions that are then resolved by XerC. The reaction between directly repeated dif sites in circular DNA leads to the formation of uncatenated circles and is equivalent to the formation of chromosome monomers from dimers."
https://openalex.org/W1968572823,"Despite years of investigation, the molecular mechanism responsible for regulation of the c-Abl tyrosine kinase has remained elusive. We now report inhibition of the catalytic activity of purified c-Abl in vitro, demonstrating that regulation is an intrinsic property of the molecule. We show that the interaction of the N-terminal 80 residues with the rest of the protein mediates autoregulation. This N-terminal ""cap"" is required to achieve and maintain inhibition, and its loss turns c-Abl into an oncogenic protein and contributes to deregulation of BCR-Abl."
https://openalex.org/W2092199562,"Cell entry by nonenveloped animal viruses requires membrane penetration without membrane fusion. The reovirus penetration agent is the outer-capsid protein, Mu1. The structure of Mu1, complexed with its ""protector"" protein, Sigma3, and the fit of this Mu1(3)Sigma3(3) heterohexameric complex into the cryoEM image of an intact virion, reveal molecular events essential for viral penetration. Autolytic cleavage divides Mu1 into myristoylated Mu1N and Mu1C. A long hydrophobic pocket can receive the myristoyl group. Dissociation of Mu1N, linked to a major conformational change of the entire Mu1 trimer, must precede myristoyl-group insertion into the cellular membrane. A myristoyl switch, coupling exposure of the fatty acid chain, autolytic cleavage of Mu1N, and long-range molecular rearrangement of Mu1C, thus appears to be part of the penetration mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W1990549640,"PKR, an interferon (IFN)-inducible protein kinase activated by double-stranded RNA, inhibits translation by phosphorylating the initiation factor eIF2alpha chain. We show that human IFN-gamma mRNA uses local activation of PKR in the cell to control its own translation yield. IFN-gamma mRNA activates PKR through a pseudoknot in its 5' untranslated region. Mutations that impair pseudoknot stability reduce the ability to activate PKR and strongly increase the translation efficiency of IFN-gamma mRNA. Nonphosphorylatable mutant eIF2alpha, knockout of PKR and PKR inhibitors 2-aminopurine, transdominant-negative PKR, or vaccinia E3L correspondingly enhances translation of IFN-gamma mRNA. The potential to form the pseudoknot is phylogenetically conserved. We propose that the RNA pseudoknot acts to adjust translation of IFN-gamma mRNA to the PKR level expressed in the cell."
https://openalex.org/W2002040395,"Recently, a poplar phloem peroxiredoxin (Prx) was found to accept both glutaredoxin (Grx) and thioredoxin (Trx) as proton donors. To investigate the catalytic mechanism of the Grx-dependent reduction of hydroperoxides catalyzed by Prx, a series of cysteinic mutants was constructed. Mutation of the most N-terminal conserved cysteine of Prx (Cys-51) demonstrates that it is the catalytic one. The second cysteine (Cys-76) is not essential for peroxiredoxin activity because the C76A mutant retained ∼25% of the wild type Prx activity. Only one cysteine of the Grx active site (Cys-27) is essential for peroxiredoxin catalysis, indicating that Grx can act in this reaction either via a dithiol or a monothiol pathway. The creation of covalent heterodimers between Prx and Grx mutants confirms that Prx Cys-51 and Grx Cys-27 are the two residues involved in the catalytic mechanism. The integration of a third cysteine in position 152 of the Prx, making it similar in sequence to the Trx-dependent human Prx V, resulted in a protein that had no detectable activity with Grx but kept activity with Trx. Based on these experimental results, a catalytic mechanism is proposed to explain the Grx- and Trx-dependent activities of poplar Prx.

Currently, these proteins are the subject of numerous studies because their function seems to be particularly important in the detoxification of reactive oxygen species that can cause serious damage to the nucleic acids, proteins, and lipids (2.Halliwell B.

This cysteine was demonstrated by site-directed mutagenesis to be essential for catalysis (9.Chae H.Z. Uhm T.B. Rhee S.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7022-7026Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Based mainly on the number of conserved cysteines, a classification has been proposed for the multiple existing Prxs. The 1-Cys Prxs mediate the reduction of H2O2 with the use of an unknown proton donor, which could be Trx for a mitochondrial 1-Cys Prx fromSaccharomyces cerevisiae (10.Kang S.W. Baines I.C. Rhee S.G.

Chem. 2000; 275: 16296-16301Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Recently, human cyclophilin A was identified as an electron donor to the mammalian Prx VI, the only mammalian 1-Cys Prx characterized, and also to all known mammalian Prxs (12.Lee S.P. Hwang Y.S.

Among the Prxs with two conserved cysteines, at least three classes can be distinguished, according to the position of the cysteines. The first class, comprising mammalian Prx V, includes monomeric enzymes that form an intramolecular disulfide bridge as a reaction intermediate (13.Knoops B. Clippe A. Bogard C. Arsalane K.

The second class is formed by the homologues of the bacterioferritin co-migratory protein, which are also shown to be monomeric enzymes with an intramolecular disulfide bridge in the oxidized state (15.Jeong W. Cha M.K. Kim I.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2924-2930Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 16.Kong W. Shiota S. Shi Y. Nakayama H. Nakayama K. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 107-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In this second class, the spacing between the two cysteines that are part of the disulfide bridge is considerably shorter, consistently containing 4 amino acids, instead of the ∼100 amino acids for the first class. The third class, which includes mammalian Prx I to IV, consists of dimeric enzymes that form an intermolecular disulfide bridge between two identical subunits (14.Seo M.S. Kang S.W. Kim K.

Pract. 1999; 45: 101-112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). Despite these differences, the three types of 2-Cys Prx use Trx as a proton donor. In a previous report, a poplar phloem Prx was characterized (18.Rouhier N. Gelhaye E. Sautière P.E. Brun A. Laurent P. Tagu D. Gerard J. de Fay E. Meyer Y. Jacquot J.P. Plant Physiol. 2001; 127: 1299-1309Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). This Prx is a small protein of 162 amino acids that contains only two cysteines in position 51 and 76. The primary sequence is quite different from that of the 1-Cys Prxs and most of the 2-Cys Prxs, especially because of the distance that separates the two cysteines. An unexpected finding was that this Prx could use Trx but also Grx as a proton donor for its catalysis (18.Rouhier N. Gelhaye E. Sautière P.E. Brun A. Laurent P. Tagu D. Gerard J. de Fay E. Meyer Y. Jacquot J.P. Plant Physiol. 2001; 127: 1299-1309Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). This Prx has been referred to as type C Prx, whereas the other 2-Cys Prxs, which use only Trx, were referred to as type A Prx, and 1-Cys Prxs were referred to as type B Prx. Among the biochemically well-characterized Prxs, one of the closest proteins is the mammalian Prx V. This enzyme also comprises 162 amino acids and displays 40% identity to poplar Prx at the amino acid level. A notable difference is the presence of an additional cysteine in position 152 that is linked together with Cys-51 to form an intramolecular disulfide bridge in Prx V (14.Seo M.S. Kang S.W. Kim K. Baines I.C. Lee T.H. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20346-20354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). A Prx from Chinese cabbage, highly homologous to poplar Prx, was also shown to be a Trx-dependent enzyme, but no attempt was made to evaluate the potential for Grx as a proton donor in this work (19.Choi Y.O. Cheong N.E. Lee K.O. Jung B.G. Hong C.H. Jeong J.H. Chi Y.H. Kim K. Cho M.J. Lee S.Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 258: 768-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). To get a better understanding of the catalytic mechanism of this Grx-dependent Prx, cysteinic mutants of Grx and Prx have been created by site-directed mutagenesis. Based on kinetic measurements and the creation of heterodimers, a new mechanism for the Grx-dependent Prx activity is proposed. NADPH was obtained from Roche Molecular Biochemicals; diamide, β-mercaptoethanol, glutathione reductase, and reduced glutathione were from Sigma. Dithiothreitol, isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, kanamycin, and ampicillin were from Fermentas.

The mutagenesis of poplar Grx was effected as we described (31.Rouhier N. Gelhaye E. Jacquot J.P. FEBS Lett. 2002; 511: 145-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The Prx mutants C51A, C76A, and V152C were generated by PCR using the oligonucleotides shown below (NcoI and BamHI sites areunderlined, mutagenic bases are in bold). Cloning oligonucleotides were as follows: direct, 5′-GGGGCCATGGCCCCGATTGCTGTTGGT-3′; and reverse, 5′-GGGGGGGATCCTCAAAGATCCTTGAGGATATCCTCGGCACT-3′.

The mutated PCR products that contained the restriction sites were in turn cloned into the expression plasmid pET-3d, yielding the constructions pET Prx C51A, pET Prx C76A, and pET Prx V152C. The sequences of the recombinant plasmids were verified by sequencing. All procedures for the expression and purification of Arabidopsis thaliana NADPH Trx reductase, poplar Trx h1, and WT and mutant Grx are described elsewhere (20.Rouhier N. Gelhaye E. Jacquot J.P.

Because preliminary experiments indicated that Prx is susceptible to oxidation, all purification steps for the wild type and the three mutant proteins were done in the presence of 14 mm β-mercaptoethanol. The thiol content of each protein preparation was measured using the DTNB procedure. To eliminate the β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mg of each protein was incubated with 10% trichloroacetic acid for 30 min on ice. The mixture was then centrifuged for 15 min at 13,000 rpm, and the pellet was washed three times with 1 ml of 2% trichloroacetic acid. The pellet was resuspended in 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, and 1 mm EDTA, and the protein concentration was determined by measuring the absorbance at 280 nm. SDS was then added to a final concentration of 1%, and the reaction was started by adding 100 μm DTNB. The reaction mixture was stored in the dark for 20 min, and the absorbance at 412 nm was measured. A second measurement was performed after a 30-min incubation in the dark. Both measurements gave identical results. Similar results were obtained when we used 80% acetone as a precipitant instead of trichloroacetic acid. The reduction of H2O2 by poplar Prx in the presence of the Trx or Grx system was followed spectrophotometrically using a Cary 50 spectrophotometer as described in Ref. 18.Rouhier N. Gelhaye E.

The activities were measured at a fixed concentration of Prx (2.5 μm) and at variable concentrations of Grx or Trx. 1.25 μg of Prx and Grx were mixed in the presence of TE buffer (30 mmTris-HCl, pH 8, and 1 mm EDTA) to a final volume of 10 μl. This reaction mixture was incubated at room temperature for 2–3 min before the addition of 10 mm diamide. The mixture was incubated at room temperature for 20 min and then subjected to 14% SDS-PAGE in the presence of an equivalent volume of a nonreducing sample buffer (0.5 m Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 4% SDS, 20% glycerol, and bromphenol blue) (25.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207487) Google Scholar). When needed, 10 mmdithiothreitol or 20–50 mm glutathione was added after incubation in the presence of diamide to reduce the covalent disulfide adducts between Prx and Grx. 2 μl of the mixture described above were subjected to 14% SDS-PAGE before transfer.

Rabbit polyclonal antibodies against Trx, Grx, and Prx were purified onto affinity columns according to the procedure described for Prx antibodies in Ref. 18.Rouhier N. Gelhaye E. Sautière P.E.

A previous study has indicated that poplar Prx differs from the other peroxiredoxins characterized thus far, essentially by the position of the conserved cysteine residues and by the overall length of the sequence (18.Rouhier N. Gelhaye E. Sautière P.E. Brun A. Laurent P. Tagu D. Gerard J. de Fay E. Meyer Y. Jacquot J.P. Plant Physiol. 2001; 127: 1299-1309Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). As detailed in the “Introduction,” this class of new Prxs was called type C Prx, whereas 2-Cys Prxs were named type A Prx, and 1-Cys Prxs were called type B Prx. A number of sequences similar to type C poplar Prx have now appeared in the literature, and an amino acid comparison of some of the closest relatives is given in Fig. 1. Poplar Prx is strongly homologous to the other plant Prxs of its class (76%, 81%, and 82% amino acid identity with Oryza sativa, Brassica rapa, and A. thaliana, respectively) and also to the well-characterized PMP20 protein from Candida boidinii and to the human Prx V (42% and 40% amino acid identity, respectively) (Fig. 1). Nevertheless, an important difference is the presence of an additional cysteine in human Prx in position 152; the poplar and all other nonmammalian sequences do not possess this additional cysteine. This particularity is examined here in terms of catalytic efficiency. In a previous work, we have shown that type C Prx could use both Grx and Trx as proton donors for catalysis. In this initial work, rather high concentrations of Trx or Grx were required in the in vitromeasurement of peroxidase activity (18.Rouhier N. Gelhaye E. Sautière P.E. Brun A. Laurent P. Tagu D. Gerard J. de Fay E. Meyer Y. Jacquot J.P. Plant Physiol. 2001; 127: 1299-1309Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Moreover, the specific activity of the enzyme remained low. We have improved this system in two respects: (i) the truncated form of poplar Grx, which was used in the earlier experiments, was replaced by a C-terminal-extended protein, which was both more stable and more active (20.Rouhier N. Gelhaye E. Jacquot J.P. Prot. Expression Purif. 2002; 24: 234-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar); and (ii) because we observed that Prx was susceptible to oxidation, its purification and subsequent storage were carried out in the presence of β-mercaptoethanol to avoid an irreversible oxidation of the catalytic cysteine. These changes resulted in a considerable enhancement of enzymatic activity, as shown in Table I. At a saturating Grx concentration (∼10 μm), the maximal specific activity of the enzyme is 8 μmol NADPH oxidized/min−1/mg protein−1. This value is similar to those reported for human peroxiredoxins and the E. coli bacterioferritin co-migratory protein (10.Kang S.W. Baines I.C. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6303-6311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar, 14.Seo M.S. Kang S.W. Kim K. Baines I.C. Lee T.H. Rhee S.G. J. Biol.

Chem. 2000; 275: 2924-2930Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). The specific activities recorded under the conditions of Table I suggest that Grx might be a better donor than Trx for poplar Prx. The maximal specific activity at a saturating Trx concentration estimated from the results in Fig. 3, 1.5 μmol NADPH oxidized/min−1/mg protein−1, also agrees with that proposal. However, these data should be treated with caution because the assays for Prx activity are indirect and involve the coupling of several components.Table IRelative activities of the various Prx preparations with Trx and GrxInitial GrxImproved GrxTrxPrx oxidizing conditions1.d.3.550.55Prx reducing conditions1.d.4.020.82Data are expressed in μmol of NADPH oxidized/min/mg protein.

Two monocysteinic mutants, called C27S and C30S, have been created to modify the active site of poplar Grx (31.Rouhier N. Gelhaye E. Jacquot J.P. FEBS Lett. 2002; 511: 145-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In addition, the mutants C51A, C76A, and V152C have been engineered to explore the reactivity of poplar Prx. All these cysteinic mutants were purified in the presence of β-mercaptoethanol to avoid undesired dimerizations. Fig. 2 shows that all Grx and Trx h1 preparations are highly homogeneous. As observed previously, all Prx preparations exhibited a protein doublet that cannot be eliminated by the addition of an excess of reductant (18.Rouhier N. Gelhaye E. Sautière P.E. Brun A. Laurent P. Tagu D. Gerard J. de Fay E. Meyer Y. Jacquot J.P. Plant Physiol. 2001; 127: 1299-1309Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). The reason for this behavior is unknown, but all biochemical and structural evidence gathered otherwise indicates that the protein is nevertheless highly homogeneous. Several reports in the literature indicate that the catalytic cysteine of peroxiredoxins can be transformed into sulfenic, sulfonic, or sulfinic acids, and this has been proposed as the reason for the formation of apparent protein doublets (10.Kang S.W. Baines I.C. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6303-6311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). The titration results with DTNB do not really support such a hypothesis for the poplar protein (see below). Besides, as observed previously, if such a modification occurs, it is not the result of the purification procedure because similar protein doublets were observed after direct lysis of freshly harvested bacteria (data not shown). The thiol content of all protein preparations has been estimated using the DTNB method. All titrations were made on enzymes that were freed from reductant and after the addition of SDS (see “Experimental Procedures”). Consequently, all thiols are titrated, regardless of whether or not they were accessible in the native protein. A summary of these data is shown in Table II. For Grx, the results are quite simple; nearly two thiols are titrated for the reduced WT protein, and no SH group is present in the oxidized WT protein, suggesting that the two Cys residues are indeed linked in a disulfide bridge. The monocysteinic mutants of Grx give values around 1 SH/mol protein, as expected. For Prx, the results are more complex to analyze and depend on whether the protein was isolated in the presence or absence of a reductant. When prepared under nonreducing conditions, the WT Prx shows nearly 2 SH/enzyme monomer, and it appears that the C51A and C76A mutants are partially oxidized because values lower than 1 SH/mol were recorded. The V152C mutant gives a value of 2.6 SH/mol, nearly in agreement with the expected 3 SH/mol. When the Prx preparations were made in the presence of a the monothiol reductant β-mercaptoethanol, very contrasting results were obtained. The C51A mutant showed nearly 1 SH/mol, but all other preparations had a thiol content that was reduced by about 1 SH group compared with the expected theoretical value. We interpret this as the result of a likely interaction between the thiol group of Cys-51 and β-mercaptoethanol that can give rise to a mixed disulfide that cannot be titrated with DTNB. As Prx preparation treated with the dithiol reductant dithiothreitol titrate as the enzyme prepared under oxidizing conditions, this formation of mixed disulfide is postulated to be specific for β-mercaptoethanol. Such a behavior has already been described for the bovine 1-Cys peroxiredoxin (26.Peshenko I.V. Shichi H. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2001; 31: 292-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Alternatively, because the thiol titrations are not always in perfect agreement with the theoretical values, this could also indicate that a portion of the peroxiredoxin molecules is in a denatured oxidized form with an internal disulfide bridge as described by Kang et al. for human 1-Cys Prx (10.Kang S.W. Baines I.C. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6303-6311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar) or that a portion of the catalytic cysteine is in an oxidized form.Table IIThiol content of Grx and Prx purified under oxidizing or reducing conditionsOxidizing conditionsReducing conditionsGrx WT0.051.67Grx C27Sn.d.0.88Grx C30Sn.d.0.93Prx WT1.70.9Prx C51A0.280.87Prx C76A0.330.19Prx V152C2.61.4Thiols were titrated using the reduction of DTNB as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Data are expressed in mol SH/mol enzyme. n.d., not determined.

The S.D. is typically ± 0.2 SH/mol SH. The catalytic capacity of all Prx mutants has been evaluated in the presence of the various engineered Grxs as proton donors. This has been tested in a coupled enzymatic reaction where the peroxiredoxin-catalyzed conversion of H2O2 is linked to NADPH oxidation via glutathione reductase, glutathione, and glutaredoxin. We have shown previously, using the 2-hydroethyldisulfide and dehydroascorbate reduction tests, that Cys-27 is the catalytic residue of Grx, and Cys-30 is generally dispensable in those reactions (31.Rouhier N. Gelhaye E. Jacquot J.P. FEBS Lett. 2002; 511: 145-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Fig. 3 shows the H2O2-dependent NADPH oxidizing activities of the various engineered peroxiredoxins as a function of Grx concentrations ranging from 0.5 to 20 μm. Only four combinations were found to promote catalysis. The best reactivity was obtained when WT Prx was associated with WT Grx. The mutation of Cys-30 of Grx (C30S) has little effect because the rate of catalysis with this mutant is nearly identical to the one obtained with WT Grx. The other associations that are catalytically competent are those between Prx C76A and Grx WT or C30S. However, the activities of the C76S mutant are reduced by approximately 75% compared with those recorded with WT Prx. Another observation is that the Prx C51A and V152C enzymes are completely inactive with Grx as a proton donor. A last piece of information is that the C27S mutant of Grx is unable to promote catalysis for all Prxs tested. Fig. 4 presents the catalytic activity of the Prx enzymes, in the presence of WT Trx as a proton donor. In this case, the Grx generating system was replaced by the Trx system, which is composed of the A. thaliana NADPH thioredoxin reductase and poplar Trx h1 (18.Rouhier N. Gelhaye E. Sautière P.E. Brun A. Laurent P. Tagu D. Gerard J. de Fay E. Meyer Y. Jacquot J.P. Plant Physiol. 2001; 127: 1299-1309Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). The reduction of poplar Trx by theArabidopsis NADPH thioredoxin reductase was previously shown to be functional using the DTNB reduction test (21.Behm M. Jacquot J.P. Plant Physiol. Biochem. 2000; 38: 363-369Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In general, similar results were obtained with the Trx system: the WT Prx was the most active catalyst, the mutation C51A abolished catalysis, and C76A had a depressing effect. The most striking difference is that the V152C protein, which was inactive with Grx as a proton donor, was catalytically active with Trx (Fig. 4, ♦). No saturation of Prx V152C enzyme activity could be recorded with Trx up to concentrations of 50 μm (data not shown). From the data in Figs. 3 and 4, Km values can be determined to characterize interactions between Prx and Grx or Trx. Similar values were obtained for Grx and Trx (2.5 and 3 μm, respectively). These values are in good agreement with other parameters published in the literature for Trx (14.Seo M.S. Kang S.W. Kim K. Baines I.C. Lee T.H. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20346-20354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). The mutation of the cysteine that is potentially involved in the breaking of the mixed disulfide intermediates stabilizes the heterodimers between Trx or Grx and their interacting partners (27.Verdoucq L. Vignols F. Jacquot J.P. Chartier Y. Meyer Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19714-19722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). We have taken advantage of that property to create heterodimers between the peroxiredoxin and glutaredoxin molecules. The covalent heterodimer formation was greatly improved using the oxidant diamide. The four different Prx preparations (WT, C51A, C76A, and V152C) were incubated with three different versions of the Grx (WT, C27S, and C30S). Fig. 5shows the results of these associations. In all assays, the Grx polypeptide is present with an apparent molecular mass of 15 kDa and the Prx is present with the usual doublet at ∼18 kDa. By running the proteins individually and based on the molecular mass determinations, we could assess the additional polypeptides as follows: the 30-kDa polypeptide is like"

To test the hypothesis that the anticipatory activity of such neurons depends on the context of stimulus-reward mapping, we examined their activity while the monkeys performed a memory-guided saccade task in which either the position or the color of a cue indicated presence or absence of reward. Some neurons showed anticipatory activity only when a particular position was associated with reward, while others fired selectively for color-reward associations. The functional segregation suggests that caudate neurons participate in feature-based anticipation of visual information that predicts reward. This neuronal code influences the general activity level in response to visual features without improving the quality of visual discrimination."

Palmitate is transferred to hexa-acylated lipid A in the outer membrane by the unusual acyltransferase PagP (11.Bishop R.E. Gibbons H.S. Guina T. Trent M.S. Miller S.I. Raetz C.R.H. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5071-5080Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). The latter uses glycerophospholipids as its acyl donor (11.Bishop R.E. Gibbons H.S. Guina T. Trent M.S. Miller S.I.

(5.Clementz T. Bednarski J.J. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12095-12102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar,16.Clementz T. Bednarski J. Raetz C.R.H. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 1311Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar) subsequently elucidated the function of HtrB as the lauroyltransferase (LpxL) of lipid A biosynthesis. Further analysis oflpxL(htrB) mutants revealed that tetra-acylated lipid A species accumulate in their inner membranes when cells are shifted to 42 °C (17.Zhou Z. White K.A. Polissi A.

As shown in the present study, the ability oflpxL mutants to grow at 30 °C on nutrient broth is explained by the limited induction of lpxP at 30 °C (but not at 42 °C) when lpxL is deleted, permitting the synthesis of some penta- and hexa-acylated lipid A species at 30 °C in lpxL mutant strains. Two additional genes, msbA and msbB, were identified by Karow and Georgopoulos (18.Karow M. Georgopoulos C. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 702-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 19.Karow M.

MsbA overproduction facilitates the export of the tetra-acylated lipid A molecules that accumulate in lpxLmutants (17.Zhou Z. White K.A. Polissi A. Georgopoulos C. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol.

MsbB (LpxM) is the myristoyltransferase that catalyzes the last step of lipid A biosynthesis in wild type E. coli(see Fig. 1 of accompanying article (8.Vorachek-Warren M.K. Carty S.M. Lin S.

Overexpression of LpxM is presumed to compensate for the absence of LpxL by permitting the transfer of myristate to the precursor Kdo2-lipid IVA in the absence of laurate (see Fig. 1 of accompanying article (8.Vorachek-Warren M.K.

However, lpxM mutants are characterized by greatly attenuated cytokine induction and reduced virulence in some animal models (23.Somerville Jr., J.E. Cassiano L. Bainbridge B.

We now report the construction of all possible combinations of strains with insertion mutations in the three ACP-dependent late acyltransferases of E. coli. Care was taken to avoid second site suppressors by performing strain constructions on minimal medium (14.Karow M. Fayet O. Cegielska A. Ziegelhoffer T. Georgopoulos C. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 741-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). As anticipated from the biochemistry (see Fig. 1 of accompanying article (8.Vorachek-Warren M.K. Carty S.M. Lin S.

A triple mutant (MKV15) lacking all three ACP-dependent late acyltransferases produces a lipid A species containing only the four primary (R)-3-hydroxymyristate residues but is viable on minimal medium at all temperatures. PagP is not induced as a compensatory mechanism under any of the conditions that we have examined. 32Pi (∼9000 Ci/mmol) and phosphatidylcholine (l-[α-1-14C]dipalmitoylglycerophosphocholine, ∼100 mCi/mmol) were purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences.

Overnight cultures of the recipient strains were resuspended in MC buffer (0.1 m MgSO4 and 5 mmCaCl2) and infected with dilutions of the lysate at 30 °C for 30 min. The transduction mixture was plated onto LB broth agar containing 30 μg/ml kanamycin and 5 mm sodium citrate or, in the case of recipient strains harboring thelpxL mutation, onto minimal A plates (28.Miller J.R.

Colonies appearing after 1–2 days of growth at 30 °C were then purified and tested for all relevant antibiotic resistance patterns, growth phenotypes, and temperature sensitivity. Stationary phase cultures of all seven late acyltransferase mutants and the wild type strain, W3110, were grown in Kozak medium (26.Kozak M. Jankowska E. Janowski R. Grzonka Z. Grubb A.

These were used to inoculate eight individual 6-ml cultures of Kozak medium without antibiotics to an optical density (A600) of 0.01. The A600 of the cultures was monitored into late log phase using a Milton-Roy Spectronic 21D spectrophotometer. The cultures were diluted as needed to give readings of less than 0.6 within the linear range of the spectrophotometer. To determine growth rate in LB broth, 6-ml cultures of cells were grown in Kozak medium to A600 = 0.1, centrifuged at 2000 × g at room temperature in a Beckman JS4.3 rotor, and resuspended in 6 ml of Luria broth. The A600was again monitored until the wild type cells entered stationary phase. Five-ml cultures of the various late acyltransferase mutants and wild type E. coli were grown at 30 °C in modified G56 medium (27.Galloway S.M. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6394-6402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to A600 = 0.4. Next,32Pi (5 μCi/ml of culture) was added, and the cells were grown for an additional 120 min toA600 = 1.0. A small scale lipid A isolation was performed directly on 1.6 ml of each cell culture as described previously (12.Zhou Z. Lin S. Cotter R.J. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol.

Briefly, the glycerophospholipids were extracted with a single-phase Bligh-Dyer mixture (29.Bligh E.G. Dyer J.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (43132) Google Scholar), generated by adding 4 ml of methanol and 2 ml of CHCl3 to a 1.6-ml culture. After centrifugation and removal of the supernatant, the cell residue was hydrolyzed in 1.8 ml of 12.5 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 4.5, and 1% SDS at 100 °C to cleave the Kdo-lipid A linkage (12.Zhou Z.

The various lipid A 1,4′-bisphosphate and lipid A 1-pyrophosphate species were then recovered by conversion of the suspension to a two-phase Bligh-Dyer system (12.Zhou Z. Lin S. Cotter R.J.

The lower phase (containing the total cellular lipid A and small amounts of decomposition products) was dried under a cold N2 stream and stored at −20 °C. These samples were redissolved in 100 μl of chloroform/methanol (4:1, v/v), and 10 μl of each was spotted onto a 20 × 20-cm silica gel TLC plate, which was developed with the solvent chloroform, pyridine, 88% formic acid, water (50:50:16:5, v/v). The plate was exposed to a PhosphorImager screen, and the radioactivity was quantified with a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager, equipped with ImageQuant version 1.2 software for the Macintosh. Typically, 100-ml cultures were grown using Kozak medium at 30 °C toA600 ∼1.0. Cells were collected by centrifugation at 5000 × g and resuspended in 40 ml of phosphate-buffered saline (32.Dulbecco R. Vogt M. J. Exp. Med. 1954; 99: 167-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (2005) Google Scholar). Glycerophospholipids were extracted with a single phase Bligh/Dyer mixture, as described above, and the lipid A was recovered from the cell residue by a second Bligh-Dyer extraction following hydrolysis at 100 °C in sodium acetate buffer, pH 4.5, and 1% SDS (12.Zhou Z.

The lipid A was then purified by chromatography on DEAE-cellulose columns as described previously (12.Zhou Z. Lin S. Cotter R.J. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol.

Spectra were acquired in the negative-ion linear mode using a Kratos analytical (Manchester, UK) matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization/time of flight (MALDI/TOF) mass spectrometer with a 337 nm nitrogen laser, a 20-kV extraction voltage, and time-delayed extraction. Each spectrum was the average of 50 shots. The lipid A samples were prepared for MALDI/TOF analysis by depositing 0.3 μl of the sample dissolved in chloroform/methanol (4:1, v/v), followed by 0.3 μl of the matrix, which was a mixture of saturated 6-aza-2-thiothymine in 50% acetonitrile and 10% tribasic ammonium citrate (9:1, v/v). The sample mixtures were allowed to dry at room temperature prior to mass analysis. Hexa-acylated lipid A 1,4′-bisphosphate from wild typeE. coli (Sigma) was used as an external standard for calibration. Wild type W3110 and the triple lpxL lpxP lpxM mutant, MKV15, were grown to A600 = 0.7 in 100 ml of modified G56 minimal medium (27.Galloway S.M. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol.

Cultures were split into two equal portions, and the cells were collected at 2000 × g for 15 min in a Beckman JS4.3 rotor at room temperature. One portion was resuspended in 100 ml of modified G56 minimal medium and the other in 100 ml of LB broth. The resuspended cells were incubated with shaking for 10 min at 30 °C. Next, 32Pi (5 μCi/ml) was added to each of the cultures, which were then incubated with shaking for another 10 min at 30 °C. The cells were collected by centrifugation at 8000 × g in a Beckman JA14 rotor at 4 °C and immediately frozen at −80 °C as pellets. Care was taken not to disturb the cell pellet while the medium was being decanted, as some of the mutants were easily lysed at this state. The frozen cells were then thawed in 10 ml of 10 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.8, and 25% sucrose, treated with 0.1 mg/ml lysozyme and 1.0 mm EDTA (33.Osborn M.J.

Doubly washed cell membranes were isolated by ultracentrifugation at 150,000 × g in a Beckman Ti-70 rotor and resuspended in 2 ml of 10 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.8, and 25% sucrose. Inner and outer membranes were then separated on a 12-ml gradient of 30–60% (w/w) sucrose in 10 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.8, at 4 °C by ultracentrifugation at 155,000 ×g using a Beckman SW-41 swinging bucket rotor (17.Zhou Z.

https://openalex.org/W1979356066,"Dendritic spines are morphologically and functionally heterogeneous. To understand this diversity, we use two-photon imaging of layer 5 neocortical pyramidal cells and measure action potential-evoked [Ca(2+)]i transients in spines. Spine calcium kinetics are controlled by (i) the diameter of the parent dendrite, (ii) the length of the spine neck, and (iii) the strength of spine calcium pumps. These factors produce different calcium dynamics in spines from basal, proximal apical, and distal apical dendrites, differences that are more pronounced without exogenous buffers. In proximal and distal apical dendrites, different calcium dynamics correlate with different susceptibility to synaptic depression, and modifying calcium kinetics in spines changes the expression of long-term depression. Thus, the spine location apparently determines its calcium dynamics and synaptic plasticity. Our results highlight the precision in design of neocortical neurons."

AGS3- and LGN-specific antisera indicated a widespread tissue distribution of LGN, whereas AGS3 is primarily enriched in brain. Brain punch biopsies of 13 discrete brain regions indicated that both AGS3 and LGN are expressed in all areas tested but are differentially regulated during development. LGN is expressed in neuronal, astroglial, and microglial cultures, whereas AGS3 expression is restricted to neurons. In primary neuronal cultures as well as in dividing cultures of PC12 cells, immunocytochemistry indicated distinct subcellular locations of AGS3 and LGN. The subcellular locations of the two proteins were differentially regulated by external stimuli and the cell cycle. In PC12 and COS7 cells, LGN moves from the nucleus to the midbody structure separating daughter cells during the later stages of mitosis, suggesting a role for G-proteins in cytokinesis. Thus, although AGS3 and LGN share a similar overall motif structure and both bind G-proteins, nature has endowed these proteins with different regulatory elements that allow functional diversity by virtue of tissue-specific expression and subcellular positioning.

The subcellular locations of the two proteins were differentially regulated by external stimuli and the cell cycle. In PC12 and COS7 cells, LGN moves from the nucleus to the midbody structure separating daughter cells during the later stages of mitosis, suggesting a role for G-proteins in cytokinesis. Thus, although AGS3 and LGN share a similar overall motif structure and both bind G-proteins, nature has endowed these proteins with different regulatory elements that allow functional diversity by virtue of tissue-specific expression and subcellular positioning. activator of G-protein signaling Partner of Inscuteable N-methyl-d-aspartate plasma-derived horse serum 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium phosphate-buffered saline G-protein regulatory tetratricopeptide repeats Heterotrimeric G-proteins transduce extracellular stimuli sensed by cell surface receptors into integrated cellular responses. An activated cell surface receptor initiates a change in the conformation of Gα subunits such that GDP is exchanged for GTP and Gα appears to dissociate from Gβγ. Both Gα and Gβγ then regulate the activity of various effectors with signal termination involving hydrolysis of bound GTP and apparent reassociation of GαGDP and Gβγ. Recent data indicate that additional proteins influence the G-protein activation cycle with unexpected modes of regulation (1–17). Such proteins have broad implications for signal processing.The family of RGS proteins acts to accelerate the rate of GTP hydrolysis by specific Gα subunits (12Ross E.M. Wilkie T.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 795-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (916) Google Scholar). RGS proteins apparently play important roles in terminating responses initiated by cell surface receptors and maintaining the dynamics of receptor-regulated events by promoting efficient cycling of activated G-proteins (13Mukhopadhyay S.

Interestingly, the latter group of proteins may either act in a similar manner as a receptor, promoting nucleotide exchange on Gα subunits (i.e. AGS1, the NG108–15 G-protein activator, phosphatidylethanolamine-binding protein), or by influencing subunit interactions independent of nucleotide exchange (i.e. AGS2, AGS3, LGN, and PINS). The interactions among these proteins and their roles in integrated cellular responses are of keen interest.In this study we focused on AGS3 and LGN, which possess a shared domain structure and exhibit 59% sequence identity. AGS3 was discovered in a functional screen for receptor-independent activators of G-proteins (1Cismowski M.J. Ma A. Takesono C. Lizano J.S. Xie X. Fuernkranz H. Lanier S.M. Duzic E. Nat.

The first third of the protein contains seven tetratricopeptide repeats (TPR) followed by a linker sequence that connects the TPR domain to a series of four G-protein regulatory (GPR) motifs (2Takesono A.

The functional role for the C. elegans protein is not known. Of particular note is that the role of PINS in asymmetric cell division apparently involves heterotrimeric G-proteins (24Schaefer M.

Biol. 2001; 11: R975-R978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). A broader role for heterotrimeric G-proteins in cell polarity and cell division is indicated by studies in both C. elegans and higher organisms (24Schaefer M. Petronczki M. Dorner D. Forte M.

Chem. 1998; 273: 21629-21633Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Thus, nature evolved two related proteins, AGS3 and LGN, but the roles of these two proteins in orthologous functions observed in lower organisms have yet to be determined.As an initial approach to understand the relationship between the mammalian proteins AGS3 and LGN, we defined the tissue distribution and subcellular distribution of each protein. LGN is expressed in all rat tissues and cell lines tested, whereas AGS3 is primarily enriched in the brain, testes, and heart (6Pizzinat N. Takesono A. Lanier S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16601-16610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In primary neuronal cultures as well as in dividing cultures of PC12 cells, immunocytochemistry indicated distinct subcellular locations of AGS3 and LGN. Of particular note, the subcellular distributions of AGS3 and LGN are differentially regulated by external stimuli and the cell cycle. During the late phases of mitosis in PC12 and COS7 cells, LGN moves from the nucleus to the midbody structure separating the daughter cells, suggesting a role for G-proteins in cytokinesis. Such migration of LGN within the cell during the cell cycle is reminiscent of the behavior of the AGS3/LGNDrosophila ortholog PINS during cell division and development. Thus, although AGS3 and LGN share a three-module structure and both bind G-proteins, nature has endowed these proteins with different regulatory elements that allow functional diversity by virtue of tissue-specific expression and subcellular positioning.DISCUSSIONThe diversity of recently discovered proteins that regulate or bind to components of the signal transduction system involving heterotrimeric G-proteins provide many opportunities for fine-tuning the signaling system and maintaining signaling specificity. Although we do not yet fully understand how these regulators function within the cell, their existence suggests novel concepts for G-protein signaling. First, such proteins can function as alternative binding partners for Gα or Gβγ. Second, such regulatory proteins allow signal input to G-protein signaling systems from a source other than a G-protein-coupled receptor. Both LGN and AGS3 are particularly interesting examples of such regulatory proteins. Although the TPR motifs of the two proteins likely play a role in subcellular location of the proteins (6Pizzinat N. Takesono A. Lanier S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16601-16610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), the GPR motif stabilizes the Giα-GDP complex and inhibits GDP dissociation. Thus, such proteins may replace Gβγ as a Gα-GDP-binding partner.As AGS3 and LGN both possess four GPR motifs, these proteins would provide a scaffold for tethering GDP-bound Gα subunits in a defined spatial orientation (6Pizzinat N. Takesono A. Lanier S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16601-16610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). It is not clear whether such complexes target Gα to specific subcellular domains/cellular compartments or await an activating signal. Such a signal might promote nucleotide exchange on Gα-GPR in much the same way as if the signal was received by a Gαβγ heterotrimer. Such a signal may come from within the cell or be initiated by extracellular stimuli. Alternatively, AGS3 or LGN that is not complexed with G-proteins may be activated by an as yet undefined mechanism and then transfer this signal to Gαβγ complexes in microdomains of the cell, displacing Gα from Gβγ and selectively activating signals involving Gβγ-sensitive effectors.Whereas only one such AGS3/LGN protein is found in C. elegans and Drosophila, higher organisms evolved two such proteins. The expressions of AGS3 and LGN are differentially regulated, and they have likely assumed distinct roles in cellular function based upon differences in their subcellular distribution. Whereas LGN is found in all cells and tissues examined, full-length,Mr ∼74,000 AGS3 is primarily expressed in brain and testes. Within the brain, both proteins are widely expressed. AGS3 is restricted to neurons, whereas LGN is found in both neuronal and glial cell types. Thus, nature may have evolved a primordialAGS3 gene to serve specialized functions in the neuron.A second striking difference between LGN and AGS3 is defined by their subcellular distribution. Both LGN and AGS3 are found throughout the cell body and neuronal processes in primary cultures of hippocampal neurons, but they are in different microdomains of the cell, and the two proteins respond differently to extracellular stimuli. More striking differences in the subcellular distribution and regulation of the two proteins are apparent in cell lines capable of undergoing cell division. In both PC12 and COS7 cells, LGN, but not AGS3, is found in the cell nucleus. Additional G-protein regulators, but typically not G-proteins themselves, are also present in the nucleus (31Dulin N.O.

Neither AGS3 nor LGN have any apparent hydrophobic domains or consensus sequences for acylation that would mediate a membrane association. Both AGS3 and LGN possess a loosely defined nuclear localization signal at379RPKR382, 438RRPR441,423PMRSRKY429 for AGS3 (6Pizzinat N. Takesono A. Lanier S.M. J. Biol.

Thus, there are no obvious “targeting” motifs that would explain the differences in subcellular location of the two proteins. Exon 1 of LGN encodes an amino-terminal 12-amino acid sequence that is not shared by AGS3, and this sequence is not found in all ESTs for LGN. However, it is not clear if this sequence influences cellular location of the protein. The differences in the subcellular location of the AGS3 and LGN likely reflect distinct binding partners that interact with the two proteins in the TPR or linker regions. 8Du et al. (45Du Q. Stukenberg P.T. Macara I.G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 12: 1069-1075Crossref Scopus (223) Google Scholar) recently reported the interaction of LGN with the nuclear mitotic apparatus protein and a role for LGN in mitotic spindle organization.In cells undergoing cytokinesis, LGN moves to a constricture between dividing cells where it colocalizes with F-actin. This defined structure is termed the midbody, and it serves as a focal point for the localization of proteins that eventually lead to the abscission of the dividing cells (30Glotzer M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2001; 17: 351-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). The migration of LGN during the process of mitosis and cell division is remarkably similar to the protein survivin (37Skoufias D.A. Mollinari C. Lacroix F.B. Margolis R.L. J.

Loss of function at this stage of the cell cycle leads to multinucleated cells that underwent mitosis but failed to complete cell division (43Wu J. Chen W. Tahir S.K. Kroeger P.E. Rosenberg S.H.

The cell cycle-dependent location of LGN in the midbody structure is of particular interest due to the role of AGS3 orthologs and/or G-proteins in cell polarity and division (23Bellaiche Y.

It is not clear at this point whether it is full-length LGN or a smaller version of the proteins that actually moves to the midbody. Our data suggest that at some point during the cell cycle, LGN receives a signal from inside the dividing cell, which initiates the movement of LGN out of the nucleus with eventual concentration at the midbody. As LGN moves toward its destination, it may interact with G-proteins and release Gβγ for functions required as part of the final stages of cell division. Heterotrimeric G-proteins transduce extracellular stimuli sensed by cell surface receptors into integrated cellular responses. An activated cell surface receptor initiates a change in the conformation of Gα subunits such that GDP is exchanged for GTP and Gα appears to dissociate from Gβγ. Both Gα and Gβγ then regulate the activity of various effectors with signal termination involving hydrolysis of bound GTP and apparent reassociation of GαGDP and Gβγ. Recent data indicate that additional proteins influence the G-protein activation cycle with unexpected modes of regulation (1–17). Such proteins have broad implications for signal processing. The family of RGS proteins acts to accelerate the rate of GTP hydrolysis by specific Gα subunits (12Ross E.M. Wilkie T.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 795-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (916) Google Scholar). RGS proteins apparently play important roles in terminating responses initiated by cell surface receptors and maintaining the dynamics of receptor-regulated events by promoting efficient cycling of activated G-proteins (13Mukhopadhyay S.

Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), angiotensin II, phorbol ester, and fetal bovine serum (FBS) were shown to induce the expression of NOX1 mRNA in VSMC (17.Suh Y.A. Arnold R.S. Lassegue B. Shi J.

Accordingly, NOX1/NADPH oxidase-derived O2−may be implicated in the pathogenesis of vascular lesions mediating the proliferation and hypertrophy of VSMC.Since PGF2α is known to elicit hypertrophy of VSMC we examined whether this effect of PGF2α is mediated by O2−generated by NOX1/NADPH oxidase.DISCUSSIONThe present findings indicate that PGF2α-induced hypertrophy of VSMC is mediated by O2−generated by NADPH oxidase through induction of NOX1 expression. The following four major lines of evidence are provided in this study. 1) PGF2α evoked generation of intracellular O2−in A7r5 vascular smooth muscle cells. 2) The PGF2α-induced increase in protein synthesis was attenuated by DPI, an inhibitor of NADPH oxidase. 3) A dose-dependent induction of NOX1, a catalytic subunit of NADPH oxidase, was produced by FP agonists PGF2α and (+)-fluprostenol. 4) The extent of the PGF2α-induced increase in protein synthesis was significantly suppressed when NOX1 mRNA was depleted by transfection of ribozymes specifically targeted at the NOX1 mRNA sequence.Augmented production of O2−caused by overexpression of NOX1 constituting NADPH oxidase appears to be important to the action of PGF2α leading to hypertrophy of VSMC. PGF2α is synthesized from arachidonic acid, which is converted to PGH2 through oxygenation and reduction by prostaglandin H synthase (cyclooxygenase). Subsequent conversion of PGH2 (or via PGE2) by PGF synthase generates PGF2α, one of the primary prostanoids produced by vascular cells in response to various stimuli. Increased expression of COX-2, an inducible isoform of cyclooxygenase, is reported in VSMC after balloon angioplasty or pinching injury of the carotid artery (25.Rimarachin J.A. Jacobson J.A. Szabo P. Maclouf J. Creminon C. Weksler B.B. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1994; 14: 1021-1031Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as well as in endothelial cells exposed to tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) (26.Mark K.S. Trickler W.J. Miller D.W. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2001; 297: 1051-1058PubMed Google Scholar). It has also been demonstrated that PGF2α is released from endothelial cells exposed to hypoxia (27.Arnould T. Thibaut-Vercruyssen R. Bouaziz N. Dieu M. Remacle J. Michiels C. Am. J. Pathol. 2001; 159: 345-357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Thus PGF2α is synthesized and released from vascular lesions under inflammatory conditions following various injuries including ischemia-reperfusion. Our findings indicate that the hypertrophic effects of PGF2α on VSMC are mediated by O2−generated by cellular NOX1/NADPH oxidase activity.Among the NOX superfamily, NOX1, NOX4, and NOX5 have been detected in VSMC (16.Bánfi B.

Zhang Y. Grant S.L. Lambeth J.D. Griendling K.K. Circ. Res. 2001; 88: 888-894Crossref PubMed Scopus (753) Google Scholar). In the present study, no alteration in the expression levels of NOX4 and p22phox was detected in A7r5 cells stimulated with PGF2α. As stimulation of FP leads to a cytosolic mobilization of Ca2+, NOX5, which produces O2−in a Ca2+-dependent manner, could be activated indirectly by PGF2α. NOX5 has not been identified in rodents however, and we could not detect the expression of NOX5 homolog in A7r5 cells by RT-PCR using synthetic primers designed from the reported human sequence (16.Bánfi B. Molnár G. Maturana A. Steger K. Hegedûs B. Demaurex N. Krause K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37594-37601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). In addition, stimulation with a calcium ionophore A23187 did not affect the level of O2−generated in the cells (data not shown). Accordingly, the contribution of other members of the NOX family to the PGF2α-induced production of O2−demonstrated in A7r5 cells seems to be minimal.The induction of NOX1 expression by PGF2α seems to be mediated specifically by FP, not by other prostanoid receptors. There are several possible explanations for this. First, (+)-fluprostenol, which increased NOX1 mRNA in a dose-dependent fashion, is a highly selective FP agonist. It was reported that this compound does not react with other prostanoid receptors (28.Kiriyama M. Ushikubi F. Kobayashi T. Hirata M. Sugimoto Y. Narumiya S. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1997; 122: 217-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). Second, expression of FP was demonstrated in A7r5 cells (2.Adams J.W. Migita D.S. Yu M.K. Young R. Hellickson M.S. Castro-Vargas F.E. Domingo J.D. Lee P.H. Bui J.S. Henderson S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1179-1186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), and we also verified the expression by RT-PCR (data not shown). Third, the concentration of PGF2α that elicited NOX1 expression was 10−10m, much lower than for other vasoactive prostanoids investigated such as PGE2, U-46619 (a thromboxane A2 receptor agonist), and carbaprostacyclin (a PGI2 receptor agonist). They induced NOX1 expression at concentrations greater than 10−7m suggesting that these prostanoids exerted their action by cross-reacting with FP. Thromboxane (TX) A2 is also known as a prostanoid causing proliferation and hypertrophy of VSMC (1.Dorn II, G.W. Becker M.W. Davis M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24897-24905Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29.Sachinidis A. Flesch M. Ko Y. Schror K. Bohm M. Dusing R. Vetter H. Hypertension. 1995; 26: 771-780Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Yet binding or functional responsiveness to TXA2 receptor (TP) agonist I-BOP was not observed in A7r5 cells (30.Morinelli T.A. Finley E.L. Jaffa A.A. Kurtz D.T. Ullian M.E. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1997; 53: 1823-1832Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). When examined by RT-PCR the level of TP mRNA in our A7r5 cells was also found to be very low (data not shown). Furthermore, TP antagonists SQ 29,548 and I-SAP did not affect the induction of NOX1 expression by TP agonists U-46619 and I-BOP. Thus, as far as A7r5 cells are concerned, induction of NOX1 by prostanoids seems to be mediated specifically by FP. We cannot exclude the possibility, however, that the mitogenic effects of TXA2 on VSMC are mediated by TP expressed in the cells, and its activation leads to NOX1 induction and O2−production.It has been reported that several protein kinases including tyrosine kinase, c-Jun-N-terminal kinase, and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) are involved in the PGF2α-induced hypertrophy of VSMC or cardiac myocytes (5.Adams J.W. Sah V.P. Henderson S.A. Brown J.H. Circ. Res. 1998; 83: 167-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 6.Kunapuli P. Lawson J.A. Rokach J.A. Meinkoth J.L. FitzGerald G.A. J. Biol.

Chem. 1999; 274: 12925-12932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). On the other hand, activation of p38 MAPK and Akt, not of ERK, by PDGF or angiotensin II is reported to be mediated by NOX1 (18.Lassègue B. Sorescu D. Szöcs K. Yin Q. Akers M. Zhang Y. Grant S.L. Lambeth J.D. Griendling K.K. Circ. Res. 2001; 88: 888-894Crossref PubMed Scopus (753) Google Scholar). Although the exact signal transduction pathway(s) leading to the induction of NOX1 expression on stimulation of FP remains to be elucidated, the cell clones expressing anti-NOX1 ribozyme established in this study will be useful to clarify the pathophysiological significance of NOX1-derived O2−in vascular cells.In summary, we demonstrated that PGF2α-induced hypertrophy of VSMC is mediated by NOX1 induction and resultant O2−production. The findings indicate the possibility of using FP antagonists as novel therapeutic agents for preventing vascular hypertrophy following inflammatory responses associated with diverse vascular injury.

Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), angiotensin II, phorbol ester, and fetal bovine serum (FBS) were shown to induce the expression of NOX1 mRNA in VSMC (17.Suh Y.A. Arnold R.S. Lassegue B. Shi J.

Accordingly, NOX1/NADPH oxidase-derived O2−may be implicated in the pathogenesis of vascular lesions mediating the proliferation and hypertrophy of VSMC. Since PGF2α is known to elicit hypertrophy of VSMC we examined whether this effect of PGF2α is mediated by O2−generated by NOX1/NADPH oxidase. DISCUSSIONThe present findings indicate that PGF2α-induced hypertrophy of VSMC is mediated by O2−generated by NADPH oxidase through induction of NOX1 expression. The following four major lines of evidence are provided in this study. 1) PGF2α evoked generation of intracellular O2−in A7r5 vascular smooth muscle cells. 2) The PGF2α-induced increase in protein synthesis was attenuated by DPI, an inhibitor of NADPH oxidase. 3) A dose-dependent induction of NOX1, a catalytic subunit of NADPH oxidase, was produced by FP agonists PGF2α and (+)-fluprostenol. 4) The extent of the PGF2α-induced increase in protein synthesis was significantly suppressed when NOX1 mRNA was depleted by transfection of ribozymes specifically targeted at the NOX1 mRNA sequence.Augmented production of O2−caused by overexpression of NOX1 constituting NADPH oxidase appears to be important to the action of PGF2α leading to hypertrophy of VSMC. PGF2α is synthesized from arachidonic acid, which is converted to PGH2 through oxygenation and reduction by prostaglandin H synthase (cyclooxygenase). Subsequent conversion of PGH2 (or via PGE2) by PGF synthase generates PGF2α, one of the primary prostanoids produced by vascular cells in response to various stimuli. Increased expression of COX-2, an inducible isoform of cyclooxygenase, is reported in VSMC after balloon angioplasty or pinching injury of the carotid artery (25.Rimarachin J.A. Jacobson J.A. Szabo P. Maclouf J. Creminon C. Weksler B.B. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1994; 14: 1021-1031Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as well as in endothelial cells exposed to tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) (26.Mark K.S. Trickler W.J. Miller D.W. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2001; 297: 1051-1058PubMed Google Scholar). It has also been demonstrated that PGF2α is released from endothelial cells exposed to hypoxia (27.Arnould T. Thibaut-Vercruyssen R. Bouaziz N. Dieu M. Remacle J. Michiels C. Am. J. Pathol. 2001; 159: 345-357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Thus PGF2α is synthesized and released from vascular lesions under inflammatory conditions following various injuries including ischemia-reperfusion. Our findings indicate that the hypertrophic effects of PGF2α on VSMC are mediated by O2−generated by cellular NOX1/NADPH oxidase activity.Among the NOX superfamily, NOX1, NOX4, and NOX5 have been detected in VSMC (16.Bánfi B.

Zhang Y. Grant S.L. Lambeth J.D. Griendling K.K. Circ. Res. 2001; 88: 888-894Crossref PubMed Scopus (753) Google Scholar). In the present study, no alteration in the expression levels of NOX4 and p22phox was detected in A7r5 cells stimulated with PGF2α. As stimulation of FP leads to a cytosolic mobilization of Ca2+, NOX5, which produces O2−in a Ca2+-dependent manner, could be activated indirectly by PGF2α. NOX5 has not been identified in rodents however, and we could not detect the expression of NOX5 homolog in A7r5 cells by RT-PCR using synthetic primers designed from the reported human sequence (16.Bánfi B. Molnár G. Maturana A. Steger K. Hegedûs B. Demaurex N. Krause K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37594-37601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). In addition, stimulation with a calcium ionophore A23187 did not affect the level of O2−generated in the cells (data not shown). Accordingly, the contribution of other members of the NOX family to the PGF2α-induced production of O2−demonstrated in A7r5 cells seems to be minimal.The induction of NOX1 expression by PGF2α seems to be mediated specifically by FP, not by other prostanoid receptors. There are several possible explanations for this. First, (+)-fluprostenol, which increased NOX1 mRNA in a dose-dependent fashion, is a highly selective FP agonist. It was reported that this compound does not react with other prostanoid receptors (28.Kiriyama M. Ushikubi F. Kobayashi T. Hirata M. Sugimoto Y. Narumiya S. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1997; 122: 217-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). Second, expression of FP was demonstrated in A7r5 cells (2.Adams J.W. Migita D.S. Yu M.K. Young R. Hellickson M.S.

Chem. 1996; 271: 1179-1186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), and we also verified the expression by RT-PCR (data not shown). Third, the concentration of PGF2α that elicited NOX1 expression was 10−10m, much lower than for other vasoactive prostanoids investigated such as PGE2, U-46619 (a thromboxane A2 receptor agonist), and carbaprostacyclin (a PGI2 receptor agonist). They induced NOX1 expression at concentrations greater than 10−7m suggesting that these prostanoids exerted their action by cross-reacting with FP. Thromboxane (TX) A2 is also known as a prostanoid causing proliferation and hypertrophy of VSMC (1.Dorn II, G.W. Becker M.W. Davis M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24897-24905Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29.Sachinidis A. Flesch M. Ko Y. Schror K. Bohm M. Dusing R. Vetter H. Hypertension. 1995; 26: 771-780Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Yet binding or functional responsiveness to TXA2 receptor (TP) agonist I-BOP was not observed in A7r5 cells (30.Morinelli T.A. Finley E.L. Jaffa A.A. Kurtz D.T. Ullian M.E. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1997; 53: 1823-1832Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). When examined by RT-PCR the level of TP mRNA in our A7r5 cells was also found to be very low (data not shown). Furthermore, TP antagonists SQ 29,548 and I-SAP did not affect the induction of NOX1 expression by TP agonists U-46619 and I-BOP. Thus, as far as A7r5 cells are concerned, induction of NOX1 by prostanoids seems to be mediated specifically by FP. We cannot exclude the possibility, however, that the mitogenic effects of TXA2 on VSMC are mediated by TP expressed in the cells, and its activation leads to NOX1 induction and O2−production.It has been reported that several protein kinases including tyrosine kinase, c-Jun-N-terminal kinase, and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) are involved in the PGF2α-induced hypertrophy of VSMC or cardiac myocytes (5.Adams J.W.

On the other hand, activation of p38 MAPK and Akt, not of ERK, by PDGF or angiotensin II is reported to be mediated by NOX1 (18.Lassègue B. Sorescu D. Szöcs K. Yin Q. Akers M. Zhang Y. Grant S.L. Lambeth J.D. Griendling K.K. Circ. Res. 2001; 88: 888-894Crossref PubMed Scopus (753) Google Scholar). Although the exact signal transduction pathway(s) leading to the induction of NOX1 expression on stimulation of FP remains to be elucidated, the cell clones expressing anti-NOX1 ribozyme established in this study will be useful to clarify the pathophysiological significance of NOX1-derived O2−in vascular cells.In summary, we demonstrated that PGF2α-induced hypertrophy of VSMC is mediated by NOX1 induction and resultant O2−production. The findings indicate the possibility of using FP antagonists as novel therapeutic agents for preventing vascular hypertrophy following inflammatory responses associated with diverse vascular injury.

Like glutathione, CoM is a soluble scavenger of reactive chemicals, and its simple chemical synthesis has fostered its therapeutic use in humans as a mucolytic and uroprotective agent during chemotherapy (6.Shaw I.C. Graham M.I. Cancer Treat. Rev. 1987; 14: 67-86Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Sulfonate-containing natural products are believed to be biosynthesized either by oxidizing thiol groups or by adding nucleophilic sulfite at unsaturated carbon bonds (7.Cook A.M. Laue H. Junker F. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1999; 22: 399-419Crossref Google Scholar). Taurine and cysteate are produced from cysteine by the oxidative mechanism (8.Huxtable R.J. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 2000; 483: 1-25Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The nonenzymatic sulfonation of α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compounds is also well known (9.Morton M. Landfield H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1952; 74: 3523-3526Crossref Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 10.Gilbert E.E. Sulfonation and Related Reactions. Robert E. Krieger Publishing Co., Huntington, NY1977Google Scholar). Yet, only recently have the biosyntheses of sulfoquinovose, sulfolactate, and CoM been demonstrated to occur by the sulfite addition mechanism. Plants and photosynthetic bacteria produce UDP-sulfoquinovose, a sulfolipid head group precursor, using SQD1/SqdB proteins to add sulfite to UDP-glucose (11.Benning C. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1998; 49: 53-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 12.Sanda S. Leustek T. Theisen M.J. Garavito R.M. Benning C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3941-3946Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). This reaction may proceed via a UDP-4-ketoglucose-5-ene intermediate (13.Pugh C.E. Roy A.B. Hawkes T. Harwood J.L. Biochem. J. 1995; 309: 513-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar).Bacillus subtilis produces sulfolactate during sporulation (14.Bonsen P.P. Spudich J.A. Nelson D.L. Kornberg A. J. Bacteriol. 1969; 91: 62-68Crossref Google Scholar), apparently using homologs of CoM biosynthesis proteins (15.Graham, D. E., and White, R. H. (2002) Nat. Prod. Rep. 19, in pressGoogle Scholar). The proposed pathway for the biosynthesis of coenzyme M from phosphoenolpyruvate (P-enolpyruvate) was deduced by analysis of labeling patterns of CoM purified from methanogens grown on stable isotope-labeled acetates (Fig. 1) (15.Graham, D. E., and White, R. H. (2002) Nat. Prod. Rep. 19, in pressGoogle Scholar,16.White R.H. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 6487-6493Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Incubation of P-enolpyruvate and bisulfite with cell extracts ofMethanobacterium formicium produced sulfolactate, sulfopyruvate, and sulfoacetaldehyde, establishing the role of these sulfonated intermediates in the pathway (17.White R.H. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 5304-5308Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Recently, three of the enzymes involved in this pathway (ComB, ComC, and ComDE) have been identified and characterized in a hyperthermophilic marine methanogen,Methanococcus jannaschii (18.Graham D.E. Graupner M. Xu H. White R.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 5176-5188Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 19.Graupner M. Xu H. White R.H. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 3688-3692Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 20.Graupner M. Xu H. White R.H. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 4862-4867Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In this work, we describe the first dedicated enzyme required for CoM biosynthesis in M. jannaschii, (2R)-phospho-3-sulfolactate synthase (ComA). This novel enzyme catalyzes the stereospecific Michael addition of sulfite to P-enolpyruvate, formingl-2-phospho-3-sulfolactate (PSL). Analyses of metal cofactor requirements, substrate specificity, the proton exchange reaction, a site-directed mutant, and reaction inhibitors suggest that the ComA-catalyzed reaction is analogous to those reactions catalyzed by β-elimination enzymes that proceed through an enolate intermediate (21.Anderson V.E. Sinnott M. Comprehensive Biological Catalysis. 2. Academic Press, New York1998: 115-133Google Scholar). All reagents and synthetic precursors were purchased from Sigma unless otherwise specified. (RS)-2-Phosphonooxy-3-sulfopropionic acid (racemic phosphosulfolactate), both enantiomers of 2-phosphonooxypropionic acid (phospholactate), and both enantiomers of 2-phosphonooxybutanedioic acid (phosphomalate) were synthesized as described previously (18.Graham D.E. Graupner M. Xu H. White R.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 5176-5188Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Hydroxycarbamoylmethylphosphonic acid (phosphonoacetohydroxyamic acid) (22.Anderson V.E. Weiss P.M. Cleland W.W. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 2779-2786Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) and 2-phosphonomethylacrylic acid (23.McFadden H.G. Harris R.L. Jenkins C.L.D. Australian J. Chem. 1989; 42: 301-314Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar) were also prepared as described previously. d-Cysteic acid was prepared by the oxidation of d-cystine with bromine (24.White R.H. J. Labelled Cmpds. Radiopharm. 1987; 24: 323-330Crossref Scopus (6) Google Scholar). The scheme used to synthesize sulfolactic acid enantiomers was modified from that described previously (25.Izumi Y. Yajima S. Okubo K. Babievskii K.K. Bull. Chem. Soc. Jpn. 1971; 44: 1416-1417Crossref Google Scholar), which in our hands was found to form 2-chloro-3-sulfopropionic acid. To a solution of d- orl-cysteic acid (5 mmol, 0.93 g) dissolved in 6.25 ml of 3.3 m trifluoroacetic acid, isoamylnitrile (15.6 mmol, 2.1 ml) was added dropwise with stirring at room temperature. After 24 h of stirring at room temperature, the organic phase was removed, and the aqueous layer was extracted two times with 6 ml of diethyl ether. The aqueous layer was then heated for 30 min at 100 °C, evaporated under vacuum, and dissolved in 3 ml of acetone. Dicyclohexylamine (3.5 mmol, 0.7 ml) was added dropwise at 0 °C with stirring. After overnight crystallization at 3 °C, 1.0 g of white crystals was isolated by filtration. The specific rotation of thed-cysteine-derived dicyclohexylamine (S)-sulfolactate salt (d-sulfolactate) was found to be [α]D25= +3.5°, and that for the l-cysteine-derived (R)-sulfolactate salt (l-sulfolactate) was found to be [α]D25= −3.1°. Analysis by gas chromatography of the (S)-sulfolactate for chiral purity as described below showed the presence of only the S-isomer, whereas the (R)-sulfolactate had an enantiomeric ratio of 83:17 R-isomer:S-isomer. Sulfolactate samples were converted into volatile methyl derivatives for gas chromatography (17.White R.H. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 5304-5308Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Samples (10–100 μg) were dissolved in 100 μl of water and passed through a Dowex AG 50-H+ (200–400 mesh) column (1 × 4 mm; Bio-Rad) to form the free acids. The effluent was evaporated to dryness with a stream of nitrogen gas and then dissolved in 50 μl of methanol. An ether solution of diazomethane was added until the yellow color of the diazomethane persisted for 1 min, and the sample was evaporated to dryness as described above and then dissolved in 20 μl of methylene chloride. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analyses were performed using a VG-70–70EHF GC-MS apparatus operating at 70 eV and equipped with an HP-5 column (0.32 mm × 30 m) programmed from 70 to 280 °C at 10 °C/min. Under these conditions, two different sulfolactate derivatives were detected. The first peak to elute was the dimethyl ester of O-methyl sulfolactate (M+ = 212 m/z, with a base peak at M+ − 59 = 153m/z). The second was the dimethyl ester of sulfolactate (M+ = 198 m/z, with a base peak at M+ − 59 = 139 m/zand a strong fragment at M+ − 59 − 32 = 107m/z). The mass spectrum of the compound comprising the first peak has been previously reported (17.White R.H. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 5304-5308Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar). GC-MS analysis of the resulting mixture of methyl ester derivatives on a chiral column was used to establish the stereochemical purity of the samples. Samples were separated on a β-DEX 120 column (0.25 mm × 30 m × 0.25-μm film thickness; Supelco Inc.) programmed from 75 to 230 °C at 3 °C/min. On this column, the trimethyl derivatives eluted as a single peak, but the dimethyl derivatives were separated into two peaks, with the first corresponding to the S-isomer and the second corresponding to theR-isomer. Analysis of a racemic mixture of the two isomers gave two peaks with a ratio of the first to the second of 0.74. Analytical data were corrected to account for this unexplained deviation from the expected ratio of 1.0. 3-Sulfo-2-sulfomethylpropionic acid was synthesized by the addition of sulfite to 2-bromomethylacrylic acid. 2-Bromomethylacrylic acid (1 mmol, 165 mg) was suspended in 1 ml of water and mixed with sodium sulfite (3 mmol, 378 mg; Mallinckrodt Chemical Works) dissolved in 1 ml of water, and the resulting clear colorless solution was heated at 110 °C for 12 h in a sealed vial. 1H NMR spectroscopy was performed using a 500-MHz Jeol Eclipse 500 NMR spectrometer at the Virginia Polytechnic Institute NMR Facility. 1H NMR analysis of a portion of the solution, after replacement of the water with 2H2O, showed a quantitative production of the 3-sulfo-2-sulfomethylpropionate with resonances δ 3.26 ppm (4H, m, H-3, and H-3′) and 3.12 ppm (1H, m, H-2). The product concentration was determined from the ratios of the sample peaks to the sodium [2,2,3,3-2H4]trimethylsilylpropionate (TSP) standard peak (δ = 0). The product was converted to the acid form by passage through a Dowex AG 50W-X8-H+ column (Bio-Rad) and evaporation of the solution to dryness. 2-Phosphonomethylacrylic acid (23.McFadden H.G. Harris R.L. Jenkins C.L.D. Australian J. Chem. 1989; 42: 301-314Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar) at a concentration of 0.18m was heated for 1 h at 110 °C with a 3m excess of sodium sulfite and, after cooling, passed though a Dowex AG 50-H+ column. 1H NMR analysis established that the 2-phosphonomethylacrylate was quantitatively converted into 2-phosphonomethyl-3-sulfopropionic acid: resonances were δ 3.56 (1H, dd, J3→2 = 2.1 Hz,J3→3′ = 14.1 Hz, H-3), 3.22 (1H, dd,J3′→2 = 11.6 Hz,J3′→3 = 14.1 Hz, H-3′), 2.88 (1H, m,J2→3 = 2.1 Hz, J2→α= 2.7 Hz, J2→α′ = 11.6 Hz,J2→3′ = 11.6 Hz, H-2), 1.71 (1H, ddd,Jα→2 = 2.7 Hz,Jα→α, = 14.8 Hz,Jα→P = 11.6 Hz, H-α), and 1.53 (1H, ddd,Jα′→2 = 11.6 Hz,Jα′→α = 14.8 Hz,Jα′→P = 14.3 Hz, H-α′). The M. jannaschii gene at locus MJ0255 (encoding the protein submitted to Swiss Protein Database under Swiss-Prot accession number Q57703 (34.Bult C.J. White O. Olsen G.J. Zhou L. Fleischmann R.D. Sutton G.G. Blake J.A. FitzGerald L.M. Clayton R.A. Gocayne J.D. Kerlavage A.R. Dougherty B.A. Tomb J.-F. Adams M.D. Reich C.I. Overbeek R. Kirkness E.F. Weinstock K.G. Merrick J.M. Glodek A. Scott J.L. Geoghagen N.S.M. Smith H.O. Woese C.R. Venter J.C. Science. 1996; 273: 1017-1140Crossref Scopus (2291) Google Scholar)) was amplified by PCR from genomic DNA using oligonucleotide primers synthesized by Invitrogen. Primer MJ0255-Fwd (5′-GGTGGTCATATGAAAGCATTTG-3′) introduced an NdeI restriction site at the 5′-end of the amplified DNA, whereas primer MJ0255-Rev (5′-GATCGGATCCTTAAACCTTTCC-3′) introduced a BamHI site at the 3′-end. PCRs contained 1× GeneAmp PCR buffer (Applied Biosystems), 1 μm each primer, 200 μm each dNTP, 1 μg of M. jannaschii JAL-1 chromosomal DNA, and 5 units of AmpliTaq LD DNA polymerase (Applied Biosystems) in a volume of 100 μl. DNA was amplified during 35 cycles, and each cycle included incubation at 95 °C for 1 min, 45 °C for 2 min, and 72 °C for 3 min. PCR product DNA was purified using a QIAquick spin column (QIAGEN Inc.) and then digested with NdeI andBamHI restriction enzymes (Invitrogen). DNA fragments were ligated into compatible sites in plasmid pET19b (Novagen) or pT7-7 (26.Tabor S. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 1074-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (2459) Google Scholar) using bacteriophage T4 DNA ligase (Invitrogen). Recombinant plasmids were transformed into Escherichia coli Nova- Blue (Novagen) and E. coli BL21-CodonPlus(DE3)-RIL (Stratagene). Sequences of cloned DNA were confirmed by dye terminator cycle sequencing (Virginia Bioinformatics Institute Core Laboratory Facility). Transformed E. coli cells were grown in Luria-Bertani/Miller broth (1 liter; Difco) supplemented with 100 mg/liter ampicillin. Cultures were shaken at 37 °C until they reached an absorbance at 600 nm of 1.0. Recombinant protein production was then induced with 28 mm lactose. After an additional 4-h incubation with shaking at 37 °C, the cells were harvested by centrifugation (6000 ×g, 10 min) and frozen at −20 °C. Recombinant ComA protein was purified by heat treatment and chromatography of soluble cell-free extract. E. coli cells (7.4 g, wet weight) expressing ComA from the pT7-7-derived plasmid were suspended in 20 ml of buffer A (20 mm bis-Tris-HCl (pH 6.5)) and lysed by sonication. Soluble cell-free extract was obtained after centrifugation at 20,000 ×g for 10 min at 4 °C. Native E. coli proteins were denatured by heating soluble extract at 70 °C for 20 min, and then insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 20,000 ×g for 15 min at 4 °C. Heat-soluble cell-free extract (17 ml) was sealed in Mr 6000–8000 cutoff membranes (Arthur H. Thomas) and dialyzed for 10 h at 4 °C against 1 liter of buffer A. Dialyzed solutions were concentrated in the membranes using polyethylene glycol 8000 and then applied to a MonoQ HR anion-exchange column (10 mm × 8 cm; Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated in buffer A. Pumps attached to the column were controlled by a BioLogic HR workstation (Bio-Rad). Protein bound to the column was washed with 0.33 m NaCl in buffer A and then eluted with 0.55 m NaCl in buffer A at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Fractions (1 ml) were collected automatically, and those containing PSL synthase activity were pooled and dialyzed for 10 h at 4 °C against 1 liter of buffer B (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6)). Dialyzed protein was concentrated using polyethylene glycol 8000 and then applied to a DEAE-Sepharose FF column (16 mm × 5.2 cm; Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated in buffer B. Protein was eluted with a 30-ml linear gradient of 0–1 m NaCl in buffer B at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Fractions (1.0 ml) were assayed for PSL synthase activity. Fractions containing activity (which elute at ∼0.35 m NaCl) were pooled and concentrated in an N2-pressurized stirred cell with a YM-10 ultrafiltration membrane (Millipore Corp.). Concentrated protein solutions were heated for 20 min at 70 °C, cooled on ice, and centrifuged for 10 min at 16,000 ×g at room temperature. The supernatant was applied to a Superose 12HR column (10 mm × 31 cm; Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mmNaCl, and 1 mm MgCl2. Chromatography was performed in this buffer at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min, and fractions of 0.75 ml were collected. Fractions containing PSL synthase activity were pooled and dialyzed against 1 liter of 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 1 mm MgCl2 for 10 h at 4 °C. Dialyzed protein was concentrated in the stirred cell ultrafiltration unit. Protein purity was evaluated by SDS-PAGE with silver staining (Bio-Rad). Total protein concentrations of samples were measured using the Bradford method (Bio-Rad) with bovine serum albumin as a standard. The final concentration of purified protein was verified using the BCA total protein assay (Pierce) with bovine serum albumin as a standard. Recombinant proteins expressed with an amino-terminal polyhistidine tag (ComAHis and ComAHis-K137N) were purified by nickel affinity column chromatography. E. coli cells (0.8 g, wet weight) expressing recombinant fusion proteins from pET19b-derived plasmids were suspended in buffer C (50 mm Hepes/NaOH (pH 7.6) and 0.5 m NaCl) and then processed as described for ComA. Heat-soluble cell extracts were loaded onto a HiTrap chelating column (1.5 × 2.5 cm; Amersham Biosciences) charged with NiCl2 and equilibrated in buffer C with 10 mmimidazole. Protein bound to the column was washed and eluted using a stepwise isocratic elution (5 ml of 0.05, 0.1, 0.4, 0.6, and 1m imidazole in buffer C (pH 7.5)) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Fractions (1 ml) were collected and then analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Fractions containing recombinant protein, eluted at 1 mimidazole, were pooled and desalted using a Sephadex G-25 column (1.6 × 14.5 cm; Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated in 50 mm Hepes/NaOH (pH 7.1). Purified, desalted protein preparations produced a single band on SDS-polyacrylamide gels stained with Coomassie Blue R-250 dye. Protein quaternary structure was analyzed using a Superose 12HR column (10 mm × 30 cm). The column was equilibrated and operated at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min in buffer containing 50 mm Hepes/NaOH (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, and 1 mm MgCl2. Protein standards used to calibrate the sizing column were horse spleen apoferritin, potato β-amylase, yeast alcohol dehydrogenase, hen egg white conalbumin, bovine erythrocyte carbonic anhydrase, and horse heart cytochrome c. Eluted protein was detected by its absorbance at 280 nm and PSL synthase activity (for wild-type enzyme). Molecular masses and elution volumes of standards were successfully fit to an exponential equation using nonlinear least-squares regression (SigmaPlot 2000, SPSS Inc.). One unit of PSL synthase activity incorporates 1 μmol/min sulfite into phosphosulfolactate. Standard activity assays included 50 mm Hepes/NaOH (pH 7.5), 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm NaHSO3 (Eastman Kodak Co.) or 1 mm Na2SO3, and 1 mmP-enolpyruvate in 50 μl. Sulfite stock solutions were prepared daily. Assay mixtures were preincubated at 70 °C for 10 min before the addition of enzyme. After 7 min of incubation at 70 °C, activity was terminated by the addition of 5 μl of 10× stop solution (0.5m arginine and 0.1 m EDTA adjusted to pH 12.8 with NaOH). Enzyme was diluted in buffer containing 100 mmTris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 10 mm MgCl2. Enolase activity was measured using a continuous assay of P-enolpyruvate absorbance at 230 nm (27.Westhead E.W. Methods Enzymol. 1966; 9: 670-679Crossref Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Yeast enolase (Sigma) was used as a control (at 25 °C). Reactions (1 ml) containing 50 mm KCl, 50 mm Hepes/NaOH (pH 7.5), 1 mm MgCl2, and 0.5 mm P-enolpyruvate or 1 mmd-2-phosphoglycerate were initiated by the addition of enzyme. ComA enolase activity was measured at 60 °C. Monobromobimane (Calbiochem) was used to measure sulfite concentrations (28.Togawa T. Ogawa M. Nawata M. Ogasawara Y. Kawanabe K. Tanabe S. Chem. Pharm. Bull. (Tokyo). 1992; 40: 3000-3004Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Terminated enzymatic activity assays (55 μl) were reacted with 3 μl of 50 mmmonobromobimane dissolved in acetonitrile. Reactions were incubated away from light for 15 min at room temperature and then diluted to 1 ml with 50 mm glycine and 10 mm EDTA adjusted to pH 10 with NaOH. Fluorescence of the sulfite-monobromobimane adduct was measured in methacrylate cuvettes using a PerkinElmer Life Sciences 650-40 fluorescence spectrophotometer with excitation at 410 nm and emission at 480 nm. Sulfite concentrations were calculated using linear regression results from a standard curve consisting of 0–1 mm NaHSO3 or Na2SO3 (50 μl) in enzyme reaction buffer. Standards were processed as described for the activity assays. Phosphosulfolactate synthase activity was optimized by varying reaction conditions, including temperature, pH, and inorganic cation concentrations. All reactions were carried out under enzymatic activity-limited conditions. Effects of reaction temperature were studied in standard assays initiated by the addition of sulfite to reaction mixtures pre-equilibrated in water baths. Reactions were incubated at temperatures from 23 to 90 °C for 5–10 min and then terminated with alkaline stop solution and cooled on ice. The influence of pH on ComA activity was studied using approximately constant ionic strength buffers (29.Ellis K.J. Morrison J.F. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 87: 405-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar). Buffer mixtures containing 0.5 macetic acid (Fisher), 0.5 m Mes, and 1 m Tris were adjusted to pH 4.0–8.5 at room temperature using NaOH or HCl. Buffers containing 1 m Aces, 0.5 m Tris, and 0.5 m ethanolamine HCl (Calbiochem) were similarly adjusted to pH 6.0–10.0. Single component buffers containing 0.5 mglycine/NaOH (pH 10.0), 0.5 m Caps/NaOH (pH 10–11), 0.5ml-arginine/NaOH (pH 11.5–12), or 0.5m guanidine/NaOH (pH 12) were used to test activity at alkaline pH values. Buffers were diluted 10-fold in standard assays, and reactions were initiated by adding sulfite. Effects of KCl (Fisher), NaCl (Fisher), LiCl (J. T. Baker Inc.), or NH4Cl (Fisher) were also tested in standard assays. Divalent cation requirements were tested using Hepes and P-enolpyruvate reagents purified by passage through a 7.5 mm × 7.5-cm column of Chelex 100-Na+ (Bio-Rad) (30.Poyner R.R. Cleland W.W. Reed G.H. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 8009-8017Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). ComA was purified on a 0.5 × 6.5-cm column containing Chelex 100-Na+ and quantified by its absorbance at 280 nm. Metal replacement reactions included 5 mm concentrations of MgCl2·6H2O (Fisher), MnCl2·4H2O (Fisher), CaCl2·6H2O (Fisher), NiCl2·6H2O, Zn(C2H3O2)2·2H2O, BaCl2·2H2O (Fisher), CuCl2(Fisher), CoCl2·6H2O (J. T. Baker Inc.), Fe(NH4)2(SO4)2·6H2O, or EDTA. For each substrate (P-enolpyruvate, sulfite, and Mg2+), initial rates of ComA-catalyzed phosphosulfolactate synthase activity were measured varying a single substrate concentration, with the other two substrates present in excess. All reactions were preincubated at 70 °C. Assays (120 μl) varying the P-enolpyruvate concentration contained 10–20 mm MgCl2, 50 mm Hepes/NaOH (pH 7.2), and 8 μg/ml ComA and were initiated with 1.5 mmNaHSO3. Assays (120 μl) varying the sulfite concentration contained 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mmP-enolpyruvate, and 50 mm Hepps/NaOH (pH 8.0) and were initiated with 8 μg/ml ComA. The initial rate at each P-enolpyruvate or sulfite concentration was calculated from measurements of residual sulfite in a 20-μl reaction volume at 0.25, 2.5, and 5.0 min. Fixed time point assays at varying MgCl2 concentrations contained 16 μg/ml Chelex-purified ComA, 50 mm Hepes/NaOH (pH 7.6), and 2.6 mm P-enolpyruvate. Reactions were initiated with 1 mm sulfite and stopped after 5 min. Initial rate data from low substrate concentrations were successfully fitted to the hyperbolic Michaelis-Menten-Henri equation, and kinetic parameters were calculated using the Levenberg-Marquardt method of nonlinear least-squares regression (SigmaPlot 2000). Initial rate data obtained over the full range of concentrations tested were fitted to a simple hyperbolic equation for substrate inhibition: v =V·A/((KM + A +A2)/Ki) (31.Cleland W.W. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 63: 500-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). (RS)-Phosphosulfolactate (4.2 μmol) was mixed with 1 μmol of MgCl2 and 10 μmol of Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), lyophilized using a SpeedVac apparatus (Savant Instruments, Inc.), and then suspended in 0.5 ml of 2H2O (99.8 atom % 2H) with TSP. Enzyme (25 μg) was mixed with 5 nmol of MgCl2, dried by lyophilization, and then suspended in 40 μl of 2H2O. The enzyme solution was added to the (RS)-phosphosulfolactate and incubated at 70 °C for 60 min. Reactions were cooled to room temperature and then analyzed by 1H NMR at 23 °C. Phosphosulfolactate was hydrolyzed by bacterial alkaline phosphatase (0.2 units), and then the resulting sulfolactate was purified using Dowex AG 1-X2-Cl− resin (Bio-Rad) (17.White R.H. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 5304-5308Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Sulfolactate was derivatized and analyzed by chiral GC-MS as described above. Potential inhibitors of ComA activity were tested in reactions (50 μl) containing 1.2 mm P-enolpyruvate, 1 mmNa2SO3, 50 mm Hepes/NaOH (pH 7.5), 5 mm MgCl2, and 15 μg/ml ComA. Fixed time point reactions were initiated, incubated, and terminated after 6 min as described for standard assays. To account for interferences with the monobromobimane detection of sulfite, residual sulfite concentrations in samples were subtracted from those of inhibitor control reactions incubated without ComA. Net specific activities were compared with those of ComA reactions without inhibitor to calculate relative activities. To test the function of a conserved lysine residue in ComA, Lys137 was replaced with asparagine. The QuikChangeTM site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) was used according to the manufacturer's instructions with template pMjcomA-His (comA in pET19b).

M., Sreekumar, K. R., and Raetz, C. R. H. (1999)J. Biol. Chem. 274, 9677–9685). To determine whether the palmitoleoyl residue alters the properties of the outer membrane and imparts physiological benefits at low growth temperatures, we constructed a chromosomal insertion mutation in lpxP, the structural gene for the transferase. Membranes from thelpxP mutant MKV11 grown at 12 °C lacked the cold-induced palmitoleoyltransferase present in membranes of cold-shocked wild type cells but retained normal levels of the constitutive lauroyltransferase encoded by lpxL. When examined by mass spectrometry, about two-thirds of the lipid A molecules isolated from wild type E. coli grown at 12 °C contained palmitoleate in place of laurate, whereas the lipid A of cold-adapted MKV11 contained only laurate in amounts comparable with those seen in wild type cells grown at 30 °C or above. To probe the integrity of the outer membrane, MKV11 and an isogenic wild type strain were grown at 30 or 12 °C and then tested for their susceptibility to antibiotics. MKV11 exhibited a 10-fold increase in sensitivity to rifampicin and vancomycin at 12 °C compared with wild type cells but showed identical resistance when grown at 30 °C. We suggest that the palmitoleoyltransferase may confer a selective advantage upon E. coli cells growing at lower temperatures by making the outer membrane a more effective barrier to harmful chemicals.

A unique glycolipid known as lipopolysaccharide is the major component of the outer surface of the outer membranes of Gram-negative bacteria and forms a barrier around the cell (1.Raetz C.R.H.

These so-called “secondary” acyl chains are the same in wild type E. coli and Salmonella.Two inner membrane enzymes, LpxL(HtrB) and LpxM(MsbB), which act late in the lipid A pathway (Fig. 1), are responsible for the incorporation of laurate and myristate, respectively (7.Brozek K.A.

Chem. 1998; 273: 12466-12475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar).Recently, a cold shock-induced enzyme that catalyzes the transfer of a palmitoleoyl chain from palmitoleoyl-acyl carrier protein to the lipid A precursor Kdo2-lipid IVA was discovered in our laboratory (15.Carty S.M. Sreekumar K.R. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9677-9685Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The greater similarity of the palmitoleoyltransferase (LpxP) to the lauroyltransferase (LpxL) than to the myristoyltransferase (LpxM), and the ability of LpxP to use the same Kdo2-lipid IVA substrate as LpxL (Fig. 1), led us to suggest that LpxP acylates the 2′ (R)-3-hydroxymyristoyl chain (15.Carty S.M. Sreekumar K.R. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9677-9685Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). LpxP activity is induced within 15 min following a shift of exponentially growing cells from 37 to 12 °C and peaks after 2 h (15.Carty S.M. Sreekumar K.R. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9677-9685Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Appearance of palmitoleoyltransferase activity is correlated with massive accumulation of lpxP mRNA at 12 °C (15.Carty S.M. Sreekumar K.R. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9677-9685Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar).Modification of bacterial cell membranes in response to cold shock is not unprecedented (16.Garwin J.L. Klages A.L. Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 3263-3265Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17.Aguilar P.S. Cronan J.E.J. de Mendoza D. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 2194-2200Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Following exposure to low temperatures, some Gram-positive bacteria, like Bacillus subtilis, produce a fatty acid desaturase encoded by des, resulting in production of glycerophospholipids with unsaturated acyl chains in addition to the branched chains normally present in Gram-positive bacteria (17.Aguilar P.S. Cronan J.E.J. de Mendoza D. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 2194-2200Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18.Aguilar P.S. Hernandez-Arriaga A.M. Cybulski L.E. Erazo A.C. de Mendoza D. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1681-1691Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). The fatty acids of E. coliglycerophospholipids contain some unsaturated acyl chains at all growth temperatures (19.Morein S. Andersson A. Rilfors L. Lindblom G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6801-6809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar), but their composition shifts toward greater unsaturation during cold shock because of increased β-ketoacyl-ACP synthase II (FabF) activity (16.Garwin J.L. Klages A.L. Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 3263-3265Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Additional acyltransferases that selectively incorporate unsaturated fatty acyl chains into glycerophospholipid are not induced by cold shock in E. coli(16.Garwin J.L. Klages A.L. Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 3263-3265Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The constitutive glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferases ofE. coli utilize whatever acyl donors are most abundant in the acyl-ACP and acyl-coenzyme A pools (20.Scheidler M.A. Bell R.M. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 209: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar, 21.Cronan J.E.J. Gelmann E.P. Bacteriol. Rev. 1975; 39: 232-256Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22.Cronan Jr., J.E. Rock C.O. Neidhardt F.C. Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium. 1. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1987: 474-497Google Scholar). LpxP is the first example of a specific acyltransferase that is induced by cold shock (15.Carty S.M. Sreekumar K.R. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9677-9685Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar).The incorporation of an unsaturated fatty acyl chain into lipid A might alter the physical properties of the outer membrane to benefit the cell in cold environments. We have therefore constructed the strain MKV11 with an insertion mutation in the palmitoleoyltransferase structural gene, lpxP. MKV11 lacks detectable cold shock-induced LpxP activity in vitro but retains the constitutive lauroyltransferase (Fig. 1). Palmitoleate-containing species are absent in lipid A isolated from the mutant subjected to cold shock, whereas two-thirds of the lipid A from cold-shocked wild type E. coli contain palmitoleate. Although our lpxP mutant strain exhibits no obvious growth defects at 12 °C, the integrity of its outer membrane is compromised. Minimal inhibitory concentrations for rifampicin and vancomycin are 10 times lower in MKV11 than wild type cells at 12 °C but are the same at 30 °C. Genes encoding cold-induced lipid A acyltransferases are present in many bacteria that survive for long periods outside of animal hosts, including E. coli, all serovars of Salmonella enterica, andKlebsiella pneumoniae, but are absent in pathogens transmitted from animal to animal.DISCUSSIONWe have constructed a mutant of E. coli(MKV11) containing a kanamycin resistance cassette insertion in the structural gene of the palmitoleoyltransferase, lpxP, involved in the biosynthesis of cold-adapted lipid A (15.Carty S.M. Sreekumar K.R. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9677-9685Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). In contrast to its parental strain, MC1061, membranes isolated from this mutant do not convert the lipid substrate for LpxP, Kdo2-lipid IVA, to Kdo2-(palmitoleoyl)-lipid IVA (Figs. 1 and 3) and cannot incorporate any palmitoleate into its lipid A in vivo during cold shock.The absence of the lpxP gene product does not confer any obvious growth phenotype in nutrient broth at low temperatures (Fig. 2). Furthermore, the inner and outer membranes of wild type and mutant cells do not appear to differ appreciably in their protein or lipopolysaccharide core composition, as judged by gel electrophoresis (data not shown). The ratio of glycerophospholipids to lipid A (normally about 10:1) is also not affected (data not shown). The absence of a strong phenotype associated with lpxPinactivation is a little surprising, considering that two-thirds of the lipid A species isolated from wild type E. coli cultured under cold shock conditions contain a palmitoleoyl residue (Fig. 5). It is possible that the up-regulation of unsaturated fatty acid biosynthesis and the increased incorporation of these fatty acids into the glycerophospholipids (19.Morein S. Andersson A. Rilfors L. Lindblom G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6801-6809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar) during growth at low temperatures provide sufficient fluidity to maintain cell viability.Interestingly, however, the integrity of the mutant outer membrane is altered during cold shock, as determined by antibiotic resistance studies. A 10-fold greater sensitivity to rifampicin and vancomycin verifies that incorporation of an unsaturated fatty acid during cold shock, although not required for cell survival, is essential for the maintenance of an effective outer membrane barrier. Although we favor the view that the outer membrane is leaky when the palmitoleoyl moiety is not incorporated into lipid A, we cannot entirely exclude the possibility that export of these antibiotics is compromised.The activity of the lauroyltransferase (LpxL) (8.Clementz T. Bednarski J.J. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12095-12102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) is not affected in mutant cells grown at both 12 and 30 °C, confirming that the lauroyltransferase and palmitoleoyltransferase are distinct enzymes (Fig. 1). LpxL activity does not decrease in wild type cells upon cold shock indicating that there must be competition between LpxL and LpxP activity during growth at low temperatures. The composition of the acyl-ACP pool clearly must influence the ability of these enzymes to catalyze their respective acylation reactions at 12 °C. The increase in activity of β-ketoacyl-ACP synthase II at cold temperatures (a direct effect on the enzyme) (16.Garwin J.L. Klages A.L. Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 3263-3265Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) may result indirectly in the diminished availability of lauroyl-ACP relative to palmitoleoyl-ACP.In vitro, the specific activity of LpxP is at least an order of magnitude lower than that of LpxL (15.Carty S.M. Sreekumar K.R. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9677-9685Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), but to date, the optimal conditions for assaying these enzymes have not been studied in depth.Palmitoleate is preferentially incorporated into glycerophospholipids by 1-acyl-glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase (encoded byplsC) (39.Coleman J. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1992; 232: 295-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), and palmitoleoyl-ACP makes up a large fraction of the acyl-ACP pool isolated from a mutant defective in glycerol 3-phosphate formation (40.Rock C.O. Jackowski S. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 10759-10765Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, the incorporation of palmitoleate into lipid A is not limited by substrate availability at normal growth temperatures (30 °C and above). The LpxP reaction must be limited by the absence of enzyme protein and/or enzyme activity at higher temperatures. It has been determined previously that the level of lpxP mRNA at 30 °C is barely measurable but increases by several orders of magnitude following cold shock (15.Carty S.M. Sreekumar K.R. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9677-9685Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). However, the induction of a T7lac promoter-driven construct of lpxP with IPTG at 37 °C yields more LpxP protein than is seen at 12 °C (Fig. 7), but it is less active (Table II). These findings indicate that LpxP activity may be regulated at several levels.Figure 7SDS-PAGE of cell membranes overexpressingE. coli LpxP. Electrophoresis was carried out under standard conditions (46.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206024) Google Scholar).

The latter is an RNA-binding protein, and its expression is regulated at the level of transcription by an AT-rich upstream element (41.Jones P.G. Inouye M. Mol.

Fang L. Inouye M. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 27: 247-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). In addition CspA self-regulates at the level of translation and mRNA stability via the “cold box,” a sequence upstream of the ribosome-binding site, as well as a “downstream box” within the structural gene (41.Jones P.G. Inouye M. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 11: 811-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar, 42.Thieringer H.A. Jones P.G. Inouye M.

The 5′-untranslated regions of CspA and other cold shock proteins are unusually long, often around 150 bases, within which important sequences for regulation appear to be located (41.Jones P.G.

It has been determined recently that the 5′-untranslated region of thelpxP gene is 152 bases long, 2M. K. Vorachek-Warren and C. R. H.

Further studies oflpxP transcription and translation are in progress.All E. coli cold shock proteins discovered to date, with the exception of LpxP, are involved with the maintenance of intracellular processes required for macromolecular synthesis, including replication, transcription, translation, and protein folding (41.Jones P.G. Inouye M. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 11: 811-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar, 42.Thieringer H.A. Jones P.G. Inouye M.

The palmitoleoyltransferase is the first protein in E. colispecifically induced by cold shock whose activity has effects on the outer membrane that are beneficial to the cell. The increased incorporation of unsaturated fatty acids into a membrane structure is termed “homeoviscous” adaptation (44.Sinensky M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1974; 71: 522-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (1133) Google Scholar, 45.Vigh L. Maresca B. Harwood J.L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 369-374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar), and results in a membrane containing more fatty acyl chains with lower melting temperatures in order to maintain the appropriate fluidity. Further characterization of the palmitoleoyltransferase, its regulation, and the phenotype of mutant MKV11 should result in a better understanding of this adaptation process and its importance to Gram-negative bacteria. A unique glycolipid known as lipopolysaccharide is the major component of the outer surface of the outer membranes of Gram-negative bacteria and forms a barrier around the cell (1.Raetz C.R.H.

We show that KIN-29 acts cell-autonomously and non-cell-autonomously in sensory neurons to regulate chemoreceptor expression, body size, and the dauer decision, suggesting that kin-29 function is essential for the correct acquisition and transduction of sensory information."
https://openalex.org/W2076135271,"Abstract Like many voltage-sensitive ion pumps, cytochromec oxidase is inhibited by zinc. Binding of zinc to the outside surface of Rhodobacter sphaeroides cytochromec oxidase inhibits the enzyme with a K Iof ≤ 5 μm when the enzyme is reconstituted into phospholipid vesicles in the presence of a membrane potential. In the absence of a membrane potential and a pH gradient, millimolar concentrations of zinc are required to inhibit. This differential inhibition causes a dramatic increase in the respiratory control ratio from 6 to 40 for wild-type oxidase. The external zinc inhibition is removed by EDTA and is not competitive with cytochrome cbinding but is competitive with protons. Only Cd2+ of the many metals tested (Mg2+, Mn2+, Ca2+, Ba2+, Li2+, Cs2+, Hg2+, Ni2+, Co2+, Cu2+Tb3+, Tm3+) showed inhibitory effects similar to Zn2+. Proton pumping is slower and less efficient with zinc. The results suggest that zinc inhibits proton movement through a proton exit path, which can allow proton back-leak at high membrane potentials. The physiological and mechanistic significance of proton movement in the exit pathway and its blockage by zinc is discussed in terms of regulation of the efficiency of energy transduction."

We have extended this approach by analyzing differences in gene expression resulting from the drug treatment of transformed and nontransformed cells.

Greater attention was given to genes encoding cell surface antigens that were selectively up-regulated by the combination of Wnt-1 and retinoic acid. These genes included the tumor necrosis factor family 4-1BB ligand, ephrin B1,stra6, autotaxin, and ISLR. Administration of retinoic acid to mice bearing tumors driven by activation of the Wnt-1/β-catenin pathway resulted in increased expression of stra6 in the tumors but not in normal tissue.

The aberrant growth and survival of cancer cells is attributed to underlying genetic defects that alter normal cellular homeostasis. In the case of colorectal cancer, inactivation of the adenomatous polyposis coli tumor suppressor occurs early in tumor progression and provides a growth advantage resulting from the inappropriate activation of genes such as cyclin D, matrilysin, and c-myc (1.He T.C.

Morin P.J. Clevers H. Adv. Cancer Res. 2000; 77: 1-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 5.Polakis P. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1837-1851Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The up-regulation of this signaling pathway in cancer can also result from missense mutations in the β-catenin gene that render the β-catenin protein refractory to down-regulation by adenomatous polyposis coli (6.Rubinfeld B. Robbins P. El-Gamil M. Albert I. Porfiri E. Polakis P. Science. 1997; 275: 1790-1792Crossref PubMed Scopus (1137) Google Scholar, 7.Korinek V. Barker N. Morin P.J. van Wichen D. de Weger R. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Clevers H. Science. 1997; 275: 1784-1787Crossref PubMed Scopus (2950) Google Scholar). Mutations in β-catenin have been identified in a wide variety of human tumors and are particularly prevalent in human hepatocellular cancer (5.Polakis P. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1837-1851Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Activation of β-catenin signaling also occurs when the cell surface frizzled receptors are stimulated by the secreted Wnt ligands (8.Wodarz A. Nusse R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 59-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (1743) Google Scholar). Although it is not known whether the Wnt ligands themselves contribute to human cancers, early experiments have demonstrated that their overexpression in mouse mammary tissue was tumorigenic (9.Nusse R. Varmus H.E. Cell. 1982; 31: 99-109Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1278) Google Scholar). Thus, Wnt signaling represents a mechanism that contributes to the progression of a high percentage of human cancers for which appropriate animal and cell culture models are available. T cell factor/lymphoid enhancer factor all-trans-retinoic acid retinoic acid receptor reverse transcriptase retinal short chain dehydrogenase reductase 1 retinoic acid-responsive element immunoglobulin superfamily containing leucine-rich repeat glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase Signals emanating from the Wnt receptors are thought to proceed via the activation of disheveled, which in turn, negatively regulates glycogen synthase kinase 3β (10.Peifer M. Polakis P. Science. 2000; 287: 1606-1609Crossref PubMed Scopus (1146) Google Scholar). This kinase normally phosphorylates the regulatory sequence of β-catenin that targets the protein for ubiquitin-dependent degradation (11.Miller J.R. Moon R.T. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2527-2539Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar). Negative regulation of glycogen synthase kinase 3β thus increases the stability of β-catenin and prolongs its activation of the TCF/LEF transcription factors (12.Molenaar M. van de Wetering M. Oosterwegel M. Paterson-Maduro J. Godsave S. Korinek V. Roose J. Destree O. Clevers H. Cell. 1996; 86: 391-399Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1625) Google Scholar, 13.Behrens J. von Kries J.P. Kuhl M. Bruhn L. Wedlich D. Grosschedl R. Birchmeier W. Nature. 1996; 382: 638-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (2605) Google Scholar). Although the activation of the TCF/LEF transcription factors by β-catenin is well established, there remain additional mechanisms independent of these transcription factors by which β-catenin might engage gene activation. One of these alternative mechanisms has been proposed by Byers and colleagues (14.Easwaran V. Pishvaian M. Salimuddin Byers S. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 1415-1418Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in a study investigating the potential for cross-talk between signaling by retinoic acid receptors (RARs) and β-catenin. In accord with this proposal, we have recently demonstrated that the retinoic acid-responsive gene stra6 was activated upon Wnt-1 expression (15.Szeto W. Jiang W. Tice D.A. Rubinfeld B. Hollingshead P.G. Fong S.E. Dugger D.L. Pham T. Yansura D.G. Wong T.A. Grimaldi J.C. Corpuz R.T. Singh J.S. Frantz G.D. Devaux B. Crowley C.W. Schwall R.H. Eberhard D.A. Rastelli L. Polakis P. Pennica D. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 4197-4205PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, stra6 was synergistically induced by a combination of retinoic acid and Wnt-1. The synergistic activation of stra6 does not require the ectopic expression of intracellular signaling components and is therefore mediated entirely by endogenous signaling molecules responsive to their corresponding receptors. This suggests that genuine cross-talk might occur between the RAR and Wnt signaling pathways under normal physiological or pathological states. That the induction of stra6 expression by retinoic acid was more robust on an oncogenic background prompted us to consider potential therapeutic applications where this effect could be exploited. As the stra6 gene codes for a cell surface protein, an appropriate application would be immunotherapy in cancer. The proven utility of therapeutic antibodies in treatment of human cancer in the clinic has stimulated intense activity aimed at the development and refinement of immunotherapeutics. Ideally these therapies require the presence of cell surface antigens expressed on the cancer cells at significantly higher levels than that present on normal tissues throughout the body. Such criteria for differential expression on tumors relative to normal tissue will obviously limit the number of antigens considered desirable as targets for immunotherapy. Therefore, reagents that selectively enhance the level of antigen expression on cancer cells relative to normal cells could conceivably improve the therapeutic index for immunotherapeutics directed against these antigens. To this end we performed a screen to identify antigens that are preferentially up-regulated by the treatment of Wnt-1-transformed cells with retinoic acid. C57MG, C57MG/Wnt-1, and C57MG cells with tetracycline-repressible Wnt-1 expression were grown as described previously (15.Szeto W. Jiang W. Tice D.A. Rubinfeld B. Hollingshead P.G. Fong S.E. Dugger D.L. Pham T. Yansura D.G. Wong T.A. Grimaldi J.C. Corpuz R.T. Singh J.S. Frantz G.D. Devaux B. Crowley C.W. Schwall R.H. Eberhard D.A. Rastelli L. Polakis P. Pennica D. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 4197-4205PubMed Google Scholar). For the array analysis the C57MG cells with tetracycline-repressible Wnt-1 expression were grown in 10-cm dishes until ∼60% confluent. Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, cultured in tetracycline-free medium for 48 h either in the presence of 1 μmall-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA, Spectrum Laboratory Products) or an equal volume of Me2SO and then harvested. Control cells were maintained entirely in medium containing tetracycline either in the presence of 1 μm ATRA or Me2SO. All dishes were simultaneously harvested, and total RNA was extracted. The growth and treatment of cells and the purification of RNA from cells was performed three independent times. Human colon adenocarcinoma cell line WiDr was obtained form the American Type Culture Collection. Cells were maintained in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were lysed in 3.5 ml of lysis buffer (4 m guanidine thiocyanate, 25 mm sodium citrate, 0.5% N-laurylsarcosine, 0.7% 2-mercaptoethanol) and layered on 1.5 ml of a 5.7 m cesium chloride, 50 mm EDTA (pH 8.0) solution. Following centrifugation at 150,000 × g overnight, the RNA pellet was dried, resuspended in water, phenol-chloroform-extracted, and ethanol-precipitated. The RNA was resuspended in water to a final concentration of 1 mg/ml and stored at −70 °C. Approximately 10 μg of each RNA sample served as starting material for the preparation of biotinylated cRNA required for oligonucleotide array analysis on the Affymetrix system. cRNA targets were prepared according to previously described protocols (16.Wodicka L. Dong H. Mittmann M. Ho M.H. Lockhart D.J. Nat. Biotechnol. 1997; 15: 1359-1367Crossref PubMed Scopus (857) Google Scholar). Following hybridization, the arrays were washed and stained with streptavidin-phycoerythrin and then scanned with the Gene Array scanner (Agilent Technologies). Default parameters provided in the Affymetrix data analysis software package were applied in determining the signal intensities, referred to as average differences, and the -fold differences for the approximately 12,000 probe sets represented on the Affymetrix Mu74 A chip. Each array image was scaled to an average difference of 1500. The average differences obtained with probes derived from cells expressing Wnt-1 in the absence or presence of ATRA, or treated with ATRA in the absence of Wnt-1 expression, were base-lined against average differences obtained from untreated control cells to generate the -fold difference value for each gene call. Confirmation of gene expression was performed using quantitative RT-PCR as described previously (15.Szeto W. Jiang W. Tice D.A. Rubinfeld B. Hollingshead P.G. Fong S.E. Dugger D.L. Pham T. Yansura D.G. Wong T.A. Grimaldi J.C. Corpuz R.T. Singh J.S. Frantz G.D. Devaux B. Crowley C.W. Schwall R.H. Eberhard D.A. Rastelli L. Polakis P. Pennica D. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 4197-4205PubMed Google Scholar). -Fold induction was obtained by using the ΔΔCt method in which all samples are first normalized to the level of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) in each sample. Relative normalized units were then compared between the experimental sample and its control. Mouse and human GAPDH and stra6 primer and probe sequences have been described previously (15.Szeto W.

Mammary tumor tissue from a Wnt-1 transgenic mouse was excised and minced into 2- × 2-mm sections in Hanks' balanced salt solution. Individual sections were surgically transplanted into the no. 2,3 mammary fat pad of wild-type syngeneic hosts (C57bl6). Animals with tumors of 100–200 mm3 were randomly assigned to one of three treatment groups. Two groups received peritumoral injections of either 100 (n = 3) or 400 (n = 2) mg/kg ATRA resuspended in olive oil, while a control group (n = 4) received vehicle alone. Eight hours after injection, animals were sacrificed, and tumors and adjacent normal mammary tissue were harvested for RT-PCR analysis. For human colon tumor xenografts, 5 × 106 WiDr cells in Hanks' balanced salt solution were injected subcutaneously in the right dorsal flank of female athymic nude mice in a final volume of 0.2 ml. After tumors of 200–500 mm3 were established, animals were randomly assigned to one of four treatment groups. ATRA was administered per os to three groups (eight mice per group) at either 45, 135, or 400 mg/kg, while a control group (n = 4) received vehicle alone. Twelve hours after RA administration, animals were sacrificed, and tumors and normal murine colon tissues were harvested for RT-PCR analysis. Northern blotting was performed as described previously using the Northern Max kit from Ambion (15.Szeto W. Jiang W. Tice D.A. Rubinfeld B. Hollingshead P.G. Fong S.E. Dugger D.L. Pham T.

Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 4197-4205PubMed Google Scholar). RNA was hybridized with 32P-labeled PCR products corresponding to nucleotides 880–1360 for ephrin B1, 100–370 for 4-1BB ligand, 260–730 for ISLR, and 260–940 for autotaxin. Following indicated treatment, cells were lysed in Triton X-100 lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 137 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm EGTA, 10% glycerol, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 50 mmsodium fluoride, and Complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals)) and protein equivalents were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. Blots were incubated with 0.5 μg/ml anti-ephrin B1 goat polyclonal antibody (R&D Systems, Inc.) or 1 μg/ml anti-Myc tag monoclonal antibody (17.Evan G. Lewis G. Ramsey G. Bishop J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 3610-3616Crossref PubMed Scopus (2166) Google Scholar). Blots were developed using the ECL system (Amersham Biosciences). COS-7 cells were transfected with 0.5 μg of the indicated expression plasmids, 0.1 μg of Renillaluciferase (pRL-SV40), and either 0.5 μg of ΔMMTV-TREpal luciferase reporter construct (provided by S. Beyers) or 0.5 μg of pTopflash (provided by H. Clevers) using Effectene (Qiagen) transfection reagent per the manufacturer's instructions. Expression plasmids for β-catenin and TCF/LEF have been described elsewhere (18.Porfiri E. Rubinfeld B. Albert I. Hovanes K. Waterman M. Polakis P. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 2833-2839Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Cells were treated with 1 μm ATRA or Me2SO as control on the day of transfection and harvested 72 h later. Luciferase activity in 10 μl of lysate was analyzed in duplicate using the Promega Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System and a Tropix TR717 microplate luminometer. The mouse C57MG mammary epithelial cell line undergoes morphological transformation in response to the expression of various Wnt genes (19.Wong G.T. Gavin B.J. McMahon A.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6278-6286Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). A version of this cell line that was engineered to conditionally express Wnt-1 in response to the removal of tetracycline from the culture medium was used for the gene expression profiling experiments. To identify genes that were preferentially activated by the combination of retinoic acid and Wnt-1 signaling, four different conditions were established for the treatment of cells. As a control, cells were left in medium containing tetracycline plus Me2SO, the vehicle for retinoic acid. A second dish of cells was treated with 1 μm ATRA in the presence of tetracycline, while a third dish of cells received Me2SO, and the tetracycline was removed to activate expression of Wnt-1. Finally a fourth dish of cells was treated with retinoic acid, and the tetracycline was removed. Following a 48-h incubation period, cells were harvested, and RNA was extracted and purified. Biotinylated cRNA synthesized from the RNA was hybridized to the Affymetrix Mouse Gene Chip Mu74 A containing over 12,000 oligonucleotide probe sets. The experiment, as initiated from the growth and treatment of cells, was performed three independent times. Data are presented for mRNA transcripts that underwent at least a 2-fold increase relative to those from untreated cells in all three experiments. Treatment of the C57MG cells with retinoic acid alone resulted in the robust activation of numerous genes (Table I). Some of these genes, such as decorin (20.Pearson D. Sasse J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25364-25370Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 1A (11β-HSD1A) (21.Tremblay J. Hardy D.B. Pereira L.E. Yang K. Biol.

Hoppe Seyler. 1993; 374: 193-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) have been reported previously to be up-regulated by retinoic acid in other cell types. The identification of these genes in our screen demonstrates that the C57MG cells respond appropriately to retinoic acid and suggests that common end points for retinoic acid signaling exist in diverse cell types. Additional genes induced by retinoic acid, such as retSDR1 and aldehyde dehydrogenase 3, code for enzymes that are involved in the metabolism of retinoids and might, therefore, represent feedback or feed-forward responses to retinoic acid itself (28.Duester G. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 4315-4324Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). Increased expression of receptor-interacting protein 140, which has been shown to interact with retinoic acid receptors and suppress their activity, might represent another feedback mechanism (29.Lee C.H. Wei L.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31320-31326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Several other genes that were induced by retinoic acid, such as angiotensinogen and pancreatic ribonuclease 1, bear no obvious connection to retinoic acid receptor signaling or metabolism and have not been previously reported to be activated by receptors responsive to retinoic acid.Table IGenes induced by retinoic acidGeneGenBank™ acc. no.Avg. -fold changeS.D.AngiotensinogenAF04588727.6317.34retSDR1X9528125.6728.78Ribonuclease 1X6010318.6010.87LPS-binding proteinX9934715.106.74DecorinX539298.074.4611β-HSD1AX832027.974.02AutotaxinAW1229337.905.72Type 2 deiodinaseAF0968757.635.71COUP-TFX741347.002.65Aldehyde dehydrogenase 3AF0330346.433.073-O-SulfotransferaseAF0193856.133.97Ficolin-AAB0078135.873.69Lysosomal acid lipaseZ316895.602.46OsteoglycinD319514.432.15Abca 1AI8455144.402.12KallikreinV008294.331.22Cathepsin BAI8512553.901.21Complement component C3K027823.832.67Procollogen, type IV, α 5Z351683.531.01Diacylglycerol acyltransferaseAF0787523.401.45Chaperonin containing TCP-1 ε subunitAW0493733.331.88VEGFCU736203.100.95GlutathioneS-transferase, α 1L060473.100.80CeruloplasminU494303.031.30Sorting nexin 10AI7468462.901.15Receptor-interacting protein 140AF0530622.831.62Megakaryocyte potentiating factorD863702.731.35Annexin VIX134602.671.50MG87AW1242682.630.75PrefoldinAB0239572.600.44Myristoylated alanine-rich PKC substrateM604742.600.78Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factorAJ0100452.430.55Solute carrier family 12, member 2U131742.400.61Guanylate nucleotide-binding protein 3 (Gbp3)AW0474762.370.58Isovaleryl CoA dehydrogenase (Ivd)AW0477432.371.16α-2,3-SialyltransferaseD289412.370.35Retinoblastoma-1M263912.370.40Caspase 3U548032.371.07Acyl-CoA synthetaseAA6192072.300.36Lysosomal membrane glycoprotein 2M320172.300.56TM6P1AA8810182.230.47Mad4U323952.170.21Interleukin 1-β-converting enzymeL280952.000.26Acc., accession; Avg., average; LPS, lipopolysaccharide;VEGFC, vascular endothelial growth factor C; PKC, protein kinase C; COUP-TF, chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter-transcription factor; 11β-HSD1A, 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 1A.

To identify genes induced by Wnt-1, tetracycline was removed from the cells in the absence of retinoic acid. Under these conditions, 12 transcripts were identified that were expressed at 2-fold or higher levels relative to control cells in all three experiments (Table II). This is likely an underestimate of the number of genes that are actually induced by Wnt-1 signaling in these cells due to some amount of leaky Wnt-1 expression. Other genes, including the Wnt-1 target cyclin D1 (2.Tetsu O. McCormick F. Nature. 1998; 398: 422-426Crossref Scopus (3265) Google Scholar), were identified in only two of the three experiments or fell short of the 2-fold cutoff. Two of the genes identified in our screen, the TCF1 andBTEB2 transcription factors, were previously reported to be targets of Wnt signaling (30.Ziemer L.T. Pennica D. Levine A.J. Mol. Cell.

Splice variants of TCF1 that bind DNA but lack β-catenin binding sites provide negative feedback in Wnt signaling and thus function as tumor suppressors. In addition, one of the Wnt receptors, frizzled-2, was also up-regulated by Wnt signaling in the C57MG cell line.Table IIGenes induced by Wnt-1GeneGenBank™ acc. no.Avg. -fold changeS.D.Autotaxin-tAW1229334.271.524-1BB ligandL154353.531.21EIG180AB0239573.000.26Semaphorin EX859942.900.90BTEB2(IKLF)AA6117662.800.26G28K GTP-binding proteinAW1212942.730.61SSG-1steroid-sensitive gene-1 proteinAW1220122.571.10TCF-1AI0191932.570.81GADD45γAF0556382.430.25frizzled-2AW1236182.230.23ets-2J041032.200.40TSA-1U477372.131.01Acc., accession; Avg., average; IKLF, intestinal-enriched Kruppel-like factor.

Some of the genes up-regulated by Wnt-1, such as GADD45 γ and 4-1BB ligand, might represent a response to inappropriate growth signaling due to the overexpression of Wnt-1. The 4-1BB ligand (CD137) is a tumor necrosis factor superfamily member that is expressed on various human carcinoma cell lines and stimulates T cell responses in tumor rejection (32.Salih H.R. Kosowski S.G. Haluska V.F. Starling G.C. Loo D.T. Lee F. Aruffo A.A. Trail P.A. Kiener P.A. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 2903-2910Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). GADD45 γ can be induced by genotoxic stress and promotes growth suppression and apoptotic cell death (33.Zhang W. Hoffman B. Liebermann D.A. Int. J. Oncol. 2001; 18: 749-757PubMed Google Scholar). Two additional genes up-regulated by Wnt-1, semaphorin E and autotaxin, have been implicated in human tumor progression as factors contributing to the motility and metastatic spread of cancer cells (34.Martin-Satue M. Blanco J. J. Surg. Oncol. 1999; 72: 18-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar, 35.Yamada T. Endo R. Gotoh M. Hirohashi S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Oncogene. 2000; 19: 241-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). In a previous study we identified stra6 as a gene activated by Wnt-1 signaling (15.Szeto W. Jiang W. Tice D.A. Rubinfeld B. Hollingshead P.G. Fong S.E. Dugger D.L. Pham T. Yansura D.G. Wong T.A. Grimaldi J.C. Corpuz R.T. Singh J.S. Frantz G.D. Devaux B. Crowley C.W. Schwall R.H. Eberhard D.A. Rastelli L. Polakis P. Pennica D. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 4197-4205PubMed Google Scholar). stra6 encodes a cell surface protein that was originally identified in a screen designed to detect mRNA transcripts induced by retinoic acid receptor signaling (37.Bouillet P. Oulad-Abdelghani M. Vicaire S. Garnier J.M. Schuhbaur B. Dolle P. Chambon P. Dev. Biol. 1995; 170: 420-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Although we found that retinoic acid induced the expression ofstra6, we also demonstrated its synergistic activation by a combination of Wnt-1 and retinoic acid. Therefore, we were interested in whether other cell surface proteins in addition to Stra6 could be activated in a similar fashion. Consistent with our previous findings, the present screen identified stra6 as a gene modestly activated by either retinoic acid or Wnt-1, while the combination of these agents resulted in expression levels greatly exceeding that observed with either agent alone (data not shown). In addition tostra6, 10 transcripts were increased by the combination of agents compared with addition of either single agent including four genes encoding cell surface proteins (Table III). Ephrin B1, which encodes a transmembrane ligand for the Eph family of tyrosine kinase receptors (38.Schmucker D. Zipursky S.L. Cell. 2001; 105: 701-704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), was synergistically induced by RA and Wnt-1. The results for ephrin B1 were confirmed by RT-PCR, Northern blot, and Western blot analysis (Fig. 1A). Induction of ephrin B1 differed somewhat from Stra6 in that it was induced by co-treatment of Wnt-1 and RA but not significantly by either treatment alone. By contrast, the gene coding for the transmembrane 4-1BB ligand was moderately activated by Wnt-1 and not by RA but synergistically activated by both agents (Fig. 1B).Table IIIGenes induced"

In this study, we have examined the role of RhoA in regulating the adhesive function of the major platelet integrin, αIIbβ3. Our studies demonstrate that activation of RhoA occurs as a general feature of platelet activation in response to soluble agonists (thrombin, ADP, U46619, collagen), immobilized matrices (von Willebrand factor (vWf), fibrinogen) and high shear stress. Blocking the ligand binding function of integrin αIIbβ3, by pretreating platelets with c7E3 Fab, demonstrated the existence of integrin αIIbβ3-dependent and -independent mechanisms regulating RhoA activation. Inhibition of RhoA (C3 exoenzyme) or its downstream effector Rho kinase (Y27632) had no effect on integrin αIIbβ3 activation induced by soluble agonists or adhesive substrates, however, both inhibitors reduced shear-dependent platelet adhesion on immobilized vWf and shear-induced platelet aggregation in suspension. Detailed analysis of the sequential adhesive steps required for stable platelet adhesion on a vWf matrix under shear conditions revealed that RhoA did not regulate platelet tethering to vWf or the initial formation of integrin αIIbβ3 adhesion contacts but played a major role in sustaining stable platelet-matrix interactions.

Platelet adhesion and aggregation at sites of vascular injury is essential for the arrest of bleeding and for subsequent vessel wall repair. The ability of platelets to adhere under conditions of rapid blood flow requires the synergistic contribution of multiple receptor-ligand interactions, foremost of which involves the interaction between von Willebrand factor (vWf) 1The abbreviations used are: vWfvon Willebrand factorGPglycoproteinMLCmyosin light chainHvWfhuman vWfRBCred blood cellsGSTglutathione S-transferaseGEFguanine-nucleotide exchange factorSIPAshear-induced platelet activationAs-vWfasialo-vWfFAfocal adhesionRGDSarginine-glycine-aspartic acid-serineTRAPthrombin receptor agonist peptide1The abbreviations used are: vWfvon Willebrand factorGPglycoproteinMLCmyosin light chainHvWfhuman vWfRBCred blood cellsGSTglutathione S-transferaseGEFguanine-nucleotide exchange factorSIPAshear-induced platelet activationAs-vWfasialo-vWfFAfocal adhesionRGDSarginine-glycine-aspartic acid-serineTRAPthrombin receptor agonist peptide and the two major platelet adhesion receptors, glycoprotein (GP) Ib/V/IX and integrin αIIbβ3. The vWf·GP Ib/V/IX interaction is characterized by a rapid association rate that enables efficient platelet tethering to the injured vessel wall, whereas subsequent integrin αIIbβ3engagement of vWf is important for promoting platelet arrest (1.Ruggeri Z.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 559-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). The vWf·GP Ib/V/IX interaction is indispensable for normal platelet function, because it slows platelet movement at the vessel wall thereby enabling receptors with slower intrinsic binding kinetics,i.e. integrins, to engage adhesive ligands. A similar dual-step adhesion mechanism, involving selectins and β2integrins, is employed by leukocytes to adhere to post-capillary venules at sites of inflammation (2.Lawrence M.B. Springer T.A. Cell. 1991; 65: 859-873Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1869) Google Scholar, 3.Ley K. Gaehtgens P. Fennie C. Singer M.S. Lasky L.A. Rosen S.D.

In the case of platelets, the shear forces operating on adhesive bonds can be extremely high, particularly at sites of arterial narrowing where shear forces can exceed 380 dyne/cm2(10,000 s−1). The ability of the GP Ib/V/IX complex to maintain platelet adhesive interactions under such high shear conditions is due to the large number of bonds formed between vWf and GP Ib, the inherent biomechanical stability of the vWf·GP Ib interaction, and anchorage of the receptor complex to the membrane skeleton (1.Ruggeri Z.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 559-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). The factors that regulate the stability of integrin αIIbβ3 adhesion contacts in a shear field remain less clearly defined. It is well established that integrin engagement of adhesive ligands leads to receptor clustering and the formation of firm anchorage points with the actin-based cytoskeleton (5.Shattil S.J. Thromb. Haemost. 1999; 82: 318-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar), however, the importance of such post-ligand binding events for sustaining platelet adhesion in a shear field remains unclear. The adhesive function of many integrins is regulated in part by RhoA, a member of the Ras homologous (Rho) family of small GTPases (6.Kaibucki K. Kuroda S. Amano M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 459-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (883) Google Scholar). RhoA activation has been extensively studied in a range of cultured cell and is critical for the formation of actin stress fibers and focal adhesions (7.Burridge K. Chrzanowska-Wodnicka M. Zhong C. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 342-347Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Several RhoA effector proteins have been implicated in the formation of these structures, including p140mDia and Rho kinase (p160ROCK, ROKα). The effect of Rho kinase on focal adhesion formation appears to involve phosphorylation and inactivation of myosin light chain (MLC) phosphatase leading to increased MLC phosphorylation and enhanced myosin II contractility, resulting in tension on actin filaments and their subsequent alignment. Furthermore, RhoA-mediated activation of phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate 5-kinase induces the formation of phosphatidylinositol (4,5)-bisphosphate, a widely acting phospholipid that promotes actin polymerization and cytoskeletal-membrane attachment (8.Schoenwaelder S.M. Burridge K. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 274-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar, 9.Burridge K. Chrzanowska-Wodnicka M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 463-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (1639) Google Scholar). The culmination of these and other RhoA-mediated signaling events leads to bundling of actin filaments into actin cables or thick stress fibers and the clustering of their associated integrin receptors into focal adhesions (7.Burridge K. Chrzanowska-Wodnicka M. Zhong C. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 342-347Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). These cytoskeletal changes induced by RhoA leads to strong cell attachment points with the extracellular matrix (8.Schoenwaelder S.M. Burridge K. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 274-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar). The platelet contains relatively high levels of RhoA, along with other RhoA effectors (10.Morii N. Teru-uchi T. Tominaga T. Kumagai N. Kozaki S. Ushikubi F. Narumiya S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20921-20926Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, despite this, very little is known about the mechanisms of RhoA activation or its contribution to integrin-mediated adhesive responses in platelets. Recent studies have demonstrated RhoA activation in response to thrombin (11.Bodie S.L. Ford I. Greaves M. Nixon G.F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 287: 71-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) and the thromboxane mimetic, U46619 (12.Gratacap M.-P. Payrastre B. Nieswandt B. Offermanns S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47906-47913Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), with activation of RhoA by the latter agonist reported to occur independent of integrin αIIbβ3 (12.Gratacap M.-P. Payrastre B. Nieswandt B. Offermanns S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47906-47913Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The role of RhoA in regulating the adhesive function of integrin αIIbβ3remains controversial (10.Morii N. Teru-uchi T. Tominaga T. Kumagai N. Kozaki S. Ushikubi F. Narumiya S. J. Biol.

Chem. 1992; 267: 20921-20926Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), more recent studies have not supported these conclusions (13.Leng L. Kashiwagi H. Ren X.-D. Shattil S.J.

Haemost. 2001; 85: 694-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In general, these latter findings are in keeping with studies on cultured cells in which changes in the activation status of RhoA do not correlate with alterations in integrin affinity (18.Schwartz M.A. Shattil S.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 388-391Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). In the current study, we have investigated the role of RhoA in regulating the adhesive function of integrin αIIbβ3. Our studies have demonstrated the existence of integrin αIIbβ3-dependent and -independent mechanisms regulating RhoA activation. Although RhoA activation appears to represent a general feature of platelet activation, our studies do not support an important role for RhoA in regulating the affinity status of integrin αIIbβ3. Rather, we demonstrate an important role for RhoA in regulating the stability of integrin αIIbβ3 adhesion contacts. The ability of RhoA to sustain integrin αIIbβ3·matrix interactions appears critical for efficient platelet adhesion in a shear field.

Fractions containing purified vWf were pooled and concentrated by centrifugation. Purified vWf (100 μg/ml) was dialyzed in 0.05 m sodium acetate, 150 mm NaCl, 8 mm CaCl2, pH 6.0, at 4 °C, followed by incubation with 0.1 unit of α2–3,6,8-neuraminidase, Vibrio cholerae(Calbiochem-Novabiochem Corp.) for 3 h at 37οC. De-sialylated vWf was dialyzed in 10 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4, and platelet aggregating activity was confirmed by addition of 20 μg/ml purified protein to citrated platelet-rich plasma. Human fibrinogen was purified from fresh frozen plasma, according to the method of Jakobsen and Koerulf (25.Jakobsen E. Koerulf P. Thromb. Res. 1979; 3: 145-159Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Whole blood (anticoagulated with acid-citrate-dextrose) was collected from healthy volunteers who had not received any anti-platelet medication in the preceding 2 weeks. Washed platelets were prepared as previously described (21.Yuan Y. Dopheide S.M. Ivanidis C. Salem H.H. Jackson S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21847-21854Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) and resuspended in Tyrode's buffer (10 mmHepes, 12 mm NaHCO3, pH 7.4, 137 mmNaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 5 mm glucose) containing 1 mm calcium, where indicated. Autologous red blood cells (RBCs) were obtained as described previously (23.Yap C.L. Hughan S.C. Cranmer S.L. Nesbitt W.S. Rooney M.M. Giuliano S. Kularni S. Dopheide S.M. Yuan Y. Salem H.H.

A construct encoding recombinant C3 exoenzyme (a gift from Prof. Keith Burridge, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC) was expressed as a glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein inEscherichia coli, followed by thrombin-mediated cleavage of the GST tag, as described by Dillon and Feig (26.Dillon S.T. Feig L.A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 256: 174-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Purified C3 exoenzyme was dialyzed against Tyrode's buffer overnight at 4 °C. Platelets in platelet washing buffer (pH 6.5) were incubated with purified C3 exoenzyme (100 μg/ml) in the presence of 200 units of hirudin for 4 h at room temperature. Using these conditions, we routinely achieved ∼80% inhibition of RhoA (Fig. 3 A), without significant loss of platelet reactivity (data not shown). The Rho kinase inhibitor Y27632 was prepared as described previously by Uehata and colleagues (63.Uehata, M., Ono, T., Satoh, H., Yamagami, K., and Kawahara, T. (April 17, 2001) U. S. Patent 4997834Google Scholar). Washed platelets resuspended in Tyrode's buffer were incubated with vehicle alone (Me2SO) or Y27632 (20 μm) for 10 min at room temperature. ADP-ribosylation of RhoA in platelet extracts was analyzed using a modified method as described by Leng and colleagues, et al. (13.Leng L. Kashiwagi H. Ren X.-D. Shattil S.J. Blood. 1998; 91: 4206-4215Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, platelets incubated with vehicle alone or the indicated concentrations of C3 exoenzyme, were lysed on ice by the addition of an equal volume of lysis buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 145 mmNaCl, 1.5% Triton X-100, 0.8% deoxycholate, 0.2% SDS, 3 mm EGTA, 2 mm MgCl2, 50 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin). Immediately prior to lysis, an equivalent amount of C3 exoenzyme was added to control platelets. In vitroADP-ribosylation was performed immediately at 30 °C for 60 min, by addition of 200 μm GTP, 10 μmNAD+, 10 μg/ml C3 exoenzyme, and 05–2.5 μCi/assay [32P]NAD+. Reactions were terminated by the addition of sample buffer, boiled, and analyzed on SDS-PAGE, followed by autoradiography. The level of GTP-bound RhoA in platelet lysates was measured as described previously (27.Ren X.-D. Kiosses W.B. Schwartz M.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 578-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (1350) Google Scholar, 28.Schoenwaelder S.M. Petch L.A. Williamson D. Shen R. Feng G.S. Burridge K. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 1523-1526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Western blots were quantified by densitometry (GelPro software), and RhoA activation expressed as -fold increase over the level of active RhoA in resting platelets, after correcting for protein loading (histograms). Washed platelets were stimulated with the indicated concentrations of agonist, in the presence of calcium (1 mm) and fibrinogen (500 μg/ml). Aggregation initiated by thrombin was performed in the absence of fibrinogen. All aggregations were initiated by stirring the suspensions at 950 rpm for 10 min at 37 °C in a four-channel automated platelet analyzer (Kyoto Daiichi, Japan). The extent of platelet aggregation was defined as the percentage change in optical density as measured by the automated platelet analyzer. Static adhesion assays were performed using a modified method of Yap et al. (23.Yap C.L. Hughan S.C. Cranmer S.L. Nesbitt W.S. Rooney M.M. Giuliano S. Kularni S. Dopheide S.M. Yuan Y. Salem H.H.

Briefly, glass coverslips were coated with 10 μg/ml HvWf for 2 h at room temperature, followed by blocking with 10% heat-inactivated human serum for 60 min at room temperature. Platelets were incubated with immobilized matrices for between 30–60 min, unless otherwise indicated, and visualized using phase contrast microscopy. Images were captured, and the surface area of adherent platelets was determined using MCID software (Imaging Research Inc.). The number of C3 exoenzyme-treated adherent platelets and surface area of C3 exoenzyme-treated adherent platelets was expressed as a percentage of vehicle-treated control platelets. Flow assays were performed using glass microcapillary tubes (Microslides, Vitro Dynamics Inc.) coated with 100 μg/ml HvWf, according to the method described by Yap et al. (23.Yap C.L. Hughan S.C. Cranmer S.L. Nesbitt W.S. Rooney M.M. Giuliano S. Kularni S. Dopheide S.M. Yuan Y. Salem H.H. Jackson S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 41377-41388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Microcapillary tubes were blocked with 10% heat-inactivated human serum prior to use. Washed platelets reconstituted with RBCs (50% hematocrit) were perfused across coated microcapillary tubes at shear rates of 600 and 1800 s−1. Platelet tethering and stationary adhesion was visualized in real time using differential interference contrast microscopy and the first 2 min of flow video recorded for off-line analysis. In all studies, off-line analyses of platelet tethering and stationary adhesion were performed as described previously (23.Yap C.L. Hughan S.C. Cranmer S.L. Nesbitt W.S. Rooney M.M. Giuliano S. Kularni S. Dopheide S.M. Yuan Y. Salem H.H. Jackson S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 41377-41388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Briefly, any cell forming an adhesion contact with immobilized HvWf for greater than 40 ms was scored as a tethered cell. Stationary adhesion was arbitrarily defined as cells not moving more than a single cell diameter over a 10-s period. The duration of stationary platelet adhesion contacts was determined on individual platelets that had formed stationary interactions with immobilized vWf for a period of ≥1 s. Individual cells were analyzed every second for a period up to 30 s, and stationary adhesion was arbitrarily defined as cells not moving more than a single cell diameter over a 1-s period. For analysis of platelet spreading, adherent platelets were washed for 15 min with Tyrode's buffer (1800 s−1), visualized using phase contrast microscopy, and video recorded for off-line analysis. Platelet spreading was analyzed as described for the static adhesion assays. Control orY27632- or C3 exoenzyme-treated platelets, resuspended in Tyrode's buffer, pH 7.5, and containing 1 mm CaCl2, were subjected to shear (5000 s−1) in the presence of 20 μg/ml HvWf for 5 min, using a cone-and-plate viscometer, as described previously (29.Mistry M. Cranmer S.L. Yuan Y. Mangin P. Dopheide S.M. Harper I. Giuliano S. Dunstan D.E. Lanza F. Salem H.H. Jackson S.P. Blood. 2000; 96: 3480-3489Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Platelets were visualized using inverse phase contrast microscopy (×5 objective), and images were captured using a charge-coupled device camera. Five random fields were captured from each experimental sample, and quantification of single platelets was performed using MCID software. PAC1 immunofluorescence was performed under static and flow conditions, as described previously (23.Yap C.L. Hughan S.C. Cranmer S.L. Nesbitt W.S. Rooney M.M. Giuliano S. Kularni S. Dopheide S.M. Yuan Y. Salem H.H. Jackson S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 41377-41388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Platelets were imaged via confocal microscopy, using ×100 oil immersion, and quantitation was performed using Leica software. Significant differences were detected using an unpaired t test with one-way analysis of variance, using Prism software (GraphPad Software for Science, San Diego, CA). Platelets respond to a multitude of activating stimuli in vivo, including soluble agonists generated at the site of vascular injury, adhesive substrates present within the damaged vessel wall, and hemodynamic forces generated by the flow of blood. In an attempt to gain further insight into the functional role of RhoA in platelets, we initially examined whether RhoA activation was restricted to a subset of platelet-activating stimuli or occurred as a general feature of platelet activation. Initially, platelets were stimulated in suspension with a diverse range of soluble agonists, including potent agonists such as thrombin, collagen, and the thromboxane A2 mimetic,U46619, or weaker agonists such as ADP. To monitor RhoA activation directly, we utilized an assay that selectively isolates GTP-bound active RhoA from cell lysates (27.Ren X.-D. Kiosses W.B. Schwartz M.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 578-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (1350) Google Scholar) by precipitation with the RhoA binding domain of the downstream effector Rhotekin (GST-RBD), as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Consistent with previous reports (11.Bodie S.L. Ford I. Greaves M. Nixon G.F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 287: 71-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 12.Gratacap M.-P. Payrastre B. Nieswandt B. Offermanns S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47906-47913Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), RhoA activation was induced by thrombin (1 unit/ml) and U46619 (500 nm) (Fig. 1,left). In addition, RhoA activation was also induced by collagen (10 μg/ml) and ADP (25 μm), but with the latter agonist the rate and extent of RhoA activation was substantially less than with the other agonists (Fig. 1 A, and data not shown). In cultured cells, the activation status of RhoA is regulated by soluble growth factors and integrin adhesion receptors (18.Schwartz M.A. Shattil S.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 388-391Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 30.Zohn I.M. Campbell S.L. Khosravi-Far R. Rossman K.L. Der C.J. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1415-1438Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). However, to date, there is no evidence that platelet integrins are involved in regulating RhoA. To examine the potential involvement of the major platelet integrin αIIbβ3 in this process, platelets were pretreated with the integrin αIIbβ3-blocking antibody c7E3 Fab, prior to the performance of platelet aggregation studies. In thrombin-stimulated platelets, c7E3 Fab-pretreatment resulted in a reduction of ∼70% in RhoA activation (Fig. 1 B), whereas with U46619, collagen, and ADP, integrin αIIbβ3 inhibition resulted in >90% inhibition of RhoA activation. Our findings with respect to U46619 are in direct contrast to those recently reported by Gratacap and colleagues (12.Gratacap M.-P. Payrastre B. Nieswandt B. Offermanns S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47906-47913Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) who demonstrated that integrin αIIbβ3 blockade with RGDS peptides had no inhibitory effect on RhoA activation. To investigate potential explanations for this difference, we compared the effects of RGDS peptide and c7E3 Fab on the activation of RhoA induced by U46619 under identical experimental conditions employed by Gratacap et al. (12.Gratacap M.-P. Payrastre B. Nieswandt B. Offermanns S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47906-47913Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Consistent with previous findings (12.Gratacap M.-P. Payrastre B. Nieswandt B. Offermanns S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47906-47913Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), we did not detect any inhibitory effect of RGDS peptide on RhoA activation induced by U46619, however, c7E3 Fab dramatically inhibited RhoA activation under identical experimental conditions (Fig. 1 C). Findings similar to c7E3 Fab were observed with another potent integrin αIIbβ3 antagonist, aggrastat (data not shown). These findings suggest that RGDS peptide may not completely block ligand binding to integrin αIIbβ3, a finding consistent with previous reports (31.Jones K.L. Hughan S.C. Dopheide S.M. Farndale R.W. Jackson S.P. Jackson D.E. Blood. 2001; 98: 1456-1463Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). To examine whether RhoA activation represents a general feature of platelet activation, changes in RhoA activity were assessed following platelet adhesion to immobilized substrates and in platelets exposed to high shear stress. As demonstrated in Fig. 2, adhesion and spreading of platelets on either a fibrinogen (100 μg/ml) or human vWf (10 μg/ml) matrix was associated with significant RhoA activation, similar to the levels observed with soluble agonist stimulation. Pretreating platelets with c7E3 Fab prior to adhesion to vWf inhibited RhoA activation by >95% (Fig. 2 B). To examine the effects of high fluid shear stress on RhoA activation, shear-induced platelet activation (SIPA) studies were performed using a cone-and-plate viscometer, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” In control studies, we demonstrated that high shear rates (typically ≥3000 s−1) were required to induce aggregation of washed platelets independent of the addition of exogenous stimuli. Furthermore, aggregation under these experimental conditions was dependent on vWf binding to GPIb and integrin αIIbβ3, because it was completely inhibited by pretreating platelets with blocking antibodies against either receptor (data not shown). As demonstrated in Fig. 2 A, exposure of platelets in suspension to high shear (5000 s−1) in the presence of purified soluble human vWf, induced p"

To identify the target genes of PLAGL2, we transfected mouse PLAGL2 cDNA into Balb/c3T3 fibroblasts and neuroblastoma Neuro2a cells. Both cells were induced to undergo apoptosis by the expression of PLAGL2 as judged by assays of TUNEL (terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick end-labeling), DNA fragmentation, propidium iodide staining, and the binding of annexin V to the cell surface. The treatment of the cells with an iron chelator, desferrioxamine, resulted in the induction of apoptosis with a concomitant accumulation of PLAGL2 in the nucleus. The expression of PLAGL2 in Balb/c3T3 cells led to the mRNA expression of a proapoptotic factor, Nip3, which can dimerize with Bcl-2. Nip3 mRNA was also induced in desferrioxamine-treated cells. Furthermore, the Nip3 promoter containing a hypoxia-responsive element was activated by PLAGL2, independent of hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1). The transfection of antisense oligonucleotide to mouse Nip3 mRNA into PLAGL2-expressing cells led to a decrease in apoptotic cells compared with sense oligonucleotide-transfected cells. Despite the activation of DNA-HIF-1 binding activity under hypoxic conditions, neither an accumulation of HIF-1α nor the activation of HIF-1 was observed following the expression of PLAGL2. These results indicate that PLAGL2 is located downstream of HIF-1 and suggest that PLAGL2 functions as a tumor suppressor in association with HIF-1.

In solid tumors, low cellular oxygen tension or hypoxia selects for death-resistant cells, which confer a poor prognosis and contribute to cancer progression (3Graeber T.G. Osmanian C. Jacks T. Housman D.E. Koch C.J. Giaccia A.J. Nature. 1996; 379: 88-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (2164) Google Scholar). Under hypoxia, some cells are irreversibly injured and die, whereas others adapt and survive. Although the expression of specific genes within cells seems to be the key to this survival, the factors that determine the fate of individual cells under hypoxia are poorly understood. Hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1),1 a well known mediator of hypoxic response in mammalian cells, is a heterodimer composed of HIF-1α and HIF-1β (4An W.G. Kanekal M. Simon M.C. Maltope E.

Biol. 1992; 12: 5447-5454Crossref PubMed Scopus (2173) Google Scholar). Although HIF-1β is expressed constitutively, the expression of HIF-1α is precisely regulated by cellular oxygen levels (6Wang G.L. Jiang B.-H. Rue E.A. Semenza G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5510-5514Crossref PubMed Scopus (4991) Google Scholar). Hypoxia leads to the stabilization of HIF-1 and targeted DNA binding, which initiates the expression of several gene products such as glucose transporters, glycolytic enzymes, erythropoietin, and vascular endothelial growth factor (7Levy A.P.

The PLAG family consisting of PLAG1 and PLAGL1 (also called Zac1) are developmentally regulated C2H2 zinc finger proteins and the main targets for pleomorphic adenomas of the salivary gland (9Spengler D.

Oncogene. 1998; 16: 1409-1416Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). PLAGL1/Zac1 is a nuclear factor exhibiting DNA binding and transcriptional activation activity and seems to be constitutively expressed in specific murine tissues. Zac1 is also implicated in apoptosis and cell cycle arrest (12Varrault A. Ciani E. Apiou F. Bilanges B. Hoffmann A. Pantaloni C. Bockaert J. Spengler D. Journot L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8835-8840Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Zac1 was separately isolated in the search for genes whose expression is lost in an in vitro model of cell transformation, hence the nameLot1 for lost ontransformation (13Abdollahi A. Godwin A.K.

Sclegelberger B. Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 1997; 18: 310-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 16Queimado L. Seruca R. Costa-Pereira A. Castedo S. Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 1995; 14: 28-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), a chromosomal region known to harbor a tumor suppressor gene for many types of solid tumors including breast and ovary tumors as well as melanoma (15Zhang Y.

Castedo S. Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 1995; 14: 28-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The expression in tumor cells demonstrated that Zac1 inhibits tumor cell proliferation through induction of apoptosis and cell cycle arrest (9Spengler D. Villalba M. Hoffman A. Pantaloni C. Houssami S. Bockaert J. Journot L. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2814-2825Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar), but the molecular mechanism behind the antiproliferative activity of Zac1 remains to be clarified. We recently found that the expression of PLAGL2, another member of the PLAG superfamily exhibiting antiproliferative effects on tumor cells, was induced by hypoxia and iron deficiency (17Furukawa T. Adachi Y. Fujisawa J. Kambe T. Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Sasaki R. Kuwahara J. Ikehara S. Tokunaga R. Taketani S. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 4718-4727Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). PLAGL2 is a ubiquitously expressed nuclear factor, which bound to a GC-rich oligonucleotide whose reporter was transactivated (17Furukawa T. Adachi Y. Fujisawa J. Kambe T. Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Sasaki R.

Chem. 1998; 273: 23026-23032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the transient expression of PLAGL2 led to the stimulation of luciferase reporter activities of the LDHA and erythropoietin promoters that carry HRE (17Furukawa T. Adachi Y. Fujisawa J. Kambe T. Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Sasaki R. Kuwahara J. Ikehara S. Tokunaga R. Taketani S. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 4718-4727Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The promoter activity enhanced in iron-deficient or hypoxic cells was strengthened by PLAGL2 independent of HIF-1. A considerable portion of the pro-apoptotic versusantiapoptotic cellular proteins of the Bcl-2 family localize to separate subcellular compartments in the absence of a death signal (19Gross A. McDonnell J.M. Korsmeyer S.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1899-1911Crossref PubMed Scopus (3245) Google Scholar) The ratio between pro-apoptotic and antiapoptotic members of this family has been shown to modulate the sensitivity of cells to mitochondrial integrity in response to apoptotic signals. Namely, a substantial fraction of the proapoptotic members localize to cytosol or cytoskeleton prior to the generation of a death signal (19Gross A. McDonnell J.M. Korsmeyer S.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1899-1911Crossref PubMed Scopus (3245) Google Scholar, 20Kelekar A. Thompson C.B. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 324-330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar). Activation of the proapoptotic molecule Bax appears to involve translocation and dimerization. In addition, expression of the proapoptotic protein Nip3 in neuroblastoma cells was induced by hypoxia at the transcriptional level, leading to cell death (21Bruick R.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9082-9087Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar). The promoter of the Nip3 gene is responsive to hypoxia and to over-expression of HIF-1α via HRE located upstream of the transcriptional start site (21Bruick R.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9082-9087Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar). Thus, HIF-1 has now been shown to play a central role in the hypoxic expression of a variety of genes related to apoptosis and is considered to be a master transcription factor that regulates adaptive gene expression under conditions of oxygen deficiency, but little is known about the role of oxygen-deficient inducible nuclear factors. Because iron-deficient conditions mimic the effect of oxygen deprivation on a number of hypoxia-responsive genes (17Furukawa T. Adachi Y. Fujisawa J. Kambe T. Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Sasaki R. Kuwahara J.

A. 2000; 97: 9082-9087Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar), we mainly studied the role of PLAGL2 by treating cells with an iron chelator, desferrioxamine. Here, we report that the expression of PLAGL2 in the nucleus caused apoptosis mediated by the induction of a proapoptotic protein, Nip3. The treatment of neuroblastoma cells and fibroblasts with desferrioxamine resulted in the induction of apoptosis with indications of PLAGL2 and Nip3. The role of PLAGL2 in the activation of gene expression during apoptosis will be discussed in text. Mouse Balb/c3T3 fibroblasts and neuroblastoma Neuro2a cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (Nacalai Tesque Co.) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen) and antibiotics. To reduce intracellular levels of iron, the cells were incubated in the medium in the presence of 100 μm desferrioxamine for a given period. Balb/c3T3 cells were transfected using a LipofectAMINE reagent (Invitrogen). Neuro2a cells were transfected by electroporation at 960 microfarads (capacitance) and 250 mA as described previously (22Taketani S. Adachi Y. Kohno H. Ikehara S. Tokunaga R. Ishii T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31388-31394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). DNA probes were generated by PCR from mouse liver and brain cDNA using the following primers: Nip3, 5′-CATGTCGCAGAGCGGGGA-3′ and 5′-CATCAGAAGGTGCTAGT-3′; and Bax, 5′-ATGGACGGGTCCGGGGA-3′ and 5′-TCAGCCCATCTTCTTCCA-3′. Antibodies against mouse PLAGL2 were prepared by injecting a rabbit with 0.5 mg of GST-PLAGL2 (amino acids 252–459) fusion protein in Freund’s complete adjuvant. After three subsequent injections at two-week intervals, the resulting antisera were collected and antibodies were affinity-purified using GST-PLAGL2-bound Sepharose CL-4B (23Mohri T. Adachi Y. Ikehara S. Hioki K. Tokunaga R. Taketani S. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 533-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). For immunoblotting, cellular proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore). The conditions for immunoblotting and the detection of cross-reacted antigens were set as described previously (23Mohri T. Adachi Y. Ikehara S. Hioki K. Tokunaga R. Taketani S. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 533-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The primary antibodies used in this study were anti-HIF-1α (StressGen Inc.), anti-actin (Santa-Cruz Biotechnology Inc.), and anti-PLAGL2. Cells transfected with pCG-PLAGL2 (17Furukawa T. Adachi Y. Fujisawa J. Kambe T. Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Sasaki R. Kuwahara J. Ikehara S. Tokunaga R. Taketani S.

They were then washed with PBS (+) (PBS containing 1 mmCaCl2 and 0.5 mm MgCl2), fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min, and permeabilized in 0.1% Triton X-100 with PBS (+) for 1 h. After blocking with 2% fetal calf serum in PBS (+), incubation with anti-PLAGL2 as the primary antibody was carried out followed by incubation with Cy3-conjugated goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin (Amersham Biosciences) (22Taketani S. Adachi Y. Kohno H. Ikehara S. Tokunaga R. Ishii T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31388-31394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). To identify apoptotic cells by the binding of annexin V to the cell-surface, the fixed cells were incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled annexin V (Molecular Probe) at room temperature for 20 min and then washed three times with PBS (+). The PLAGL2 in the cells and annexin V bound to the cells were visualized by confocal microscopy. To detect DNA fragmentation in apoptotic cells by direct end-labeling of cellular genomic DNA with a fluorescein-conjugated dUTP using terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase enzyme, TUNEL assays were performed using a in situapoptosis detection kit (Takara Co.). Cells were collected at 72 h after transfection or after the addition of desferrioxamine. The cells were resuspended in 100 μl of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 1 mm EDTA and were lysed in 100 μl of a lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 20 mm EDTA, 0.5% Triton X-100) at 4 °C (24Ferris C.D.

Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 152-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). After centrifugation at 900 × g for 10 min, the supernatant was withdrawn and treated with phenol/chloroform (1:1, v/v). The cytoplasmic DNA was then precipitated with ethanol (24Ferris C.D. Jaffrey S.R. Sawa A. Takahashi M. Brady S.D. Barrow R.K. Tysoe S.A. Wolosker H. Baranano D.E. Dore S. Poss K.D. Snyder S.H. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 152-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). The precipitated DNA fraction dissolved in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 1 mm EDTA was treated with 0.1 mg/ml RNase A and 0.1 mg/ml RNase T at 37 °C for 1 h, analyzed on a 2% agarose gel, and detected by ethidium bromide staining. Cultured cells were harvested using 0.05% trypsin, washed in PBS, and suspended in 70% ethanol at 4 °C for 1 h followed by resuspension in 500 μl of PBS, 250 μl of RNase A (1 mg/ml), and 250 μl of PI (100 μg/ml, Molecular Probes). The percentage of apoptotic cells was measured by the estimation of the G0/G1 subpeak in PI staining using a FACScan (BD PharMingen). Phosphorothioate sense (5′-ACCATGTCGCAGAGCGGGGA-3′) oligonucleotides, which were identical to nucleotide positions 81–100 of mouse Nip3 cDNA (25Chen G. Cizeau J. Vande Velde C. Park J.H. Bozek G.

Balb/c3T3 cells (5 × 10 5) transfected with pCG-PLAGL2 were incubated for 16 h and rinsed twice with serum-free Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium. Phosphorothionate sense or antisense oligonucleotides (10 μm) were transfected into the cells using a LipofectAMINE transfection reagent (Invitrogen). After 4-h transfection, the medium was changed to Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium containing 7% fetal calf serum and antibiotics. Cells were incubated for an additional 24 h. Cells were collected by using 0.05% trypsin, washed in PBS, and stained with PI. Total RNA was isolated from Balb/c3T3 and Neuro2a cells using the guanidium isothiocyanate method as described previously (23Mohri T. Adachi Y. Ikehara S. Hioki K. Tokunaga R. Taketani S. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 533-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The RNA was loaded on a 1% agarose/formaldehyde gel, electrophoresed, and transferred onto a nylon membrane (Amersham Biosciences) for hybridization with 32P-labeled DNA fragments of mouse PLAGL2 cDNA (23Mohri T. Adachi Y. Ikehara S. Hioki K. Tokunaga R. Taketani S. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 533-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) and Nip3 cDNA, and then the filter was hybridized and washed as described previously (23Mohri T. Adachi Y. Ikehara S. Hioki K. Tokunaga R. Taketani S. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 533-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Cells were co-transfected with the reporter plasmids, Nip3-Luc and Nip3-Luc(HRE1-Mut) (gifts from Dr. Richard K. Bruick), pSV-β-galactosidase (Promega), and pCG-PLAGL2 (17Furukawa T. Adachi Y.

The cells were collected at 24 h after the transfection and washed twice with PBS. They were then lysed in a reporter lysis buffer (Promega). The lysate was centrifuged, and the supernatants were assayed for luciferase and β-galactosidase activities. The luciferase assay was performed according to the protocol for the luciferase assay system (Promega), and the β-galactosidase assay was performed according to the protocol for the β-galactosidase assay system (ICN). Transfection efficiency was normalized on the basis of β-galactosidase activity. Nuclear extracts were prepared by the method of Schreiber et al. (26Schreiber E. Matthhius P. Muller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6417Crossref PubMed Scopus (3912) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Balb/c3T3 cells (1 × 107) left untreated or treated with 100 μm desferrioxamine for 8 h were washed with 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, containing 0.15 m NaCl and then lysed with 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, containing 0.6% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mmEGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The homogenates were centrifuged to separate the nuclear fraction from the cytoplasmic fraction. The nuclear pellet was resuspended in 100 μl of 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, containing 400 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The nuclear extracts were obtained by centrifugation at 4 °C. Nuclear extracts were also obtained from Balb/c3T3 and Neuro2a cells cultured under hypoxic conditions (17Furukawa T. Adachi Y. Fujisawa J. Kambe T. Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Sasaki R. Kuwahara J. Ikehara S. Tokunaga R. Taketani S. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 4718-4727Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The double-stranded oligonucleotide 5′-GCCCTACGTGCTGTCTCA-3′ containing the consensus sequence HRE (27Wang G.L. Semenza G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1230-1237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1700) Google Scholar) was end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase. Nuclear extracts were incubated with 32P-labeled probes (25,000 cpm) in a reaction buffer containing 25 mmHEPES, pH 7.9, 0.5 mm EDTA, 50 mm KCl, 10% glycerol, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 100 μg/ml poly(dI·dC) with or without the competitor (28Takahashi S. Taketani S. Akasaka J. Kobayashi A. Hayashi N. Yamamoto M. Nagai T. Blood. 1998; 92: 3436-3444Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After a 30-min incubation at room temperature, the reaction mixture was loaded onto 4% polyacrylamide gels containing 50 mm Tris, 380 mm glycine, and 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.5, and electrophoresed at 100 V at 4 °C. The gels were exposed to x-ray film at −80 °C. Previous studies (9Spengler D. Villalba M. Hoffman A. Pantaloni C. Houssami S. Bockaert J. Journot L. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2814-2825Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar,12Varrault A. Ciani E. Apiou F. Bilanges B. Hoffmann A. Pantaloni C. Bockaert J. Spengler D. Journot L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

To elucidate whether PLAGL2 triggers apoptosis, PLAGL2 cDNA was transfected into mouse Balb/c3T3 cells and the analyses of TUNEL and DNA ladder assays were carried out. First, to visualize the PLAGL2 accumulated in the cells after transfection of PLAGL2 cDNA, recombinant PLAGL2 was expressed in Escherichia coli and used to obtain antibodies in rabbits. Fig.1 shows immunoblot analysis of PLAGL2 with PLAGL2 cDNA-transfected Balb/c3T3 cells. The obtained anti-PLAGL2 reacted with a single protein corresponding to the molecular mass of 55 kDa in PLAGL2-expressing cells. PLAGL2 expressed was detected only in the nuclear fraction but not in the cytoplasmic fraction. Excess GST-PLAGL2 fusion protein completely blocked the binding of the antibody to PLAGL2, indicating that the antibody was specific for PLAGL2 protein. Indirect immunofluorescence observations also showed that PLAGL2 protein was found in the nucleus (Fig.2A), consistent with the nuclear localization reported in COS7 cells expressing hemagglutinin-tagged PLAGL2 (17Furukawa T. Adachi Y. Fujisawa J. Kambe T. Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Sasaki R. Kuwahara J. Ikehara S. Tokunaga R. Taketani S. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 4718-4727Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). As compared with control cells, BALB/c3T3 cells expressing PLAGL2 were clearly TUNEL-positive (Fig.2A). As expected, the DNA-laddering assay showed DNA to be fragmented in cells expressing PLAGL2 but not in control cells (Fig.2B). To estimate the G0/G1subpopulation as apoptotic cells, we performed PI staining, and the proportion of apoptotic cells of PLAGL2 cDNA-transfected Balb/c3T3 cells was analyzed by flow cytometry. As shown in Fig. 2C, the expression of PLAGL2 induced apoptosis, reaching 20.7% of total cells at 48 h after transfection. Early in apoptosis, phosphatidylserine is translocated from the inner to outer leaflet of the plasma membrane. Annexin V, a membrane-impermeable protein, binds phosphatidylserine on intact cells only if phosphatidylserine is present on the outer leaflet (29Fadock V.A. Voelker D.R. Campbell P.A. Cohen J.J. Bratton D.L. Henson P.M. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 2207-2216PubMed Google Scholar). The binding of fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled annexin V to the surface of the apoptotic cells was then examined. The binding was only observed on PLAGL2-expressing Balb/c3T3 cells. When PLAGL2 cDNA was transfected into Neuro2a cells by electroporation, apoptotic cells were also distinguished by the binding of annexin V to the cell surface as compared with the cells transfected with control pCG vector (Fig. 2D). TUNEL-positive Neuro2a and porcine epithelial LLC-PK1 cells were also observed following PLAGL2 cDNA transfection (data not shown). This series of experiments demonstrated that PLAGL2 expression in cells causes annexin V staining, an increase in the G0/G1 subpopulation, and DNA fragmentation, a series of events known to occur in cells undergoing apoptosis.Figure 2Apoptosis induced by expression of PLAGL2.

Balb/c3T3 and Neuro2a cells transfected with empty vector (upper panel) or pCG-PLAGL2 (lower panel) were cultured for 24 h.

Oncogene. 2001; 20: 4718-4727Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) previously reported that PLAGL2 mRNA was markedly expressed upon treatment of mouse cells with an iron chelator, desferrioxamine. The treatment of Balb/3T3 cells with 100 μm desferrioxamine resulted in an increase in PLAGL2 protein in the nucleus of most cells (Fig.3A). Little fluorescence was observed in untreated Balb/c3T3 cells. When Neuro2a cells were treated with 100 μm desferrioxamine for 24 h, an increase in PLAGL2 expression was also observed. PLAGL2 protein in desferrioxamine-treated Neuro2a cells was localized to the nucleus in some cells and to both the cytosol and nucleus in others (Fig.3A). Immunoblot analysis showed that PLAGL2 corresponding to a molecular mass of 55 kDa in Balb/c3T3 and Neuro2a cells was induced to express by the treatment with desferrioxamine (Fig. 3B). To examine whether the treatment with desferrioxamine induces programmed cell death, we assayed for TUNEL signaling, DNA laddering, PI staining, and annexin V binding. As shown in Fig. 3C, DNA laddering was found in both Balb/c3T3 and Neuro2a cells treated with 100 μm desferrioxamine for 72 h. TUNEL-positive Balb/c3T3 cells were also detected following the treatment with 100 μm desferrioxamine (data not shown). The G0/G1 subpopulation of Balb/c3T3 cells increased to be 9.9 and 14.4% by treatment with 50 and 100 μm desferrioxamine for 48 h, respectively (Fig.3D). When Neuro2a cells were treated with 50 and 100 μm desferrioxamine for 48 h, apoptotic cells were 25.7 and 30%, respectively. The binding of annexin V to the surface of desferrioxamine-treated Balb/c3T3 and Neuro2a cells (Fig.3E) was markedly increased. The percentage of these cells was positive for annexin V staining, reaching ∼40 and 65%, respectively, after 3 days of treatment. These results suggest that the expression of PLAGL2 plays an important role in the triggering of apoptosis. Nip3 has been shown to be expressed in a variety of cell and tissue types (21Bruick R.K.

In a transient expression assay, a 105-bp sugar response sequence (SRS) in the promoter of a sugar starvation highly inducible rice α-amylase gene,αAmy3, was shown previously to confer sugar response and to enhance the activity of the rice Act1 promoter in rice protoplasts. A 230-bp SRS-like sequence was also found in the promoter of another sugar starvation highly inducible rice α-amylase gene,αAmy8. The αAmy8 SRS contains a GA response sequence and was designated as αAmy8 SRS/GARS. In the present study, a transgenic approach was employed to characterize the function of the α-amylase gene SRSs in rice. We found that the αAmy3 SRS significantly enhances the endogenous expression pattern of the Act1 promoter in various rice tissues throughout their developmental stages. By contrast, the αAmy8 SRS/GARS significantly enhancesAct1 promoter activity only in embryos and endosperms of germinating rice seeds. A minimal promoter fused to theαAmy8 SRS/GARS is specifically active in rice embryo and endosperm and is subject to sugar repression and GA induction in rice embryos. This sugar repression was found to override GA induction of αAmy8 SRS/GARS activity. Our study demonstrates that the α-amylase transcriptional enhancers contain cis-acting elements capable of enhancing endogenous expression patterns or activating sugar-sensitive, hormone-responsive, tissue-specific, and developmental stage-dependent expression of promoters in transgenic rice. These enhancers may facilitate the design of highly active and tightly regulated composite promoters for monocot transformation and gene expression. Our study also reveals the existence of cross-talk between the sugar and GA signaling pathways in cereals and provides a system for analyzing the underlying molecular mechanisms involved.

Gubler F. Chandler P.M. Davies P.J. Plant Hormones: Physiology, Biochemistry, and Molecular Biology. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Norwell, MA1995: 247-271Google Scholar). During germination of cereal grains, the embryo synthesizes GA that diffuses to the aleurone cells and acts as a signal to activate the synthesis and secretion of α-amylases and other hydrolases. These enzymes digest the starch stored in the endosperm and provide sugars for the growth of young seedlings. We now know that expression of α-amylase genes is activated by sugar deprivation and repressed by sugar provision in cultured rice suspension cells (2.Yu S.M. Kuo Y.H. Sheu G. Sheu Y.J. Liu L.F. J.

The αAmy3 SRS contains three essential motifs: the GC box, the G box, and the TATCCA element (Fig. 1a) for a high level of sugar starvation-induced gene expression in rice protoplasts (11.Lu C.A.

All of the α-amylase genes isolated from rice, barley, and wheat contain a TATCCA element or its variants at the proximity of ∼90–150 bp, upstream of transcription start sites (6.Yu S.M. Shimamoto K. Molecular Biology of Rice. Springer-Verlag, Tokyo1999: 161-178Google Scholar). Mutations of the TATCCA element in the promoters of two barley α-amylase genes,Amy-pHV19 (12.Gubler F. Jacobsen J.V.

Plant Cell. 1992; 4: 203-211PubMed Google Scholar), lowered expression to about 20% of the wild-type sequence but maintained GA responsiveness in the barley aleurone. The TATCCA element is duplicated in the αAmy3 promoter, and mutation of each of the duplicated TATCCA elements also reduced the αAmy3 promoter activity to 12 and 8%, respectively, of the wild-type sequence but maintained sugar starvation inducibility in the rice protoplasts (11.Lu C.A.

One of the most important considerations in developing a plant transformation procedure is the availability of a promoter that provides a reliable high level expression of introduced genes in target cells or tissues. Monocot plants, particularly the cereal species, comprise an economically important group of plant species that could benefit from the introduction and expression of foreign genes that control agronomically important traits and overproduction of biomolecules. The rice Act1 promoter is one of the most frequently used highly active and constitutive promoters (14.Zhang W. McElroy D. Wu R. Plant Cell. 1991; 3: 1155-1165PubMed Google Scholar) in the establishment of transformation procedures and expression of foreign genes in rice and other monocots. Another constitutive promoter that is also commonly used for transformation of monocots is the maizeUbi promoter (15.Christensen A.H. Sharrock R.A. Quail P.H. Plant Mol. Biol. 1992; 18: 675-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (844) Google Scholar). In general, the maize Ubipromoter has slightly higher activity than the rice Act1promoter in various monocot species (16.McElroy D. Brettell R.I.S. Trends Biotechnol. 1994; 12: 62-68Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 17.Schledzewski K. Mendel R.R. Transgenic Res. 1994; 3: 249-255Crossref Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 18.Wilmink A. van de Ven B.C. Dons J.J. Plant Mol. Biol. 1995; 28: 949-955Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). However, we found that the maize Ubi and rice Act1 promoters frequently do not lead to a high level of foreign gene expression in transgenic rice. Various strategies can be employed to increase the activity of constitutive promoters in transformed cereals (16.McElroy D. Brettell R.I.S. Trends Biotechnol. 1994; 12: 62-68Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 18.Wilmink A. van de Ven B.C. Dons J.J. Plant Mol. Biol. 1995; 28: 949-955Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). One strategy is to add an enhancer element that increases the transcription of a promoter. In plants, extra copies of enhancer elements can enhance the activity of a homologous promoter, e.g. the anaerobic responsive element to the maize Adh1 promoter (19.Olive M.R. Walker J.C. Singh K. Dennis E.S. Peacock W.J. Plant Mol. Biol. 1990; 15: 593-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Multiple copies of enhancer elements have also been employed to enhance the activity of a heterologous promoter, e.g. the octopine synthase enhancer from Agrobacterium tumefaciens to the maize Adh1 promoter (20.Ellis J.G. Llewellyn D.J. Walker J.C. Dennis E.S. Peacock W.J. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 3203-3208Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Previously, we found that insertion of three tandem copies of the rice αAmy3 SRS in the Act1 promoter significantly enhances the promoter activity in rice protoplasts in a dose-dependent manner (11.Lu C.A. Lim E.K. Yu S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10120-10131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Unlike the αAmy3 SRS, SRSs in promoters of other sugar starvation-inducible genes have not been extensively characterized. Previously, we showed that the GC box and TATCCA element are both present in the promoter of αAmy8 but that only the TATCCA element is present in the promoter of a sucrose deprivation lowly inducible rice α-amylase gene, αAmy7 (11.Lu C.A. Lim E.K. Yu S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10120-10131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). In the present study, we demonstrate that the α-amylase transcriptional enhancers contain cis-acting elements capable of enhancing the endogenous expression pattern or activating high level sugar-sensitive, hormone-dependent, and tissue-specific expression of promoters in transgenic rice. The present study also shows that sugar suppresses the GA responsiveness of αAmy8 SRS/GARS, thereby suggesting an interaction between the sugar and GA signaling pathways. The rice variety used in this study wasOryza sativa L. cv. Tainung 67. Immature seeds were dehulled, sterilized with 3% NaOCl for 30 min, washed extensively with sterile water, and placed on N6D agar medium (41.Toki S. Plant Mol. Biol. Rep. 1997; 5: 16-21Crossref Scopus (304) Google Scholar) for callus induction. After 1 month, calli derived from scutellum were subcultured in fresh N6D medium for transformation. For construction of the plasmid containing the Act1-Luc chimeric gene, the EcoRI site in the multiple cloning sites of pBluescript SKII+ (Stratagene) was first removed by digestion with EcoRI and then blunt-ended and re-ligated. The rice Act1 5′ region (including 1.4-kb 5′-flanking sequence, 79-bp 5′ noncoding exon, 447-bp 5′ intron, and 25-bp first coding exon) was excised from pDM302 (42.Cao J. Duan X. McElroy D. Wu R. Plant Cell Rep. 1992; 11: 586-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar) with HindIII and subcloned into the same site in pBluescript, which lacked the EcoRI site to generate pAct. The αAmy3 SRS (−186 to −82 relative to the transcription start site of αAmy3) was PCR-amplified using oligonucleotides 5′-CCCGAATTCATCCCGTCGCCTTGGAGA-3′ (EcoRI site underlined) as the 5′ primer and 5′-CCCGAATTCAGAGACGACAATAAT-3′ (EcoRI site underlined) as the 3′ primer and p3G-132II (11.Lu C.A. Lim E.K. Yu S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10120-10131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), which contains the 1.7-kb 5′ region of αAmy3, as the DNA template. The DNA fragment containing the SRS was digested with EcoRI and inserted into the EcoRI site (−459 relative to the transcription start site) of the Act1 promoter in three tandem repeats in the correct orientation to generate pACT-3SRS. ASalI-BglII fragment containing the Luccoding sequence-Nos terminator fusion was excised form pJD312 (43.Luehrsen K.R. de Wet J.R. Walbot V. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 216: 397-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), blunt-ended, and inserted into the SmaI site of pAct and pAct-3SRS to generate pB-Act-LN and pB-Act-3SRS-LN. pB-Act-LN and pB-Act-3SRS-LN were linearized with PstI and inserted into the same site in the binary vector pSMY1H (39.Ho S.L. Tong W.F. Yu S.M. Plant Physiol. 2000; 122: 57-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), which contains the 35S promoter Hph coding region tumor morphology large gene (Tml) terminator fusion gene, thereby generating pAct-LN and pAct-3SRS-LN. Plasmids pAct-LN and pAct-SRS-LN were introduced into A. tumefaciens strain EHA101 (44.Hood E.E. Helmer G.L. Fraley R.T. Chilton M.D. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 168: 1291-1301Crossref PubMed Scopus (763) Google Scholar) with an electroporator (BTX, San Diego, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Calli induced from immature rice seeds were co-cultured with A. tumefaciens, and putative transgenic plants were regenerated from calli according to the methods described by Hieiet al. (36.Hiei Y. Ohta S. Komari T. Kumashiro T. Plant J. 1994; 6: 271-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (2848) Google Scholar) and Toki (41.Toki S. Plant Mol. Biol. Rep. 1997; 5: 16-21Crossref Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Transformed calli were propagated as described previously (2.Yu S.M. Kuo Y.H. Sheu G. Sheu Y.J. Liu L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21131-21137Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Established suspension cells were subcultured as described previously (11.Lu C.A. Lim E.K. Yu S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10120-10131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Total proteins were extracted from cultured suspension cells or plant tissues with a CCLR buffer (100 mm KH2(PO4), pH 7.8, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 7 mmβ-mercaptoethanol), and the protein concentration was determined with a Coomassie protein assay reagent (Pierce). Luciferase activity assay was performed as described previously (11.Lu C.A. Lim E.K. Yu S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10120-10131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Previously, we showed in a protoplast transient expression assay that insertion of three copies of theαAmy3 SRS at position 459 bp upstream of the transcription start site of an 846-bp Act1 promoter significantly enhancedAct1 promoter activity (11.Lu C.A. Lim E.K. Yu S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10120-10131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). To determine whether similar results could be produced in stably transformed rice cells, the firefly luciferase gene (Luc) was fused downstream of theAct1 promoter or the Act1 promoter containing three tandem copies of αAmy3 SRS, generatingAct1-Luc and Act1-3SRS-Luc, and the resulted chimeric genes (Fig. 2) were introduced into the rice genome via Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. Several transformed cell lines were obtained, and four lines for each construct were randomly selected for further study. The transformed calli were cultured as suspension cells. These cells were then cultured in medium with or without sucrose for 2 days prior to luciferase assay. The luciferase activity conferred by the wild-typeAct1 promoter was very low in sucrose-starved cells and was 6- to 8-fold less than in sucrose-provided cells (Fig. 3). By contrast, the luciferase activity conferred by the Act1-3SRS promoter increased dramatically in sucrose-starved cells to ∼2–5.5-fold of that in sucrose-provided cells (Fig. 3). Notably, the Act1-3SRS promoter conferred significantly higher luciferase activity regardless of whether cells were cultured with or without sucrose. These results suggest that in stably transformed rice suspension cells, expression of luciferase is significantly enhanced by integration of the αAmy3 SRS into the Act1 promoter. Additionally, the αAmy3SRS converts the sugar-inducible Act1 promoter into a sugar starvation-inducible promoter.Figure 3The αAmy3 SRS enhancesAct1 promoter activity in transformed rice suspension cells. Transformed rice suspension cells carrying theAct1-Luc gene or the Act1-3SRS-Lucgene were cultured in the presence of sucrose (+ sucrose, open bar) or absence of sucrose (− sucrose, filled bar) for 2 days. Cells were collected, and luciferase activity was determined from four independently transformed rice cell lines for each construct.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To determine whether integration of theαAmy3 SRS into the Act1 promoter enhances expression of luciferase in transgenic rice plants, transformed calli carrying Act1-Luc and Act1-3SRS-Lucchimeric genes were regenerated and then self-fertilized for three generations to obtain T3 homozygous seeds. The homozygosity of transgenic seeds was determined by the germinating 25 transgenic seeds in water containing 50 μg/ml hygromycin for 7 days and then calculating the ratio between the number of growing and non-growing seedlings. Theoretically, seeds of a transgenic line homozygous for the transgene should all germinate and grow under these conditions. T3 homozygous seeds of four transgenic lines carrying Act1-Lucand eight transgenic lines carrying Act1-3SRS-Lucwere germinated and grown for 8 days. Leaves were collected from seedlings and assayed for luciferase activity. The luciferase activity was not significantly different in the leaves of all transgenic lines carrying the same construct. The average luciferase activity conferred by the Act1-3SRS promoter in different transformants was similar: ∼2.5- to 3-fold higher than that conferred by theAct1 promoter (Fig. 4). These results indicate that the αAmy3 SRS generally enhancesAct1 promoter activity in transgenic rice. To determine whether the Act1-3SRS chimeric promoter enhances expression of luciferase in different tissues of germinating seeds and seedlings, T3 homozygous seeds of transgenic lines Act 6-9-1 and Act(3SRS) 5-15-1 were germinated and grown for 2 weeks. Various tissues were collected and assayed for luciferase activity. The Act1-3SRS promoter conferred higher luciferase activity than the Act1 promoter in various tissues of germinating seeds and seedlings (Fig. 5). The difference in enhancement of luciferase activity was most dramatic in roots (5- to 56-fold) and next in shoots (4- to 11-fold) and embryos (3- to 18-fold). The luciferase activity in various organs conferred by both the Act1 andAct1-3SRS promoters peaked within 7–8 days after germination and declined thereafter. To determine the luciferase expression pattern under control of theAct1-3SRS promoter in seedlings and older plants, T3 homozygous seeds of transgenic lines Act 6-9-1 and Act(3SRS) 5-15-1 were germinated and grown for 8 weeks. Various tissues were collected and assayed for luciferase activity. The Act1-3SRS promoter conferred significantly higher luciferase activity than theAct1 promoter in various tissues of transgenic rice plants (Fig. 6a). The difference in enhancement of luciferase activity was highest in root (7- to 38-fold), next highest in leaf (5- to 20-fold), and lowest in sheath (4- to 7-fold). The total luciferase activity in the leaf, sheath, and root of transgenic seedlings or plants as described in Fig. 6a was calculated and compared (Fig. 6b). The data shown in Figs. 5 and 6 demonstrate that the luciferase activity in transgenic rice, conferred by both the Act1 andAct1-3SRS promoters, fluctuates in a developmental stage-dependent manner. The luciferase activity in various tissues reached its first peak within 1 week after germination, reached its lowest level at week 2 or 3, and rose again at week 4. To determine whether growth conditions affect the efficacy of theαAmy3 SRS in enhancing Act1 promoter activity, T3 homozygous seeds of transgenic lines Act 6-9-1 and Act(3SRS) 5-15-1 were allowed to germinate and grow in the dark or in a 12-h light/12-h dark cycle for 12 days. Leaves of transgenic rice seedlings were collected and assayed for luciferase activity. The luciferase activity conferred by the Act1-3SRS promoter was significantly higher than that conferred by the Act1 promoter, regardless of whether seedlings were grown in the dark or under the light/dark cycle condition (Fig. 7). The luciferase expression in leaves of seedlings grown under light/dark cycles was also higher than in leaves grown in the dark within the first week after germination regardless of whether or not the Act1promoter contained the αAmy3 SRS. The rice α-amylases are encoded by a multigene family (21.Thomas B.R. Rodriguez R.L. Plant Physiol. 1994; 106: 1235-1239Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). In the present study, we first compared the expression patterns of the α-amylase genes in various rice tissues to understand how they are regulated. As shown in Fig. 8, the α-amylase genes are differentially expressed in rice suspension cells and germinated seeds. Although expression of all the α-amylase genes was enhanced by sugar starvation, the magnitude of enhancement varied from gene to gene (Fig. 8, compare lane 1 with lane 2). All α-amylase genes were barely expressed in shoots and roots, but most of them were expressed in endosperms and embryos of germinated rice seeds. Both αAmy3 and αAmy8were highly expressed in sucrose-starved cells; however, onlyαAmy8 was highly expressed in endosperms. These results indicate that αAmy3 and αAmy8 are coordinately regulated by sugar in rice suspension cells but differentially regulated, presumably by GA, in germinating seeds. This expression of α-amylase genes is regulated by GA at the transcription level in endosperm (22.Jacobsen J.V. Beach L.R. Nature. 1985; 316: 275-277Crossref Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 23.Zwar J.V. Hooley R. Plant Physiol. 1986; 80: 459-463Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and by sugars in rice suspension cells (8.Chan M.T. Chao Y.C. Yu S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17635-17641Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,9.Sheu J.J. Jan S.P. Lee H.T. Yu S.M. Plant J. 1994; 5: 655-664Crossref Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The coordinated and differential regulation could be due to the presence of conserved or distinct regulatory elements in theαAmy3 and αAmy8 promoters. We therefore compared the cis-acting elements in the two promoters. The rice αAmy8 promoter was shown previously to drive sucrose starvation-induced expression of a reporter gene in rice suspension cells (8.Chan M.T. Chao Y.C. Yu S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17635-17641Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Sequence analysis revealed that theαAmy8 promoter contains a 31-bp GC box at positions −266 to −236 and a TATCCA element at positions −131 to −126 upstream of the transcription site (Fig. 1a). The nucleotide sequences of the αAmy3 and αAmy8 GC boxes are highly homologous (Fig. 1b). The 230-bp αAmy8SRS/GARS, which encompasses positions −318 to −89 of theαAmy8 promoter, contains the GC box and TATCCA element (Fig. 1a). Between the GC box and the TATCCA element, two additional sequences homologous to the c-Myb-binding site (24.Nakagoshi H. Nagase T. Kanei-Ishii C. Ueno Y. Ishii S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3479-3483Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and GARE (25.Gubler F. Raventos D. Keys M. Watts R. Mundy J. Jacobsen J.V. Plant J. 1999; 17: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar) are present in the αAmy8 SRS/GARS but are absent in the αAmy3 SRS. To test whether the αAmy8SRS/GARS may also serve as an enhancer, this sequence was also inserted at position −459 of the Act1 promoter and tested for its effect on Act1 promoter activity in transgenic rice. The patterns of luciferase expression conferred by theAct1-3SRS and Act1-8SRS/GARS chimeric promoters (Fig. 2) in various tissues of transgenic rice seedlings were compared. T3 homozygous seeds of transgenic lines Act 6-9-1, Act(3SRS) 5-15-1, and Act(8SRS/GARS) 5 were germinated and grown for 8 days. Various tissues of seedlings were collected and assayed for luciferase activity. As shown in Fig. 9, theαAmy3 SRS enhanced Act1 promoter activity significantly in embryos, shoots, and roots, whereas theαAmy8 SRS/GARS enhanced Act1 promoter activity mainly in endosperms and embryos of germinated seeds and seedlings. Since theαAmy8 SRS/GARS enhanced Act1 promoter activity in the endosperm and embryo of germinated seeds and seedlings, we next wished to determine whether the αAmy8 SRS/GARS itself confers tissue-specific activity to a minimal promoter. TheαAmy8 SRS/GARS was fused upstream of theCaMV35S minimal promoter-Luc fusion gene (Fig. 2), which was then introduced into the rice genome. Several transgenic rice lines were obtained, and the T2 seeds of one randomly selected line, T4-12, were germinated for 6 days. Various tissues of germinated seeds were collected, and luciferase activity was assayed. As shown in Fig. 10, when compared with the activity in roots, the luciferase activity in endosperms and embryos was 74- and 20-fold, respectively. The activity in shoots was similar to that in roots. These findings show that theαAmy8 SRS/GARS confers endosperm- and embryo-specific activity to a minimal promoter in germinated transgenic rice seeds. αAmy8 was expressed in sucrose-starved cells and endosperms, suggesting that the αAmy8 promoter likely contains regulatory sequences responsible for sugar and GA responses. We decided to determine whether the αAmy8SRS/GARS confers the sugar and GA responsiveness to a minimal promoter. Embryos collected from rice seeds pretreated with 2,4-D have been shown to respond to exogenously applied sugar (26.Umemura T. Perata P. Futsuhara Y. Yamaguchi J. Planta. 1998; 204: 420-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Therefore, the same batch of T2 seeds from transgenic line T4-12 used in the experiment described in Fig. 10 was pretreated with 2,4-D for 8 days. Embryos were collected and divided into four groups. Each group of embryos was incubated with or without sucrose plus or minus GA for 2 days, and luciferase activity was assayed. As shown in Fig. 11a, in the presence of sucrose, luciferase activity in embryos was relatively low regardless of whether GA was present or not. In the absence of both sucrose and GA, luciferase activity in embryos increased significantly by 5.5-fold. The addition of GA in the absence of sucrose enhanced luciferase activity by 8.2-fold. Embryos of T1 seeds from transgenic line T4-12 were removed in order to cut off the source of GA. The endosperms were then divided into four groups. Each group of endosperms was incubated with or without sucrose plus or minus GA for 2 days, and luciferase activity was assayed. As shown in Fig. 11b, in the absence of GA, the luciferase activity in endosperms was low regardless of whether sucrose was present or not. In the presence of both GA and sucrose, the luciferase activity in endosperms increased by 4-fold, and the removal of sucrose did not alter the luciferase activity. These results demonstrate that the αAmy8 SRS/GARS confers GA responsiveness to a minimal promoter in both rice embryos and endosperms. The availability of a promoter that provides reliable high level expression of introduced genes in target cells is an important issue in plant transformation. The maizeAdh1 promoter, developed as an important promoter for monocot transformation, has low activity in monocots. A comb"

A length-dependent bias for expansions is observed in humans affected by a trinucleotide repeat-associated disease. We developed an assay to test the effect of replication direction on (CTG)·(CAG) instabilities incurred during <i>in vitro</i> (SV40) DNA replication mediated by human cell extracts. This system recapitulates the bias for expansions observed in humans. Replication by HeLa cell extracts generated expansions and deletions that depended upon repeat tract length and the direction of replication. Templates with 79 repeats yielded predominantly expansions (CAG as lagging strand template) or predominantly deletions (CTG as lagging strand template). Templates containing 17 repeats were stable. Thus, replication direction determined the type of mutation. These results provide new insights into the orientation of replication effect upon repeat stability. This system will be useful in determining the contribution of specific human proteins to (CTG)·(CAG) expansions."
https://openalex.org/W2036259193,"The horseshoe crab factor G, a heterodimeric serine protease zymogen, is activated by (1-->3)-beta-D-glucan on fungal cell walls. The activation initiates the hemolymph-clotting cascade, a critical reaction for the defense against microorganisms. In the present study, we identified the domain responsible for the glucan recognition by factor G and characterized its interaction with (1-->3)-beta-d-glucan and its derivatives. Among three domains in subunit alpha of factor G, identified as the glucan-binding domain, was the COOH-terminal xylanase Z-like domain composed of two tandem-repeating units, each of which exhibits sequence similarities to the cellulose-binding domains of bacterial xylanases. Each of the single units bound to the glucan with lower affinities, and the association constant increased two orders with the tandem-repeating structure (K(a) = 8.0 x 10(8) m(-1)). In addition to longer glucans, (1-->3)-beta-D-glucan oligosaccharides incapable of activating factor G bound also to factor G and competitively inhibited the zymogen activation. The minimum structure required for the binding was a (1-->3)-beta-d-glucan disaccharide, indicating that conformation-dependent structures are not essential for the recognition. Therefore, increasing avidity by multivalent binding sites with low affinities to simple structures on biologically active polymers may be one of the principles that allows stable and specific recognition of pathogens by pattern recognition receptors in innate immunity."

Induction by the chemicals initiates the viral lytic life cycle of KSHV in PEL-derived B cells, with the accumulation of progeny virus in culture medium (18.Renne R. Zhong W. Herndier B. McGrath M. Abbey N. Kedes D. Ganem D. Nat. Med. 1996; 2: 342-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (920) Google Scholar, 20.Cannon J.S. Ciufo D. Hawkins A.L. Griffin C.A. Borowitz M.J. Hayward G.S. Ambinder R.F. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 10187-10193Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Although KSHV gene expression studies remain controversial, a number of studies, based on transcription kinetics, have classified KSHV genes into three categories during lytic infection induced by chemicals. These include immediate-early genes, early genes, and late genes (21.Sun R. Lin S.F. Staskus K. Gradoville L. Grogan E. Haase A. Miller G. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 2232-2242Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22.Lin S.F. Robinson D.R. Miller G. Kung H.J. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 1909-1917Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). More recently, Jenner et al. (7.Jenner R.G. Alba M.M. Boshoff C. Kellam P. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 891-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar) clustered the lytic genes as primary (0–10 h), secondary (10–24 h), and tertiary (48–72 h) lytic genes according to its expression pattern by DNA arrays. A typical immediate-early gene is the KSHV ORF50 (Rta) that is expressed at 4 h of butyrate induction and is resistant to cycloheximide inhibition. An early gene is defined by its expression after 8–20 h of chemical induction and its being sensitive to cycloheximide but resistant to antiviral drugs such as phosphonoacetic acid (PAA). KSHV genes encoding K3, K5, K8, vIL6, vMIPs, vGCR, vDHFR, and viral thymidylate synthase belong to this group. Late genes differ from early genes by their absence prior to 24 h of chemical induction and by their sensitivity to PAA. These include KSHV ORF65 and several viral envelope glycoproteins such as K8.1 (21.Sun R. Lin S.F. Staskus K. Gradoville L. Grogan E. Haase A. Miller G. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 2232-2242Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although the molecular events in correlation with each category gene during KSHV lytic infection are just beginning to be understood, considerable evidence indicates that expression of each category gene is coordinately regulated and sequentially ordered in a cascade fashion in a viral lytic life cycle. A KSHV locus encompassing ORF50 (Rta), K8, and K8.1 extends for about 5,400 nts at map position ∼0.43–0.46 of the virus genome. Although the three genes are positioned in the virus genome side by side, they, respectively, belong to three different categories of genes involved in different stages of viral lytic cycle. KSHV Rta gene is an immediate-early gene and expresses a homolog to EBV Rta that mediates transcription of several early genes including the K8, ORF57, K2 (vIL6), and PAN RNA (23.Sun R. Lin S.F. Gradoville L. Yuan Y. Zhu F. Miller G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10866-10871Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar, 24.Lukac D.M. Kirshner J.R. Ganem D. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 9348-9361Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A recent report (25.Lukac D.M. Garibyan L. Kirshner J.R. Palmeri D. Ganem D. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 6786-6799Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) indicates that interaction of the N terminus of KSHV Rta with a 12-bp binding site, AACAATAATGTT, in both K8 and ORF57 promoters is necessary for transcriptional activation. Thus, expression of KSHV Rta is essential for lytic viral reactivation. The K8 gene is an early gene encoding a basic-leucine zipper (bZIP) protein called K-bZIP (22.Lin S.F. Robinson D.R. Miller G. Kung H.J. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 1909-1917Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26.Gruffat H. Portes-Sentis S. Sergeant A. Manet E. J. Gen.

The K-bZIP protein is also a homolog to EBV Zta, a transcriptional activator that plays a crucial role in the initiation of the EBV lytic cascade. Accumulated data show that KSHV K-bZIP is a nuclear protein probably related to viral DNA replication (27.Zhu F.X. Cusano T. Yuan Y. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 5556-5567Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28.Portes-Sentis S. Manet E. Gourru G. Sergeant A. Gruffat H. J. Gen.

Virol. 1999; 73: 1909-1917Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and undergoes extensive phosphorylation by cyclin-dependent kinase (30.Polson A.G. Huang L. Lukac D.M. Blethrow J.D. Morgan D.O. Burlingame A.L. Ganem D. J.

Virology. 2001; 286: 446-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) implies its roles in initiation of viral transcription and DNA replication. Evidence of the K-bZIP repressing transcription through interaction with p53 and CREB-binding protein further supports such a notion (31.Katano H. Ogawa-Goto K. Hasegawa H. Kurata T. Sata T. Virology. 2001; 286: 446-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 32.Park J. Seo T. Hwang S. Lee D. Gwack Y. Choe J. J.

KSHV K8.1 gene is a late gene encoding two related glycoproteins, K8.1A and K8.1B (34.Chandran B. Bloomer C. Chan S.R. Zhu L. Goldstein E. Horvat R. Virology. 1998; 249: 140-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 35.Raab M.S. Albrecht J.C. Birkmann A. Yaguboglu S. Lang D. Fleckenstein B. Neipel F. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 6725-6731Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 36.Li M. MacKey J. Czajak S.C. Desrosiers R.C. Lackner A.A. Jung J.U. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 1341-1349Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The K8.1A and -B have identical amino acid sequences in both N terminus and C terminus but differ at the central domain because of alternative RNA splicing. The K8.1 A (gp35–37) is a viral envelop protein interacting with cellular receptors heparan sulfate-like moieties (37.Wang F.Z. Akula S.M. Pramod N.P. Zeng L. Chandran B. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 7517-7527Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). However, function of the K8.1B remains unknown. Structural, functional, and expression analysis of individual viral genes have demonstrated that KSHV Rta, K8, and K8.1 genes share a common polyadenylation signal at nt 76714 downstream of the K8.1 coding region. KSHV Rta and K8 transcribe their RNAs from two separate promoters (22.Lin S.F. Robinson D.R. Miller G. Kung H.J. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 1909-1917Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24.Lukac D.M. Kirshner J.R. Ganem D. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 9348-9361Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30.Polson A.G. Huang L. Lukac D.M. Blethrow J.D. Morgan D.O. Burlingame A.L. Ganem D. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 3175-3184Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), whereas the K8.1 promoter and its transcription start site remain unknown. As a result, a pre-mRNA transcribed from the Rta promoter overlaps the K8 and K8.1 coding regions and thus is tricistronic with 5 exons and 4 introns. However, a pre-mRNA transcribed from the K8 promoter only overlaps the K8.1 coding region and thus is bicistronic with 4 exons and 3 introns. Chen et al. (38.Chen J. Ueda K. Sakakibara S. Okuno T. Parravicini C. Corbellino M. Yamanishi K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4119-4124Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) recently showed that the Rta promoter p71560 is heavily methylated in latently infected cells, and demethylation of the Rta promoter by TPA treatment induces the KSHV lytic life cycle. KSHV K8 promoter p74845 identified by Lin et al. (22.Lin S.F. Robinson D.R. Miller G. Kung H.J. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 1909-1917Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) has an Rta-binding site and can be directly activated by Rta (25.Lukac D.M. Garibyan L. Kirshner J.R. Palmeri D. Ganem D. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 6786-6799Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). It has been documented that maturation of both Rta and K8 mRNAs undergoes extensive alternative splicing which leads to the generation of three spliced forms of the mRNAs (α, β, and γ) (22.Lin S.F. Robinson D.R. Miller G. Kung H.J. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 1909-1917Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27.Zhu F.X. Cusano T. Yuan Y. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 5556-5567Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30.Polson A.G. Huang L. Lukac D.M. Blethrow J.D. Morgan D.O. Burlingame A.L. Ganem D. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 3175-3184Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In each case, a 3′-terminal intron is excluded from all isoforms of both Rta and K8. The KSHV K8.1 gene shares the 3′-terminal exon with Rta and K8 but utilizes a 3′-terminal intron of the Rta and K8 as its own coding region, which is also alternatively spliced to the same 3′-terminal exon of the Rta and K8 by using two alternative 5′-splice sites (ss) and subsequently produces the following two spliced mRNAs: K8.1α and K8.1β (34.Chandran B. Bloomer C. Chan S.R. Zhu L. Goldstein E. Horvat R. Virology. 1998; 249: 140-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 35.Raab M.S. Albrecht J.C. Birkmann A. Yaguboglu S. Lang D. Fleckenstein B. Neipel F. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 6725-6731Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). RNA K8.1γ is the one left unspliced. Altogether, these findings suggest that alternative promoter usage and alternative splicing of the three primary transcripts are cascaded and play important roles in KSHV lytic reactivation. We are interested in regulation of KSHV RNA splicing in the virus life cycle. The structures of Rta, K8, and K8.1 pre-mRNAs and their sophisticated splicing provide an ideal model for understanding how a viral pre-mRNA recruits cellular splicing machinery to define its splice sites for removal of an unwanted intron. Our initial approach focuses on a 3′-terminal intron because it involves the processing of all three transcripts Rta, K8, and K8.1. Because of complexity of their RNA structures and splicing, however, we simplify our focus on description only on K8 and K8.1 RNAs for better understanding in this report. Here we provide evidence that 5′ part of the K8 terminal intron is part of the K8 exon 3 (Rta exon 4) which extends to include two additional 5′-ss being used for splicing of the K8.1 pre-mRNA. Alternative selection of three 5′-ss in the K8 exon 3 results in several novel forms of bicistronic K8/K8.1 mRNAs. In addition, we also demonstrate that transcription of late K8.1 RNA is initiated at nt 75901, 14 nts upstream of the first AUG at nt 75915 in KSHV genome. Human 293 cell was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA) and was maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% inactivated fetal bovine serum (HyClone), 2 mml-glutamine, 100 units penicillin/ml, and 100 μg streptomycin/ml at 37 °C under a 5% CO2. The KSHV-positive B cell line JSC-1 cells (PEL-derived, coinfected with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)) (20.Cannon J.S. Ciufo D. Hawkins A.L. Griffin C.A. Borowitz M.J. Hayward G.S. Ambinder R.F. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 10187-10193Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) was a generous gift from Dr. Richard Ambinder (The Johns Hopkins University), and the BCP-1 cell line (KSHV+, EBV−) (CRL-2294) was purchased from ATCC. Both cell lines were maintained at 37 °C in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen) containing 2 mml-glutamine, 100 units of penicillin/ml, 100 μg of streptomycin/ml, and 10 (JSC-1 cells) or 20% (CBP-1 cells) fetal bovine serum in the presence of 5% CO2. For chemical activation of cells, sodium butyrate (Aldrich) was added to a final concentration of 3 mm (27.Zhu F.X. Cusano T. Yuan Y. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 5556-5567Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and incubated for 24 h or at indicated time points as described in each figure. To inhibit butyrate-induced KSHV DNA replication, JSC-1 cells were simultaneously treated with PAA (0.4 mm) and butyrate (3 mm) for 48 h (21.Sun R. Lin S.F. Staskus K. Gradoville L. Grogan E. Haase A. Miller G. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 2232-2242Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For anti-IgM activation, JSC-1 cells at 1 × 107, after three washes with serum-free RPMI 1640, were resuspended in 1 ml of serum-free RPMI 1640, incubated with 10 μg of anti-human IgM at 37 °C for 30 min, and then fed with 9 ml of RPMI 1640 with 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C in the presence of 5% CO2 for another 30 min. Total cell RNA was extracted by TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instruction. The poly(A)+ mRNAs was isolated with Oligotex mRNA isolation mini kit (Qiagen). Following DNase I digestion, 1 μg of total RNA or 0.2 μg poly(A)+ mRNA was reverse-transcribed at 42 °C for 1 h using random hexamers and then amplified by PCR with AmpliTaq DNA polymerase (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) using different pairs of primers as described in each figure. The followings are the primer sequences named by the locations of their 5′ ends: Pr75183 (oST1, 5′-TAATACGACTCACTATAGGGA/CCACCAAGAGGACCACACATTTC-3′), Pr75864 (oST2, 5′-GCTGCCGGATAACAATTCCTTC-3′), Pr75838 (oST3, 5′-GTACTCACCCC/CACACAAAGTCTGGCATGGTTCTCCC-3′), Pr76576 (oST31, 5′-TGTAGTGCGCGTCTCTTCCTC-3′), Pr75679 (oST35, 5′-TAGCGGCGAGATTGGAGGCA-3′), Pr75605 (oST36, 5′-CTCAAATGGGAACAATGGCG-3′), Pr76448/76155 (oST37, 5′-CCAGATGAATATGATC/CTGAAA-3′), Pr76448/76338 (oST38, 5′-CCAGATGAATATGATC/TCGACG-3′), and Pr75936 (oST39, 5′-AGAAATCCCTGTGGCGCTCC-3′). All RT-PCR products amplified from JSC-1 cell total RNA were gel-purified and confirmed by sequencing through splicing junctions. The radioactive antisense RNA probes were prepared by in vitro transcription in the presence of [α-32P]GTP from XbaI-linearized plasmid pST22 DNA templates or from template DNAs prepared by PCR using an antisense chimeric T7/KSHV primer, Pr76136 (oST46, 5′-TAATACGACTCACTATAGGGA/TAGTCTGGTCCCGTTTAGG-3′) combined with a sense primer Pr75679 or Pr75843 (oST44, 5′-GAAGGAATTGTTATCCGGCAGC-3′) for the experiment in Fig. 1, or using a sense primer Pr75605 combined with an antisense chimeric T7/KSHV primer Pr75935 (oST33, 5′-TAATACGACTCACTATAGG/GCGAATCTGTGTGGAACTCA-3′) for the experiments in Fig. 2, D and E. Human cyclophilin antisense [32P]RNA probe prepared from a DNA template from Ambion was used as an internal control. Three nanograms of each probe (specific activity 35,000 cpm/ng) was hybridized overnight to 15 μg of total JSC-1 RNA in hybridization buffer and then followed by RNase digestion with RPA III™ kit (Ambion) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Protected RNA fragments were separated by using a 6% polyacrylamide gel containing 8 m urea. Autoradiographic data captured with a Molecular Dynamic PhosphorImager Storm 860 were analyzed with ImageQuant software. A sequence reaction of pUC19 was also performed with a forward primer (5′-GTTTTCCCAGTCACGACGTTGTA-3′) and used as a sequencing ladder for sizing.Figure 2Identification of KSHV K8 mRNAs with intron 3 retention in JSC-1 cells.

The32P-labeled primer Pr75986 (oST64, 5′-GCACGCCACCAGACAAAGG-3′) was used for both primer extension and KSHV DNA sequencing to determine where the extended products were terminated. The primer extension products were analyzed along sequencing reactions on an 8% denaturing polyacrylamide gel. To construct an expression vector containing both K8 and K8.1 genes (pST1), a 1.8-kb DNA fragment was amplified from total JSC-1 DNA by PCR using a primer Pr74850 (oST41, 5′-CACC/ATGCCCAGAATGAAGGAC-3′) combined with an antisense primer Pr76687 (oST42, 5′- TCC/AGGGTTTCTTACGCCG-3′). The amplified DNA fragment was inserted into an expression vector pcDNA3.1D/V5-His-TOPO (Invitrogen) at a polylinker region downstream of a CMV promoter. Plasmid pST22 containing an inverted KSHV fragment (nt 76136 to 75679) for the RPA assay in Fig. 1 Cwas constructed by inserting into the same expression vector a fragment amplified by PCR using a primer pair of Pr75679 and Pr76136b (oST80, 5′-CACC/TAGTCTGGTCCCGTTTAGG-3′). To construct the plasmid (pST2) with a U to G mutation at 75838 5′-ss, a high fidelity PCRTaq enzyme (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was used for overlapping PCR (39.Zheng Z.M. Reid E.S. Baker C.C. J.

Two primer sets, Pr74850 and Pr75857 (oST49, 5′- GATAACAATTCCTTCTTCCCACACAAAGTCTGGC-3′) as well as Pr75824 (oST48, 5′-GCCAGACTTTGTGTGGGAAGAAGGAATTGTTATC-3′) and Pr76687, were utilized to amplify PCR fragments, respectively. The amplified PCR products from each set of the primers were mixed and re-amplified using a primer set of Pr74850 and Pr76687. Following gel purification, the PCR fragment with a U to G mutation at 75838 5′-ss was inserted into the expression vector pcDNA3.1D/V5-His-TOPO as described above. The same strategy was used to create plasmid pST5 derived from plasmid pST2 by overlapping PCR using two other primer sets, Pr74850 and Pr76180 (oST57, 5′-GATACGGAGACATTTGGATTGTCATTCGACGGAGAT-3′) and Pr76145 (oST56, 5′-ACTCCGTCGAATGACAATCCAAATGTCTCCGTATC-3′) and Pr76687. The individual PCR products were then mixed, re-amplified by using a primer set of Pr74850 and Pr76687, and cloned into the same expression vector. The resulting plasmid pST5 had mutations in two 5′-ss, respectively, at nt 75838 (GU to GG) and at nt 76155 (GUGAGU toAUGACA). All mutations described in plasmids pST2 and pST5 were verified by sequencing. To construct a K8β cDNA plasmid (pST3), the RT-PCR fragment corresponding to K8β amplified from the JSC-1 total RNA using the primer set Pr74850 and Pr76687 was cloned. Plasmid pST6 was derived from plasmid pST1 by deletion of the CMV promoter with BamHI and SpeI. LipofectAMINE™ 2000 (Invitrogen) was used to transfect 2 μg of plasmid DNA into 293 cells according to the manufacturer's instructions. Total cellular RNA was extracted from the transfected cells after 24 h.

These cleavage complexes can accumulate in the presence of damaged DNA or anticancer drugs that either intercalate or lie in the minor groove. Recently we reported that covalent diol epoxide (DE) adducts of benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) at the exocyclic amino group of G(+1) block cleavage at a preferred cleavage site (∼CTT—G(+1)G(+2)A∼) and cause accumulation of cleavage products at remote sites. In the present study, we have found that the 10S G(+2) adduct of BaP DE, which lies toward the scissile bond in the minor groove, blocks normal cleavage, whereas the 10R isomer, which orients away from this bond, allows normal cleavage but blocks religation. In contrast to BaP, the pair of benzo[c] phenanthrene (BcPh) DE adducts at G(+2), which intercalate from the minor groove either between G(+1)/G(+2) or between G(+2)/A, allow normal cleavage but block religation. Both intercalated BcPh DE adducts at G(+1) suppress normal cleavage, as do both groove bound BaP DE adducts at this position.

The enzyme's catalytic mechanism is well characterized. Nucleophilic attack on the DNA backbone by a catalytically essential tyrosine (Tyr723) of the enzyme breaks one of the DNA strands by forming a covalent phosphotyrosyl bond with the 3′-end of the DNA. This break provides a swivel point for DNA relaxation. Once supercoiling has been relieved, the 5′-hydroxyl of the cleaved DNA acts as a nucleophile toward the phosphotyrosyl bond and restores the DNA backbone, thus releasing the enzyme for further catalytic cycles (reviewed in Refs. 1.Wang J.C.

Pommier Y. Adv. Cancer Res. 2001; 80: 189-216Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Top1 is an important target of several anticancer drugs. Camptothecin and its derivatives are believed to kill cancer cells by specifically trapping top1 and preventing the religation of the covalent top1 cleavage complexes. Several other DNA intercalating and minor groove-binding drugs have also been reported to trap these top1 cleavage complexes (reviewed in Ref. 4.Pommier Y. Pourquier P. Fan Y. Strumberg D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1400: 83-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar). However, little is known about how these noncovalently bound drugs block religation and so prevent release of functional top1. Such structural information should prove highly valuable in designing new top1 inhibitors. We have recently utilized covalent DNA adducts (Fig. 1A) derived from trans ring opening of benzo[a]pyrene 7,8-diol-9,10-epoxides (BaP DE, two enantiomers of the diastereomer in which the benzylic 7-hydroxyl group and the epoxide oxygen are trans) by the exocyclic amino groups of the purine bases as probes of the catalytic activity of top1 (5.Pommier Y.

These adducts were introduced into a 22-mer DNA sequence, which contains a single high affinity (7.Bonven B.J. Gocke E. Westergaard O.

These adducts are extremely powerful probes of enzyme-DNA contacts, since their solution conformations are known from two-dimensional NMR studies. For the BaP DE adducts at the exocyclic N2-amino group of dG (X = G, Fig. 1B), the trans 10Sadduct (S-absolute configuration at the point of attachment of the amine to the hydrocarbon) lies in the minor groove with the aromatic portion pointing toward the 5′-end of the adducted strand, as shown in Fig. 2A (9.Cosman M. de los Santos C.

In marked contrast, when X = A the trans-opened BaP DE adducts at N6 are intercalated (10S toward the 3′-end) from the major groove (Fig. 2C) (11.Yeh H.J. Sayer J.M. Liu X. Altieri A.S. Byrd R.A.

We also examine the effects of DE dG adducts (Fig. 1A) derived from trans opening of benzo[c]phenanthrene 3,4-diol 1,2-epoxide (BcPh DE) at positions +1 and +2. These BcPh adducts differ dramatically from the BaP adducts in that the aromatic portion of the hydrocarbon is intercalated from the minor groove into the DNA helix (14.Lin C.H. Huang X.

Human recombinant top1 was purified from Baculovirus-infected cells as described previously (15.Pourquier P. Ueng L.-M. Fertala J. Wang D. Park H.-J. Essigman J.M. Bjornsti M.-A. Pommier Y. J. Biol.

The oligonucleotides containing BaP adducts at G(+1) and their effects on top1 were described by us in previous work (5.Pommier Y. Kohlhagen G. Pourquier P. Sayer J.M. Kroth H. Jerina D.M. Proc.

The 22-mers modified at G(+2) with the trans-opened BaP and BcPh DE adducts, as well as shorter marker oligonucleotides corresponding to their potential cleavage products generated by top1, were synthesized and characterized in a separate study (16.Kroth H.

The two diastereomeric 22-mers containing trans-opened BcPh DE-2 adducts at G(+1) were prepared by the methods described therein. High performance liquid chromatography retention times, configurational assignments, and major CD bands for these two new oligonucleotides are given in Table I.

Annealing to the complementary strand was performed in 1× annealing buffer (10 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.8, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA) by heating the reaction mixture to 95 °C and overnight cooling to room temperature. DNA substrates (∼50 fmol/reaction) were incubated with 5 ng of top1 with or without camptothecin (1 μm) for the indicated times at 25 °C in 10 μl of reaction buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 15 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, final concentrations). Reactions were stopped by adding sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) (final concentration 0.5%). For reversal experiments, the SDS stop was preceded by the addition of NaCl to a final concentration of 0.35 m followed by incubation for 30 min at 25 °C. For the heat reversal experiments, the SDS stop was preceded by heating the samples to 65 °C. Sequencing of oligonucleotides was performed by using the Maxam-Gilbert purine sequencing protocol (18.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Before loading of the electrophoresis, 3.3 volumes of Maxam-Gilbert loading buffer (98% formamide, 0.01m EDTA, 10 mm NaOH, 1 mg/ml xylene cyanol, and 1 mg/ml bromphenol blue) were added to reaction mixtures. Sixteen percent denaturing polyacrylamide gels (7 m urea) were run at 40 V/cm at 50 °C for 2–3 h and dried on Whatman No. 3MM paper sheets. Imaging and quantitations were performed using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). Fig. 3A shows our previously reported (5.Pommier Y. Kohlhagen G. Pourquier P. Sayer J.M. Kroth H. Jerina D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2040-2045Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) results (repeated for comparison purposes) on top1-mediated DNA cleavage of the upper strand of the oligonucleotide containing BaP dG adducts at position G(+1), in comparison with a new experiment utilizing the same adducts at G(+2). In the absence of adduct, top1 did not produce detectable cleavage (lane 2, control), and camptothecin was required for observing the expected 13-mer cleavage product (lane 3, control). When BaP adducts were present at the G(+1) position, the formation of the 13-mer cleavage product was suppressed, and top1 cleavage was shifted in such a way that a 15-mer product was observed independently of camptothecin, and an 18-mer product was observed in the presence of camptothecin. The trans-R adduct had a stronger effect than the trans-S adduct (see Fig. 3B for quantitation). Different effects were observed when the BaP adduct was at the G(+2) position (right side of Fig. 3A). The trans-R adduct induced the accumulation of a large amount of cleavage product, which, in contrast to the control, did not require the presence of camptothecin. In the presence of camptothecin, cleavage at this site was almost irreversible in the presence of 0.35m NaCl. The cleavage band migrated above the 13-mer cleavage product observed for the control oligonucleotide and below the 15-mer cleavage product observed for the oligonucleotides containing BaP G(+1) adducts. Because the migration of the oligonucleotides containing BaP adducts was dependent on the presence and type of BaP adducts (see 23-mer bands), short BaP dG adduct-containing oligonucleotides of known length (14-, 15-, and 16-mers, including the labeled cordycepin residue) were used as markers to establish the length of this cleavage product. The cleavage product derived from the BaP trans-R G(+2)-adducted oligonucleotide migrated in a position consistent with its being a 13-mer. Thus, the presence of a BaP trans-R dG adduct at the +2 position increased cleavage at the normal top1 high affinity site. In marked contrast to the trans-R G(+2) adduct, a BaP trans-S G(+2) adduct suppressed top1-mediated DNA cleavage at the 13-mer site and induced cleavage upstream, resulting in a 15-mer cleavage product (see sequence at the bottom of Fig. 3A) that was independent of camptothecin. Further reversal experiments were carried out with the oligonucleotide containing the BaP trans-R dG(+2) adduct. Heat reversal is commonly used to determine the stability of top1 cleavage complexes (19.Hsiang Y.H. Liu L.F. Cancer Res. 1988; 48: 1722-1726PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 4 shows that a significant fraction of the top1 cleavage product (13-mer) from the BaP trans-R G(+2) adduct resisted heat treatment. This result is consistent with the stabilization of this cleavage product to salt reversal (see Fig. 3A and results above) (5.Pommier Y. Kohlhagen G. Pourquier P. Sayer J.M. Kroth H. Jerina D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2040-2045Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Together, these observations suggest that the enhancement of top1 cleavage by the BaP trans-R G(+2) adduct is due at least in part to an inhibition of top1-mediated DNA religation. We previously reported (6.Pommier Y. Kohlhagen G. Laco G.S. Sayer J.M. Kroth H. Jerina D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10739-10744Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) that a BaP dG adduct at the +1 position of the oligonucleotide induces the formation of top1 cleavage sites on the lower strand, complementary to the adducted strand. We compared these results with the effects of the BaP dG(+2) adducts. In the unmodified oligonucleotide, cleavage of the lower strand by top1 is minimal (Fig. 5, lane 3,Control). The presence of BaP dG adducts (both Sand R) at positions +1 or +2 induced top1 cleavage of the lower strand upstream from the normal cleavage site, resulting in 8-, 16-, and 17-mer cleavage products (Fig. 5). The 16-mer was observed only in the presence of camptothecin, whereas the 8-mer was observed in the absence of camptothecin. The 8-mer presumably represent “suicide” products resulting from diffusion away of the short, T-rich 8-mer fragment so that the cleavage complex cannot religate. Thus, the presence of BaP dG adducts either at the +1 or +2 position results in the formation of top1 cleavage products at positions flanking the adducts on both strands of the modified oligonucleotide. The adducts at G(+2) appeared to be somewhat more effective in promoting 16-mer formation than were the adducts at G(+1). We then tested the effects of the intercalated BcPh dG adducts at position +1 of the same oligonucleotide (Fig. 6). As in the case of the BaP G(+1) adducts, top1-mediated DNA cleavage was: 1) completely suppressed at the high affinity 13-mer site, 2) induced upstream in the absence of camptothecin (15-mer cleavage product), and 3) induced at the 18-mer site in the presence of camptothecin. Cleavage at both of these sites was reversible (Fig. 6). Next we looked at the effects of BcPh dG adducts at G(+2) (Fig. 7). Both the trans-S- and the trans-R-adducted oligonucleotides trapped top1 at the high affinity (13-mer) site independently of camptothecin. However, the oligonucleotide containing the trans-S adduct showed little cleavage at any site, even in the presence of camptothecin. Cleavage of the trans-R adducted oligonucleotide was markedly more efficient. Reversal experiments in the presence of 0.35 mNaCl showed that the cleavage observed with the BcPh trans-RdG(+2) adduct reversed more slowly than cleavage of the corresponding unmodified oligonucleotide observed in the presence of camptothecin (Fig. 8). Similarly, the cleavage product from the BcPh trans-R-adducted oligonucleotide failed to undergo religation upon treatment at 65 °C. These results demonstrate that, as in the case of the BaP adduct which lies in the minor groove, a BcPh adduct intercalated in the DNA from the minor groove one base downstream from the high affinity top1 cleavage site traps the cleavage complex by inhibiting its religation and does so more effectively than does camptothecin.Figure 7Top1 cleavage complexes observed in the presence of BcPh adducts at the G(+2) position.

Depending on their position in the DNA sequence relative to the top1 cleavage site and their orientation in the DNA, these adducts either: 1) prevent top1 from cleaving its DNA substrate at the normal position while enhancing cleavage at other, remote sites (Fig. 2A) or 2) permit cleavage at the normal site but inhibit religation, resulting in accumulation (trapping) of the top1-DNA cleavage complex, even in the absence of camptothecin (Fig. 2, B and C).

In the present study, we identified a novelDrosophila EXT protein with a type II transmembrane topology and demonstrated its glycosyltransferase activities. The truncated soluble form of this new homolog designated DEXT3 transferredN-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) through an α1,4-linkage not only to N-acetylheparosan oligosaccharides that represent growing HS chains (α-GlcNAc transferase II activity) but also to GlcUAβ1–3Galβ1-O-C2H4NHCbz, a synthetic substrate for α-GlcNAc transferase I that determines and initiates HS biosynthesis. The results suggest that DEXT3is the ortholog of human EXTL3 and Caenorhabditis elegans rib-2. Semiquantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR analysis revealed ubiquitous expression of the DEXT3mRNA. Based on the findings of the present study and those of a recent study where a fly mutant, deficient in the botv gene identical to DEXT3, affected HS proteoglycan-mediated developmental signalings, it is suggested that DEXT3 with the revealed glycosyltransferase activities is critically involved in HS formation in Drosophila. These results suggest the essential roles ofDEXT3, its human ortholog EXTL3, and theC. elegans ortholog rib-2 in the biosynthesis of heparan sulfate and heparin, if present, in the respective organisms.

Proteoglycans are distributed ubiquitously on cell surfaces and in extracellular matrices in virtually all animal tissues and function in a variety of cellular and developmental processes such as cell adhesion, proliferation, migration, differentiation, and tissue morphogenesis (1.Bernfield M.

Their ability to interact with a panel of various functional proteins, such as growth factors, morphogens, cytokines, growth factor/cytokine receptors, proteases, and extracellular matrix components, is ascribable to the specific saccharide sequences in the GAG chains (3.Salmivirta M. Lidholt K. Lindahl U. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 1270-1279Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar, 4.Perrimon N. Bernfield M. Nature. 2000; 404: 725-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar). GAGs can be classified into heparin/heparan sulfate (HS) and chondroitin sulfate (CS)/dermatan sulfate (DS), which are glucosaminoglycans and galactosaminoglycans, respectively. They are synthesized on the common GAG-protein linkage region tetrasaccharide GlcUAβ1–3Galβ1–3Galβ1–4Xylβ1-O- bound to the specific serine residues in the core proteins (5.Lindahl U. Rodén L. Gottschalk A. Glycoproteins. Elsevier Science Publishing Co., Inc., New York1972: 491-517Google Scholar). Following the transfer of α-GlcNAc as the first N-acetylhexosamine unit to this linkage region, catalyzed by GlcNAcT-I (6.Fritz T.A. Gabb M.M. Wei G. Esko J.D. J. Biol.

Formation of the repeating CS/DS disaccharide region on the linkage region is achieved by the action of chondroitin synthase through alternate additions of GlcUA and GalNAc (10.Kitagawa H. Uyama T.

Congenital mutations ofEXT1 and EXT2 are clinically associated with hereditary multiple exostoses, a benign bone tumor characterized by multiple cartilage-capped outgrowths of long bones (18.Solomon L.

Although the three other family members called EXT-like genes, designated EXTL1, EXTL2 and EXTL3, are highly homologous to EXT1 and EXT2 (14.Wise C.A. Clines G.A. Massa H. Trask B.J. Lovett M.

Purification of a unique α1,4-GalNAc transferase encoded byEXTL2 has led us to identify this enzyme as HS-synthesizing α1,4-GlcNAcT-I (21.Kitagawa H. Shimakawa H. Sugahara K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13933-13937Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), which exhibits a bifunctional α1,4-GalNAc/GlcNAc transferase that can determine and initiate HS synthesis. More recently, we demonstrated that EXTL3 harbors both GlcNAcT-I and GlcNAcT-II activities whereas EXTL1 displays GlcNAcT-II activity only, suggesting that EXT-like genes also play functional roles in HS biosynthesis (22.Kim B.-T. Kitagawa H. Tamura J. Saito T. Kusche-Gullberg M. Lindahl U. Sugahara K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7176-7181Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Thus, all humanEXT family member proteins possess HS synthesis-related glycosyltransferase activities. EXT proteins also exist in Drosophila melanogaster andCaenorhabditis elegans (23.Bellaiche Y. The I. Perrimon N. Nature. 1998; 394: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar, 24.Clines G.A. Ashley J.A. Shah S. Lovett M. Genome Res. 1997; 7: 359-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), and recent studies suggested that some of them are essential participants in forming HS in these organisms (23.Bellaiche Y. The I. Perrimon N. Nature. 1998; 394: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar, 25.Kitagawa H. Egusa N. Tamura J. Kusche-Gullberg M. Lindahl U. Sugahara K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4834-4838Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In the fruit fly, two EXT homologs have been identified and named ttv (EXT1ortholog) and DEXT2 (likely EXT2 ortholog) (23.Bellaiche Y. The I. Perrimon N. Nature. 1998; 394: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). The ttv mutation causes severe loss of HS (26.Toyoda H. Kinoshita-Toyoda A. Fox B. Selleck S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21856-21861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) and thereby early embryonic death by affecting the developmental signalings that are regulated by HS proteoglycans (23.Bellaiche Y. The I. Perrimon N. Nature. 1998; 394: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). However, its glycosyltransferase activities have not been demonstrated, although accumulating circumstantial evidence strongly suggests that TTV is an HS polymerase. No glycosyltransferase activity has been revealed for DEXT2 either. A Drosophila database search for proteins related to human EXT members revealed the third homolog encoding 972 amino acids. A hydropathy plot of the amino acid sequence exhibited a type II transmembrane structure typical of many endoplasmic reticulum/Golgi resident glycosyltransferases. By expressing its recombinant soluble form in mammalian cells, we detected the glycosyltransferase activities most probably involved in HS biosynthesis, which is the first demonstration of catalytic activities of an EXT homolog in Drosophila. Intriguingly, while we were preparing the manuscript, a new segment polarity gene (27.Han, C., Lin., X., Zhao, C., Opoka, R., Wang, K., and Lin, X. (2001)The Annual Drosophila Research Conference,Washington, D. C., March 21–25, Program No. 411Google Scholar) was reported and was found to be identical to this newEXT homolog, which we named DEXT3 here. Its mutant phenotypes showed that developmental signalings regulated by HS proteoglycans were specifically impaired. Its in vitrocatalytic activities revealed in this study strongly suggest thatDEXT3 is critically involved in HS production inDrosophila in vivo. Preliminary results have been presented in abstract form (28.Kim B.-T. Kitagawa H. Tamura J. Kusche-Gullberg M. Lindahl U. Sugahara K. Glycoconj. J. 2001; 18: 119Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Drosophila EST clones (LD13149, LD21192, LD38007, LD43838, and SD03322) were purchased from Research Genetics, Inc. (Huntsville, AL).

The linkage region tetrasaccharide-serine, GlcUAβ1–3Galβ1–3Galβ1–4Xylβ1-O-Ser, was chemically synthesized as described previously (30.Tamura, J., Neumann, K. W., and Ogawa, T.

An 894-bp cDNA fragment containing the insulin signal sequence and the protein A sequence was cleaved from pGIR201protA (31.Kitagawa H. Paulson J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1394-1401Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) by NheI digestion and then inserted into the XbaI site of the expression vector pEF-BOS (32.Mizushima S. Nagata S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 5322Crossref PubMed Scopus (1499) Google Scholar) to prepare pEF-BOS/IP. A DNA insert of interest was ligated into theBamHI site derived from pGIR201protA for expression as described below. Five corresponding Drosophila EST clones were purchased including LD21192, whose sequence was deposited as the complete mRNA sequence (AF132161) in the GenBankTM. Plasmids of the purchased EST clones were digested with several appropriate restriction endonucleases, and two clones, LD38007 and LD43838, were found to have the whole sequence of the novelEXT homolog. Unexpectedly, the LD21192 clone that we received had an entirely different sequence from AF132161. The cDNA fragment encoding a truncated form of the gene, lacking the N-terminal first 95 amino acids, was amplified with the plasmid from LD38007 as a template by PCR using a 5′ primer (5′-ATTGATCATACGAAGATTTCAGCGCCATG-3′) containing an in-frameBcl I site and a 3′ primer (5′-ATTGATCAAAGTGAAGTGGCCGCCTTT-3′) containing a Bcl I site located 53 bp downstream of the stop codon. PCR was carried out withPfu polymerase by 30 cycles of 95 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 6 min. The amplified fragments were digested with Bcl I and cloned into theBamHI site of pEF-BOS/IP, resulting in the fusion protein, which had the cleavable insulin signal sequence for secretion and protein A for purification of the expressed fusion protein. The expression plasmid (6.7 μg) was transfected into COS-1 cells on 100-mm plates using FuGENETM6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Tokyo, Japan) according to the instructions supplied by the manufacturer. Two days after transfection, 1 ml of the medium was collected, and the secreted fusion protein was purified by incubation with 10 μl of IgG-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) for 2 h at 4 °C. The beads recovered by centrifugation were washed with each assay buffer described below, resuspended in the same buffer and then tested for glycosyltransferase activities.

All the enzyme reactions were carried out at 30 °C. Reaction products were quantified in a liquid scintillation counter (TRI-CARB 2900TR, Packard Co.) using a scintillation fluid containing 1.2% (w/v) 2,5-diphenyloxazole and 33% (w/v) Triton X-100. The products from the GlcNAcT-I reaction using GlcUAβ1–3Galβ1-O-C2H4NHCbz were isolated by hydrophobic HPLC on a Nova-Pak C18 column in an LC-10A system (Shimadzu Co., Kyoto, Japan) (22.Kim B.-T.

The column was developed with H2O for 15 min at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min at room temperature and thereafter a linear gradient was applied to increase the methanol concentration from 0 to 100% over a 5-min period. The column was then developed isocratically with 100% methanol for 20 min. The radioactive peak containing the product was pooled and evaporated to dryness. The dried sample (about 40 pmol) was incubated with either 9 mIU of β-N-acetylhexosaminidase in a total volume of 20 μl of 50 mm sodium citrate buffer, pH 4.5, or with 10 mIU of heparitinase I in a total volume of 50 μl of 20 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 7.0, containing 2 mm calcium acetate at 37 °C overnight. Each enzyme digest was analyzed using the same Nova-Pak C18 column as that noted above. GlcNAcT-II reaction products were chromatographed by gel filtration on a Superdex peptide HR 10/30 column (1.0 × 30 cm) using 0.2m NH4HCO3 as an eluent. Fractions containing radioactive products were pooled and evaporated with intermittent addition of H2O until the ammonium salt became invisible. An aliquot (about 30 pmol) of each purified product was incubated with either 9 mIU of β-N-acetylhexosaminidase in a total volume of 20 μl of 50 mm sodium citrate buffer, pH 4.5, or with 10 mIU of heparitinase I in a total volume of 100 μl of 20 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 7.0, containing 2 mm calcium acetate at 37 °C overnight. Each digest was analyzed again using the same Superdex peptide column as described above. ADrosophila Rapid-ScanTM gene expression panel was purchased from OriGene Technologies, Inc. (Rockville, MD). The panel contained first strand cDNAs from differentDrosophila tissues and developmental stages, which have been normalized against the RP49 transcript, the mRNA encoding a constitutively expressed ribosomal protein. PCR was carried out withTaq polymerase, and the conditions were as follows: for DEXT3, predenaturing at 94 °C for 3 min and 35 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 57 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 60 s; forttv, predenaturing at 94 °C for 3 min and 35 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 52 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 60 s. The used primers were: 5′ primer (5′-ATGGTGCCCGCCCGAAGGAAATA-3′) and 3′ primer (5′-AAAGGGCAGCTGGGGGTAAAGGTAA-3′) for DEXT3, and 5′ primer (5′-ATCGGAGACGCGCAACTC-3′) and 3′ primer (5′-CAAGGGTATGTGGCTGGTG-3′) for ttv. When the human EXT family members were used as query sequences for BLASTP search in the Berkeley Drosophila Genome Project homepage (fruit fly.org), three highly homologous genes were found:ttv (CG10117, AF083889), DEXT2 (CG8433, AF145598) and the unreported EXT homolog (CG15110, AF132161) with unknown functions, which is designated DEXT3 here. The complete cDNA of the DEXT3 gene and the predicted amino acid sequence of the putative protein are presented in Fig. 1A. The cDNA consisted of a single open reading frame of 2919 bp encoding a type II transmembrane protein of 972 amino acids, which had a 56-amino acid cytoplasmic domain and one prominent hydrophobic segment that extended from amino acid residue 57 to 75 (Fig. 1B). This novel hypothetical protein showed significant amino acid identity with all human EXT family members: EXT1 (20.1%), EXT2 (25.1%), EXTL1 (17.9%), EXTL2 (22.7%), and EXTL3 (45.8%). The phylogenetic tree of theEXT family members among humans, C. elegans, and D. melanogaster was generated based on the amino acid sequences, which showed that EXTL3, Rib-2, and DEXT3 are more closely related with one another as compared with other EXT family members (Fig. 2A). A multiple alignment of the amino acid sequences of EXTL3, Rib-2, and DEXT3 revealed that they shared markedly high amino acid sequence identity especially in the C-terminal regions (Fig. 2B), suggesting that DEXT3 may have similar glycosyltransferase activities to EXTL3 and Rib-2, both of which showed GlcNAcT-I and GlcNAcT-II activities.Figure 2Comparison of DEXT3with other EXT gene family members.A, the phylogenetic tree was generated based on the whole amino acid sequences of DEXT3 and of the EXT proteins reported to date for Homo sapiens, C. elegans, and D. melanogaster.

Using LD38007 cDNA as a template, the truncated form of DEXT3 was produced by replacing the N-terminal 95 amino acids of the putative cytoplasmic and transmembrane domains with a cleavable insulin signal sequence and a protein A IgG-binding domain and then expressed in COS-1 cells as a fused enzyme form. The recombinant enzyme secreted into the culture medium was purified with IgG-Sepharose beads to eliminate endogenous glycosyltransferases, and the enzyme-bound beads were used for enzyme assays with various oligosaccharides as sugar-acceptor substrates. The bound enzyme efficiently transferred GlcNAc toN-acetylheparosan oligosaccharides, which have nonreducing terminal GlcUA residues and represent growing HS chains (Table I), indicating that DEXT3 has GlcNAcT-II activity. However, it did not transfer GlcUA toN-acetylheparosan oligosaccharides with nonreducing terminal GlcNAc residues, indicating that DEXT3 is not an HS polymerase. It did not use Galβ1–3Galβ1–4Xyl either, a substrate for GlcAT-I (33.Kitagawa H. Tone Y. Tamura J. Neumann K.W. Ogawa T. Oka S. Kawasaki T. Sugahara K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6615-6618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). It also showed significant GlcNAc transferase activity as measured with GlcUAβ1–3Galβ1-O-C2H4NHCbz, a synthetic acceptor substrate for HS-initiating GlcNAcT-I enzyme (22.Kim B.-T. Kitagawa H.

However, the linkage region tetrasaccharide serine GlcUAβ1–3Galβ1–3Galβ1–4Xylβ1-O-Ser was not utilized as an acceptor. The significance of these seemingly discrepant results obtained with this substrate and the above synthetic acceptor will be discussed below (see “Discussion”). The soluble form of DEXT3 showed no α-GalNAc transferase activity (21.Kitagawa H. Shimakawa H. Sugahara K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13933-13937Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), the unique catalytic activity of EXTL2, as detected withN-acetylchondrosine, GlcUAβ1–3GalNAc, consistent with the idea that DEXT3 is not an EXTL2 ortholog. Chondroitin did not serve as an acceptor when UDP-[3H]GalNAc or UDP-[14C]GlcUA was used as a donor substrate. The culture medium from the control transfection showed no GlcNAcT-I or GlcNAcT-II activity after purification steps using IgG-Sepharose beads.Table IAcceptor substrate specificity of the truncated form of DEXT3 secreted into the culture medium by the transfected COS-1 cellsAcceptor sugar (donor)Glycosyltransferase activity1-aThe values represent the averages of two independent experiments.pmol/ml medium/hGlcUAβ1–3Galβ1-O-C2H4NHCbz (UDP-GlcNAc)257GlcUAβ1–3Galβ1–3Galβ1–4Xy1β1-O-Ser (UDP-GlcNAc)ND1-bND, not detected (< 0.5 pmol/ml medium/h).N-Acetylheparosan oligosaccharides with the nonreducing terminal GlcUA1-dGlcUAβ1–4GlcNAcα1-(4GlcUAβ1–4GlcNAcα1)n-4GlcUAβ1-aManR;n, in average 7.(UDP-GlcNAc)3921-cWhen truncated EXT1 was used for the positive control, the measured activity was 539 pmol/ml medium/h.N-Acetylheparosan oligosaccharides with the nonreducing terminal GlcNAc1-fGlcNAcα1-(4GlcUAβ1–4GlcNAcα1)n-4GlcUAβ1-aManR;n, in average 7.(UDP-GlcUA)ND1-eWhen truncated EXT1 was used for the positive control, the measured activity was 111 pmol/ml medium/h.Chondroitin1-gA mixture of GlcUAβ1-(3GalNAcβ1–4GlcUAβ1-)n and GalNAcβ1-(4GlcUAβ1–3GalNAcβ1-)n.

Open table in a new tab The products from the GlcNAcT-I and GlcNAcT-II reactions were characterized by digestions with an appropriate eliminase and glycosidase. The radiolabel of GlcNAcT-I products was quantitatively released by heparitinase I treatment as shown by hydrophobic HPLC on a C18 column, where the radiolabel was eluted in the flow-through fraction as free GlcNAc (Fig. 4). β-N-Acetyhexosaminidase digestion did not release any radioactivity. Heparitinase I treatment also released [3H]GlcNAc from the GlcNAcT-II reaction products: the products, which originally eluted near the void volume upon gel filtration using a Superdex peptide column, shifted to the free GlcNAc position after heparitinase digestion (Fig. 3B). In contrast, 3H-labeled products were insensitive to β-N-acetylhexosaminidase digestion. Since heparitinase I cleaves only an α1,4-glucosaminyl glucuronate linkage, these results suggest that DEXT3 transferred GlcNAc to the acceptors via an α1,4-linkage in both GlcNAcT-I and GlcNAcT-II reactions, suggesting that the enzyme activities are most likely involved in initiation and elongation of HS precursor chains. The expression profile of DEXT3 were determined by RT-PCR using a Drosophila expression panel containing first strand cDNAs from different tissues and different developmental stages. Deficiency of ttv, theDrosophila homolog of EXT1, causes severe reduction of HS and embryonic lethality during the development, which strongly suggests TTV is a Drosophila HS polymerase. Since DEXT3 showed GlcNAc-TI and GlcNAcT-II activities apparently involved in HS biosynthesis, the expression profiles of both Drosophilagenes were compared. Unexpectedly, even with the lowest cDNA concentration (1x, 1 pg of cDNA), amplification of ttv reached a saturation suggesting its abundant expression. Hence, the results obtained with only two upper concentrations (1000× and 100×) are displayed in Fig. 4. The ttv expression looked similar to those of housekeeping genes. The results of semiquantitative RT-PCR analysis showed that it is expressed evenly and strongly throughout the developmental stages and in both head and body from male and female adult fruit flies. In contrast, the pattern of amplified bands of DEXT3 may suggest its differential expression, although it should be substantiated by more quantitative methods. Homologs of human EXT gene family members are also found in invertebrates such as D. melanogaster and C. elegans (23.Bellaiche Y. The I. Perrimon N.

FEBS Lett. 1999; 459: 327-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), and recent studies have suggested the involvement of at least some of them in the HS production in these genetically tractable organisms (23.Bellaiche Y. The I. Perrimon N. Nature. 1998; 394: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar, 25.Kitagawa H. Egusa N. Tamura J. Kusche-Gullberg M. Lindahl U. Sugahara K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4834-4838Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). TTV and DEXT2 are EXT homologs identified in Drosophila and show the highest amino acid sequence identity to human EXT1 (50.4%) and EXT2 (44.8%), respectively, which suggests that ttv and DEXT2may be corresponding orthologs of human EXT1 andEXT2 and that their functions may be similar to their counterparts. This appears to be the case, but has not yet been confirmed. According to the mutant analyses, TTV looks like aDrosophila HS polymerase with both GlcNAcT-II and GlcAT-II activities like EXT1 but in vitro catalytic activities have not been demonstrated (23.Bellaiche Y. The I. Perrimon N. Nature. 1998; 394: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). No evidence has been presented either for the involvement of DEXT2 in the HS biosynthesis in the fruit fly, partly due to lack of mutants. Recently, we proposed that human EXT-like proteins as well as EXT1 and EXT2 play important roles in the HS biosynthesis based on their in vitro catalytic activities (22.Kim B.-T. Kitagawa H. Tamura J. Saito T. Kusche-Gullberg M. Lindahl U. Sugahara K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7176-7181Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). In humans, HS synthesis is initiated on the common linkage region, which is shared by chondroitin/dermatan sulfate, by the action of GlcNAcT-I that is encoded by both EXTL2 andEXTL3 (7.Sugahara K. Kitagawa H. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2000; 10: 518-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar, 21.Kitagawa H. Shimakawa H. Sugahara K. J. Biol.

Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7176-7181Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The presence of the EXT1 andEXT2 homologs in Drosophila suggests that the HS biosynthetic mechanism is similar in both species such that GlcNAcT-I activity would also be required for initiating the HS formation inDrosophila. In the present study, by searchingDrosophila databases, we identified the thirdDrosophila EXT homolog, DEXT3, most highly homologous to human EXTL3 (45.8% amino acids identity) and demonstrated that DEXT3 also had GlcNAcT-I and GlcNAcT-II activities as in the case of human EXTL3. These results suggested that the HS synthetic mechanism is quite similar in humans and Drosophila although only three family members have been identified in the latter. After we identified the DEXT3 gene and characterized the glycosyltransferase activities of the expressed protein, we noticed an abstract by Lin et al. for a recent DrosophilaResearch Conference (27.Han, C., Lin., X., Zhao, C., Opoka, R., Wang, K., and Lin, X. (2001)The Annual Drosophila Research Conference,Washington, D. C., March 21–25, Program No. 411Google Scholar). The abstract reported a Drosophilamutant deficient in the gene named botv (brother ofttv), which shares the highest homology to humanEXTL3 and was identical to DEXT3. The genetic screen was performed to isolate genes that are involved in bothWingless (Wg) and Hedgehog(Hh) signalings, and the isolated fruit fly mutant showed segment polarity phenotypes. The botv mutant phenotypes closely resemble those of the ttv mutant, suggesting that they relate to the same biological processes. Since Wg andHh signalings are both mediated by HS chains attached to HS proteoglycans, these phenotypes likely reflect the lack of the functional saccharide sequences, implying that botv is involved in HS production. It should be emphasized that the phenotypes of the botv mutant are distinct from that of thettv mutant. In the ttv mutant, Hhsignaling is specifically impaired (23.Bellaiche Y. The I. Perrimon N. Nature. 1998; 394: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). In contrast, thebotv mutation affects both Hh and Wgsignalings, which should cause severer defects duringDrosophila development. When HS is assembled on the linkage region tetrasaccharide, the first GlcNAc transfer by GlcNAcT-I allows the subsequent synthesis of the repeating disaccharide region by HS polymerase. In this regard, our results, which have demonstrated that DEXT3 has both GlcNAcT-I and GlcNAcT-II activities involved in the initiation and elongation of HS chains, are in good agreement with the phenotypes of the botv mutant. The absence of aDrosophila ortholog of human EXTL2 that encodes GlcNAcT-I may account for the phenotypes affecting both Hhand Wg signalings in the DEXT3/botv mutant, which may, in turn, suggest a possibility that human EXTL2 and EXTL3 are responsible for the HS chain initiation for distinct core proteins. The acceptor substrate specificity revealed for DEXT3 closely resembled those of human EXTL3 and C. elegans Rib-2 in that it has both GlcNAcT-I and GlcNAcT-II activities and does not transfer GlcNAc to the linkage region tetrasaccharide-serine (Table I), which is characteristic of GlcNAcT-I. Rib-2 is a C. elegans EXThomolog, and we reported that it has both GlcNAc transferase activities related to HS biosynthesis (25.Kitagawa H. Egusa N. Tamura J. Kusche-Gullberg M. Lindahl U. Sugahara K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4834-4838Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). DEXT3 shows the highest homology to EXTL3 (45.8%) followed by Rib-2 (29.2%), and the homology in the C-terminal presumptive catalytic domain increases up to 78 and 50%, respectively, to the corresponding domains of EXTL3 and Rib-2 (Fig. 2B). It is therefore not surprising that DEXT3 has the same two catalytic activities. It is conceivable that these three enzyme proteins, which have identical catalytic activities and substrate specificity, are obligatorily conserved during evolution among quite different species of invertebrates and vertebrates. They must be indispensable elements in the HS biosynthetic machinery. The phenotypes of the botv mutants strongly support this idea. Hence, it is suggested that EXTL3 and Rib-2, the DEXT3 counterparts in humans andC. elegans, also have critical roles in the HS formation in the respective organisms, at least as an initiating enzyme. In addition, it is noteworthy that all three enzymes have GlcNAcT-II activity apparently related to HS chain elongation. This activity appears to be redundant between DEXT3 and HS polymerases, which have both GlcNAcT-II and HS-GlcAT-II activities that are definitely required for the synthesis of the repeating disaccharide regions in HS chains. Although it remains to be clarified whether the GlcNAcT-II activity of DEXT3 and the corresponding homologs in other species are involved in HS synthesis in vivo, the highly conserved nature of these proteins among very distant species in the evolutionary tree strongly suggests its importance in the HS synthesis. It might be a necessary component in the putative HS synthesizing enzyme complex. It has become evident that DEXT3 plays critical roles in the heparan sulfate synthesis in Drosophila, which consequently raises a good possibility that EXTL3, its human ortholog and Rib-2, the C. elegans ortholog, also have similar roles. Indeed, we recently observed embryonic partially lethal phenotypes in C. elegansby RNA interference experiments using rib-2dsRNA. 3S. Mizuguchi, K. H. Nomura, K. Nomura, N. Egusa, H. Kitagawa, and K.

https://openalex.org/W2091741478,"Recombination-dependent replication is an essential housekeeping function in prokaryotes and eukaryotes, serving, for example, to restart DNA replication after the repair of a double-strand break. Little is known about the interplay between the recombination and replication machinery when recombination intermediates are used as substrates for DNA replication. We show here that recombination intermediates formed between linear duplex and supercoiled plasmid DNAs are substrates for a generalized strand displacement DNA synthesis reaction in which the 3′-OH of the invading strand in the recombination intermediate is used as a primer. DNA synthesis is driven by negative superhelicity and is inhibited if disassembly of the RecA filament is prevented. Thus, assembly and disassembly of RecA filaments in the same direction facilitates filament clearance from the 3′-end of the invading strand, allowing DNA synthesis to occur from recombination intermediates.

Thus, assembly and disassembly of RecA filaments in the same direction facilitates filament clearance from the 3′-end of the invading strand, allowing DNA synthesis to occur from recombination intermediates. Maintenance of genomic integrity is dependent on the intersection of DNA replication and recombination (1.Haber J.E. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 271-275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar, 2.Kuzminov A. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 16: 373-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar, 3.Rothstein R. Michel B. Gangloff S. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1-10Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Many forms of recombinational repair of DNA damage involve limited DNA synthesis and, as has become clear over the past few years, the rescue of stalled replication forks requires the action of the recombination proteins. This latter point is best illustrated in bacteria, in which the replication forks that form at the origin of replication are generally not the ones that complete replication of the chromosome (4.Cox M.M. Goodman M.F. Kreuzer K.N. Sherratt D.J. Sandler S.J. Marians K.J. Nature. 2000; 404: 37-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (875) Google Scholar). Instead, with high frequency, either they run into frozen proteins or template DNA damage such as thymidine dimers, abasic lesions, or other bulky adducts that cause the replication fork to stall, or they encounter template nicks that cause the replication fork to collapse completely, generating a double-strand break in one of the sister chromosomes. Both types of events require that the template damage be repaired and that DNA replication be restarted. The role of the recombination proteins in replication restart varies. In some instances, such as daughter strand gap repair, it is thought that DNA strand exchange acts to provide a template strand for repair of the lesion and that subsequent replication restart takes place at a replication fork that is regenerated by the combined action of proteins such as the branch migration enzymes RuvAB and RecG, the Holliday junction resolvase RuvC, and DNA helicases such as RecQ (5.Kowalczykowski S.C.

On the other hand, during double-strand break repair in bacteria, replication restart proceeds directly from a recombination intermediate (8.Kogoma T. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1997; 61: 212-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). This intermediate is most likely a D loop that has been formed between the broken and intact sister chromosome arms by the action of RecA and RecBCD. Replication restart is effected by the assembly of the replication restart primosome, which is directed by the action of PriA (9.Marians K.J. Trends Biochem.

Chem. 1999; 274: 25026-25032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), and subsequent primosome assembly leads to the deposition of DnaB, the replication fork DNA helicase, on the lagging-strand template, allowing replisome assembly. Inactivation of priA leads to the generation of spontaneous suppressor mutations that map in dnaC (12.Sandler S.J. Sawra H.S. Clark A.J. Genetics. 1996; 145: 5-13Crossref Google Scholar), another restart primosomal protein (13.Sandler S.J. Marians K.J. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 9-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar) that forms a complex with DnaB in solution (14.Wickner S. Hurwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 921-925Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) and is involved in its transfer to DNA (15.Learn B.A. Um S.J. Huang L. McMacken R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1154-1159Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). We have reconstituted PriA-directed replisome assembly on a nicked, double-stranded DNA template that was engineered to contain a D loop (16.Liu J. Xu L. Sandler S.J. Marians K.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3552-3555Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Using this system, we showed that DnaC810, which is encoded by thepriA− suppressor allele dnaC810(12.Sandler S.J. Sawra H.S. Clark A.J. Genetics. 1996; 145: 5-13Crossref Google Scholar), had gained the ability to bypass PriA function and load DnaB directly to the D loop. This observation underscores that replication restart is an essential function. Genetic studies have demonstrated multiple pathways of replication restart (17.Sandler S.J. Marians K.J. Zavitz K.H. Coutu J. Parent M.A. Clark A.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 34: 91-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 18.Sandler S.J. McCool J.D. Do T.T. Johansen R.U. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 41: 697-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), the use of which might reflect the different types of substrates for replication restart generated by the recombination proteins. To understand how the enzymatic pathway for processing of recombination intermediates is chosen, we have initiated an effort to reconstitute concerted recombination and replication reactions in vitro. We demonstrate here a generalized DNA polymerase-catalyzed strand displacement synthesis reaction that utilizes as a primer the 3′-OH end of the invading strand in a D loop generated by the action of RecA and RecBCD. The nascent strand synthesis reaction does not require a DNA helicase and is driven by negative supercoiling. We also show that the availability of the 3′-end of the invading strand is dictated by the nature of the RecA filament that is formed during strand exchange. If the filament is static, the 3′-end is buried within and cannot be accessed by a DNA polymerase, whereas if the filament is dynamic, any DNA polymerase can bind to the 3′-end and extend it. RecA (19.Griffith J. Shores C.G. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 158-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) and RecBCD (20.Roman L.J. Kowalczykowski S.C. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 2863-2873Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) were prepared as described. single-stranded DNA-binding protein (SSB), 1The abbreviations used are: SSBsingle-stranded DNA-binding proteinHEholoenzymePol IIIpolymerase IIIBIRbreak-induced replicationDNA gyrase, topoisomerase IV, and the DNA polymerase III holoenzyme (Pol III HE, as Pol III* and β) were prepared as described previously (21.Hiasa H.

RecA K72R was the kind gift of Michael Cox (University of Wisconsin). pBRχ-1 DNA was purified after alkaline lysis by buoyant density CsCl centrifugation and velocity sedimentation in sucrose gradients containing 1 m NaCl. The 800-mer was prepared by PCR using a forward primer with the sequence 5′-TGATTCTTCTCGCTTCCGGC-3′ corresponding to nucleotide coordinates 1724–1743 of pBRχ-1 DNA and a reverse primer with the sequence 5′-ATGCCCGGTTACTGGAACGT-3′ corresponding to nucleotide coordinates 2549′–2530′ of pBRχ-1 DNA. The DNA fragment was gel-purified before use. single-stranded DNA-binding protein holoenzyme polymerase III break-induced replication Standard reaction mixtures (20 μl) containing 50 mmHEPES-KOH (pH 8.0), 16 mm MgOAc, 10 mmdithiothreitol, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 2 mm ATP, 40 μm dNTPs, 7.5 mm creatine phosphate, 62 ng/ml creatine kinase, 12.5 nm 5′-32P-labeled 800-mer, 1.1 nm pBRχ-1 DNA, 3.5 μmRecA, 1 nm RecBCD, 0.8 μm SSB, 16 nm DNA gyrase, 20 nm Pol III*, and 20 nm β-subunit of the HE were incubated at 37 °C for 5 min for joint molecule formation or 20 min for form X formation and DNA elongation. Reactions were terminated by the addition of EDTA, SDS, and proteinase K to 25 mm, 1%, and 100 μg/ml, respectively, followed by incubation at 37 °C for 30 min. The samples were analyzed by electrophoresis through vertical 1% agarose gels at 1.5 V/cm for 15 h using 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.3 at 23 °C), 40 mm NaOAc, 1 mm EDTA as the electrophoresis buffer. Gels were dried and autoradiographed. Two DNA elongation reaction mixtures were mixed together and then applied equally to two adjacent lanes of a neutral agarose gel as described above. After electrophoresis, the two lanes were excised from the gel. One lane was dried to serve as a reference. The other lane was soaked in 50 mm NaOH, 1 mm EDTA and then inserted into a 0.5% horizontal alkaline agarose gel. Electrophoresis was at 1.5 V/cm for 15 h using 30 mm NaOH, 1 mm EDTA as the electrophoresis buffer. The gel was neutralized by soaking in 5% trichloroacetic acid, dried, and autoradiographed. Joint molecules were formed as described above in a standard reaction mixture increased 5-fold in a volume that contained only RecA, RecBCD, and SSB. After treatment with proteinase K, joint molecules were isolated by gel filtration through a Bio-Gel A-5m column (2.5 ml) formed in a 2-ml Falcon pipette using 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0 at 4 °C), 1 mmEDTA as the column buffer. The excluded volume was identified by determining the Cerenkov radiation present in the column fractions and pooled. Typically, 12 or 13 μl of this pool were used in subsequent reactions. An oligonucleotide substrate was prepared by annealing a 65-nt-long top strand of the sequence 5′-ACCGCAATACGGAAGCTGGCTGAGCACGCCGACGAACATTCAGTACGCCAGACCACGTATCGGAA-3′ with a 40-nt-long bottom strand of the sequence 5′-TTCCGATACGTGGTCTGGCGTACTGAATGTTCGTCGGCGT-3′ to give a duplex region of 40 bp containing a centrally located RsaI site with a 25-nt-long 5′-single-stranded tail. The top strand was 5′-32P-labeled. Reaction mixtures (80 μl) containing 50 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 8.0), 16 mm MgOAc, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, either 2 mm ATP or dATP, 7.5 mm creatine phosphate, 62 ng/ml creatine kinase, 1.2 nm32P-tailed duplex oligonucleotide, and either 3.5 μm wild-type or K72R RecA were incubated for 15 min at 37 °C. An aliquot (10 μl) was withdrawn to represent the 0 time point of the digestion reaction,RsaI (2.5 units) was added, and the incubation was continued. Aliquots (10 μl) were withdrawn at the indicated times. Reactions were terminated by the addition of EDTA to 25 mmfollowed by extraction with phenol-chloroform and recovery of the DNA by ethanol precipitation. Samples were analyzed by electrophoresis through an 8% polyacrylamide gel (30:1, acrylamide to bisacrylamide) using 100 mm Tris borate (pH 8.3), 2 mm EDTA as the electrophoresis buffer. The gel was fixed by soaking in 10% methanol, 7% HOAc, 5% glycerol and then dried. DNA strand exchange during double-strand break-repair is initiated inEscherichia coli by RecBCD locating the double-strand end of the broken chromosome arm and digesting it. Initially, the 3′-ended strand is digested from the break until a properly oriented χ-site is encountered. Nuclease activity then switches to the 5′-ended strand from the break, resulting in the generation of a recombinogenic 3′-single-stranded tail that becomes coated with RecA as a result of the RecA-loading enhancing function of RecBCD (22.Anderson D.G. Kowalczykowski S.C. Cell. 1997; 90: 77-86Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Strand invasion into the sister chromosome results initially in the formation of a D loop. This key intermediate is a substrate for both the continued action of recombination proteins and the assembly of a replisome. To study these reactions, we utilized a plasmid template, pBRχ-1, a modified pBR322 DNA into which we had inserted a χ-site at the XcmI site, and an 800-nt-long double-stranded DNA fragment representing the broken chromosome arm that was produced by PCR from the region on pBRχ-1 that included the χ-site (Fig. 1A). Our initial reconstitution efforts included RecA, RecBCD, the SSB, the restart primosomal proteins, the DNA Pol III HE, and DNA gyrase, along with the 800-mer and pBRχ-1. As we developed this system, we found that although we could observe bona fide replisome assembly, which will be described elsewhere, we could also observe a replication reaction that was not dependent on DnaB, the replication fork helicase. This reaction is described here. Incubation of a linear duplex DNA (the 800-mer) with a plasmid DNA (pBRχ-1) containing complementary sequences in the presence of RecA, RecBCD, SSB, and ATP results in the generation of joint molecules (Fig. 1B, lane 1). In this and all other experiments described herein, 32P label is present only on the 5′-ends of the 800-mer. We observed the formation of both χ-dependent and χ-independent joint molecules. Because the χ-independent joint molecules incorporate all of the 800-mer, whereas in the χ-dependent joint molecules, the 800-mer has been digested by RecBCD to the χ-site (see Fig. 2), which is roughly in the center of the 800-mer, the χ-independent joint molecules have a reduced mobility as compared with the χ-dependent joint molecules on the native agarose gels used for analysis of the reaction products. Inclusion of gyrase and the Pol III HE in the reaction mixture resulted in the appearance of a new band (Fig. 1B, lane 3) that is a consequence of the invading strand in the joint molecule having been extended all the way around the plasmid DNA template by the DNA polymerase (Fig. 2). The formation of this product required RecA, RecBCD, SSB, gyrase, and the Pol III HE (Fig. 1B). Two additional products were apparent when the HE was omitted from the reaction mixture (Fig. 1B, lane 2). The electrophoretic mobility of these products corresponded to that of the plasmid DNA (Fig. 1B, form I-D loop) and to a band that ran faster than the plasmid DNA (Fig. 1B, form X). The presence of SSB inhibited the formation of form X (Fig. 1B, compare lanes 2 and 4). The nature of the [32P]DNA in these products was investigated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (Fig. 2). A lane excised from a native agarose gel displaying the products of a reaction mixture containing the 5′-32P-labeled 800-mer, pBRχ-1, RecA, RecBCD, SSB, gyrase, and the HE was soaked in 50 mm NaOH to denature the DNA products and inserted into a second, alkaline agarose gel (Fig. 2). For reference, another lane from the initial native agarose gel that displayed the products of the reaction is shown at the top of Fig. 2. pBRχ-1 DNA is 6.5 kb in length. Thus, as is clear from Fig. 2, the majority of the elongated product corresponded to full-length DNA, indicating that the joint molecules consisted of D loops incorporating all of the invading strand and that the HE was able to use the invading strand as a primer and extend it all the way around the template DNA. Note that this full-length product could not be the consequence of replication of pBRχ-1 DNA that had initiated at either of the two origins of replication on the plasmid. Initiation from the pBR322 origin requires RNA polymerase (23.Itoh T. Tomizawa J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 2450-2454Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar), whereas initiation from E. coli oriCrequires DnaA (24.Kaguni J.M. Kornberg A. Cell. 1984; 38: 183-190Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), neither of which were included in the reactions. Neither of the other two products of the reaction contained elongated DNA. Form I-D loop contained a mixture of full-length and digested 800-mer. This was consistent with our assignment in that both χ-dependent and χ-independent joint molecules could form during the reaction. Because gyrase is present in the reaction mixture, although the formation of the D loop itself will relax the plasmid DNA (because the pBRχ-1 DNA is unwound), the plasmid DNA in the joint molecules can become negatively supercoiled. This will also tend to stabilize the D loop present on the plasmid DNA. Also visible on the two-dimensional gel was 800-mer that had neither been digested nor incorporated into joint molecules. The band that we labeled form X contained primarily 800-mer. The mobility of form X on native agarose gels (Fig. 1B) indicated that it had a superhelical density that was considerably greater than that of the input plasmid DNA. The enzymatic requirements for the generation of form X were therefore investigated (Fig. 3). The formation of form X required only RecA and gyrase. These requirements and the highly supercoiled nature of the plasmid DNA indicated that the generation of form X occurred via the reaction pathway observed by Shibata and colleagues (25.Iwabuchi M. Shibata T. Ohtani T. Natori M. Ando T. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 12394-12404Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) during their studies of the D loop cycle catalyzed by RecA. Using small oligonucleotides as the invading strand in the presence of RecA and various topoisomerases, these investigators observed the appearance of highly supercoiled form X DNA. In their case, the invading strand was no longer present in the form X product. It is present in the product reported here because the greater length of the invading strand used stabilizes the D loop. Shibata and colleagues (25.Iwabuchi M. Shibata T. Ohtani T. Natori M. Ando T. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 12394-12404Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) hypothesized that extensive RecA filament formation extending from the D loop into the duplex portion of the plasmid caused unwinding of the plasmid DNA. Extensive unwinding generates compensatory positive supercoils that DNA gyrase will convert directly to negative supercoils. Following removal of the proteins from the DNA, it will assume the hyper-supercoiled form reported here (form X). Thus, either joint molecules or form X could be the substrate for the observed DNA synthesis reaction. We therefore investigated this issue. Reactions were executed in two stages (Fig. 4). During the first stage, either joint molecules were first generated in the presence of RecA, RecBCD, and SSB (Fig. 4, lanes 1–3) or form X was first generated in the presence of RecA, RecBCD, and gyrase (Fig. 4, lanes 4–6). In the second stage, the reaction mixtures were supplemented with either the HE and gyrase (Fig. 4, lanes 1–3) or the HE and SSB (Fig. 4, lanes 4–6). Only in the case where joint molecules were formed in the first stage could elongated product be observed in the second stage. Although there was a small amount of elongated product present in the reaction in which form X was formed first and then HE was added (Fig. 4, lane 6), it most likely arose from the equivalent amount of χ-independent joint molecules that accumulated during form X formation (Fig. 4, lane 4). Thus, we conclude that the substrate for HE-catalyzed elongation was a joint molecule formed by the action of RecA and RecBCD and not a highly supercoiled DNA that contained a D loop. Because form X could be generated in the reaction, we considered the possibility that RecA might, in some manner, be acting as a DNA helicase to allow the elongation of the invading strand, perhaps as a result of treadmilling of the filament. To address this question, joint molecules were formed in the presence of RecA, RecBCD, and SSB, and the proteins were then removed by digestion with proteinase K in the presence of SDS followed by isolation of the joint molecules by gel filtration through a Bio-Gel A-5m column. Elongation of the invading strand in these isolated joint molecules required only the HE, gyrase, and SSB (Fig. 5). Some partially elongated material could be observed in the absence of SSB (Fig. 5, lane 3). In addition, in the presence of HE, gyrase, and SSB, elongated product with a lower mobility than the full-length product could be observed. Two-dimensional gel analysis has shown that this elongated product corresponds to DNA that is greater than unit template length (data not shown), presumably produced by rolling circle-type replication. Thus, the requirement for RecA observed with the concerted reaction in Fig. 1B related only to the requirement that joint molecules must be made before any polymerase-catalyzed elongation of the invading strand could take place and not to the involvement of RecA in the elongation process itself. How, then, was DNA unwinding being driven given that no DNA helicase was involved in the replication reaction? The most likely possibility was that we were observing a slow strand displacement reaction in which the DNA was being unwound by a combination of the DNA being kept negatively supercoiled by the action of DNA gyrase, which will favor unwinding, and SSB binding to the displaced single-stranded DNA that is generated as the polymerase slowly pushes forward. We would expect that in such a reaction, there would not be any specificity for the DNA polymerase, that elongation would be slow, and that other topoisomerases that could relax the positive supercoils generated by the unwinding would not be able to support the elongation reaction because they could not supercoil the DNA template. These predictions were tested directly. Both Sequenase (Fig. 6A), a version of the bacteriophage T7 DNA polymerase, as well as E. coli DNA polymerase I (data not shown) could substitute for the HE in the reaction. Thus, it was unlikely that elongation of the invading strand in the joint molecule required any specific interaction between the DNA polymerase and either RecA, RecBCD, or SSB. To measure the speed of the elongation reaction, aliquots were removed from the reaction mixture starting from the beginning of the reaction, and the products were analyzed on denaturing alkaline agarose gels (Fig. 6B). The trailing edge of the smear present in the lanes in Fig. 6B represents the longest elongated invading strands at that time point; thus the speed of elongation can be assessed by observing the change in the size of the largest products as a function of time. It required about 90 s to produce full-length material, giving an elongation speed of about 70 nt/s. This is far slower than the 700–1000 nt/s that we have measured for bona fide replication forks in vitro (26.Mok M. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16644-16654Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and is therefore consistent with the progress of a strand displacement reaction. Elongation of the invading strand in the joint molecule all the way around the circular template creates positive linkages as a result of the unwinding of the parental duplex DNA. If a DNA helicase were driving the elongation reaction, the production of full-length product DNA would require only that the excess positive linkages be removed by a topoisomerase such as topoisomerase IV, which can relax both negatively and positively supercoiled DNA but cannot supercoil DNA (21.Hiasa H. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21529-21535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). We have shown, for example, that this enzyme is capable of supporting oriC replication in vitro (27.Hiasa H. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16371-16375Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, topoisomerase IV was unable to replace gyrase in elongation reactions using isolated joint molecules (Fig. 7). This test had to be performed in this manner because in the concerted reaction, topoisomerase IV would relax the pBRχ-1 DNA and inhibit joint molecule formation. Thus, we conclude that the observed elongation reaction represents a generalized strand displacement DNA synthesis reaction that utilizes the invading strand in the joint molecules as a primer and is driven by negative supercoiling. In the presence of ATP, RecA filaments assemble and disassemble in the same direction (28.Lindsley J.E. Cox M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9043-9054Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29.Bork J.M. Cox M.M. Inman R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45740-45743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), indicating that the filament grows at one end and disassembles at the other. Structural analysis of RecA bound to DNA suggests that access to the terminus of the invading strand is likely to be restricted sterically (30.Egelman E.H. Yu X. Science. 1989; 245: 404-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Thus, clearance of the RecA filament from the region of the template DNA containing the terminus of the invading strand might be required in order for a DNA polymerase to find the 3′-end of the invading strand. To examine this possibility, we used conditions known to stabilize the RecA filament and assessed their effect on the ability to generate elongated product (Fig. 8). RecA K72R is a mutant RecA protein that can only utilize dATP to support strand exchange, and evidence indicates that a filament formed by the mutant protein is more stable than one formed by the wild-type protein in the presence of ATP (31.Rehrauer W.M. Kowalczykowski S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1292-1297Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32.Shan Q. Cox M.M. Inman R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5712-5724Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Similarly, dATP stabilizes the filament formed by the wild-type protein (33.Menetski J.P. Kowalczykowski S.C. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 5871-5881Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 34.Shan Q. Bork J.M. Webb B.L. Inman R.B. Cox M.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 265: 519-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). As expected, RecA K72R could only form joint molecules in the presence of dATP (Fig. 8, compare lanes 4 and 10), whereas the wild-type protein worked in the presence of either ATP or dATP (Fig. 8, comparelanes 1 and 7). The wild-type protein could only support the formation of elongated product in the presence of ATP (Fig. 8, compare lanes 3 and 9). The mutant protein was unable to support the formation of elongated product in the presence of dATP (Fig. 8, lane 12). Although there are other ATP-utilizing enzymes present in the reaction, the failure to observe elongated product in the presence of dATP could be attributed directly to an altered property of RecA. Initiation complex formation by the HE proceeds equally well in the presence of either ATP or dATP (35.Burgers P.M.J. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 11468-11473Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and supercoiling by DNA gyrase is supported about a third as well by dATP as by ATP (36.Gellert M. Mizuuchi K. O'Dea M.H. Nash H.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 3872-3876Crossref PubMed Scopus (872) Google Scholar). To compensate for this latter deficiency, the concentration of gyrase in the reaction was increased 5-fold. Thus, it appeared that if the RecA filament was stabilized, the HE could not access the 3′-end of the invading strand in the joint molecules. To confirm that it was the stability of the RecA filament that was the variable under these reaction conditions, we developed an assay to test access to DNA coated with a RecA filament. An oligonucleotide substrate was designed that was a 40-nt duplex with anRsaI site in the middle of the duplex and that had a 5′-single-stranded tail of 25 nt. Thus, the RecA filament assembly will nucleate on the single strand and spread onto the duplex portion of the oligonucleotide. We assessed inhibition of digestion by RsaI of the duplex portion of the oligonucleotide under the various conditions used in the experiment described in the legend for Fig. 8. After allowing filament formation to reach an equilibrium,RsaI was added, and digestion of the oligonucleotide was followed over time (Fig. 9). In the absence of RecA, cleavage of the oligonucleotide was rapid, and the reaction was complete 2–3 min after addition of RsaI. Filament formation by wild-type RecA in the presence of ATP slowed the rate of cleavage by RsaI but, notably, it did not prevent it. On the other hand, filament formation by either the wild-type or the K72R protein in the presence of dATP prevented cleavage by the restriction enzyme. These findings are consistent with the data presented in Fig. 8. Thus, a dynamic RecA filament permits access to DNA that it is nominally bound to, presumably, in the case of the experiment shown in Fig. 9, because the cycles of assembly and disassembly that describe the equilibrium position leave theRsaI site uncoated for a certain fraction of time. In the elongation reaction from joint molecules, the equivalent action would result in clearance of the RecA filament from the terminus of the invading strand in the D loop and allow the 3′-OH to be detected and elongated by a DNA polymerase. The intersection between the recombination and replication machinery is now well established in prokaryotes and is being revealed in eukaryotes. During recombinational repair of stalled replication forks in bacteria, recombination proteins often act to generate substrates for replication restart. The situation therefore arises in which a recombination intermediate is poised to proceed along a pathway of maturation and resolution that is dictated by the enzymatic specificities of either recombination or replication proteins. Thus, a D loop formed, for example, between the broken and intact sister arms of a replicating circular bacterial chromosome could yield extensive strand exchange by the continued action of RecA and by the additional action of the branch migration DNA helicase RuvAB. On the other hand, the same D loop could become a substrate for replisome assembly directed by the restart primosome. We report here a third possibility, that the invading strand in the joint molecule can be used as a primer by a DNA polymerase in a strand displacement reaction that is driven by negative supercoiling. The DNA replication reaction that we observed uses joint molecules formed by the action of RecA and RecBCD as a template. The reaction drew our attention initially because, in the absence of a DNA helicase, full-length DNA was being synthesized by the Pol III HE, which is nominally incapable of strand displacement synthesis (37.O'Donnell M.E. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 12884-12889Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Using various oligonucleotide substrates where a primer was annealed upstream to a duplex region, we confirmed that the HE was, indeed, incapable of strand displacement synthesis (data not shown). These observations implied that during the extension of the invading strand in the joint molecules, the unwinding of the template duplex was achieved by novel means. The fact that a highly unwound form of the plasmid DNA, form X, could also be generated in the reaction raised the possibility that the same driving force for form X production, the unwinding of the DNA by the RecA filament (38.Ohtani T. Shibata T. Iwabuchi M. Watabe H. Iino T. Ando T. Nature. 1982; 299: 86-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), might also be capable of sustaining the DNA replication reaction. However, although it was clear that RecA was required initially in the reaction to catalyze the formation of joint molecules, we found that it could be eliminated from the elongation reaction without effect. This observation left us to consider that superhelicity was driving the unwinding needed for elongation. Elongation of the invading strand in the joint molecules creates positive windings in the template DNA that compensate for the unwinding of the parental duplex strands. Accrual of excess positive windings will prevent additional template unwinding and stall DNA replication. Topoisomerases are responsible for sustaining DNA replication on topologically constrained templates by relaxing the positive windings. Both DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV are capable of relaxing positive supercoils, but only DNA gyrase was capable of supporting the elongation reaction. We have to attribute this difference to the fact that gyrase, but not topoisomerase IV, can also supercoil DNA. In fact, during the elongation reaction, gyrase will convert the positive supercoils directly into negative ones. Therefore, with gyrase present, the template DNA will retain a net negative supercoiling. Supercoiled DNA prefers to exist in the relaxed state, in which there are no supercoils. Thus, negative supercoils favor the unwinding of the duplex turns in the DNA molecule. This tendency likely acts as a driving force for the unwinding of the duplex template DNA during the elongation reaction. However, it clearly does not provide sufficient energy for the process because SSB is also required. In the absence of SSB, only partial elongation was observed. We presume that the energy of SSB binding cooperatively to single-stranded DNA at the fork contributes to the unwinding reaction. Although the requirement for RecA in the concerted elongation reaction derives from the need to first make a joint molecule, it is clear, because form X can be produced in the same reaction, that an extensive RecA filament can form on the duplex template DNA. At first glance, it would seem that the RecA filament would actually represent an impediment to any DNA replication reaction seeking to utilize the joint molecule as a substrate, suggesting that the tendency would be for the joint molecule to continue on a pathway dictated by the recombination proteins. However, it is clear that the joint molecules can be directed into a replication pathway as well. We investigated the role that RecA plays in this pathway choice. We could demonstrate that, in fact, if the RecA filament was formed under conditions in which it was stabilized, the extension of the invading strand in the joint molecule was prevented. Thus, the dynamic nature of the RecA filament allows it to clear from the region of heteroduplex in a joint molecule. This clearance, in turn, allows subsequent reactions to occur on the joint molecules, permitting a choice of enzymatic pathway for resolution. It is particularly interesting that because RecA filaments assemble and disassemble in the same direction, 5′ → 3′, clearance occurs in a manner that specifically encourages subsequent DNA replication that uses the 3′-end of the invading strand as a primer for leading-strand synthesis. Does the reaction described here play a role in the cell? This issue is difficult to assess. Any form of extensive replication from recombination intermediates, be it the result of bona fidereplisome assembly or strand displacement synthesis, within the context of double-strand break repair between sister chromosomes is genetically silent. Detection requires the creation of specifically marked chromosome arms and the use of physical analysis. It is, however, interesting to point out that in one of the few cases in which recombination-directed replication has been studied carefully, a reaction similar to the one described here may be operative. Haber and his colleagues (39.Kraus E. Leung W.Y. Haber J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8255-8262Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar) have carefully analyzed break-induced replication (BIR) in yeast originating at the mating type locus as a result of HO endonuclease-catalyzed cleavage of the DNA. Normally, BIR is limited, probably because of the formation of a second Holliday junction that acts to capture the replication fork, to a small region about the site of cleavage. However, rare events can be observed in which BIR is quite extensive (hundreds of kilobases long). Two genetic pathways have been delineated that differ by their dependence on Rad51. However, in each case, although it can be demonstrated that many of the proteins present at the replication fork, such as polα/primase, polδ, proliferating cell nuclear antigen, and replication protein A, are required for BIR, there is no indication that a helicase is required for the reaction. These observations are consistent with the type of strand displacement synthesis described here."
https://openalex.org/W1970924050,"The folding of a model native-like dimeric four-helix bundle protein, (α2)2, was investigated using guanidine hydrochloride, hydrostatic pressure, and low temperature. Unfolding by guanidine hydrochloride followed by circular dichroism and intrinsic fluorescence spectroscopy revealed a highly cooperative transition between the native-like and unfolded states, with free energy of unfolding determined from CD data, ΔG unf = 14.3 ± 0.8 kcal/mol. However, CD and intrinsic fluorescence data were not superimposable, indicating the presence of an intermediate state during the folding transition. To stabilize the folding intermediate, we used hydrostatic pressure and low temperature. In both cases, dissociation of the dimeric native-like (α2)2 into folded monomers (α2) was observed. van't Hoff analysis of the low temperature experiments, assuming a two-state dimer 171-monomer transition, yielded a free energy of dissociation of (α2)2 of ΔG diss = 11.4 ± 0.4 kcal/mol, in good agreement with the free energy determined from pressure dissociation experiments (ΔG diss = 10.5 ± 0.1 kcal/mol). Binding of the hydrophobic fluorescent probe 4,4′-dianilino-1,1′-binaphthyl-5,5′-disulfonic acid (bis-ANS) to the pressure- and cold-dissociated states of (α2)2 indicated the existence of molten-globule monomers.

In conclusion, we demonstrate that the folding pathway of (α2)2 can be described by a three-state transition including a monomeric molten globule-like state. Understanding the transition of a polypeptide from a large ensemble of conformations to a well ordered three-dimensional structure is of fundamental importance to many areas of biochemistry and molecular biology. Of particular interest are the energetics governing the interplay of forces during the folding of proteins. One approach to address this issue is the de novo design of proteins (1.DeGrado W.F. Raleigh D.P. Handel T. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1991; 1: 984-993Crossref Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Novel proteins made up of non-native amino acid sequences are intended to adopt predetermined folds and provide detailed information on the underlying thermodynamics. A common target for protein design has been the four-helix bundle motif, in which four α-helices pack against each other roughly lengthwise. This motif is encountered in numerous natural proteins such as interleukin-2 (2.Rozwarski D.A. Gronenborn A.M. Clore G.M. Bazan J.F. Bohm A. Wlodawer A. Hatada M. Karlus P.A. Structure. 1994; 2: 159-173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), apolipoprotein (3.Wilson C. Mau T. Weisgraber K.H. Wardell M.R. Mahley R.W. Agard D.A.

Science. 1992; 255: 306-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (2023) Google Scholar). It is also functionally diverse, ranging from RNA binding to polysaccharide cleavage in T4 lysozyme (5.Matthews B.W. Weaver L.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 193: 189-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar) and electron transfer in cytochrome b 562 (6.Lederer F. Glatigny A. Bethge P.H. Bellamy H.D. Mathews F.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1981; 148: 427-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The design of four-helix bundle proteins is, in most attempts, based on amphiphilic secondary structure, leading to partitioning of nonpolar and polar amino acids into the interior and surface of the protein, respectively (7.Kamtekar, S., and Hecht, M. H. (1995) FASEB J.1013–1022Google Scholar). Such a designed four-helix bundle protein, (α2)2, has recently been described and used as a template for anesthetic binding studies (8.Johansson J.S. Gibney B.R. Rabanal F. Reddy K.S. Dutton P.L. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 1421-1429Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The last decade has witnessed an increasing number of studies using hydrostatic pressure (9.Jaenicke R. Lilie H. Adv. Protein Chem. 2000; 53: 329-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), low temperature (10.Privalov P.L. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1990; 25: 281-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (810) Google Scholar), or a combination of both to investigate the energetics and kinetics of folding and subunit interactions of various single or multidomain proteins. These studies have provided detailed characterization of thermodynamic parameters and provided a platform for the understanding of structure-energy relationships. Very recently, we have reported the use of hydrostatic pressure and low temperature in the characterization of partially folded intermediates of a monomeric de novo designed three-helix bundle protein (α3-1) (11.Chapeaurouge A. Johansson J.S. Ferreira S.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14861-14866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In the present work, we describe the effects of guanidine hydrochloride, pressure, and low temperature on the subunit association/folding of (α2)2 and determine the apparent thermodynamic parameters. The independent use of different perturbants (pressure and temperature) caused reversible dissociation of (α2)2 and allowed us to put forward a folding mechanism for the protein. Studies of binding of bis-ANS 1The abbreviations used are: bis-ANS4,4′-dianilino-1,1′-binaphthyl-5,5′-disulfonic acidGdnHClguanidine hydrochloride revealed that the pressure- or cold-dissociated state (α2, folded monomers) has characteristics of a molten globule. We propose that the folding process initially results in such species, which subsequently assemble to the native-like dimeric state. 4,4′-dianilino-1,1′-binaphthyl-5,5′-disulfonic acid guanidine hydrochloride All reagents were of the highest analytical grade available. Distilled water was filtered and deionized through a Millipore water purification system. Bis-ANS was from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). The design and synthesis of (α2)2 has been described previously (8.Johansson J.S. Gibney B.R. Rabanal F. Reddy K.S. Dutton P.L.

Each monomer consists of a 62-amino acid residue peptide composed of two 27-residue α-helices and a glycine linker region of eight residues. The amino acid sequence of an individual chain of (α2)2 is given in Table I in single-letter codes; the heptad repeat assignments, a through g, used to design amphiphilic α-helices are shown above the first 8 amino acid residues.Table IAmino acid sequence of an individual chain of (α2)2 Open table in a new tab The end charges are neutralized to stabilize helix formation; the amino terminus is acetylated (Ac) and the carboxyl terminus is amidated. The single tryptophan residue (Trp-15) is placed in a largely solvent-inaccessible pocket (8.Johansson J.S. Gibney B.R. Rabanal F. Reddy K.S. Dutton P.L. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 1421-1429Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), which is consistent with its fluorescence properties (peak maximum at about 327 nm). Unless otherwise indicated, fluorescence emission spectra were measured at 25 °C on an ISS PC-1 spectrofluorometer (ISS Inc., Champaign, IL). For intrinsic fluorescence measurements, excitation was at 280 nm, and emission spectra were recorded from 300 to 420 nm. Bis-ANS fluorescence was measured with excitation at 375 nm and emission from 420 to 600 nm. Paladini and Weber (14.Paladini A.A. Weber G. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 2587-2593Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar) equipped with sapphire optical windows performed fluorescence measurements under pressure using a pressure cell similar to that originally described. The temperature of the pressure cell was controlled by means of a jacket connected to a circulating bath and was monitored by a telethermometer. All experiments are representative of at least three experiments performed with different preparations of (α2)2 and were carried out in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 130 mm NaCl. Protein concentration was determined using ε280 = 5,700 m−1cm−1. Unless otherwise indicated, protein concentration was 1 μm (expressed in dimers), and bis-ANS concentration, when used, was 1 μm. Sample buffers were saturated with nitrogen prior to the experiments. In low temperature experiments, the sapphire windows of the pressure cell were flushed with nitrogen to prevent water condensation. Fluorescence spectral centers of mass (intensity-weighted average emission wavelengths, λavg) were calculated with software provided by ISS Inc. asλavg=ΣλI(λ)/ΣI(λ)Equation 1 where λ is the emission wavelength and I(λ) represents the fluorescence intensity at wavelength λ. Shifts in spectral center of mass were converted into extent of dissociation (αp) at each pressure according to the relationship,αp=1/[1+Q(λp−λU)/λN−λp)]Equation 2 where λN and λU are the spectral centers of mass of native-like and monomeric protein, respectively, λp is the spectral center of mass at pressurep, and Q is the ratio of the spectral areas of dissociated and native-like (α2)2. CD measurements were carried out on a Jasco J-715 spectropolarimeter connected to a circulating bath, using an 0.2-cm path-length quartz cell. Gel filtration experiments were carried out using a G2000SW TosoHaas column (7.5 mm inner diameter × 30 cm, 10 μm particle size). The flow rate was 0.5 ml/min with eluting buffer pressure of 100 p.s.i. Absorption detection (λ = 280 nm) was employed. Fig. 1 shows the pressure-induced red shift of the intrinsic fluorescence spectral center of mass of (α2)2 at different concentrations (1 μm (●) and 8 μm (○)). As expected for the dissociation of a dimer, the curve at the higher protein concentration is displaced to higher pressure relative to the curve at the lower protein concentration. The pressure-induced transition exhibited a clearly defined plateau at about 346 nm for both protein concentrations. It is important to note that fully unfolded (α2)2 (i.e. in the presence of 6m GdnHCl) exhibited a much more red-shifted fluorescence emission with a spectral center of mass at 355 nm (Fig. 2). Upon stepwise release of pressure, the fluorescence spectra underwent a blue shift and reached complete recovery of the spectral center of mass at atmospheric pressure (data not shown). These results indicate that pressure induces reversible dissociation of (α2)2 to partially folded monomers.Figure 2GdnHCl unfolding of (α2)2 followed by the red shift in intrinsic fluorescence emission (○) and CD spectroscopy (▴). The degree of unfolding (α) was calculated as described under “Experimental Procedures” (inset).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The pressure dissociation data for (α2)2 were analyzed using a thermodynamic model for dimer dissociation. The equilibrium dissociation constant at atmospheric pressure (K 0) and the molar volume change of dissociation (ΔV diss) can be calculated from the following thermodynamic relationship,KP=K0 exp(−pΔVdiss/RT)Equation 3 where K p is the dissociation constant at pressure p, and R and T have their usual meanings. The equation can be rewritten by introducing the degree of dissociation, α, at pressure p,ln(α2/(1­α))=ln(K0/4C0)−p(ΔV/RT)Equation 4 where ln(α2/(1−α)) equals ln(K0/4C0) for the dissociation of a dimer. Thus, a plot of ln(α2/(1-α))versus pressure (Fig. 1, lower panel) yields the molar volume change of dissociation (ΔV diss) from the slope and lnK 0 from the intercept on the ordinate. The parameters obtained for pressure dissociation of (α2)2 are summarized in Table II.Table IIThermodynamic parameters of dissociation/denaturation of (α2)2GdnHCl denaturationPressure dissociationCold dissociationΔG unf = 14.3 ± 0.8 kcal/mol2-aData are from Ref.8.ΔV 0= −57 ± 5 ml/molΔH diss = −44.9 ± 0.5 kcal/molm = 2.0 ± 0.2 (kcal/mol · m)ΔG diss = 10.5 ± 0.1 kcal/mol2-bFrom the relationship, ΔG = −RT lnK 0,T = 298 K.TΔS diss= −56.3 ± 0.6 kcal/molΔG diss = 11.4 ± 0.4 kcal/mol2-a Data are from Ref.8.Johansson J.S.

Open table in a new tab As noted above, at higher protein concentration (8 μm) the midpoint of the transition was displaced toward higher pressure relative to the curve obtained with 1 μm protein. For the dissociation of a dimer, the molar volume change of dissociation (ΔV diss) can be used to calculate the predicted displacement of the pressure dissociation curve (Δp 50) with protein concentration.Δp=(RT/ΔVdiss)ln(C2/C1)Equation 5 where C 2 and C 1 are the two concentrations of (α2)2 used (15.Rietveld A.W.M. Ferreira S.T. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7743-7751Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The Δp 50 value of 760 bar thus calculated is in very good agreement with the experimentally determined Δp 50 of 640 bar (Fig. 1, arrow), further indicating that the pressure transition reflects the dissociation of the dimeric (α2)2 helical bundle protein into monomers. The equilibrium unfolding of (α2)2 induced by increasing concentrations of GdnHCl was monitored by intrinsic fluorescence and CD spectroscopy (Fig. 2). Unfolding was accompanied by a marked red shift of the fluorescence emission (from 337 to 355 nm in the spectral center of mass), indicating a transition of the single tryptophan residue (Trp-15) from a hydrophobic environment in the interior of the protein to the polar aqueous medium. For comparison, Fig. 2 also shows data on the unfolding of (α2)2 monitored by far-UV CD measurements (222 nm). Both curves indicate highly cooperative unfolding transitions. However, the midpoints of the curves are clearly different, i.e., ∼2.4 and 3.5 mwhen the transition was monitored by fluorescence and CD measurements, respectively. This type of behavior is characteristic of the existence of folding intermediates (i.e., a non-two state transition (16.Privalov P.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 258: 707-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar)) and indicates that changes in the tertiary structure of (α2)2 take place at lower concentrations of GdnHCl than changes in secondary structure. Of interest is the comparison with the pressure dissociation data shown in Fig. 1. The pressure dissociation curves (Fig. 1) level off at about 346 nm, which corresponds to 50% of the total fluorescence shift observed upon complete unfolding of (α2)2 at high concentrations of GdnHCl. Furthermore, GdnHCl-induced changes in the CD of (α2)2 only begin to take place at GdnHCl concentrations above 2.5 m when the unfolding of (α2)2 monitored by intrinsic fluorescence has already reached about 50% (α = 0.5) (Fig. 2). Taken together, these observations suggest that low concentrations of GdnHCl (<2.5m) promote dissociation of (α2)2, resulting in a shift in spectral center of mass to ∼ 346 nm, followed by unfolding of the dissociated subunits at >2.5m GdnHCl (with a further fluorescence red shift to ∼355 nm and loss of the CD signal). To further characterize the existence of a folding intermediate of (α2)2, we carried out low temperature unfolding experiments followed by fluorescence and CD spectroscopy. Fig. 3 shows the fluorescence spectral centers of mass (●) and ellipticity [θ]222 (▾) of (α2)2 as a function of decreasing temperature. Although the fluorescence curve reveals a red shift in the spectral center of mass, the CD data did not change with temperature. Therefore, it can be concluded that low temperature only disturbs the tertiary structure of (α2)2 while the helices remain intact. The fluorescence curve reaches a plateau at about 1 °C, indicating a stable partially folded intermediate. After return of the sample to room temperature the fluorescence spectral center of mass returned to the original value, reflecting the reversibility of the process (Δ). Interestingly, the fluorescence spectra of the state stabilized at low temperature and the pressure-dissociated protein (Fig. 1) level off at about the same spectral center of mass (∼346 nm; Fig. 4), suggesting that a similar, dissociated state of (α2)2 is populated at low temperatures or at high pressure.Figure 4Fluorescence emission spectra of native-like (curve 1), pressure-dissociated (curve 2), cold-dissociated (curve 3), and fully unfolded (α2)2 in the presence of 6 m GdnHCl (curve 4).Pressure dissociation was obtained by increasing the pressure at 25 °C (see Fig. 1). Cold dissociation was carried out by decreasing the temperature to −3 °C at atmospheric pressure (see Fig. 3). Spectra are normalized for maximal emission intensity.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) At constant pressure the temperature dependence of the equilibrium constant is described by the van't Hoff equation,ΔG/T=(1/T)ΔH−ΔS=RlnKTEquation 6 where K T is the equilibrium constant for dissociation at temperature T and ΔG is the Gibbs free energy change of association. From a plot of ΔG/T versus the inverse temperature, the changes in enthalpy (ΔH) and entropy (ΔS) of dissociation can be extracted (Fig. 3, lower panel). The thermodynamic parameters obtained from such analysis are summarized in Table II. The environment-sensitive fluorescent dye bis-ANS was used to characterize the partially folded, monomeric state of (α2)2. Bis-ANS binds to hydrophobic domains of proteins (17.York S.S. Lawson R.C. Worah D.M. Biochemistry. 1978; 21: 4480-4486Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Upon non-covalent binding to such domains, the two naphthyl rings of the bis-ANS molecule become oriented in parallel, which brings about a significant increase in fluorescence quantum yield. Therefore, it is a sensitive probe to detect so called “molten globule” states of proteins, in which secondary structural elements are established, but the packing of the side chains in the hydrophobic core is not yet complete, giving rise to a fluctuating globular structure (18.Ptitsyn O.B. Creighton T.E. Protein Folding. W. H. Freeman and Co., New York1992: 243-300Google Scholar). Fig. 5 shows increased binding of bis-ANS to the dissociated state of (α2)2 (trace c) compared with the native-like dimeric state (trace b), whereas the completely denatured protein (i.e. in the presence of 6m GdnHCl, trace a) showed no binding. The increase in quantum yield of bis-ANS fluorescence upon binding to pressure-dissociated or cold-dissociated (α2)2 is about the same (2.3-fold for pressure dissociation and 2.2-fold for cold dissociation; Fig. 5). In addition, the intrinsic fluorescence emission undergoes, in both cases, an identical red shift, reaching a plateau at about 346 nm (Fig. 4,curves 2 and 3). Furthermore, the Gibbs free energy of dissociation determined from both experiments is in very good agreement (Table II). Taken together, these results indicate that hydrostatic pressure and low temperature stabilize a similar, but not necessarily the same dissociated state of (α2)2. To examine the monomeric state of (α2)2 during unfolding induced by GdnHCl, we used sized exclusion chromatography at different GdnHCl concentrations. In the absence of GdnHCl, (α2)2 eluted with a retention time of 16.8 min, corresponding to a molecular mass of about 18,000 Da as compared with globular protein standards (Fig. 6 A). The slightly higher determined molecular mass of (α2)2 can be explained by its molecular shape, which is most likely cylinder-like rather than globular (8.Johansson J.S. Gibney B.R. Rabanal F. Reddy K.S. Dutton P.L. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 1421-1429Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In the presence of 2.5 m GdnHCl, the major peak is characterized by a retention time of 21.1 min, corresponding to a molecular mass of 6500 Da, in the expected mass range of the monomeric dissociated state of (α2)2 (Fig. 6 B). In addition, the chromatogram shows a second peak at 15.4 min, which most likely represents the fully unfolded hydrated monomers with an expanded Stokes radius. This result indicates that, at 2.5 m GdnHCl, the main peak corresponding to α2 monomers is in equilibrium with a smaller fraction of fully unfolded monomers. In essence, gel filtration experiments at different GdnHCl concentrations strongly support the view that (α2)2 unfolds via a monomeric intermediate state, which has also been stabilized by hydrostatic pressure and low temperature. In this work, we describe the use of hydrostatic pressure and low temperature to stabilize the dissociated molten globule-like state of ade novo designed four-helix bundle protein, (α2)2. These studies allowed us to suggest a folding mechanism for the protein. The foundation of our thermodynamic analysis lies in the observation that the dissociation curves are completely reversible, showing no hysteresis using either pressure or temperature as a perturbant of the equilibrium of subunit association of (α2)2. Pressure dissociation enabled the determination of the molar volume change and the free energy change of subunit dissociation of (α2)2. The volume changes upon pressure dissociation of a variety of dimeric proteins have been reported. Of note is that the specific volume change, obtained by normalizing the molar volume change to the molecular weight of the dimer, is much larger in small dimers than in larger ones. For example, Arc repressor, a small DNA-binding protein (molecular mass = 13,000 Da) shows a specific volume change of 7.7 μl/g, whereas enolase, an 80-kDa dimeric protein, gives rise to a specific volume change of 0.7 μl/g (15.Rietveld A.W.M. Ferreira S.T. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7743-7751Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). A possible explanation for these observations is that in smaller proteins the subunit interface involves a more extended area of the whole molecule compared with larger proteins. Therefore, upon dissociation a larger fraction of formerly buried amino acid residues is exposed to the solvent and brings about an enhanced specific volume change due to the electrostriction of water molecules. The specific volume change of 4.1 μl/g determined here for (α2)2 (molecular mass ∼13,700 Da) compares well with the above mentioned values for native proteins. Cold denaturation of proteins has been studied extensively over the last decade (see Refs. 10.Privalov P.L. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1990; 25: 281-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (810) Google Scholar, 19.Silva J.L. Weber G. Annu. Rev. Phys. Chem. 1993; 44: 89-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar, and 20.Richardson J.M. Lemaire S.D. Jacquot J.P. Makhatadze G.I. Biochemistry. 2000; 36: 11154-11162Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar and references therein). The fact that proteins unfold at a low temperature has been attributed to the solvation of hydrophobic side chains, for which the Gibbs free energy is negative and increases in magnitude as the temperature is lowered. Thus, the nonpolar groups of the polypeptide chain, mainly responsible for the conformational stability, become exposed to the solvent at low temperatures and cause the protein to denature. Subunit dissociation at low temperatures has been reported for a variety of dimers such as yeast hexokinase (21.Ruan K. Weber G. Biochemistry. 1988; 29: 3295-3301Crossref Scopus (80) Google Scholar) and phosphorylase A (22.Ruan K. Weber G. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 6293-6301Crossref Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In these studies, the enthalpy change upon association (ΔH a) was found to be positive, which would thereby promote the dissociation into monomers. However, the entropy term (TΔS a) was also positive but larger than the enthalpic contribution, resulting in an overall negative free energy of association (ΔG a). A similar situation was found for (α2)2 (Table II). The entropy term compensates the unfavorable enthalpy by about 10 kcal/mol at room temperature and is responsible for the stability of the helical bundle. Because changes in entropy during the folding process are attributed to changes in hydrophobic interactions, the dimerization of (α2)2 can thus be interpreted in terms of a hydrophobic collapse of nonpolar side chains. The hydrophobic probe bis-ANS has been frequently used to detect molten globule folding intermediates. The conformational changes of (α2)2 upon pressure and temperature perturbation reveal the existence of a molten globule-like state, with significant increases in bis-ANS binding (Fig. 5). Very similar results have been reported for Arc repressor. Pressure dissociation studies of that small dimer monitored by tryptophan fluorescence and1H-NMR revealed the stabilization of monomers. Based on bis-ANS binding and fluorescence anisotropy measurements, the authors concluded that the pressure-dissociated monomers are molten globules (23.Silva J.L. Silveira C.F. Correia A. Pontes L. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 223: 545-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 24.Peng X. Jonas J. Silva J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1776-1780Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the native state of Arc repressor binds a certain amount of bis-ANS similar to the native-like state of (α2)2. The folding mechanism of the DNA-binding protein HU (19.5 kDa), structurally related to the Arc repressor, has been investigated using electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (25.Vis H. Heinemann U. Dobson C.M. Robinson C.V. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 6427-6428Crossref Scopus (56) Google Scholar); these authors concluded that folding of the intertwined dimer proceeds via a monomeric intermediate. Based on the pressure and low temperature studies presented here, the folding of (α2)2 can be summarized as depicted in Fig. 7. Interestingly, (α2)2 gains most of its conformational stability from the association of the two monomers (α2). Studies of the dissociation and unfolding of dimeric triose-phosphate isomerase also showed that the protein is stabilized mainly by the association of the monomers (26.Rietveld A.W.M. Ferreira S.T. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 933-937Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), pointing to the importance of subunit interactions for the folding stability of oligomeric proteins. De novo design and mutagenesis studies have proved useful in furthering our understanding of the features responsible for a four-helix bundle fold. For example, Raleigh and DeGrado (27.Raleigh D.P. DeGrado W.F. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1992; 114: 10079-10081Crossref Scopus (79) Google Scholar) reported a de novo designed protein (α2C) that featured most of the characteristics of a native protein, including temperature-induced transition between a native-like and a molten globule-like state as well as a well dispersed 1H-NMR up-field spectrum. Recent Monte Carlo simulations of three de novo designed helical bundle proteins, based exclusively on glycine, glutamic acid, lysine, and leucine residues, showed that the conformations obtained at low temperature have molten globule-like features (28.Sikorski A. Kolinski A. Skolnick J. Biophys. J. 1998; 75: 92-105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Naturally occurring four-helix bundles have also been linked to prominent folding intermediates. This folding motif is highly conserved throughout the family of c-type cytochromes. NMR experiments to monitor the formation of hydrogen-bonded stable structural motifs revealed that an α-helical core domain is a critical early event in the folding process of horse cytochrome c and is responsible for the formation of a folding intermediate (29.Sauder J.M. Roder H. Fold. Des. 1998; 3: 293-301Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In conclusion, we show that the de novo designed four-helix bundle protein (α2)2 has many characteristics of native proteins, including cooperative pressure and temperature transitions between a native-like and a molten globule-dissociated state. The design of novel proteins based on essentially non-native sequences thus appears as a versatile tool to improve our understanding of the forces and interactions that stabilize simple but biologically important folding motifs such as the four-helix bundle."

We hypothesized that viral homologous recombination is mediated by the combined action of the viral single strand DNA-binding protein (ICP8) and helicase-primase. Our results show that ICP8 catalyzes the formation of recombination intermediates (joint molecules) between circular single-stranded acceptor and linear duplex donor DNA. Joint molecules formed by invasion of a 3′-terminal strand displaces the non-complementary 5′-terminal strand, thereby creating a loading site for the helicase-primase. Helicase-primase acts on these joint molecules to promote ATP-dependent branch migration. Finally, we have reconstituted strand exchange by the synchronous action of ICP8 and helicase-primase. Based on these data, we present a recombination mechanism for a eukaryotic DNA virus in which a single strand DNA-binding protein and helicase cooperate to promote homologous pairing and branch migration.

Homologous recombination is a fundamental biological process. It serves, among other purposes, to repair DNA damage such as double strand DNA breaks or to reinitiate DNA replication at stalled replication forks.

One of the earliest reports on HSV recombination dates to 1955; co-infection of chorioallantois with HSV strains of varying virulence led to recombinant progeny with altered virulence (1.Wildy P. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1955; 13: 346-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Additional proof for recombination of the HSV genome comes from the observation that the subgenomic elements, UL and US, undergo inversion with respect to each other, generating four possible isomeric forms (2.Mocarski E.S. Post L.E. Roizman B. Cell. 1980; 22: 243-255Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 3.Smiley J.R. Fong B.S. Leung W.C.

This genome isomerization appears to be a consequence of homologous recombination rather than of a site-specific event involving cleavage at the a sequences that reside in inverted orientations at the termini of UL and US (5.Martin D.W. Weber P.C. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 8801-8812Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the a sequences may act as recombination hotspots. In this context, the a sequences are the sites of double-stranded (ds) DNA breaks created either by a structure-specific endonuclease 2K.-J. Huang and I. R. Lehman, personal communication. or during cleavage and packaging of the viral genome (6.Sarisky R.T. Weber P.C. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 34-47Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7.Dutch R.E. Zemelman B.V. Lehman I.R. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 3733-3741Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The terminal asequences have also been shown to be involved in the circularization of the viral genome by homologous recombination (8.Yao X.D. Matecic M. Elias P. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 6842-6849Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This process occurs immediately after infection by the virus and appears to be mediated by host factors (9.Garber D.A. Beverley S.M. Coen D.M. Virology. 1993; 197: 459-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 10.Yao X.D. Elias P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2905-2913Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The frequency of recombination has been estimated to be on the order of 0.5–0.7%/kilobase of the viral genome (11.Umene K. Rev. Med. Virol. 1999; 9: 171-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a screen for replication-competent HSV-1 origins from a library in which particular origin elements were substituted with random sequences resulted in the isolation of wild-type origins at a frequency of 25% as a consequence of homologous recombination (12.Hammarsten O. Elias P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 1753-1760Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). herpes simplex virus kilobase pair(s) double-stranded single-stranded gapped DNA joint molecule(s) single strand DNA-binding protein Insight into the mechanism by which homologous recombination proceeds during HSV-1 replication is provided by several lines of evidence; it was shown that plasmid-based homologous recombination was dependent on replication initiated from the viral origin, oriS (13.Weber P.C. Challberg M.D. Nelson N.J. Levine M. Glorioso J.C. Cell. 1988; 54: 369-381Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Furthermore, this recombination was also shown to depend solely on the seven essential viral replication genes (13.Weber P.C. Challberg M.D. Nelson N.J. Levine M. Glorioso J.C. Cell. 1988; 54: 369-381Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In subsequent studies, it was shown that a-sequence-mediated recombination was tightly linked to DNA replication (14.Dutch R.E. Bruckner R.C. Mocarski E.S. Lehman I.R. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 277-285Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15.Dutch R.E. Bianchi V. Lehman I.R. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 3084-3089Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These findings establish a direct role for DNA replication and DNA replication enzymes in the recombination process. This notion is supported by the presence during viral replication of highly branched DNA replication intermediates that may arise as a consequence of strand-transfer reactions (16.Friedmann A. Shlomai J. Becker Y. J. Gen. Virol. 1977; 34: 223-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 17.Severini A. Morgan A.R. Tovell D.R. Tyrrell D.L.

Escherichia coli RecA has served as a model for understanding the enzymology of homologous recombination (19.Shinohara A. Ogawa T. Mutat. Res. 1999; 435: 13-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Many organisms, ranging from bacteriophages to yeasts to metazoans encode RecA homologs such as UvsX, RadA, Dmc1, and Rad51 (20.Yonesaki T. Ryo Y. Minagawa T. Takahashi H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1985; 148: 127-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 21.Seitz E.M. Brockman J.P. Sandler S.J. Clark A.J. Kowalczykowski S.C.

HSV-1 and other members of the Herpesviridae, like other viruses such as bacteriophage T7, do not encode a RecA-type protein. Consequently, recombination in this class of virus may proceed by an alternate mechanism. Based on its dependence on DNA replication, we propose that HSV-1 recombination is mediated by viral DNA replication enzymes analogous to the mechanism in T7. In T7, two DNA replication proteins, the viral single strand DNA-binding protein (SSB) (gene 2.5 protein) and helicase-primase (gene 4 protein) perform pivotal roles in catalyzing strand exchange. The SSB acts as an annealing protein, mediating the formation of joint molecules (JM), in which complementary strands from donor and acceptor DNA molecules are physically linked, whereas the helicase-primase performs branch migration to complete strand exchange (24.Kong D. Richardson C.C. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2010-2019Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). We hypothesize that the HSV-1 SSB (ICP8) and either the replicative helicase-primase or the UL9 helicase perform analogous roles in HSV-1 recombination. ICP8 binds preferentially to single-stranded (ss) DNA with a site size of 10 ± 1 nucleotides (25.Gourves A.S. Tanguy Le Gac N. Villani G. Boehmer P.E. Johnson N.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10864-10869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In support of its role as a protein that participates in homologous recombination, it has previously been shown that ICP8 catalyzes reannealing of complementary ssDNA molecules (26.Dutch R.E. Lehman I.R. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 6945-6949Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). ICP8 also acts as a helix-destabilizing protein capable of melting DNA duplexes in a reaction that requires stoichiometric amounts of protein (27.Boehmer P.E. Lehman I.R. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 711-715Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, using electron microscopy to visualize individual DNA molecules, ICP8 was shown to promote limited strand transfer (up to 1 kilobase pair (kbp)) (28.Bortner C. Hernandez T.R. Lehman I.R. Griffith J. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 231: 241-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). It should be noted that the preparation of ICP8 used in that study contained traces of a 5′-3′ dsDNA exonuclease that may have generated ssDNA regions and facilitated subsequent ICP8-mediated annealing of complementary strands (28.Bortner C. Hernandez T.R. Lehman I.R. Griffith J. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 231: 241-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). HSV-1 encodes two helicases that may fulfill the role of the branch migration enzyme. UL9 is the viral initiator protein that possesses 3′-5′ helicase activity (29.Boehmer P.E. Dodson M.S. Lehman I.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1220-1225Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, ICP8 has been shown to associate with UL9 and to stimulate its helicase activity (29.Boehmer P.E. Dodson M.S. Lehman I.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1220-1225Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30.Boehmer P.E. J. Biol.

Chem. 2001; 276: 6840-6845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The viral replicative helicase is a hetero-trimeric complex that consists of a core enzyme (UL5 and UL52 subunits) possessing both 5′-3′ helicase and primase activities and a loading factor (UL8 subunit) that is required for optimal activity on ICP8-coated templates (33.Crute J.J.

Given that ICP8 and the two viral helicases are essential DNA replication proteins, it is difficult to study their role in recombination using a genetic approach. Consequently, we have examined the role of ICP8 and its associated helicases in recombination reactions in vitro. Here we show that ICP8 can catalyze pairing of homologous DNA molecules and that helicase-primase can process intermediates formed by ICP8 to complete strand exchange. ATP (disodium salt) and [γ-32P]ATP (4,500 Ci/mmol) were purchased from Sigma and ICN Biomedicals, respectively. Creatine phosphate and Sephadex G-25 (fine) Quick spin columns were purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals.

Proteinase K, creatine kinase, and calf intestinal phosphatase were purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. E. coli RecA protein and SSB were purchased from U. S. Biochemical Corp. RecA concentrations are expressed in moles of monomeric protein, whereas SSB concentrations are expressed in moles of tetrameric protein. ICP8, UL9, and UL5/52 core enzyme and UL8 subunit were purified as previously described (31.Boehmer P.E. Lehman I.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8444-8448Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 35.Tanguy Le Gac N. Villani G. Hoffmann J.S. Boehmer P.E. J. Biol.

Protein concentrations, expressed in moles of monomeric protein, were determined using extinction coefficients of 82,720, 89,220, 130,390, and 171,380 m−1cm−1 at 280 nm for ICP8, UL9, UL8, and UL5/52, respectively. M13 mp18 viral circular ssDNA and M13 mp18 replicative-form DNA were purchased from New England Biolabs and Bayou Biolabs, respectively. Linear λ DNA was purchased from New England Biolabs. Recombinant M13 containing λ cos(M13-cos) was constructed by inserting a 1163-bpDraI fragment (positions 47401–120) derived from circularized λ DNA into the SmaI site of M13 mp18 DNA. M13-cos viral circular ssDNA was prepared according to the method of Sanger et al. (38.Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52674) Google Scholar). M13 mp18 replicative-form DNA was digested with DraI (position 4621) to create one blunt end and TspRI (position 2105) to generate a 2516-bp linear dsDNA with a 9-nucleotide 3′ overhang (substrate A). Similarly, substrates B and C were generated by digesting λ DNA withDraI (position 47,429) and BsrBI (position 45,991) to create 1,073- and 2511-bp cos-terminal (12-nucleotide 5′ overhang) fragments, respectively. In all cases, the strand possessing the overhang was complementary to viral circular M13 ssDNA. All fragments were dephosphorylated using calf intestinal phosphatase and resolved by agarose gel electrophoresis followed by extraction and purification with the Ultrafree-DA and Wizard clean up systems. Purified DNA substrates were labeled at their 5′ ends with [γ-32P]ATP and polynucleotide kinase. Unincorporated nucleotides were removed by spin column chromatography, and DNA concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically using an extinction coefficient of 6,600 m−1cm−1 at 260 nm. DNA concentrations are expressed in moles of nucleotides. Joint molecule formation and strand exchange between homologous DNA molecules consisting of linear M13 dsDNA (donor DNA) and circular M13 ssDNA (acceptor DNA) was detected using an electrophoretic mobility shift assay as previously described (39.Cox M.M. Lehman I.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 6018-6022Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Unless otherwise stated, reactions were performed as follows; dsDNA (substrates A to C) (5 μm) was preincubated with 2 μm ICP8 in 20 mmHEPES-NaOH, pH 7.5, 5% glycerol, and 1 mm dithiothreitol for 30 min at 37 °C. The reaction was supplemented with M13 ssDNA (10 μm), 2.5 mm MgCl2, and 25 mm NaCl and further incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. The final concentration of ICP8 in the reaction was 1 μm. To examine the effect of HSV-1 helicase-primase on JM formed by ICP8 (branch migration reaction), reactions were performed as described except that the preincubation mixture contained 0.5 mmMgCl2, and the reactions were supplemented with 0.75 mm MgCl2, 3 mm ATP, helicase-primase (100 nm UL5/52 and 300 nmUL8), and no NaCl and incubated for 60 min at 37 °C. Reactions with RecA were performed in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 5% glycerol. M13 mp18 ssDNA (10 μm) was preincubated with 2 μm RecA for 10 min at 37 °C followed by the addition of 0.3 μm E. coli SSB, 5 μm substrate A, 1 mm ATP, 20 mmcreatine phosphate, and 1 μg of creatine kinase and incubated at 37 °C as indicated. Reactions were quenched by the addition of termination buffer (final concentration: 1% SDS, 25 mmEDTA, and 0.1 mg/ml proteinase K) followed by incubation for 10 min at 37 °C. The reaction mixtures were resolved by electrophoresis through 1% agarose-Tris acetate EDTA, pH 8.3, gels at 1.5 V/cm for 12 h. The gels were dried onto DE81 chromatography paper (Whatman) and analyzed and quantitated by storage phosphor analysis with a Molecular Dynamics Storm 840. Reaction products (JM, gapped DNA (gDNA), and linear ssDNA) are expressed as a percentage of the total radioactivity. dsDNA (6.6 μm) was incubated with ICP8 as indicated in 20 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.5, 5% glycerol, and 1 mm dithiothreitol for 30 min at 37 °C. Reactions were quenched as described above and resolved by electrophoresis through 1% agarose-Tris acetate EDTA, pH 8.3, gels at 1.5 V/cm for 12 h. The gels were dried onto DE81 chromatography paper (Whatman), analyzed, and quantitated by storage phosphorimaging analysis with a Molecular Dynamics Storm 840. Linear ssDNA products are expressed as a percentage of the total radioactivity. We have examined the ability of ICP8 to catalyze intermolecular pairingin vitro. The substrates for this reaction were acceptor DNA, consisting of circular M13 ssDNA, and donor DNA, consisting of 5′32P-labeled complementary linear dsDNA molecules. DNA substrates possessing TspRI ends (9 nucleotide 3′ overhang) or cos termini (12 nucleotide 5′ overhang) were used to supply ICP8 with an appropriate loading site (25.Gourves A.S. Tanguy Le Gac N. Villani G. Boehmer P.E. Johnson N.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10864-10869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In each case, the strand possessing the overhang was complementary to circular M13 ssDNA. Pairing between these substrates was measured with an electrophoretic mobility shift assay in which products exhibited reduced mobility in a non-denaturing agarose gel, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The standard assay consisted of preincubation of32P-labeled donor DNA (dsDNA) with ICP8 followed by the addition of acceptor DNA (ssDNA). Before electrophoresis, samples were treated with proteinase K and SDS to eliminate formation of protein-DNA complexes. Fig. 1 shows the products of reactions with substrate A, a 2.5-kbp fragment possessing a 9-nucleotide 3′ overhang at one end. The products of the complete reaction are shown in lane 10 and encompass a heterogeneous population of reaction intermediates (JM) as well as complete products (gDNA and linear ssDNA). Products formed by the action of ICP8 exhibited a mobility identical to those formed by gradual cooling of denatured ds and ssDNA (lane 3). The electrophoretic mobility of ICP8-catalyzed products was distinct from species formed due to stable interactions of ICP8 with DNA substrates (lane 18). The reaction was essentially ICP8-dependent since the amount of products formed in the absence of ICP8 (lane 6) or with bovine serum albumin (lane 17) was negligible (∼5%). The small amount of products formed in the absence of ICP8 may be attributed to spontaneous annealing of complementary strands. Omission of either donor or acceptor DNA eliminated product formation (lanes 7 and 8). Preincubation of ICP8 with donor DNA was essential since simultaneous incubation of ICP8 with both substrates or preincubation with acceptor DNA reduced the amount of product (lanes 9 and 11). ICP8-catalyzed pairing was dependent on MgCl2 (lane 14) and NaCl (lane 15). However, product formation was inhibited when MgCl2 and NaCl were included in the preincubation step (lane 12). Moreover, when the complete reaction was performed in the absence of MgCl2 and NaCl, the predominant product formed by ICP8 was unwound ssDNA (lane 13). The dependence of intermolecular pairing on MgCl2 and NaCl may be rationalized by previous data, which show that although the helix-destabilizing properties of ICP8 are inhibited by MgCl2 and NaCl, its annealing activity is MgCl2- and NaCl-dependent (26.Dutch R.E. Lehman I.R. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 6945-6949Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27.Boehmer P.E. Lehman I.R. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 711-715Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, preincubation of dsDNA with ICP8 in the absence of MgCl2and NaCl permits efficient loading of ICP8 on the donor DNA, leading to destabilization, followed by subsequent MgCl2- and NaCl-dependent annealing of complementary strands to form either JM, in the case of incomplete destabilization, or gDNA, in the case of complete destabilization of the donor DNA. Similar results were obtained with substrate B, a 1.1-kbp fragment possessing a 12-nucleotide 5′ overhang at one end (data not shown). The properties of ICP8-catalyzed intermolecular pairing with substrate A are depicted in Fig. 2. The ICP8 titration shows that product formation was “all or none,” indicating that the reaction is cooperative and requires stoichiometric amounts of ICP8 (Fig. 2 A). Maximal product formation occurred at a concentration of ICP8 required to coat two thirds of the total DNA, assuming a site size of 10 nucleotides (25.Gourves A.S. Tanguy Le Gac N. Villani G. Boehmer P.E. Johnson N.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10864-10869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), corresponding to a ratio of ∼1 ICP8 molecule to 15 nucleotides of ssDNA. The amount of product formed was proportional to the concentration of acceptor DNA (Fig. 2 B). A 10-fold increase in acceptor DNA concentration doubled the amount of product formed, indicating that the annealing step is second order with respect to DNA concentration as previously published (26.Dutch R.E. Lehman I.R. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 6945-6949Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). At higher acceptor DNA concentrations (>100 μm), the amount of product ceases to increase, as expected, presumably because the concentration of ICP8 becomes limiting. Fig. 2 C shows that the extent of product formation was dependent on the length of preincubation as well as incubation with acceptor DNA. The rate of product formation showed a plateau at ∼30 min that corresponds to the standard incubation time. Similar results were obtained with substrate B (data not shown). An integral part of the mechanism by which ICP8 promotes intermolecular pairing appears to be its helix-destabilizing activity. Therefore, the ability of ICP8 to catalyze the destabilization of substrates A (9 nucleotide 3′ overhang) and C (12 nucleotide 5′ overhang) was examined. Fig. 3 shows that ICP8 mediated limited destabilization of both substrates. Importantly, the data show that ICP8 is capable of destabilizing DNA up to ∼2.5 kbp in length regardless of the polarity of the overhang. It should be noted that the degree of denaturation observed in our experiments is an underestimate since we found that ∼15% of the denatured DNA reannealed spontaneously during the termination reaction. The previous experiments show the ability of ICP8 to catalyze intermolecular pairing, including the formation of JM. Branch migration is required to convert recombination intermediates (JM) into strand exchange products (gDNA and linear ssDNA). As stated in the introduction, we hypothesize that either HSV-1 helicase-primase or UL9 participate in this step. Fig. 4 shows the results of in vitro recombination experiments with substrate A (9-nucleotide 3′ overhang). In these experiments, 0.5 mm MgCl2was present during the preincubation to prevent complete destabilization of the donor duplex and thereby enrich for JM formation (Fig. 4 A, lane 4). JM were present as a variety of species, presumably because of the heterogeneity of such molecules. Invasion of the complementary 3′-terminal strand displaces the non-complementary 5′-terminal strand, thereby creating a loading site for the helicase-primase. The addition of helicase-primase to preformed JM resulted in the disappearance of JM and the concomitant appearance of both strand exchange products (gDNA and linear ssDNA) (comparelanes 4 and 6). The electrophoretic mobility of the gDNA product was indistinguishable from that formed by the action of RecA (lane 7) and coincident with that of the major product formed by gradual cooling of denatured dsDNA and ssDNA (lane 3). The addition of UL9 to preformed JM did not generate significant amounts of gDNA despite the fact that significant DNA unwinding had occurred, as shown by the presence of linear ssDNA (lane 5). The inability of UL9 to support branch migration is not unexpected given the 5′ overhang of the displaced strand and the 3′-5′ polarity of UL9. However, given the extent of DNA unwinding observed in the presence of UL9, the inability of ICP8 to promote intermolecular pairing indicates that ICP8 and UL9 do not cooperate in the pairing reaction. The formation of strand exchange products was also examined with JM formed with substrate C. In this case, invasion of the complementary 5′-terminal strand displaces the non-complementary 3′-terminal strand, thereby creating a loading site for UL9. No strand exchange products were observed with either UL9 or helicase-primase (data not shown). The data shown in Fig. 4 B provides additional support for the role of helicase-primase and ICP8 in branch migration. Omission of ICP8 from the reaction abolished the formation of gDNA and linear ssDNA, indicating that the reaction is ICP8-dependent (lane 3). The formation of strand exchange products was reduced ∼2-fold when the helicase-primase loading factor, UL8 subunit, was omitted (lane 4). Branch migration was dependent on ATP (lane 5). To determine the amount of helicase-primase required for optimal branch migration, increasing concentrations of helicase-primase were added to preformed JM. Quantitation of the reaction products indicates that product formation was dose-dependent beyond 50 nm enzyme (Fig. 5 A). It is possible that at low enzyme concentrations (<50 nm), helicase-primase is unable to efficiently interact with the ICP8-coated substrate (35.Tanguy Le Gac N. Villani G. Hoffmann J.S. Boehmer P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21645-21651Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The kinetics of branch migration are shown in Fig. 5 B. The data show that there was a concomitant increase in both reaction products (gDNA and linear ssDNA). The optimal MgCl2 concentration for the branch migration activity of helicase-primase was 1.25 mm. At 4 mm MgCl2, activity was reduced 3-fold. Similarly, branch migration was also inhibited at concentrations of NaCl above 50 mm (data not shown). The strand exchange reactions performed thus far can be delineated into two parts; they are ICP8-catalyzed JM formation and ICP8/helicase-primase-mediated branch migration. Because ICP8 interacts both physically and functionally with helicase-primase (35.Tanguy Le Gac N. Villani G. Hoffmann J.S. Boehmer P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21645-21651Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 36.Falkenberg M. Bushnell D.A. Elias P. Lehman I.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22766-22770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), it is possible that the two proteins form a multi-subunit recombinase in which both steps are coupled. This complex would be functionally analogous to E. coli RecA. Therefore, the ability of an ICP8/helicase-primase complex to mediate strand exchange synchronously was compared with that of RecA. The data in Fig. 6 show that the ICP8/helicase-primase complex does indeed promote strand exchange, albeit not as efficiently as RecA. Possible explanations as to the inefficiency of the reaction may be that ICP8 becomes limiting or that in the steady state, an equilibrium exists in which helicase-primase acts to drive strand exchange but also disrupts JM by initiating 5′-3′ DNA unwinding on the circular region of the JM. Here we have demonstrated that the SSB (ICP8) and replicative helicase (helicase-primase) of HSV-1, two essential viral replication proteins, cooperate to promote strand exchange. We have used a classical in vitro recombination assay to detect pairing and strand exchange between homologous donor (linear dsDNA) and acceptor (circular ssDNA) molecules (39.Cox M.M. Lehman I.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 6018-6022Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). To initiate homologous pairing, the donor DNA needs to be processed to generate ssDNA regions that are complementary to the acceptor DNA. We have constructed DNA substrates that possess overhangs of defined length and polarity by endonucleolytic incisions, generating short overhangs (9–12 nucleotides) that restrict non-enzymatic intermolecular pairing. Using such substrates, we have shown that ICP8 catalyzes pairing between complementary DNA molecules, generating recombination intermediates that are acted upon by helicase-primase to promote branch migration and complete strand exchange. Importantly, we have also shown that the concerted action of ICP8 and helicase-primase can promote strand exchange. The intermolecular pairing activity of ICP8 appears to require stoichiometric amounts of protein, consistent with the formation of a nucleoprotein filament, as seen with other recombinases (40.Egelman E.H. Stasiak A. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 191: 677-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). However, optimal pairing activity does not require saturating concentrations of ICP8, possibly because only one strand needs to be coated. In contrast to previous work in which the helix-destabilizing activity of ICP8 was restricted to short DNA fragments (27.Boehmer P.E. Lehman I.R. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 711-715Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we found that ICP8 can promote extensive destabilization of fragments up to 2.5 kbp. This may be rationalized by the fact that the substrates used in our current work provided ICP8 with an appropriate loading site (25.Gourves A.S. Tanguy Le Gac N. Villani G. Boehmer P.E. Johnson N.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10864-10869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). To complete strand exchange, JM formed by the action of ICP8 need to be processed by branch migration. We hypothesized that this role may be performed by either of the two HSV-1 helicases, UL9 or helicase-primase. We find that only helicase-primase is active in this capacity. Thus, invasion of the complementary 3′-terminal strand displaces the non-complementary 5′-terminal strand, thereby creating a loading site for the helicase-primase to enable branch migration. In addition, helicase-primase is suitable for this task since it has been shown to interact functionally and physically with ICP8 (35.Tanguy Le Gac N. Villani G. Hoffmann J.S. Boehmer P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21645-21651Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 36.Falkenberg M. Bushnell D.A. Elias P. Lehman I.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22766-22770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). This association is dependent on the UL8 subunit, which when omitted from our in vitro reactions, significantly decreased branch migration activity. Our results indicate that UL9 does not support branch migration despite its close functional and physical association with ICP8 (29.Boehmer P.E. Dodson M.S. Lehman I.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1220-1225Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30.Boehmer P.E. J. Biol.

Chem. 2001; 276: 6840-6845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Conceptually, UL9 should be active on JM that possess a 3′-terminal loading site (formed by the transfer of a complementary 5′-terminal strand). However, it is possible that such ICP8-coated JM are not efficiently recognized by UL9, especially at coating concentrations of ICP8 (30.Boehmer P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2676-2683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Our findings are summarized schematically in Fig. 7. Depending on reaction conditions, products consisted of either recombination intermediates (JM), when the helix-destabilizing activity of ICP8 was inhibited (Steps Iand III), or strand exchange products (gDNA and linear ssDNA), when ICP8 was allowed to completely destabilize the donor DNA duplex (Steps II and III). In both cases, pairing was presumably mediated by the renaturation activity of ICP8 (26.Dutch R.E. Lehman I.R. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 6945-6949Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To complete strand exchange, JM formed by the action of ICP8 need to be processed by branch migration. Transfer of a 3′-terminal strand displaces the non-complementary 5′-terminal strand, thereby creating a loading site for the helicase-primase to enable branch migration (Step IV). Strand exchange products may also be generated by an additional pathway in which the combined action of helicase-primase and ICP8 on the donor DNA increases the pool of linear ssDNA available for pairing with the acceptor DNA (Step V). It should be noted that during viral replication in vivo, some recombination may also be mediated by host enzymes. Moreover, invasion by a 3′-terminal strand would act to prime DNA synthesis, resulting in the coupling of recombination and replication, aiding in the rescue of collapsed replication forks (41.Marians K.J. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2000; 10: 151-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). DNA synthesis that is primed by invading strands could account for the branched intermediates that are prevalent during viral replication (16.Friedmann A. Shlomai J. Becker Y. J. Gen. Virol. 1977; 34: 223-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 17.Severini A. Morgan A.R. Tovell D.R. Tyrrell D.L. Virology. 1994; 200: 428-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 18.Severini A. Scraba D.G. Tyrrell D.L. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 3169-3175Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our results directly implicate DNA replication proteins in HSV-1 homologous recombination. We propose that an SSB (ICP8) performs an active role in HSV-1 recombination by mediating intermolecular pairing. This function is analogous to that of bacteriophage T7 SSB (gene 2.5 protein), which also acts as a pairing protein (24.Kong D. Richardson C.C. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2010-2019Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). We propose that the HSV-1 helicase-primase participates in recombination by promoting branch migration. This function would be analogous to that of theE. coli branch migration enzymes RuvAB and RecG, which also exhibit helicase activity (42.Kowalczykowski S.C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 156-164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar, 43.Lloyd R.G. Sharples G.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 1719-1725Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Similarly, the replicative helicases of T4 (gene 41 protein) and T7 (gene 4 protein) also catalyze branch migration (24.Kong D. Richardson C.C. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2010-2019Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 44.Salinas F. Kodadek T. Cell. 1995; 82: 111-119Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). However, in contrast to T7 helicase, which catalyzes branch migration in the absence of its cognate SSB (45.Kong D. Griffith J.D. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2987-2992Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), branch migration in HSV-1 appears to be ICP8-dependent. Initiation of homologous recombination by strand invasion requires the presence of ssDNA ends. During viral replication, ssDNA ends may be created due to the collapse of replication forks at gaps in the viral genome (16.Friedmann A. Shlomai J. Becker Y. J. Gen. Virol. 1977; 34: 223-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The combined action of ICP8 and helicase-primase may subsequently extend regions of ssDNA to initiate intermolecular pairing. Alternatively, dsDNA exonucleases may process the DNA from dsDNA ends (e.g. the ends of the rolling-circle intermediate or breaks at a sequence hotspots). Processing at these sites may be carried out by the HSV-1 5′-3′ exonuclease (UL12). After exonucleolytic processing of a DNA end, the known association between UL12 and ICP8 may serve to recruit ICP8 to promote intermolecular pairing (46.Thomas M.S. Gao M. Knipe D.M. Powell K.L. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 1152-1161Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This situation would be analogous to the mechanism ofred-mediated homologous recombination in λ and related bacteriophages (47.Muyrers J.P. Zhang Y. Buchholz F. Stewart A.F. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1971-1982PubMed Google Scholar). However, earlier studies with UL12mutants showed that they were capable of supporting DNA replication-mediated homologous recombination and exhibited branched DNA replication intermediates that presumably arose from invading DNA replication forks (48.Martinez R. Sarisky R.T. Weber P.C. Weller S.K. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 2075-2085Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), indicating that homologous recombination in HSV-1 is unlikely to proceed by a red-type mechanism. Nevertheless, UL12 may participate in substrate processing."

Using human skin fibroblast cultures, we demonstrate that alternative splicing of the neighboring IIICS domain may regulate the activities of the Hep II domain in cell spreading and fibronectin fibrillogenesis. Recombinant Hep II domains, adjacent to either the IIICS domain or the H89 splice variant that contains the amino-terminal sequence of the IIICS domain, blocked fibronectin fibrillogenesis and required sulfated proteoglycans to mediate cell spreading. If the Hep II domain was adjacent to either the H0 or H95 splice variants, which both lack the amino terminus of the IIICS domain, fibrillogenesis was not inhibited and cell spreading was independent of a sulfated proteoglycan-mediated mechanism. The effect of the splice variants on the Hep II domain could be mimicked using a Hep II domain that contained only 6 amino acids from the III15 repeat or 10 amino acids from the IIICS domain suggesting that sequences proximal to the III14 repeat determined the role of the Hep II domain in these processes. We propose that alternative splicing of the IIICS domain modulates interactions between heparan sulfate proteoglycans and the Hep II domain and that this serves as a mechanism to control the biological activities of fibronectin.

We propose that alternative splicing of the IIICS domain modulates interactions between heparan sulfate proteoglycans and the Hep II domain and that this serves as a mechanism to control the biological activities of fibronectin. As a major protein in the extracellular matrix, fibronectin provides positional cues to help direct a wide variety of biological processes including cell migration, adhesion, cell cycle progression, cell differentiation, and apoptosis (1.Mosher D.F. Fibronectin. Academic Press, New York1989Google Scholar, 2.Hynes R.O. Fibronectins. Springer-Verlag, New York1990Crossref Google Scholar). These biological activities of fibronectin are mediated via interactions with various members of the integrin family and cell surface proteoglycans. It has been known for some time that these biological activities of fibronectin are contained within discrete structural domains and that neighboring domains within fibronectin can either suppress or enhance a particular activity. For example, the heparin (Hep) 1The abbreviations used are: Hep IIheparin IIDMEMDulbecco's modified Eagle's mediumBSAbovine serum albuminGSTglutathione S-transferaseII-binding domain of fibronectin can suppress the expression of metalloproteinases induced by the central cell-binding domain of fibronectin (3.Huhtala P.

Two of the alternatively spliced sites known as the extra type III repeats (EIIIA and EIIIB) flank the central cell-binding domain of fibronectin and alternative splicing results in either the exclusion, or inclusion of these domains. A third site of alternative splicing occurs within the IIICS domain (also know as the variable region). Alternative splicing of this domain results in either the inclusion, or exclusion, of this domain as well as the removal of only part of the amino and/or carboxyl termini of the domain (6.Schwarzbauer J. Sandell L.J. Boyd C.D. Extracellular Matrix Genes. Academic Press, New York1990: 195-219Crossref Google Scholar). The fourth site of alternative splicing is located at the carboxyl termini of fibronectin and results in the removal of the III15 and I10repeats (7.MacLeod J.N. Burton-Wurster N. Gu D.N. Lust G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18954-18960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Alternative splicing of fibronectin is tissue-specific. Fetal tissues and tumors express a higher percentage of fibronectins with the EIIIA and EIIIB repeats. Expression of the EIIIA and EIIIB isoforms is also increased during wound healing (8.ffrench-Constant C. Hynes R.O.

Gu D.N. Lust G. J. Biol.

Wilson C.L. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 3445-3453Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Alternative splicing can alter the activity of fibronectin by introducing a new activity that is contained within that spliced site. For example, alternative splicing of the IIICS domain will either add, or remove, integrin- and proteoglycan-binding sites thereby affecting cell adhesion or migration (13.Humphries M.J. Akiyama S.K.

In human periodontal ligament fibroblasts, inclusion of the entire IIICS domain modulates the activity of FAK and regulates apoptosis (17.Kapila Y.L. Wang S. Johnson P.W. J. Biol.

Inclusion of the EIIIA repeat regulates the expression of metalloproteinases in joint connective tissues, mediates the induction of the myofibroblastic phenotype by transforming growth factor-β1, and activates lipocytes (18.Jarnagian W.R.

The IIICS domain and the EIIIA and EIIIB repeats also influence the biological activities of neighboring domains. Thus, the IIICS domain acts cooperatively with the Hep II domain of fibronectin to control the invasive phenotype of human oral squamous cell carcinoma (21.Kapila Y.L. Niu J. Johnson P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18932-18938Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). When the alternatively spliced EIIIA domain is included in the translated product, the cell adhesion function of the neighboring integrin-binding domain in the III10 repeat is enhanced (22.Manabe R. Oh-e N. Maeda T. Fukuda T. Sekiguchi K. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 295-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). In addition, the role of III10 in cell cycle progression and mitogenic signal transduction is enhanced when the EIIIA repeat is included (23.Manabe R. Oh-e N. Sekiguchi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5919-5924Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Presumably insertion of the EIIIA domain enhances these functions because it introduces a global conformational change into fibronectin that further exposes the integrin-binding site in the III10repeat. A similar function may exist for the EIIIB repeat which when included within fragments from the central cell-binding domain enhances cell adhesion and spreading (24.Hashimoto-Uoshima M. Yan Y.Z. Schneider G. Aukhil I. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 2271-2280PubMed Google Scholar). The Hep II-binding domain is sandwiched between the alternatively spliced EIIIA repeat and the IIICS domain and is therefore a likely candidate to be affected by alternative splicing. It plays an important role in regulating cell adhesion, migration, fibronectin fibrillogenesis, signal transduction events, and the organization of focal adhesions and the actin cytoskeleton (17.Kapila Y.L.

EMBO J. 1991; 10: 4089-4095Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) and members of the syndecan family (28.Woods A. McCarthy J.B. Furcht L.T. Couchman J.R. Mol. Biol.

Biophys. 2000; 374: 66-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). In this present study, we examined whether alternative splicing of the IIICS domain affects the biological activity of the Hep II domain. Using recombinant proteins that contain the Hep II domain and four splice variants of the IIICS domain (H0, H120, H89, or H95), we show that alternative splicing of the IIICS domain regulates the ability of soluble Hep II domains to block fibronectin fibrillogenesis and utilize sulfated proteoglycans to promote cell spreading. Alternative splicing of the IIICS domain did not compromise the ability of the Hep II domain to bind to either the amino terminus of fibronectin or the fibroblast cell surface. Alternative splicing, therefore, appears to be a mechanism to control the biological functions of the Hep II domain, possibly by modulating cell signaling pathways. Neonatal human skin fibroblasts used in the binding assays were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. All binding assays were done as previously described (29.Bultmann H. Santas A.J. Peters D.M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2601-2609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Freshly trypsinized cells were resuspended in DMEM containing 25 mm HEPES, 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (BSA), 100 units/ml penicillin G, 5 μm streptomycin sulfate, and 25 μg/ml cycloheximide and then incubated for 1 h at room temperature before being plated onto a 96-well plate at a final density of 3 × 104cells/well. Prior to labeling with 125I-ligand, cells were allowed to adhere and spread for 3 h at 37 °C. Fibroblasts were then incubated with 125I-labeled fibronectin or 70-kDa fragments for 1 h at 37 °C. All microtiter wells were precoated for 1 h with 40 μg/ml of 160-kDa fragments at room temperature and subsequently blocked with 2 mg/ml BSA at room temperature for 3 h or overnight at 4 °C. Matrix assembly assays were performed as previously described (29.Bultmann H. Santas A.J. Peters D.M.P. J. Biol.

Cycloheximide-treated fibroblasts (3 × 104 cells/well) in serum-free media were plated into 96-well plates precoated with 160-kDa fragment of fibronectin and blocked with BSA as described above. After 3 h, the media was removed and the cells were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C with125I-fibronectin in serum-free media in the presence or absence of H0, H120, or Hep IIa. The cultures were washed, and the wells were then broken apart and counted in a γ-counter. Confluent cultures of human skin fibroblasts were treated with 30 mm sodium chlorate and 10 mm NaCl for 48 h in sulfate-free media and 10% sulfate free serum as described (32.Humphries D.E. Silbert J.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 154: 365-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 33.Rapraeger A.C. Krufka A. Olwin B.B. Science. 1991; 252: 1705-1708Crossref PubMed Scopus (1292) Google Scholar). As a control, some chlorate-treated cultures were incubated with 10 mm sodium sulfate for 24 h. Cells were then trypsinized and resuspended cells were treated with 25 μg/ml cycloheximide for 1.5 h to block endogenous fibronectin synthesis. Fibroblasts (1.0 × 104 cells/well) were plated onto 0.28-cm2 wells coated with molar equivalents of H0 (4.3 μg/ml), Hep IIa repeats (3.4 μg/ml), H120 (6.6 μg/ml), H89 (5.4 μg/ml), or H95 (5.5 μg/ml). Wells were coated for 1 h at room temperature and blocked with heat denatured 2 mg/ml BSA (29.Bultmann H. Santas A.J. Peters D.M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2601-2609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The cells were then allowed to attach and spread for 1.5 h at 37 °C. The wells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline to remove unattached cells. The attached cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, for 30 min and viewed under a phase microscope. Quantification of the degree of spreading was done by randomly counting the number of spread versus round cells. At least 100 cells/well of triplicate wells were counted. Microtiter wells precoated with 10 μg/ml 70-kDa fibronectin fragment were incubated with increasing concentrations of 125I-labeled recombinant proteins in DMEM containing 25 mm HEPES and 2 mg/ml BSA for 1 h at 37 °C as described previously (29.Bultmann H. Santas A.J. Peters D.M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2601-2609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Wells were then washed three times, separated, and counted. The recombinant proteins used included the His-III12 (2.8 × 104 cpm/pmol), III12 (1.7 × 105 cpm/pmol), III13 (1.3 × 105 cpm/pmol), His-III14 (8.6 × 104 cpm/pmol), His-III13–14 (3–5.8 × 105 cpm/pmol), III12–14 (2.6 × 105 cpm/pmol), III12–15 lacking (8.9 × 104 cpm/pmol) or containing IIICS domain (3.2 × 105 cpm/pmol), or IIICS domain (1.1 × 105 cpm/pmol). Competition binding assays were performed in DMEM containing 25 mm HEPES and 2 mg/ml BSA as previously described (29.Bultmann H. Santas A.J. Peters D.M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2601-2609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Briefly, microtiter wells precoated with 10 μg/ml 70-kDa fragment were incubated with 125I-labeled His-III14(1.6 × 105 cpm/pmol) in the presence or absence of unlabeled proteins for 1 h at 37 °C. Wells were then washed three times, separated, and counted. Nonspecific binding was measured in wells coated with 2 mg/ml BSA. The ability of the recombinant fibronectin domains to inhibit fibronectin fibrillogenesis was assayed as previously described (29.Bultmann H. Santas A.J. Peters D.M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2601-2609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Human fibroblasts were plated at confluence (5 × 104cells/well) onto TeflonTM-coated 12-well glass slides that were precoated with 20 μg/ml of the 160-kDa cell-binding fragment of fibronectin for 2 h. Cells were allowed to attach for 1 h in DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum, before the medium was replaced with serum-free media (DMEM, 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 2 mg/ml BSA, 25 μg/ml cycloheximide, 100 units/ml penicillin G, and 5 μm streptomycin sulfate). After 3 h, this medium was replaced and cells were incubated overnight at 37 °C with serum-free medium containing 1 μg/ml (2 nm) or 3 μg/ml (6 nm) human plasma fibronectin with or without recombinant proteins. Cell layers were then washed two times with phosphate-buffered saline and fixed for 30 min at room temperature with 4% paraformaldehyde, 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4. Polyclonal anti-fibronectin serum and donkey anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to rhodamine were used to label fibronectin fibrils as described (34.Dzamba B.J. Bultmann H. Akiyama S.K. Peters D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19646-19652Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Both antibodies were diluted 1:100 with 1% BSA, phosphate-buffered saline. Labeled fibronectin fibrils were analyzed by epifluorescence with a Nikon Optiphot microscope and digitized images were collected with a Photometrics Image Point CCDTM camera and the Image Pro PlusTM version 1.3 program. Human plasma fibronectin, 70-kDa (I1-I9 repeats) fragments, and 160-kDa (III1-III14 repeats) fragments were prepared from isolated human plasma fibronectin as previously described (35.Mosher D.F. Proctor R.B. Science. 1980; 209: 927-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 36.Mosher D.F. Johnson R.B. J. Biol.

Recombinant glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins of the Hep IIa (III12–14), III12, and III13 repeats of fibronectin were prepared as described before using thrombin to cleave off the GST tag (29.Bultmann H. Santas A.J. Peters D.M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2601-2609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The III12 repeat includes three amino acids (QST) upstream of the III12 repeat and spans amino acids Gln1687through Glu1781, while the recombinant III13repeat spans amino acids Asn1782 through Thr1870. Primers used to amplify the III12 repeat were: sense primer, 5′-GAATTCCAGTCCACAGCTATTCCTG and antisense primer, 5′-CTCGAGCTACTCCAGAGTGGTGACAAC. Primers used to amplify III13 repeat were: sense primer, 5′-AATTCAATGTCAGCCCACCAAGAAGG and antisense primer, 5′-CTCGAGCTAAGTGGAGGCGTCGATGAC. The restriction enzyme sites (EcoRI and XhoI), which were engineered into the PCR products to facilitate cloning, are in bold. Underlined bases indicate the stop codons. All constructs were sequenced using 32P end-labeled primers (Promega end labeling kit) using the Sanger sequencing method (38.Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52769) Google Scholar). CD analysis were also done to verify that the conformation of the Hep IIa (III12–14) and H0 (III12–15) was similar to that predicted by the crystal structure of the III12–14domain (39.Sharma A. Askari J.A. Humphries M.J. Jones E.Y. Stuart D.I. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1468-1479Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The Hep IIb construct containing the first 6 amino acids of the III15 repeat was constructed using the GST expression vector. Primers used to construct this module were: sense primer, 5′-CCGGAATTCGCTATTCTTGCACCAACTGAC and antisense primer, 5′-CCGCTCGAGCTAAGAGAGAGCTTCTTGTCCTGT. The restriction enzyme sites (EcoRI andXhoI), which were engineered into the PCR products to facilitate cloning, are in bold. Underlined bases indicate the stop codons. Since recombinant III14 repeats were thrombin-sensitive, recombinant III14 repeats were generated as histidine-tagged fusion proteins. Histidine-tagged recombinant III12, III14, and III13–14 repeats were constructed using the pET 28a+ expression vector (Novagen, WI). The same primers that were used to make GST-III12 were used to make His-III12. The primers used to amplify the His-III14 repeat were: sense primer, 5′-GAATTCGCCATTGATGCACCATCC and antisense primer, 5′-CTCGAGCTATGGAAGGGTTACCAGTTG. Primers used to construct the His-III13–14 were: sense primer, 5′-GAATTCAATGTCAGCCCACCAAGAAGG and antisense primer, 5′-CTCGAGCTATGGAAGGGTTACCAGTTG. The His-III14 recombinant protein spans amino acids Ala1871 through Pro1970 and the His-III13–14 recombinant protein spans amino acids Asn1782 through Pro1970. The restriction enzyme sites (EcoRI and XhoI), which were engineered into the PCR products to facilitate cloning, are in bold. Underlined bases indicate the stop codons. The protein expression was induced with 1 mm isopropyl-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and histidine-tagged proteins were purified using nickel chromatography (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA) and imidazole elution according to the manufacturer's instructions. Expression constructs encoding the recombinant fusion proteins GST-III12–14IIICS and GST-IIICS (40.Eisenmann K.M. McCarthy J.B. Simpson M.A. Keely P.J. Guan J.L. Tachibana K. Lim L. Manser E. Furcht L.T. Iida J. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 507-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) were generous gifts from Dr. James McCarthy (University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN). Expression constructs encoding the recombinant fusion proteins GST-III12–15 with or without the H120, H95, and H89 splice variants of the IIICS region were made as previously described (41.Mould A.P. Askari J.A. Craig S.E. Garratt A.N. Clements J. Humphries M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27224-27230Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These proteins were purified and the GST tag was removed with thrombin as described (29.Bultmann H. Santas A.J. Peters D.M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2601-2609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The H0 and H120 proteins were further purified on a heparin-agarose column equilibrated with 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl. Proteins were eluted with 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 500 mm NaCl. The H120 protein was additionally purified using an anti-IIICS monoclonal antibody (10G6) coupled to CNBr-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). Some recombinant and proteolytic proteins were concentrated by solvent extraction with flakes of polyethylene glycol followed by dialysis against phosphate-buffered saline or by lyophilization following dialysis against 0.2 m ammonium bicarbonate. Lyophilized proteins were reconstituted in phosphate-buffered saline or DMEM, 25 mm HEPES. All radioiodinated proteins were iodinated with carrier-free Na125I using the chloramine-T method (42.Greenwood F.C. Hunter W.M. Glover J.S. Biochem. J. 1963; 89: 114-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (6742) Google Scholar). Previous studies had shown that proteolytic fragments of fibronectin that contain the III12–14 repeats of the Hep II domain inhibit the incorporation of exogenously added plasma fibronectin into fibrils (29.Bultmann H. Santas A.J. Peters D.M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2601-2609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). To determine whether alternative splicing of the IIICS domain affects the biological activity of the Hep II domain, cultures were incubated with recombinant proteins containing the III12–14 repeats of the Hep II domain and different splice variants of the IIICS domain (Fig. 1). Fibril formation was then examined by immunofluorescence microscopy. As shown in Fig. 2A, cycloheximide-treated fibroblast cultures assemble exogenously added plasma fibronectin into fibrils (arrowheads). If the Hep IIa protein, which contains the III12–14 repeats and the first 10 amino acids of the IIICS domain, was added to the cultures, the assembly of exogenous plasma fibronectin into fibrils was inhibited (Fig. 2B). This biological activity of the Hep II domain in fibrillogenesis was regulated by the splice pattern of the IIICS domain. If cycloheximide-treated fibroblast cultures were incubated with H120 proteins that contain the Hep II domain and the entire 120 amino acids of the IIICS domain, fibronectin fibrillogenesis was blocked (compare Fig. 2, A and C). The only fibronectin observed in these cultures were aggregates of the plasma fibronectin (arrows). In contrast, if the H0 protein that lacks the IIICS domain was used, fibronectin fibril formation was not inhibited (Fig. 2D, arrowheads). The effect of the H120 protein on fibrillogenesis was not due to the biological activity of the IIICS domain, since the IIICS domain alone did not block fibrillogenesis (Fig. 2E). The effect of the IIICS domain on the activity of Hep II domain required that the IIICS domain be tandem with the Hep II domain. If the entire IIICS domain was added simultaneously with the H0 variant, fibronectin formation was still not inhibited (Fig. 2F). This suggests that the sequences adjacent to the III14 repeat influence the ability the Hep II domain to inhibit fibronectin fibril formation.Figure 2Alternative splicing of the IIICS domain affects the activity of the Hep II domain. Cycloheximide-treated fibroblasts plated on the 160-kDa fragment of fibronectin were incubated overnight with 3 μg/ml plasma fibronectin alone (A) or in combination with molar equivalents (4.6 μm) of Hep IIa (B), H120 (C), H0 (D), IIICS (E), H0 and IIICS (F), H89 (G), H95 (H), and FN51 (I). All cultures were fixed and labeled with a rabbit anti-fibronectin serum followed by an anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to rhodamine as described under “Materials and Methods.” Fibronectin fibrils are identified with arrowheads. Arrows indicate aggregates of fibronectin.Bar represents 20 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To demonstrate that the amino acid sequences immediately carboxyl-terminal to the III14 repeat can affect the biological activity of the Hep II domain during fibrillogenesis, the immunofluorescence microscopy assays were repeated using recombinant H89 and H95 proteins (Fig. 1). As shown in Fig. 2G, if the III14 repeat of the Hep II domain was adjacent to the H89 splice variant, which has the first 89 amino acids of the IIICS domain, the Hep II domain inhibited fibrillogenesis. However, if the H95 splice variant that lacked the first 25 amino acids of the IIICS domain was adjacent to the Hep II domain, the Hep II domain had no effect on fibrillogenesis (Fig. 2H). Therefore, the ability of the Hep II domain to block fibrillogenesis is not simply due to the lack or presence of the IIICS domain, but rather is a result of the sequences that are tandem to the III12–14 repeats. The III15 repeat did not appear to have any affect on the activity of the IIICS domain in the H120 variant. Recombinant proteins containing the Hep II domain, the entire IIICS domain, but lacking the III15 repeat (Fig. 1), behaved like the H120 splice variant and also blocked fibrillogenesis (Fig. 2I). This further indicates that it was the presence of the sequences adjacent to the III14 repeat that modulated the activity of the Hep II domain. To further demonstrate that alternative splicing can affect the role of the Hep II domain in fibrillogenesis, a biochemical matrix assembly assay using 125I-fibronectin was employed (43.McKeown-Longo P.J. Mosher D.F. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 98: 22-28Crossref Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In this assay, cycloheximide-treated fibroblasts were incubated with125I-fibronectin in the presence or absence of the H120 and H0 splice variants. A 70-kDa fragment shown previously to block fibrillogenesis was used as a positive control (29.Bultmann H. Santas A.J. Peters D.M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2601-2609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 44.McKeown-Longo P.J. Mosher D.F. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 100: 3"
https://openalex.org/W2042326648,"Hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor (HGF/SF) is a multifunctional cytokine that is involved in many normal as well as pathological conditions. HGF/NK1, a splice variant of HGF/SF, has been reported to have either antagonistic or agonistic effects with regard to c-Met signaling depending on the cell type. In these experiments, we have determined that HGF/NK1 is a potent mitogen for rat hepatocytes in culture. Furthermore, we have found that coagulation factor Xa (fXa) is capable of cleaving HGF/NK1 and single chain HGF/SF (scHGF/SF). The products resulting from cleavage of HGF/NK1 or scHGF/SF by fXa appear as single bands under non-reducing conditions. The reaction products from the digestion of HGF/NK1 by fXa were separated under reducing conditions, and the cleavage site, as determined by N-terminal sequencing, was located C-terminal to arginine 134. Previous work established that the heparin-binding domain for HGF/SF is located in the N domain of HGF/SF. Additionally, the dimerization of the HGF/SF receptor (c-Met) by the ligand HGF/NK1 is facilitated by heparin and related sulfonated sugars on the cell surface, whereas heparin is not required for HGF/SF-mediated dimerization. Cleavage of single chain HGF/SF or HGF/NK1 by factor Xa does not alter the affinity of the respective molecules for heparin, but it did variably affect the associated mitogenic activity of these factors. The associated mitogenic activity of HGF/NK1 was reduced by more than 90%, whereas the mitogenic activity of scHGF/SF was unaffected. This suggests mandatory maintenance of a steric interaction of the N domain and the first kringle domain for HGF/NK1 to act as an agonist for rat hepatocyte growth but is not required by full-length HGF/SF."

Structurally, Lkn-1 is distinct from other human CC chemokines in that it has long amino acid residues preceding the first cysteine at the NH2 terminus, and contains two extra cysteines. NH2-terminal amino acids of Lkn-1 were deleted serially, and the effects of each deletion were investigated. In CCR1-expressing cells, serial deletion up to 20 amino acids (Δ20) did not change the calcium flux-inducing activity significantly. Deletion of 24 amino acids (Δ24), however, increased the agonistic potency ∼100-fold. Deletion of 27 or 28 amino acids also increased the agonistic potency to the same level shown by Δ24. Deletion of 29 amino acids, however, abolished the agonistic activity almost completely showing that at least 3 amino acid residues preceding the first cysteine at the NH2 terminus are essential for the biological activity of Lkn-1. Loss of agonistic activity was due to impaired binding to CCR1. In CCR3-expressing cells, Δ24 was the only form of Lkn-1 mutants that revealed increased agonistic potency.

Lkn-1 is a human CC chemokine that binds to both CCR1 and CCR3 and induces chemotaxis and calcium influx in human neutrophils, monocytes, eosinophils, and lymphocytes (11.Youn B.-S. Zhang S.M.

Chemotaxis of neutrophils distinguishes Lkn-1 from other CCR1 agonists such as human macrophage inflammatory protein-1α (MIP-1α) (12.Zhang S.M. Youn B.-S. Gao J.L. Murphy P.M. Kwon B.S. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 4928-4942PubMed Google Scholar). Lkn-1 is a member of a human CC chemokine subfamily that contains four conserved cysteines (11.Youn B.-S. Zhang S.M. Lee E.K. Park D.H.

Lkn-1, however, is distinct from other human CC chemokines in that it has two extra cysteines, which may form a third disulfide bond. Lkn-1 is also distinct from other human CC chemokines in that it has long amino acid residues preceding the first cysteine at the NH2terminus. The mature form of Lkn-1 consists of 92 amino acids and has 31 amino acid residues preceding the first cysteine, whereas most human as well as mouse CC chemokines have 10 or fewer amino acid residues preceding the first cysteine (13.Clark-Lewis I.

Recombinant Lkn-1 produced in Escherichia coli also shows several distinguished characteristics. In contrast to other CC chemokines such as monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1), recombinant Lkn-1, which contains additional methionine and six histidines at its NH2 and COOH termini, respectively, shows almost normal biological activities (11.Youn B.-S.

In addition, purified recombinant Lkn-1 undergoes a spontaneous site-specific cleavage producing a 24-amino acid shorter protein than the intact form of Lkn-1 (11.Youn B.-S. Zhang S.M. Lee E.K.

The biological significance of the spontaneous site-specific cleavage is not known yet. In the present study, we produced a series of NH2-terminal deletion mutants of Lkn-1 including the site-specific cleaved form, and the effects of each deletion were investigated in CCR1- or CCR3-expressing cells. HOS (human osteogenic sarcoma) cells expressing CCR1 and CCR3 and HEK (human embryonic kidney) 293 cells expressing CCR3 were provided by Dr. Ji-Ming Wang (National Cancer Institute, Frederick, MD). The cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT), 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. HOS transfectant cells were selected regularly with 1 μg/ml puromycin (Sigma), and HEK transfectant cells were selected with 400 μg/ml G418 (Invitrogen). A plasmid containing full-length cDNA of Lkn-1 was used as a template in PCR reactions to create Lkn-1 mutants with progressive amino acid deletions at the NH2terminus. The sequences of the oligonucleotide primers used for amplification are shown in Table I. All of the forward primers contained overhanging nucleotide sequences for glycine-isoleucine-glutamic acid-glycine-arginine (GIEGR) at the 5′ end of the target gene, and the reverse primer contained stop codon of Lkn-1 cDNA. The PCR products were cloned into the E. coli expression vector, pET30Xa/LIC (Novagen, Madison, WI), and transformed into E. coli strain BL21(DE3). Expression of Lkn-1 mutant proteins was induced by isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (Sigma). The mutant proteins were purified from bacterial lysate with Ni-NTA spin columns (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Eluted proteins were folded by gradually removing denaturants in the protein preparation by stepwise dialysis. Overhanging extra amino acid residues at the NH2 terminus including the polyhistidine tag were removed by cleavage with factor Xa (Novagen). For cleavage of 1 μg of target protein, 0.04 unit of factor Xa was added, and the mixture was incubated at 22 °C for 7 h. Final purification of the cleaved proteins was performed by chromatographic separation in Superdex Peptide HR 10/30 column (Amersham Biosciences) attached to AKTApurifier (Amersham Biosciences). The proteins were eluted with a 0.02 mphosphate buffer containing 0.25 m NaCl. Finally, purified mutant proteins were free of endotoxin by a Limulusamoebocyte assay (Associates of Cape Cod, Woods Hole, MA). The concentrations of the proteins were determined by micro-bicinchoninic acid assay kit (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions using bovine serum albumin as standard protein.Table IPrimers used for the generation of NH2-terminal deletion mutantsMutantPrimer1-aThe factor Xa recognition site is underlined.Δ05′-GGTATTGAGGGTCGCCAGTTCACAAATGATGCAGAG-3′Δ55′-GGTATTGAGGGTCGCGCAGAGACAGAGTTAATGATG-3′Δ105′-GGTATTGAGGGTCGCATGATGTCAAAGCTTCCACTGG-3′Δ155′-GGTATTGAGGGTCGCCCACTGGAAAATCCAGTAGTTC-3′Δ205′-GGTATTGAGGGTCGCGTAGTTCTGAACAGCTTTCAC-3′Δ245′-GGTATTGAGGGTCGCAGCTTTCACTTTGCTGCTGAC-3′Δ275′-GGTATTGAGGGTCGCTTTGCTGCTGACTGCTGCACC-3′Δ285′-GGTATTGAGGGTCGCGCTGCTGACTGCTGCACCTCC-3′Δ295′-GGTATTGAGGGTCGCGCTGACTGCTGCACCTCCTAC-3′Reverse primer5′-AGAGGAGAGTTAGAGCCTTATATTGAGTAGGGCTTCAGC-3′1-a The factor Xa recognition site is underlined. Open table in a new tab SDS-PAGE was performed as described previously (14.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206514) Google Scholar). The gels were either stained with a 0.025% Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 or silver nitrate, or they were transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane (Haake Buchler Instruments, Saddle Brook, NJ). The membrane was probed with polyclonal rabbit anti-Lkn-1 and then with alkaline phosphate-labeled goat anti-rabbit Ig (Bio-Rad). The membrane was developed by the addition of enzyme substrates, 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate, and nitro blue tetrazolium (Bio-Rad). Receptor activation was assessed by real time measurement of intracellular calcium concentration in cells labeled with Fura-2/AM (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) in MSIII fluorimeter (Photon Technology International, S. Brunswick, NJ) as described previously (4.Murphy P.M. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 593-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (1125) Google Scholar, 15.Sarafi M. Garcia-Zepeda E. MacLean J. Charo I.F. Luster A.D. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 99-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Receptor desensitization was tested by monitoring intracellular calcium changes in cells upon repeated chemokine stimulation at 100-s intervals. Results were expressed as excitation ratios at 340 and 380 nm. Chemotactic activities were performed in a 48-microwell Boyden chamber (Neuroprobe, Cabin John, MD) as described previously (15.Sarafi M. Garcia-Zepeda E. MacLean J. Charo I.F. Luster A.D. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 99-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). The lower wells were filled with 27 μl of buffer alone or with buffer containing chemokines, and the upper wells were filled with 50 μl of cell suspension (6×105 cells/ml). The two wells were separated by a fibronectin (Sigma)-coated polyvinylpyrrolidone-free polycarbonate filter (Neuroprobe) with 10-μm pores. Human MIP-1α and human eotaxin were purchased from PeproTech Inc. (Rocky Hill, NJ). Lkn-1 mutant proteins were labeled radioactively with 125I using the chloramine T method (16.Hunter W.M. Greenwood F.C. Nature. 1962; 194: 495-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (5854) Google Scholar). The specific activities of the labeled Lkn-1 mutants were ∼ 8×107 cpm/μg protein. CCR1- or CCR3-transfected cells were suspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum at a concentration of 2×107cells/ml; 100 μl of the suspension was added to each tube. Saturation binding assays were performed in a total volume of 0.2 ml containing 2×106 cells and 0.04 to ∼10 nm125I-labeled Lkn-1 mutants. Competition binding experiments were performed under the same conditions using 1 nm125I-labeled Δ0 and variable concentrations of competitors. The nonspecific binding was estimated by measuring the binding of the labeled ligand in the presence of 100-fold excess of unlabeled ligand. Samples were incubated at 4 °C for 90 min with continuous rotation. Incubation was terminated by centrifuging the cell suspension over 1 ml of 10% sucrose (Sigma) cushion. Cell pellets were cut from the tubes, and cpm were counted using a gamma counter. The intact form of Lkn-1 and its mutants lacking NH2-terminal 5, 10, 15, 20, 24, 27, 28, and 29 amino acid residues, respectively, were produced in E. coli using the T7 polymerase-based expression vector, pET-30 Xa/LIC. Scheme I depicts the NH2-terminal deletion mutants of Lkn-1 produced as well as the expression system used in the present study. Recombinant fusion proteins were readily detected in bacterial lysate (Fig. 1 A). The fusion proteins were purified from the bacterial lysate by nickel-chelating resin (Fig. 1 B). The purified fusion proteins were strongly reactive with polyclonal rabbit anti-Lkn-1 antibody (Fig. 1 C). Purified fusion proteins were then cleaved with the protease, Factor Xa, which recognizes GIEGR sequences linked directly to the NH2 terminus of the target protein. Factor Xa cleaved most of the fusion proteins almost completely. Factor Xa, however, was less efficient in cleaving fusion proteins for Δ27, Δ28, and Δ29. Thus, final purification and removal of uncleaved fusion proteins were performed by a chromatographic separation. Fig. 2 A shows a representative chromatogram of the Δ28 fusion protein that was digested with Factor Xa. The protein in the single dominant peak in Fig. 2 A was collected and found to be a homogeneous protein that was cleaved with Factor Xa (Fig. 2 B, lane 2). Likewise, other fusion proteins were also cleaved with Factor Xa, and then the cleaved proteins were purified by a chromatographic separation. The purified proteins contained undetectable level of endotoxin (data not shown). Recombinant proteins of the NH2-terminal deletion mutants were compared for calcium mobilization in CCR1 transfectant cells. When calcium flux-inducing activity was compared at 100 nm concentration, which is the concentration shown to induce maximal calcium flux by Δ0, it was evident that agonistic potency decreases dramatically between Δ28 and Δ29 (Fig. 3 A). To further confirm that deletion of one more amino acid from Δ28 results in an almost complete loss of agonistic potency, calcium flux-inducing activity of Δ29 was compared at several different concentrations with that of Δ28 as well as that of MIP-1α. As shown in Fig. 3 B, calcium flux-inducing activity of Δ28 was dose-dependent, reaching a plateau at 10 nm. In contrast, Δ29 elicited maximal response at 100 nm, but the level was at most comparable with that of 0.1 nm of Δ28. These results show that at least 3 amino acid residues preceding the first cysteine are required for the agonistic activity. Potential differences in the agonistic potency were further examined for all of the NH2-terminal deletion mutants by varying protein concentration. We found that deletion of NH2-terminal amino acid residues up to 20 did not change agonistic potency for CCR1; the calcium flux-inducing activities of Δ5, Δ10, Δ15, and Δ20 were almost the same as that of Δ0 (Fig. 3, C and D). Lkn-1 lacking NH2-terminal 24 amino acids (Δ24), however, induced robust calcium flux responses compared with Δ0. Δ24 induced maximal calcium flux response at ∼1 nm, which is an ∼100-fold lower concentration than that required to induce similar level of response for Δ0 (Fig. 3 D). EC50 of Δ24 and Δ0 was ∼0.2 and ∼4.0 nm, respectively. Deletion of 3 or 4 more amino acid residues from Δ24 (i.e. Δ27 and Δ28) also increased agonistic potency to the same level shown by Δ24. The calcium flux-inducing activity of Δ28 as well as Δ24 appears to be stronger than that of MIP-1α (Fig. 3 B). Agonistic potency on CCR3 was also examined for all of the NH2-terminal deletion mutants using CCR3 transfectant cells, and some of the data are shown in Fig. 4. In CCR3 transfectant cells, Δ24 was the only form of the NH2-terminal deletion mutants that showed enhanced agonistic potency; the EC50 of all the other NH2-terminal deletion mutants as well as Δ0 was in the range of 40 to ∼55 nm. In contrast, the EC50 of Δ24 was ∼22 nm. The agonistic potency of Δ24, however, was lower than that of eotaxin, which showed a peak response at 50 nm with an EC50 of ∼18 nm. At a 50 nm concentration, Δ24 exhibited ∼50% of the calcium flux response to eotaxin. It is noteworthy that the EC50 of Δ24 on CCR1 was ∼ 0.2 nm, which is ∼100-fold lower than that on CCR3. To test whether loss of agonistic activity of Δ29 is due to inability to bind to CCR1, desensitization experiments were performed in CCR1 transfectant cells. As shown in theupper panel of Fig. 5 A, MIP-1α was not able to desensitize CCR1 transfectant cells completely to subsequent exposure to Δ0 or Δ28. However, stimulation of CCR1 transfectant cells with Δ0 or Δ28 completely abolished responsiveness to a second stimulation with MIP-1α. These data indicate that Δ28, as well as Δ0, shares receptors with MIP-1α and has a stronger desensitizing capability than MIP-1α. Then, we examined whether Δ29 could desensitize Δ28. Stimulation of CCR1 transfectant cells with Δ29 did not affect the ability of Δ28 to induce the subsequent calcium response, even at a concentration as high as 400 nm (Fig. 5 A). These results suggest that Δ29 may not be able to bind to CCR1. Desensitization experiments were also performed in CCR3 transfectant cells to compare desensitizing capability of Δ24 with that of eotaxin. As shown in Fig. 5 B, stimulation of CCR3 transfectant cells with eotaxin abolished responsiveness to a subsequent stimulation with Δ24. In contrast, stimulation with Δ24 did not completely abolish the ability of eotaxin to induce a calcium response. Chemotactic activities of the NH2-terminal deletion mutants of Lkn-1 were evaluated on CCR1 transfectant cells, and the results are shown in Fig. 6 A. Consistent with the calcium flux results, chemotactic activity decreased dramatically when 29 amino acids were deleted. Δ29 did not show significant chemotactic activity even at a concentration of 10 nm. Potential differences in the chemotactic activity were also examined for all of the NH2-terminal deletion mutants at different protein concentrations, and some of the results are shown in Fig. 6 A. Chemotactic activities of Δ5, Δ10, Δ15, and Δ20 were almost the same as that of Δ0. In contrast, consistent with the calcium flux results, Δ24, Δ27, or Δ28 exhibited increased chemotactic activity on CCR1 transfectants. EC50 values for Δ0, Δ5, Δ10, Δ15, and Δ20 were within a range of 0.51 to ∼0.58 nm, whereas EC50 values for Δ24, Δ27, and Δ28 were 0.09 ± 0.01, 0.17 ± 0.01, and 0.14 ± 0.02, respectively. In CCR3 transfectant cells, Δ24 was again the only form of the NH2-terminal deletion mutant of Lkn-1 that showed increased agonistic activity (Fig. 6 B). The chemotactic activity of Δ24, however, was lower than that of eotaxin. The EC50 of Δ24 was 33.0 ± 2.5, whereas that of eotaxin was 13.0 ± 1.2. Furthermore, at a concentration of 100 nm, at which eotaxin showed a peak response, Δ24 exhibited 58% of the chemotactic activity of eotaxin. Binding affinities of Lkn-1 mutant proteins with CCR1 and CCR3 were determined with125I-labeled ligands (Fig. 7). In this experiment, we focused mainly on three proteins: Δ0, which is the intact form of Lkn-1; Δ24, which is the deletion mutants with enhanced agonistic activities on CCR3 as well as CCR1; and Δ29, which essentially lacks the biological activity. Fig. 7, A and B, depicts the binding isotherm. Conversion of the data by Scatchard analysis revealed aK d of 1.00 ± 0.02 nm (Δ0) and 0.38 ± 0.01 nm (Δ24) to the CCR1 (Fig. 7 A), and 2.41 ± 0.08 nm (Δ0) and 1.05 ± 0.09 nm (Δ24) to the CCR3 (Fig. 7 B). The relative affinity of the Lkn-1 mutants was investigated further in a cross-competition binding assay using CCR1 transfectant cells (Fig. 7 C). Δ24 was more effective in inhibiting the binding of 125I-labeled Δ0 with CCR1 than Δ0. The IC50 of Δ24 was ∼26 nm, whereas that of Δ0 was ∼42 nm. Δ29, at the highest concentration tested, inhibited the binding of125I-labeled Δ0 by only 20%. It has been found that recombinant Lkn-1 produced in insect cells undergoes a spontaneous site-specific cleavage at the NH2 terminus, producing a 24-amino acid shorter protein than the intact form (11.Youn B.-S. Zhang S.M. Lee E.K. Park D.H. Broxmeyer H.E. Murphy P.M. Locati M. Pease J.E. Kim K.K. Antol K. Kwon B.S. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 5201-5205PubMed Google Scholar). The significance of this autolysis, however, has remained unknown. In the present study, the role of the NH2-terminal domain for agonistic activity was studied with a series of NH2-terminal deletion mutants of Lkn-1, including the spontaneously cleaved form (Δ24). Our preparations of NH2-terminal deletion mutants of Lkn-1 do not have any foreign amino acid residues at either the NH2 or COOH terminus of the recombinant proteins. Although recombinant Lkn-1, which has additional methionine and six histidines at its NH2terminus, has biological activities (11.Youn B.-S. Zhang S.M. Lee E.K. Park D.H. Broxmeyer H.E. Murphy P.M. Locati M. Pease J.E. Kim K.K. Antol K. Kwon B.S. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 5201-5205PubMed Google Scholar), we found that truncation of the foreign amino acid residues at the NH2 terminus of the recombinant proteins increases the biological activity by ∼10-fold (data not shown). In contrast to other CC chemokines such as MCP-1 and RANTES, deletion of NH2-terminal amino acids up to 20 residues from the natural form of Lkn-1 did not cause noticeable alterations in agonistic potency on CCR1. This feature is unique for Lkn-1, because for CC chemokines such as MCP-1 and RANTES, minimal truncation or modification of the first few NH2-terminal amino acids leads to significant changes in receptor binding and functional activity (17.Gong J.H.

Deletion of the pyroglutamate residue at the NH2terminus of the natural form of MCP-1 results in an at least 50-fold decreases in agonistic activity on monocytes and basophils (17.Gong J.H. Clark-Lewis I. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 631-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 18.Weber M. Uguccioni M. Baggiolini M. Clark-Lewis I. Dahinden C.A. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 681-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Deletion of 2 amino acid residues, MCP-1-(3–76), leads to total loss of agonistic activity on eosinophils and basophils (18.Weber M. Uguccioni M. Baggiolini M. Clark-Lewis I. Dahinden C.A. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 681-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). RANTES loses agonistic potency and becomes a potent antagonist of chemokine binding when the first amino acid residue has been modified artificially by the addition of methionine or treatment with aminooxypentane (19.Proudfoot A.E.I. Power C.A. Hoogewerf A.J. Montjovent M.-O. Borlat F. Offord R.E. Wells T.N.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2,599-2,603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (391) Google Scholar, 21.Simmons G.

Deletion of NH2-terminal amino acid residues can even result in changes in receptor specificity (18.Weber M. Uguccioni M. Baggiolini M. Clark-Lewis I. Dahinden C.A. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 681-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar,22.Gong J.H. Uguccioni M. Dewald B. Bagiolini M. Clark-Lewis I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10521-10527Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). In particular, MCP-1 acquires agonistic activity on CCR3 only when the first residue at the NH2 terminus, pyroglutamate, is deleted (18.Weber M. Uguccioni M. Baggiolini M. Clark-Lewis I. Dahinden C.A. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 681-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Similar to artificially modified chemokines, posttranslationally modified natural forms of MCP-1 such as MCP-1-(5–76) and MCP-1-(6–76) are also devoid of bioactivity (20.Proost P. Struyf S. Couvreur M. Lenaerts J.-P. Conings R. Menten P. Verhaert P. Wuyts A. Van Damme J. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 4,034-4,041Google Scholar). The naturally cleaved form of MCP-2, MCP-2-(6–76), is also devoid of bioactivity and blocks the chemotactic effects of MCP-2 as well as that of MCP-1, MCP-3, and RANTES (20.Proost P. Struyf S. Couvreur M. Lenaerts J.-P. Conings R. Menten P. Verhaert P. Wuyts A. Van Damme J. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 4,034-4,041Google Scholar). Thus, the integrity of the NH2-terminal region of CC chemokines appears to be critical for receptor binding and biological function. In fact, the search for NH2-terminal variants as receptor antagonists has been one of the major areas of interest since the discovery that chemokines inhibit HIV-1 infection (9.Cocchi F. DeVico A.L. Garzino-Demo A. Arya S.K. Gallo R.C. Lusso P. Science. 1995; 270: 1811-1815Crossref PubMed Scopus (2625) Google Scholar, 23.Oppermann M. Mark M. Proudfoot A.E.I. Olbrich H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8875-8885Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 24.Wang J.M. Oppenheim J.J. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 190: 591-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 25.Howard O.M.Z. Oppenheim J.J. Wang J.M. J. Clin. Immunol. 1999; 19: 280-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The situation is quite different for Lkn-1. Our results show that deletion of up to 20 amino acids from the intact form of Lkn-1 does not affect agonistic potency on CCR1. More interestingly, recombinant Lkn-1, which contains additional methionine and six histidines at its NH2 terminus, is only 10-fold less active the than intact form of Lkn-1. These observations suggest that the receptor binding and biological function of Lkn-1 is more dependent on the downstream amino acid residues of the NH2-terminal domain. Deletion of more amino acid residues, 24 amino acids (Δ24), increases the calcium flux-inducing activity almost 100-fold on CCR1 transfectants. These results may explain why recombinant Lkn-1 undergoes a spontaneous site-specific cleavage at the NH2 terminus producing a 24-amino acid shorter protein than the intact form (10.Wolpe S.D. Davatelis G. Sherry B. Beutler B. Hesse D.G. Nguyen H.T. Moldawer L.L. Nathan C.F. Lowry S.F. Cerami A. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 167: 570-581Crossref Scopus (462) Google Scholar). For Lkn-1, posttranscriptional modification may be a mechanism to augment chemokine potency on CCR1. This is also true for CCR3; Δ24 shows increased calcium flux-inducing activity in CCR3 transfectants compared with that of the intact form of Lkn-1. Deletion of 27 or 28 amino acids (Δ27 or Δ28) also produces a protein that has increased calcium flux-inducing activity on CCR1 transfectants. Deletion of 29 amino acid residues (Δ29), however, abolishes the calcium flux-inducing activity almost completely, showing that at least 3 amino acid residues preceding the first cysteine are essential for the biological activity of Lkn-1. Because deletion or proteolytic cleavage of the NH2-terminal region usually results in derivatives that still recognize the receptor but do not induce functional responses, we were curious to know whether Δ29 acts as an antagonist of Lkn-1. This issue was addressed by receptor binding experiments as well as desensitization experiments. As shown in Fig. 6 A, Δ29 was unable to desensitize calcium flux-inducing activity of Δ28 even at 400 nm concentration. Furthermore, receptor binding experiments showed that Δ29 was not able to bind to CCR1 effectively. Thus, it was obvious that deletion of 29 amino acids at the NH2 terminus inactivates the receptor binding capability of Lkn-1. This feature is unique for Lkn-1 in that it does not produce antagonists by truncations of the NH2-terminal domain. Although cleavage of the NH2-terminal region increases the agonistic potency on CCR1, the length of the NH2-terminal region does not proportionally affect agonistic potency; Δ24, Δ27, and Δ28 show similarly potent biological activity in both calcium flux assays and migration assays. This feature is in contrast with that of hemofiltrate CC chemokine (HCC)-1, a recently cloned CC chemokine that is structurally similar to MIP-1α (26.Schulz-Knappe P. Magert H.-J. Dewald B. Meyer M. Cetin Y. Kubbies M. Tomeczkowski J. Kirchhoff K. Raida M. Andermann K. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 295-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Comparison of the three NH2-terminal truncated variants of HCC-1 revealed that the rank order of potency was inversely correlated with the length of the protein. Thus, the shortest form of HCC-1 was the most potent, and the longest form of HCC-1 was the least potent (27.Tsou C.-L. Gladue R.P. Carroll L.A. Paradis T. Boyd J.G. Nelson R.T. Neote K. Charo I.F. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 603-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). To examine whether increased agonistic potency shown by the deletion mutants is due to increased binding affinity to receptors, we also performed receptor binding assays for Δ0 and Δ24. Based on theK d values, Δ24 appeared to have an ∼2.6-fold higher binding affinity on CCR1 than Δ0. Cross-competition experiments using labeled Δ0 also showed that Δ24 had higher binding affinity on CCR1 than Δ0. Because both Δ27 and Δ28 have similarly strong agonistic potency as Δ24 on CCR1, it is reasonable to assume that Δ27 and Δ28 would also have similar binding affinity as Δ24 on CCR1. In CCR3 transfectants, Δ24 showed an ∼2.3-fold higher binding affinity than Δ0. Thus, it appears that the increased agonistic potency of the NH2-terminal deletion mutants is due, at least in part, to the increased binding affinity to receptors. We thank Dr. Ji-Ming Wang for providing transfectant cell lines and for critical comments on this manuscript."

Restriction endonucleases are excellent model systems for the study of specific protein-DNA interactions because of their extraordinary specificity in DNA recognition. Type II restriction endonucleases form a homodimer to recognize their palindromic, double-stranded DNA recognition sequence. Both subunits display a characteristic 2-fold rotational symmetry when they contact their recognition sequence. This has been shown by crystal structure analyzes of several type II restriction endonucleases in complex with their DNA substrates (1.Pingoud A. Jeltsch A.

Topal M.D. Science. 1995; 267: 1817-1820Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The crystal structures of NaeI and of theNaeI·DNA complex revealed a NaeI dimer that had two domains per monomer, the endo and the topo domain (12.Huai Q. Colandene J.D. Chen Y. Luo F. Zhao Y.

The endo domain forms a DNA binding motif that is structurally related to other type II restriction endonucleases and harbors the catalytic center. The topo domain contains a catabolite activator protein (CAP) motif for DNA binding (12.Huai Q. Colandene J.D. Chen Y. Luo F. Zhao Y. Topal M.D. Ke H. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3110-3118Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Both topo and both endo domains bind one double-stranded DNA recognition sequence (12.Huai Q. Colandene J.D. Chen Y. Luo F. Zhao Y.

Thus, two different structural motifs of NaeI recognize the same DNA recognition sequence and are assigned to an activator and a substrate binding site.

In addition to DNA binding regions I and II, recent, more comprehensive sequence alignments of restriction endonucleases that recognize terminal CC/GG base pairs within their recognition sequence suggest a third region ofEcoRII (starting from amino acid 298) that could be involved in DNA recognition and catalysis. 1V. Pingoud and V. Siksnys, personal communication.1V. Pingoud and V. Siksnys, personal communication. Although specific regions involved in DNA recognition have been identified, it is not known which particular amino acids of EcoRII contact specific bases of the DNA recognition sequence. Furthermore, it is not known if contacts are identical for both strands of the recognition sequence. To answer these questions using a He/Cd laser we photocross-linked EcoRII to oligonucleotide duplexes that contained a single recognition sequence for EcoRII.

Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 15410-15417Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar).Here we report the cross-linking of EcoRII to the 5′-C of the 5′-CCAGG strand that was replaced by 5-iododeoxycytidine. Because we did not find a cross-link to the 5′-C position of the opposite 5′-CCTGG strand, the cross-linking pattern of EcoRII to the DNA recognition sequence appears asymmetric. Moreover, RP-HPLC and Edman degradation of tryptic peptides of cross-linked and freeEcoRII revealed amino acids 25–49 of EcoRII to be the cross-linked peptide. Mutational analysis of position Tyr41 of this peptide in the EcoRII amino acid sequence led us to conclude that this amino acid contributes to specific DNA recognition of EcoRII.DISCUSSIONIn this photocross-linking study we searched for base-specific contacts of EcoRII to the recognition sequence 5′-CCWGG. In agreement with results that were found for other nucleic acid base substitutions (33.Karpova E.A. Kubareva E.A. Shabarova Z.A. IUBMB Life. 1999; 48: 91-98Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34.Yolov A.A. Gromova E.S. Romanova E.A. Oretskaya T.S. Oganov A.A. Buryanov Y.I. Shabarova Z.A. FEBS Lett. 1984; 167: 147-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), EcoRII recognized in particular those substrates that were substituted at the 5′-C pair and at the central A/T of both strands. Some of the X and Y substitutions that we introduced in the recognition sequence for photocross-linking inhibited or even prevented DNA binding by EcoRII. Although this limited the possible cross-linking substrates to those thatEcoRII bound to, we found that most probably amino acid Tyr41 of EcoRII is involved in the cross-link to the oligonucleotide duplex that contained Y at the 5′-C position of the 5′-CCAGG strand of the recognition sequence. For this particular photocross-link, we obtained a yield of around 45%.Although EcoRII bound to the oligonucleotide duplex that contained Y at the 5′-C position of the 5′-CCTGG strand, we did not find a cross-link to this position. Thus, the cross-linking pattern ofEcoRII is asymmetric. This asymmetry was not caused by the base pairs flanking the recognition sequence, but rather by the asymmetric central A/T pair within the otherwise palindromic recognition sequence. Therefore, the partial asymmetry at the central A/T pair of the EcoRII recognition sequence induces the asymmetric DNA binding by the restriction endonucleaseEcoRII.Because of the high cross-linking yield and because Y is a zero-length cross-linker, we propose that the Tyr41 residue ofEcoRII is in close proximity of the DNA recognition sequence in the EcoRII-DNA complex. It is known from co-crystal structures of type II restriction endonucleases that the OH group in the side chain of Tyr can form a hydrogen bond to the phosphate backbone of DNA (Tyr99 and Tyr144 ofBglII) (35.Lukacs C.M. Kucera R. Schildkraut I. Aggarwal A.K. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 2: 134-140Google Scholar). Furthermore, Tyr is able to form water-mediated contacts to the phosphate backbone of DNA (Tyr165 ofBamHI) (36.Newman M. Strzelecka T. Dorner L.F. Schildkraut I. Aggarwal A.K. Nature. 1994; 368: 660-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) or water-mediated contacts to the bases of the recognition sequence (Tyr190 of BglII) (35.Lukacs C.M. Kucera R. Schildkraut I. Aggarwal A.K. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 2: 134-140Google Scholar). Similarly, Tyr41 of EcoRII could interact with the DNA substrate.Residues of the conserved catalytic centers of restriction endonucleases are typically charged amino acids, namely two acidic (Asp, Glu) and one basic (Lys) amino acid. Thus, Tyr41, which is not charged, should not be one of the active site residues (2.Kovall R.A. Matthews B.W. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 1999; 3: 578-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Rather Tyr41 is involved in DNA binding. Recent sequence homology studies of restriction endonucleases that recognize CC/GG pairs within their different recognition sequences, includingEcoRII support this hypothesis.1 Based on these homology studies, the C-terminal sequence motif298PDX24KX11E has been predicted to be the putative active site of EcoRII.The properties of the mutant enzyme Y41A supported our conclusion that Tyr41 is involved in specific DNA binding, because substitution of Tyr41 by Ala reduced DNA binding affinity by more than five orders of magnitude (i.e. beyond the detection limit of the electrophoretic mobility shift assay). However, the mutant enzyme Y41A retained some cleavage activity. This low cleavage activity is most probably due to impaired DNA binding. If one compares the three mutant enzymes that we have studied (H36G, H36A, Y41A), it can be inferred that the more DNA binding affinity is reduced, the more DNA cleavage activity is reduced. In contrast to the mutant enzymes H36A and H36G, the mutant enzyme Y41A did not yield a cross-link. This confirms our assumption that Tyr41 is the cross-linking amino acid.Amino acid Tyr41, as well as the amino acids 25–49 of the cross-linking peptide, are not part of DNA binding regions I or II that had been found by membrane-bound peptide libraries. Because membrane-bound peptide libraries emphasize the contribution of electrostatic binding at the expense of other more specific protein-DNA interactions, these libraries are not suitable to identify individual amino acid residues of EcoRII that contact the specific DNA recognition sequence (18.Reuter M. Schneider-Mergener J. Kupper D. Meisel A. Mackeldanz P. Krüger D.H. Schroeder C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5213-5221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Therefore, the identification of Tyr41 as the main cross-linking amino acid has added a new element involved in DNA recognition by EcoRII. Furthermore, it confirms that the N-terminal part of EcoRII substantially contributes to DNA-binding of EcoRII.If on assumes a two-domain structure for EcoRII, as reported for NaeI, the N terminus of EcoRII, including amino acids 25–49, might be a DNA binding domain corresponding to the topo domain of NaeI (12.Huai Q. Colandene J.D. Chen Y. Luo F. Zhao Y. Topal M.D. Ke H. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3110-3118Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13.Huai Q. Colandene J.D. Topal M.D. Ke H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 665-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The N terminus ofEcoRII may correspond to the C-terminal topo domain ofNaeI, because all known mutations of the N-terminal DNA binding region I as well as the substitutions of His36 and Tyr41 by Ala have primarily affected DNA binding and consequently DNA cleavage by EcoRII (18.Reuter M.

On the other hand, mutations in the C-terminal DNA binding region II of EcoRII affected DNA cleavage but never severely affected DNA binding (18.Reuter M. Schneider-Mergener J. Kupper D. Meisel A. Mackeldanz P. Krüger D.H. Schroeder C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5213-5221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Therefore, we propose that Tyr41 is part of the DNA binding site of the effector (activator) domain. Restriction endonucleases are excellent model systems for the study of specific protein-DNA interactions because of their extraordinary specificity in DNA recognition. Type II restriction endonucleases form a homodimer to recognize their palindromic, double-stranded DNA recognition sequence. Both subunits display a characteristic 2-fold rotational symmetry when they contact their recognition sequence. This has been shown by crystal structure analyzes of several type II restriction endonucleases in complex with their DNA substrates (1.Pingoud A. Jeltsch A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 3705-3727Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar, 2.Kovall R.A. Matthews B.W. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 1999; 3: 578-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar).

Because we did not find a cross-link to the 5′-C position of the opposite 5′-CCTGG strand, the cross-linking pattern of EcoRII to the DNA recognition sequence appears asymmetric. Moreover, RP-HPLC and Edman degradation of tryptic peptides of cross-linked and freeEcoRII revealed amino acids 25–49 of EcoRII to be the cross-linked peptide. Mutational analysis of position Tyr41 of this peptide in the EcoRII amino acid sequence led us to conclude that this amino acid contributes to specific DNA recognition of EcoRII. DISCUSSIONIn this photocross-linking study we searched for base-specific contacts of EcoRII to the recognition sequence 5′-CCWGG. In agreement with results that were found for other nucleic acid base substitutions (33.Karpova E.A. Kubareva E.A. Shabarova Z.A. IUBMB Life. 1999; 48: 91-98Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34.Yolov A.A. Gromova E.S. Romanova E.A. Oretskaya T.S. Oganov A.A. Buryanov Y.I. Shabarova Z.A. FEBS Lett. 1984; 167: 147-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), EcoRII recognized in particular those substrates that were substituted at the 5′-C pair and at the central A/T of both strands. Some of the X and Y substitutions that we introduced in the recognition sequence for photocross-linking inhibited or even prevented DNA binding by EcoRII. Although this limited the possible cross-linking substrates to those thatEcoRII bound to, we found that most probably amino acid Tyr41 of EcoRII is involved in the cross-link to the oligonucleotide duplex that contained Y at the 5′-C position of the 5′-CCAGG strand of the recognition sequence. For this particular photocross-link, we obtained a yield of around 45%.Although EcoRII bound to the oligonucleotide duplex that contained Y at the 5′-C position of the 5′-CCTGG strand, we did not find a cross-link to this position. Thus, the cross-linking pattern ofEcoRII is asymmetric. This asymmetry was not caused by the base pairs flanking the recognition sequence, but rather by the asymmetric central A/T pair within the otherwise palindromic recognition sequence. Therefore, the partial asymmetry at the central A/T pair of the EcoRII recognition sequence induces the asymmetric DNA binding by the restriction endonucleaseEcoRII.Because of the high cross-linking yield and because Y is a zero-length cross-linker, we propose that the Tyr41 residue ofEcoRII is in close proximity of the DNA recognition sequence in the EcoRII-DNA complex. It is known from co-crystal structures of type II restriction endonucleases that the OH group in the side chain of Tyr can form a hydrogen bond to the phosphate backbone of DNA (Tyr99 and Tyr144 ofBglII) (35.Lukacs C.M. Kucera R. Schildkraut I. Aggarwal A.K. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 2: 134-140Google Scholar). Furthermore, Tyr is able to form water-mediated contacts to the phosphate backbone of DNA (Tyr165 ofBamHI) (36.Newman M. Strzelecka T. Dorner L.F. Schildkraut I. Aggarwal A.K. Nature. 1994; 368: 660-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) or water-mediated contacts to the bases of the recognition sequence (Tyr190 of BglII) (35.Lukacs C.M. Kucera R. Schildkraut I. Aggarwal A.K. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 2: 134-140Google Scholar). Similarly, Tyr41 of EcoRII could interact with the DNA substrate.Residues of the conserved catalytic centers of restriction endonucleases are typically charged amino acids, namely two acidic (Asp, Glu) and one basic (Lys) amino acid. Thus, Tyr41, which is not charged, should not be one of the active site residues (2.Kovall R.A. Matthews B.W. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 1999; 3: 578-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Rather Tyr41 is involved in DNA binding. Recent sequence homology studies of restriction endonucleases that recognize CC/GG pairs within their different recognition sequences, includingEcoRII support this hypothesis.1 Based on these homology studies, the C-terminal sequence motif298PDX24KX11E has been predicted to be the putative active site of EcoRII.The properties of the mutant enzyme Y41A supported our conclusion that Tyr41 is involved in specific DNA binding, because substitution of Tyr41 by Ala reduced DNA binding affinity by more than five orders of magnitude (i.e. beyond the detection limit of the electrophoretic mobility shift assay). However, the mutant enzyme Y41A retained some cleavage activity. This low cleavage activity is most probably due to impaired DNA binding. If one compares the three mutant enzymes that we have studied (H36G, H36A, Y41A), it can be inferred that the more DNA binding affinity is reduced, the more DNA cleavage activity is reduced. In contrast to the mutant enzymes H36A and H36G, the mutant enzyme Y41A did not yield a cross-link. This confirms our assumption that Tyr41 is the cross-linking amino acid.Amino acid Tyr41, as well as the amino acids 25–49 of the cross-linking peptide, are not part of DNA binding regions I or II that had been found by membrane-bound peptide libraries. Because membrane-bound peptide libraries emphasize the contribution of electrostatic binding at the expense of other more specific protein-DNA interactions, these libraries are not suitable to identify individual amino acid residues of EcoRII that contact the specific DNA recognition sequence (18.Reuter M.

Therefore, the identification of Tyr41 as the main cross-linking amino acid has added a new element involved in DNA recognition by EcoRII. Furthermore, it confirms that the N-terminal part of EcoRII substantially contributes to DNA-binding of EcoRII.If on assumes a two-domain structure for EcoRII, as reported for NaeI, the N terminus of EcoRII, including amino acids 25–49, might be a DNA binding domain corresponding to the topo domain of NaeI (12.Huai Q. Colandene J.D. Chen Y. Luo F. Zhao Y. Topal M.D. Ke H. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3110-3118Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13.Huai Q. Colandene J.D. Topal M.D. Ke H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 665-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The N terminus ofEcoRII may correspond to the C-terminal topo domain ofNaeI, because all known mutations of the N-terminal DNA binding region I as well as the substitutions of His36 and Tyr41 by Ala have primarily affected DNA binding and consequently DNA cleavage by EcoRII (18.Reuter M.

On the other hand, mutations in the C-terminal DNA binding region II of EcoRII affected DNA cleavage but never severely affected DNA binding (18.Reuter M. Schneider-Mergener J. Kupper D. Meisel A.

The Ca2+-ATPase activity to monitor denaturation was assessed after treatment with 20 mmCa2+ to release tightly bound Mg2+/F−. The purification and delipidation was successfully achieved with Reactive Red-agarose affinity chromatography. The solubilized Mg2+/F--bound Ca2+-ATPase was very rapidly denatured at pH 8, but was perfectly stabilized at pH 6 against denaturation for over 20 days at 4 °C even without exogenously added phospholipid and at a high C12E8/enzyme weight ratio (10:1). The activity was not restored unless the enzyme was treated with 20 mmCa2+, showing that tightly bound Mg2+/F− was not released during the long term incubation. The perfect stability was attained with or without 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, but inactivation occurred with a half-life of 10 days in the presence of 1 mmdithiothreitol, possibly due to reduction of a specific disulfide bond(s). The remarkable stability is likely conferred by intimate gathering of cytoplasmic domains of Ca2+-ATPase molecule induced by tight binding of Mg2+/F-.

According to theE1/E2 theory, the enzyme with bound Ca2+ (E1) is autophosphorylated by MgATP to form ADP-sensitive phosphoenzyme (E1P). This phosphorylation causes occlusion of the bound Ca2+ at the transport sites, and the subsequent conformational transition to ADP-insensitive form (E2P) releases Ca2+ into the lumen. Finally, dephosphorylation takes place and returns the enzyme into unphosphorylated and Ca2+-unbound form (E2). E2P can also be formed from Pi in the presence of Mg2+ and absence of Ca2+ by reversal of its hydrolysis. sarcoplasmic reticulum ADP-sensitive phophoenzyme ADP-insensitive phosphoenzyme 3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid 3-[4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazinyl]propanesulfonic acid octaethylene glycol monododecyl ether butylated hydroxytoluene high performance liquid chromatography fluorescein 5-isothiocyanate Recently, the three-dimensional structure of Ca2+-ATPase with bound Ca2+ was solved by x-ray crystallography at an atomic level (5.Toyoshima C. Nakasako M. Nomura H. Ogawa H. Nature. 2000; 405: 647-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (1619) Google Scholar). The enzyme has three cytoplasmic domains (A, N, and P), which are widely separated in the crystal structure with bound Ca2+. The modeling with a low resolution map of tubular crystals formed in the presence of decavanadate revealed that three cytoplasmic domains gather to form a single headpiece in the tubular crystals (5.Toyoshima C. Nakasako M. Nomura H. Ogawa H. Nature. 2000; 405: 647-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (1619) Google Scholar), although the state of the enzyme in the tubular crystals was ambiguous. Our previous limited and systematic proteolysis experiments showed (6.Danko S. Daiho T. Yamasaki K. Kamidochi M. Suzuki H. Toyoshima C. FEBS Lett. 2001; 489: 277-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 7.Danko S. Yamasaki K. Daiho T. Suzuki H. Toyoshima C. FEBS Lett. 2001; 505: 129-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) that the decavanadate-bound state is very similar to E2P and thatE2P is the intermediate having the most compactly organized headpiece. The results further indicated that a large motion of A domain, i.e. rotation by ∼90°, and its strong association with P and N domains most likely occur during theE1P to E2P transition and suggested that the stabilization energy provided by intimate contacts between all three cytoplasmic domains in E2P will provide energy for moving transmembrane helices and release the bound Ca2+ ions. For understanding mechanism of energy coupling in the Ca2+ transport, it is essential to reveal the structure of this key intermediate, E2P, at an atomic level. The stability of the enzyme is a prerequisite for crystallization; the conditions required for stability and crystallization necessarily overlap. For formation of three-dimensional crystals of the Ca2+-bound Ca2+-ATPase, Ca2+ at very high concentrations (10–20 mm) is an essential factor for stabilization against detergent-induced denaturation (8.Pikula S. Mullner N. Dux L. Martonosi A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 5277-5286Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Ca2+ bound at the transport sites likely contributes to stabilization of the transmembrane helices and thus, at least in part, to resistance against denaturation. On the other hand, two very serious problems impeding structural studies of E2P are its inherent nature as a transient intermediate (being hydrolyzed within seconds) and the fact that the enzyme without bound Ca2+ is usually very rapidly denatured by solubilization with detergents (8.Pikula S.

The enzyme with bound Mg2+/F− was shown to be stable even against thermal inactivation (13.Murphy A.J. Coll R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16990-16994Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We further demonstrated by the systematic and limited proteolysis (6.Danko S. Daiho T. Yamasaki K. Kamidochi M. Suzuki H. Toyoshima C.

FEBS Lett. 2001; 505: 129-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) that the cytoplasmic domain organization of the enzyme with tightly bound Mg2+/F− is actually the same as that of E2P formed from Pi, being very compact and completely resistant to all proteinase K, V8 protease, and trypsin at T2 site. The Mg2+·F−·E2 complex is thus analogous to E2P in its structure. In the present study, taking advantage of the tight binding nature of the Mg2+·F−·E2complex, we explored effects of solubilization, purification, and delipidation of this complex on stability against denaturation. We report here that the C12E8-solubilized Mg2+·F−·E2 complex is remarkably stable against denaturation and can be purified and delipidated by affinity column chromatography and that the Mg2+·F−·E2 complex thus obtained is perfectly stable for long term incubation in C12E8 in the absence of Ca2+ even without exogenously added phospholipid under defined conditions that are suitable for structural studies at an atomic level.

The Ca2+-ATPase with tightly bound Mg2+/F− in vesicles or in solubilized form was treated with 20 mm Ca2+ in 100 mm Tris/HCl (pH 7.4) for 1 h at 25 °C, as described previously (14.Kubota T. Daiho T. Kanazawa T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1163: 131-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). This treatment resulted in the entire release of the bound F− and Mg2+ and therefore complete restoration of the Ca2+-ATPase activity. The total ATPase activity was determined at 25 °C in a medium containing 10 μg/ml protein, 5 mg/ml C12E8, 5 mm[γ-32P]ATP, 7 mm MgCl2, 0.1m KCl, 0.5 mm CaCl2, 0.4 mm EGTA (0.11 mm free Ca2+), and 50 mm MOPS/Tris (pH 7.0). The Ca2+-ATPase activity was obtained by subtracting the Ca2+-independent ATPase activity, which was determined in the presence of 5 mm EGTA without added CaCl2, otherwise as above. The tightly bound Mg2+/F− were released immediately before the ATPase assay as described above, by mixing samples with an equal volume of 40 mm CaCl2 in 200 mm Tris/HCl (pH 7.4). The C12E8-solubilized Ca2+-ATPase with tightly bound Mg2+/F− was purified in the absence of divalent cations by the use of Reactive Red 120-agarose (type 3000-CL, Sigma) with modifications of the method employed for the Ca2+-bound Ca2+-ATPase (18.Coll R.J. Murphy A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 14249-14254Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19.Stokes D.L. Green N.M. Biophys. J. 1990; 57: 1-14Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar); the Mg2+/F−-treated vesicles (2 mg of protein) were solubilized at 4 °C in 0.5 ml of a medium containing 10 mg/ml C12E8, 20% (v/v) glycerol, 20 mmMES/NaOH (pH 6.0), and 1 mm EDTA. After centrifugation at 150,000 × g, 4 °C for 15 min, the supernatant was applied to the Reactive Red column (bed volume, 0.2 ml) preequilibrated with the column buffer (1 mg/ml C12E8, 20% (v/v) glycerol, 20 mm MES/NaOH (pH 6.0), and 1 mm EDTA) at 4 °C. The column was washed with 1.0 ml of the column buffer, and then the Ca2+-ATPase was eluted with the column buffer containing 5 mm ADP. The Ca2+-ATPase thus purified and delipidated was concentrated and washed to remove ADP repeatedly by the centrifugal filter device Microcon YM-30 (Millipore Corp.) at 14,000 × g, 4 °C with a buffer containing 20% (v/v) glycerol, 0.1 mKCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 2 μg/ml BHT, 3 mm NaN3, 1 mm EGTA, and 20 mm MES/NaOH (pH 6.0). The concentration of ADP remaining in the sample was estimated by absorbance at 259 nm in the filtrate and that of C12E8 was determined according to Garewal (20.Garewal H.S. Anal. Biochem. 1973; 54: 319-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The phospholipid content was determined by extracting phospholipids with chloroform/methanol (2:1 v/v) and then digesting with perchloric acid, as described previously (21.McClare C.W.F. Anal. Biochem. 1971; 39: 527-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). SR vesicles untreated or treated with Mg2+/F− were solubilized with C12E8 as described above. After centrifugation, the supernatant was subjected to size exclusion HPLC at 25 °C by the use of TSKgel G3000SW column (0.75 × 30 cm, Tosoh, Japan) at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min with a buffer containing 1 mg/ml C12E8, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm CaCl2, and 20 mm MOPS/Tris (pH 7.0). The absorbance of eluted protein was monitored at 280 nm. Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Lowry et al. (22.Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with bovine serum albumin as a standard. C12E8 was obtained from Nikko Chemicals (Tokyo, Japan). [γ-32P]ATP was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Phosphatidylcholine (from frozen egg yolk) was purchased from Sigma. All the chemicals were of the highest purity available. Data were analyzed by nonlinear regression using the program Origin (Microcal Software, Northampton, MA). Mg2+/F−-treated or untreated SR vesicles were incubated for various periods with C12E8 at a high detergent/protein weight ratio (10:1) and pH 6.0, 25 °C in the presence of 20% (v/v) glycerol. The vesicles were then treated with 20 mm Ca2+ for 1 h, and the Ca2+-ATPase activity was determined (Fig. 1). In the control experiments with vesicles untreated with Mg2+/F−, the activity was rapidly decreased and completely abolished in about 24 h when Ca2+ was absent during the C12E8incubation, while almost no loss in the activity was observed when 20 mm Ca2+ was present. The results are consistent with the previously observed protection of the Ca2+-ATPase by high concentrations of Ca2+ against detergent-induced denaturation (8.Pikula S. Mullner N. Dux L. Martonosi A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 5277-5286Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, the Ca2+-ATPase of the Mg2+/F−-treated vesicles was strongly resistant to denaturation in the absence of Ca2+, showing only small loss of the activity in 48 h. It should also be noted that the Mg2+/F−-treated vesicles showed no Ca2+-ATPase activity unless they were treated with 20 mm Ca2+ immediately before the ATPase assay to release the tightly bound Mg2+/F−. In another set of experiments, we confirmed that the Ca2+-ATPase in Mg2+/F−-treated vesicles as well as in untreated vesicles was completely solubilized with C12E8 under conditions in the above experiments, and thus full Ca2+-ATPase activity of the solubilized vesicles was recovered in the supernatant after centrifugation at 150,000 × g, 15 min (data not shown). Full activity was actually recovered in the supernatant even at a C12E8/protein weight ratio as low as 2. To develop conditions under which the Ca2+-ATPase in the solubilized Mg2+/F−-treated vesicles is perfectly stable against denaturation for long term, incubation in C12E8 in the absence of Ca2+ was performed at different pH values and at 25 and 4 °C (Fig. 2). At 25 °C, the enzyme was very rapidly inactivated at pH 8.0, but it was maximally stabilized when pH was reduced to 6.0 (Fig. 2A). The stabilization by lowering pH is remarkable: more than 200-fold decrease in the inactivation rate with lowering pH from 8.0 to 6.0. It was previously reported (8.Pikula S. Mullner N. Dux L. Martonosi A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 5277-5286Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11.Lund S. Orlowski S. de Foresta B. Champeil P. le Maire M. Møller J.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4907-4915Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that the C12E8-solubilized Ca2+-ATPase (without bound Mg2+/F−) is more stable at pH 6 than at pH 8, both in the presence and absence of Ca2+, but the inactivation rates differ by only about 3-fold. We then examined the long term stability at the optimum pH at 25 and 4 °C and found that the Ca2+-ATPase was completely protected at 4 °C against inactivation with no loss of the activity even after 14 days (Fig. 2B). The Mg2+/F−-treated vesicles showed no Ca2+-ATPase activity unless they were treated with 20 mm Ca2+ immediately before the ATPase assay, thus tightly bound Mg2+/F− were not released during the long term incubation. We also examined possible effects of phosphatidylcholine, because it was previously reported (8.Pikula S. Mullner N. Dux L. Martonosi A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 5277-5286Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that the decreased activity of the C12E8-incubated Ca2+-ATPase with bound Ca2+ was partially restored by addition of phospholipids. In the present experiments, phosphatidylcholine in large excess over protein (100:1 weight ratio) was added to the C12E8-incubated samples, and then the tightly bound Mg2+/F− were released, and the Ca2+-ATPase activity was determined. Although the activity was somewhat higher in the presence of phosphatidylcholine, the inactivation rates obtained at 25 °C with and without addition of phosphatidylcholine were essentially the same; thus no restoration of the lost activity was observed. For formation of three-dimensional crystals of the Ca2+-ATPase and its structural studies, it is essential to purify the enzyme as the solubilized and delipidated form and to develop conditions in which the enzyme thus purified is perfectly stable during long term incubation without being denatured. For Mg2+·F−·E2 complex, Ca2+ should be eliminated from the systems to avoid release of the tightly bound Mg2+/F−. In the following experiments, we established methods and conditions for fulfilling these requirements by using a Reactive Red-agarose affinity column, which has been successfully employed for the Ca2+-bound Ca2+-ATPase (18.Coll R.J. Murphy A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 14249-14254Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19.Stokes D.L. Green N.M. Biophys. J. 1990; 57: 1-14Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Since it was previously shown (14.Kubota T. Daiho T. Kanazawa T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1163: 131-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar,15.Daiho T. Kubota T. Kanazawa T. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 10021-10026Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) that the nucleotide binding pocket of Ca2+-ATPase with tightly bound Mg2+/F− is still available for high affinity binding of metal-free ATP (but not to ATP complexed with Mg2+), we performed the chromatography in the absence of divalent cations (Fig. 3). In Fig. 3, Mg2+/F−-treated vesicles were solubilized with C12E8 and applied to the Reactive Red-agarose column. A large portion of the Ca2+-ATPase was bound to the column, and ∼65% of the total Ca2+-ATPase activity was recovered with 5 mm ADP in fractions 10–17. The specific Ca2+-ATPase activity in these fractions (6.7 ± 0.4 μmol/mg/min) was ∼1.7 times higher than the activity of the solubilized vesicles (cf. Figs. 1 and 2B) (note that the Ca2+-ATPase activity in Fig. 3 was expressed as μmol/min/ml of fraction). None of these fractions exhibited Ca2+-ATPase activity unless they were treated with 20 mm Ca2+, and thus the tightly bound Mg2+/F− in the Mg2+·F−·E2 complex was not released during the chromatography. On the SDS-polyacrylamide gel stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 after electrophoresis (23.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar), only a single band at 110 kDa corresponding to the Ca2+-ATPase chain was found without any other bands for these fractions (data not shown). The lipid content was reduced by this chromatography from 84 mol of phospholipids/mol of Ca2+-ATPase in SR vesicles to 4 mol of phospholipids/mol of Ca2+-ATPase in the purified form. The phospholipid content in this purified enzyme is similar to or lower than that of other delipidated enzyme preparations reported (8.Pikula S. Mullner N. Dux L. Martonosi A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 5277-5286Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19.Stokes D.L. Green N.M. Biophys. J. 1990; 57: 1-14Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The rest of the Ca2+-ATPase was eluted nonspecifically upon addition of 2m NaCl with some other proteins. The Ca2+-ATPase with tightly bound Mg2+/F− thus delipidated and eluted with ADP was washed repeatedly by a centrifugal filter device to remove ADP and to concentrate the enzyme. After washing, the concentration of ADP in the samples was lower than 10 μm and was much lower than that of the Ca2+-ATPase (∼100 μm). The concentration of C12E8 in the samples was ∼10 mg/ml. The Ca2+-ATPase activity of thus purified enzyme (determined after release of tightly bound Mg2+/F− by the Ca2+ treatment) was 7.1 ± 0.2 μmol/mg/min (n = 8) (see the activity at incubation time zero in Fig. 4) and ∼1.8 times higher than the activity of the solubilized Mg2+/F−-treated vesicles (determined after release of tightly bound Mg2+/F−) (cf. Figs. 1 and 2B). In a separate set of experiments as a control, we also purified Ca2+-ATPase from SR vesicles untreated with Mg2+/F− according to original procedure (18.Coll R.J. Murphy A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 14249-14254Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19.Stokes D.L. Green N.M. Biophys. J. 1990; 57: 1-14Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) using the affinity column in the presence of Ca2+, which protects the enzyme against detergent-induced denaturation. The Ca2+-ATPase activity of the enzyme thus purified was 6.9 ± 0.6 μmol/mg/min (n = 7). Therefore, the activity of the purified enzyme with tightly bound Mg2+/F− (determined after release of Mg2+/F−) was essentially the same as that expected for optimally prepared enzyme. The purified Ca2+-ATPase with tightly bound Mg2+/F− (1 mg/ml) was then incubated in 10 mg/ml C12E8 at pH 6.0 in the absence of Ca2+ at 25 or 4 °C with or without exogenously added phosphatidylcholine under the conditions thus adaptable to formation of three-dimensional crystals of the enzyme. After incubation for various periods, the samples were treated with 20 mmCa2+, and the Ca2+-ATPase activity was determined (Fig. 4). When incubated at 25 °C, the activity decreased with a rate similar to that for the solubilized Mg2+/F−-treated vesicles at 25 °C (cf. Fig. 2). When incubated at 4 °C, the Ca2+-ATPase was perfectly stable over 20 days with no loss of the activity. Addition of phospholipid was not required for the stabilization. The enzyme showed no Ca2+-ATPase activity unless it was treated with 20 mm Ca2+ before the ATPase assay; therefore, the tightly bound Mg2+/F− was not released during the incubation. The fact that the Mg2+·F−·E2 complex is thus perfectly stable at the very high C12E8/enzyme ratio without exogenously added phospholipids would be highly advantageous for formation of three-dimensional crystals in the effort to search an appropriate amount of C12E8 (which would generally be much lower than that explored in this study) and a suitable type and amount of exogenous phospholipids (19.Stokes D.L. Green N.M. Biophys. J. 1990; 57: 1-14Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). We found also that the Ca2+-ATPase with tightly bound Mg2+/F− was completely stable at 4 °C during the incubation both with and without 0.1 mm DTT and that, however, the Ca2+-ATPase activity decreased in the presence of 1 mm DTT with a half-life of about 10 days (data not shown). It is possible that a specific disulfide bond(s) of the enzyme, of which reduction results in a loss of the Ca2+-ATPase activity (due to blocking of theE1P to E2P transition) (24.Daiho T. Kanazawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11060-11064Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was reduced by DTT at the higher concentration during the long term incubation. For comparison, the Mg2+/F−-free Ca2+-ATPase was purified in the absence of Ca2+from SR vesicles untreated with Mg2+/F−, as the Mg2+/F−-bound enzyme. More than half of the Ca2+-ATPase activity was lost during this purification process that took about 2 h at 4 °C, and the remaining activity was completely lost within a few hours when incubated as in Fig. 4 with C12E8 at 4 °C (data not shown). Thus, protection of the purified and delipidated Ca2+-ATPase by tightly bound Mg2+/F− against denaturation is remarkable. It was previously suggested (8.Pikula S. Mullner N. Dux L. Martonosi A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 5277-5286Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that detergent-solubilized Ca2+-ATPase with bound Ca2+ is stabilized against denaturation by formation of its oligomeric form. In the present study, we thus performed size exclusion HPLC as described under “Experimental Procedures” and observed that C12E8-solubilized Ca2+-ATPase with tightly bound Mg2+/F− eluted predominantly at the position corresponding to its monomeric form but not to the possible dimeric or higher oligomeric form (data not shown). We previously demonstrated (6, 7; see Introduction), on the other hand, that three cytoplasmic domains of the Ca2+-ATPase molecule gather to form a very compactly organized single headpiece by tight binding of Mg2+/F−. The observed remarkable stability of the solubilized and delipidated enzyme with tightly bound Mg2+/F− is therefore probably attained by intimate contacts between all three cytoplasmic domains. F− is capable of forming strong hydrogen bonds with hydrogen bond donors because of the highest electronegativity of fluoride among all the elements. Hydrogen bonding of F−with residues at or near the phosphorylation site in the Mg2+·F−·E2 complex likely contributes at least in part to stabilization of such compactly organized domain structure. Orthovanadate, a phosphate analog, binds at the phosphorylation site in the presence of Mg2+ and absence of Ca2+(25.Inesi G. Kurzmack M. Nakamoto R. de Meis L. Bernhard S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 6040-6043Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26.Dupont Y. Bennett N. FEBS Lett. 1982; 139: 237-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 27.Highsmith S. Barker D. Scales D.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 817: 123-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) and produces a compactly organized conformation, as Mg2+/F− does (6.Danko S. Daiho T. Yamasaki K. Kamidochi M. Suzuki H. Toyoshima C. FEBS Lett. 2001; 489: 277-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the Ca2+-ATPase in the presence of Mg2+/vanadate and absence of Ca2+ was reported to be rapidly denatured by C12E8 (8.Pikula S. Mullner N. Dux L. Martonosi A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 5277-5286Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This is probably due to the equilibrium between the vanadate-bound and vanadate-free states, considering that irreversible denaturation proceeds if the population of vanadate-free state exists at all. It is clear that formation of the tightly bound complex with an extremely long life (i.e.Mg2+·F−·E2), being almost irreversible unless Ca2+ is present, is one of the essential factors for conferring resistance against detergent-induced denaturation. It was very recently shown by glutaraldehyde cross-linking experiments (28.Seekoe T. Peal S. McIntosh D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46737-46744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) that thapsigargin stabilizes the Ca2+-ATPase without bound Ca2+ against detergent-induced denaturation. Thapsigargin binds very tightly to a specific site on the transmembrane (or stalk) helices of the enzyme in E2 state (29.Sagara Y. Inesi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13503-13506Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30.Sagara Y. Wade J.B. Inesi G. J. Biol.

Biol. 2001; 308: 231-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The stabilization with thapsigargin is likely due to locking of the transmembrane helices in an immobilized state (28.Seekoe T. Peal S. McIntosh D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46737-46744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the stabilizing force for the Mg2+·F−·E2complex is in the cytoplasmic domains and fixes the enzyme in the state analogous to E2P. Thapsigargin is not required for this stabilization. Thus, the Mg2+·F−·E2 complex will likely provide clues to understanding not only the structure of cytoplasmic domains in E2P but also the structure of transmembrane helices and luminal loops in this Ca2+-released form and even possible dynamic movements of the helices and loops occurring in this form in future studies. It was also recently reported (36.Champeil P. Henao F. Lacapère J.-J. McIntosh D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5795-5803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 37.Henao F.

The enzyme in these arrays was reported and should probably be classified as an E1P-like form (36.Champeil P. Henao F. Lacapère J.-J. McIntosh D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5795-5803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 37.Henao F. Delavoie F. Lacapère J.-J. McIntosh D.B. Champeil P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24282-24285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (5) Google Scholar). In our present study, again, none of thapsigargin, decavanadate, and Ca2+ (and FITC labeling) is required for the stabilization of the enzyme with tightly bound Mg2+/F−against detergent-induced denaturation. We think that utilizing the Ca2+-ATPase with tightly bound Mg2+/F− is a very simple approach to obtain three-dimensional crystals and structural information on theE2P state. In summary, we demonstrated here that the C12E8-solubilized, delipidated, and purified Ca2+-ATPase with tightly bound Mg2+/F− is perfectly stable and resistant to detergent-induced denaturation for long term incubation in the absence of Ca2+ under defined conditions even in a very high concentration of C12E8 without exogenously added phospholipids. The property of the Mg2+·F−·E2 complex offers a great advantage for formation of three-dimensional crystals and for structural studies at an atomic level.
