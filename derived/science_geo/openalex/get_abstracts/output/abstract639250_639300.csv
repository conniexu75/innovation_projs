https://openalex.org/W2971999614,"Emerging evidence indicates a central role for the microbiome in immunity. However, causal evidence in humans is sparse. Here, we administered broad-spectrum antibiotics to healthy adults prior and subsequent to seasonal influenza vaccination. Despite a 10,000-fold reduction in gut bacterial load and long-lasting diminution in bacterial diversity, antibody responses were not significantly affected. However, in a second trial of subjects with low pre-existing antibody titers, there was significant impairment in H1N1-specific neutralization and binding IgG1 and IgA responses. In addition, in both studies antibiotics treatment resulted in (1) enhanced inflammatory signatures (including AP-1/NR4A expression), observed previously in the elderly, and increased dendritic cell activation; (2) divergent metabolic trajectories, with a 1,000-fold reduction in serum secondary bile acids, which was highly correlated with AP-1/NR4A signaling and inflammasome activation. Multi-omics integration revealed significant associations between bacterial species and metabolic phenotypes, highlighting a key role for the microbiome in modulating human immunity."

The unambiguous identification of monocyte-derived cells will permit future studies of their function under any condition. Tissue-resident macrophages (RTMs) have vital roles in tissue homeostasis, inflammation, and remodeling (Ginhoux and Jung, 2014Ginhoux F. Jung S. Monocytes and macrophages: developmental pathways and tissue homeostasis.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2014; 14: 392-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (1134) Google Scholar), but their origins and maintenance are debated. Macrophages were originally proposed to be derived from circulating monocytes (van Furth and Cohn, 1968van Furth R. Cohn Z.A. The origin and kinetics of mononuclear phagocytes.J. Exp. Med. 1968; 128: 415-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (970) Google Scholar), but recent studies have challenged this model, causing an important conceptual frameshift in the field (Ginhoux et al., 2010Ginhoux F.

Guilliams M. Tissue-Resident Macrophage Ontogeny and Homeostasis.Immunity. 2016; 44: 439-449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (925) Google Scholar). Namely, these studies revealed that adult RTMs arise from successive waves of embryonic and adult hematopoiesis (reviewed in Hoeffel and Ginhoux, 2015Hoeffel G. Ginhoux F. Ontogeny of Tissue-Resident Macrophages.Front. Immunol. 2015; 6: 486Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar), and the extent of contribution and the kinetics of these waves to each RTM population is tissue specific (Ginhoux and Guilliams, 2016Ginhoux F. Guilliams M. Tissue-Resident Macrophage Ontogeny and Homeostasis.Immunity. 2016; 44: 439-449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (925) Google Scholar). The exact contribution of adult definitive hematopoiesis to RTMs is an area of intense investigation. Using parabiosis and genetic fate-mapping approaches, Hashimoto et al. showed that some RTMs (such as lung alveolar macrophages [AMs], red pulp macrophages, and peritoneal macrophages) self-maintain locally throughout adult life with minimal contribution from circulating monocytes (Hashimoto et al., 2013Hashimoto D. Chow A. Noizat C. Teo P. Beasley M.B. Leboeuf M. Becker C.D. See P. Price J. Lucas D. et al.Tissue-resident macrophages self-maintain locally throughout adult life with minimal contribution from circulating monocytes.Immunity. 2013; 38: 792-804Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1432) Google Scholar). Others have shown that barrier tissues, such as the gut and dermis, have a notable monocyte contribution (Bain et al., 2014Bain C.C. Bravo-Blas A. Scott C.L. Perdiguero E.G. Geissmann F. Henri S. Malissen B. Osborne L.C. Artis D. Mowat A.M. Constant replenishment from circulating monocytes maintains the macrophage pool in the intestine of adult mice.Nat.

Sanchez C. et al.Origins and functional specialization of macrophages and of conventional and monocyte-derived dendritic cells in mouse skin.Immunity. 2013; 39: 925-938Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). Furthermore, bone marrow (BM)-derived monocytes can differentiate into arterial macrophages immediately after birth and locally self-renew from this point (Ensan et al., 2016Ensan S. Li A. Besla R. Degousee N. Cosme J. Roufaiel M. Shikatani E.A. El-Maklizi M. Williams J.W. Robins L. et al.Self-renewing resident arterial macrophages arise from embryonic CX3CR1 precursors and circulating monocytes immediately after birth.Nat. Immunol. 2016; 17: 159-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar), suggesting that this tissue is only temporarily “open” at birth but remains “closed” during adulthood. Adult tissues can thus be classified as (1) closed, with no steady-state monocyte recruitment (brain, epidermis, lung, and liver) and self-maintained throughout life, without or with only minimal contribution of blood monocytes; (2) open, with fast steady-state recruitment (gut and dermis); or (3) open, with slow steady-state recruitment (heart and pancreas) (Ginhoux and Guilliams, 2016Ginhoux F. Guilliams M. Tissue-Resident Macrophage Ontogeny and Homeostasis.Immunity. 2016; 44: 439-449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (925) Google Scholar). The mechanisms behind these differential renewal patterns are not fully understood and may be controlled by the tissue-specific microenvironment, sex, and/or other factors. Bain et al. showed that peritoneal macrophage renewal follows a sexually dimorphic pattern, with more monocytes contributing to peritoneal macrophages in males than in females (Bain et al., 2016Bain C.C. Hawley C.A. Garner H. Scott C.L. Schridde A. Steers N.J. Mack M. Joshi A. Guilliams M. Mowat A.M. et al.Long-lived self-renewing bone marrow-derived macrophages displace embryo-derived cells to inhabit adult serous cavities.Nature Commun. 2016; 7 (ncomms11852)Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). The situation during inflammation is even more complicated, as partial RTM depletion occurs alongside inflammatory cell recruitment, including neutrophils and monocytes (Guilliams and Scott, 2017Guilliams M. Scott C.L. Does niche competition determine the origin of tissue-resident macrophages?.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2017; 17: 451-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). These monocytes may potentially contribute to RTMs upon resolution of inflammation (Guilliams and Scott, 2017Guilliams M. Scott C.L. Does niche competition determine the origin of tissue-resident macrophages?.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2017; 17: 451-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). During Listeria monocytogenes infection, liver-resident macrophages undergo necroptosis in conjunction with rapid monocyte infiltration to give rise to monocyte-derived Kupffer cells (KCs) (Blériot et al., 2015Blériot C. Dupuis T. Jouvion G. Eberl G. Disson O. Lecuit M. Liver-resident macrophage necroptosis orchestrates type 1 microbicidal inflammation and type-2-mediated tissue repair during bacterial infection.Immunity. 2015; 42: 145-158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). In an opposite scenario, during type 2 inflammation induced by Litomosoides sigmodontis infection, it is local macrophage proliferation rather than inflammatory cell recruitment that controls macrophage expansion in C57BL/6 mice (Jenkins et al., 2011Jenkins S.J. Ruckerl D. Cook P.C. Jones L.H. Finkelman F.D. van Rooijen N. MacDonald A.S. Allen J.E. Local macrophage proliferation, rather than recruitment from the blood, is a signature of TH2 inflammation.Science. 2011; 332: 1284-1288Crossref PubMed Scopus (1011) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that the developmental stage, and tissue-specific and inflammation-specific conditions, controls the origins of RTMs under steady state and during inflammation. There is thus a need to precisely identify the origins of RTMs under any condition. Monocyte fate-mapping models, including Cx3cr1Cre or Cx3cr1CreERT2 (Yona et al., 2013Yona S. Kim K.W. Wolf Y. Mildner A. Varol D. Breker M. Strauss-Ayali D. Viukov S. Guilliams M. Misharin A. et al.Fate mapping reveals origins and dynamics of monocytes and tissue macrophages under homeostasis.Immunity. 2013; 38: 79-91Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1880) Google Scholar) and LyzMCre (Clausen et al., 1999Clausen B.E. Burkhardt C. Reith W. Renkawitz R. Förster I. Conditional gene targeting in macrophages and granulocytes using LysMcre mice.Transgenic Res. 1999; 8: 265-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (1563) Google Scholar) are not fully accurate, labeling either dendritic cells (DCs) or RTMs respectively. Here, we aimed to develop a new fate-mapping mouse model specific for monocyte progenitors that could precisely measure the contribution of monocytes to RTMs under any condition and discern monocytes from DCs. The earliest monopotent BM progenitors giving rise to monocytes are common monocyte progenitors (cMoPs) (Hettinger et al., 2013Hettinger J. Richards D.M. Hansson J. Barra M.M. Joschko A.C. Krijgsveld J. Feuerer M. Origin of monocytes and macrophages in a committed progenitor.Nat. Immunol. 2013; 14: 821-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar), although commitment to monocytes occurs earlier as shown by single-cell mRNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) (Giladi et al., 2018Giladi A. Paul F. Herzog Y. Lubling Y. Weiner A. Yofe I. Jaitin D. Cabezas-Wallscheid N. Dress R. Ginhoux F. et al.Single-cell characterization of haematopoietic progenitors and their trajectories in homeostasis and perturbed haematopoiesis.Nat.

Weiner A. et al.Transcriptional Heterogeneity and Lineage Commitment in Myeloid Progenitors.Cell. 2015; 163: 1663-1677Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar). cMoPs are proposed to arise from the hierarchical model of common myeloid progenitor (CMP) → granulocyte-monocyte progenitor (GMP) → monocyte-dendritic cell progenitor (MDP) → cMoP (Ginhoux and Jung, 2014Ginhoux F. Jung S. Monocytes and macrophages: developmental pathways and tissue homeostasis.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2014; 14: 392-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (1134) Google Scholar, Guilliams et al., 2018Guilliams M.

Molecular control of monocyte development.Cell. Immunol. 2014; 291: 16-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). We thus performed single-cell profiling of progenitor cells and subsequent bioinformatic analysis to identify candidate genes expressed solely by monocyte-committed progenitors to track their progeny. We identified the membrane-spanning 4-domains, subfamily A, member 3 (Ms4a3) as a specific gene to faithfully track GMPs and cMoPs but not MDPs and their DC progeny. We generated Ms4a3TdT reporter, Ms4a3Cre-RosaTdT fate-mapper, and Ms4a3CreERT2-RosaTdT-inducible fate-mapper models to specifically dissect monocyte-differentiation pathways as well as follow monocytes and their progenies according to different tissues, ages, and sex and to quantify their contribution to the RTM pool during homeostasis and inflammation. We first aimed to identify a suitable gene to generate a Cre-recombinase-based monocyte fate-mapping model, by profiling the genes expressed in BM cMoPs and monocytes, but not in DC progenitors, such as common dendritic cell progenitors (CDPs), circulating DC precursors (pre-DCs) (to distinguish monocytes versus DCs), or differentiated macrophages (to distinguish monocyte contribution versus intrinsic expression in macrophages). MDPs have bi-potential, giving rise to both DCs and monocytes (Auffray et al., 2009Auffray C. Fogg D.K. Narni-Mancinelli E. Senechal B. Trouillet C. Saederup N. Leemput J. Bigot K. Campisi L. Abitbol M. et al.CX3CR1+ CD115+ CD135+ common macrophage/DC precursors and the role of CX3CR1 in their response to inflammation.J. Exp. Med. 2009; 206: 595-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that within the MDP population, MDPs that are committed to the monocyte lineage co-exist with MDPs committed to the DC lineage. We thus aimed to find a gene that is uniquely expressed in MDPs that are committed to the monocyte lineage. We performed a single-cell transcriptomic analysis of monocyte and DC progenitors by scRNA-seq using the C1 Fluidigm platform (Figure S1A for workflow). We sorted BM cMoPs (Lin−CD117+CD115+CD135−Ly6C+), BM Ly6C+ monocytes (Lin−CD117-CD115+CD135−Ly6C+), and blood Ly6Chi monocytes (CD115+CD11b+Ly6Chi) from wild-type (WT) C57BL/6 mice by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) (Figures S1B and S1C for gating strategy) and generated transcriptional profiles for each individual cell (n = 38 for blood Ly6Chi monocytes, n = 66 for BM cMoPs, n = 57 for BM Ly6C+ monocytes). We referred to our previously published dataset for MDPs (Lin−CD11c−MHCII−CD135+CD115+CD117hi), CDPs (Lin−CD11c−MHCII−CD135+CD115+CD117int), and pre-DCs (Lin−CD11c+MHCII−CD135+CD172a−) (Schlitzer et al., 2015Schlitzer A.

Immunol. 2015; 16: 718-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). To identify putative monocyte-primed versus DC lineage-primed cells within these precursors, we compared the transcriptomic signatures of each single cell to DC versus monocyte- and/or macrophage-specific signatures (Schlitzer et al., 2015Schlitzer A. Sivakamasundari V. Chen J. Sumatoh H.R. Schreuder J. Lum J. Malleret B. Zhang S. Larbi A.

As expected, progenitor populations downstream of the MDP stage mostly exhibited either monocyte (cMoPs and monocytes) or DC (CDPs and pre-DCs) commitment. We identified the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) (see STAR Methods for bioinformatics analysis details) between monocyte-primed progenitors (red rectangle in Figure 1A) versus DC-primed progenitors (blue rectangle in Figure 1A), and selected the top 50 upregulated genes in monocyte-primed progenitors compared to DC-primed progenitors (Figure 1B). After screening the expression profiles of these 50 genes in our scRNA-seq data and the ImmGen (Heng et al., 2008Heng T.S. Painter M.W. Immunological Genome Project ConsortiumThe Immunological Genome Project: networks of gene expression in immune cells.Nat. Immunol. 2008; 9: 1091-1094Crossref PubMed Scopus (1108) Google Scholar) and bioGPS databases (Wu et al., 2009Wu C. Orozco C. Boyer J. Leglise M. Goodale J. Batalov S. Hodge C.L. Haase J. Janes J. Huss 3rd, J.W. Su A.I. BioGPS: an extensible and customizable portal for querying and organizing gene annotation resources.Genome Biol. 2009; 10: R130Crossref PubMed Scopus (1093) Google Scholar), we identified Ms4a3 as a potential candidate gene because of its high and specific expression profile in BM monocyte progenitors (Figures 1B, 1C, and S1D). Ms4a3 is a member of the membrane-spanning 4A gene family and is closely related to CD20 and the beta-subunit of the high-affinity immunoglobulin E (IgE) receptor (FcεRIβ) (Hulett et al., 2001Hulett M.D. Pagler E. Hornby J.R. Cloning and characterization of a mouse homologue of the human haematopoietic cell-specific four-transmembrane gene HTm4.Immunol. Cell Biol. 2001; 79: 345-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Using the ImmGen database, we found that Ms4a3 is highly expressed in BM GMPs, lowly expressed in MDPs (Figure S1E), and not expressed in DCs or various RTMs (Figure S1F). Exploring the bioGPS database, we found Ms4a3 to be only expressed in the BM, predominantly by GMPs (Figure S1G). With our single-cell sequencing data, we visualized Ms4a3 expression overlaid on the t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (tSNE) plot (Figure 1D). In this analysis, Ms4a3 was highly expressed in cMoPs but not in CDPs, suggesting its potential utility to distinguish monocytes from DCs in a fate-mapping approach (Figures 1C and 1D). We also compared the expression of Ms4a3 with Cx3cr1 and Lyz2, genes used to previously make monocyte fate-mapping models. In contrast to Ms4a3, which was only expressed in cMoPs but not in terminally differentiated blood Ly6Chi monocytes, Lyz2 was expressed at a higher level in terminally differentiated Ly6Chi monocytes than in cMoPs and was also expressed by pre-DCs, while Cx3cr1 was expressed by both monocyte-primed cells and DC-primed cells (Figures 1C and 1D). We also verified at the single-cell level that Ms4a3 was expressed by GMPs (single-cell dataset published in Dress et al., 2019Dress R.J. Dutertre C.A. Giladi A. Schlitzer A. Low I. Shadan N.B. Tay A. Lum J. Kairi M.F.B.M. Hwang Y.Y. et al.Plasmacytoid dendritic cells develop from Ly6D+ lymphoid progenitors distinct from the myeloid lineage.Nat. Immunol. 2019; 20: 852-864Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) (Figure 1E). To confirm these data, we sorted BM CMPs, GMPs, granulocyte progenitors (GPs), cMoPs, MDPs, CDPs, and Ly6C+ monocytes (Figure S2A for gating strategy) and profiled Ms4a3 expression by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Consistent to the scRNA-seq data and the expression data from the ImmGen and bioGPS databases, we detected high Ms4a3 expression in BM GMPs and cMoPs (Figure 1F). In summary, our single-cell sequencing data, qRT-PCR data, and expression data from public databases suggest that Ms4a3 is highly and specifically expressed in GMPs, GPs, and cMoPs and might be more suitable to specifically fate map monocytes than Cx3cr1 and Lyz2. Here, we hypothesized that Ms4a3 is a suitable target gene for building a monocyte fate mapper that could precisely measure the contribution of monocytes to RTMs on the condition that it is not expressed in mature RTMs or DCs. We first verified that Ms4a3 was not expressed by RTMs or DCs in the ImmGen and bioGPS databases (Figures S1F and S1G). To confirm these data, we sorted cell populations of interest from various tissues and profiled Ms4a3 expression by qRT-PCR (Figures S2B–S2D for gating strategy). Ms4a3 was expressed in basophils and neutrophils in the blood but not expressed in lymphocytes (T cells, B cells, and natural killer [NK] cells), mature monocytes, eosinophils, or splenic DCs (conventional dendritic cell 1 [cDC1], cDC2, and plasmacytoid DCs [pDCs]) (Figure 1G). We next measured Ms4a3 expression in several RTM populations and detected no notable expression in peritoneal macrophages, lung AMs, liver KCs, gut macrophages, microglia, or Langerhans cells (LCs) (Figures 1H and S2E–S2J for gating strategy). Ms4a3 is a membrane-associated protein located in the peri-nuclear area but not at the cell surface (Donato et al., 2002Donato J.L. Ko J. Kutok J.L. Cheng T. Shirakawa T. Mao X.Q. Beach D.

Invest. 2002; 109: 51-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), and no antibodies for mouse Ms4a3 are commercially available, limiting expression detection by flow cytometry. To monitor the expression of Ms4a3 at the single-cell level, we developed a Ms4a3 reporter mouse by inserting an Ires-tdTomato sequence downstream of the Ms4a3 stop codon (denoted as Ms4a3TdT mice hereafter) (Figure S3A). In this model, we expected tdTomato to be expressed as a faithful reporter in Ms4a3-expressing cells. Indeed, in the BM of Ms4a3TdT mice, the earliest tdTomato signal appeared in GMPs and was detectable in cMoPs and monocytes (albeit to a lesser extent) (Figure 2A), which is in agreement with our qRT-PCR profiling (Figure 1F). Furthermore, we confirmed high tdTomato protein expression levels in peripheral blood basophils and neutrophils and a low level in monocytes, likely reflecting the residual expression of the tdTomato protein initiated in the BM and no expression in lymphoid lineages (Figures 2B and 2C), splenic cDC1, cDC2, or pDCs (Figure 2D). Profiling of tdTomato mRNA by qRT-PCR led to a similar profile with high mRNA levels in BM GMPs and cMoPs but very low levels in blood monocytes (Figure 2E). We compared these results to the commonly used monocyte reporter model Cx3cr1gfp mice (Jung et al., 2000Jung S. Aliberti J. Graemmel P. Sunshine M.J. Kreutzberg G.W. Sher A. Littman D.R. Analysis of fractalkine receptor CX(3)CR1 function by targeted deletion and green fluorescent protein reporter gene insertion.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4106-4114Crossref PubMed Scopus (1857) Google Scholar). BM cMoPs and monocytes expressed the GFP reporter, but also MDPs and CDPs (Figure S3B), consistent with a previous report (Yona et al., 2013Yona S. Kim K.W. Wolf Y. Mildner A. Varol D. Breker M.

Misharin A. et al.Fate mapping reveals origins and dynamics of monocytes and tissue macrophages under homeostasis.Immunity. 2013; 38: 79-91Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1880) Google Scholar). In the blood, monocytes expressed a high level of Cx3cr1-GFP, besides basophils and some NK cells (Figures S3C and S3D). In the spleen, some DCs were positive for Cx3cr1-GFP (Figure S3E) while negative for Ms4a3-tdTomato in the Ms4a3TdT model (Figure 2D). In a Ms4a3TdT;Cx3cr1gfp model, the overlap between tdTomato and GFP could only be detected in monocytes and some basophils in the peripheral blood (Figure 2F). From Ly6Chi to Ly6Clo monocytes, the expression of GFP increased while the tdTomato expression decreased (Figure 2G). These populations can be clearly identified based on the differential expression of Cx3cr1-GFP and Ms4a3-tdTomato (Figure S3F). These data support the concept that Ms4a3-based fate-mapping models would help to distinguish monocytes from the cells of the DC lineage.Figure 2tdTomato Expression in Ms4a3TdT MiceShow full caption(A) tdTomato expression in indicated progenitor cell types in the BM of Ms4a3TdT (filled gray) and WT (open) mice.(B) tdTomato expression in indicated cell types in the peripheral blood of Ms4a3TdT mice (filled gray) and WT (open) mice.(C) tSNE plot shows the intensity of tdTomato in pe"
https://openalex.org/W2971899185,"Summary Neuronal cell types are the nodes of neural circuits that determine the flow of information within the brain. Neuronal morphology, especially the shape of the axonal arbor, provides an essential descriptor of cell type and reveals how individual neurons route their output across the brain. Despite the importance of morphology, few projection neurons in the mouse brain have been reconstructed in their entirety. Here we present a robust and efficient platform for imaging and reconstructing complete neuronal morphologies, including axonal arbors that span substantial portions of the brain. We used this platform to reconstruct more than 1,000 projection neurons in the motor cortex, thalamus, subiculum, and hypothalamus. Together, the reconstructed neurons constitute more than 85 meters of axonal length and are available in a searchable online database. Axonal shapes revealed previously unknown subtypes of projection neurons and suggest organizational principles of long-range connectivity."

Altogether, our proteomic analyses revealed association between the melanoma metabolic state and the response to immunotherapy, which can be the basis for future improvement of therapeutic response. Immunotherapy has revolutionized the treatment of metastatic melanoma patients, achieving dramatic improvement of patient survival. So far, this success has largely been attributed to the high mutational load of melanoma. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are currently considered the mainstay of melanoma immunotherapy, particularly antibodies targeting either the cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4) or the programmed death 1 (PD1) immune checkpoints, yet approximately 50% of the patients do not respond to treatment (Hodi et al., 2010Hodi F.S.

Adoptive cell transfer (ACT) of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) is a different immunotherapeutic strategy that shows high efficacy in melanoma treatment (Dudley et al., 2005Dudley M.E.

In the pre-anti-PD1 era, our team and others have shown that TIL-based therapy overcomes the limited immune activity and elicits around 50% response rates (Besser et al., 2010Besser M.J.

Predictors of tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte efficacy in melanoma.Immunotherapy. 2016; 8: 35-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Prognostic biomarkers for melanoma rely mostly on baseline clinical and pathological features, such as ratios between intra-tumoral immune cell sub-populations or plasma lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels (Weide et al., 2016Weide B. Martens A. Hassel J.C. Berking C. Postow M.A. Bisschop K. Simeone E. Mangana J. Schilling B.

Beyond prognostic markers, much effort has been invested into the identification of predictive response markers and unraveling resistance mechanisms, predominantly using histological and genomic approaches (Pitt et al., 2016Pitt J.M. Vétizou M. Daillère R. Roberti M.P. Yamazaki T. Routy B. Lepage P. Boneca I.G. Chamaillard M. Kroemer G. Zitvogel L.

Parameters such as expression of checkpoint proteins, mutational load, neoepitope load, T cell receptor clonality, and immune gene signatures correlate with response rate, but largely overlap between responders and non-responders, and are therefore of low predictive value (Gibney et al., 2016Gibney G.T.

More recently, Cascone and colleagues found that elevated glycolysis increases resistance to TIL-based therapy (Cascone et al., 2018Cascone T. McKenzie J.A. Mbofung R.M. Punt S. Wang Z. Xu C.

The field of single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) has lately profiled tumor sub-populations, showing that melanoma cells display heterogeneity in their transcriptional programs (Tirosh et al., 2016Tirosh I. Izar B. Prakadan S.M. Wadsworth 2nd, M.H. Treacy D. Trombetta J.J. Rotem A. Rodman C. Lian C. Murphy G. et al.Dissecting the multicellular ecosystem of metastatic melanoma by single-cell RNA-seq.Science. 2016; 352: 189-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (2033) Google Scholar), whereas non-responder cells express a resistance program controlled by CDK4 and CDK6 (Jerby-Arnon et al., 2018Jerby-Arnon L. Shah P. Cuoco M.S. Rodman C. Su M.J. Melms J.C. Leeson R. Kanodia A. Mei S. Lin J.R. et al.A cancer cell program promotes T cell exclusion and resistance to checkpoint blockade.Cell. 2018; 175: 984-997Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar). Others have studied CD8+ T cell sub-populations and their association with response, showing that T cells expressing transcription factor 7 (TCF-7) are correlated with response (Sade-Feldman et al., 2017Sade-Feldman M. Jiao Y.J. Chen J.H. Rooney M.S. Barzily-Rokni M. Eliane J.P. Bjorgaard S.L. Hammond M.R. Vitzthum H. Blackmon S.M. et al.Resistance to checkpoint blockade therapy through inactivation of antigen presentation.Nat.

In contrast to the extensive transcriptomics research, deep proteomic analysis of melanoma has not yet been performed. We and others have shown that there are major differences between these two regulatory layers (Vogel et al., 2010Vogel C. Abreu Rde.S. Ko D. Le S.Y. Shapiro B.A. Burns S.C. Sandhu D. Boutz D.R.

Mani D.R. Ruggles K.V. Gillette M.A. Clauser K.R. Wang P. Wang X. Qiao J.W. Cao S.

Clinical Proteomics of breast cancer reveals a novel layer of breast cancer classification.Cancer Res. 2018; 78: 6001-6010Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In addition, the proteomic layer reflects much more accurately the cellular function. We therefore chose to examine melanoma immunotherapy response by using high-resolution liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS)-based proteomics, aiming to identify signatures and cellular mechanisms of immunotherapy response. To that end, we assembled two cohorts of patients treated with TIL or anti-PD1. Analysis of a total of 116 patients revealed major functional differences between responders and non-responders to both treatments, specifically involving oxidative and lipid metabolism along with antigen presentation. In vitro and in vivo functional analyses revealed that lipid and ketone body metabolism proteins in the cancer cells are major mediators of antigen presentation and tumor immunogenicity. Aiming to identify protein networks associated with response to immunotherapy, we assembled a cohort of 116 stage IV melanoma samples, including 42 patients treated with TIL and 74 patients treated with anti-PD1, and performed untargeted MS-based proteomic analysis. We divided each cohort into two main groups of responders (including partial and complete responders; n = 61) and non-responders (progressive disease; n = 48). The PD1 cohort included additional patients with stable disease (n = 7) (Figure 1A; Table S1A). Examination of the patients’ clinical parameters showed that responders and non-responders present highly significant differences in overall survival (Figure 1B). Both the age and BRAF mutation status showed no significant difference between the groups. Additionally, prior treatments with targeted therapy (n = 16) or anti-CTLA-4 (n = 29) showed no association with response. In agreement with previous reports (Conforti et al., 2018Conforti F. Pala L. Bagnardi V. De Pas T. Martinetti M. Viale G. Gelber R.D. Goldhirsch A. Cancer immunotherapy efficacy and patients’ sex: a systematic review and meta-analysis.Lancet Oncol. 2018; 19: 737-746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar), in the TIL cohort we found significant association with gender (Figures S1A–S1C), and lower plasma LDH levels were found in the responders than in non-responders of both cohorts (p value < 0.005; Chi square test) (Figures S1A–S1C), as previously reported (Weide et al., 2016Weide B. Martens A. Hassel J.C. Berking C. Postow M.A. Bisschop K. Simeone E. Mangana J. Schilling B. Di Giacomo A.M. et al.Baseline biomarkers for outcome of melanoma patients treated with pembrolizumab.Clin. Cancer Res. 2016; 22: 5487-5496Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). In accordance with (Besser et al., 2013Besser M.J. Shapira-Frommer R. Itzhaki O. Treves A.J. Zippel D.B. Levy D. Kubi A. Shoshani N. Zikich D. Ohayon Y. et al.Adoptive transfer of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes in patients with metastatic melanoma: intent-to-treat analysis and efficacy after failure to prior immunotherapies.Clin. Cancer Res. 2013; 19: 4792-4800Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar), in the TIL cohort the number of infused CD8 cells was found to be the most significant predictor (p value = 3.19E−04; Student’s t test); however, this parameter is available only after TILs have been extracted and propagated ex vivo, which limits its use.Figure S1Association between Clinical Parameters and Response to Treatments, Related to Figure 1.Show full captionThe following clinical parameters were examined for the TIL (A), anti-PD1 (B) or combined TIL and anti-PD1 (C) datasets: Gender; lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels in the blood; BRAF mutational status; age and number of CD8 T cells in the infusion bag (for the TIL patients). ∗p < 0.05; ∗∗p < 0.1.(D) Histogram shows overall narrow distribution of ratios toward the super-SILAC standard.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The following clinical parameters were examined for the TIL (A), anti-PD1 (B) or combined TIL and anti-PD1 (C) datasets: Gender; lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels in the blood; BRAF mutational status; age and number of CD8 T cells in the infusion bag (for the TIL patients). ∗p < 0.05; ∗∗p < 0.1. (D) Histogram shows overall narrow distribution of ratios toward the super-SILAC standard. For proteomic analysis, we dissected melanoma regions with > 80% tumor cells and followed with stable isotope labeling with amino acids in cell culture (SILAC)-based high-resolution LC-MS/MS analysis. To obtain accurate proteome quantification, we designed a super-SILAC mix, which was composed of five SILAC-labeled melanoma cell lines that served as a reference for normalization (Geiger et al., 2010Geiger T. Cox J. Ostasiewicz P. Wisniewski J.R. Mann M. Super-SILAC mix for quantitative proteomics of human tumor tissue.Nat. Methods. 2010; 7: 383-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). Examination of the ratios of the super-SILAC standard toward the tumor proteins showed high concordance, reflecting its suitability as an internal standard (Figure S1D). The mix was then spiked into each of the melanoma samples at a 1:1 protein ratio to serve as the reference for quantification. The combined protein lysates were trypsin-digested and fractionated, followed by high-resolution LC-MS/MS analysis on the Q-Exactive Plus or HF mass spectrometers (Figure 1C). Overall, 10,376 non-redundant protein groups were quantified (with 1% false discovery rate [FDR] on the peptide and protein levels) (Table S1B); there were no major differences in the coverage between the responders and non-responders (Figures 1D–1E). All downstream statistical analyses were performed upon further data filtration to retain only proteins identified in at least 70% of the samples. These lists, of 4,400–4,600 proteins (Tables S1C and S1D), included more than 800 signal-transduction-related proteins and dozens of receptors and transcription-factor-associated proteins, indicating sufficient coverage for analysis of intracellular processes (Table S1E). Initial bioinformatic analysis examined the functional differences between responders and non-responders in each therapy. We first applied a low stringency Student’s t tests with a nominal p value cutoff (p value < 0.05) and found 414 and 636 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) in the TIL and the anti-PD1 cohorts, respectively (Tables S2A and S2B). We then constructed proteomaps to cluster the DEPs according to their Kyoto Encyclopedia Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway annotations and found a striking resemblance between the maps of the two treatments (Figures 2A and S2A). In both, the responder group was dominated by higher levels of metabolic proteins, whereas non-responders were dominated by spliceosome and RNA-metabolism-related proteins. Along with the metabolic categories, responders from both datasets had higher proportions of antigen-presentation-related proteins, as well as signaling-related categories (mitogen-activated protein kinase [MAPK], nuclear factor-κB [NF-κB], and RAS signaling pathways), all of which play important roles in melanoma and in the response to immunotherapy (Manguso et al., 2017Manguso R.T.

In agreement with the high pathway resemblance between the two therapies, a two-dimensional (2D) annotation enrichment test distribution displayed a high overall correlation between the enriched categories in both treatments (R = 0.76; p value = 1.5E−86). In both treatments, responders were significantly enriched for mitochondrial metabolic pathways, including the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, fatty acid oxidation, and ketone body metabolism (2D annotation enrichment analysis, FDR q value < 0.02) (Figure 2B; Table S2C). These processes concurred with enrichment of antigen presentation and type I and type II interferon (IFN) signaling categories. The non-responder group was significantly associated with cell cycle, in accordance with Lauss et al., 2017Lauss M. Donia M. Harbst K. Andersen R. Mitra S. Rosengren F. Salim M.

All of the categories highlighted in the plot are significantly enriched or de-enriched in each dataset. The score indicates enrichment in responders (positive) or non-responders (negative). The proteomic scores of the same category slightly differ as a function of the RNA dataset that it is compared to. Given the functional similarity of the response profiles to both treatments, we searched for common functional determinants associated with the patient clinical parameters. We integrated the two cohorts to create a single dataset of all 116 samples and performed weighted gene correlation network analysis (WGCNA). Separation of the proteomic profiles to eigengene modules identified a group of modules that were positively associated with patient progression-free survival, complete or partial response, and normal plasma LDH level. In agreement with the previous results, these modules showed enrichment of antigen presentation and IFNG signaling along with mitochondrial metabolic pathways (Fisher exact test, FDR q-value < 0.05) (Figure 2C; Table S2D). WGCNA further revealed an association between BRAF mutation and elevated levels of mitochondrial OXPHOS proteins, but no association with response, whereas WT BRAF was associated with higher expression of RNA splicing and RNA processing and SD samples, implying that there could be another level of complexity. To examine the generality of the mitochondria-IFN association, we compared our results to published RNA-seq datasets that explored the response to anti-PD1- (Hugo et al., 2016Hugo W. Zaretsky J.M.

Enrichment analysis showed that responders in all three datasets had moderately higher levels of mitochondrial genes than did non-responders, including OXPHOS TCA cycle and ketone body metabolism, along with antigen presentation and type I and type II IFN signaling pathway genes. Fatty acid catabolism was enriched in responders of two of the three RNA datasets (2D annotation enrichment test, FDR q value < 0.05) (Figure S2B; Tables S2E–S2G). Comparison to the proteomic data shows that the metabolic enrichment was much lower at the RNA level than at the proteome level, whereas the antigen-presentation- and IFN-related categories were enriched to the same extent. Altogether, these analyses highlight that differences in mitochondrial metabolism are generally associated with immunotherapeutic response, irrespective of the treatment regimen, and are evident at the RNA level as well, though to a much lower extent than at the proteome level. Aiming to reduce the broad pathway view to specific proteins and identify minimal protein signatures of response, we applied support vector machine (SVM)-based classification with ANOVA-based feature selection embedded in a recursive cross validation procedure (see STAR Methods). For the TIL cohort, this procedure resulted in an eight-protein signature; six of those were higher and two were lower in the responders than in non-responders (Figure 3A). The signature provided excellent separation between the groups according to the first component in the principal component analysis (PCA) (Figure S3A), and the receiver operating characteristics (ROCs) curve showed high sensitivity and specificity of prediction with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.85 (Figure S3B). The same procedure applied to the anti-PD1 cohort resulted in a 15-protein signature, all higher in the responder group than in the non-responder group with an AUC of the ROC curve of 0.77 (Figures 3B, S3C, and S3D). Comparing the two signatures showed that, despite the high-functional similarity between the response profiles of both treatments, there was no overlap between them. Th"

However, while a global change in transcription is recognized as a defining feature of cancer, the contribution of alternative promoters still remains largely unexplored. Here, we infer active promoters using RNA-seq data from 18,468 cancer and normal samples, demonstrating that alternative promoters are a major contributor to context-specific regulation of transcription. We find that promoters are deregulated across tissues, cancer types, and patients, affecting known cancer genes and novel candidates. For genes with independently regulated promoters, we demonstrate that promoter activity provides a more accurate predictor of patient survival than gene expression. Our study suggests that a dynamic landscape of active promoters shapes the cancer transcriptome, opening new diagnostic avenues and opportunities to further explore the interplay of regulatory mechanisms with transcriptional aberrations in cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2971906485,"Numerous interventions are in clinical development for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection, including small molecules that target viral transcription and replication. These processes are catalyzed by a complex comprising the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (L) and the tetrameric phosphoprotein (P). RSV P recruits multiple proteins to the polymerase complex and, with the exception of its oligomerization domain, is thought to be intrinsically disordered. Despite their critical roles in RSV transcription and replication, structures of L and P have remained elusive. Here, we describe the 3.2-Å cryo-EM structure of RSV L bound to tetrameric P. The structure reveals a striking tentacular arrangement of P, with each of the four monomers adopting a distinct conformation. The structure also rationalizes inhibitor escape mutants and mutations observed in live-attenuated vaccine candidates. These results provide a framework for determining the molecular underpinnings of RSV replication and transcription and should facilitate the design of effective RSV inhibitors."

Despite extensive studies, the molecular mechanism governing specific TARP/MAGUK interaction remains elusive. Using stargazin and PSD-95 as the representatives, we discover that the entire tail of stargazin (Stg_CT) is required for binding to PSD-95. The PDZ binding motif (PBM) and an Arg-rich motif upstream of PBM conserved in TARPs bind to multiple sites on PSD-95, thus resulting in a highly specific and multivalent stargazin/PSD-95 complex. Stargazin in complex with PSD-95 or PSD-95-assembled postsynaptic complexes form highly concentrated and dynamic condensates via phase separation, reminiscent of stargazin/PSD-95-mediated AMPAR synaptic clustering and trapping. Importantly, charge neutralization mutations in TARP_CT Arg-rich motif weakened TARP's condensation with PSD-95 and impaired TARP-mediated AMPAR synaptic transmission in mice hippocampal neurons. The TARP_CT/PSD-95 interaction mode may have implications for understanding clustering of other synaptic transmembrane proteins."

In conclusion, the SC pool undergoes dynamic transitions during early activation with changes in mechano-properties and cytoskeleton signaling preceding cell-cycle entry. Muscle stem cells or satellite cells (SCs) are essential for the regenerative capacity of skeletal muscle. SCs reside in a quiescent and immotile state wedged between the basal lamina and the sarcolemma of the muscle fiber (the niche) (Bischoff, 1990Bischoff R. Interaction between satellite cells and skeletal muscle fibers.Development. 1990; 109: 943-952Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In response to injury, SCs exit this dormant state and transition toward activation, which includes metabolic activation, cell-cycle entry, and migration. Once dividing, the majority of SCs differentiate, while a subset self-renew to restore the quiescent SC pool. The quiescent state is critical to maintain stem cell capacity across different niches (Cheung and Rando, 2013Cheung T.H. Rando T.A. Molecular regulation of stem cell quiescence.Nat. Rev. Mol.

A quiescent intermediate state referred to as GAlert was characterized (Rodgers et al., 2014Rodgers J.T. King K.Y. Brett J.O. Cromie M.J. Charville G.W. Maguire K.K. Brunson C. Mastey N. Liu L.

SCs in GAlert enter the cell cycle more rapidly, mount a more efficient regeneration process, and retain stem cell capacity. The mechanisms that promote or repress the transition from quiescence to activation are not well understood. The niche is a conserved regulator of stem cell quiescence and maintenance. A fundamental but unanswered question in stem cell biology is the identity of specific cell types and paracrine-acting factors that control quiescence and the transition toward activation. The Wnt signaling pathway has been demonstrated to act as a conserved regulator of stem cell function via canonical (β-catenin) and non-canonical (planar cell polarity [PCP] and calcium) signaling (Clevers et al., 2014Clevers H. Loh K.M. Nusse R. Stem cell signaling. An integral program for tissue renewal and regeneration: Wnt signaling and stem cell control.Science. 2014; 346: 1248012Crossref PubMed Scopus (869) Google Scholar). However, there is a dearth of information addressing the requirement of specific Wnt ligands, in part due to the possible redundancy between the 19 family members. Recent studies have disrupted Wnt activity using Porcupine (Porcn) or Wntless loss of function alleles in different tissues to disrupt the processing of the Wnt ligand family (Nabhan et al., 2018Nabhan A.N.

Whether Wnt ligands, from an anatomically defined niche cell, control SC quiescence remains unknown. Identifying the niche and signaling molecules that regulate quiescence is critical to understanding regenerative biology and the development of therapeutics to harness stem cell function. Using an inducible genetic approach to specifically target the SC niche, we provide the first evidence of a paracrine-acting niche factor, Wnt4, that reinforces SC quiescence through activation of Rho-GTPase and repression of YAP (yes-associated protein). In conclusion, Wnt4 levels dictate the depth of SC quiescence during homeostasis, their activation response, and regenerative potential. To identify Wnts that regulate SC quiescence in the adult muscle, we first analyzed Wnt ligand expression by microarray analysis and qRT-PCR, on freshly isolated single muscle fibers. Although a number of different Wnts were expressed, Wnt4 was significantly enriched in uninjured muscle fibers (Figures 1A and 1B ). We next assessed Wnt4 transcript levels in whole muscle during the early stages of muscle repair (Polesskaya et al., 2003Polesskaya A. Seale P. Rudnicki M.A. Wnt signaling induces the myogenic specification of resident CD45+ adult stem cells during muscle regeneration.Cell. 2003; 113: 841-852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). We find that Wnt4 transcript levels are between 45%–65% lower at 18, 24, and 48 h after BaCl2 injury, compared to muscles of non-injured mice (Figures 1C and S1A). Receptivity of the quiescent SCs (QSCs) to Wnt ligand was indicated by the expression of most Frizzled receptors in freshly isolated fluorescence-activated cell sorted (FACS) SCs (Figure S1B). It should be noted that the isolation of SCs by FACS (3 h) or single muscle fibers (90 min) will induce some activation (Machado et al., 2017Machado L. Esteves de Lima J. Fabre O. Proux C.

For the purpose of this study, we will refer to the freshly isolated SCs as QSCs. To test the requirement of niche-derived Wnt4 for SC quiescence in vivo, we conditionally deleted Wnt4 (Kobayashi et al., 2011Kobayashi A. Stewart C.A. Wang Y. Fujioka K. Thomas N.C. Jamin S.P. Behringer R.R. β-Catenin is essential for Müllerian duct regression during male sexual differentiation.Development. 2011; 138: 1967-1975Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) in adult muscle fibers, using tamoxifen (tmx)-inducible Cre-recombinase under the control of Human Skeletal Actin (McCarthy et al., 2012McCarthy J.J. Srikuea R. Kirby T.J. Peterson C.A. Esser K.A. Inducible Cre transgenic mouse strain for skeletal muscle-specific gene targeting.Skelet. Muscle. 2012; 2: 8Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) (Tg: HSACreMER/+; Wnt4fl/fl herein called as Myofiber [MF]-Wnt4fl/fl). This transgenic line provided stringent and efficient recombination in adult muscle fibers (Figures S1C and S1D). Adult mice (3–4 months old) were given tmx for 5 days followed by a 6-day or 14-day chase (Figure 1D). Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) was given in the drinking water during the chase to label cycling SCs. We observed an increase in the number of SCs (Figures 1E and 1F), the fraction that incorporated BrdU (Figure 1G), and expressed MyoD in a Wnt4-depleted niche compared to controls (Figures 1H and 1J). To confirm that niche-derived Wnt4 regulated SC quiescence, we stained muscle sections with DDX6, a marker of mRNP granules, that is lost when SCs break quiescence (Crist et al., 2012Crist C.G. Montarras D. Buckingham M.

Niche Cadherins Control the Quiescence-to-Activation Transition in Muscle Stem Cells.Cell Rep. 2017; 21: 2236-2250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). We found that DDX6 levels decreased in SCs from a Wnt4-depleted niche compared to controls (Figures 1I and 1K). Loss of SC quiescence is often associated with precocious differentiation and fusion into existing muscle fibers (Bjornson et al., 2012Bjornson C.R.R. Cheung T.H. Liu L. Tripathi P.V. Steeper K.M. Rando T.A. Notch signaling is necessary to maintain quiescence in adult muscle stem cells.Stem Cells. 2012; 30: 232-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar, Mourikis et al., 2012Mourikis P.

A critical requirement for notch signaling in maintenance of the quiescent skeletal muscle stem cell state.Stem Cells. 2012; 30: 243-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). In spite of the ∼2-fold expansion of the SC pool, we found no evidence of central-located nuclei in the myofibers or BrdU+/Pax7– nuclei underneath the basal lamina. Porcupine (Porcn) is essential for Wnt ligand processing and secretion (Kadowaki et al., 1996Kadowaki T. Wilder E. Klingensmith J. Zachary K. Perrimon N. The segment polarity gene porcupine encodes a putative multitransmembrane protein involved in Wingless processing.Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 3116-3128Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, Proffitt and Virshup, 2012Proffitt K.D. Virshup D.M. Precise regulation of porcupine activity is required for physiological Wnt signaling.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 34167-34178Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Therefore, we used a conditional gene deletion approach (Roman et al., 2014Roman A.K. Jayewickreme C.D. Murtaugh L.C. Shivdasani R.A. Wnt secretion from epithelial cells and subepithelial myofibroblasts is not required in the mouse intestinal stem cell niche in vivo.Stem Cell Reports. 2014; 2: 127-134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) to disrupt Porcn function and hence Wnt paracrine action, in adult muscle fibers (Figure S1E). We find a similar increase in the number of SCs in a Porcn-depleted niche relative to controls, as observed for Wnt4 depletion (Figure S1F). In vitro, SCs activated more rapidly in a Porcn-depleted niche, which was abrogated by treatment with recombinant Wnt4 (Figure S1G), suggesting that Wnt4 plays a dominant role in maintaining SC quiescence. Together, these results demonstrate that Wnt activity from muscle fibers is required for SC quiescence through paracrine action. Wnt4 is known to play a role in vertebrate neuromuscular junction (NMJ) formation (Strochlic et al., 2012Strochlic L. Falk J. Goillot E. Sigoillot S. Bourgeois F. Delers P. Rouvière J. Swain A. Castellani V. Schaeffer L. Legay C. Wnt4 participates in the formation of vertebrate neuromuscular junction.PLoS ONE. 2012; 7: e29976Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Loss of NMJ activity results in muscle fiber atrophy and a well-defined “denervation” transcriptional response (Hyatt et al., 2003Hyatt J.P. Roy R.R. Baldwin K.M. Edgerton V.R. Nerve activity-independent regulation of skeletal muscle atrophy: role of MyoD and myogenin in satellite cells and myonuclei.Am. J. Physiol.

Fast to slow transformation of denervated and electrically stimulated rat muscle.J. Physiol. 1998; 510: 623-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). We find no differences in muscle fiber size in muscle sections (Figure S1H), denervation transcript response (Figures S1I–S1K) or myosin expression (Figure S1L) from single muscle fibers at homeostasis. These data suggest that Wnt4 depletion does not induce atrophy or denervation in adult muscle fibers, suggesting Wnt4 plays a different role on the NMJ between development and adult homeostasis. In conclusion, Wnt4 from the niche is critical for maintaining SC quiescence during tissue homeostasis. In response to an injury stimulus, QSCs enter the cell cycle. We asked whether depletion of Wnt4 from the niche influenced cell-cycle entry. Upon mitogen stimulation in vitro, compared to controls, the majority of SCs on single muscle fibers from a Wnt4-depleted niche and Porcn-depleted niche rapidly activated (MyoD+) and entered the cell cycle as measured by 5-ethynyl-2′-deoxyuridine (EdU; Figures 2B and S2A–S2C). We next tested the effect of niche-derived Wnt4 on the ability of SCs to regenerate muscle. In the tmx-inducible HSACreMER/+.Wnt4fl/fl genetic model, adult fibers are depleted of Wnt4, but the SCs are wild type. In response to injury, wild-type SCs formed wild-type muscle (Figures S2D and S2E). Therefore, any regenerative phenotype observed after Wnt4 deletion is directly due to the altered niche signal prior to injury. We found that the size of regenerating muscle fibers (6 days after injury) was significantly increased and the percentage of eMHC+ fibers decreased after Wnt4 depletion in the niche compared to control mice (Figures 2C–2E). The number of proliferating Pax7+ SCs increased after 6 days of regeneration in Myofiber-Wnt4fl/fl compared to controls (Figures S2F and S2G). No difference in fiber size was observed between the control and Wnt4-depleted niche 35 days after injury (Figure S2H). However, compared to controls, the number of SCs remains elevated in Myofiber-Wnt4fl/fl (Figure S2I). Therefore, the SC pool and fiber size was restored to pre-injury levels. To determine whether increasing Wnt4 in the niche reinforces quiescence, we used an inducible transgenic gain-of-function approach to overexpress Wnt4 (Lee and Behringer, 2007Lee H.H. Behringer R.R. Conditional expression of Wnt4 during chondrogenesis leads to dwarfism in mice.PLoS ONE. 2007; 2: e450Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) in adult muscle fibers (Tg: HSACreMER/+; Wnt4OX/+ herein called as Myofiber [MF]-Wnt4OX/+) (Figures 2F and S2J). In cross-sections of uninjured muscle, DDX6 expression was increased in Myofiber-Wnt4OX/+ compared with controls (Figures 2G and 2H). Upon mitogen stimulation in vitro, compared to controls, the majority of SCs from a Wnt4-overexpressed niche remained in a quiescent (MyoD–) state (Figure 2I). In response to injury, muscle fiber size was smaller and the percentage of eMHC fibers greater in Myofiber-Wnt4OX, compared to controls (Figures 2J–2L). These data suggest that Wnt4 from the niche is sufficient to reinforce SC quiescence and delay muscle regeneration. Therefore, the levels of a single Wnt ligand (Wnt4) from a single type of niche cell (the muscle fiber) regulates the depth of SC quiescence and muscle regenerative potential. Wnt ligands signal in a paracrine manner through canonical or non-canonical pathways (Komiya and Habas, 2008Komiya Y. Habas R. Wnt signal transduction pathways.Organogenesis. 2008; 4: 68-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (928) Google Scholar). To identify the signaling mechanism transducing Wnt4 signals in the “receiving” cell, we analyzed canonical markers, active β-catenin, on SCs residing on single muscle fibers and Axin2, in sorted QSCs. The deletion of Wnt4 and Porcn in the niche did not change canonical Wnt signaling in QSCs (Figures 3A–3C and S3A). Therefore, Wnt4 does not signal through canonical Wnt signaling. Moreover, SCs in a Wnt4-depleted niche are not transitioning to a myogenic progenitor state, as defined by the accumulation of β-catenin (Figeac and Zammit, 2015Figeac N. Zammit P.S.

In addition, analysis of muscle fibers for autocrine canonical β-catenin signaling revealed no change in active β-catenin levels in Myofiber-Wnt4fl/fl muscle fibers when compared to control (Figures S3B and S3C). Therefore, Wnt4 signals via non-canonical Wnt signaling cascade in QSCs. Rho GTPase is a well-characterized downstream component of non-canonical Wnt signaling pathway, first identified during gastrulation, to promote polarized cell shape changes and migration (Habas et al., 2003Habas R.

Hall A. Tolwinski N. Wnt signaling pathways meet Rho GTPases.Genes Dev. 2009; 23: 265-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). The Rho family of GTPases play a key role in cytoskeletal remodeling (Sit and Manser, 2011Sit S.T. Manser E. Rho GTPases and their role in organizing the actin cytoskeleton.J. Cell Sci. 2011; 124: 679-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar) and has been implicated in hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) self-renewal (Schreck et al., 2017Schreck C. Istvánffy R. Ziegenhain C. Sippenauer T. Ruf F. Henkel L. Gärtner F. Vieth B. Florian M.C. Mende N. et al.Niche WNT5A regulates the actin cytoskeleton during regeneration of hematopoietic stem cells.J. Exp. Med. 2017; 214: 165-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). We found that active Rho was reduced in sorted QSCs from a Wnt4-depleted niche compared to controls (Figures 3D and 3E). We next treated sorted SCs from Myofiber-Porcnfl/fl or controls with vehicle or Wnt4 recombinant protein for 4 h and assayed for active Rho. We found that, compared to control, the levels of active Rho, were decreased in vehicle-treated SCs from a Porcn-depleted niche and were rescued by Wnt4 treatment (Figure S3E). To investigate the highly interconnected cytoskeletal network in QSCs, we analyzed phosphorylated-Myosin Light Chain (pMLC), a downstream target of Rho that regulates acto-myosin assembly, contraction, and stress fiber formation (Chrzanowska-Wodnicka and Burridge, 1996Chrzanowska-Wodnicka M. Burridge K. Rho-stimulated contractility drives the formation of stress fibers and focal adhesions.J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 1403-1415Crossref PubMed Scopus (1400) Google Scholar, Kimura et al., 1996Kimura K. Ito M. Amano M. Chihara K. Fukata Y. Nakafuku M. Yamamori B. Feng J. Nakano T. Okawa K. et al.Regulation of myosin phosphatase by Rho and Rho-associated kinase (Rho-kinase).Science. 1996; 273: 245-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (2433) Google Scholar). pMLC was expressed at lower levels in SCs on isolated single muscle fibers from a Wnt4-depleted niche than the controls (Figures 3F and 3G). Rho regulates the formation of stress fibers and focal adhesions (Ridley and Hall, 1992Ridley A.J. Hall A. The small GTP-binding protein rho regulates the assembly of focal adhesions and actin stress fibers in response to growth factors.Cell. 1992; 70: 389-399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3824) Google Scholar). Phosphorylated-Focal Adhesion Kinase (pFAK), a regulator of focal adhesions, was also decreased in SCs in a Wnt4-depleted and Porcn-depleted niche (Figures 3H, 3I, and S3D). Consistent with a paracrine effect from Wnt4 on QSCs, cytoskeletal signaling components were not differentially expressed on single muscle fibers from Myofiber-Wnt4fl/fl and controls (Figures S3F–S3I). Therefore, Wnt4 from the niche stimulates Rho activity and cytoskeletal signaling in QSCs. Cells rapidly respond to mechanical cues from the cytoskeleton by changing their cell shape, tension, and migration (Burridge and Guilluy, 2016Burridge K. Guilluy C. Focal adhesions, stress fibers and mechanical tension.Exp. Cell Res. 2016; 343: 14-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). We observed that SCs resident on isolated single muscle fibers in a Wnt4-depleted niche have a more rounded shape than the controls (Figure 4A). We used atomic force microscopy (AFM) to measure tension of sorted QSCs. We found that stiffness of QSCs was ∼50% less from a Wnt4-depleted niche compared to controls and similar to the stiffness of QSCs treated with a Rho inhibitor (Figure 4B). We observed that 33% of SCs in a Wnt4-depleted niche were located in the interstitial space, outside the basal lamina in vivo (Figures 4C and 4D). Using a tmx-inducible SC-specific approach to reduce Rho in vivo (Jackson et al., 2011Jackson B. Peyrollier K. Pedersen E. Basse A. Karlsson R. Wang Z. Lefever T. Ochsenbein A.M. Schmidt G. Aktories K. et al.RhoA is dispensable for skin development, but crucial for contraction and directed migration of keratinocytes.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2011; 22: 593-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) (Tg: Pax7CreER/+; RhoAfl/+ herein called SC-RhoAfl/+), we found 35% of SCs were located outside the niche after a reduction in Rho (Figures 4E and 4F). All these results taken together demonstrate that a signaling axis, initiated by Wnt4 and transmitted by Rho, regulates stiffness and niche-retention of QSCs. To catalog the temporal changes in cytoskeletal signaling, mechano-properties, and cell-cycle entry, we performed a detailed time course during the transition between SC quiescence and activation on single muscle fibers in vitro, using markers of morphometric adaption (cell size and shape), cytoskeletal signaling (pMLC), mechano-transduction (YAP), mTORC1 activation (pS6), and cell-cycle entry (MyoD). During the first few hours of mitogen exposure, there was an increase in circularity and decrease in size, coincident with the decline in pMLC levels. Contrasting the decline in pMLC was the upregulation of pS6, which"

The role of STAG2 in gene regulation, hematopoiesis, and tumor suppression remains unresolved. We show that Stag2 deletion in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) results in altered hematopoietic function, increased self-renewal, and impaired differentiation. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) sequencing revealed that, although Stag2 and Stag1 bind a shared set of genomic loci, a component of Stag2 binding sites is unoccupied by Stag1, even in Stag2-deficient HSPCs. Although concurrent loss of Stag2 and Stag1 abrogated hematopoiesis, Stag2 loss alone decreased chromatin accessibility and transcription of lineage-specification genes, including Ebf1 and Pax5, leading to increased self-renewal and reduced HSPC commitment to the B cell lineage. Our data illustrate a role for Stag2 in transformation and transcriptional dysregulation distinct from its shared role with Stag1 in chromosomal segregation."
https://openalex.org/W2972214124,"CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) and cohesin are key players in three-dimensional chromatin organization. The topologically associating domains (TADs) demarcated by CTCF are remarkably well conserved between species, although genome-wide CTCF binding has diverged substantially following transposon-mediated motif expansions. Therefore, the CTCF consensus motif poorly predicts TADs, and additional factors must modulate CTCF binding and subsequent TAD formation. Here, we demonstrate that the ChAHP complex (CHD4, ADNP, HP1) competes with CTCF for a common set of binding motifs. In Adnp knockout cells, novel insulated regions are formed at sites normally bound by ChAHP, whereas proximal canonical boundaries are weakened. These data reveal that CTCF-mediated loop formation is modulated by a distinct zinc-finger protein complex. Strikingly, ChAHP-bound loci are mainly situated within less diverged SINE B2 transposable elements. This implicates ChAHP in maintenance of evolutionarily conserved spatial chromatin organization by buffering novel CTCF binding sites that emerged through SINE expansions."

Method Secondary data analysis performed using cross-sectional data from the Health Questionnaire of the Demographic and Health Survey in Peru. Variables of interest were the PHQ-9 and demographic characteristics (sex, age group, level of education, socioeconomic status, marital status, and area of residence). Factor structure was evaluated by standard confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), and measurement invariance by multi-group CFA, using standard goodness-of-fit indices criteria for interpreting results from both CFAs. Analysis of the internal consistency (α and ω) was also pursued. Results Data from 30,449 study participants were analyzed, 56.7% were women, average age was 40.5 years (standard deviation (SD) = 16.3), 65.9% lived in urban areas, 74.6% were married, and had 9 years of education on average (SD = 4.6). From standard CFA, a one-dimensional model presented the best fit (CFI = 0.936; RMSEA = 0.089; SRMR = 0.039). From multi-group CFA, all progressively restricted models had ΔCFI<0.01 across almost all groups by demographic characteristics. PHQ-9 reliability was optimal (α = ω = 0.87). Conclusions The evidence presents support for the one-dimensional model and measurement invariance of the PHQ-9 measure, allowing for reliable comparisons between sex, age groups, education level, socioeconomic status, marital status, and residence area, and recommends its use within the Peruvian population."

Pooled over cultivars, effects of soil moisture stress on the parents caused a reduction in the seed germination rate, maximum seed germination, and overall seedling performance in the F1 generation. The effect of soil moisture stress on the parent environment induced seed quality that carried on the F1 generation seed gemination and seedling traits under optimum conditions and further exasperated when exposed to increasing levels of drought stress. Results indicate that seed weight and storage reserve are key factors positively associated with germination traits and seedling growth. Our data confirm that the effects of soil moisture stress on soybean are transferable, causing reduced germination, seedling vigor, and seed quality in the F1 generation. Therefore, optimal water supply during soybean seed formation period may be beneficial for seed producers in terms of optimizing seed quality and vigor characteristics of commodity seed."

These defects are mediated by one of two H2A.Z subtypes, H2A.Z.2, whose knockdown mimics and whose overexpression rescues the FHS phenotype. Selective rescue by H2A.Z.2 is conferred by one of the three amino acid differences between the H2A.Z subtypes, S38/T38. We further show that H2A.Z.1 and H2A.Z.2 genomic occupancy patterns are qualitatively similar, but quantitatively distinct, and H2A.Z.2 incorporation at AT-rich enhancers and expression of their associated genes are both sensitized to SRCAP truncations. Altogether, our results illuminate the mechanism underlying a human syndrome and uncover selective functions of H2A.Z subtypes during development."

These individuals had little if any Steppe pastoralist-derived ancestry, showing that it was not ubiquitous in northwest South Asia during the IVC as it is today. The Iranian-related ancestry in the IVC derives from a lineage leading to early Iranian farmers, herders, and hunter-gatherers before their ancestors separated, contradicting the hypothesis that the shared ancestry between early Iranians and South Asians reflects a large-scale spread of western Iranian farmers east. Instead, sampled ancient genomes from the Iranian plateau and IVC descend from different groups of hunter-gatherers who began farming without being connected by substantial movement of people."

https://openalex.org/W2971558164,"During neural tube closure and spinal cord development, many cells die in both the central and peripheral nervous systems (CNS and PNS, respectively). However, myeloid-derived professional phagocytes have not yet colonized the trunk region during early neurogenesis. How apoptotic cells are removed from this region during these stages remains largely unknown. Using live imaging in zebrafish, we demonstrate that neural crest cells (NCCs) respond rapidly to dying cells and phagocytose cellular debris around the neural tube. Additionally, NCCs have the ability to enter the CNS through motor exit point transition zones and clear debris in the spinal cord. Surprisingly, NCCs phagocytosis mechanistically resembles macrophage phagocytosis and their recruitment toward cellular debris is mediated by interleukin-1β. Taken together, our results reveal a role for NCCs in phagocytosis of debris in the developing nervous system before the presence of professional phagocytes."

Analyzing the transcriptomes and methylomes of human aESCs, pESCs, and bi-parental ESCs enabled the characterization of regulatory relations at known imprinted regions and uncovered imprinted gene candidates within and outside known imprinted regions. Investigating the consequences of uniparental differentiation, we showed the known paternal-genome preference for placental contribution, revealed a similar bias toward liver differentiation, and implicated the involvement of the imprinted gene IGF2 in this process.

https://openalex.org/W2972348518,"Enterovirus 71 (EV71) induces apoptosis to promote viral particle release. Earlier work showed that EV71 utilizes its 3C protease to induce apoptosis in a caspase-3-dependent pathway, though the mechanism is unknown. However, work from Vagner, Holcik and colleagues showed that host protein heterogeneous ribonucleoprotein A1 (hnRNP A1) binds the IRES of cellular apoptotic peptidase activating factor 1 (apaf-1) mRNA to repress its translation. In this work, we show that apaf-1 expression is essential for EV71-induced apoptosis. EV71 infection or ectopic expression of 3C protease cleaves hnRNP A1, which abolishes its binding to the apaf-1 IRES. This allows IRES-dependent synthesis of apaf-1, activation of caspase-3, and apoptosis. Thus, we reveal a novel mechanism that EV71 utilizes for virus release via a 3C protease–hnRNP A1–apaf-1–caspase-3–apoptosis axis."

This study seeks to explain the responses of monocytes/macrophages in the pathogenesis of EEHV-HD. Samples of blood, frozen tissues, and formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues from EEHV1A-HD, EEHV4-HD, co-infected EEHV1A and 4-HD, and EEHV-negative calves were analyzed. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from the persistent EEHV4-infected and EEHV-negative calves were also studied. The results showed increased infiltration of Iba-1-positive macrophages in the inflamed tissues of the internal organs of elephant calves with EEHV-HD. In addition, cellular apoptosis also increased in the tissues of elephants with EEHV-HD, especially in the PBMCs, compared to the EEHV-negative control. In the PBMCs of persistent EEHV4-infected elephants, cytokine mRNA expression was high, particularly up-regulation of TNF-α and IFN-γ. Moreover, viral particles were observed in the cytoplasm of the persistent EEHV4-infected elephant monocytes. Our study demonstrated for the first time that apoptosis of the PBMCs increased in cases of EEHV-HD.

Loss-of-function GATA3 alterations in breast cancer are associated with poor prognosis. Here, we sought to understand the tumor-suppressive functions GATA3 normally performs. We discovered a role for GATA3 in suppressing epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in breast cancer by activating miR-455-3p expression. Enforced expression of miR-455-3p alone partially prevented EMT induced by transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) both in cells and tumor xenografts by directly inhibiting key components of TGF-β signaling. Pathway and biochemical analyses showed that one miRNA-455–3p target, the TGF-β–induced protein ZEB1, recruits the Mi-2/nucleosome remodeling and deacetylase (NuRD) complex to the promotor region of miR-455 to strictly repress the GATA3-induced transcription of this microRNA. Considering that ZEB1 enhances TGF-β signaling, we delineated a double-feedback interaction between ZEB1 and miR-455-3p, in addition to the repressive effect of miR-455-3p on TGF-β signaling.

https://openalex.org/W2971897041,"Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is a prevalent neurological disorder with many patients experiencing poor seizure control with existing anti-epileptic drugs. Thus, novel insights into the mechanisms of epileptogenesis and identification of new drug targets can be transformative. Changes in ion channel function have been shown to play a role in generating the aberrant neuronal activity observed in TLE. Previous work demonstrates that hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channels regulate neuronal excitability and are mislocalized within CA1 pyramidal cells in a rodent model of TLE. The subcellular distribution of HCN channels is regulated by an auxiliary subunit, tetratricopeptide repeat–containing Rab8b-interacting protein (TRIP8b), and disruption of this interaction correlates with channel mislocalization. However, the molecular mechanisms responsible for HCN channel dysregulation in TLE are unclear. Here we investigated whether changes in TRIP8b phosphorylation are sufficient to alter HCN channel function. We identified a phosphorylation site at residue Ser237 of TRIP8b that enhances binding to HCN channels and influences channel gating by altering the affinity of TRIP8b for the HCN cytoplasmic domain. Using a phosphospecific antibody, we demonstrate that TRIP8b phosphorylated at Ser237 is enriched in CA1 distal dendrites and that phosphorylation is reduced in the kainic acid model of TLE. Overall, our findings indicate that the TRIP8b–HCN interaction can be modulated by changes in phosphorylation and suggest that loss of TRIP8b phosphorylation may affect HCN channel properties during epileptogenesis. These results highlight the potential of drugs targeting posttranslational modifications to restore TRIP8b phosphorylation to reduce excitability in TLE. Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is a prevalent neurological disorder with many patients experiencing poor seizure control with existing anti-epileptic drugs. Thus, novel insights into the mechanisms of epileptogenesis and identification of new drug targets can be transformative. Changes in ion channel function have been shown to play a role in generating the aberrant neuronal activity observed in TLE. Previous work demonstrates that hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channels regulate neuronal excitability and are mislocalized within CA1 pyramidal cells in a rodent model of TLE. The subcellular distribution of HCN channels is regulated by an auxiliary subunit, tetratricopeptide repeat–containing Rab8b-interacting protein (TRIP8b), and disruption of this interaction correlates with channel mislocalization. However, the molecular mechanisms responsible for HCN channel dysregulation in TLE are unclear. Here we investigated whether changes in TRIP8b phosphorylation are sufficient to alter HCN channel function. We identified a phosphorylation site at residue Ser237 of TRIP8b that enhances binding to HCN channels and influences channel gating by altering the affinity of TRIP8b for the HCN cytoplasmic domain. Using a phosphospecific antibody, we demonstrate that TRIP8b phosphorylated at Ser237 is enriched in CA1 distal dendrites and that phosphorylation is reduced in the kainic acid model of TLE.

Although amyloid fibrils of β2m in patients are observed at neutral pH, formation of β2m amyloids in vitro has been difficult to discern at neutral pH because of the amyloid-resistant native structure. Here, to further understand the mechanism underlying in vivo amyloid formation, we investigated the relationship between protein folding/unfolding and misfolding leading to amyloid formation. Using thioflavin T assays, CD spectroscopy, and transmission EM analyses, we found that β2m efficiently forms amyloid fibrils even at neutral pH by heating with agitation at high-salt conditions. We constructed temperature- and NaCl concentration–dependent conformational phase diagrams in the presence or absence of agitation, revealing how amyloid formation under neutral pH conditions is related to thermal unfolding and breakdown of supersaturation. Of note, after supersaturation breakdown and following the law of mass action, the β2m monomer equilibrium shifted to the unfolded state, destabilizing the native state and thereby enabling amyloid formation even under physiological conditions with a low amount of unfolded precursor. The amyloid fibrils depolymerized at both lower and higher temperatures, resembling cold- or heat-induced denaturation of globular proteins.

https://openalex.org/W2971762169,"Evidence has clearly established that women are underrepresented in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) disciplines despite decades of interventions aimed at achieving gender parity (National Science Foundation, 2017National Science FoundationWomen, Minorities, and Persons with Disabilities in Science and Engineering. Arlington, VA, 2017https://www.nsf.gov/statistics/2017/nsf17310/data.cfmGoogle Scholar). The dearth of women in STEM is a complex cultural phenomenon influenced by cognitive, motivational, and sociological factors (Wang and Degol, 2017Wang M.T. Degol J.L. Gender Gap in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM): Current Knowledge, Implications for Practice, Policy, and Future Directions.Educ. Psychol. Rev. 2017; 29: 119-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). As such, efforts to address gender imbalance in STEM must be multi-faceted: that is, aimed at reducing barriers and supporting women throughout their educational and academic careers using a variety of policy-based and practical interventions. Four years ago, The New York Stem Cell Foundation Research Institute (NYSCF) convened a diverse group of scientists, physicians, leaders, and other stakeholders to create a Working Group for the Initiative on Women in Science and Engineering (IWISE). Over the course of three productive meetings and with support from the Doris Duke Charitable Foundation, the IWISE Working Group proposed seven actionable strategies to advance women in STEM (Smith et al., 2015Smith K.A. Arlotta P. Watt F.M. Solomon S.L. Initiative on Women in Science and Engineering Working GroupSeven actionable strategies for advancing women in science, engineering, and medicine.Cell Stem Cell. 2015; 16: 221-224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). One of these strategies involved creating an institutional report card for gender equality to be completed by individuals applying for one of NYSCF’s highly competitive grant and fellowship programs on behalf of their own academic or private research institution. The goal of this report card was to (1) establish a cross-sectional benchmark of gender representation and related policies against which future interventions, policy changes, or sociocultural progress could be measured (i.e., a “pilot phase” of data collection); and (2) motivate institutions to address their own gender disparities by enabling comparisons over time and against other institutions of similar discipline and type, including highlighting best practices by high-performing institutions (i.e., the “recognition phase”). Indeed, addressing the complex issues that prevent institutional gender equality in STEM requires high-quality baseline data, as underscored in 15 years of experiences by the UK’s Athena Scientific Women’s Academic Network (SWAN) and the US’s ADVANCE program (Rosser et al., 2019Rosser S.V. Barnard S. Carnes M. Munir F. Athena SWAN and ADVANCE: effectiveness and lessons learned.Lancet. 2019; 393: 604-608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Here we discuss the outcomes of the 4-year pilot phase of the institutional report card initiative, which gathered information from over 500 institutions in 38 countries, and we outline future directions for efforts to promote gender equity in STEM. In February 2015, the IWISE Working Group developed an Institutional Report Card for Gender Equality. The report card was designed to evaluate the commitment of individual institutions to promoting gender parity by collecting quantitative data on gender representation throughout the educational and academic pipeline (e.g., among students, professors, faculty member recruits, invited speakers, and key departmental or institutional committees) in addition to qualitative data on institutional policies to support women in science. Additional details and the report card itself can be found at https://nyscf.org/reportcard. Over a pilot phase spanning four Request for Application (RFA) cycles (2016–2019), NYSCF required every individual applying for funding through the competitive NYSCF-Druckenmiller Fellowship and NYSCF-Robertson Investigator Awards to submit a report card on behalf of their institution. During this pilot phase, it was explicitly communicated that data from the report card would not affect funding application decisions. After the 2019 RFA cycle closed, all the completed reports were consolidated into a secure, anonymized, and aggregated database for cleaning and analysis (see Supplemental Information). Institutional grades were calculated on a 10-point scale by multiplying the average percentage of women among undergraduate and graduate/post-graduate students; assistant, associate, and full professors; and invited seminar speakers by 10. Of 1,287 submitted report cards, 741 provided complete and unique information for a given institution in a given year (Figure S1). Several institutions submitted report cards over multiple years (2 years, n = 82; 3 years, n = 35; 4 years, n = 16). In total, the data represent 541 unique institutions across 38 countries (Figure 1). The majority of report cards were completed by North American (72%) or European (18%) institutions. Two-thirds (66%) of these institutions represented the “basic sciences” and one-third (34%) represented “clinical sciences.” The vast majority (86.4%) of institutions were university based, as opposed to research institutes, foundations, or privately funded hospital systems. As shown in Figure 2, women were well represented among undergraduate and graduate/post-graduate student populations (mean ± SD: 57.1% ± 15.7% and 52.2% ± 16.0%, respectively). Among faculty, however, as seniority increased, the representation of women decreased (assistant professors, 42.0% ± 21.6%; associate professors, 34.2% ± 23.4%; full professors, 24.0% ± 18.2%). In evaluating faculty recruitment over the last 5 years, women represented a greater proportion of first-time tenure track recruits (40.4% ± 26.6%) than lateral/senior hires of those who had already achieved tenure (33.7% ± 30.0%). Furthermore, nearly one-third of institutions responding to this question (116/377) reported that less than 10% of their tenured faculty recruits were women. Women were underrepresented as external seminar program speakers (35.2% ± 15.3%) and in committees for faculty promotions (32.8% ± 16.3%), institutional strategy (38.5% ± 18.4%), and graduate student appointment/recruitment (39.5% ± 17.4%). Representation was slightly more balanced on finance (43.9% ± 26.7%) and awards committees (41.0% ± 22.9%). The average ± SD grade across all institutions was 4.0 ± 1.3 out of 10, corresponding to 40% overall female representation among students, faculty, and invited speakers. Figure 2 shows that grades were not normally distributed, however, with a notable rightward skew as very few institutions (only 103/538) achieved a grade 5.0 or above (corresponding to ≥ 50% female representation). Grades were higher at institutions with a clinical rather than basic science focus (4.1 ± 1.3 versus 3.9 ± 1.2, p = 0.026) and those located within Europe rather than North America (4.5 ± 1.5 versus 3.7 ± 1.1, p < 0.0001). Among the 71 institutions with data spanning >2 years (e.g., 2016 and 2018), we performed an exploratory longitudinal analysis to evaluate trends in female representation over time. Just over half of institutions (42/71) improved their grades; however, the magnitude was modest (mean ± SD: 0.80 ± 0.80; or an 8.0% increase in female representation). Furthermore, among the 40% of institutions with worsening grades over time, the magnitude of this decrease was almost identical to that of the improvements (−0.74 ± 0.52; or a 7.4% decrease in female representation). In other words, our longitudinal analysis revealed no appreciable trend in gender representation changes, albeit over a short period of time and in a relatively limited subset of institutions. At the time of report card submission, 38% of institutions (278/741) had in place additional support mechanisms to fund paid family leave. Additional policies to support female scientists focused on childcare (e.g., on-site or contract-guaranteed positions at nearby daycares, extended hours, or paid childcare for at least 1 year), flexibility (e.g., videoconferencing for pregnant scientists, lactation rooms, family-friendly meeting times, technology to enable research from home, or extended eligibility periods for leadership positions for those who have taken parental leave), funding (e.g., a “mother’s bonus” to be used for personal or research purposes, or extra travel allowances to pay for children and/or sitters to attend meetings), and career development initiatives (e.g., additional research or technical support to enable early-career female scientists to meet professional milestones, mentoring and networking programs, or mandated unconscious bias training for those serving on promotional committees). With regards to gender representation on committees, 8% (56/741) had an explicit requirement for a minimum number or percentage of women, 16% (117/741) had general policies promoting gender diversity, and 77% (561/741) had no policy on the issue. Over a 4-year pilot phase, NYSCF collected 741 unique report cards representing 541 institutions, 38 countries, and a diverse array of organizational structures and scientific disciplines. The collection effort itself was revealing: particularly in the early years of the report card initiative, applicants often cited apprehension from Department Heads who are required to submit the report card and indicated data collection or accessibility issues. This has improved in the last 2 years, with a decrease in clarifying questions asked, and an uptick in percentage of report cards completed by the RFA deadline. Furthermore, by explicitly asking for data on gender representation and parental leave policies, this report card initiative has implicitly encouraged institutions to scrutinize their own policies and procedures to promote gender equity. Despite an average grade of 4.0/10 across all institutions (corresponding to 40% female representation among students, professors, and invited seminar speakers), the proportion of women holding higher ranks or serving on influential committees remains disappointingly low. This is consistent with literature demonstrating decreased promotional opportunities and increased attrition of women throughout the academic and professional pipelines (Nelson, 2017Nelson D.J. Diversity of Science and Engineering Faculty at Research Universities. In Diversity in the Scientific Community Volume 1: Quantifying Diversity and Formulating Success. American Chemical Society, 2017: 15-86Google Scholar) due to a myriad of reasons including a lack of sponsorship or networking opportunities, disparities in funding and salary support, work-life tensions that disproportionately burden women, and implicit biases that slow the trajectory of women into leadership positions. In other words, the problems seem to lie less in the recruitment of women into STEM and more so in the retention and promotion of these women into those high-level positions where mentorship, influence, and groundbreaking research are most likely to originate. Of note, committee representation was not included in the summary grade calculation because a 50:50 gender balance may not represent an equitable workload distribution or be the most productive use of a female scientist’s effort and time, depending on the percentage of women within that organization and the type of committee (i.e., administrative versus strategic). Nevertheless, the findings about committee representation reported in the bottom row of the figure are sobering—institutions must monitor closely women’s participation on committees, not only because diversity is valuable to promote the collective intelligence of groups but also because certain committees do have strategic importance and may serve as pathways to develop the leadership skills and visibility necessary to advance within an organization. Nevertheless, the findings of this analysis, which are intended to serve as a cross-sectional benchmark rather than an evaluation of incremental change over time, should not discount efforts that have been made to promote the representation of women in STEM, for example by Athena SWAN, ADVANCE, or the Science in Australia Gender Equity (SAGE) programs. It is notable that several institutions—particularly those in Europe—reported to us innovative policies that subscribe to the seven actionable strategies proposed by IWISE in 2015, including flexible family care spending (#1), “extra hands” funding (#2), and gender-balanced peer review and speaker selection policies (#3) (Smith et al., 2015Smith K.A.

Initiative on Women in Science and Engineering Working GroupSeven actionable strategies for advancing women in science, engineering, and medicine.Cell Stem Cell. 2015; 16: 221-224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Additional initiatives noted in the literature include the creation of a “future STEM faculty” listserv to facilitate diversity in applicant pools (part of an ADVANCE project by Case Western Reserve University; https://case.edu/ideal-n/about/project-description/full-project-description) (#7), incorporation of implicit bias statements in funding applications by the Doris Duke Charitable Foundation (#4) (Alvarez et al., 2019Alvarez S.N.E. Jagsi R. Abbuhl S.B. Lee C.J. Myers E.R. Promoting gender equity in grant making: what can a funder do?.Lancet. 2019; 393: e9-e11Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), and dissemination of a quarterly publication focused on women’s health, women in science, and funding opportunities by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Office of Research on Women’s Health (https://orwh.od.nih.gov/sites/orwh/files/docs/ORWH-Spring-Newsletter2019-Vol2no1-508.pdf) (#5). The second phase of our institutional report card initiative (i.e., the “recognition phase”) will be modeled—in part—after the Athena SWAN charter. Since 2005, Athena SWAN has conferred awards of bronze, silver, or gold status to member institutions who have demonstrated good practices and meaningful interventions to advance gender equity (https://www.ecu.ac.uk/equality-charters/athena-swan/). In 2016, the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Biomedical Research Center began requiring Athena SWAN silver status in order to shortlist applications for funding (https://www.nihr.ac.uk). For any strategies designed to promote or recognize women in STEM, however, an important consideration will be limiting administrative burden on both male and female applicants, for example by suggesting that an administrative assistant or representative from the Office of Diversity and Inclusion collect the data for the applicant's and Department Head’s review. Independent surveys and case studies suggest that Athena SWAN has had a perceived positive impact on women’s career progression in STEM by improving opportunities for training and development, transparency, fairness of workload allocation, and department engagement in equality and diversity matters (Munir et al., 2013Munir F. Mason C. McDermott H. Morris J. Bagilhole B. Nevill M. Advancing women’s careers in science, technology, engineering, mathematics and medicine: Evaluating the effectiveness and impact of the Athena SWAN charter. Equality Challenge Unit, London2013Google Scholar), although objective data are lacking. Furthermore, studies suggest that women perform most of this gender-equity work (Caffrey et al., 2016Caffrey L. Wyatt D. Fudge N. Mattingley H. Williamson C. McKevitt C. Gender equity programmes in academic medicine: a realist evaluation approach to Athena SWAN processes.BMJ Open. 2016; 6: e012090Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, Munir et al., 2013Munir F.

McDermott H. Morris J. Bagilhole B. Nevill M. Advancing women’s careers in science, technology, engineering, mathematics and medicine: Evaluating the effectiveness and impact of the Athena SWAN charter. Equality Challenge Unit, London2013Google Scholar) may foster resentment. To capitalize on the opportunities created by the report card initiative, the second phase of NYSCF’s institutional report card strategy will focus on highlighting best practices, providing comparative data to institutes, and monitoring progress over time. We will also investigate the inclusion of other critical equality factors in the report card, such as the presence of women in top leadership positions, institutional investment in data collection and leadership development programming, the retention of tenured women as an indicator of a female-friendly work environment, and equitable salaries across gender, race, and ethnicity, as currently implemented by the Doris Duke Charitable Foundation application process (Alvarez et al., 2019Alvarez S.N.E.

This initiative will continue to focus on high-quality data collection in an effort to raise awareness of specific gender disparities and evaluate whether improvements in gender representation are occurring as a result of, versus independently from, report card collection. We hope that other funding bodies, like the NIH, will adopt a similar report card for funding mechanisms. In the absence of sweeping societal and cultural change, only through purposeful strategies and effort by scientific institutions will women reach gender parity in STEM.

https://openalex.org/W2971823902,"Adenosine deaminase RNA-specific B1 (ADARB1), an adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) RNA-editing enzyme, has been found to play an essential role in the development of cancer. However, the specific function of ADARB1 in lung cancer, especially in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), is still not fully understood and requires further study. In our study, integrative bioinformatics were used to analyze the detailed function of ADARB1 in LUAD. By conducting bioinformatics analyses of several public databases, such as Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis (GEPIA), GE-mini, and Oncomine, we found significantly decreased ADARB1 expression in LUAD cells and tissues. Moreover, RT-PCR and Western blot showed lower ADARB1 expression in H358 and A549 LUAD cells compared to human bronchial epithelial Beas-2B cells. Wound Healing Assay indicated that knockdown ADARB1 could promote LUAD cell metastasis. By using the Kaplan-Meier Plotter tool, we found that downregulation of ADARB1 was related to shorter first progression (FP), overall survival time (OS) and post-progression survival time (PPS). The relevant clinical data acquired from the Wanderer database indicated that the expression and methylation values of ADARB1 were significantly associated with the clinical characteristics of LUAD. Using DNA methylation inhibitor, we found DNMT inhibitor 5-aza-2-deoxycytidine (5-azaD) could promote the expression of ADARB1 and reverse the inhibition effect of ADARB1 in migration. In addition, functional enrichment analysis of ADARB1-associated coexpression genes was further conducted. Our investigation demonstrated that low levels of ADARB1 were specifically found in LUAD, and this gene might be a potential target in the diagnostic and prognostic evaluation of LUAD patients."
https://openalex.org/W2971903603,"Introduction Moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) has been shown to be associated with autonomic regulation of the heart measured with heart rate variability (HRV). Only a limited amount of studies have examined this relationship among adolescents, and the effects of increasing PA on HRV is not well established. The aim of this study was to investigate how overall self-reported PA associates with HRV in a large population of adolescent men. Methods The study was part of the Finnish MOPO study consisting of 3629 young men (mean age 18, SD 1 years) enrolled for military call-ups in 2009–2013. Overall PA, including both the intensity and frequency of habitual exercise, was assessed by a questionnaire and the respondents categorized into four groups of PA (low, moderate, high and top). Short-term HRV, physical performance and body composition were measured. Results HRV, as indicated by mean ln rMSSD, increased according the PA categories as follows: low (3.65 ms (SD 0.7), p<0.001 vs. other groups), moderate (3.78 ms (0.6) p<0.001), high (3.85 ms (0.6) p<0.001) and top activity (3.93 ms (0.6) p<0.001) According to the multivariable linear regression analysis, a significant positive relationship (β = 0.129, p<0.05) was observed between self-reported PA and ln rMSSD independent of body mass index, waist circumference and fat percentage. Conclusions Physical activity was positively associated with cardiac autonomic regulation, in adolescent men. A linear increase in HRV according to PA was observed, suggesting that even slight increments in PA might be beneficial for cardiac autonomic regulation The results emphasize the importance of physical activity in improving cardiac health in young people."

To examine the biochemical reaction in vitro, we established an efficient reconstitution system for the polyubiquitination of p53 by the E6AP-E6 complex. We demonstrate that E6AP-E6 formed a stable ternary complex with p53, which underwent extensive polyubiquitination when the isolated ternary complex was incubated with E1, E2, and ubiquitin. Mass spectrometry and biochemical analysis of the reaction products identified lysine residues as p53 ubiquitination sites. A p53 mutant with arginine substitutions of its 18 lysine residues was not ubiquitinated. Analysis of additional p53 mutants retaining only one or two intact ubiquitination sites revealed that chain elongation at each of these sites was limited to 5–6-mers. We also determined the size distribution of ubiquitin chains released by en bloc cleavage from polyubiquitinated p53 to be 2–6-mers. Taken together, these results strongly suggest that p53 is multipolyubiquitinated with short chains by E6AP-E6. In addition, analysis of growing chains provided strong evidence for step-by-step chain elongation. Thus, we hypothesize that p53 is polyubiquitinated in a stepwise manner through the back-and-forth movement of the C-lobe, and the permissive distance for the movement of the C-lobe restricts the length of the chains in the E6AP-E6-p53 ternary complex. Finally, we show that multipolyubiquitination at different sites provides a signal for proteasomal degradation.

Among several types of Ub ligases, the mechanism of polyubiquitination mediated by RING (really interesting new gene)-type Ub ligases has been studied extensively. Most RING-type Ub ligases first attach Ub to the target protein, and then transfer a second Ub to the attached Ub moiety; the next Ub is then transferred to the distal Ub moiety, and so on (6Ye Y.

However, the contribution of each part of the reaction to overall target protein polyubiquitination remains unclear. In this regard, analysis using fully reconstituted systems is necessary to understand how HECT-type Ub ligases execute complex tasks. The present biochemical study demonstrates that E6AP-E6 forms a ternary complex with p53 and generates multiple Lys48-linked short poly-Ub chains via stepwise reactions. We hypothesize that p53 is polyubiquitinated in a stepwise manner through the back-and-forth movement of the C-lobe, and the permissive distance for the movement of the C-lobe restricts the length of the chains in the E6AP-E6-p53 ternary complex. The biochemical reactions of polyubiquitination by HECT-type Ub ligases were analyzed by establishing a reconstitution system for the polyubiquitination of p53 by E6AP-E6 in vitro (Fig. 1 and Fig. S1). Remarkably, co-expression of E6AP and E6 in Escherichia coli cells and their subsequent purification as an E6AP-E6 complex yielded a highly active preparation. Standard reactions were performed at 30 °C for 10 min, and the reaction products were detected by Western blotting (Fig. 1). In this system, efficient ubiquitination of hisp53 and self-ubiquitination of E6AP were detected as slower migrating forms in the presence of E1, E2 (UBCH5c or UBCH7), E6, and Ub, as reported previously (Fig. 1A) (1Scheffner M.

To confirm the formation of thiol linkages between E6AP and Ub (10Scheffner M. Nuber U. Huibregtse J.M. Protein ubiquitination involving an E1-E2-E3 enzyme ubiquitin thioester cascade.Nature. 1995; 373 (7800044): 81-8310.1038/373081a0Crossref PubMed Scopus (743) Google Scholar), assays were performed for 30 s without hisp53 to avoid Ub transfer from E6AP∼Ub to hisp53, and the products were analyzed under nonreducing and reducing conditions by Western blotting with anti-E6AP antibody (Fig. 1B). The results clearly showed E2-dependent formation of E6AP∼Ub in the absence of E6 (lane 4), as indicated by the sensitivity of the complex to a reducing agent (lane 8). In the presence of E6, many bands larger than E6AP∼Ub were detected (lane 2). Treatment with the reducing agent resulted in the disappearance of several products; however, some products were still detectable (lane 6), suggesting that bands detected under nonreducing conditions were a mixture of self-ubiquitinated E6AP and self-ubiquitinated E6AP with an additional Ub via thiol linkage. These results demonstrated that the reconstitution system efficiently generated E6AP∼Ub. The effect of the concentration of E6AP-E6 on p53 ubiquitination was examined (Fig. 2A). Although the amounts of polyubiquitinated products increased in a manner dependent on E6AP-E6 concentration, relatively large products were detectable even in the presence of low E6AP-E6 concentrations. This result suggested that once E6AP-E6 binds to hisp53, it successively transfers many Ub molecules without dissociation (i.e. E6AP-E6 might form a stable complex with p53). To examine complex formation, hisE6AP, E6, and p53 were co-produced in E. coli. Then hisE6AP was purified in the presence of 1 m NaCl by nickel affinity, and fractionated by gel filtration chromatography to separate hisE6AP-E6 from the ternary complex consisting of hisE6AP, E6, and p53. Each fraction was analyzed again by gel filtration (Fig. 2B). The three proteins, hisE6AP, E6, and p53, co-eluted together at 600–700 kDa of apparent molecular mass, which was considerably larger than the mass of hisE6AP-E6 at 170–200 kDa. We analyzed the intensity of each protein component in the peak fractions from the gel images of Fig. 2B. The calculated stoichiometries of each subunit in the hisE6AP-E6-p53 and hisE6AP-E6 complexes were close to 1:1:1 and 1:1, respectively (Table 1). The ligase activity of the ternary complex was confirmed by a ubiquitination assay with the additional introduction of E1, UBCH5c, and Ub (Fig. 2C). These results suggest that the stable binding of E6AP-E6 to p53 ensures that each p53 molecule is ubiquitinated processively.Table 1Stoichiometries of protein components in the hisE6AP-E6-p53 and hisE6AP-E6 complexeshisE6AP-E6-p53 complexhisE6AP-E6 complexProteinMWaMW, molecular weight calculated from amino acid sequences.

Open table in a new tab Next, the effect of E2 concentration was examined (Fig. 3). The results showed that the concentration of E2 strongly affected the size of the products during a 10-min incubation. Both UBCH5c and UBCH7 supported the ubiquitination of hisp53 at similar concentrations (Fig. 3, A and B). N-terminal histidine-tagged UBCH5c (hisUBCH5c) was inefficient (Fig. 3C), as an ∼17-fold higher concentration of hisUBCH5c than UBCH5c was required to obtain similar levels of ubiquitination. We also tested two specific mutants of UBCH5c, S22R (designated as UBCH5cSR), which is deficient in self-assembly of E2∼Ub conjugates and therefore inefficient with RING-type Ub ligases (26Brzovic P.S.

Unlike the RING-type ligases, UBCH5cSR supported p53 ubiquitination by E6AP-E6 (Fig. 3D). By contrast, UBCH5c2A showed a clear defect in p53 ubiquitination with ∼2000-fold reduced affinity (Fig. 3E). We excluded the possibility that defects in hisUBCH5c and UBCH5c2A were attributed to inefficient E2∼Ub formation catalyzed by E1, because both hisUBCH5c and UBCH5c2A were charged as well as UBCH5c and UBCH5cSR for 30 s (Fig. 3F). Then we analyzed the subsequent reaction step, E6AP trans-thiolation (Fig. 3G). The reactions were performed for 30 s in the absence of E6 to prevent subsequent Ub transfer to E6AP itself (see Fig. 1B). The results showed that UBCH5c and UBCH5cSR supported E6AP∼Ub formation at 50 nm (Fig. 3G, lanes 2 and 3). By contrast, hisUBCH5c was ineffective at 50 nm but effective at 1600 nm (lanes 5 and 6), and UBCH5c2A was apparently defective even at 1600 nm (lane 4). These results indicated a positive correlation between the efficiency of p53 ubiquitination and E6AP∼Ub formation, suggesting that trans-thiolation is a critical step in determining the rate of p53 ubiquitination. The reaction mechanism was further analyzed by examining the time course of the reaction (Fig. 4A). The result showed that the size of ubiquitinated hisp53 increased in a time-dependent manner, reaching the maximum level at 30 min. Unanchored Ub chains were generated after 15 min and increased considerably after 60 min. Hyperubiquitination of E6AP was initiated at 10 min and reached a maximum level at 60 min. Monoubiquitination of UBCH5c was observed at later time points (Fig. 4A). The purified E6AP-E6-p53 complex (Fig. 2B) showed similar patterns (Fig. S2A). If polyubiquitination proceeds processively on each hisp53 molecule, a reduced concentration of E6AP should not affect the rate of the chain elongation. To examine this, we analyzed the effect of a lower E6AP-E6 concentration (8 nm, 4-fold lower than the standard concentration) on the time course of polyubiquitination (Fig. 4B). As expected, the rates of chain elongation were essentially identical to those of the standard concentration (compare top panels of Fig. 4, A and B). Importantly, large amounts of unmodified hisp53 remained even after a 150-min incubation that resulted in almost all E6AP being self-ubiquitinated (Fig. 4B), indicating that hisp53 was present in excess over E6AP-E6. This result supports the notion that each hisp53 molecule undergoes processive polyubiquitination (i.e. once an E6AP-E6 molecule binds to a hisp53 molecule, the hisp53 molecule is processively polyubiquitinated by the E6AP-E6 molecule). By contrast, the E2 concentration strongly affected the rate of ubiquitination of hisp53 (Fig. 3). Thus, the time course was performed under a lower UBCH5c concentration (12.5 nm, 4-fold lower than the standard condition) (Fig. 4C). The result showed that the size of ubiquitinated hisp53 increased at a slower rate and reached the maximum level at 60 min; additionally, all other reactions were also delayed. Consistent with the pattern of hisp53-ubiquitination, unanchored Ub chains were generated after 60 min, and hyper-self-ubiquitination of E6AP was now detectable after 60 min. Even after 150 min, E6AP ubiquitination was still partial. Accumulation of unanchored Ub chains and monoubiquitination of UBCH5c were also delayed beyond 150 min (Fig. 4C). It has been established that E6AP specifically generates Lys48-linked Ub chains (11Kim H.C. Huibregtse J.M. Polyubiquitination by HECT E3s and the determinants of chain type specificity.Mol. Cell.

To confirm this in our reconstitution system, a time course of the reactions was performed with a Ub mutant, UbK48R (Fig. 4D). In contrast to the reactions performed with WT Ub (Fig. 4A), the size of ubiquitinated hisp53 increased to ∼110 kDa in the early time points, and then gradually increased to fractions of ∼150 kDa together with minor fractions of considerably higher molecular mass (>250 kDa). Such restriction was also observed in the self-ubiquitination of E6AP (Fig. 4D). Similar results were obtained with methylated Ub, but the higher-molecular mass species (>250 kDa) were not detectable (Fig. S2B). Because Ub is methylated on amino groups and thus unable to form poly-Ub chains, the ubiquitinated products formed by methylated Ub are definitely (multi-)monoubiquitinated forms (33Hershko A. Heller H. Occurrence of a polyubiquitin structure in ubiquitin-protein conjugates.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1985; 128 (2988526): 1079-108610.1016/0006-291X(85)91050-2Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Thus, the higher-molecular mass species (>250 kDa) detected with UbK48R (Fig. 4D), but not detected with methylated Ub, are most likely polyubiquitinated forms. These results suggested that E6AP predominantly forms Lys48 linkages and potentially other linkage(s) inefficiently and that p53 was multiubiquitinated at probably 7–12 sites, as estimated from the size of 110–150 kDa. The Ub-linkage types in these reactions were also determined by quantitative MS-based analysis called Ub-AQUA (absolute quantitation)/PRM (parallel reaction monitoring) (34Tsuchiya H. Tanaka K. Saeki Y. The parallel reaction monitoring method contributes to a highly sensitive polyubiquitin chain quantification.Biochem. Biophys. Res.

The reaction products (>150 kDa) detected at 10 min for WT Ub and at 30 min for UbK48R were subjected to Ub-AQUA/PRM. In the WT Ub reaction, most Ub molecules were found in Lys48 linkages (49%) or unmodified (50%) (Table 2). Shotgun MS analysis identified 14 lysine residues of p53 as the ubiquitination sites (Fig. 5A). Ubiquitination was not detected at four lysine residues. The remaining two lysine residues were not covered by the MS analysis. Some sites were simultaneously ubiquitinated. In the UbK48R reaction, ∼95% was unmodified Ub (Table 2), confirming the predominance of multimonoubiquitination, and a substantial fraction of Lys11 linkages (4.7%) was detected (Table 2). The same 14 lysine residues were detected as sites modified with UbK48R (Fig. 5B). These results indicated that the large-molecular weight fractions observed in the UbK48R reaction contained Lys11 linkages.Table 2Ubiquitin-AQUA/PRM analysis of ubiquitin fragments with GG modifications in lysine residuesUbiquitinDetected fragmentaThree independent reaction products were analyzed as described previously (33), and the averages are shown.TITLEbThe amounts of the TITLE (TITLEVESSDTIDNVLK) fragment were determined as internal controls.TotalcTotal ubiquitin levels were assessed as the sum of TITLE, Lys11(GG), and Lys27(GG) fragments.

Murine model of lupus induced by pristane in BALB/c mice is an experimental model that resembles some clinical and immunological SLE pathogenesis. Nevertheless, there is no experimental evidence that relates this model to cognitive dysfunction associated with NR2A/2B relative expression. To evaluate cognitive impairment related to memory deficits in a murine model of lupus induced by pristane in BALB/c mice related to mRNA relative expression levels of NR2A/2B hippocampal subunits in short and long-term memory task at 7 and 12 weeks after LPS exposition in a behavioral test with the use of Barnes maze. A total of 54 female BALB/c mice 8–12 weeks old were included into 3 groups: 7 and 12 weeks using pristane alone (0.5 mL of pristane) by a single intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection. A control group (single i.p. injection of 0.5 mL NaCl 0.9%) and pristane plus LPS exposure using single i.p. pristane injection and LPS of E. coli O55:B5, in a dose of 3mg/kg diluted in NaCl 0.9% 16 weeks post-pristane administration. To determine cognitive dysfunction, mice were tested in a Barnes maze. Serum anti-Sm antibodies and relative expression of hippocampal NR2A/2B subunits (GAPDH as housekeeping gene) with SYBR green quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and 2-ΔΔCT method were determined in the groups. Downregulation of hippocampal NR2A subunit was more evident than NR2B in pristane and pristane+LPS at 7 and 12 weeks of treatment and it is related to learning and memory disturbance assayed by Barnes maze. This is the first report using the murine model of lupus induced by pristane that analyzes the NMDA subunit receptors, finding a downregulation of NR2A subunit related to learning and memory disturbance being more evident when they were exposed to LPS."

Although AP2 binding sites on the VEGFR-2 promoter have been predicted by computational modeling approaches (21Patterson C. Perrella M.A. Hsieh C.M. Yoshizumi M. Lee M.E. Haber E.

In this study, we demonstrate that PKD1 and PKD2 directly regulate VEGFR-2 transcription through transcription factor AP2β in endothelial cells. We demonstrate that silencing PKD1 or PKD2 enhances association of AP2β with the VEGFR-2 promoter, decreasing VEGFR-2 transcription. The repressive effect of AP2β on VEGFR-2 expression was confirmed in AP2β-overexpressing and silenced endothelial cells as well as AP2β knockout mouse embryos. Furthermore, we identified that PKD directly phosphorylates AP2β at serine 258 and 277 and that PKD-mediated phosphorylation controls subcellular localization and association with the VEGFR-2 promoter of AP2β. To evaluate the role of PKD in VEGFR-2 expression in endothelial cells, human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were transfected with PKD1 siRNA or PKD2 siRNA. Knockdown of PKD1 or PKD2 down-regulated VEGFR-2 protein and transcript (Fig. 1, A and B). The inhibitive effect of PKD on VEGFR-2 was also observed in human blood outgrowth endothelial cells (BOECs) (Fig. 1). Administration of a pan-PKD inhibitor, CRT0066101 (CRT), reduced the phosphorylation of HSP27, a well-established downstream target of PKD1 and PKD2, and significantly inhibited the expression of VEGFR-2 (Fig. 1C), suggesting that activation of PKD suppresses the expression control of VEGFR-2. Indeed, overexpression of WT PKD1, a constitutively active form of PKD1 (PKD1.CA), and PKD2 in HUVECs increased the expression of VEGFR-2, among which PKD1.CA exhibited the greatest effect on VEGFR-2 up-regulation (Fig. 1D). Furthermore, in accordance with a published report (7Evans I.M. Zachary I.C. Protein kinase D in vascular biology and angiogenesis.IUBMB Life. 2011; 63 (21488147): 258-26310.1002/iub.456Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), down-regulation of PKD1 or PKD2 significantly inhibited VEGF-induced endothelial proliferation and migration (Fig. 1, E and F). The effect of PKD on angiogenesis in vivo was further examined in a Matrigel plug assay (Fig. 1G). Matrigel containing PBS vehicle, VEGF alone, or a combination of VEGF and CRT, was subcutaneously implanted in mice. Our results showed that inhibition of PKD activity with CRT suppressed VEGF-induced angiogenesis in vivo. Taken together, these results suggest that endogenous PKD1 and PKD2 control expression of VEGFR-2 and positively regulate the proliferation and migration of endothelial cells as well as angiogenesis in vivo. We sought to determine the molecular mechanism through which PKD modulates VEGFR-2 expression. Based on bioinformatics data, three AP2 binding sites exist within the VEGFR-2 promoter between bp −143 to −134, −102 to −89, and −69 to −60 (21Patterson C. Perrella M.A. Hsieh C.M. Yoshizumi M. Lee M.E. Haber E. Cloning and functional analysis of the promoter for KDR/flk-1, a receptor for vascular endothelial growth factor.J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270 (7559454): 23111-2311810.1074/jbc.270.39.23111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Thus, we hypothesized that PKD may down-regulate VEGFR-2 through AP2-mediated transcriptional repression of the VEGFR-2 promoter. The results of our ChIP assay showed that AP2α bound the VEGFR-2 promoter but did not show differences among control, PKD1 knockdown, and PKD2 knockdown groups (Fig. 2A). However, increased AP2β bound the VEGFR-2 promoter upon PKD1 knockdown, and this effect was most pronounced in PKD2-ablated HUVECs, as evidenced by the CHIP assay (Fig. 2A). To demonstrate AP2β-specific inhibition of the VEGFR-2 promoter, serial deletion luciferase constructs of the VEGFR-2 promoter containing three, two, one, or no AP2β binding sites were transfected into HUVECs with or without an AP2β-GFP expression plasmid. Maximum inhibition of luciferase activity was observed with the construct containing three AP2β binding sites, and the number of AP2β binding sites positively correlated with increasing inhibition, confirming negative regulation of VEGFR-2 transcription by AP2β (Fig. 2B). Next, to confirm the regulatory role of AP2 in expression VEGFR-2, we demonstrated that siRNA-mediated knockdown of AP2β enhanced VEGFR-2 expression (Fig. 3A). Conversely, overexpression of AP2β decreased VEGFR-2 protein expression (Fig. 3B). We also performed qPCR and confirmed that knockdown of AP2β increased but overexpression of AP2β decreased the mRNA levels of VEGFR-2 (Fig. 3C). Furthermore, immunohistochemistry was performed to examine the expression of VEGFR-2 in genomic AP-2β knockout mouse embryos. Increased VEGFR-2 protein expression was observed in the spinal cord of AP-2β knockout mice at embryonic day 13 compared with similarly aged WT control embryos (Fig. 3, D–G). These results suggest that endogenous AP-2β suppresses VEGFR-2 expression in vitro and in vivo. We hypothesized that PKDs could directly regulate AP2β function by serine phosphorylation at positions 258 and 277. Previous studies have suggested Ser258 as a phosphorylation site in AP2β using structural analysis (22Iwamoto N. Abe-Dohmae S. Lu R. Yokoyama S. Involvement of protein kinase D in phosphorylation and increase of DNA binding of activator protein 2α to downregulate ATP-binding cassette transporter A1.Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2008; 28 (18845787): 2282-228710.1161/ATVBAHA.108.174714Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). However, attempts to reliably detect serine phosphorylation of AP2β using phosphoserine-specific antibodies have proven challenging. Consequently, the effects of PKD1 and PKD2 on AP2β phosphorylation have not been examined. Therefore, to determine whether PKD1 is the upstream kinase for these sites, we performed Phos-tagTM assays with lysates from HEK293 cells that were cotransfected with vector, WT AP2β, or mutated AP2β-S258A or AP2β-S277A together with PKD1.CA or vector control. Expression of PKD1.CA led to a shift of WT AP2β, indicating its phosphorylation by PKD1. This was decreased when Ser258 or Ser277 were blunted by serine-to-alanine substitutions, identifying both as PKD1 phosphorylation sites (Fig. 4A). To further examine the effect of endogenous PKD on AP2β phosphorylation, we collected lysates of HUVECs, performed immunoprecipitation with an AP2β antibody, and probed the immunoprecipitates with a pMOTIF antibody that specifically recognizes PKD-phosphorylated substrates. Our results confirmed that endogenous PKD phosphorylates AP2β and that this phosphorylation is reduced when the pan-PKD inhibitor CRT is present in the medium (Fig. 4B). To define the functional consequence of PKD-mediated phosphorylation of AP2β, the cellular localization of AP2β was examined using a fusion protein, AP2β-GFP, in 293T cells. As shown in Fig. 4, C and D, administration of the pan-PKD inhibitor CRT significantly increased nuclear accumulation of AP2β. The effect of PKD1 on AP2β nuclear localization was further examined in 293T cells transfected with mCherry-PKD1 or mCherry-PKD1.CA (Fig. 4, E and F). In cells transfected with PKD1, mutation of either Ser258 or Ser277 increased AP2β nuclear accumulation, as shown by enriched GFP signals in nuclei. Notably, overexpression of PKD1.CA decreased the nuclear localization of WT AP2β but not AP2β with mutations. Similar results were observed in PKD2-overexpressing 293T cells (Fig. 4G and Fig. S1). In these experiments, substitution of both Ser258 and Ser277 did not significantly increase the nuclear localization of AP2β compared with single Ser258 or Ser277 substitution, suggesting that Ser258 and Ser277 play redundant roles in the AP2β nuclear localization. Nuclear protein was also collected from HUVECs stimulated with CRT and exhibited increased nuclear accumulation of AP2β (Fig. 4H). Overexpression of PKD1.CA in HUVECs was shown to decrease the nuclear AP2β protein level (Fig. 4I), suggesting that active PKD promotes cytoplasmic retention of AP2β. Correspondingly, AP2β with a Ser277 substitution showed significantly increased binding to the VEGFR-2 promoter (Fig. 4J). These results indicate that PKD-mediated phosphorylation of AP2β, especially Ser277, controls the nuclear localization and DNA binding of AP2β. In this study, we report that PKD regulates VEGFR-2 expression through AP2β in endothelial cells. It has been well-established that VEGF activity is controlled autonomously by its own expression levels through various circulating sequestering proteins and via VEGFR-2, its cognate tyrosine kinase receptor, predominantly responsible for transducing the angiogenic effects of VEGF (23Ferrara N. Gerber H.P. LeCouter J. The biology of VEGF and its receptors.Nat. Med. 2003; 9 (12778165): 669-67610.1038/nm0603-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (7822) Google Scholar). Several small-molecule VEGFR-2 inhibitors and VEGFR-2 monoclonal antibodies (24Javle M. Smyth E.C. Chau I. Ramucirumab: successfully targeting angiogenesis in gastric cancer.Clin. Cancer Res. 2014; 20 (25281695): 5875-588110.1158/1078-0432.CCR-14-1071Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) have been developed to therapeutically target tumor angiogenesis in cancer patients. Although VEGF is secreted by a variety of cell types, the expression of VEGFR-2 is mainly restricted to vascular endothelial cells. Here our results identify a novel mechanism through which PKD phosphorylates AP2β and regulates the cytoplasmic localization and DNA binding of AP2β to control transcription of VEGFR-2 in endothelial cells. Because of the important role of VEGFR-2 in endothelial cells, multiple mechanisms have been reported to control the expression of VEGFR-2. Although endocytosis of VEGFR-2 was originally thought to induce its degradation and down-regulation, recent studies have indicated that VEGFR-2 endocytosis and trafficking in endosomal compartments are essential for VEGF-stimulated extracellular signal-regulated kinase activation but not down-regulation of VEGFR-2 (25Simons M.

Thus, it is possible that AP2β may compete or interact with Sp1 to repress transcription of VEGFR-2.

AMOR_GH9A comprises a signal peptide, a catalytic domain and a CBM3 cellulose-binding module. AMOR_GH9A is an exceptionally stable enzyme with a temperature optimum around 100°C and an apparent melting temperature of 105°C. The novel cellulase retains 64% of its activity after 4 hours of incubation at 95°C. The closest characterized homolog of AMOR_GH9A is TfCel9A, a processive endocellulase from the model thermophilic bacterium Thermobifida fusca (64.2% sequence identity). Direct comparison of AMOR_GH9A and TfCel9A revealed that AMOR_GH9A possesses higher activity on soluble and amorphous substrates (phosphoric acid swollen cellulose, konjac glucomannan) and has an ability to hydrolyse xylan that is lacking in TfCel9A."
https://openalex.org/W2972112688,"The role of CD5 as a regulator of T cell signaling and tolerance is well recognized. Recent data show expression of CD5 on different subtypes of human dendritic cells, however its functional relevance in modulating DC mediated responses remains poorly understood. In this study, we show CD5 is expressed on CD11c+ DC from murine thymus, lymph node, spleen, skin and lung. Although the development of DC subpopulations in CD5-/- mice was normal, CD5-deficient DC produced significantly higher levels of IL-12 than wild type DC in response to LPS. CD5-/- DC, in comparison to CD5+/+ DC, enhanced the activation of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in vitro and in vivo and induced significantly higher production of IL-2 and IFN-gamma by T cells. Consequently, CD5-/- DC were significantly more potent than wild type DC in the induction of anti-tumor immunity and contact hypersensitivity responses in mice. Restoration of CD5 expression in CD5-/- DC reduced IL-12 production and inhibited their capacity to stimulate T cells. Collectively, these data demonstrate that the specific expression of CD5 on DC inhibits the production of inflammatory cytokines and has a regulatory effect on their activity to stimulate T cells and induce immune responses. This study reveals a previously unrecognized regulatory role for CD5 on DC and provides novel insights into mechanisms for DC biology in immune responses."
https://openalex.org/W2972233386,"There is considerable variation among studies that evaluate how amphibian populations respond to global climate change. We used 23 years of annual survey data to test whether changes in climate have caused predictable shifts in the phenology and population characteristics of adult spotted salamanders (Ambystoma maculatum) during spring breeding migrations. Although we observed year-to-year correlation between seasonal climate variables and salamander population characteristics, there have not been long-term, directional shifts in phenological or population characteristics. Warm winters consistently resulted in early migration dates, but across the 23-year study, there was no overall shift towards warmer winters and thus no advanced migration timing. Warm summers and low variability in summer temperatures were correlated with large salamander body sizes, yet an overall shift towards increasing body sizes was not observed despite rising summer temperatures during the study. This was likely due to the absence of long-term changes of within-year variation in summer temperatures, which was a stronger determinant of body size than summer temperature alone. Climate-induced shifts in population characteristics were thus not observed for this species as long-term changes in important seasonal climate variables were not observed during the 23-years of the study. Different amphibian populations will likely be more resilient to climate change impacts than others, and the probability of amphibians exhibiting long-term population changes will depend on how seasonal climate change interacts with a species’ life history, phenology, and geographic location. Linking a wide range of seasonal climatic conditions to species or population characteristics should thus improve our ability for explaining idiosyncratic responses of species to climate change."
https://openalex.org/W2972278952,"Understanding how cortical inhibition shapes circuit function requires identifying the connectivity rules relating the response properties of inhibitory interneurons and their postsynaptic targets. Here we explore the orientation tuning of layer 2/3 inhibitory inputs in the ferret visual cortex using a combination of in vivo axon imaging, functional input mapping, and physiology. Inhibitory boutons exhibit robust orientation-tuned responses with preferences that can differ significantly from the cortical column in which they reside. Inhibitory input fields measured with patterned optogenetic stimulation and intracellular recordings revealed that these inputs originate from a wide range of orientation domains, inconsistent with a model of co-tuned inhibition and excitation. Intracellular synaptic conductance measurements confirm that individual neurons can depart from a co-tuned regime. Our results argue against a simple rule for the arrangement of inhibitory inputs supplied by layer 2/3 circuits and suggest that heterogeneity in presynaptic inhibitory networks contributes to neural response properties."
https://openalex.org/W2972310138,"Object: It is increasingly popular to collect as much data as possible in the hospital setting from clinical monitors for research purposes. However, in this setup the data calibration issue is often not discussed and, rather, implicitly assumed, while the clinical monitors might not be designed for the data analysis purpose. We hypothesize that this calibration issue for a secondary analysis may become an important source of artifacts in patient monitor data. We test an off-the-shelf integrated photoplethysmography (PPG) and electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring device for its ability to yield a reliable pulse transit time (PTT) signal. Approach: This is a retrospective clinical study using two databases: one containing 35 subjects who underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy, another containing 22 subjects who underwent spontaneous breathing test in the intensive care unit. All data sets include recordings of PPG and ECG using a commonly deployed patient monitor. We calculated the PTT signal offline. Main Results: We report a novel constant oscillatory pattern in the PTT signal and identify this pattern as a sawtooth artifact. We apply an approach based on the de-shape method to visualize, quantify and validate this sawtooth artifact. Significance: The PPG and ECG signals not designed for the PTT evaluation may contain unwanted artifacts. The PTT signal should be calibrated before analysis to avoid erroneous interpretation of its physiological meaning."

Sequence analysis suggests that prion-like proteins are prevalent in various species; however, it remains unclear what functional space they occupy in multicellular organisms. Here, we report the identification of a prion-like protein, Herzog (CG5830), through a multimodal screen in Drosophila melanogaster. Herzog functions as a membrane-associated phosphatase and controls embryonic patterning, likely being involved in TGF-β/BMP and FGF/EGF signaling pathways. Remarkably, monomeric Herzog is enzymatically inactive and becomes active upon amyloid-like assembly. The prion-like domain of Herzog is necessary for both its assembly and membrane targeting. Removal of the prion-like domain impairs activity, while restoring assembly on the membrane using a heterologous prion-like domain and membrane-targeting motif can restore phosphatase activity.

Therefore, unlike kinases, it remains unclear how seemingly promiscuous phosphatases achieve substrate specificity or control activity both in time and space. A small-scale systematic screen of the Drosophila melanogaster proteome led to the identification of five potential prion-like proteins (Figure S1). One of these candidates, which we named Herzog (Hzg), is a functionally uncharacterized gene (CG5830), with homology to the haloacid dehalogenase (HAD) subfamily small CTD phosphatases (SCPs). We find that Hzg, a membrane-associated phosphatase, is a maternal effect gene required for proper establishment of segment polarity in the embryos. Hzg is expressed ubiquitously throughout embryonic development but changes from monomers to aggregates with features of amyloids during gastrulation, and this state change leads to a gain of phosphatase activity. The phosphatase activity requires both membrane localization and amyloid-like fibrillization through its N-terminal prion-like domain. Taken together, this study provides a definitive example of how a prion-like domain can control embryonic development by orchestrating phosphatase activity in space and time. We performed an in silico screen of Drosophila proteome for prion-like proteins using PLAAC, which looks for common sequence characteristics of known prion-like domains as described previously (Alberti et al., 2009Alberti S.

Therefore, we also analyzed the Drosophila proteome using the SEG and FoldIndex algorithms for LCS and ID domains, respectively (Prilusky et al., 2005Prilusky J. Felder C.E. Zeev-Ben-Mordehai T.

We picked proteins in the upper 90th percentile in all three groups (Figure S1B). Among these, we selected 15 candidates from distinct categories shown in Figure S1B and experimentally tested those for some of the common characteristics of prion-like proteins (Figures S1C–S1G). First, the aggregation propensity and biophysical properties of each candidate protein was assessed by expressing EGFP-tagged versions of each in S2 cells (Figure S1C) and quantifying the fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) of the whole punctum (Figure S1D). We observed a range of FRAP recovery dynamics, from rapid exchange with the monomeric pool to stable puncta with low recovery. Among 15 candidate proteins, 5 proteins, namely Hzg, Hr4E, CG42540, Pipsqueak (Psq), and Murashka (Mura), showed low FRAP recovery similar to Orb2A, a well-characterized prion-like protein in Drosophila (Cervantes et al., 2016Cervantes S.A.

Second, Hr4E, CG42540, Dorsal (Dl), Corto, and Hzg showed a positive Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) efficiency between yellow fluorescent protein (YFP)- and cyan fluorescent protein (CFP)-tagged versions of the same protein, suggesting homo-oligomerization into an orientation tightly packed enough for FRET to occur (Figure S1E). Third, in semi-denaturing detergent agarose gel electrophoresis (SDD-AGE), Hzg, Hr4E, and Psq showed SDS-resistant higher molecular-weight assembly that appear as smears on the western blot (Figure S1F). Fourth, secondary structure analysis of purified recombinant candidate proteins by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) showed that Hzg, Hr4E, Psq, and Mura have an absorption spectrum with a lower energy (1,620 cm−1) amide I′ band than native globular proteins with β sheets such as Concanavalin A (Figure S1G). This molecular feature is typical for amyloid fibrils and relates to dihedral angles and overall extended β sheet structure of these folds (Zandomeneghi et al., 2004Zandomeneghi G. Krebs M.R.H. McCammon M.G. Fändrich M. FTIR reveals structural differences between native β-sheet proteins and amyloid fibrils.Protein Sci. 2004; 13: 3314-3321Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). Altogether, Hzg, Hr4, Psq, CG42540, and Mura showed some of the characteristic features associated with prion-like proteins in multiple assays. Here, we have characterized the Hzg protein in greater detail to analyze the relationship, if any, between its prion-like domain, aggregation properties, and function. The hzg gene encodes a 329-amino acid (aa) protein with a HAD phosphatase motif (ψψψDXDX(T/V)ψψ) between residues 91 and 101 in the conserved FCP1 (F-cell production, also called TFIIF-stimulated CTD phosphatase) homology domain (83–243) (Figure 1A, bottom). Based on phenotype of hzg mutants (shown later in Figure 7), we monitored the Hzg protein during embryogenesis by tagging it at the C-terminal end with 3XHA or EGFP at the endogenous genomic locus using the CRISPR/Cas9-based gene-editing system (Figures 1A and S2A). Hzg-tagged embryos develop normally, suggesting that tagging did not alter the protein function. Immunostaining of hzg-HA embryos and immunogold electron microscopy of hzg-GFP embryos showed that Hzg is a membrane-associated protein (Figures S2B and S2D), with diffuse localization on the cell membrane between stages 1 and 5 (0–3 h after egg laying, AEL). Hzg transforms into visible foci on the membrane between stages 6 and 11 (3–7 h AEL) and the foci persist in later stages (stages 12–13, 13–15) of embryonic development (Figure 1B).Figure S2Expression and Localization of Hzg in Embryos, Related to Figure 1Show full caption(A) Protein expression of Hzg in 0-20 h old mutant hzgC91, wild type (Wt), and tagged embryos (hzg-HA and hzg-GFP).

Nu: Nucleus, Mito: Mitochondria and CM: Cell membrane. Scale bar: 1 μm. Live imaging of embryos (Figures 1C and S2C; Videos S1 and S2) showed that hzg-EGFP fluorescent puncta appear during gastrulation (stage 6, 3–3.5 h AEL). Tracking of individual puncta showed that, once formed, the puncta are stable at least on the minute timescale and move around on the membrane (Figure 1D; Video S3). To determine whether puncta move from cell to cell along the membrane or remain confined to the cell of origin, we bleached either half of one cell or multiple cells to monitor recovery within a cell and between cells. Membrane fluorescence recovers in approximately 3 min when half the cell is bleached; however, if more than a 3-cell diameter of the embryo is bleached, neither membrane puncta nor fluorescence recover in the inner cells in 30 min (Figure 1E; Videos S4 and S5). This indicates that, although the Hzg puncta move on the membrane, they are unable to cross cell-cell junctions and are locked in the cell in which they form. https://www.cell.com/cms/asset/d36cb5fd-1a82-4766-b373-e3dadf05a462/mmc3.mp4Loading ...

FRAP of Hzg-EGFP Embryos for 30 min, Related to Figure 1E2 To determine whether puncta formation associates with high-molecular-weight assembly, embryo lysates were prepared from different developmental stages in buffer-containing nonionic (0.1% Triton X-100 + 1% Nonidet-40) and ionic (0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate + 0.5% sodium deoxycholate) detergents to extract Hzg protein from the cell membrane and strip associated proteins (Figure 1F). Low- (supernatant) and high-molecular-weight (pellet) proteins were separated by centrifugation and analyzed in SDS-PAGE. While the Hzg protein is expressed in all stages, the amount of Hzg protein in high-molecular-weight pellet fraction started to increase 3–4 h AEL, coinciding with the transition from a diffuse to punctate state. Taken together, these results suggest that Hzg exists in two different states during embryonic development: low-molecular-weight monomers and high-molecular-weight aggregates, which appear after gastrulation.

https://openalex.org/W2971866866,"Breast cancer is the most frequently diagnosed cancer among women worldwide. Despite the fact that breast cancer is more frequent after fifty years of age, breast cancer among young women has recently drawn particular attention due to an increase in incidence in several western countries. With the exception of individuals with a high genetic risk, breast cancer occurring in younger women remains poorly understood. This project aims at investigating the patient, tumour and treatment characteristics as well as the long-term health outcomes of these women by evaluating numerous variables that were collected from their pathology and medical files, including the social environment, family history, fertility and pregnancy.We constituted a population-based cohort from the Geneva Cancer Registry of 1586 patients with breast cancer who were aged less than 46 years at the time of diagnosis.Breast cancer was diagnosed before the age of 35 years in 225 women (14.2%), between 35 and 39 years of age in 368 women (23.2%) and between 40 and 45 years of age in 993 women (62.6%). Most of the patients were diagnosed with luminal A or luminal B molecular subtypes (32.8 and 37.5%, respectively), stage I or II tumours (75.2%), and estrogen (74.8%) and progesterone (67.5%) positive receptors. During the study period, 16.7% of these women developed loco-regional recurrences and 25.4% developed distant metastases; the majority (66.3%) did not have a recurrence. Regarding mortality, 474 (29.9%) women died during the study period, 347 (73.2%) from breast cancer.The results of this study will help filling the knowledge gap about treatment of young breast cancer patients and having a child after breast cancer, and will provide clinicians and public health professionals' with additional information to improve quality of care and decrease the impact of breast cancer in young women."

PPIs between Hsp47 and collagen could offer a therapeutic target for fibrosis, which is characterized by abnormal collagen accumulation in the extracellular matrix of fibrotic organs. Herein, we established a bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) system for assessing Hsp47–collagen interaction dynamics within the ER. After optimization and validation of the method, we could demonstrate inhibition of the interaction between Hsp47 and collagen by a small molecule (Col003) in the ER. Using the BRET system, we also found that Hsp47 interacts not only with the Gly-Pro-Arg motif but also weakly with Gly-Pro-Hyp motifs of triple-helical collagen in cells. Moreover, we found that the serpin loop of Hsp47 (SerpinH1) contributes to its binding to collagen.

Our study aimed to provide the first population-based prevalence estimates and examine association with back and neck pain.We used data from the population-based Study of Health in Pomerania (SHIP). Whole-body MRI examinations (1.5 Tesla: T1, T2, and TIRM weightings) were available from 3,259 participants. Readings of the spinal MRI images were conducted according to a standardized protocol by a single reader (JS). The intra-rater reliability was greater than Kappa values of 0.98. Pain measures included the seven-day prevalence of spine pain and neck pain, and average spine pain intensity due to spine pain during the past three months.We found 1,200 (36.8%) participants with at least one osseous lesion (2,080 lesions in total). Osseous lesions were less common in men than in women (35.5% vs 38.9%; P = .06). The prevalence of osseous lesions was highest at L2 in both sexes. The prevalence of osseous lesions increased with age. Up to eight osseous lesions were observed in a single subject. Hemangioma (28%), and lipoma (13%) occurred most often. Sclerosis (1.7%), aneurysmal bone cysts (0.7%), and blastoma (0.3%) were rare. Different osseous lesions occurred more often in combination with each other. The association with back or neck pain was mostly negligible.Osseous lesions are common in the general population but of no clinical relevance for spinal pain. The prevalence of osseous lesions varied strongly across different regions of the spine and was also associated with age and gender. Our population-based data offer new insights and assist in judging the relevance of osseous lesions observed on MRIs of patients."
https://openalex.org/W2973144922,"In the last decade a growing HIV/AIDS epidemic with increased incidence and AIDS-related mortality has been reported in Northern Brazil from which molecular data are scarce. Also, apparently healthy, adult blood donors, recently diagnosed with HIV-1 represent important sentinel populations for molecular studies. This cross-sectional study describes HIV-1 subtypes in blood donors from three reference public blood centers located in three States in Northern Brazil. HIV-1 pol sequencing (protease/PR, reverse transcriptase/RT) was performed on plasma samples of HIV-1 positive donors from HEMOAM, Manaus, Amazonas (n = 198), HEMERON, Porto Velho, Rondônia (n = 20) and HEMORAIMA, Boa Vista, Roraima (n = 9) collected from 2011–2017. HIV-1 subtypes were identified by REGA, phylogenetic inference; recombinant viruses were characterized by SIMPLOT. Young, single, males predominated, around half was first-time donors. Syphilis co-infection was detected in 17% (39 out of 227), 8% (18 out of 227) was anti-HBc positive. Subtype B represented ≥ 90% in Amazonas, Rondônia and Roraima, subtype C (3.1%) was found in Amazonas and Rondônia; subtype F1 (0.9%) and BF1 recombinants (5.3%) were only detected in Amazonas. Subtype B sequences from Amazonas (n = 179), Rondônia (n = 18) and Roraima (n = 9) were combined with viral strains representative of the BPANDEMIC (n = 300) and BCARIBBEAN/BCAR (n = 200) lineages. The BPANDEMIC lineage predominated (78%) although BCAR lineages were frequent in Roraima (56%) and Amazonas (22%). Subtype C and subtype F1 sequences identified here clustered within Brazilian CBR and F1BR lineages, respectively. Twelve BF1 mosaics showed 11 different recombination profiles: six were singleton unique-recombinant-forms/URFs, one displays a CRF28/29_BF-like recombinant pattern and the remaining four BF1 isolates branched with other Brazilian BF1 viruses previously described and may represent putative new CRF_BF1 from Northern Brazil. Our study shows a highly homogeneous molecular pattern with prevalent subtype B, followed by BF1, and sporadic subtype C and F1 in blood donors from the Northern region. Surveillance studies are important to monitor HIV-1 diversity which can reveal patterns of viral dissemination, especially in a highly endemic, remote and geographically isolated region as Northern Brazil."
https://openalex.org/W2973226665,"Due to the fast speed of data generation and collection from advanced equipment, the amount of data obviously overflows the limit of available memory space and causes difficulties achieving high learning accuracy. Several methods based on discard-after-learn concept have been proposed. Some methods were designed to cope with a single incoming datum but some were designed for a chunk of incoming data. Although the results of these approaches are rather impressive, most of them are based on temporally adding more neurons to learn new incoming data without any neuron merging process which can obviously increase the computational time and space complexities. Only online versatile elliptic basis function (VEBF) introduced neuron merging to reduce the space-time complexity of learning only a single incoming datum. This paper proposed a method for further enhancing the capability of discard-after-learn concept for streaming data-chunk environment in terms of low computational time and neural space complexities. A set of recursive functions for computing the relevant parameters of a new neuron, based on statistical confidence interval, was introduced. The newly proposed method, named streaming chunk incremental learning (SCIL), increases the plasticity and the adaptabilty of the network structure according to the distribution of incoming data and their classes. When being compared to the others in incremental-like manner, based on 11 benchmarked data sets of 150 to 581,012 samples with attributes ranging from 4 to 1,558 formed as streaming data, the proposed SCIL gave better accuracy and time in most data sets."
https://openalex.org/W2971931116,"The Escherichia coli cAMP receptor protein, CRP, is a homodimeric global transcription activator that employs multiple mechanisms to modulate the expression of hundreds of genes. These mechanisms require different interfacial interactions among CRP, RNA, and DNA of varying sequences. The involvement of such a multiplicity of interfaces requires a tight control to ensure the desired phenotype. CRP-dependent promoters can be grouped into three classes. For decades scientists in the field have been puzzled over the differences in mechanisms between class I and II promoters. Using a new crystal structure, IR spectroscopy, and computational analysis, we defined the energy landscapes of WT and 14 mutated CRPs to determine how a homodimeric protein can distinguish nonpalindromic DNA sequences and facilitate communication between residues located in three different activation regions (AR) in CRP that are ∼30 A apart. We showed that each mutation imparts differential effects on stability among the subunits and domains in CRP. Consequently, the energetic landscapes of subunits and domains are different, and CRP is asymmetric. Hence, the same mutation can exert different effects on ARs in class I or II promoters. The effect of a mutation is transmitted through a network by long-distance communication not necessarily relying on physical contacts between adjacent residues. The mechanism is simply the sum of the consequences of modulating the synchrony of dynamic motions of residues at a distance, leading to differential effects on ARs in different subunits. The computational analysis is applicable to any system and potentially with predictive capability."
https://openalex.org/W2971580597,"The importance of the role of fibroblasts in cancer microenvironment is well-recognized. However, the relationship between fibroblasts and asbestos-induced lung cancer remains underexplored. To investigate the effect of the asbestos-related microenvironment on lung cancer progression, lung cancer cells (NCI-H358, Calu-3, and A549) were cultured in media derived from IMR-90 lung fibroblasts exposed to 50 mg/L asbestos (chrysotile, amosite, and crocidolite) for 24 h. The kinetics and migration of lung cancer cells in the presence of asbestos-exposed lung fibroblast media were monitored using a real-time cell analysis system. Proliferation and migration of A549 cells increased in the presence of media derived from asbestos-exposed lung fibroblasts than in the presence of media derived from normal lung fibroblasts. We observed no increase in proliferation and migration in lung cancer cells cultured in asbestos-exposed lung cancer cell medium. In contrast, increased proliferation and migration in lung cancer cells exposed to media from asbestos-exposed lung fibroblasts was observed for all types of asbestos. Media derived from lung fibroblasts exposed to other stressors, such as hydrogen peroxide and UV radiation didn't show as similar effect as asbestos exposure. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)-based cytokine array identified interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-8, which show pleiotropic regulatory effects on lung cancer cells, to be specifically produced in higher amounts by the three types of asbestos-exposed lung fibroblasts than normal lung fibroblasts. Thus, the present study demonstrated that interaction of lung fibroblasts with asbestos may support the growth and metastasis of lung cancer cells and that chrysotile exposure can lead to lung cancer similar to that caused by amphibole asbestos (amosite and crocidolite)."
https://openalex.org/W2972164333,"In this study we attempted to determine the effect of various feeding methods (bottom and surface feeding) used in the hatchery, on the survival and growth rates of hatchery-reared sea trout (Salmo trutta trutta L.) in the wild. Rearing was performed in two variants: a bottom-fed group (BFG) and a surface-fed group (SFG). At the end of the rearing time, we observed that BFG fish gathered at the bottom of tank, as opposed to SFG fish, which swam in the whole water column. After 4 weeks of rearing, the fish were released into two similar streams. After about 2 months the fish were captured and the foodbase of the streams were examined. 30 fish from each group have been randomly selected for stomach contents analysis. In the shallow stream the growth rates were better for the BFG fish than the SFG and also a significantly higher number of typical benthic taxa was found in stomachs of the BFG fish than the SFG fish. In the deeper stream more food was found in the stomachs of the SFG fish than in the BFG fish. The analyzed results showed that factors such as stream depth, current velocity, and turbulence can also affect the rearing success of juvenile salmonids in hatchery streams. Bottom feeding fish during rearing has a positive impact only on the fish in shallow watercourses, where there is no turbulence, and the food is not carried by the current drift or washed out from the bottom into the drift."
https://openalex.org/W2973110800,"This study investigated the effect of residual stenosis after carotid artery stenting (CAS) on periprocedural and long-term outcomes.Patients treated with CAS for symptomatic or asymptomatic carotid arterial stenosis were consecutively enrolled. Residual stenosis was estimated from post-procedure angiography findings. The effects of residual stenosis on 30-day periprocedural outcome and times to restenosis and clinical outcome were analyzed using logistic regression models and Wei-Lin-Weissfeld models, respectively.A total of 412 patients (age, 64.7 ± 17.0 years; male, 82.0%) were enrolled. The median baseline stenosis was 80% (interquartile range [IQR], 70-90%), which improved to 10% (0-30%) for residual stenosis. Residual stenosis was significantly associated with periprocedural outcome (adjusted odds ratio, 0.983; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.965-0.999, P = 0.01) after adjustment for baseline stenosis, age, hypertension, symptomaticity, and statin use. Over the 5-year observation period, residual stenosis did not increase the global hazard for restenosis and clinical outcome (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.011; 95% CI, 0.997-1.025. In the event-specific model, residual stenosis increased the hazard for restenosis (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.041; 1.012-1.072) but not for clinical outcome (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.011; 0.997-1.025).Residual stenosis after carotid artery stenting may be useful to predict periprocedural outcome and restenosis."
https://openalex.org/W2972660615,"The European Emission Trading System (EU ETS) is commonly regarded as the key pillar of the European climate policy and as the main unifying tool to create a unique carbon price all over Europe. The UK has always played a crucial role in the EU ETS, being one of the most active national registry and a crucial hub for the exchange of allowances in the market. Brexit, therefore, could deeply modify the number and directions of such exchanges as well as the centrality of the other countries in this system. To investigate these issues, the present paper exploits network analysis tools to compare the structure of the EU ETS market in its first two phases with and without the UK, investigating a few different scenarios that might emerge from a possible reallocation of the transactions that have involved UK partners. We find that without the UK the EU ETS network would become in general much more homogeneous, though results may change focusing on the type of accounts involved in the transactions."
https://openalex.org/W2971619578,"Non-invasive testing is recommended as a basis to decide about the indication for invasive coronary angiography (ICA) in patients with suspected stenotic coronary artery disease (CAD). However, a recent study based on insurance claims data reported that one third of patients undergoing ICA in Switzerland did not have non-invasive testing beforehand. We aimed to re-evaluate the practice of testing prior to ICA in Switzerland by manual review of patient histories.Retrospective analysis of all 816 consecutive patients (age 67±9 years, 70% males) undergoing elective ICA solely for the evaluation of stenotic CAD during the year 2015 in a single center in Eastern Switzerland. The proportion of patients undergoing a non-invasive test was assessed, and predictors of the lack of such a test were determined.764/816 (94%) patients had a non-invasive test prior to ICA. The majority of patients (728/816; 89%) had an exercise stress test, one fifth (160/816; 20%) underwent a test other than an exercise stress test (6% scintigraphy, 4% stress echocardiography, 6% stress magnetic resonance imaging, 4% computed tomography coronary angiography), and 122/816 (15%) patients had two tests. The use of antianginal drugs other than beta-blockers [odds ratio 1.92 (95% confidence interval 1.01-3.66); p = 0.047] and a lower left ventricular ejection fraction [odds ratio 0.97 (95% confidence interval 0.94-0.99) per one % point increase; p = 0.005] were independent predictors of the lack of a non-invasive test. ICA revealed stenotic CAD in 72% of patients, and 54% of patients underwent revascularization. Patients with and without non-invasive tests did not differ with respect to ICA findings and management.The present analysis suggests that patients are appropriately selected for ICA based on clinical judgement and non-invasive testing in Switzerland. There is no evidence for an overuse of ICA."
