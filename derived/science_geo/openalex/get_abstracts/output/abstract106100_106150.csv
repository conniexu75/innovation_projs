https://openalex.org/W1504989678,"Synergistic sites in the central cell-adhesive domain of fibronectin (FN) substantially enhance cell adhesion mediated by the alpha 5 beta 1 integrin receptor for fibronectin. We characterized a critical minimal sequence needed for synergistic activity using site-directed mutagenesis and homology scanning using intramolecular chimeras. The minimal cell-binding domain of FN consisting of the 9th and 10th type III FN repeat was expressed in an Escherichia coli expression system. This protein retained high biological activity when assayed using a competitive inhibition assay for FN-mediated adhesion of baby hamster kidney or HT-1080 cells. In contrast, a construct consisting of the 8th and 10th repeat displayed very low biological activity. By replacing various portions of the 8th repeat with homologous 9th repeat segments, we mapped the synergistic region to the center of the 9th repeat. When a very short peptide sequence, Pro-His-Ser-Arg-Asn (PHSRN), from the 9th repeat was substituted for the homologous pentapeptide site in the 8th repeat sequence, the recombinant protein showed markedly enhanced activity. Further mutagenesis analysis suggested that the arginine residue of this pentapeptide sequence is important for function. We also identified a weaker adjacent synergy region other than the PHSRN region. Epitope mapping of an anti-FN monoclonal antibody that inhibits FN-mediated adhesion identified the same critical regions. A synthetic peptide containing the PHSRN sequence showed neither competitive inhibitory activity in solution nor synergy with a soluble RGD-containing peptide. However, when the same synthetic peptide was positioned via a covalent bond at the corresponding site of the normally inactive 8th repeat, it mediated an enhancement of adhesive activity. These results identify a pentapeptide site that synergistically enhances the cell-adhesive activity of the FN RGD sequence."
https://openalex.org/W1559988816,"D-Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAP-DH) is a protein containing no disulfide bonds; the guanidine HCl-denatured enzyme shows only a limited extent of refolding and reactivation upon dilution, and the enzyme is particularly prone to aggregation during the dilution process. With increasing GAPDH concentration, reactivation decreases and aggregation increases. The presence of protein disulfide isomerase in the dilution mixture markedly increases reactivation of GAPDH and at the same time prevents the aggregation of GAPDH as shown by light-scattering measurements. It is suggested that upon dilution, denatured GAPDH is faced with two competing processes of correct folding and assembly to yield the native enzyme and non-productive association of the partially refolded species to form aggregates. Independent of the isomerase activity as no disulfide bond is present in GAPDH, protein disulfide isomerase assists the refolding of GAPDH to its active state by suppressing aggregation in a way closely similar to the action of chaperones."
https://openalex.org/W1484324228,"The synaptic vesicle membrane protein VAMP (vesicle-associated membrane protein or synaptobrevin) has been implicated in synaptic vesicle docking and fusion. Synaptophsin (p38), also a synaptic vesicle membrane protein, has four transmembrane domains and may function as a gap junction-like pore or channel. Here we report evidence for a direct interaction between VAMP and synaptophysin using chemical cross-linking followed by the identification of immunoreactive protein complexes. A prominent complex of 56 kDa was found to consist of VAMP and synaptophysin. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this VAMP-synaptophysin complex is enriched in the synaptic vesicle fraction of rat brain, is independent of detergent solubilization, and is present in PC12 cells subjected to in vivo cross-linking."
https://openalex.org/W1548401583,"This study demonstrates that the expression of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPAR alpha) is regulated by glucocorticoid hormones in hepatocytes. Hydrocortisone, dexamethasone, and triamcinolone stimulated PPAR alpha mRNA synthesis in a dose-dependent manner in primary rat hepatocyte cultures. This glucocorticoid stimulation was inhibited by RU 486, a specific glucocorticoid antagonist. Moreover, in contrast to glucocorticoid hormones, the mineralocorticoid aldosterone had only a weak effect, suggesting that the hormonal stimulation of PPAR alpha was mediated by the glucocorticoid receptor. The induction was not prevented by cycloheximide treatment of the hepatocytes, indicating that it was mediated by preexisting glucocorticoid receptor. Finally, the RNA synthesis inhibitor actinomycin D abolished the stimulatory effect of dexamethasone, and nuclear run-on analysis showed an increase of PPAR alpha transcripts after hormonal induction. Thus, the PPAR alpha gene is an early response gene of glucocorticoids that control its expression at the transcriptional level."
https://openalex.org/W136642420,"The ErbB3 protein is a member of the ErbB subfamily of receptor protein tyrosine kinases. In the present study, the mechanism by which the ErbB3 protein is phosphorylated and the signal-transducing functions of this phosphorylated protein were investigated. When phosphorylated by the epidermal growth factor receptor in vitro, the ErbB3 protein strongly associated with the regulatory p85 subunit and the catalytic activity of phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase. The association of PI 3-kinase with ErbB3 in human breast cancer cells was found to be correlated with the constitutive phosphorylation of ErbB3 on tyrosine residues. In MDA-MB-468 breast cancer cells in which the ErbB3 protein is not constitutively phosphorylated, stimulation with epidermal growth factor led to the phosphorylation of ErbB3 on tyrosine residues and the formation of a functional signal transduction complex involving the ErbB3 protein and PI 3-kinase. These results suggest that the ErbB3 protein can be phosphorylated on tyrosine residues by a cross-phosphorylation mechanism and that the phosphorylated ErbB3 protein can couple other growth factor receptor protein tyrosine kinases to the PI 3-kinase pathway in a manner similar to the insulin receptor substrate 1 protein."
https://openalex.org/W1598045648,"We report here the detailed analysis of the promoter of a thyroid hormone receptor (TR) gene that is regulated by the hormone itself. The receptor gene, TR beta A, is one of the two TR beta genes in Xenopus laevis. It has two transcription start sites. The mRNAs derived from one of them are up-regulated by thyroid hormone, whereas those derived from the other are independent of the hormone. We have characterized the hormone-inducible promoter using a transient transfection assay in a Xenopus tissue culture cell line (A6). Deletion and mutational analysis identifies the first amphibian thyroid hormone response element (TRE). This TRE consists of near perfect direct repeats of AGGTCA with a 4-base pair spacing similar to mammalian TREs. The TRE forms specific complexes with extracts of A6 cells that have similar sequence specificities as those found for the complexes between mammalian TRs and TREs. However, unlike TREs found in other thyroid hormone-inducible promoters, this TRE is located at the putative transcription start site and mediates transcriptional repression by unliganded TRs. The addition of thyroid hormone at physiological concentrations overcomes the repression and induces further transcriptional activation at higher concentrations. These results suggest a potential mechanism for the regulation of amphibian metamorphosis, a process that is entirely controlled by thyroid hormone."
https://openalex.org/W1583486645,"Exposure of endothelial cells (EC) to hypoxia results in the increased expression of a distinct set of proteins with molecular masses of 56, 47, 39, 36, and 34 kDa. Their induction appears to be unique to EC and the stress of decreased oxygen tension. To understand the mechanism(s) and significance of the up-regulation of these proteins we have identified the 36-kDa protein by limited amino-terminal amino acid sequencing. The 21-amino acid sequence from the bovine protein exhibited 90.5% identity with the human sequence of the glycolytic enzyme glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). Northern blot analysis showed that the time course and extent of EC GAPDH mRNA up-regulation correlated with the increase in 36-kDa protein synthesis. Nuclear runoff analysis demonstrated that this increase in GAPDH expression is regulated, in part, at the transcriptional level; however, the increase in the rate of transcription did not account for the entire mRNA accumulation, suggesting that GAPDH, like other hypoxia-regulated proteins, is posttranscriptionally regulated. Subcellular fractionation of hypoxic EC showed up-regulation of the 36-kDa protein in the cytoplasmic fraction and, to a lesser extent, in the nuclear fraction. The up-regulation of GAPDH in EC may be related to their relative hypoxia tolerance. Alternatively, the up-regulation of GAPDH in EC during hypoxia may be related to the potential nonglycolytic functions of this enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1529589512,"Platelet activating factor (PAF) interacts with cell surface receptors to mediate inflammatory responses. To determine the mechanisms of PAF receptor regulation, we constructed epitope-tagged human PAF receptor cDNA (ET-PAFR) and generated stable transfectants in a rat basophilic cell line (RBL-2H3 cells). The expressed receptors displayed ligand binding and functional properties similar to the native receptors in neutrophils. PAF-stimulated intracellular Ca2+ mobilization was not inhibited by pertussis toxin (PTx), whereas phosphoinositide hydrolysis and secretion were blocked by approximately 40%. The PTx-resistant secretion mediated by PAF was, however, inhibited by guanosine 5'-O-(2-thio-diphosphate) in permeabilized RBL-2H3 cells, indicating a role for PTx-insensitive G protein. In contrast to the PAF receptor, responses mediated by formylpeptide and C5a chemoattractants were inhibited by PTx. PAF stimulated a dose- and time-dependent phosphorylation of its receptor. ET-PAFR was also phosphorylated by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) and dibutyryl cyclic AMP. Staurosporine caused complete inhibition of ET-PAFR phosphorylation by PMA but only partial inhibition by PAF. Receptor phosphorylation by PAF and PMA correlated with desensitization as measured by a decrease in both PAF-stimulated GTPase activity in membranes and Ca2+ mobilization in intact cells. Phosphorylation of ET-PAFR by dibutyryl cyclic AMP was not, however, associated with desensitization. These data demonstrate that a single PAF receptor population interacts with multiple G proteins to mediate its biological responses. Moreover, ET-PAFR, unlike the formylpeptide or C5a receptors, is phosphorylated by at least three kinases (most likely protein kinases A and C and a receptor kinase). The functional consequences of cellular activation by various chemoattractants may depend upon the G protein to which their receptor is coupled."
https://openalex.org/W1543374674,"Greater than 90% of the endogenous thyroid hormone receptor proteins TR alpha and TR beta in tissues of Xenopus laevis comigrate with their respective in vitro synthesized counterparts, and these major components are not phosphorylated detectably. Maternally inherited TR alpha protein is stable through early embryogenesis during a time in which there is no detectable TR alpha mRNA synthesis. At stage 35 when TR alpha mRNA is first detectable, the inherited TR alpha protein is present at about 100 molecules/cell. TR alpha protein subsequently increases to levels of about 1500 and 6000 molecules/cell in tail and head regions, respectively, in stage 52 tadpoles. Even though TR alpha mRNA gradually increases during metamorphosis (from stage 52 to 62), TR alpha protein remains constant, suggesting strongly that post-transcriptional events control the ultimate levels of TR alpha protein. In contrast, there is no detectable TR beta protein (less than 100 molecules/cell) throughout embryogenesis until stage 52. Both TR beta mRNA and protein rise along with the increase in endogenous thyroid hormone, reaching a maximum at the climax of metamorphosis, when TR beta protein exceeds TR alpha protein in concentration. As with TR alpha protein, TR beta protein in tail is consistently about one-fourth that of TR beta protein in the head region. The number of TR alpha protein molecules in extracts of premetamorphic tadpoles and cultured cells grown in the absence of thyroid hormone fully accounts for all of the sites to which 125I-T3 bind. We interpret this to mean that TR alpha protein must be a necessary, if not sufficient, component in the pathway toward metamorphosis triggered by thyroid hormone and required for the phenomenon of competence in tissues and cells."
https://openalex.org/W1537641128,"To understand better the role of non-clathrin coat proteins in membrane traffic, we have cloned and characterized two essential genes encoding subunits of the yeast coatomer, SEC26 and SEC27. Sec26p is a 109-kDa protein that shares 43% sequence identity with mammalian beta-coat protein (beta-COP). Sec26p-depleted cells accumulate endoplasmic reticulum (ER) forms of secretory precursor proteins, and growth ceases after a dramatic accumulation of ER membranes. Sec26p overproduction partially suppresses sec27-1, a new mutant that shows a temperature-sensitive defect in ER-to-Golgi transport. The SEC27 gene was cloned, and the sequence predicts a 99.4-kDa protein with 45% sequence identity to mammalian beta'-COP. Our sequence data support a two-domain model for the SEC27 protein: a conserved amino-terminal domain, composed of five WD-40 repeats similar to those found in beta-subunits of trimeric G proteins, and a less conserved carboxyl-terminal domain. Genetic interactions connect sec27-1 and sec21-1 (coatomer gamma subunit) with the ARF1 and ARF2 genes and with the SEC22, BET1, and BOS1 genes, which encode membrane proteins involved in ER-to-Golgi transport."
https://openalex.org/W1491323285,"The relationship between angiotensin II-induced activation of G proteins and receptor internalization was analyzed by transiently expressing mutant and wild type cDNAs for the rat AT1a receptor in COS-7 cells. Pertussis toxin-sensitive G proteins did not appear to play a role in endocytosis since the receptor showed normal internalization kinetics in pertussis toxin-treated cells. Three deletion mutants of the third cytoplasmic loop revealed that the N-terminal part of this region is important for both receptor endocytosis and intracellular signaling. Three point mutations of Asp74, which has been implicated in signal transduction by the AT1a receptor, caused impaired G protein coupling and inositol phosphate responses. However, each of these mutants (D74N, D74H, and D74Y) showed markedly different internalization kinetics. The D74Y mutant showed the greatest impairment of internalization but retained the highest degree of inositol phosphate stimulation. In contrast, the D74N mutant, which showed the most impaired G protein coupling and inositol phosphate responses, had similar internalization kinetics to the wild type receptor. The combined mutant receptor containing the D74N substitution and deletion of residues 221-226 from the third cytoplasmic loop showed no G protein coupling or inositol phosphate response but was internalized about 60% as rapidly as the wild type receptor. These data demonstrate that endocytosis of the AT1 receptor is independent of agonist-activated signal transduction and indicate that receptor internalization and activation of phospholipase C have different structural requirements."
https://openalex.org/W1498140959,"The non-enzymatic deamidation at residues Asn-12 and Asn-38 of Escherichia coli phosphocarrier protein, HPr, and the repair of the resulting L-isoaspartyl (or beta-aspartyl) derivatives, HPr-1 and HPr-2, by recombinant human S-adenosylmethionine-dependent L-isoaspartate-(D-aspartate) O-methyltransferase (EC 2.1.1.77) were investigated. HPr is a component of the bacterial phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase system that is involved in the concomitant translocation and phosphorylation of many hexose sugars. The major products of the deamidation reaction, L-isoaspartyl (or beta-aspartyl) residues at positions 12 and 38, were found to be substrates for the L-isoaspartate-(D-aspartate) O-methyltransferase, an enzyme active on a wide variety of peptides and proteins containing these abnormal residues. This enzyme has been shown to catalyze the first step in a process that can convert L-isoaspartyl residues in peptides to normal L-aspartyl residues. The affinity of a recombinant human methyltransferase for HPr-1, a form deamidated at Asn-38, was relatively poor (Km = 3.6 mM), while a greater affinity was found for HPr-2, a form deamidated at both Asn-12 and Asn-38 (Km = 197 microM). When HPr-2 was incubated with S-adenosylmethionine and the methyltransferase, the bulk of the L-isoaspartyl residues at position 12 was converted to L-aspartyl residues. The major-by-product was the D-isoaspartyl form. The conversion of L-isoaspartyl residues at position 38 to L-aspartyl residues was less complete, reflecting the lower affinity of the methyltransferase for this site. The phosphohydrolysis activity of the repaired form was found to be midway between the form containing only L-aspartyl residues at positions 12 and 38 and the deamidated HPr-2 form."
https://openalex.org/W1563617960,"The role of RCC1-Ran/TC4 in nuclear protein import was examined in living cells using a temperature-sensitive RCC1 mutant cell line, tsBN2, and tsBN2 transformed with a RCC1 cDNA lacking the nuclear localization sequence domain, delta 8-29. Substrate, containing a small number of SV40 T antigen nuclear localization sequence peptides, injected into the cytoplasm of tsBN2 cells cultured at the non-permissive temperature of 39.5 degrees C did not accumulate efficiently in the nucleus. When the same substrate was injected into the cytoplasm of heterokaryons of tsBN2 and wild type BHK21 cells, import efficiency into the tsBN2 nuclei was not restored. Import into the BHK21 nuclei gradually decreased after fusion. In contrast, import efficiency into tsBN2 nuclei gradually recovered after fusion with tsBN2 cells transformed with delta 8-29 in which functional RCC1 was diffusely distributed in both the nuclei and cytoplasm. Substrate did not accumulate in the nuclei of digitonin-permeabilized tsBN2 cells cultured at 39.5 degrees C even in the presence of normal cytosol. These results suggest that loss of RCC1 function leads to the decline of import competence of the nucleus and accumulation of a factor in the cytoplasm that suppresses nuclear import. These results indicate that the RCC1-Ran/TC4 system may regulate nuclear import."
https://openalex.org/W1578009317,"Messenger RNA for thyroid hormone receptor (TR) isoforms alpha 1 and beta 1 are widely distributed in rat tissues. Until recently, TR beta 2 mRNA was believed to be limited to the pituitary and the assumption was made that TR beta 2 protein was similarly restricted. We determined the distribution of TR beta 2 protein in selected adult and fetal rat tissues using three anti-TR beta 2 antisera directed to different amino acid sequences of the distinctive A/B domain of TR beta 2. The proportion of total nuclear binding capacity cleared by each antiserum was determined by saturation analysis. 10-20% of total binding capacity in adult brain, liver, kidney, and heart was immunoprecipitated by each antiserum. Use of specific antibodies to TR beta 1 and TR alpha 1 showed these isoforms accounted for the remainder of total T3 binding. Fetal liver and brain, however, contained only TR alpha 1. Immunohistochemical analysis of the adult tissues showed TR beta 2 present in nuclei. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction detected low levels of TR beta 2 mRNA in the adult tissues. We infer that TR beta 2 accounts for a significant fraction of TR in adult rat tissues despite the low levels of its mRNA."
https://openalex.org/W130778363,"Adenosine receptor (AR) agonists and antagonists are approximately 100-fold and 100,000-fold, respectively, more potent at the bovine A1AR as compared to the rat A3AR. To determine regions of ARs involved in ligand recognition, chimeric receptors composed of bovine A1AR and rat A3AR sequence were constructed and their ligand binding properties examined following expression in COS-7 cells. Substitutions of the second extracellular loop or a region encompassing transmembrane domains 6 and 7 of the A1AR into the A3AR resulted in enhanced affinities of both agonists and antagonists compared to wild-type A3AR. The region of the second extracellular loop of the A1AR responsible for this effect was identified as the distal eleven amino acids of the loop. Replacement of this segment of the A3AR with that of the A1AR in combination with the regions encompassing transmembrane domains 6 and 7 resulted in a 50,000-fold increase in the Kd for antagonist radioligand, [3H]1,3-dipropyl-8- cyclopentylxanthine. Agonist affinity at this chimeric was over 100-fold greater than that displayed by wild-type A3AR. Thus, multiple regions of ARs including a segment of the second extracellular loop are involved in ligand recognition, and considerable overlap exists in structural features required for agonist and antagonist binding."
https://openalex.org/W1605575463,"While the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway coupled to receptor tyrosine kinases has been largely clarified, little is known about MAPK activation mediated by heterotrimeric G protein-coupled receptors. In a previous study, it has been shown that endothelin-1 (ET-1) signaling through heterotrimeric G protein-coupled receptors stimulates MAPK activity in primary cultures of astrocytes (Cazaubon, S., Parker, P. J., Strosberg, A.D., and Couraud, P.O. (1993) Biochem. J. 293, 381-386). To clarify the molecular mechanism responsible for this response, involvement of the adapter proteins, Shc and Grb2, has now been investigated. It is shown here that in these cells, ET-1 stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc, resulting in its stable association with Grb2 but not with Grb3-3, a Grb2 isoform with partially deleted SH2 domain. These results demonstrate that tyrosine-phosphorylated Shc specifically interacts with the SH2 domain of Grb2. This response was rapid and transient, showing a maximum at 10 min and declining at 60 min. Interestingly, direct activation of G proteins by fluoroaluminate mimics the ET-1 effect. In addition, a shift to a higher apparent molecular mass of Raf-1 kinase, likely reflecting its hyperphosphorylation, was also detected in ET-1-treated cells. These data strongly suggest that ET-1-induced MAPK activation is a G protein-coupled pathway that involves Shc, Grb2, and probably Raf-1. In conclusion, the Shc-Grb2 complex may be involved in the activation of the MAPK pathway, not only by several receptor tyrosine kinases but also by heterotrimeric G protein-coupled receptors, such as ET-1 receptors."
https://openalex.org/W1594886649,"Atherosclerotic lesions have a lipid core containing crystals and liposomes enriched in unesterified cholesterol as well as numerous monocyte-macrophages enriched in cholesteryl ester. Sufficient amounts of plasma-derived high density lipoproteins (HDL) may not reach and efficiently remove the cholesterol deposited in lesion macrophages or in the lipid core of lesions. We examined the potential of human monocyte-macrophages to produce nascent HDL and to solubilize cholesterol derived from interaction of monocyte-macrophages with lipoprotein and non-lipoprotein sources of cholesterol. Monocyte-macrophages produced discoidal (25 +/- 6 nm long and 6 +/- 1 nm wide (mean +/- S.D.)) and vesicular (89 +/- 41 nm in diameter) lipoprotein particles following and during enrichment of macrophages with cholesterol from acetylated low density lipoprotein (AcLDL) or cholesterol crystals. During cholesterol enrichment, discoidal particles progressively accumulated in the medium for up to 6 days. In contrast, vesicles did not increase past 2 days of incubation. Both the discoidal and vesicular lipoprotein particles had a peak density of about 1.09-1.10 g/ml. The discoidal particles contained apolipoprotein E (apoE), whereas the vesicles contained a major protein constituent with a molecular mass of 22,000 daltons. The vesicles did not contain detectable apoE and the 22,000-dalton protein was not the 22,000-dalton thrombolytic fragment of apoE. Following cholesterol enrichment of macrophages with AcLDL or cholesterol crystals, macrophages excreted much of their accumulated cholesterol, even in the absence of exogenously added cholesterol acceptors. Most of this excreted cholesterol was recovered from the culture medium and was carried in the apoE discoidal particles that showed cholesterol enrichment up to a 2:1 unesterified cholesterol to phospholipid molar ratio. The findings suggest that sufficient production of these nascent HDL by macrophages within atherosclerotic lesions should facilitate removal of cellular and extracellular cholesterol, even in the absence of plasma-derived HDL."
https://openalex.org/W1671005900,"Vaccinia virus mRNA capping enzyme, a heterodimer of virus-encoded D1 and D12 subunits, catalyzes three steps in the synthesis of the m7GpppN cap. By expressing portions of the subunits in bacteria, singly and together, we have localized the RNA (guanine-7) methyltransferase domain to a 305-amino acid carboxyl-terminal segment of the D1 polypeptide (residues 540-844) complexed with the D12 protein. We find that the purified carboxyl D1 protein has a weak intrinsic methyltransferase activity, indicating that the catalytic center resides within this subunit. The basal level of activity can be stimulated 100-fold by addition of purified D12 protein, which is itself catalytically inert. The carboxyl region of D1 forms a heterodimer with the D12 subunit in vivo and in vitro. Analysis of alanine substitution mutants of the D1 protein identifies amino acid residues important for subunit interaction. Our results suggest that subunit heterodimerization is necessary, but not sufficient, for full methyltransferase activity. A mutation of vicinal positions His-682-Tyr-683 that specifically affects catalytic activity but not subunit interaction implicates these residues as constituents of the active site."
https://openalex.org/W1493318679,"Mitochondrial processing peptidase (MPP) specifically recognizes a large variety of mitochondrial precursor proteins and correctly cleaves off the extension peptides. To determine the structure common to all the extension peptides that is required for specific recognition by MPP, we synthesized various oligopeptides of different chain lengths and amino acid sequences, based on the amino acid sequence of the extension peptide of pre-malate dehydrogenase, and determined kinetic parameters of the cleavage reactions. The minimal length of peptides for effective cleavage was 16 amino acid residues consisting of 11 and 5 residues from the cleavage site to the amino- and carboxyl-terminal sides, respectively. Two sets of basic amino acids in the peptide, the distal arginine residue at position -10 and the proximal ones at positions -3 and -2 relative to the cleavage site, were necessary for effective hydrolysis. Of these two, the residue at position -2 was more important for effective cleavage than the one at position -3 and could not be replaced by a lysine residue. The replacement of the distal arginine by lysine had no effect on the cleavage. Our study demonstrates that use of peptides with the proper length is essential for performing kinetic analyses on the cleavage reaction by MPP and that an arginine residue at position -2 to the cleavage site is necessary for the recognition and cleavage of the extension peptide."
https://openalex.org/W1504780399,"Human cell lines express two genetically distinct isoforms of DNA topoisomerase (topo II) II: topo II alpha (p170) and topo II beta (p180). We detected a higher molecular weight form with an apparent molecular mass of about 190 kDa in M phase-arrested HeLa cells (Kimura, K., Saijo, M., Ui, M., and Enomoto, T. (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 1173-1176). In this study we confirmed, using anti-topo II alpha and topo II beta monoclonal antibodies, that this higher molecular weight form is topo II beta and consists of doublet bands around 190 kDa. We confirmed that the doublet bands constituted an M phase-specific phenomenon and were not an artifact of the procedure used to accumulate mitotic cells. Digesting the immunoprecipitated materials from mitotic cell extracts with alkaline phosphatase resulted in the disappearance of the doublet bands and the appearance of the 180-kDa band with the concomitant disappearance of 32P label in the region of the doublet bands. Neither heat-inactivated alkaline phosphatase nor phosphodiesterase affected the doublet bands and the 32P label. Topo II beta in interphase cells was also phosphorylated, but the shift in apparent molecular weight was very slight after alkaline phosphatase digestion. Analysis of the labeled phosphoamino acids present in topo II beta from M phase and logarithmically growing cells indicated that phosphorylation occurred mainly on serine and fairly on threonine residues in both topo II beta isoforms. These results indicated that topo II beta is phosphorylated at specific sites in M phase, resulting in the formation of the doublet bands."
https://openalex.org/W1505369828,"Abstract Stimulation of cells with Ca(2+)-mobilizing hormones often leads to the generation of temporally and spatially complex changes in the intracellular Ca2+ ion concentration ([Ca2+]i). To understand the mechanisms regulating Ca2+ release from intracellular stores more clearly, we investigated the ability of histamine to release Ca2+ stores under different experimental conditions, using video imaging of single Fura-2-loaded HeLa cells. In Ca(2+)-free medium, stepwise increases in histamine concentration released an increasing proportion of the intracellular Ca2+ pool. This pattern of Ca2+ release is analogous to the release of Ca2+ previously observed using permeabilized cells. Quantal Ca2+ release was observed at both 20 and 37 degrees C and was not due to inactivation or desensitization of the Ca2+ release mechanism, since application of histamine in a pulsatile manner, which avoided desensitization of the Ca(2+)-release mechanism, still produced a quantal response. In Ca(2+)-containing medium at both 20 and 37 degrees C, stepwise increases in histamine concentration evoked [Ca2+]i responses where the amplitude was smoothly graded in direct proportion to the histamine concentration. Similar smoothly graded responses were observed from HeLa cells in Ca(2+)-free medium. These data indicate that hormone-evoked Ca2+ release from intracellular stores is limited by the hormone concentration, and that the mechanisms underlying complex [Ca2+]i signals do not lead to an all-or-none release of Ca2+ from the entire intracellular Ca2+ pool. We suggest that the hormone-sensitive intracellular Ca2+ pool is composed of functionally discrete units that are recruited by agonists in a concentration-dependent manner."
https://openalex.org/W1590606509,"Previously pp60v-src, cyclin A, p39mos, and maturation-promoting factor (composed of Cdc2 and cyclin B) have been shown to activate mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and MAPK kinase (MEK) in cell-free extracts of Xenopus oocytes. The pp60v-src pathway is dependent on a functional Ras signal whereas the cyclin/maturation-promoting factor pathway is not. Here we show that protein kinase C (PKC) is also able to stimulate MAPK in a Ras-dependent manner, but PKC is not necessary for signaling by pp60v-src. In addition, preincubation of extracts with cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) blocks stimulation of MAPK by cyclin, p21V12ras, PKC, or pp60v-src, by at least 50%, but stimulation by c-Mos is unaffected. Furthermore, inhibition of endogenous PKA by the heat-stable PKA inhibitor is sufficient to stimulate MAPK activity in these extracts in the absence of protein synthesis and without dependence on a functional Ras protein. These results suggest that independent pp60v-src and PKC pathways converge at Ras and that PKA acts to block MAPK activation by both Ras-dependent and -independent signals."
https://openalex.org/W1535332154,"Effects of phenylalanine and di- and tetrahydropterins on presteady-state and steady-state catalytic behavior of rat liver phenylalanine hydroxylase are analyzed. From this and previous work (Shiman, R, Xia, T., Hill, M., and Gray, D.(1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 24647-24656), which analyzed binding of the same compounds to the enzyme in the absence of catalysis, a model of phenylalanine hydroxylase regulation is proposed. The mechanism appears novel in that 1) one substrate, phenylalanine, is a positive effector (activator), 2) a second substrate, (6R)-tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4), is a negative effector that blocks phenylalanine activation by forming an inactive BH4.enzyme complex, and 3) the BH4.enzyme complex sequesters BH4 and controls its metabolic availability. Reaction progress curves showing regulatory effects of BH4, 7,8-dihydrobiopterin (BH2), and phenylalanine are fit by the model with high precision. Data are presented that the high affinity pterin-binding site on unactivated phenylalanine hydroxylase is the pterin site that regulates catalysis. Occupancy of this site by BH4 or BH2 causes non-cooperative, linear inhibition of phenylalanine activation of the enzyme. All inhibitory effects of BH4 appear due to its binding at the pterin regulatory site on unactivated enzyme. BH2 inhibits by binding at the active site as well as the pterin regulatory site. 6-Methyltetrahydropterin also appears to bind at the pterin regulatory site, but its effect is only seen at high phenylalanine concentrations. Using kinetic constants measured in this and earlier work, quantitative effects of phenylalanine and BH4 regulation on the rate of the phenylalanine hydroxylase reaction in vitro and in vivo are calculated. The effects of formation of the BH4.enzyme complex on free BH4 concentration, on enzyme activity, and on regulation of the rate of phenylalanine hydroxylation in liver are discussed."

Vectors containing the full coding sequence as well as two different NH2-terminal truncated genes expressed enzymatically active protein in Escherichia coli. The carbonic anhydrase V produced by a vector containing the full coding sequence, which includes a possible NH2-terminal mitochondrial targeting signal, was proteolytically processed by E. coli and contained several amino-terminal ends. The two NH2-terminal truncated vectors deleted, respectively, 1) the 29-amino acid putative targeting sequence and 2) 51 amino acids, yielding a protein equivalent to a carbonic anhydrase (CA) V isolated from mouse liver mitochondria; and both vectors produced homogeneous protein fractions. These latter two forms of CA V had identical steady-state constants for the hydration of CO2, with maximal values of kcat/Km at 3 x 10(7) M-1 s-1 and kcat at 3 x 10(5) s-1 with an apparent pKa for catalysis of 7.4 determined from kcat/Km. In catalytic properties, mouse CA V is closest to CA I; however, in inhibition by acetazolamide, ethoxzolamide, and cyanate, CA V is very similar to CA II. Mouse CA V has a tyrosine at position 64, where the highly active isozyme II has histidine serving as a proton shuttle in the catalytic pathway. Investigation of a site-specific mutant of CA V containing the replacement Tyr64–>His showed that the unique kinetic properties of CA V are not due to the presence of tyrosine at position 64."
https://openalex.org/W1600918361,"Neurotransmitter release from presynaptic nerve terminals is a highly regulated form of exocytosis. Small GTP-binding proteins of the Rab family have been proposed to act as central regulators in this process that cycle between a GTP- and GDP-bound form. Previous work has shown that the synaptic vesicle protein Rab3A undergoes a membrane association-dissociation cycle that is associated with neurotransmitter release. Using isolated nerve terminals as our model system, we have now analyzed the GDP/GTP status of Rab3A. Synaptic vesicle-bound Rab3A was almost exclusively in the GTP form whereas cytosolic Rab3A contained only GDP. Approximately equal amounts of GTP and GDP were found in the pool of Rab3A localized to a membrane fraction containing plasma membrane-synaptic vesicle complexes. In contrast to Rab3A, Rab5 (an endosomal G-protein) was predominantly GDP-bound in all analyzed compartments. To analyze whether Rab3A-bound GTP is cleaved during exocytosis, synaptosomes were stimulated with alpha-latrotoxin, the active component of black widow spider venom. This resulted in massive exocytosis. A significant increase of the GDP/GTP ratio of Rab3A was observed under these conditions that was not due to a nonspecific loss of high energy nucleotides. Our findings suggest that cleavage of Rab3A-bound GTP is a crucial step in regulated exocytosis of synaptic vesicles."
https://openalex.org/W1490838779,"Angiotensin II (AII) receptors are known to interact with two distinct guanine nucleotide binding proteins, Gq/11 and Gi, in rat adrenal glomerulosa cells to activate phospholipase C and to inhibit adenylate cyclase, respectively. However, in cultured bovine glomerulosa cells AII potentiates rather than inhibits the stimulatory effect of adrenocorticotropin (ACTH) on cAMP levels. This effect of AII was partially mimicked by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) and was partially inhibited by staurosporine or depletion of protein kinase C but was unaffected by pertussis toxin treatment. No potentiation was detectable in disrupted cells or in membrane preparations. In intact glomerulosa cells, treatment with cyclosporin A or FK506 completely inhibited AII- or PMA-induced potentiation of cAMP production without affecting the response to ACTH. In COS-7 cells transfected with the rat AT1 receptor, AII caused 2-3-fold enhancement of the ACTH-induced cAMP response, an effect that was partially reproduced by PMA. These potentiating actions of AII and PMA were prevented by preincubation with cyclosporin A or FK506, and the latter effect was abolished by rapamycin. These results implicate the Ca2+- and calmodulin-dependent protein phosphatase, calcineurin, in AII-induced enhancement of adenylate cyclase activity in both adrenal glomerulosa and transfected COS-7 cells. The finding that AII enhances ACTH-stimulated production of cAMP by a second messenger-mediated mechanism that involves the participation of calcineurin reveals an additional mode of cross-talk between pathways activated by Ca(2+)-mobilizing and cAMP-generating receptors."
https://openalex.org/W1557904327,"The insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE) and the multicatalytic proteinase (MCP) can be isolated as components of a cytosolic proteolytic complex. IDE is the primary enzyme involved in cellular degradation of insulin, and insulin has been shown to interact with cytosolic IDE. MCP is believed to be important in non-ubiquitin pathways of cellular protein degradation. Insulin has a dose- and time-dependent inhibitory effect on MCP degradation of N-succinyl-Leu-Leu-Val-Tyr 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin (LLVY), a substrate for MCP. Proinsulin also inhibits LLVY degradation in a dose-dependent manner. The effect of insulin is immediate as measured in a continuously monitored assay of LLVY degradation. Purification of the IDE-MCP complex using a variety of approaches, including affinity and conventional chromatography, retains the insulin effect on LLVY degradation as long as the complex remains intact. After ion-exchange chromatography, which separates IDE and MCP, insulin no longer has an inhibitory effect. Recombination of purified IDE and MCP does not restore the effect of insulin, but inclusion of additional components from the ion-exchange column does. These results support the existence of a functional cytosolic complex that contains IDE and MCP. Insulin interacts with IDE and alters the activity of MCP, suggesting a functional relationship between these two components and a mechanism for an intracellular action of insulin."
https://openalex.org/W1603972961,"Recently, we documented that a significant amount of nuclear casein kinase 2 (CK2) (a ubiquitous multipotential messenger-independent serine/threonine protein kinase) is associated with the nuclear matrix (NM), where it may be involved in the phosphorylation of several intrinsic proteins (Tawfic, S., and Ahmed, K. (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 7489-7493). Both CK2 and NM have been implicated in cell growth and proliferation. To examine whether CK2 in the NM was regulated in relation to a growth stimulus, we employed androgen action in the prostate as a model of growth control. In rats, androgen deprivation leads to a differential loss of CK2 activity and protein from the NM fraction in the prostate. At 24 h after androgen deprivation, the NM-associated CK2 activity as well as immunoreactive protein decline by about 80%. By comparison, total nuclear CK2 activity decreased by only 37%. Androgen administration to the castrated rats evokes a rapid differential increase in CK2 activity in the NM, so that within 1 h following the androgenic stimulus, the CK2 activity increases by 110% in the NM fraction versus 45% in the total nuclei. We propose that the stimulus-mediated differential translocation of CK2 to NM may play a role in the transduction of growth signal."
https://openalex.org/W1597931865,"We examined the structural characteristics of the extension peptides responsible for the recognition by the mitochondrial processing peptidase by using preadrenodoxin, which has a long extension peptide of 58 amino acid residues, as the substrate. The deletion of various parts of the extension peptide of pre-adrenodoxin indicated that more than 40 amino acid residues and the presence of basic amino acid residues in the distal portion (20-40 amino acid residues upstream of the cleavage site) were necessary for the recognition of the precursor by the peptidase. The processing of preadrenodoxin was strongly inhibited by the synthetic peptide corresponding to the middle portion of the extension peptide, whereas the peptide corresponding to the amino-terminal portion exhibited weak inhibition of the processing. The replacement of arginine residues in the middle portion of the extension peptide with neutral amino acids resulted in a great decrease in the processing. We conclude that basic amino acids at a position distal to the cleavage site are necessary for the recognition of the precursor proteins by the processing peptidase and that basic amino acids required for the mitochondrial targeting and those for the recognition by the peptidase are separately located in the extension peptide of pre-adrenodoxin."
https://openalex.org/W1487907530,"The expression of rat liver phosphatidylethanolamine N-methyltransferase-2 (PEMT2) in McA-RH7777 rat hepatoma cells resulted in the unexpected inhibition of cell growth. There was a strict correlation (r = 0.973) between the level of expression of the enzyme activity and the generation time for hepatoma cell division. Expression of other foreign proteins via the same vector did not inhibit McA-RH7777 cell growth; thus, retardation of cell division was specific for the methyltransferase. Addition of 1 microM 3-deazaadenosine, which causes inhibition of phosphatidylethanolamine methylation, reversed the PEMT2-mediated inhibition of cell division. Transfection of a line of Chinese hamster ovary cells with PEMT2 had no effect on the division of these cells. Induction of hepatic tumors in rats with N-nitrosodiethylamine coincided with a striking decrease in methyltransferase activity and immunoreactive protein in the tumor nodules. Thus, data from studies in cell culture and intact rats suggest a regulatory role for PEMT2 in hepatocyte cell growth and possibly in the development of liver cancer."
https://openalex.org/W1535572529,"Activation by phenylalanine and reduction by the co-factor (6R)-tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) are required for formation of active liver phenylalanine hydroxylase. This work describes effects of the activation and redox state on substrate and effector recognition of this enzyme, it establishes relationships among the pterin and phenylalanine binding sites on the different forms of the enzyme, and it provides a quantitative description of the enzyme's presumptive regulatory and catalytic sites. BH4, 7,8-dihydrobiopterin (BH2), 6-methyltetrahydropterin, and 5-deaza-6-methyltetrahydropterin were found to bind to unactivated phenylalanine hydroxylase with a stoichiometry of 1/enzyme subunit and with hyperbolic kinetics; all appear to compete for the same binding site on the enzyme, and all appear to bind in the proximity of, but not to, the enzyme's non-heme iron. In the transition from unactivated to activated enzyme, phenylalanine and pterin binding is modified, a new site for phenylalanine is formed, and the pterin site is replaced by a site of greatly decreased affinity for BH4 and BH2, one which does not appear to recognize the dihydroxypropyl side chain of BH4 and BH2. The pterin- and phenylalanine-binding sites on activated phenylalanine hydroxylase appear to be part of the enzyme's active site. Despite large effects on substrate binding, neither chelator binding ability nor solvent accessibility of the iron are affected by activation; activation appears to affect the nearby environment of the enzyme's iron but not the iron itself. Studies of oxidized and reduced phenylalanine hydroxylase indicate that the redox state is not a major determinant of pterin and phenylalanine association with enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1528529894,"We have previously reported that C-reactive protein (CRP) is normally synthesized by rabbit hepatocytes at relatively low rates and is retained in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), apparently by specific interaction with a 60-kDa lumenal ER protein. During the acute phase response to tissue injury, a marked increase in CRP synthesis is associated with a decrease in the CRP binding capacity of the 60-kDa protein, with accompanying rapid secretion of CRP. In the present studies, we purified two 60-kDa ER lumenal glycoproteins (referred to as gp60a and gp60b) capable of binding CRP. gp60b, though present at only 5% the level of gp60a, was found to account for 80% of the total CRP binding capacity. Amino-terminal amino acid sequence analysis and biochemical characterization identified gp60a and gp60b as two microsomal carboxylesterases previously reported by others to contain COOH-terminal ER retention signals (HIEL and HTEL). The CRP binding activities of gp60a and gp60b were found to be independent of their esterase activities. In animals undergoing the acute phase response, the levels of gp60a and gp60b were diminished by about 50%, but the CRP binding capacities were reduced by 4-6-fold for gp60a and 25-30-fold for gp60b. These findings indicate that CRP is normally retained within the ER via interaction with gp60a and gp60b, while during the acute phase response a decrease in the CRP binding affinity of these proteins, particularly gp60b, results in efficient secretion of CRP."
https://openalex.org/W1550695871,"Deletion of both thioredoxin genes TRX1 and TRX2 of Saccharomyces cerevisiae reduces the rate of DNA replication. This observation, originally determined by flow cytometry, was confirmed by radiochemical labeling of synchronized cultures. Since thioredoxin is a hydrogen donor to ribonucleotide reductase, a priori the inhibition of DNA synthesis was predicted to be caused by a reduction in the deoxyribonucleotide pools. However, the levels of TTP, dCTP, dATP, and dGTP were either unchanged or slightly greater in the thioredoxin mutant (3.2, 0.91, 1.4, and 1.21 pmol/10(6) cells, respectively) versus the wild-type culture (2.5, 0.91, 1.0, and 0.68 pmol/10(6) cells, respectively). An impact on ribonucleotide reduction was seen by an increased accumulation of RNR1 and RNR2 transcripts in the thioredoxin mutant (4.3- and 6.8-fold, respectively). Increased RNR expression did not reflect a general response of the DNA replication machinery. POL1 (DNA polymerase I) and CDC8 (thymidylate kinase) transcription were unaltered, while histone H2B transcripts actually decreased by half. Two alternative models incorporating these results are discussed. One suggests that thioredoxin reduces a multiprotein complex channeling nucleotides to the replication apparatus. The second proposes that thioredoxin regulates the tempo of DNA replication directly by activating a component of the replication machinery."
https://openalex.org/W1502851840,"The major histocompatibility complex (MHC) Class I and II genes and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) are regulated by interferon-gamma in a variety of cell types. We have previously shown that the oligodeoxynucleotide 5'-GGG GTT GGT TGT GTT GGG TGT TGT GT-RNH2 (oligo I) inhibits the interferon-gamma-mediated enhancement of MHC Class I and ICAM-1 proteins in the K562 cell line. We have now investigated the mechanism of action of oligo I and report that it acts by inhibiting the binding of interferon-gamma to cells. We also show that the dose-response curves, the selectivity profile, and the kinetics of oligo I are consistent with this novel mechanism of action. The dose-response curves for oligo I, obtained using antibodies against the MHC Class I heavy chain, beta 2-microglobulin, or ICAM-1, are almost superimposable at each observation time. MHC Class I induction by 6400 units/ml interferon-alpha or interferon-beta or ICAM-1 enhancement by 800 units/ml tumor necrosis factor-alpha is not inhibited by oligo I. However, the synergistic induction of MHC Class I by mixtures of tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interferon-gamma is inhibited. Oligo I belongs to a class of active oligodeoxynucleotides that inhibits interferon-gamma-induced MHC Class I and ICAM-1 in K562 cells. The activity and potency is sequence-dependent, but remarkably different sequences can have comparable effects. The activity of oligo I in the HeLa S3 cell line inhibits the interferon-gamma-mediated enhancement of both ICAM-1 and MHC Class II DR and the interferon-gamma-mediated reduction in transferrin receptor expression. Thus, oligo I appears to specifically inhibit interferon-gamma-induced changes in protein expression, which is consistent with oligo I acting at an early step(s) in the induction process. Taken together, our results show that oligo I exerts its effects by inhibiting the association of interferon-gamma with the cell surface, which is a novel mechanism of action for oligodeoxynucleotides."
https://openalex.org/W1483967920,"Tetrahydropterins react with phenylalanine hydroxylase at a redox site, a regulatory site, and the catalytic site, but neither the properties of nor relationships among these sites are well understood. We have studied the redox site using the fluorescent iron chelators 2,3-dihydroxynaphthalene and bathophenanthroline; these compounds act as site-specific reporter groups for reactions on oxidized and reduced enzyme, respectively. The chelators bind reversibly and specifically to the enzyme's iron with 1:1 stoichiometry, high affinity (Kd values approximately 1 nM), and complete quenching of their own fluorescence. The kinetic behavior of these and other iron chelators indicates that the enzyme's iron is solvent accessible and in a hydrophobic pocket of the protein. Both ferrous and ferric chelators inhibit phenylalanine hydroxylase activity. Bathophenanthroline inhibits by binding to Fe2+ on reduced, active enzyme. 2,3-Dihydroxynaphthalene inhibits by binding to Fe3+ on enzyme that is oxidized during catalysis. This oxidation occurs approximately 1/150 enzyme turnovers, and its rate is increased when p-chloro- or p-fluorophenylalanine is used as the reaction substrate. Studies of the reaction of tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) at the enzyme's redox site showed that BH4 reduces the enzyme more slowly than 6-methyltetrahydropterin under catalytic and non-catalytic conditions. Reduction occurs at a distinct site whose binding determinants and reaction characteristics are different from those of the BH4 regulatory or catalytic sites, and phenylalanine-activated enzyme is reduced more rapidly than unactivated enzyme. In reducing phenylalanine activated enzyme, BH4 donates one electron/subunit (1/iron atom); the reduction kinetics suggest a trihydrobiopterin-free radical as a reaction intermediate."
https://openalex.org/W137670802,"Hexokinase has been purified from adult Schistosoma mansoni worms and the activity shown to be associated with a single protein species having an M(r) about 50,000. This protein is recognized on Western blots probed with antisera against rat Type I hexokinase or against a recombinant S. mansoni hexokinase that had been expressed in Escherichia coli using a previously cloned cDNA. An 18-residue N-terminal sequence determined for the purified S. mansoni hexokinase is identical to that deduced from the nucleotide sequence of the cDNA, consistent with the view that the cloned cDNA encodes the hexokinase characterized in the present study. The S. mansoni enzyme has a relatively low Km (approximately 60 microM) for glucose and is sensitive to inhibition (competitive versus ATP, Ki approximately 50 microM) by its product, glucose 6-phosphate (Glc-6-P). With these kinetic properties and 50 kDa molecular mass, S. mansoni hexokinase resembles the ancestral hexokinase predicted to have given rise, by gene duplication and fusion, to the present day 100-kDa Glc-6-P-sensitive mammalian hexokinases. The schistosomal hexokinase represents the first 50-kDa Glc-6-P-sensitive hexokinase whose sequence has been obtained. The schistosomal hexokinase does not bind to mitochondria, consistent with its lack of a hydrophobic segment at the N terminus which is required for binding of the mammalian Type I and II isoenzymes to mitochondria. The marked Crabtree effect exhibited by S. mansoni cercariae may be at least partly attributed to the expression of rather high levels of a hexokinase having a high affinity for glucose but only a moderate sensitivity to product inhibition by Glc-6-P."
https://openalex.org/W1536406885,"10-Formyltetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase catalyzes the NADP(+)-dependent oxidation of 10-formyltetrahydrofolate to CO2 and tetrahydrofolate. Previous studies have shown that the enzyme binds the physiological pentaglutamate form of tetrahydrofolate product so tightly that it remains bound during size exclusion chromatography (Cook, R. J., and Wagner, C. (1982) Biochemistry 21, 4427-4434). In addition to the dehydrogenase activity, the enzyme from rat liver has been reported to exhibit both 10-formyltetrahydrofolate hydrolase and aldehyde dehydrogenase activities (Cook, R. J., Lloyd, R. S., and Wagner, C. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 4965-4973). We have purified the enzyme from rabbit liver and found that it catalyzes the same three reactions with similar kinetic constants and that it is a 99-kDa homotetramer, as reported previously for the rat and pig enzymes. Previous studies have suggested that the enzyme is composed of three domains and has separate folate binding sites for the dehydrogenase and hydrolase activities. We have investigated the domain structure of the rabbit enzyme. Differential scanning calorimetry reveals two thermal transitions, indicating the presence of two independently folded domains. The pentaglutamate form of tetrahydrofolate and NADP+ each stabilize one of the thermal transitions, showing that these ligands bind to separate domains. Limited proteolytic digestions by several proteases cleave the enzyme in a linker region between the two domains. After proteolytic cleavage, the domains no longer remain associated and do not catalyze the 10-formyltetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase reaction. Isolation and characterization of the intact domains revealed that the N-terminal domain only catalyzes the NADP(+)-independent 10-formyltetrahydrofolate hydrolase activity and the C-terminal domain only catalyzes the NADP(+)-dependent aldehyde dehydrogenase activity. The kinetic constants of these isolated domains are similar to those of the intact enzyme. Binding studies on the native enzyme using fluorescence and isothermal titration calorimetry indicated that the enzyme binds one molecule of tetrahydrofolate and two molecules of NADP+ per tetramer. Dissociation constants for both ligands were also determined by these methods."
https://openalex.org/W2143751648,"Site-directed and chimeric mutations of myosin regulatory light chains were used to identify residues important for phosphorylation of Ser19 by smooth muscle myosin light chain kinase. Arg16 and hydrophobic residues C-terminal of Ser19 in smooth muscle light chain were important substrate determinants in the intact protein. However, changes in the kinetic properties with mutations in the light chain were substantially smaller than results reported with structurally similar synthetic peptide substrates. These results together with the low Vmax value for short peptide substrates containing the consensus phosphorylation sequence suggest that there may be additional sites of interactions between the kinase and protein substrate. Chimeras of skeletal and smooth muscle light chains were constructed with exchanges at the N terminus and subdomains I, II, III, and IV. Analysis of results obtained on the kinetic properties for phosphorylation showed that subdomains I and II contribute to high Vmax values. Thus, a region distant from the consensus phosphorylation sequence in smooth muscle light chain is also an important substrate determinant for myosin light chain kinase."

We find that the regions about the second and third extracellular loops of these two receptors contain the determinants for MK-678 selectivity and affinity."
https://openalex.org/W1579306753,"Cadmium accumulation and its effect on gene expression have been investigated at sublethal cadmium concentrations in the soil oligochaete Enchytraeus buchholzi. This worm is capable of accumulating cadmium to large amounts, which coincides with the induction of a mRNA isolated as a cDNA clone by differential screening of a cDNA library constructed from cadmium-treated enchytraeids. The cDNA clone designated CRP1 is 1474 base pairs in length and contains a 753-base pair open reading frame, encoding a novel Cys-rich non-metallothionein protein. In vitro translation of the in vitro transcribed CRP1 results in a protein with a molecular mass of 25 kDa and an pI of approximately 7.5. These values are consistent with those predicted from the deduced amino acid sequence. The CRP protein contains 27% Cys, most of them arranged in Cys-X-Cys and Cys-Cys segments. The sequence is also characterized by a 31-amino-acid motif, which is tandemly repeated along the sequence. Northern blot analysis reveals that the CRP gene is not constitutively expressed in untreated worms, but rather it is rapidly induced by cadmium. The CRP gene may be a promising candidate gene for monitoring bioavailable cadmium at subtoxic levels in terrestric environments."

https://openalex.org/W1595618926,"We have identified the regulatory sequences that govern the expression of the human transferrin gene in cultured brain cells and compared them with the data obtained with the neuronal cell line B103. Oligodendrocytes and epithelial choroid plexus cells from rat brain were cultured and used for transient expression experiments. Deletion analysis of 1.8 kilobase pairs of the 5' regulatory sequences revealed a -1530/-1140 positive-acting region in oligodendrocytes. The -164/+1 promoter region was sufficient to confer cell type-specific transcription in oligodendrocytes, epithelial choroid plexus cells, and B103 cells. DNase I footprinting experiments revealed three protected sequences, the proximal regions I and II, and the central region I. Gel retardation and antibody reactivity data allowed us to identify most of the nuclear factors present in oligodendrocytes interacting with the promoter sequences. Chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter transcription factor, a CAAT/enhancer-binding protein, and a cAMP response element-binding protein called CRI-BP interact with the proximal regions I and II and central region I sites, respectively. These data confirm the results obtained with the neuronal cell line and emphasize the importance of the three promoter elements for the transferrin gene-specific expression in the central nervous system compared with only two elements required for liver- and testis-specific expression."

The resultant preparation catalyzed the transfer of 35S from 3'-phosphoadenosyl-5'-phospho-[35S]sulfate into N,O-desulfated, re-N-sulfated heparin. Anion-exchange high performance liquid chromatography of disaccharides obtained by deaminative cleavage of the 35S-labeled polysaccharide product revealed O-35S-sulfation at C-2 of L-iduronic acid and at C-6 of D-glucosamine units. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of semipurified enzyme followed by extraction of gel segments and renaturation of proteins consistently showed two distinct fractions of O-sulfotransferase activity, corresponding to proteins of approximately 20 and approximately 60 kDa. The approximately 60-kDa enzyme(s) catalyzed both the 2-O- and 6-O-sulfotransferase reactions, whereas the approximately 20-kDa fraction promoted iduronosyl 2-O-sulfation only. These results are discussed in relation to previous findings, indicating that some of the enzymes involved in heparin biosynthesis catalyze more than one reaction."
https://openalex.org/W1672241740,"The reaction of Cd7-metallothionein with cis-dichlorodiammine platinum (II) has been examined in titration and kinetic experiments. Titrations followed by 111Cd NMR spectroscopy and analysis of cadmium and platinum in the products indicated that platinum displaced cadmium in approximate 1:1 fashion, producing Pt7-metallothionein. According to NMR analysis, the overall reaction involved cooperative exchange of platinum for 111Cd in each domain of the protein. There was a modest preference for the reaction of the drug with the Cd3-containing beta-domain of the protein. The product had an apparent molecular weight that was nearly the same as that of Cd7-metallothionein as determined by Sephadex G-75 chromatography. Kinetic analysis also supported a cooperative displacement mechanism. The reaction was biphasic; neither step could be identified solely with the reaction of one cluster as indicated by the biphasic reaction of the Cd4-containing alpha-domain with the platinum complex."

There was no detectable transglutaminase activity for either thrombin-activated delta Y481 or delta K462. The rate of ammonia release of thrombin-activated delta K513 and delta A502 was reduced 6- and 4-fold, respectively, whereas ammonia release was not detected for the delta Y481 and delta 462 mutants. The Kact for calcium ions of the delta K513 mutant was similar to recombinant FXIIIa, whereas, it was increased by approximately 3-fold for the delta A502 mutant. The rate of fibrin gamma-chain dimer formation for the delta K513 and delta A502 mutants was reduced by approximately 19-fold. delta K462 did not bind to fibrin, while all of the other thrombin-cleaved mutants were bound. In conclusion, these results documented that the carboxyl-terminal calcium binding domain (Asp468-Glu495) was important for FXIIIa to adopt the correct conformation to ensure that efficient catalysis occurred."
https://openalex.org/W186359248,"The gene from Drosophila melanogaster that encodes phosphofructokinase has been isolated and its structure and expression characterized. Southern blots of genomic DNA, comparison of multiple clones, and in situ hybridization to salivary gland chromosomes indicate that the Drosophila genome contains a single copy of the gene which encodes phosphofructokinase (PFK) that is located at cytogenetic position 46D/E on the polytene map. Analysis of the gene structure reveals a single coding region that spans 6.5 kilobase pairs and is composed of eight exons and seven introns. Three developmentally regulated transcripts are generated through the use of alternative polyadenylation sites. Transcription initiation occurs at a single site. The pattern of transcript accumulation during development is similar to other genes of Drosophila which encode enzymes of the glycolytic pathway. Deficiency analysis of the 46D/E region has identified a lethal complementation group associated with reduced PFK activity, thereby establishing the vital role of PFK function in Drosophila."
https://openalex.org/W1539191161,"Tetanus toxin is a zinc-dependent metalloendoprotease that cleaves synaptobrevin, a polypeptide found in the membranes of synaptic vesicles. This action is thought to account for toxin-induced blockade of transmitter release. However, Facchiano and Luini (Fachiano, F., and Luini, A. (1992) J. Biol Chem. 267, 13267-13271) have proposed that tetanus toxin can stimulate transglutaminase, and Facchiano et al. (Facchiano, F., Benfenati, F., Valtorta, F., and Luini, A. (1993) J. Biol Chem. 268, 4588-4591) have further proposed that the stimulated enzyme produces cross-linking of synapsin. These actions might also account for toxin-induced blockade of exocytosis. Therefore, a series of experiments were performed to evaluate the possibility that tetanus toxin exerts its effects via transglutaminase. The results indicated that clostridial neurotoxins were poor substrates for the cross-linking effects of transglutaminase, and transglutaminase was a poor substrate for the proteolytic actions of tetanus toxin. In addition, at concentrations relevant to blockade of exocytosis, clostridial neurotoxins did not act on intact cells to stimulate transglutaminase, nor did they act on the isolated enzyme to stimulate cross-linking of putrescine and dimethylcasein. When used as competitive inhibitors of endogenous transglutaminase substrates, glycine methyl ester and monodansylcadaverine did not block toxin action. Furthermore, concentrations of calcium that were too low to support transglutaminase activity did not prevent toxin action. The data suggest that stimulation of transglutaminase is not the principal mechanism by which tetanus toxin blocks exocytosis in nerve cells."

In this study, the effects of AZT on three cell lines transformed by pCD12 plasmid (human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) promoter-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase) were examined. Results showed that AZT has the potential to activate the HIV-1 promoter."
https://openalex.org/W1629505408,"Abstract Glu-86, which interacts with the side chain of Arg-54 across the C1-C2 interface of Escherichia coli aspartate transcarbamoylase, tethers the end of the flexible 80's loop, which moves into the active site during the T to R transition. In order to determine whether this interaction is important for the correct positioning of the 80's loop and Arg-54 at the active site and also for the structural stabilization of the enzyme, a mutant version was created in which Glu-86 was replaced by Gln (Glu-86-->Gln). Although the mutant holoenzyme exhibits almost normal homotropic cooperativity, both the holoenzyme and catalytic subunit exhibit substantial reductions in activity and affinity for aspartate and carbamyl phosphate. Furthermore, the mutant holoenzyme shows a marked decrease in the activation by ATP and by the bisubstrate analog N-(phosphonoacetyl)-L-aspartate, reduced inhibition by CTP, as well as reduced affinities for these ligands. Results from molecular dynamics simulations of the Glu-86-->Gln and Glu-86-->Ala enzymes suggest that the positions of the 80's loop and Arg-54 are significantly perturbed by the introduction of these mutations. Taken together, these results indicate that the interaction between Glu-86 and Arg-54 is important for the formation of the high affinity, high activity form of the enzyme by stabilizing the correct position of the 80's loop and Arg-54 at the active site. Heat inactivation experiments also demonstrated that Glu-86 plays a significant role in the structural stabilization of the C1-C2 interface, since the temperature required for loss of half of the activity of the Glu-86-->Gln catalytic subunit is reduced by 5 degrees C relative to the wild-type catalytic subunit."
https://openalex.org/W173684358,"A notable feature of porcine cytosolic aspartate aminotransferase is the closure of the active site cleft by a mobile amino-terminal segment (residues 15-40) upon binding substrate. The functional roles of Val17 and Phe18, residues that are part of the mobile loop, have been studied in the site-directed mutants in which the size and hydrophobic nature of these residues have been changed. Absorption, circular dichroism spectra, susceptibility to protease 401, and thermal stability did not differ appreciably between wild type and mutant enzymes. In the overall transamination between aspartate and 2-oxoglutarate, V17A represented a typical Km mutant while V17I retained the substrate binding affinity fairly well. In contrast, replacement of Phe18 by Ala resulted in a large decrease in both catalytic rate and binding affinity for substrates. F18W, F18Y, and F18H showed a moderate decrease in kcat and a considerable increase in Km values. Single-turnover reactions with four individual substrates yielded analogous results to those obtained for the overall reaction and, in addition, revealed that k/Kd values of mutants F18A and F18H were over 10 times lower for C5 substrates (glutamate and 2-oxoglutarate) than those for C4 substrates (aspartate and oxalacetate). All mutant enzymes showed variously increased Kd values for substrate analogs such as 2-methylaspartate, succinate, and glutarate. 1H NMR observations of F18H, in which His18 served as a built-in probe, were in accord with the behavior that would be expected from the conformational transition. We conclude that, although Val17 and Phe18 may not be essential for catalysis, the presence of a bulky residue of appropriate size at each position is critical for productive binding of substrate."
