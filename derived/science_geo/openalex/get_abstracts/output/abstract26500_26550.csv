https://openalex.org/W2069306062,"The development of orderly connections in the mammalian visual system depends on action potentials in the optic nerve fibers, even before the retina receives visual input. In particular, it has been suggested that correlated firing of retinal ganglion cells in the same eye directs the segregation of their synaptic terminals into eye-specific layers within the lateral geniculate nucleus. Such correlations in electrical activity were found by simultaneous recording of the extracellular action potentials of up to 100 ganglion cells in the isolated retina of the newborn ferret and the fetal cat. These neurons fired spikes in nearly synchronous bursts lasting a few seconds and separated by 1 to 2 minutes of silence. Individual bursts consisted of a wave of excitation, several hundred micrometers wide, sweeping across the retina at about 100 micrometers per second. These concerted firing patterns have the appropriate spatial and temporal properties to guide the refinement of connections between the retina and the lateral geniculate nucleus."

https://openalex.org/W1971855104,The ability to mark a cell and its descendants genetically so that the resulting cell clone can be distinguished from neighboring cells facilitates studies in animal biology and development. A method of generating clones by inducing homologous mitotic recombination in Drosophila with a site-specific yeast recombinase is described. This method allows for frequent mosaicism after mitotic exchange is induced at predefined sites in the genome.

https://openalex.org/W2112280022,"Many acute and chronic lung diseases are characterized by the presence of increased numbers of activated macrophages. These macrophages are derived predominantly from newly recruited peripheral blood monocytes and may play a role in the amplification and perpetuation of an initial lung insult. The process of inflammatory cell recruitment is poorly understood, although the expression of inflammatory cell-specific chemoattractants and subsequent generation of chemotactic gradients is likely involved. Although immune cells such as macrophages and lymphocytes are known to generate several inflammatory cell chemoattractants, parenchymal cells can also synthesize and secrete a number of bioactive factors. We now demonstrate the generation of significant monocyte chemotactic activity from tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and interleukin (IL)-1 beta-treated pulmonary type II-like epithelial cells (A549). The predominant inducible monocyte chemotaxin had an estimated molecular mass of approximately 14-15 kDa and was neutralized by specific antibody to human monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1). Induction of activity was accompanied by increases in steady-state mRNA level for MCP-1. These data are consistent with the induction of MCP-1 expression from A549 cells by TNF and IL-1. MCP-1 production from A549 cells could be induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated alveolar macrophage (AM)-conditioned media, but not by LPS alone. The inducing activity in AM-conditioned media was neutralized with specific antibodies to IL-1 beta, but not TNF-alpha. Our findings suggest that the alveolar epithelium can participate in inflammatory cell recruitment via the production of MCP-1 and that cytokine networking between contiguous alveolar macrophages and the pulmonary epithelium may be essential for parenchymal cell MCP-1 expression."
https://openalex.org/W1488974291,"Inflammatory factors such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF), interleukin 1 (IL-1), and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) greatly enhance the expression of group II phospholipase A2 (PLA2-II) mRNA, leading to increased secretion of PLA2-II enzyme from rat-cultured astrocytes. The potent antiinflammatory agent dexamethasone suppressed the PLA2-II expression induced by LPS. In vivo studies also demonstrated that the level of PLA2-II mRNA in the brain increased with intravenous injection of LPS. These results suggest that PLA2-II in the brain plays important roles in the inflammatory response. Agents which increase intracellular cAMP concentration did not stimulate PLA2-II expression by themselves but selectively enhanced TNF-induced PLA2-II expression about 5-fold. Phorbol ester, a well known protein kinase C activator, increased the PLA2-II expression. H-7, a protein kinase C inhibitor, inhibited the LPS-induced PLA2-II expression, but did not inhibit the TNF-induced one. Therefore, we conclude that the TNF-activated pathway differs from the LPS-activated one: the former is enhanced by cAMP and the latter involves protein kinase C."

https://openalex.org/W1572963091,"Selenoprotein P is a plasma protein recently purified and characterized as containing 7.5 +/- 1.0 selenium atoms/molecule as selenocysteine. In rats maintained on a defined diet containing nutritionally adequate amounts of selenate as the sole selenium source, over half the selenium in plasma is accounted for by selenoprotein P. Its cDNA has been cloned from a rat liver library and sequenced. The sequence is highly unusual, containing 10 TGA codons in its open reading frame prior to the TAA termination codon. TGA designates selenocysteine in other selenoproteins, and limited peptide sequencing that included the amino acids encoded by two of the TGA codons verified that they correspond to selenocysteine. The deduced 366-amino acid sequence is histidine- and cysteine-rich and contains 9 of its selenocysteines in the terminal 122 amino acids. Comparison of the deduced amino acid sequence of selenoprotein P with those of other selenoprotein reveals no significant similarities. Selenoprotein P represents a new class of selenoproteins and is the first protein described with more than 1 selenocysteine in a single polypeptide chain. The primary structure of selenoprotein P suggests that it might be responsible for some of the antioxidant properties of selenium."

https://openalex.org/W1547383204,"Resveratrol and chalcone synthases are related plant-specific polyketide synthases that are key enzymes in the biosynthesis of stilbenes and flavonoids, respectively. The stepwise condensing reactions correspond to those in other polyketide and fatty-acid synthases. This predicts that the two proteins also contain cysteines that are essential for enzyme activity because they bind the substrates. We exchanged, in both enzymes, all of the 6 conserved cysteines into alanine by site-directed mutagenesis and tested the mutants after expression of the proteins in the Escherichia coli heterologous system. Only cysteine 169 was essential in both enzymes, and inhibitor studies suggest that it is the main target of cerulenin, an antibiotic reacting with the cysteine in the active center of condensing enzymes. Most of the other exchanges led to reduced activities. In two cases, the enzymes responded differently, suggesting that the cysteines at positions 135 and 195 may be involved in the different product specificity of the two enzymes. The sequences surrounding the essential cysteine 169 revealed no similarity to the active sites of condensing enzymes in other polyketide synthases and in fatty acid biosynthesis. The available data indicate that resveratrol and chalcone synthases represent a group of enzymes that evolved independently of other condensing enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W1533874578,"Cultured neonatal rat cardiac myocytes express at least three isozymes of protein kinase C (PKC), and two PKC isozymes are translocated to different intracellular sites on activation with alpha 1-adrenergic agonists or phorbol myristate acetate. Differential intracellular localization upon activation was compatible with differential function, and we therefore asked whether PKC isozymes had distinct roles in regulating transcription of the cardiac myosin heavy chain (MHC) genes. Cardiac myocytes were transfected with chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter plasmids containing the promoters of the beta-MHC or alpha-MHC isogenes. An alpha 1-adrenergic agonist stimulated the beta-MHC promoter by 3-fold but had no effect on the alpha-MHC promoter. This pattern of MHC promoter regulation by an alpha 1 agonist was the same as that found previously for the endogenous MHC mRNAs in this model system. Myocytes were then co-transfected with the beta- or alpha-MHC-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase plasmids and expression plasmids encoding wild-type or constitutively activated mutants of the alpha- and beta-isozymes of PKC. Co-transfection with wild-type alpha-PKC or wild-type beta-PKC did not stimulate the beta-MHC promoter, and none of the expressed PKCs affected the alpha-MHC promoter. However, the constitutively activated mutant of beta-PKC stimulated the beta-MHC promoter by 8-fold, whereas stimulation by the activated alpha-PKC mutant was only 40% as great (3-fold). In contrast, the constitutively activated alpha-PKC and beta-PKC mutants were equally potent in stimulating a reporter plasmid containing AP-1 recognition sequences. All transfected PKCs were expressed equally in the myocytes, as judged by immunofluorescence. These data indicate that transcription of the beta-MHC isogene is stimulated preferentially by beta-PKC in cardiac myocytes and provide direct evidence for differential functions of alpa-PKC and beta-PKC in transcriptional regulation."
https://openalex.org/W1544820414,"We report here the cloning and sequencing of matrin 3, an acidic internal matrix protein, from a rat insuloma cDNA library. The nucleotide sequence has a single open reading frame encoding a polypeptide of 845 amino acids. The Genbank and National Biomedical Research Foundation databases did not contain any sequences similar to that of matrin 3. The primary structure consists of 33% charged residues and is generally hydrophilic. The amino-terminal region (residues 1-120) is positively charged and contains a large number of amino acids with free hydroxyl groups (26 of the first 100 residues) as in the lamins and several non-lamin intermediate filament proteins. A highly acidic domain (approximately 170 amino acids) near the carboxyl terminus, in which 32% of the amino acid residues are acidic (Glu or Asp), is a characteristic found in other nuclear proteins (Earnshaw, W. C. (1987) J. Cell Biol. 105, 1479-1482). A putative nuclear targeting signal sequence (Ser-Lys-Lys-Lys-Leu-Lys-Lys-Val-Glu) is located in the middle of the highly acidic domain. The corresponding human deduced partial amino acid sequence is 96% identical to the rat sequence, indicating that matrin 3 is a highly conserved protein."
https://openalex.org/W1548506428,"The steady state level of DNA methyltransferase mRNA is markedly increased as growth-arrested Balb/c 3T3 cells progress into the S phase of the cell cycle. mRNA abundance is reduced to the basal level before termination of DNA synthesis activity. Maintenance DNA methylation activity in nuclear extracts follows a similar pattern with two exceptions. (a) A small peak of DNA methylation activity is detected in early G1 phase. (b) The extinction of DNA methylation activity lags behind the termination of DNA synthesis. Nuclear runon experiments demonstrate that the gene is transcribed in growth-arrested cells, and expression of the gene is post-transcriptionally regulated. We suggest that this mode of regulation of the DNA methyltransferase gene might play an important role in determining and maintaining DNA methylation patterns."
https://openalex.org/W1557896874,"The iron content of human 5-lipoxygenase has been determined by a colorimetric assay using the chromogenic ligand FerroZine. The highly active enzyme was obtained from a baculovirus expression system and purified using an ATP-agarose chromatography column (Denis, D., Falgueyret, J.-P., Riendeau, D., and Abramovitz, M. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 5072-5079). A linear correlation was observed between the enzyme's specific activity and iron content in six different preparations. Enzyme with the highest specific activity (24 mumol of 5-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid/mg of protein) contained 1.1 mol of iron/mol of enzyme, whereas inactive enzyme contained no detectable iron. The iron is tightly bound to the enzyme and could only be released after inactivation of the enzyme by exposure to oxygen."
https://openalex.org/W1929336150,"Submitochondrial membrane fractions from yeast that are enriched in inner and outer membrane contact sites were analyzed with respect to their lipid composition. Characteristic features were the significantly reduced content of phosphatidylinositol, the decreased amount of phosphatidylcholine, and the enrichment in phosphatidylethanolamine and cardiolipin. Coisolation of phosphatidylserine synthase with the outer membrane portion and enrichment of phosphatidylserine decarboxylase in the inner membrane portion of isolated contact sites provided the basis for a metabolic assay to study phosphatidylserine transfer from the outer to the inner mitochondrial membrane via contact sites. The efficient conversion to [3H]phosphatidylethanolamine of [3H]phosphatidylserine synthesized from [3H]serine in situ supports the notion that mitochondrial membrane contact sites are zones of intramitochondrial translocation of phosphatidylserine."
https://openalex.org/W1612870394,"We reported previously that glutamine:F-6-P amidotransferase (GFAT) plays an integral role in the development of insulin resistance by directing the flow of incoming glucose into the hexosamine biosynthesis pathway. To determine whether the enzymatic activity of GFAT is altered during desensitization of the glucose transport system, we treated isolated rat adipocytes with various combinations of insulin, glucose, and glutamine. Treatment with insulin or glucose alone (or in combination) failed to reduce cytosolic GFAT activity after 4 h, whereas combined treatment with all three components elicited a progressive loss of GFAT activity that was rapid (t1/2 of 2 h) and extensive (70% loss). A pronounced loss of GFAT activity was also seen in cells exposed to glucosamine, an agent known to directly enter the hexosamine pathway (55% loss at 4 h, ED50 of 360 microM). Moreover, a close correlation was observed between the induction of desensitization and the loss of GFAT activity as a function of glucose, insulin, glutamine, and glucosamine concentrations. When total intracellular hexosamine products were measured, we found that hexosamine formation was unaltered by insulin or glucose (or a combination) but was elevated by greater than 4-fold in the presence of insulin, glucose, and glutamine (t1/2 of 22 min), a condition known to cause both desensitization and loss of GFAT activity. Additional studies indicated that the loss of GFAT activity under desensitizing conditions is not due to allosteric regulation since removal of potential allosteric factors from the cytosol of desensitized cells by G-25 column chromatography failed to restore enzyme activity. Overall, these studies indicate that 1) GFAT is an insulin-regulated enzyme; however, control of enzyme activity is not due to a direct action of insulin, but rather is mediated by insulin-induced enhancement of glucose uptake; 2) the routing of incoming glucose through the hexosamine pathway and the formation of hexosamine products appears to regulate GFAT activity; and 3) the progressive loss of GFAT activity over several hours is probably not due to allosteric regulation."
https://openalex.org/W1520184516,"The purpose of this work was to investigate whether biotin, a water-soluble vitamin, regulates the glucokinase gene. Biotin was administered intraperitoneally to starved rats, and the time course of glucokinase induction was followed over a time period of 12 h. The glucokinase mRNA was increased 19.6-fold during the first 1 h after biotin administration, afterwards rapidly decayed, and was hardly detectable by 4 h. The amount of glucokinase activity as determined by conventional enzyme activity assay increased in a time-dependent fashion, reaching 4-fold by 2 h of biotin administration. The transcriptional activity of the gene as measured by a nuclear run-on assay was increased about 6.7-fold within 45 min of biotin administration. These findings indicate that biotin can regulate the glucokinase gene at the transcriptional stage in the starved rat."

https://openalex.org/W1510968269,"Abstract The membrane-bound proteins of periplasmic transport systems have been hypothesized to form a complex with relatively little experimental support. Here we present experimental evidence that HisQ, HisM, and HisP, the membrane-bound proteins of the periplasmic histidine transport system of Salmonella typhimurium, form such a complex. We have developed antibodies specific to each of these proteins to aid in their characterization. Extractions with urea, alkaline pH, or Triton X-114 show that HisQ and HisM are integral membrane proteins. By these tests HisP displays an unusual behavior, being associated with the membrane whether or not HisQ and HisM are present and despite its hydrophilic sequence. However, the nature of HisPs interaction with the membrane is shown to vary depending on the presence of HisQ and HisM. In their absence, HisP is somewhat peripherally associated with the membrane, while in their presence it binds much more tightly, indicating that it forms a complex in association with HisQ and HisM. This is demonstrated by the coimmunoprecipitation of all three proteins by antibodies directed against any one of them. Chemical cross-linking allowed the characterization of the subunit stoichiometry of the complex as two HisPs to one HisQ and one HisM. Within this complex all three proteins probably contact each other and the two HisPs form a dimer. We hypothesize that HisQ and HisM with their multiple membrane-spanning segments form a channel within which the HisP subunits are located."
https://openalex.org/W1482122143,"In vivo labeling experiments of Forsythia intermedia plant tissue with [8-14C]- and [9,9-2H2,OC2H3]coniferyl alcohols revealed that the lignans, (-)-secoisolariciresinol and (-)-matairesinol, were derived from two coniferyl alcohol molecules; no evidence for the formation of the corresponding (+)-enantiomers was found. Administration of (+-)-[Ar-3H]secoisolariciresinols to excised shoots of F. intermedia resulted in a significant conversion into (-)-matairesinol; again, the (+)-antipode was not detected. Experiments using cell-free extracts of F. intermedia confirmed and extended these findings. In the presence of NAD(P)H and H2O2, the cell-free extracts catalyzed the formation of (-)-secoisolariciresinol, with either [8-14C]- or [9,9-2H2,OC2H3]coniferyl alcohols as substrates. The (+)-enantiomer was not formed. Finally, when either (-)-[Ar-3H] or (+-)-[Ar-2H]secoisolariciresinols were used as substrates, in the presence of NAD(P), only (-)- and not (+)-matairesinol formation occurred. The other antipode, (+)-secoisolariciresinol, did not serve as a substrate for the formation of either (+)- or (-)-matairesinol. Thus, in F. intermedia, the formation of the lignan, (-)-secoisolariciresinol, occurs under strict stereochemical control, in a reaction or reactions requiring NAD(P)H and H2O2 as cofactors. This stereoselectivity is retained in the subsequent conversion into (-)-matairesinol, since (+)-secoisolariciresinol is not a substrate. These are the first two enzymes to be discovered in lignan formation."

https://openalex.org/W1523746180,"Full length human glucocorticoid receptor and truncated receptor derivatives lacking the major amino-terminal trans-activating domain were expressed in stably transfected Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. The receptors were co-expressed together with human metallothionein IIa, and the expression levels were amplified in the presence of increasing concentrations of metal. In amplified cells, both synthesized receptor forms showed the expected molecular weights, as assayed by affinity labeling and immunoblotting. They were expressed at concentrations of about 350,000-520,000 molecules/cell which corresponds to a 10-fold increase in receptor levels as compared to rat liver cells. The hormone (agonist or antagonist) binding properties of the expressed proteins were very similar to those characteristic of authentic glucocorticoid receptors in tissues or cultured cells. Moreover, the expressed proteins specifically recognized a glucocorticoid-response element sequence motif in in vitro protein-DNA binding experiments. The activation of a glucocorticoid-responsive reporter gene by the expressed full length receptor was dramatic (about 75-fold) and strictly ligand-dependent. In contrast, the expressed amino-terminal deletion mutant exhibited considerably weaker functional activity but showed normal hormone-binding properties. Upon exposure to dexamethasone in vivo, the expressed receptor mRNAs and proteins were down-regulated about 2- to 6-fold, indicating that regulatory signals important for autoregulation may be contained within structures corresponding to the ligand and DNA-binding domains. Transcription from the expression vector was not negatively regulated from the hormone, strongly arguing that receptor down-regulation was due to a post-transcriptional mechanism. In conclusion, this expression system should be a useful tool for further structural and functional studies of the receptor, including the biochemistry of its activation from a cryptic to a functional species, and its ligand-dependent autoregulation."
https://openalex.org/W1488727700,"The 90-kDa heat shock protein, HSP90, of the mouse has two isoforms, alpha and beta, which are electrophoretically separable. We have investigated the native forms of HSP90 molecules under physiological conditions and determined their isoform compositions. Analysis by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis showed that HSP90 purified from mouse lymphoma L5178Y cells consists of approximately 40% alpha and 60% beta isoforms. Analysis by nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis showed that the purified HSP90 exists predominantly as a dimer, but a considerable amount of monomer was also detected. Western blotting using polyclonal anti-mouse HSP90 antibodies revealed that the native forms of HSP90 in the crude L5178Y cell lysates are also dimer and monomer. The nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis resolved the dimeric forms into two separate bands that were identified as alpha/alpha and beta/beta homodimers by two methods: sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and peptide mapping. In addition, the results showed that the monomeric form consists mainly of the beta isoform. Both the alpha and beta isoforms were shown to bind equally to actin filaments."
https://openalex.org/W1481944677,"In this study, we tested the hypothesis that hexose transport regulation may involve proteins with relatively rapid turnover rates. 3T3-L1 adipocytes, which exhibit 10-fold increases in hexose transport rates within 30 min of the addition of 100 nM insulin, were utilized. Exposure of these cells to 300 microM anisomycin or 500 microM cycloheximide caused a maximal, 7-fold increase in 2-deoxyglucose transport rate after 4-8 h. The effects due to either insulin (0.5 h) or anisomycin (5 h) on the kinetics of zero-trans 3-O-methyl[14C]glucose transport were similar, resulting in 2.5-3-fold increases in apparent Vmax values (control Vmax = 1.6 +/- 0.3 x 10(-7) mmol/s/10(6) cells) coupled with approximately 2-fold decreases in apparent Km values (control Km = 23 +/- 3.3 mM). Insulin elicited the expected increases in plasma membrane levels of HepG2/erythrocyte (GLUT1) and muscle/adipocyte (GLUT4) transporters (1.6- and 2.8-fold, respectively) as determined by protein immunoblotting. In contrast, neither total cellular contents nor plasma membrane levels of these two transporter isoforms were increased when 3T3-L1 adipocytes were treated with either anisomycin or cycloheximide. 3-[125I]Iodo-4-azidophenethylamido-7-O-succinyldeacetylforskoli n labeling of glucose transporters in plasma membrane fractions of similarly treated cells was also unaffected by these agents. Thus, a striking discrepancy was observed between the marked increase in cellular hexose transport rates due to these protein synthesis inhibitors and the unaltered amounts of glucose transporter proteins in the plasma membrane fraction. These data indicate that short-term protein synthesis inhibition in 3T3-L1 adipocytes leads to large increases in the intrinsic catalytic activity of one or both of the GLUT1 and GLUT4 transporter isoforms."
https://openalex.org/W1586391652,"In order to study the eukaryotic translation initiation mechanisms of initiation, re-initiation, and/or coupled internal initiation, a series of model mRNAs have been constructed which contain two non-overlapping open reading frames (ORFs) that encode different lengths of rabbit alpha globin. These mRNAs, along with the bicistronic constructs TK/CAT and TK/P2CAT developed by Pelletier and Sonenberg (Pelletier, J., and Sonenberg, N. (1988) Nature 334, 320-325, 1988), were used to program an in vitro rabbit reticulocyte lysate translation system. Cap-dependent and cap-independent translation were distinguished by monitoring translation in the presence or absence of exogenously added cap analog (m7GTP). Messenger RNAs which translate both ORF1 and ORF2 by a cap-dependent mechanism, as well as mRNAs that translate ORF2 by a cap-independent mechanism while still translating ORF1 in a cap-dependent fashion have been obtained. These same alpha globin mRNAs differ by no more than 45 nucleotides in intercistronic length. Initiation factor addition studies were performed in this same in vitro translation system. Both eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF)-4F and, to a lesser extent, eIF-4B can stimulate translation of an internally located ORF independent of upstream ORF translation and in a manner not dependent on mRNA cap recognition. This indicates that the cap-recognition initiation factor, eIF-4F, and eIF-4B facilitate cap-independent and internal initiation of an open reading frame."
https://openalex.org/W1574665002,"Glutamine:fructose-6-phosphate amidotransferase (GFAT) plays a key role in desensitizing the insulin-responsive glucose transport system (GTS), and recent studies have revealed that loss of GFAT activity accompanies desensitization. To gain insights into the mechanisms underlying loss of enzyme activity, we have used primary cultured adipocytes and two well established inhibitors of mRNA synthesis to estimate GFAT turnover. Both actinomycin D and 5,6-dichloro-1-beta-D-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole (DRB) caused a rapid and extensive loss in GFAT activity (greater than 70% loss, t1/2 of 45 min) indicating that GFAT has a relatively short half-life. Since induction of insulin resistance requires GFAT, we next examined the ability of mRNA inhibitors to block glucose-induced desensitization. When adipocytes were cultured for 18 h with 20 mM glucose, amino acids, and 25 ng/ml insulin, maximal insulin responsiveness of the GTS was reduced by greater than 70%. Both actinomycin D and DRB rapidly and completely prevented desensitization in a dose-dependent manner (ED50 of 16 nM and 15 microM, respectively). These findings are the predicted functional consequence of diminished GFAT activity. Evidence that actinomycin D acts selectively on GFAT without influencing other steps within the desensitization pathway was obtained using glucosamine, an agent that enters the hexosamine biosynthesis pathway at a point distal to the action of GFAT. Actinomycin D inhibited glucose-induced desensitization but failed to block glucosamine-induced desensitization. From these studies we conclude that 1) glucose-induced desensitization of the GTS can be completely prevented by actinomycin D and DRB, two potent and diverse inhibitors of mRNA synthesis; 2) the functional integrity of the desensitization pathway is maintained by a short-lived protein; and 3) the identity of this short-lived protein is most likely GFAT, the first and rate-limiting enzyme of the hexosamine biosynthesis pathway."
https://openalex.org/W1569306962,"cDNA clones coding for the gp 80 heterodimeric glycoprotein complex secreted constitutively at the apical surface of Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells have been isolated from MDCK cDNA libraries in lambda gt11 and lambda gt10. The cloned sequences encode a polypeptide chain of 445 amino acids. The deduced amino acid sequence of the gp 80 protein reveals 80% homology to rat SGP-2, a major secretory protein of the testes epithelium and 83% homology to SP-40,40, a human complement-associated protein. SGP-2 and SP-40,40 have been proposed to be serum and seminal forms of the same protein. The sequence homology as well as the results of Southern and Northern blot analyses and immunological studies suggest that gp 80 is the canine homolog of the rat SGP-2 and the human SP-40,40. The protein is expressed in the embryonic kidney already early during organogenesis. In the adult kidney the protein has been localized along the luminal surfaces of the proximal and distal tubule and the collecting duct cells."
https://openalex.org/W1490191338,"Abstract Natural human interleukin-6 (IL-6) characterized under completely denaturing conditions consists of a set of differentially modified phosphoglycoproteins of molecular mass in the range from 23 to 30 kDa (25-kDa O-glycosylated species and O- and N-glycosylated species). The 25-kDa O-glycosylated IL-6 (which contains only Ser- or Thr-GalNAc-Gal-NeuNAc and thus should not bind wheat germ or lentil lectins) bound to and was eluted from a wheat germ lectin affinity column by GlcNAc and from a lentil lectin affinity column by methyl-alpha-D-Man suggesting that the 25-kDa IL-6 species formed heteromeric complexes with the N-glycosylated 30-kDa IL-6. In non-denaturing gels (0.2% Nonidet P-40-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE)), even under reducing conditions (15 mM dithiothreitol or 1 M beta-mercaptoethanol and heating), fibroblast-derived IL-6 migrated as a predominant complex of mass approximately 85 kDa and additional minor 45-65-kDa complexes. Little IL-6 was detected in the size range 23-30 kDa. Elution of the major 85-kDa complex and re-electrophoresis through sodium dodecyl sulfate-PAGE revealed that it represented a heteromeric aggregate of the 25- and 30-kDa IL-6 species; the 45-65-kDa complexes were largely composed of the 25-kDa protein. The bulk of fibroblast-derived IL-6 eluted in the size range 45-85 kDa from a Sephadex G-200 gel filtration column further indicating that fibroblast-derived IL-6 was largely multimeric even in dilute solutions. Functionally, the high molecular mass IL-6 fractions from the G-200 column were less active in the B9 hybridoma growth factor assay than the lower molecular mass fractions but appeared to be equally active in the Hep3B hepatocyte-stimulating factor assay. Taken together, the data indicate that natural human IL-6 exists as a multimeric aggregate with varying biological activity."
https://openalex.org/W1513416306,"The bile acid-conjugating enzyme, bile acid-CoA: amino acid N-acyltransferase, was purified 480-fold from the soluble fraction of homogenized frozen human liver. Purification was accomplished by a combination of anion exchange chromatography, chromatofocusing, glycocholate-AH-Sepharose affinity chromatography, and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) gel filtration. Following purification, the reduced, denatured enzyme migrated as a single 50-kDa protein band by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. A similar molecular mass was obtained for the native enzyme by HPLC gel filtration. Elution from the chromatofocusing column suggested an apparent isoelectric point of 6.0 (+/- 0.2). Using a rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against the purified enzyme, Western blot analysis using 100,000 x g human liver supernatant confirmed that the affinity-purified polyclonal antibody was specific for human liver bile acid-CoA:amino acid N-acyltransferase. The purified enzyme utilized glycine, taurine, and 2-fluoro-beta-alanine (a 5-fluorouracil catabolite), but not beta-alanine, as substrates. Kinetic studies revealed apparent Km values for taurine, 2-fluoro-beta-alanine, and glycine of 1.1, 2.2, and 5.8 mM, respectively, with corresponding Vmax values of 0.33, 0.19, and 0.77 mumol/min/mg protein. These data demonstrate that a single monomeric enzyme is responsible for the conjugation of bile acids with glycine or taurine in human liver."
https://openalex.org/W1534248666,"Osteopetrosis is a group of metabolic bone diseases characterized by reductions in osteoclast development and/or function. These aspects of osteoclast biology are known to be influenced by osteoblasts and their products. To ascertain whether osteoblast dysfunction contributes to aberrations in the structural and functional properties of osteoclasts in osteopetrosis, we systematically examined gene expression as reflected by mRNA levels for a series of cell growth- and tissue-related genes associated with the osteoblast phenotype during skeletal development in normal and mutant rats of three different osteopetrotic stocks. We show that the methods used permit the reproducible isolation of undegraded total cellular RNA from bone and that mRNA levels can be reliably quantitated in these preparations. Each osteopetrotic mutation exhibits a distinct aberrant pattern of osteoblast gene expression that may be correlated with and explain some abnormalities in extracellular matrix composition, mineralization, osteoclast development, and effects of elevated serum levels of 1 alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, depending upon the mutation. Normal rats show minor variations in gene expression that reflect the genetic background (stock). This, the first comprehensive molecular analysis of osteoblast gene expression in osteopetrosis, suggests that some osteopetroses, particularly in the toothless rat, are associated with and potentially related to mechanisms associated with aberrations in osteoblast function. More generally, the present studies demonstrate alterations in gene expression as reflected by mRNA levels that are associated with functional properties of the osteoblast, particularly those contributing to the recruitment and/or differentiation of osteoclasts, thereby influencing skeletal modeling."
https://openalex.org/W1658244448,"Recombinant human epidermal growth factor (EGF, 2-10 ng/ml) stimulated growth and production of non-collagenous proteins, but inhibited production of collagen by 60% in cultured human skin fibroblasts. Type analysis of the collagen produced indicated that inhibition of the collagen production observed was mainly a reflection of a reduction in type I collagen. The accumulation of pro alpha 1(I) and pro alpha 2(I) mRNAs and the transcriptional activity of these genes were determined in human skin fibroblasts in order to investigate site(s) of regulation of type I collagen production by human EGF in the absence and presence of L-ascorbic acid 2-phosphate (Asc 2-P), a long-acting vitamin C derivative. Human EGF (10 ng/ml) used alone reduced the steady state levels of mRNAs for pro alpha 1(I) and pro alpha 2(I) chains and transcriptional activity of these genes in vitro by 45%. Asc 2-P (0.2 mM) alone, on the other hand, raised production of type I collagen and the steady state levels of mRNAs for pro alpha 1(I) and pro alpha 2(I) collagen chains as well as stimulated transcriptional activity of these genes. Human EGF attenuated these stimulative effects of Asc 2-P. These results indicate that human EGF regulates type I collagen synthesis at the transcriptional level in cultured fibroblasts in the presence and absence of Asc 2-P. The possibility that human EGF plays a role as a regulator of type I collagen genes in vivo was discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2127055046,"High-resolution NMR studies of bacteriorhodopsin require the availability of the detergent-solubilized protein with both high concentration and small rotational correlation time. A procedure is described for the optimized preparation of such samples. Bacteriorhodopsin was first delipidated by detergent treatment of purple membrane under nonsolubilizing conditions for the protein. The delipidated aggregated protein could then be solubilized into monomers at concentration close to millimolar by selected detergents. The solubilizing detergent had an important effect on the rotational correlation time of the protein as shown by measuring in each case the temperature-dependent stability of the protein, the size of the detergent-protein complex, and the detergent viscosity. Consistently, a strong influence of the detergent was also found on spectral resolution in 13C NMR spectra of solubilized bacteriorhodopsin labeled with [1-13C]phenylalanine. Best resolution was obtained using n-dodecylmaltoside as detergent, with which relatively narrow well resolved 13C NMR resonances were observed at 50 degrees C. It is suggested that high-resolution NMR studies performed with this detergent may contribute to the structural resolution of bacteriorhodopsin."
https://openalex.org/W1602343990,"It has been postulated that the N-acyl fatty acid attached to the amino terminus of the major Escherichia coli lipoprotein is derived from the fatty acid at the 1-position of phosphatidylethanolamine (PtdEtn) (Jackowski, S., and Rock, C.O. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 11328-11333). To ascertain the role of PtdEtn in the conversion of apolipoprotein to the mature lipoprotein, the lipoprotein from E. coli strain AH930 (pss::kan) containing a null mutation in the phosphatidylserine synthase gene (pss) was studied. Pulse labeling with [35S]methionine for 30 s or 5 min revealed the formation of mature lipoprotein in both wild-type (W3110) and mutant (AH930) cells. [3H]Palmitate-labeled lipoproteins from both the mutant and wild-type cells were found to contain nearly identical amounts of alkali-resistant (amide-linked, 41-42%) and alkali-labile (ester-linked, 58-59%) fatty acids. Edman degradation and dansylation of the immuno-affinity-purified [35S]cysteine-labeled lipoprotein showed that the NH2 terminus of the lipoprotein in the mutant was blocked as in the wild type. In vitro assay of apolipoprotein N-acyltransferase using membranes either from the mutant or the wild-type strain as the source of both the enzyme and the acyl donor revealed that both membranes were equally active in the conversion of [35S]methionine-labeled apolipoprotein to lipoprotein. These data strongly suggest that PtdEtn is not essential for the N-acylation of apolipoprotein to form lipoprotein, and other major phospholipids such as phosphatidylglycerol and cardiolipin can serve as the donor of fatty acid in the N-acylation of apolipoprotein."
https://openalex.org/W1495257973,"The kinetics of Klebsiella aerogenes urease inactivation by disulfide and alkylating agents was examined and found to follow pseudo-first-order kinetics. Reactivity of the essential thiol is affected by the presence of substrate and competitive inhibitors, consistent with a cysteine located proximal to the active site. In contrast to the results observed with other reagents, the rate of activity loss in the presence of 5,5'-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB) saturated at high reagent concentrations, indicating that DTNB must first bind to urease before inactivation can occur. The pH dependence for the rate of urease inactivation by both disulfide and alkylating agents was consistent with an interaction between the thiol and a second ionizing group. The resulting macroscopic pKa values for the 2 residues are less than 5 and 12. Spectrophotometric studies at pH 7.75 demonstrated that 2,2'-dithiodipyridine (DTDP) modified 8.5 +/- 0.2 mol of thiol/mol of enzyme or 4.2 mol of thiol/mol of catalytic unit. With the slow tight binding competitive inhibitor phenyl-phosphorodiamidate (PPD) bound to urease, 1.1 +/- 0.1 mol of thiol/mol of catalytic unit were protected from modification. PPD-bound DTDP-modified urease could be reactivated by dialysis, consistent with the presence of one thiol per active site. Analogous studies at pH 6.1, using the competitive inhibitor phosphate, confirmed the presence of one protected thiol per catalytic unit. Under denaturing conditions, 25.5 +/- 0.3 mol of thiol/mol of enzyme (Mr = 211, 800) were modified by DTDP."
https://openalex.org/W1550284984,"The extracellular hemoglobin of the earthworm Lumbricus terrestris has a two-tiered hexagonal structure that can be dissociated into 1/12 subunits. The Hb contains four major kinds of oxygen-binding chains, a, b, c, and d, of which a-c form a disulfide-linked trimer. Additional non-heme chains are necessary for the assembly of the intact 3800-kDa molecule of approximately 200 subunits. Oxygen equilibria have been measured for chains c and d, the abc trimer, the partially reassembled product of addition of chain d to the trimer, and the intact molecule. The results show that oxygenation of the trimer but not the isolated c or d subunits is modulated by both pH and Ca2+ ions. Cooperativity of oxygen binding by the trimer is low (Hill coefficient approximately 1.3). However, addition of chain d results in a substantial decrease in oxygen affinity and a large increase in cooperativity so that the oxygen equilibrium becomes indistinguishable from that of the intact native molecule at pH 6.8. Light-scattering data show that the smallest observed trimeric abc unit is the dimer (abc)2 at pH 6.8. Analysis of the major sedimentation velocity boundary of the product of the abc unit and chain d in the CO form in the absence of calcium surprisingly can be accounted for entirely in terms of a nondissociating dimer, (abc)2, and chain d. The data for the CO form in the presence of calcium are best fitted in terms of (abc)2.d. Although both subunits c and d also form dimers, oxygen binding by subunit c, but not d, is highly cooperative. These observations, taken together, suggest that the two dimers (abc)2 and d2 are likely to be the major participants in forming the primary functional unit, (abcd)2, which at pH 7.4 is partially dissociated when in the CO form. Subunit d is clearly necessary for the formation of a cooperative unit. The hypothesis that (abcd)2 is a primary functional unit is consistent with a stoichiometry of 2 (abcd)2 units per 1/12 subunit or 24 such units in each molecule of Hb which would contain, in all, 192 heme-containing chains."
https://openalex.org/W1481768635,"We have prepared antibodies that recognize isopentenyladenosine (i6A), a modified nucleoside derived from mevalonic acid (MVA). In immunoblot assays, affinity-purified anti-i6 A antibodies specifically bound to a 26-kDa protein (i6A26) in Chinese hamster ovary cells. Anti-i6A recognition of i6A26 was blocked with i6A but not adenosine or isopentenol. Employing immunoblot analysis we have quantitated the level of i6A26 in cells expressing various rates of DNA synthesis. The cellular content of i6A26 was reduced 4-fold in quiescent cells cultured in the absence of serum. When serum-deprived cells were stimulated to enter the cell cycle, the amount of i6A26 increased in the cells during the G1 phase. However, when synchronized cells were stimulated with serum-containing medium in the presence of mevinolin (an inhibitor of cellular MVA synthesis), we observed impaired G1 expression of i6A26 and delayed onset of S phase DNA synthesis. Mevinolin addition to asynchronously growing cells resulted in low rates of cellular DNA synthesis and suppressed levels of i6A26 which were reversed by coincubation with MVA. The ability of MVA to restore DNA synthesis and the cellular content of i6A26 in mevinolin-treated cells showed similar MVA concentration and time dependences. Regenerating liver tissue also exhibited elevated levels of i6A26. Thus, the expression of i6A26 correlates with cellular proliferation and growth. We speculate that i6A26 contains isopentenyladenine moieties and mediates isoprenoid regulation of DNA synthesis. Isopentenyladenylated proteins may also function in cytokinin regulation of proliferation and differentiation in plants."
https://openalex.org/W1513998961,"A cDNA clone, pCP15, specific for the chicken 66-kDa major bone phosphoprotein (osteopontin), was isolated from a subtracted library enriched in DNAs coding for mRNAs expressed in chicken differentiating chondrocytes. Northern blot analysis of RNAs extracted from several chick embryo tissues and organs, confirm and extend the observation that osteopontin mRNA expression is not restricted to tissues involved in phosphate metabolism. Osteopontin mRNA was detected in sternal resting chondrocytes at higher levels than in hypertrophic chondrocytes; therefore osteopontin gene transcription occurs in chondrocytes at many stages of differentiation. The steady state level of osteopontin mRNA was enhanced by trypsin treatment of cultured cells. An increased level of osteopontin mRNA in quail chondrocytes constitutively expressing v-myc oncogene is also shown."
https://openalex.org/W1599221894,"The catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km) of Escherichia coli flavin pyruvate oxidase can be stimulated 450-fold either by the addition of lipid activators or by limited proteolytic hydrolysis. Previous studies have shown that a functional lipid binding site is a mandatory prerequisite for the in vivo functioning of this enzyme (Grabau, C., and Cronan, J. E., Jr. (1986) Biochemistry 25, 3748-3751). The effect of activation on the transient state kinetics of partial reactions in the overall oxidative conversion of pyruvate to acetate and CO2 has now been examined. The rate of decarboxylation of pyruvate to form CO2 and hydroxyethylthiamin pyrophosphate for both activated and unactivated forms of the enzyme is identical within experimental error. The decarboxylation step was measured using substrate concentrations of the enzyme in the absence of an electron acceptor. The pseudo-first order rate constant for the decarboxylation step is 60-80 s-1. The rate of oxidation of hydroxyethylthiamin pyrophosphate and concomitant enzyme-bound flavin reduction was analyzed by stopped-flow methods utilizing synthetic hydroxyethylthiamin pyrophosphate. The pseudo-first order rate for this step with unactivated enzyme was 2.85 s-1 and increased 145-fold for lipid-activated enzyme to 413 s-1 and 61-fold for the proteolytically activated enzyme to 173 s-1. The analysis of a third reaction step, the reoxidation of enzyme-bound FADH, was also investigated by stopped-flow techniques utilizing ferricyanide as the electron acceptor. The rate of oxidation of enzyme.FADH is very fast for both unactivated (1041 s-1) and activated enzyme (645 s-1). The data indicate that the FAD reduction step is the rate-limiting step in the overall reaction for unactivated enzyme. Alternatively, the rate-limiting step in the overall reaction with the activated enzyme shifts to one of the partial steps in the decarboxylation reaction."

The predicted protein sequence is highly homologous to that of the yeast cytoplasmic, yeast mitochondria and Escherichia coli threonyl-tRNA synthetases. In particular, the three structural motifs recently shown to be common to class II aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases are present in the threonyl-tRNA synthetases from all sources. Primer extension and S1 nuclease analyses indicate that transcription initiates approximately 220-230 nucleotides upstream of the putative initiator methionine codon.

https://openalex.org/W1606693541,"Abstract The immunoaffinity-purified subunits of the yeast DNA primase-DNA polymerase protein complex and subunit-specific monoclonal antibodies were used to explore the structural relationships of the subunits in the complex. The reconstituted four-subunit complex (180-, 86-, 58-, and 49-kDa polypeptides) behaved as a single species, exhibiting a Stokes radius of 80 A and a sedimentation coefficient of 8.9 S. The calculated molecular weight of the reconstituted complex is 312,000. We infer that the stoichiometry of the complex is one of each subunit per complex. The complex has a prolate ellipsoid shape with an axial ratio of approximately 16. When the 180-kDa and DNA primase subunits were recombined in the absence of the 86-kDa subunit, a physical complex formed, as judged by immunoprecipitation of DNA primase activity and polypeptides with an anti-180-kDa monoclonal antibody. While the 86-kDa subunit readily forms a physical complex with the 180-kDa DNA polymerase catalytic subunit, we have not detected a complex containing 86-kDa and the DNA primase subcomplex (49- and 58-kDa subunits). The 86-kDa subunit was not required for DNA primase-DNA polymerase complex formation; the 180-kDa subunit and DNA primase heterodimer directly interact. However, the presence of the 86-kDa subunit increased the rate at which the DNA primase and 180-kDa polypeptides formed a complex and increased the total fraction of DNA primase activity that was associated with DNA polymerase activity. The observations demonstrate that the DNA primase p49.p58 heterodimer and the DNA polymerase p86.p180 heterodimer interact via the 180-kDa subunit. The four-subunit reconstituted complex was sufficient to catalyze the DNA chain extension coupled to RNA primer synthesis on a single-stranded DNA template, as previously observed in the conventionally purified complex isolated from wild type cells."
https://openalex.org/W1486959712,"Abstract In reactions between linear single-stranded DNAs (ssDNAs) and circular double-stranded DNAs (dsDNAs), stable joint molecule formation promoted by the recA protein (RecA) requires negative superhelicity, a homologous end, and an RecA-ssDNA complex. Linear ssDNAs with 3'-end homology react more efficiently than linear ssDNAs with 5'-end homology. This 3'-end preference is explained by the finding that 3'-ends are more effectively coated by RecA than 5'-ends, as judged by exonuclease VII protection, and are thus more reactive. The ability of linear ssDNAs with 5'-end homology to react is improved by the presence of low concentrations of exonuclease VII. In reactions between ssDNAs and linear dsDNAs with end homology, stable joint molecule formation occurs more efficiently when the homology is at the 3'-end rather than at the 5'-end of the complementary strand. In addition, linear dsDNAs with homology at the 3'-end of the complementary strand react more efficiently with linear ssDNAs with 3'-end homology than with linear ssDNAs with 5'-end homology. The ability of linear ssDNAs with 5'-end homology to react, in the absence of single-stranded DNA-binding protein, is improved by adding 33-46 nucleotides of heterologous sequence to the 5'-end of the linear ssDNA. The poor reactivity of linear ssDNAs with 5'-end homology is explained by a lack of RecA at the 5'-ends of linear ssDNAs, which is a consequence of the polar association and dissociation of RecA."
https://openalex.org/W1559132594,"The receptors for epidermal growth factor (EGF) and thyroid hormone (T3) are prototypes, respectively, of transmembrane signaling proteins and nuclear transcription regulatory proteins. Oncogenic homologs of these two receptor genes, v-erbB and v-erbA, cooperate with each other in cellular transformation and blockage of erythrocytic differentiation. As a first step toward investigating this cooperation, we have studied the relationship between the normal homologs of these two receptors in A431 cells. Treatment of these cells with T3 has no significant effect on EGF receptor gene transcription but leads to a drastic decrease in the steady-state level of receptor mRNA. The down-regulatory effect is visible by 2 h and persists up to 8 h, but EGF receptor mRNA returns to normal (sometimes higher than normal) level by 48-72 h. The T3-induced decrease in EGF receptor mRNA (found during 2-8 h of T3 treatment) is due to a specific destabilization of EGF receptor mRNA. The 5.6-kb mRNA that encodes the full-length transmembrane EGF receptor is preferentially degraded. The half-life of the 2.6-kb mRNA that encodes the aberrant C-terminally truncated receptor is unaffected by T3. In other studies we found that T3 decreases the rate of synthesis of the full-length EGF receptor protein and reduces its steady-state amount. Overall the results demonstrate a negative regulatory effect of T3 in post-transcriptional control of EGF receptor expression, and raise interesting questions regarding the mechanism of this down-regulation, and the possible roles of T3 receptors in the control of EGF receptor function."
https://openalex.org/W1528053476,"alpha-Helix formation of a peptidyl sequence is stabilized by hydrophobic residues recurring at positions which create a longitudinal hydrophobic strip upon folding of the sequence as a helix against a hydrophobic surface. To test that hypothesis, we measured by circular dichroism the helical coiling on lipid vesicles of nine analogs of a prototypic helix peptide PH-1.0, Leu-Tyr-Gln-Glu-Leu-Gln-Lys-Leu-Thr-Gln-Thr-Leu-Lys. In these analogs, Thr was substituted for 1 or 2 Leu residues in the longitudinal hydrophobic strip Leu1...Leu5..Leu8...Leu12 which forms in the alpha-helical configuration. We found that coiling of analogs of Leu-Tyr-Gln-Glu-Leu-Gln-Lys-Leu-Tyr-Gln-Thr-Leu-Lys on lipid vesicles depends upon the strength and structure of its longitudinal hydrophobic strip."

(1986) Biomed. Res. (Tokyo) 7, 47-51). F-21 was isolated from the nervous tissue of Aplysia in this study, and its chemical structure was characterized as follows, where 2-AEP is 2-aminoethylphosphonate. (Formula; see text) The major aliphatic components of the ceramide portion were palmitic acid (75%), stearic acid (22%), octadeca-4-sphingenine (43%), and anteisononadeca-4-sphingenine (54%). Some information on the steric interactions in the sugar moiety was obtained by NMR spectroscopy. The ring protons of the internal galactose, H1, H3, and H4 and the H3 of the side chain galactose were shifted, as compared to the corresponding protons of dephosphonylated F-21. This may indicate the interactions between the 2-AEP residue of N-acetylgalactosamine and the internal galactose and between the N-acetyl group of N-acetylgalactosamine and the side chain galactose, implying a sterically restricted and unique structure that may relate to some biological functions of F-21."

https://openalex.org/W1487329351,"Cytochrome P-450 (P-450) is a generic name of heme proteins which have the catalytic activity for monooxygenation of a variety of organic compounds. In their catalytic reaction one oxygen atom of the heme-bound dioxygen is incorporated into a substrate while the other oxygen atom is converted into water. The question to be answered is whether the dioxygen bound to P-450 differs from those of other heme proteins. The O-O stretching (v OO) frequency is expected to reflect most sensitively the nature of the O-O bond. Bangcharoenpaurpong et al. [1] succeeded in observing the v OO RR band for noncatalytic O2 adduct of frozen P-450cam with no electron donor present at -6° C and it was recently confirmed for a solution at -20° C by Nishimura et al. [2]. The observed v OO frequency was, unexpectedly, very close to that of oxy-myoglobin (oxyMb) in which the heme bound dioxygen is nonreactive. We thought it important to detect the v OO RR band for oxy P-450cam under catalytic conditions, that is, at room temperature in the presence of electron donor (reduced putidaredoxin; Pdr) and substrate (D-camphor). Since the reaction becomes faster under such conditions (It is reported that Pdr and P-450cam is associate to form a bimolecular complex and the life time of oxy P-450 m is made significantly shorter by formation of the complex [3]), it is hard to detect oxy P-450cam with an ordinary technique. Accordingly, we applied a home made mixed-flow transient Raman apparatus to observe the v OO RR band successfully."
