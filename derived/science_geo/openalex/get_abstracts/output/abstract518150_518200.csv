https://openalex.org/W2006103193,"Background The Global Burden of Disease Study 2010 (GBD 2010), estimated that a substantial proportion of the world’s disease burden came from mental, neurological and substance use disorders. In this paper, we used GBD 2010 data to investigate time, year, region and age specific trends in burden due to mental, neurological and substance use disorders. Method For each disorder, prevalence data were assembled from systematic literature reviews. DisMod-MR, a Bayesian meta-regression tool, was used to model prevalence by country, region, age, sex and year. Prevalence data were combined with disability weights derived from survey data to estimate years lived with disability (YLDs). Years lost to premature mortality (YLLs) were estimated by multiplying deaths occurring as a result of a given disorder by the reference standard life expectancy at the age death occurred. Disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) were computed as the sum of YLDs and YLLs. Results In 2010, mental, neurological and substance use disorders accounted for 10.4% of global DALYs, 2.3% of global YLLs and, 28.5% of global YLDs, making them the leading cause of YLDs. Mental disorders accounted for the largest proportion of DALYs (56.7%), followed by neurological disorders (28.6%) and substance use disorders (14.7%). DALYs peaked in early adulthood for mental and substance use disorders but were more consistent across age for neurological disorders. Females accounted for more DALYs in all mental and neurological disorders, except for mental disorders occurring in childhood, schizophrenia, substance use disorders, Parkinson’s disease and epilepsy where males accounted for more DALYs. Overall DALYs were highest in Eastern Europe/Central Asia and lowest in East Asia/the Pacific. Conclusion Mental, neurological and substance use disorders contribute to a significant proportion of disease burden. Health systems can respond by implementing established, cost effective interventions, or by supporting the research necessary to develop better prevention and treatment options."

More often, we jostle around in one of several bulging crowds that merge haphazardly near the gate. Roughly speaking, these processes are analogous to the chain growth and step growth mechanisms of polymer assembly at the molecular level. Kang et al. present a strategy to link molecular building blocks through hydrogen bonding in accord with the well-controlled chain growth model. The molecules start out curled inward, as they engage in internal hydrogen bonding, until an initiator pulls one open; that molecule is then in the right conformation to pull a partner into the growing chain, poising it to pull in yet another, and so forth down the line.

However, the path from genotype to phenotype remains murky. Battle et al. examine how an individual's genetic variation affects expression of RNA, ribosome occupancy, and protein levels. They find that RNA expression and ribosome occupancy are generally correlated. However, in contrast, protein levels appear not to depend on RNA levels or ribosome occupancy. Protein levels are thus regulated by posttranscriptional mechanisms. Science , this issue p. 664"

If these defects can be “pinned” by adding alloying elements, it should be possible to create a stronger alloy. It was thought that there shouldn't be much of an interaction between screw dislocations and any alloying elements. However, Yu et al. show that for α-Ti, the profound hardening effect of oxygen is due to the strong interactions with the core of the dislocations.

Lipid nanoparticles display many properties that make them excellent drug delivery vehicles, including the ability to enhance drug stability and solubility and alter drug pharmacokinetics to achieve higher drug concentrations in target tissues (1.van der Meel R.

Biologically derived nanoparticles are an emerging subset of lipid nanoparticles that have been shown to effectively deliver a wide range of functional biomolecules, evade or dampen immune responses, and accumulate in tumors (2.Lai C.P.

In particular, exosomes, which are endosomally derived secreted vesicles, have shown great promise as therapeutic delivery vehicles (5.Marcus M.E. Leonard J.N.

Based on these successes, exosomes are now being investigated in clinical trials as delivery vehicles for cancer vaccines and small molecule drugs (13.György B. Hung M.E. Breakefield X.O. Leonard J.N. Therapeutic applications of extracellular vesicles: clinical promise and open questions.Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2015; 55: 439-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). An attractive property of lipid nanoparticle-based drug delivery is the potential to target lipid nanoparticles for uptake by specific recipient cells by functionalizing these particles with ligands that bind receptors on recipient cells. The addition of targeting ligands to lipid nanoparticles enhances their uptake and retention in the desired recipient cell type or tissue. The addition of peptide-based targeting ligands to synthetic lipid nanoparticles is nontrivial as peptide ligands affect the stability and material properties of the lipid nanoparticle and increase the complexity of synthesis (14.Kraft J.C.

Sci. 2014; 103: 29-52Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). In contrast, displaying targeting ligands on exosomes is relatively simple because peptide ligands can be genetically fused to the extra-exosomal termini of exosomal membrane proteins. This strategy has been applied to target exosome uptake by neurons by fusing a rabies viral glycoprotein (RVG) 3The abbreviations used are: RVGrabies viral glycoproteinLamp2blysosomal associated membrane protein 2b. peptide to the N terminus of lysosomal associated membrane protein 2b (Lamp2b) (7.Alvarez-Erviti L.

Biotechnol. 2011; 29: 341-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (2981) Google Scholar). Such a fusion resulted in RVG peptide being displayed on the surface of exosomes, leading to exosome uptake via the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor. Similarly, an internalizing RGD peptide fused to the N terminus of Lamp2b was used to target exosomes to breast cancer cells via αvβ3 integrins (11.Tian Y. Li S. Song J. Ji T. Zhu M. Anderson G.J. Wei J. Nie G. A doxorubicin delivery platform using engineered natural membrane vesicle exosomes for targeted tumor therapy.Biomaterials. 2014; 35: 2383-2390Crossref PubMed Scopus (1133) Google Scholar). One alternative to Lamp2b, the transmembrane domain of platelet-derived growth factor receptor, has also been used as a fusion partner to display peptides on the surface of exosomes (8.Ohno S. Takanashi M. Sudo K. Ueda S. Ishikawa A. Matsuyama N. Fujita K. Mizutani T. Ohgi T. Ochiya T. Gotoh N. Kuroda M. Systemically injected exosomes targeted to EGFR deliver antitumor microRNA to breast cancer cells.Mol. Ther. 2013; 21: 185-191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1143) Google Scholar). However, it is not known whether such platelet-derived growth factor receptor fusion proteins localize to endosomally derived exosomes or rather to extracellular vesicles that bud from the plasma membrane. Finally, fusion of peptides to the C1C2 domain of lactadherin has been used to display peptides on the surface of exosomes for vaccines (15.Zeelenberg I.S. Ostrowski M. Krumeich S. Bobrie A. Jancic C. Boissonnas A. Delcayre A. Le Pecq J.B. Combadière B. Amigorena S. Théry C. Targeting tumor antigens to secreted membrane vesicles in vivo induces efficient antitumor immune responses.Cancer Res. 2008; 68: 1228-1235Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). However, lactadherin is a membrane-associated protein (16.Véron P. Segura E. Sugano G. Amigorena S. Théry C. Accumulation of MFG-E8/lactadherin on exosomes from immature dendritic cells.Blood Cells Mol. Dis. 2005; 35: 81-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), not an integral membrane protein. Thus, peptides fused to lactadherin may be closely associated with the membrane, rather than freely accessible to interact with cell receptors. rabies viral glycoprotein lysosomal associated membrane protein 2b. Despite these successes, achieving efficient exosome targeting via surface display of targeting peptides is nontrivial. Although Alvarez-Erviti et al. (7.Alvarez-Erviti L. Seow Y. Yin H. Betts C. Lakhal S. Wood M.J. Delivery of siRNA to the mouse brain by systemic injection of targeted exosomes.Nat. Biotechnol. 2011; 29: 341-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (2981) Google Scholar) achieved neuronal targeting of exosomes via display of the RVG peptide, they were unable to achieve muscle targeting via display of a muscle-specific peptide similarly fused to Lamp2b. This suggests that different target-binding peptides may have different utility as exosome-targeting peptides, possibly due to variations in target binding affinity or level of peptide display on the exosome surface, or a combination of these factors. In this study, we demonstrate that some peptides fused to the N terminus of Lamp2b are not displayed effectively on the surface of exosomes. However, this display can be enhanced by introducing frequently glycosylated motifs at particular locations within the engineered fusion protein. We hypothesize that engineered glycosylation protects the targeting peptides from degradation in the endosomal system during exosome biogenesis and secretion. We also demonstrate that some glycosylation-protected peptides retain the ability to bind their target proteins and that this peptide protection strategy can be applied to targeting peptides displayed on the surface of exosomes. Human Lamp2b cDNA was purchased from Open Biosystems and inserted into pcDNA3.1+ Hygro backbone. Peptide tags and glycine-serine amino acid spacers were added to the N and C termini of Lamp2b by PCR. The following tags were used: FLAG (DYKDDDDK), HA (YPYDVPDYA), and the glycosylation sequon (GNSTM) (17.Bañó-Polo M. Baldin F. Tamborero S. Marti-Renom M.A. Mingarro I. N-Glycosylation efficiency is determined by the distance to the C-terminus and the amino acid preceding an Asn-Ser-Thr sequon.Protein Sci. 2011; 20: 179-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar).

HEK293FT cells (Life Technologies) and Neuro2A cells (gift from Richard Morimoto) were maintained at 37 °C in 5% CO2 in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% penicillin-streptomycin, and 4 mm l-glutamine. HEK293FT cells were plated at ∼60% confluency in 10- or 15-cm dishes, and 1–1.5 μg of DNA/ml was transfected using the CaCl2-HEPES-buffered saline method. Exosome-free medium was generated by pelleting FBS-derived exosomes from DMEM containing 20% FBS (see exosome pelleting protocol below) and combining the cleared supernatant with serum-free DMEM to achieve a final concentration of 10% FBS. HEK293FT cells were transfected with Lamp2b expression plasmids, and medium was changed to exosome-free medium 12–14 h after transfection. Conditioned medium was collected 2 days after medium change, and exosomes were concentrated by differential centrifugation. Conditioned medium was spun at 300 × g for 10 min, 2,000 × g for 10 min, and 10,000 × g for 30 min to remove cells, cell debris, and apoptotic bodies. From this supernatant, exosomes were pelleted at 120,416 × g for 135 min using an SW41 Ti rotor in an L-80 Optima XP ultracentrifuge (Beckman Coulter). Exosome pellets were washed in 10 ml of PBS and pelleted again via ultracentrifugation. Exosome morphology was evaluated by transmission electron microscopy using a 4% uranyl acetate negative stain. Exosome size distribution was profiled by NanoSight (Malvern) analysis. For Western blot analysis, cell extracts were prepared by lysis with radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer. Exosomes were not lysed. Cell lysates, exosomes, and pulldowns were heated in Laemmli buffer at 70 °C. Equal quantities of protein, as measured by BCA assay (Pierce), were loaded in each lane of a 4–15% gradient polyacrylamide gel (Bio-Rad). After transfer to a PVDF membrane (Bio-Rad), membranes were blocked for 1 h in 1% milk at room temperature, and then blotted with anti-HA (Cell Signaling Technology, C29F4), anti-FLAG (Abcam, ab1162), or anti-β-actin (Cell Signaling Technology, 8H10D10) antibodies. Primary antibodies were detected with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse (Invitrogen) or anti-rabbit (Invitrogen and Abcam) immunoglobulin G secondary antibody. For FLAG pulldown experiments, cell lysates or exosomes were precleared with Sepharose beads (Sigma) and then pulled down with FLAG M2 Sepharose beads (Sigma) and eluted with 3× FLAG peptide. When indicated, cell lysates were diluted 1:5 in TBS. HEK293FT cells were transfected with Lamp2b expression plasmids. Cells were treated with 50 nm bafilomycin A1 (Sigma) or an equivalent amount of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) for 9 h, or treated with 50 μm leupeptin (Sigma) for 24 h. Cells were then lysed and evaluated by immunoblotting as described above. After the first ultracentrifuge spin of the exosome isolation procedure described above, exosome pellets (∼0.5 ml) were brought up to 1 ml in Diluent C (PKH67 kit, Sigma). This solution was mixed with 1 ml of Diluent C containing 6 μl of PKH67 dye and mixed via constant pipetting for 1 min. Next, 2 ml of 1% BSA was added to halt staining. 4.5 ml of serum-free medium was added to bring the mixture up to 8.5 ml. Excess PKH67 dye can form micelles similar in size to exosomes, and these micelles cannot be separated from exosomes by ultracentrifugation alone (18.van der Vlist E.J. Nolte-'t Hoen E.N. Stoorvogel W. Arkesteijn G.J. Wauben M.H. Fluorescent labeling of nano-sized vesicles released by cells and subsequent quantitative and qualitative analysis by high-resolution flow cytometry.Nat. Protoc. 2012; 7: 1311-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). We observed that these micelles are less dense than exosomes (in 0.971 m sucrose, dye micelles float and exosomes pellet). 4M. E. Hung and J. N. Leonard, unpublished observation. Thus, exosomes were purified via centrifugation through a 0.971 m sucrose cushion. Briefly, 1.5 ml of 0.971 m sucrose was slowly pipetted underneath the 8.5 ml of exosome solution containing BSA and excess dye. The entire mixture was centrifuged at 191,287 × g for 2 h, and then the upper layer and interface were carefully aspirated. To generate a negative control for estimating uptake of dye micelles, 0.5 ml of serum-free medium was treated as an exosome pellet, labeled with PKH67, and subsequently processed exactly as were the exosome pellet samples. After purification through the sucrose cushion, exosomes were diluted 1:10 in PBS and re-concentrated in 100-kDa cut-off centrifugal filter units (Millipore UFC910024) to reduce the concentration of sucrose. Exosome concentration was then counted via NanoSight, and an equal number of exosomes from each sample (or all of the medium negative control, to be conservative) were added to Neuro2A recipient cells. Recipient cells were plated at 50% confluency in a 48-well plate. Exosomes and cells were incubated for 2 h at 37 °C, as described (11.Tian Y. Li S. Song J. Ji T. Zhu M. Anderson G.J. Wei J. Nie G. A doxorubicin delivery platform using engineered natural membrane vesicle exosomes for targeted tumor therapy.Biomaterials. 2014; 35: 2383-2390Crossref PubMed Scopus (1133) Google Scholar). Cells were then washed with PBS and harvested for flow cytometry. Flow cytometry was performed on an LSRII flow cytometer (BD Bioscience) running FACSDiva software. Data were analyzed using FlowJo software (TreeStar). Live single cells were gated based upon scatter. We hypothesized that peptides fused to the N terminus of Lamp2b would be vulnerable to proteolysis due to their localization in the lumen of endosomes (Fig. 1A). Indeed, when glycosylation is artificially inhibited, Lamp2b is also vulnerable to degradation by endosomal proteases (19.Kundra R. Kornfeld S. Asparagine-linked oligosaccharides protect Lamp-1 and Lamp-2 from intracellular proteolysis.J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31039-31046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). To test this hypothesis, HEK293FT cells were transfected with Lamp2b containing a C-terminal HA tag (Lamp2b-HA), two C-terminal tags (Lamp2b-HA-FLAG), or an N-terminal FLAG tag and a C-terminal HA tag (FLAG-Lamp2b-HA). Cell lysates and exosomes were harvested from these cells, and N-and C-terminal tags were analyzed by Western blots. Exosomes harvested from HEK293FT cells exhibited expected morphology and size (Fig. 1, B and C). As compared with samples derived from whole cells, exosome samples were enriched in the exosomal protein CD63 relative to β-actin (Fig. 1D), as expected. The Lamp2b fusion proteins were expressed at similar levels in cells, as indicated by the HA Western blot. However, the FLAG peptide on FLAG-Lamp2b-HA could not be detected, although the C-terminal FLAG peptide of Lamp2b-HA-FLAG was detected (Fig. 1E). The same pattern was observed in exosomes (Fig. 1F). Together, these data indicate that the FLAG tag was lost from the N terminus of the Lamp2b protein. Glycosylation of the Lamp2b protein protects it from proteolytic degradation (19.Kundra R. Kornfeld S. Asparagine-linked oligosaccharides protect Lamp-1 and Lamp-2 from intracellular proteolysis.J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31039-31046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Therefore, we hypothesized that engineered glycosylation could also protect peptides fused to the N terminus of Lamp2b from proteolysis. To investigate, the amino acid sequence GNSTM was fused to the N terminus of FLAG-Lamp2b-HA. The NST sequence is a standard N-linked glycosylation sequon, and the amino acids G and M flanking the sequon may increase glycosylation frequency in mammals (17.Bañó-Polo M. Baldin F. Tamborero S. Marti-Renom M.A. Mingarro I. N-Glycosylation efficiency is determined by the distance to the C-terminus and the amino acid preceding an Asn-Ser-Thr sequon.Protein Sci. 2011; 20: 179-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). To investigate how proximity to the GNSTM tag impacts targeting peptide stability and availability to bind cellular receptors, fusion proteins were engineered to include flexible amino acid spacers of various lengths between the GNSTM motif, the FLAG tag, and Lamp2b. Fusion protein expression was assessed in cells and exosomes. The GNSTM-tagged Lamp2b proteins accumulated to a greater level in cells than did Lamp2b-HA or FLAG-Lamp2b-HA (Fig. 2A), and this difference was not an artifact of differential transfection efficiency (Fig. 2B). The GNSTM-tagged Lamp2b proteins could also be detected by anti-FLAG Western blot in both cell lysates (Fig. 2C) and in exosomes (Fig. 2D). Notably, increased detection of the FLAG tag was not simply a consequence of increased protein expression (compare FLAG-Lamp2b-HA and GNSTM-3gs-FLAG-3gs-Lamp2b-HA in Fig. 2C, where 3gs indicates a flexible linker 3 amino acids in length comprising glycine and serine residues), although increased detection of the FLAG tag did correlate with increased protein expression. These results suggest that the GNSTM motif effectively confers protection of the N-terminal FLAG peptide. To test whether endosomal acidification was required for loss of the N-terminal FLAG peptide, cells were treated with bafilomycin A1. Bafilomycin A1 treatment preserved the FLAG peptide on FLAG-Lamp2b-HA but had no effect on either the FLAG peptide on the C terminus of Lamp2b-HA-FLAG or the glycosylated FLAG peptide. Inhibiting endosomal proteases with leupeptin yielded the same pattern (Fig. 2E). Together, these data confirm that peptides displayed on the N terminus of Lamp2b are degraded by acid-dependent proteolysis. Moreover, adding the GNSTM glycosylation motif protected such N-terminal peptides from this degradation. We next investigated whether GNSTM tag-stabilized peptide-Lamp2b fusion proteins retained the capacity to interact with binding partners. GNSTM-tagged FLAG-Lamp2b proteins were successfully pulled down by anti-FLAG beads in both cell lysates and intact exosomes (Fig. 3, A and B). To verify that pulldown was FLAG-specific and not an artifact due to increased loading of the highly expressed GNSTM-tagged proteins, lysates from cells expressing GNSTM-tagged proteins were diluted 1:5 such that the amount of this Lamp2b fusion protein loaded into the pulldown was comparable with the amounts in FLAG-Lamp2b-HA and Lamp2b-HA samples. This pulldown indicated that the FLAG peptide was indeed necessary for pulldown (Fig. 3C). Moreover, FLAG-dependent pulldown efficiency was much greater for some GNSTM-tagged Lamp2b constructs as compared with the FLAG-Lamp2b-HA control. Also, pulldown of intact exosomes required that FLAG be on the exosome exterior because exosomes from cells expressing Lamp2b-HA-FLAG were not pulled down (Fig. 3D). Collectively, these results indicate that the GNSTM motif can protect targeting peptides fused to the N terminus of Lamp2b from degradation without precluding interactions between these peptides and their cognate protein targets. We next evaluated whether our engineered glycosylation approach is compatible with a demonstrated exosome targeting strategy. To this end, we utilized the system described by Alvarez-Erviti et al. (7.Alvarez-Erviti L. Seow Y. Yin H. Betts C. Lakhal S. Wood M.J. Delivery of siRNA to the mouse brain by systemic injection of targeted exosomes.Nat. Biotechnol. 2011; 29: 341-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (2981) Google Scholar), in which display of the RVG peptide on exosomes mediated delivery to Neuro2A neuroblastoma cells. The RVG peptide was fused to the N terminus of Lamp2b along with either a GNSTM glycosylation motif or a mutated motif, GASTM, which is not glycosylated. Exosomes displaying GNSTM-FLAG-Lamp2b-HA were also included as negative controls. All exosomes were labeled with the lipophilic dye PKH67, and equal numbers of exosomes from each sample were incubated with Neuro2A cells for 2 h. Notably, uptake of GNSTM-RVG exosomes exceeded uptake of either GASTM-RVG or GNSTM-FLAG exosomes (Fig. 4, A and B). Moreover, only the glycosylated RVG peptides mediated exosome uptake greater than was observed for negative control exosomes. Thus, in this system, engineered glycosylation of the targeting peptide did not prevent targeted exosome uptake, and indeed glycosylation was required to confer targeted exosome uptake. In this study, we found that peptides expressed on the N terminus of Lamp2b are susceptible to acid-dependent proteolytic degradation and that the glycosylation motif GNSTM protects such peptides from degradation. This strategy allows for the display of targeting peptides on the surface of exosomes. Furthermore, the GNSTM motif does not interfere with interactions between targeting peptides and their cognate protein targets. Indeed, in our hands, the GNSTM motif enhanced targeting peptide-mediated exosome uptake. In our investigation, the GNSTM motif conferred protection to peptides over a distance of at least 10 flexible amino acids, and larger spacers may also be feasible. Thus, there may exist a substantial design space for applying this strategy to many peptides of interest to ensure stable expression while avoiding interference with peptide-target interactions, although some optimization is likely to be required. Engineered glycosylation could also be useful for investigating and refining problematic exosome targeting strategies because without such modifications, candidate peptides may fail to enhance exosome uptake due to peptide loss rather than due to problems inherent to the targeting approach. In addition to protecting N-terminal peptides from degradation, adding the GNSTM motif increased the total amount of Lamp2b fusion protein present in cells and exosomes. This increase could be due to decreased degradation because increasing the glycosylation of Lamp1 and Lamp2 during differentiation of the HL-60 promyelocytic cell line into granulocytes increases the half-life of these proteins (20.Lee N. Wang W.C. Fukuda M. Granulocytic differentiation of HL-60 cells is associated with increase of poly-N-acetyllactosamine in Asn-linked oligosaccharides attached to human lysosomal membrane glycoproteins.J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20476-20487Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, in this case, the complexity of the oligosaccharides on the proteins was increased, not the number of glycosylation sites. Because Lamp2b is already expected to include 16–20 N-linked glycosylation sites (19.Kundra R. Kornfeld S. Asparagine-linked oligosaccharides protect Lamp-1 and Lamp-2 from intracellular proteolysis.J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31039-31046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), whether adding one additional glycosylation site could increase the half-life of Lamp2b is unclear. Glycosylation also plays a role in the expression and sorting of other exosomal proteins. For example, sorting of the protein EWI-2 into exosomes is dependent on the presence of complex N-linked glycans on this protein (21.Liang Y. Eng W.S. Colquhoun D.R. Dinglasan R.R. Graham D.R. Mahal L.K. Complex N-linked glycans serve as a determinant for exosome/microvesicle cargo recruitment.J. Biol. Chem. 2014; 289: 32526-32537Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Mutation of even one of three N-linked glycosylation sites significantly decreased EWI-2 expression in extracellular vesicles. Furthermore, mutation of all three sites decreased both cellular and vesicle-associated EWI-2 levels. Thus, it is possible that altering the glycosylation of Lamp2b could have similar effects on expression in cells and exosomes. Previous studies in which targeting peptides were fused to the N terminus of Lamp2b did not report targeting peptide degradation, although these characterizations focused on evaluating whether targeting peptide remained, rather than evaluating whether or not partial targeting peptide degradation occurred (7.Alvarez-Erviti L. Seow Y. Yin H. Betts C. Lakhal S. Wood M.J. Delivery of siRNA to the mouse brain by systemic injection of targeted exosomes.Nat. Biotechnol. 2011; 29: 341-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (2981) Google Scholar, 11.Tian Y. Li S. Song J. Ji T. Zhu M. Anderson G.J. Wei J. Nie G. A doxorubicin delivery platform using engineered natural membrane vesicle exosomes for targeted tumor therapy.Biomaterials. 2014; 35: 2383-2390Crossref PubMed Scopus (1133) Google Scholar). Notably, neither of the peptides used in these studies (RVG or internalizing RGD) contains any putative N-linked glycosylation sites that could protect the peptides from degradation. However, in these studies, exosomes were electroporated to load functional cargo molecules, and subsequent investigations have shown that electroporation can cause aggregation of exosomes as well as RNA (22.Hood J.L. Scott M.J. Wickline S.A. Maximizing exosome colloidal stability following electroporation.Anal. Biochem. 2014; 448: 41-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 23.Kooijmans S.A. Stremersch S. Braeckmans K. de Smedt S.C. Hendrix A. Wood M.J. Schiffelers R.M. Raemdonck K. Vader P. Electroporation-induced siRNA precipitation obscures the efficiency of siRNA loading into extracellular vesicles.J. Control. Release. 2013; 172: 229-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that such aggregates may display different properties than did the exosomes used in our experiments. Furthermore, these prior studies utilized the mouse Lamp2b protein and isolated exosomes from murine dendritic cells, whereas we engineered human Lamp2b and isolated exosomes from human cells (HEK293FT). Thus, differences in protein trafficking and exosome secretion in different species and cell types may result in different susceptibilities of targeting peptides to degradation. Alternatively, any factors leading to increased stability of mouse Lamp2b-based constructs may lead to accumulation of higher levels of Lamp2b in cells and exosomes, such that some pool of intact peptide-Lamp2b escapes proteolytic cleavage prior to exosome secretion. Thus, the strategy proposed here may be especially important for engineering human Lamp2b and human cell-derived exosomes, and whether these benefits may extend to murine exosome engineering remains to be determined. Because targeting exosomes to specific receptors is required for effective delivery of therapeutic molecules in vivo (7.Alvarez-Erviti L. Seow Y. Yin H. Betts C. Lakhal S. Wood M.J. Delivery of siRNA to the mouse brain by systemic injection of targeted exosomes.Nat. Biotechnol. 2011; 29: 341-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (2981) Google Scholar, 11.Tian Y. Li S. Song J. Ji T. Zhu M. Anderson G.J. Wei J. Nie G. A doxorubicin delivery platform using engineered natural membrane vesicle exosomes for targeted tumor therapy.Biomaterials. 2014; 35: 2383-2390Crossref PubMed Scopus (1133) Google Scholar), our strategy for increasing the expression of targeting peptides on exosomes may be particularly useful for translating promising exosome-based therapeutic strategies from preclinical investigations to human trials. Even if mouse Lamp2b could confer enhanced targeting peptide display when expressed in human exosome-producing cells (which remains undetermined), utilizing human Lamp2b is desirable to increase the immune compatibility of exosome-based therapeutics (24.Neefjes J. Ovaa H. A peptide's perspective on antigen presentation to the immune system.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2013; 9: 769-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Our strategy for enhancing peptide display via human Lamp2b could also increase peptide display via other exosomal membrane proteins because all such peptide fusions may be susceptible to degradation by endosomal proteases. Given the need for robust technologies for effectively directing exosomes to traffic to specific destinations in vivo, this strategy for enhancing display of targeting peptides could generally enable and enhance exosome-based therapeutics.

https://openalex.org/W2952019963,"In this paper we revisit the classic theory of forest succession that relates shade tolerance and species replacement and assess its validity to understand patch-mosaic patterns of forested ecosystems of the USA. We introduce a macroscopic parameter called the ""shade tolerance index"" and compare it to the classic continuum index in southern Wisconsin forests. We exemplify shade tolerance driven succession in White Pine-Eastern Hemlock forests using computer simulations and analyzing approximated chronosequence data from the USDA FIA forest inventory. We describe this parameter across the last 50 years in the ecoregions of mainland USA, and demonstrate that it does not correlate with the usual macroscopic characteristics of stand age, biomass, basal area, and biodiversity measures. We characterize the dynamics of shade tolerance index using transition matrices and delimit geographical areas based on the relevance of shade tolerance to explain forest succession. We conclude that shade tolerance driven succession is linked to climatic variables and can be considered as a primary driving factor of forest dynamics mostly in central-north and northeastern areas in the USA. Overall, the shade tolerance index constitutes a new quantitative approach that can be used to understand and predict succession of forested ecosystems and biogeographic patterns."

Almost all plant cells are encased in a cell wall composed primarily of complex polysaccharides (1Albersheim P. Darvill A. Roberts K. Sederoff R. Staehelin A. Plant Cell Walls: from Chemistry to Biology. Garland Science, New York2011: 37-47Google Scholar). Load-bearing components, principally cellulose and hemicelluloses, are embedded in a matrix of pectic polysaccharides, and in mature secondary walls, further reinforcement is provided by the phenolic polymer lignin (2Carpita N.C.

Collectively, plant cell walls are also the largest source of biomass on earth and have received considerable attention in the context of attempts to produce second generation biofuels and chemicals from lignocellulosic feedstocks as an alternative renewable source to fossil fuels (7Jørgensen H.

Techniques for mining genomes and metagenomes have developed rapidly in recent years, and so have medium and high throughput strategies for cloning and expressing recombinant enzymes. Furthermore, bioinformatics resources and associated depositories, such as the carbohydrate-active enzymes database (CAZy) (17Cantarel B.L. Coutinho P.M. Rancurel C. Bernard T. Lombard V. Henrissat B. The Carbohydrate-Active EnZymes database (CAZy): an expert resource for glycogenomics.Nucleic Acids Res. 2009; 37: D233-D238Crossref PubMed Scopus (4114) Google Scholar) have expanded greatly. However, there are considerable challenges inherent in the exploitation of microbial enzyme diversity for industrial purposes, and the empirical determination of enzyme activities has now become a serious bottleneck. For example, it is estimated that, using current methods, we can safely predict the activities of no more than 4% of the proteins within the CAZy (18Lombard V. Golaconda Ramulu H. Drula E. Coutinho P.M. Henrissat B. The carbohydrate-active enzymes database (CAZy) in 2013.Nucleic Acids Res. 2014; 42: D490-D495Crossref PubMed Scopus (4115) Google Scholar). Although numerous methods are available for monitoring enzyme activities, they generally have some limitations. Well established techniques based on the analysis of the oligomeric fragments produced by enzymatic hydrolysis, such as chromatography combined with mass spectrometry, are available (19Peña M.J. Tuomivaara S.T. Urbanowicz B.R. O’Neill M.A. York W.S. Methods for structural characterization of the products of cellulose- and xyloglucan-hydrolyzing enzymes.Methods Enzymol. 2012; 510: 121-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). These approaches are powerful; however, they are labor-intensive and generally not suitable for high throughput screening. Methods based on the measurement of reducing sugars such as the 3,5-dinitrosalicylic acid (20Miller G.L. Use of dinitrosalicylic acid reagent for determination of reducing sugar.Anal. Chem. 1959; 31: 426-428Crossref Scopus (22220) Google Scholar) and the Nelson-Somogyi (21Somogyi M. Notes on sugar determination.J. Biol. Chem. 1952; 195: 19-23Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) assays are widely used for rapidly screening GH activities. However, these assays lack polysaccharide specificity because reducing ends from different polysaccharides cannot be distinguished. Chromogenic polysaccharide substrates, such as azurine cross-linked (AZCL) and azo-dyed polymers, are extensively used to screen endo-acting GHs, but the current range of available substrates is limited, and the nature of the chemical modification of these polysaccharides renders them unsuitable substrates for other types of enzymes including esterases and exo-acting GHs. Exo-acting enzymes can be analyzed with para-nitrophenyl substrates, but these compounds can usually only provide information about the degradation of one substrate per reaction and are not effective substrates for all exo-acting enzymes (22Honda Y. Kitaoka M. A family 8 glycoside hydrolase from Bacillus halodurans C-125 (BH2105) is a reducing end xylose-releasing exo-oligoxylanase.J. Biol.

There is therefore a pressing need for the development of new technology for the rapid screening of GHs and other carbohydrate-active enzymes. We describe the development of a semiquantitative method that combines the multiplexing capacity of robotically produced microarrays with the specificity of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and carbohydrate binding modules (CBMs). The method is versatile and can be used to assess enzyme activities against both pure substrates and complex mixtures of cell wall components. In addition to GH activities, the technique can be used for the analysis of other polysaccharide-modifying enzymes including carbohydrate esterases, polysaccharide lyases, and lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases. We demonstrate the applicability of the technique for identifying the activities of novel putative enzymes and for screening crude fungal culture broths.

A, three enzymes (xyloglucanase at 0. 001 unit/ml, endo-1,3-β-glucanase at 0.01 unit/ml, and polygalacturonase at 0.01 unit/ml) and an enzyme mixture (Cellic Ctec2 used at 1:20 dilution) listed to the right were tested against the two mixtures of substrates shown to the left, and activities were detected with the probes listed at the top of the heat map. The -fold change values in the heat map show that individual activities can be resolved from the substrate mixtures by the specific binding of the probes. Reactions were performed for 1 h at 40 °C. B, similarly, a crude recombinant A. nidulans endo-1,4-β-mannanase culture broth was also tested against a mixture of polysaccharide substrates. Note that side activities progressively diminished with decreasing broth concentration (shown to the right). Reactions were performed for 1 h at 30 °C. A and B, substrate mixtures contained 0.1 mg/ml (per polysaccharide). RGI, rhamnogalacturonan I; AX, arabinoxylan.

The amplicons were cloned as described (25Vincentelli R. Cimino A. Geerlof A. Kubo A. Satou Y. Cambillau C. High-throughput protein expression screening and purification in Escherichia coli.Methods. 2011; 55: 65-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), and recombinant proteins Pm12, Pm23, and Pm25 were expressed in fusion with a polyhistidine tag, whereas Pm83, Pm84, and Pm85 were produced in fusion with a polyhistidine-thioredoxin tag. Plasmids were used to transform Escherichia coli Rosetta DE3 (Merck Millipore, Germany). For protein expression, the autoinducing medium ZYP-5052 (prepared as described in Ref. 26Studier F.W. Protein production by auto-induction in high-density shaking cultures.Protein Expr. Purif. 2005; 41: 207-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (4109) Google Scholar) supplemented with chloramphenicol (34 μg/ml) was used. Cells were incubated at 37 °C for 5 h and at 17 °C overnight in baffled flasks until an A600 nm of ∼11 was reached. Immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography was performed following the protocol described previously (27Bastien G. Arnal G. Bozonnet S. Laguerre S. Ferreira F. Fauré R. Henrissat B. Lefèvre F.

Biofuels. 2013; 6: 78Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) for purification of the recombinant proteins. The concentration of purified proteins was determined using a NanoDrop ND-1000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and applying the Beer-Lambert law. The theoretical extinction coefficient and molecular weight values were determined using the ProtParam service. Sequence data can be found in GenBankTM under the following accession numbers: CCO21106.1 (Pm12), CCO21108.1 (Pm23), CCO21110.1 (Pm25), CCO21640.1 (Pm83), CCO21632.1 (Pm84), and CCO21658.1 (Pm85). Fungal broth supernatants (Fig. 13) were prepared as follows. Baffled Erlenmeyer flasks (500 ml) with 200 ml of Czapek Dox-based medium with apple pomace (35.3 mm NaNO3, 5.7 mm K2HPO4, 6.7 mm KCl, 2 mm MgSO4, 1 g of Triton-X (0.1%), 1 ml of trace metal solution (36 mm FeSO4, 11.5 mm ZnSO4, 17.5 mm CuSO4) and 20 g of ground apple pomace in 1000 ml of Milli-Q water) were autoclaved and afterward inoculated with ¼ agar plate of Trametes versicolor (DSM-11269, Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen, Germany), 1 × 104 spores of Colletotrichum acutatum (isolate SA 0-1, proprietary), or 1 × 104 spores of Penicillium expansum (isolate IK 2020, proprietary) or mock-inoculated as a negative control. The flasks were incubated at 25 °C with shaking at 150 rpm for 7 days in darkness. Samples were collected from day 2 to 7 under sterile conditions and centrifuged twice for 20 min at 4000 rpm at 4 °C to separate spores from supernatants. Supernatants were collected, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C until use. Commercial enzymes were analyzed within their recommended pH range using the following buffers: 0.1 m sodium acetate buffer for pH values 4.0–6.5 and 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer for pH values 7.0–8.0 except for pH 2–10 analysis where 0.1 m Britton-Robinson buffer was used (Fig. 7). The rest of the samples were analyzed using the following buffers: the eNZ1–4 in 50 mm sodium acetate at pH 5.5; the 24 crude broths (Fig. 6) and the recombinant A. nidulans endo-1,4-β-mannanase broth (Fig. 9B) in 0.1 m sodium acetate, pH 5.5 and pH 5.0, respectively; NcLPMO9C in 0.1 m sodium phosphate, pH 8.0; P. militaris proteins in 0.1 m sodium acetate, pH 6.5; and fungal broths (Fig. 13) in 0.2 m sodium acetate, pH 6. Enzyme concentrations used are given in the figure legends. The following defined polysaccharides were used in this work: arabinan (sugar beet), arabinoxylan (wheat flour), β-glucan (barley), β-glucan lichenan (icelandic moss), galactomannan (carob), glucomannan (konjac), pachyman (1,3-β-d-glucan), pectic galactan (lupin), and xyloglucan (tamarind) from Megazyme; gum arabic (acacia tree), hydroxyethylcellulose, and xylan (beechwood) from Sigma-Aldrich; pectin with degrees of methyl esterification (DEs) of 11, 16, and 81% (lime) from DuPont Nutrition Biosciences (Brabrand, Denmark); and feruloylated arabinoxylan (wheat flour) from Institut National de la Recherche Agronomique (Nantes, France). Polysaccharide substrates used in Fig. 10 were extracted as described (28Moller I. Sørensen I. Bernal A.J. Blaukopf C. Lee K. Øbro J. Pettolino F. Roberts A. Mikkelsen J.D. Knox J.P. Bacic A. Willats W.G. High-throughput mapping of cell-wall polymers within and between plants using novel microarrays.Plant J. 2007; 50: 1118-1128Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Briefly, cell wall polysaccharides were extracted from the alcohol-insoluble residues of Arabidopsis thaliana (rosette), Salix alba (willow with bark), Zea mays (corn stover, whole), Hordeum vulgare (barley, stem, and leaves), and Equisetum arvense (horsetail, stem, and leaves). Sequential extractions with 50 mm CDTA and 4 m sodium hydroxide (NaOH) with 1% (v/v) NaBH4 were performed. Extracts were neutralized to pH 6–7 with glacial acetic acid. Defined polysaccharides were dissolved in deionized water to 4 mg/ml except for pachyman, which was dissolved in 4 m NaOH. Afterward both single polysaccharides and polysaccharide mixtures were prepared by diluting them in printing buffer (55.2% glycerol, 44% water, 0.8% Triton X-100). Substrate concentrations used (generally 0.1 mg/ml) are specified in the figure legends. Substrate mixtures contained each polysaccharide at the same concentration. Additionally, the pH of pachyman solution was neutralized with glacial acetic acid considering final concentration. Regarding the plant extracted polysaccharides (Fig. 10), a 2-fold dilution followed by a 5-fold dilution was performed in printing buffer. Substrate solutions (defined polysaccharides or plant extracts) were added into wells of 384-microwell plates (PP microplate, V-shape, catalogue number 781280, Greiner Bio-One), and afterward the enzymatic samples were added (substrate/sample, 1:1, v/v) to a final volume of 20 μl/well. Controls were prepared for each substrate solution without enzyme, keeping all other conditions identical. Each reaction was performed in triplicate (except plant extracts that had duplicates at two different concentrations). The filled plates were incubated (Ecotron, INFORS HT, Switzerland) at 100 rpm for a specific time and temperature (specified in the figure legends) followed by 10 min at 80 °C. After spinning down the plates for 10 min at 4000 rpm, the plate content was printed at 22 °C and 55% humidity onto nitrocellulose membrane with a pore size of 0.45 μm (Whatman) using a microarray robot (Sprint, Arrayjet, Roslin, UK). The printed arrays were blocked for 1 h in PBS (140 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 10 mm Na2HPO4, 1.7 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.5) with 5% (w/v) low fat milk powder (MPBS). Then arrays were incubated for 2 h with probes (for details, see Table 2) that for the different experiments included anti-rat and anti-mouse mAbs and CBMs (PlantProbes, Leeds, UK; Institut National de la Recherche Agronomique, Nantes, France; BioSupplies, Bundoora, Australia; and NZYTech, Lisbon, Portugal). Probes were diluted 1:10, 1:1000, and 10 μg/ml, respectively, in MPBS. Afterward arrays were washed thoroughly in PBS and incubated for 2 h with anti-rat, anti-mouse, or anti-His tag secondary antibodies conjugated to alkaline phosphatase (Sigma) diluted 1:5000 (anti-rat and anti-mouse) or 1:1500 (anti-His tag) in MPBS. Once washed in PBS and deionized water, microarrays were developed in a solution containing 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolylphosphate and nitro blue tetrazolium in alkaline phosphatase buffer (100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 100 mm diethanolamine, pH 9.5).TABLE 2Specificities of monoclonal antibodies and CBMs used in this studyProbeRecognized epitopeRef.JIM5Partially methyl-esterified/de-esterified HG44Clausen M.H.

https://openalex.org/W2051764748,"Obesity is a risk factor for breast cancer, largely due to altered expression of various adipocytokines. As it concerns adiponectin, there are not univocal results regarding its role in breast cancer occurrence and progression. Here, we demonstrate that in animals injected with human estrogen receptor (ER)-α-negative MDA-MB-231 cells pre treated with adiponectin (1 and 5 μg/ml), a significant reduction (60 and 40%, respectively) in tumor volume is observed, whereas an increased tumor growth (54 and 109%, respectively) is evidenced in the animals receiving human ER-α-positive MCF-7 cells. Moreover, cyclin D1 (CD1) mRNA and protein levels are decreased in MDA-MB-231 cells, whereas they are up-regulated in ER-α-positive cells by adiponectin. These findings fit with the opposite effects of adiponectin on CD1 promoter: 0.44- and 0.34-fold decrease in MDA-MB-231 cells and 0.63- and 0.95-fold increase in MCF-7 cells, treated with 1 and 5 μg/ml, respectively. Functional studies indicate that these effects are mediated by the specific protein 1 motif located in the CD1 promoter. In the absence of ER-α, the adiponectin-mediated down-regulation of CD1 involves the recruitment of corepressors. In the presence of ER-α, the adiponectin-induced expression of CD1 requires the involvement of an activator complex. In conclusion, we propose that a possible mechanism through which adiponectin differently affects breast cancer growth is the opposite modulation of CD1 levels accordingly to ER-α expression.—Mauro, L., Pellegrino, M., Giordano, F., Ricchio, E., Rizza, P., De Amicis, F., Catalano, S., Bonofiglio, D., Panno, M.

https://openalex.org/W1997261511,"Recent studies have implicated epigenetics in the pathophysiology of diabetes. Furthermore, DNA methylation, which irreversibly deactivates gene transcription, of the insulin promoter, particularly the cAMP response element, is increased in diabetes patients. However, the underlying mechanism remains unclear. We aimed to investigate insulin promoter DNA methylation in an over-nutrition state. INS-1 cells, the rat pancreatic beta cell line, were cultured under normal-culture-glucose (11.2 mmol/l) or experimental-high-glucose (22.4 mmol/l) conditions for 14 days, with or without 0.4 mmol/l palmitate. DNA methylation of the rat insulin 1 gene (Ins1) promoter was investigated using bisulfite sequencing and pyrosequencing analysis. Experimental-high-glucose conditions significantly suppressed insulin mRNA and increased DNA methylation at all five CpG sites within the Ins1 promoter, including the cAMP response element, in a time-dependent and glucose concentration-dependent manner. DNA methylation under experimental-high-glucose conditions was unique to the Ins1 promoter; however, palmitate did not affect DNA methylation. Artificial methylation of Ins1 promoter significantly suppressed promoter-driven luciferase activity, and a DNA methylation inhibitor significantly improved insulin mRNA suppression by experimental-high-glucose conditions. Experimental-high-glucose conditions significantly increased DNA methyltransferase activity and decreased ten-eleven-translocation methylcytosine dioxygenase activity. Oxidative stress and endoplasmic reticulum stress did not affect DNA methylation of the Ins1 promoter. High glucose but not palmitate increased ectopic triacylglycerol accumulation parallel to DNA methylation. Metformin upregulated insulin gene expression and suppressed DNA methylation and ectopic triacylglycerol accumulation. Finally, DNA methylation of the Ins1 promoter increased in isolated islets from Zucker diabetic fatty rats. This study helps to clarify the effect of an over-nutrition state on DNA methylation of the Ins1 promoter in pancreatic beta cells. It provides new insights into the irreversible pathophysiology of diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W1977405991,"Background The heart has close interactions with other organs’ functions and concomitant systemic factors such as oxidative stress, nitric oxide (NO), inflammation, and nutrition in systolic heart failure (HF). Recently, plasma amino acid (AA) profiling as a systemic metabolic indicator has attracted considerable attention in predicting the future risk of human cardiometabolic diseases, but it has been scarcely studied in HF. Methods Thirty-eight stable but greater than New York Heart Association class II symptomatic patients with left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction <45% and 33 asymptomatic individuals with normal B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) value were registered as the HF and control groups, respectively. We analyzed fasting plasma concentrations of 41 AAs using high-performance liquid chromatography, serum NO metabolite concentration, hydroperoxide and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein measurements, echocardiography, and flow-mediated dilatation. Results We found that 17 AAs and two ratios significantly changed in the HF group compared with those in the control group (p < 0.05). In the HF group, subsequent univariate and stepwise multivariate analyses with clinical variables revealed that Fischer ratio and five specific AAs, ie, monoethanolamine, methionine, tyrosine, 1-methylhistidine, and histidine have significant correlation with BNP, LV ejection fraction, LV end-diastolic volume index, inferior vena cava diameter, the ratio of early diastolic velocity of the mitral inflow to mitral annulus, and BNP, respectively (p < 0.05). Interestingly, further exploratory factor analysis categorized these AAs into hepatic-related (monoethanolamine, tyrosine, and Fischer ratio) and skeletal muscle-related (histidine, methionine, and 1-methylhistidine) components. Some categorized AAs showed unique correlations with concomitant factors: monoethanolamine, tyrosine, and Fischer ratio with serum NO concentration; histidine with serum albumin; and 1-methylhistidine with flow-mediated dilatation (p < 0.05). Conclusions Plasma AA profiling identified correlations of specific AAs with cardiac function and concomitant factors, highlighting the cardio-hepatic-skeletal muscle axis in patients with systolic HF."
https://openalex.org/W2167076400,"Forest fragmentation and habitat loss are among the major current extinction causes. Remaining fragments are mostly small, isolated and showing poor quality. Being primarily arboreal, Neotropical primates are generally sensitive to fragmentation effects. Furthermore, primates are involved in complex ecological process. Thus, landscape changes that negatively interfere with primate population dynamic affect the structure, composition, and ultimately the viability of the whole community. We evaluated if fragment size, isolation and visibility and matrix permeability are important for explaining the occurrence of three Neotropical primate species. Employing playback, we verified the presence of Callicebus nigrifrons, Callithrix aurita and Sapajus nigritus at 45 forest fragments around the municipality of Alfenas, Brazil. We classified the landscape and evaluated the metrics through predictive models of occurrence. We selected the best models through Akaike Selection Criterion. Aiming at validating our results, we applied the plausible models to another region (20 fragments at the neighboring municipality of Poço Fundo, Brazil). Twelve models were plausible, and three were validated, two for Sapajus nigritus (Area and Area+Visibility) and one for Callicebus nigrifrons (Area+Matrix). Our results reinforce the contribution of fragment size to maintain biodiversity within highly degraded habitats. At the same time, they stress the importance of including novel, biologically relevant metrics in landscape studies, such as visibility and matrix permeability, which can provide invaluable help for similar studies in the future and on conservation practices in the long run."
https://openalex.org/W2071856925,"Background Reduced hippocampal volume in schizophrenia is a well-replicated finding. New imaging techniques allow delineation of hippocampal subfield volumes. Studies including predominantly chronic patients demonstrate differences between subfields in sensitivity to illness, and in associations with clinical features. We carried out a cross-sectional and longitudinal study of first episode, sub-chronic, and chronic patients, using an imaging strategy that allows for the assessment of multiple hippocampal subfields. Methods Hippocampal subfield volumes were measured in 34 patients with schizophrenia (19 first episode, 6 sub-chronic, 9 chronic) and 15 healthy comparison participants. A subset of 10 first episode and 12 healthy participants were rescanned after six months. Results Total left hippocampal volume was smaller in sub-chronic (p = 0.04, effect size 1.12) and chronic (p = 0.009, effect size 1.42) patients compared with healthy volunteers. The CA2-3 subfield volume of chronic patients was significantly decreased (p = 0.009, effect size 1.42) compared to healthy volunteers. The CA4-DG volume was significantly reduced in all three patient groups compared to healthy group (all p < 0.005). The two affected subfield volumes were inversely correlated with severity of negative symptoms (p < 0.05). There was a small, but statistically significant decline in left CA4-DG volume over the first six months of illness (p = 0.01). Conclusions Imaging strategies defining the subfields of the hippocampus may be informative in linking symptoms and structural abnormalities, and in understanding more about progression during the early phases of illness in schizophrenia."
https://openalex.org/W2057677504,"Transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) mediates growth-inhibitory effects on most target cells via activation of the canonical SMAD signaling pathway. This growth-inhibitory activity may be coupled with cellular differentiation. Our studies demonstrate that TGF-β1 inhibits proliferation of primary, non-transformed human lung fibroblasts in association with the induction of myofibroblast differentiation. Differentiated myofibroblasts maintain the capacity to proliferate in response to exogenous mitogenic stimuli and are resistant to serum deprivation-induced apoptosis. These proliferative and anti-apoptotic properties of myofibroblasts are related, in part, to the down-regulation of caveolin-1 (Cav-1) by TGF-β1. Cav-1 down-regulation is mediated by early activation of p38 MAPK and does not require SMAD signaling. In contrast, myofibroblast differentiation is dependent on activation of the SMAD pathway, but not on p38 MAPK. Thus, combinatorial signaling by TGF-β1 of myofibroblast differentiation and down-regulation of Cav-1 by SMAD and p38 MAPK pathways, respectively, confer proliferative and apoptosis-resistant properties to myofibroblasts. Selective targeting of this SMAD-independent, p38-MAPK/Cav-1-dependent pathway is likely to be effective in the treatment of pathological conditions characterized by TGF-β signaling and myofibroblast activation."

Besides its role as the master regulator of 5′-end-dependent mRNA decay, RppH is important for the ability of pathogenic bacteria to invade host cells, yet little is known about how it chooses its targets. Here, we show that Escherichia coli RppH (EcRppH) requires at least two unpaired nucleotides at the RNA 5′ end and prefers three or more such nucleotides. It can tolerate any nucleotide at the first three positions but has a modest preference for A at the 5′ terminus and either a G or A at the second position. Mutational analysis has identified EcRppH residues crucial for substrate recognition or catalysis. The promiscuity of EcRppH differentiates it from its Bacillus subtilis counterpart, which has a strict RNA sequence requirement. EcRppH orthologs likely to share its relaxed sequence specificity are widespread in all classes of Proteobacteria, except Deltaproteobacteria, and in flowering plants. By contrast, the phylogenetic range of recognizable B. subtilis RppH orthologs appears to be restricted to the order Bacillales. These findings help to explain the selective influence of RppH on bacterial mRNA decay and show that RppH-dependent degradation has diversified significantly during the course of evolution.

https://openalex.org/W2150187468,"5′-End-dependent RNA degradation impacts virulence, stress responses, and DNA repair in bacteria by controlling the decay of hundreds of mRNAs. The RNA pyrophosphohydrolase RppH, a member of the Nudix hydrolase superfamily, triggers this degradation pathway by removing pyrophosphate from the triphosphorylated RNA 5′ terminus. Here, we report the x-ray structures of Escherichia coli RppH (EcRppH) in apo- and RNA-bound forms. These structures show distinct conformations of EcRppH·RNA complexes on the catalytic pathway and suggest a common catalytic mechanism for Nudix hydrolases. EcRppH interacts with RNA by a bipartite mechanism involving specific recognition of the 5′-terminal triphosphate and the second nucleotide, thus enabling discrimination against mononucleotides as substrates. The structures also reveal the molecular basis for the preference of the enzyme for RNA substrates bearing guanine in the second position by identifying a protein cleft in which guanine interacts with EcRppH side chains via cation-π contacts and hydrogen bonds. These interactions explain the modest specificity of EcRppH at the 5′ terminus and distinguish the enzyme from the highly selective RppH present in Bacillus subtilis. The divergent means by which RNA is recognized by these two functionally and structurally analogous enzymes have important implications for mRNA decay and the regulation of protein biosynthesis in bacteria."

In our preliminary tests, the ethyl acetate fraction of Phlomis tuberosa extracts showed significant α-glucosidase inhibitory activity (IC₅₀ = 100 μg/mL). In the present study, a combined method using Sepbox chromatography and thin-layer chromatography (TLC) bioautography was developed to probe α-glucosidase inhibitors further. The ethyl acetate fraction of P. tuberosa extracts was separated into 150 individual subfractions within 20 h using Sepbox chromatography. Then, under the guidance of TLC bioautography, 20 compounds were successfully isolated from these fractions, including four new diterpenoids [14-hydroxyabieta-8,11,13-triene-11-carbaldehyde-18-oic-12-carboxy-13-(1-hydroxy-1-methylethyl)-lactone (1), 14-hydroxyabieta-8,11,13-triene-17-oic-12-carboxy-13-(1-hydroxy-1-methylethyl)-lactone (2), 14,16-dihydroxyabieta-8,11,13-triene-15,17-dioic acid (3), and phlomisol (15,16-eposy-8,13(16),14-labdatrien-19-ol) (4)], and 16 known compounds. Activity estimation indicated that 15 compounds showed more potent α-glucosidase inhibitory effects (with IC50 values in the range 0.067–1.203 mM) than the positive control, acarbose (IC50 = 3.72 ± 0.113 mM).

In mammalian cells, efficient abscission during cytokinesis requires proper function of the ESCRT-III protein IST1, which binds to the microtubule interacting and trafficking (MIT) domains of VPS4, LIP5, and Spartin via its C-terminal MIT-interacting motif (MIM). Here, we studied the molecular interactions between IST1 and the three MIT domain-containing proteins to understand the structural basis that governs pairwise MIT-MIM interaction. Crystal structures of the three molecular complexes revealed that IST1 binds to the MIT domains of VPS4, LIP5, and Spartin using two different mechanisms (MIM1 mode versus MIM3 mode). Structural comparison revealed that structural features in both MIT and MIM contribute to determine the specific binding mechanism. Within the IST1 MIM sequence, two phenylalanine residues were shown to be important in discriminating MIM1 versus MIM3 binding. These observations enabled us to deduce a preliminary binding code, which we applied to provide CHMP2A, a protein that normally only binds the MIT domain in the MIM1 mode, the additional ability to bind the MIT domain of Spartin in the MIM3 mode.

They usually bind to the MIT domain via one of the five identified mechanisms. IST1 displays some unique MIT domain binding features that have not been observed in other ESCRT-III proteins. Previous mutagenesis studies have suggested that IST1 can bind to the MIT domains of VPS4, LIP5, and Spartin utilizing different MIT-MIM binding mechanisms (24.Bajorek M. Morita E. Skalicky J.J.

Cell. 2010; 21: 3293-3303Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Given the importance of IST1 in recruiting VPS4 and Spartin to the mid-body of dividing cells during cytokinesis, we sought to understand the structural basis of the interaction between IST1 and these different MIT domain-containing proteins. To this end, we have determined the high resolution crystal structures of the IST1 C-terminal MIM in complex with the MIT domains of VPS4, LIP5, and Spartin, which showed that IST1 binds to VPS4 and LIP5 in the MIM1 mode but to Spartin in the MIM3 mode. Structural comparison showed that both MIT and MIM contribute to determine the specific binding mechanism in pairwise MIT-MIM interaction. Using a preliminary binding code derived from this analysis, we were able to convert CHMP2A, a protein that normally binds the MIT domain only in the MIM1 mode, into one that can also bind to the MIT domain of Spartin in the MIM3 mode. Human IST1312–335, IST1290–335, Spartin8–101, VPS4B1–89, and LIP51–162 were expressed in Escherichia coli Rosetta (DE3) cells using a modified pET-28b vector with a SUMO protein tag inserted between a His6 tag and the respective protein coding region. A tryptophan residue was appended to the C termini of IST1 fragments to facilitate spectral detection at 280 nm during purification. The addition of the residue did not affect IST1 interaction with various MIT domains as evidenced by the crystal structures as well as binding affinity measurement. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using a standard PCR mutagenesis protocol (Stratagene). The codons used to introduce the point mutations for IST1290–335 were F321A (TTT → GCG), L324A (CTT→ GCG), R327A (AGG → GCG), F328E (TTT → GAG), and L331A (CTG → GCG). The codons used to introduce the point mutations for CHMP2A201–222 were D209F (GAT → CAG) and L216F (CTT → TTT). All proteins were purified using a protocol as previously described (52.Vild C.J. Xu Z. Vfa1 binds to the N-terminal microtubule-interacting and trafficking (MIT) domain of Vps4 and stimulates its ATPase activity.J. Biol.

Briefly, bacterial cells were grown to mid-log phase in LB media at 37 °C and induced with 0.2 mm isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside for an additional 16–20 h at 16 °C. Harvested cells were lysed with sonication in buffer A (25 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 300 mm NaCl, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 10 μg/ml (w/v) phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Cell lysate was cleared by centrifugation, and supernatant was loaded onto a Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity column. Bound protein was washed with buffer A and eluted with buffer A supplemented with 250 mm imidazole. Fractions were pooled, and ULP1 protease was added to cleave off the His6-SUMO tag. After dialysis against a buffer containing 50 mm Tris (pH 8.0) and 25 mm NaCl, the digested protein mixture was passed over a second Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid column to remove undigested protein and the tag. For protein complexes used in structural studies, IST1312–335 was mixed with Spartin8–101, VPS4B1–89, or LIP51–162 individually, and each complex was further purified by gel filtration chromatography on a Superdex75 column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with a buffer containing 25 mm Tris (pH 7.3) and 100 mm NaCl. All crystals were grown using the sitting drop vapor diffusion method. The Spartin8–101-IST1312–335 complex (20 mg/ml) was crystallized in 2.9 m sodium malonate (pH 6.0) at 4 °C, and crystals were cryo-protected in 3.0 m sodium malonate (pH 6.0). The VPS4B1–89-IST1312–335 complex (40 mg/ml) was crystallized in 2.58 m sodium malonate (pH 5.0) at 25 °C, and crystals were cryo-protected in 3.0 m sodium malonate (pH 5.0). The LIP51–162-IST1312–335 complex (10 mg/ml) was crystallized in 30% (w/v) polyethylene glycol monomethyl ether 5000 (PEG5000MME), 0.1 m (NH4)2SO4, and 0.1 m MES (pH 7.0) at 4 °C, and crystals were cryo-protected in 25% (w/v) PEG5000MME, 0.1 m (NH4)2SO4, 0.1 m MES (pH 7.0), and 30% (v/v) ethylene glycol. All diffraction data were collected at Advanced Photon Source LS-CAT 21-ID-F (Argonne National Laboratory). Crystals were cryo-cooled in liquid nitrogen during data collection. The Spartin8–101-IST1312–335 complex crystal diffracted to 1.8 Å and belonged to the space group of P43212 with one complex in the asymmetric unit. The VPS4B1–89-IST1312–335 complex crystal diffracted to 2.5 Å and belonged to the space group of P622 with one complex in the asymmetric unit. The LIP51–162-IST1312–335 complex crystal diffracted to 1.6 Å and belonged to the space group of P212121 with one protein complex in the asymmetric unit. All data were processed using HKL2000 (HKL Research). The structures were solved by molecular replacement using the solution structures of the Spartin MIT domain (PDB entry 2DL1) and the VPS4B MIT domain (PDB entry 1WR0) and the crystal structure of LIP5 N-terminal domain (PDB entry 4TXP) as initial search models.

https://openalex.org/W2012523473,"In 2010, ischemic heart disease was the leading cause of disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) worldwide. More specially, the prevalence of acute myocardial infarctions (AMI) is increasing in the aged population as mortality decreases; South Korea is no exception. This study aims to examine the economic burden of AMI in the Korean population between 2007 and 2012. AMI-related costs were assessed from a societal perspective. A prevalence-based cost-of-illness framework was used for this analysis. The subjects included all South Koreans with AMI-related ICD-10 codes (I21, I22, I23, I25.0, and I25.1). Data on direct (medical and non-medical) costs and indirect (productivity loss due to AMI-associated morbidity and mortality) costs were collected from the Korean National Health Insurance Service’s claims data. The human capital approach was used to calculate indirect costs. The total estimated cost of AMI in 2012 was $1,177,649,323 USD. The majority (52%) of this amount was made up of medical costs, followed by productivity losses due to mortality and morbidity (42% of annual cost). Although the total cost declined by approximately 18% compared to 2007 ($1,427,643,854 USD), the cost of AMI in the over 60 age group amounted to 47% of the total cost of AMI in 2012. AMI led to a high economic burden in 2012. This study, which identified not only the size, but also the trends of AMI-related costs, will provide information to evaluate effects of governmental health projects and the effective allocation of public research funds."
https://openalex.org/W2069074080,"Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is the most common primary malignancy of the kidney and one of the most lethal genitourinary malignancies. Clear-cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) has an extremely poor prognosis because of a high potential for tumor growth, vascular invasion, metastasis and recurrence. Unfortunately, the mechanism of RCC growth and metastasis is not well understood. In this report, we for the first time demonstrated ubiquitin protein ligase E3C (UBE3C) as a driving factor for RCC growth and metastasis. UBE3C expression was increased in ccRCC tissues compared with adjacent normal tissues. ccRCC patients with high UBE3C protein expression in tumors were associated with significantly worse postoperative survival. Knockdown of UBE3C expression in ACHN cells inhibited cell proliferation, migrations and invasiveness in vitro while overexpression of UBE3C in 786-O cells exerted the opposite effects. UBE3C up-regulated β-catenin protein levels and promoted β-catenin nuclear accumulation, leading to the activation of the Wnt/β-catenin signal pathway in RCC cells. Collectively, these observations suggest that UBE3C plays an important role in RCC development and progression, and UBE3C may be a novel target for prevention and treatment of ccRCC."

Methods A randomized, 12 week, open-label, comparative study of the impact on lipids of continuation of abacavir/lamivudine (ABC/3TC) plus efavirenz (EFV) or replacement with the single tablet regimen of EFV/emtricitabine/tenofovir DF (EFV/FTC/TDF) in hypercholesterolaemic subjects on successful antiretroviral therapy, with a 12-week extension with all subjects on EFV/FTC/TDF. Results 157 subjects received study drug, 79 switched to EFV/FTC/TDF and 78 subjects continued ABC/3TC+EFV. At Week 12, 73 subjects on ABC/3TC+EFV switched to EFV/FTC/TDF. The switch was well tolerated and no subject experienced viral rebound. Median baseline fasting total cholesterol was 6.32mmol/L. 12 weeks following switch, the difference in the means (LSM) between treatment groups (EFV/FTC/TDF minus ABC/3TC+EFV) in total cholesterol change from baseline was -0.74mmol/l (95% CI −1.00, −0.47, p < 0.001). The median change from baseline in total cholesterol following switch in the EFV/FTC/TDF arm was -0.86mmol/l (p < 0.001) compared with +0.01mmol/l (p = 0.45) in the continuation arm at Week 12. Significant (p < 0.001) differences between treatment groups following switch were seen for all lipid fractions from baseline to Week 12: LDL cholesterol (−0.47 mmol/L [−0.70, −0.25]), HDL cholesterol (−0.15 mmol/L [−0.21, −0.08]), triglycerides (−0.43 mmol/L [-0.75, -0.11]), and non HDL cholesterol (−0.56 mmol/L [−0.80, −0.31]). In the extension phase, similar declines in total cholesterol were observed with a median change from Week 12 to Week 24 of −0.73mmol/L (p < 0.001). Conclusions Switching from ABC/3TC+EFV to EFV/FTC/TDF in persons with hypercholesterolemia maintains virological control and significantly improves key lipid parameters.

https://openalex.org/W1992668967,"Myostatin, a member of the TGF-β family of ligands, is a strong negative regulator of muscle growth. As such, it is a prime therapeutic target for muscle wasting disorders. Similar to other TGF-β family ligands, myostatin is neutralized by binding one of a number of structurally diverse antagonists. Included are the antagonists GASP-1 and GASP-2, which are unique in that they specifically antagonize myostatin. However, little is known from a structural standpoint describing the interactions of GASP antagonists with myostatin. Here, we present the First low resolution solution structure of myostatin-free and myostatin-bound states of GASP-1 and GASP-2. Our studies have revealed GASP-1, which is 100 times more potent than GASP-2, preferentially binds myostatin in an asymmetrical 1:1 complex, whereas GASP-2 binds in a symmetrical 2:1 complex. Additionally, C-terminal truncations of GASP-1 result in less potent myostatin inhibitors that form a 2:1 complex, suggesting that the C-terminal domains of GASP-1 are the primary mediators for asymmetric complex formation.

Despite this, GASP-1−/− and GASP-2−/− mice showed a small but significant increase in muscle mass, but much less significant than FS−/− mice. Moreover, following cardiotoxin-induced injury, mice lacking GASP-1 and/or GASP-2 displayed significant muscle regenerative impairments compared with WT mice. The reciprocal effect is observed in mice lacking myostatin (21.McCroskery S. Improved muscle healing through enhanced regeneration and reduced fibrosis in myostatin-null mice.J.

On the other hand, during embryological development, GASP-2−/− mice had significant impairments in skeletal axial patterning, suggesting that GASP-2 may modulate GDF-11 activity because these defects are seen in GDF-11−/− mice (19.Lee Y.S. Lee S.J. Regulation of GDF-11 and myostatin activity by GASP-1 and GASP-2.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2013; 110: E3713-E3722Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 23.McPherron A.C. Lawler A.M.

Analysis of GASP-2 identified the FS domain as the predominant domain responsible for myostatin binding, whereas the C-terminal domains alone (K2 and netrin-like domain) showed limited binding (17.Kondás K. Szláma G. Trexler M. Patthy L. Both WFIKKN1 and WFIKKN2 have high affinity for growth and differentiation factors 8 and 11.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 23677-23684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). However, the full-length protein was necessary for the nm affinity, suggesting that multiple domains contribute to ligand binding (17.Kondás K. Szláma G. Trexler M. Patthy L.

It should be noted that unlike FS, which inhibits multiple ligands (e.g. activin A, activin B, BMP-7, and myostatin), both GASP-1 and GASP-2 selectively inhibit myostatin and GDF-11 (17.Kondás K.

Therefore, apart from the myostatin pro-domain, GASP-1 and GASP-2 are the only known molecules to be highly specific for myostatin. Despite this, little is known about how GASP molecules interact with myostatin at the molecular level and, further, how they compare with the other ligand antagonists such as FS and noggin. To address this, we present the first low resolution solution structure of GASP-1 and GASP-2 in complex with myostatin. Our evidence shows that although GASP-1 and GASP-2 are structurally similar, they use two different binding modes to antagonize myostatin. Through biophysical characterization, we show that GASP-1 preferentially binds myostatin with a 1:1 stoichiometry, whereas GASP-2 preferentially binds myostatin with a 2:1 stoichiometry. Finally, we show that the progressive truncation of domains from the C terminus of GASP-1 result in less potent molecules with a shift to a 2:1 stoichiometric complex with myostatin, similar to GASP-2. CHO cells stably overexpressing myostatin, GASP-1 and GASP-2 were used as previously published (4.Cash J.N. Rejon C.A. McPherron A.C. Bernard D.J. Thompson T.B.

Myostatin conditioned medium (CM) was concentrated ∼10-fold using tangential flow and concomitantly buffer exchanged into 50 mm Tris pH 7.4, 500 mm NaCl and applied to a Lentil Lectin-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences) column. Myostatin was eluted with the same buffer with the addition of 500 mm methyl mannose. Eluted protein was then dialyzed against 20 mm trisodium citrate pH 5.0, 20 mm NaCl. Myostatin was then applied to a HiPrep SP FF 16/10 column (GE Life Sciences) and eluted using the same buffer with the addition of 1 m NaCl. The eluted protein was then dialyzed against 20 mm trisodium citrate pH 5.0, 20 mm NaCl. Next, the protein was adjusted to 5% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, 4 m guanidinium HCl and applied to a Sepax C4 reverse phase HPLC column. Myostatin was eluted using an acetonitrile gradient. GASP-1 and GASP-2 was expressed and purified as published earlier with some minor modifications (19.Lee Y.S. Lee S.J. Regulation of GDF-11 and myostatin activity by GASP-1 and GASP-2.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2013; 110: E3713-E3722Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Following application to butyl-Sepharose and heparin columns, the heparin eluent containing either GASP-1 or GASP-2 was dialyzed extensively into 50 mm Tris pH 7.4, 20 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, applied to a MonoQ 10/100 GL column and eluted with a linear NaCl gradient. The full-length mouse GASP-1 cDNA fragment was inserted into pFastBac1 followed by subsequent insertion of a stop codon at the desired location for C-terminal truncation. The truncations consisted of the following amino acids (a.a.): WF (30–198), WFI (30–314), WFIK (30–375). The maltose binding protein (MBP)-WFIK fusion construct consisted of MBP positioned on the N terminus linked to WFIK (30–375) by three alanines. Baculovirus production and protein expression was performed according to the manufacture's protocol (Invitrogen). Following expression in SF9 insect cells, conditioned medium was adjusted to 750 mm ammonium sulfate and applied to a butyl-Sepharose column. The eluent was subsequently applied to a Nickel-Sepharose HiTrap column (GE) followed by extensive dialysis into 50 mm Tris pH 7.4, 20 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, applied to a MonoQ 10/100 GL column and eluted with a linear NaCl gradient. MBP-WFIK was purified using the same strategy except that the buffers utilized contained 5 mm maltose as an additive. The luciferase reporter assays were performed as previously described (28.Cash J.N. Angerman E.B. Keutmann H.T. Thompson T.B.

Briefly, HEK293 CAGA12 cells were plated in a 96-well plate and grown for ∼24 h. Subsequently, the growth medium was removed and myostatin at a concentration of 0.62 nm was mixed with the antagonist (GASP-1, GASP-2, or GASP-1 truncations) in serum free medium and applied to the cells for ∼18 h. The cells were lysed and luminescence was recorded immediately using a Synergy H1 Hybrid plate reader (BioTek). The inhibition data were imported into GraphPad Prism and fit using nonlinear regression with a variable slope. Inhibition curves shown are one representative experiment of three independent conducted assays. SPR analysis was performed similar to previous studies (5.Cash J.N. Angerman E.B. Kattamuri C.

Briefly, Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) measurements were carried out in HBS-EP buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 3 mm EDTA, 0.005% P-20 surfactant (BIAcore AB)) on a BIAcore 3000 optical biosensor system operated with BIAevaluation 4.1 software. Myostatin was immobilized on a CM4 research grade sensor chip (BIAcore AB) by amine coupling chemistry using the manufacturer's protocol at 25 °C (2785 RUs). For kinetic measurements, GASP-1 and GASP-2 were diluted in HBS-EP buffer to a concentration of 2 μm. The proteins were then diluted in a 2-fold dilution series and applied to the chip at a flow rate of 20 μl/min. Protein was injected for an association time of 6 min, and then dissociation was monitored for 9 min. After each measurement, the chip surface was regenerated with four 15 μl pulses of 2 m guanidine HCl at a flow rate of 100 μl/min. SPR sensorgrams were globally analyzed using a distribution model for continuous affinity and rate constant analysis using the program EVILFIT (30.Svitel J. Balbo A. Mariuzza R.A. Gonzales N.R. Schuck P. Combined affinity and rate constant distributions of ligand populations from experimental surface binding kinetics and equilibria.Biophys.

GASP-1, GASP-2, GASP-1·myostatin, and GASP-2·myostatin were applied independently to a Phenomenex HPLC S2000 size exclusion column equilibrated with 20 mm HEPES pH 7.4, 500 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA to obtain their retention volume. Sizing standards were run under identical conditions for determination of apparent molecular weight. Fractions from each peak were analyzed using SDS-PAGE followed by Western analysis to ensure both proteins were present. Experiments were performed with a Beckman ProteomeLab XL-1 fitted with absorbance optics and a four-hole rotor. Samples and matched buffer (20 mm HEPES pH 7.4, 500 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA; 5 mm maltose was added to the buffer for the GASP-1 MBP-WFIK:myostatin experiment) for buffer subtraction were loaded in a two-channel, carbon-filled, epon centerpieces at 48,000 rpm at 20 °C. Absorbance was monitored at 230 nm. Absorbance data were processed using the program Sedfit (31.Schuck P. Size-distribution analysis of macromolecules by sedimentation velocity ultracentrifugation and Lamm equation modeling.Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 1606-1619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3044) Google Scholar) to determine the sedimentation coefficient (c(s)) and sedimentation coefficient-frictional ratio c(s,f/fo) distributions (32.Brown P.H.

J. 2006; 90: 4651-4661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). Values for buffer density and viscosity and protein partial specific volume were calculated using Sednterp. Because of the presence of both N-linked and O-linked glycosylation of GASP-1 and GASP-2, the partial specific volume was calculated as a weight-averaged value. SAXS data were collected at beam line 12-ID-B at the Advanced Photon Source at Argonne National Laboratory and using the SIBYLS beam line mail-in program (Berkeley, CA) (33.Dyer K.N. Hammel M. Rambo R.P. Tsutakawa S.E. Rodic I. Classen S. Tainer J.A. Hura G.L. High-throughput SAXS for the characterization of biomolecules in solution: a practical approach.Methods Mol. Biol. 2014; 1091: 245-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Purified GASP-1, GASP-2, GASP-1·myostatin, GASP-2·myostatin and GASP-1 MBP-WFIK:myostatin were purified as described above. Three different concentrations of each sample were analyzed to determine whether concentration dependent effects exist. Data were collected in 20 mm HEPES pH 7.4, 500 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA at 10 °C. Additionally, for the GASP-1 MBP-WFIK construct, the buffer contained 1 mm maltose. Four exposure times of 0.5 s, 1 s, 2 s, and 5 s were collected. Exposures exhibiting radiation damage were discarded. Buffer matched controls were used for buffer subtraction. ScÅtter (SIBYLS) and the ATSAS program suite (EMBL) were used for data analysis. The online DAMMIF server (EMBL-Hamburg) was used for generation of 20 independent ab initio molecular envelope reconstructions (34.Franke D. Svergun D.I. DAMMIF, a program for rapid ab-initio shape determination in small-angle scattering.J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2009; 42: 342-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (1181) Google Scholar). P1 symmetry operators were employed to improve the quality of the fit for GASP-1, GASP-2, GASP-1·myostatin whereas a P2 symmetry operator was used for GASP-2·myostatin. Final models were then averaged using DAMAVER pipeline (35.Volkov V.V. Svergun D.I. Uniqueness of ab initio shape determination in small-angle scattering.J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2003; 36: 860-864Crossref Scopus (1610) Google Scholar). Graphics were generated using UCSF Chimera and Pymol. For structural analysis, we produced and purified murine GASP-1 and GASP-2 as previously described (Fig. 1B) (19.Lee Y.S. Lee S.J.

Analysis by SDS-PAGE shows that GASP proteins migrate at higher than expected molecular weight. Subsequent analysis by mass spectrometry reveals that GASP-1 and GASP-2 exhibit mass increases of ∼8.7 and 5.3 kDa, respectively, over their predicted molecular mass (Table 1). The majority of this mass is attributed to both O- and N-linked glycosylation and is consistent with previous studies describing that GASP-1 is both O-linked and N-linked glycosylated (Fig. 1B and Table 1) (36.Brun C. Monestier O. Legardinier S. Maftah A. Blanquet V. Murine GASP-1 N-glycosylation is not essential for its activity on C2C12 myogenic cells but alters its secretion.Cell Physiol. Biochem. 2012; 30: 791-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Because of a significant decrease in solubility upon deglycosylation, all structural analysis was performed on the fully glycosylated form of the GASP proteins.TABLE 1Theoretical and experimentally determined molecular weights for ligand-free and ligand-bound complexesProteinTheoretical molecular massMass spectrometryPredicted molecular massaValues indicate the predicted molecular mass based on the molecular mass determined by mass spectrometry.SECSedimentation velocitySAXSkDakDakDakDakDakDaMyostatin24.824.8NDbND, not determined.NDbND, not determined.NDbND, not determined.GASP-16068.7 (62.2)cMass following treatment with endoglycosidases.4161.376.4GASP-1·myostatin (1:1)84.893.511497.1103.6GASP-1·myostatin (2:1)144.8162.2GASP-25762.3 (58.1+)2860.474.5GASP-2·myostatin (1:1)81.887.1GASP-2·myostatin (2:1)138.8149.4160137187.3a Values indicate the predicted molecular mass based on the molecular mass determined by mass spectrometry.b ND, not determined.c Mass following treatment with endoglycosidases.

Using a HEK293-CAGA12 luciferase reporter assay, we determined the myostatin IC50 values for GASP-1 and GASP-2 (Fig. 1C). Similar to previous studies, both GASP-1 and GASP-2 potently blocked myostatin signaling with IC50 values of 4.4 ± 2.6 × 10−10 and 1.2 ± 0.5 × 10−8 m, respectively (25.Szláma G. Kondás K. Trexler M.

https://openalex.org/W2011837766,"Background Many studies have reported factors associated with HIV status disclosure among People Living With HIV and AIDS (PLWHA) but very few were conducted among PLWHA receiving ART. In Togo, no study on HIV status disclosure to sexual partners has been conducted among PLWHA on ART yet. We sought to document factors associated with HIV status disclosure among PLWHA receiving ART at Sokodé regional hospital in Togo. Method This was a cross-sectional study conducted from May to July 2013 at the regional hospital of Sokodé among 291 PLWHA who had been on ART for at least three months. Results A total of 291 PLWHA on ART were enrolled in this study. Their mean age (±SD) was 37.3±9.3 years and the sex ratio (Male/Female) was 0.4. Among them, 215 (74.6%) completed the questionnaire on HIV sero-status disclosure. We found that 131 PLWHA (60.9%) had disclosed their HIV sero-status to their sexual partners; 130 (60.5%) were aware of the HIV status of their sexual partners. In the multivariate analysis, the factors associated with HIV status disclosure to sexual partners were: adherence to ART (aOR = 4.89; 95%CI = [1.52; 15.78]), sexual partner awareness of HIV sero-status (aOR = 52.73; 95%CI = [14.76; 188.36]) and marital status of PLWHA (aOR = 6.10; 95%CI = [1.74; 21.37]). Conclusion This study allowed us to note that the disclosure of HIV status to sexual partners is relatively low and to document the associated factors such as adherence to ART, sexual partner awareness of HIV sero-status and marital status."
https://openalex.org/W2076194012,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a small positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus that causes severe liver diseases. Current anti-HCV therapies involving direct-acting antivirals have significantly enhanced efficacy in comparison to traditional interferon and ribavirin combination. However, further improvement is needed to eradicate HCV. Anacardic acid (AnA) is a phytochemical compound that can inhibit the activity of various cellular enzymes including histone acetyltransferases (HATs). In this study, we investigated the effects of AnA on different phases of HCV life cycle. Our data showed that AnA can inhibit HCV entry, replication, translation, and virion secretion in a dose-dependent manner with no measurable effects on cell viability. In addition, we showed that two HAT inhibitors and knocking down HAT (PCAF) by RNAi can reduce HCV replication, suggesting a mechanism of AnA’s inhibitory effects on HCV. Elucidation of the AnA-mediated inhibitory mechanism should facilitate the development of new drug candidates for HCV infection."
https://openalex.org/W2032576908,"Polyploidy and hybridization are thought to have significant impacts on both the evolution and diversification of the genus Actinidia, but the structure and patterns of morphology and molecular diversity relating to ploidy variation of wild Actinidia plants remain much less understood. Here, we examine the distribution of morphological variation and ploidy levels along geographic and environmental variables of a large mixed-ploidy population of the A. chinensis species complex. We then characterize the extent of both genetic and epigenetic diversity and differentiation exhibited between individuals of different ploidy levels. Our results showed that while there are three ploidy levels in this population, hexaploids were constituted the majority (70.3%). Individuals with different ploidy levels were microgeographically structured in relation to elevation and extent of niche disturbance. The morphological characters examined revealed clear difference between diploids and hexaploids, however tetraploids exhibited intermediate forms. Both genetic and epigenetic diversity were high but the differentiation among cytotypes was weak, suggesting extensive gene flow and/or shared ancestral variation occurred in this population even across ploidy levels. Epigenetic variation was clearly correlated with changes in altitudes, a trend of continuous genetic variation and gradual increase of epigenomic heterogeneities of individuals was also observed. Our results show that complex interactions between the locally microgeographical environment, ploidy and gene flow impact A. chinensis genetic and epigenetic variation. We posit that an increase in ploidy does not broaden the species habitat range, but rather permits A. chinensis adaptation to specific niches."

Methods Using a random cluster sampling method, the school-based, cross-sectional Shandong Children Eye Study included children aged 4 to 18 years from the rural county of Guanxian and the city of Weihai in the province of Shandong in East China. CCR was measured by ocular biometry. Results CCR measurements were available for 5913 (92.9%) out of 6364 eligible children. Mean age was 10.0±3.3 years, and mean CCR was 7.84±0.27 mm (range: 6.98 to 9.35 mm). In multivariate linear regression analysis, longer CCR (i.e. flatter cornea) was significantly associated with the systemic parameters of male sex (P<0001;standardized regression coefficient beta: -0.08;regression coefficient B:-0.04; 95% Confidence Interval (CI):-0.05,-0.03), younger age (P<0.001;beta:-0.37;B:-0.03;95%CI:-0.04,-0.03), taller body height (P = 0.002;beta:0.06;B:0.001;95%CI:0.000,0.001), lower level of education of the father (P = 0.001;beta:-0.04;B:-0.01;95%CI:-0.02,-0.01) and maternal myopia (P<0.001;beta:-0.07;B:-0.04;95%CI:-0.06,-0.03), and with the ocular parameters of longer ocular axial length (P<0.001;beta:0.59;B:0.13;95%CI:0.12,0.14), larger horizontal corneal diameter (P<0.001;beta:0.19;B:0.13;95%CI:0.11,0.14), and smaller amount of cylindrical refractive error (P = 0.001;beta:-0.09;B:-0.05;95%CI:-0.06,-0.04). Conclusions Longer CCR (i.e., flatter corneas) (mean:7.84±0.27mm) was correlated with male sex, younger age, taller body height, lower paternal educational level, maternal myopia, longer axial length, larger corneas (i.e., longer horizontal corneal diameter), and smaller amount of cylindrical refractive error. These findings may be of interest for elucidation of the process of emmetropization and myopization and for corneal refractive surgery."

https://openalex.org/W1982514871,"Kif23 kinesin is an essential actor of cytokinesis in animals. It exists as two major isoforms, known as MKLP1 and CHO1, the longest of which, CHO1, contains two HXRXXS/T NDR/LATS kinase consensus sites. We demonstrate that these two sites are readily phosphorylated by NDR and LATS kinases in vitro, and this requires the presence of an upstream -5 histidine residue. We further show that these sites are phosphorylated in vivo and provide evidence revealing that LATS1,2 participate in the phosphorylation of the most C-terminal S814 site, present on both isoforms. This S814 phosphosite was previously reported to constitute a 14-3-3 binding site, which plays a role in Kif23 clustering during cytokinesis. Surprisingly, we found that phosphorylation of the upstream S716 NDR/LATS consensus site, present only in the longest Kif23 isoform, is required for efficient phosphorylation at S814, thus revealing sequential phosphorylation at these two sites, and differential regulation of Kif23-14-3-3 interaction for the two Kif23 isoforms. Finally, we provide evidence that Kif23 is largely unphosphorylated on S814 in post-abscission midbodies, making this Kif23 post-translational modification a potential marker to probe these structures."

Although, Ara-LAM modulates TLR2 and MAPK signaling, it is not known whether Ara-LAM involves IFN-γ signaling for effective parasite clearance. Because, it is reported that IFN-γ signaling, a principle mediator of NO generation and macrophage and Tcell activation, is hampered during leishmanial pathogenesis. Ara-LAM increases IFN-γ receptor expression and potentiates IFN-γ receptor signaling through JAK-STAT pathway. Moreover, Ara-LAM reciprocally modulates IRF4 and IRF8 expression and reinstates anti-leishmanial Th1 response that eventuates in significantly reduced parasite load in spleen and liver of L. donovani-infected BALB/c mice. IFN-γRα silencing resulted in the suppression of these host-protective mechanisms affected by Ara-LAM. Thus, Ara-LAM-mediated restoration of IFN-γ responsiveness is a novel immuno-modulatory principle for protection against L. donovani susceptible host."
https://openalex.org/W2013176142,"Long-term studies in rodents are the benchmark method to assess carcinogenicity of single substances, mixtures, and multi-compounds. In such a study, mice and rats are exposed to a test agent at different dose levels for a period of two years and the incidence of neoplastic lesions is observed. However, this two-year study is also expensive, time-consuming, and burdensome to the experimental animals. Consequently, various alternatives have been proposed in the literature to assess carcinogenicity on basis of short-term studies. In this paper, we investigated if effects on the rodents’ liver weight in short-term studies can be exploited to predict the incidence of liver tumors in long-term studies. A set of 138 paired short- and long-term studies was compiled from the database of the U.S. National Toxicology Program (NTP), more precisely, from (long-term) two-year carcinogenicity studies and their preceding (short-term) dose finding studies. In this set, data mining methods revealed patterns that can predict the incidence of liver tumors with accuracies of over 80%. However, the results simultaneously indicated a potential bias regarding liver tumors in two-year NTP studies. The incidence of liver tumors does not only depend on the test agent but also on other confounding factors in the study design, e.g., species, sex, type of substance. We recommend considering this bias if the hazard or risk of a test agent is assessed on basis of a NTP carcinogenicity study."
https://openalex.org/W1992826902,"In the C. elegans embryo, formation of an antero-posterior axis of polarity relies on signaling by the conserved PAR proteins, which localize asymmetrically in two mutually exclusive groups at the embryonic cortex. Depletion of any PAR protein causes a loss of polarity and embryonic lethality. A genome-wide RNAi screen previously identified two B-type cyclins, cyb-2.1 and cyb-2.2, as suppressors of par-2(it5ts) lethality. We found that the loss of cyb-2.1 or cyb-2.2 suppressed the lethality and polarity defects of par-2(it5ts) mutants and that these cyclins act in cell polarity with their cyclin-dependent kinase partner, CDK-1. Interestingly, cyb-2.1; cyb-2.2 double mutants did not show defects in cell cycle progression or timing of polarity establishment, suggesting that they regulate polarity independently of their typical role in cell cycle progression. Loss of both cyclin genes or of cdk-1 resulted in a decrease in PAR-6 levels in the embryo. Furthermore, the activity of the cullin CUL-2 was required to achieve suppression of par-2 lethality when both cyclins were absent. Our results support a model in which CYB-2.1/2/CDK-1 antagonize CUL-2 activity to promote stabilization of PAR-6 levels during polarization of the early C. elegans embryo. They also suggest that CYB-2.1 and CYB-2.2 contribute to the coupling of cell cycle progression and asymmetric segregation of cell fate determinants."
https://openalex.org/W2011899993,"The microbial decomposition respiration of plant litter generates a major CO2 efflux from terrestrial ecosystems that plays a critical role in the regulation of carbon cycling on regional and global scales. However, the respiration from root litter decomposition and its sensitivity to temperature changes are unclear in current models of carbon turnover in forest soils. Thus, we examined seasonal changes in the temperature sensitivity and decomposition rates of fine root litter of two diameter classes (0–0.5 and 0.5–2.0 mm) of Quercus serrata and Ilex pedunculosa in a deciduous broad-leaved forest. During the study period, fine root litter of both diameter classes and species decreased approximately exponentially over time. The Q10 values of microbial respiration rates of root litter for the two classes were 1.59–3.31 and 1.28–6.27 for Q. serrata and 1.36–6.31 and 1.65–5.86 for I. pedunculosa. A significant difference in Q10 was observed between the diameter classes, indicating that root diameter represents the initial substrate quality, which may determine the magnitude of Q10 value of microbial respiration. Changes in these Q10 values were related to seasonal soil temperature patterns; the values were higher in winter than in summer. Moreover, seasonal variations in Q10 were larger during the 2-year decomposition period than the 1-year period. These results showed that the Q10 values of fine root litter of 0–0.5 and 0.5–2.0 mm have been shown to increase with lower temperatures and with the higher recalcitrance pool of the decomposed substrate during 2 years of decomposition. Thus, the temperature sensitivity of microbial respiration in root litter showed distinct patterns according to the decay period and season because of the temperature acclimation and adaptation of the microbial decomposer communities in root litter."
https://openalex.org/W2055709849,"The CCR4-NOT complex, the major deadenylase in eukaryotes, plays crucial roles in gene expression at the levels of transcription, mRNA decay, and protein degradation. GW182/TNRC6 proteins, which are core components of the microRNA-induced silencing complex in animals, stimulate deadenylation and repress translation via recruitment of the CCR4-NOT complex. Here we report a heterologous experimental system that recapitulates the recruitment of CCR4-NOT complex by TNRC6 in S. cerevisiae. Using this system, we characterize conserved functions of the CCR4-NOT complex. The complex stimulates degradation of mRNA from the 5′ end by Xrn1, in a manner independent of both translation and deadenylation. This degradation pathway is probably conserved in miRNA-mediated gene silencing in zebrafish. Furthermore, the mRNA fate modulators Dhh1 and Pat1 redundantly stimulate mRNA decay, but both factors are required for poly(A) tail-independent translation repression by tethered TNRC6A. Our tethering-based reconstitution system reveals that the conserved architecture of Not1/CNOT1 provides a binding surface for TNRC6, thereby connecting microRNA-induced silencing complex to the decapping machinery as well as the translation apparatus."
https://openalex.org/W2134003528,"Phosphoesterases are involved in the degradation of organophosphorus compounds. Although phosphomonoesterases and phosphotriesterases have been studied in detail, studies on phosphodiesterases are rather limited. In our search to find novel phosphodiesterases using metagenomic approach, we cloned a gene encoding a putative phosphodiesterase (PdeM) from the metagenome of the formation water collected from an Indian coal bed. Bioinformatic analysis showed that PdeM sequence possessed the characteristic signature motifs of the class III phosphodiesterases and phylogenetic study of PdeM enabled us to identify three distinct subclasses (A, B, and C) within class III phosphodiesterases, PdeM clustering in new subclass IIIB. Bioinformatic, biochemical and biophysical characterization of PdeM further revealed some of the characteristic features of the phosphodiesterases belonging to newly described subclass IIIB. PdeM is a monomer of 29.3 kDa, which exhibits optimum activity at 25°C and pH 8.5, but low affinity for bis(pNPP) as well as pNPPP. The recombinant PdeM possessed phosphodiesterase, phosphonate-ester hydrolase and nuclease activity. It lacked phosphomonoesterase, phosphotriesterase, and RNAse activities. Overexpression of PdeM in E.coli neither affected catabolite respression nor did the recombinant protein hydrolyzed cAMP in vitro, indicating its inability to hydrolyze cAMP. Although Mn2+ was required for the activity of PdeM, but addition of metals (Mn2+ or Fe3+) did not induce oligomerization. Further increase in concentration of Mn2+ upto 3 mM, increased α-helical content as well as the phosphodiesterase activity. Structural comparison of PdeM with its homologs showed that it lacked critical residues required for dimerization, cAMP hydrolysis, and for the high affinity binding of bis(pNPP). PdeM, thus, is a novel representative of new subclass of class III phosphodiesterases."

https://openalex.org/W1975779117,"The β radioactivity of snow-pit samples collected in the spring of 2011 on four Tibetan Plateau glaciers demonstrate a remarkable peak in each snow pit profile, with peaks about ten to tens of times higher than background levels. The timing of these peaks suggests that the high radioactivity resulted from the Fukushima nuclear accident that occurred on March 11, 2011 in eastern Japan. Fallout monitoring studies demonstrate that this radioactive material was transported by the westerlies across the middle latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere. The depth of the peak β radioactivity in each snow pit compared with observational precipitation records, suggests that the radioactive fallout reached the Tibetan Plateau and was deposited on glacier surfaces in late March 2011, or approximately 20 days after the nuclear accident. The radioactive fallout existed in the atmosphere over the Tibetan Plateau for about one month."
https://openalex.org/W1992727640,"As a child of mixed ancestry growing up 5 decades ago in the Harlem and Bronx neighborhoods of New York City, Erich Jarvis was immersed in the teachings of civil rights leaders. From Martin Luther King Jr., he took the precept to “love everybody, accept everybody.” Malcolm X inspired him to succeed “by any means necessary.” Both principles have served him well in science, says Jarvis, now a prominent neurobiologist. Jarvis is a natural collaborator and also an opportunist. “I try to accept any kind of tool or any type of technology that I need to use to answer my questions,” he says.

These days, the Duke University professor and Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator studies the molecular mechanisms underlying the capacity for spoken language, a uniquely human trait. His work was featured prominently in the 12 December Science special issue. (You can read it at [scim.ag/1v9GcNv][1].) It required an unusual collaboration with researchers studying a seemingly different topic: the evolution of birds.

Parrots, songbirds, and hummingbirds are among the few animals capable of imitating sounds they hear, a trait called vocal learning. Jarvis wanted to compare the genomes of vocal-learning birds with their nonvocal-learning evolutionary cousins. He first teamed up with Genome 10K, a project aiming to sequence the genomes for 10,000 vertebrate species, and when he heard about another parallel bird-sequencing project, he helped bring everyone together to create a coalition. “Some people say competition leads to greater advances, but I've found that coordinating, and forming collaborations and cooperating, actually works just as well if not better,” he says.

Jarvis took an indirect route to science. A student at New York City's High School of Performing Arts, the setting for the 1980 movie Fame , he earned an audition with Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater, a prestigious modern dance company. He chose science instead. “My mother always taught me to do something that has a positive impact on the planet, and I felt I could do that better as a scientist than as a dancer,” he explains. “Science and dance are very similar to me. They both require discipline, creativity, invention, and lots of effort that in the end rewards you with something new.”

His undergraduate research at Hunter College produced six papers. “A lot of people were surprised that a person of color could do this,” he says. “I remember people telling me that directly; they weren't shy about it.” He encountered similar sentiments in graduate school at Rockefeller University, where some implied he was only there because of a quota, he says. “I remember internalizing this feeling that I'm not as good as others here and that I don't belong here.”

When the time came to apply for faculty jobs, “I felt like I suddenly became a commodity because of the successes I had, like I was being sought after almost like a basketball player.” Yet his minority status continues to present challenges. “Anything that has to do with any kind of diversity issue, I'm called upon because I'm an underrepresented minority,” he says. “I am expected to hold two jobs. One is to be the best scientist I can be, like anybody else, and the other is to cure society's disease. … I had to learn how to say ‘no’ to a lot of things in order for it to not take up my time and sink my science career.”

It's not that he believes the issue is unimportant or solved. He says he could not have succeeded as a scientist without special programs and awards for minority researchers, “no matter how much talent I had.” He just wants more company—more researchers from underrepresented-minority backgrounds in faculty positions in the basic sciences, where they can “lead by example.” Science needs to be more visible as a career option, he says. “In my old neighborhoods, people haven't heard the word Ph.D. that much. … They say, ‘What's a Ph.D.?’”
