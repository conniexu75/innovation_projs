https://openalex.org/W2150228169,"Upon ligand-induced tyrosine phosphorylation, the platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) receptor (PDGFR) beta subunit associates with PLC-gamma 1, RasGAP, P13K, and a 64 kd protein. To determine the relative role of each of these associated proteins in PDGFR signaling, we constructed a PDGFR mutant (F5) unable to bind any of them and a panel of ""add-back"" mutants that could bind only one of the receptor-associated proteins. F5 PDGFR failed to activate PLC-gamma 1, P13K, or Ras and was unable to trigger DNA synthesis. Permitting association of F5 PDGFR with either PLC-gamma 1 or P13K restored Ras activation and a mitogenic response. Surprisingly, even though binding of the 64 kd protein almost fully restored Ras activation, it did not rescue the receptor's ability to trigger DNA synthesis. Thus Ras activation is insufficient to trigger PDGF-dependent DNA synthesis, and PLC-gamma 1 and P13K are independent downstream mediators of PDGF's mitogenic signal."

The concentrations of the peptides required to activate the enzyme are at least 10-1000fold higher than the dissociation constants of these peptides for the individual SH2 domains of the 85-kDa subunit (KO < 100 nM). Doubly phosphorylated peptides are more effective than singly phosphorylated peptides. The results suggest that a fraction of the cellular phosphoinositide 3-kinase has SH2 domains with relatively low affinity for phosphopeptides and that binding of phosphopeptides to these enzymes causes activation. Thus, SH2 domains may be involved not only in recruiting the enzyme but also in regulating activity."
https://openalex.org/W1989252766,"Previously known 5' exonucleases of several eubacterial DNA polymerases have now been shown to be structure-specific endonucleases that cleave single-stranded DNA or RNA at the bifurcated end of a base-paired duplex. Cleavage was not coupled to synthesis, although primers accelerated the rate of cleavage considerably. The enzyme appeared to gain access to the cleavage site by moving from the free end of a 5' extension to the bifurcation of the duplex, where cleavage took place. Single-stranded 5' arms up to 200 nucleotides long were cleaved from such a duplex. Essentially any linear single-stranded nucleic acid can be targeted for specific cleavage by the 5' nuclease of DNA polymerase through hybridization with an oligonucleotide that converts the desired cleavage site into a substrate."
https://openalex.org/W2075578776,"THE prototype members of the heparin-binding fibroblast growth factor (FGF) family1–6, acidic FGF (FGF-1) and basic FGF (FGF-2), are among the growth factors that act directly on vascular cells to induce endothelial cell growth and angiogenesis. In vivo, the role of the FGF prototypes in vascular pathology has been difficult to determine. We report here the introduction, by direct gene transfer into porcine arteries, of a eukaryotic expression vector encoding a secreted form of FGF-1. This somatic transgenic model defines gene function in the arterial wall in vivo. FGF-1 expression induced intimal thickening in porcine arteries 21 days after gene transfer, in contrast to control arteries transduced with an Escherichia coli β-galactosidase gene. Where there was substantial intimal hyperplasia, neocapillary formation was detected in the expanded intima. These findings suggest that FGF-1 induces intimal hyperplasia in the arterial wall in vivo and, through its ability to stimulate angiogenesis in the neointima, FGF-1 could stimulate neovascularization of atherosclerotic plaques. Potentially, gene transfer of FGF-1 could also be used as a genetic intervention to improve blood flow to ischaemic tissues in selected clinical settings."

https://openalex.org/W1535139368,"Angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE, E.C.3.4.15.1) has been recently shown to contain two very similar domains, each of which bears a functional active site hydrolyzing Hip-His-Leu or angiotensin I (AI). The substrate specificity of the two active sites of ACE was compared using wild-type recombinant ACE and mutants, where one active site is suppressed by deletion or inactivated by mutations of 2 histidines coordinating an essential zinc atom. Both active sites converted bradykinin (BK) to BK1-7 and BK1-5 with similar kinetics and with Kappm at least 30 times lower and kcat/kappm 10 times higher than for AI. The carboxyl-terminal active site, but not the amino-terminal site, was activated by chloride; however, chloride activation was minimal compared with AI. Both domains also hydrolyzed substance P and cleaved a carboxyl-terminal protected dipeptide and tripeptide. The carboxyl-terminal active site was more readily activated by chloride and hydrolyzed substance P faster. Luteinizing-hormone releasing hormone was hydrolyzed by both active sites, but hydrolysis by the amino-terminal active site was faster. It performed the endoproteolytic amino-terminal cleavage of this peptide at least 30 times faster than the carboxyl-terminal active site. Both active sites cleaved a carboxyl-terminal tripeptide from luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone. Thus, both active sites of ACE possess dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase and endopeptidase activities. However, only the carboxyl-terminal active site can undergo a chloride-induced alteration that greatly enhances the hydrolysis of AI or substance P, and the amino-terminal active site possesses an unusual amino-terminal endoproteolytic specificity for a natural peptide. This suggests physiologically important differences between the subsites of the two active centers, and different substrate specificity, despite the high degree of sequence homology."
https://openalex.org/W1900087291,"Addition of apolipoprotein (apo) E to rabbit beta-very low density lipoproteins (beta-VLDL) has been shown to result in a marked enhancement of their binding and uptake by various cell types. Apolipoprotein E binds to lipoprotein receptors and proteoglycans. To distinguish between apoE binding to these sites, cells were treated with heparinase. Heparinase treatment of receptor-negative familial hypercholesterolemic (FH) fibroblasts and human hepatoma cells (HepG2) released 30-40% of newly synthesized cell surface 35S-labeled proteoglycans and decreased the binding of beta-VLDL+apoE to FH and normal fibroblasts and HepG2 cells by more than 80%. Furthermore, heparinase treatment significantly decreased the uptake of fluorescently labeled beta-VLDL+apoE by HepG2 cells and decreased cholesteryl ester synthesis in FH fibroblasts by 75%. Likewise, canine chylomicron remnants enriched in apoE demonstrated enhanced binding that was 80% inhibited by heparinase treatment of HepG2 cells. Heparinase treatment did not affect beta-VLDL (without added apoE) or low density lipoprotein (LDL) binding to these cells or the binding activity of beta-VLDL+apoE to the LDL receptor-related protein (LRP) or to the LDL receptor on ligand blots. Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) mutant cells lacking the synthesis of either heparan sulfate (pgsD-677) or all proteoglycans (pgsA-745) did not display any enhanced binding of the beta-VLDL+apoE. By comparison, wild-type CHO cells demonstrated enhanced binding of beta-VLDL+apoE that could be abolished by treatment with heparinase. These mutant cells and wild-type CHO cells possessed a similar amount of LRP, as determined by ligand blot analyses and by alpha 2-macroglobulin binding, and possessed a similar amount of LDL receptor activity, as determined by LDL binding. Therefore, we would interpret these data as showing that heparan sulfate proteoglycan may be involved in the initial binding of the apoE-enriched remnants with the subsequent involvement of the LRP in the uptake of these lipoproteins. It remains to be determined whether the heparan sulfate proteoglycan can function by itself in both the binding and internalization of the apoE-enriched remnants or whether the proteoglycan is part of a complex with LRP that mediates a two-step process, i.e. binding and subsequent internalization by the receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1505220613,"Endothelin (ET) peptides are potent growth factors that bind to G protein-coupled receptors. Although short-term signals activated by ET receptors have been extensively characterized, relatively little is known about mitogenic signal transduction. We investigated the ET receptor subtype involved in mitogenic signaling in glomerular mesangial cells and the role of protein kinase C (PKC) and protein tyrosine kinase (PTK) activity. Pertussis toxin attenuates increases in [Ca2+]i by ET-1 but not [3H]thymidine uptake. An ETA-selective receptor antagonist, BQ 123, blocks increments in [Ca2+]i by ET-1 and inhibits [3H]thymidine uptake. A nonselective ETA-ETB receptor antagonist (PD 142893) blocked [3H]thymidine uptake, but ETB receptor-selective agonists (S6c and [Ala1,Ala3,Ala11,Ala15]ET-1(6-21)) were unable to increase [Ca2+]i or [3H]thymidine uptake. Collectively, these data suggest that mitogenic signaling occurs through an ETA receptor subtype in mesangial cells. Experiments with both PKC inhibition and depletion demonstrate that PKC was necessary but not sufficient for mitogenic signaling. ET-1 increased tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular proteins in quiescent mesangial cells that was blocked by preincubation with herbimycin A. Two chemically and mechanistically dissimilar PTK inhibitors (herbimycin A and genistein) blocked [3H]thymidine uptake by ET-1. In addition, herbimycin A attenuated c-fos induction, AP-1 DNA binding, and transcription directed by an AP-1 cis-element in response to ET-1. Taken together, these data suggest that mitogenic signaling by ET-1 also involves a PTK-based mechanism. We further demonstrated that ET-1 stimulated autophosphorylation of pp60c-src and pp60c-src-catalyzed phosphorylation of a peptide substrate specific for PTK activity. That the dose-response relationship for ET-1-induced pp60c-src activation and [3H]thymidine uptake were similar suggests that these events might be functionally linked. Thus, cross-talk between G protein-coupled receptors and nonreceptor PTK such as pp60c-src might be involved in transcriptional regulation and mitogenic signaling by ET-1."
https://openalex.org/W1578619398,"Thrombin, a protease generated at sites of vascular injury, signals cellular responses vital for hemostasis and thrombosis. How thrombin, an enzyme rather than a classical ligand, effects graded and concentration-dependent responses in its target cells has been a long-standing question. Thrombin activates its receptor by cleaving off an activation peptide to unmask a tethered peptide ligand. We utilized a thrombin receptor with an epitope-tagged activation peptide to directly demonstrate thrombin receptor cleavage and to examine the kinetics of receptor activation on intact cells. The rate of thrombin receptor cleavage was proportional to thrombin concentration over the physiologic range, but low thrombin concentrations ultimately cleaved and all receptors. Cumulative phosphoinositide hydrolysis in response to thrombin correlated precisely with cumulative receptor cleavage. These data strongly suggest that each cleaved and thrombin receptor produces a of phosphatidylinositol hydrolysis, then shuts off. Surprisingly, this shut off occurred despite the continued presence of cleaved and activated receptors on the cell surface and at a time when the cells were refractory to thrombin but sensitive to agonist peptide, suggesting that a novel shut off mechanism may have evolved to deal with the tethered ligand. Unlike the case with classical ligands, cells thus cannot detect differences in thrombin concentrations as differences in fractional occupancy but rather must sense different rates of receptor activation. Because each cleaved thrombin receptor generates a quantum of second messenger, the magnitude of the cell's response to thrombin must be determined by the balance between rates of receptor activation and second messenger clearance."
https://openalex.org/W1579646504,"Replication of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) requires reverse transcriptase (RT) to synthesize double-stranded proviral DNA (9.7 kilobases) through a complex mechanism utilizing both RNA and DNA templates. We have examined DNA synthesis by HIV-1 RT on RNA and DNA templates derived from the HIV-1 genome using a primer extension assay in vitro. Analysis of polymerization products on sequencing gels revealed strong pauses in synthesis, on both RNA and DNA templates, in homopolymeric nucleotide runs, and at regions of predicted secondary structure. Polymerization pauses occurred in runs of template rGs (> or = 4 bases) and rCs (> or = 3 bases) during minus-strand synthesis on RNA templates, and in most runs (> or = 4 bases) of template dTs and dAs during plus-strand synthesis on DNA templates. Pausing also occurred on both templates within the first few nucleotides of the predicted hairpin structures of the Rev response element. The locations of pauses were dependent on template sequence and were unaffected by primer positioning, RT concentration, and ionic strength. Recombinant and virion-derived HIV-1 RTs showed similar pausing patterns. DNA products that accumulated at HIV-1 RT pause sites on RNA templates were extended by continued incubation with excess RT from Moloney murine leukemia virus, showing that the RNA templates were not broken or otherwise unable to support polymerization. Polymerizations conducted in the presence of a poly(rA) oligo(dT) trap showed that pausing results from two mechanisms: 1) RT remaining bound to the primer-template and polymerizing at a greatly reduced rate, or 2) RT dissociating from the primer-template. These results demonstrate that specific HIV-1 RNA and DNA template sequences are capable of interrupting processive DNA synthesis by HIV-1 RT in vitro. Pausing may serve specific functions in HIV-1 replication and mutagenesis. Moreover, these data suggest that one or more accessory factors are required to complete proviral DNA synthesis in vivo and that efficient HIV-1 DNA synthesis may require multiple origins."
https://openalex.org/W1595316354,"Apolipoprotein (apo) E3-Leiden, described in a large Dutch family, is associated with a dominantly inherited form of familial dysbetalipoproteinemia. To study the effect of the APOE*3-Leiden mutation in vivo, transgenic mice were generated using a genomic 27-kilobase DNA construct isolated from the APOE*3-Leiden proband. This construct carried the APOE gene, the APOC1 gene, and all known regulatory elements including an element that mediates liver expression. Three strains were generated that showed human APOE and APOC1 expression. All strains had significantly elevated levels of total plasma cholesterol and triglycerides on a regular diet. When mice of one strain were fed a semisynthetic cholesterol-rich diet, total plasma cholesterol and triglyceride levels increased dramatically. This increase was observed mainly in the very low density lipoprotein (VLDL)- and low density lipoprotein (LDL)-sized fractions. In cholesterol-fed mice, the apoE3-Leiden protein became equally distributed between the VLDL/LDL and HDL-sized fractions, while in mice kept on a regular diet, apoE3-Leiden protein was mainly associated with HDL-sized fractions. The presence of hyperlipoproteinemia in the APOE*3-Leiden-expressing transgenic mice supports our finding that the apoE3-Leiden variant behaves like a dominant trait in the expression of familial dysbetalipoproteinemia. ApoE3-Leiden transgenic mice may serve as a model to elucidate additional factors involved in the metabolism of apoE containing remnant lipoproteins in general and the etiology of familial dysbetalipoproteinemia in particular."
https://openalex.org/W2114790713,"F11 is a glycosyl phosphatidylinositol-anchored axonal surface glycoprotein belonging to a neural subgroup of the immunoglobulin superfamily. In this report, we demonstrate that the F11 protein displays three distinguishable activities: binding to the cell recognition molecule Ng-CAM, interaction with the extracellular matrix glycoprotein restrictin (RN), and a neurite outgrowth-promoting activity. By analyzing deletion mutants expressed in transfected COS cells, epitope mapping of monoclonal antibodies, and neurite outgrowth assays, we reveal that these activities can be localized to distinct regions within the F11 protein. The Ng-CAM-binding site resides in the first two immunoglobulin-like domains of F11, whereas the RN-binding site resides in the second or third domain. A neurite outgrowth-promoting activity of F11 characterized by in vitro culture of tectal cells is independent of F11-Ng-CAM and F11-RN binding."
https://openalex.org/W2018414056,"Mutations in the gene encoding the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) cause cystic fibrosis; the most common mutation is deletion of phenylalanine at position 508 (delta F508). We constructed STE6-CFTR chimeras with portions of the first nucleotide-binding domain (NBD1) of the yeast STE6 a-factor transporter replaced by portions of CFTR NBD1. The chimeras were functional in yeast, but mating efficiency decreased when delta F508 was introduced into NBD1. We isolated two delta F508 revertant mutations (R553M and R553Q) that restored mating; both were located within the CFTR NBD1 sequence. Introduction of these revertant mutations into human CFTR partially corrected the processing and Cl- channel gating defects caused by the delta F508 mutation. These results suggest that the NBD1s of CFTR and STE6 share a similar structure and function and that, in CFTR, the regions containing F508 and R553 interact. They also indicate that the abnormal conformation produced by delta F508 can be partially corrected by additional alterations in the protein."
https://openalex.org/W1538620682,"The agonist-occupied forms of several G-protein-coupled receptors that modulate the activity of adenylycyclase via Gs (e.g. beta 2-adrenergic) or Gi (e.g. alpha 2-adrenergic and cardiac muscarinic) are phosphorylated by beta-adrenergic receptor kinases (beta ARK 1 and beta ARK 2). beta ARK-catalyzed phosphorylation of these receptors appears to correlate with their agonist-induced desensitization. The possibility that beta ARK isozymes may also be involved in the desensitization of other G-protein-coupled receptors such as those mediating phosphoinositide (PI) hydrolysis was tested by determining the phosphorylation of the substance P receptor (SPR), which is coupled to PI hydrolysis in numerous tissues. Rat SPR was expressed in Sf9 cells, partially purified, and reconstituted in phospholipid vesicles. The reconstituted SPR bound the SPR agonist substance P, 125I-labeled with Bolton-Hunter reagent, with low affinity. However, addition of purified Gq/11 to the reconstituted SPR resulted in the conversion of all the receptors to a high affinity state, suggesting that SPR couples to Gq/11. Phosphorylation of the reconstituted SPR with purified beta ARK 1 or 2 in the absence and presence of substance P (SP) was then studied. In the presence of 100 microM SP, both kinases promoted phosphorylation of the receptor to a stoichiometry of 9 +/- 2 mol of phosphate/mol of receptor. However, no phosphorylation of the receptor could be detected in the absence of agonist. Agonist-induced phosphorylation of the receptor was blocked by coincubation with the SPR antagonist spantide. These results show that beta ARK isozymes may regulate the function of both adenylylcyclase as well as PI-coupled receptors, and suggest a role for beta ARK isozymes in SPR signal transduction."
https://openalex.org/W1479831223,"We have identified two discrete hyaluronan- (HA) binding domains in the HA receptor RHAMM (Receptor for HA-Mediated Motility) that mediates the locomotion of H-ras transformed fibroblasts. A complete RHAMM cDNA (1.43 kilobases (kb)) was expressed as a fusion protein with pGEX-2T in Escherichia coli HB101 and was shown to bind specifically to both biotin-labeled HA in a transblot assay and to HA-Sepharose. The complete cDNA was truncated with restriction endonucleases from the 3' end resulting in 1.30-, 1.02-, 0.71-, and 0.41-kb cDNAs which were then expressed in HB101. Only the fusion peptide expressed from the complete cDNA and the 1.30-kb cDNA bound to HA indicating that the region located between 1.02-1.30 kb of RHAMM cDNA was critical for recognition of this glycosaminoglycan. Deletion of 114 bases in this region virtually eliminated HA binding activity thus defining the major glycosaminoglycan binding region to amino acids 400-434 located near the carboxyl terminus of RHAMM. Two domains containing clusters of basic amino acids were identified within this region. Synthetic peptides mimicking these two domains both inhibited HA binding to the complete 1.43-kb expressed glutathione s-transferase-RHAMM fusion protein, and also directly bound to HA-Sepharose. Random peptides and peptides mimicking other regions in RHAMM did not inhibit HA-RHAMM interactions and bound weakly to HA-Sepharose. Oligonucleotides encoding either of these two peptides were linked to the NH2-terminal 0.71 kb of RHAMM which encoded a peptide that did not contain HA binding activity. Fusion proteins containing either of these recombinant peptides acquired HA binding activity as assessed with a transblot assay. Thus, we have identified two domains within RHAMM that are responsible for its HA binding activity."
https://openalex.org/W1694771231,"Ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) has been described as a neuro-active cytokine that shares functional similarities with the leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF). We demonstrate here that, like LIF, CNTF stimulates expression of acute phase plasma proteins in rat H-35 hepatoma cells. Transfection of the LIF receptor into Hep3B hepatoma cells reconstituted LIF and oncostatin M regulation of acute phase plasma protein genes. Co-expression of the LIF receptor and the CNTF receptor, but not expression of either subunit alone, generated CNTF responsiveness in Hep3B cells, suggesting cooperativity of these receptor subunits. Evidence is presented for direct interaction of the LIF receptor with the intracellular signal transduction machinery."
https://openalex.org/W1539115017,"Vitronectin (VN), a major cell adhesion protein, is found in plasma and in the extracellular matrix. At least three distinct cell surface receptors for vitronectin belonging to the integrin superfamily have been identified in normal and neoplastic cells. Many cell adhesion ligands, including vitronectin, contain an Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) sequence mediating, in part, the ligand-receptor interaction. These ligands bind different integrins with varying specificity and affinity. The mechanism of receptor specificity remains controversial. To determine the role of the RGD sequence in receptor specificity, we amplified the cDNA for human vitronectin from a liver cDNA library and generated two separate mutants by utilizing site-directed mutagenesis resulting in aspartic acid (Asp47) to glutamic acid (Glu47) substitution and glycine (Gly46) to alanine (Ala46) substitution. The mammalian expression vector, pZEM229R, was used to transfect baby hamster kidney cells which secreted recombinant proteins into the supernatant. All recombinant proteins were isolated by heparin-agarose chromatography and tested for interaction with three known vitronectin receptors, namely, alpha IIIb beta 3 on thrombin-activated platelets, alpha v beta 3 on human umbilical vein endothelial cells and alpha v beta 5 on Panc-1 cells. Recombinant wild-type vitronectin behaved in a fashion similar to plasma-derived vitronectin. Both the RGE-VN and RAD-VN recombinant mutant proteins showed complete loss of cell adhesion activity, regardless of the receptor. These results confirm the essential and central role of the RGD sequence in vitronectin for cell adhesion. This expression system allows further structure/function analysis of vitronectin."
https://openalex.org/W1575824270,"Mouse mast cell protease (mMCP) 1, mMCP-2, mMCP-4, and mMCP-5 are serine proteases which are predicted to have chymotryptic specificity (chymases). They are bound to negatively charged heparin or chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans and are stored in secretory granules. Three-dimensional (3D) models of these four proteases were constructed with a comparative molecular modeling technique based on satisfaction of spatial constraints. The models were used to predict immunogenic epitopes and surface regions that are likely to interact with proteoglycans. Nine potential antigenic segments in the four chymases were identified on the basis of solvent accessibility, protrusion, flexibility, and sequence variability. These segments are suitable epitopes for preparation of protease-specific antipeptide immunoglobulin. Two regions with net charges ranging from +6 to +10 at neutral pH were found on the surfaces of mMCP-4 and mMCP-5. The two regions are located far from the substrate binding cleft at diametrically opposite ends of the folded proteases. A strong positive electrostatic potential surrounds the two regions. Thus, they are good candidates for binding sites that interact with heparin proteoglycan in the granules of serosal mast cells. In contrast, mMCP-1 and mMCP-2, which are present in granules of mucosal mast cells that contain chondroitin sulfate, lack one of these regions and have a lower charge density in the other. The differences between the 3D models provide a structural basis for the selective localization of specific chymases within mouse mast cells that contain different proteoglycans."

https://openalex.org/W1490194809,"The importance of growth factor-mediated immediate-early cellular events to the cell cycle has influenced the development and identity of oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes as well as the concept that growth factors commit mammalian cells to enter a biochemical program that ultimately yields DNA synthesis. However, the mid and late events involved in the regulation of growth factor-induced signal transduction remain largely unknown. In this report we demonstrate that BALB/c 3T3 cells require continuous exposure to fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-1 for a minimum of 12 h to achieve near maximal DNA synthesis. This correlates with the continuous internalization of radiolabeled FGF-1 into the cytosol and nucleus of BALB/c 3T3 cells and the maintenance of a low level of FGF receptors on the cell surface during the entire G1 phase of the cell cycle. Further analysis demonstrates the maintenance of a continuous series of differential FGF-1-induced tyrosine phosphorylation events including the phosphorylation of phospholipase C-gamma as well as novel FGF receptor polypeptide substrates, p60, p85, p90, and p130 throughout the G1 phase of the BALB/c 3T3 cell cycle. The tyrosine phosphorylation events are biphasic during the 12-h period after the administration of FGF-1, and the second phase is characterized by hyper-tyrosine phosphorylation of p60, p85, and p130. Interestingly, NIH 3T3 cells which overexpress the FGF receptor-1 polypeptide demonstrate exaggerated tyrosine phosphorylation of p60 and p85 but not p90 and exhibit growth factor-independent cell proliferation. These results suggest that the initiation of DNA synthesis in BALB/c 3T3 cells by FGF-1 is regulated by a complex biochemical program that involves the continuous tyrosine phosphorylation of known and novel polypeptides throughout the G0 to G1 transition period of the cell cycle."
https://openalex.org/W1801236538,"In human mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), the tRNA genes are located in three different transcription units that are transcribed at three different rates. To analyze the regulation of tRNA formation by the three transcription units, we have examined the steady-state levels and metabolic properties of the tRNAs of HeLa cell mitochondria. DNA excess hybridization experiments utilizing separated strands of mtDNA and purified tRNA samples from exponential cells long term labeled with [32P]orthophosphate have revealed a steady-state level of 6 x 10(5) tRNA molecules/cell, with three-fourths being encoded in the H-strand and one-fourth in the L-strand. Hybridization of the tRNAs with a panel of M13 clones of human mtDNA containing, in most cases, single tRNA genes and a quantitation of two-dimensional electrophoretic fractionations of the tRNAs have shown that the steady-state levels of tRNA(Phe) and tRNA(Val) are two to three times higher than the average level of the other H-strand-encoded tRNAs and three to four times higher than the average level of the L-strand-encoded tRNAs. Similar experiments carried out with tRNAs isolated from cells labeled with very short pulses of [5-3H]uridine have indicated that the rates of formation of the individual tRNA species are proportional to their steady-state amounts. Therefore, the approximately 25-fold higher rate of transcription of the tRNA(Phe) and tRNA(Val) genes relative to the other H-strand tRNA genes and the 10-16-fold higher rate of transcription of the L-strand tRNA genes relative to the H-strand tRNA genes are not reflected in the steady-state levels or the rates of formation of the corresponding tRNAs. A comparison of the steady-state levels of the individual tRNAs with the corresponding codon usage for protein synthesis, as determined from the DNA sequence and the rates of synthesis of the various polypeptides, has not revealed any significant correlation between the two parameters."
https://openalex.org/W2071434291,"Ribozymes derived from the self-splicing pre-ribosomal RNA of Tetrahymena act as sequence-specific endonucleases. The reaction involves binding an RNA or DNA substrate by base pairing to the internal guide sequence (IGS) to form helix P1. Site-specific photo-crosslinking localized the 5' end of the IGS in helix P1 to the vicinity of conserved bases between helices P4 and P5, supporting a major feature of the Michel-Westhof three-dimensional structure model. The crosslinked ribozyme retained catalytic activity. When not base-paired, the IGS was still specifically crosslinked, but the major site was 37 A distant from the reactive site in the experimentally supported three-dimensional model. The data indicate that a substantial induced-fit conformational change accompanies P1 formation, and they provide a physical basis for understanding the transport of oligonucleotides to the catalytic core of the ribozyme. The ability of RNA to orchestrate large-scale conformational changes may help explain why the ribosome and the spliceosome are RNA-based machines."
https://openalex.org/W1603916956,"A number of post-transcriptional modifications in tRNA are phylogenetically characteristic of the bacterial, eukaryal, or archaeal domains, both with respect to sequence location and molecular structure at the nucleoside level. One of the most distinct such modifications is nucleoside G*, located in archaeal tRNA at position 15, which in bacterial and eukaryal tRNAs is a conserved site involved in maintenance of the dihydrouridine loop-T-loop tertiary interactions. G* occurs widely in nearly every branch of the archaeal phylogenetic domain, in contrast to its absence in all reported bacterial and eukaryal tRNA sequences. The structure of G*-15 is 2-amino-4,7-dihydro-4-oxo-7-beta-D-ribofuranosyl-1H- pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidine-5-carboximidamide (7-formamidino-7-deazaguanosine), which is a non-purine, non-pyrimidine ribonucleoside; its structure thus reflects extensive modification beyond the guanine-15 specified by corresponding gene sequences. The structure was established by mass spectrometry, and in particular from collision-induced dissociation mass spectra of derivatives formed by microscale permethylation, and is confirmed by chemical synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1497415198,"HC2/bikunin is a human plasma proteinase inhibitor composed of two polypeptide chains that resist dissociation under reducing conditions in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. This observation suggests that a nondisulfide cross-link is responsible for the association of these two polypeptide chains. In this study, we have utilized a variety of techniques to investigate the structural basis for this observation. We show that the cross-link between the two protein chains is sensitive to chondroitin sulfate-degrading enzymes and to 50 mM NaOH, properties shared by the protein-glycosaminoglycan-protein cross-link found in the related pre-alpha-inhibitor (Enghild, J. J., Salvesen, G., Hefta, S., Thogersen, I. B., Rutherfurd, S., and Pizzo, S. V. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 747-751). Biochemical and mass spectrometric analysis of the peptides containing the cross-link indicate that it is mediated by a chondroitin-4-sulfate chain that originates from a typical O-glycosidic link to Ser10 of bikunin. The COOH-terminal Asp648 residue of heavy chain 2 is esterified via the alpha-carbon to C-6 of an internal N-acetylgalactosamine of the chondroitin-4-sulfate chain. This suggests that the protein-glycosaminoglycan-protein cross-link that assembles the chains of pre-alpha-inhibitor is identical to that which assembles HC2/bikunin, and is probably a characteristic of the bikunin proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1520647240,"A minimal kinetic mechanism for HIV reverse transcriptase (RT)-catalyzed RNA-dependent and DNA-dependent DNA polymerization was determined by pre-steady-state kinetic methods to be: [formula: see text] where E, TP, dNTP, and PPi are RT, template-primer, 2'-deoxynucleoside 5'-triphosphate, and inorganic pyrophosphate, respectively. Defined sequence template-primers that encode for incorporation of dTTP were prepared by annealing either a 44-mer RNA template or a 44-mer DNA template (of the same sequence) to a 21-mer DNA primer (r44:d21-mer and d44:d21-mer, respectively). The values of the above kinetic constants were determined for dTMP and 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine 5'-monophosphate (AZTMP) incorporation into both template primers. The kcat and Km values calculated from these kinetic constants were similar to the values directly determined from steady-state experiments. Further, the net rate constants for processive incorporation of three successive nucleotides into the r44:d21-mer were similar indicating that a rate-determining step did not follow catalysis. A 20-fold difference in the rate constants (kp) for incorporation of dTMP into the r44:d21-mer versus the d44:d21-mer was largely responsible for the difference in the calculated processivity numbers of 340 and 5, respectively. Finally, the rate constant for pyrophosphorolysis of the 3'-AZTMP-terminated r44:d21-mer (kpyro) was similar to the rate constant for dissociation of the chain-terminated template primer from the enzyme (koff) indicating that millimolar concentrations of intracellular inorganic pyrophosphate would be required for pyrophosphorolysis of AZTMP-terminated retroviral genomes."
https://openalex.org/W1568194658,"Superparamagnetic particles were prepared with iron oxide cores of congruent to 8 nm diameter and dextran coats. After feeding the probe to the amoeba, Dictyostelium discoideum, for 15 min and chasing for 15 min, a lysosome fraction was isolated magnetically. Isolates contained 76% of ingested iron, 82% of ingested fluorescent dextran, 1.3% of cell protein, 4% of the lipid, 28% of acid phosphatase, and 5% of the vacuolar H(+)-ATPase. Enrichment in endocytic markers was congruent to 60-fold; markers for other organelles were < 0.5%. The lysosomes were homogeneous, round (0.4-1.1 microns in diameter), and frequently adherent to one another through zones of intimate apposition. Cells were also fed the iron probe continuously for 3 h to fill their entire endocytic pathway; in this case, isolates contained 3.3% of cell protein, 11% of lipid, and 49% of cell acid phosphatase. Bis(monoacylglycerol)phosphate (BMP), a lipid characteristic of lysosomes in animal cells, comprised congruent to 6% of biosynthetically labelled cell lipids and up to half of the lipid in the endocytic pathway. Essentially all of the cellular BMP was recovered in isolates prepared after 3 h of feeding. The specificity and abundance of BMP in the endocytic organelles of this early diverged protist suggests that this phospholipid serves a universal and essential function in endocytosis."
https://openalex.org/W1582519059,"During processive DNA synthesis in vitro, the human immunoefficiency virus, type 1 (HIV-1) reverse transcriptase encounters template nucleotide positions at which continued synthesis is difficult. At these positions, the enzyme has a relatively high probability of dissociating from the template, and product molecules of corresponding length accumulate as the incubation proceeds. These positions, which are known as termination sites, could be associated with template secondary structures in some cases, but many termination sites appear to be template sequence-related rather than secondary structure-related. Mechanisms producing these blocks in processive DNA synthesis are not well understood. In this study, to examine further the effects of template sequence on termination, we engineered selected single-base changes in the M13mp2 template, and we found that such changes can influence termination. Several general trends emerged from the study. First, strong termination sites rarely correspond to dATP as the incoming substrate opposite template T. Second, the sequence of the template-primer stem is more important for termination than the sequence of the single-stranded template ahead of the primer. Thus, we note the phenomenon of action at a distance: changing sequence at one nucleotide position in the template-primer stem alters termination at other positions, a few nucleotides distant at the primer 3' end. A and C as template bases in the template-primer stem have opposite effects. A is the strongest terminator residue, and C is the weakest terminator residue, followed by G. Since termination sites are produced by reverse transcriptase dissociation from the template-primer, the results suggest that the HIV-1 reverse transcriptase has properties reminiscent of a sequence-specific double-stranded DNA-binding protein in that its binding mechanism can distinguish both base residues and positions in the double-stranded DNA template-primer stem."

https://openalex.org/W1537493052,"We investigated the participation of prostaglandin (PG) E2 in the regulation of the alpha 1(I) procollagen gene expression by tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha), and interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) in normal adult human lung fibroblasts. TNF alpha (100 units/ml) and IL-1 beta (100 units/ml) stimulated the production of PGE2 and caused a dose-dependent inhibition of up to 54 and 66%, respectively, of the production of type I procollagen. Preincubation of cultures with indomethacin partially reversed the inhibition of procollagen production induced by the cytokines. Cytokine-stimulated endogenous fibroblast PG accounted for 35 and 68% of the inhibition induced by TNF alpha and IL-1 beta, respectively. Steady-state mRNA levels for alpha 1(I) procollagen paralleled the changes in collagen production. The transcription rate of the alpha 1(I) procollagen gene was reduced by 58% by TNF alpha and by 43% by IL-1 beta. Cytokine-stimulated endogenous PG production accounted for half of these effects. These results indicate that TNF alpha and IL-1 beta inhibit the expression of the alpha 1(I) procollagen gene in human lung fibroblasts at the transcriptional level by a PGE2-independent effect as well as through the effect of endogenous fibroblast PGE2 released under the stimulus of the cytokines."
https://openalex.org/W1515661682,"The antifungal imidazoles miconazole, ketoconazole, and clotrimazole inhibit citrulline formation by nitric-oxide synthase. These agents both increase the concentration of calmodulin required to activate the enzyme half-maximally and reduce the maximal velocity of citrulline formation. This inhibition was not reversed by increased concentrations of either the arginine substrate or (6R)-5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-L-biopterin. Miconazole, ketoconazole, and clotrimazole also inhibited the cytochrome-c reductase activity of nitric-oxide synthase competitively versus calmodulin concentration, with apparent Ki (IC50) values of 8, 20, and 0.8 microM, respectively. Miconazole, ketoconazole, and clotrimazole inhibited the activity of calmodulin-dependent cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase competitively versus calmodulin concentration, with apparent Ki values of 6, 18, and 25 microM, respectively. These observations are consistent with the proposal that the antifungal imidazoles inhibit citrulline formation by interaction with the nitric-oxide synthase at two sites. Interaction at site 1 reduces the responsiveness of the enzyme to activation by calmodulin, whereas interaction at site 2 (involving putative binding of the imidazole to the heme iron) reduces the maximal velocity of citrulline formation. The interactions of calmodulin antagonists at site 1 occur at substantially lower concentrations of drug than those at site 2 and are the principal determinant of enzyme inhibition."
https://openalex.org/W1493873711,"Kininogens, the large precursor molecules of the vasoactive kinin peptides, are prototypic multidomain proteins serving numerous functions. To investigate their structure-function relationships, we have raised a panel of monoclonal antibodies against human H-kininogen and L-kininogen and fragments thereof and characterized them with respect to their target epitopes. Of 35 antibodies, 12 were directed to the amino-terminal domains (D1 to D3) of cystatin-like structure, 3 recognized domain D4 bearing the kinin segment, 17 bound to the carboxyl-terminal domains of H-kininogen (D5H and D6H), and 3 bound to the carboxyl-terminal domain D5L of L-kininogen. At least 14 distinct epitopes spread over the kininogen molecules were identified: 9 epitopes located on L-kininogen and 13 epitopes harbored by H-kininogen. Of these, 8 are shared by the two types of kininogens. Fine mapping of the epitopes by proteolytic fragments, recombinant proteins, and anti-idiotypic antibodies demonstrated that most but not all of the antibodies recognize liner epitopes. Synthesis of 28 peptides covering more than one-third of the entire kininogen sequences allowed us to narrow down seven major epitopes to 7-31 residues. Functional analyses identified 14 antibodies interfering with specific biological roles of the kininogens, i.e. cysteine proteinase inhibition, platelet attachment, cofactor binding, contact activation, and kinin delivery. Cross-reactivity studies indicated that three of the epitopes are present throughout the mammalian kininogens and further identified a unique epitope characteristic for the H/L-type of kininogens not present in their T-type. The panel of mapped antibodies provides powerful tools for the characterization of relevant interaction sites exposed by the pleiotropic kininogens and for the development of molecular surrogates mimicking these functional loci."
https://openalex.org/W2158716547,"Abstract In hepatocytes, insulin-like growth factor-binding protein-1 (IGFBP-1) levels are increased by glucocorticoids and by agents that raise intracellular cAMP levels such as glucagon, theophylline, forskolin, and cAMP analogues. In contrast, insulin lowers IGFBP-1 levels, an effect dominant over the glucocorticoid and cAMP effects. Previous studies showed that dibutyryl cAMP (Bt2cAMP) and theophylline increase IGFBP-1 promoter activity in HEP G2 human hepatoma cells and that insulin abolishes this increase. In studies reported here, HEP G2 cells were used to further evaluate the role of cAMP in stimulating IGFBP-1 expression. Initial studies found that either 0.5 or 5.0 mM Bt2cAMP alone, or the combination of 0.5 mM Bt2cAMP and 2 mM theophylline, increased IGFBP-1 protein levels, mRNA levels, and promoter activity, but that the addition of theophylline to Bt2cAMP was required to give a approximately 5-fold increase in promoter activity. Deletion mutations of the IGFBP-1 promoter were used to show that much of the effect of Bt2cAMP and theophylline was conferred by the region between 269 and 246 base pairs (bp) 5' of the IGFBP-1 mRNA cap site. DNase I protection assays showed that HEP G2 nuclear extract footprinted the region from 273 to 249 bp 5' of the cap site; this region, designated P2, has a central CGTCA motif common to cAMP-responsive elements (CREs). Mutating the CGTCA motif in the 1205-bp IGFBP-1 promoter construct to TAGCA led to a 51% decrease in the ability of Bt2cAMP and theophylline to stimulate IGFBP-1 promoter activity above control levels. In addition, cotransfection of the catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) with the native 1205-bp IGFBP-1 promoter construct stimulated IGFBP-1 promoter activity 3.9-fold, but the TAGCA mutation decreased by 73% the ability of PKA to stimulate IGFBP-1 promoter activity above control levels. Mutating the CGTCA motif to TAGCA also blocked the ability of both crude HEP G2 nuclear extract and recombinant CRE-binding protein to bind to the P2 element. These data suggest that the P2 element is a CRE that confers at least part of the stimulatory effect of cAMP on the human IGFBP-1 promoter."
https://openalex.org/W1543075879,"Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, which generates putative novel second messenger phospholipids, is a heterodimer composed of regulatory adaptor 85-kDa and catalytic 110-kDa subunits. The p85 alpha subunit contains a NH2-terminal src homology (SH) 3 domain, a region with homology to the product of the breakpoint cluster region (bcr) gene, and a COOH-terminal portion of the molecule which contains two SH2 domains, separated by a spacer region. In this study a panel of monoclonal antibodies (mAb) was raised against recombinant bovine p85 alpha to probe its multidomain structure in relation to function. These mAbs were characterized using a BIAcore biosensor instrument. Epitopes for nine mAbs were mapped in relation to the domain structure of p85 alpha using recombinant protein fragments expressed in bacteria. These mAbs were then used to map the sites on p85 alpha which are involved in growth factor receptor binding. Two interesting classes of functional mAbs were identified. First, mAb U14, whose epitope lies within the NH2-terminal SH2 domain of p85 alpha, blocked the interaction of p85 alpha with activated protein-tyrosine kinase receptors. Second, real-time binding experiments using phospholipid-containing vesicles showed that p85 alpha by itself could specifically bind certain phospholipids. Two mAbs (U9 and U15) with epitopes located in the inter-SH2 spacer region blocked the binding of lipids to this site. The relevance of these observations to understanding the relationship of structure to function of p85 and the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1481748312,"Treatment of quiescent Swiss 3T3 cells with 20 microM ([(3,4,5-trihydroxyphenyl)methylene]propanedinitrile) (tyrphostin) caused a 76% reduction in the tyrosine phosphorylation of the M(r) 110,000-130,000 band induced by bombesin. This was accompanied by a 48% reduction in the tyrosine phosphorylation of the cytosolic tyrosine kinase p125 focal adhesion kinase. Preincubation with 20 microM tyrphostin did not inhibit either protein kinase A activation by forskolin or protein kinase C (PKC) activation by phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate in intact Swiss 3T3 cells. Similarly, 20 microM tyrphostin neither interfered with binding of bombesin to its receptor nor prevented bombesin-stimulated Ca2+ mobilization or PKC activation. Thus tyrphostin selectively inhibits tyrosine phosphorylation induced by bombesin in intact Swiss 3T3 cells. Consequently, we examined the contribution of this tyrosine phosphorylation pathway to the subsequent induction of c-fos and stimulation of mitogenesis by bombesin. Tyrphostin prevented both c-fos mRNA expression and DNA synthesis induced by bombesin. The incorporation of [3H] thymidine was inhibited by tyrphostin in a dose-dependent manner (IC50 = 20 microM), and this effect was not reversed even at high concentrations of bombesin. These results provide evidence that tyrosine phosphorylation is a mitogenic signal for bombesin."
https://openalex.org/W1513264682,"Although the plasminogen activating equimolar complex of staphylokinase (STA) with human plasmin is very rapidly inhibited by alpha 2-antiplasmin, STA is a potent fibrinolytic agent in a human plasma milieu which contains 1 microM alpha 2-antiplasmin. In the present study, it was found that the complex of plasmin with recombinant STA (STAR), after neutralization with alpha 2-antiplasmin, retained the full plasminogen activating potential of STAR when added to a plasminogen solution (93 +/- 5% residual activity). When added to human plasma containing a 125I-fibrin-labeled plasma clot, equi-effective concentrations (causing 50% lysis in 2 h) were 17 +/- 3.0, 13 +/- 1.0, and 20 +/- 1.0 nM for STAR, equimolar plasmin-STAR mixtures, and plasmin-STAR mixtures neutralized by alpha 2-antiplasmin, respectively. Gel filtration of mixtures of plasmin(ogen) and STAR revealed elution as plasmin-STAR complex (Mr approximately 100,000), whereas after addition of alpha 2-antiplasmin, STAR eluted with an apparent Mr of 20,000. When mixtures of plasmin and STAR were adsorbed to lysine-Sepharose, STAR adsorbed quantitatively (96 +/- 1%) to the gel, whereas it was nearly quantitatively recovered in the unbound fraction (92 +/- 4%) after addition of alpha 2-antiplasmin to the mixture. Scatchard analysis of the binding of STAR to plasmin-Sepharose yielded a dissociation constant of 55 nM, whereas no specific binding of STAR to plasmin-alpha 2-antiplasmin-Sepharose could be demonstrated. These findings indicate that, both in purified systems and in a human plasma milieu containing a 125I-fibrin-labeled plasma clot, neutralization of the plasmin-STAR complex by alpha 2-antiplasmin results in dissociation of functionally active STAR from the complex and recycling of STAR to other plasminogen molecules. This dissociation-recycling process may explain the high fibrinolytic potency of STAR in a plasma milieu in the presence of high concentrations of alpha 2-antiplasmin."
https://openalex.org/W1520016970,"Vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM1) is a member of the immunoglobulin (Ig) superfamily which interacts with the integrin very late antigen-4 (VLA4). The VCAM1/VLA4 interaction mediates both adhesion and signal transduction and is thought to play an important role in inflammatory and immune responses in vivo. VCAM1 cDNAs cloned from mouse, rat, rabbit, and human libraries contain six, seven, or eight extracellular Ig-like domains generated by alternate splicing, but to date shorter forms have not been found. We have cloned a novel cDNA encoding only the three N-terminal domains of murine VCAM1 followed by a unique C-terminal tail generated by alternate splicing of a previously undescribed exon. This truncated form of murine VCAM1 (3D-VCAM1) is expressed in COS cells as a functional adhesion molecule which is lost from the cell surface following treatment with phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C. 3D-VCAM1 is found only in endotoxin-treated but not control murine and rat tissues. Thus in rodents alternate splicing of the VCAM1 gene generates a unique truncated inflammation-specific phosphatidylinositol-linked form of VCAM1."
https://openalex.org/W1528650954,"Insulin induces the serine phosphorylation of the nucleolar protein nucleolin at subnanomolar concentrations in differentiated 3T3-442A cells. The stimulation is biphasic with phosphorylation reaching a maximum at 10 pM insulin and then declining to only 40% of basal levels at insulin concentrations of 1 microM. These changes are rapid, reaching half-maximal after 4 min and maximal after 15 min of incubation. The cell-permeable casein kinase II inhibitor 5,6-dichlorobenzimidazole-riboside prevents the insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of nucleolin suggesting that casein kinase II may mediate this effect of the hormone. Insulin-like growth factor 1 mimics the action of insulin on dephosphorylation of nucleolin at nanomolar concentrations suggesting that the latter effect may be mediated by insulin-like growth factor 1 receptors. Insulin treatment of 3T3-442A cells also results in a stimulation of RNA efflux from isolated, intact cell nuclei. The dose dependence of insulin-induced nucleolin phosphorylation and insulin-stimulated RNA efflux from intact cell nuclei are almost identical. Insulin induces an increase in the RNA efflux at subnanomolar concentrations in 3T3-442A adipocytes, while high (micromolar) concentrations of insulin inhibited the efflux of RNA. These data indicate that insulin regulates the phosphorylation/dephosphorylation of nucleolin, possibly via stimulation of casein kinase II, and this may play a role in regulation of the RNA efflux from nuclei."

Soluble clathrin is a three-legged structure (triskelion) comprising three identical heavy chains and three different light chains located toward the center of the triskelion on the proximal segment of the leg. All mammalian light chains contain a central domain of 10 heptad repeats, which is necessary for the interaction with heavy chain. Because the repeats are characteristic of alpha helical coiled coils, we proposed that the central domain had an extended conformation (Kirchhausen, T., Scarmato, P., and Harrison, S. C. et al. (1987) Science 236, 320-324). However, an alternative model has recently been proposed (Nathke, I. S., Heuser, J., Lupas, A., Stock, J., Turck, C. W., and Brodsky, F. M. (1992) Cell 68, 899-910). Here, we use single-molecule electron microscopy of clathrin decorated with monoclonal antibodies directed against different epitopes on light chains to show that the light chain central domain has an extended conformation and reaches along most of the proximal segment of the heavy chain leg."

Complementation of transposition mutants derived from clones containing the pJM1 iron uptake region revealed the existence of an antisense RNA, RNA alpha. This RNA is only expressed under iron-rich conditions and acts as a negative regulator of FatA synthesis, with slight but discernible decrease in the steady-state level of fatA mRNA determined by RNase protection and by Northern blot analysis. Primer extension experiments revealed that the level of several possible fatA transcripts was reduced in the presence of RNA alpha. In addition, we found that fatA mRNA expression is slightly reduced in the presence of Escherichia coli Fur. We have identified and cloned a chromosomally encoded fur-like gene in Vibrio anguillarum."

The channels were kinetically and pharmacologically defined using outside-out and cell-attached patches. They exhibited multiple conductance levels, predominantly 3-9 pS. Their slow gating in response to voltage change in outside-out patches was exhibited only in the presence of AIF-4 or GTP gamma S on the inner membrane surface and when the lower conductance states were dominant. In the absence of AIF-4 or GTP gamma S, the channels exhibited rapid activation and deactivation. We conclude that M-channel gating may be controlled by an associated GTP-binding protein."
https://openalex.org/W1508079805,"Meprins, membrane-bound oligomeric metalloendopeptidases, contain alpha and/or beta subunits. Their activities have been found in the mouse and rat kidney. The cloned cDNA for the mouse alpha subunit of meprin A (EC cloned cDNA for the mouse alpha subunit of meprin A (EC 3.4.24.18) was used here to survey mRNA expression in kidney of different mouse strains and in various tissues of mice and rats. A single message of 3.6 kilobases was found in kidney of random bred (ICR) and inbred mice (C57BL/6, DBA/2) that contain high meprin A activity and in Sprague-Dawley rat kidney. The alpha subunit message was undetectable in the kidney of C3H/He and CBA mice, inbred strains that do not express meprin A activity. Therefore, meprin A activity in the kidney of mouse strains correlates with the amount of alpha subunit mRNA present. The 3.6-kilobase mRNA meprin alpha subunit message was also detected in the small intestine of the rat but not in mice. No message was detected in brain, heart, skeletal muscle, liver, lung, or spleen of mice or rats. Polymerase chain reaction amplification or Southern blot analysis of genomic DNA revealed that the gene for the alpha subunit is present in all mouse strains as well as in human, monkey, rat, mouse, dog, cow, rabbit, and chicken, but it was not detected in yeast. There is one gene copy present in the mouse genome. The gene was localized to mouse chromosome 17 centromeric to the major histocompatibility complex (H-2) by the interspecific backcrossing method. The localization of this allele to Mep-1, the gene previously found to regulate the expression of meprin A activity in mice, supports the proposal that Mep-1 is the structural gene for the alpha subunit."
https://openalex.org/W1568829416,"Antibodies to synthetic peptides of human interleukin 1 beta (IL-1 beta) and to recombinant human IL-1 beta were used to identify epitopes of IL-1 beta associated with the neutralization of its biological activity. Analysis of antisera raised to 17 synthetic peptides derived from the mature IL-1 beta sequence showed that five regions (residues 6-15, 49-80, 58-80, 92-101, and 120-133) were both immunoprecipitating and neutralizing. Using a hexamer epitope mapping method, comparison of the regions recognized by four neutralizing rabbit antisera with those recognized by a rabbit antiserum raised to denatured IL-1 beta suggested two further neutralizing epitopes, residues 39-48 and 83-95. Finally, a neutralizing monoclonal antibody was shown to bind to the peptides 6-11 and 87-95 by peptide binding and mutagenesis. All of these regions appear predominantly on one face of IL-1 beta. The effect of mutations in residues 4-11 and 88-97, which lie within this face, on receptor binding and biological activity was determined. Most of the mutations tested affected both receptor binding and activity, whereas mutations in another face of IL-1 beta (residues 74-80) had no effect. Purification of two of the mutants with reduced bioactivity and receptor binding and analysis by two-dimensional NMR indicated no gross changes in tertiary structure. A third mutant had reduced bioactivity in two different bioassays but no change in receptor binding. Although two-dimensional NMR revealed no gross changes in conformation, small changes did occur at a site distal from that mutated. The data are consistent with other epitope mapping and receptor binding mutagenesis data and suggest that the neutralizing antibodies and receptor recognize different but overlapping regions of IL-1 beta."
https://openalex.org/W1584293387,"Abstract Glutamine phosphoribosylpyrophosphate amidotransferase, the key regulatory enzyme for de novo purine nucleotide synthesis, is subject to feedback regulation by adenine and guanine nucleotides. Affinity labeling with 5'-p-fluorosulfonylbenzoyladenosine (FSBA) and 8-azidoadenosine 5'-monophosphate (N3-AMP) was used to identify purine nucleotide sites for feedback control of the Escherichia coli amidotransferase. FSBA inactivated the amidotransferase with saturation kinetics. Specificity for inactivation was shown by the covalent attachment of 2.0-2.4 eq of [3H] sulfobenzoyladenosine (SBA) per subunit and protection by GMP and AMP against inactivation and incorporation of [3H]SBA. Six chymotryptic peptides modified with [3H]SBA were isolated and identified by differential labeling followed by high performance liquid chromatography and radioactivity. Mass spectrometry and Edman degradation analysis were used to identify 5 residues that were covalently modified by [3H]SBA: Tyr74, Tyr258, Lys326, Tyr329, and Tyr465. Tyr258 was also modified by N3-AMP. Mutant enzymes K326Q and Y329A had activity similar to that of the wild type enzyme. However, both mutants exhibited decreased sensitivity to inhibition by GMP and decreased binding of GMP but were inhibited by AMP. Mutant enzymes Y74A and Y258F were normally feedback-inhibited but were defective in glutamine amide transfer and synthase functions, respectively. Therefore Tyr74 and Tyr258 are important for activity and modification by FSBA and N3-AMP accounts for enzyme inactivation. These results localize residues important for catalysis in close proximity to a site for nucleotide binding. Two additional mutant enzymes, G331I and N351A, were constructed which were refractory to inhibition by GMP with little change in inhibition by AMP. A replacement of Tyr465 indicates that this residue is not essential for catalysis or feedback inhibition. Overall, these results are interpreted in terms of a two-nucleotide site model with Lys326, Tyr329, Gly331, and Asn351 defining a site required for inhibition by GMP. A second nucleotide site not affinity labeled by analogs is very close to or overlaps with the catalytic site."
https://openalex.org/W1552035033,"Salivary-specific and cAMP-inducible expression of the rat proline-rich protein gene RP4 is dependent on a 28-base pair sequence of a salivary-specific cAMP response element (SCRE) (Lin, H. H., and Ann, D. K. (1992) Gene Expression 2, 365-377). To unravel its trans-acting factor(s), we used double-stranded oligoprobes corresponding to the SCRE to screen a randomly primed lambda gt11 cDNA expression library made from RNA of rat salivary cells. In this report, we describe the cDNA cloning of these helix-loop-helix SCRE-binding proteins (SCBPs) and demonstrate that there are at least three isoforms in salivary cells, namely SCBP alpha, SCBP beta, and SCBP gamma. RNA polymerase chain reaction and sequence analyses further confirmed the existence of these three different SCBP isoforms, which code for putative proteins of 707, 706, and 682 amino acids, respectively. Expression of the cloned SCBP cDNAs in salivary cells stimulates the expression of a cotransfected reporter construct containing multicopies of the SCRE cloned upstream of the thymidine kinase promoter and the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase structural gene. This stimulation is much more pronounced in transfections in which SCBP alpha and SCBP beta are cotransfected than when they are transfected individually. Furthermore, when low concentrations of SCBP alpha and SCBP beta are cotransfected with the SCRE reporter gene, coexpression of the catalytic subunit of protein kinase A is required to efficiently activate the expression of the reporter gene. These results strongly suggest that the observed stimulation of the SCRE is achieved through the coordinated expression of the SCBP alpha, SCBP beta, and protein kinase A activities, perhaps via a direct association of the two SCBPs and their phosphorylation by protein kinase A. We conclude that the isolated SCBP alpha and SCBP beta cDNAs encode transcription activators that participate in the control of the inducible RP4 gene expression in salivary cells."

We show that upon mitogenic stimulation with anti-IgM antibodies and interleukin-2, specific mRNA for p56lck becomes detectable in B cells after 24 h of activation and is followed by an increase in p56lck protein expression on days 2 and 3. This up-regulation is specific for p56lck since expression of other src kinases such as fyn, lyn, or yes was not modified. Furthermore, immune complex kinase assays show that p56lck protein expressed on day 2 is associated with kinase activity. Experiments using lck-specific antisense oligonucleotides show that the G0-G1 transition does not require p56lck, whereas DNA synthesis is dependent upon its expression. Thus, our data demonstrate that p56lck expression is up-regulated during human B cell stimulation and this kinase plays an important role during the control of late steps of B lymphocyte activation such as S phase entry."
