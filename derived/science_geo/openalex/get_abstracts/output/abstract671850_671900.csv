However, the extent, origin, and drivers of ITH across cancer types are poorly understood. To address this, we extensively characterize ITH across whole-genome sequences of 2,658 cancer samples spanning 38 cancer types. Nearly all informative samples (95.1%) contain evidence of distinct subclonal expansions with frequent branching relationships between subclones. We observe positive selection of subclonal driver mutations across most cancer types and identify cancer type-specific subclonal patterns of driver gene mutations, fusions, structural variants, and copy number alterations as well as dynamic changes in mutational processes between subclonal expansions. Our results underline the importance of ITH and its drivers in tumor evolution and provide a pan-cancer resource of comprehensively annotated subclonal events from whole-genome sequencing data.

Cancers accumulate somatic mutations as they evolve (Nowell, 1976Nowell P.C.

Some of these mutations are drivers that confer fitness advantages to their host cells and can lead to clonal expansions (Garraway and Lander, 2013Garraway L.A. Lander E.S.

Late clonal expansions, spatial segregation, and incomplete selective sweeps result in genetically distinct cellular populations that manifest as intra-tumor heterogeneity (ITH) (Nowell, 1976Nowell P.C. The clonal evolution of tumor cell populations.Science. 1976; 194: 23-28Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Clonal mutations are shared by all cancer cells, whereas subclonal mutations are present only in a subset. ITH is an important clinical challenge because it provides genetic variation that may drive cancer progression and lead to emergence of drug resistance (Maley et al., 2006Maley C.C. Galipeau P.C.

For example, ITH at the level of copy number alterations (CNAs) is associated with increased risk of relapse in non-small cell lung cancer (Jamal-Hanjani et al., 2017Jamal-Hanjani M. Wilson G.A.

ITH can be characterized from massively parallel sequencing data (Campbell et al., 2008Campbell P.J. Pleasance E.D. Stephens P.J. Dicks E. Rance R. Goodhead I. Follows G.A. Green A.R. Futreal P.A.

Each of those mutations is present in the same cancer cell fraction (CCF), which may be estimated by adjusting mutation allele frequencies for local copy number and sample purity. Subsequent clustering of mutations based on their CCF yields the “subclonal architecture” of a sample (Dentro et al., 2017Dentro S.C. Wedge D.C. Van Loo P. Principles of Reconstructing the Subclonal Architecture of Cancers.Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Med. 2017; 7: a026625Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar): estimates of the number of distinct tumor cell populations (subclones), their CCF, and assigned mutations. ITH remains poorly characterized across cancer types, and there is substantial uncertainty concerning the selective pressures operating on subclonal populations. Previous pan-cancer efforts have relied on exomes, restricting somatic mutation calling and subclonal resolution (Andor et al., 2016Andor N. Graham T.A. Jansen M. Xia L.C. Aktipis C.A. Petritsch C. Ji H.P. Maley C.C. Pan-cancer analysis of the extent and consequences of intratumor heterogeneity.Nat. Med. 2016; 22: 105-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). Recent studies have relied on multi-region whole-genome, exome, or targeted sequencing to explore ITH in specific cancer types (Jamal-Hanjani et al., 2017Jamal-Hanjani M. Wilson G.A. McGranahan N. Birkbak N.J. Watkins T.B.K. Veeriah S. Shafi S. Johnson D.H. Mitter R. Rosenthal R. et al.TRACERx ConsortiumTracking the Evolution of Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer.N. Engl. J.

Med. 2015; 21: 751-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). Single-sample analyses can underestimate ITH because variants found to be clonal in one region may be subclonal in another (the “illusion of clonality”) (de Bruin et al., 2014de Bruin E.C. McGranahan N. Mitter R. Salm M. Wedge D.C. Yates L. Jamal-Hanjani M. Shafi S. Murugaesu N. Rowan A.J. et al.Spatial and temporal diversity in genomic instability processes defines lung cancer evolution.Science. 2014; 346: 251-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar). Conversely, any mutations detected as subclonal will remain so, no matter how many regions are assayed. Therefore, single-sample analysis establishes a conservative lower limit of ITH. Here we develop a robust consensus strategy to call copy number and cluster mutations to assess ITH and its origin, drivers, and role in tumor development. We apply these approaches to 2,658 tumors from 38 histologically distinct cancer types from the Pan-Cancer Analysis of Whole Genomes (PCAWG) initiative (ICGC/TCGA Pan-Cancer Analysis of Whole Genomes Consortium, 2020ICGC/TCGA Pan-Cancer Analysis of Whole Genomes ConsortiumPan-cancer analysis of whole genomes.Nature. 2020; 578: 82-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). Whole-genome sequencing provides orders of magnitude more point mutations than exomes, greater resolution to detect CNAs, and the ability to call structural variants (SVs). These increase the breadth and depth of our analyses and reveal pervasive ITH across cancer types. We observe branching patterns of evolution and positive selection in subclones. We identify subclonal driver mutations in cancer genes and recurrent changes in mutation signature activity. Our analyses provide detailed insight into tumor evolutionary dynamics. We leveraged the PCAWG dataset to characterize ITH across cancer types, including single-nucleotide variants (SNVs), insertions or deletions (indels), SVs, and CNAs as well as subclonal drivers, subclonal selection, and mutation signatures (Alexandrov et al., 2020Alexandrov L.B.

First, to generate high-confidence calls, we developed ensemble approaches for variant calling, copy number calling, and subclonal reconstruction (Figure 1A; STAR Methods). Specifically, to maximize the sensitivity and specificity of calling clonal and subclonal mutations, a consensus approach was adopted, integrating the output of five SNV calling algorithms (ICGC/TCGA Pan-Cancer Analysis of Whole Genomes Consortium, 2020ICGC/TCGA Pan-Cancer Analysis of Whole Genomes ConsortiumPan-cancer analysis of whole genomes.Nature. 2020; 578: 82-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). Similar approaches were employed for indels and SVs. Because the quality of copy number calls has a large effect on subclonal reconstruction (Salcedo et al., 2020Salcedo A. Tarabichi M. Espiritu S.M.G. Deshwar A.G. David M. Wilson N.M. Dentro S. Wintersinger J.A. Liu L.Y. Ko M. et al.DREAM SMC-Het ParticipantsA community effort to create standards for evaluating tumor subclonal reconstruction.Nat. Biotechnol. 2020; 38: 97-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), we systematically integrated results from six copy number callers (Figure 1A; STAR Methods). A first run of each algorithm was used to identify all copy number breakpoints and construct a consensus segmentation. To improve sensitivity and obtain base-pair-resolution segments, SV breakpoints were also inserted (STAR Methods). In a second run of all CNA callers, this consensus segmentation was enforced, resulting in copy number calls with near-identical breakpoints across algorithms. Purity and ploidy assessment can be challenging because multiple combinations are theoretically possible for some cancer samples and may be difficult to distinguish (Carter et al., 2012Carter S.L. Cibulskis K. Helman E. McKenna A. Shen H. Zack T. Laird P.W. Onofrio R.C. Winckler W. Weir B.A. et al.Absolute quantification of somatic DNA alterations in human cancer.Nat. Biotechnol. 2012; 30: 413-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (978) Google Scholar; Van Loo et al., 2010Van Loo P. Nordgard S.H. Lingjærde O.C. Russnes H.G. Rye I.H. Sun W. Weigman V.J. Marynen P. Zetterberg A. Naume B. et al.Allele-specific copy number analysis of tumors.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2010; 107: 16910-16915Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar). Consensus was obtained by establishing agreement between the six CNA callers (STAR Methods). An expert panel reviewed and resolved cases where the callers disagreed. Our purity values correlate strongly with a recent cross-omics analysis of tumor purity (Aran et al., 2015Aran D. Sirota M. Butte A.J. Systematic pan-cancer analysis of tumour purity.Nat. Commun. 2015; 6: 8971Crossref PubMed Google Scholar; Figure S1). We next defined samples that had undergone whole-genome duplication (WGD) in an objective and automated way, based on tumor ploidy and the extent of loss of heterozygosity (Figure 1B; STAR Methods). Samples with WGD evidenced synchronous chromosomal gains (Gerstung et al., 2020Gerstung M. Jolly C. Leshchiner I. Dentro S.C. Gonzalez S. Rosebrock D. Mitchell T.J. Rubanova Y. Anur P. Yu K. et al.PCAWG Evolution & Heterogeneity Working GroupPCAWG ConsortiumThe evolutionary history of 2,658 cancers.Nature. 2020; 578: 122-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), further validating our approach. Last, CNAs were assigned “tiers” for the confidence in the consensus copy number, based on caller agreement. We reached high consensus confidence on a median 95% of the genome (Figure 1C; STAR Methods). Consensus copy number, SNVs, and purity estimates served as input to 11 subclonal reconstructing methods, and the results of these methods were combined into a single consensus for each tumor (Figure 1A; STAR Methods). Addressing the probabilistic nature of subclonal reconstruction, we developed three consensus approaches using different summary outputs of individual methods. We validated consensus results on two independent simulated datasets and assessed their robustness on the real data. The consensus methods performed comparably with the best individual methods on both simulated datasets, with the top-performing individual methods also displaying high similarity scores (Figure 1D; STAR Methods). On the real data, the highest similarities were also observed between the individual and consensus approaches but not among individual methods (Figure 1D), confirming that a consensus yields the most robust subclonal reconstruction. Furthermore, the most robust performance, when the best methods are not known a priori, was achieved when all methods were included (STAR Methods). Hence, we used the output of one of our consensus approaches, combining all individual methods, as the basis for our global assignment strategy (STAR Methods). We thus obtained, for each tumor, the number of detectable subclones; the fraction of subclonal SNVs, indels, SVs, and CNAs; as well as assignments of SNVs, indels, and SVs to subclones. To obtain unbiased estimates of the number of mutations in subclones and their CCF, we accounted for a detection bias introduced by somatic variant calling. Specifically, as the CCF of a subclone decreases, so does the power to detect its unique SNVs. This leads to overestimation of the subclone’s CCF (Nik-Zainal et al., 2012Nik-Zainal S. Van Loo P. Wedge D.C. Alexandrov L.B. Greenman C.D. Lau K.W. Raine K. Jones D. Marshall J. Ramakrishna M. et al.Breast Cancer Working Group of the International Cancer Genome ConsortiumThe life history of 21 breast cancers.Cell. 2012; 149: 994-1007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (870) Google Scholar) and underestimation of its mutation burden. The large number of SNVs revealed by whole-genome sequencing (WGS) facilitates quantitation and correction of these biases. We developed two methods to this end, validated them on simulated data (STAR Methods; Figure 2A), and combined them to correct the estimated number of SNVs and CCF of each subclone. On average, 14% of SNVs in observable subclones fall below the detection limit (Figures 2B and 2C). In subclones with a CCF of less than 30%, an average 21% of SNVs are missed. These values reflect SNVs missed in detected subclones, not in subclones that remain undetected because of limited sequencing depth. Because of the complexity in modeling sensitivity of indel and SV calling as a function of the number of variant reads, methods were not extended to these mutation types. We anticipate that higher fractions of SVs and indels are missed because of the lower sensitivity of existing algorithms (ICGC/TCGA Pan-Cancer Analysis of Whole Genomes Consortium, 2020ICGC/TCGA Pan-Cancer Analysis of Whole Genomes ConsortiumPan-cancer analysis of whole genomes.Nature. 2020; 578: 82-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). Evaluating evidence for subclonal expansions across cancers in our consensus, we noted that the power to identify subclones depends on sample purity, tumor ploidy, and sequencing depth. We summarized these into one metric, the number of reads per tumor chromosomal copy (nrpcc; representing the sequencing coverage per haploid genome; Figure S2; STAR Methods), and focused on 1,705 genomes where our approach is powered to detect subclones encompassing more than 30% of tumor cells (STAR Methods). One or more subclonal expansions were evident in 1,621 tumors (95.1%) at the resolution of our methods (Figure 3A). Importantly, these estimates, based on single-sample reconstruction and a median ∼46× read coverage, provide a conservative lower bound because we are not powered to detect rare populations. In addition, because typically only part of the tumor is sequenced, some subclones may not be sampled, and some mutations may be subject to the illusion of clonality. Analysis of five distinct multi-region sequenced primary prostate tumors in PCAWG suggests that, on average, in our single-sample analysis, 44% of variants are missed, and 26% of subclonal mutations appear to be clonal (Figure S3), in concordance with published literature (Werner et al., 2017Werner B.

Comparison of clonality assignments and missed variants based on multi-region versus single-sample analyses for the five multi-region sequenced primary tumors in PCAWG. Subclonal mutations appearing to be clonal in the indicated sample display the illusion of clonality. Mutations detected in some, but not in other samples of the same tumor, are classified as uncalled in the latter samples. Our approach finds more than 75% of samples showing evidence of at least one subclonal expansion in all cancer types (Figure 3A), except cutaneous melanoma, where subclones were detectable by our approach in only 31 of 62 samples. Twenty-five of 30 cancer types with 10 cases or more comprised more than 90% of samples with at least one detectable subclone. The fraction of subclonal SNVs identified (after correction for missed SNVs) varies widely across cancer types (Figure 3B). Squamous cell carcinomas typically show low fractions of subclonal SNVs (head and neck, 9.7% ± 11.9%; lung, 6.1% ± 6.7%; cervix, 20.6% ± 19.6%; mean ± standard deviation), whereas chromophobe renal cell carcinomas (45.2% ± 22.7%), pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (46% ± 24.7%), and pilocytic astrocytomas (61.3% ± 14.8%) showed the highest. Indels, SVs, and CNAs also revealed similarly large differences between cancer types. For indels, the subclonal fraction ranged from 6.2% ± 11.7% in lung squamous carcinomas to 43.4% ± 23.7% in pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (Figure 3C). For SVs, liposarcomas and cutaneous melanomas showed the lowest subclonal fraction (8.0% ± 14.1% and 8.9% ± 15.5%, respectively) and chromophobe renal cell carcinomas the highest (56.8% ± 31.6%) (Figure 3D). The fraction of subclonal copy number changes was lowest in chromophobe renal cell cancers (13.3% ± 16.8%) and highest in prostate adenocarcinoma (53.8% ± 32.0%) (Figure 3E). Comparing these values with the SNV burden, the fraction of the genome affected by CNAs, the frequency of WGD per cancer type, and our nrpcc power measure showed that none of these metrics explain this wide variation (Figures 3F–3I). Although we observed that cancer types with a higher mutation burden showed lower fractions of subclonal SNVs (Figures 3B and 3F), we did not see a similar relationship when evaluating individual tumors (STAR Methods). The proportions of subclonal indels and SNVs are strongly correlated (Pearson's R2 = 0.73), and SVs follow a similar trend (R2 = 0.62 with indels, R2 = 0.51 with SNVs) (Figures 3B–3E and S4). In contrast, the average proportions of subclonal large-scale CNAs and SNVs are only weakly correlated (R2 = 0.24), indicating that these could be driven by independent mutational processes or subject to differential selective pressures over time (Gerstung et al., 2020Gerstung M.

https://openalex.org/W3141062778,"Classic embryological experiments have established that the early mouse embryo develops via sequential lineage bifurcations. The first segregated lineage is the trophectoderm, essential for blastocyst formation. Mouse naive epiblast and derivative embryonic stem cells are restricted accordingly from producing trophectoderm. Here we show, in contrast, that human naive embryonic stem cells readily make blastocyst trophectoderm and descendant trophoblast cell types. Trophectoderm was induced rapidly and efficiently by inhibition of ERK/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and Nodal signaling. Transcriptome comparison with the human embryo substantiated direct formation of trophectoderm with subsequent differentiation into syncytiotrophoblast, cytotrophoblast, and downstream trophoblast stem cells. During pluripotency progression lineage potential switches from trophectoderm to amnion. Live-cell tracking revealed that epiblast cells in the human blastocyst are also able to produce trophectoderm. Thus, the paradigm of developmental specification coupled to lineage restriction does not apply to humans. Instead, epiblast plasticity and the potential for blastocyst regeneration are retained until implantation."
https://openalex.org/W3135940977,"Many individuals mount nearly identical antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2. To gain insight into how the viral spike (S) protein receptor-binding domain (RBD) might evolve in response to common antibody responses, we studied mutations occurring during virus evolution in a persistently infected immunocompromised individual. We use antibody Fab/RBD structures to predict, and pseudotypes to confirm, that mutations found in late-stage evolved S variants confer resistance to a common class of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies we isolated from a healthy COVID-19 convalescent donor. Resistance extends to the polyclonal serum immunoglobulins of four out of four healthy convalescent donors we tested and to monoclonal antibodies in clinical use. We further show that affinity maturation is unimportant for wild-type virus neutralization but is critical to neutralization breadth. Because the mutations we studied foreshadowed emerging variants that are now circulating across the globe, our results have implications to the long-term efficacy of S-directed countermeasures."

Our system provides a platform to study the molecular mechanisms underlying trophoblast development and related diseases. Trophoblasts compose the placenta and are essential extraembryonic cells from blastocyst through birth. Abnormal differentiation of trophoblasts during early pregnancy is thought to cause placenta-related complications (Burton and Jauniaux, 2017Burton G.J. Jauniaux E.

However, it is difficult to analyze trophoblasts in the human uterus, especially during the first few weeks after implantation, because of technical difficulties and ethics restrictions. Trophoblast development and physiology have been described based on mice, and early lethality (embryonic days 9.5 (E9.5)−14.5) in knockout lines is frequently associated with severe placental malformation (Perez-Garcia et al., 2018Perez-Garcia V. Fineberg E. Wilson R. Murray A. Mazzeo C.I. Tudor C. Sienerth A. White J.K. Tuck E. Ryder E.J. et al.Placentation defects are highly prevalent in embryonic lethal mouse mutants.Nature. 2018; 555: 463-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). However, human and mouse placentation differ in many ways. Fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR2) is expressed in mouse trophectoderm (TE) of blastocysts, whereas FGFR1, FGFR2, and FGFR3 are not expressed in human TE (Kunath et al., 2014Kunath T. Yamanaka Y. Detmar J. MacPhee D. Caniggia I. Rossant J. Jurisicova A.

Trophoblast stem (TS) cells cultured in FGF4 have been established in mice (Tanaka et al., 1998Tanaka S. Kunath T. Hadjantonakis A.K. Nagy A. Rossant J.

In 2018, several groups reported successful culturing of trophoblasts from 5- to 9-week human placentas or blastocysts for long periods in vitro as two-dimensional TS cells or three-dimensional trophoblast organoids (Haider et al., 2018Haider S.

However, whether these cell lines resemble early-stage trophoblasts during peri-implantation development has not been confirmed. Another approach to study early trophoblast development is to employ pluripotent stem cells (PSCs). Primed human PSCs have been induced to trophoblast lineages by bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP4) (Xu et al., 2002Xu R.H. Chen X. Li D.S. Li R. Addicks G.C. Glennon C. Zwaka T.P. Thomson J.A. BMP4 initiates human embryonic stem cell differentiation to trophoblast.Nat. Biotechnol. 2002; 20: 1261-1264Crossref PubMed Scopus (860) Google Scholar). Subsequently, trophoblast-like cells have been generated with cocktails of BMP4, the ALK4/5/7 inhibitor A83-01, and the FGFR inhibitor PD173074 (BAP medium) (Amita et al., 2013Amita M. Adachi K.

However, primed PSC-derived cells differed in human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I and epigenetic properties from in vivo trophoblasts (Bernardo et al., 2011Bernardo A.S. Faial T. Gardner L. Niakan K.K. Ortmann D. Senner C.E. Callery E.M. Trotter M.W. Hemberger M.

Human trophoblast-like cells have also been reportedly generated from expanded potential stem cells (EPSCs) (Gao et al., 2019Gao X. Nowak-Imialek M. Chen X. Chen D. Herrmann D. Ruan D. Chen A.C.H.

Recently, naive human PSCs were established. These cells have gene expression patterns consistent with human pre-implantation epiblast (EPI) and naive mouse PSCs, representing an earlier stage than conventional primed PSCs (Guo et al., 2016Guo G. von Meyenn F.

Although human trophoblasts arise from the morula as TE, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data suggest that the fate determination of human cells might be late (Meistermann et al., 2019Meistermann D.

However, because TE, which is the starting point for trophoblast development from pre-implantation, was not identified, the process of trophoblast development from the pre-implantation stage and the in vivo identity of human TS cells remain unclear. In the present study, we induced TE from naive human PSCs to establish an in vitro model of the trophoblast lineage. Naive PSC-derived TE differentiated successfully into cytotrophoblasts (CTs), which had a similar character as trophoblasts of cynomolgus monkey (Macaca fascicularis) embryos in vivo, trophoblasts of cultured human embryos, and placenta-derived TS cells. Furthermore, our analysis unveiled the counterpart of in vitro human TS cells as some parts of villous CTs (VCTs) and CTs in cell columns (CCCs) of in vivo first-trimester placenta. Finally, using this model, we investigated trophoblast development from TE to CTs during peri-implantation stages. Human trophoblasts arise from the morula as TE. After implantation, TE differentiates into CTs, syncytiotrophoblasts (STs), and extravillous trophoblasts (EVTs) (Figure 1A). We investigated whether naive human PSCs could differentiate into TE (Figures S1A and S1B). Using previously reported scRNA-seq data (Petropoulos et al., 2016Petropoulos S. Edsgärd D. Reinius B. Deng Q. Panula S.P. Codeluppi S. Plaza Reyes A. Linnarsson S. Sandberg R. Lanner F.

TACSTD2 is expressed in TE of early (E5) and late blastocysts (E7), whereas ENPEP expression is increased in TE of late blastocysts. Next we analyzed signaling receptors and inferred the necessary signaling pathways to develop an appropriate TE induction medium. We examined Nodal, FGF, Janus kinases (JAK)/ signal transducer and activator of transcription proteins (STAT), and BMP signaling receptors because these are known to be related to early development in mice and humans. Expression was evaluated by fragments per kilobase of transcript per million mapped reads (FPKM) and F values (Figure S1C). The genes with the highest F value in each signaling pathway were ACVR1B, FGFR1, IL6R, and TGFBR3. TGFBR3 was highly expressed in TE of human embryos (Stirparo et al., 2018Stirparo G.G. Boroviak T.

FGFR2, the receptor for FGF4, which is important for mouse TS cell induction (Kunath et al., 2014Kunath T. Yamanaka Y. Detmar J. MacPhee D. Caniggia I. Rossant J. Jurisicova A.

These receptors exhibited similar patterns in cynomolgus monkey TE but not in mouse TE (Figures S1E and S1F; Nakamura et al., 2015Nakamura T. Yabuta Y. Okamoto I. Aramaki S. Yokobayashi S.

Combinations of these factors partially upregulated trophoblast genes (Figure S1G). To optimize the four factors, we performed screening (Figure S1H–S1J; Table S2). The condition shown in Figure 1C induced TACSTD2+ENPEP+ cells most efficiently (Figure S1J). Under this condition, TACSTD2+ENPEP− cells were observed on days 1 and 2, and around 60% of TACSTD2+ENPEP+ cells were induced on day 3 (Figure 1D). Cell morphology on day 3 was polygonal and flat, whereas tightly packed three-dimensional colonies of naive PSCs were not seen (Figures 1E and S1A). TE marker proteins were expressed on day 3 (Figure 1F; Blakeley et al., 2015Blakeley P. Fogarty N.M. del Valle I. Wamaitha S.E. Hu T.X. Elder K. Snell P. Christie L. Robson P. Niakan K.K.

We sorted TACSTD2+ENPEP+ cells on day 3 by flow cytometry and confirmed that TACSTD2+ENPEP+ cells expressed trophoblast markers, whereas expression of pluripotent genes was decreased (Figure 1G).

Expression of almost all TE-specific genes was increased on days 2 and 3 (Figure 1H), suggesting that naive PSCs could differentiate into TE-like cells (nTEs). We confirmed downregulation of phosphorylated (p)SMAD2 under A83-01, of pERK1/2 under PD03, and of pSTAT3 under JAKi and transient upregulation of SMAD1/5 under BMP4 (Figure S1K). Furthermore, upregulation or downregulation of downstream genes in each signaling pathway suggested that these factors worked functionally under our condition (Figure S1L). TACSTD2+ENPEP+ cells were induced in three naive human embryonic stem cell (ESC)/induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines (H9 ESCs, 409B2 iPSCs, and adipose-derived iPS cells (AdiPS cells)) established by two different naive induction procedures (chemical reset and 5i/L/A) (Figure S1M; Guo et al., 2017Guo G. von Meyenn F.

PD03 could be replaced with an FGFR inhibitor, PD173074 (Figure S1N). We analyzed whether nTEs differentiate into post-implantation CTs (Figure 2A).

Expression of mouse Tacstd2, Enpep, and Siglec5 (the mouse ortholog for human SIGLEC6) was conserved in mouse pre-implantation TE (Figure S2E). We thus chose to use these three genes as markers for CTs. As expected, nTEs on day 3 were SIGLEC6− (Figure 2D). To determine the induction condition from TE to CTs, we observed protein expression and signaling transduction in human chorionic villi (7 gestational weeks) (Figure S2F).

The pEGF receptor was strongly expressed in the cell membranes of CCCs, VCTs, and STs, whereas pSMAD2 was not accumulated in the nuclei of CCCs, VCTs, or STs (Figure S2G). We therefore cultured nTEs on day 3 in A83-01, CHIR99021, and epidermal growth factor (EGF) (ACE) (Figure 2A). In ACE, nTEs differentiated into TACSTD2+, ENPEP+, and SIGLEC6+ CT-like cells (naive CTs [nCTs]) on day 10 (Figure 2D). TACSTD2+ENPEP+SIGLEC6+ cells were sorted on day 10 and continued to be cultured in ACE. nCTs continuously expressed TACSTD2, ENPEP, and SIGLEC6 (Figure 2D), and the morphology of nCTs was maintained for more than 10 passages and resembled that of placenta-derived TS cells (Figure 2E). Their chromosomes were normal (Figure S2H). nCTs expressed trophoblast markers over 10 passages (Figures 2F and 2G) and could be maintained for more than 35 passages and over 75 days like CT stem cells (Figure S2I; Video S1). In previous reports, Ki67 was expressed in CTs (Chang and Parast, 2017Chang C.W. Parast M.M.

Interestingly, CCCs and some VCTs of human chorionic villi expressed Ki67 at 5 gestational weeks, but the number of Ki67+ cells decreased by 9 gestational weeks and had almost disappeared at 11 gestational weeks, indicating that our nCTs correspond to the early stage of CCCs and VCTs (Figures 2I and S2J). We also tested each counteracting signaling molecule of ACE compounds. Activin A, XAV939, and gefitinib (an EGF receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor) each reduced cell growth and viability (Figure S2K), indicating that all three ACE compounds are necessary to maintain nCTs. https://www.cell.com/cms/asset/0c819e27-eee6-4bc2-86ca-46c348185362/mmc7.mp4Loading ...

Furthermore, TACSTD2+ENPEP+SIGLEC6+ cells of placental chorionic villi at 7 and 9 gestational weeks were sorted and cultured in ACE (Figure S3A). Chorionic villus-derived (7 and 9 gestational weeks) CT cells (cCTs) cultured in ACE for more than 10 passages had a similar morphology as nCTs and TS cells (Figures S3A and S3B). cCTs expressed CT markers similarly as nCTs after 10 passages (Figures S3C and S3D) and were karyotypically stable (Figure S3E). cCTs differentiated into ST-like cells in forskolin (Figures S3F–S3H) and into EVT-like cells in A83-01 and Neuregulin-1 with Geltrex (Figures S3I and S3J). Next we analyzed the global transcriptome of nTEs; nCTs; TACSTD2+ENPEP+SIGLEC6+ placental chorionic villi at 7, 9, and 11 gestational weeks; and CT30 cells, which we cultured under a condition reported previously (human TS condition, SAVECY) (Okae et al., 2018Okae H.

Unbiased hierarchical clustering (UHC) suggested that nCTs, CT30 cells, and placental chorionic villi have more similar gene expression profiles than nTEs and naive PSCs, which correspond to the pre-implantation developmental stage (Figure 2J). Principal-component analysis (PCA) revealed that various nCT lines have gene expression patterns similar to CT30 cells and chorionic villi (Figure 2K). nTEs were distant from nCTs and placental chorionic villi. During differentiation, TE marker genes were downregulated even in TE induction medium (Figure S3K). Monitoring CDX2 expression using CDX2-GFP H9 ESCs (Figure S3L), CDX2-GFP+ cells lost GFP expression after 7 or 10 days in TE induction medium, CT induction medium, or other conditions except for A83-01, CHIR99021, and lysophosphatidic acid (ACL), which was applied for mouse polar-like TS cells (Frias-Aldeguer et al., 2020Frias-Aldeguer J.

ApoE4 has strong deleterious effects on both parameters. In the brain, apoE is produced and secreted primarily by astrocytes and by activated microglia. The cell-specific role of each form of apoE in the setting of neurodegeneration has not been determined. We generated P301S Tau/Aldh1l1-CreERT2/apoE3flox/flox or Tau/Aldh1l1-CreERT2/apoE4flox/flox mice. At 5.5 months of age, after the onset of tau pathology, we administered tamoxifen or vehicle and compared mice at 9.5 months of age. Removing astrocytic APOE4 markedly reduced tau-mediated neurodegeneration and decreased phosphorylated tau (pTau) pathology. Single-nucleus RNA sequencing analysis revealed striking gene expression changes in all cell types, with astrocytic APOE4 removal decreasing disease-associated gene signatures in neurons, oligodendrocytes, astrocytes, and microglia. Removal of astrocytic APOE4 decreased tau-induced synaptic loss and microglial phagocytosis of synaptic elements, suggesting a key role for astrocytic apoE in synaptic degeneration."

Our results reveal transitions connecting the intermediate mesoderm and progenitors of organ primordia, the hematopoietic system and endothelial subtypes. Unexpectedly, by using a combination of single-cell transcriptomics and lineage tracing, we found that intra-adrenal sympathoblasts at that stage are directly derived from nerve-associated Schwann cell precursors, similarly to local chromaffin cells, whereas the majority of extra-adrenal sympathoblasts arise from the migratory neural crest. In humans, this process persists during several weeks of development within the large intra-adrenal ganglia-like structures, which may also serve as reservoirs of originating cells in neuroblastoma."
https://openalex.org/W3139891715,"Light makes light work of fatty acids Photosynthetic organisms are notable for their ability to capture light energy and use it to power biosynthesis. Some algae have gone a step beyond photosynthesis and can use light to initiate enzymatic photodecarboxylation of fatty acids, producing long-chain hydrocarbons. To understand this transformation, Sorigué et al. brought to bear an array of structural, computational, and spectroscopic techniques and fully characterized the catalytic cycle of the enzyme. These experiments are consistent with a mechanism starting with electron transfer from the fatty acid to a photoexcited oxidized flavin cofactor. Decarboxylation yields an alkyl radical, which is then reduced by back electron transfer and protonation rather than hydrogen atom transfer. The wealth of experimental data explains how algae harness light energy to produce alka(e)nes and provides an appealing model system for understanding enzyme-catalyzed photochemistry more generally.

By comparing endocasts, representations of the inner surface of fossil brain cases, from early Homo from Africa, Georgia, and Southeast Asia, they show that these structural innovations emerged later than the first dispersal of the genus from Africa, and were probably in place by 1.7 to 1.5 million years ago. The modern humanlike brain organization emerged in cerebral regions thought to be related to toolmaking, social cognition, and language. Their findings suggest that brain reorganization was not a prerequisite for dispersals from Africa, and that there might have been more than one long-range dispersal of early Homo .

Aberrant activation of long interspersed element-1 (LINE-1 or L1) retrotransposons is common in human cancers, yet their tumor-type-specific functions are poorly characterized. We identified MPHOSPH8/MPP8, a component of the human silencing hub (HUSH) complex, as an acute myeloid leukemia (AML)-selective dependency by epigenetic regulator-focused CRISPR screening. Although MPP8 is dispensable for steady-state hematopoiesis, MPP8 loss inhibits AML development by reactivating L1s to induce the DNA damage response and cell cycle exit. Activation of endogenous or ectopic L1s mimics the phenotype of MPP8 loss, whereas blocking retrotransposition abrogates MPP8-deficiency-induced phenotypes. Expression of AML oncogenic mutations promotes L1 suppression, and enhanced L1 silencing is associated with poor prognosis in human AML. Hence, while retrotransposons are commonly recognized for their cancer-promoting functions, we describe a tumor-suppressive role for L1 retrotransposons in myeloid leukemia."

The majority of maternal deaths occur due to pregnancy and delivery-related complications, which can mostly be prevented by safe facility delivery. Due to the paucity of existing evidence, our study aimed to examine the factors associated with place of delivery, including women’s preferences for such in three selected South-Asian countries. Methods We extracted data from the most recent demographic and health surveys (DHS) conducted in Bangladesh (2014), Nepal (2016), and Pakistan (2017–18) and analyzed to identify the association between the outcome variable and socio-demographic characteristics. A total of 16,429 women from Bangladesh (4278; mean age 24.57 years), Nepal (3962; mean age 26.35 years), and Pakistan (8189; mean age 29.57 years) were included in this study. Following descriptive analyses, bivariate and multivariate logistic regressions were conducted. Results Overall, the prevalence of facility-based delivery was 40%, 62%, and 69% in Bangladesh, Nepal, and Pakistan, respectively. Inequity in utilizing facility-based delivery was observed for women in the highest wealth quintile. Participants from Urban areas, educated, middle and upper household economic status, and with high antenatal care (ANC) visits were significantly associated with facility-based delivery in all three countries. Interestingly, watching TV was also found as a strong determinant for facility-based delivery in Bangladesh (aOR = 1.31, 95% CI:1.09–1.56, P = 0.003), Nepal (aOR = 1.42, 95% CI:1.20–1.67, P&lt;0.001) and Pakistan (aOR = 1.17, 95% CI: 1.03–1.32, P = 0.013). Higher education of husband was a significant predictor for facility delivery in Bangladesh (aOR = 1.73, 95% CI:1.27–2.35, P = 0.001) and Pakistan (aOR = 1.19, 95% CI: 0.99–1.43, P = 0.065); husband’s occupation was also a significant factor in Bangladesh (aOR = 1.30, 95% CI:1.04–1.61, P = 0.020) and Nepal (aOR = 1.26, 95% CI:1.01–1.58, P = 0.041). Conclusion Our findings suggest that the educational status of both women and their husbands, household economic situation, and the number of ANC visits influenced the place of delivery. There is an urgent need to promote facility delivery by building more birthing facilities, training and deployment of skilled birth attendants in rural and hard-to-reach areas, ensuring compulsory female education for all women, encouraging more ANC visits, and providing financial incentives for facility deliveries. There is a need to promote facility delivery by encouraging health facility visits through utilizing social networks and continuing mass media campaigns. Ensuring adequate Government funding for free maternal and newborn health care and local community involvement is crucial for reducing maternal and neonatal mortality and achieving sustainable development goals in this region."
https://openalex.org/W3151480055,"Tauopathies, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), are neurodegenerative disorders characterized by the deposition of hyperphosphorylated tau aggregates. Proteopathic tau seeds spread through the brain in a temporospatial pattern, indicative of transsynaptic propagation. It is hypothesized that reducing the uptake of tau seeds and subsequent induction of tau aggregation could be a potential approach for abrogating disease progression in AD. Here, we studied to what extent different endosomal routes play a role in the neuronal uptake of preformed tau seeds. Using pharmacological and genetic tools, we identified dynamin-1, actin, and Rac1 as key players. Furthermore, inhibition of PIKfyve, a protein downstream of Rac1, reduced both the trafficking of tau seeds into lysosomes and the induction of tau aggregation. Our work shows that tau aggregates are internalized by a specific endocytic mechanism and that their fate once internalized can be pharmacologically modulated to reduce tau seeding in neurons."

Diagnostic sensitivity and specificity were assessed in comparison to molecular test results and subdivided according to targeted genes ( E , RdRP , and N ) and days post-symptom onset (PSO). For the kinetics evaluation, cut-off-indices from serial NP specimens were used according to the number of days PSO. Both RATs showed sensitivity of 91.3‒100% for specimens with cycle threshold (Ct) &lt; 25. The specificity of AFIAS was 98.7‒98.9% and that of ichroma TM was 100.0%.

Such individuals are more often exposed to stressful/uncontrollable events in everyday life, like bullying and demanding problem-solving situations, than those without ID. Moreover, they may have less control over both minor and major daily life decisions (e.g., what to eat or where to live) (Bannerman et al., 1990Bannerman D.J. Sheldon J.B. Sherman J.A. Harchik A.E.

To date, however, little is known as to how perturbations in such genes contribute to or facilitate the development of stress-related behavioral problems/disorders. To gain insight, we focused on the X-linked ID gene oligophrenin-1 (OPHN1 in humans, Ophn1 in mice). OPHN1, which encodes a Rho GTPase-activating protein (GAP), was the first identified Rho-linked ID gene (Bienvenu et al., 1997Bienvenu T. Der-Sarkissian H. Billuart P. Tissot M. Des Portes V. Brüls T. Chabrolle J.P. Chauveau P. Cherry M. Kahn A. et al.Mapping of the X-breakpoint involved in a balanced X;12 translocation in a female with mild mental retardation.Eur. J. Hum.

Cherry M. et al.Oligophrenin-1 encodes a rhoGAP protein involved in X-linked mental retardation.Nature. 1998; 392: 923-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). Mutations in OPHN1, located at Xp12, cause a syndromic form of X-linked ID, with affected individuals exhibiting mild to moderate/severe ID, vermis and/or hemispheric cerebellar hypoplasia, and behavioral problems (Bergmann et al., 2003Bergmann C.

https://openalex.org/W3144595160,"Bone loss is a major health concern for astronauts during long-term spaceflight and for patients during prolonged bed rest or paralysis. Growing evidence suggests that osteocytes, the most abundant cells in the mineralized bone matrix, play a key role in sensing mechanical forces applied to the skeleton and integrating the orchestrated response into subcellular biochemical signals to modulate bone homeostasis. However, the precise molecular mechanisms underlying both mechanosensation and mechanotransduction in late-osteoblast-to-osteocyte cells under microgravity (µG) have yet to be elucidated. To unravel the mechanisms by which late osteoblasts and osteocytes sense and respond to mechanical unloading, we exposed the osteocytic cell line, Ocy454, to 2, 4, or 6 days of µG on the SpaceX Dragon-6 resupply mission to the International Space Station. Our results showed that µG impairs the differentiation of osteocytes, consistent with prior osteoblast spaceflight experiments, which resulted in the downregulation of key osteocytic genes. Importantly, we demonstrate the modulation of critical glycolysis pathways in osteocytes subjected to microgravity and discovered a set of mechanical sensitive genes that are consistently regulated in multiple cell types exposed to microgravity suggesting a common, yet to be fully elucidated, genome-wide response to microgravity. Ground-based simulated microgravity experiments utilizing the NASA rotating-wall-vessel were unable to adequately replicate the changes in microgravity exposure highlighting the importance of spaceflight missions to understand the unique environmental stress that microgravity presents to diverse cell types. In summary, our findings demonstrate that osteocytes respond to µG with an increase in glucose metabolism and oxygen consumption."
https://openalex.org/W3147523279,"The malignant phenotype of tumour cells is fuelled by changes in the expression of various transcription factors, including some of the well-studied proteins such as p53 and Myc. Despite significant progress made, little is known about several other transcription factors, including ELF4, and how they help shape the oncogenic processes in cancer cells. To this end, we performed a bioinformatics analysis to facilitate a detailed understanding of how the expression variations of ELF4 in human cancers are related to disease outcomes and the cancer cell drug responses. Here, using ELF4 mRNA expression data of 9,350 samples from the Cancer Genome Atlas pan-cancer project, we identify two groups of patient’s tumours: those that expressed high ELF4 transcripts and those that expressed low ELF4 transcripts across 32 different human cancers. We uncover that patients segregated into these two groups are associated with different clinical outcomes. Further, we find that tumours that express high ELF4 mRNA levels tend to be of a higher-grade, afflict a significantly older patient population and have a significantly higher mutation burden. By analysing dose-response profiles to 397 anti-cancer drugs of 612 well-characterised human cancer cell lines, we discover that cell lines that expressed high ELF4 mRNA transcript are significantly less responsive to 129 anti-cancer drugs, and only significantly more response to three drugs: dasatinib, WH-4-023, and Ponatinib, all of which remarkably target the proto-oncogene tyrosine-protein kinase SRC and tyrosine-protein kinase ABL1. Collectively our analyses have shown that, across the 32 different human cancers, the patients afflicted with tumours that overexpress ELF4 tended to have a more aggressive disease that is also is more likely more refractory to most anti-cancer drugs, a finding upon which we could devise novel categorisation of patient tumours, treatment, and prognostic strategies."
https://openalex.org/W3151179921,"The rapid development of advanced microscopy techniques over recent decades has significantly increased the quality of imaging and our understanding of subcellular structures, such as the organization of the filaments of the cytoskeleton using fluorescence and electron microscopy. However, these recent improvements in imaging techniques have not been matched by similar development of techniques for computational analysis of the images of filament networks that can now be obtained. Hence, for a wide range of applications, reliable computational analysis of such two-dimensional methods remains challenging. Here, we present a new algorithm for tracing of filament networks. This software can extract many important parameters from grayscale images of filament networks, including the mesh hole size, and filament length and connectivity (also known as Coordination Number). In addition, the method allows sub-networks to be distinguished in two-dimensional images using intensity thresholding. We show that the algorithm can be used to analyze images of cytoskeleton networks obtained using different advanced microscopy methods. We have thus developed a new improved method for computational analysis of two-dimensional images of filamentous networks that has wide applications for existing imaging techniques. The algorithm is available as open-source software."
https://openalex.org/W3141562409,"In most vertebrates, camera-style eyes contain retinal ganglion cell neurons that project to visual centers on both sides of the brain. However, in fish, ganglion cells were thought to innervate only the contralateral side, suggesting that bilateral visual projections appeared in tetrapods. Here we show that bilateral visual projections exist in non-teleost fishes and that the appearance of ipsilateral projections does not correlate with terrestrial transition or predatory behavior. We also report that the developmental program that specifies visual system laterality differs between fishes and mammals, as the Zic2 transcription factor, which specifies ipsilateral retinal ganglion cells in tetrapods, appears to be absent from fish ganglion cells. However, overexpression of human ZIC2 induces ipsilateral visual projections in zebrafish. Therefore, the existence of bilateral visual projections likely preceded the emergence of binocular vision in tetrapods."
https://openalex.org/W3118656799,"Diarrhoea remains a major cause of childhood morbidity and mortality worldwide. This study aimed to monitor the aetiology of acute diarrhoea in children in Shanghai. Paediatric outpatients with acute diarrhoea were enrolled in the study from Jan 2015 to Dec 2018. Faecal samples were collected for testing. Enteric bacteria were identified and typed by culture and serotyping, respectively. Enteric viruses were identified by real-time PCR. Enteric pathogens were identified in 1572 (58.4%) of the 2692 enrolled children with acute diarrhoea. Viruses were detected more frequently than bacteria (41.3% versus 25.0%). Nontyphoidal Salmonella spp. (NTS) was the most common (10.3%) bacteria isolated, followed by enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) (6.5%), enteroaggregative Escherichia coli (EAEC) (6.2%), Campylobacter spp. (3.6%), enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) (1.1%), Shigella spp. (0.2%), and enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) (0.1%). Rotavirus was the most common (16.0%) virus detected, followed by norovirus (15.5%), adenovirus (7.2%), sapovirus (3.0%) and astrovirus (2.7%). Rotavirus, norovirus and NTS were the major pathogens responsible for diarrhoea in Shanghainese children. Improving uptake of the rotavirus vaccine and strengthening foodborne-pathogen prevention will aid in reducing the burden of diarrhoeal disease in children in Shanghai."
https://openalex.org/W3141027082,"Psittacula cyanocephala is an endemic parakeet from the Indian sub-continent that is widespread in the illegal bird trade. Previous studies on Psittacula parakeets have highlighted taxonomic ambiguities, warranting studies to resolve the issues. Since the mitochondrial genome provides useful information concerning the species evolution and phylogenetics, we sequenced the complete mitogenome of P . cyanocephala using NGS, validated 38.86% of the mitogenome using Sanger Sequencing and compared it with other available whole mitogenomes of Psittacula . The complete mitogenome of the species was 16814 bp in length with 54.08% AT composition. P . cyanocephala mito genome comprises of 13 protein-coding genes, 2 rRNAs and 22 tRNAs. P . cyanocephala mitogenome organization was consistent with other Psittacula mitogenomes. Comparative codon usage analysis indicated the role of natural selection on Psittacula mitogenomes. Strong purifying selection pressure was observed maximum on nad1 and nad4l genes. The mitochondrial control region of all Psittacula species displayed the ancestral avian CR gene order. Phylogenetic analyses revealed the Psittacula genus as paraphyletic nature, containing at least 4 groups of species within the same genus, suggesting its taxonomic reconsideration. Our results provide useful information for developing forensic tests to control the illegal trade of the species and scientific basis for phylogenetic revision of the genus Psittacula ."
https://openalex.org/W3142555532,"Diabetic nephropathy (DN) remains the major cause of end-stage renal disease (ESRD). We used high-fat/high-sucrose (HFHS)-fed LDLr-/-/ApoB100/100 mice with transgenic overexpression of IGFII in pancreatic β-cells (LRKOB100/IGFII) as a model of ESRD to test whether dietary long chain omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids LCω3FA-rich fish oil (FO) could prevent ESRD development. We further evaluated the potential of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)-derived pro-resolving lipid mediators, 17-hydroxy-DHA (17-HDHA) and Protectin DX (PDX), to reverse established ESRD damage. HFHS-fed vehicle-treated LRKOB100/IGFII mice developed severe kidney dysfunction leading to ESRD, as revealed by advanced glomerular fibrosis and mesangial expansion along with reduced percent survival. The kidney failure outcome was associated with cardiac dysfunction, revealed by reduced heart rate and prolonged diastolic and systolic time. Dietary FO prevented kidney damage, lean mass loss, cardiac dysfunction, and death. 17-HDHA reduced podocyte foot process effacement while PDX treatment alleviated kidney fibrosis and mesangial expansion as compared to vehicle treatment. Only PDX therapy was effective at preserving the heart function and survival rate. These results show that dietary LCω3FA intake can prevent ESRD and cardiac dysfunction in LRKOB100/IGFII diabetic mice. Our data further reveals that PDX can protect against renal failure and cardiac dysfunction, offering a potential new therapeutic strategy against ESRD."
https://openalex.org/W3149131791,"Populations of migratory waterbirds are facing dramatic declines worldwide due to illegal hunting, habitat loss and climate change. Conservation strategies to reverse these trends are imperative, especially in tropical developing countries, which almost invariably allocate insufficient levels of investment for environmental protection. Here, we compared the effectiveness of sustainable-use Protected Areas (PAs) and Community-based Conservation (CBC) arrangements for the conservation of migratory waterbirds that breed on seasonal riverine sandy beaches in Brazilian Amazonia. We modeled local population responses of four migratory waterbird species on 155 beaches along a ~1,600 km section of a major tributary of the Amazon, as a function of community enforcement, official protection status, human pressure and landscape features. We show that 21 community-protected beaches within the study area host more than 80% of all sampled birds. Black Skimmers showed the most dramatic response, with breeding numbers 135-fold larger in CBC arrangements compared to beaches with no official protection status. The same pattern was observed for nesting Large-Billed and Yellow-Billed Terns. For the Near Threatened Orinoco Goose, PA status was the strongest predictor of local population size. These dramatic results demonstrate the value of protected refugia, achieved through the concerted action of participating local communities, to support breeding populations of key waterbird species. This highly-effective and low-cost conservation model can potentially be replicated in other regions of the developing world experiencing increasingly intensive exploitation of riverine natural resources."
https://openalex.org/W3112453215,"Hsp70 proteins are a family of ancient and conserved chaperones. They play important roles in vital cellular processes, such as protein quality control and the stress response. Hsp70 proteins are a potential drug target for treatment of disease, particularly cancer. PES (2-phenylethynesulfonamide or pifithrin-μ) has been reported to be an inhibitor of Hsp70. However, the mechanism of PES inhibition is still unclear. In this study we found that PES can undergo a Michael addition reaction with Cys-574 and Cys-603 in the SBDα of human HspA1A (hHsp70), resulting in covalent attachment of a PES molecule to each Cys residue. We previously showed that glutathionylation of Cys-574 and Cys-603 affects the structure and function of hHsp70. In this study, PES modification showed similar structural and functional effects on hHsp70 to glutathionylation. Further, we found that susceptibility to PES modification is influenced by changes in the conformational dynamics of the SBDα, such as are induced by interaction with adjacent domains, allosteric changes, and mutations.

This study provides new avenues for development of covalent inhibitors of hHsp70. Hsp70 is the central hub for the protein quality control machinery. Hsp70 proteins participate in protein folding and refolding, help prevent protein aggregation, and facilitate protein assembly, disassembly, degradation, and the stress response (1Kim Y.E. Hipp M.S. Bracher A. Hayer-Hartl M. Hartl F.U. Molecular chaperone functions in protein folding and proteostasis.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2013; 82: 323-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (824) Google Scholar). Hsp70 can interact with numerous protein clients and is involved in diverse physiological activities, including signal transduction, apoptosis, and transmembrane transport (2Clerico E.M.

Therefore, Hsp70 proteins are also related to some disease processes, including neurodegeneration, infection, and many types of cancer (3Evans C.G. Chang L. Gestwicki J.E.

Hsp70 in cancer: back to the future.Oncogene. 2015; 34: 4153-4161Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Hsp70 proteins contain two individual domains, namely the ATPase or nucleotide-binding domain (NBD) and the substrate-binding domain (SBD), connected by a flexible linker (7Bertelsen E.B. Chang L. Gestwicki J.E. Zuiderweg E.R. Solution conformation of wild-type E. coli Hsp70 (DnaK) chaperone complexed with ADP and substrate.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2009; 106: 8471-8476Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). The SBD can be further divided into a β-sheet substrate-binding subdomain (SBDβ) and a C-terminal α-helical lid subdomain (SBDα) (8Zhang P. Leu J.I. Murphy M.E. George D.L. Marmorstein R. Crystal structure of the stress-inducible human heat shock protein 70 substrate-binding domain in complex with peptide substrate.PLoS One. 2014; 9e103518Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Allosteric conformational changes in Hsp70 couple the ATP hydrolysis cycle in the NBD and the substrate binding/release cycle in the SBD (9Zuiderweg E.R. Bertelsen E.B. Rousaki A. Mayer M.P. Gestwicki J.E. Ahmad A. Allostery in the Hsp70 chaperone proteins.Top Curr. Chem. 2013; 328: 99-153Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the ATP-bound state, the NBD and SBD of Hsp70 dock into a single entity, and the SBDα detaches from the SBDβ and leans against the NBD, resulting in low substrate affinity (10Qi R. Sarbeng E.B. Liu Q. Le K.Q. Xu X. Xu H. Yang J. Wong J.L. Vorvis C. Hendrickson W.A. Zhou L. Liu Q. Allosteric opening of the polypeptide-binding site when an Hsp70 binds ATP.Nat. Struct. Mol.

Substrate binding to the SBDβ promotes undocking between the NBD and SBD of the E. coli homolog of Hsp70, Dnak (12Zhuravleva A. Clerico E.M. Gierasch L.M.

In the ADP-bound state, the NBD and SBD tend to undock, separating the two individual domains, and the SBDα covers the SBDβ like a lid, resulting in high substrate affinity, although a significant proportion of ADP-bound human cytoplasmic Hsp70 remains docked compared with the largely undocked conformation of ADP-bound DnaK (7Bertelsen E.B.

Cochaperones such as Hsp40 and nucleotide exchange factors (NEFs) can affect nucleotide hydrolysis/exchange and substrate binding/release to regulate the functional cycle of Hsp70 (9Zuiderweg E.R.

Different Hsp70 family members perform specific and overlapping functions. For Homo sapiens at least 13 typical Hsp70 members have been identified in cells. Among them HspA1A is the cytosolic stress-induced form (human HspA1A [hHsp70]) and HspA8 is the cytosolic constitutively expressed form (human HspA8 [hHsc70]) (15Radons J. The human HSP70 family of chaperones: where do we stand?.Cell Stress Chaperones. 2016; 21: 379-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). If both HSPA1A and HSPA8 genes are silenced by siRNA, the survival rate of cells is very low (16Schlecht R. Scholz S.R. Dahmen H. Wegener A. Sirrenberg C. Musil D. Bomke J. Eggenweiler H.M. Mayer M.P. Bukau B. Functional analysis of Hsp70 inhibitors.PLoS One. 2013; 8e78443Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Expression of hHsp70 is very low under normal conditions but rises dramatically under stress conditions and in some cancer cells (17Murphy M.E. The HSP70 family and cancer.Carcinogenesis. 2013; 34: 1181-1188Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). In addition to its fundamental function in protein quality control, hHsp70 also plays antistress and antisenescence roles (17Murphy M.E. The HSP70 family and cancer.Carcinogenesis. 2013; 34: 1181-1188Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Expression of hHsc70 is abundant and stable (18Liu T. Daniels C.K. Cao S. Comprehensive review on the HSC70 functions, interactions with related molecules and involvement in clinical diseases and therapeutic potential.Pharmacol. Ther. 2012; 136: 354-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Besides the overlap of fundamental functions with hHsp70, hHsc70 plays a role in multiple cellular processes, such as clathrin coat disassembly and chaperone-mediated autophagy (18Liu T. Daniels C.K. Cao S. Comprehensive review on the HSC70 functions, interactions with related molecules and involvement in clinical diseases and therapeutic potential.Pharmacol. Ther. 2012; 136: 354-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Heat shock proteins play critical roles in rapid cell division, metastasis, and evasion of apoptosis of cancer cells through their function in protein quality control (19Vahid S. Thaper D. Zoubeidi A. Chaperoning the cancer: the proteostatic functions of the heat shock proteins in cancer.Recent Pat. Anticancer Drug Discov. 2017; 12: 35-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Hsp90 is responsible for the final maturation of about 200 client proteins, including some oncogene products (20Schopf F.H. Biebl M.M. Buchner J. The HSP90 chaperone machinery.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2017; 18: 345-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). Hsp90 has been successfully linked to cancer therapy (20Schopf F.H. Biebl M.M. Buchner J. The HSP90 chaperone machinery.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2017; 18: 345-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). Inhibitor development and clinical trials of Hsp90 have continued to expand rapidly. However, drug resistance of Hsp90 inhibitors has forced people to consider Hsp70 alone or combined with Hsp90 as a target for cancer therapy, since Hsp70 often cooperates with Hsp90 in protein maturation and is also responsible for ultimate maturation of some proteins (21Kumar S.

Although the number of Hsp70 inhibitors is growing rapidly with the development of plate screening, there is still no breakthrough in terms of clinical trials. Inhibitors of Hsp70 can be divided into three general types according to their binding site and mechanism. The first type targets the NBD of Hsp70.

They also found that PES interacts more strongly with hHsp70 than hHsc70, and PES is more toxic to tumor cells than normal cells (24Leu J.I. Pimkina J. Frank A. Murphy M.E. George D.L.

PES-Cl, a derivative of PES, is more efficient at killing cancer cells than PES (25Balaburski G.M. Leu J.I. Beeharry N. Hayik S. Andrake M.D. Zhang G. Herlyn M. Villanueva J. Dunbrack Jr., R.L.

Efforts are underway to develop PES as an anticancer drug, alone or for combination therapy (32Monma H. Harashima N. Inao T. Okano S. Tajima Y. Harada M.

However, the mechanism by which PES and its derivatives inhibit Hsp70 is still an enigma. Although George and coworkers detected interaction between hHsp70 and PES by ITC (36Leu J.I. Zhang P. Murphy M.E. Marmorstein R. George D.L. Structural basis for the inhibition of HSP70 and DnaK chaperones by small-molecule targeting of a C-terminal allosteric pocket.ACS Chem. Biol. 2014; 9: 2508-2516Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), there is still no high-resolution structure available for the complex of hHsp70 and PES, so detailed information regarding the mode of interaction is still lacking. Some research suggests that PES can act like a detergent (16Schlecht R. Scholz S.R. Dahmen H. Wegener A. Sirrenberg C. Musil D. Bomke J. Eggenweiler H.M. Mayer M.P. Bukau B. Functional analysis of Hsp70 inhibitors.PLoS One. 2013; 8e78443Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Cytotoxicity of PES was found to be related to elevation of ROS in cells (37Ribas J. Mattiolo P. Boix J. Pharmacological modulation of reactive oxygen species in cancer treatment.Curr. Drug Targets. 2015; 16: 31-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). PES was suspected to cause covalent modification and cross-linking of p53 (38Jamil S. Hojabrpour P. Duronio V. The small molecule 2-phenylethynesulfonamide induces covalent modification of p53.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2017; 482: 154-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Since PES is an alkyne i.e., it contains a carbon–carbon triple bond, which is adjacent to an electron-withdrawing sulfonamide group, PES is predicted to be a potential Michael acceptor (Fig. 1). The Michael addition reaction of thiols in peptides with compounds containing a carbon–carbon triple bond has been demonstrated previously (39Gray V.J. Cuthbertson J. Wilden J.D.

Lett. 2015; 25: 763-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). This suggests that PES and its derivatives could react with thiol groups within proteins. To explore whether PES can react with thiols in Hsp70 proteins, we tested whether PES can covalently attach to hHsp70 and further measured the effect of PES covalent modification on the structure and function of hHsp70. We also probed the factors that affect PES modification of hHsp70 and compared the reactivity of PES with hHsp70 and hHsc70. This study provides an approach for development of covalent inhibitors of hHsp70. The stable interaction between PES and hHsp70 was previously demonstrated by pull-down of proteins in tumor cells using biotin-labeled PES, and the interaction was found to be related to the SBDα of hHsp70 (24Leu J.I. Pimkina J. Frank A. Murphy M.E. George D.L. A small molecule inhibitor of inducible heat shock protein 70.Mol. Cell. 2009; 36: 15-27Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism of this interaction remains unknown. In our previous study, we found that Cys-574 and Cys-603 are reactive and readily undergo modification (41Yang J. Zhang H. Gong W. Liu Z. Wu H. Hu W. Chen X. Wang L. Wu S. Chen C. Perrett S.

Chem. 2020; 295: 8302-8324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). As PES is an alkyne, there is the potential for it to undergo a Michael addition reaction with protein thiol groups (39Gray V.J. Cuthbertson J. Wilden J.D.

Lett. 2015; 25: 763-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). To test whether PES can react with hHsp70, we incubated PES and hHsp70 at different concentration ratios and for different time periods in the presence of ADP at 37 °C. Size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) can be used to monitor cysteine modifications of SBDα (41Yang J. Zhang H. Gong W. Liu Z. Wu H. Hu W. Chen X. Wang L. Wu S. Chen C. Perrett S. S-Glutathionylation of human inducible Hsp70 reveals a regulatory mechanism involving the C-terminal α-helical lid.J. Biol. Chem. 2020; 295: 8302-8324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). At low concentration ratios (<10:1) of PES to hHsp70 and short incubation times (<12 h), we just observed a weak peak shift in SEC. When the concentration ratio of PES to hHsp70 reached 100:1 and the incubation time reached 24 h, an obvious peak shift was observed by SEC, similar to the change induced by glutathionylation, as observed previously (41Yang J. Zhang H. Gong W. Liu Z. Wu H. Hu W. Chen X. Wang L. Wu S. Chen C. Perrett S. S-Glutathionylation of human inducible Hsp70 reveals a regulatory mechanism involving the C-terminal α-helical lid.J. Biol. Chem. 2020; 295: 8302-8324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). The incubated samples were then subjected to HPLC-Q-TOF MS and nanoLC-LTQ-Orbitrap XL MS/MS to identify the location of the PES modification. After incubation with PES, the molecular weight of full-length hHsp70 or hHsp70 SBD(385–641) increased by 362.42 Da or 365.0 Da, respectively (Fig. 2, A–D), while the molecular weight of hHsp70 NBD(1–385) did not increase, as indicated by HPLC-Q-TOF MS. These results indicate that two PES molecules interact with the SBD of each hHsp70 molecule (molecular weight of PES is 181.21 Da). NanoLC-LTQ-Orbitrap XL MS/MS was then performed on the PES-bound full-length hHsp70 to identify the modification site. The results confirmed that Cys-574 and Cys-603 undergo PES modification in ADP-bound WT hHsp70 (Fig. 2, E–F), suggesting that PES covalently reacts with Cys-574 and Cys-603 in the SBDα of hHsp70 by Michael addition (Fig. 1). However, for the isolated hHsp70 SBDα(511–641), under the same PES incubation conditions, only a very small proportion of SBDα was modified by PES (Fig. 2, G–H), suggesting that PES modification occurs more readily in full-length hHsp70 or the isolated SBD than in the further truncated SBDα alone. In order to investigate the conformational changes that occur upon PES modification of the two C-terminal Cys residues, we used the truncation mutant hHsp70 SBD(385–641), which contains both the SBDβ substrate binding site and the SBDα lid (Table 1). The tryptophan fluorescence spectra (Fig. 3A) and far-UV CD spectra (Fig. 3B) showed significant structural change indicating loss of α-helical structure upon PES modification of the SBD. This is similar to the changes observed for glutathionylation of the SBD (41Yang J. Zhang H. Gong W. Liu Z. Wu H. Hu W. Chen X. Wang L. Wu S. Chen C. Perrett S. S-Glutathionylation of human inducible Hsp70 reveals a regulatory mechanism involving the C-terminal α-helical lid.J. Biol. Chem. 2020; 295: 8302-8324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Analytical SEC showed disappearance of oligomeric elution peaks, indicating a reduction in the degree of oligomerization of the SBD upon PES modification (Fig. 3C), again similar to the effects of glutathionylation (41Yang J. Zhang H. Gong W. Liu Z. Wu H. Hu W. Chen X. Wang L. Wu S. Chen C. Perrett S. S-Glutathionylation of human inducible Hsp70 reveals a regulatory mechanism involving the C-terminal α-helical lid.J. Biol. Chem. 2020; 295: 8302-8324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). The higher UV absorbance of PES-modified SBD was from the absorbance of PES (Fig. 3C). The 1H-15N NMR HSQC spectrum of the hHsp70 SBD showed a number of weak peaks, caused by a distribution of oligomeric states (Fig. 3E). Upon PES modification, the 1H-15 N NMR HSQC spectrum of the hHsp70 SBD showed stronger peaks and appearance of new peaks, similar to the effects of glutathionylation (Fig. 3E). The changes in the NMR spectrum also suggest a transition from oligomer to monomer consistent with the analytical SEC results (Fig. 3C). To test whether the structural changes are caused by cysteine modification, we incubated the C574A/C603A mutant SBD(385–641)-AA with PES. Both the far-UV CD spectra and the 1H-15N NMR HSQC spectra indicated that SBD(385-641)-AA does not undergo any changes in structure after incubation with PES (Fig. 3, D and F), which excludes an effect of noncovalent binding of PES on the structure of the SBD. The similarity in 1H-15N NMR HSQC spectra of the hHsp70 SBD upon PES modification and glutathionylation indicates similar 3-D structures of PES-modified and glutathionylated hHsp70 SBD. We previously solved the NMR structure of the glutathionylated hHsp70 SBD, which showed that glutathionylation within the SBDα leads to unfolding of the SBDα, and the unfolded C-terminal region blocks the substrate binding site through binding of residue Leu542 in the hydrophobic site of the SBDβ (41Yang J. Zhang H. Gong W. Liu Z. Wu H. Hu W. Chen X. Wang L. Wu S. Chen C. Perrett S. S-Glutathionylation of human inducible Hsp70 reveals a regulatory mechanism involving the C-terminal α-helical lid.J. Biol. Chem. 2020; 295: 8302-8324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). This structure can also explain the changes in tryptophan fluorescence, far-UV CD, and SEC profile of PES-modified SBD. It is likely that a covalent inhibitor of hHsp70 could have similar effects as glutathionylation to turn off chaperone activity of hHsp70. Therefore, we further investigated the effect of PES modification on function of hHsp70 by ATPase assay, peptide binding assay, and luciferase refolding assay. The PES-modified hHsp70 had increased ATPase activity and decreased peptide binding ability, similar to glutathionylated hHsp70 (Fig. 4, A–B). However, the amplitude of increase in ATPase activity of PES-modified hHsp70 was smaller than for glutathionylated hHsp70 (Fig. 4A). PES-Cl is a derivative of PES and shows higher efficiency in killing cancer cells than PES (25Balaburski G.M. Leu J.I. Beeharry N. Hayik S. Andrake M.D. Zhang G. Herlyn M. Villanueva J. Dunbrack Jr., R.L. Yen T. George D.L. Murphy M.E. A modified HSP70 inhibitor shows broad activity as an anticancer agent.Mol. Cancer Res. 2013; 11: 219-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Interaction of PES-Cl with Hsp70 has also been reported (25Balaburski G.M. Leu J.I. Beeharry N. Hayik S. Andrake M.D. Zhang G. Herlyn M. Villanueva J. Dunbrack Jr., R.L. Yen T. George D.L. Murphy M.E. A modified HSP70 inhibitor shows broad activity as an anticancer agent.Mol. Cancer Res. 2013; 11: 219-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). We compared the ATPase activity of hHsp70 and hHsc70 after treatment with PES or PES-Cl and found that the ATPase activity was higher after PES-Cl treatment than PES treatment, but still not as high as glutathionylation (Fig. 4A). The acceleratory effects of the cochaperones Hdj1 and Bag1 on ATPase activity of hHsp70 and hHsc70 were similar or only slightly increased after PES or PES-Cl treatment (Fig. 4C). Luciferase refolding activity of hHsp70 and hHsc70 was enhanced two- to three-fold by Hdj1 (Fig. 4, D–E). PES or PES-Cl treatment weakened the promoti"

However, it has not yet evolved into a medical intervention, mainly because most developed inhibitors target the zinc in IDE's catalytic site, potentially causing toxicity to other essential metalloproteases. Since IDE is a cellular receptor for the varicella-zoster virus (VZV), we constructed a VZV-based inhibitor. We computationally characterized its interaction site with IDE showing that the peptide specifically binds inside IDE's central cavity, however, not in close proximity to the zinc ion. We confirmed the peptide's effective inhibition on IDE activity in vitro and showed its efficacy in ameliorating insulin-related defects in types 1 and 2 diabetes mouse models. In addition, we suggest that inhibition of IDE may ameliorate the pro-inflammatory profile of CD4+ T-cells toward insulin. Together, we propose a potential role of a designed VZV-derived peptide to serve as a selectively-targeted and as an efficient diabetes therapy."

In the present study we evaluate the role of the two receptors, TNF-receptor (TNF-R)p55 and TNF-Rp75, in the mouse model of suture-induced corneal neovascularization and lymphangiogenesis. Corneal neovascularization and lymphangiogenesis were induced by three 11–0 intrastromal corneal sutures in wild-type (WT) C57BL/6J mice and TNF-Rp55-deficient ( TNF-Rp55d ) and TNF-Rp75-deficient ( TNF-Rp75d ) mice. The mRNA expression of VEGF-A, VEGF-C, Lyve-1 and TNFα and its receptors was quantified by qPCR. The area covered with blood- or lymphatic vessels, respectively, was analyzed by immunohistochemistry of corneal flatmounts. Expression and localization of TNFα and its receptors was assessed by immunohistochemistry of sagittal sections and Western Blot. Both receptors are expressed in the murine cornea and are not differentially regulated by the genetic alteration. Both TNF-Rp55d and TNF-Rp75d mice showed a decrease in vascularized area compared to wild-type mice 14 days after suture treatment. After 21 days there were no differences detectable between the groups. The number of VEGF-A-expressing macrophages did not differ when comparing WT to TNF-Rp55d and TNF-Rp75d . The mRNA expression of lymphangiogenic markers VEGF-C or LYVE-1 does not increase after suture in all 3 groups and lymphangiogenesis showed a delayed effect only for TNF-Rp75d . TNFα mRNA and protein expression increased after suture treatment but showed no difference between the three groups. In the suture-induced mouse model, TNFα and its ligands TNF-Rp55 and TNF-Rp75 do not play a significant role in the pathogenesis of neovascularisation and lymphangiogenesis."

We applied an emotional distress paradigm targeting negative emotions thought to be relevant for interpersonal difficulties and therapeutic resistance mechanisms. Methods The current study applied to 44 female participants with newly diagnosed AN or BN and 20 matched controls a neuroimaging paradigm eliciting affective responses. The measurements also included an extensive assessment comprising clinical scales, neuropsychological tests, measures of emotion processing and empathy. Results AN and BN did not differ from controls in terms of emotional response, emotion matching, self-reported empathy and cognitive performance. However, eating disorder and psychopathological clinical scores, as well as alexithymia levels, were increased in AN and BN. On a neural level, no significant group differences emerged, even when focusing on a region of interest selected a priori: the amygdala. Some interesting findings put in relation the hippocampal activity with the level of Body Dissatisfaction of the participants, the relative importance of the key nodes for the common network in the decoding of different emotions (BN = right amygdala, AN = anterior cingulate area), and the qualitative profile of the deactivations. Conclusions Our data do not support the hypothesis that participants with AN or BN display reduced emotional responsiveness. However, peculiar characteristics in emotion processing could be associated to the three different groups. Therefore, relational difficulties in eating disorders, as well as therapeutic resistance, could be not secondary to a simple difficulty in feeling and identifying basic negative emotions in AN and BN participants."
https://openalex.org/W3144440713,"Class switch recombination (CSR) is the process by which B cells switch production from IgM/IgD to other immunoglobulin isotypes, enabling them to mount an effective immune response against pathogens. Timely resolution of CSR prevents damage due to an uncontrolled and prolonged immune response. While many positive regulators of CSR have been described, negative regulators of CSR are relatively unknown. Using an shRNA library screen targeting more than 28,000 genes in a mouse B cell line, we have identified a novel, uncharacterized protein of 82kD (KIAA1841, NM_027860), which we have named SANBR (SANT and BTB domain regulator of CSR), as a negative regulator of CSR. The purified, recombinant BTB domain of SANBR exhibited characteristic properties such as homodimerization and interaction with corepressor proteins, including HDAC and SMRT. Overexpression of SANBR inhibited CSR in primary mouse splenic B cells, and inhibition of CSR is dependent on the BTB domain while the SANT domain is largely dispensable. Thus, we have identified a new member of the BTB family that serves as a negative regulator of CSR. Future investigations to identify transcriptional targets of SANBR in B cells will reveal further insights into the specific mechanisms by which SANBR regulates CSR as well as fundamental gene regulatory activities of this protein."
https://openalex.org/W3149712376,"New and more efficient methods to sustainably intensify Aquaculture production are essential to attain the seafood demand for direct human consumption in the near future. Nutrition has been identified as one strategy of early exposure that might affect animal early development and later phenotype. This strategy may have positive consequences in the modulation of fish digestive physiology, which will correlate with higher performance outputs. Thus, improving fish digestive efficiency will lead to higher productivity and lower biogenic emission from aquaculture facilities, minimising the impact on the environment while increasing the biological efficiency. An innovative in ovo nutritional modulation technique based on low-frequency ultrasounds was used to enhance the transport of amino acids across the embryo membranes. An early stimulus with either arginine or glutamine, both involved in gut maturation, was applied in zebrafish ( Danio rerio ) embryos at 3.5 hours post-fertilization (hpf). At 22 days post-fertilization (dpf), growth performance, digestive enzyme activities and gut microbiota composition were analysed to evaluate the larval nutrition-induced metabolic plasticity and the effects on fish digestive efficiency. Results showed that fish survival was not affected either by the sonophoresis technique or amino acid supplementation. Final dry weight at 22 dpf was statistically higher in larvae from glutamine treatment when compared to the control even with lower trypsin activity, suggesting a higher nutrient digestion capacity, due to a slightly modulation of gut microbiota. Higher arginine supplementation levels should be tested as strategy to enhance growth at later developmental stages. In conclusion, this study demonstrated the efficiency of sonophoresis technique for in ovo nutritional modulation and suggests that in ovo glutamine supplementation might promote growth at later developmental stage through a positive microbiota modulation."
https://openalex.org/W3151871963,"A novel penalty for the proportional hazards model under the interval-censored failure time data structure is discussed, with which the subject of variable selection is rarely studied. The penalty comes from an idea to approximate some information criterion, e.g., the BIC or AIC, and the core process is to smooth the ℓ 0 norm. Compared with usual regularization methods, the proposed approach is free of heavily time-consuming hyperparameter tuning. The efficiency is further improved by fitting the model and selecting variables in one step. To achieve this, sieve likelihood is introduced, which simultaneously estimates the coefficients and baseline cumulative hazards function. Furthermore, it is shown that the three desired properties for penalties, i.e., continuity, sparsity, and unbiasedness, are all guaranteed. Numerical results show that the proposed sparse estimation method is of great accuracy and efficiency. Finally, the method is used on data of Nigerian children and the key factors that have effects on child mortality are found."

https://openalex.org/W3145854958,"On 15 April 2020, space-based gamma ray detectors recorded one of the most elusive events in astronomy—a giant flare erupting from a magnetar, a highly magnetized neutron star, in a neighboring galaxy. Over previous decades only three magnetar giant flares have been confirmed, and the road to understanding them has paralleled the study of magnetars themselves. In 1979, the first giant flare arrived at the dawn of gamma ray astronomy. U.S., European, and Soviet teams, in a rare case of Cold War–era collaboration, recognized it was from a source unknown to science. But it wasn9t until 1992 that scientists postulated a possible cause: a starquake rearranging the surface of a neutron star 1 trillion times more magnetized than a refrigerator magnet. Since then, magnetars have been invoked again and again as the possible engine behind several types of unexplained astrophysical explosions. The 2020 giant flare, studied in greater detail than ever before, supports several aspects of the starquake model—and suggests both magnetars and their rare quakes are still common enough to be linked to many other transient events seen in the more distant universe."
