https://openalex.org/W4220998607,"Immune memory is tailored by cues that lymphocytes perceive during priming. The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic created a situation in which nascent memory could be tracked through additional antigen exposures. Both SARS-CoV-2 infection and vaccination induce multifaceted, functional immune memory, but together, they engender improved protection from disease, termed hybrid immunity. We therefore investigated how vaccine-induced memory is shaped by previous infection. We found that following vaccination, previously infected individuals generated more SARS-CoV-2 RBD-specific memory B cells and variant-neutralizing antibodies and a distinct population of IFN-γ and IL-10-expressing memory SARS-CoV-2 spike-specific CD4+ T cells than previously naive individuals. Although additional vaccination could increase humoral memory in previously naive individuals, it did not recapitulate the distinct CD4+ T cell cytokine profile observed in previously infected subjects. Thus, imprinted features of SARS-CoV-2-specific memory lymphocytes define hybrid immunity."

CRISPR–Cas12a systems enable versatile multiple-genomic-loci targeting by processing numerous CRISPR RNAs (crRNAs) from a single transcript; however, their low efficiency has hindered in vivo applications. Through structure-guided protein engineering, we developed a hyper-efficient Lachnospiraceae bacterium Cas12a variant, termed hyperCas12a, with its catalytically dead version hyperdCas12a showing significantly enhanced efficacy for gene activation, particularly at low concentrations of crRNA. We demonstrate that hyperdCas12a has comparable off-target effects compared with the wild-type system and exhibits enhanced activity for gene editing and repression. Delivery of the hyperdCas12a activator and a single crRNA array simultaneously activating the endogenous Oct4, Sox2 and Klf4 genes in the retina of post-natal mice alters the differentiation of retinal progenitor cells. The hyperCas12a system offers a versatile in vivo tool for a broad range of gene-modulation and gene-therapy applications. Through structure-guided protein engineering, Guo et al. developed a Lachnospiraceae bacterium Cas12a variant with enhanced editing efficiency and applied the enzyme-dead version of this variant for multiplex gene activation in the mouse retina."

https://openalex.org/W4223458019,"Recently, the effects of weed control on crop yield, quality and soil fertility have been increasingly investigated. However, soil microorganism diversity under weed control, especially for aromatic plants, is little studied. Mechanical weeding effects on soil fertility and microbial diversity in star anise plantations remain unknown, limiting improvements in crop quality and yield through weed control. Therefore, mechanical weeding (MW) and no weeding (NW) zones were randomly designed in the same star anise plantation to study the mechanical weeding impacts on soil biological properties and microbial diversity. The phosphatase activity of MW soil was significantly higher than that of NW soil; however, aminopeptidase activity was significantly lower than that under NW. There was no significant difference in β-glucosidase activity between MW and NW. Moreover, soil microbial biomass C and N in MW soil were significantly higher than those of NW, but soil microbial biomass P was significantly lower than that of NW. Proteobacteria, Acidobacteria, Actinobacteria, Chloroflexi, Planctomycetes, WPS-2, Firmicutes and Verrucomicrobia were the predominant bacterial phyla in MW and NW soils. Specifically, Bacteroidetes was enriched in MW soil, being the unique dominant bacteria. Ascomycota, Basidiomycota, unclassified_k_Fungi, Rozellomycota and Mortierellomycota were the predominant fungi in MW and NW soils. The numbers of dominant bacterial genera (> 1%) were 26 and 23 for NW and MW soils, respectively. Among them, norank_f__norank_o__norank_c__Subgroup_6, 1921-2 and norank_f__norank_o__B12-WMSP1 went undetected in MW soil. Moreover, the numbers of dominant fungi in soils of star anise plantations were 11 and 9 for NW and MW, respectively. Among them, only unclassified_f__Clavicipitaceae and Mortierella went undetected in MW soils. Thus, soil microbial community structures are not significantly altered by mechanical weeding. The above results suggest that soil fertility can be improved and soil heath can be maintained by mechanical weeding in star anise plantations. Moreover, soil-borne diseases maybe easily occurred under NW treatment in star anise plantation."
https://openalex.org/W4223510650,"Children may be at higher risk for swimming-associated illness following exposure to fecally-contaminated recreational waters. We analyzed a pooled data set of over 80,000 beachgoers from 13 beach sites across the United States to compare risks associated with the fecal indicator bacteria Enterococcus spp. (measured by colony forming units, CFU and quantitative polymerase chain reaction cell equivalents, qPCR CE) for different age groups across different exposures, sites and health endpoints.Sites were categorized according to the predominant type of fecal contamination (human or non-human). Swimming exposures of varying intensity were considered according to degree of contact and time spent in the water. Health endpoints included gastrointestinal and respiratory symptoms and skin rashes. Logistic regression models were used to analyze the risk of illness as a function of fecal contamination in water as measured by Enterococcus spp. among the exposed groups. Non-swimmers (those who did not enter the water) were excluded from the models to reduce bias and facilitate comparison across groups.Gastrointestinal symptoms were the most sensitive health endpoint and strongest associations were observed with Enterococcus qPCR CE at sites impacted by human fecal contamination. Under several exposure scenarios, associations between illness and Enterococcus spp. levels were significantly higher among children compared to adolescents and adults. Respiratory symptoms were also associated with Enterococcus spp. exposures among young children at sites affected by human fecal sources, although small sample sizes resulted in imprecise estimates for these associations.Under many exposure scenarios, children were at higher risk of illness associated with exposure to fecal contamination as measured by the indicator bacteria Enterococcus spp. The source of fecal contamination and the intensity of swimming exposure were also important factors affecting the association between Enterococcus spp. and swimming-associated illness."
https://openalex.org/W4226363819,"Harnessing the plant microbiome has the potential to improve agricultural yields and protect plants against pathogens and/or abiotic stresses, while also relieving economic and environmental costs of crop production. While previous studies have gained valuable insights into the underlying genetics facilitating plant-fungal interactions, these have largely been skewed towards certain fungal clades (e.g. arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi). Several different phyla of fungi have been shown to positively impact plant growth rates, including Mortierellaceae fungi. However, the extent of the plant growth promotion (PGP) phenotype(s), their underlying mechanism(s), and the impact of bacterial endosymbionts on fungal-plant interactions remain poorly understood for Mortierellaceae. In this study, we focused on the symbiosis between soil fungus Linnemannia elongata (Mortierellaceae) and Arabidopsis thaliana (Brassicaceae), as both organisms have high-quality reference genomes and transcriptomes available, and their lifestyles and growth requirements are conducive to research conditions. Further, L . elongata can host bacterial endosymbionts related to Mollicutes and Burkholderia . The role of these endobacteria on facilitating fungal-plant associations, including potentially further promoting plant growth, remains completely unexplored. We measured Arabidopsis aerial growth at early and late life stages, seed production, and used mRNA sequencing to characterize differentially expressed plant genes in response to fungal inoculation with and without bacterial endosymbionts. We found that L . elongata improved aerial plant growth, seed mass and altered the plant transcriptome, including the upregulation of genes involved in plant hormones and “response to oxidative stress”, “defense response to bacterium”, and “defense response to fungus”. Furthermore, the expression of genes in certain phytohormone biosynthetic pathways were found to be modified in plants treated with L . elongata . Notably, the presence of Mollicutes- or Burkholderia- related endosymbionts in Linnemannia did not impact the expression of genes in Arabidopsis or overall growth rates. Together, these results indicate that beneficial plant growth promotion and seed mass impacts of L . elongata on Arabidopsis are likely driven by plant hormone and defense transcription responses after plant-fungal contact, and that plant phenotypic and transcriptional responses are independent of whether the fungal symbiont is colonized by Mollicutes or Burkholderia -related endohyphal bacteria."
https://openalex.org/W4223491166,"Intercellular communication orchestrates a multitude of physiologic and pathologic conditions. Algorithms to infer cell-cell communication and predict downstream signalling and regulatory networks are needed to illuminate mechanisms of stem cell differentiation and tissue development. Here, to fill this gap, we developed and applied CellComm to investigate how the aorta-gonad-mesonephros microenvironment dictates haematopoietic stem and progenitor cell emergence. We identified key microenvironmental signals and transcriptional networks that regulate haematopoietic development, including Stat3, Nr0b2, Ybx1 and App, and confirmed their roles using zebrafish, mouse and human models. Notably, CellComm revealed extensive crosstalk among signalling pathways and convergence on common transcriptional regulators, indicating a resilient developmental programme that ensures dynamic adaptation to changes in the embryonic environment. Our work provides an algorithm and data resource for the scientific community."
https://openalex.org/W4223624618,"Students generally struggle to build a good career after their graduation in developing countries like Bangladesh. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, such struggle increased and faced with stress and depression. We aimed to inquire about the amplitude of depression and stress among university students during the COVID-19 pandemic regarding their future careers and to identify the factors associated with this depression and stress.A total of 516 students at various universities participated in this cross-sectional survey. From October 2020 to February 2021, data was collected through an online survey. An e-questionnaire with socio-demographic, Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10) questions was created using Google Forms and distributed via Facebook, WhatsApp, and other social media platforms. The universities included into the sample were selected randomly from eight divisions of Bangladesh. Descriptive statistics and Pearson chi-square tests were carried out and the association between the risk factors and the outcome (e.g. depression and stress) was assessed by the odds ratio (OR) including 95% confidence interval (CI) obtained from the binary logistic regression model.Among 516 participants, 380 (73.6%) were male and 136 (26.4%) were female. Around 414 (80.2%) participants had mild to severe depression and 399 (77.3%) reported having low to moderately perceived stress. Female students were 2.1 (95% CI: 1.21-3.76) times more depressed and 3.6 (95% CI: 1.87-6.76) times more stressed than the counterpart. Students, who think delaying graduation due to COVID-19 will reduce the chance of getting a job, were 1.72 (95% CI: 1.07-2.76) times more depressed. Respondents, whose department offers any internship were 36% less depressed (p = 0.053), while skilled students were 46% less stressed though it was not statistically significant (p = 0.43).According to our findings, there is an increasing prevalence of depression and stress among students, particularly among female students and those who do not receive job-related facilities from their institutions or who are unskilled. Universities can provide mental health programs and strive to have enough space for students to participate in internships. In addition, the government and educational institutions should work together to address the growing challenge."
https://openalex.org/W4223422721,"The aim of the present study is to detect the presence of SARS-CoV-2 of patients affected by COVID-19 in olfactory mucosa (OM), sampled with nasal brushing (NB) and biopsy, and to assess whether a non-invasive procedure, such as NB, might be used as a large-scale procedure for demonstrating SARS-CoV-2 presence in olfactory neuroepithelium. Nasal brushings obtained from all the COVID-19 patients resulted positive to SARS-CoV-2 immunocytochemistry while controls were negative. Double immunofluorescence showed that SARS-CoV-2 positive cells included supporting cells as well as olfactory neurons and basal cells. OM biopsies showed an uneven distribution of SARS-CoV-2 positivity along the olfactory neuroepithelium, while OM from controls were negative. SARS-CoV-2 was distinctively found in sustentacular cells, olfactory neurons, and basal cells, supporting what was observed in NB. Ultrastructural analysis of OM biopsies showed SARS-CoV-2 viral particles in the cytoplasm of sustentacular cells. This study shows the presence of SARS-CoV-2 at the level of the olfactory neuroepithelium in patients affected by COVID-19. For the first time, we used NB as a rapid non-invasive tool for assessing a potential neuroinvasion by SARS-CoV-2 infection."
https://openalex.org/W4223450660,"Passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) has proven a powerful tool for the study of marine mammals, allowing for documentation of biologically relevant factors such as movement patterns or animal behaviors while remaining largely non-invasive and cost effective. From 2008-2019, a set of PAM recordings covering the frequency band of most toothed whale (odontocete) echolocation clicks were collected at sites off the islands of Hawai'i, Kaua'i, and Pearl and Hermes Reef. However, due to the size of this dataset and the complexity of species-level acoustic classification, multi-year, multi-species analyses had not yet been completed. This study shows how a machine learning toolkit can effectively mitigate this problem by detecting and classifying echolocation clicks using a combination of unsupervised clustering methods and human-mediated analyses. Using these methods, it was possible to distill ten unique echolocation click 'types' attributable to regional odontocetes at the genus or species level. In one case, auxiliary sightings and recordings were used to attribute a new click type to the rough-toothed dolphin, Steno bredanensis. Types defined by clustering were then used as input classes in a neural-network based classifier, which was trained, tested, and evaluated on 5-minute binned data segments. Network precision was variable, with lower precision occurring most notably for false killer whales, Pseudorca crassidens, across all sites (35-76%). However, accuracy and recall were high (>96% and >75%, respectively) in all cases except for one type of short-finned pilot whale, Globicephala macrorhynchus, call class at Kaua'i and Pearl and Hermes Reef (recall >66%). These results emphasize the utility of machine learning in analysis of large PAM datasets. The classifier and timeseries developed here will facilitate further analyses of spatiotemporal patterns of included toothed whales. Broader application of these methods may improve the efficiency of global multi-species PAM data processing for echolocation clicks, which is needed as these datasets continue to grow."
https://openalex.org/W4223476319,"Phosphatidylserine (PS) is a minor phospholipid constituent of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) that exhibits potent anti-inflammatory activity. It remains indeterminate whether PS incorporation can enhance anti-inflammatory effects of reconstituted HDL (rHDL). Human macrophages were treated with rHDL containing phosphatidylcholine alone (PC-rHDL) or PC and PS (PC/PS-rHDL). Interleukin (IL)-6 secretion and expression was more strongly inhibited by PC/PS-rHDL than PC-rHDL in both tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α- and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated macrophages. siRNA experiments revealed that the enhanced anti-inflammatory effects of PC/PS-rHDL required scavenger receptor class B type I (SR-BI). Furthermore, PC/PS-rHDL induced a greater increase in Akt1/2/3 phosphorylation than PC-rHDL. In addition, PC/PS but not PC-rHDL decreased the abundance of plasma membrane lipid rafts and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK) phosphorylation. Finally, when these rHDL formulations were administered to dyslipidemic low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-receptor knockout mice fed a high-cholesterol diet, circulating IL-6 levels were significantly reduced only in PC/PS-rHDL-treated mice. In parallel, enhanced Akt1/2/3 phosphorylation by PC/PS-rHDL was observed in the mouse aortic tissue using immunohistochemistry. We concluded that the incorporation of PS into rHDLs enhanced their anti-inflammatory activity by modulating Akt1/2/3- and p38 MAPK-mediated signaling through SR-BI in stimulated macrophages. These data identify PS as a potent anti-inflammatory component capable of enhancing therapeutic potential of rHDL-based therapy."
https://openalex.org/W4223500859,"Most of the cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) were reported in Saudi Arabia. Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4) was identified as the receptor for the virus. The level of soluble DPP4 (sDPP4) was found to be reduced in MERS-CoV infected patients while high levels of sDPP4 were suggested to be protective against MERS-CoV in animal models. We investigated whether the Saudi population has lower levels of sDPP4 which makes them more susceptible to MERS-CoV infection and, therefore, could explain the larger number of cases from the country. Blood samples were collected from 219 Saudi blood donors and 200 blood donors from other ethnic groups. The plasma level of sDPP4 was measured by ELISA and the following SNPs in the DPP4 gene; rs35128070, rs1861978, rs79700168, and rs17574, were genotyped by TaqMan SNP genotyping assay. The average level of plasma sDDP4 was significantly lower in Saudis than other Arabs and non-Arabs (P value 0.0003 and 0.012, respectively). The genotypes AG of rs35128070 and GT of rs1861978 were significantly associated with lower sDPP4 among Saudis (P value 0.002 for each). While both genotypes AA and AG of rs79700168 and rs17574 were associated with significantly lower average sDPP4 level in Saudis compared to other ethnic groups (P value 0.031 and 0.032, and 0.027 and 0.014, respectively). Herein, we report that the Saudi population has lower levels of plasma sDPP4 than other ethnic groups, which is associated with genetic variants in the DPP4 gene. This may have contributed to increase the susceptibility of the Saudi population to MERS-CoV infection and could be a factor in the long-lasting persistence of the virus in the country."
https://openalex.org/W4223503635,"Background Handwashing with soap has the potential to curb cholera transmission. This research explores how populations experienced and responded to the 2017 cholera outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and how this affected their handwashing behaviour. Methods Cholera cases were identified through local cholera treatment centre records. Comparison individuals were recruited from the same neighbourhoods by identifying households with no recent confirmed or suspected cholera cases. Multiple qualitative methods were employed to understand hand hygiene practices and their determinants, including unstructured observations, interviews and focus group discussions. The data collection tools and analysis were informed by the Behaviour Centred Design Framework. Comparisons were made between the experiences and practices of people from case households and participants from comparison households. Results Cholera was well understood by the population and viewed as a persistent and common health challenge. Handwashing with soap was generally observed to be rare during the outbreak despite self-reported increases in behaviour. Across case and comparison groups, individuals were unable to prioritise handwashing due to competing food-scarcity and livelihood challenges and there was little in the physical or social environments to cue handwashing or make it a convenient, rewarding or desirable to practice. The ability of people from case households to practice handwashing was further constrained by their exposure to cholera which in addition to illness, caused profound non-health impacts to household income, productivity, social status, and their sense of control. Conclusions Even though cholera outbreaks can cause disruptions to many determinants of behaviour, these shifts do not automatically facilitate an increase in preventative behaviours like handwashing with soap. Hygiene programmes targeting outbreaks within complex crises could be strengthened by acknowledging the emic experiences of the disease and adopting sustainable solutions which build upon local disease coping mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W4223511788,"Pluripotent stem cells can be driven by manipulation of Wnt signalling through a series of states similar to those that occur during early embryonic development, transitioning from an epithelial phenotype into the cardiogenic-mesoderm lineage and ultimately into functional cardiomyocytes. Strikingly, we observed that initiation of differentiation in induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and embryonic stem cells triggers widespread apoptosis, followed by a synchronous epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT). Apoptosis is caused by the absence of bFGF in the differentiation medium. EMT requires induction of the transcription factors SNAI1 and SNAI2 downstream of MESP1 expression, and double knockout of SNAI1 and SNAI2 or loss of MESP1 in iPSCs blocks EMT and prevents cardiac differentiation. Remarkably, blockade of early apoptosis, either chemically or by ablation of pro-apoptotic genes, also completely prevents EMT, suppressing even the earliest events in mesoderm conversion, including T/BRA, TBX6 and MESP1 induction. Conditioned medium from WNT-activated wild-type iPSCs overcomes the block to EMT by cells incapable of apoptosis, suggesting involvement of soluble factors from apoptotic cells in mesoderm conversion. Knockout of the PANX1 channel blocked EMT, whereas treatment with a purinergic P2-receptor inhibitor or addition of apyrase demonstrated a requirement for nucleotide triphosphate signalling. ATP and/or UTP was sufficient to induce a partial EMT in apoptosis-incapable cells treated with WNT activator. Notably, knockout of the ATP/UTP-specific P2Y2 receptor blocked EMT and mesoderm induction. We conclude that in addition to acting as chemo-attractants for clearance of apoptotic cells, nucleotides can function as essential paracrine signals that, with WNT signalling, create a logical AND gate for mesoderm specification. Fort et al. implicate apoptosis and an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in the cardiomyocyte conversion of human stem cells. Nucleotides released from dying cells act through P2Y2 receptors on surviving cells to license WNT-dependent mesoderm specification."
https://openalex.org/W4223529322,"We have recently purified mammalian sterile 20 (STE20)-like kinase 3 (MST3) as a kinase for the multifunctional kinases, AMP-activated protein kinase-related kinases (ARKs). However, unresolved questions from this study, such as remaining phosphorylation activities following deletion of the Mst3 gene from human embryonic kidney cells and mice, led us to conclude that there were additional kinases for ARKs. Further purification recovered Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinases 1 and 2 (CaMKK1 and 2), and a third round of purification revealed mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase kinase 5 (MAP4K5) as potential kinases of ARKs. We then demonstrated that MST3 and MAP4K5, both belonging to the STE20-like kinase family, could phosphorylate all 14 ARKs both in vivo and in vitro. Further examination of all 28 STE20 kinases detected variable phosphorylation activity on AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and the salt-inducible kinase 3 (SIK3). Taken together, our results have revealed novel relationships between STE20 kinases and ARKs, with potential physiological and pathological implications."
https://openalex.org/W4226303384,"Epigenetic modification is a key driver of differentiation, and the deacetylase Sirtuin1 (SIRT1) is an established regulator of cell function, ageing, and articular cartilage homeostasis. Here we investigate the role of SIRT1 during development of chondrocytes by using human embryonic stem cells (hESCs). HESC-chondroprogenitors were treated with SIRT1 activator; SRT1720, or inhibitor; EX527, during differentiation. Activation of SIRT1 early in 3D-pellet culture led to significant increases in the expression of ECM genes for type-II collagen (COL2A1) and aggrecan (ACAN), and chondrogenic transcription factors SOX5 and ARID5B, with SOX5 ChIP analysis demonstrating enrichment on the chondrocyte specific –10 (A1) enhancer of ACAN. Unexpectedly, when SIRT1 was activated, while ACAN was enhanced, glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) were reduced, paralleled by down regulation of gene expression for N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase type 1 (GALNT1) responsible for GAG chain initiation/elongation. A positive correlation between ARID5B and COL2A1 was observed, and co-IP assays indicated association of ARID5B with SIRT1, further suggesting that COL2A1 expression is promoted by an ARID5B-SIRT1 interaction. In conclusion, SIRT1 activation positively impacts on the expression of the main ECM proteins, while altering ECM composition and suppressing GAG content during human cartilage development. These results suggest that SIRT1 activity has a differential effect on GAGs and proteins in developing hESC-chondrocytes and could only be beneficial to cartilage development and matrix protein synthesis if balanced by addition of positive GAG mediators."
https://openalex.org/W4223484403,"Obesity is associated with an increased incidence and aggressiveness of breast cancer and is estimated to increment the development of this tumor by 50 to 86%. These associations are driven, in part, by changes in the serum molecules. Epidemiological studies have reported that Metformin reduces the incidence of obesity-associated cancer, probably by regulating the metabolic state. In this study, we evaluated in a breast cancer in-vitro model the activation of the IR-β/Akt/p70S6K pathway by exposure to human sera with different metabolic and hormonal characteristics. Furthermore, we evaluated the effect of brief Metformin treatment on sera of obese postmenopausal women and its impact on Akt and NF-κB activation. We demonstrated that MCF-7 cells represent a robust cellular model to differentiate Akt pathway activation influenced by the stimulation with sera from obese women, resulting in increased cell viability rates compared to cells stimulated with sera from normal-weight women. In particular, stimulation with sera from postmenopausal obese women showed an increase in the phosphorylation of IR-β and Akt proteins. These effects were reversed after exposure of MCF-7 cells to sera from postmenopausal obese women with insulin resistance with Metformin treatment. Whereas sera from women without insulin resistance affected NF-κB regulation. We further demonstrated that sera from post-Metformin obese women induced an increase in p38 phosphorylation, independent of insulin resistance. Our results suggest a possible mechanism in which obesity-mediated serum molecules could enhance the development of luminal A-breast cancer by increasing Akt activation. Further, we provided evidence that the phenomenon was reversed by Metformin treatment in a subgroup of women."

In sub-Saharan Africa, accessing medical services is particularly challenging among women due to inadequate opportunities for socio-economic empowerment and meeting their unique healthcare needs. The present study aimed to explore the sociodemographic factors associated with health insurance ownership among women in selected countries in sub-Saharan Africa.We extracted cross-sectional data on health insurance ownership and conceptually relevant sociodemographic variables on women aged 15-49 years from Demographic and Health Surveys on five selected countries in sub-Saharan Africa (n = 55,438), including Burkina Faso, DR Congo, Cameroon, Gabon and Kenya. Data were analyzed using descriptive and multivariate regression analysis, and the associations were reported in terms of average marginal effects.Data revealed considerable cross-country variation in health insurance ownership: Gabon (57.9%), Kenya (6.1%), DR Congo (2.8%), Cameroon (1.1%), Burkina Faso (0.4%). In the multivariate regression analysis, women's age, marital status, place of residency, educational level, household wealth status, employment, and media access were significant predictors of insurance ownership. The associations were generally similar across the five countries, with higher age, better educational level and wealth status showing a consistently positive relationship with insurance ownership.Our findings revealed striking inequality in health insurance ownership among the studied countries, which should be given due attention to achieving universal healthcare-related goals. There also exist considerable sociodemographic disparities in health insurance ownership among women that should be addressed using context-specific programmatic interventions.

In response to changes in the metabolic environment (e.g., alterations in circulating glucose or lipid levels), networks of transcription factors and coregulators are recruited to specific genomic loci to fine-tune homeostatic gene regulation. Elucidating these mechanisms is of particular interest as these gene regulatory pathways can serve as potential targets to treat metabolic disease. The zinc-finger transcription factor Krüppel-like factor 15 (KLF15) is a critical regulator of metabolic homeostasis; however, its genome-wide distribution in skeletal muscle has not been previously identified. Here, we characterize the KLF15 cistrome in vivo in skeletal muscle and find that the majority of KLF15 binding is localized to distal intergenic regions and associated with genes related to circadian rhythmicity and lipid metabolism. We also identify critical interdependence between KLF15 and the nuclear receptor PPARδ in the regulation of lipid metabolic gene programs. We further demonstrate that KLF15 and PPARδ colocalize genome-wide, physically interact, and are dependent on one another to exert their transcriptional effects on target genes.

While the transcriptome driven by KLF15 has been well characterized across different tissue beds, we now turn our attention to the KLF15 cistrome and its interactions with other important metabolic regulators to fine-tune transcriptional activity. Of particular interest is the nuclear receptor (NR) superfamily of transcription factors, whose ligand-regulated function allows tight coupling of changes in the cellular environment with changes in transcription. The peroxisome proliferator–activated receptors (PPARs) are an important subfamily of ligand-activated NRs whose functions include the transcriptional regulation of cellular development and differentiation, nutrient homeostasis, and metabolism. In mammals, three members of this family have been identified: PPARα, PPARβ/δ, and PPARγ. All three isoforms are activated by natural fatty acids and their derivatives, whose sources include diet, de novo lipogenesis, and lipolysis, as well as synthetic lipophilic acids (16Grygiel-Górniak B. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors and their ligands: Nutritional and clinical implications – a review.Nutr. J. 2014; 13: 17Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar). The PPARs are of significant interest given their potential as therapeutic targets for a range of diseases, both metabolic and nonmetabolic (17Cheng H.S. Tan W.R. Low Z.S. Marvalim C. Lee J.Y.H.

PPARδ is the dominant isoform in adult skeletal muscle, and mice with skeletal muscle–restricted PPARδ deficiency share many of the same characteristics as mice with skeletal muscle–specific KLF15 deficiency: both strains suffer from abnormalities in exercise capacity, lipid utilization, and oxidative metabolism and are susceptible to diet-induced obesity (25Ehrenborg E.

Such similarities suggest potentially overlapping or synergistic roles of these important transcription factors. Here, for the first time, we characterize the KLF15 cistrome in vivo in skeletal muscle, shedding light on the mechanism by which KLF15 controls transcription of target genes. By using PPARδ as an example for KLF15 interaction with other metabolic regulators, we demonstrate that KLF15 and PPARδ colocalize and interact to impact the transcription of target genes. Furthermore, Klf15 deletion significantly altered PPARδ binding patterns and attenuated PPARδ transcriptional activity at critical lipid metabolism genes both at baseline and in response to pharmacological PPARδ agonism. These findings demonstrate KLF15’s role as a core component in metabolic transcriptional networks through its actions of facilitating the binding and activity of other transcription factors, thus fine-tuning the responses to different nutrient states and challenges that are requisite for homeostasis. Investigations into the KLF15-dependent transcriptome across multiple organs have demonstrated that KLF15 significantly impacts lipid, carbohydrate, and amino acid metabolic pathways in response to fluctuating nutrient challenges. The extent and manner in which KLF15 exerts its transcriptional effect through its occupancy at certain targets (i.e., the KLF15 cistrome), however, remains to be defined in skeletal muscle. Recently, a mouse model harboring a Klf15 “knock-in” allele containing a 3xFLAG epitope tag fused to the C-terminus of KLF15 has been developed and characterized, allowing for robust detection of endogenous KLF15 protein in vivo and ChIP-seq in the adult mouse liver (28Jiang Z. Elsarrag S.Z. Duan Q. LaGory E.L. Wang Z. Alexanian M. McMahon S. Rulifson I.C. Winchester S. Wang Y. Vaisse C. Brown J.D. Quattrocelli M. Lin C.Y. Haldar S.M. KLF15 cistromes reveal a hepatocyte pathway governing plasma corticosteroid transport and systemic inflammation.Sci. Adv. 2022; 8eabj2917Crossref Google Scholar). Using this mouse, we performed KLF15 ChIP-mentation, a technique that combines chromatin immunoprecipitation with tagmentation (sequencing library preparation by Tn5 transposase), in skeletal muscle tissue of healthy adult mice to define direct targets of KLF15. Nearly 5000 KLF15-binding sites were determined, with 7.31% located within gene promoter regions and 63.78% located in distal intergenic regions (Fig. 1A). Gene ontology analysis on proximal targets of KLF15 peaks revealed enrichment of similar pathways seen in previous transcriptomic investigations of muscle KLF15; that is, KLF15 demonstrates increased binding at genes related to circadian rhythmicity and lipid metabolism, the transcription of which are attenuated in the absence of KLF15 (Fig. 1, B and C) (11Jeyaraj D.

Invest. 2021; 131e139496Crossref Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Motif analysis of 200 bp upstream and downstream of KLF15-binding sites identified several motifs associated with critical metabolic transcription factors (i.e., PPARa, RXRb, FoxO3) (Fig. 1D). This colocalization of binding motifs suggested a possible cooperative role between KLF15 and other transcription factors that bind at these locations. Notably, the peroxisome proliferator response element (PPRE), which binds the PPAR family of NRs, was among one of the most highly enriched motifs found near KLF15-binding sites (Fig. 1D). Transcriptional activation occurs in the context of networks of transcription factors and coregulators that cooperate to respond to stimuli. To investigate how KLF15 might interact with other transcription factors within metabolic gene-regulatory networks, we chose to focus on the relationship between KLF15 and PPARδ. These factors share significant overlap in molecular function, are transcriptionally induced by similar physiological stimuli (e.g., fasting, exercise), and manifest similar phenotypes when targeted in mice (14Haldar S.M.

When considered alongside our finding that the PPRE is significantly enriched near KLF15-binding sites, these observations suggest that KLF15 and PPARδ interact and operate on similar transcriptional programs. Pathway analysis of the downregulated genes identified from RNA sequencing of K15-SKO muscle revealed significant enrichment for PPAR signaling pathway, peroxisome, and fatty acid metabolism (Fig. 2A). Importantly, Ppard mRNA expression is not affected in K15-SKO (Fig. 2B), suggesting that the presence of KLF15 may facilitate PPARδ-mediated transcription. PPARδ ChIP-seq corroborates these findings as significant overlap of PPARδ and KLF15 binding occurs in skeletal muscle. Indeed, of the 4238 PPARδ sites identified, 3263 (56.4%) were shared by KLF15 binding (Fig. 2, B and C). Motif analysis of 200 bp upstream and downstream of significantly enriched peaks in the PPARδ ChIP-seq revealed the presence of the PPRE consensus sequence, as well as the KLF motif (Fig. 2D), suggesting that PPAR NRs and KLFs bind in close proximity to one another and can coregulate gene transcription. We observed significant binding of both factors at a number of important metabolic genes (e.g., Acadl, Cd36, and Pdk4) (Fig. 2E), strengthening previous evidence of these factors as critical metabolic regulators. Furthermore, co-immunoprecipitation studies using heterologous expression of epitope-tagged constructs demonstrated that KLF15 and PPARδ can form a complex (Fig. 2F). Altogether, these findings indicate that KLF15 and PPARδ colocalize across the genome of adult skeletal muscle and suggest that both transcription factors may function in an interdependent manner to coregulate a critical subset of target genes. These observations prompted us to further investigate whether PPARδ localization and function were dependent on the presence of KLF15. We performed PPARδ ChIP-seq in K15-SKO muscle and found that 1178 PPARδ-binding sites (27.80% of all PPARδ binding sites) showed decreased PPARδ enrichment in the absence of KLF15 (Fig. 3A). PPARδ enrichment at 3060 PPARδ-binding sites remained unchanged. However, a comparison of binding intensity and degree of enrichment at all PPARδ-binding sites demonstrated an overall decrease in PPARδ binding in K15-SKO (Fig. 3B). Additionally, there was a change in PPARδ global distribution patterns in the absence of KLF15: PPARδ binding near transcription start sites was significantly decreased (Fig. 3C), and there was a shift away from promoter regions with a relative increased binding at distal intergenic regions (Fig. 3D). Interestingly, we observed decreased PPARδ binding at several important metabolic genes, especially those related to lipid metabolism (Fig. 3, E and F). These results demonstrate that KLF15 is required for PPARδ recruitment to specific genomic loci, suggesting that endogenous KLF15 coordinates PPARδ-mediated transcriptional responses. Because basal PPARδ localization appears to be dependent on KLF15, we sought to assess whether ligand-mediated agonism of PPARδ was similarly affected by the presence/absence of KLF15. To this end, we utilized the selective PPARδ agonist GW501516. GW501516 has been shown to impart a number of beneficial metabolic effects through its actions in increasing energy expenditure, inducing lipid metabolism genes, and increasing fatty acid oxidation (21Schuler M.

Treatment of C2C12 cells, a myoblast cell line, with GW501516 (100 nM) augmented the expression of PPARδ target genes Fatp1, Cpt1b, and Slc25a20. Following silencing of KLF15, the induction of these genes by GW501516 was significantly attenuated (Fig. 4, A and B). This effect was confirmed in vivo by gavaging MyoCre and K15-SKO mice with GW501516 for 10 days (5 mg/kg body weight per day) followed by tissue collection. qPCR analysis showed that GW501516-stimulated gene induction of the PPARδ targets Fatp1, Cpt1b, and Slc25a20 was attenuated in K15-SKO mice when compared to MyoCre controls (Fig. 4C). To assess whether KLF15 deficiency also affected PPARδ-dependent shifts in oxidative metabolism, we performed Seahorse profiling of cultured C2C12 cells in the setting of Klf15 silencing and GW501516 stimulation. Similar to our gene expression analyses discussed earlier in the study, Klf15 knockdown led to a decrease in basal palmitate oxidation and robustly inhibited the GW501516-stimulated augmentation of palmitate oxidation (Fig. 4D). Together, these data indicate that optimal PPARδ target gene induction and resultant increases in metabolic respiration are dependent on the presence of KLF15. Our findings provide new insights into KLF15 as a core component of systemic metabolism: through its own binding at target genes and through interactions with PPARδ, KLF15 reinforces transcription of critical metabolic programs in skeletal muscle (Fig. 5). To date, studies have largely focused on KLF15’s impact on the transcription of individual genes, with more recent studies surveying the KLF15 transcriptome; however, KLF15’s DNA binding pattern and genome-wide mechanisms of action in most tissues are still largely unknown. Here, using a recently developed mouse model with a “knock-in” allele that expresses a KLF15-3xFLAG fusion protein from the endogenous Klf15 locus, we were able to characterize the KLF15 cistrome in vivo in skeletal muscle and demonstrate that genes and pathways previously shown to be downregulated in the absence of KLF15 are generally bound by KLF15 (11Jeyaraj D.

A recent study using this mouse model in which KLF15 ChIP-seq was performed in the liver of adult mice showed that liver KLF15 predominantly exerts its actions through promoter binding and activation (32Jiang Z.

Adv. 2022; 8: eabj2917Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar); interestingly, in skeletal muscle, we find that the majority of KLF15 binding occurs in the distal intergenic regions, similar to that of KLF1 binding in erythroid cells (34Tallack M.R.

This suggests that skeletal muscle KLF15 may participate in mechanisms of action in addition to classic promoter-based gene induction. There is a growing appreciation that gene expression is regulated by coordination between gene-proximal and gene-distant chromatin elements, with multiple transcription factors working in concert to dynamically establish cell state–specific gene expression programs. While the current work highlights how gene-proximal KLF15 binds and regulates its direct targets, additional work exploring a role for KLF15 in long-range gene regulation will further our understanding of context-dependent transcription in metabolic processes. Due to the significant enrichment of PPREs near KLF15-binding sites and the similarities between the function of KLF15 and PPARδ in response to physiological cues, we turned to this family of NRs to illustrate KLF15’s potential action on proximally binding transcription factors. Our studies demonstrated that KLF15 and PPARδ colocalize on the skeletal muscle genome, can form a complex, and function in an interdependent manner to regulate lipid metabolism. In the absence of KLF15, PPARδ binding was lost near KLF15-binding sites, and PPARδ binding shifted away from promoter regions, suggesting that KLF15 helps recruit PPARδ to the correct transcriptional loci. However, given that KLF15 deficiency blunted downstream gene transcription rather than completely abolishing it, it is likely that other transcription factors or coactivators and corepressors act in tandem with the two under investigation here.

Through a receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, a serum sTNFR2 level of 1.608 ng/mL was adopted as the discriminator value for predicting renal outcomes (area under the curve 0.63, 95% confidence interval 0.57–0.70, p &lt; 0.001), yielding a sensitivity of 75.3% and a specificity of 51.2%. The association of sTNFR2 levels ≥1.608 ng/mL to renal outcomes was significant after adjusting for relevant variables (hazard ratio 2.27, 95% confidence interval 1.23–4.20, p = 0.009) and remained consistent across subgroups stratified by age, sex, systolic blood pressure, eGFR, albuminuria, and the use of renin-angiotensin system blockers. Conclusions Higher circulating levels of sTNFR2 are independently associated with an eGFR decline and progressive albuminuria in patients with type 2 diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W4223445676,"The SIRPα-CD47 axis plays an important role in T cell recruitment to sites of immune reaction and inflammation but its role in T cell antigen priming is incompletely understood. Employing OTII TCR transgenic mice bred to Cd47-/- (Cd47KO) or SKI mice, a knock-in transgenic animal expressing non-signaling cytoplasmic-truncated SIRPα, we investigated how the SIRPα-CD47 axis contributes to antigen priming. Here we show that adoptive transfer of Cd47KO or SKI Ova-specific CD4+ T cells (OTII) into Cd47KO and SKI recipients, followed by Ova immunization, elicited reduced T cell division and proliferation indices, increased apoptosis, and reduced expansion compared to transfer into WT mice. We confirmed prior reports that splenic T cell zone, CD4+ conventional dendritic cells (cDCs) and CD4+ T cell numbers were reduced in Cd47KO and SKI mice. We report that in vitro derived DCs from Cd47KO and SKI mice exhibited impaired migration in vivo and exhibited reduced CD11c+ DC proximity to OTII T cells in T cell zones after Ag immunization, which correlates with reduced TCR activation in transferred OTII T cells. These findings suggest that reduced numbers of CD4+ cDCs and their impaired migration contributes to reduced T cell-DC proximity in splenic T cell zone and reduced T cell TCR activation, cell division and proliferation, and indirectly increased T cell apoptosis."
https://openalex.org/W4223476849,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) affects the quality of life as it causes; memory loss, difficulty in thinking, learning, and performing familiar tasks. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) has been widely used to investigate and analyze different brain regions for AD identification. This study investigates the effectiveness of using correlated transfer function (CorrTF) as a new biomarker to extract the essential features from rs-fMRI, along with support vector machine (SVM) ordered hierarchically, in order to distinguish between the different AD stages. Additionally, we explored the regions, showing significant changes based on the CorrTF extracted features' strength among different AD stages. First, the process was initialized by applying the preprocessing on rs-fMRI data samples to reduce noise and retain the essential information. Then, the automated anatomical labeling (AAL) atlas was employed to divide the brain into 116 regions, where the intensity time series was calculated, and the CorrTF features were extracted for each region. The proposed framework employed the SVM classifier in two different methodologies, hierarchical and flat multi-classification schemes, to differentiate between the different AD stages for early detection purposes. The ADNI rs-fMRI dataset, employed in this study, consists of 167, 102, 129, and 114 normal, early, late mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and AD subjects, respectively. The proposed schemes achieved an average accuracy of 98.2% and 95.5% for hierarchical and flat multi-classification tasks, respectively, calculated using ten folds cross-validation. Therefore, CorrTF is considered a promising biomarker for AD early-stage identification. Moreover, the significant changes in the strengths of CorrTF connections among the different AD stages can help us identify and explore the affected brain regions and their latent associations during the progression of AD."
https://openalex.org/W4223521357,"Progression of virtually all forms of chronic kidney disease (CKD) is associated with activation of pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic signaling pathways. Despite extensive research, progress in identifying therapeutic targets to arrest or slow progression of CKD has been limited by incomplete understanding of basic mechanisms underlying renal inflammation and fibrosis in CKD. Recent studies have identified Kruppel-like transcription factors that have been shown to play critical roles in renal development, homeostasis, and response to injury. Although KLF11 deficiency has been shown to increase collagen production in vitro and tissue fibrosis in other organs, no previous study has linked KLF11 to the development of CKD. We sought to test the hypothesis that KLF11 deficiency promotes CKD through upregulation of pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrogenic signaling pathways in murine unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO), a well-established model of renal fibrosis. We found that KLF11-deficiency exacerbates renal injury in the UUO model through activation of the TGF-β/SMAD signaling pathway and through activation of several pro-inflammatory chemokine signaling pathways. Based on these considerations, we conclude that agents increase KLF11 expression may provide novel therapeutic targets to slow the progression of CKD."

The current cross-sectional study provides midterm results on HIV testing and counseling activities through community outreaches and facility-based services. A total 255,329 HIV tests were performed: 198,451 (77.7%) during testing campaigns in the villages, 12,592 (4.9%) during special events outreach and 44,286 (17.4%) in the health facilities. Females represented 53.8% (23,809) among those tested in the health facilities, while males were the majority in the community (54.4%, 114,835). Over one third of tests (n = 104,605, 41%) were performed among first-time testers. The overall HIV positivity rate was 1.2%, ranging from 0.7% in the community to 3.8% in the health facilities and decreased over time. Using a multivariable analysis, a positive test result was associated with age ≥ 50 years (PR 1.22, 95% CI 1.11 to 1.34), with female gender (PR 1.61, 95% CI 1.50 to 1.73), being tested in health facilities (PR 5.00, 95% CI 4.65 to 5.36) and for the first time (PR 1.86, 95% CI 1.73 to 2.00). The estimated proportion of PLHIV who knew their status of the project area increased by 28.6% (from 35.7% to 64.3%) and 11.1% (from 57.7% to 68.8%) in the project areas of Shinyanga and Simiyu regions respectively. Reaching the first UNAIDS 90 target by the end of this project seems possible. Future strategies should focus on improving PITC coverage, implementing more targeted testing modalities, together with current universal community-based approach."
https://openalex.org/W4223603966,"The AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and AMPK-related kinase salt-inducible kinase 3 (SIK3) regulate many important biological processes ranging from metabolism to sleep. Liver kinase B1 is known to phosphorylate and activate both AMPK and SIK3, but the existence of other upstream kinases was unclear. In this study, we detected liver kinase B1-independent AMPK-related kinase phosphorylation activities in human embryonic kidney cells as well as in mouse brains. Biochemical purification of this phosphorylation activity uncovered mammalian sterile 20-like kinase 3 (MST3). We demonstrate that MST3 from human embryonic kidney cells could phosphorylate AMPK and SIK3 in vivo. In addition, recombinant MST3 expressed in and purified from Escherichia coli could directly phosphorylate AMPK and SIK3 in vitro. Moreover, four other members of the MST kinase family could also phosphorylate AMPK or SIK3. Our results have revealed new kinases able to phosphorylate and activate AMPK and SIK3."
https://openalex.org/W4223640858,"Most of Central European rocky scrub communities formed by Cotoneaster integerrimus, Juniperus communis and Amelanchier ovalis are included in the association Cotoneastro-Amelanchieretum (= Junipero-Cotoneasteretum). However, this leads to the creation of syntaxon whose internal diversity is so great that it seems necessary to examine validity of its existence in the current form. This diversity entails species composition, habitat requirements and geographical distribution. Therefore, we posed the following objectives: i) to investigate the variability of species composition of the rocky scrub; (ii) to determine if there are ecological differences between the communities distinguished by species variability; (iii) to determine the geographical ranges of individual syntaxa. Altogether we analyzed 387 phytosociological relevés from Central Europe. Vegetation types of rocky scrubs were identified using the unsupervised K-means algorithm and detrended correspondence analysis. Mean Ellenberg's indicator values were applied to identify the environmental gradients shaping the plant communities. Obtained results confirmed the validity of dividing this broadly defined syntaxon into six distinct vegetation units. In order to present the studied communities in a broader context, we included into our analyses other rocky scrub with the occurrence of Cotoneaster sp. and A. ovalis, which formed the remaining three clusters. The observed differences in species composition were further supported by significant differences in soil reaction, temperature and continentality between the syntaxa. Moreover, the distinguished communities differed among one another in geographical range. Our study provides a new typology of the selected type of natural rocky scrub vegetation in Central Europe which involves environmental aspects, hence better reflects community-habitat relationships. This study also indicates a need for further revision of the classification of other types of natural scrub communities. Such classification should be based on modern data analysis methods and should primarily focus on lower vegetation units at pan-European scale."
https://openalex.org/W4223648095,"Our understanding of interactions among intestinal helminths, gut microbiota and host is still in its infancy in fish. In this study, the effects of Schyzocotyle acheilognathi infection on the intestinal microbiota, growth and immune reactions of grass carp were explored under laboratory conditions. 16S rDNA amplification sequencing results showed that S. acheilognathi infection altered the composition of intestinal microbiota only at the genus level, with a significant increase in the relative abundance of Turicibacter and Ruminococcus (P < 0.05) and a significant decrease in the relative abundance of Gordonia, Mycobacterium and Pseudocanthomonas (P < 0.05). Schyzocotyle acheilognathi infection had no significant effect (P > 0.05) on the alpha diversity indices (including Chao1, ACE, Shannon, Simpson index) of intestinal microbiota in grass carp, but PERMANOVA analysis showed that microbial structure significantly (P < 0.01) differed between hindgut and foregut. PICRUST prediction showed that some metabolism-related pathways were significantly changed after S. acheilognathi infection. The relative abundance of Turicibacter was positively correlated with the fresh weight of tapeworm (foregut: r = 0.48, P = 0.044; hindgut: r = 0.63, P = 0.005). There was no significant difference in the body condition of grass carp between the S. acheilognathi infected group and the uninfected group (P > 0.05). Intestinal tissue section with HE staining showed that S. acheilognathi infection severely damaged the intestinal villi, causing serious degeneration, necrosis and shedding of intestinal epithelial cells. The real-time fluorescent quantitative PCR results showed that S. acheilognathi infection upregulated the mRNA expression of the immune-related genes: Gal1-L2, TGF-β1 and IgM."
https://openalex.org/W4223412181,"Oculocutaneous albinism type 1 (OCA1), resulting from pathogenic variants in the tyrosinase (TYR) gene, refers to a group of phenotypically heterogeneous autosomal recessive disorders characterized by a partial or a complete absence of pigment in the skin/hair and is also associated with common developmental eye defects. In this study, we identified two novel compound heterozygous TYR variants from a Chinese hypopigmentary patient by whole-exome sequencing. Specifically, the two variants were c.-89T>G, located at the core of the initiator E-box (Inr E-box) of the TYR promoter, and p.S16Y (c.47C>A), located within the signal sequence. We performed both in silico analysis and experimental validation and verified these mutations as OCA1 variants that caused either impaired or complete loss of function of TYR. Mechanistically, the Inr E-box variant dampened TYR binding to microphthalmia-associated transcription factor, a master transcriptional regulator of the melanocyte development, whereas the S16Y variant contributed to endoplasmic reticulum retention, a common and principal cause of impaired TYR activity. Interestingly, we found that the Inr E-box variant creates novel protospacer adjacent motif sites, recognized by nucleases SpCas9 and SaCas9-KKH, respectively, without compromising the functional TYR coding sequence. We further used allele-specific genomic editing by CRISPR activation to specifically target the variant promoter and successfully activated its downstream gene expression, which could lead to potential therapeutic benefits. In conclusion, this study expands the spectrum of TYR variants, especially those within the promoter and noncoding regions, which can facilitate genetic counseling and clinical diagnosis of OCA1."

However, adverse responses due to PPE use have been observed during the 2003 SARS pandemic. This study will highlight the different adverse reactions caused by face mask use, one of the essential components of PPE in the HCWs, and identify the factors associated with these problems.This cross-sectional survey was conducted between September and October 2021. 404 HCWs were selected by snowball sampling from four randomly selected healthcare facilities of Bangladesh. Trained volunteers collected data by face-to-face interview using a pretested structured questionnaire. Data were analyzed using STATA (v.16) and summarized using frequency and relative frequency. Later, the chi-square test was used to explore bivariate relationships, and the binary logistic regression model was fit to identify the predictors.The majority of the respondents were 26-36 years (70.30%), male (69.80%), and doctors (74.50%). 48.76% of the respondents had unfavorable skin responses beneath the face masks; female gender, physicians, professionals working more than 32 hours a week, wearing N95, and more than one mask were predictors of skin problem. 28.47% and 60.15% of all participants suffered from some form of oral and neurological problems, respectively.Face mask use sequelae, especially skin, oral and neurological problems, are prevalent among health care workers.

https://openalex.org/W4223542979,"We recently reported increased levels of urinary free-glycans in some cancer patients. Here, we focused on cancer related alterations in the levels of high molecular weight free-glycans. The rationale for this study was that branching, elongation, fucosylation and sialylation, which lead to increases in the molecular weight of glycans, are known to be up-regulated in cancer. Urine samples from patients with gastric cancer, pancreatic cancer, cholangiocarcinoma and colorectal cancer and normal controls were analyzed. The extracted free-glycans were fluorescently labeled with 2-aminopyridine and analyzed by multi-step liquid chromatography. Comparison of the glycan profiles revealed increased levels of glycans in some cancer patients. Structural analysis of the glycans was carried out by performing chromatography and mass spectrometry together with enzymatic or chemical treatments. To compare glycan levels between samples with high sensitivity and selectivity, simultaneous measurements by reversed-phase liquid chromatography-selected ion monitoring of mass spectrometry were also performed. As a result, three lactose-core glycans and 78 free- N -glycans (one phosphorylated oligomannose-type, four sialylated hybrid-type and 73 bi-, tri- and tetra-antennary complex-type structures) were identified. Among them, glycans with α1,3-fucosylation ((+/− sialyl) Lewis X), triply α2,6-sialylated tri-antennary structures and/or a (Man3)GlcNAc1-core displayed elevated levels in cancer patients. However, simple α2,3-sialylation and α1,6-core-fucosylation did not appear to contribute to the observed increase in the level of glycans. Interestingly, one tri-antennary free- N -glycan that showed remarkable elevation in some cancer patients contained a unique Glcβ1-4GlcNAc-core instead of the common GlcNAc2-core at the reducing end. This study provides further insights into free-glycans as potential tumor markers and their processing pathways in cancer."

In a clinical trial of patients with severe RA, CZP improved disease symptoms in approximately half of patients. However, variability in CZP efficacy remains a problem for clinicians, thus, the aim of this study was to identify genetic variants predictive of CZP response. We performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of 302 RA patients treated with CZP in the REALISTIC trial to identify common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with treatment response. Whole-exome sequencing was also performed for 74 CZP extreme responders and non-responders within the same population, as well as 1546 population controls. No common SNPs or rare functional variants were significantly associated with CZP response, though a non-significant enrichment in the RA-implicated KCNK5 gene was observed. Two SNPs near spondin-1 and semaphorin-4G approached genome-wide significance. The results of the current study did not provide an unambiguous predictor of CZP response."
https://openalex.org/W4223580243,"High dietary salt intake is recognized as a risk factor for several non-communicable diseases (NCDs), in particular cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), including heart attack and stroke. Accurate measurement of population level salt intake is essential for setting targeted goals and plans for salt reduction strategies. We used a spot urine sample to estimate the mean population salt intake in Nepal and evaluated the association of salt intake with excess weight, hypertension, raised blood sugar and hypercholesterolemia, and a number of socio-demographic characteristics.A population-based cross-sectional study was carried out from February to May 2019 using a WHO STEPwise approach to surveillance. Spot urine was collected from 4361 participants aged 15-69 years for the analysis of salt intake. We then used the INTERSALT equation to calculate population salt intake. Student's 't' test, one-way ANOVA and multivariable linear regression were used to assess the association between salt intake and a number of factors. Statistical significance was accepted at P < .05.The average (±SD) age of participants was 40 (14.1) years. Mean salt intake, derived from spot urine samples, was estimated to be 9.1g/d. A total of 70.8% of the population consumed more than the WHO's recommended amount of 5g salt per day, with almost one third of the population (29%) consuming more than 10g of salt per day. Higher salt intake was significantly associated with male gender (β for male = 0.98g; 95%CI:0.87,1.1) and younger age groups (β25-39 years = 0.08; 95%CI:-0.08,0.23) and higher BMI (β = 0.19; 95%CI:0.18,0.21). Participants who were hypertensive and had raised blood cholesterol consumed less salt than people who had normal blood pressure and cholesterol levels (P<0.001).Salt consumption in Nepal is high, with a total of 70.8% of the population having a mean salt intake >5g/d, well above the World Health Organization recommendation. High salt intake was found to be associated with sex, age group, education, province, BMI, and raised cholesterol level of participants These findings build a strong case for action to reduce salt consumption in Nepal in order to achieve the global target of 30% reduction in population salt intake by 2025."
https://openalex.org/W4223643824,"Although social media has highly facilitated people's daily communication and dissemination of information, it has unfortunately been an ideal hotbed for the breeding and dissemination of Internet rumors. Therefore, automatically monitoring rumor dissemination in the early stage is of great practical significance. However, the existing detection methods fail to take full advantage of the semantics of the microblog information propagation graph. To address this shortcoming, this study models the information transmission network of a microblog as a heterogeneous graph with a variety of semantic information and then constructs a Microblog-HAN, which is a graph-based rumor detection model, to capture and aggregate the semantic information using attention layers. Specifically, after the initial textual and visual features of posts are extracted, the node-level attention mechanism combines neighbors of the microblog nodes to generate three groups of node embeddings with specific semantics. Moreover, semantic-level attention fuses different semantics to obtain the final node embedding of the microblog, which is then used as a classifier's input. Finally, the classification results of whether the microblog is a rumor or not are obtained. The experimental results on two real-world microblog rumor datasets, Weibo2016 and Weibo2021, demonstrate that the proposed Microblog-HAN can detect microblog rumors with an accuracy of over 92%, demonstrating its superiority over the most existing methods in identifying rumors from the view of the whole information transmission graph."

The aim of the study was to determine the association between cardio-vascular risk (CVR) factors and depressive status in a population (55–75 years) with metabolic syndrome (MetS) from the PREDIMED-Plus trial. Methods and findings Participants were classified into three groups of CVR according to the Framingham-based REGICOR function: (1) low (LR), (2) medium (MR) or (3) high/very high (HR). The Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) was used to assess depressive symptoms at baseline and after 2 years. The association between CVR and depressive status at baseline (n = 6545), and their changes after 2 years (n = 4566) were evaluated through multivariable regression models (logistic and linear models). HR women showed higher odds of depressive status than LR [OR (95% CI) = 1.78 (1.26, 2.50)]. MR and HR participants with total cholesterol &lt;160 mg/mL showed higher odds of depression than LR [OR (95% CI) = 1.77 (1.13, 2.77) and 2.83 (1.25, 6.42) respectively)] but those with total cholesterol ≥280 mg/mL showed lower odds of depression than LR [OR (95% CI) = 0.26 (0.07, 0.98) and 0.23 (0.05, 0.95), respectively]. All participants decreased their BDI-II score after 2 years, being the decrease smaller in MR and HR diabetic compared to LR [adjusted mean±SE = -0.52±0.20, -0.41±0.27 and -1.25±0.31 respectively). MR and HR participants with total cholesterol between 240–279 mg/mL showed greater decreases in the BDI-II score compared to LR (adjusted mean±SE = -0.83±0.37, -0.77±0.64 and 0.97±0.52 respectively).

Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) is used to measure VOCs, but its application is limited by expert-driven data analysis that is time-consuming, subjective and may introduce errors. We propose a machine learning-based system to perform GC-MS data analysis that exploits deep learning pattern recognition ability to learn and automatically detect VOCs directly from raw data, thus bypassing expert-led processing. We evaluate this new approach on clinical samples and with four types of convolutional neural networks (CNNs): VGG16, VGG-like, densely connected and residual CNNs. The proposed machine learning methods showed to outperform the expert-led analysis by detecting a significantly higher number of VOCs in just a fraction of time while maintaining high specificity. These results suggest that the proposed novel approach can help the large-scale deployment of breath-based diagnosis by reducing time and cost, and increasing accuracy and consistency."
https://openalex.org/W3201530147,"Recent advances in cultural analytics and large-scale computational studies of art, literature and film often show that long-term change in the features of artistic works happens gradually. These findings suggest that conservative forces that shape creative domains might be underestimated. To this end, we provide the first large-scale formal evidence of the association between poetic meter and semantics in 18-19th century European literatures, using Czech, German and Russian collections with additional data from English poetry and early modern Dutch songs. Our study traces this association through a series of unsupervised classifications using the abstracted semantic features of poems that are inferred for individual texts with the aid of topic modeling. Topics alone enable recognition of the meters in each observed language, as may be seen from the same-meter samples clustering together (median Adjusted Rand Index between 0.48 and 1 across traditions). In addition, this study shows that the strength of the association between form and meaning tends to decrease over time. This may reflect a shift in aesthetic conventions between the 18th and 19th centuries as individual innovation was increasingly favored in literature. Despite this decline, it remains possible to recognize semantics of the meters from past or future, which suggests the continuity in meter-meaning relationships while also revealing the historical variability of conditions across languages. This paper argues that distinct metrical forms, which are often copied in a language over centuries, also maintain long-term semantic inertia in poetry. Our findings highlight the role of the formal features of cultural items in influencing the pace and shape of cultural evolution."

Although proteomic and genetic approaches have expanded the catalog of bacterial proteins regulated by proteolytic degradation, the amino acid composition which constitute protein-specific degrons have rarely been experimentally verified. Detailed analysis of bacterial degrons has been hampered by their extended nature and general lack of conservation across bacteria, either in sequence or functionality (16Langklotz S. Schakermann M.

Similarly, the associated proteases frequently do not exhibit a high degree of degron or protein-class conservation (19Knipfer N. Seth A. Roudiak S.G. Shrader T.E.

Degron sequences have been observed to vary considerably in the pathways targeted and also their length, composition, and location within a protein, indicating that our understanding of how protein degradation is regulated in bacteria is not complete. Examples illustrating bacterial degron diversity include an N-terminal 21 amino acid sequence containing a core region of hydrophobic residues surrounded by polar residues in the oxidative stress response regulator SoxS and, in contrast, a single histidine at the C terminus of the SOS response protein SulA required for targeting Lon-mediated turnover in Escherichia coli (22Ishii Y.

Cyanobacteria are Gram-negative bacteria that constitute the only bacterial phylum that perform oxygenic photosynthesis, thereby representing a valuable platform for autotrophic production of bioproducts (24Savakis P. Hellingwerf K.J. Engineering cyanobacteria for direct biofuel production from CO2.Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 2015; 33: 8-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 25Soo R.M. Hemp J. Parks D.H.

While evidence for N-degron–mediated degradation has been presented in cyanobacteria (26Jin H. Kim R. Bhaya D. Deciphering proteolysis pathways for the error-prone DNA polymerase in Cyanobacteria.Environ. Microbiol. 2021; 23: 559-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar, 27Tryggvesson A. Ståhlberg F.M.

Characterization of ClpS2, an essential adaptor protein for the cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus.FEBS Lett. 2015; 589: 4039-4046Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), only three examples of sequence-specific degron-mediated proteolytic degradation have been reported. UmuD possesses a dual N-terminal degron consisting of an extended 19 amino acid sequence that targets proteolytic degradation by both N-degron and ClpX/P-associated pathways in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 (hereafter Synechocystis) (26Jin H. Kim R. Bhaya D. Deciphering proteolysis pathways for the error-prone DNA polymerase in Cyanobacteria.Environ. Microbiol. 2021; 23: 559-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). Second, the proteolytic adaptor NblA targets components of the light-harvesting phycobilisome complex during nitrogen starvation (28Karradt A. Sobanski J. Mattow J. Lockau W. Baier K. NblA, a key protein of phycobilisome degradation, interacts with ClpC, a HSP100 chaperone partner of a cyanobacterial Clp protease.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 32394-32403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Recently, the Synechococcus elongatus UTEX 2973 NblA was shown to bind a degron (F-D-A-F-T) at the N terminus of β-phycocyanin to initiate degradation (29Nguyen A.Y. Bricker W.P. Zhang H. Weisz D.A. Gross M.L. Pakrasi H.B. The proteolysis adaptor, NblA, binds to the N-terminus of β-phycocyanin: Implications for the mechanism of phycobilisome degradation.Photosynth. Res. 2017; 132: 95-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Finally, a C-terminal motif conserved in bacterial aldehyde decarbonylases, RMSAYGLAAA, governs degradation of Prochlorococcus marinus aldehyde decarbonylase in response to environmental stress (30Khusnutdinova A.N. Correia K. Diep P. Batyrovaa K.A. Nemr K. Flick R. Stogios P. Yakunin A.F. Mahadevan R. A novel C-terminal degron identified in bacterial aldehyde decarbonylases using directed evolution.Biotechnol. Biofuels. 2020; 13: 114Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). It can be deduced that degron-mediated proteolytic degradation likely plays a significantly expanded role in cyanobacteria, since they encode multiple protease duplications with nonoverlapping and essential physiological functions (31Sokolenko A. Pojidaeva E. Zinchenko V. Panichkin V. Glaser V.M. Herrmann R.G. Shestakov S.V. The gene complement for proteolysis in the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 and Arabidopsis thaliana chloroplasts.Curr. Genet. 2002; 41: 291-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). However, these characteristics of the cyanobacterial proteolytic complement make it difficult to identify both degron sequences and the interacting proteases. Thus, identification of degron-regulation of posttranslational gene expression deserves further attention in cyanobacteria. Previously, we reported that enhanced protein stability contributed significantly to the constantly elevated abundance of the cyanobacterial RNA helicase redox (CrhR), the only DEAD (Asp-Glu-Ala-Asp)-box RNA helicase encoded in Synechocystis, observed at low temperature (32Rosana A.R.R. Chamot D. Owttrim G.W. Autoregulation of RNA helicase expression in response to temperature stress in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803.PLoS One. 2012; 7e48683Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). In response to the permissive abiotic stress, cold shock at 20 °C, crhR mRNA rapidly and transiently accumulates resulting in a 15-fold enhancement in CrhR protein abundance. Furthermore, CrhR continues to remain elevated at low temperature, despite the absence of crhR transcript, resulting from a significant increase in CrhR protein half-life. Repression of the low temperature induction was initiated by a temperature upshift to 30 °C resulting in conditional destabilization of CrhR and rapid degradation, leading to the basal levels observed at higher, nonpermissive temperatures (33Tarassova O.S. Chamot D. Owttrim G.W. Conditional, temperature-induced proteolytic regulation of cyanobacterial RNA helicase expression.J. Bacteriol. 2014; 196: 1560-1568Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). This study also showed that a truncated, biochemically inactive mutant of CrhR, CrhRTR, was resistant to degradation during temperature upshift, suggesting an autoregulatory mechanism. While the degradation mechanism was not investigated further, the data suggested that either a targeting sequence necessary for proteolytic degradation had been deleted in CrhRTR and/or that CrhR RNA helicase activity was a requirement to activate the proteolysis machinery. Physiologically, although initial transcript and proteomic analysis of WT, crhRTR, and ΔcrhR strains of Synechocystis have implicated CrhR in gene expression vital for supporting phototrophic metabolism, particularly at low temperatures, it remains unclear how dynamic regulation of CrhR at the posttranslational level is achieved or ultimately why it is necessary. The biochemical, genetic, and evolutionary principles governing control of CrhR abundance by the cell are therefore of prime interest in contextualizing RNA helicases within stress biology programming (34Rowland J.G. Simon W.J. Prakash J.S.S. Slabas A.R. Proteomics reveals a role for the RNA helicase crhR in the modulation of multiple metabolic pathways during cold acclimation of Synechocystis sp. PCC6803.J.

Hess W.R. The temperature-regulated DEAD-box RNA helicase CrhR interactome: Autoregulation and photosynthesis-related transcripts.J. Exp. Bot. 2021; 72: 7564-7579Google Scholar). Here, we utilized an in vivo strategy to systematically identify a degron within the unique C-terminal extension (CTE) of CrhR that is essential for temperature upshift-mediated proteolytic degradation. Additionally, bioinformatics analysis indicated evolutionary conservation of the identified degron sequence in RNA helicases that are only encoded in the phylum Cyanobacteria. Proteolytic regulation of such “CrhR-type” RNA helicases may share a common mechanism and/or biological role, as they exhibited evolutionarily conserved temperature regulated induction and degradation kinetics in diverse cyanobacteria. Interestingly, although the CrhR degron sequence is necessary, it is not sufficient for proteolytic degradation as helicase function and de novo protein synthesis are also required. The results imply protease degradation of CrhR is autoregulatory through a positive feedback mechanism whereby CrhR enables translation of an unknown degradation factor(s). Induction and repression of proteolysis is also exquisitely sensitive to the magnitude of temperature shift, resulting in fine-tuning of CrhR abundance. Finally, mass photometry indicated CrhR exists as a dimer at 22 °C. AlphaFold 3D structural modeling predicted that the CTE is responsible for this dimerization behavior resulting in the degron being buried inside the interface, likely impeding recognition and degradation. Identification of this cyanobacterial-specific degron may provide a biotechnological tool to fine-tune posttranslational gene expression across multiple cyanobacterial genera. It was of interest to determine if CrhR-related proteins were temperature regulated in other cyanobacteria. Alignment of the CrhR amino acid sequence downstream of the conserved HRIGR box indicated the presence of an ∼50 amino acid sequence spanning amino acids K386–W435 that was highly conserved in 22 orthologous helicases (Fig. 1A). The strength of this cross-species conservation is illustrated by the sequence logo generated from this region using Multiple Em for Motif Elicitation (MEME) software (Fig. 1B), produced using the cyanobacterial species listed in Table S1. Similar cold-induced accumulation combined with temperature upshift repression of CrhR-related RNA helicases was demonstrated in four representative cyanobacterial species (Fig. 1C). Note that the temperature shift response observed for CrhR in WT cells shown in Figure 1C Synechocystis exhibits a linear pattern of degradation, as observed previously (32Rosana A.R.R. Chamot D. Owttrim G.W. Autoregulation of RNA helicase expression in response to temperature stress in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803.PLoS One. 2012; 7e48683Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The kinetics of temperature downshift induced changes in CrhR-related protein abundance are presented in Figure 1D. Importantly, CrhR-like proteins in the four cyanobacterial species tested responded in a similar manner to temperature shift, increasing at 20 °C or 10 °C and decreasing at 30 °C. While the timelines and induction temperatures differed slightly between the four strains, the kinetics of induction and repression were consistent. The results suggest that an evolutionarily conserved, temperature responsive degradation motif is located in the CTE of CrhR-like cyanobacterial RNA helicases. DEAD-box RNA helicases share a number of conserved motifs, including the characteristic DEAD motif, which comprise the highly conserved RNA helicase core (37Linder P. Jankowsky E. From unwinding to clamping - the DEAD box RNA helicase family.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2011; 12: 505-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2A). N-terminal extension (NTE) and CTE provide specificity by facilitating protein–RNA and protein–protein interactions (38Redder P. Hausmann S. Khemici V. Yasrebi H. Linder P. Bacterial versatility requires DEAD-box RNA helicases.FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2015; 39: 392-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). To explore the possibility that a degron sequence within the CTE or NTE of CrhR is responsible for temperature upshift-mediated degradation, a series of deletions were generated in the crhR gene (Fig. 2B). Since deletion-induced alteration of protein folding could contribute to mutant polypeptide degradation or aggregation, we produced a diverse range of five N- or C-deletion constructions to examine. The most extensive C-terminal deletion, CrhRΔR228-Q492, corresponds to the CrhRTR mutation, which produces a truncated polypeptide that can be detected readily in purified membrane and soluble Synechocystis cell lysis fractions (39Rosana A.R. Whitford D.S. Fahlman R.P. Owttrim G.W. Cyanobacterial RNA helicase CrhR localizes to the thylakoid membrane region and cosediments with degradosome and polysome complexes in Synechocystis sp. strain PCC 6803.J. Bacteriol. 2016; 198: 2089-2099Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), implying that even gross removal of the CTE does not produce instability or insoluble precipitates. Examination of temperature upshift induced degradation of the protein products expressed from the five constructs in WT Synechocystis indicated that an amino acid sequence between E393 and K449 was required for proteolytic degradation of the mutant protein (Fig. 2, C–F). This domain is located within the highly conserved C-terminal region identified in Figure 1, A and B. Insightfully, the presence of mutant, nondegradable versions of CrhR did not affect degradation of WT CrhR nor did WT CrhR rescue degradation of mutated CrhR (Fig. 2, C–F). Again, a similar pattern of WT, genome-encoded CrhR degradation as shown in Figure 1C Synechocystis was observed, irrespective of the fate of the mutant form of CrhR present in each strain (Fig. 2, C–F). Overall, the results shown in Figure 2, C–F and Fig. S1 provide crucial insights since they indicated that WT, biochemically active CrhR is required to activate degradation, but only of polypeptides that contain the degron. In addition, they demonstrate that plasmid-encoded CrhR polypeptides containing the degron are actively degraded, indicating analysis of the fate of CrhR polypeptides expressed from plasmids provide valid observations. To better facilitate comparisons across strains or growth conditions, the linear nature of the decay curve for genome-encoded CrhR from Synechocystis (Fig. 1D) prompted us to assign linear degradation rates to all WT and mutant CrhR polypeptides. This analysis was performed by fitting linear regression models to abundance curves for either chromosomal expressed CrhR (Fig. S1A) or plasmid-encoded CrhR C-terminal deletions (Fig. S1B) in WT cells expressing functional CrhR. Linear regression models encompassing each time point from the entire 30 °C time courses during which degradation was occurring were found to closely correlate with abundance in all circumstances (Fig. S1A). Slopes of these regression lines, thus representing independent measurements of WT or mutant CrhR change in relative abundance over the entire time course, then enabled simultaneous visualization of pairwise comparisons in subsequent western analysis. Examination of these degradation rate results indicated that the rate of change of chromosomal, WT CrhR does not vary appreciably in the presence of the CrhR-deletion constructs (Fig. 2G WT CrhR and Fig. S1A). In contrast, while degradation of the CrhRΔK449-Q492 mutant matched WT CrhR, abundance changes of the CrhRΔE393-Q492, CrhRΔA347-Q492, and the CrhRΔR228-Q492 deletion polypeptides varied significantly from the WT rate, indicating the degron motif had been deleted in these constructs (Fig. 2G Deletion CrhR constructs and Fig. S1B). Overall, the data indicated that the CrhR degron motif is located between E393 and K449 (Figs. 2, C–G and S1). A series of short, internal deletions were constructed within the 50 amino acid conserved region within the C-terminal motif to further delineate the location of the degron. Deletions in this region included 26 amino acids from the N terminus of this domain, CrhRΔK386-S411, 24 amino acids from the C-terminal portion, CrhR ΔD412-W435, and the entire domain, CrhRΔK386-W435. As a control, temperature-dependent CrhR accumulation in WT cells revealed the expected low temperature induction and subsequent temperature upshift repression (Fig. 3A), as observed in Figure 1C Synechocystis. Expression of the deletion constructs in WT cells indicated that while CrhR accumulation was relatively normal from the CrhRΔK386-S411 construct (Fig. 3B), temperature regulation of the CrhR ΔD412-W435 (Fig. 3C) and CrhRΔK386-W435 (Fig. 3D) constructs was significantly diminished. Quantification of CrhR abundance changes in response to temperature upshift is provided in Figure 3E. As observed in Figures 1 and 2, C–F, the rate of change of genomic, WT CrhR did not vary appreciably in the presence of the fine CrhR-deletion constructs (Fig. 3E WT CrhR). In contrast, while degradation of the CrhRΔK386-S411 polypeptide did not differ from the plasmid-encoded CrhR, abundance change trends of the CrhRΔD412-W435 and CrhRΔK386-W435 deletion polypeptides were abnormal, and degradation was significantly impaired (Fig. 3E mutant CrhR). These results suggested unequal contributions of the two segments of the 50 amino acid motif to CrhR regulation and that the CrhRΔD412-W435 motif contains a sequence that, when absent, results in muted polypeptide turnover at 30 °C. Interestingly, the CrhR deletion mutants resistant to proteolytic degradation, CrhR ΔD412-W435 and CrhRΔK386-W435, unexpectedly limited cold-induced induction of genomic-encoded CrhR at 20 °C but had no effect on temperature upshift degradation (Fig. 3, B–D). While deletion mutant suppression of WT CrhR accumulation was observed at all time points, we selected the point of maximum induction, 3 h at 20 °C, to quantitate the relative accumulation of plasmid-encoded mutant CrhR polypeptides to the abundance of the genomic-encoded WT polypeptide (Fig. 3E Ratio plasmid:genomic CrhR). As the functionality of the degradation domain decreased from CrhRΔK386-S411 to CrhRΔD412-W435 and CrhRΔK386-W435, the ratio of mutant to WT CrhR increased significantly (Fig. 3E Ratio plasmid:genomic CrhR). Insightfully, this observation indicated that chromosomal CrhR abundance is proportionately reduced in response to the presence of increasing nondegradable CrhR. These results are the inverse of the stability seen for the respective mutations and suggested that the deletion polypeptides negatively feedback on WT, genome-encoded CrhR expression through an unknown mechanism. Overall, the results indicate that the primary degron motif was located between D412 and W435. These intriguing observations prompted further examination of temperature regulation of the internal deletion constructs in a complete crhR deletion mutant, ΔcrhR, to determine if proteolytic profiles differed in the absence of WT, genome-encoded RNA helicase activity. Similar to the pattern observed in Figure 1C Synechocystis, normal temperature-shift induction and repression were observed when the sole source of WT CrhR was expressed from a plasmid (Fig. 4A). In comparison to degradation observed in Figure 1C Synechocystis and Figure 2, C–F, for WT, genome-encoded CrhR, while essentially identical temperature regulation was observed for the CrhRΔK386-S411 mutant (Fig. 4B), both temperature downshift and upshift induction and repression of the system were absent in the CrhRΔD412-W435 (Fig. 4C) and CrhRΔK386-W435 (Fig. 4D) strains. Given the high degree of conservation and location within the essential C-terminal portion of the CrhR motif, a further deletion encompassing the region between Q417 and Q425 (CrhRΔQ417-Q425) was generated in an attempt to define a minimal degron. The importance of the Q417-Q425 region for the functional degron was emphasized by the partial loss of temp"

https://openalex.org/W4223488811,"Background Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events. HDL exerts various protective functions on the cardiovascular system including anti-inflammatory activity by suppressing adhesion molecules expression in inflammation-induced endothelial cells. This study was designed to search if the anti-inflammatory capacity of apolipoprotein B-depleted plasma (apoB-depleted plasma) is altered in NAFLD patients. Methods A total of 83 subjects including 42 NAFLD and 41 control subjects were included in this cross-sectional study. Anti-inflammatory function of HDL was determined as the ability of apoB-depleted plasma to inhibit tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α)-induced expression of adhesion molecules in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Results Incubation of inflammation-stimulated HUVECs with the NAFLD patients’ apo-B depleted plasma led to higher levels of expression of adhesion molecules compared to the control subjects’ plasma samples, reflecting an impaired anti-inflammatory capacity of apoB-depleted plasma in the NAFLD patients. Impaired anti-inflammatory capacity of apoB-depleted plasma was correlated with fatty liver and obesity indices. After adjustment with obesity indices, the association of anti-inflammatory capacity of apoB-depleted plasma with NAFLD remained significant. Conclusion Impaired anti-inflammatory activity of apoB-depleted plasma was independently associated with NAFLD."

https://openalex.org/W4223526412,"Propolis is a good source for flavonoids, however, their recovery is challenging, as it is a waxy material. This study investigated edible oils virgin coconut oil (VCO), corn oil (CO), and ghee (G) as co-extractants for the supercritical carbon dioxide (scCO2) extraction of flavonoids from the propolis. The extraction of flavonoids using 20% VCO as co-extractant with scCO2 (25 g/min) for 210 min at 150 bar and 50°C was found to be the most appropriate, yielding a total flavonoid content (TFC) of 11.7 mg/g and 25% TFC recovery. At a higher temperature (60°C) and pressure (250 bar and 350 bar), the propolis became softer and compressed causing the extractions to retrograde. The extraction curves correlated to the diffusion model with 1.6% (AARD). The matrix diffusivities increased from 4.7 × 10-11 m2/s (scCO2) to 6.9 × 10-11-21.4 × 10-11 m2/s upon the addition of edible oils. Thus, edible oils could be used with scCO2 to improve the flavonoid extraction from propolis."
https://openalex.org/W4223545098,"The neurodegenerative disease Friedreich’s ataxia arises from a deficiency of frataxin, a protein that promotes iron–sulfur cluster (ISC) assembly in mitochondria. Here, primarily using Mössbauer spectroscopy, we investigated the iron content of a yeast strain in which expression of yeast frataxin homolog 1 (Yfh1), oxygenation conditions, iron concentrations, and metabolic modes were varied. We found that aerobic fermenting Yfh1-depleted cells grew slowly and accumulated FeIII nanoparticles, unlike WT cells. Under hypoxic conditions, the same mutant cells grew at rates similar to WT cells, had similar iron content, and were dominated by FeII rather than FeIII nanoparticles. Furthermore, mitochondria from mutant hypoxic cells contained approximately the same levels of ISCs as WT cells, confirming that Yfh1 is not required for ISC assembly. These cells also did not accumulate excessive iron, indicating that iron accumulation into yfh1-deficient mitochondria is stimulated by O2. In addition, in aerobic WT cells, we found that vacuoles stored FeIII, whereas under hypoxic fermenting conditions, vacuolar iron was reduced to FeII. Under respiring conditions, vacuoles of Yfh1-deficient cells contained FeIII, and nanoparticles accumulated only under aerobic conditions. Taken together, these results informed a mathematical model of iron trafficking and regulation in cells that could semiquantitatively simulate the Yfh1-deficiency phenotype. Simulations suggested partially independent regulation in which cellular iron import is regulated by ISC activity in mitochondria, mitochondrial iron import is regulated by a mitochondrial FeII pool, and vacuolar iron import is regulated by cytosolic FeII and mitochondrial ISC activity.

Humans suffering from Friedreich’s ataxia are deficient in frataxin (1Cook A. Giunti P. Friedreich’s Ataxia: Clinical features, pathogenesis, and management.Br. Med. Bull. 2017; 124: 19-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). This protein binds a multiprotein complex in the mitochondrial matrix that catalyzes assembly of iron–sulfur clusters (ISCs) (2Tsai C.-L. Barondeau D.P. Human frataxin is an allosteric Switch that activates the Fe-S cluster biosynthetic complex.Biochemistry. 2010; 49: 9132-9139Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Yeast frataxin homolog 1 (Yfh1) in Saccharomyces cerevisiae acts similarly, which allows budding yeast to serve as a workhorse for probing the pathogenic mechanism of this disease. Frataxin binds cysteine desulfurase, a member of this complex, which stimulates the rate by which a sulfur atom is extracted from free cysteine and transferred to the scaffold. Once coordinated to iron and reduced by ferredoxin (Yah1), this sulfur becomes the bridging sulfide of a [Fe2S2]2+ cluster bound to the Isu1/2 scaffold proteins (3Pandey A. Gordon D.M. Pain J. Stemmler T.L. Dancis A. Pain D.

Δyfh1 yeast cells grown under aerobic conditions are deficient in mitochondrial ISCs and heme centers, as well as other phenotypic properties that are less easily interpreted (4Babcock M. deSilva D.

For example, Yfh1 protects cells against oxidative stress (8Martelli A. Puccio H. Dysregulation of cellular iron metabolism in Friedreich ataxia: From primary iron-sulfur cluster deficit to mitochondrial iron accumulation.Front. Pharmacol. 2014; 5: 130Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Fermenting aerobic Δyfh1 yeast cells import excessive amounts of iron which flows into mitochondria and reacts to form FeIII nanoparticles (5Lesuisse E. Santos R. Matzanke B.F. Knight S.A.

Biophys. Acta. 2010; 1802: 531-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The iron concentration of mitochondria in which nanoparticles have accumulated is 10- to 15-fold higher than in the WT organelle (4Babcock M. deSilva D. Oaks R. Davis-Kaplan S. Jiralerspong S.

Low iron concentration and aconitase deficiency in a yeast frataxin homologue deficient strain.FEBS Lett. 1999; 456: 281-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). This accumulation indicates iron dysregulation. Fermenting Δyfh1 cells grow slowly relative to WT cells and are more easily damaged by O2 and other reactive oxygen species (ROS) (10Karthikeyan G. Lewis L.K. The mitochondrial protein frataxin prevents nuclear damage.Hum. Mol. Genet. 2002; 11: 1351-1362Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). How these properties are causally related at the molecular level remains incompletely understood. Understanding these relationships, the long-term goal of this study, may reveal better approaches for treating the disease. The model of Figure 1 describes our current understanding of these relationships, as supported by Mössbauer (MB)-based data presented here. First some background. In our study, IRON refers to 57FeIII citrate which we added to growth media (note: nutrients are capitalized). IRON is typically imported into the cell through the Fet3 transport system on the plasma membrane (11Hassett R.F. Romeo A.M. Kosman D.J.

Biol. 2002; 318: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). However, under hypoxic conditions, the Fet4 importer is used. Imported iron ultimately generates the cytosolic labile FeII pool (13Nguyen T.Q. Kim J.E. Brawley H.N. Lindahl P.A. Chromatographic detection of low-molecular-mass metal complexes in the cytosol of Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Metallomics. 2020; 12: 1094-1105Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) called FC in the model (note: model components are bold when introduced). Vacuoles are acidic organelles that reversibly store iron. Under iron-replete conditions, they import FC via the membrane-bound transporter Ccc1 (14Li L.T. Chen O.S. Ward D.M. Kaplan J. CCC1 is a transporter that mediates vacuolar iron storage in yeast.J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29515-29519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Imported FeII in vacuoles (F2 in the model) is rapidly oxidized to form FeIII polyphosphate complexes, F3 (15Mühlenhoff U. Hoffmann B. Richter N. Rietzschel N. Spantgar F. Stehling O.

Iron content of Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells grown under iron-deficient and iron-overload conditions.Biochemistry. 2013; 52: 105-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). F3 can be converted to vacuolar nanoparticles (VPs) (18Cockrell A.L. Holmes-Hampton G.P. McCormick S.P. Chakrabarti M. Lindahl P.A. Mössbauer and EPR study of iron in vacuoles from fermenting Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Biochemistry. 2011; 50: 10275-10283Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Some FC is converted into CIA, a model component representing all iron species in the cytosol, nucleus, and endoplasmic reticulum except for FC. CIA includes [Fe4S4]-containing proteins that are synthesized by the Cytosolic Iron–sulfur cluster Assembly system. Much FC is trafficked into mitochondria through two paralogous high-affinity FeII importers (Mrs3 and Mrs4) on the inner membrane (15Mühlenhoff U. Hoffmann B. Richter N. Rietzschel N. Spantgar F.

Yfh1 is presumed to be a catalyst for the FM → FS reaction; the same reaction is inhibited by mitochondrial component O2. Understanding the cell’s response to Yfh1 deficiency requires understanding how genes involved in iron homeostasis are regulated (indicated by the red circles and dashed lines in Fig. 1). The iron regulon includes a few dozen genes whose expression is controlled by Aft1 and Aft2 (20Ramos-Alonso L. Romero A.M. Martinez-Pastor M.T. Puig S. Iron regulatory mechanisms in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Front. Microbiol. 2020; 11: 582830Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 21Philpott C.C. Protchenko O.

Iron sensing and regulation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae: Ironing out the mechanistic details.Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2013; 16: 662-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). These paralogous transcription factors regulate (a) iron import into the cell; (b) iron import into mitochondria (23Courel M. Lallet S. Camadro J.M. Blaiseau P.L.

Biol. 2005; 25: 6760-6771Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar); and (c) iron export from vacuoles into the cytosol. Thus, iron export from vacuoles to cytosol is commonly thought to be regulated similar to the import of nutrient iron into cytosol (24Portnoy M.E. Jensen L.T. Culotta V.C. The distinct methods by which manganese and iron regulate the Nramp transporters in yeast.Biochem. J. 2002; 362: 119-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Other systems help regulate iron homeostasis in the cell. Besides Aft1/2, Fet4 expression is regulated by O2 (24Portnoy M.E. Jensen L.T. Culotta V.C. The distinct methods by which manganese and iron regulate the Nramp transporters in yeast.Biochem. J. 2002; 362: 119-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Under iron-replete conditions, vacuolar iron import through Ccc1 is positively regulated by Yap5, another iron-sensing transcription factor (25Li L.T. Bagley D. Ward D.A. Kaplan J. Yap5 is an iron-responsive transcriptional activator that regulates vacuolar iron storage in yeast.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2008; 28: 1326-1337Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), as well as by cellular stress factors. Under iron-starved conditions, Cth1 and Cth2 mediate degradation of Ccc1 mRNA (26Puig S.

One strategy for disentangling the confounding effects of O2 is to minimize its exposure to Δyfh1 cells (15Mühlenhoff U. Hoffmann B. Richter N. Rietzschel N. Spantgar F. Stehling O.

Hypoxic conditions are more useful than rigorously anaerobic ones because low concentrations of O2 are required for heme biosynthesis. Δyfh1 cells grow slowly under aerobic conditions but faster under hypoxic ones. When grown hypoxically on YPAD, ΔYfh1 cells exhibit no obvious phenotype (32Zhang Y. Lyver E.R. Knight S.A.B. Pain D. Lesuisse E. Dancis A. Mrs3p, Mrs4p, and frataxin provide iron for Fe-S cluster synthesis in mitochondria.J. Biol.

Lesuisse E. Oxidative stress and protease dysfunction in the yeast model of Friedreich ataxia.Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2007; 42: 1561-1570Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Aconitase is used as a reporter of ISC assembly activity because it requires an [Fe4S4] cluster for activity. Aerobic fermenting Δyfh1 cells lack aconitase activity, so the presence of ISCs in the same cells grown hypoxically suggests that Yfh1 is not required for ISC biosynthesis. Frataxin also minimizes oxidative stress. When anaerobic ΔYfh1 and WT cells are exposed to air, oxidative damage to Δyfh1 cells increases. However, ISC-containing ferredoxin is quite stable inside Δyfh1 mitochondria (32Zhang Y. Lyver E.R. Knight S.A.B. Pain D. Lesuisse E. Dancis A.

Chem. 2019; 294: 50-62Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) forms the core of the Figure 1 model. It assumes that the mitochondrial matrix of healthy WT cells grown under aerobic conditions is largely devoid of O2 due to respiratory activity on the inner membrane. In WT cells, the shield protects FM from reacting with O2. In the absence of Yfh1 or other proteins involved in ISC assembly or trafficking, the reaction FM → FS is slowed, which slows the rate of O2 reduction by the respiratory complexes. This allows more O2 to diffuse into the matrix region where it reacts with FM to form MP, thereby limiting the amount of FM available as a substrate for FS. This weakens the respiratory shield and initiates a vicious cycle in which the further decline of FM further slows the synthesis of FS and the rate of respiration. The lack of FS activates the iron regulon which increases iron import into the cell and mitochondria. The net effect is that mitochondria spiral down into a diseased state in which (a) the organelle is filled with nanoparticles; (b) both ISC and heme activities are low; and (c) O2 and ROS flood the cell. Similar accumulations of nanoparticles in mitochondria are observed for other genetic strains of yeast harboring defects in ISC biosynthesis or trafficking including cells deficient in Yah1 (31Miao R.

Acta. 2010; 1802: 531-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Even more surprising is that a similar phenotype is observed in strains with mutations that are not primarily involved in either ISC assembly or trafficking. This includes cells deficient in Mtm1 (38Park J. McCormick S.P. Chakrabarti M. Lindahl P.A. Insights into the iron-ome and manganese-ome of Δmtm1 Saccharomyces cerevisiae mitochondria.Metallomics. 2013; 5: 656-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) and cells in which the Aft1 transcription factor is constitutively upregulated (39Miao R. Holmes-Hampton G.P. Lindahl P.A. Biophysical investigation of the iron in aft1-1up and gal-YAH1.Saccharomyces Cerevisiae. Biochem. 2011; 50: 2660-2671Google Scholar). Thus, iron dysregulation appears to be a secondary response to defects in various mitochondrial processes including but not limited to ISC assembly, trafficking, and/or regulation. The respiratory shield hypothesis can explain these diverse causes, since the strength of the shield reflects processes such as respiration, bioenergetics, and mitochondrial membrane potential in which many proteins contribute. Mitochondria from Δyfh1 yeast cells (reportedly) do not accumulate excessive iron when they respire (40Foury F. Roganti T. Deletion of the mitochondrial carrier genes MRS3 and MRS4 suppresses mitochondrial iron accumulation in a yeast frataxin-deficient strain.J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24475-24483Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Moreover, aconitase activities in respiring Δyfh1 cells are ∼70% of WT levels, whereas they are near zero in aerobic fermenting Δyfh1 cells. Understanding these metabolic differences might reveal new insights into the mechanism of the disease. For this study, we primarily used MB spectroscopy to probe the relationships giving rise to the Yfh1-deficiency phenotype. We investigated a strain of yeast in which Yfh1 expression is dictated by the estradiol concentration in the growth medium (6Seguin A. Sutak R. Bulteau A.-L. Garcia-Serres R. Oddou J.L. Lefevre S. Santos R. Dancis A. Camadro J.M. Latour J.M. Lesuisse E. Evidence that yeast frataxin is not an iron storage protein in vivo.Biochim. Biophys.

Chem. 2011; 286: 6071-6079Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). This strain allowed us to probe the effects of gradually reducing the expression of Yfh1. We also examined the effects of O2, nutrient iron, and metabolic mode on cellular iron content. We evaluated the iron content of mitochondria from anaerobic fermenting and respiring Yfh1-deficient cells grown under hypoxic conditions. We then used those and other results to develop the model of Figure 1 and then used the model to simulate the Yfh1-deficient phenotype. Our results offer new insights into the pathogenesis of Friedreich’s ataxia. We employed the mutant strain ERyfh1 in this study because the expression level of yfh1 could be varied according to the concentration of estradiol [EST] added to the growth medium (6Seguin A.

As expected, Yfh1 was undetectable in a Western blot of soluble lysates from cells grown in the absence of EST ([EST] = 0), and expression increased as [EST] increased (Fig. 2). The [EST] required for full expression was higher than that reported by Seguin et al. (6Seguin A. Sutak R. Bulteau A.-L. Garcia-Serres R. Oddou J.L. Lefevre S. Santos R. Dancis A. Camadro J.M.

They reported that [EST] > 10 nM was sufficient to generate WT expression levels of Yfh1, whereas our samples required roughly 1000 nM [EST] to exhibit WT properties. We used a shorthand nomenclature to describe the growth conditions for various experiments. Aerobic fermenting wild-type (AFW) cells cultured in glucose-containing minimal medium (MM) grew in accordance with an exponential growth rate α ≈ 0.2 to 0.3 h−1 where α is the linear slope of ln(A600) versus time plots (Table S1). Aerobic fermenting mutant cells (AFM) grew at similar rates (α ≈ 0.2 h−1) at [EST] > ∼25 nM but slower at [EST] = 0. Supplementing media with FeIII citrate at concentrations between 1 → 100 μM had no effect on growth rate. WT cells cultured on 1 μM FeIII citrate grow at rates comparable to those of iron-replete WT cells (19Moore M.J. Wofford J.D. Dancis A. Lindahl P.A.

ATR inhibitors have been used in clinical trials in combination with radiation or chemotherapeutics; however, their effects against bladder cancer remain unclear. Here, the efficacy of combining gemcitabine with the novel ATR inhibitor AZD6738 was investigated in vitro in three bladder cancer cell lines (J82, T24, and UM-UC-3 cells). The effects of gemcitabine and AZD6738 on cell viability, clonogenicity, cell cycle, and apoptosis were examined. The combined use of gemcitabine and AZD6738 inhibited the viability and colony formation of bladder cancer cells compared to either treatment alone. Gemcitabine (5 nM) and AZD6738 (1 μM) inhibited cell cycle progression, causing cell accumulation in the S phase. Moreover, combined treatment enhanced cleaved poly[ADP-ribose]-polymerase expression alongside the number of annexin V-positive cells, indicating apoptosis induction. Mechanistic investigations showed that AZD6738 treatment inhibited the repair of gemcitabine-induced double-strand breaks by interfering with CHK1. Combining AZD6738 with gemcitabine could therefore be useful for bladder cancer therapy."
https://openalex.org/W4223434200,"This paper examines the effect of GPA on graduating students' wages using a data set from an elite university in China. Students are homogenous since their majors are closely related to economics and business The OLS regression results indicate that GPA has positive and significant impacts on wages on average. As GPA increases by 1 unit, the starting monthly wage increases by 29.6 percent on average, and the wage in the survey year that is 3-5 years after graduation (current wage) soars by 25 percent. Theoretically, the GPA matters for the wages due to both the human capital or signaling effect. Given that the signaling effect should diminish over time, and the effect on starting wage is a little larger than that on current wage, it is suggested that signaling effect of GPA should be trivial, and high GPA is associated with high wage should be mainly due to the human capital effect. These results are robust to different model specifications. The distributional analysis suggest that the effects are positive for both wages and significant for almost all quantiles. In addition, the effect is basically the same from the 0.05th to 0.80th quantiles, and then rises as the starting wage increases. The effect on current wage is a U shape from the 0.05th to 0.60th quantile, and then becomes an inverse-U shape with peaks at the 0.75th and 0.80th quantiles where the effect is 82.2 percent when GPA increases by one unit."
https://openalex.org/W4223507766,"There is rich literature on using continuous-time and discrete-time models for studying population dynamics of consumer-resource interactions. A key focus of this contribution is to systematically compare between the two modeling formalisms the stabilizing/destabilizing impacts of diverse ecological processes that result in a density-dependent consumer attack rate. Inspired by the Nicholson-Bailey/Lotka-Volterra models in discrete-time/continuous-time, respectively, we consider host-parasitoid interactions with an arbitrary parasitoid attack rate that is a function of both the host/parasitoid population densities. Our analysis shows that a Type II functional response is stabilizing in both modeling frameworks only when combined with other mechanisms, such as mutual interference between parasitoids. A Type III functional response is by itself stabilizing, but the extent of attack-rate acceleration needed is much higher in the discrete-time framework, and its stability regime expands with increasing host reproduction. Finally, our results show that while mutual parasitoid interference can stabilize population dynamics, cooperation between parasitoids to handle hosts is destabilizing in both frameworks. In summary, our comparative analysis systematically characterizes diverse ecological processes driving stable population dynamics in discrete-time and continuous-time consumer-resource models."
https://openalex.org/W4223618115,"Background Altered sense of smell is a commonly reported COVID-19 symptom. The performance of smell testing to identify SARS-CoV-2 infection status is unknown. We measured the ability of formal smell testing to identify SARS-CoV-2 infection and compared its performance with symptom screening. Methods A convenience sample of emergency department patients with COVID-19 symptom screening participated in smell testing using an eight odor Pocket Smell Test (PST). Participants received a SARS-CoV-2 viral PCR test after smell testing and completed a health conditions survey. Descriptive analysis and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve models compared the accuracy of smell testing versus symptom screening in identifying SARS-CoV-2 infection. Results Two hundred and ninety-five patients completed smell testing and 87 (29.5%) had a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test. Twenty-eight of the SARS-CoV-2 positive patients (32.2%) and 49 of the SARS-CoV-2 negative patients (23.6%) reported at least one of seven screening symptoms (OR = 1.54, P = 0.13). SARS-CoV-2 positive patients were more likely to have hyposmia (≤5 correctly identified odors) than SARS-CoV-2 negative patients (56.1% vs. 19.3%, OR = 5.36, P&lt;0.001). Hyposmia was 52.9% (95% CI 41.9%-63.7%) sensitive and 82.7% (95% CI 76.9%-87.6%) specific for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Presence of ≥1 screening symptom was 32.2% (95% CI 22.6%-43.1%) sensitive and 76.4% (70.1%-82.0%) specific for SARS-CoV-2 infection. The ROC curve for smell testing had an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.74 (95% CI 0.67–0.80). The ROC curve for symptom screening had lower discriminatory accuracy for SARS-CoV-2 infection (AUC = 0.55, 95% CI 0.49–0.61, P&lt;0.001) than the smell testing ROC curve. Conclusion Smell testing was superior to symptom screening for identifying SARS-CoV-2 infection in our study."
https://openalex.org/W4223897478,"In a previous study with LSL-LITE layers (-23 to 30-week-old), isoleucine at 0.72% and 0.84% produced values for FCR at 1.45 and 1.44, respectively and shared significance with 0.78% isoleucine (1.49). Considering that FCR is an important standard in the poultry industry due to the cost for adding feed ingredients such as synthetic amino acids and the low FCR of 1.45, 0.72% isoleucine was chosen for further study with LSL-LITE layers (n = 490 at 33- to 40-week-old) to determine effects on production and egg quality. The study included 7 diets (2730 Kcal kg metabolizable energy and constant isoleucine at 0.72%) containing varying quantities of valine [0.72 (Control), 0.75, 0.78, 0.81, 0.84, 0.87 or 0.90%] x 7 replicates x 10 hens/replicate. Significance at P ≤ 0.05 and P < 0.10 was determined. Level and week were significant for feed intake, egg production, and FCR; the interaction of level x week (L*W) was significant for feed intake and FCR. An isoleucine:valine of 1.233 corresponding to 0.72% isoleucine and 0.87% valine produced the lowest FCR of 1.30 (a 2.26% decrease compared to the Control at 1.33 ± 0.04). All measurements for external egg quality, except shape index and eggshell thickness, were significant for level. Week was significant for all parameters except shell thickness; L*W was significant for external quality measurements except shape index and shell thickness. Level, week, and L*W were significant for internal egg quality measurements. Serum protein and H1 titer were significant for level. Various production, egg quality, and biochemical measurements were significantly different from the control (0.72% isoleucine and 0.72% valine) at 0.81 to 0.87% valine. Findings of this study will aid researchers and commercial producers in narrowing the range of isoleucine, valine, and leucine needed for effects on particular parameters. Knowledge gained from this and others studies will eventually lead to an understanding of synergistic and antagonistic effects of branched chain amino acids in feed for various genetic types of layers throughout their productive lifetime."
