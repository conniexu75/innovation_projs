https://openalex.org/W2088486767,The rhizoplast of Platymonas subcordiformis is a contractile organelle. Cyclic contraction and extension are induced by incubating the organism in solutions containing calcium and adenosine triphosphate. Rhizoplast contraction is functionally linked to flagellar activity.
https://openalex.org/W2082500505,"Sarah, an adult ""language""-trained chimpanzee, made accurate same-different judgments on quantities of liquid and solid matter and conserved both types of quantity despite a transformation in an irrelevant property (shape). Control tests showed that she judged on the basis of inference rather than perceptual evaluation of the quantities. She failed to make accurate same-different judgments on the basis of number, and she was not tested for conservation of this type of quantity."
https://openalex.org/W2066135009,"All flints containing unstable impurities are susceptible to patination. The rate of patination varies with many factors: (i) the texture and microstructure of the flint; (ii) its permeability; (iii) the kind, proportion, and distribution of impurities; and (iv) environmental factors, such as temperature and soil chemistry. The thickness of the patina varies also with time."
https://openalex.org/W2021852193,"The homosporous fern Ceratopteris thalictroides (Parkeriaceae) has evolved a polyploid genetic system that serves to store and release genetic variability in spite of self-fertilization and Mendelian homozygosity. This is demonstrated by the segregation of a gametophyte mutant within two inbred tetraploid lines and in their intraspecific hybrid. The segregation behavior can be explained by a model involving a duplicated locus and regular homoeologous chromosome pairing. Homoeologous pairing occurs at low levels in the inbred lines and at a high level in the hybrid, indicating intraspecific differences in chromosome pairing affinities."

Within 3 days the ring and stream joined to form a sharp S-shaped meander. Shipboard expendable temperature probes and four bottom-moored inverted echo sounders were used to obtain synoptic descriptions of the rejoining process."

https://openalex.org/W2153991986,"One-half of the 1978 Nobel Prize in
Physics is to be awarded to Peter L. Kapitsa,
director of the Institute for Physical
Problems, U.S.S.R. Academy of
Sciences, Moscow, for his basic inventions
and discoveries in the area of low-temperature
physics. A review of the
record shows Kapitsa to be not only a
very competent scientist, but also a talented
engineer and a successful technical
manager. As his career has, on occasion,
become embroiled in Russian politics
and the continuing struggle between the
individual and the state in the Soviet
Union, he enjoys considerable world renown
beyond the narrow confines of
the physics community. In the popular
press, in fact, he has come to be somewhat
lionized as a leading scientist who
defied Stalin and yet survived to continue
as an important scientific contributor.
Kapitsa endured harrowing experiences
in arriving at the condition of octogenarian
in his Mother Russia, but he was also
given many honors by successive regimes
therein. With all these facts taken
together, Kapitsa is a figure who looms
large on the world stage, and it is presumably
with this combination in mind
that the Nobel Committee made its selection,
40 years after his most significant
contributions to low-temperature
physics."

These observations provide the most direct means of studying the largest transfer of energy occurring in astrophysical processes: the dynamic effects of the energetic charged cosmic-ray particles, element synthesis, and particle acceleration. Gammaray astronomical observations also find important application in studies of the development of the planets from the primitive solar nebula and of the nature of high-energy processes in the sun's atmosphere and their relation to the basic problems of solar activity."

The system is activated by alpha-keto-glutarate, L-ascorbic acid, glutathione, and pyridoxal phosphate. Folic acid markedly inhibits the reaction."
