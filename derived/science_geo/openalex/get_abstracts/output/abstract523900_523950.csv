https://openalex.org/W2013073809,"Squeezing out efficient thermoelectrics Thermoelectric materials hold the promise of converting waste heat into electricity. The challenge is to develop high-efficiency materials that are not too expensive. Kim et al. suggest a pathway for developing inexpensive thermoelectrics. They show a dramatic improvement of efficiency in bismuth telluride samples by quickly squeezing out excess liquid during compaction. This method introduces grain boundary dislocations in a way that avoids degrading electrical conductivity, which makes a better thermoelectric material. With the potential for scale-up and application to cheaper materials, this discovery presents an attractive path forward for thermoelectrics. Science , this issue p. 109"

Liver cancer stem cells (CSCs) may well contribute to both of these pathological properties, but the mechanisms underlying their self-renewal and maintenance are poorly understood. Here, using transcriptome microarray analysis, we identified a long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) termed lncTCF7 that is highly expressed in HCC tumors and liver CSCs. LncTCF7 is required for liver CSC self-renewal and tumor propagation. Mechanistically, lncTCF7 recruits the SWI/SNF complex to the promoter of TCF7 to regulate its expression, leading to activation of Wnt signaling. Our data suggest that lncTCF7-mediated Wnt signaling primes liver CSC self-renewal and tumor propagation. In sum, therefore, we have identified an lncRNA-based Wnt signaling regulatory circuit that promotes tumorigenic activity in liver cancer stem cells, highlighting the role that lncRNAs can play in tumor growth and propagation."

Mitochondria retain a few genes involved in oxidative phosphorylation. To translate these genes, mitochondria contain highly divergent mitochondrial ribosomes, or mitoribosomes. Amunts et al. determined the high-resolution structures of complete mammalian mitoribosomes using cryoelectron microscopy. Mitoribosomes include an unusual mRNA binding channel. The findings elucidate how aminoglycoside antibiotics can inadvertently inhibit mitoribosomes and how mutations in mitoribosomes can lead to disease. Science , this issue p. 95"

Schmiedel et al. used single-cell reporter experiments and mathematical modeling to show that miRNAs can reduce not just expression but the expression variability of target genes (see the Perspective by Hoffman and Pilpel). Combinatorial targeting principles ensured reduced variability for most miRNA gene targets. Thus, miRNAs may provide safeguards for the precision of gene expression during development or cellular homeostasis. Science , this issue p. 128 ; see also p. 41"

Stahl and Feigenson studied how babies reacted when objects behaved in surprising ways (see the Perspective by Schulz). Babies who saw apparently solid and weighty objects moving through a wall or past the edge of a table without falling looked intently at them. When given the opportunity to explore these peculiar objects, they did so by banging them on the floor—as if to test their solidity—or dropping them—as if to test their weightiness.

Although the requirement for Hedgehog in BCC is well established, the identity of disease-initiating cells and the compartments in which they reside remain controversial. By using several inducible Cre drivers to delete Ptch1 in different cell compartments in mice, we show here that multiple hair follicle stem cell populations readily develop BCC-like tumors. In contrast, stem cells within the interfollicular epidermis do not efficiently form tumors. Notably, we observed that innervated Gli1-expressing progenitors within mechanosensory touch dome epithelia are highly tumorigenic. Sensory nerves activate Hedgehog signaling in normal touch domes, while denervation attenuates touch dome-derived tumors. Together, our studies identify varying tumor susceptibilities among different stem cell populations in the skin, highlight touch dome epithelia as ""hot spots"" for tumor formation, and implicate cutaneous nerves as mediators of tumorigenesis."

https://openalex.org/W2105077884,"Posttranslational histone modifications are believed to allow the epigenetic transmission of distinct chromatin states, independently of associated DNA sequences. Histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9) methylation is essential for heterochromatin formation; however, a demonstration of its epigenetic heritability is lacking. Fission yeast has a single H3K9 methyltransferase, Clr4, that directs all H3K9 methylation and heterochromatin. Using releasable tethered Clr4 reveals that an active process rapidly erases H3K9 methylation from tethering sites in wild-type cells. However, inactivation of the putative histone demethylase Epe1 allows H3K9 methylation and silent chromatin maintenance at the tethering site through many mitotic divisions, and transgenerationally through meiosis, after release of tethered Clr4. Thus, H3K9 methylation is a heritable epigenetic mark whose transmission is usually countered by its active removal, which prevents the unauthorized inheritance of heterochromatin."
https://openalex.org/W1991655646,"Embryonic development relies on the capacity of progenitor cells to appropriately respond to inductive cues, a cellular property known as developmental competence. Here, we report that epigenetic priming of enhancers signifies developmental competence during endodermal lineage diversification. Chromatin mapping during pancreatic and hepatic differentiation of human embryonic stem cells revealed the en masse acquisition of a poised chromatin state at enhancers specific to endoderm-derived cell lineages in gut tube intermediates. Experimentally, the acquisition of this poised enhancer state predicts the ability of endodermal intermediates to respond to inductive signals. Furthermore, these enhancers are first recognized by the pioneer transcription factors FOXA1 and FOXA2 when competence is acquired, while subsequent recruitment of lineage-inductive transcription factors, such as PDX1, leads to enhancer and target gene activation. Together, our results identify the acquisition of a poised chromatin state at enhancers as a mechanism by which progenitor cells acquire developmental competence."

However, if the magnetism is frustrated (for example, if the geometry of the crystal lattice gets in the way of minimizing the energy), the material may not reach an ordered state even at very low temperatures. Hirschberger et al. studied the excitations of such a system—the pyrochlore compound Tb 2 Ti 2 O 7 —using thermal transport measurements.

Large molecular permanent electric dipole moments are challenging to experimentally realize. Meeting this challenge has garnered significant interest because permanent electric dipole moments are important for understanding symmetry breaking in molecular physics, control of chemical reactions and realization of strongly correlated many-body quantum systems. These new hybrid class of `trilobite' molecules are predominated with degenerate Rydberg manifolds, making them difficult to produce with conventional optical association.

https://openalex.org/W1972811285,"Two laws aiming to provide a new legal framework to promote regenerative medicine, while ensuring the efficacy and safety of the treatments, came into effect in Japan on November 25, 2014. The scope of these laws is briefly described here. Two laws aiming to provide a new legal framework to promote regenerative medicine, while ensuring the efficacy and safety of the treatments, came into effect in Japan on November 25, 2014. The scope of these laws is briefly described here. Prior to 2014, there were no statute-based regulations in Japan providing oversight for regenerative medicine, including stem cell therapies, other than pharmaceutical regulations that covered cellular and tissue-based products. During this time, Japan was unable to safeguard against patients, including foreigners, seeking unproven stem cell therapy (so-called medical tourism), and as a result, some patients seeking treatment experienced severe and even life-threatening problems (Editorial, 2013Editorial Nature. 2013; 494: 5Google Scholar). On the other hand, regenerative medicine, including the use of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), is an important component of healthcare strategy in Japan, whose population has the one of the highest proportions of aged individuals in the world and is expected to increase. For these reasons, a new regulatory framework was required for regenerative medicine, and to meet this need, two laws known as the “The Act on the Safety of Regenerative Medicine” (http://www.hourei.mhlw.go.jp/cgi-bin/t_docframe2.cgi?MODE=hourei&DMODE=SEARCH&SMODE=NORMAL&KEYWORD=%8d%c4%90%b6%88%e3%97%c3%93%99&EFSNO=229&FILE=FIRST&POS=0&HITSU=306) and the “Pharmaceuticals, Medical Devices and Other Therapeutic Products Act” (http://www.hourei.mhlw.go.jp/cgi-bin/t_docframe.cgi?MODE=hourei&DMODE=CONTENTS&SMODE=NORMAL&KEYWORD=&EFSNO=638) came into effect on November 25, 2014. Here, we provide a description of the new regulations and approval process, and we discuss how the new regulations address deficiencies in the previous system. The Act on the Safety of Regenerative Medicine regulates medical professionals’ practices and clinical studies related to regenerative medicine, which had previously been under the jurisdiction of the Medical Practitioners’ Act and the Medical Care Act. The new Act sets out regulations not only for “regenerative medicine” to reconstruct or repair human structures and functions, but also for cell-based therapies such as cancer immunotherapy. Prior to the new regulations, clinical studies involving human stem cell therapies were conducted according to guidelines known as “the human stem cell clinical research guidelines,” which were not legally binding. However, the new Act sets out legal regulations not only for research, but also for the daily practice of cell therapy without approved regenerative medical products. Medical technologies that use items such as stromal vascular fraction (SVF), which have recently become an issue in the United States, will be regulated in Japan under the Act (Dolgin, 2014Dolgin E. Nat. Med. 2014; 20: 796-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). This law divides regenerative medicine into three categories, depending on the potential risks (Table 1). For example, the level of risk associated with medical treatment that uses SVF would be considered as either medium or low. Any plan to use regenerative medicine has to be submitted to the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (MHLW) regardless of which of the three risk categories the treatment falls into. Additionally, a medical institution that wishes to offer regenerative medicine must solicit opinions from a certified special committee or a certified committee for regenerative medicine about their regenerative medicine provision plan before they can submit the plan to the MHLW (Figure S1). These committees are considered as fulfilling the legally stipulated accreditation criteria by the MHLW. After obtaining the committee’s opinion, whether it recommends approval or not, the medical institution can submit their regenerative medicine provision plan, accompanied by the opinion of the committee, to the MHLW. Furthermore, after the initial submission is filed, the medical institution is obligated to report adverse events and annual details about the level of implementation, such as the name of the provided regenerative medicine, number of patients treated, and evaluation of the treatment, to the MHLW and the committee. The MHLW will periodically publish a summary based on these reports to assure transparency of medical institutions that provide regenerative medicine. The availability of this data is important, because the full picture of regenerative medicine (including cell therapy) activities, which have been performed without restriction to date, has been unclear; the real status of these therapies is expected to become apparent as a result of the Act. Although there have been suggestions that self-reporting is not enough, the Act will enable the MHLW to get a comprehensive picture of the regenerative medicine that is actually being practiced for the first time, and it is therefore an important step in securing the medical safety of the Japanese population.Table 1Classification of Regenerative Medical Technologies According to RiskCategoryExample of Cells Used for Regenerative MedicineExample of TreatmentsClass I (high risk)iPSCs, ESCs, cells into which a gene is introduced, xenogeneic cells, allogeneic cellstransplantation of retinal pigment epithelium cells derived from autologous iPSCs, ex vivo gene therapyClass II (medium risk)autologous somatic stem cellsautologous mesenchymal stem cell infusion therapy for liver cirrhosisClass III (low risk)autologous somatic cellscancer immunotherapyRegenerative medical technologies are divided into three classes depending on the potential risk to human health. Open table in a new tab Regenerative medical technologies are divided into three classes depending on the potential risk to human health. A high profile example of a study that would be affected by the new Act is the world’s first transplantation of retinal pigmentation epithelial cells developed from human iPSCs, which was performed as a clinical study by Dr. Takahashi’s group in September 2014 (Reardon and Cyranoski, 2014Reardon S. Cyranoski D. Nature. 2014; 513: 287-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Regenerative medicine studies using human iPSCs such as this will be placed in the high-risk medical technology category. Under the Act, studies falling into the highest risk category of the three classes require review at the national level. After submission of a provision plan to provide regenerative medicine that is classified as high-risk to the MHLW, the MHLW can postpone implementation of the proposed plan for a maximum of 90 days. According to the Act, the MHLW must review the appropriateness of the plan by consulting the Health Science Council within the 90-day period. The duration of the review is shorter than similar procedures in the previous system to ensure consistency in the review process under human stem cell clinical research guidelines. The Act on the Safety of Regenerative Medicine stipulates usage of GMP-type facilities/equipment and quality control requirements for cell processing facilities that manufacture cells for clinical study and medical treatment. These requirements are designed to ensure safety and are concerned with the facilities and equipment, as well as manufacturing and quality control. If processed cells are manufactured in a medical institution, notification to the MLHW is necessary, declaring that the cell processing facility complies with the aforementioned requirements. If processed cells are manufactured locally by an entity such as a company that is not part of a medical institution, the entity must obtain a manufacturing license from the MHLW, then receive an inspection by the Pharmaceuticals Medical Devices Agency (PMDA) to check adherence to the requirements. If processed cells are manufactured outside the country, the manufacturer is subject to the same requirements as local Japanese manufacturers. In short, the Act seeks to promote regenerative medicine by facilitating clinical studies, even those involving companies, while ensuring safety. After this phase of clinical studies, clinical trials are regulated by the Pharmaceuticals, Medical Devices and Other Therapeutic Products Act. The Pharmaceutical Affairs Law was revised and renamed the Pharmaceuticals, Medical Devices and Other Therapeutic Products Act (PMD Act). This Act provides the option of a new pathway to obtain conditional and time-limited approval for “regenerative medical products,” which takes into account the high degree of quality variability of cells in the products and therapies that fall under this classification (Figure 1) (Hara et al., 2014Hara A. Sato D. Sahara Y. Therapeutic Innovation & Regulatory Science. 2014; 48: 681-688Crossref Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The approval review process will adopt a 9-month target for regulatory review time (http://www.pmda.go.jp/files/000155330.pdf), following expansion of the PMDA (from 751 people to 1,065 people) (http://www.mhlw.go.jp/kouseiroudoushou/shokanhoujin/dokuritsu/shiryou02/dl/kyouka01.pdf). As a result, the review period for products under the PMD Act will be shorter than that of already approved products in Japan. However, to obtain conditional and time-limited approval, exploratory clinical trials are required to predict reasonable likelihood of clinical benefit (for example, by using a surrogate endpoint); this is consistent with the US Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA’s) accelerated approval scheme for serious or life-threatening illnesses (http://www.fda.gov/ForPatients/Approvals/Fast/ucm405447.htm). The European Agency is putting forward the concept of adaptive licensing as a flexible approach to product approval, which is prospectively planned, and where uncertainty is reduced through the collection of post-approval data on the medicine’s use in patients (Eichler et al., 2012Eichler H.G. Oye K. Baird L.G. Abadie E. Brown J. Drum C.L. Ferguson J. Garner S. Honig P. Hukkelhoven M. et al.Clin. Pharmacol. Ther. 2012; 91: 426-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar; http://www.ema.europa.eu/ema/index.jsp?curl=pages/regulation/general/general_content_000601.jsp). In The International Conference on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH) member regions, regulatory agencies have tried to respond to patient/medical needs by developing an early access scheme to new therapies, weighing the safety and efficacy of the products in relation to the product life cycle (Table S1). From this perspective, conditional and time-limited approval is quite in line with global regulatory trends to resolve unmet medical needs. Overseas enterprises may also participate in the new Japanese regulatory system. A confirmatory clinical study and followup patient safety measures, including restrictions on clinical institutions that may use the treatment, must follow the conditional and time-limited approval, in preparation for a further approval process within a maximum period of 7 years. In order to ensure that products with unconfirmed effectiveness do not remain on the market, the new regulation gives MHLW/PMDA a clear legal authority to withdraw approval during the second approval process. The scope of regenerative medical products is considered to be mainly products satisfying unmet medical needs (including orphan indications and serious or life-threatening illnesses), which may also require a surgical procedure in some cases. Because of these circumstances, conventional drug regulation may not necessarily be applicable and a more flexible approach to safety and efficacy evaluation is called for. The sponsor is also encouraged to engage in regulatory consultation, since the design of further clinical studies and how best to demonstrate effectiveness may depend on the individual product, in terms of the indicated use, population, and mode of action and medical environment. At the same time, the MHLW and PMDA will establish a public patient registry system to support more accurate studies on postmarketing safety and efficacy in patients treated with regenerative medical products (http://www.mhlw.go.jp/stf/shingi/0000050197.html). Regenerative medical products that are approved under the PMD Act will not be subject to the Act on the Safety of Regenerative Medicine (except for off-label use) insofar as they are being used within the conditions of their approval. The concrete reimbursement policy for the products granted conditional and time-limited approval is being worked out at the Central Social Insurance Medical Council, following the Council’s discussion in November 2014 to open the door to reimbursement and pricing for these products. These two laws represent an attempt by Japan to promptly deliver regenerative medicine to patients while ensuring the efficacy and safety of application of regenerative medicine.

Our study reveals that the concerted orientation of the stargazin C-tail and PSD-95 is a major determinant of synaptic strength. PSD-95 is a major organizer and the most abundant scaffolding protein of excitatory postsynaptic densities (PSDs) (Cheng et al., 2006Cheng D. Hoogenraad C.C. Rush J. Ramm E. Schlager M.A. Duong D.M.

PDZ domain proteins of synapses.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2004; 5: 771-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (1226) Google Scholar). PSD-95 is a member of the membrane-associated guanylate kinase (MAGUK) family, which shares three conserved class 1 PDZ domains and one SH3-GK (Src homology 3-guanylate kinase) module (Sheng and Sala, 2001Sheng M. Sala C. PDZ domains and the organization of supramolecular complexes.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 24: 1-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (1041) Google Scholar, Songyang et al., 1997Songyang Z. Fanning A.S.

Recognition of unique carboxyl-terminal motifs by distinct PDZ domains.Science. 1997; 275: 73-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (1219) Google Scholar). PSD-95 binds and recruits many key transmembrane proteins to the PSD, such as NMDA receptors (NMDARs); AMPA receptors (AMPARs) via binding to stargazin and other transmembrane AMPAR regulating proteins (TARPs); adhesion molecules such as Neuroligin1; several potassium channels (Kv1 and Kir 1-4); and critical neuromodulator receptors such as the β1-adrenergic receptors, the neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRc), and serotonin receptors (5-HT2A/2C Rc) (Feng and Zhang, 2009Feng W.

Biol. 2006; 2: e153Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). However, results from immuno-labeling EM and tomography in intact hippocampal neurons have indicated that PSD-95 is in an extended configuration and positioned into regular arrays of vertical filaments that contact both glutamate receptors and orthogonal horizontal elements layered deep inside the PSD in rat hippocampal spine synapses (Chen et al., 2008Chen X. Winters C. Azzam R. Li X. Galbraith J.A. Leapman R.D. Reese T.S. Organization of the core structure of the postsynaptic density.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Organization and dynamics of PDZ-domain-related supramodules in the postsynaptic density.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2009; 10: 87-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). This is fully consistent with the fact that PSD-95 is anchored in the membrane through two palmitoylation sites located at its extreme N terminus (Craven et al., 1999Craven S.E. El-Husseini A.E. Bredt D.S.

Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 159-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). How this perpendicular conformation might affect binding to its different partners and how this, in turn, might impact synaptic function remain unknown. An immediate implication of an orientation of PSD-95 perpendicular to the plasma membrane is that the C-tail of transmembrane partners might need to reach out into the cytoplasm in order to bind their target domains in PSD-95. The C-tail might need to extend at least 11 nanometers—i.e., the equivalent of 30 extended amino acids—from the plasma membrane, as this distance marks the location of the first PDZ domain on PSD-95 with respect to the palmitoylation site at its extreme N terminus, as seen by EM (Chen et al., 2011Chen X. Nelson C.D. Li X. Winters C.A. Azzam R. Sousa A.A. Leapman R.D. Gainer H. Sheng M. Reese T.S. PSD-95 is required to sustain the molecular organization of the postsynaptic density.J. Neurosci. 2011; 31: 6329-6338Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Besides these constrains, a PSD-95 perpendicular to the membrane might offer novel ways of regulating binding between PSD-95 and transmembrane proteins by modulation of the effective length of the respective intracellular domains. We explored this hypothesis using a well-characterized model: the interaction between PSD-95 and the transmembrane AMPAR auxiliary protein stargazin. Stargazin, also called γ-2, is the first identified member of a family of TARPs found to interact directly with AMPARs and regulate their function and trafficking properties (Chen et al., 2000Chen L.

These first two PDZ domains stand out as a functional supramodular ensemble in which the relative orientation of the two ligand-binding grooves favors accommodating multiple ligands originating from the same direction, as seen by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) (Long et al., 2003Long J.F.

Biol. 2011; 7: 81-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), and Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) with the full-length protein (McCann et al., 2011McCann J.J. Zheng L. Chiantia S.

It is interesting to note that, in an extended PSD-95 conformation, PDZ1 and 2 are the closest to the membrane and, therefore, might preferentially contribute to binding due to their proximity to the PDZ-binding motif of stargazin. Finally, the anchoring of TARP-containing AMPARs at the synapse likely involves multivalent PDZ-domain-mediated interactions (Fomina et al., 2011Fomina S. Howard T.D. Sleator O.K. Golovanova M. O’Ryan L. Leyland M.L. Grossmann J.G. Collins R.F. Prince S.M.

NMR studies of interactions between C-terminal tail of Kir2.1 channel and PDZ1,2 domains of PSD95.Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 5315-5322Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). This idea is consistent with the development of synthetic divalent ligands that were designed to replicate the multiplicity of stargazin C termini per AMPAR complex. These biomimetic divalent ligands could specifically and acutely disrupt the endogenous AMPAR-MAGUK interaction in cultured neurons in conditions where a single competing binding motif had no effect (Sainlos et al., 2011Sainlos M. Tigaret C. Poujol C. Olivier N.B. Bard L. Breillat C. Thiolon K. Choquet D. Imperiali B. Biomimetic divalent ligands for the acute disruption of synaptic AMPAR stabilization.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2011; 7: 81-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). About 100 amino acids upstream of the C-terminal PDZ-binding motif, the stargazin C-tail harbors a stretch of seven arginines interleaved by nine serines (RS domain) (Figure S1A), so that the overall charge of this domain is highly positive. Previous studies have shown that the RS domain is attached to the plasma membrane via electrostatic interactions with negatively charged phospholipids (Roberts et al., 2011Roberts M.F. Taylor D.W. Unger V.M. Two modes of interaction between the membrane-embedded TARP stargazin’s C-terminal domain and the bilayer visualized by electron crystallography.J. Struct.

TARP phosphorylation regulates synaptic AMPA receptors through lipid bilayers.Neuron. 2010; 66: 755-767Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). This membrane interaction may reduce what we called the “effective” length of the C-tail and thus further constrain binding by limiting the ability of stargazin PDZ-binding motif to sample efficiently the spine cytoplasm. Notably, it has been shown that the serine residues present in the RS domain can be phosphorylated in an activity-dependent manner by CaMKII and PKC (Tomita et al., 2005bTomita S. Stein V. Stocker T.J. Nicoll R.A. Bredt D.S. Bidirectional synaptic plasticity regulated by phosphorylation of stargazin-like TARPs.Neuron. 2005; 45: 269-277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar) so that the RS domain changes from highly positive to negative upon phosphorylation. More important, phosphorylation seems to disrupt the electrostatic interaction between the membrane and the stargazin C-tail (Sumioka et al., 2010Sumioka A. Yan D. Tomita S. TARP phosphorylation regulates synaptic AMPA receptors through lipid bilayers.Neuron. 2010; 66: 755-767Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Additionally, biochemical and functional studies have demonstrated that phosphorylation of the RS domain facilitates the interaction between stargazin and PSD-95 (Opazo et al., 2010Opazo P. Labrecque S. Tigaret C.M. Frouin A. Wiseman P.W. De Koninck P. Choquet D.

Bidirectional synaptic plasticity regulated by phosphorylation of stargazin-like TARPs.Neuron. 2005; 45: 269-277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Taken together, these findings raise the intriguing possibility that phosphorylation might regulate binding to PSD-95 simply by increasing the effective length of the stargazin C-tail, thus facilitating access to PDZ domains deeper in the spine cytoplasm. In this study, we took advantage of super-resolution imaging techniques, biophysical measurements, biochemistry, and electrophysiology to show that the effective length of the stargazin C-tail, rather than the one defined by the primary sequence, is the major factor controlling not only binding to PSD-95 but also the recruitment of AMPARs and, thus, the strength of synaptic transmission. In the first set of experiments, we developed a tool with nanoscale precision to specifically monitor changes in the relative distance between the stargazin PDZ-domain-binding motif and the plasma membrane. We designed a specific FRET pair between the plasma membrane marker R18 (octadecyl rhodamine B chloride) and stargazin::GFP (Figure 1A). We expressed stargazin::GFP267 (where GFP was positioned immediately after the putative membrane-bound RS region of the stargazin C-tail; Figure S1A) in cultured hippocampal neurons and stained neurons with R18 prior to imaging (Figure 1B). We then used fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) to estimate the degree of FRET by measuring the decrease in GFP lifetime (Yasuda, 2006Yasuda R. Imaging spatiotemporal dynamics of neuronal signaling using fluorescence resonance energy transfer and fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2006; 16: 551-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). We found a robust FRET signal between stargazin::GFP267 and R18 (Figure 1C). Notably, there was no FRET between soluble GFP and R18, arguing for a specific FRET signal in the vicinity of the plasma membrane. In order to examine whether the rest of the C-tail extended into the cytoplasm, we positioned GFP further down the C-tail (stargazin::GFP302) and measured its interaction with R18. As expected for a tail oriented perpendicular to the membrane, this construct displayed a weaker FRET signal, indicating that this region is statistically further away from the plasma membrane. We then positioned GFP even further down the C-tail (stargazin::GFP322) and found an even weaker FRET with R18, consistent with the idea that the C-tail is extending away from the plasma membrane, into the cytoplasm (Figure 1C). Thus, as opposed to the membrane attachment of the proximal region of the stargazin C-tail, the distal half carrying the PDZ-binding motif displays an extended conformation as might be needed if they are to reach the PDZ domains of an extended PSD-95. Recent biochemical and functional studies have demonstrated that the interaction between stargazin and PSD-95 can be regulated by phosphorylation of the serine stretch in the stargazin C-tail (Opazo et al., 2010Opazo P. Labrecque S. Tigaret C.M. Frouin A. Wiseman P.W. De Koninck P. Choquet D.

Bidirectional synaptic plasticity regulated by phosphorylation of stargazin-like TARPs.Neuron. 2005; 45: 269-277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Notably, phosphorylation seems to disrupt the electrostatic interaction between the membrane and the stargazin C-tail. This finding raises the intriguing possibility that phosphorylation might further extend the distal half of the stargazin C-tail into the cytoplasm, thus increasing its effective length in order to facilitate access to PDZ domains deeper in the cytoplasm of spines. In order to examine this hypothesis, we introduced phospho-mutations to the stargazin::GFP267 construct used earlier (Figure 1D). We mimicked stargazin phosphorylation by mutating the nine phosphorylated serine residues to aspartates (stargazin::GFP267 S9D) and measured the interaction of this construct with the plasma membrane. We found that these phospho-mimetic mutations extend the stargazin C-tail into the cytoplasm of spines as reflected by a decrease in FRET with R18 in the membrane (Figure 1D). We also confirmed that phospho-mutations also extended the C-tail of stargazin carrying the GFP further down the C-tail and thus better reflecting the behavior of the PDZ-domain-binding motif (stargazin::GFP302 S9D/R7A) (Figure S1B). To control that the increase in GFP lifetime was due to the distancing of the stargazin C-tail from the plasma membrane and not due to a nonspecific effect on the intrinsic properties of GFP (i.e., alterations in the dipole orientation), we designed a second FRET pair between stargazin::mCherry302 and the plasma membrane marker F18 (fluorescein octadecyl ester) as a FRET donor. Similarly, we found that the introduction of phospho-mimetic mutations distanced the cytoplasm tail of stargazin::mCherry away from the plasma membrane, as evidenced by the increase in F18 lifetime (Figures S1C and S1D). Together, these findings strongly suggest that phosphorylation further extends the distal half of the stargazin C-tail carrying the PDZ-domain-binding motif in order to facilitate access and binding to PDZ domains that would be located further away from the membrane, such as in a PSD-95 oriented perpendicularly to the plasma membrane. Since the proximal half of the stargazin C-tail is presumably bound to the membrane via a stretch of positively charged arginine residues, we examined whether mutating these residues was sufficient to extend the distal half into the cytoplasm. We found that substituting the seven arginine residues to uncharged alanines (stargazin::GFP267 R7A) was sufficient to extend the distal half of the C-tail into the cytoplasm (Figure 1D). In addition, the combined mutant stargazin::GFP267 S9D/R7A did not exhibit additive effects, suggesting that phosphorylation extends the stargazin C-tail into the cytoplasm solely by neutralizing the positively charged arginine residues. Next, we examined whether the stargazin C-tail can be extended after induction of CaMKII activity. Using the FRET pair between stargazin::GFP322 wild-type (WT) and R18 in cultured hippocampal neurons, we activated NMDARs via a chemically induced long-term potentiation (cLTP) protocol known to promote the CaMKII-dependent immobilization of AMPAR (Opazo et al., 2010Opazo P. Labrecque S. Tigaret C.M. Frouin A. Wiseman P.W. De Koninck P. Choquet D. CaMKII triggers the diffusional trapping of surface AMPARs through phosphorylation of stargazin.Neuron. 2010; 67: 239-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). We found that the cLTP protocol was sufficient to extend the stargazin C-tail away from the plasma membrane (Figure 1E). It is important to note that the cLTP-induced extension of the stargazin C-tail was mediated by direct phosphorylation of stargazin by CaMKII, as it was significantly reversed by the CaMKII inhibitor KN93 and was not observed when the stretch of nine serines in stargazin was substituted by non-phosphorylatable alanines (S9A). Although phosphorylation increases the extension of the stargazin C-tail away from the membrane, it remains unclear whether this phenomenon alone can account for the facilitated binding to PSD-95 that was previously observed in Sumioka et al., 2010Sumioka A. Yan D. Tomita S. TARP phosphorylation regulates synaptic AMPA receptors through lipid bilayers.Neuron. 2010; 66: 755-767Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar. It is also possible that phosphorylation might create binding sites to additional proteins that might ultimately stabilize the stargazin-PSD-95 complex. In order to discriminate between these possibilities, we first wanted to confirm that stargazin phosphorylation does, in fact, facilitate binding to PSD-95 as it has been previously reported (Sumioka et al., 2010Sumioka A. Yan D. Tomita S. TARP phosphorylation regulates synaptic AMPA receptors through lipid bilayers.Neuron. 2010; 66: 755-767Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). To that end, we co-expressed untagged PSD-95 with stargazin WT, stargazin S9D, or stargazin S9A in COS-7 cells and examined their relative interaction using pull-down assays. As previously observed, we found that PSD-95 preferentially pulled down the phospho-mimetic stargazin S9D. In addition, PSD-95 displayed a stronger interaction with stargazin WT than with the stargazin S9A (Figure 2A). As a control for our FRET experiments, we verified that PSD-95::GFP displayed the same behavior in pull-down assays as untagged PSD-95 (Figure S2A). To examine whether stargazin phosphorylation bi-directionally regulates binding to PSD-95 in living cells, we co-transfected stargazin::mCherry and PSD-95::GFP in COS-7 cells (Figure 2B), introduced phospho-mutations to the stargazin::mCherry C-tail (stargazin::mCherry S9A and S9D) (Tomita et al., 2005bTomita S. Stein V. Stocker T.J. Nicoll R.A. Bredt D.S. Bidirectional synaptic plasticity regulated by phosphorylation of stargazin-like TARPs.Neuron. 2005; 45: 269-277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar), and measured the degree of FRET through GFP lifetime (Sainlos et al., 2011Sainlos M. Tigaret C. Poujol C. Olivier N.B. Bard L. Breillat C. Thiolon K. Choquet D. Imperiali B. Biomimetic divalent ligands for the acute disruption of synaptic AMPAR stabilization.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2011; 7: 81-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Stargazin::mCherry S9D facilitated the interaction with PSD-95::GFP as reflected by the decrease in GFP lifetime (Figure 2B). Intriguingly, we found no difference between stargazin::mCherry WT and stargazin::mCherry S9A on binding PSD-95::GFP using our FRET assay (Figure 2B). It is possible that stargazin::mCherry WT might not be normally phosphorylated in COS-7 cells (and, therefore, behave similarly to stargazin S9A), either because of a lack of CaMKII activity or because the bulky size of the acceptor fluorophore mCherry might prevent CaMKII access. We believe the latter scenario is the most likely for two reasons. First, the pull-down assays described earlier using stargazin not tagged with fluorescent proteins showed a differential binding between stargazin WT and S9A, suggesting endogenous phosphorylation of stargazin WT RS domain in COS-7 cells. Second, we found that active CaMKII failed to facilitate binding between stargazin::mCherry WT and PSD-95::GFP using FRET (data not shown). However, CaMKII did facilitate the stargazin-PSD-95 interaction when stargazin WT was labeled with the small acceptor fluorophore ReAsH (molecular weight [MW], 0.58 kDa), using the TetraCysteine system instead of a bulkier fluorescent protein (Figure 2C). This CaMKII-induced increase in stargazin-PSD-95 interaction was absent when the nine ser"

Although a high prevalence of autistic-like traits/symptoms has been identified in the pediatric psychiatric population of normal intelligence, there are no reports from adult psychiatric population. This study examined whether there is a greater prevalence of autistic-like traits/symptoms in patients with adult-onset psychiatric disorders such as major depressive disorder (MDD), bipolar disorder, or schizophrenia, and whether such an association is independent of symptom severity. The subjects were 290 adults of normal intelligence between 25 and 59 years of age (MDD, n=125; bipolar disorder, n=56; schizophrenia, n=44; healthy controls, n=65). Autistic-like traits/symptoms were measured using the Social Responsiveness Scale for Adults. Symptom severity was measured using the Positive and Negative Symptoms Scale, the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, and/or the Young Mania Rating Scale. Almost half of the clinical subjects, except those with remitted MDD, exhibited autistic-like traits/symptoms at levels typical for sub-threshold or threshold autism spectrum disorder. Furthermore, the proportion of psychiatric patients that demonstrated high autistic-like traits/symptoms was significantly greater than that of healthy controls, and not different between that of remitted or unremitted subjects with bipolar disorder or schizophrenia. On the other hand, remitted subjects with MDD did not differ from healthy controls with regard to the prevalence or degree of high autistic-like traits/symptoms. A substantial proportion of adults with bipolar disorder and schizophrenia showed high autistic-like traits/symptoms independent of symptom severity, suggesting a shared pathophysiology among autism spectrum disorder and these psychiatric disorders. Conversely, autistic-like traits among subjects with MDD were associated with the depressive symptom severity. These findings suggest the importance of evaluating autistic-like traits/symptoms underlying adult-onset psychiatric disorders for the best-suited treatment.

https://openalex.org/W2025511804,"Hypertrophic scarring is a frequent fibroproliferative complication following deep dermal burns leading to impaired function and lifelong disfigurement. Decorin reduces fibrosis and induces regeneration in many tissues, and is significantly downregulated in hypertrophic scar and normal deep dermal fibroblasts. It was hypothesized that microRNAs in these fibroblasts downregulate decorin and blocking them would increase decorin and may prevent hypertrophic scarring. Lower decorin levels were found in hypertrophic scar as compared to normal skin, and in deep as compared to superficial dermis. A decorin 3’ un-translated region reporter assay demonstrated microRNA decreased decorin in deep dermal fibroblasts, and microRNA screening predicted miR- 24, 181b, 421, 526b, or 543 as candidates. After finding increased levels of mir-181b in deep dermal fibroblasts, it was demonstrated that TGF-β1 stimulation decreased miR-24 but increased miR-181b and that hypertrophic scar and deep dermis contained increased levels of miR-181b. By blocking miR-181b with an antagomiR, it was possible to increase decorin protein expression in dermal fibroblasts. This suggests miR-181b is involved in the differential expression of decorin in skin and wound healing. Furthermore, blocking miR-181b reversed TGF-β1 induced decorin downregulation and myofibroblast differentiation in hypertrophic scar fibroblasts, suggesting a potential therapy for hypertrophic scar."
https://openalex.org/W2087312505,"Intracellular thiols like L-cystine and L-cystine play a critical role in the regulation of cellular processes. Here we show that Escherichia coli has two L-cystine transporters, the symporter YdjN and the ATP-binding cassette importer FliY-YecSC. These proteins import L-cystine, an oxidized product of L-cystine from the periplasm to the cytoplasm. The symporter YdjN, which is expected to be a new member of the L-cystine regulon, is a low affinity L-cystine transporter (Km = 1.1 μM) that is mainly involved in L-cystine uptake from outside as a nutrient. E. coli has only two L-cystine importers because ΔydjNΔyecS mutant cells are not capable of growing in the minimal medium containing L-cystine as a sole sulfur source. Another protein YecSC is the FliY-dependent L-cystine transporter that functions cooperatively with the L-cystine transporter YdeD, which exports L-cystine as reducing equivalents from the cytoplasm to the periplasm, to prevent E. coli cells from oxidative stress. The exported L-cystine can reduce the periplasmic hydrogen peroxide to water, and then generated L-cystine is imported back into the cytoplasm via the ATP-binding cassette transporter YecSC with a high affinity to L-cystine (Km = 110 nM) in a manner dependent on FliY, the periplasmic L-cystine-binding protein. The double disruption of ydeD and fliY increased cellular levels of lipid peroxides. From these findings, we propose that the hydrogen peroxide-inducible L-cystine/L-cystine shuttle system plays a role of detoxification of hydrogen peroxide before lipid peroxidation occurs, and then might specific prevent damage to membrane lipids."

However, there is limited evidence on how researchers conceptualise engagement, their views on what constitutes engagement and the communities they would (or would not) like to engage with. This paper presents the results of a survey of researchers in the Open University that sought to gather data to fill these gaps. This research was part of an action research project designed to embed engagement in the routine practices of researchers at all levels. The findings indicate that researchers have a relatively narrow view of public engagement with research and the communities with which they interact. It also identified that very few strategically evaluate their public engagement activities. We conclude by discussing some of the interventions we have introduced with the aim of broadening and deepening future researcher engagement."

Many indicators exist, yet we do not have enough information about their relevance. The objective of this systematic review was (1) to identify all the indicators that could be used to measure the output and outcome of medical research carried out in institutions and (2) enlist their methodology, use, positive and negative points.We have searched 3 databases (Pubmed, Scopus, Web of Science) using the following keywords: [Research outcome* OR research output* OR bibliometric* OR scientometric* OR scientific production] AND [indicator* OR index* OR evaluation OR metrics]. We included articles presenting, discussing or evaluating indicators measuring the scientific production of an institution. The search was conducted by two independent authors using a standardised data extraction form. For each indicator we extracted its definition, calculation, its rationale and its positive and negative points. In order to reduce bias, data extraction and analysis was performed by two independent authors.We included 76 articles. A total of 57 indicators were identified. We have classified those indicators into 6 categories: 9 indicators of research activity, 24 indicators of scientific production and impact, 5 indicators of collaboration, 7 indicators of industrial production, 4 indicators of dissemination, 8 indicators of health service impact. The most widely discussed and described is the h-index with 31 articles discussing it.The majority of indicators found are bibliometric indicators of scientific production and impact. Several indicators have been developed to improve the h-index. This indicator has also inspired the creation of two indicators to measure industrial production and collaboration.

https://openalex.org/W2038841065,"Despite early detection through the use of mammograms and aggressive intervention, breast cancer (BC) remains a clinical dilemma. BC can resurge after >10 years of remission. Studies indicate that BC cells (BCCs) with self-renewal and chemoresistance could be involved in dormancy. The majority of studies use in vitro, two-dimensional (2-D) monolayer cultures, which do not recapitulate the in vivo microenvironment. Thus, to determine the effect of three-dimensional (3-D) microenvironment on BCCs, this study fabricated tissue engineering scaffolds made of poly (ε-caprolactone) (PCL) having aligned or random fibers. Random and aligned fibers mimic, respectively, the random and highly organized collagen fibers found in the tumor extracellular matrix. Chemoresistant BCCs were obtained by treating with carboplatin. Western blot analysis of carboplatin resistant (treated) MDA-MB-231 (highly invasive, basal-like) and T47D (low-invasive, luminal) BCCs showed an increase in Bcl-2, Oct-4 and Sox-2, suggesting protection from apoptosis and increase in stem-like markers. Further studies with MDA-MB-231 BCCs seeded on the scaffolds showed little to no change in cell number over time for non-treated BCCs whereas on tissue culture polystyrene (TCP), non-treated BCCs displayed a significant increase in cell number at days 4 and 7 as compared to day 1 (p<0.05). Treated BCCs did not proliferate on TCP and the fibrous scaffolds. Little to no cyclin D1 was expressed for non-treated BCCs on TCP. On fibrous scaffolds, non-treated BCCs stained for cyclin D1 during the 7-day culture period. Treated BCCs expressed cyclin D1 on TCP and fibrous scaffolds during the 7-day culture period. Proliferation, viability and cell cycle analysis indicated that this 3-D culture prompted the aggressive BCCs to adopt a dormant phenotype, while the treated BCCs retained their phenotype. The findings indicate that random and aligned fibrous PCL scaffolds may provide a useful system to study how the 3-D microenvironment affects the behavior of BCCs."
https://openalex.org/W2043780189,"Risk aversion and temporal discounting are preferences that are strongly linked to sub-optimal financial and health decision making ability. Prior studies have shown they differ by age and cognitive ability, but it remains unclear whether differences are due to age-related cognitive decline or lower cognitive abilities over the life span. We tested the hypothesis that cognitive decline is associated with higher risk aversion and temporal discounting in 455 older persons without dementia from the Memory and Aging Project, a longitudinal cohort study of aging in Chicago. All underwent repeated annual cognitive evaluations using a detailed battery including 19 tests. Risk aversion was measured using standard behavioral economics questions: participants were asked to choose between a certain monetary payment versus a gamble in which they could gain more or nothing; potential gamble gains varied across questions. Temporal discounting: participants were asked to choose between an immediate, smaller payment and a delayed, larger one; two sets of questions addressed small and large stakes based on payment amount. Regression analyses were used to examine whether prior rate of cognitive decline predicted level of risk aversion and temporal discounting, controlling for age, sex, and education. Over an average of 5.5 (SD=2.9) years, cognition declined at an average of 0.016 units per year (SD=0.03). More rapid cognitive decline predicted higher levels of risk aversion (p=0.002) and temporal discounting (small stakes: p=0.01, high stakes: p=0.006). Further, associations between cognitive decline and risk aversion (p=0.015) and large stakes temporal discounting (p=0.026) persisted in analyses restricted to persons without any cognitive impairment (i.e., no dementia or mild cognitive impairment); the association of cognitive decline and small stakes temporal discounting was no longer statistically significant (p=0.078). These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that subtle age-related changes in cognition can detrimentally affect individual preferences that are critical for maintaining health and well being."

https://openalex.org/W2147095172,"Background Understanding the patterns of HCV RNA levels during acute hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection provides insights into immunopathogenesis and is important for vaccine design. This study evaluated patterns of HCV RNA levels and associated factors among individuals with acute infection. Methods Data were from an international collaboration of nine prospective cohorts of acute HCV (InC3 Study). Participants with well-characterized acute HCV infection (detected within three months post-infection and interval between the peak and subsequent HCV RNA levels≤120 days) were categorised by a priori-defined patterns of HCV RNA levels: i) spontaneous clearance, ii) partial viral control with persistence (≥1 log IU/mL decline in HCV RNA levels following peak) and iii) viral plateau with persistence (increase or <1 log IU/mL decline in HCV RNA levels following peak). Factors associated with HCV RNA patterns were assessed using multinomial logistic regression. Results Among 643 individuals with acute HCV, 162 with well-characterized acute HCV were identified: spontaneous clearance (32%), partial viral control with persistence (27%), and viral plateau with persistence (41%). HCV RNA levels reached a high viraemic phase within two months following infection, with higher levels in the spontaneous clearance and partial viral control groups, compared to the viral plateau group (median: 6.0, 6.2, 5.3 log IU/mL, respectively; P=0.018). In the two groups with persistence, Interferon lambda 3 (IFNL3) CC genotype was independently associated with partial viral control compared to viral plateau (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]: 2.75; 95%CI: 1.08, 7.02). In the two groups with viral control, female sex was independently associated with spontaneous clearance compared to partial viral control (AOR: 2.86; 95%CI: 1.04, 7.83). Conclusions Among individuals with acute HCV, a spectrum of HCV RNA patterns is evident. IFNL3 CC genotype is associated with initial viral control, while female sex is associated with ultimate spontaneous clearance."
https://openalex.org/W2025140675,"HSV-2 vaccine is needed to prevent genital disease, latent infection, and virus transmission. A replication-deficient mutant virus (dl5-29) has demonstrated promising efficacy in animal models of genital herpes. However, the immunogenicity, protective efficacy, and non-replicative status of the highly purified clinical vaccine candidate (HSV529) derived from dl5-29 have not been evaluated. Humoral and cellular immune responses were measured in mice and guinea pigs immunized with HSV529. Protection against acute and recurrent genital herpes, mortality, latent infection, and viral shedding after vaginal HSV-2 infection was determined in mice or in naïve and HSV-1 seropositive guinea pigs. HSV529 replication and pathogenicity were investigated in three sensitive models of virus replication: severe combined immunodeficient (SCID/Beige) mice inoculated by the intramuscular route, suckling mice inoculated by the intracranial route, and vaginally-inoculated guinea pigs. HSV529 immunization induced HSV-2-neutralizing antibody production in mice and guinea pigs. In mice, it induced production of specific HSV-2 antibodies and splenocytes secreting IFNγ or IL-5. Immunization effectively prevented HSV-2 infection in all three animal models by reducing mortality, acute genital disease severity and frequency, and viral shedding. It also reduced ganglionic viral latency and recurrent disease in naïve and HSV-1 seropositive guinea pigs. HSV529 replication/propagation was not detected in the muscles of SCID/Beige mice, in the brains of suckling mice, or in vaginal secretions of inoculated guinea pigs. These results confirm the non-replicative status, as well as its immunogenicity and efficacy in mice and guinea pigs, including HSV-1 seropositive guinea pigs. In mice, HSV529 produced Th1/Th2 characteristic immune response thought to be necessary for an effective vaccine. These results further support the clinical investigation of HSV529 in human subjects as a prophylactic vaccine."

The phytohormone auxin regulates nearly every aspect of plant growth and development (1Enders T.A. Strader L.C. Auxin activity: past, present, and future.Am. J. Bot. 2015; 102: 180-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). To date, all studied plants contain indole 3-acetic acid, the most common active auxin, as well as its biosynthetic precursors, inactive forms, and conjugates (2Korasick D.A. Enders T.A. Strader L.C. Auxin biosynthesis and storage forms.J. Exp. Bot. 2013; 64: 2541-2555Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar).

Therefore, tight regulation of auxin signaling is necessary to promote correct plant growth and development. In Arabidopsis thaliana (thale cress), auxin signaling primarily occurs through three protein families: auxin perceiving F-box proteins, auxin/indole 3-acetic acid inducible (Aux/IAA) 2The abbreviations used are:Aux/IAAauxin/indole 3-acetic acid inducibleARFauxin response factorPB1Phox/Bem1pITCisothermal titration calorimetryHSQCheteronuclear single quantum correlationMOPSO3-morpholino-2-hydroxypropanesulfonic acid. repressor proteins, and auxin response factor (ARF) transcription factors (7Wang R.

Plant Biol. 2014; 21: 51-58Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Under low local auxin concentrations, Aux/IAA proteins interact with ARF proteins through two C-terminal regions of homologous amino acid sequence, termed domains III/IV (8Kim J. Harter K.

Aux/IAA proteins repress expression of reporter genes containing natural and highly active synthetic auxin response elements.Plant Cell. 1997; 9: 1963-1971Crossref PubMed Scopus (1590) Google Scholar). This protein-protein interaction results in repression of auxin-regulated gene transcription by the ARF protein family (9Ulmasov T. Murfett J. Hagen G. Guilfoyle T.J. Aux/IAA proteins repress expression of reporter genes containing natural and highly active synthetic auxin response elements.Plant Cell. 1997; 9: 1963-1971Crossref PubMed Scopus (1590) Google Scholar). When local auxin levels increase, indole 3-acetic acid serves as the “molecular glue” to form a co-receptor with one of the six auxin perceiving F-box proteins and an Aux/IAA (10Tan X. Calderon-Villalobos L.I. Sharon M. Zheng C. Robinson C.V. Estelle M. Zheng N. Mechanism of auxin perception by the TIR1 ubiquitin ligase.Nature. 2007; 446: 640-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (1112) Google Scholar). This interaction results in polyubiquitination and degradation of the Aux/IAA repressor proteins (11Gray W.M. Kepinski S. Rouse D. Leyser O. Estelle M.

PB1 domains are conserved throughout all kingdoms and often confer interaction specificity in highly redundant protein scaffolds to facilitate signaling events (16Sumimoto H. Kamakura S. Ito T. Structure and function of the PB1 domain, a protein interaction module conserved in animals, fungi, amoebas, and plants.Sci. STKE. 2007; 2007: re6Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). PB1 domains adopt a ubiquitin-like β-grasp fold that can present two oppositely charged faces on the protein surface. The positive face bears an invariant lysine residue, and the negative face contains a cluster of aspartate and glutamate residues (DX(D/E)XDXnD) known as the OPCA motif. PB1 domains may possess a negative face (type I), a positive face (type II), or both faces (type I/II) with protein-protein interactions mediated by oriented binding of the negative face of one PB1 domain to the positive face of another PB1 domain protein.

In addition, the PB1 domains of ARF and Aux/IAA proteins provides a means for guiding interactions between various members of these protein families to control auxin responses in plants (18Guilfoyle T.J. The PB1 domain in auxin response factor and Aux/IAA proteins: a versatile protein interaction module in the auxin response.Plant Cell. 2015; 27: 33-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Although PB1 domain interactions involve electrostatic pairing of the invariant lysine with the OPCA motif (16Sumimoto H. Kamakura S. Ito T. Structure and function of the PB1 domain, a protein interaction module conserved in animals, fungi, amoebas, and plants.Sci.

Furthermore, predicted PB1 interface residues show various levels of conservation in both ARF and Aux/IAA, leading to the hypothesis that these residues may provide clues for interaction specificity (13Korasick D.A.

To better understand PB1 domain-mediated protein-protein interactions, we used the PB1 domain of Arabidopsis ARF7 to investigate the thermodynamic basis for self-interaction. Subsequent site-directed mutagenesis of residues forming the interaction interface and isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) identifies a two-pronged hot spot required for protein-protein interaction. Finally, we investigate the protein dynamics of the ARF7 PB1 domain using NMR spectroscopy. Our results indicate that electrostatic forces drive PB1 domain binding and identify core interface residues that stabilize protein-protein interaction across the ARF and Aux/IAA protein families. The constructs used for bacterial expression of the Arabidopsis ARF7 PB1 domain (Met-1037–Asn-1131) with either the K1042A (ARF7PB1K1042A) or D1092A/D1096A (ARF7PB1opca) mutations were previously described (13Korasick D.A.

Site-directed mutants of residues in the protein interaction interface were generated using the QuikChange Lightning site-directed mutagenesis kit (Agilent) with the appropriate template vector. All constructs were cloned into in Escherichia coli (DE3) Rosetta (Invitrogen) for protein expression. For ITC experiments, cells were grown in Terrific Broth. For three- and two-dimensional-NMR experiments, cells were grown in minimal media supplemented with [15N]ammonium chloride (Sigma) and/or d-[13C6]glucose (Sigma). Proteins were purified as described previously (13Korasick D.A. Westfall C.S. Lee S.G. Nanao M.H. Dumas R. Hagen G. Guilfoyle T.J. Jez J.M. Strader L.C.

For ITC experiments, purified protein was dialyzed overnight at 4 °C against 25 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol, and 3 mm 2-mercaptoethanol. For the salt dependence experiments, proteins were dialyzed overnight at 4 °C against 25 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 5% glycerol, and 3 mm 2-mercaptoethanol supplemented with 50–500 mm NaCl. For NMR spectroscopy experiments, size-exclusion chromatography fractions containing purified protein were pooled and dialyzed overnight at 4 °C against 25 mm MOPSO, pH 7.0, 100 mm NaCl. Protein concentrations were determined by UV/visible spectroscopy (ϵ280 nm = 16,560 cm−1 m−1). ITC experiments were carried out using a VP-ITC (Malvern) instrument at the temperatures indicated in the figure legends. For all ITC experiments, syringe protein concentration was 100 μm, and the cell protein concentration was 10 μm. Thermodynamic analysis of ARF7PB1 interaction was performed using titrations of ARF7PB1K1042A into ARF7PB1opca and vice versa. Titrations were carried out with the interface alanine mutant in the syringe titrated into either ARF7PB1K1042A or ARF7PB1opca. All ITC experiments consisted of 29 consecutive 10-μl titrations, each separated by a 600-s interval. The first injection of each experiment was limited to 6 μl. Results were analyzed using Origin 7.0 with data fit to a single-site binding model. Values for the change in Gibbs free energy (ΔG) were calculated using ΔG = −RTln(Keq), where R is the gas constant (1.9872 cal K−1 mol−1), and T is temperature in Kelvin. Entropy changes (ΔS) were calculated using ΔG = ΔH − TΔS. Kd was calculated as 1/Keq. Standard two-dimensional 1H,15N HSQC (19Davis A.L. Keeler J. Laue E.D. Moskau D.

The HSQC spectra of ARF7PB1K1042A and ARF7PB1opca closely resembled that of ARF7PB1K1042A,opca. Seventy-one backbone peaks in ARF7PB1K1042A and 60 backbone peaks in ARF7PB1opca could be directly traced to the corresponding assigned peaks in ARF7PB1K1042A,opca. These “transferred” assignments were used to analyze results of NMR chemical shift mapping. NMR chemical shift mapping was carried out using 15N uniformly labeled ARF7PB1K1042A at 75 μm protein concentration mixed with unlabeled ARF7PB1opca at molar ratios of 1:0, 1:1, 1:2, and 1:3. Reciprocal titrations were performed using 100 μm 15N-labeled ARF7PB1opca mixed with unlabeled ARF7PB1K1042A at 1:0, 1:1, 1:2, and 1:3 molar ratios. Identical two-dimensional-HSQC experiments with 64 scans (15N-ARF7PB1K1042A) or 32 scans (15N-ARF7PB1opca) and 128 × 2048 complex points were collected at 30 °C. Data were processed with NMRPipe and visualized using NMRView. We performed ITC experiments on the ARF7-ARF7 interaction to examine the thermodynamic basis for ARF7 PB1 domain association. To limit the interaction to dimerization rather than higher order multimerization, we used the ARF7PB1K1042A and ARF7PB1D1092A/D1096A(opca) mutants. Each ARF7PB1 variant is monomeric in solution as observed with size-exclusion chromatography, and dimerization occurs upon mixing the two variants (13Korasick D.A. Westfall C.S. Lee S.G. Nanao M.H.

U.S.A. 2014; 111: 5427-5432Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Combination of the two ARF7PB1 variants leads to an oriented interaction of the positive face (Lys-1042) of one PB1 domain with the negative face (OPCA) of the other molecule. Our initial ITC studies revealed that ARF7PB1K1042A and ARF7PB1opca interact with a Kd = 0.18 μm at 25 °C (Fig. 1a; Table 1). Similar results were observed when ARF7PB1K1042A was titrated into ARF7PB1opca and when ARF7PB1opca was titrated into ARF7PB1K1042A. The observed binding constant for association of ARF7 PB1 domains is comparable to the Kd value (0.87 μm) determined for ARF5 PB1 domain interaction (15Han M. Park Y. Kim I. Kim E.H. Yu T.K. Rhee S.

The stoichiometry (n = 1.05) of the ARF7PB1 interaction is also consistent with dimer formation, suggesting that we are interrogating a single interaction interface.TABLE 1ITC analysis of the temperature dependence of ARF7 PB1 domain interactionTemperaturenKdΔGΔH−TΔSμmkcal mol−1kcal mol−1kcal mol−1101.05 ± 0.010.06 ± 0.01−9.37 ± 1.59−12.57 ± 0.163.20150.97 ± 0.010.07 ± 0.01−9.42 ± 1.31−12.91 ± 0.153.49200.98 ± 0.010.09 ± 0.02−9.43 ± 1.59−13.74 ± 0.204.31251.05 ± 0.020.18 ± 0.03−9.21 ± 1.73−14.19 ± 0.294.98300.99 ± 0.010.28 ± 0.04−9.09 ± 1.15−14.82 ± 0.255.73351.00 ± 0.020.36 ± 0.06−9.09 ± 1.45−15.22 ± 0.396.13401.04 ± 0.030.63 ± 0.10−8.88 ± 1.39−15.83 ± 0.486.95 Open table in a new tab Analysis of the temperature dependence of ARF7PB1 interaction by ITC was used to determine the enthalpic (ΔH) and entropic (ΔS) contributions to the free energy of binding (ΔG) (Fig. 1b; Table 1). The Kd values increased ∼10-fold from 0.06 to 0.63 μm with temperature (10–40 °C). The overall modest 0.49-kcal mol−1 change in ΔG with increasing temperature results from compensatory changes in the ΔH and ΔS of interaction. As temperature increased, the enthalpic contributions to binding decreased, and the entropic component increased. Extrapolation of the specific heat capacity at constant pressure (ΔCp) from the measured ΔH values (Fig. 1b) yields a ΔCp = −110.6 kcal mol−1 K−1, suggesting that the ARF7PB1 interaction is driven primarily by electrostatic interactions (30Prabhu N.V. Sharp K.A. Heat capacity in proteins.Annu. Rev. Phys. Chem. 2005; 56: 521-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the relatively low magnitude of ΔCp indicates that association of the ARF7PB1 may not be particularly dynamic; e.g. the domain is largely globular and does not undergo major structural rearrangement upon binding (31Stites W.E. Protein-protein interactions: interface structure, binding thermodynamics, and mutational analysis.Chem. Rev. 1997; 97: 1233-1250Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar), which is further supported by a linear van't Hoff plot of ARF7PB1 interaction (Fig. 2). To test the role of electrostatic interaction on ARF7PB1 interaction, ITC was used to examine the salt dependence of interaction. Binding between ARF7PB1K1042A and ARF7PB1opca was analyzed in conditions of increasing ionic strength (Fig. 1c; Table 2). Changing the NaCl concentration from 50 to 500 mm led to a 17-fold increase in the Kd of interaction, consistent with the interaction being driven by electrostatic interactions rather than by hydrophobic effects. In summary, these results indicate that ARF7PB1 self-interaction is energetically favorable with submicromolar affinity and driven by electrostatic forces.TABLE 2ITC analysis of the salt dependence of ARF7 PB1 domain interaction[NaCl]Kdmμm0.050.07 ± 0.010.10.21 ± 0.040.250.55 ± 0.090.51.22 ± 0.22 Open table in a new tab Structural studies of the ARF7 PB1 domain show that oligomer formation is oriented with the basic (Lys-1042) face of one chain packed against the acidic (OPCA) face of another chain (Fig. 3a) (13Korasick D.A.

The interaction interface buries 497 Å2 of protein surface and places the invariant lysine (Lys-1042 in ARF7) opposite from residues of the OPCA motif (Asp-1092, Glu-1094, and Asp-1096 in ARF7).

Biol. 2007; 372: 774-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (6766) Google Scholar) suggests a total of 27 amino acids form contacts across the interaction interface with nine residues specifically contributing either ionic or hydrogen bond interactions (13Korasick D.A.

Four of these residues are on the basic face (Thr-1039, Gly-1050, Arg-1051, and Ser-1052) and five on the acidic face (Ile-1097, Leu-1099, Asp-1102, Asp-1103, Glu-1107).

To determine the contribution of key interface residues to ARF7PB1 interaction, we performed alanine-scanning mutagenesis and assessed protein binding by ITC. Because ARF7PB1opca displays a disrupted acidic face, we used this variant to query basic face interface residues. Likewise, we used the ARF7PB1K1042A variant to query acidic face residues. Single alanine substitutions (T1039A, K1042A, G1050A, R1051A, and S1052A) were made to the basic face of ARF7PB1opca.

In this study, an analysis of Water Pollution Index (WPI), Daniel Trend Test, Cluster Analysis and Discriminant Analysis are applied as an integrated approach to quantitatively explore the spatial and temporal variations and the latent sources of water pollution in the Shanchong River basin, Northwest Basin of Lake Fuxian, China. We group all field surveys into 2 clusters (dry season and rainy season). Moreover, 14 sampling sites have been grouped into 3 clusters for the rainy season (highly polluted, moderately polluted and less polluted sites) and 2 clusters for the dry season (highly polluted and less polluted sites) based on their similarities and the level of pollution during the two seasons. The results show that the main trend of pollution was aggravated during the transition from the dry to the rainy season. The Water Pollution Index of Total Nitrogen is the highest of all pollution parameters, whereas the Chemical Oxygen Demand (Chromium) is the lowest. Our results also show that the main sources of pollution are farming activities alongside the Shanchong River, soil erosion and fish culture at Shanchong River reservoir area and domestic sewage from scattered rural residential area. Our results suggest that strategies to prevent water pollutionat the Shanchong River basin need to focus on non-point pollution control by employing appropriate fertilizer formulas in farming, and take the measures of soil and water conservation at Shanchong reservoir area, and purifying sewage from scattered villages."
https://openalex.org/W2073894288,"Type I interferon (IFN) activation and its subsequent effects are important in the response to viral infections. Here we show that human astroviruses (HAstVs), which are important agents of acute gastroenteritis in children, induce a mild and delayed IFN response upon infecting CaCo-2 cells. Although IFN-β mRNA is detected within infected cells and supernatant from infected cells show antiviral activity against the replication of other well-known IFN-sensitive viruses, these responses occur at late stages of infection once genome replication has taken place. On the other hand, HAstV replication can be partially reduced by the addition of exogenous IFN, and inhibition of IFN activation by BX795 enhances viral replication, indicating that HAstVs are IFN-sensitive viruses. Finally, different levels of IFN response were observed in cells infected with different HAstV mutants with changes in the hypervariable region of nsP1a/4, suggesting that nsP1a/4 genotype may potentially have clinical implications due to its correlation with the viral replication phenotype and the antiviral responses induced within infected cells."
https://openalex.org/W2126762040,"A family of six ceramide synthases with distinct but overlapping substrate specificities is responsible for generation of ceramides with acyl chains ranging from ∼14-26 carbons. Ceramide synthase 6 (CerS6) preferentially generates C14- and C16-ceramides, and we have previously shown that down-regulation of this enzyme decreases apoptotic susceptibility. In this study, we further evaluated how increased CerS6 expression impacts sphingolipid composition and metabolism. Overexpression of CerS6 in HT29 colon cancer cells resulted in increased apoptotic susceptibility and preferential generation of C16-ceramide, which occurred at the expense of very long chain, saturated ceramides. These changes were also reflected in sphingomyelin composition. HT-CerS6 cells had increased intracellular levels of sphingosine, which is generated by ceramidases upon hydrolysis of ceramide. qRT-PCR analysis revealed that only expression of acid ceramidase (ASAH1) was increased. The increase in acid ceramidase was confirmed by expression and activity analyses. Pharmacological inhibition of JNK (SP600125) or curcumin reduced transcriptional up-regulation of acid ceramidase. Using an acid ceramidase promoter driven luciferase reporter plasmid, we demonstrated that CerS1 has no effect on transcriptional activation of acid ceramidase and that CerS2 slightly but significantly decreased the luciferase signal. Similar to CerS6, overexpression of CerS3-5 resulted in an ∼2-fold increase in luciferase reporter gene activity. Exogenous ceramide failed to induce reporter activity, while a CerS inhibitor and a catalytically inactive mutant of CerS6 failed to reduce it. Taken together, these results suggest that increased expression of CerS6 can mediate transcriptional activation of acid ceramidase in a JNK-dependent manner that is independent of CerS6 activity."
https://openalex.org/W1997246468,"Although obligate anaerobe, the sulfate-reducing bacterium Desulfovibrio vulgaris Hildenborough (DvH) exhibits high aerotolerance that involves several enzymatic systems, including two membrane-bound oxygen reductases, a bd-quinol oxidase and a cc(b/o)o3 cytochrome oxidase. Effect of constant low oxygen concentration on growth and morphology of the wild-type, single (Δbd, Δcox) and double deletion (Δcoxbd) mutant strains of the genes encoding these oxygen reductases was studied. When both wild-type and deletion mutant strains were cultured in lactate/sulfate medium under constant 0.02% O2 sparging, they were able to grow but the final biomasses and the growth yield were lower than that obtained under anaerobic conditions. At the end of the growth, lactate was not completely consumed and when conditions were then switched to anaerobic, growth resumed. Time-lapse microscopy revealed that a large majority of the cells were then able to divide (over 97%) but the time to recover a complete division event was longer for single deletion mutant Δbd than for the three other strains. Determination of the molar growth yields on lactate suggested that a part of the energy gained from lactate oxidation was derived toward cells protection/repairing against oxidative conditions rather than biosynthesis, and that this part was higher in the single deletion mutant Δbd and, to a lesser extent, Δcox strains. Our data show that when DvH encounters oxidative conditions, it is able to stop growing and to rapidly resume growing when conditions are switched to anaerobic, suggesting that it enters active dormancy sate under oxidative conditions. We propose that the pyruvate-ferredoxin oxidoreductase (PFOR) plays a central role in this phenomenon by reversibly switching from an oxidative-sensitive fully active state to an oxidative-insensitive inactive state. The oxygen reductases, and especially the bd-quinol oxidase, would have a crucial function by maintaining reducing conditions that permit PFOR to stay in its active state."
https://openalex.org/W1992775584,"Aldehyde deformylating oxygenase (AD) is a key enzyme for alkane biosynthesis in cyanobacteria, and it can be used as a catalyst for alkane production in vitro and in vivo. However, three free Cys residues in AD may impair its catalytic activity by undesired disulfide bond formation and oxidation. To develop Cys-deficient mutants of AD, we examined the roles of the Cys residues in the structure, stability, and alkane producing activity of AD from Nostoc punctiforme PCC 73102 by systematic Cys-to-Ala/Ser mutagenesis. The C71A/S mutations reduced the hydrocarbon producing activity of AD and facilitated the formation of a dimer, indicating that the conserved Cys71, which is located in close proximity to the substrate-binding site, plays crucial roles in maintaining the activity, structure, and stability of AD. On the other hand, mutations at Cys107 and Cys117 did not affect the hydrocarbon producing activity of AD. Therefore, we propose that the C107A/C117A double mutant is preferable to wild type AD for alkane production and that the double mutant may be used as a pseudo-wild type protein for further improvement of the alkane producing activity of AD."
https://openalex.org/W2006936649,"Single-pass transmembrane (TM) receptors transmit signals across lipid bilayers by helix association or by configurational changes within preformed dimers. The structure determination for such TM regions is challenging and has mostly been accomplished by NMR spectroscopy. Recently, the computational prediction of TM dimer structures is becoming recognized for providing models, including alternate conformational states, which are important for receptor regulation. Here we pursued a strategy to predict helix oligomers that is based on packing considerations (using the PREDDIMER webserver) and is followed by a refinement of structures, utilizing microsecond all-atom molecular dynamics simulations. We applied this method to plexin TM receptors, a family of 9 human proteins, involved in the regulation of cell guidance and motility. The predicted models show that, overall, the preferences identified by PREDDIMER are preserved in the unrestrained simulations and that TM structures are likely to be diverse across the plexin family. Plexin-B1 and –B3 TM helices are regular and tend to associate, whereas plexin-A1, -A2, –A3, -A4, -C1 and –D1 contain sequence elements, such as poly-Glycine or aromatic residues that distort helix conformation and association. Plexin-B2 does not form stable dimers due to the presence of TM prolines. No experimental structural information on the TM region is available for these proteins, except for plexin-C1 dimeric and plexin-B1 – trimeric structures inferred from X-ray crystal structures of the intracellular regions. Plexin-B1 TM trimers utilize Ser and Thr sidechains for interhelical contacts. We also modeled the juxta-membrane (JM) region of plexin-C1 and plexin-B1 and show that it synergizes with the TM structures. The structure and dynamics of the JM region and TM-JM junction provide determinants for the distance and distribution of the intracellular domains, and for their binding partners relative to the membrane. The structures suggest experimental tests and will be useful for the interpretation of future studies."
https://openalex.org/W2028045098,"We investigated the variation in plant response in host-pathogen interactions between wild (Aegilops spp., Triticum spp.) and domesticated wheat (Triticum spp.) and Wheat dwarf virus (WDV). The distribution of WDV and its wild host species overlaps in Western Asia in the Fertile Crescent, suggesting a coevolutionary relationship. Bread wheat originates from a natural hybridization between wild emmer wheat (carrying the A and B genomes) and the wild D genome donor Aegilops tauschii, followed by polyploidization and domestication. We studied whether the strong selection during these evolutionary processes, leading to genetic bottlenecks, may have resulted in a loss of resistance in domesticated wheat. In addition, we investigated whether putative fluctuations in intensity of selection imposed on the host-pathogen interactions have resulted in a variation in susceptibility to WDV. To test our hypotheses we evaluated eighteen wild and domesticated wheat taxa, directly or indirectly involved in wheat evolution, for traits associated with WDV disease such as leaf chlorosis, different growth traits and WDV content. The plants were exposed to viruliferous leafhoppers (Psammotettix alienus) in a greenhouse trial and evaluated at two time points. We found three different plant response patterns: i) continuous reduction in growth over time, ii) weak response at an early stage of plant development but a much stronger response at a later stage, and iii) remission of symptoms over time. Variation in susceptibility may be explained by differences in the intensity of natural selection, shaping the coevolutionary interaction between WDV and the wild relatives. However, genetic bottlenecks during wheat evolution have not had a strong impact on WDV resistance. Further, this study indicates that the variation in susceptibility may be associated with the genome type and that the ancestor Ae. tauschii may be useful as genetic resource for the improvement of WDV resistance in wheat."

To date, the best studied function of H2A.Z is in transcriptional regulation. Evidence suggests that, depending on the organism and context, H2A.Z is associated with both positive and negative regulation of gene expression. For example, genome-wide studies in yeast have found that H2A.Z is localized at the transcription start sites of genes, and this enrichment is inversely correlated with transcription activity (7Wan Y.

At present, how the function of H2A.Z links to both transcriptional activation and repression is still not clearly understood. Differential post-translational modifications on H2A.Z, such as acetylation and monoubiquitylation, probably determine its specific roles in transcriptional regulation. For example, in mammalian cells, five lysines (Lys-4, -7, -11, -13, and -15) at the N terminus of H2A.Z are known to be acetylated, and three lysines at the C terminus (Lys-120, -121, and -125) are potential sites of ubiquitylation (21Ishibashi T.

Acetylated H2A.Z is most often associated with active gene transcription (7Wan Y. Saleem R.A. Ratushny A.V. Roda O. Smith J.J. Lin C.H. Chiang J.H. Aitchison J.D.

More recently, the H2A.Z associated with bivalent (both H3K4- and H3K27-methylated) 3The abbreviations used are:H3K4 and H3K27histone H3 Lys-4 and Lys-27, respectivelyacme1, me2, and me3, acetylation, mono-methylation, dimethylation, and trimethylation, respectivelyH3 and H4histone H3 and H4, respectivelyH2A.Z-Ac-mutH2A.Z non-acetylatable mutantPolpolymeraseGMgrowth mediumDIdifferentiation indexMHCmyosin heavy chainFIfusion indexNLSnuclear localization signalCERcore enhancer regionDRRdistal regulatory regionChART-PCRchromatin accessibility by real-time PCRPRRproximal regulatory regionEdU5-ethynyl-2′-deoxyuridine. domains in embryonic stem cells was found to be both acetylated and ubiquitylated (19Ku M.

These and other studies have led us to hypothesize that distinct modification patterns distinguish the functions of H2A.Z in activation versus repression (26Draker R. Cheung P.

Mammalian development is a highly complex program of events that requires precise coordination. As each cell type differentiates, different sets of genes are expressed in specific temporal order. Changes in the chromatin architecture can dictate gene expression by facilitating or restricting the binding of transcription factors to the target genes. However, how these different epigenetic states are established and maintained during the course of differentiation remains elusive. The transitions between epigenetic states probably involve alterations of the composition and modifications on chromatin. Several studies have suggested that H2A.Z is involved in the developmental process, especially because it is found at developmentally regulated genes (27Whittle C.M. McClinic K.N. Ercan S. Zhang X. Green R.D. Kelly W.G. Lieb J.D. The genomic distribution and function of histone variant HTZ-1 during C. elegans embryogenesis.PLoS Genet. 2008; 4: e1000187Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). For example, knockdown of this variant results in dramatic developmental defects in Caenorhabditis elegans and Xenopus laevis (27Whittle C.M. McClinic K.N. Ercan S. Zhang X. Green R.D. Kelly W.G.

Chem. 2004; 279: 43815-43820Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Most importantly, genetic deletion of H2A.Z is lethal in Tetrahymena and Drosophila and during mouse development (1Faast R. Thonglairoam V. Schulz T.C. Beall J. Wells J.R.E. Taylor H. Matthaei K.

A histone variant, H2AvD, is essential in Drosophila melanogaster.Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 593-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar); therefore, it must have an essential function during development. In mouse embryonic stem cells, H2A.Z has been found at the same developmentally related genes marked by a PcG protein, Suz12, a member of the PRC2 complex responsible for depositing the H3K27me3 mark (18Creyghton M.P. Markoulaki S. Levine S.S. Hanna J. Lodato M.A. Sha K. Young R.A. Jaenisch R. Boyer L.A. H2AZ is enriched at polycomb complex target genes in ES cells and is necessary for lineage commitment.Cell. 2008; 135: 649-661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). That study also showed that RNAi-mediated depletion of H2A.Z does not affect the growth of mouse embryonic stem cells, but this variant is required for neuronal differentiation. Therefore, the essential function of H2A.Z may be related to a role in regulating the changing gene expression program during differentiation. Myogenesis is an excellent cellular model for studying control of cellular differentiation. This well defined process begins with the commitment of muscle precursor cells to the skeletal muscle lineage, and these committed myoblasts respond to external signals that activate expression of muscle-specific genes. In turn, the cascade of activated genes orchestrates the differentiation process, ultimately leading to the fusion of myoblasts to form multinucleated myotubes. MyoD, Myf5, myogenin, and MRF4 are a family of myogenic transcription factors that direct the temporal regulation of myogenesis. MyoD and Myf5 have roles in the commitment of cells to skeletal muscle cell fates, whereas myogenin and MRF4 are involved in terminal differentiation (30Berkes C.A. Tapscott S.J. MyoD and the transcriptional control of myogenesis.Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2005; 16: 585-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar). Recent studies examining epigenetic changes during muscle differentiation have found that histone variants play an integral role in this process. For example, studies have found that the histone H3 variant, H3.3, is critical for myogenic fate determination and for the expression of muscle-specific genes, possibly through alteration of the chromatin environment at the MyoD locus (31Yang J.H. Song Y. Seol J.H. Park J.Y. Yang Y.J. Han J.W. Youn H.D. Cho E.J. Myogenic transcriptional activation of MyoD mediated by replication-independent histone deposition.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

(33Cuadrado A. Corrado N. Perdiguero E. Lafarga V. Muñoz-Canoves P. Nebreda A.R. Essential role of p18Hamlet/SRCAP-mediated histone H2A. Z chromatin incorporation in muscle differentiation.EMBO J. 2010; 29: 2014-2025Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) reported that SRCAP-mediated deposition of H2A.Z at the myogenin promoter is important for the chromatin-modeling and subsequent activation of this gene during myogenic differentiation. Although the effects associated with loss of SRCAP suggest that H2A.Z is required for this process, the involvement of this variant in muscle differentiation has not been directly tested. C2C12 mouse myoblast cells are commonly used to study the process of myogenesis. When the growth condition is switched from high-serum growth medium to low-serum differentiation medium, the normally mononuclear C2C12 myoblasts undergo myogenic differentiation and fuse to form multinucleated myotubes (34Yaffe D. Saxel O. Serial passaging and differentiation of myogenic cells isolated from dystrophic mouse muscle.Nature. 1977; 270: 725-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (1559) Google Scholar). To test whether H2A.Z and H2A.Z acetylation have specific roles in this process, we generated stable C2C12 cells that express wild type (WT) H2A.Z or a H2A.Z non-acetylatable mutant (H2A.Z-Ac-mut). We found that expression of ectopic WT or mutant H2A.Z had a dominant effect over the endogenous H2A.Z and resulted in distinct differentiation defects in the C2C12 myoblasts. Most strikingly, expression of H2A.Z-Ac-mut completely blocked differentiation of these cells. ChIP assays showed that RNA Pol II and histone modification marks associated with transcriptional activation were absent at the promoters of MyoD or myogenin in these cells. Further analyses showed that the apparent differentiation defect is due to a loss of MyoD expression under both normal growing and differentiation conditions and that ectopic expression of MyoD in the H2A.Z-Ac-mut-expressing cells could rescue the differentiation defect phenotype. Finally, chromatin accessibility assays showed that the MyoD promoter is less accessible in the H2A.Z-Ac-mut cells compared with control normal cells. Altogether, our findings suggest that expression of the non-acetylatable H2A.Z disrupted accessibility and activation of the MyoD gene, ultimately leading to an overall defect in the ability of C2C12 cells to differentiate. C2C12 mouse myoblasts were obtained from the American Tissue Culture Collection (ATCC). Cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (growth medium (GM)). Differentiation was induced by replacing the GM with DMEM supplemented with 2% horse serum (differentiation medium) once the cells had reached 90% confluence. Cells were harvested 72 and 96 h after incubation in differentiation medium. Medium was changed every 2 days during differentiation. HEK293T cells for retroviral production were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Transient transfections were performed using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. MyoD overexpression was performed by transient transfection of C2C12 cells with pEMSV-MyoD, a gift from Dr. John C. McDermott (York University). Total cell extracts were isolated, and protein levels were analyzed by immunoblotting on a 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and detected using the antibodies listed in Table 1.

Ecotropic retroviral supernatant were generated by transfection of a packaging vector and pSuper/pLNCX2 vector in a 1:1 ratio in HEK293T cells using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). The viral supernatant was collected three times every 24 h and was used to infect C2C12 cells in 6-well tissue culture dishes with 4 μg/ml Polybrene (Sigma).

The precipitated DNA was amplified by real-time PCR, with the primer sets in Table 1. The data shown are representative of three or more independent experiments. C2C12 cells were seeded in 6-well tissue culture dishes containing sterile glass coverslips. Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min at room temperature.

Participants were in-hospital stroke patients registered in the Japan Rehabilitation Database between 2005 and 2012. A total of 1862 patients were eligible after applying exclusion criteria. Propensity score analysis was applied to adjust for potential bias and to create two comparable groups. An additional subset analysis focused on Functional Independence Measure (FIM) scores on admission.In this sample, 30.7% of 1863 eligible patients were prescribed AFOs. Propensity score matched analysis showed that patients with AFOs had significantly higher scores than those without them for discharge FIM (mean: 91.3 vs 85.8; p=0.02), FIM gain (mean: 28.9 vs 23.5; p<0.001), and FIM efficiency (mean: 0.27 vs 0.22; p<0.001). Inverse probability weighting analysis showed similar results. In the subset analysis, patients with AFOs had significantly higher discharge FIM compared with those without them in the low admission FIM subgroup only. In addition, patients with AFOs performed independent exercise more than those without them (p<0.001).These data suggest that stroke survivors may have better functional recovery if they are prescribed an AFO than if they are not prescribed an AFO. The use of AFOs is considered to be a feasible option to improve functional recovery of stroke rehabilitation patients."

While recent studies have demonstrated that the myeloid basophils promote Th2 cells in response to various types of allergens, the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Here, we found for the first time that in a mouse model of allergic asthma basophils highly expressed OX40 ligand (OX40L) after activation. Interestingly, blockade of OX40-OX40L interaction suppressed basophils-primed Th2 cell differentiation in vitro and ameliorated ovalbumin (OVA)-induced allergic eosinophilic inflammation mediated by Th2 activation. In accordance, the adoptive transfer of basophils derived from mediastinal lymph nodes (MLN) of OVA-immunized mice triggered a robust Th2 response and eosinophilic inflammation in wild-type mice but largely muted in OX40−/− mice and mice receiving OX40L-blocked basophils. Taken together, our results reveal a critical role of OX40L presented by the activated basophils to initiate Th2 responses in an allergic asthma model, implicating OX40-OX40L signaling as a potential therapeutic target in the treatment of allergic airway inflammation.

Interestingly, blockade of OX40-OX40L interaction suppressed basophils-primed Th2 cell differentiation in vitro and ameliorated ovalbumin (OVA)-induced allergic eosinophilic inflammation mediated by Th2 activation. In accordance, the adoptive transfer of basophils derived from mediastinal lymph nodes (MLN) of OVA-immunized mice triggered a robust Th2 response and eosinophilic inflammation in wild-type mice but largely muted in OX40−/− mice and mice receiving OX40L-blocked basophils. Taken together, our results reveal a critical role of OX40L presented by the activated basophils to initiate Th2 responses in an allergic asthma model, implicating OX40-OX40L signaling as a potential therapeutic target in the treatment of allergic airway inflammation."

https://openalex.org/W1980644758,"Background It is difficult to determine whether to treat a given girl who has idiopathic central precocious puberty (CPP) with gonadotropin-releasing hormone analog (GnRHa) in terms of adult height (AH). The objective was to provide an easy tool for predicting AH and age at first menstruation at initial evaluation to help guide the decision regarding whether to treat. Methods Data analysis using multiple linear regression models was performed in 134 girls with CPP. Among them 78 were given GnRHa because of low predicted AH (n=45), pubertal luteinising hormone (LH)/follicle-stimulating hormone peaks (FSH) ratio (n=50) and/or high plasma estradiol concentration (n=45). 56 girls were followed without treatment. Results In the whole population, the actual AH (162.1±5.61 cm) was similar to target height (161.7±4.91 cm) and to AH predicted by the Bayley and Pinneau method (161.9±7.98 cm). Separated models for treated and untreated girls provide very close estimations, leading to a unique formula for both groups. The AH (cm) could be calculated at the initial evaluation: 2.21 (height at initial evaluation, SD) + 2.32 (target height, SD) – 1.83 (LH/FSH peaks ratio) + 159.68. The actual AH was lower than the calculated AH by more than 1 SD (5.6 cm) in 11 girls (8.0%). The time between onset of puberty and first menstruation (in untreated girls) can be estimated with: 10.9 - 0.57 (LH/FSH peaks ratio). The formulae are available at http://www.kamick.org/lemaire/med/girls-cpp15.html. Conclusions We established formulae that can be used at an initial evaluation to predict the AH, and the time between onset of puberty and first menstruation after spontaneous puberty. The similarity of the formulae for both groups suggests that the treatment had no significant effect on the AH. However, the criteria used to select treatment suggest that it prevents the deterioration of AH in cases with rapidly evolving form of CPP."
https://openalex.org/W2014482185,"Epichloë species (including the former genus Neotyphodium) are fungal symbionts of many agronomically important forage grasses, and provide their grass hosts with protection from a wide range of biotic and abiotic stresses. Epichloë species include many interspecific hybrids with allodiploid-like genomes, which may provide the potential for combined traits or recombination to generate new traits. Though circumstantial evidence suggests that such interspecific hybrids might have arisen from nuclear fusion events following vegetative hyphal fusion between different Epichloë strains, this hypothesis has not been addressed empirically. Here, we investigated vegetative hyphal fusion and subsequent nuclear behavior in Epichloë species. A majority of Epichloë strains, especially those having a sexual stage, underwent self vegetative hyphal fusion. Vegetative fusion also occurred between two hyphae from different Epichloë strains. Though Epichloë spp. are uninucleate fungi, hyphal fusion resulted in two nuclei stably sharing the same cytoplasm, which might ultimately lead to nuclear fusion. In addition, protoplast fusion experiments gave rise to uninucleate putative hybrids, which apparently had two markers, one from each parent within the same nucleus. These results are consistent with the notion that interspecific hybrids arise from vegetative hyphal fusion. However, we also discuss additional factors, such as post-hybridization selection, that may be important to explain the recognized prevalence of hybrids in Epichloë species."
https://openalex.org/W2017441599,"While human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs), either in the bone marrow or in tumour microenvironment could be targeted by radiotherapy, their response is poorly understood. The oxic effects on radiosensitivity, cell cycle progression are largely unknown, and the radiation effects on hMSCs differentiation capacities remained unexplored. Here we analysed hMSCs viability and cell cycle progression in 21% O2 and 3% O2 conditions after medical X-rays irradiation. Differentiation towards osteogenesis and chondrogenesis after irradiation was evaluated through an analysis of differentiation specific genes. Finally, a 3D culture model in hypoxia was used to evaluate chondrogenesis in conditions mimicking the natural hMSCs microenvironment. The hMSCs radiosensitivity was not affected by O2 tension. A decreased number of cells in S phase and an increase in G2/M were observed in both O2 tensions after 16 hours but hMSCs released from the G2/M arrest and proliferated at day 7. Osteogenesis was increased after irradiation with an enhancement of mRNA expression of specific osteogenic genes (alkaline phosphatase, osteopontin). Osteoblastic differentiation was altered since matrix deposition was impaired with a decreased expression of collagen I, probably through an increase of its degradation by MMP-3. After induction in monolayers, chondrogenesis was altered after irradiation with an increase in COL1A1 and a decrease in both SOX9 and ACAN mRNA expression. After induction in a 3D culture in hypoxia, chondrogenesis was altered after irradiation with a decrease in COL2A1, ACAN and SOX9 mRNA amounts associated with a RUNX2 increase. Together with collagens I and II proteins decrease, associated to a MMP-13 expression increase, these data show a radiation-induced impairment of chondrogenesis. Finally, a radiation-induced impairment of both osteogenesis and chondrogenesis was characterised by a matrix composition alteration, through inhibition of synthesis and/or increased degradation. Alteration of osteogenesis and chondrogenesis in hMSCs could potentially explain bone/joints defects observed after radiotherapy."
https://openalex.org/W2037866791,"Various plastic strips and sheets (termed ‘simple anterior fish excluders’−SAFEs) were positioned across the openings of penaeid trawls in attempts at reducing the unwanted bycatches of small teleosts. Initially, three SAFEs (a single wire without, and with small and large plastic panels) were compared against a control (no SAFE) on paired beam trawls. All SAFEs maintained targeted Metapenaeus macleayi catches, while the largest plastic SAFE significantly reduced total bycatch by 51% and the numbers of Pomatomus saltatrix, Mugil cephalus and Herklotsichthys castelnaui by up to 58%. A redesigned SAFE (‘continuous plastic’) was subsequently tested (against a control) on paired otter trawls, significantly reducing total bycatch by 28% and P. saltatrix and H. castelnaui by up to 42%. The continuous-plastic SAFE also significantly reduced M. macleayi catches by ~7%, but this was explained by ~5% less wing-end spread, and could be simply negated through otter-board refinement. Further work is required to refine the tested SAFEs, and to quantify species-specific escape mechanisms. Nevertheless, the SAFE concept might represent an effective approach for improving penaeid-trawl selectivity."
https://openalex.org/W2060249530,"In this work we present a new open source software package offering a unified framework for the real-time adaptation of fMRI stimulation procedures. The software provides a straightforward setup and highly flexible approach to adapt fMRI paradigms while the experiment is running. The general framework comprises the inclusion of parameters from subject's compliance, such as directing gaze to visually presented stimuli and physiological fluctuations, like blood pressure or pulse. Additionally, this approach yields possibilities to investigate complex scientific questions, for example the influence of EEG rhythms or fMRI signals results themselves. To prove the concept of this approach, we used our software in a usability example for an fMRI experiment where the presentation of emotional pictures was dependent on the subject's gaze position. This can have a significant impact on the results. So far, if this is taken into account during fMRI data analysis, it is commonly done by the post-hoc removal of erroneous trials. Here, we propose an a priori adaptation of the paradigm during the experiment's runtime. Our fMRI findings clearly show the benefits of an adapted paradigm in terms of statistical power and higher effect sizes in emotion-related brain regions. This can be of special interest for all experiments with low statistical power due to a limited number of subjects, a limited amount of time, costs or available data to analyze, as is the case with real-time fMRI."
https://openalex.org/W2029109515,"Decompensated cirrhosis is a common precipitant for hospitalization, and there is limited information concerning factors that influence the delivery of quality care in cirrhotic inpatients. We sought to determine the relation between physician specialty and inpatient quality care for decompensated cirrhosis.We reviewed 247 hospital admissions for decompensated cirrhosis, managed by hospitalists or intensivists, between 2009 and 2013. The primary outcome was quality care delivery, defined as adherence to all evidence-based specialty society practice guidelines pertaining to each specific complication of cirrhosis. Secondary outcomes included new complications, length-of-stay, and in-hospital death.Overall, 147 admissions (59.5%) received quality care. Quality care was given more commonly by intensivists, compared with hospitalists (71.7% vs. 53.1%, P = .006), and specifically for gastrointestinal bleeding (72% vs. 45.8%, P = .03) and hepatic encephalopathy (100% vs. 63%, P = .005). Involvement of gastroenterology consultation was also more common in admissions in which quality care was administered (68.7% vs. 54.0%, P = .023). Timely diagnostic paracentesis was associated with reduced new complications in admissions for refractory ascites (9.5% vs. 46.6%, P = .02), and reduced length-of-stay in admissions for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (5 days vs. 13 days, P = .02).Adherence to quality indicators for decompensated cirrhosis is suboptimal among hospitalized patients. Although quality care adherence appears to be higher among cirrhotic patients managed by intensivists than by hospitalists, opportunities for improvement exist in both groups. Rational and cost-effective strategies should be sought to achieve this end."
https://openalex.org/W2044676713,"Background The World Health Organization recommends use of multiple approaches to control malaria. The integrated approach to malaria prevention advocates the use of several malaria prevention methods in a holistic manner. This study assessed perceptions and practices on integrated malaria prevention in Wakiso district, Uganda. Methods A clustered cross-sectional survey was conducted among 727 households from 29 villages using both quantitative and qualitative methods. Assessment was done on awareness of various malaria prevention methods, potential for use of the methods in a holistic manner, and reasons for dislike of certain methods. Households were classified as using integrated malaria prevention if they used at least two methods. Logistic regression was used to test for factors associated with the use of integrated malaria prevention while adjusting for clustering within villages. Results Participants knew of the various malaria prevention methods in the integrated approach including use of insecticide treated nets (97.5%), removing mosquito breeding sites (89.1%), clearing overgrown vegetation near houses (97.9%), and closing windows and doors early in the evenings (96.4%). If trained, most participants (68.6%) would use all the suggested malaria prevention methods of the integrated approach. Among those who would not use all methods, the main reasons given were there being too many (70.2%) and cost (32.0%). Only 33.0% households were using the integrated approach to prevent malaria. Use of integrated malaria prevention by households was associated with reading newspapers (AOR 0.34; 95% CI 0.22 –0.53) and ownership of a motorcycle/car (AOR 1.75; 95% CI 1.03 – 2.98). Conclusion Although knowledge of malaria prevention methods was high and perceptions on the integrated approach promising, practices on integrated malaria prevention was relatively low. The use of the integrated approach can be improved by promoting use of multiple malaria prevention methods through various communication channels such as mass media."
https://openalex.org/W2027146740,"Multiple myeloma (MM) is a generally fatal plasma cell cancer that often shows activation of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt (PI3K/Akt) pathway. Targeted pharmacologic therapies, however, have not yet progressed beyond the clinical trial stage, and given the complexity of the PI3K/Akt signalling system (e.g. multiple protein isoforms, diverse feedback regulation mechanisms, strong variability between patients) it is mandatory to characterise its ramifications in order to better guide informed decisions about the best therapeutic approaches. Here we explore whether serum and glucocorticoid-regulated kinase 3 (SGK3), a potential downstream effector of PI3K, plays a role in oncogenic signalling in MM cells—either in concert with or independent of Akt. SGK3 was expressed in all MM cell lines and in all primary MM samples tested. Four MM cell lines representing a broad range of intrinsic Akt activation (very strong: MM.1s, moderate: L 363 and JJN-3, absent: AMO-1) were chosen to test the effects of transient SGK3 knockdown alone and in combination with pharmacological inhibition of Akt, PI3K-p110α, or in the context of serum starvation. Although the electroporation protocol led to strong SGK3 depletion for at least 5 days its absence had no substantial effect on the activation status of potential downstream substrates, or on the survival, viability or proliferation of MM cells in all experimental contexts tested. We conclude that it is unlikely that SGK3 plays a significant role for oncogenic signalling in multiple myeloma."
https://openalex.org/W2201702525,"Preterm birth has been shown to induce an altered developmental trajectory of brain structure and function. With the aid support vector machine (SVM) classification methods we aimed to investigate whether MRI data, collected in adolescence, could be used to predict whether an individual had been born preterm or at term. To this end we collected T1–weighted anatomical MRI data from 143 individuals (69 controls, mean age 14.6y). The inclusion criteria for those born preterm were birth weight ≤ 1500g and gestational age < 37w. A linear SVM was trained on the grey matter segment of MR images in two different ways. First, all the individuals were used for training and classification was performed by the leave–one–out method, yielding 93% correct classification (sensitivity = 0.905, specificity = 0.942). Separately, a random half of the available data were used for training twice and each time the other, unseen, half of the data was classified, resulting 86% and 91% accurate classifications. Both gestational age (R = –0.24, p<0.04) and birth weight (R = –0.51, p < 0.001) correlated with the distance to decision boundary within the group of individuals born preterm. Statistically significant correlations were also found between IQ (R = –0.30, p < 0.001) and the distance to decision boundary. Those born small for gestational age did not form a separate subgroup in these analyses. The high rate of correct classification by the SVM motivates further investigation. The long–term goal is to automatically and non–invasively predict the outcome of preterm–born individuals on an individual basis using as early a scan as possible."
