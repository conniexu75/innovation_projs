https://openalex.org/W2330233053,"Choline kinase (ChoK) and its product, phosphocholine (PCho), have been implicated in human carcinogenesis. Inhibition of this enzyme has been shown to be an efficient antitumor strategy in vivo. The aim of this study was to assess the relationship between the regulation of ChoK and clinical features in patients with breast cancer. To that end, normal and tumoral tissues from 53 patients with breast carcinomas were analysed for ChoK activity and expression, and compared to some clinical parameters. We report a relevant increase in ChoK activity in 38.5% of the tumoral tissues analysed when compared to the normal levels in healthy tissues. Furthermore, some clinical features were found significant versus ChoK status. First, an association of choline enzymatic activity with histological tumor grade was observed (P<0.001). In addition, increased ChoK activity was also associated with ER-negative breast carcinomas (P=0.037). A significant association between ChoK overexpression and both high histologic tumor grade (P=0.017) and ER-negative tumors (P=0.003) was found. Finally, ChoK overexpression was found in 17% of the samples and all corresponded with those that display the highest increase in ChoK activity (P<0.001). Here we provide evidence that ChoK may be related to the development of human breast cancer, suggesting that this finding may constitute the basis for the development of a novel antitumoral strategy for these patients."

Therefore, we examined the methylation status of nine genes (p16INK4A, MGMT, GSTP1, RASSF1A, APC, DAPK, RARβ, CDH1 and CDH13) in 175 primary pediatric tumors and 23 tumor cell lines using methylation-specific PCR. We studied the major forms of pediatric tumors – Wilms' tumor, neuroblastoma, hepatoblastoma, medulloblastoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, osteosarcoma, Ewing's sarcoma, retinoblastoma and acute leukemia. The most frequently methylated gene in both primary tumors and cell lines was RASSF1A (40, 86%, respectively). However, the rates of RASSF1A methylation in individual tumor types varied from 0 to 88%. RASSF1A methylation was tumor specific and was absent in adjacent non-malignant tissues. Methylation of the other genes was relatively rare in tumors and non-malignant tissues (less than 5%). Neuroblastoma patients with methylation of RASSF1A were significantly older than patients without methylation (P=0.008). There was no relationship between methylation status and other clinico-pathologic parameters. We treated six cell lines lacking RASSF1A mRNA with 5-aza-2′deoxycytidine to examine the relationship between methylation and transcriptional silencing. In five of six cell lines, restoration of RASSF1A mRNA was confirmed by RT–PCR. Our findings indicate that aberrant promoter methylation of RASSF1A may contribute to the pathogenesis of many different forms of pediatric tumors."
https://openalex.org/W2091061305,"The extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase 2 (ERK2) is the founding member of a family of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) that are central components of signal transduction pathways for cell proliferation, stress responses, and differentiation. The MAPKs are unique among the Ser/Thr protein kinases in that they require both Thr and Tyr phosphorylation for full activation. The dual phosphorylation of Thr-183 and Tyr-185 in ERK2 is catalyzed by MAPK/ERK kinase 1 (MEK1). However, the identity and relative activity of protein phosphatases that inactivate ERK2 are less well established. In this study, we performed a kinetic analysis of ERK2 dephosphorylation by protein phosphatases using a continuous spectrophotometric enzyme-coupled assay that measures the inorganic phosphate produced in the reaction. Eleven different protein phosphatases, many previously suggested to be involved in ERK2 regulation, were compared, including tyrosine-specific phosphatases (PTP1B, CD45, and HePTP), dual specificity MAPK phosphatases (VHR, MKP3, and MKP5), and Ser/Thr protein phosphatases (PP1, PP2A, PP2B, PP2Cα, and λPP). The results provide biochemical evidence that protein phosphatases display exquisite specificity in their substrate recognition and implicate HePTP, MKP3, and PP2A as ERK2 phosphatases. The fact that ERK2 inactivation could be carried out by multiple specific phosphatases shows that signals can be integrated into the pathway at the phosphatase level to determine the cellular response to external stimuli. Important insights into the roles of various protein phosphatases in ERK2 kinase signaling are obtained, and further analysis of the mechanism by which different protein phosphatases recognize and inactivate MAPKs will increase our understanding of how this kinase family is regulated.

The level of protein phosphorylation inside the cell is controlled by the balanced activities of protein kinases and protein phosphatases. Consequently, protein kinases and phosphatases are key components of intracellular signal transduction pathways through which cells respond to extracellular signals, such as hormones and growth factors, as well as environmental and nutritional stresses. The mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs)1 are the major convergence points in these signaling pathways (1Chen Z. Gibson T.B. Robinson F. Silvestro L. Pearson G., Xu, B. Wright A. Vanderbilt C. Cobb M.H. Chem. Rev. 2001; 101: 2449-2476Crossref PubMed Scopus (794) Google Scholar). The three best-characterized MAPK cascades include the extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK) pathway, which responds to stimuli that induce proliferation and differentiation, the c-Jun N-terminal protein kinase (JNK) pathway, and the p38 kinase pathway, both of which are activated in response to environmental stresses. After activation, each MAPK phosphorylates a distinct spectrum of substrates, which includes key regulatory enzymes, cytoskeletal proteins, regulators of apoptosis, nuclear receptors, and many transcription factors. Such a broad array of substrates is consistent with the observation that MAPKs control many critical cell functions. Because of the critical importance of MAPK in cellular signaling, the activity of the MAPK is tightly regulated. The MAPK is activated by phosphorylation within a structurally conserved activation loop. However, unlike many other protein kinases, whose activation requires phosphorylation of a single residue within the activation loop (2Johnson L.N. Noble M.E.M. Owen D.J. Cell. 1996; 85: 149-158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1182) Google Scholar), MAPKs are activated via a MAPK/ERK kinase (MEK)-catalyzed dual phosphorylation of the Thr and Tyr residues in the TXY motif of the activation loop (where Xis Glu in ERKs, Pro in JNKs, and Gly in p38 kinases) (3Ahn N.G.

Cell. 1997; 90: 859-869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar). Although the activation of MAPKs has been extensively studied (9Ferrell Jr., J.E. Bhatt R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19008-19016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 10Burack W.R. Sturgill T.W. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 5929-5933Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), the equally important process of quenching MAPK activity is poorly understood. Evidence suggests that MAPK inactivation may involve all major types of protein phosphatases (11Cobb M.H. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1999; 71: 479-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (762) Google Scholar). Protein phosphatases are broadly classified into two major families: the protein Ser/Thr phosphatases and the protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs). Protein Ser/Thr phosphatases remove the phosphoryl group from serine/threonine residues, whereas PTPs dephosphorylate tyrosine residues in phosphoprotein substrates. Structural comparisons of the catalytic domains of PTPs with the catalytic subunits of protein Ser/Thr phosphatases reveal no similarity. In addition, these two classes of protein phosphatases have evolved to employ completely different strategies to accomplish the dephosphorylation reaction. This is in striking contrast to the situation with protein kinases, where tyrosine-specific and serine/threonine-specific kinases share significant sequence similarity in the catalytic domains and utilize similar structural and mechanistic features for catalysis (2Johnson L.N. Noble M.E.M. Owen D.J. Cell. 1996; 85: 149-158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1182) Google Scholar, 12Taylor S.S. Radzio-Andzelm E. Hunter T.

Thus, although the protein Ser/Thr phosphatases are metalloenzymes with bimetallic centers containing iron and effect catalysis by direct attack of an activated water molecule at the phosphorus atom of the substrate (14Barford D. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1999; 27: 751-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), the PTPs do not require metals and proceed through a covalent phosphocysteine intermediate during catalytic turnover (15Zhang Z.-Y. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1998; 33: 1-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Protein Ser/Thr phosphatases fall into two structurally distinct sub-gene families, PPP and PPM (16Cohen P.T.W. Adv. Protein Phosphatases. 1994; 8: 371-376Google Scholar). The PPP subfamily includes protein phosphatase 1 (PP1), 2A (PP2A), and 2B (PP2B, also called calcineurin). The PPM family consists of the Mg2+/Mn2+-dependent PP2C-like enzymes. Interestingly, the PTP family includes both tyrosine-specific and dual-specificity phosphatases (15Zhang Z.-Y. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1998; 33: 1-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Unlike tyrosine-specific PTPs, which strictly target pTyr-containing proteins, dual specificity phosphatases cleave phosphoester bonds in protein substrates that contain pTyr, as well as pSer/pThr. Biochemical studies have shown that the tyrosine-specific PTPs and the dual specificity phosphatases share a common catalytic mechanism (15Zhang Z.-Y. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1998; 33: 1-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Because phosphorylation of both Thr and Tyr in the activation loop is required to maintain optimal MAPK activity, MAPK inactivation may involve Ser/Thr protein phosphatases, PTPs, and/or dual specificity phosphatases, capable of dephosphorylating both pThr and pTyr. However, the identity of physiologically relevant protein phosphatases that inactivate each MAPK is not well established. The identification of specific phosphatases involved in MAPK regulation will facilitate the elucidation of the pathway leading to MAPK inactivation and provide insights into the precise mechanism for mitogenic/stress signaling and cellular control. In this study, we prepared ERK2 in its various phosphorylation states. We then performed detailed kinetic measurements to quantitatively examine them as substrates for a number of protein phosphatases implicated in the regulation of ERK2 activity. This has allowed us to identify the protein phosphatases that are most likely the physiological regulators of ERK2 activity. Comparison of the kinetic constants for ERK2 dephosphorylation by these different phosphatases reveals that protein phosphatases display strikingly high substrate specificity for ERK2 and provides important insights into the roles of various protein phosphatases in ERK2 kinase signaling.

The MKP5 coding DNA fragment was a generous gift from Dr. Eisuke Nishida. Recombinant MKP5 was expressed in E. coli and purified as a glutathioneS-transferase (GST) fusion protein. The catalytic domain of CD45 (containing both D1 and D2) was expressed and purified as a recombinant GST fusion protein (21Taing M. Keng Y.F. Shen K., Wu, L. Lawrence D.S. Zhang Z.-Y. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 3793-3803Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The recombinant PP1 was purchased from Sigma Chemical Co. (P-7937). The recombinant PP2B (calcineurin) and the bacteriophage λ protein Ser/Thr phosphatase (λPP) were generous gifts from Dr. Frank Rusnak. PP2A was purified form human red blood cells by a modification of the method of Usui et al.(22Usui H. Kinohara N. Yoshikawa K. Imazu M. Imaoka T. Takeda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 10455-10463Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with a final step of Mono Q chromatography to obtain the purified AC dimer. The N-terminal His6-tagged HePTP was expressed inE. coli BL21(DE3) and purified using standard procedures of nickel chelate affinity chromatography (23Zhou B. Zhang Z.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13889-13899Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The human N-terminal His6-tagged PP2Cα was expressed in E. coliBL21/DE3 using the expression vector pET28a-His6-PP2Cα (a generous gift form Dr. Mark Solomon) and purified using standard procedures of nickel chelate affinity chromatography. The protein purity was over 90% as judged by SDS-PAGE. The purified proteins were made to 20% glycerol and stored at −80 °C. The plasmid pET-His6-ERK2-MEK1(R4F) (a generous gift of Dr. Melanie Cobb) was used to co-express a constitutively active MEK1 and an N-terminal His6-tagged ERK2 in E. coliBL21(DE3). The expression and purification of ERK2/pTpY (ERK2 phosphorylated on both Thr-183 and Tyr-185) were carried out following the procedure described by Wilsbacher and Cobb (24Wilsbacher J.L. Cobb M.H. Methods Enzymol. 2001; 302: 387-400Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar). After the final fast-protein liquid chromatography step, about 1–3 mg of ERK2/pTpY were obtained from 6 liters of culture. Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry analysis confirmed that the purified ERK2/pTpY was effectively homogenous and was phosphorylated stoichiometrically to a ratio of 2 mol of phosphate per mole of ERK2. The monophosphorylated ERK2/pT and ERK2/pY were prepared by treating ERK2/pTpY with the tyrosine-specific HePTP and the Ser/Thr protein phosphatase PP2Cα, respectively, as described previously (23Zhou B. Zhang Z.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13889-13899Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar,25Zhao Y. Zhang Z.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32382-32391Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Initial rates for the hydrolysis ofpara-nitrophenyl phosphate (pNPP) by PTP1B, HePTP, CD45, VHR, MKP3, and MKP5 were measured at 30 °C in pH 7.0 buffer containing 50 mm 3,3-dimethylglutarate, 1 mm EDTA, and I = 0.15 m, as described previously (26Zhou B. Zhang Z.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35526-35534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The activities of the Ser/Thr phosphatases were determined at 30 °C in pH 7.0 buffer containing 50 mm3,3-dimethylglutarate, 0.1 mm EDTA, and I = 0.15m, in the presence of either 10 mmMgCl2 for PP2A or 2 mm MnCl2 for PP2Cα, PP1, λ-PPase, and PP2B. In addition, for PP2B, the assay mixture also contained 0.5 μm calmodulin. Kinetic parameters for the dephosphorylation of the phosphorylated ERK2 proteins were determined using a continuous spectrophotometric assay. This assay incorporates a coupled enzyme system, which uses purine nucleoside phosphorylase and its chromogenic substrate 7-methyl-6-thioguanosine (MTGuo) for the quantification of inorganic phosphate (27Webb M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4884-4887Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar) produced in the phosphatase reaction. The change in absorbance at 360 nm was due to the conversion of 7-methyl-6-thioguanosine to 7-methyl-6-thioguanine in the presence of inorganic phosphate. Quantitation of the inorganic phosphate produced in the phosphatase reaction was determined using the extinction coefficient of 11,200m−1cm−1 at 360 nm and pH 7.0. All experiments were carried out at 25 °C in a 1.6-ml reaction mixture containing 50 mm MOPS at pH 7.0, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mg/ml purine nucleoside phosphorylase (Sigma), and 50 μm MTGuo. The spectrophotometric measurements were obtained using a PerkinElmer Life Sciences Lambda 14 spectrophotometer equipped with a magnetic stirrer in the cuvette holder. MTGuo was prepared according to the procedures described by Killilea et al. (28Killilea S.D. Cheng Q. Wang Z.-X. Methods Mol. Biol. 1998; 93: 23-33PubMed Google Scholar). The concentration of MTGuo was determined at 331 nm, using a molar extinction coefficient of 32,000m−1cm−1. For the HePTP-catalyzed ERK2 dephosphorylation, the phospho-ERK2 concentration greatly exceeded that of HePTP. The kinetic parameters were obtained by fitting thev versus [S] curve to the Michaelis-Menten equation. For MKP3 and PP2Cα, the substrate (phospho-ERK2) concentration was comparable to that of the phosphatase. The kinetic parameters were obtained by fitting the v versus[S] curve to the following initial rate equation (29Segel I.H. Enzyme Kinetics. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1975: 73-74Google Scholar), v=0.5×kcat×{(Km+[E]0+[S])−[(Km+[E]0+[S])2−4×[E]0×[S]]12}(Eq. 1) For PTP1B, CD45, VHR, MKP5, PP2A, PP1, PP2B, and λPP, the substrate concentration was much lower than the Km. Under this condition, the reaction is first order with respect to [S] and at a given phosphatase concentration, the observed apparent first order rate constant is equal to (kcat/Km)[E]. Thus, thekcat/Km values for these phosphatases were obtained by fitting the progress curves to the equation, [P]=[S]0×(1−e−(kcat/Km)·[E]·t)(Eq. 2) In these measurements, the ERK2/pTpY concentration was less than 1 μm, and the concentration of the protein phosphatases ranged from 0.03 to 0.1 μm. For Thr/Ser phosphatases, the reaction mixture also contained an appropriate concentration of metal ion as specified above. For meaningful and insightful mechanistic studies of protein phosphatases, it is essential to use homogeneous phosphoproteins that correspond to the physiological substrates of the phosphatases. However, there are few detailed mechanistic studies of protein phosphatases with physiological substrates. Probably the major reasons for this are that phosphorylated proteins are notoriously difficult to prepare in sufficient quantities in a highly specific and stoichiometric form and that phosphorylated proteins are also often difficult to assay for accurate kinetic measurements. These difficulties have limited our ability to dissect the role of protein phosphatases in cellular signaling. The most commonly used approaches for studying the substrate specificity of protein phosphatases involve overexpression experiments followed by either monitoring a target reporter gene expression or in vitro assay of kinase activity/phosphorylation level in the immunoprecipitate of cellular extracts. These kinds of experiments are either indirect or nonquantitative, and they do not provide definitive information about the identity of protein phosphatases involved in certain cellular functions. Indeed, one would almost always observe substrate dephosphorylation if sufficient amount of a protein phosphatase is provided to the system. Consequently, numerous protein phosphatases have been proposed as regulators of the MAPK ERK2 based on activity measurements at a single time point and protein concentration. These results give the erroneous impression that there is a relative lack of specificity in substrate dephosphorylation by protein phosphatases. In this study, we prepared milligram quantities of phosphorylated ERK2s, developed a continuous spectrophotometric enzyme-coupled assay that measures the inorganic phosphate produced in the phosphatase reaction, and analyzed the dephosphorylation of ERK2 by 11 protein phosphatases, many of which were previously suggested as regulators of ERK2 signaling. The results lead to the identification of phosphatases that are likely in vivo regulators of ERK2 signaling and demonstrate that protein phosphatases possess exquisite specificity toward their physiological substrates. The bisphosphorylated ERK2, ERK2/pTpY (ERK2 phosphorylated on both Thr-183 and Tyr-185), was prepared by co-expression of the N-terminal His6-tagged ERK2 and a constitutively active MEK1 encoded on a single plasmid in Escherichia coli and followed by purification using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity and Mono Q anion exchange chromatography (24Wilsbacher J.L. Cobb M.H. Methods Enzymol. 2001; 302: 387-400Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The monophosphorylated ERK2/pT (ERK2 phosphorylated on Thr-183) and ERK2/pY (ERK2 phosphorylated on Tyr-185) were prepared by treating ERK2/pTpY with the tyrosine-specific HePTP and serine/threonine-specific PP2Cα, respectively (23Zhou B. Zhang Z.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13889-13899Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 25Zhao Y. Zhang Z.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32382-32391Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The homogeneity and phosphorylation stoichiometry (1 mol/mol for ERK2/pT and ERK2/pY, and 2 mol/mol for ERK2/pTpY) of the ERK2 preparations were verified by SDS-PAGE and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry as described previously (23, 25, data not shown). To facilitate the analysis of the phosphatase-catalyzed ERK2 dephosphorylation, we employed a continuous spectrophotometric enzyme-coupled assay that measures the inorganic phosphate produced in a phosphatase reaction (27Webb M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4884-4887Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar, 28Killilea S.D. Cheng Q. Wang Z.-X. Methods Mol. Biol. 1998; 93: 23-33PubMed Google Scholar). In this coupled enzyme system, the coupling enzyme, purine nucleoside phosphorylase, uses the inorganic phosphate, generated by the action of the phosphatase, to convert 7-methyl-6-thioguanosine to 7-methyl-6-thioguanine and ribose-1-phosphate (Reactions 1 and 2), resulting in an increase in absorbance at 360 nm. This reaction is essentially irreversible (27Webb M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4884-4887Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). Phosphoprotein +H2O⟶ Phosphatase ⁡ protein +P1REACTION 1 P1+7-methyl-6-thioguanosine ⟶ Purine nucleoside phosphorylase 7-methyl- 6 -thioguanine + ribose-1-phosphate REACTION 2 The effects of different levels of purine nucleoside phosphorylase on the coupled enzyme system were examined to determine the optimal amount of this enzyme required to couple the HePTP-catalyzed ERK2 dephosphorylation. As expected, at low concentrations of the coupling enzyme, an initial lag phase was observed. The lag phase decreased as the concentration of the coupling enzyme was increased (data not shown). When the concentration of the purine nucleoside phosphorylase was raised above 0.02 mg/ml, the initial lag phase disappeared completely and the linear (steady-state) phase remained unchanged with time. On the basis of these observations, the concentration of the coupling enzyme in the phosphatase assays was set to 0.1 mg/ml, which was more than adequate to rapidly utilize the inorganic phosphate released from the phosphatase reactions. Similarly, the concentration of 7-methyl-6-thioguanosine used in the coupling assay was also optimized. All kinetic parameters for the dephosphorylation of the phosphorylated ERK2 proteins by the protein phosphatases were determined using this continuous spectrophotometric assay. All experiments were carried out at 25 °C in a 1.6-ml reaction mixture containing 50 mm MOPS at pH 7.0, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mg/ml purine nucleoside phosphorylase, and 50 μm 7-methyl-6-thioguanosine. Quantitation of the inorganic phosphate produced in the phosphatase reaction was accomplished using the extinction coefficient of 11,200m−1cm−1 at 360 nm and pH 7.0. The MAPK phosphatases (MKPs) are dual specificity phosphatases capable of dephosphorylating both pTyr and pThr in the activation loop of MAPKs. In mammalian cells, at least ten MKPs have been identified. Previous studies suggest that some MKPs display distinct in vivo substrate preferences for the various MAPKs (30Camps M. Nichols A.

We showed that indeed ERK2/pTpY is a highly efficient substrate for MKP3 with akcat of 0.084 ± 0.009 s−1 and a Km of 22 ± 5 nm at pH 7.4 and 30 °C. Although the radioactive assay is effective in obtaining kinetic constants, it suffers from major disadvantages of being discontinuous and labor-intensive. To establish the utility of the continuous spectrophotometric enzyme-coupled assay to the study of protein phosphatase-catalyzed MAPK dephosphorylation, we first applied this assay to analyze the dephosphorylation of ERK2/pTpY by MKP3. Fig.1 shows typical progress curves of the MKP3-catalyzed reaction at several ERK2/pTpY concentrations. As expected, there is a nice linear correlation between the final absorbance at 360 nm (which measures the total amount of inorganic phosphate released by the action of MKP3) and the amount of ERK2/pTpY present in the reaction (Fig. 1, inset). The initial rates of the dephosphorylation reaction were determined from the slopes of the initial linear portion of the progress curves. Fig.2 displays the dependence of the initial rates of the MKP3-catalyzed reaction on ERK2/pTpY concentration. Because the concentrations of ERK2/pTpY and MKP3 were comparable in the reaction, the assumption that the free substrate concentration is equal to the total substrate concentration is not valid. Thus, the kinetic data were analyzed using the general initial velocity equation (Equation 1) (29Segel I.H. Enzyme Kinetics. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1975: 73-74Google Scholar), taking substrate depletion into account. Direct curve fitting of the data to Equation 1 yieldedkcat and Km, which were 0.140 ± 0.039 s−1 and 25 ± 5 nm, respectively, for the dephosphorylation of ERK2/pTpY by MKP3 at pH 7.0 and 25 °C (Table I). These results are similar to those determined by measuring directly the radioactive inorganic phosphate produced from the 32P-labled ERK2/pTpY (25Zhao Y. Zhang Z.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32382-32391Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) and validate the continuous spectrophotometric enzyme-coupled assay in this system. The substrate specificity constantkcat/Km for the MKP3-catalyzed ERK2/pTpY dephosphorylation (5.60 × 106m−1s−1) was more than 6 orders of magnitudes higher than that of the MKP3-catalyzedpNPP hydrolysis (2.1m−1s−1), indicating that ERK2/pTpY is a very specific substrate for MKP3.FIG. 2Dependence of the initial velocity (A360/min) on ERK2/pTpY concentration for the MKP3-catalyzed reaction. All experiments were performed at 25 °C and pH 7.0 in 50 mm MOPS, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA. 0.051 μm MKP3 was used to initiate the reaction. The inorganic phosphate released form ERK2/pTpY during the MKP3-catalyzed dephosphorylation was determined continuously by the coupled enzyme assay (see “Experimental Procedures”). The data were fitted to Equation 1 to obtain the km and kcat values.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Table IKinetic parameters of MKP3, MKP5, and VHR toward phosphorylated ERK2s and pNPPEnzymeSubstratekcatKmkcat/Kms−1μmm−1s−1MKP3ERK2/pTpY0.140 ± 0.0390.025 ± 0.005(5.60 ± 1.55) × 106MKP3ERK2/pT0.099 ± 0.0020.037 ± 0.005(2.68 ± 0.37) × 106MKP3ERK2/pY0.141 ± 0.0050.026 ± 0.006(5.42 ± 1.38) × 106MKP3pNPP0.020 ± 0.002(9.52 ± 0.45) × 1032.10 ± 0.01 MKP5ERK2/pTpY≫0.73(4.01 ± 0.04) × 104MKP5pNPP1.06 ± 0.04(9.70 ± 1.06) × 1031"

https://openalex.org/W2093619351,"Overexpression of the HMGA2 gene is a common feature of neoplastic cells both in experimental and human models. Intragenic and extragenic HMGA2 rearrangements responsible for HMGA2 gene overexpression have been frequently detected in human benign tumours of mesenchymal origin. To better understand the role of HMGA2 overexpression in human tumorigenesis, we have generated transgenic mice carrying the HMGA2 gene under the transcriptional control of the cytomegalovirus promoter. High expression of the transgene was demonstrated in all the mouse tissues analysed, whereas no expression of the endogenous HMGA2 gene was detected in the same tissues from wild-type mice. In this study, two independent lines of transgenic mice have been generated. By 6 months of age, 85% of female animals of both transgenic lines developed pituitary adenomas secreting prolactin and growth hormone. The transgenic males developed the same phenotype with a lower penetrance (40%) and a longer latency period (about 18 months). Therefore, these data demonstrate that the overexpression of HMGA2 leads to the onset of mixed growth hormone/prolactin cell pituitary adenomas. These transgenic mice may represent an important tool for the study of this kind of neoplasia."
https://openalex.org/W2025969523,"Human astrocytic brain tumors select for mutations in the p53 tumor suppressor gene early in malignant progression. p53 is activated upon various kinds of cellular stress leading to apoptosis or cell cycle arrest, but is also implicated in complex biological processes such as inhibition of angiogenesis and metastasis. In an effort to shed light on consequences mediated by p53 inactivation in gliomas, we established the Tet-On system for p53 in the LN-Z308 glioblastoma cell line. The macrophage inhibitory cytokine-1 (MIC-1) gene was identified as a most prominent p53 target gene upon gene expression profiling. Oxygen deprivation, an important cellular stress, revealed MIC-1 as an anoxia responsive gene in glioblastoma cell lines. MIC-1 up-regulation by anoxia is mediated through an alternative, p53 and hypoxia inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) independent pathway. Furthermore, ectopic expression of MIC-1 in LN-Z308 cell line completely abolished its inherent tumorigenicity in nude mice, while proliferation in vitro was not affected. In the present experimental model MIC-1 may exert its anti-tumorigenic properties via a paracrine mechanism mediated by host cells in vivo. Taken together, these data suggest that MIC-1 is an important downstream mediator of p53 function, while acting itself as an intercessor of cellular stress signaling and exerting anti-tumorigenic activities."

Each of the terminal inverted repeats (IRs) of SB contains two transposase-binding sites (DRs). This feature, termed the IR/DR structure, is conserved in a group of Tc1-like transposons. The DNA-binding region of SB transposase, similar to the paired domain of Pax proteins, consists of two helix-turn-helix subdomains (PAI + RED = PAIRED). The N-terminal PAI subdomain was found to play a dominant role in contacting the DRs. Transposase was able to bind to mutant sites retaining the 3′ part of the DRs; thus, primary DNA binding is not sufficient to determine the specificity of the transposition reaction. The PAI subdomain was also found to bind to a transpositional enhancer-like sequence within the left IR of SB, and to mediate protein-protein interactions between transposase subunits. A tetrameric form of the transposase was detected in solution, consistent with an interaction between the IR/DR structure and a transposase tetramer. We propose a model in which the transpositional enhancer and the PAI subdomain stabilize complexes formed by a transposase tetramer bound at the IR/DR.

One important form of transpositional control is represented by regulatory “checkpoints,” at which certain molecular requirements have to be fulfilled for the transpositional reaction to proceed. These requirements can operate at different stages of transposition, including the very early steps of binding of the transposase to the transposon DNA and synaptic complex assembly, the process by which the two ends of the elements are paired and held together by transposase subunits. Transposition of one of the best studied transposons, bacteriophage Mu, is tightly regulated at the level of synaptic complex assembly, which does not proceed unless certain conditions are met (1Mizuuchi M. Baker T.A. Mizuuchi K. Cell. 1992; 70: 303-311Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Transpositional enhancers in diverse recombination systems might serve as catalysts of transposon/transposase complex assembly. For example, the very N-terminal domain of Mu transposase plays an important role in transposition by binding to a transpositional enhancer, the internal activating sequence (2Leung P.C. Teplow D.B. Harshey R.M. Nature. 1989; 338: 656-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Similarly, the P element transposon ofDrosophila contains enhancer sequences (3Mullins M.C. Rio D.C. Rubin G.M. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 729-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), which are believed to transiently interact with P transposase to promote transposition (4Lee C.C. Beall E.L. Rio D.C. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4166-4174Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In the Hin recombinase system, an enhancer is bound by the bacterial accessory protein FIS, which simultaneously interacts with the recombinase bound to the recombination sites to promote assembly of the synaptic complex (5Heichman K.A. Johnson R.C. Science. 1990; 249: 511-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Eukaryotic transposons often possess protein domains that are not found in prokaryotes and vice versa. For example, members of the Tc1/mariner superfamily contain a paired box-like DNA-binding domain. The paired domain was originally described in important developmental regulatory proteins in eukaryotes, such as the Pax family of transcription factors (6Czerny T. Schaffner G. Busslinger M. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2048-2061Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar, 7Jun S. Desplan C. Development. 1996; 122: 2639-2650Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Gehring W.J. Qian Y.Q. Billeter M.

The paired domain has a bipartite structure containing two helix-turn-helix (HTH)1 motifs (PAI + RED = PAIRED) that are organized as modular DNA binding domains, and have evolved versatility in binding to a range of different DNA sequences through various combinations of these domains (6Czerny T. Schaffner G. Busslinger M. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2048-2061Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar, 7Jun S. Desplan C. Development. 1996; 122: 2639-2650Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Both subdomains might have the ability to bind DNA, but usually the N-terminal PAI subdomain has more specific DNA recognition (6Czerny T. Schaffner G. Busslinger M. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2048-2061Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). The function of the RED subdomain is not always clear; it can enforce the specificity of the PAI subdomain (7Jun S. Desplan C. Development. 1996; 122: 2639-2650Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Pellizzari L. Tell G. Damante G. Biochem. J. 1999; 337: 253-262Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or can be involved in protein targeting (10Poleev A. Okladnova O. Musti A.M. Schneider S. Royer-Pokora B. Plachov D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 860-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The nucleotide sequences recognized by the composite paired domain are degenerate; the DNA-binding specificity is relaxed (6Czerny T. Schaffner G. Busslinger M. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2048-2061Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar, 7Jun S. Desplan C. Development. 1996; 122: 2639-2650Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Pellizzari L. Tell G. Damante G. Biochem. J. 1999; 337: 253-262Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The origin of the paired domain is not clear, but phylogenetic analyses indicate that it might have been derived from an ancestral transposase (11Breitling R. Gerber J.-K. Dev. Genes Evol. 2000; 210: 644-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The vast majority of naturally occurring Tc1/mariner-like transposons are nonfunctional because of inactivating frameshift mutations, small deletions, and internal translational termination codons. In vertebrates, not a single active element has been found. Based on a comparative phylogenetic approach, we have reconstructed an active Tc1-like transposon from bits and pieces of inactive elements found in the genomes of teleost fish, and named this transposonSleeping Beauty (SB) (12Ivics Z. Hackett P.B. Plasterk R.H. Izsvák Z. Cell. 1997; 91: 501-510Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1133) Google Scholar). SB is flanked by terminal inverted repeats (IRs), which contain binding sites for the enzymatic factor of transposition, the transposase. The transposase-binding sites of SB elements are repeated twice per IR in a direct orientation (DRs). This special organization of inverted repeat, termed IR/DR, is shared by a group of Tc1-like transposons, but not by Tc1 itself (13Plasterk R.H. Izsvák Z. Ivics Z. Trends Genet. 1999; 15: 326-332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). Specific binding to the DRs is mediated by an N-terminal, paired-like DNA-binding domain of the transposase (12Ivics Z. Hackett P.B. Plasterk R.H. Izsvák Z. Cell. 1997; 91: 501-510Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1133) Google Scholar), which overlaps with a nuclear localization signal (NLS) (14Ivics Z. Izsvák Z. Minter A. Hackett P.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5008-5013Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). A GRPR-like sequence (GRRR in SB) between the two HTH motifs is conserved in Tc1/mariner transposases (13Plasterk R.H. Izsvák Z. Ivics Z.

Genet. 2000; 25: 35-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar), and is more active than other members of the Tc1/marinerfamily (21Fischer S.E.J. Wienholds E. Plasterk R.H.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6759-6764Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Because there is substantial interest in developing transposon technology for gene therapy and gene discovery, it is of importance to dissect the molecular mechanisms involved in transposition and its regulation. In this work we investigated questions related to substrate recognition, specificity and complex formation in SB transposition. We carried out a functional analysis of the DNA-binding domain of the transposase and DNA sequence motifs within the inverted repeats of SB transposons. We found that the two HTH subdomains and the GRPR-like motif are all contributing to DNA binding, with the N-terminal PAI subdomain and a 10-bp binding site core sequence having a dominant role in this process. Domain swapping experiments indicate that primary DNA binding is not sufficient to determine specificity of the transposition reaction. The PAI subdomain also binds to a transpositional enhancer-like sequence within the left inverted repeat of SB and mediates protein-protein interactions with other transposase subunits. Our findings suggest that the transpositional enhancer and the PAI subdomain of the transposase are stabilizing complexes formed by a transposase tetramer bound at the IR/DR. Enhanced stability of synaptic complexes is one possible explanation for the efficient transposition of Sleeping Beauty in vertebrate cells. The pT/neo donor construct (see 1(construct 1) in Fig. 2A) has been described previously (12Ivics Z. Hackett P.B. Plasterk R.H. Izsvák Z. Cell. 1997; 91: 501-510Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1133) Google Scholar). Constructs 2 and 3 were made by subcloning the left or the right inverted repeat sequences, respectively, into derivatives of pT/neo lacking the right or left IRs. Construct 4 was made by PCR amplification of pT/neo with primers 5′-gactatcgattatttcacttataattcactgtatc-3′ and 5′-gactatcgattgttggaaaaatgacttgtgtcatg-3′, ClaI digestion (underlined in the primer sequences) and recircularization.

Construct 7 was made with primers 5′-aatttcacttataattcactgtatcac-3′ and 5′-aatgtgtatgtaaacaattgttggaaaaatgac-3′ and recircularization. Construct 8 was made with primers 5′-gtaaacaaattattctgacatttcacattctta-3′ and 5′-agacagattatttcagcttttatttctttcatc-3′ and recircularization. Construct 9 was made by PCR amplification of the left IR of pT/neo with primers 5′-gtcattactagtcattaaaactcgtttttcaaccactccac-3′ and 5′-cattactagtcaacttagtgtatgtaaacttctgacccac-3′, digestion with SpeI, and cloning into a derivative of pT/neo containing an SpeI site downstream of the internal transposase-binding site in the left IR. Construct 10 was made by amplifying the transposon sequences from construct 2 with primer 5′-tacagttgaagtcggaagtttacatacacttaggttaattgtttacagacagattatttcac-3′, and cloning the PCR product into the SmaI site of pUC19. The plasmid containing the HDR sequence was made by cloning a double-stranded oligo into the SmaI site of pUC19. Eukaryotic expression plasmids are derivatives of the pCMV/SB construct described previously (12Ivics Z. Hackett P.B. Plasterk R.H. Izsvák Z. Cell. 1997; 91: 501-510Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1133) Google Scholar). pCMV/N57 was made by PCR-amplifying pCMV/SB with primers SV40 (5′-gctccagacatgataagatacattgatg-3′) and N57-Stop (5′-tctagaattctagcggtatgacggctgcgtggtc-3′) and recircularization. pCMV/SB-L25P was made by PCR-amplifying pCMV/SB with primers L25P/F (5′-tcatccccgggagcaatttccaaacgcctg-3′) and L25P/R (5′-ttgctcccggggatgaaccagacttgtggagg-3′), followed bySmaI digestion (underlined in the primer sequences) and recircularization. pCMV/SB-PD was made by PCR amplifying pCMV/SB with primers FTC-3 (12Ivics Z.

Bacterial expression vectors pET21a/N57, pET21a/N64, pET21a/N115, pET21a/N123, pET21a/N123(L25P), and pET21a/58–123 were made by PCR amplification of the corresponding fragments of the transposase gene, cutting the PCR products with NdeI and XhoI (underlined in the primer sequences), and cloning them into the respective sites in pET21a (Novagen). Primers were the following: SB-Start/NdeI (5′-tatacatatgggaaaatcaaaagaaatcagcc-3′); N57/XhoI (5′-tctactcgaggcggtatgacggctgcgtggtc-3′); N64/XhoI (5′-gctatactcgagaacgcgtctccttcctgagc-3′); N115/XhoI (5′-gctatactcgaggcggcctttcaggttatgtcg-3′); N123/XhoI (5′-ggtgctcgagcagtggcttcttccttg-3′); 58–123-Start/NdeI (5′-gctatacatatgtcaggaaggagacgcgttctg-3′). pET21a-HD was made by PCR amplification from pCMV/SB-HD with primers SB-Start/NdeI and N123/XhoI and cloning into the respective sites of vector pET21a after digestion with NdeI and XhoI. pET21a-PD was made in a similar way after amplification from pCMV/SB-PD with primer 5′-tatacatatggtaaaatctgttgggtgtaaaaatc-3′ and N123/XhoI. Induction of His-tagged, recombinant protein expression was in Escherichia colistrain BL21(DE3) (Novagen) by the addition of 0.4 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 0.5 optical density at 600 nm and continued for 2.5 h at 30 °C. Cells were sonicated in H-buffer (25 mm HEPES (pH 7.6), 15% glycerol, 0.25% Tween 20) containing 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1m NaCl, 1× COMPLETE (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and 20 mm imidazole (pH 8.0) was added to the soluble fraction before it was mixed with Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid resin (Qiagen) according to the recommendations of the manufacturer. The resin was washed with sonication buffer containing 30% glycerol and 50 mm imidazole; bound proteins were eluted with sonication buffer containing 300 mm imidazole and dialyzed overnight at 4 °C against a buffer containing 100 mm NaCl and 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.5). The second step in purification of N123 for molecular mass determination and sedimentation equilibrium analysis involved a Mono S column (Amersham Biosciences); a linear gradient was run from 50 to 1000 mm NaCl over 20 ml. Protein was eluted at ∼500 mm NaCl. Overnight dialysis was carried out against 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.6) and 50 mm NaCl in a membrane with molecular mass cutoff of 3.5 kDa. N-terminal sequencing showed that the first terminal methionine was missing. Double-stranded oligonucleotides were made by mixing in equimolar ratios two single-stranded oligos, boiling, and annealing by slow cooling. The double-stranded oligo for the sedimentation equilibrium experiments was purified on a Mono Q column (Amersham Biosciences) in 10 mmTris (pH 7.6) with a NaCl gradient. The peak fractions were pooled and rebuffered in 5 mm HEPES (pH 7.6) and 50 mmNaCl. For EMSA, either double-stranded oligos or an ∼350-bpEcoRI fragment comprising the left inverted repeat of the element (Fig. 6C) were end-labeled using [α-32P]dATP and Klenow. Nucleoprotein complexes were formed in 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol in a total volume of 10 μl. Reactions contained 0.2 pmol of labeled oligo or 100 pg of labeled fragment, 1 μg of poly(dI)·(dC), and 0.05 pmol of peptide. After a 15-min incubation on ice, 5 μl of loading dye containing 50% glycerol and bromphenol blue was added, and the samples loaded onto a 5% polyacrylamide gel. Methylation interference was done as described (22Colloms S.D. van Luenen H.G. Plasterk R.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 5548-5554Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Molecular mass determination was performed in a XL-A type analytical ultracentrifuge (Beckman) equipped with UV absorbance optics, using a 36-bp-long double-stranded oligonucleotide containing the SB binding site (DNA 36, 5′-caacctaagtgtatgtaaacttccgacttcaactgt-3′) and N123 protein. Sedimentation equilibrium experiments were done using externally loaded six-channel cells with 12-mm optical path length and the capacity to handle three solvent-solution pairs of ∼70 μl of liquid. Sedimentation equilibrium was reached after 2 h of overspeed at 24,000 rpm followed by an equilibrium speed of 20,000 rpm for ∼30 h at 10 °C. Depending on the loading concentration, the radial absorbance in each compartment was recorded at three different wavelengths between 240 and 290 nm using the molar absorbance coefficients. Molecular mass determinations employed the global fit of three radial distributions described by Equation 1, using the program POLYMOLE (23Behlke J. Ristau O. Schonfeld H.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 5149-5156Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In these equations ρ is the solvent density,vρ is the partial specific volume, ω is the angular velocity, R is the gas constant, and T is the absolute temperature.

In each experiment, three absorbance profiles obtained at three different wavelengths were analyzed to determine the equilibrium constant, the stoichiometry of the reaction, as well as the partial concentrations (ci) of reactants and complexes using POLYMOLE. Based on the partial concentrations and the molecular masses (Mi) of free reactants and complexes, the weight-average molecular masses (Mw) for the different mixtures were calculated by Equation 2.Mw=Σci·Mi/ΣciEquation 2 Reactions were performed in 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 5 mm MgCl2, 250 μg of bovine serum albumin, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 100 mm NaCl, and 6 μm SB derivatives in a final volume of 20 μl for 15 min on ice without the cross-linker. Then bis(sulfosuccinimidyl) suberate (BS3, Pierce) was added in concentrations noted in the figures, and reactions were incubated for additional 15 min at room temperature. The reaction was stopped by adding 0.5 mm glycine, and products were separated by SDS-PAGE and Western-blotted as described in Ref. 18Izsvák Z. Ivics Z. Plasterk R.H. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 302: 93-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar. HeLa cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, seeded onto six-well plates 1 day prior to transfection. Plasmid DNAs were purified through Qiagen columns. Cells were transfected with 150 ng of DNA/plasmid, using FuGENE transfection reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Selection and staining were done as previously described (12Ivics Z. Hackett P.B. Plasterk R.H. Izsvák Z. Cell. 1997; 91: 501-510Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1133) Google Scholar). The left and right IRs of SB are not identical in sequence, raising the possibility that they are not functionally equivalent. To test this, we generated SB versions that have two left IRs or two right IRs flanking a neomycin resistance gene (neo). We assessed the relative transpositional efficiencies of these transposons in an in vivo transposition assay, which is based on cotransfection of a transposon donor plasmid and a transposase-expressing helper plasmid into cultured cells (Fig. 1) (12Ivics Z. Hackett P.B. Plasterk R.H. Izsvák Z. Cell. 1997; 91: 501-510Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1133) Google Scholar). Cells are then placed under G-418 selection, and numbers of resistant colonies counted. The ratio between numbers obtained in the presence and absence of transposase (Fig. 1) is the readout of the assay, and is a measure of the efficiency of transposition. Transposons flanked by two left IRs (2 (construct 2) in Fig.2A) showed an almost 3-fold increase in transpositional efficiency compared with the wild-type element with one left and one right IR (construct 1). In contrast, transposons flanked by two right IRs (construct 3) showed severely reduced transposition: ∼12% of wild-type rates. These data indicate that the two IRs of SB are functionally not equivalent, and that the left IR contains sequences that are required for high efficiency transposition. Inspection of the left IR of the transposon revealed the presence of a 11-bp sequence that resembles the 3′-half of a transposase-binding site (DR) (Fig. 2B). Sequence motifs analogous to this “half-site” (HDR for half DR) can also be detected in two other Tc1-like transposons, the S and Bari1 elements inDrosophila (Fig. 2B), but not in other Tc1-like transposons. Whereas the HDR sequence is present only in the left IR of SB, these fly transposons have HDRs in both of their IRs. Because of its evolutionary conservation among transposons in phylogenetically distant species, we predicted that the HDR has some function in the transposition of these elements. To address whether the HDR has a role in transposition, it was deleted from the IR, which decreased transposition frequency to ∼15% (4 (construct 4) in Fig. 2A). Introducing point mutations into the HDR (construct 5) had a comparable effect, indicating that it is not just the spacing between the transposase-binding sites, but the sequence of the HDR that is important for transposition. Introducing a HDR on a separate molecule by cotransfecting a HDR-containing plasmid together with HDR-mutant transposons (construct 6) resulted in only a small increase of transposition frequency, indicating that the HDR sequence acts preferentially in cis. The HDR in SB elements does not exactly match the 3′-half of the DR (Fig. 2B). Replacing the HDR with the exact sequence of the 3′-half of the DR (construct 7) did not reveal the significance of this difference, because this engineered element transposes at approximately wild-type level. Introducing a HDR into the right IR (construct 8), thereby doubling the signal and mimicking the structure of S and Bari1 elements, increased transposition efficiency by ∼2-fold. However, doubling the complete left IR (including one DR and one HDR in construct 9) did not affect transposition rates, indicating that a mere increase in the number of transposase-binding sites and HDRs flanking the element does not influence transposition. Furthermore, moving the outer transposase-binding site into proximity (50 bp distance) of the internal site (construct 10) abolished transposition. This result indicates that the presence of four DRs and two HDRs is not sufficient for transposition, and that these sequences need to be in a proper context within the inverted repeats to allow transposition to proceed. Taken together, our results indicate that the HDR within the left IR of SB elements has an enhancer-like function, which is necessary for efficient transposition. Although the HDR has sequence similarity only to the 3′-region of transposase-binding sites, we hypothesized that it nevertheless can be contacted by the transposase. With the goal of mapping subdomain boundaries within the DNA-binding region, we expressed histidine-tagged, truncated derivatives of the transposase; N57 contains only the PAI subdomain (the N-terminal HTH of thepaired domain), N64 contains the PAI subdomain plus the GRRR motif, “58–123” contains the RED subdomain (the C-terminal HTH of the paired domain) plus the GRRR motif and the NLS, N115 contains the two predicted HTH motifs of the complete bipartite DNA-binding domain, and N123 contains the complete DNA-binding domain and the NLS (Fig. 3A). Specific base pair contacts with the transposase DNA-binding domain were examined using methylation interference analysis of DNA-protein interactions (Fig. 3B). Either of the two strands of oligonucleotides containing the full transposase-binding site (Fig. 3,B and C) were radioactively labeled, treated with dimethyl sulfate, and incubated with the transposase polypeptides at two different concentrations. Free and protein-bound DNA fractions were isolated, cleaved at methylated positions by alkali boiling, and run on denaturing polyacrylamide gels. Methylation of purine bases on both strands of the DNA interfered with binding of N57 to the 3′-portion of the transposase-binding site, between base positions 17–26 (Fig. 3C). Therefore, the PAI subdomain has the potential to also bind to the HDR motif. Interference with binding of N64, which contains the GRRR motif in addition to the PAI subdomain, extended to the two adenine residues 5′ to the N57 binding region. Binding at these sequences is compatible with the GRRR motif being an AT-hook, contacting the DNA in the minor groove of A-T base pairs (15Aravind L. Landsman D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 4413-4421Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). As expected, N115 and N123, both containing the complete bipartite DNA-binding domain of the transposase, showed interference covering a larger region of the probe, between base positions 6 and 25, confirming that the RED subdomain is responsible for contacting the 5′-portion of the transposase-binding site. “58–123” alone is capable of binding to DNA, albeit with reduced specificity, because we detected interference between positions 6 and 15 and also in the 3′-region of the binding site, at position 23. Interference at the 5′-region of the probe was generally weaker than at the 3′-region, suggesting dominant contacts between the PAI subdomain and a core binding region 5′-TTTACATACA-3′, and a role of the RED subdomain in modulating sequence specificity of overall DNA binding at the ends of the transposon. In summary, the PAI subdomain has two types of binding site within the transposon IRs: the DRs, to which it binds together with the RED subdomain, and the HDR, to which it has the potential to bind alone. The above experiments suggested that the role of the RED subdomain is to ensure specificity of transposase binding to its binding sites within the transposon. To test this prediction, we generated hybrid transposase DNA-binding domains by exchanging either the PAI or the RED subdomains of the SB and Tc1 transposases, and fused these domains at the AT-hook motifs present in both of these proteins (Fig. 4A). Protein PD contains the Tc1 PAI subdomain fused to the SB RED subdomain, whereas protein RD contains the reciprocal fusion. Along with the protein hybrids, we designed hybrid oligonucleotide substrates containing the binding regions of the respective domains of the two transposases. Oligo PD has its 5′ part from the SB binding site, and its 3′ part from the Tc1 binding si"
https://openalex.org/W2319415470,"A central role for polo-like kinases (PLK) in regulating several stages of mitotic progression has been born out in several species. Overexpression of PLK1 is observed in the majority of hitherto analysed human tumors. PLK1 overexpression is a negative prognostic factor in patients suffering from non-small cell lung cancer, head and neck tumors, esophageal carcinomas and melanomas. In order to define the role of PLK1 for mitotic progression of human cells and for neoplastic cell growth, phosphorothioate antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) were tested to selectively downregulate PLK1 expression in MDA-MB-435 (breast cancer), HeLa S3 (cervical carcinoma) and A549 (non-small cell lung cancer) cells. ASOs were identified which suppress PLK1 mRNA and protein in a dose-dependent and sequence-specific manner. This approach also led to reduced PLK1 serine/threonine kinase activity. Downregulation of cellular PLK1 levels in cancer cells altered cell cycle progression moderately with an elevated percentage (20-30%) of cells in G(2)/M. Furthermore, cells with reduced PLK1 protein gained a rounded phenotype with multiple centrosomes. Moreover, ASO treatment resulted in potent antiproliferative effects in cell culture. Considerable antitumor activity was observed in vivo against A549 cells. This study suggests that antisense inhibitors targeted against PLK1 at well tolerated doses may be considered as a cancer therapeutic agent."
https://openalex.org/W2139009702,"Nur77/NR4A1 is an “orphan member” of the nuclear hormone receptor superfamily. Nur77 and its close relatives Nurr1 and NOR-1 bind as monomers to a consensus binding site, the nerve growth factor induced protein I-B (NGFI-B)-binding response element (NBRE). The Nur77/NURR1/NOR1 nuclear receptors are classified as immediate early response genes which are induced through multiple signal transduction pathways. They have been implicated in cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. However, the mechanism of coactivation and ligand independent trans-activation remains unclear. Hence we examined the molecular basis of Nur77-mediated cofactor recruitment and activation. We observed that Nur77 trans-activates gene expression in a cell-specific manner, and operates in an activation function-1 (AF-1)-dependent manner. The AB region encodes an uncommonly potent N-terminal AF-1 domain delimited to between amino acids 50 and 160 and is essential for the ligand-independent activation of gene expression. Steroid receptor coactivator-2 (SRC-2) modulates the activity of the N-terminal AF-1 domain. Moreover, SRC-2 dramatically potentiates the retinoid induced RXR-dependent activation of the Nur77 ligand binding domain (LBD). Interestingly, the N-terminal AB region (not the LBD) facilitates coactivator recruitment and directly interacts with SRC, p300, PCAF, and DRIP-205. Consistent with this, homology modeling indicated that the Nur77 LBD coactivator binding cleft was substantially different from that of retinoic acid receptor γ, a closely related AF-2-dependent receptor. In particular, the hydrophobic cleft characteristic of nuclear receptors was replaced with a much more hydrophilic surface with a distinct topology. This observation accounts for the inability of this nuclear receptor LBD to directly mediate cofactor recruitment. Furthermore, the AF-1 domain physically associates with the Nur77 C-terminal LBD and synergizes with the retinoid X receptor LBD. Thus, the AF-1 domain plays a major role in Nur77-mediated transcriptional activation, cofactor recruitment, and intra- and intermolecular interactions.

The importance of NRs in human physiology is underscored by the extensive pharmacopoeia that has been created to combat disorders associated with dysfunctional hormone signaling. These diseases affect every discipline of medicine (2Chawla A. Repa J.J. Evans R.M. Mangelsdorf D.J. Science. 2001; 294: 1866-1870Crossref PubMed Scopus (1659) Google Scholar). All members of the NR superfamily display a highly conserved structural organization (1Steinmetz A.C. Renaud J.P. Moras D. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2001; 30: 329-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar) with an N-terminal region AB (which encodes activation function-1, AF-1) followed by the C-region (which encodes the DNA binding domain (DBD)), a linker region D, and the C-terminal E region. The DE region encodes the ligand binding domain (LBD) and a transcriptional domain, denoted as activation function-2 (AF-2) (1Steinmetz A.C. Renaud J.P. Moras D. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2001; 30: 329-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 2Chawla A. Repa J.J. Evans R.M. Mangelsdorf D.J. Science. 2001; 294: 1866-1870Crossref PubMed Scopus (1659) Google Scholar). A decade ago, gene products were identified which appeared to belong to the NR superfamily on the basis of their nucleic acid sequence identity. The endogenous signaling molecules that bound to these proteins were unknown, and thus the term “orphan receptor” was coined. Based on members of the NR superfamily which have been characterized more fully, the orphans forecast an enormous yet unexploited opportunity for the discovery of important new therapeutic agents. The potential impact of such a discovery cannot be overstated because every known NR has been implicated in human disease. The Nur77, Nurr1, and NOR-1 (NR4A1–3 subgroup) family of orphan NRs is well conserved in the DBD (∼91–95%) and the C-terminal LBD (∼60%), but it is divergent in the N-terminal AB region. This subgroup of proteins functions as immediate-early response genes that are induced by a wide range of physiological signals (3Hazel T.G. Nathans D. Lau L.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In itself, the NR4A1–3 subgroup presents an exciting scientific challenge, and unlocking the molecular mechanisms that mediate NR4A-dependent transcription will provide a potential platform for pharmacological intervention. Nur77 has been shown to play a key role in regulating expression of various genes in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA) related to inflammation and steroidogenesis (20Fernandez P.M.

FitzGerald O. Arthritis Rheum. 2001; 44: 782-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The Nur77 family can regulate steroid 21-hydroxylase, steroid 17-hydroxylase, and the 20α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase promoters (21Stocco C.O. Lau L.F. Gibori G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3293-3302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 22Crawford P.A. Sadovsky Y. Woodson K. Lee S.L. Milbrandt J. Mol. Cell.

Nur77 is expressed in skeletal muscle (23Law S.W. Conneely O.M. DeMayo F.J. O'Malley B.W. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 2129-2135Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar) and mouse myoblasts in culture (24Yang W.L. Lim R.W. Biochem.

Moreover, basic fibroblast growth factor, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate, and forskolin agonists induce Nur77 expression in mouse myoblasts. Early studies demonstrated that Nur77 expression in muscle appeared to be dependent to different extents on the activation of protein kinase A, C, and mitogen-activated protein kinase. β-Adrenergic agonists transiently induce Nur77 in mouse myoblasts (24Yang W.L.

The NR4A family members can bind as monomers and as homodimers to single/tandem copies of the NR4A response element, AAAGGTCA, a variant NR half-site, and constitutively regulate transcription (28Wilson T.E.

Moreover, Nur77 and Nurr1 (but not NOR-1) heterodimerize with RXR and mediate efficient trans-activation in response to RXR-specific agonists from DR5 motifs (31Forman B.M. Umesono K. Chen J. Evans R.M. Cell. 1995; 81: 541-550Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar, 32Perlmann T. Jansson L.

The NR4A subgroup functions as immediate-early response genes, which suggests cross-talk between multiple classes of stimuli and retinoid-dependent signaling. Moreover, phosphorylation of Nur77 regulates retinoid signaling by controlling the subcellular localization and nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling of RXR (7Katagiri Y. Takeda K., Yu, Z.X. Ferrans V.J. Ozato K. Guroff G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 435-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). In addition, serine and threonine residues in Nur77 have been demonstrated to be critical in the activity, function, and localization of the NR4A members (5Hazel T.G. Misra R. Davis I.J.

This receptor subgroup has proven to be refractory to the understanding of coactivator recruitment in the process of constitutive trans-activation and retinoid-induced RXR-dependent regulation (31Forman B.M. Umesono K. Chen J. Evans R.M. Cell. 1995; 81: 541-550Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar, 32Perlmann T. Jansson L.

Moreover, the Nur77 LBD lacks an intrinsic and classical activation domain, and the serine/threonine-rich domain in the N terminus has been implicated in the regulation of Nur77-dependent transcription (36Paulsen R.E. Weaver C.A. Fahrner T.J. Milbrandt J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16491-16496Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, the N-terminal AB region has been implicated in growth factor-dependent nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling of this NR (7Katagiri Y. Takeda K., Yu, Z.X. Ferrans V.J. Ozato K. Guroff G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 435-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). In summary, the N-terminal AF-1 region, the C-terminal LBD, and AF-2 domain of the Nur77 subgroup are very unusual. Nur77 lacks an archetypal AF-2 transcriptional activation domain and does not seem to interact with NR cofactors; notwithstanding these comments, this orphan modulates transcription. Currently, the molecular aspects of transcriptional activation remain obscure; furthermore, structural analysis of the LBD and mechanistic analysis of Nur77 function have not been undertaken with respect to intramolecular interactions and cofactor recruitment. We have demonstrated and analyzed the functional role of AF-1 in mouse NR4A1 (Nur77)-mediated trans-activation, further elucidated the molecular basis of retinoid-induced RXR-dependent trans-activation by Nur77, and provided a transcriptional, biochemical, and structural analysis of coactivator function and recruitment. Proliferating C2C12 cells and COS-1 cells were kept in DMEM supplemented with 20 and 10% fetal calf serum (FCS), respectively, in 6% CO2. Cells grown in 12-well dishes to 60–70% confluence were transiently transfected with 0.33–1 μg of pGL2b-tk-LUC (37Chen S.L. Dowhan D.H. Hosking B.M. Muscat G.E.O.

Generation of full-length mouse Nur77 was performed by reverse transcription-PCR from muscle RNA withPfu DNA polymerase (Promega), using the manufacturer’s buffer. All PCR products were cloned into the EcoRI site of pSG5 (Stratagene) and then isolated after EcoRI digestion and subsequently cloned into pGAL0 and pGEX4T1 (Amersham Biosciences). The primers (GENEWORKS Australia) used for the synthesis of full-length mouse Nur77 were GMUQ-713 5′-GCG GAA TTC ACC ATG CCC TGT ATT CAA GCT CAA and GMUQ-714 3′-GCG GAA TTC TCA GAA AGA CAA TGT GTC CAT. We then synthesized additional primers to subclone the DE, AB, ABC, and CDE regions into pSG5 and GAL0. The primers used for the DE were GMUQ-715 5′-GCG GAA TTC ACC ATG CGG CGG AAC CGC TGC CAG and GMUQ-714 3′. The primers used to synthesize the AB region were GMUQ-713 5′ and GMUQ-716 3′-GCG GAA TTC TCA CTC GCT GCC ACC TGA AGC CCC. The primers used to synthesize the ABC region were GMUQ-713 5′ and GMUQ-717 3′-GCG GAA TTC TCA CAG GCG GAG GAT GAA GAG. The primers used to synthesize the CDE region were GMUQ-718 5′-GCG GAA TTC ACC ATG TGT GCA GTC TGT GGT GAC and GMUQ-714 3′. We subsequently constructed various subdomains of the AB region by PCR and cloned these segments into the EcoRI/SalI site of GAL4. The Nur77AB-aa1–110 was subjected to PCR and cloned into SV40-GAL0 using primers GMUQ-713 5′ and GMUQ-719 3′-GCG GTC GAC TCA CAC CTG GAA GTC CTC. The Nur77AB-aa110–200 region was subjected to PCR and cloned into SV40-GAL0 using primers GMUQ-720 5′-GCG GAA TTC ACC ATG TAC GGC TGC TAC CCG and GMUQ-721 3′-GCG GTC GAC TCA GCC AGT GGG AGG.

The Nur77AB-aa1–160 region was subjected to PCR and cloned into SV40-GAL0 using primers GMUQ-713 5′ and GMUQ-724 3′-GCG GTC GAC TCA AAA TGA GCC GTC CCA. The Nur77AB-aa55–160 region was subjected to PCR and cloned into SV40-GAL0 using primers GMUQ-725 5′-GCG GAA TTC ACC ATG TTC ATG GAC GGG and GMUQ-724 3′. We then synthesized several primers for site-directed mutagenesis and used the Stratagene QuikChange multisite-directed mutagenesis kit as per the manufacturer’s instructions to produce GAL4-Nur77AB chimeras that simultaneously carried double, triple, and quadruple amino acid mutations. Nur77AB mutant primers were synthesized and 5′-phosphorylated by GENEWORKS Australia. The primers made were S54A/T55A-GMUQ-726 5′-CTG CCC AGC TTC GCA GCC TTC ATG GAC GGG, S54P/T55P-GMUQ-727 5′-CTG CCC AGC TTC CCA CCC TTC ATG GAC GGG, S142A/T145A-GMUQ-728 5′-TCA GCC CCC GCA CCA TCTGCA CCC AAC TTC C, and S142P/T145P-GMUQ-729 5′-TCA GCC CCCCCC CCA TCT CCA CCC AAC TTC C.

The GST fusion proteins were analyzed on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels for integrity and to normalize the amount of each protein. The Promega TNT-coupled transcription-translation system was used to produce [35S]methionine-labeled Nur77 and coactivator proteins that were visualized by SDS-PAGE. In vitro binding assays were performed with glutathione-agarose beads (Sigma) coated with ∼500 ng of GST fusion protein and 2–10 μl of [35S]methionine-labeled protein in 200 μl of binding buffer containing 100 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 5 μg of ethidium bromide, and 100 μg of bovine serum albumin. The reaction was allowed to proceed for 1–2 h at 4 °C with rocking. The affinity beads were then collected by centrifugation and washed five times with 1 ml of binding buffer without ethidium bromide and bovine serum albumin. The beads were resuspended in 20 μl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer and boiled for 5 min. The eluted proteins were fractionated by SDS-PAGE, and the gel was treated with Amersham Amplify fluor, dried at 70 °C, and autoradiographed. A model of the Nur77 LBD was constructed using the program Modeler 6.0 with the RARγ LBD as a template. The resulting model was subject to Ramachandran analysis and further quality checking with the WhatIf suite of programs (www.cmbi.kun.nl/swift/whatcheck/). Hydrophobic surface analysis was conducted in SCULPT 3.0. Initial peptide superimposition was achieved using SPDBV V3.7, and structures were raytraced with the freeware program Persistence of Vision:POV-Ray (www.povray.org) and the Macintosh patch MacmegaPov (users.skynet.be/cgi-bin/formd.cgi). Further analysis of peptide docking using a spherical polar Fourier correlation docking simulation program was performed using the program HEX (47Marti-Renom M.A. Stuart A. Fiser A. Sánchez R.

We performed reverse transcription-PCR experiments using total RNA extracted from C2C12 skeletal muscle cells to isolate full-length Nur77 cDNA. To verify the integrity of the cloned NR after full-length sequencing we examined the ability of Nur77 to trans-activate a Nur77-dependent reporter gene, NBRE3-tk-LUC (NBRE derived from the monomeric consensus binding site AAAGGTCA). This plasmid contains three copies of a consensus binding site (AAAGGTCA) cloned upstream of the heterologous herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase promoter (31Forman B.M. Umesono K. Chen J.

Little is known about the genetic alterations that result in IBC. In our previous work, we found that WISP3 was specifically lost in human IBC tumors when compared to stage-matched, non-IBC tumors. We hypothesize that WISP3 has tumor suppressor function in the breast and that it may be a key genetic alteration that contributes to the unique IBC phenotype. The full-length WISP3 cDNA was sequenced and cloned into an expression vector. The resulting construct was introduced in to the SUM149 cell line that was derived from a patient with IBC and lacks WISP3 expression. In soft agar, stable WISP3 transfectants formed significantly fewer colonies than the controls. Stable WISP3 transfectants lost their ability to invade and had reduced angiogenic potential. WISP3 transfection was effective in suppressing in vivo tumor growth in nude mice. Mice bearing WISP3 expressing tumors had a significantly longer survival than those with vector-control transfectant tumors. Our data demonstrate that WISP3 acts as a tumor suppressor gene in the breast. Loss of WISP3 expression contributes to the phenotype of IBC by regulating tumor cell growth, invasion and angiogenesis."

Here we have employed the phorbol ester-induced multistage skin carcinogenesis protocol in mice to determine the expression of both genes in inflamed skin and in skin tumors. We show that expression is coordinately induced by the phorbol ester TPA in epithelial cells as well as infiltrating leukocytes. By comparing S100A8 and S100A9 mRNA levels in wild type and c-Fos deficient mice (c-fos(-/-)) we found that expression is negatively regulated by c-Fos/AP-1. Glucocorticoids, which exhibit potent anti-inflammatory and anti-tumor promoting activities repressed TPA-mediated S100A8 and S100A9 induction in wild type, but not in c-fos(-/-) mice, thus identifying both genes as the first examples of AP-1 target genes whose repression of TPA-induced transcription by glucocorticoids depends on c-Fos. Finally, we show that enhanced expression is not restricted to the initial TPA-induced inflammatory response but is observed at all stages of skin carcinogenesis. These data identify S100A8 and S100A9 as novel, tumor-associated genes and may point to an as yet unrecognized function of both genes in the development of epithelial skin tumors."
https://openalex.org/W2103314962,"Thiazolidinediones (TZDs) are widely used for treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) is the molecular target of TZDs and is believed to mediate the apoptotic effects of this class of drugs in a variety of cell types, including B and T lymphocytes. The finding that TZDs induce lymphocyte death has raised concerns regarding whether TZDs might further impair immune functions in diabetics. To address this issue, we investigated the roles of PPARγ and TZDs in lymphocyte survival. PPARγ was up-regulated upon T cell activation. As previously reported, PPARγ agonists induced T cell death in a dose-dependent manner. However, the concentrations of TZD needed to cause T cell death were above those needed to induce PPARγ-dependent transcription. Surprisingly, at concentrations that induce optimal transcriptional activation, TZD activation of PPARγ protected cells from apoptosis following growth factor withdrawal. The survival-enhancing effects depended on both the presence and activation of PPARγ. Measurements of mitochondrial potential revealed that PPARγ activation enhanced the ability of cells to maintain their mitochondrial potential. These data indicate that activation of PPARγ with TZDs can promote cell survival and suggest that PPARγ activation may potentially augment the immune responses of diabetic patients.

Approximately 100 million people worldwide, including 16 million people in the United States, suffer from diabetes. With about 54,000 deaths per year, it represents the seventh leading cause of death in the United States. The major causes of morbidity and mortality are results of long term complications of hyperglycemia, involving heart, kidneys, eyes, nerves, and the immune system. Among the diabetic population, 80–90% are affected by type 2 diabetes, in which impaired tissue sensitivity to insulin is the primary metabolic defect. Thiazolidinediones (TZDs1; “glitazones”) are a new class of synthetic compounds that potentiate insulin action in the target tissues, alleviate hyperglycemia, and are efficacious in treating type 2 diabetes (see Refs. 1Henry R.R. Endocrinol. Metab. Clin. North Am. 1997; 26: 553-573Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar and 2Spencer C.M. Markham A.

At the molecular level, these compounds function as highly specific pharmacologic ligands of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) (4Lehmann J.M. Moore L.B. Smith-Oliver T.A.

PPARs are members of the nuclear hormone receptor superfamily. There are three isoforms of PPARs, α, δ (also known as β), and γ. Among them, PPARγ is of particular interest, because, in addition to diabetes, it has been implicated in several other significant human pathological conditions, including atherosclerosis, cancer, and inflammation (5Vamecq J. Latruffe N. Lancet. 1999; 354: 141-148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar, 6Kersten S. Desvergne B. Wahli W. Nature. 2000; 405: 421-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (1678) Google Scholar). Like other members of the nuclear receptor family, PPARγ serves as a transcription factor. Upon ligand binding, the receptor undergoes a conformational change. This disrupts a corepressor complex and leads to coactivator recruitment and transcriptional activation. PPARγ functions as a heterodimer with retinoid X receptor α, binding to a specific direct repeat DNA sequence and regulating many target genes involved in lipid metabolism. PPARγ is most abundantly expressed in adipose tissue and colon epithelial cells. It is also broadly expressed in many other tissues including, but not limited to, bone marrow precursors, monocytes/macrophages, lymphocytes, pneumocytes, breast epithelial cells, hepatocytes, and myocytes (7Auwerx J. Diabetologia. 1999; 42: 1033-1049Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar). Studies of the cellular functions of PPARγ have thus far been focused mainly on adipose tissue and macrophages. In adipose tissue, PPARγ promotes adipogenesis by activating transcription of its target genes, such as adipocyte protein 2, lipoprotein lipase, and acyl-CoA synthetase (reviewed in Refs. 8Lowell B.B. Cell. 1999; 99: 239-242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar and9Rangwala S.M. Lazar M.A. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 2000; 20: 535-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). In foamy macrophages of the vasculature, PPARγ reduces lipid accumulation by affecting cholesterol flux in the cells through transcriptional regulation of scavenger receptors and reverse cholesterol transporters (10Moore K.J.

It has been shown in human and murine T cells that treatment with PPARγ ligand leads to inhibition of T cell proliferation and a decrease in interleukin-2 (IL-2) production (14Clark R.B.

In animal models, ligands of PPARγ, including 15-deoxy-Δ12,14-prostaglandin J2(15d-PGJ2) and troglitazone, are also effective against inflammatory diseases, alleviating rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease (17Kawahito Y.

It is, however, unclear whether the anti-inflammatory effects of TZD drugs are mediated through PPARγ. Using PPARγ-deficient embryonic stem cells, several groups have shown that in monocytes/macrophages, inhibition of cytokine production and proinflammatory gene expression by both 15d-PGJ2 and TZDs is independent of PPARγ (10Moore K.J.

In addition, non-TZD-derived PPARγ agonists do not inhibit the production of proinflammatory cytokines in activated macrophages (19Thieringer R. Fenyk-Melody J.E., Le Grand C.B. Shelton B.A. Detmers P.A. Somers E.P. Carbin L. Moller D.E. Wright S.D. Berger J. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 1046-1054Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). In lymphocytes, some studies have reported that treatment of cells with certain PPARγ ligands induces apoptosis in both T and B cells (15Padilla J. Kaur K. Cao H.J. Smith T.J. Phipps R.P. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 6941-6948Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar,20Harris S.G. Phipps R.P. Eur. J. Immunol. 2001; 31: 1098-1105Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), suggesting that PPARγ might be involved in the down-regulation of immune responses through the induction of lymphocyte death. These findings have significant implications, since millions of type 2 diabetic patients are currently taking TZDs to control their hyperglycemia and prevent complications. A serious concern is that TZDs might further impair the already compromised immune functions in these patients. We therefore set out to investigate the roles of PPARγ in lymphocyte survival. C57BL/6 mice were purchased from the Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). 2C T cell receptor transgenic/RAG2−/− mice have been previously described (21Frauwirth K.A. Alegre M.L. Thompson C.B. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 2987-2993Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). All mice were maintained in the University of Pennsylvania Animal Barrier Facilities (Philadelphia, PA). Animals received humane care in compliance with the “Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals” published by the National Institutes of Health (Bethesda, MD). Rosiglitazone was obtained as a generous gift from GlaxoSmithKline, and ciglitazone was purchased from Biomol(Plymouth Meeting, PA). Sources of all other reagents are indicated below. T cells were purified from human peripheral blood or mouse spleen by negative selection using StemSepTM magnetic columns (StemCell Technologies, Vancouver, Canada) following the manufacturer's instructions. A purity of 95–99% was normally obtained with this method. Cells were then cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with glutamine, penicillin/streptomycin, HEPES buffer, minimal essential medium nonessential amino acids (Invitrogen), β-mercaptoethanol, and 10% fetal bovine serum (Mediatech, Inc., Herndon, VA). For T cell stimulation with anti-CD3 (145-2C11; BD PharMingen, San Diego, CA) alone or anti-CD3 plus anti-CD28 (37.51; BD PharMingen), the antibodies were covalently linked to tosyl-activated Dynabeads M-450 (Dynal, Great Neck, NY) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The antibody-coated beads were then added to purified T cells at a 3:1 bead/cell ratio for the time indicated for each experiment. For T cell stimulation with antigen-presenting cells, 2C T cell receptor transgenic T cells were cultured with irradiated C57BL/6 splenocytes plus 50 nm antigenic peptide SIYRYYGL (Multiple Peptide Systems, San Diego, CA) as described previously (21Frauwirth K.A. Alegre M.L. Thompson C.B. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 2987-2993Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). For T cell proliferation assays, triplicate T cell cultures were plated at 2.5 × 105/ml in the presence of PPARγ agonists or Me2SO. Cells were stimulated with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28-coated beads for 3 days and pulsed with 5 nCi/μl [3H]thymidine for 6–8 h at 37 °C. Cells were harvested with a Tomtec harvester (Hamden, CT) on glass fiber filters and analyzed by a 1205 Betaplate liquid scintillation counter (Wallac, Turku, Finland). Total RNA was isolated from peripheral T cells 24 h poststimulation using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instructions. Reverse transcription was carried out using oligo(dT) primer and SuperscriptTM II (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. PCR was performed using AmpliTaq DNA polymerase and buffers from Applied Biosystems (Branchburg, NJ). The reactions were conducted in a 9600 GeneAmp PCR system (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) using the following conditions: denaturation at 94 °C for 3 min, followed by 25 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 52 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 1 min, followed by extension at 72 °C for 5 min. The forward and reverse primers for the amplification of the human PPARγ cDNA are as follows: 5′-TAT CAA GCC CTT CAC TAC TG-3′ and 5′-CTG ATG GCA TTA TGA GAC AT-3′, which generate a 443-bp PCR product. To determine levels of protein expression, cells were lysed in radioimmune precipitation buffer (10 mm Tris·Cl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 8 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, and 170 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). For stimulated T cells, lysates from 1 × 106 cells were loaded onto an 8% precast Tris-glycine gel (Invitrogen). For FL5.12 cells, lysates containing 20 μg of total protein were loaded. Blots were probed with either anti-PPARγ 561, a rabbit polyclonal antibody against PPARγ (1:1000), or a rabbit polyclonal antibody (H-100) (1:200) purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). The blots were then probed with a 1:5000 dilution of Donkey-anti-Rabbit Ig horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Biosciences) and detected by ECL reagents (Amersham Biosciences). FL5.12 cells, an IL-3-dependent hematopoietic cell line, were used for transfection experiments. Cells were transfected with pcDNA3.1-hPPARγ1 with electroporation as described previously (22Boise L.H. Gonzalez-Garcia M. Postema C.E. Ding L. Lindsten T. Turka L.A. Mao X. Nunez G. Thompson C.B. Cell. 1993; 74: 597-608Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2933) Google Scholar). G418-resistant clones transfected with PPARγ were identified by Western blot as described above. Each of the cell survival experiments was performed with at least two PPARγ lines and two empty vector control lines. All cell lines were cultured in complete RPMI supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Mediatech), 0.3 pg/ml recombinant IL-3 (BD PharMingen), and 1 mg/ml Geneticin (Invitrogen). A reporter construct, acyl-CoAx3-TK-LUC (23Adams M. Reginato M.J. Shao D. Lazar M.A. Chatterjee V.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5128-5132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar), and a β-galactosidase expression plasmid were co-transfected by electroporation into a FL5.12-based PPARγ cell line and an empty vector control line. Different doses of rosiglitazone or Me2SO, the drug vehicle, were added 16 h after transfection. Cells were then collected 24 h after the drug addition. Luciferase (Promega, Madison, WI) and β-galactosidase assays (CLONTECH Laboratories, Palo Alto, CA) were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Results of PPARγ transcriptional activity were normalized to β-galactosidase expression. To withdraw IL-3, FL5.12 cells were washed three times in RPMI and resuspended in complete RPMI lacking recombinant IL-3. To limit glucose, cells were washed in glucose-free RPMI three times and resuspended in RPMI supplemented with 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum (Mediatech) and 50 μm of glucose, which is one-two hundredth of the standard glucose used in regular RPMI media. Cell viability was determined by cellular exclusion of 2 μg/ml propidium iodide followed by flow cytometric analysis of 1 × 105 events. 12–15 h after IL-3 withdrawal, 2–4 × 105 million cells were stained with 20 nm tetramethylrhodamine ethyl ester (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR), a potentiometric dye, at 37 °C for 30 min. Cells were then analyzed by flow cytometry. It has been reported that PPARγ is expressed in murine T cell clones and human peripheral T lymphocytes (14Clark R.B. Bishop-Bailey D. Estrada-Hernandez T. Hla T. Puddington L. Padula S.J. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 1364-1371Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar, 16Yang X.Y. Wang L.H. Chen T. Hodge D.R. Resau J.H. DaSilva L. Farrar W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4541-4544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). To confirm these findings, PPARγ mRNA levels in purified human peripheral T lymphocytes were assayed under three different activation conditions using RT-PCR. T cells were either resting, treated with anti-CD3 to stimulate the T cell receptor pathway, or treated with anti-CD3 plus anti-CD28 to activate the co-stimulation pathway as well. As shown in Fig.1A, a trace amount of PPARγ mRNA was detected in resting T lymphocytes. The expression was up-regulated in T cells stimulated with anti-CD3 antibody and even more so in T cells optimally stimulated with both anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 antibodies. As a loading control, β-actin expression levels were similar in all of these specimens. To further verify that PPARγ is up-regulated in activated T lymphocytes with a different system, Western blot analysis was performed on murine primary T cells. T cells were either unstimulated or stimulated in vitro with antigen-presenting cells for 1 day or 2 days. Consistent with the RT-PCR results on human cells, the Western blot analysis showed that PPARγ protein expression was increased in activated T cells after 2 days of stimulation (Fig.1B). Taken together, these data demonstrate that PPARγ is up-regulated following T cell activation. Previously, it was reported that activation of PPARγ with certain ligands inhibits T cell proliferative responses (14Clark R.B. Bishop-Bailey D. Estrada-Hernandez T. Hla T. Puddington L. Padula S.J. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 1364-1371Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar, 16Yang X.Y. Wang L.H. Chen T. Hodge D.R. Resau J.H. DaSilva L. Farrar W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4541-4544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar) and induces apoptosis in B and T lymphocytes (15Padilla J. Kaur K. Cao H.J. Smith T.J. Phipps R.P. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 6941-6948Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 20Harris S.G. Phipps R.P. Eur. J. Immunol. 2001; 31: 1098-1105Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). It was suggested that decreased lymphocyte proliferation is a consequence of the cell death (15Padilla J. Kaur K. Cao H.J. Smith T.J. Phipps R.P. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 6941-6948Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 20Harris S.G. Phipps R.P. Eur. J. Immunol. 2001; 31: 1098-1105Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). To confirm these findings, we treated activated T cells with PPARγ ligands, examined T cell proliferation by [3H]thymidine incorporation, and determined cell viability by propidium iodide staining. As shown in Fig.2A, both 15d-PGJ2and ciglitazone inhibited T cell proliferation in a dose-dependent fashion. The effective concentrations for the inhibition were ≥5 μm for 15d-PGJ2 and ≥80 μm for ciglitazone, respectively. In contrast, Wy 14643, an agonist of PPARα, had no significant effects on cell survival at concentrations up to 160 μm. Treatment of these cells with 15d-PGJ2 and ciglitazone also increased cell death (Fig. 2B, left panel), which correlated with the inhibition on T cell proliferation. These findings are similar to those previously reported by others in the other systems (14Clark R.B. Bishop-Bailey D. Estrada-Hernandez T. Hla T. Puddington L. Padula S.J. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 1364-1371Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar, 16Yang X.Y. Wang L.H. Chen T. Hodge D.R. Resau J.H. DaSilva L. Farrar W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4541-4544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). As a control, we also examined the effects of PPARγ on the survival of FL5.12 cells, an IL-3-dependent lymphocyte line that expresses little or no PPARγ. The FL5.12 cell line has been previously studied extensively for multiple cell death and survival pathways (24Rathmell J.C. Vander Heiden M.G. Harris M.H. Frauwirth K.A. Thompson C.B. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 683-692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar, 25Khaled A.R. Reynolds D.A. Young H.A. Thompson C.B. Muegge K. Durum S.K. J. Biol.

Biol. 2001; 21: 5899-5912Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). Compared with the primary T cells, higher doses of 15d-PGJ2 and ciglitazone were required to cause significant death of FL5.12 cells, indicating that this cell line was less sensitive to the apoptotic effects of these drugs (Fig.2B). If PPARγ is responsible for the cell death-inducing effects of 15d-PGJ2 and ciglitazone, we reasoned that introduction of PPARγ would restore the sensitivity of FL5.12 cells to death induced by these drugs. To test this possibility, FL5.12 cell lines that express human PPARγ1 were established. Western blot analysis confirmed that PPARγ protein was overexpressed in the stably transfected cell lines (Fig.3A). We compared cell survival of the vector control and PPARγ lines treated with or without 15d-PGJ2 and ciglitazone. Unexpectedly, PPARγ lines died at the same rate and over the same dose range as vector control lines when treated with the drugs (data not shown), indicating that overexpression of PPARγ did not further sensitize cells to the death-inducing effects of 15d-PGJ2 and ciglitazone. To test whether TZD-activation of PPARγ might alter the sensitivity of cells to a different death stimulus, we subjected the cells to IL-3 withdrawal. FL5.12 cells undergo rapid apoptotic death in 18–48 h upon IL-3 withdrawal (22Boise L.H. Gonzalez-Garcia M. Postema C.E. Ding L. Lindsten T. Turka L.A. Mao X. Nunez G. Thompson C.B. Cell. 1993; 74: 597-608Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2933) Google Scholar). Under this condition, we compared survival of a PPARγ and a vector control cell line treated with or without PPARγ ligands. Surprisingly, the PPARγ line, treated with low concentrations of ciglitazone (10 μm) or rosiglitazone (0.5 μm), survived ∼2 or 3 times better than Me2SO-treated cells, respectively, at 24 h after IL-3 withdrawal. The survival benefits depended both on the presence of PPARγ (Fig. 3B, compare Me2SO-treated PPARγ cells with Me2SO-treated control cells) and the activation of PPARγ with agonists (compare ciglitazone- or rosiglitazone-treated PPARγ cells with Me2SO-treated cells). The presence of unidentified physiological activators of PPARγ in the serum or cells may account for the better survival of the PPARγ line with Me2SO treatment than the control cell line with the same treatment. With PPARγ lines of different expression levels (Fig. 3A, g2 versus g14), there was a close correlation between the dosage of PPARγ and degree of cell survival-enhancing effects; e.g. the g14 line (Fig.3A) exhibited reproducible protection but less protection than the g2 line (data not shown). The dosage effects were also observed in subsequent mitochondrial membrane potential assays and glucose limitation assays (see below). Using a luciferase reporter construct carrying PPAR response elements, we confirmed that the PPARγ introduced into the cells was functionally active (Fig. 3C). It was activated to a near maximal level by 0.5 μm rosiglitazone, the same concentration at which we observed a survival phenotype. There was a good quantitative correlation between the -fold level of transcriptional activation (∼3-fold) and the degree of the cell survival promoted by 0.5 μm rosiglitazone (∼3-fold; Fig. 3, compare B with C), suggesting that enhanced viability by rosiglitazone is mediated through the transcriptional activity of PPARγ. We next determined the time course of the survival-promoting effect of PPARγ (Fig. 3D). Although activation of PPARγ protected cells from death up to 24 h after IL-3 withdrawal, almost all cells died by 48 h after IL-3 removal irrespective of the presence or activation status of PPARγ. This cannot be attributed to loss of drug activity, since the addition of fresh PPARγ agonists at 24 h did not prolong survival beyond 48 h (data not shown). Thus, the cell survival-promoting effect of PPARγ is short-lived compared with that of other antiapoptotic genes, such asbcl-xL, suggesting that PPARγ promotes cell survival by a different mechanism. The cell survival-promoting effects depended on the dosage of rosiglitazone (Fig. 3E). Importantly, at a concentration of 50 nm, which is comparable with its dissociation constant (KD) for PPARγ (48–100 nm), rosiglitazone enhanced cell survival to a near maximal level following IL-3 deprivation, providing another piece of evidence that the effects of rosiglitazone are mediated through binding to PPARγ. Growth factor withdrawal results in a rapid decline in glycolysis and mitochondrial potential (reviewed in Ref. 28Plas D.R. Thompson C.B. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2002; 13: 75-78Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we investigated the effects of PPARγ activation on the mitochondrial membrane potential. The membrane potential was measured by mitochondrial incorporation of tetramethylrhodamine ethyl ester, a potentiometric dye, and analyzed by flow cytometry. In a vector control cell line, mitochondrial membrane potential was significantly reduced, even in the presence of rosiglitazone, at 12 h after IL-3 withdrawal. In contrast, the reduction was largely prevented by the activation of PPARγ in a PPARγ-transfected cell line (Fig.4A). Maintenance of mitochondrial membrane potential depended on the activation of PPARγ, since the maintenance was observed with rosiglitazone treatment but not with Me2SO treatment in the PPARγ line (Fig.4B). From these experiments, we conclude that PPARγ activation results in maintenance of the mitochondrial membrane potential following IL-3 deprivation. Previous studies have shown that a primary role of IL-3 in cell survival is to permit cells to take up and utilize glucose, and glucose limitation has adverse effects on cell survival similar to IL-3 withdrawal (27Vander Heiden M.G. Plas D.R. Rathmell J.C. Fox C.J. Harris M.H. Thompson C.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 5899-5912Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). Based on the role of PPARγ to activate genes involved in lipid metabolism, we hypothesized that PPARγ might promote the maintenance of mitochondrial potential by making alternative substrates available to mitochondria. To investigate whether PPARγ could protect cell death caused by a decline in glycolysis, we examined cell survival under the condition of glucose restriction. As shown in Fig.5A, when cells were cultured in media containing 50 μm glucose, which is one-two hundredth of the concentration in standard RPMI, the PPARγ transfected cell line demonstrated better survival in both a PPARγ-dependent (Fig. 5A, compare Me2SO-treated PPARγ cell line with Me2SO-treated vector control line) and activation-dependent manner (Fig. 5A, compare the rosiglitazone-treated with the Me2SO-treated PPARγ cell line). Furthermore, activation of PPARγ prevented the decline of mitochondrial potential in cells cultured in low glucose (Fig.5B). Taken together, these data suggest that PPARγ promotes cell survival by allowing cells to maintain a mitochondrial potential when substrates are limited by either IL-3 removal or glucose restriction. To test whether the effects on cell survival were specific for PPARγ, we generated a FL5.12 cell line stably transfected with PPARα. Recently, it was shown that the α isoform is present in resting murine lymphocytes (29Jones D.C. Ding X. Daynes R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6838-6845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). In contrast to the PPARγ-transfected lines, the PPARα-transfected cells, when activated by an α-ligand, Wy 14643, did not show enhanced cell survival (Fig. 6). Although it was discovered several years ago that PPARγ is expressed in hematopoietic cells (13Greene M.E. Blumberg B. McBride O.W., Yi, H.F. Kronquist K. Kwan K. Hsieh L. Greene G. Nimer S.D. Gene Expr. 1995; 4: 281-299PubMed Google Scholar), the role PPARγ plays in these cells remains largely unknown. Recent studies have shown that PPARγ is expressed in lymphocytes and that activation of PPARγ by its ligands inhibits T cell proliferation and IL-2 production (14Clark R.B. Bishop-Bailey D. Estrada-Hernandez T. Hla T. Puddington L. Padula S.J. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 1364-1371Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar, 16Yang X.Y. Wang L.H. Chen T. Hodge D.R. Resau J.H. DaSilva L. Farrar W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4541-4544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). It has also been reported that PPARγ induces apoptosis in both B and T lymphocytes (15Padilla J. Kaur K. Cao H.J. Smith T.J. Phipps R.P. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 6941-6948Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 20Harris S.G. Phipps R.P. Eur. J. Immunol. 2001; 31: 1098-1105Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). In the present study, we confirmed that PPARγ is expressed in both human and murine peripheral T cells. Moreover, we have demonstrated for the first time that PPARγ is up-regulated at both the messenger RNA and protein levels following T cell activation. It is possible that this up-regulation reflects PPARγ involvement in allowing the cell to meet the increased metabolic demand and/or synthetic events that occur as a result of T cell activation. An effective immune response requires both the proliferative expansion of reactive T cells and the stimulation of the cells' ability to perform specific immune functions, such as cytokine production (30Krauss S. Brand M.D. Buttgereit F. Immunity. 2001; 15: 497-502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Both proliferation and cytokine production place significant bioenergetic demands on the cell and are likely to affect glucose utilization, mitochondrial function, and lipid biosynthesis. Using high concentrations of 15d-PGJ2 and ciglitazone, we reproduced the cell death-inducing effects observed by others. Surprisingly, under conditions of growth factor withdrawal or glucose limitation, PPARγ-overexpressing cells survive better when treated with either ciglitazone or rosiglitazone at concentrations that are comparable with their KD values for PPARγ. The survival benefit depends on both the presence and the activation of PPARγ. The survival-promoting effects are specific for PPARγ, since PPARα did not affect survival of FL5.12 cells. The ability of PPARγ to maintain mitochondrial membrane potential suggests that it sustains survival by providing mitochondria with alternative substrates for coupled electron transport and oxidative phosphorylation. In support of this notion, PPARγ enhances cell viability when glucose is limited. It is also possible that PPARγ promotes cell survival by reducing the fatty acid-dependent uncoupling of mitochondrial potential through the uncoupling proteins. PPARγ promotes cell survival by a different mechanism from antiapoptotic genes in the Bcl-2 family. Although PPARγ delays cell death, cells die eventually by 48 h after IL-3 withdrawal. In contrast, FL5.12 cells transfected with Bcl-xL live up to several days under the same conditions (24Rathmell J.C. Vander Heiden M.G. Harris M.H. Frauwirth K.A. Thompson C.B. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 683-692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). Moreover, under IL-3 withdrawal condition, the mitochondrial potential in Bcl-xL-overexpressing cells declines. Bcl-xL prolongs cell life by keeping the voltage-dependent anion channel on the outer membrane of mitochondrial open, sustaining ADP/ATP exchange and so maintaining mitochondrial homeostasis (31Vander Heiden M.G. Chandel N.S. Schumacker P.T. Thompson C.B. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 159-167Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). In contrast, activated PPARγ maintains the mitochondrial membrane potential. Opposite to the cell survival effects observed in this study, it has been reported that activation of PPARγ with its ligands induces apoptosis in several types of normal or tumor tissues and cell lines.

Based on these studies, it has been suggested that TZDs may represent a new class of drugs for the treatment of lymphomas and carcinomas. Several factors may account for the discrepant observations between the present study and previous reports. In this study, whereas TZDs do induce a dose-dependent induction of apoptosis, these effects occur at much higher concentrations than those required for activation of transcriptional activity of PPARγ. Furthermore, the levels of PPARγ neither correlate with the ability of TZDs to induce death nor affect the dose range in which cell death is observed. PPARγ agonists, such as 15d-PGJ2, ciglitazone, and troglitazone, have been shown to possess effects independent of activation of PPARγ (10Moore K.J. Rosen E.D. Fitzgerald M.L. Randow F.

In keeping with this possibility, many of the previous studies suggesting that TZDs induce cell death utilize concentrations of TZDs several orders of magnitude higher than their KD for PPARγ. We have found that TZDs can promote cell survival at doses that induce optimal PPARγ transcriptional activity. Taken together, our results suggest that type 2 diabetic patients taking these drugs may not be at risk for further impairment of their immune function. The ability of PPARγ to promote cell survival under conditions of growth factor withdrawal might even improve immune cell functions at avascular or necrotic sites such as diabetic ulcers.

https://openalex.org/W2003663220,"The relation between thyroid status and diseases and cancer is unclear. No detailed analysis of thyroid hormone receptor (TR) expression in human breast cancer has been reported. We have analysed the expression and mutational status of the TRalpha1, encoded by the c-erbA proto-oncogene, TRbeta1 and TRbeta2 isoforms in 70 sporadic breast cancers. Alterations in the RNA level of TRbeta1, TRalpha1, or both were found in a number of patients. No expression of TRbeta2 RNA was detected. Western blotting analysis confirmed the differences in expression at the protein level in those cases where sufficient tumor sample was available. Additionally, tumor-specific truncated TRbeta1 RNA was found in six patients. Strikingly, three transcripts shared the same breakpoint. Only one tumor carried the corresponding deletion at the genomic DNA level, suggesting that the remaining abnormal TRbeta1 transcripts are aberrant splicing products. Though no significant correlation was found between TRbeta1 alteration and any clinical parameter, it showed a tendency to associate with early age of onset (<50 years). Our results reveal specific alterations in the expression of TRbeta and TRalpha genes in a subset of breast cancer patients, suggesting that deregulation of thyroid hormone target genes may be involved in the generation of this neoplasia."
https://openalex.org/W2329716392,"The human INK4a gene locus encodes two structurally unrelated tumor suppressor proteins, p16INK4a and p14ARF, which are frequently inactivated in human cancer. Whereas p16INK4a acts through engagement of the Rb-cdk4/6-cyclin D pathway, both the pro-apoptotic and cell cycle-regulatory functions of p14ARF were shown to be primarily dependent on the presence of functional p53. Recent reports have also implicated p14ARF in p53-independent mechanisms of cell cycle regulation and apoptosis induction, respectively. To further explore the pro-apoptotic function of p14ARF in relation to functional cellular p53, we constructed a replication-deficient adenoviral vector for overexpression of p14ARF (Ad-p14ARF). As expected, Ad-p14ARF efficiently induced apoptosis in p53/Rb wild-type U-2OS osteosarcoma cells at low multiplicities of infection. Interestingly, Ad-p14ARF also induced apoptosis in both p53-deleted SAOS-2 osteosarcoma cells and HCT116 colon cancer cells with a bi-allelic knock-out of p53 (HCT116-p53−/−). Similarly, adenovirus-mediated overexpression of p14ARF induced apoptosis in p53/Bax-mutated DU145 prostate cancer cells as well as in HCT116 cells devoid of functional Bax (HCT116-Bax−/−). Restoration of Bax expression by retroviral gene transfer in DU145 cells did not further enhance p14ARF-triggered cell death. Infection with Ad-p14ARF induced activation of mitochondrial permeability shift transition, caspase activation and apoptotic DNA fragmentation irrespective of the presence or absence of either Bax or functional cellular p53. Nevertheless, overexpression of the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 homolog Bcl-xL markedly inhibited p14ARF-induced apoptosis. This may indicate that p14ARF triggers a so far unknown activator of mitochondrial apoptosis which can be inhibited by Bcl-2 but which acts either independently or downstream of Bax. Taken together, this report demonstrates the participation of signaling pathways apart from the p53/Mdm-2 rheostat and Bax in p14ARF-mediated apoptosis."

https://openalex.org/W2025091340,"The carcinogenic effects of sunlight in human epidermis may be thwarted by either: transient growth arrest and repair of DNA photodamage in keratinocytes (KCs); elimination of KCs with damaged DNA via apoptosis; or by stimulating a senescence switch whereby KCs become irreversibly growth arrested. Using normal human skin organ cultures and living epidermal equivalents, we demonstrate that in the proliferative basal layer, removal of KCs via apoptosis had a rapid onset (beginning within 2 h) following UV-light exposure generating progressively greater numbers of KCs with thymine dimers as the dose of UV-light was increased; involved induction of Apaf-1, activation of caspase-3, and was dependent on p53 activation as addition of a p53 chemical inhibitor blocked the apoptotic response. Suprabasal layer KCs underwent apoptosis at much later time points (>8 h). KCs in the basal layer repaired DNA damage more rapidly than KCs in suprabasal layers. Steady state levels of p53 increased in irradiated cells, and the increase was accompanied by phosphorylation of serine 9 and serine 15, but not serine 6 residues. By contrast, cultured KCs undergoing spontaneous replicative senescence were resistant to UV-induced apoptosis. Senescent KCs constitutively contained low levels of p53, which were neither increased nor phosphorylated or acetylated after UV-exposure and possessed minimal DNA binding activity, indicative of functional inactivation. Furthermore, treatment of senescent KCs with DNA damaging agent adriamycin did not result in activation of latent p53 or apoptosis. When KCs within psoriatic plaques were examined, they resembled senescent KCs in that they expressed p53, which was not phosphorylated or acetylated. Thus, UV-light induces DNA damage in human epidermal KCs triggering p53 activation, and subsequent apoptosis involving distinct cell layers and kinetics. However, the lack of p53 activation as seen in senescent KCs and psoriatic plaques, is associated with a relative resistance of KCs to UV-induced apoptosis. In conclusion, the sensitivity and resistance of KCs to apoptosis depends not only on the location within various layers of epidermis and levels of p53, but may also involve p53 activation via post-translational modifications."

Its product is the precursor of several important classes of plant phenylpropanoids including lignins, flavonoids, and coumarins. These cinnamate-derived natural products are relatively nonexistent in bacteria; however, because of the rarity of PAL in prokaryotes. Bacteria and animals do carry out a similar enzymatic reaction, the conversion of l-histidine to trans-urocanic acid by the highly homologous histidine ammonia-lyase (HAL, EC 4.3.1.3).

Although HALs and PALs have analogous mechanisms of action, PALs are considerably larger homotetrameric proteins (312 versus 215 kDa), suggesting that these related enzymes evolved independently. We recently cloned and sequenced the putative PAL gene encP, which is associated with the enterocin biosynthetic gene cluster, from the sediment-derived bacterium “Streptomyces maritimus” (7Piel J.

The type strain is deposited at the National Center for Agricultural Utilization Research (NRRL B-24122). Although the product of encP is more homologous in sequence and size to bacterial HALs than to plant PALs, circumstantial evidence suggested that EncP functions as a PAL. The bacteriostatic agent enterocin is biosynthesized by a unique type II polyketide synthase system that utilizes a novel cinnamate-derived benzoyl-coenzyme A (CoA) starter unit (Fig. 1) (9Moore B.S. Hertweck C. Nat. Prod. Rep. 2002; 19: 70-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). A sequence analysis of the 20 open reading frame enc cluster and feeding experiments with labeled precursors demonstrated that benzoyl-CoA is produced in this bacterium in a plantlike manner from phenylalanine via cinnamic acid followed by β-oxidation (10Hertweck C.

To functionally assign encP and its role in benzoyl-CoA biosynthesis in “S. maritimus,” we developed a genetics system in this bacterium. Here, we report the inactivation, complementation, and heterologous expression of encP, a novel bacterial phenylalanine ammonia-lyase-encoding gene. All of the strains and plasmids used in this work are listed in Table I. “S. maritimus” strain BD26T was grown as described previously (8Piel J. Hertweck C. Shipley P.R. Hunt D.M. Newman M.S.

Practical Streptomyces Genetics. The John Innes Foundation, Norwich, CT2000Google Scholar). Biotin labeling and detection of chemiluminescent positives were performed with the DNADetectorTM HPR Southern blotting kit (KPL, Inc.). Oligonucleotides were obtained from Sigma Genosys. PCR was carried out on a PTC-2000 thermal cycler (MJ Research) withTaq (Invitrogen) or PfuTurbo® (Stratagene) DNA polymerase. DNA sequencing by BigDye terminator cycle sequencing reaction using an ABI 377 sequencer was performed at the Laboratory of Molecular Systematics and Evolution at the University of Arizona. The gene sequence of the enterocin biosynthetic gene cluster includingencP has been deposited at GenBank under accession numberAF254925. The encP disruption vector pBM4 was constructed as follows. A 800-bp internal fragment of encP was PCR-amplified from pJP15F11 with the primers 5′-GGTCCACGCGCCGGTTGGCG-3′ and 5′-GCTGGCGCGCGGGAACTCCG-3′ and ligated into pCR2.1-TOPO. TheEcoRI fragment from the resulting plasmid was cloned into pKC1139 to create pBM4, which was conjugated into “S. maritimus” as described previously (15Mazodier P. Petter R. Thompson C. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 3583-3585Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). The encPsingle crossover mutant KP was selected after propagatingtrans-conjugants on SGGP (16Yamamoto H. Maurer K.H. Hutchinson C.R. J. Antibiot. (Tokyo). 1986; 39: 1304-1313Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) plates at 37 °C, and apramycin-resistant colonies were confirmed by Southern hybridization with biotinylated encP. Polyketide production in S. maritimus KP was analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and electrospray-mass spectrometry as described previously (7Piel J. Hoang K. Moore B.S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2000; 122: 5415-5416Crossref Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Feeding experiments involved overlaying cinnamic or d5-benzoic acids (0.5–1 mg/plate). To facilitate the genetic complementation of the encPmutant, we constructed the conjugative expression plasmid pBM6 by first inserting the 0.8-kb PstI oriT fragment from pOJ446 into a unique PstI site of pWHM3 to create pBM5 followed by ligation of a 0.4-kb EcoRI-XbaIermE* promoter DNA fragment. The gene encP was PCR-amplified, blunt end-cloned into pCR2.1-Blunt to yield pBM7, and cloned into the BamHI-XbaI cloning site of pBM6 to create pBM8. The sequence of the 1.679-kb encP PCR product was confirmed by sequencing. The primers for the amplification of encP were 5′-GTCTAGATGGTGTGTCTCCCTTCCAG-3′ (reverse) and 5′-GACTTAATTGGCATGGGCAGACGGTCTG-3′ (forward). Plasmids pBM6 (negative control) and pBM8 were introduced into “S. maritimus” KP using the plasmid conjugal transfer method. Transformants were directly selected on A1 plates containing 100 μg/ml apramycin and 50 μg/ml thiostrepton at 37 °C. Plasmids pBM6 and pBM8 were introduced into S. coelicolor A3 (2Langer B. Ro¨ther D. Reátey J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10867-10871Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) and S. coelicolor YU105 by protoplast transformation as described previously (14Kieser T. Bibb M.J. Buttner M.J. Chater K.F. Hopwood D.A. Practical Streptomyces Genetics. The John Innes Foundation, Norwich, CT2000Google Scholar). The nonmethylatingE. coli strain ET12567 (17MacNiel D.J. Gewain K.M. Ruby C.L. Dezeny G. Gibbons P.H. MacNiel T. Gene (Amst.). 1992; 111: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar) was used to obtain DNA for transformation of S. coelicolor. The strains were grown on R2YE agar plates containing 20 μg/ml thiostrepton at 30 °C for up to 7 days. The cultured agar was chopped and extracted with 95:5 EtOAc:MeOH, and the dried crude extract was analyzed by HPLC as described above. The encP sequence starting with a methionine start codon encodes a 523-amino acid protein and is preceded by a putative ribosome binding site (5′-AGGGA-3′) at −10 to −6. EncP shows greater sequence homology to prokaryotic HALs than to eukaryotic PALs and contains a conserved motif around Ser-143 (Fig. 2), which is the probable precursor of the modified dehydroalanine residue in the 4-methylidone imidazol-5-one prosthetic group (1Schwede T.F. Reátey J. Schulz G.E. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5355-5361Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Although most HALs and PALs contain either an alanine or cysteine residue adjacent to the active site serine, EncP instead uniquely harbors a threonine residue at this position. Most other HAL active site residues are conserved in EncP. However, a notable exception is Val-83, which in HALs is a conserved histidine residue that coordinates its imidazole group through a hydrogen bond with that of the bound histidine substrate (3Ro¨ther D. Poppe L. Viergutz S. Langer B. Reátey J. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 6011-6019Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). On the other hand, plant PALs carry aliphatic residues such as valine and isoleucine at this position, which is consistent with that of EncP, to provide a hydrophobic environment for the benzene ring of the substrate phenylalanine. To establish the in vivo function of the EncP gene product, we developed a genetics system in “S. maritimus” and disrupted encP by single crossover homologous recombination. The pKC1139-based temperature-sensitive plasmid pBM4 was constructed with an internal 0.8-kb fragment of the targeted encP gene. The conjugal transfer of pBM4 fromE. coli to “S. maritimus” and growth of the resulting trans-conjugant under selective conditions resulted in the mutant strain KP (Fig.3). The single crossover event resulted in the tandem duplication of truncated encP genes with vector containing an apramycin resistance gene between the sequences. Southern blot hybridization of genomic DNA from the wild type and mutant with a biotinylated DNA probe carrying encP verified the gene disruption. Predicted band shifts were detected inSphI digests of the total DNA. “S. maritimus” KP did not exhibit any different phenotypes in comparison with the wild-type strain in A1 medium at 37 °C. HPLC analysis of an organic extract from theencP-inactivated strain “S. maritimus” KP demonstrated that cinnamic acid and the benzoate-primed polyketides enterocin and the wailupemycins were not produced (Fig.4). Upon supplementation of cinnamate and benzoate to the culture medium, enterocin production was restored albeit at 5 and 14%, respectively, of wild-type levels. The administration of d5-labeled benzoic acid resulted in no dilution of the deuterium label in the resultant enterocin as detected by HPLC mass spectrometry, verifying the complete abolishment of benzoate biosynthesis in the mutant strain. The encP mutant strain KP was next complemented with the wild-type encP gene to measure the level of pathway restoration. The pWHM3-based E. coli streptomycete expression vector pBM8 was constructed with wild-type encPunder the strong constitutive ermE* promoter withoriT to allow conjugation from E. coli. The complementation of mutant KP with pBM8 resulted in the biosynthesis of cinnamic acid and the complete restoration of enterocin production to wild-type levels (Fig. 4). The pWHM3-based plasmid pBM8 containing the gene encP was heterologously expressed inS. coelicolor wild-type strain A3 (2Langer B. Ro¨ther D. Reátey J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10867-10871Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) and the genetically engineered S. coelicolor host YU105. In each case, organic extracts of the transformants were analyzed for the production of cinnamic acid by HPLC using commercial cinnamic acid as a reference standard. As with “S. maritimus” KP, the expression of the gene encP resulted in the in vivo production of cinnamic acid in the two S. coelicolor strains. Cinnamic acid biosynthesis was greater in the mutant strain YU105 than in the wild-type strain A3 (2Langer B. Ro¨ther D. Reátey J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10867-10871Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) (100 versus 40 μg/20 ml R2YE agar plate). This result verified that the encP gene product is abona fide phenylalanine ammonia-lyase and demonstrated for the first time the engineered biosynthesis of cinnamic acid in a bacterium. Our data clearly show that the “S. maritimus” geneencP, which is associated with the enterocin biosynthesis gene cluster, encodes a rare bacterial phenylalanine ammonia-lyase whose product cinnamic acid is converted to benzoyl-CoA during the biosynthesis of the polyketide antibiotic enterocin. Although ubiquitous in plants and found in some fungi, PAL activity has only once before been identified in a bacterium where it appears to catalyze the first step in the biosynthesis of cinnamamide in the actinomyceteStreptomyces verticillatus (18Bezanson G.S. Desaty D. Emes A.V. Vining L.C. Can. J. Microbiol. 1970; 16: 147-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). A partially purified enzyme with an estimated molecular mass of 226 kDa was shown to behave similarly to PALs isolated from plants and fungi (19Emes A.V. Vining L.C. Can. J. Biochem. 1970; 48: 613-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). More recently, a bacterial tyrosine ammonia-lyase from Rhodobacter capsulatuswas characterized and shown to be 150 times more catalytically efficient toward l-tyrosine thanl-phenylalanine as the substrate (20Kyndt J.A. Meyer T.E. Cusanovish M.A. Van Beeumen J.J. FEBS Lett. 2002; 512: 240-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Like EncP, there are two amino acid substitutions in the conserved active site residues in the R. capsulatus tyrosine ammonia-lyase when compared with HAL enzymes, His-83 to Leu and Glu-414 to Gln (Fig. 2). A biochemical analysis of all aromatic amino acid ammonia-lyases to date reveals that these proteins are homotetramers and that the prokaryotic enzymes are considerably smaller than their eukaryotic counterparts (Fig. 2). Downstream of the disrupted encP gene in mutant KP and separated by 26 nucleotides is the methionine start codon ofencO. As this gene may be co-transcribed withencP, insertional inactivation of encP via a single crossover may have given rise to polar effects on the expression of encO. The results from the complementation and expression experiments suggest that EncO does not serve a biosynthetic role in the EncP-catalyzed conversion of l-phenylalanine totrans-cinnamic acid. The inability of cinnamate and benzoate supplementation to fully restore wild-type levels in theencP mutant rather suggests that encO may serve a regulatory role in either cinnamic acid or enterocin biosynthesis. Preliminary data on the inactivation and overexpression ofencO indicate that cinnamic acid and enterocin production is dramatically reduced. 2The bacterium “S. maritimus” strain BD26T, originally described in Ref. 21Sitachitta N. Gadepalli M. Davidson B.S. Tetrahedron. 1996; 52: 8073-8080Crossref Scopus (68) Google Scholar, is pending as a new species within the genus Streptomyces on the basis of cultural and physiological characteristics and 16 S rDNA analysis (GenBankTM accession number AF233338). The type strain is deposited at the National Center for Agricultural Utilization Research (NRRL B-24122). The gene encO may exert feedback control on encPwhose product funnels the proteinogenic amino acidl-phenylalanine to the dedicated secondary metabolic pathway to polyketide antibiotic enterocin. Thus, encO may represent a novel regulatory gene as its putative 130 amino acid gene product does not resemble any protein in the databases. We are currently examining the in vivo and in vitrofunction of this novel gene. In summary, we have characterized the first phenylalanine ammonia-lyase-encoding gene from a bacterium whose protein product is more homologous in sequence and size to bacterial HALs than to plant PALs.

The two cysteines of the scrapie form, PrPSc, were found to be in their oxidized (i.e. disulfide) form (Turk, E., Teplow, D. B., Hood, L. E., and Prusiner, S. B. (1988)Eur. J. Biochem. 176, 21–30); however, uncertainty remains as to whether the disulfide bonds are intra- or intermolecular. It is demonstrated here that the monomers of PrPSc are not linked by intermolecular disulfide bonds. Furthermore, evidence is provided that PrPSc can induce the conversion of the oxidized, disulfide-intact form of the monomeric cellular prion protein to its protease-resistant form without the temporary breakage and subsequent re-formation of the disulfide bonds in cell-free reactions.

Chem. 1998; 273: 32230-32235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar) is the central event of the disease that seems to be responsible for its neuropathology. Whereas PrPC is protease sensitive (PrPsen), PrPSc is partially resistant to proteolysis (PrPres) and prone to form high-molecular-weight aggregates (6Horiuchi M. Caughey B. Structure Fold. Des. 1999; 7: R231-R240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (81) Google Scholar). This latter feature makes it difficult to analyze the conformational transition that leads to the formation of PrPres or to characterize it. In PrPsen, a disulfide bond stabilizes the overall fold of the protein by connecting the two long C-terminal helices (4Zahn R. Liu A. Lu¨hrs T. Riek R. von Schroetter C. Garcıáa F.L. Billeter M. Calzolai L. Wider G. Wu¨thrich K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 145-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (952) Google Scholar). Some experiments have suggested that the presence of this sole intramolecular disulfide bond in PrPsen is required for conversion to PrPres (7Muramoto T. Scott M. Cohen F.E. Prusiner S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 15457-15462Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 8Herrmann L.M. Caughey B. Neuroreport. 1998; 9: 2457-2461Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 9Maiti N.R. Surewicz W.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2427-2431Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). By contrast, several communications have discussed the possibility that the disulfide bond of PrPC is reduced during the conversion (6Horiuchi M. Caughey B. Structure Fold. Des. 1999; 7: R231-R240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 10Mehlhorn I. Groth D. Sto¨ckel J. Moffat B. Reilly D. Yansura D. Willett W.S. Baldwin M. Fletterick R. Cohen F.E.

A. 2001; 98: 4334-4336Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The reduction of the disulfide bond may provide flexibility for the protein molecule, which may be necessary for the conversion to the β conformation. The cysteines of the prion protein in the scrapie form were assumed to be involved in a disulfide bond because denaturant-solubilized PrPres reacts with thiol-specific reagents only after treatment with reducing agents (14Turk E. Teplow D.B. Hood L.E. Prusiner S.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 176: 21-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar), suggesting that the possible reduction of this disulfide bond may be just a temporary event. Whether the (re-formed) disulfide bonds in PrPres are intermolecular (between monomers) or intramolecular (within monomers) is a critical issue that has important consequences for understanding the molecular mechanism of the conformational transition. The extreme stability of PrPres, as well as other features of the protein, and the PrPsen to PrPresconversion would be more easily understandable if PrPreswere a covalently linked polymer. However, this possibility has been discounted for a long time because it seems to contradict the fact that, upon denaturation, PrP monomers with an intact (intramolecular) disulfide bond dissociate from an infectious PrPrespreparation (14Turk E. Teplow D.B. Hood L.E. Prusiner S.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 176: 21-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar, 15Safar J. Wang W. Padgett M.P. Ceroni M. Piccardo P. Zopf D. Gajdusek D.C. Gibbs C.J., Jr. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6373-6377Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). On the other hand, it was shown recently how, in theory, a putative disulfide-linked polymer of the prion protein could depolymerize into monomers without any added reducing agent (13Welker E. Wedemeyer W.J. Scheraga H.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4334-4336Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). This is because PrP has only two cysteines; thus, one of the two cysteines at the end of a putative disulfide-linked PrPres polymer would not be involved in a disulfide bond. A similar situation frequently arises when a particular protein has both a disulfide bond(s) and a thiol(s). The protein is stable when folded. The three-dimensional structure inhibits thiol-disulfide exchange by sequestering the disulfide bond(s) from the intramolecular attack by the thiol(s). However, when the folded structure of the protein is denatured the thiol attacks the now-exposed disulfide bond, forming a new disulfide bond and freeing the thiol of another cysteine residue. This fast intramolecular reshuffling persists in the unfolded protein, resulting in a dynamic equilibrium involving different disulfide-bonded isomers. This is a well characterized phenomenon (16Welker E. Narayan M. Wedemeyer W.J. Scheraga H.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2312-2316Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 17Saito K. Welker E. Scheraga H.A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 15002-15008Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In this manner, this reshuffling reaction could take place in a linear disulfide-bonded polymer of PrPres upon denaturation. However, in such a polymer the attack by the thiol on the disulfide leads to dissociation of a monomer with an intramolecular disulfide bond, leaving another free thiol at the end of the polymer. The next reshuffling reaction releases another monomer giving rise to a self-depolymerization chain-reaction in the unfolded polymer. Therefore, this depolymerization reaction would lead such a disulfide-linked linear polymer to dissociate preferentially into monomers with intramolecular disulfide bonds (13Welker E. Wedemeyer W.J. Scheraga H.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4334-4336Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Consequently, PrPres will appear as a monomer upon solubilization with a denaturating agent regardless of whether it has an intra- or intermolecular disulfide bond. Thus, to distinguish between intra- and intermolecular disulfide bonds, this putative depolymerization through thiol/disulfide exchange must be prevented by blocking the terminal thiols when PrPres is denatured. In the early work of Turk et al. (14Turk E. Teplow D.B. Hood L.E. Prusiner S.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 176: 21-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar) PrPres was solubilized by heating in 2% SDS, and the solubilized fraction that might have contained the depolymerized monomers was analyzed for intra- or intermolecular disulfide bonds by SDS-PAGE. It is worth noting that solubilization in SDS loading buffer alone could lead a putative PrPres disulfide-bonded polymer to dissociate preferentially into monomers with an apparently intact disulfide bond. The available biochemical data do not distinguish between intra- or intermolecular disulfide bonds (14Turk E. Teplow D.B. Hood L.E. Prusiner S.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 176: 21-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar, 15Safar J. Wang W. Padgett M.P. Ceroni M. Piccardo P. Zopf D. Gajdusek D.C. Gibbs C.J., Jr. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6373-6377Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), raising the interesting possibility that PrPres may have intermolecular disulfide bonds (13Welker E. Wedemeyer W.J. Scheraga H.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4334-4336Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The experiments in the present study were therefore undertaken to gain more information about the possible involvement of disulfide exchange reactions in the conformational transition of the prion protein. Specifically, we asked two questions: Is the disulfide bond in PrPres intra- or intermolecular, and does any disulfide exchange reaction occur during the transition of PrPsen to its protease-resistant form in cell-free conversion reactions? Samples of [35S]methionine-labeled hamster GPINEG PrPsen and PrPres derived from hamsters infected with scrapie strain 263K were prepared as described previously (18Caughey B.W. Dong A. Bhat K.S. Ernst D. Hayes S.F. Caughey W.S. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 7672-7680Crossref PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar, 19Caughey B. Horiuchi M. Demaimay R. Raymond G.J. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 309: 122-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). 500 ng of PrPres was suspended in 30 μl of 2.5 m Gdn·HCl/phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.5 (sample I), 2.5 mGdn·HCl/phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.5, supplemented with 80 mm NEM (Pierce) (sample II), or in 2.5 mGdn·HCl/100 mm acetic acid (sample III). After a 1-h incubation of all three PrPres samples at 37 °C the samples were centrifuged, and the pellets were used in the subsequent denaturation experiment. Two 6-μl aliquots were taken from each supernatant for confirming the effectiveness of the thiol-blocking, and then the remaining supernatants were prepared for SDS-PAGE analyses by diluting out the Gdn·HCl with 200 μl of 0.2 m Tris buffer, pH 8, adding 4 μl of 5 mg/ml thyroglobulin (Sigma) as a carrier protein, and precipitating the proteins with 950 μl of methanol (19Caughey B. Horiuchi M. Demaimay R. Raymond G.J. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 309: 122-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). For the samples in acetic acid (sample III) the 0.2m Tris buffer contained 0.3 m AEMTS (20Bruice T.W. Kenyon G.L. J. Prot. Chem. 1982; 1: 47-58Crossref Scopus (95) Google Scholar) as well. The pellets from the prewash step were resuspended in 30 μl of the same solution as in the prewash step, containing the same concentration of thiol-blocking reagent except that 6 m instead of 2.5 m Gdn·HCl was used. After a 1-h additional incubation at 37 °C, the samples were prepared for SDS-PAGE analyses as described for the supernatants of the prewash step above. The methanol precipitates were resuspended in loading buffer (8Herrmann L.M. Caughey B. Neuroreport. 1998; 9: 2457-2461Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) containing no reducing agent. One-half of each sample was mixed with an equal volume of loading buffer containing β-mercaptoethanol; the other half was mixed with an equal volume of loading buffer containing no reducing agent. The samples were then run on 12% precast Tris-glycine SDS gel or 10% NuPage (Invitrogen). Proteins were electroblotted onto Immobilon-P polyvinylidene difluoride (Millipore). PrP was detected with 3F4 anti-PrP monoclonal antibody (21Kascsak R.J. Rubenstein R. Merz P.A. Tonna-DeMasi M. Fersko R. Carp R.I. Wisniewski H.M. Diringer H. J. Virol. 1987; 61: 3688-3693Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as described previously (19Caughey B. Horiuchi M. Demaimay R. Raymond G.J. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 309: 122-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The 6-μl aliquots that were removed from the supernatants of the prewash step were mixed with 6 μl of 6m Gdn·HCl/phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.5 (samples I and II) or 6 μl of 100 mm acetic acid buffer (sample III) with or without 5 mm reduced DTT. After 15 min of incubation at 37 °C, the samples were prepared for SDS-PAGE gel analyses as described above, except that the methanol-precipitated samples were resuspended in loading buffer containing 1.8 mm biotinylated-maleimide (Sigma), run on a 10% NuPage SDS gel, electroblotted as before, and stained with a streptavidin conjugate (Bio-Rad). The rationale for this experiment is according to the following: 5 mm DTT reduces the disulfide bonds in the sample, and after removing the excess DTTred by methanol precipitation biotinylated maleimide reacts with the free cysteines of the protein. The streptavidin staining visualizes the reacted biotinylated protein that had free thiols after DTT reduction. Thyroglobulin, the carrier protein, has a great number of cysteines and gave strong staining in the DTTred-treated sample. However, samples without DTTred or samples that have thiol-blocking agent did not give strong staining, indicating that the thiol blocks in these experiments were effective in blocking millimolar concentrations of DTTred. This reaction was carried out as described previously (19Caughey B. Horiuchi M. Demaimay R. Raymond G.J. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 309: 122-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), except that some of the samples were treated with the maleimide blocking agent. Briefly, 250 ng of hamster PrPres was preincubated in 2.5m Gdn·HCl, pH 6, at 37 °C for 1 h (19Caughey B. Horiuchi M. Demaimay R. Raymond G.J. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 309: 122-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Maleimide (Sigma) in 2.5 m Gdn·HCl was added to some of the samples (to a final concentration of 300 mm) at the end of the preincubation. After 15 min, 35S-labeled hamster GPINEG PrPsen (25,000 cpm) and buffer were added to bring the solution to final concentrations of 1 mGdn·HCl, 50 mm citrate, pH 6, 5 mm cetyl pyridinium chloride, and 1% N-lauryl sarcosine. The final concentration for maleimide was 50 mm. The conversion was allowed to proceed for 2 days at 37 °C; 10% of each sample was then removed (for PK− samples), and the remaining 90% was digested with 20 μg/ml proteinase K (giving a 2:1 PK/PrPres weight ratio for PK+ samples) in Tris-saline (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl in 50 μl) at 37 °C for 1 h. Digestion by PK was stopped by adding 1 μl of 0.1 m Pefabloc (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), 4 μl of 5 μg/ml thyroglobulin, and four volumes of methanol. The PK− samples were similarly precipitated. Methanol-precipitated pellets were subjected to SDS-PAGE on 10% precast NuPage gel (Invitrogen), and radioactive proteins were visualized with a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). The conversion was carried out by mixing 500 ng of hamster PrPres and 35S-labeled GPINEG PrPsen (50,000 cpm), pH 7, in 50 mm imidazole and 200 mm KCl, 0.2 mg/ml heparan sulfate, but with or without 70 mm AEMTS, at 0 °C. The samples were kept at 0 °C for 1 h and subsequently incubated at 37 °C for 3 h. During the 0 °C incubation, some PrPsen bound to PrPres, but there was no detectable conversion of the labeled PrPsen (19Caughey B. Horiuchi M. Demaimay R. Raymond G.J. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 309: 122-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Proteinase K+ digestion was carried out as in the Gdn·HCl conversion with 4:1 and 20:1 PK/PrPres weight ratios, and the samples were analyzed on SDS-PAGE (precast 14% Tris-glycine gel) as described for the Gdn·HCl conversion. To confirm the effectiveness of the thiol-blocking methods, a control experiment was carried out as in the previous assay for intramolecular disulfides bonds. Aliquots were removed from the conversion samples before the proteinase K treatment and were mixed with an equal volume of 10 mm DTTred in 6 mGdn·HCl/400 mm Tris buffer, pH 9. Control samples without DTTred were prepared, and all samples were quenched with 1 μl of 250 mm AEMTS and precipitated with methanol, and radioactive proteins were analyzed on SDS-PAGE as described above. The purpose of the following experiments is to determine whether or not the monomeric subunits of PrPres aggregates are linked by intermolecular disulfide bonds. For this purpose, any existing free thiols on PrPres were blocked with the protein being simultaneously denatured with Gdn·HCl; if the thiols were not blocked, a linear disulfide-bonded polymer could self-depolymerize mostly into monomers with intramolecular disulfide bonds upon denaturation (13Welker E. Wedemeyer W.J. Scheraga H.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4334-4336Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). However, by blocking the thiols, such a disulfide-bonded polymer would remain intact and could easily be distinguished from PrP monomers by SDS-PAGE. To block the possible self-depolymerization reaction of a disulfide-linked linear polymer fully during its denaturation, the terminal thiols of such a self-depolymerizing polymer have to be blocked faster than the disulfide-reshuffling reaction can occur. Although the terminal thiol of such a polymer would have to attack the disulfide bond between two monomers in the polymer, it is a unimolecular reaction in kinetic terms and thus is very fast. The full blocking of this otherwise fast self-depolymerization reaction is a critical technical issue in this experiment. To understand the underlying experimental rationale, it is useful to consider the three commonly used protein thiol-blocking methods: (i) irreversible blocking by alkylation; (ii) reversible blocking by forming a mixed disulfide with the protein-thiolate; (iii) reversible blocking by a pH quench, which protonates the thiolate. Alkylation is applicable for permanently blocking thiols that are easily available without denaturing the protein (22Rothwarf D.M. Scheraga H.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1991; 113: 6294-6296Crossref Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 23Weissman J.S. Kim P.S. Science. 1991; 253: 1386-1393Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). However, it is a relatively slow reaction; hence, much faster unimolecular disulfide-reshuffling reactions are prevented only when the alkylating agent is applied at high concentrations. Such high concentrations of alkylating agent frequently lead to covalent modification of other non-cysteine amino acids (24Jocelyn P.C. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 143: 44-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). By contrast, reversible blocking with thiosulfonates such as AEMTS or pH quench is sufficiently fast to block the unimolecular disulfide-reshuffling reaction fully, although reversible blocking requires extra caution to avoid rearrangements during subsequent analysis steps (22Rothwarf D.M. Scheraga H.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1991; 113: 6294-6296Crossref Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 23Weissman J.S. Kim P.S. Science. 1991; 253: 1386-1393Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar, 25Rothwarf D.M. Scheraga H.A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 2671-2679Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). To avoid possible artifacts in any particular blocking procedure, two different thiol-blocking approaches were employed. In an irreversible thiol-blocking approach 80 mm NEM was used. In the other reversible approach, AEMTS blocking was combined with the pH quench method; experiments were carried out at low pH that blocked the disulfide reactions efficiently by protonating the thiolates that are the reactive species. At the end of the experiments, the pH was raised to 8 in the presence of 70 mm AEMTS that forms a disulfide with the now-deprotonated thiols faster than any other thiol-disulfide exchange reaction could occur. Thus, the subsequent analysis step (methanol precipitation and SDS-PAGE) could be carried out at ambient pH. To decrease the background due to PrPres-associated PrPsenmolecules, a prewash step in 2.5 m Gdn·HCl was carried out to strip off the associated PrPsen molecules (26Caughey B. Kocisko D.A. Raymond G.J. Lansbury P.T., Jr. Chem. Biol. 1995; 2: 807-817Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). The remaining pellet contains the PrPres molecules and infectivity (27Caughey B. Raymond G.J. Kocisko D.A. Lansbury P.T., Jr. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 4107-4110Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The various thiol-reactive reagents were added to both the prewash and pellet denaturation steps. In one experiment (I), PrPSc was incubated in 2.5 m Gdn·HCl, pH 7.5 without any thiol-blocking reagent. In this experiment, a possible thiol-induced self-depolymerization of the putative disulfide-linked PrP polymer was not blocked. Thus, denaturation of the PrPres would result in mostly disulfide-intact monomers, regardless of whether the monomers were linked by intermolecular disulfide bonds or the disulfide-intact monomers were associated only by non-covalent enthalpic interactions. In other experiments, PrPres was incubated with NEM (II), or the low pH approach in combination with AEMTS blocking was used (III). In II and III, the possible thiol-induced self-depolymerization would not take place during the denaturation of the protein. The samples were analyzed for self-depolymerization on Western blots as follows. Half of the samples had β-mercaptoethanol in the loading buffer to reduce all disulfide bonds in the sample to distinguish disulfide-bonded oligomers from oligomers joined by other types of covalent linkages (Figs.1 and 2,lanes 1-3). The other half of the samples did not have the β-mercaptoethanol to keep all disulfide bonds intact during the analyses (Figs. 1 and 2, lanes 4-6).Figure 2Intra- versus intermolecular disulfide bonds in PrPSc. To examine whether thiol-blocked PrPSc was dissociated into monomers or remained polymerized during the 6 m Gdn·HCl denaturation, the methanol-precipitated proteins were analyzed on immunoblot (10% NuPage SDS gel) as described under “Experimental Procedures.”Lane 1, control without any thiol-blocking reagent;lane 2, with 80 mm NEM; lane 3, with 100 mm acetic acid, subsequently blocked with 0.3m AEMTS. β-mercaptoethanol was present in the samples oflanes 1-3. Lanes 4-6 are the same samples as lanes 1-3, respectively, except that β-mercaptoethanol was omitted. Neither thiol-blocking nor β-mercaptoethanol caused significant differences in the ratio of the monomeric and multimeric forms of the prion protein on this gel, showing that no prion protein molecules linked by intermolecular disulfide bonds were detectable. The numbers on the left-hand side indicate molecular mass in kilodaltons.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To overcome the difficulty associated with the inefficient transfer of high-molecular-weight material from the gels to the membrane during electroblotting, the gels in Figs. 1 and 2 were overloaded to provide better detection in the higher-molecular-weight region. In Fig. 1, the supernatants of the 2.5 m Gdn·HCl prewash step are shown. Fig. 2 shows the protein in the pellets that were solubilized in 6m Gdn·HCl. If the disulfide bonds in PrPres were intermolecular, and free thiols could initiate a disulfide-reshuffling-induced self-depolymerization upon denaturation (13Welker E. Wedemeyer W.J. Scheraga H.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4334-4336Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), then blocking free thiols should have resulted in less PrP monomer and more high-molecular-weight material toward the top of the gel in lanes 5 and6 in Figs. 1 and 2, compared with the unblocked control samples (lane 4). By contrast, if the disulfide bond were intramolecular within the PrPres monomers, then neither the thiol-blocking reagents nor β-mercaptoethanol would affect the ratio of monomeric and multimeric forms of PrP observed on the gel. Figs. 1 and 2 show that there is no effect of the thiol blocking on PrPres depolymerization. Although there may be a smaller amount of PrPres in lanes 2 and 5 in Fig. 2, this difference is not affected by β-mercaptoethanol in the loading buffer, indicating that it does not originate from an intermolecular disulfide-bonded population in the samples. Therefore, there was no evidence for intermolecular disulfide-linked PrPres aggregates in Figs. 1 and 2. The experiment was carried out several times and with other, slightly different thiol-blocking approaches; the gels were loaded with different amounts of samples, which also made it possible to compare the monomer regions of the lanes. No effect of the thiol blocking on either monomeric or multimeric forms of PrP was evident in β-mercaptoethanol (−) lanes compared with the respective β-mercaptoethanol (+) lanes on any of these gels. From a comparison of the β-mercaptoethanol (−) lanes to the respective β-mercaptoethanol (+) lanes, no band from a disulfide-bonded dimer was observed on these gels. The capability of the thiol-blocking methods to quench 5 mmDTTred was confirmed in aliquots taken from each sample before methanol precipitation (data not shown; see “Experimental Procedures”). Thus, these results show that the molecules in the bulk of the PrPres aggregate are not linked by intermolecular disulfide bonds. Although the disulfide bond in PrPres is therefore intramolecular within the PrPres monomers, experiments on recombinant prion protein have led to the hypothesis that the intramolecular disulfide bond does not persist during the conversion of PrPsen to PrPres (10Mehlhorn I.

A possible temporary reduction of the intramolecular disulfide bond of PrPsen may facilitate the conformational transition, providing higher flexibility for the protein and destabilizing the α-helical fold. The subsequent re-formation of the original intramolecular disulfide bond may stabilize a new β conformation. The conversion of the cellular prion protein to the protease-resistant form on a PrPres template was shown to occur in the absence of intact cells (28Kocisko D.A. Come J.H. Priola S.A. Chesebro B. Raymond G.J. Lansbury P.T. Caughey B. Nature. 1994; 370: 471-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (792) Google Scholar). The cell-free systems have reproduced features of the in vivo conversion (29Bessen R.A.

Virol. 1999; 80: 11-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). The experiments in this sub-section were carried out to determine whether thiol-disulfide exchange reactions are involved in the cell-free conversion reactions. The presence of a thiol (strictly speaking the deprotonated form, the thiolate, which is the reactive species involved in disulfide reactions) is needed for any disulfide exchange reaction to occur. PrPres preparations may contain co-purified thiols that can initiate the reduction of the disulfide bonds during the cell-free conversion reaction. Thus, by blocking the thiols we can learn whether the conformational transition involves a disulfide exchange reaction or not. If thiol-blocking reagents do not inhibit the cell-free conversion reaction, it would indicate that no thiol-disulfide exchange reaction is involved, and thus, that the disulfide bond is maintained intact during the conversion. Based on the above considerations, a Gdn·HCl conversion reaction was carried out as described previously (19Caughey B. Horiuchi M. Demaimay R. Raymond G.J. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 309: 122-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) with or without 50 mm maleimide, another thiol-alkylating reagent. The detection of the converted PrPsen is based on the fact that converted PrPsen molecules are partially resistant to proteinase K digestion. Although proteinase K fully digests PrPsen, it digests PrPres only partially, leaving the core of the protein intact. [35S]methionine labeling of PrPsen makes it possible, even in the presence of excess unlabeled PrPres template, to detect the newly converted PrPres. Fig. 3 shows the Gdn·HCl conversion reaction. The non-glycosylated and the monoglycosylated bands of PrPsen in all PK− lanes show approximately the same intensity, indicating that all of the samples have the same amount of35S-labeled PrPsen substrate. As observed previously, 35S-labeled PrPsen was converted to the expected partially protease-resistant forms (∼7 kDa smaller after PK digestion than the original [35S]PrPsen) in the presence of a PrPres template (compare lanes 4 and 3) but not in its absence (compare lanes 1 and 2). Maleimide (25 mm) had a subtle effect on the pattern of lower [35S]PrPresbands but did not block conversion overall (compare lanes 4and 6). A lower [35S]PrPres band was less intense in the PrPres+ PK+ samples, and there was a slight upward shift in the other [35S]PrPres bands (Fig. 3, lane 6). One interpretation of these results is that maleimide reactions with free sulfhydryls affect the conversion of a subset of PrP molecules. However, the slight mobility shift in the [35S]PrPres bands led us to suspect that these changes in the pattern of conversion products without overall inhibition of conversion may be due to the covalent modification of some non-cysteine amino acids of the PrP molecules. This potential problem led us to test for the involvement of disulfide exchange in PrP conversions using different conditions and an alternative thiol-blocking reagent, which is less prone to side reactions. Gdn·HCl-free conversions were carried out with or without AEMTS (Fig. 4) using a shorter incubation time (3–6 h versus 1–2 days). AEMTS was chosen after testing its applicability on RNaseA to this unusually long blocking period that was required with PrP. The 70 mm AEMTS used in the experiment should provide efficient blocking of any known disulfide reaction (22Rothwarf D.M. Scheraga H.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1991; 113: 6294-6296Crossref Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 25Rothwarf D.M. Scheraga H.A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 2671-2679Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). To simplify the interpretation of the conversion product bands, the experiment was also carried out with GPINEG PrPsen purified from tunicamycin-treated cells, which had only the non-glycosylated form of the protein. As shown in Fig. 4 (lanes 5–7, 12, and13), AEMTS has little effect on the conversion reaction. Compared with the maleimide experiment (Fig. 3), a higher PK/PrPres ratio was applied to overcome the interference of AEMTS with PK digestion. The efficacy of AEMTS blocking was demonstrated by the quenching of 10 mm DTTredby aliquots taken from conversion reactions at the end of the 3-h incubation (see “Experimental Procedures”). Without AEMTS, DTT reduced PrP under the applied conditions, judging from the slower mobility of the protein (8Herrmann L.M. Caughey B. Neuroreport. 1998; 9: 2457-2461Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) in lane 1 compared withlane 2 in Fig. 4. However, when AEMTS was present (lane 3) DTTred was quenched, and PrP remained oxidized (lane 3 compared with lane 2 in Fig.4.). Thus, the observations that distinct [35S]PrPres conversion products were generated in the presence of either maleimide or AEMTS provides evidence that PrPsen can be induced by PrPresto convert to the protease-resistant form without thiol-disulfide exchange reactions. A previous study reported the full inhibition of the Gdn·HCl-based conversion by pretreatment of the PrPSc template with 100 mm DTT followed by the addition of 300 mmN-ethyl-maleimide (8Herrmann L.M. Caughey B. Neuroreport. 1998; 9: 2457-2461Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Because the 100 mm DTT pretreatment did not appear to reduce the bulk of the PrPSctemplate, it was supposed that maleimide might have inhibited the conversion by blocking some free thiols that were present in the PrPSc preparation (13Welker E. Wedemeyer W.J. Scheraga H.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4334-4336Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). However, the present results agree with the interpretation given in the former study (8Herrmann L.M. Caughey B. Neuroreport. 1998; 9: 2457-2461Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) that the DTT pretreatment was also necessary for the observed inhibition by maleimide. DTT might have reduced the disulfide bonds in a critical fraction of PrPSc, which forms the conversion sites where PrPC binds to the PrPSc aggregate to be converted to a protease-resistant form. The reduction of this critical fraction of PrPSc with the subsequent NEM treatment that may have blocked the now-free protein thiols may have destroyed these conversion sites irreversibly, leading to the observed full inhibition of the conversion. Alternatively, NEM might have modified some non-cysteine amino acid(s) of the prion protein whose modification interferes with the conversion reaction. PrPSc appears to have intramolecular disulfide bonds within its monomeric subunits. A similar conclusion was obtained in earlier work by Turk et al. (14Turk E. Teplow D.B. Hood L.E. Prusiner S.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 176: 21-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). However, the possible spontaneous depolymerization of PrPSc that would occur upon denaturation of a PrPSc polymer linked by intermolecular disulfide bonds without any added reducing reagent was not blocked in these earlier experiments; this made the distinction between intra- and intermolecular disulfide bonds uncertain. The mechanism of the prion protein conversion in vivo may be different from the cell-free conversion reaction; however, our data demonstrate that the conformational transition can occur without disulfide exchange."

WT1 proteins can both activate and repress putative target genes in vitro, although the in vivo relevance of these putative target genes is often unverified. WT1 mutations can result in Wilms' tumour and the Denys-Drash Syndrome (DDS) of infantile nephropathy, XY pseudohermaphroditism and predisposition to Wilms' tumour. We have established stable transfectants of the mouse mesonephric cell line, M15, which express WT1 harbouring a common DDS point mutation (R394W). A comparison of the expression profiles of M15 and transfectant C2A was performed using Nylon-based arrays. Very few genes showed differential expression. However Wnt-4, a member of the Wnt gene family of secreted glycoproteins, was downregulated in C2A and other similar clones. Doxycycline induction of WT1-A or WT1-D expression in HEK293 stable transfectants also elicited an elevation in Wnt4 expression. Wnt4 is critical for the mesenchyme-to-epithelial transition during kidney development, making it an attractive putative WT1 target. We have mapped human Wnt-4 gene to chromosome 1p35-36, a region of frequent LOH in WT, have characterized the genomic structure of the human Wnt-4 gene and isolated 9 kb of immediate promoter. While several potential WT1 binding sites exist within this promoter, reporter analysis does not strongly support the direct regulation of Wnt4 by WT1. We propose that Wnt-4 regulation by WT1 occurs at a more distant promoter or enhancer site, or is indirect."
https://openalex.org/W2326276503,"Mesotheliomas are tumors arising from mesothelial cells and are associated with asbestos exposure and approximately 50% contain simian virus 40 (SV40) DNA sequences. SV40 infection of human mesothelial cells (HM) causes early cellular immortalization and late transformation. Aberrant methylation is a major mech-anism for loss of function of tumor suppressor genes (TSGs). We recently reported that of seven genes frequently methylated in epithelial tumors, only RASSF1A gene was frequently methylated in mesotheliomas, and its methylation was correlated with loss of RASSF1A expression and the presence of SV40. We studied whether SV40 infection of normal HM induces aberrant methylation of the genes previously studied in mesotheliomas. Of six infected foci examined at early passages (passages 8–30) there was no methylation of the seven genes examined. Of two foci examined at late passages (passages 51–86) after the appearance of morphological changes suggestive of transformation, methylation and loss of expression of RASSF1A was detected. Sequencing of the CpG dense region around the transcription start site and semi-quantitative real-time methylation specific PCR (MSP) assay for RASSF1A methylation demonstrated progressive methylation during late passages. Exposure to the demethylating agent 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine restored RASSF1A expression, while exposure to the histone deacetylation inhibitor trichostatin A had no effect. These data, together with our previous findings, support a causal relationship between SV40 infection, progressive RASSF1A methylation and its silencing, and the pathogenesis of mesothelioma."

Diverse extracellular stimuli that promote cell proliferation and differentiation activate cell surface receptors that converge on and promote the transient activation of Ras. Once activated, Ras interacts with and stimulates a spectrum of functionally diverse downstream effectors. These effectors in turn stimulate diverse cytoplasmic signaling cascades that regulate cytoplasmic and nuclear events. Nuclear events include regulation of cell cycle progression and gene expression (3Pruitt K. Der C.J. Cancer Lett. 2001; 171: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 4Murphy G.A. Der C.J.

Activated Ras binds to and promotes the activation of Raf, which activates the MEK1/21dual specificity kinases, which in turn phosphorylate and activate the p42/p44 ERK mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs). Although it is clear that Ras activation of the Raf/MEK/ERK protein kinase cascade is important for Ras transformation, it is now well established that Ras transformation also involves its activation of multiple Raf-independent effector pathways (6Marshall C.J.

Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases (PI3Ks) represent the second best characterized effectors of Ras, and PI3K activation has been shown to be important for Ras transformation of rodent fibroblasts (9Rodriguez-Viciana P.

Approximately 30% of all human cancers express mutated and constitutively activated forms of Ras (14Bos J.L. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 4682-4689PubMed Google Scholar, 15Clark G.J. Der C.J. Dickey B.F. Birnbaumer L. GTPases in Biology I. Springer Verlag, Berlin1993: 259-288Google Scholar). Additionally, the vast majority of these tumors are predominantly of epithelial origin. Because oncogenic Ras has been shown to play an essential role in oncogenesis (16Shirasawa S. Furuse M. Yokoyama N. Sasazuki T. Science. 1993; 260: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar, 17Chin L. Tam A. Pomerantz J. Wong M. Holash J. Bardeesy N. Shen Q. O'Hagan R. Pantginis J. Zhou H. Horner J.W. Cordon-Cardo C. Yancopoulos G.D. DePinho R.A. Nature. 1999; 400: 468-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (760) Google Scholar), research efforts have focused on defining the signaling pathways that mediate growth transformation by oncogenic Ras. Although many signaling components have been shown to be regulated by Ras, attempts to define those critically important for Ras transformation have been complicated by several issues (8Shields J.M. Pruitt K. McFall A. Shaub A. Der C.J. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 147-154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar). First, it is clear that cell type differences exist in the signaling pathways that are regulated by Ras. For example, whereas Ras activation of Raf alone is sufficient to cause transformation of rodent fibroblasts, Ras requires Raf-independent pathways to cause transformation of RIE-1 and a variety of other epithelial cells (18Oldham S.M. Clark G.J. Gangarosa L.M. Coffey Jr., R.J. Der C.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6924-6928Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 19Gire V. Marshall C.J. Wynford-Thomas D.

(2002)Genes Dev., in press. Second, the consequences of transient activation of Ras may differ from those caused by sustained activation of Ras. For example, although transient activation of Ras can activate PI3K, sustained Ras activation did not up-regulate PI3K activity in RIE-1 cells. In contrast to rodent fibroblasts, PI3K was not important for Ras transformation of these epithelial cells (21McFall A. Ulku A. Lambert Q.T. Kusa A. Rogers-Graham K. Der C.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 16: 5488-5499Crossref Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Therefore, delineating the importance of Raf-independent effectors in maintenance of the transformed state by sustained expression of oncogenic Ras in epithelial cells will be critical for understanding the mechanism by which oncogenic Ras promotes human oncogenesis. In addition to the ERK MAPK cascade, oncogenic Ras has been shown to stimulate transient activation of the JNK and p38 MAPK cascades (22Minden A. Lin A. Claret F.-X. Abo A. Karin M. Cell. 1995; 81: 1147-1157Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1447) Google Scholar, 23Whitmarsh A.J. Yang S.-H., Su, M.S.S. Sharrocks A.D. Davis R.J. Mol. Cell.

Martinetto H. Claret F.-X. Lange-Carter C. Mercurio F. Johnson G.L. Karin M. Science. 1995; 268: 286-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (714) Google Scholar). However, whereas ERK MAPKs are activated by stimuli that promote growth and differentiation, p38 and JNK are activated strongly by environmental stress and inflammatory cytokines (26Kyriakis J.M. Avruch J. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 807-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (2897) Google Scholar). In almost all instances, p38 and JNK are activated coordinately by the same stimuli. In contrast to ERK activation, the role of p38 and JNK activation in Ras transformation has not been clearly delineated. The function of a key substrate of JNK, the c-Jun transcription factor, has been shown to be required for Ras transformation of rodent fibroblasts (27Smeal T. Binetruy B. Mercola D.A. Birrer M. Karin M. Nature. 1991; 354: 494-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (699) Google Scholar, 28Granger-Schnarr M. Benusiglio E. Schnarr M. Sassone-Corsi P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

SEK1 is a kinase activator of JNK, and dominant negative SEK1 was shown to block Ras transformation of NIH 3T3 cells (30Clark G.J. Westwick J.K. Der C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1677-1681Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). However, a limitation of these studies is that the approaches for inhibition of the JNK pathway were indirect, and may have blocked activities beyond JNK. For example, how the SEK1 dominant negative works is not clear and may block the activities of the ERK and p38, as well as JNK, MAPK pathways (31Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14553-14556Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The absence of a pharmacologic inhibitor specific for JNK has limited a more precise evaluation of this question. Studies in rodent fibroblasts suggest that p38 acts as a negative regulator of Ras transformation. For example, although transient expression of activated Ras was found to cause activation of p38, further activation of p38 blocked Ras-induced mitogenesis in NIH 3T3 cells (24Chen G. Hitomi M. Han J. Stacey D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38973-38980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) or reversed morphologic and growth transformation (32Ellinger-Ziegelbauer H. Kelly K. Siebenlist U. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3857-3868Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). What is clear from these analyses is that the up-regulation of p38 can block Ras transformation. However, these studies did not determine whether persistent Ras activation causes the up-regulation, or down-regulation, of p38 activity. Finally, the importance of p38 and JNK in Ras transformation of epithelial cells, the cell type from which the vast majority ofras mutation-positive human cancers arise, has not been determined. We have evaluated the possibility that p38 and JNK represent key components of Raf-independent signaling important for Ras transformation of RIE-1 epithelial cells. Previously, we demonstrated that activated Ras, but not Raf, causes transformation of RIE-1 epithelial. Surprisingly, in this study, we found that inhibition of p38, together with Raf activation of ERK, was sufficient to cause the same morphologic and growth transformation caused by activated Ras. Thus, a key action of Raf-independent effector signaling important for Ras transformation involves the down-regulation of p38 activity. Finally, we determined that the regulation and role of the related JNK MAPK was opposite to that seen with p38. Thus, although p38 and JNK are typically activated coordinately, p38 and JNK are regulated differently by oncogenic Ras and have opposing roles in Ras transformation. Mammalian expression vectors containing cDNA sequences encoding constitutively activated mutants of K-Ras4B(12V) or Raf-1 (the NH2-terminal truncated and constitutively activated 22W mutant or the constitutively plasma membrane-targeted Raf-CAAX mutant) have been described previously (18Oldham S.M.

The SB203580 p38 inhibitor (Calbiochem; catalog no. 559389) and the SP600125 JNK inhibitor were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO), and control cultures were treated with the equivalent final concentration of Me2SO (vehicle). Anisomycin (A9739) was purchased from Sigma. Western blot analyses to assess the expression of proteins in cell lysates were done using monoclonal antibodies against cyclin D1 (17-32G-11 and HD-11; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), monoclonal or rabbit polyclonal antibodies against p21CIP1 (Ab4/5; Upstate Biotechnology), a monoclonal antibody against mouse p27Kip1 (K25020; Transduction Laboratories), polyclonal antibodies against a synthetic doubly phosphorylated phospho-p38 MAPK (Thr-180/Tyr-182; 9211; Cell Signaling) or a synthetic peptide derived from human p38 (9212; Cell Signaling), and polyclonal antibodies against a synthetic phospho-Thr71 peptide of ATF2 or a synthetic peptide corresponding to residues 65–77 of human ATF2 (9221S; New England Biolabs). RIE-1 and Bosc23 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. Production of infectious, replication-incompetent retrovirus was achieved by transfection of pBabe-puro expression constructs into the Bosc23 ecotropic packaging cell line (39Pear W.S. Nolan G.P.

K-Ras(12V)-transformed RIE-1 cells were infected by exposure to 5 ml of retroviral supernatant (with a final concentration of Polybrene at 4 μg/ml) and 5 ml of growth medium. Fresh growth medium was added after 5–10 h, and drug selection was initiated 24 h later in 1–2 μg/ml puromycin. For transient expression reporter assays, parental RIE-1 cells were transfected with Superfect or Effectene (Qiagen) as suggested by the protocols of the manufacturer. Briefly, RIE-1 cells were seeded the day prior to transfection and then incubated with plasmid DNA and cationic lipids for 24 h. Cells were harvested with 300 μl of luciferase lysis buffer (BD PharMingen), and 50 μl lysate was analyzed using enhanced chemiluminescence reagents and a Monolight 2010 luminometer (Analytical Luminescence). The cyclin D1-luciferase construct consists of 963 base pairs of the human cyclin D1 promoter controlling the expression of the luciferase gene (40Albanese C. Johnson J. Watanabe G. Eklund N., Vu, D.

RIE-1 cells were transfected with LipofectAMINE PLUS (Invitrogen) according to the protocol of the manufacturer. For each plate, 200 ng of pZIP-H-ras(12V) or 200 ng of pZIP-Neo(SV)x1 empty vector was transfected with 1.8 μg of carrier DNA. Three h after adding DNA mixtures, plates were aspirated and medium was replaced with 4 ml of complete growth medium. Seventeen h after removing the transfection mixtures, growth medium was replaced with 4 ml of complete growth medium supplemented with 0.2% Me2SO (final concentration), or the indicated compound in a final concentration of 0.2% Me2SO.

The SP6000125 (anthrax[1,9-cd]pyrazol-6(2H)-one) JNK inhibitor has been shown to specifically inhibit JNK, and not ERK or p38 kinase activityin vitro and in vivo. It was synthesized and purified as described (42Han Z. Boyle D.L. Chang L. Bennett B. Karin M. Yang L. Manning A.M. Firestein G.S. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 73-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (722) Google Scholar). We showed previously that Ras transformation of RIE-1 rat intestinal epithelial cells required both Raf-dependent and Raf-independent effector activation (18Oldham S.M. Clark G.J. Gangarosa L.M. Coffey Jr., R.J. Der C.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6924-6928Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). However, the specific Raf-independent pathway(s) involved in Ras transformation has not been determined. Because Ras causes activation of the p38 and JNK MAPK cascades via Raf-independent signaling (22Minden A. Lin A. Claret F.-X. Abo A. Karin M. Cell. 1995; 81: 1147-1157Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1447) Google Scholar, 23Whitmarsh A.J. Yang S.-H., Su, M.S.S. Sharrocks A.D. Davis R.J. Mol. Cell.

Chem. 2000; 275: 38973-38980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), we assessed the possible involvement of p38 and JNK activation in Ras transformation of RIE-1 cells. First, we determined the level of p38 activation in untransformed RIE-1 cells stably transfected with empty vector, or RIE-1 cells stably expressing constitutively activated and transforming mutants of Raf-1 or K-Ras4B (Raf-22W and K-Ras(12V); designated RIE(Raf), and RIE(Ras), respectively). Unexpectedly, although transient expression of oncogenic Ras has been shown to activate p38 (22Minden A. Lin A. Claret F.-X. Abo A. Karin M. Cell. 1995; 81: 1147-1157Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1447) Google Scholar, 23Whitmarsh A.J. Yang S.-H., Su, M.S.S. Sharrocks A.D. Davis R.J. Mol. Cell.

Science. 1995; 268: 286-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (714) Google Scholar), we found that p38 activity was reduced in RIE(Ras) cells, when compared with untransformed vector control and RIE(Raf) cells (Fig. 1). Similarly, we found that the activity of ATF-2, a p38 substrate, was also reduced in RIE(Ras) cells when compared with untransformed vector control and RIE(Raf) cells (Fig. 1B). Thus, although transient activation of Ras causes an up-regulation of p38 activity (Fig. 1D), sustained Ras activation resulted in a down-regulation of p38 activity in RIE-1 cells. Our finding that steady-state p38 activity was reduced in RIE(Ras) cells suggested that down-regulation of p38 activity in RIE(Raf) cells may promote transformation. To address this possibility, we utilized SB203580, a pharmacologic inhibitor of p38 (43Cuenda A. Rouse J. Doza Y.N. Meier R. Cohen P. Gallagher T.F. Young P.R. Lee J.C. FEBS Lett. 1995; 364: 229-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (1981) Google Scholar). First, we compared the consequences of p38 inhibition on the morphology of control empty vector-transfected RIE-1 cells or RIE(Raf) cells that display stably up-regulated ERK activity (18Oldham S.M. Clark G.J. Gangarosa L.M. Coffey Jr., R.J. Der C.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6924-6928Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The morphologies of vehicle-treated RIE(Raf) and vector control cells were unchanged and retained the flat, nonrefractile appearance of untransformed RIE-1 cells (Fig. 2A). However, 16 h of treatment with the SB203580 p38 inhibitor caused striking morphologic transformation of Raf-expressing, but not vector control, cells. The treated RIE(Raf) cells showed a highly refractile appearance and were indistinguishable in morphology from RIE(Ras) cells (data not shown). Next, we determined whether p38 inhibition could promote the anchorage-independent growth of RIE(Raf) cells. Like untransformed RIE-1 cells, RIE(Raf) cells fail to grow in soft agar (18Oldham S.M. Clark G.J. Gangarosa L.M. Coffey Jr., R.J. Der C.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6924-6928Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2B, treatment with SB203580 promoted the ability of RIE(Raf) cells, but not untransformed vector control RIE-1 cells, to form colonies in soft agar. Overall, we observed that the colony forming efficiency for 10 μm SB203580-treated RIE(Raf) cells was ∼80% of that for vehicle-treated RIE(Ras) cells. Thus, blocking p38 activity in Raf-expressing cells mimics the consequences of oncogenic Ras and causes morphologic and growth transformation. Because we found that p38 activity was reduced in RIE(Ras) cells, we predicted that stimulation of the p38 pathway would antagonize the transformed phenotype of RIE(Ras) cells. To address this possibility, we established RIE(Ras) cells stably expressing constitutively active MKK6b(EE), a specific upstream kinase activator of p38 (Fig. 3). First, we evaluated these stably expressing MKK6b(EE) for p38 activation and verified that ectopic expression of MKK6b(EE) caused an up-regulation of phospho-p38 levels in RIE(Ras) cells comparable with that observed in RIE(Raf) or untransformed RIE-1 cells (Fig. 3A). Second, we observed that expression of MKK6b(EE) caused a marked reversion of the transformed morphology of RIE(Ras) cells, exhibiting the nonrefractile appearance typical of untransformed RIE-1 cells (Fig.3B). We also found that RIE(Ras) cells expressing MKK6b(EE) were greatly impaired in their ability to grow in soft agar, with a 50% reduction in colony forming activity, as well as a reduction in the size of the colonies that formed (Fig. 3C). However, treatment of RIE(Ras)/MKK6b(EE) cells with SB203580 caused an increase in colony forming efficiency and in colony size, supporting the role of MKK6b(EE)-mediated up-regulation of p38 in inhibiting the anchorage-independent growth of RIE(Ras) cells. Finally, because other activities, such as activation of Raf, have been attributed to SB203580 treatment (44Davies S.P. Reddy H. Caivano M. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 95-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (3957) Google Scholar), the ability of a specific activator of p38 (MKK6) to reverse Ras transformation argues that the effects of this inhibitor on RIE(Raf) cells are caused by inhibition of p38 activity. We next wanted to determine a mechanism for p38 regulation of Ras transformation. One possibility was suggested by the previous demonstration that p38 activity antagonizes transcription from the cyclin D1 promoter (45Lavoie J.N. L'Allemain G. Brunet A. Müller R. Pouysségur J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20608-20616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1089) Google Scholar). We observed recently that Ras but not Raf can cause transformation of RIE-1 cells, and that Ras but not Raf could up-regulate cyclin D1 protein expression and function (46Pruitt K. Pestell R.G. Der C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40916-40924Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Thus, we asked whether SB203580 treatment of RIE(Raf) cells would mimic this consequence of Ras activation. Strikingly, similar to RIE(Ras) cells, we found that RIE(Raf) cells treated with the p38 inhibitor showed an increase in the steady-state level of cyclin D1 protein (Fig.4). We also found that MKK6b(EE)-mediated up-regulation of p38 activity in RIE(Ras) cells caused a 2–3-fold reduction in steady-state levels of cyclin D1 (Fig. 3A). Finally, we utilized a reporter plasmid where luciferase gene expression is under the control of the human cyclin D1 promoter (40Albanese C. Johnson J. Watanabe G. Eklund N., Vu, D. Arnold A. Pestell R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23589-23597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (764) Google Scholar) and determined that p38 negatively regulates cyclin D1 protein expression at the level of gene transcription (Fig.5). We determined that co-expression of a kinase inactive and dominant negative form of p38, p38γ(AF), augmented cyclin D1 promoter stimulation.FIG. 5p38 is a negative regulator of transcription from the cyclin D1 promoter. Transient expression analyses were done in RIE-1 cells stably expressing activated Raf-22W or K-Ras(12V) to evaluate the role of p38 in regulating the expression from a reporter plasmid, where the luciferase gene is under the control of the human cyclin D1 promoter. We showed previously that expression of this reporter is stably up-regulated in cells expressing activated Ras but not Raf (46Pruitt K. Pestell R.G. Der C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40916-40924Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Whereas expression of dominant-negative (AF), but not wild type, p38γ, stimulated up-regulation of transcription from the cyclin D1 promoter in RIE(Raf) cells (A), expression of activated MKK6b(EE) causes down-regulation of transcription from the cyclin D1 promoter in RIE(Ras) cells (B). Further inhibition was seen when MKK6b(EE) was co-expressed with wild type p38α. Data shown are representative of three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Previously, we observed that the steady-state levels of two cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors, p21CIP1 and p27KIP1, were altered by Ras but not Raf in RIE-1 cells (46Pruitt K. Pestell R.G. Der C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40916-40924Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Whereas p27KIP1 expression was reduced, p21CIP1 expression was elevated, in RIE(Ras) but not RIE(Raf) cells (Fig. 4). Treatment of RIE(Raf) cells with SB203580 also caused an up-regulation of p21CIP1, but did not cause the down-regulation of p27KIP1 protein levels that is seen in RIE(Ras) cells. Thus, p38 inhibition may promote Ras transformation,"

The former two organisms are opportunistic human pathogens, and the latter is a pathogen of horses. Members of this family of proteins have been implicated in a range of human diseases, including staphylococcal food poisoning, scarlet fever, toxic shock, rheumatoid arthritis, and secondary HIV infection (1Kotzin B.L.

As a result of their close association with serious human pathologies, superantigens have been the subject of intense research over the last decade during which several reviews have been published (3Fraser J.

These were first described by Williams and colleagues (6Williams R.J. Ward J.M. Henderson B. Poole S. O'Hara B.P. Wilson M. Nair S.P. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 4407-4415Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) as a cluster of five related genes in which the protein products were reported to stimulate the production of interleukin-1β, interleukin-6, and tumor necrosis factor α from human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. The complete genome sequences for two strains of S. aureus subsequently showed that this cluster contains a total of 10 genes in one strain and 9 in the second strain, with these genes related by sequence identities of 36–67%. The SET gene cluster represents half of a pathogenicity island, SaPIn2, shown in Fig. 1. Downstream (3′) to the SET gene cluster is a set of nine lplgenes that contain lipoprotein attachment sites and are thought to code for pathogenic proteins (7Kuroda M. Ohta T. Uchiyama I. Baba T. Yuzawa H. Kobayashi I. Cui L. Oguchi A. Aoki K. Nagai Y. Lian J. Ito T. Kanamori M. Matsumaru H. Maruyama A. Murakami H. Hosoyama A. Mizutani-Ui Y. Takahashi N.K. Sawano T. Inoue R. Kaito C.

The pathogenicity island is flanked at the 5′ end by a putative transposase and is also thought to be maintained in the genome by two genes, hsdS and hsdM, which are part of a three-component restriction-modification system. The SET genes are most closely related, by sequence, to toxic shock syndrome toxin (TSST), which is a staphylococcal superantigen. The overall sequence identity is low, at only 26%, but there are small regions that are very well conserved as compared with superantigens. Thus, the SET proteins carry the SAg signature sequences. Previous structural and functional studies of superantigens have revealed the capacity of these proteins to graft a wide variety of functional modes onto a conserved fold (5Sundberg E.J., Li, Y. Mariuzza R.A. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2002; 14: 36-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 8Arcus V.L. Proft T. Sigrell J.A. Baker H.M. Fraser J.D. Baker E.N. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 299: 157-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). For example, different superantigens variously bind to MHC-II molecules via their N-terminal domain (SEB, TSST) (9Jardetzky T.S.

Martin R. Schuck P. Schlievert P.M. Mariuzza R.A. Immunity. 2001; 14: 93-104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). They are able to cross-link MHC-II molecules at the cell surface by simultaneous N- and C-terminal binding in the case of SEA (12Tiedemann R.E. Fraser J.D. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 3958-3966PubMed Google Scholar) or by dimerization in the case of SPE-C (13Roussel A. Anderson B.F. Baker H.M. Fraser J.D. Baker E.N. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 635-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The superantigens also show allelic variation among strains (SMEZ-2) (14Proft T. Moffatt S.L. Weller K.D. Paterson A. Martin D. Fraser J.D. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 191: 1765-1776Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) and varying degrees of specificity for alleles of the TCR (15Li H. Llera A. Mariuzza R.A. Immunol. Rev. 1998; 163: 177-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The availability of genomic sequence data has transformed our knowledge of the distribution of superantigens and superantigen-like proteins in bacterial species. The completion of theS. pyogenes genome sequence (16Ferretti J.J. McShan W.M. Ajdic D. Savic D.J. Savic G. Lyon K. Primeaux C. Sezate S. Suvorov A.N. Kenton S. Lai H.S. Lin S.P. Qian Y. Jia H.G.

A. 2001; 98: 4658-4663Crossref PubMed Scopus (770) Google Scholar) revealed six new superantigens for which structures and functions have been characterized (17Proft T. Moffatt S.L. Berkahn C.J. Fraser J.D. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 89-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Although it is unsurprising that the staphylococcal genome would also encode a new group of superantigen-like proteins, the structural and functional variation in this family leaves many questions as to their activity. Here, we describe the first structure of a protein from the SET gene cluster, SET3. The structure reveals that although the superantigen fold is conserved and, by inference, is also conserved among the other SET proteins, there is evidence that they do not function as prototypic superantigens. We also show, however, that they are likely to have a significant role in host/pathogen interactions in humans, because seroconversion is widespread and antibody titers in human serum are high in the majority of tested cases. Theset3 gene was amplified by PCR from genomic DNA isolated from a local hospital strain (Auckland, New Zealand) of S. aureus. The gene was subcloned into the expression vector pET32a3C and expressed in Escherichia coli(AD494) as an N-terminal thioredoxin fusion protein. The fusion protein was purified by Ni2+ affinity chromatography, cleaved using 3C protease, and subjected to Ni2+ affinity chromatography again to separate SET3 from thioredoxin. Pure SET3 was finally obtained by size exclusion chromatography (Superdex 75, AmershamBiosciences). Dynamic light scattering data for the final concentrated protein solution (12 mg · ml−1SET3) indicated a monodisperse solution of monomeric protein. The molecular mass calculated from the hydrodynamic radius was 29 kDa compared with the calculated molecular mass of 24.16 kDa. Other SET proteins for biochemical studies were produced similarly. SET3 (6 μg) was mixed with 0.5 mCi of 125I in 20 μl of 5× PBS and 5 μl 1 mg · ml−1 chloramine T and incubated for 1 min. 5 μl of 5 mg · ml−1 sodium metabisulfite was added to this solution, and the volume was made up to 50 μl with PBS, 1% FCS. This was then loaded onto a 1-ml G25 column pre-equilibrated with PBS, 1% FCS, and the protein was eluted in 100-μl fractions. An aliquot from each fraction (1 μl) was counted using a Cobra II γ-counter. 5 μl of human serum was incubated with 105 cpm of SET3125I in a total volume of 50 μl of Tris-buffered saline + azide (TSA; 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 140 mmNaCl, 0.025% NaN3), 10% FCS, and 1% Hb at 37 °C for 30 min. 5 μl of protein A-Sepharose was added, and the sample was incubated on ice for 30 min. After washing three times in 0.5 ml of radioimmune precipitation buffer (1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 1% bovine hemoglobin, 1 mm iodoacetamide), the sample was analyzed using a Cobra II γ-counter. A control containing no serum was used to determine the background count. S. aureus clinical isolates were cultured overnight without shaking at 37 °C. After centrifugation to remove the bacteria, 0.5 ml of culture supernatant was concentrated by precipitation with 50% trichloroacetic acid and resuspended in 5 μl of PBS. Samples were subjected to electrophoresis by 12% SDS-PAGE. The proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose using a semidry blotter. The membrane was blocked for 1 h at room temperature in TTBS (0.1% Tween 20 in TBS), 5% (w/v) nonfat milk powder. A 1/500 dilution of mouse anti-SET3 polyclonal serum was then incubated with the membrane for 1 h at room temperature in blocking buffer. After being washing in TTBS, the membrane was incubated with a 1/1000 dilution of peroxidase-labeled anti-mouse IgG for 1 h at room temperature. The membrane was then washed in TBS (Tris-buffered saline; 100 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.9% w/v NaCl) and analyzed using an ECL Western blotting detection kit from Amersham Biosciences. A 5-fold serial dilution (in triplicate) from 1 to 2.05 × 10−8 μg · ml−1 of each protein tested was set up in 96-well plates in a volume of 100 μl RPMI, 10% FCS/well. One row of wells was set up with no protein added as a negative control. Mononuclear cells were isolated from whole blood by Ficoll separation, washed, and suspended at 106 cells/ml in RPMI, 10% FCS. 100 μl of cells were added to each well, and the plates were incubated in 5% CO2 for 3 days. 25 μl of [3H]thymidine was added to each well and incubated overnight. The cells were harvested onto filter mats using a Tomtec harvester, and the incorporated [3H]TdR was analyzed using a Trilux counter. SET3 crystals were grown in hanging drops at 18 °C by mixing 2 μl of protein solution (20 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.0, 12 mg · ml−1 SET3) with 2 μl of precipitant solution (either 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 1.5 m ammonium sulfate or 50 mm HEPES pH 7.0, 0.9 msodium/potassium tartrate). Hexagonal plates and blocks typically emerged after 4 days and then grew larger over a period of 2 weeks. X-ray diffraction measurements showed that the crystals were hexagonal, space group P63, with unit cell dimensions a = b = 65.1 and c = 196.7 Å. Two molecules occupy the asymmetric unit, giving a solvent content in the crystal of 45% (v/v). The crystals could be flash-frozen for data collection by soaking in cryoprotectant (mother liquor plus 30% glycerol) immediately prior to placement in a stream of cold N2 gas (110 K). Native and derivative data sets for SET3 were collected using CuKα radiation from a Rigaku RU-H3R x-ray generator equipped with focusing mirrors and a Mar345 imaging plate detector. Subsequently, a high-resolution native data set was collected using synchrotron radiation (λ = 0.8452 Å) at DESY Hamburg, beamline BW7V. The raw data were processed using DENZO and subsequently scaled using SCALEPACK (18Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38252) Google Scholar).

Berendzen J. Acta Crystallogr. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 849-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (3216) Google Scholar. Open table in a new tab The structure of SET3 was determined by multiple isomorphous replacement (MIR) using three heavy atom derivatives. These were prepared by soaking SET3 crystals in KAu(CN)2 (5 mm), K2PtCl6 (1 mm), and Hg(CH3COO)2 (1 mm) for periods of 1–7 days. The multiple isomorphous replacement analysis was carried out in the higher symmetry space group of P6322 (one molecule in the asymmetric unit) using the program SOLVE (19Terwilliger T.C. Berendzen J. Acta Crystallogr. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 849-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (3216) Google Scholar), incorporating isomorphous and anomalous differences. Two sites were found for the KAu(CN)2 derivative and single, identical sites were found for the K2PtCl6 and Hg(CH3COO)2 derivatives. The initial phases from SOLVE were calculated to 2.8 Å and gave a figure of merit of 39% and a Z-score of 16.7. These phases were checked by refinement using MLPHARE (27Collaborative Computing Project Number 4Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19667) Google Scholar), extended to 2.3 Å, and then improved by maximum likelihood density modification using RESOLVE (20Terwilliger T.C. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 1755-1762Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). The program MAID (21Levitt D.G. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 1013-1019Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) was used to auto-trace 65 residues, and subsequently a further 44 residues manually were built using O (22Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (12999) Google Scholar). Side chains were added for 23 residues with the remainder left as alanine. A single round of phased refinement indicated that the symmetry constraints of P6322 were too high, and the space group symmetry was therefore lowered toP63 with two molecules in the asymmetric unit. The model, now comprising 218 residues, was used to determine initial phases for WARP (23Lamzin V.S. Wilson K.S. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 269-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar), and the remainder of the two molecules was built automatically by WARP using data in the resolution range of 30 to 1.90 Å. Finally, five iterations of manual building and refinement using O and CNS (24Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16918) Google Scholar) were undertaken to finish the structure determination. Refinement statistics are given in Table I. Structural comparisons were performed using the program MAPS (bioinfo1.mbfys.lu.se/TOP/maps.html), and comparison trees were constructed from structure diversity scores as described previously (8Arcus V.L. Proft T. Sigrell J.A. Baker H.M. Fraser J.D. Baker E.N. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 299: 157-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The three-dimensional structure of SET3 was determined by x-ray crystallography and refined using data to 1.90 Å resolution. The final model comprises residues 5–204 of both molecule 1 and molecule 2, these comprising the two molecules in the crystal asymmetric unit, together with 378 solvent molecules, modeled as water. Three or four residues (83–86 molecule A and 84–86 molecule B) from the β4–β5 loop in the N-terminal domain have poorly defined density in each molecule and have not been modeled; these residues are assumed to be disordered. Overall, the fit to the electron density is excellent and the structure conforms well with the x-ray data and with expected protein geometry. The final R (Rfree) values are 0.205 (0.240), and 90.6% of the 393 residues in the two independent molecules have φ/ψ torsion angles in the most favored regions of the Ramachandran plot as defined by PROCHECK (CCP4, 1994). Two residues in each molecule (Asp104 and Lys160 with φ/ψ angles −142°/−115° and 48°/−122°, respectively) are in generously allowed regions of the plot, and one residue in each molecule (Asp118, φ/ψ angles 49°/−112°) occupies a disallowed region. Both Asp118 and Lys60 are central residues in type II′ β-turns, which accounts for their unusual φ/ψ angles (see Fig. 2). Asp118 is part of the tight turn that links β-strands β6 and β7. However, Lys60 is part of a β-turn that does not link secondary structure elements and is flanked on both sides by loops. Asp104 lies between two tyrosine residues in a tightly packed structure that includes one leucine and three tyrosine residues, which may constrain Asp104 in its unusual φ/ψ geometry. This Asp residue is conserved in 6 of 10 SET proteins. The electron density for each of these three residues (Asp118, Lys60, Asp104) in each SET molecule in the asymmetric unit is unequivocal and, at least in the case of Lys60 and Asp104, their consistent, nonstandard geometry points toward their possible significance as functional residues for SET3. SET3 has the classic two-domain structure characteristic of proteins of the superantigen family (Fig.2). Most of the N-terminal half of the molecule (residues 24–97) is folded into a 5-stranded β-barrel called an OB-fold (25Murzin A.G. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 861-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (758) Google Scholar), and the C-terminal half, residues 98–204, into a β-grasp domain, in which a 5-stranded mixed β-sheet packs over an amphipathic α-helix that is the most sequence-conserved feature of these proteins. The two domains are bridged by an N-terminal helix, residues 11–23. The two domains pack together to form an irregularly shaped molecule with approximate dimensions of 50 × 37 × 23 Å3. The SET3 structure has two notable features that differentiate it from other SAg family proteins for which structures have been solved to date. First, the strands β6 and β7 in the C-terminal domain are extended so that the β6–β7 loop projects from the molecular surface (the strands flank D118, Fig. 2). In the crystal, the two independent molecules in the asymmetric unit are related by a pseudo 2-fold axis about β7, and this extended loop forms a β-sheet with the same loop of the second molecule. The surface area buried in the crystallographic dimer interaction is small (287 Å2/monomer) and it appears that this “dimer” does not persist in solution, because dynamic light scattering indicates a monomer. However, the formation of this dimer includes six intermolecular hydrogen bonds and constructs a large and continuous β-sheet of 10 strands between the two monomers. This, in turn, presents a large, positively charged, saddle-shaped surface (Fig. 2) that has the potential to act as a binding surface for negatively charged molecules such as DNA. This highlights a second striking feature of the structure, in the widespread positive charge over the protein surface. Although lysine and arginine residues are scattered across the surface, they are concentrated at the capping helix and outer face of the N-terminal OB-fold domain and in the saddle-shaped face formed by the association of the two molecules in the asymmetric unit described above. We suggest that these areas are likely binding sites for negatively charged binding partners. Proteins from the superantigen family are well represented in the current structural data base, SET3 being the 14th such structure from this family to be determined. When these proteins are compared as a whole, it is apparent that the structural core is conserved, with 76 residues occupying equivalent Cα positions and a root-mean-square difference of 1.15 Å (for those 76 residues) but with only five residues conserved at the sequence level. SET3 and TSST form an out-group from the remainder of the SAg-like proteins such that if these two structures are omitted from the alignment, 113 residues share equivalent Cα positions (with a root-mean-square difference of 0.95 Å for those 113 residues) and 16 residues are conserved in the sequence. These 16 residues appear to be conserved for their role in preserving the superantigen fold and, apart from glycines, are almost exclusively involved in buried charge-charge or polar interactions between elements of the secondary structure. Most are concentrated around the interdomain region and appear to help maintain the close association of the two domains. When the SET3 and TSST structures are overlaid, 127 Cα positions are within 3.5 Å with a root-mean-square difference of 1.15 Å and 37 sequence identities in this conserved core. Again, the majority of the residues that are conserved in sequence and in structure between TSST and SET3 play clear structural roles either by contributing to the hydrophobic core or with their side chains forming buried charge-charge interactions or hydrogen bonds with main-chain atoms. The exceptions to this are Lys114, Lys160, and Glu200 (SET3 numbering), all of which are on the outer face of the C-terminal β-grasp domain, and Asn150, Asp16, and Asp19, on the opposite face of the β-grasp domain in proximity to the N-terminal helix. These six residues do not, however, correspond to any equivalent residues in TSST that are involved in either MHC-II binding or TCR interactions (10Kim J. Urban R.G. Strominger J.L. Wiley D.C. Science. 1994; 266: 1870-1874Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). In this context, the structure suggests that it is most unlikely that SET3 could bind to either MHC-II or the TCR in a manner similar to TSST. For example, 15 residues from TSST interact with MHC-II upon binding (10Kim J. Urban R.G. Strominger J.L. Wiley D.C. Science. 1994; 266: 1870-1874Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar) and, after structural alignment, just 2 of these residues are conserved between TSST and SET3 (see Fig.3). Of the remaining 13 MHC-II binding residues, the differences between TSST and SET3 include Asp →Tyr, Arg → Ile, Leu → Arg, and Pro → Gly. These nonconservative changes at the binding face argue strongly against any similar binding of SET3 to MHC II. There are other significant structural differences between TSST and SET3. In comparison with TSST, SET3 has an elongated loop (residues 37–42) that connects strands β1 and β2 on the surface of its N-terminal domain. In SET3, the N-terminal β-barrel is also capped by an α-helix (residues 58–68, linking β3 and β4) that is missing in TSST but present in all of the other superantigens and is also a general feature of the OB-fold (25, Fig. 3). The loop that leads into the C-terminal domain, residues 99–107, has a very different conformation in SET3 when compared with TSST. In SET3 this loop is solvent-exposed and contains Asp104, which occupies a generously allowed region of the Ramachandran plot and may be important for SET3 function. As described above, SET3 also has elongated β-strands β6 and β7 at the periphery of the C-terminal β-sheet (residues 116–129). There is preliminary evidence that SET3 has allelic variants in different strains of S. aureus. Two strains have been sequenced from isolates from Greenlane Hospital in Auckland, New Zealand, and these differ from each other and from the two sequences described by Williams et al. (6Williams R.J. Ward J.M. Henderson B. Poole S. O'Hara B.P. Wilson M. Nair S.P. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 4407-4415Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) and Kurodaet al. (7Kuroda M. Ohta T.

Lancet. 2001; 357: 1225-1240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1564) Google Scholar). When these four SET3 proteins are aligned they vary at 35 positions. 17 of these positions are concentrated on the two outer β-strands of the C-terminal β-sheet, β6 and β7, whereas the remaining 18 positions are scattered across the protein (see Fig. 4). Five of the 37 residues are buried hydrophobic residues, and their allelic variants are also hydrophobic, but all other residues are surface-exposed. Allelic variation has also been reported for SET1 and is suggested by the sequence differences between the allelic pairs SET1/11, SET2/8, SET3/10, SET4/14 and SET5/13. Three recombinant proteins from the SET family, SET1, SET3, and SET15, were used in a typical peripheral blood lymphocyte stimulation assay to assess their mitogenicity. The ability to stimulate the proliferation of T-cells in a TCR Vβ-restricted manner is a hallmark of superantigens. TSST was used as a positive control, and reaches maximum stimulation at 1 ng · ml−1. In all cases and at all concentrations, however, the SET proteins showed no capacity to induce T-cell proliferation (see Fig. 5). Polyclonal antibodies to the SET proteins were raised in mice. α-SET3 was used to detect for the presence of SET3 in the culture supernatants of sixS. aureus clinical isolates. These isolates were randomly chosen from a panel of 20 clinical isolates, all of which were found to be positive for the SET3 gene by PCR. Western analysis of the supernatants concentrated 50 times by trichloroacetic acid precipitation showed that SET3 is secreted by S. aureus in all cases (see Fig. 6). Radioactively labeled SET1 and SET3 were immunoprecipitated using a panel of human sera together with protein A-Sepharose. Serum from 15 healthy individuals was incubated with radioactively labeled SETs to detect for the presence of antibodies against these proteins. All individuals showed positive seroconversion, indicating that they had all been exposed to these proteins at some time (see Fig.7). The set family of genes encode a new and large family of SAg-like proteins. As a family they are most closely related to TSST by sequence, and the 9–10 set genes lie consecutively on the S. aureus genome (7Kuroda M. Ohta T. Uchiyama I. Baba T. Yuzawa H. Kobayashi I. Cui L. Oguchi A. Aoki K. Nagai Y. Lian J. Ito T. Kanamori M. Matsumaru H. Maruyama A. Murakami H. Hosoyama A. Mizutani-Ui Y. Takahashi N.K. Sawano T. Inoue R. Kaito C. Sekimizu K. Hirakawa H. Kuhara S.

Lancet. 2001; 357: 1225-1240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1564) Google Scholar), almost certainly as a result of gene duplications. Divergence of these genes within the genome is marked and, as is characteristic of the whole superantigen family with which they share sequence similarity, is presumed to have given rise to structurally homologous proteins with different but related functions. The structure of SET3, the first protein from the SET family, and the first from the SaPIn2 pathogenicity island in the S. aureus genome, shows clearly that this, and by implication the other SET proteins, belongs to the wider superantigen superfamily. The most striking feature of this superfamily is the diversity of functions (and sequences) supported by their highly conserved structural framework (5Sundberg E.J., Li, Y. Mariuzza R.A. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2002; 14: 36-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 8Arcus V.L. Proft T. Sigrell J.A. Baker H.M. Fraser J.D. Baker E.N. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 299: 157-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Sequence conservation is limited to residues that confer structural integrity, particularly in and around the interdomain region, whereas the protein surfaces vary considerably. Variations include changed external loops and metal binding sites, in addition to changes in specific surface residues, which lead to differences in their interactions with MHC-II and TCR molecules. These variations accompany a remarkably narrow genealogy, a single ancestral gene duplicating in just three known species of Staphylococcusand Streptococcus, despite the potential for further spread through horizontal gene transfer. The SET proteins mark a further functional divergence. SET1, -3, and -15 do not stimulate T-cells nor do they bind to MHC-II. Thus, they do not function as nonspecific activators of the immune system in the way that the prototype superantigens do. Structurally this is consistent with our observation that in SET3, at least, there is no conservation of the residues that are involved in MHC-II or T-cell receptor binding in the other superantigen structures and sequences. Without exception, the residues that are strictly conserved among the SET family are structural. This gives no clue to the function of SET3 but does point strongly to the likelihood of differing functions for proteins within the SET family. We have modeled seven of the SET sequences onto the SET3 structure, and our hypothesis of varied function is supported from inspection of the surface features of the different SET proteins. For example, SET15 has a low predicted pI of 6.5 (cf. 9.6 for SET3), and this is reflected in the surface charge on the protein, which shows a large area of negative charge on one face of the protein and a large area of positive charge on the opposite face. The failure to stimulate T-cell proliferation in no way excludes the SET proteins from being important virulence factors. They are secreted by the bacteria, both in vitro and in vivo, and seroconversion is present in the majority of patients that we have tested so far, with high antibody titers in these subjects. The pathogenicity island SaPIn2 appears to be important to the organism, as it is maintained in the genome by two restriction-modification genes in the center of the island (the third member of the trio, the restriction enzyme, lies remote from the pathogenicity island). Remnants of gene duplication and transfer may also be found in the transposase gene at the 5′ end of SaPIn2. This finding further supports the importance and prevalence of these proteins as agents of host/pathogen interactions. The superantigen family of proteins continues to surprise. Recently, the complete genome sequences of both S. pyogenes and S. aureus have led to the identification of 28 superantigens and superantigen-like proteins. In many individual cases, allelic variation between strains augments this number, and the sequence variation covers the continuum from individual amino acid substitutions through <10% sequence identity between members of the family. The structure of SET3 shows that the conserved superantigen architecture can support yet further functional variation, and the presence of nine related homologs that are adjacent in the genome suggests that these proteins are important to the pathogenicity of Staphylococcus."

https://openalex.org/W2326999130,"Elevated expression of HMGA1 and HMGA2 proteins is correlated with a highly malignant phenotype in several human tumors. We previously demonstrated that the block of HMGA2 protein synthesis prevented rat thyroid cell transformation by murine retroviruses. Suppression of HMGA2 synthesis was associated with lack of induction of HMGA1 proteins suggesting that both HMGA1 and HMGA2 play a role in the process of neoplastic transformation. To determine the role of the HMGA1 gene in thyroid cell transformation, we blocked HMGA1 protein synthesis by an antisense methodology. Here we report that transfection of an HMGA1 cDNA antisense construct into a normal rat thyroid cell line (FRTL-5 Cl2), followed by infection with Kirsten murine sarcoma virus (KiMSV), generated a transformed cell line that expresses high levels of the v-ras-Ki oncogene and that does not require thyroid-stimulating hormones for growth. However, this cell line does not show the malignant phenotype, i.e., it neither grows in soft agar nor induces tumors after injection in athymic mice. Moreover, the lack of the neoplastic phenotype in the virus-infected thyroid cells carrying the HMGA1 antisense construct correlates with the absence of induction of AP-1 transcriptional activity."

https://openalex.org/W2018731520,"Death receptor 4 (DR4; also called TRAIL-R1), a member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily, is a cell surface receptor that triggers the apoptotic machinery upon binding to its ligand tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL). Although several chemotherapeutic agents were reported to induce DR4 expression, the mechanism of this effect remains largely unknown. To begin to understand its regulation, we cloned a 1.8 Kb 5′-flanking region of the human DR4 gene and identified several putative binding sites for transcription factors including activator protein 1 (AP-1). Among the three putative AP-1 binding sites, the site located at −350/−344 is functionally active as evidenced by a combination of electrophoretic mobility shift and luciferase reporter assays. The AP-1 activator phorbol 12–myristate 13-acetate (TPA) enhanced the binding of this DR4 AP-1 binding site to protein(s) in a nuclear extract from TPA-treated cells, increased luciferase activity of a reporter construct containing this site and induced DR4 expression at the transcription level. These results indicate that AP-1 regulates DR4 expression via the AP-1 binding site located at −350/−344. AP-1 has been implicated in many critical cellular processes including apoptosis, and is a major target of the c-Jun NH3-terminal kinase signaling pathway that is activated by many anticancer drugs. Therefore, our findings may increase the understanding of the mechanisms underlying AP-1-mediated apoptosis as well as drug-induced apoptosis."

https://openalex.org/W2056247020,"The capability for electrogenic inward transport of substrates that carry different net charge is a phenomenon observed in a variety of membrane-solute transporters but is not yet understood. We employed the two-electrode voltage clamp technique combined with intracellular pH recordings and the giant patch technique to assess the selectivity for bidirectional transport and the underlying stoichiometries in proton to substrate flux coupling for electrogenic transfer of selected anionic, cationic, and neutral dipeptides by the intestinal peptide transporter PEPT1. Anionic dipeptides such as Gly-Asp and Asp-Gly are transported in their neutral and negatively charged forms with high and low affinities, respectively. The positive transport current obtained with monoanionic substrates results from the cotransport of two protons. Cationic dipeptides can be transported in neutral and positively charged form, resulting in an excess transport current as compared with neutral substrates. However, binding and transport of cationic dipeptides shows a pronounced selectivity for the position of charged side chains demonstrating that the binding domain of PEPT1 is asymmetric, both in its inward and outward facing conformation. The simultaneous presence of identically charged substrates on both membrane surfaces generates outward and, unexpectedly, enhanced inward transport currents probably by increasing the turnover rate. The capability for electrogenic inward transport of substrates that carry different net charge is a phenomenon observed in a variety of membrane-solute transporters but is not yet understood. We employed the two-electrode voltage clamp technique combined with intracellular pH recordings and the giant patch technique to assess the selectivity for bidirectional transport and the underlying stoichiometries in proton to substrate flux coupling for electrogenic transfer of selected anionic, cationic, and neutral dipeptides by the intestinal peptide transporter PEPT1. Anionic dipeptides such as Gly-Asp and Asp-Gly are transported in their neutral and negatively charged forms with high and low affinities, respectively. The positive transport current obtained with monoanionic substrates results from the cotransport of two protons. Cationic dipeptides can be transported in neutral and positively charged form, resulting in an excess transport current as compared with neutral substrates. However, binding and transport of cationic dipeptides shows a pronounced selectivity for the position of charged side chains demonstrating that the binding domain of PEPT1 is asymmetric, both in its inward and outward facing conformation. The simultaneous presence of identically charged substrates on both membrane surfaces generates outward and, unexpectedly, enhanced inward transport currents probably by increasing the turnover rate. giant patch clamp two-electrode voltage clamp Most of the rheogenic membrane-solute carriers for cellular uptake of nutrients or xenobiotics carry only a small set of neutral substrates in cotransport with either protons or sodium ions. However, some of the transporters including the proton-coupled intestinal peptide transporter PEPT1 mediate electrogenic substrate influx independent of the net charge of the substrates. In case of PEPT1 there are at least 400 different dipeptides and 8000 different tripeptides that can serve as substrates including all possible mono- or polyvalently charged species. One of the unsolved problems in transport physiology of solutes is how a carrier protein can transport differently charged substrates in the same general transport mode. Several studies have documented that the transport of zwitterionic (at neutral pH) dipeptides by PEPT1 is electrogenic based on a proton to substrate flux coupling ratio of 1:1 (1Fei Y.J. Kanai Y.

However, dipeptides carrying net positive or negative charge have also been found to generate transport currents, although cotransport of a negatively charged substrate with protons would be electrically silent when occurring with a fixed 1:1 flux coupling stoichiometry. The observed positive inward current in the case of anionic dipeptides is not unequivocally clear but was suggested to result either from a higher (e.g. 2:1) coupling ratio (4Steel A. Nussberger S.

Acta. 1996; 1284: 125-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar).In case of positively charged dipeptides, transport currents are explained by flux of the cationic substrate together with at least one proton (2Mackenzie B.

Only in a few cases have trans-stimulation phenomena been observed, i.e. the presence of transportable substrate on the “trans” side of the cell membrane enhanced the transport of substrate applied to the “cis” side (5Meredith D.

These data indicate that substrates bound to the cytosolic binding site of PEPT1 can enhance the inwardly directed transport most likely by an accelerated return of the loaded transporter to the extracellular side (10Nussberger S.

The mutual effects of extracellular and intracellular substrates on the transport process have never been systematically studied.To address the questions of how transport currents of differently charged substrates can be explained and how trans-stimulation can alter transport function, we have characterized the peptide transport function of PEPT1 with the Xenopus expression system and two different electrophysiological methods. By using the giant patch clamp (GPC)1 technique, we have recently shown that the neutral dipeptide Gly-Gln is transported by PEPT1 not only in the “normal” (inward) but also in the outward direction (i.e. from the cytosol to the extracellular space), even if the apparent substrate binding affinity on the intracellular side was substantially lower. It was also shown that when the dipeptide Gly-Gln was simultaneously present at both membrane surfaces at saturating concentrations and in the absence of a pH gradient, transport is symmetrical and occurs as a linear function of the membrane potential.Here we analyzed specifically the bidirectional transport of positively and negatively charged dipeptides by employing two pairs of substrates with the same charged amino acid residues in either the amino- or in the carboxyl-terminal position of the dipeptide. Two-electrode voltage clamp recordings (TEVC) and GPC experiments provided evidence that even the position of the charged amino acid side chain in a substrate is affecting the transport process and the associated membrane currents. Simultaneous recordings of transport currents in TEVC and intracellular pH measurements allowed us to calculate proton to charge transfer stoichiometries and the simultaneous application of identical dipeptide substrates to both membrane surfaces in GPC experiments provided trans-stimulation phenomena that shed light onto the carrier cycling and mode of transport.MATERIALS AND METHODSXenopus laevis oocytes were collected under anesthesia (immersion in a solution of 0.7 g/liter of 3-aminobenzoic acid ethyl ester; Sigma) from frogs that were killed with an anesthetic overdose after the final collection. Oocytes were treated with 2.5 mg/ml collagenase for 90 min and were separated manually thereafter. They were incubated in a Barth solution containing (in mm) NaCl 88, KCl 1, MgSO4 0.8, CaCl2 0.4, Ca(NO3)2 0.3, NaHCO3 2.4, HEPES 10 (pH 7.5) at 17 °C overnight. Thereafter stage V/VI oocytes were injected with 25 ng of rabbit PEPT1-cRNA in a 50-nl volume and incubated for 3–6 days at 17 °C.TEVC and GPC experiments were performed as described previously (11Kottra G. Daniel H. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2001; 536: 495-503Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In short, oocytes were placed in an open chamber and continuously superfused with Barth solution or with solutions containing the substrates to be studied. Oocytes were voltage-clamped at −60 mV using a TEC-05 amplifier (NPI Electronic, Tamm, Germany), and current-voltage (IV) relations were measured immediately before and 20–30 s after substrate application in the potential range of −160 to +80 mV. The current generated by the peptide transport at a given membrane potential was calculated as the difference of the currents measured in the presence and the absence of substrate. Positive currents denote positive charges flowing out of the oocyte.Patch pipettes of 20–30 μm diameter were prepared from thin-walled borosilicate glass capillaries (MTW-150, WPI, Berlin, Germany) and were filled with a solution containing (in mm) NaCl 10, NaISE 80, MgSO4 1, Ca(NO3)2 1, HEPES 10, titrated to pH 7.5, and connected to an EPC-9 amplifier. After removing of the vitelline layer and gigaseal (1–10 gigohms) formation pipettes were moved to a perfusion chamber and continuously superfused with the control bath solution composed of (in mm) potassium aspartate 100, KCl 20, MgCl2 4, EGTA 2, HEPES 10 (pH 7.5). During experiments the membrane potential was clamped to −30 mV, and IV relations in the potential range of −120 to +60 mV were measured in the same way as described for TEVC experiments. The data were recorded with the PULSE (HEKA, Lambrecht, Germany) and evaluated with the PATCH (courtesy of Dr. Bernd Letz) program.Dipeptides (L-isomers) were obtained from Sigma or Bachem, Heidelberg, Germany, and were added to the solutions in concentrations indicated in the text. After addition of dipeptides the pH was readjusted if necessary. The percentage of the zwitterionic form at a given pH was calculated with pK values taken from Ref. 12Sober H.A. Sober H.A.

Wenzel, personal communication. (Gly-l-Gln, pK1 = 2.88 and pK2 = 8.29; Gly-Asp, pK1= 2.81, pK2 = 4.45, and pK3 = 8.60; Asp-Gly, pK1 = 2.10, pK2 = 4.53, and pK3 = 9.07; Gly-Lys, pK1 = 2.90, pK2 = 8.20, and pK3 = 10.50; Lys-Gly, pK1 = 3.00, pK2 = 8.10, and pK3 = 10.70).The transport parameters Km (mm) and Imax (nA or pA) were calculated from least square fits to the Michaelis-Menten equation. To be able to perform kinetic analysis and to determine validly Imax values that depend on the expression level of the transporter, all substrate concentrations and pH effects were analyzed in the same oocyte. This required a reduction of the number of data points for analysis from 3 to 4 in TEVC and to 5 in GPC experiments. Substrate concentrations were 0.5, 2, and 5 mm for Lys-Gly (pH 7.5 and 8.5), Gly-Lys (pH 7.5), Gly-Asp and Asp-Gly (pH 5.5), whereas 2, 5, and 10 mm were used for Gly-Lys (pH 8.5) and Asp-Gly (pH 7.5), and 2, 5, 10, and 20 mm were applied to calculate the kinetic parameters of Gly-Asp at pH 7.5. In GPC experiments, the concentrations were 1, 2.5, 5, 10, and 20 mm for all substrates tested.To determine charge to proton flux ratios of different dipeptides, TEVC measurements were combined with intracellular pH measurements. pH microelectrodes were made from borosilicate capillaries that were pulled to about 10 μm tip diameter. Electrodes were silanized as described before (13Seki G. Coppola S. Fromter E. Pfluegers Arch. 1993; 425: 409-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), and the tip was filled with Fluka hydrogen ionophore I mixture B (catalog number 95293) overnight. Electrodes were backfilled prior to use with a solution containing (in mm) KH2PO4 40, NaOH 23, NaCl 15, pH 7.0. pH electrodes were connected to an FD223 amplifier (WPI, Berlin, Germany). The reference channel of the amplifier was connected to the voltage output signal of the TEC-05 amplifier. The slope of the pH decline between 30 and 150 s was taken as a measure of acidification and was related to the charge transfer that was calculated as the integral of substrate-evoked current flow during the same period. Because intracellular pH did often not completely recover during a 5–10-min washout period after the first substance application, to avoid systematic errors the application sequence of dipeptides was varied.Data are given as the mean ± S.E. of n experiments. Statistically significant differences (p < 0.05) were determined with the Student’s t test for paired or non-paired data as appropriate.DISCUSSIONThe electrogenic transport not only of neutral but also of charged dipeptides by the intestinal transporter PEPT1 addresses one of the unsolved problems in transport physiology, and that is how the protein can handle differently charged substrates in the same transport mode. We have determined the transport characteristics of glycyl-dipeptides carrying non-charged or charged side chains by measuring transport currents under voltage clamp conditions in oocytes simultaneously with changes in pHin and by applying the giant patch technique. From analysis of transport currents and intracellular pH measurements, we conclude (see Fig. 7) the following: (a) the cationic dipeptide Lys-Gly is transported in both the zwitterionic and positively charged form, whereas Gly-Lys is transported by PEPT1 only in its neutral form; (b) the anionic dipeptides Gly-Asp and Asp-Gly are transported in uncharged form, but a minute fraction of charged form can be transiently protonated in the very proximity of the membrane and is thus translocated virtually as charged species together with two protons; and (c) Lys-Gly and Gly-Asp but not Gly-Lys and Asp-Gly can bind to PEPT1 on the cytosolic site and are transported in the outward direction.From our analysis we conclude that the substrate binding pocket of PEPT1 is asymmetric, both in its inward and outward facing conformation as well as with respect to the accommodation of the different side chains in substrates. Apparent substrate affinities of all dipeptides tested are generally much lower on the inside than the outside under otherwise identical conditions and show a pronounced dependence for the amino- or carboxyl-terminal location of charge in a substrate. The simultaneous presence of charged substrates on the extracellular and cytosolic membrane side amplifies inward and outward currents in an unexpected manner depending on transmembrane potential and the net charge of the substrate.Stoichiometry of Flux CouplingAlthough previous studies (2Mackenzie B. Fei Y.J. Ganapathy V. Leibach F.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1284: 125-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 4Steel A. Nussberger S. Romero M.F. Boron W.F. Boyd C.A.R. Hediger M.A. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1997; 498: 563-569Crossref Scopus (93) Google Scholar) already suggested that PEPT1 can transport dipeptides with a charge to substrate stoichiometry ratio other than 1:1, we unequivocally demonstrated here that even dipeptides with the same chemical composition and carrying the same charge show different transport characteristics. In the case of Lys-Gly, both Imax calculations and simultaneous current and pH measurements under voltage clamp conditions led us conclude that this substrate and to a lesser extent also Arg-Gly are transported in neutral as well as in positively charged form and therefore generate higher transport currents than zwitterionic substrates. This was not the case for the reversed substrates Gly-Lys and Gly-Arg that possess essentially the same dissociation constants for the ionized groups but in a different conformational position. Based on our data only 17% (about 1/6th) of the Gly-Lys molecules (those present in neutral form) are recognized by the transporter in contrast to 100% of the Lys-Gly molecules, and correspondingly the Km values at pH 7.5 vary about 6-fold. The higher Km value for Gly-Lys than for Lys-Gly (2.2 versus 0.91 mm) has also been found at an extracellular pH 6 in a previous study (14Terada T. Sawada K. Irie M. Saito H. Hashimoto Y. Inui K. Pfluegers Arch. 2000; 440: 679-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). PEPT1 therefore binds cationic glycyl-dipeptides (at least those with lysine residues) much better when the extra charge is in the amino-terminal position. It is interesting to note that the modification of the ε-amino group of an amino-terminal lysine residue in a dipeptide with either a Z-group or a Z(NO2)-group renders such a compound into an effective inhibitor of PEPT1, whereas identical modifications in carboxyl-terminal lysine residues retained the compounds capable of transport (15Knutter I. Theis S. Hartrodt B. Born I. Brandsch M. Daniel H. Neubert K. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 4454-4458Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). This all strongly argues for asymmetry in the binding pockets that accommodate amino- or carboxyl-terminal side chains, but this asymmetry not only affects substrate affinity but also the charge transfer ratio in a transport cycle. New peptide transport inhibitors that block the transport cycle of the closely related PEPT2 protein also suggest distinctly different pockets that accommodate the side chains and that may contain different residues that interfere with the charged side chains in substrates (16Theis S. Hartrodt B. Kottra G. Neubert K. Daniel H. Mol. Pharmacol. 2002; 61: 214-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar).Published transport data on monoanionic dipeptides showed electrogenicity, but there is no agreement on how this positive inward current is generated. It could result (a) from the cotransport of one substrate molecule together with two protons (3Amasheh S. Wenzel U. Boll M. Dorn D. Weber W.M. Clauss W. Daniel H. J. Membr. Biol. 1997; 155: 247-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 4Steel A. Nussberger S. Romero M.F. Boron W.F. Boyd C.A.R. Hediger M.A. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1997; 498: 563-569Crossref Scopus (93) Google Scholar), or (b) from the cotransport of one proton per substrate molecule and a simultaneous countertransport of one negatively charged counterion such as OH− or HCO 3− (2Mackenzie B. Fei Y.J. Ganapathy V. Leibach F.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1284: 125-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). An alternative explanation could be the preferential transport of only the zwitterionic form of the substrate with one proton (17Wenzel U. Gebert I. Weintraut H. Weber W.M. Clauss W. Daniel H. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1996; 277: 831-839PubMed Google Scholar, 18Fei Y.J. Nara E. Liu J.C. Boyd C.A. Ganapathy V. Leibach F.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1418: 344-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) with unknown changes in the pKa values of the ionized groups in the hydrophobic membrane environment. Because current measurements alone do not allow the distinction between these possibilities, we have simultaneously measured transport currents and acidification rates of the cytosolic compartment under voltage clamp conditions. At a pHout of 5.5 and at equal currents, transport of Gly-Asp is accompanied by ≈1.7 times faster intracellular acidification rate than in case of Gly-Gln, suggesting that the majority of Gly-Asp is transported with two protons from which one could be carried by the protonated side chain carboxyl group. In addition, lowering pH titrates more substrate into its neutral form, and this form shows increased binding affinity to PEPT1 on both membrane faces. When the zwitterionic substrate form is bound and transported in the inward direction, the higher intracellular pH causes deprotonation of Gly-Asp with the delivery of the additional proton and turns the dipeptide into a charged, but now low affinity type substrate. A possible countertransport of an anion such as OH− of HCO 3− which would acidify the cytosol as suggested previously (2Mackenzie B. Fei Y.J. Ganapathy V. Leibach F.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1284: 125-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) would require a further binding pocket for such an anion on the “trans”-side (the cytosolic side) of PEPT1. This anion binding pocket would be needed and occupied only when anionic dipeptides are transported, and this seems most unlikely.In the case of the tested anionic dipeptides, the shift of the acidic side chain from the amino- to the carboxyl-terminal half changed binding affinities only modestly. The Km values were very similar but increased for both substrates dramatically at low pH (pH 5.5) when the percentage of the zwitterionic species increased from essentially 0 to 8–10% of total substrate present.Michaelis-Menten kinetic parameters open the possibility to compare not only substrate affinities but also the Imax currents which, on the other hand, allow some insights into the mode of operation of the transporter. Pre-steady state kinetics of PEPT1 (19Mackenzie B. Loo D.D. Fei Y. Liu W.J. Ganapathy V. Leibach F.H. Wright E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5430-5437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) were consistent with an ordered, simultaneous transport model in which protons bind first to the transporter followed by substrate binding and translocation. Theoretical analysis predicts in such a model that Imax currents at saturating substrate concentration become independent of the concentration of the cotransported ion (H+) (20Jauch P. Lauger P. J. Membr. Biol. 1986; 94: 117-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Our present data do not fully support the model proposed by Mackenzie and co-workers (19Mackenzie B. Loo D.D. Fei Y. Liu W.J. Ganapathy V. Leibach F.H. Wright E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5430-5437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) because the Imax values do in some cases show a dependence on the pH (i.e. the concentration of the cotransported ion) for both the inward and outward direction of transport. The largest deviations could be observed with Gly-Lys in the inward and Gly-Asp in the outward direction. This might be explained by pH-dependent changes in substrate charge but also by pH-dependent alterations of the transporter protein and its conformation. However, the exact determination of Imax here is limited by the low affinities, and a more detailed analysis is required to judge whether the proposed model is valid in all cases.Trans-stimulationWe have also analyzed how transport rate of a given substrate is altered in the presence of substrate on the cytosolic side which resembles a physiological condition. Only very few studies using oocytes, renal or intestinal brush-border membrane vesicles, or epithelial cell in culture that express PEPT1 have analyzed trans-stimulation events in peptide transport (5Meredith D.

An acceleration of the transporter-mediated influx of peptide substrates was occasionally observed when cells or vesicles were preloaded with dipeptides or peptide-like drugs in tracer flux studies. These trans-stimulation phenomena are in accordance with a model proposed in which the turnover rate of the carrier is determined by the return of the unloaded protein to the outer surface and in which the loaded transporter could cycle faster back to the external membrane site (10Nussberger S. Steel A. Trotti D. Romero M.F. Boron W.F. Hediger M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7777-7785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar).GPC studies as used in the present study offer important advantages in analyzing such mutual cis-trans effects on substrate translocation. In GPC experiments, the substrates and their concentrations on both membrane surfaces can be freely selected, and by recording I-V relationships, the potential dependence of trans-stimulation processes can be measured. Moreover, alterations of the membrane potential on inward and outward transport processes can be investigated independently. In the case of PEPT1, at high negative membrane potentials (−120 mV), inwardly directed transport dominates, whereas at +60 mV the inward current is reduced and current flows into the reverse direction.Our GPC experiments performed in the absence of cytosolic substrates show unidirectionality of transport, because in this model system, transport was not able to build up significant substrate concentrations on the trans-side. Addition of substrate to the cytosolic side reduces the transmembrane substrate gradient and results in a bidirectional transport (of the same substrate) probably at an increased turnover rate (see above). When the flux coupling ratio for substrate to cotransported proton is equal in both directions, the net inward current will decrease by outwardly directed transport despite the increased turnover rate. This was indeed observed in our previous experiments with Gly-Gln (11Kottra G. Daniel H. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2001; 536: 495-503Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In the present study we observed important differences in transport behavior between uncharged and charged dipeptides. Instead of reducing the steady state inward transport currents of Lys-Gly and Gly-Asp by cytosolic substrate addition, currents increased in a concentration-dependent fashion when the same substrate species was present inside. Now, this would be a strong indication of a trans-stimulation event, but it also suggests that the stoichiometric ratios in the inward and outward transport direction may not be equal. At high inside negative membrane potentials more positive charges per transported substrate molecule must pass the membrane in the inward direction than in the opposite direction for increased influx currents.For Lys-Gly, a possible explanation might be that at physiological pH (pH 7.5 on both membrane sides) about 83% of all substrate molecules are protonated, i.e. positively charged with the remainder in zwitterionic form. A negative potential on the trans side of the membrane evokes an electrophoretic movement and attracts the positively charged molecules toward the membrane resulting in a higher local concentration in the vicinity of the membrane. The positively charged species then preferentially occupies the binding site of PEPT1. On the opposite membrane surface the concentration of positively charged molecules decreases in relation to the zwitterionic species leading to a lower charge to substrate flow coupling ratio.The same explanation may not be valid for Gly-Asp that is present at pH 7.5 almost exclusively in its negatively charged form. Because two cotransported protons per Gly-Asp molecule are required to generate a po"

Wiegand S.J. Yancopoulos G.D. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 5356-5362Crossref PubMed Scopus (669) Google Scholar). The activating ligand angiopoietin-1 (Ang1) potently blocks increases in vascular permeability induced by inflammatory agents and vascular endothelial growth factor (9Thurston G. Rudge J.S. Ioffe E.

In contrast, angiopoietin-2 (Ang2) is required for vascular endothelial growth factor-induced corneal angiogenesis (11Yancopoulos G.D. Davis S. Gale N.W. Rudge J.S. Wiegand S.J. Holash J. Nature. 2000; 407: 242-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (3285) Google Scholar), suggesting that Ang2 blocks the actions of Ang1 to promote vascular destabilization and facilitate angiogenesis. Inhibition of Tie2 with a soluble extracellular domain protein blocks tumor growth, angiogenesis, and metastasis (5Lin P. Buxton J.A. Acheson A. Radziejewski C. Maisonpierre P. Yancopoulos G.D.

Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 3185-3191PubMed Google Scholar). Based on these findings, there has been significant interest in understanding the molecular mechanisms of Tie2 activation in order to develop therapeutic agents for angiogenic diseases such as cancer. Recently, insights into Tie2 activation were provided by a solution of the Tie2 crystal structure (12Shewchuk L.M. Hassell A.M. Ellis B. Holmes W.D. Davis R. Horne E.L. Kadwell S.H. McKee D.D. Moore J.T. Structure. 2000; 8: 1105-1113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). This structural analysis revealed several novel features, including two potential autoinhibitory mechanisms. Unlike other RTKs, in which the activation loop (A-loop) obstructs substrate or ATP binding in the inactive state, the A-loop of Tie2 assumes an “active-like” conformation, which would appear to facilitate substrate binding. However, the nucleotide binding loop adopts an apparent inhibitory conformation, with the side chains of several residues in this loop occupying the ATP binding site. An additional level of enzyme control is provided by the carboxyl terminus of Tie2, which appears to obscure the substrate binding site (Fig. 1). In the unphosphorylated state, the hydroxyl groups of two important tyrosine residues, Tyr1101 and Tyr1112 (murine residue numbers), are hydrogen-bonded to surrounding residues, which may stabilize the C tail in this inhibitory conformation. Glutamate 1120 also appears to stabilize this conformation by forming a salt bridge with the arginine residue at position 914. These novel inhibitory mechanisms suggest that Tie2 activation is distinct from that of other RTKs and that it may be more complex. In this report, we investigated the role of the C tail in Tie2 kinase activation, downstream signaling, and function. To do this, we generated Tie2 kinase constructs in which C-terminal amino acid residues were deleted based on their apparent positions in the Tie2 crystal structure. Our results demonstrate that deletion of the Tie2 C tail results in significant increases in receptor autophosphorylation and kinase activity. Moreover, these increases correlate with enhanced downstream signaling through Akt and inhibition of apoptosis. These findings may have implications for the design of small molecule Tie2 kinase inhibitors and for our understanding of vascular morphogenesis. NIH 3T3 cells were from American Type Culture Collection. Mouse monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (clone PY99) and BD-Transduction Laboratories (RC20-AP) (Lexington, KY). Anti-phospho-Akt (Ser473), anti-phospho-p44/42-ERK (Thr202/Tyr204), and anti-cleaved caspase-3 (D175) rabbit polyclonal antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling Technologies (Beverly, MA). Rat monoclonal anti-c-fms (CSF-1 receptor) antibody (clone 3–4A4-E4) was from Calbiochem. The rabbit polyclonal anti-Tie2 juxtamembrane domain (MTJM) antibody has been described previously (13Huang L. Turck C.W. Rao P. Peters K.G. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 2097-2103PubMed Google Scholar). Rat monoclonal anti-α-tubulin was from Harlan Bioproducts. Recombinant human colony stimulating factor-1 (CSF-1) was generously provided by Genetics Institute (Cambridge, MA). Goat anti-rat IgG agarose was from Sigma. The recombinant wild type (WT) GST-Tie2 kinase fusion protein expressed in Sf9 insect cells has been described previously (13Huang L. Turck C.W. Rao P. Peters K.G. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 2097-2103PubMed Google Scholar, 14Kontos C.D. Stauffer T. Yang W.-P. York J.D. Huang L. Blanar M.A. Meyer T. Peters K.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4131-4140Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). The Tie2 C tail deletion mutant (ΔCT) was generated by PCR using the wild type kinase domain cDNA as a template with the following primers, which delete amino acid residues 1108 to 1123 in the C tail of murine Tie2: forward primer, 5′-GACCGAATTCCTCGAGCTTAAGAGAGCAAATGTCCAAAGG-3′; reverse primer, 5′-GACCGCGGCCGCCTCGAGCTAATACAGTGTGGTGTTCACGTATGT-3′. The resultant cDNA was sequenced and subcloned into the baculovirus expression vector pV1KS (15Huang L. Sankar S. Lin C. Kontos C.D. Schroff A.D. Cha E.H. Feng S.-M., Li, S.-F., Yu, Z. Van Etten R.L.

Chem. 1999; 274: 38183-38188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), which is derived from pVL-1393 (PharMingen) and contains sequences for GST, a heart muscle kinase tag, and an influenza hemagglutinin epitope. These additional sequences result in a baculovirus-expressed GST-ΔCT protein that is larger than GST-Tie2-WT, despite the loss of 16 amino acid residues. The GST-ΔCT protein was expressed in Sf9 insect cells and purified as described previously (13Huang L. Turck C.W. Rao P. Peters K.G. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 2097-2103PubMed Google Scholar). NIH 3T3 cells expressing fTie2-WT have been described previously (14Kontos C.D. Stauffer T. Yang W.-P. York J.D. Huang L. Blanar M.A. Meyer T. Peters K.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4131-4140Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). To generate fTie2-ΔCT, the ΔCT cDNA replaced that of the WT Tie2 kinase in the retroviral expression plasmid LNCX-fTie2 (14Kontos C.D. Stauffer T. Yang W.-P. York J.D. Huang L. Blanar M.A. Meyer T. Peters K.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4131-4140Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), resulting in fusion of ΔCT with the extracellular and transmembrane domains of human c-fms. Recombinant ecotrophic retroviruses were generated, and monoclonal cell lines were selected and analyzed as described previously (14Kontos C.D. Stauffer T. Yang W.-P. York J.D. Huang L. Blanar M.A. Meyer T. Peters K.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4131-4140Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Tie2 kinase autophosphorylation was analyzed essentially as described previously (13Huang L. Turck C.W. Rao P. Peters K.G. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 2097-2103PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, ∼500 ng of each fusion protein was purified on glutathione-Sepharose and then maximally autophosphorylated in vitro by incubation for 20 min at room temperature with 50 μm unlabeled ATP and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (6,000 Ci/mmol; AmershamBiosciences) in 100 μl of kinase buffer. Proteins were eluted by boiling into Laemmli sample buffer, separated by SDS-8% PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and evaluated by autoradiography and by Western blotting with anti-phosphotyrosine. Tie2 kinase activity was analyzed using the previously described D1–15 peptide (biotin-Ahx-LEARLVAYEGWVAGKKK-NH2) (16Deng S.J. Liu W. Simmons C.A. Moore J.T. Tian G. Comb. Chem. High Throughput Screen. 2001; 4: 525-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) as a substrate. The peptide was chemically synthesized by BioSource International (Hopkinton, MA). Approximately 500 ng of each GST-kinase fusion protein was purified on glutathione Sepharose in triplicate and used in an in vitrokinase reaction with 1 mm unlabeled ATP and 2 μm peptide in 100 μl of kinase buffer. Kinase reactions were carried out at room temperature for the indicated time and stopped by the addition of 50 μm EDTA. The Sepharose beads were pelleted by centrifugation, and the supernatant containing the biotinylated peptide substrate was bound to wells of a streptavidin-coated 96-well plate (StreptaWell; Roche Molecular Biochemicals) by incubation at room temperature for 1 h. After washing with phosphate-buffered saline, the wells were incubated with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-phosphotyrosine (RC20-AP; 1:1000) for 1 h at room temperature. RC20-AP binding was detected by incubation with p-nitrophenyl phosphate (Roche Molecular Biochemicals catalog no. 726923) for 30 min at room temperature, which results in a reaction product detectable at 405 nm. Absorbance was measured on a Molecular Devices Vmax kinetic microplate reader. NIH 3T3 cells expressing chimeric fTie2 receptors were grown in 100-mm dishes until just subconfluent, serum-starved overnight in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without serum, and then stimulated with CSF-1 (500 ng/ml) for 10 min at 37 °C. The cells were lysed, and the receptors were immunoprecipitated as described previously (14Kontos C.D. Stauffer T. Yang W.-P. York J.D. Huang L. Blanar M.A. Meyer T. Peters K.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4131-4140Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) except that immunoprecipitates were immobilized on goat anti-rat IgG-agarose (Sigma). Western blotting was performed with the indicated antibodies, as described previously (14Kontos C.D. Stauffer T. Yang W.-P. York J.D. Huang L. Blanar M.A. Meyer T. Peters K.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4131-4140Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 17Kontos C.D. Cha E.H. York J.D. Peters K.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1704-1713Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). To detect Tie2, a polyclonal antibody against the juxtamembrane domain was used, since Tie2-ΔCT lacks the epitope recognized by the previously described C tail antibody (13Huang L. Turck C.W. Rao P. Peters K.G. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 2097-2103PubMed Google Scholar). Apoptosis of fTie2-expressing cells was quantified following treatment with staurosporine (Calbiochem) using two different assays. To quantify caspase-3 activation, cells were plated at 1× 106 cells/well of a six-well plate, grown for 24 h, and then serum-starved 16 h in the absence or presence of CSF-1 (500 ng/ml). Apoptosis was then induced by incubation with staurosporine (0.5 μm) for 2 h at 37 °C. The cells were lysed, and caspase-3 activity was analyzed using the colorimetric ApoAlert Caspase-3 Assay Kit (CLONTECH) according to the manufacturer's instructions (17Kontos C.D. Cha E.H. York J.D. Peters K.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1704-1713Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Alternatively, the cells were plated in wells of a 24-well plate and grown to confluence. The cells were again serum-starved in the absence or presence of CSF-1 (500 ng/ml), and apoptosis was induced with staurosporine, but apoptosis was quantified using the Cell Death Detection ELISA-Plus Kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals catalog no. 1774425). All results were expressed as the mean ± S.E. Statistical analysis was performed using the one-tailed Student's t test (two-sample, unequal variance), and p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. The crystal structure of the Tie2 kinase was recently solved (12Shewchuk L.M. Hassell A.M. Ellis B. Holmes W.D. Davis R. Horne E.L. Kadwell S.H. McKee D.D. Moore J.T. Structure. 2000; 8: 1105-1113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) and suggested a potentially novel autoinhibitory role for the carboxyl terminus. In this structure, the initial residues of the Tie2 C tail (1101–1107; murine residue numbers) point away from the active site (Fig. 1). Immediately after tyrosine 1107, the C tail angles upward toward the active site, where it appears to obscure access to the substrate binding pocket of the kinase. This conformation appears to be maintained, in part, by hydrogen bonding of the hydroxyl residue of tyrosine 1112 and packing of its phenyl ring by adjacent residues. In addition, the C tail appears to be stabilized by salt bridging of glutamate 1120 to nearby residues. We investigated the role of the C tail in Tie2 autophosphorylation and kinase activation by generating a mutant in which the C-terminal 16 amino acid residues, including Tyr1112 and Glu1120 (residues 1108–1123), were deleted (termed ΔCT). Notably, this mutation preserves tyrosine 1101, which has been shown to regulate phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase/Akt signaling by Tie2 (14Kontos C.D. Stauffer T. Yang W.-P. York J.D. Huang L. Blanar M.A. Meyer T. Peters K.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4131-4140Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). GST-Tie2 kinase fusion proteins were generated and purified on glutathione-Sepharose, and autophosphorylation was evaluated by both Western blotting with anti-phosphotyrosine and incorporation of [γ-32P]ATP. Consistent with our previous results, Tie2-WT was detectably autophosphorylated in both assays (Fig. 2). Deletion of the C tail dramatically enhanced Tie2 autophosphorylation, despite the removal of Tyr1112, which was previously shown to be an important autophosphorylation site (13Huang L. Turck C.W. Rao P. Peters K.G. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 2097-2103PubMed Google Scholar). Based on this increase in autophosphorylation, we asked whether the kinase activity of the ΔCT mutant against an exogenous substrate would be enhanced compared to Tie2-WT. To do this, we performedin vitro kinase reactions using a synthetic peptide substrate that has been shown to be phosphorylated efficiently by Tie2 (12Shewchuk L.M. Hassell A.M. Ellis B. Holmes W.D. Davis R. Horne E.L. Kadwell S.H. McKee D.D. Moore J.T. Structure. 2000; 8: 1105-1113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 16Deng S.J. Liu W. Simmons C.A. Moore J.T. Tian G. Comb. Chem. High Throughput Screen. 2001; 4: 525-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). An equal amount of each GST-kinase protein was purified on glutathione-Sepharose and incubated with a fixed concentration of unlabeled ATP and biotinylated peptide substrate for various times. Tyrosine phosphorylation of the peptide substrate by Tie2-WT gradually increased over 60 min at room temperature (Fig.3). In contrast, activity of ΔCT increased significantly by 20 min and remained significantly greater than that of WT (from 2- to 6-fold greater). Taken together, these findings indicate that the Tie2 C tail negatively regulates receptor autophosphorylation and kinase activity. We showed previously that chimeras consisting of the extracellular and transmembrane domains of the CSF-1 receptor and the cytoplasmic kinase domain of Tie2 (designated fTie2) are autophosphorylated and signal through PI 3-kinase/Akt following CSF-1 stimulation (14Kontos C.D. Stauffer T. Yang W.-P. York J.D. Huang L. Blanar M.A. Meyer T. Peters K.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4131-4140Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). To determine whether the increased Tie2 autophosphorylation and kinase activity of the ΔCT mutant observedin vitro were biologically relevant, we generated stable cell lines expressing fTie2 receptors bearing the ΔCT mutation. Receptor expression and CSF-1-induced autophosphorylation were evaluated in three independent clones of fTie2-ΔCT and compared with that of fTie2-WT. Consistent with our previous findings, CSF-1 induced a modest but detectable increase in fTie2 tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 4A). In contrast, all three clones of ΔCT displayed markedly greater ligand-induced phosphorylation than fTie2-WT. Moreover, the ΔCT clones all demonstrated basal receptor phosphorylation that was similar to or greater than that of WT in the presence of CSF-1. One clone of ΔCT-expressing cells, ΔCT.9, had receptor expression levels that were similar to those of fTie2-WT. For this cell line, both basal and CSF-1-dependent autophosphorylation were dramatically increased compared with WT. These findings suggest that the ΔCT mutant is at least partly active in the absence of ligand, consistent with the release of an autoinhibitory mechanism. We next asked whether the enhanced autophosphorylation of ΔCT corresponded with enhanced Tie2 signaling. Perhaps the best characterized signaling pathway for Tie2 is the PI 3-kinase/Akt pathway (14Kontos C.D. Stauffer T. Yang W.-P. York J.D. Huang L. Blanar M.A. Meyer T. Peters K.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4131-4140Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 18Kim I. Kim H.G., So, J.N. Kim J.H. Kwak H.J. Koh G.Y. Circ.

Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9102-9105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar). Tie2 has also been shown to induce ERK phosphorylation (21Fujikawa K. de Aos Scherpenseel I. Jain S.K. Presman E. Christensen R.A. Varticovski L. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 663-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), although the activation of this signaling protein does not correlate with mitogenesis, and its precise role in Tie2 function is not yet known. Because receptor expression and autophosphorylation were nearly identical in two of the fTie2-ΔCT clones (clones 7 and 10), we chose one of these lines for subsequent analysis of signaling and cellular responses. Therefore, responses of fTie2-WT were compared to those of ΔCT.9, which had receptor expression comparable to that of WT, and compared to ΔCT.7 for analysis of a lower receptor-expressing clone. CSF-1 induced a modest but detectable phosphorylation of Akt and ERK-1 and -2 in fTie2-WT cells (Fig. 4B). For both clones of ΔCT tested, these proteins were basally phosphorylated as much as or more than by fTie2-WT in the presence of ligand, and CSF-1 induced a further increase in their phosphorylation. These findings indicate that the enhanced autophosphorylation and kinase activity of ΔCT translate into increased recruitment and activation of downstream substrates, such as PI 3-kinase. Activation of the PI 3-kinase/Akt signaling pathway by Tie2 has been linked to inhibition of apoptosis (18Kim I. Kim H.G., So, J.N. Kim J.H. Kwak H.J. Koh G.Y. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 24-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar, 19Jones N. Master Z. Jones J. Bouchard D. Gunji Y. Sasaki H. Daly R. Alitalo K. Dumont D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30896-30905Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 20Papapetropoulos A. Fulton D. Mahboubi K. Kalb R.G. O'Connor D.S., Li, F. Altieri D.C. Sessa W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9102-9105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar); therefore, we investigated whether the enhanced signaling by ΔCT improved cell survival. Because the cell lines described here were derived from NIH 3T3 cells, we induced apoptosis by treatment with staurosporine in the absence of serum. Two different clones of ΔCT-expressing cells and fTie2-WT cells were serum-starved overnight in the absence or presence of CSF-1 and then treated with staurosporine. Cell lysates were analyzed by Western blotting for Akt phosphorylation and cleaved caspase-3, which correlates with the induction of apoptosis. Following overnight CSF-1 treatment, Akt was again phosphorylated in fTie2-WT cells, and this effect correlated with a reduction in caspase-3 cleavage (Fig. 5). In the low receptor-expressing cells, ΔCT.7, Akt phosphorylation was detectable at base line and increased with CSF-1 treatment. Consistent with this finding, cleaved caspase-3 was only minimally detectable in the absence or presence of CSF-1. In the high receptor-expressing cells, ΔCT.9, Akt phosphorylation and caspase-3 cleavage were more dramatically altered compared with fTie2-WT, and virtually no cleaved caspase-3 was detectable in these cells. To quantify the effects of ΔCT expression on apoptosis, we assayed caspase-3 activity and histone-associated DNA fragmentation, both of which have been shown to correlate with changes in apoptosis (22Huang J. Kontos C.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10760-10766Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Consistent with our Western blotting results, CSF-1 stimulation of fTie2-WT or -ΔCT significantly reduced caspase-3 activation and DNA fragmentation (Fig. 6, A and B). Strikingly, removal of the C tail of Tie2 resulted in an even greater reduction in both measures of apoptosis. Taken together, these results demonstrate that the ΔCT mutation results in a significant reduction in apoptosis. The recent solution of the Tie2 crystal structure suggests several potential mechanisms of autoinhibition (12Shewchuk L.M. Hassell A.M. Ellis B. Holmes W.D. Davis R. Horne E.L. Kadwell S.H. McKee D.D. Moore J.T. Structure. 2000; 8: 1105-1113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). These include blockade of the ATP binding site by residues within the nucleotide binding loop, impairment of ATP binding by residues within the A-loop, and obstruction of the substrate binding site by the C tail. In this report, we investigated the potential autoinhibitory role of the Tie2 C tail by evaluating the effects of a C tail deletion mutant on Tie2 kinase activity, signaling, and function. Deletion of the C tail enhanced Tie2 autophosphorylation and kinase activity both in vitro and in vivo, and these effects correlated with enhanced activation of Akt and inhibition of apoptosis. Taken together, these findings confirm that the C terminus negatively regulates Tie2 function, and they have implications for the design of therapeutic Tie2 inhibitors as well as for understanding the effects of naturally occurring Tie2 mutations on vascular morphogenesis. A variety of different regulatory mechanisms have been demonstrated for RTKs, and many of these have been either identified or confirmed by crystal structure analyses (23Blume-Jensen P. Hunter T. Nature. 2001; 411: 355-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (3140) Google Scholar). For example, tyrosine 1162 in the activation loop of the insulin receptor is bound in cis in the active site to prevent access by both ATP and peptide substrates (24Hubbard S.R. Wei L. Ellis L. Hendrickson W.A. Nature. 1994; 372: 746-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (958) Google Scholar); the activation loops of the fibroblast growth factor receptor-1 (FGFR1) and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 kinases are positioned to block substrate binding (25Mohammadi M. Schlessinger J. Hubbard S.R. Cell. 1996; 86: 577-587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar, 26McTigue M.A. Wickersham J.A. Pinko C. Showalter R.E. Parast C.V.

Des. 1999; 7: 319-330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (167) Google Scholar); and the juxtamembrane domain of EphB2 interferes with both ATP positioning within the catalytic site and proper positioning of the activation loop for catalysis (27Wybenga-Groot L.E. Baskin B. Ong S.H. Tong J. Pawson T. Sicheri F. Cell. 2001; 106: 745-757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Of the published RTK crystal structures, only that of Tie2 suggests negative regulation by its C terminus. However, many RTKs that have been crystallized lack certain domains, such as the C tail, which limits the conclusions that can be drawn about their precise mechanisms of regulation. Of particular relevance here, the FGFR1 protein used to analyze its crystal structure lacked the C tail (25Mohammadi M. Schlessinger J. Hubbard S.R. Cell. 1996; 86: 577-587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Lorenzi et al. (28Lorenzi M.V. Castagnino P. Chen Q. Chedid M. Miki T. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 817-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) later demonstrated that several C-terminal deletion mutations of FGFR2 resulted in increased transforming activity of the receptor, although no increases in basal tyrosine phosphorylation or ERK activation were observed. In fact, several of these deletion mutants displayed reduced or absent autophosphorylation in response to fibroblast growth factor, probably due to the removal of key autophosphorylation sites, but the corresponding tyrosine to phenylalanine mutants displayed similar transforming activity. These findings suggest that negative regulation by the FGFR2 C tail is a result of specific signaling pathways regulated by this domain rather than a structural phenomenon. A negative regulatory role for the C tail has been demonstrated biochemically for at least two other RTKs, although in neither case has the kinase domain been crystallized. Substitution of the C-terminal 50 amino acid residues of c-fms with 11 residues of v-fms results in enhanced receptor autophosphorylation and transforming activity despite the removal of one tyrosine residue, although it is not clear whether this residue is autophosphorylated in vivo(29Woolford J. McAuliffe A. Rohrschneider L.R. Cell. 1988; 55: 965-977Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Akiyama et al. (30Akiyama T. Matsuda S. Namba Y. Saito T. Toyoshima K. Yamamoto T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 833-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) demonstrated that deletion of the C-terminal 230 residues of ErbB2 enhanced the receptor's kinase activity as well as its cellular transforming ability. The C tail of ErbB2 contains ∼270 residues, which is much longer than that of Tie2 or most other RTKs. As a result, perhaps it is not surprising that it could interfere with enzymatic activity, although structural data are not available to confirm the mechanism of this inhibition. By comparison, the ΔCT mutation used for our studies removes a relatively short segment of only 16 residues, and the dramatic effects of this mutation are consistent with structural data indicating that the C tail inhibits substrate access by binding to nearby residues. Together, structural and biochemical studies of RTKs have provided insights into the mechanisms of kinase activation following ligand-mediated oligomerization (31Schlessinger J. Cell. 2000; 103: 211-225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3530) Google Scholar). Typically, activation requires autophosphorylation of tyrosine residues within the activation loop, resulting in an “open,” active conformation that allows access to ATP and peptide substrates. The A-loop of Tie2 is in a more “active-like” conformation that resembles that of the active, autophosphorylated insulin receptor kinase (12Shewchuk L.M. Hassell A.M. Ellis B. Holmes W.D. Davis R. Horne E.L. Kadwell S.H. McKee D.D. Moore J.T. Structure. 2000; 8: 1105-1113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Deletion of the C tail of Tie2 in vivo resulted in high basal levels of autophosphorylation that were enhanced further by ligand. This basal autophosphorylation could not be attributed to high receptor expression, since fTie2-WT cells with equal or greater levels of expression showed less basal phosphorylation. These findings suggest that an early step in Tie2 activation is a conformational change that displaces the C tail from its autoinhibitory position. Although it is not clear whether full activation of Tie2 requires phosphorylation of Tyr992 in the A-loop or a conformational change of the nucleotide binding loop, release of autoinhibition by the C tail would probably allow such changes to proceed more efficiently. This notion is supported by our in vitro results. In the kinase activity assay, a delay in the activation of both wild type and ΔCT was observed, after which activity of ΔCT increased significantly compared with that of wild type. In this experiment, the kinases were not subjected to an autophosphorylation reaction prior to the addition of substrate peptide, so it is possible that important tyrosine residues like Tyr992 had not yet been phosphorylated. Therefore, the delay in kinase activation might represent the requirement for A-loop tyrosine phosphorylation, and we predict that removal of the C tail would facilitate this process. Taken together, our results indicate that the Tie2 C tail provides an important level of negative regulation of Tie2 kinase activity. It has been suggested that hydrogen bonding of the hydroxyl group of Tyr1112 might maintain the C tail in its inhibitory conformation and that autophosphorylation of this residue would release the inhibition (12Shewchuk L.M. Hassell A.M. Ellis B. Holmes W.D. Davis R. Horne E.L. Kadwell S.H. McKee D.D. Moore J.T. Structure. 2000; 8: 1105-1113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 23Blume-Jensen P. Hunter T. Nature. 2001; 411: 355-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (3140) Google Scholar). Our studies partially support this hypothesis, since the ΔCT mutant lacks Tyr1112. However, it is impossible to determine from our studies whether phosphorylation of Tyr1112 would be sufficient to alter the conformation of the C tail. Importantly, the removal of Tyr1112 by the ΔCT mutation enhanced autophosphorylation, kinase activity, and downstream signaling by Tie2. In contrast, a Y1112F mutation decreases Tie2 autophosphorylation (13Huang L. Turck C.W. Rao P. Peters K.G. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 2097-2103PubMed Google Scholar) and kinase activity 2X.-L. Niu and C. D. Kontos, unpublished observations. in vitro. The different effects of these two mutations on receptor phosphorylation and activity suggest that the hydroxyl residue of Tyr1112 does not play a structural role in autoinhibition by the Tie2 C tail. However, like the FGFR2 mutations described above (28Lorenzi M.V. Castagnino P. Chen Q. Chedid M. Miki T. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 817-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), it is possible that Tyr1112 could play a negative regulatory role through specific signaling partners that bind this residue. For example, Tyr1112 was shown to be the site of association of the protein-tyrosine phosphatase Shp2 (13Huang L. Turck C.W. Rao P. Peters K.G. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 2097-2103PubMed Google Scholar), which has been shown to dephosphorylate and negatively regulate the platelet-derived growth factor β receptor (32Klinghoffer R.A. Kazlauskas A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22208-22217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Studies are currently under way to elucidate which residues are responsible for regulating autoinhibition by the Tie2 C tail. Recently, there has been great interest in understanding the mechanisms of action of Tie2 for therapeutic purposes. Disruption of Tie2 signaling with a soluble receptor protein results in significant inhibition of tumor angiogenesis, growth, and metastasis (5Lin P. Buxton J.A. Acheson A. Radziejewski C. Maisonpierre P. Yancopoulos G.D. Channon K.M. Hale L.P. Dewhirst M.W. George S.E. Peters K.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8829-8834Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar, 6Lin P.

Marme D. Martiny-Baron G. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 3185-3191PubMed Google Scholar). These studies indicate that Tie2 is a potentially important target for the prevention of tumor angiogenesis. As a result, small molecule inhibitors of Tie2 are actively being designed and tested for the treatment of cancer. By shedding light on the mechanisms of Tie2 activation, our results may aid in the development of such inhibitors, which could potentially be designed based on residues in the C tail that inhibit substrate peptide access. The current results may also provide insights into the mechanisms of vascular morphogenesis. Two different inherited Tie2 mutations have been identified and linked to vascular malformations (33Vikkula M. Boon L.M. Carraway K.L. Calvert J.T. Diamonti A.J. Goumnerov B. Pasyk K.A. Marchuk D.A.

Both of these mutations enhance Tie2 autophosphorylation, although their effects on Tie2 kinase activity have yet to be determined. In both cases, the mutations result in vascular dysmorphogenesis characterized by abnormal contacts between endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells or pericytes. One of these mutations, R897W, has been shown to enhance downstream activation of Stat1 (35Korpelainen E.I. Karkkainen M. Gunji Y. Vikkula M. Alitalo K. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Otherwise, little is known about the signaling pathways and downstream cellular responses that are affected by these Tie2 mutations. Our results with the ΔCT mutant suggest that hyperactivating mutations of Tie2 result in dysregulated, enhanced activation of its normal signaling pathways, such as PI 3-kinase/Akt, which enhances cell survival. In this manner, vascular malformations caused by the Tie2 mutations may behave like cancer (23Blume-Jensen P. Hunter T. Nature. 2001; 411: 355-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (3140) Google Scholar). Endothelial cells expressing mutant Tie2 receptors may be resistant to apoptosis despite damage that would normally lead to their clearance from the vasculature (e.g. during vascular remodeling following wounding). Further studies will be necessary to determine whether the activating Tie2 mutations result in aberrant signaling compared with wild type Tie2. Nonetheless, continued understanding of the mechanisms of Tie2 activation is likely to facilitate progress in the treatment of numerous vascular diseases.

ARF facilitates growth arrest through the p53 pathway by hindering the down-regulation of p53 activity mediated by MDM2, through the formation of a protein complex with MDM2. Here we have explored the possibility that human p14(ARF) activity is integrated with growth regulating pathways other than p53, and report our results that p14(ARF) can control the activity of the E2F transcription factor. p14(ARF) regulates E2F activity in different cell-types, including p53(-/-)/mdm(-/-) MEFs, thus excluding that the effects of p14(ARF) are indirectly caused through MDM2 modulation. p14(ARF) down-regulates E2F-dependent transcription, and in cells undergoing E2F-dependent apoptosis prompts cell cycle arrest. p14(ARF) possesses multiple binding domains for E2F-1, one of which resides within the N-terminal region and coincides with the regulation of E2F activity. A mutational analysis of p14(ARF) indicates that the E2F-1 and MDM2 binding domains can be distinguished. These results highlight the potential interplay between p14(ARF) and E2F, and establish p14(ARF) as a pleiotrophic regulator of cell growth that acts by targetting at least two key pathways in the control of proliferation, namely E2F and p53."

The activation of protein kinase C (PKC) with 12-O-tetradecaoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) also induced increases in junD expression similar to those of UV irradiation. In addition, UV irradiation- and TPA-induced increases injunD expression were completely abolished by GF-109203X, a PKC-specific inhibitor. UV irradiation activated intracellular signaling pathways including extracellular regulated kinase-2 (Erk-2), c-Jun N-terminal kinases-1 (JNK-1), and p38. However, TPA-induced activation of PKC affected only Erk-2 activity, and GF-109203X (a PKC inhibitor) markedly suppressed UV-induced Erk-2 activation. To further investigate the effect of UV-induced Erk-2 activation on the expression of junD mRNA, cDNA encoding mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK1) was overexpressed in ML-1 cells. The overexpression of MEK1 enhanced substantially junD expression in response to UV or TPA. In contrast, the suppression of Erk activation with PD98059, a specific inhibitor of MEK1, inhibited UV- and TPA-induced junD mRNA expression, UV-induced increases in caspase-3 activities, and cell death. In addition, the overexpression of junD enhanced the UV irradiation-induced increases in caspase-3 activity and cell death. We conclude that UV irradiation-induced increases in junD expression in ML-1 cells are mediated through activation of the PKC-coupled Erk-2 signaling pathway and play an important role in ML-1 cell apoptosis.

The exposure of mammalian cells to UV light elicits a rapid transcriptional activation of immediate-early genes such as c-jun and c-fos (1Devary Y. Gottlieb R.A. Lau L.F. Karin M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2804-2811Crossref PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar). New products of c-jun and c-fos genes form a multimer known as transcriptional factor AP-11(activator protein 1) (2Gentz R. Rauscher III, F.J. Abate C. Curran T. Science. 1989; 243: 1695-1699Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar, 3Smeal T. Angel P. Meek J. Karin M.

The activated AP-1 regulates expressions of its target genes including c-jun itself. The multimer of AP-1 is not only composed of c-Jun and c-Fos but also other members of the Jun and Fos family such as JunB (5Ryder K. Nathans D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8464-8467Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar), JunD (6Ryder K. Lanahan A. Perez-Albuerne E. Nathans D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

EMBO J. 1989; 8: 1433-1439Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar), and FosB. Similar to c-jun, the transcription of junB is activated when the cells are exposed to UV irradiation (8Dosch J. Kaina B. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 1927-1935PubMed Google Scholar). However, little is known about either the effects of UV irradiation on junD expression or the involvement of specific cell signaling pathways in mediating this response. Earlier studies suggest that the JunD protein shares some functional similarities with other members of the Jun family. First, this protein can form a heterodimeric complex with c-Fos and homodimeric complexes with other jun products (4Ryseck R.P. Bravo R. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 533-542PubMed Google Scholar, 6Ryder K.

Bravo R. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 533-542PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, some stimuli such as ionizing radiation, hypoxic-ischemic injury, okadaic acid, insulin-like growth factors, and alkylating mutagens can activate c-jun andjunB expressions as well as junD expression (8Dosch J. Kaina B. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 1927-1935PubMed Google Scholar, 9Wilson R.E. Taylor S.L. Atherton G.T. Johnston D. Waters C.M. Norton J.D. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 3229-3237PubMed Google Scholar, 10Haby C.

Tissue Int. 1994; 55: 311-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Our previous studies have demonstrated that the activation of protein kinase C (PKC) by TPA can induce junD expression (12Wang Y. Gong B. Dai W. Lu L. Gene. 1998; 216: 293-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). PKC isoforms have been divided into three categories on the basis of their structure and biochemical properties, including conventional PKC (cPKC), novel PKC (nPKC) and atypical PKC (aPKC). Recently, it has been shown that UV-induced cellular responses involve PKC activation (13Chen N., Ma, W. Huang C. Dong Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15389-15394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 14Huang C., Ma, W. Bowden G.T. Dong Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31262-31268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is important for us to examine whether UV irradiation can cause overexpression of junD. The activation of distinct cellular signaling pathways in many different cell types usually regulates gene expression through the activation of transcription factors. Recent studies have focused on identifying signaling molecules that are involved in UV irradiation-induced increases in transcription factor expressions. It has been shown in different cell types that UV irradiation activates three intracellular signaling cascades, e.g. extracellular regulated kinase (Erk), c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (15Price M.A. Cruzalegui F.H. Treisman R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6552-6563Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar, 16Denhardt D.T. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 729-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar, 17Adler V. Schaffer A. Kim J. Dolan L. Ronai Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26071-26077Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). JNK has been found to play a major role in transmitting signaling events from the cell membrane to the nucleus in a UV-induced rise in c-jun expression. JNK activation is much stronger than that of Erk or p38 in response to UV irradiation (16Denhardt D.T. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 729-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar, 18Canman C.E.

EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1005-1012Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). UV-induced activation of JNK results in an increase in c-jun gene expression and activation of the c-Jun protein (21Smeal T. Binetruy B. Mercola D.A. Birrer M. Karin M. Nature. 1991; 354: 494-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (699) Google Scholar, 22Smeal T. Binetruy B. Mercola D. Grover-Bardwick A. Heidecker G. Rapp U.R. Karin M.

Nature. 1991; 353: 670-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (1199) Google Scholar). Erk is also involved in UV-induced immediate-early gene activation because the UV-induced increase in c-jun expression can be inhibited by pretreatment of cells with PD98059, a specific inhibitor of the Erk signaling pathway (24Fritz G. Kaina B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1768-1774Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Thus, it is necessary to identify which signaling pathway(s) mediates UV irradiation-induced increases in junD expression. In the present study, we investigated the signaling pathway in myeloblastic ML-1 cells that mediates increases in junD mRNA expression in response to UV irradiation and TPA stimulation. Our results indicate that the PKC-coupled Erk-2 signaling pathway is responsible for the transmission of UV-induced signaling events resulting in a high level of expression of junD mRNA. Human myeloblastic leukemia ML-1 cells were cultured in conditions as described (12Wang Y. Gong B. Dai W. Lu L. Gene. 1998; 216: 293-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Briefly, ML-1 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium containing 7.5% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) in a humidified incubator supplied with 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Cells were passed at a seeding density of 3 × 105 cells/ml. Before treatment with UV irradiation or drugs, cells were synchronized by serum-deprivation in RPMI 1640 medium containing 0.3% fetal bovine serum for 36 h. They were then exposed to UVC light (40 μJ/cm2). After UV irradiation (5, 30, 60, and 180 min), the cells were collected and rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Total RNA was isolated, and immunoprecipitation/protein kinase assays were performed. In some experiments, the cells were treated with 1 nm 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) (Sigma) for 5, 30, 60, and 180 min. To determine the roles of PKC and MAPK in UV- and TPA-induced junD expression, either GF-109203X (1 μm) or PD98059 (25 μm) (Calbiochem) was added to the cell medium 20 min prior to UV or TPA treatment, respectively. RNAs from ML-1 cells were extracted with a guanidium thiocyanate procedure (12Wang Y. Gong B. Dai W. Lu L. Gene. 1998; 216: 293-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 25Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar). Briefly, 1 × 107 cells were collected for sample preparation at each time point. Following rinsing with ice-cold PBS, the cells were immediately lysed with 1 ml of guanidium solution (5m guanidium thiocyanate, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 0.5% N-lauroylsarcosine, and 100 mmβ-mercaptoethanol). The lysates were extracted three times with phenol/chloroform (50:50). Finally, RNAs were precipitated by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 20 min after pre-incubating with ethanol at −80 °C. Samples of RNAs (20 μg each) were loaded in agarose gel (1%) denatured with 2.2 m formaldehyde. The fractionated RNA was transferred onto a nylon membrane that was subsequently hybridized with a α-32P-labeledjunD cDNA probe using a random primer labeling kit (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA). Cellular Erk-2, JNK-1, and p38 were immunoprecipitated as described (26Xu D. Wang L. Dai W. Lu L. Blood. 1999; 94: 139-145Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, ML-1 cells (1 × 107 cells treated at 5 × 105 cell/ml) were washed once with ice-cold PBS and lysed in 1 ml of lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 137 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EDTA, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 25 mm β-glycerophosphate, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 mg/ml leupeptin). Cell lysates were maintained on ice for 10 min and then centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 20 min. Erk-2, JNK-1, and p38 proteins were precipitated with rabbit polyclonal antibodies against Erk-2 (1:100), JNK-1 (1:100), and p38 (1:100), respectively. Antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Immunocomplexes were adsorbed on protein A-Sepharose beads (Sigma). Immunocomplexes were washed twice with a kinase buffer (20 mm MgCl2, 25 mm β-glycerophosphate, 100 mm sodium orthovanadate, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 20 mmHEPES, pH 7.6) and then resuspended in 100 μl of the kinase buffer. GST-ATF-2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was used as a substrate in kinase activity assay for JNK-1 and p38, and GST-MBP (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was used as a substrate in the Erk-2 kinase activity assay. The kinase reaction was initiated by adding 2 μl of an ATP mixture containing 20 μm ATP and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Biosciences). The reaction was performed at room temperature for 5 min and terminated by adding 30 μl of 2× Laemmli buffer. Phosphorylations of ATF-2 and MBP were resolved on PAGE gels and visualized by autoradiography. Protein levels of JNK-1, Erk-2, and p38 were determined by Western blotting. Briefly, an equal volume of 2× Laemmli buffer was added to 30 μl of the immunocomplex. After fractionation of proteins on a 12% PAGE gel, the proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membrane was then incubated with the same antibodies as used for immunoprecipitation with dilutions of 1:2000 for JNK-1, 1:5000 for Erk-2, and 1:2000 for p38. Following incubations with goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G (IgG) conjugated with alkaline phosphatase (1:1000) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), the protein bands were visualized with a Phototope-Star Western blot detection kit (New England Biolabs). To establish a model for exogenous transient gene expression in ML-1 cells, pEGFP (CLONTECH) and β-galactosidase control vectors (CLONTECH) were employed as reporter genes. Both genes were introduced into ML-1 cells by electroporation as described below. ML-1 cells were washed twice with cold PBS and resuspended in 0.8 ml of cold PBS at 107 cells/ml. For each transfection, DNA samples (10 μg per sample) were added into 0.8 ml of cell suspension. This mixture was shocked in a 0.4-cm gap cuvette at 300 V. Reporter gene expressions were detected every 24 h following electroporation. The expression of green fluorescent protein (GFP) was directly observed under a fluorescence microscope. The expression of β-galactosidase was determined with a detection assay kit (CLONTECH). Briefly, transfected ML-1 cells were lysed at 24, 48, and 72 h post-electroporation by repeated freezing and thawing 3 times. Cell lysates were centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. To determine β-galactosidase activity, samples (30 μl of the supernatant of each) were added into a white opaque 96-well plate with a flat bottom. Each well contained 200 μl of the reaction buffer mixture (4 μl of reaction substrate, 196 μl of reaction buffer). After incubation at room temperature for 1 h, the plate was directly exposed onto x-ray film for 15–30 min, and then all reaction mixtures were transferred into 0.5-ml tubes, and chemiluminescence intensity was determined in a scintillation counter. After characterizing optimal conditions for the electroporation of ML-1 cells, three exogenous genes, full-length human MEK1 (FL-MEK1-EE, in pcDNA III), constitutively activated JNKK1 kinase domain (▿JNKK1-KD, in pcDNA III) and junD (in pcDNA III), were introduced into ML-1 cells by electroporation. Cell death was analyzed by evaluating trypan blue exclusion. The cells were exposed to trypan blue (0.2% final concentration in PBS), and the percentage of trypan blue-positive dead cells was determined in fields of at least 200 cells. Caspase-3 activity in ML-1 cells was determined using a colorimetric CaspACETM Assay system (Promega, Madison, WI). ML-1 cells (107) were washed twice with cold PBS and lysed in 100 μl of lysis buffer by three cycles of freeze thawing. Following centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, 50-μl lysates were added into a 96-well plate containing a reaction mix to measure caspase-3 activity. After incubation for 4 h at 37 °C, A405of each sample was measured with a microplate reader (Molecular Devices Corporation, Sunnyvale, CA). Based on a standard curve obtained with p-nitroaniline standards,p-nitroaniline produced in the reaction was calculated as specific caspase activity. Activities are expressed as pmol/106 cell. For Northern and Western analysis, autoradiograph films were scanned, and relative densities of each signal band were analyzed using an NIH Image program. The results are reported as mean ± S.E., and statistical significance was determined with the paired Student’s t test atp < 0.05 or by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA; F < 0.05). We first determined whether UV irradiation affected junD mRNA expression in ML-1 cells following serum deprivation for 36 h, which synchronized the cell cycle at the G1 phase. This was done because previous studies revealed that junD expression level was very low under this condition (12Wang Y. Gong B. Dai W. Lu L. Gene. 1998; 216: 293-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Using Northern analysis,junD expression was detected at 5, 30, 60, and 180 min after UV exposure. UV irradiation markedly increased junD mRNA expression compared with that in the control cells (Fig.1). Upon application of TPA (1 nm), a strong activator of cPKC and nPKC,junD expression significantly increased at 5 min (data not shown) and was continuously maintained at a high level for up to 180 min (Fig. 2A). The pattern of the time-dependent stimulation by TPA of junD expression was very similar to that induced by UV irradiation. This similarity suggests that UV-induced rise in junD expression may require activation of a PKC-linked signaling pathway. To make this determination, the effect of UV on junD expression was measured during exposure to GF-109203X, a selective inhibitor of cPKC. In both cases, UV- and TPA-induced junD expressions fell close to the basal level in cells pre-incubated with 1 μmGF-109203X (Fig. 2, B and C), indicating that PKC activation is a component of the signaling pathway mediating UV- and TPA-induced increases in junD expression. To further characterize downstream events involved in a UV-induced rise in junD expression, JNK, Erk, and p38 kinase activities were measured in response to UV-irradiation. We found that all three limbs of the MAP kinase cascade were activated by UV irradiation. JNK-1, ERK-2, and p38 Kinase activities quickly increased within 5 min after UV irradiation. However, the time courses of activation were variable. JNK-1 and p38 reached peak levels at 30 min followed by declines lasting from 1 to 3 h (Fig.3, A and B). However, UV increased Erk-2 activity to a high level that remained stable during the entire observation period (Fig. 3C). It should be noted that the time courses for UV-induced Erk-2 activation and increases in junD expression are very similar to one another (Fig. 1). Previous studies showed that PKC activation by TPA stimulates JNK, Erk, and p38 signaling pathways. Unlike UV irradiation, TPA induces in some cell types a much stronger activation of Erk kinase than that of JNK or p38 (13Chen N., Ma, W. Huang C. Dong Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15389-15394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). To determine whether a specific MAP kinase pathway mediates UV-induced junD expression, the difference was determined between TPA- and UV-induced MAP kinase activations. When ML-1 cells were treated with 1 nm TPA, Erk-2 activity dramatically increased throughout the entire observation period (Fig.4A) with a pattern very similar to that induced by UV (Fig. 3C). However, TPA had a much weaker activation effect on both JNK-1 and p38 (Fig. 4,B and C). These results strongly suggest that the MAPK signaling pathway containing Erk-2 kinase is possibly a mediator of UV-induced increases in junD expression situated downstream from PKC stimulation. To confirm that Erk-2 is a downstream mediator of PKC in the UV-induced signaling pathway, we next determined whether inhibition of PKC activation by GF-109203X affected UV stimulation of Erk-2, JNK, and p38 activities. ML-1 cells were pretreated with 1 μm GF-109203X for 20 min prior to UV irradiation. As shown in Fig.5A, the inhibition of PKC activity by GF-109203X completely suppressed UV-induced Erk-2 activation. GF-109203X had a similar inhibitory effect on TPA-induced Erk-2 activation (Fig. 5B). However, UV-induced JNK-1 and p38 activation were unaffected by the inhibition of PKC activity by GF-109203X (Fig. 5, C and D). These results further indicate that PKC (possibly cPKC) plays an important role in mediating UV-induced Erk activation in ML-1 cells. In the Erk signaling pathway, Erk is directly activated by MAPK kinase (MEK1), whereas MEK1 is activated further upstream by Raf-1. Upstream activators of Raf-1 in this pathway include Ras-1 and PKC. To further determine the involvement of the Erk signaling pathway in UV-induced junD expression, PD98059 (25 μm), a selective inhibitor of MEK1 activation, was applied to ML-1 cells for 20 min prior to UV or TPA exposure. The inhibition of MEK1 activity decreased both UV- and TPA-induced Erk-2 activation to the control level (Fig. 6,A and B). However, a blockade of MEK1 activation had no effect on the UV-induced rise in JNK-1 and p38 activities (Fig.6, C and D). These results are fairly consistent with previous data showing that the inhibition of PKC activity by GF-109203 did not affect JNK-1 and p38 activities. In addition, the inhibition of MEK1 activity by PD98059 completely suppressed UV- and TPA-induced junD expression (Fig. 6, E andF). These results provide additional support for the hypothesis that Erk-2 activation is a signaling event situated downstream from PKC stimulation in the signaling pathway that mediates the UV-induced rise in junD expression. To confirm the role of the Erk signaling pathway in UV-induced increases in junD expression, an exogenous MEK1 gene was inserted and overexpressed in ML-1 cells. First, a β-galactosidase control vector was transfected into ML-1 cells by electroporation to determine the expression efficiency. Galactosidase activity in transfected ML-1 cells was significantly increased compared with control cells, indicating that the transfection method was appropriate for these cells (Fig.7A). Thus, a full-length MEK1 sequence contained in the pcDNA III (FL-MEK1-EE) vector was inserted with electroporation. Following transfection, basic Erk-2 activity was obviously elevated relative to that in non-transfected cells, and the baseline expression of junD was also significantly increased (Fig. 7, B and C). Moreover, UV-induced increases in Erk-2 activity and junD expression in MEK1-transfected cells were significantly larger than in non-transfected cells (Fig. 7, B and C). However, MEK1 overexpression did not affect JNK-1 activity (Fig. 7D) and p38 activity (data not shown). In comparison, the transfection of a constitutive positive JNKK1 gene (▿JNKK1-KD, constructed in pcDNA III) into ML-1 cells resulted in the overexpression of JNKK1 directly upstream from JNK but had no significant effect onjunD expression, although it increased the baseline activity of JNK-1 (Fig. 7, D and E). All of these results consistently showed that the overexpression of MEK1 selectively enhanced Erk-2 activity and junD expression. The results provide further evidence in ML-1 cells that the Erk signaling pathway is a downstream mediator of PKC activation in UV-inducedjunD expression. The effect of the suppression of Erk activation on UV irradiation-induced cell death was studied by treating the cells with a MEK1 inhibitor. PD98059 (25 μm) was added 20 min prior to UV irradiation. Cell viability was determined 8 h after UV irradiation using trypan blue exclusion to evaluate the rate of cell death. The inhibition of Erk activation markedly reduced cell death induced by UV irradiation (Fig. 8, A). In addition, cellular apoptotic response was evaluated based on measurements of caspase-3 activity. A time course of UV irradiation-induced caspase-3 activation is shown in Fig. 8B. The apoptotic response to UV irradiation in the presence and absence of Erk inhibition was determined 6 h after UV irradiation. UV-induced increases in caspase-3 activity were significantly decreased when cells were pretreated with the MEK inhibitor (Fig. 8C). The functional role of junD on UV irradiation-induced cell death was observed by the overexpression of full-length cDNA encoding JunD. CMV-junD was inserted into ML-1 cells by electroporation, and the empty CMV vector was also transfected into ML-1 cells as a control. After culturing for 48 h, transfected cells were exposed to UV irradiation. The UV-induced death rate of junD transfected cells was markedly increased, and UV-induced caspase-3 activity was also significantly increased in junD transfected cells compared with empty vector transfected cells (Fig. 8,D and E). Results obtained from these experiments were consistent with the expression pattern of junD induced by UV irradiation, suggesting that Erk activation-linked increases injunD expression play an important role in UV irradiation-induced ML-1 cell apoptosis. In the present study, we demonstrated that the exposure of ML-1 cells to UV irradiation significantly increased junD mRNA expression. The pattern of this increase is similar to the increases in junD expression resulting from PKC activation by TPA. Both UV- and TPA-induced junD expression can be blocked by the pretreatment of cells with a PKC inhibitor, GF-109203X. These results indicate that certain membrane-linked PKC isozymes are components of UV- and stress-induced signaling pathways. PKC isoforms are divided into cPKC (including PKCα, PKCβI, PKCβII, and PKCγ), nPKC (including PKCδ, PKCη, PKCθ, and PKCε), and aPKC (including PKCζ and PKCι/λ). Recent studies have shown that PKC is involved in UV-induced cellular responses. For example, UV irradiation can cause the translocation of some PKC subtypes (PKCε and PKCδ) to the cell membrane, which is required for UV-induced activation of Erk and JNK (13Chen N., Ma, W. Huang C. Dong Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15389-15394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). In addition, UV-induced AP-1 activation can be blocked by the expression of a dominant negative mutant PKCι/λ (14Huang C., Ma, W. Bowden G.T. Dong Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31262-31268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Although the present study did not identify which PKC isoform(s) must be activated for UV exposure to induce activation ofjunD expression, both cPKC and nPKC (especially cPKC) seem to play an essential role in this event. First, the UV-inducedjunD expression pattern was similar to that in TPA-stimulated cells (Figs. 1 and 2A) (27Zhuang S. Hirai S. Mizuno K. Suzuki A. Akimoto K. Izumi Y. Yamashita A. Ohno S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 240: 273-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 28Zhuang S. Hirai S.I. Ohno S. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: C102-C109Crossref Google Scholar). Second, pretreatment with GF-109203X selectively blocked cPKC activity and completely prevented UV-induced junD expression (Fig.2C) (29Toullec D. Pianetti P. Coste H. Bellevergue P. Grand-Perret T. Ajakane M. Baudet V. Boissin P. Boursier E. Loriolle F. Duhamel L. Charon D. Kirilovsky J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15771-15781Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, UV-induced Erk-2 activation was also blocked by the PKC inhibitor GF-109203X (Fig. 5A). In addition, the hypothesis is supported by a recent report that demonstrates that cPKC and nPKC activation are involved in mediating a cellular response to hyperosmotic stress (28Zhuang S. Hirai S.I. Ohno S. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: C102-C109Crossref Google Scholar). However, further investigation is necessary to identify which PKC isoforms are involved in UV-induced junD expression. Previous studies of c-jun gene expression suggest that UV irradiation can strongly activate the JNK signaling pathway resulting in increases in c-jun expression (17Adler V. Schaffer A. Kim J. Dolan L. Ronai Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26071-26077Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 30Stein B. Angel P. van Dam H. Ponta H. Herrlich P. van der Eb A. Rahmsdorf H.J. Photochem. Photobiol. 1992; 55: 409-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). JNK activation contributes in turn to both c-jun transcriptional activation and protein phosphorylation (28Zhuang S. Hirai S.I. Ohno S. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: C102-C109Crossref Google Scholar, 31Sluss H.K. Barrett T. Derijard B. Davis R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 8376-8384Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar, 32Wilhelm D. van Dam H. Herr I. Baumann B. Herrlich P. Angel P. Immunobiology. 1995; 193: 143-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Indeed, JNK, Erk, and p38 signaling pathways were activated by UV irradiation in ML-1 cells. However, our results indicate that JNK and p38 may not play roles in events downstream from PKC to mediate UV-induced activation ofjunD expression. In fact, the time course of UV-induced Erk activation matches the time course of UV-induced junD expression (Figs. 1 and 3C). On the other hand, even though a PKC inhibitor, GF-109203X, nearly completely blocked Erk activation induced by UV irradiation and TPA as well as junD expression, it had no inhibitory effect on UV-induced increases in JNK and p38 activity. Our evidence to support the hypothesis that Erk is the downstream mediator of PKC activation includes the following facts. 1) Down-regulation of PKC with GF-109203X selectively blocked Erk activation in response to UV and TPA stimulation. 2) Selective inhibition of the Erk signaling pathway by PD98059, a selective inhibitor of MEK (a MAPK kinase immediate upstream of Erk), suppressed Erk-2 activity to the basal level and prevented UV- and TPA-induced increases in junD expression (Fig. 6). 3) The overexpression of the exogenous MEK1 gene in ML-1 cells increased Erk activity and enhanced junD expression in both control and UV- and TPA-induced cells (Fig. 7). In addition, the inhibition of Erk activation by PD98059 effectively suppressed UV irradiation-induced caspase-3 activity and ML-1 cell death (Fig. 8). These results consistently demonstrate that the Erk signaling pathway is located downstream from PKC and plays an important role in mediating UV-inducedjunD expression in ML-1 cells. Our conclusion is consistent with recent studies showing the involvement of the Erk signaling pathway in c-junactivation. In NIH 3T3 cells the application of wortmannin, an inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, blocks UV-induced JNK activation without affecting UV-induced increases in c-junexpression (24Fritz G. Kaina B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1768-1774Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The inhibition of the Erk signaling pathway with PD98059 suppresses UV-induced increases in c-jun mRNA level and c-Jun protein expression (24Fritz G. Kaina B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1768-1774Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The overexpression of wild type Erk-2 causes 46–140-fold increases in UV-induced AP-1 activity. Conversely, the introduction of a dominant negative Erk-2 into cells suppressed both UV-induced Erk and AP-1 activation (14Huang C., Ma, W. Bowden G.T. Dong Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31262-31268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). A remaining question is how does PKC stimulation by UV result in Erk activation. The pathway that leads to Erk activation can be triggered by a variety of stimuli (including UV irradiation). It is known that membrane activation of Ras and PKC during UV exposure occurs earlier than Erk stimulation. Therefore, it is possible that UV irradiation induces Erk activation by either stimulating Ras or PKC or both. Our data imply that, in ML-1 cells, PKC activation instead of the Ras pathway may be an essential mediator in the transmission of UV stimulation to Erk because Erk activation by UV irradiation was completely abolished when PKC activity was inhibited by GF-109203X (Fig. 5A). This conclusion is consistent with other studies (27Zhuang S. Hirai S. Mizuno K. Suzuki A. Akimoto K. Izumi Y. Yamashita A. Ohno S. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

As a member of the Jun protein family, JunD shows functional similarity to c-Jun (4Ryseck R.P. Bravo R. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 533-542PubMed Google Scholar, 6Ryder K. Lanahan A. Perez-Albuerne E.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1695-1709Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). The expression of the dominant negative mutant of c-Jun or the inhibition of c-Jun function by specific antibodies can protect neuronal cells from apoptosis induced by growth factor withdrawal (36Ham J.

Bravo R. Johnson E.M., Jr. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1717-1727Crossref PubMed Scopus (786) Google Scholar). It is also known that UV irradiation induces c-jun activation and results in cell apoptosis (13Chen N., Ma, W. Huang C. Dong Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15389-15394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 14Huang C., Ma, W. Bowden G.T. Dong Z. J. Biol.

Interestingly, we did not find that either UV irradiation or TPA stimulation could activate c-junexpression in ML-1 cells (data not shown). We speculate that increases in junD expression of ML-1 cells may play a compensatory role in eliciting UV-induced apoptosis despite c-jundeficiency, although the effect of UV-induced junD expression on cellular function was not determined here. Nevertheless, this question warrants future investigation. We found that the overexpression of junD enhances UV-induced increases in caspase-3 activity and cell death (Fig. 8). This result indicates a functional role of increased junD expression in response to UV irradiation. In conclusion, our results indicate that, in ML-1 cells, UV irradiation-induced activation of junD expression and its activation are mediated by a PKC-coupled Erk signaling pathway. The sequential responses to UV irradiation result in ML-1 cell death. These findings also extend our knowledge about the cellular signaling mechanisms that mediate UV-induced increases in immediate early gene expression."

We and others have observed that inflammatory cytokines and infiltrates are present in the lung tissue, but the significance is uncertain.

These results are the first to illustrate the anti-cytokine actions of TRE in down-regulating NFκB, not through its inhibitory component or by direct binding but by blocking nuclear translocation.

These observations suggest that inflammatory cytokines may participate in the pathogenesis of PPH. Recent studies have demonstrated the therapeutic efficacy of prostacyclin for PPH (10Barst R.J.

Prostaglandins comprise a family of lipid compounds derived from arachidonic acid. In 1976, Moncadaet al. (32Moncada S. Gryglewski R. Bunting S. Vane J. Nature. 1976; 263: 663-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (2933) Google Scholar) discovered prostaglandin I2and named it prostacyclin (reviewed in Ref. 14Galie L. Eur. Heart J. 1996; 17: 18-24PubMed Google Scholar). The potent vasodilator activity and capacity for inhibition of platelet aggregation provide the rationale for prostacyclin therapy in PPH. Indeed, continuous intravenous infusion of prostacyclin improves hemodynamics, exercise tolerance, and survival in PPH patients (10Barst R.J. Rubin L.J. Long W.A. McGoon M.D. Rich S. Badesch D.B.

Other properties of prostacyclin may also be important in therapeutic efficacy as suggested by the fact that patients who do not have acute hemodynamic improvement still appear to benefit from chronic therapy (14Galie L. Eur. Heart J. 1996; 17: 18-24PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, several studies have demonstrated the inhibitory effects of prostacyclin on cytokine production by blood mononuclear cells (15Luttmann W. Herzog V. Matthys H. Thierauch K.H. Virchow J. Kroegel C. Cytokine. 1999; 11: 127-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 16Luttmann W. Herzog V. Virchow J.C. Matthys H. Thierauch K.H. Kroegel C. Pulm.

Immunopharmacology. 1993; 26: 259-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). However, the effect of such drugs on alveolar macrophages, one of the major sources of cytokines in the lung, is unknown. Treprostinil (TRE) is a more stable benzidine derivative of prostacyclin and has shown success in treating PPH (19Simonneau G. Barst R.J. Galie N. Naeije R. Rich S. Bourge R.C. Keogh A. Oudiz R. Frost A. Blackburn S.D. Crow J.W. Rubin L.J. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 2002; 165: 800-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (1240) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that in addition to its direct hemodynamic effects, TRE might also decrease cytokine production and exert anti-inflammatory effect in the lung. To test this hypothesis, we investigated the effect of TRE on inflammatory cytokine secretion and gene expression in human alveolar macrophages. Salmonella typhimuriumlipopolysaccharide (LPS) was obtained from Sigma and used at 0.5 μg/ml for all experiments. TRE was a gift of the United Therapeutic Corporation (Research Triangle Park, NC). Fiberoptic bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage was performed as described previously (8Raychaudhuri B. Dweik R.A. Connors M. Buhrow L. Malur A. Drazba J. Arroliga A.C. Erzurum S.C. Kavuru M. Thomassen M.J. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1999; 21: 311-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The study population consisted of healthy volunteers 18–65 years of age with no lung disease and on no medication. All of the volunteers provided written informed consent, and the study was approved by the institutional review board of the Cleveland Clinic Foundation. Alveolar macrophages were obtained by adhering cells from bronchoalveolar lavage as described previously (8Raychaudhuri B. Dweik R.A. Connors M. Buhrow L. Malur A. Drazba J. Arroliga A.C. Erzurum S.C. Kavuru M. Thomassen M.J. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1999; 21: 311-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 20Thomassen M.J. Boxerbaum B. Demko C.A. Kuchenbrod P.J. Dearborn D.G. Wood R.E. Pediatr. Res. 1979; 13: 1085-1088Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Nonadherent cells were removed by washing. The adherent cell population consisted of greater than 99% macrophages. Alveolar macrophages were cultured overnight prior toin vitro treatment. After overnight incubation, macrophages were treated with LPS ± TRE (2–200 ng/ml) or left untreated for 4 h. TRE did not adversely affect cell viability at any dose tested as measured by trypan blue dye exclusion and cell adherence. Cells were harvested, and WCEs were prepared as described previously (8Raychaudhuri B. Dweik R.A. Connors M. Buhrow L. Malur A. Drazba J. Arroliga A.C. Erzurum S.C. Kavuru M. Thomassen M.J. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1999; 21: 311-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). In one group of experiments, TRE or vehicle was added directly to WCE from untreated or LPS-treated cells for 15 min. The protein content of WCEs was measured by BCA protein assay method (Pierce, Rockford, IL). For electrophoretic mobility shift assay, 10 μg of the WCE were incubated in binding buffer (8 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 10% glycerol, 20 mm KCl, 4 mm MgCl2, 1 mm sodium pyrophosphate) containing 1 μg of poly(dI·dC) and 40,000-cpm probe for 20 min at room temperature as described previously (8Raychaudhuri B. Dweik R.A. Connors M. Buhrow L. Malur A. Drazba J. Arroliga A.C. Erzurum S.C. Kavuru M. Thomassen M.J. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1999; 21: 311-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Supershifts were performed with anti-p65 and anti-p50 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) added prior to the addition of the probe. The specificity of the probe was shown by incubating the extract with a 1000-fold molar excess of cold oligonucleotide. StormImager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA) and ImageQuant software were used for quantification of autoradiographs. The sequence of the NFκB binding sites was 5′-AACTCCGGGAATTTCCCTGGCCC-3′. Treated cells were washed once with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed as described previously (8Raychaudhuri B. Dweik R.A. Connors M. Buhrow L. Malur A. Drazba J. Arroliga A.C. Erzurum S.C. Kavuru M. Thomassen M.J. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1999; 21: 311-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were measured by BCA assay, and 10 μg of the cell lysate were mixed with 1:1 sample buffer, boiled, and analyzed on a 10% sodium dodecylsulfate-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to Immobilon-P membranes. After blocking membranes, the primary antibody to IκBα (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or phospho-IκBα (Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA) was applied at 1:1000 dilution for 1 h at room temperature. After secondary antibody application and washing, bands were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (AmershamBiosciences). Alveolar macrophages were cultured in chamber slides overnight prior to treatment with LPS ± TRE (200 ng/ml) for 0.5–4 h and then stained for p65 as described previously (21Raychaudhuri B. Fisher C.J. Farver C.F. Malur A. Drazba J. Kavuru M.S. Thomassen M.J. Cytokine. 2000; 12: 1348-1355Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The cells were washed gently with 37 °C phosphate-buffered saline and then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min prior to permeabilization with 1% Triton-100. After a blocking step, slides were incubated with primary antibody (Rabbit anti-human p 65, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) (1:1000) overnight at 4 °C. After further washing, slides were exposed to secondary antibody for 45 min. Simultaneous two-color fluorescence images were collected on a Leica TCS-SP laser-scanning confocal microscope. Nuclear p65 was then quantified by the BIOQUANT True Color Windows 95 system, version 2.0 (R & M Biometrics, Inc., Nashville, TN) as described previously (21Raychaudhuri B. Fisher C.J. Farver C.F. Malur A. Drazba J. Kavuru M.S. Thomassen M.J. Cytokine. 2000; 12: 1348-1355Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Cytokine products (TNF-α, IL-6, GM-CSF, IL-1β) were analyzed in duplicate samples of cell-free supernatant fluids from 24-h macrophage cultures by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Endogen, Cambridge, MA). Assay sensitivity ranged from 25–1000 pg/ml, and assay coefficient of variation was <10%. Alveolar macrophage RNA was prepared by RNeasy protocol (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). RNase protection assay was performed using a PharMingen kit (BD PharMingen) including a custom-made probe containing IL-10, GM-CSF, IL-6, macrophage inflammatory protein-1α, vascular endothelial growth factor, and two housekeeping genes L32 and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. Quantification of the radioactivity was done using a StormImager and calculated using ImageQuant analysis. Data were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) using Prism software (GraphPad, Inc., San Diego, CA). Significance was defined as p = 0.05. The means ± S.E. are provided. The effect of TRE (2–400 ng/ml) on LPS-stimulated production of IL-6 was evaluated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Fig. 1A). Treatment with LPS alone increased cytokine production, whereas the presence of TRE significantly inhibited LPS-mediated increases in a dose-dependent manner (p = 0.0017). To determine whether this result was cytokine-specific, the effect of TRE (200 ng/ml) on TNF, IL-1, and GM-CSF was tested. All of the three cytokines were inhibited by TRE (Fig. 1B). Treatment with LPS also increased alveolar macrophage mRNA expression of TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, and GM-CSF in a time-dependent fashion (Fig.2A) when compared with unstimulated cells with a peak for TNF at 8 and 24 h for the other cytokines. Simultaneous treatment with TRE (200 ng/ml) inhibited LPS-induced mRNA expression of all four cytokines. Fig.2B shows the quantification of the same gel by ImageQuant analysis. Because NFκB is a ubiquitous transcription factor involved in the regulation of all four cytokines studied as well as many others, we next determined the effect of TRE on LPS-induced NFκB activation (Fig. 3). LPS treatment increased NFκB activation when compared with unstimulated cells (Fig. 3A). Simultaneous treatment with TRE reduced the formation of the NFκB·DNA complex, suggesting that TRE inhibited NFκB activation. Specificity was confirmed by supershift with p65 and p50 antibodies and competition with cold oligonucleotide. These data were quantified (Fig. 3B by ImageQuant analysis). The possibility that the antagonistic effect of TRE on LPS-induced NFκB was directed against IκBα was next examined (Fig.4). Fig. 4A shows a rapid (within 45 min) disappearance of IκBα upon LPS treatment with or without TRE. Similarly, the phosphorylation of IκBα occurred after LPS treatment in the presence or absence of TRE (Fig. 4B). Data suggest that TRE is not targeting IκBα phosphorylation or degradation. Because TRE had no apparent effect on IκB-α, we investigated whether TRE altered the nuclear translocation of the p65·p50 complex or whether it directly blocked DNA binding. To assess the former mechanism, we employed immunocytochemistry to visualize p65 at different time intervals (30 min, 1, 2, 3, and 4 h) after LPS treatment (Fig.5, 30-min time point). From 30 min to 4 h after LPS treatment, nuclear staining of p65 was prominent. Simultaneous treatment with TRE prevented p65 nuclear translocation as shown by the reduced numbers of intensely stained nuclei. Image quantification confirmed the reduction of p65 translocation (Fig.5E). To assess the second mechanism, we exposed whole cell extracts from LPS-treated cells to TRE (200 ng/ml) in vitro. TRE failed to block NFκB activation as determined by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (data not shown). These results strongly suggest that TRE blocks NFκB activation by impeding nuclear translocation of p65 but not by inhibiting cognate binding. The potent vasodilator activity and capacity for inhibition of platelet aggregation provide the rationale for prostacyclin use in PPH. Other properties of prostacyclin may also be important in therapeutic efficacy as suggested by the fact that patients who do not have acute hemodynamic improvement still appear to benefit from chronic therapy (14Galie L. Eur. Heart J. 1996; 17: 18-24PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, the association of PPH with inflammatory cytokines has been well documented (4Humbert M. Monti G. Brenot F. Sitbon O. Portier A.

Based on these observations, we hypothesized that prostacyclins might effect inflammatory cytokine production. The current findings show for the first time that the prostacyclin analogue TRE effectively reduces human alveolar macrophage inflammatory cytokine secretion by inhibiting NFκB activation and subsequent transcription of cytokine genes. Furthermore, our data show that the inhibition of NFκB activation by TRE is by blockade of p65 nuclear translocation. The molecular regulation of inflammatory cytokine genes is a complex process in which NFκB constitutes a critical element (22Baldwin A.S., Jr. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (5575) Google Scholar, 23Baeuerle P.A. Henkel T. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 141-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (4598) Google Scholar). In quiescent cells, NFκB is located in the cytosol as a heterodimer or homodimer of protein components bound to an inhibitor IκB. The activation of this transcription factor is controlled by sequential phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and proteasome-mediated degradation of IκB, resulting in the migration of the NFκB complex to the nucleus and binding to the promoter region of many cytokine and growth factor genes (23Baeuerle P.A. Henkel T. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 141-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (4598) Google Scholar, 24Thanos D. Maniatis T. Cell. 1995; 80: 529-532Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1217) Google Scholar). Most known inhibitors of NFκB activation such as glucocorticosteroids, aspirin, and nitric oxide have been shown to block NFκB activation by interfering with IκB degradation and/or stimulating IκB synthesis (8Raychaudhuri B. Dweik R.A. Connors M. Buhrow L. Malur A. Drazba J. Arroliga A.C. Erzurum S.C. Kavuru M. Thomassen M.J. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol.

TRE prevents NFκB activation without affecting IκB-α degradation by interfering with nuclear translocation of the p65·p60 complex. Other reagents, for example, such as caffeic acid phenethyl ester are known to target nuclear translocation of p65 as a mechanism for anti-NFκB activity (28Natarjan K. Singh S. Burke T.R. Grunberger D. Aggarwal B.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9090-9095Crossref PubMed Scopus (1036) Google Scholar). Several reports have demonstrated that prostacyclin inhibits cytokine secretion from human peripheral blood mononuclear cells and the human monocytic cell lines THP-1 and Mono Mac 6 (15–18;29). Both Luttmann et al. (16Luttmann W. Herzog V. Virchow J.C. Matthys H. Thierauch K.H. Kroegel C. Pulm. Pharmacol. 1996; 9: 43-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) and Crutchley et al. (29Crutchley D.J. Conanan L.B. Que B.G. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1994; 271: 446-451PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrated that prostacyclin inhibited gene expression, but whether NFκB is involved was not explored. Surprisingly, the prostacyclin analogue iloprost blocked IκB-α degradation in the murine monocyte/macrophage cell line J774 (30D'Acquisto F. Sautebin L. Iuvone T., Di Rosa M. Carnuccio R. FEBS Lett. 1998; 440: 76-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Whether this difference is because of the fact that the human alveolar macrophages are primary cells and/or whether there are species-specific differences remains to be investigated. Furthermore, because cytokines promote smooth muscle cell proliferation, the recent study demonstrating that TRE inhibits proliferation of human pulmonary artery cells in vitro may be attributed to anti-cytokine effects (31Clapp L.H. Finney P. Turcato S. Tran S. Rubin L.J. Tinker A. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2002; 26: 194-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the actions of TRE make it an effective cytokine inhibitor, and this effect is mediated at least in part by blocking NFκB activation, although other mechanism(s) may also be involved in cytokine regulation by TRE. The data presented here show that TRE blocks NFκB translocation, thereby potentially inhibiting inflammatory cytokine production. The association of PPH with inflammatory cytokine production has been well documented (4Humbert M. Monti G. Brenot F. Sitbon O. Portier A. Grangeot-Keros L. Duroux P. Galanaud P. Simonneau G.

Moreover, our previous studies indicate that PPH alveolar macrophages are endogenously activated as illustrated by activated NFκB (8Raychaudhuri B. Dweik R.A. Connors M. Buhrow L. Malur A. Drazba J. Arroliga A.C. Erzurum S.C. Kavuru M. Thomassen M.J. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1999; 21: 311-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is intriguing to speculate that some of the clinical efficacy shown by TRE in PPH may be attributed to down-regulation of inflammatory cytokine production. We thank Dr. Barbara Barna for helpful suggestions and review of this paper."
https://openalex.org/W1975737390,"Overexpression of c-Myc in tumors is usually associated with cell proliferation and increased susceptibility to apoptosis. Concomitantly, c-Myc contributes to tumorigenesis by its ability to destabilize the cellular genome. Here, we examined whether c-Myc induces genomic instability and apoptosis in c-Myc-activated cells. Wild-type Myc (wt-Myc) and two mutated Myc myc box II proteins (mt-Myc) were overexpressed in IL3-dependent murine Ba/F3 cells. As expected, wt-Myc triggered apoptosis in absence of IL3. Standard karyotyping, spectral karyotyping, and fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) were performed before and after c-Myc activation. Structural and numerical genomic instability was detected 48 h after wt-Myc activation and included gene amplification, the formation of extrachromosomal elements (EEs), chromosome breakage, deletions, increased aneuploidy, and polyploidization. Interestingly, some cells simultaneously displayed genomic instability and apoptosis. Both wt- and mt-Myc proteins were equally potent promoters of genomic instability. However, only wt-Myc simultaneously induced genomic instability and apoptosis. Mt-Myc proteins failed to induce apoptosis, thereby generating a strong imbalance towards the survival of genomically unstable cells."
https://openalex.org/W1974398251,"trkB activation results in tyrosine phosphorylation of N-terminal Kir3 residues, decreasing channel activation. To determine the mechanism of this effect, we reconstituted Kir3, trkB, and the mu opioid receptor in Xenopus oocytes. Activation of trkB by BDNF (brain-derived neurotrophic factor) accelerated Kir3 deactivation following termination of mu opioid receptor signaling. Similarly, overexpression of RGS4, a GTPase-activating protein (GAP), accelerated Kir3 deactivation. Blocking GTPase activity with GTPγS also prevented Kir3 deactivation, and the GTPγS effect was not reversed by BDNF treatment. These results suggest that BDNF treatment did not reduce Kir3 affinity for Gβγ but rather acted to accelerate GTPase activity, like RGS4. Tyrosine phosphatase inhibition by peroxyvanadate pretreatment reversibly mimicked the BDNF/trkB effect, indicating that tyrosine phosphorylation of Kir3 may have caused the GTPase acceleration. Tyrosine to phenylalanine substitution in the N-terminal domain of Kir3.4 blocked the BDNF effect, supporting the hypothesis that phosphorylation of these tyrosines was responsible. Like other GAPs, Kir3.4 contains a tyrosine-arginine-glutamine motif that is thought to function by interacting with G protein catalytic domains to facilitate GTP hydrolysis. These data suggest that the N-terminal tyrosine hydroxyls in Kir3 normally mask the GAP activity and that modification by phosphorylation or phenylalanine substitution reveals the GAP domain.

Chem. 2000; 275: 25082-25088Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), we found that tyrosine phosphorylation of Kir3 resulted in channel inhibition. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) activation of trkB receptors caused the phosphorylation of specific tyrosine residues in the N-terminal domain of Kir3.1 and Kir3.4, reducing basal channel conductance. Gβγ, released by opioid receptor activation, overcame the inhibition and evoked the original maximal effect. The results suggest that channel phosphorylation regulates the specific interaction with Gβγ, but the mechanism of this effect is unclear. However, the finding may be physiologically significant because tyrosine kinase cascades initiated by neurotrophic factors such as BDNF and nerve growth factor are up-regulated under conditions such as inflammation (8Woolf C.J. Costigan M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7723-7730Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). It is possible that tyrosine phosphorylation of Kir3 may mediate neuronal excitability in conjunction with GPCRs under conditions of inflammation. The goal of the present study was to define the mechanism responsible for BDNF inhibition of G protein regulation of Kir3 functioning. Recent evidence shows that both arms of the heterotrimeric G protein complex, Gαi and Gβγ, interact with Kir3 (9Peleg S. Varon D. Ivanina T. Dessauer C.W. Dascal N. Neuron. 2002; 33: 87-99Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Binding of the Gβγ subunit activates Kir3, whereas Gαibinding suppresses basal Kir3 activity and enhances G protein activation (9Peleg S. Varon D. Ivanina T. Dessauer C.W. Dascal N. Neuron. 2002; 33: 87-99Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). This action of Gαi binding resembles the effect of BDNF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation on Kir3. Both reduce basal channel activity without blocking GPCR activation of Kir3, suggesting the possibility of mechanistic similarity. Thus, we explored the hypothesis that the underlying mechanisms were related and that tyrosine phosphorylation controls Gαi regulation of Kir3 response to GPCR activation. Understanding the basis for the modulation of Kir3 by tyrosine phosphorylation would provide additional insight into the processes regulating the activity of this physiologically significant channel and a molecular basis for interaction between GPCR and tyrosine kinase receptor signaling. To test this hypothesis, we reconstituted the mu opioid receptor (MOR, a GPCR), Kir3, and trkB in Xenopus oocytes and investigated channel activation and deactivation kinetics. When current traces were fit to a simple exponential, trkB accelerated deactivation of Kir3. The kinetics resembled GTPase-activating protein (GAP)-mediated acceleration of channel deactivation, suggesting that trkB might stimulate GAP activity. Sequence alignment showed that Kir3 contains two signature GAP residues (glutamine and arginine) near both N-terminal domain tyrosines. These residues have been shown to promote catalytic activity of the GTPase domain (10Scheffzek K. Ahmadian M.R. Kabsch W. Wiesmuller L. Lautwein A. Schmitz F. Wittinghofer A.

Phenylalanine substitution of the two N-terminal tyrosine residues within these tyrosine-arginine-glutamine sequences resulted in Kir3 with constitutively faster kinetics of deactivation. Further, BDNF treatment no longer accelerated deactivation kinetics of the mutant channels. These results suggest that phosphorylation of Kir3 unmasks a GAP domain embedded in the sequence of Kir3 itself, promoting GAP activity. Plasmid vectors containing cDNA for the following GenBank accession numbers were obtained from Drs. Lei Yu, Cesar Lebarca, Henry Lester, John Adelman, Mark Bothwell, and Nathan Dascal, respectively: MOR (L13069), Kir3.1 (U01071), Kir3.4 (X83584), trkB (M55293), and RGS4 (AF117211). Kir3.4 was point-mutated by PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis to create the functional homomers Kir3.4(S143T) and Kir3.4(S143T/Y32F/Y53F) (7Rogalski S. Appleyard S. Pattillo A. Terman G. Chavkin C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25082-25088Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). cRNA was synthesized from linearized plasmid vectors using RNA polymerases provided by the commercially available mMessage mMachine kit (Ambion Corporation, Austin, TX). The cRNA was subsequently micro-injected into stage V and VI oocytes harvested from mature anesthetizedXenopus laevis frogs. Oocytes were maintained in high salt buffer (ND96: 96 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm HEPES, 2.5 mm sodium pyruvate, 50 μg/ml gentamicin, pH 7.5). Following 3–5 days of expression, the two-electrode voltage clamp technique was used to assess coupling efficiency of MOR to Kir3 in oocytes pretreated in BDNF or vehicle. Briefly, oocyte membranes were voltage-clamped at −80 mV by a microelectrode containing 3 m KCl (resistance between 0.4 and 2 mΩ) connected to a feedback amplifier (Axon Instruments, Inc.). A second microelectrode delivered current necessary to maintain the preset voltage. High potassium buffer (HK+: 2 mm NaCl, 96 mm KCl, 1 mmCaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mmHEPES, pH 7.5) and the MOR-agonist [d-Ala2,N-MePhe4-Gly-ol5]enkephalin (DAMGO, diluted in high potassium buffer) were sequentially washed onto the oocytes, and changes in current were recorded and analyzed using pCLAMP 6 software. DAMGO was obtained from Sigma and Peninsula Labs (San Carlos, CA). Naloxone was from Sigma. Sodium orthovanadate (Sigma) was activated in 3% hydrogen peroxide for 4–5 h prior to use. BDNF was a gift from AMGEN Corporation. All reagents were dissolved in water and then diluted in ND96 or high potassium buffer. Kinetics of Kir3 deactivation were calculated as reported previously by measuring time constant to reversal (τoff, 16, 17). Exponentials were fit to the naloxone reversal phases of the DAMGO-induced Kir3 currents. Cursors were positioned at ∼20 and 80% of the maximal equilibrium conductance from current initiation and termination, respectively. Current traces between these points were fit to exponential Equation 1. F(t)=∑i=1nAi*e−t/τi+CEquation 1 Time constants exceeding two standard deviations of the mean were excluded from the analysis. The membrane time constant (τoff) was used to estimate kinetics of Kir3 deactivation. Statistical significance was determined using an unpaired Student’s t test, in which a probability ofp < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. We found previously that tyrosine kinase phosphorylation of Kir3 modulates its conductance (7Rogalski S. Appleyard S. Pattillo A. Terman G. Chavkin C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25082-25088Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). To investigate how tyrosine phosphorylation cascades initiated by trkB might regulate Kir3 activation by G protein receptors, we coexpressed cRNA for Kir3.1, Kir3.4, trkB, and MOR in Xenopus oocytes. Oocytes were pretreated in either vehicle (ND96) or 0.2 μg/ml BDNF. Plasma membranes were clamped at −80 mV in two-electrode voltage clamp configuration. Perfusion of 96 mm potassium buffer (HK+) revealed an inwardly rectifying basal current (Fig.1A). Pretreatment in BDNF suppressed basal current to 77 ± 8% (p < 0.05,n = 35) of vehicle controls in agreement with previous studies (Fig. 1B). Basal current was potentiated when the MOR agonist (DAMGO, 1 μm) was perfused into the recording chamber. BDNF had no effect on the amplitude of the DAMGO-induced response (104 ± 1% of vehicle-treated controls,n = 35, Fig. 1B). MOR antagonist perfusion (naloxone, 1 μm) returned current back to basal amplitude, and ND96 perfusion returned the basal current to baseline (Fig. 1A). The rate of channel deactivation during naloxone perfusion appeared to increase after BDNF treatment. To quantify channel deactivation kinetics, we fit the portion of the trace between naloxone and final ND96 applications to a simple exponential. The time constant of deactivation (τoff) was calculated using pCLAMP software as described under “Experimental Procedures.” BDNF significantly accelerated channel deactivation rate; τoffwas reduced to 71 ± 3% of vehicle control (p < 0.05, n = 35, Fig. 1, A and B). Channel activation rate, as measured by τon, was not significantly accelerated in BDNF-treated oocytes (data not shown). The decrease in the τoff parameter was not a consequence of the reduced basal current amplitude; a regression analysis showed no correlation between DAMGO current amplitude and τoff(r2 < 0.1). Oocytes lacking the trkB receptor did not show significant acceleration of Kir3 deactivation or decrease in basal channel conductance following BDNF treatment (data not shown). Thus, trkB activation by BDNF reduced the basal channel conductance and accelerated the deactivation kinetics of Kir3 without reducing the maximal DAMGO-evoked effect. Because Kir3 conductance is controlled predominately by binding to free Gβγ, these results suggest that tyrosine phosphorylation affected the interaction between channel and Gβγ. The kinetic profile we describe for Kir3 deactivation resembles GAP-mediated acceleration of deactivation without concomitant decrease in DAMGO current amplitude or increase in τon(18Doupnik C. Davidson N. Lester H. Kofuji P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10461-10466Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). To illustrate the kinetic similarity, we injected 10 ng of cRNA for the GAP RGS4 into oocytes expressing Kir3, MOR, and trkB 12–18 h before recording. When traces were fit to a simple exponential, Kir3 deactivation (as measured by τoff) was accelerated from 39 ± 3 s (Kir3.1/3.4, n = 28) to 27 ± 3 s (Kir3.1/3.4, n = 36) when oocytes not expressing RGS4 were pretreated in BDNF (Fig.2). Injection of RGS4 accelerated channel deactivation to 12 ± 2 s (τoff,n = 7). BDNF treatment reduced τoff to 7 ± 1 s (n = 11). These results show that trkB modulation of deactivation kinetics is similar to the effect of the GAP RGS4, leading to the speculation that both operate by similar mechanisms. To test the hypothesis that trkB activation increased GAP activity (rather than decreasing Gβγ binding affinity for Kir3) we inhibited GTP hydrolysis by injecting GTPγS, a non-hydrolyzable analogue of GTP (19Dascal N. Ifune C. Hopkins R. Snutch T.P. Lubbert H. Davidson N. Simon M.I. Lester H.A. Brain Res. 1986; 387: 201-209PubMed Google Scholar). If Kir3 deactivation rate was controlled solely by Gβγ dissociation and not Gβγ sequestration by Gαi·GDP, then BDNF-accelerated deactivation could result from a reduction in Gβγ affinity for the channel. Alternatively, if the deactivation rate was controlled by Gβγ sequestration by Gαi·GDP, then the accelerated deactivation rate would result from a BDNF-induced increased GTPase activity that would be blocked by GTPγS. In oocytes expressing MOR, trkB, and Kir3, GTPγS virtually eliminated Kir3 deactivation whether or not RGS4 was injected (Fig. 3,a and b). Pretreatment with BDNF did not accelerate deactivation kinetics of GTPγS-injected oocytes (Fig.3c). Because BDNF pretreatment did not even partially recover deactivation in the presence of GTPγS, trkB-mediated acceleration of deactivation kinetics was probably not a result of a reduction in Gβγ affinity for the channel. These results suggest that trkB accelerates channel deactivation by facilitating GTP hydrolysis and subsequent Gβγ sequestration by Gαi. Previously, we identified tyrosine residues in the Kir3 N-terminal tail that were phosphorylated by trkB and modulated Kir3 gating parameters (7Rogalski S. Appleyard S. Pattillo A. Terman G. Chavkin C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25082-25088Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). To investigate whether phosphorylation state of Kir3 controlled channel deactivation, we pretreated oocytes with the phosphatase inhibitor peroxyvanadate (100 μm) before voltage clamp experimentation. Peroxyvanadate pretreatment reduced τoff from 39 ± 3 s (n= 4) to 23 ± 5 s (n = 4). A 3-min perfusion with ND96 returned τoff to 34 ± 2 s (n = 4), approaching vehicle-treated controls (Fig.4, A and C). Conversely, when oocytes were pretreated first in vehicle followed by a 3-min treatment in peroxyvanadate, channel deactivation was accelerated (Fig. 4B). These results suggest that constitutive phosphorylation of Kir3 may result in enhanced GTP hydrolysis. We hypothesized that BDNF/trkB-induced phosphorylation of specific N-terminal tyrosine residues accelerated Kir3 deactivation kinetics. Deactivation kinetics were compared for Kir3.4(S143T) (a variant able to form functional homomers as described) (20Vivaudou M. Chan K.W. Sui J.L. Jan L.Y. Reuveny E. Logothetis D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31553-31560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) and Kir3.4(S143T/Y32F/Y53F) (a homomeric channel with both N-terminal tyrosine residues point-mutated to phenylalanines) (7Rogalski S. Appleyard S. Pattillo A. Terman G. Chavkin C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25082-25088Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). trkB activation accelerated channel deactivation in oocytes expressing Kir3.4(S143T) (vehicle, τoff = 26 ± 4 s, n = 18 and BDNF, τoff = 17 ± 1 s,n = 17). However, trkB no longer accelerated deactivation in the double tyrosine to phenylalanine mutant (vehicle, τoff = 15 ± 1 s, n = 30 and BDNF, τoff = 15 ± 1 s, n = 40, Fig. 5A). These results suggest that trkB-mediated phosphorylation of these tyrosine residues is important in facilitating GAP activity of the channel. Interestingly, we found that the Kir3.4(S143T/Y32F/Y53F) mutations constitutively accelerated Kir3.4 kinetics (compare Kir3.4(S143T), τoff = 26 ± 4 s, n = 18 with Kir3.4(S143T/Y32F/Y53F), τoff = 15 ± 1 s,n = 30, Fig. 5A). These results suggest that the hydroxyl group in the tyrosine dampens GAP activity because phenylalanine substitution for tyrosine promotes GAP activity. A direct measure of GTPase activity of Kir3 was not possible because we would not have attained the high level of channel expression required (21Mosser V.A. Amana I.J. Schimerlik M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 922-931Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Recently, the crystal structures of G protein·GAP combinations such as Ras-Ras·GAP, Rho-Rho·GAP, and Gαi·RGS have been solved (10Scheffzek K. Ahmadian M.R. Kabsch W. Wiesmuller L. Lautwein A.

Cell. 1997; 89: 251-261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar). A sequence alignment of the amino acids in the vicinity of Kir3.4 N-terminal tyrosine residues revealed that these tyrosines are part of a signature consensus sequence recurring in some GAPs to facilitate hydrolysis of GTP by directly inserting these amino acid residues into the catalytic binding pocket (Fig. 5B). RGS4 is also a GAP, but crystal structure data indicate that it does not contribute amino acid residues to the Gαi but instead holds the Gαi in a catalytically favored transition state (24Tesmer J.J. Berman D.M. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Cell. 1997; 89: 251-261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar). To determine whether trkB worked cooperatively with RGS4 to accelerate channel deactivation, we investigated the effect of BDNF pretreatment on the τoff parameter in oocytes expressing RGS4, trkB, Kir3 mutants, and MOR. RGS4 accelerated channel deactivation in the Kir3.4(S143T/Y32F/Y53F) mutants (τoff= 10 ± 2 s, n = 20, Fig. 5A), but BDNF had no additional effect (τoff = 15 ± 2 s, n = 18). In fact, time constants resembled BDNF-pretreated oocytes lacking RGS4 (Fig. 5A). Similar acceleration of deactivation was seen in Kir3.4(S143T) mutants (compare RGS4, τoff = 13 ± 3 s, n = 37 with RGS4+BDNF, τoff = 19 ± 3 s,n = 8). These results suggest an independent mechanism of Kir3 GAP activity for RGS4- and trkB-mediated Kir3 phosphorylation. We conclude that Kir3.4 contains critical GAP-like amino acids and probably acts as a GAP for Gαi. GAP activity is kept in check by the tyrosine hydroxyl. Either elimination of the hydroxyl by phenyalanine substitution or phosphorylation of the hydroxyl by tyrosine kinase signaling cascades results in potentiation of GAP activity. These results suggest a novel control mechanism of channel deactivation. The principal finding of this study is that tyrosine phosphorylation of Kir3 by trkB/BDNF reduces channel activation by accelerating GTPase kinetics. Our data did not support the alternative hypothesis that the binding affinity of channel for Gβγ was reduced by channel phosphorylation. The concept that the channel regulates the GTPase activity of the Gαi subunit is novel, although the principle of an effector providing feedback regulation of its activator is well established (15Vetter I.R.

Tyrosine phosphorylation has been described previously as a regulator of ion conductance of potassium and other ion channels (7Rogalski S. Appleyard S. Pattillo A. Terman G. Chavkin C. J. Biol.

Our study provides a novel link between Kir3 tyrosine phosphorylation and G protein-mediated signaling. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration that tyrosine phosphorylation of an ion channel regulates intrinsic GTPase accelerating capacity. Recent evidence shows that Gαi binds directly to the Kir3 itself, suppressing basal Gβγ binding and basal current amplitude (9Peleg S. Varon D. Ivanina T. Dessauer C.W. Dascal N.

The tyrosine residues masking Kir3.4 GAP activity in our study are within this domain. Further, the arginine, glutamine, and tyrosine residues in the portion of Kir3 contacting Gαi are residues found in GTPase-activating proteins shown by crystallography to be critical in stabilizing the transition state of Gαi, favoring catalysis (10Scheffzek K.

Our data support a role for the tyrosine hydroxyl in reducing rather than enhancing catalysis. Nevertheless, without crystal structure data for Kir3, speculations about the contributions of specific residues remain unverified. The trkB facilitation of Kir3 deactivation kinetically resembles RGS4-mediated return to basal current (16Gutfreund H. Kinetics for the Life Sciences: Receptors, Transmitters, and Catalysts.

Like kinetics after trkB activation, the RGS proteins elicit a similar acceleration of return to inactive heterotrimeric G protein state, presumably by mediating direct hydrolysis of GTP and resulting in a return of Gαi to the GDP-bound state (13Kovoor A.

Besides, if trkB induced a decrease in the affinity of Gβγ for Kir3, we would have expected trkB/BDNF at least partially to overcome blockage of GTPase activity by enhancing Gβγ dissociation from Kir3, thereby restoring deactivation kinetics in oocytes injected with GTPγS. Because BDNF/trkB did not restore GTPase activity in this experiment, we favor the hypothesis that trkB activation increases GTP hydrolysis. This report provides a novel mechanism for Kir3.4 modulating its own kinetic parameters by dual GAP sequences in its N-terminal tail. GAP facilitation by phosphorylation may promote Kir3 deactivation, potentially providing a new mechanism for regulation of channel function. In opioid regulation of inflammatory pain, for example, endogenous opioids such as β-endorphin, methionine-enkephalin, and dynorphin-A are released from immune cells in inflamed tissue (44Cabot P.J.

J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 142-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Neurotrophic factors such as BDNF and nerve growth factor are up-regulated under these conditions as well (8Woolf C.J.

Further, in studies involving mice with mutant Kir3 channels (weaver), analgesia after opioid treatment is decreased, suggesting a role for Kir3 itself in opioid-mediated analgesia (41Ikeda K. Kobayashi T. Kumanishi T. Niki H. Yano R. Neurosci. Res. 2000; 38: 113-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Thus, inflammatory pain represents a scenario in which tyrosine kinase cascades coexist with G protein-coupled receptor stimulation in anatomical regions associated with pain transmission such as the dorsal horn of the spinal cord, potentially modulating neuronal excitability by a Kir3-dependent mechanism. Further, in the heart GPCRs such as angiotensin II type 1 receptor mobilize the tyrosine kinase Src, which plays a role in modulating excitability by increasing cellular calcium (32Haendeler J. Berk B.C. Regul. Pept. 2000; 95: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). A concomitant increase in GTPase activity following Src phosphorylation of Kir3 might likewise contribute to the increase in cardiac excitability. Thus, regulation of Kir3 functioning by tyrosine kinase cascades may provide an important means for physiologically regulating cardiac and neuronal excitability during processes such as development, inflammatory responses, synaptic plasticity, and cardiac excitability."

Recently, it has become apparent that the metabolism of many compounds by CYPs, including CYP isoforms 3A4, 1A2, and 2C9, occurs with non-Michaelis-Menten behavior. Plots of reaction velocityversus [substrate] are sigmoidal or biphasic, as with allosteric positive homotropic effects or negative homotropic effects, respectively (3Guengerich F.P. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1999; 39: 1-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (1040) Google Scholar, 4Korzekwa K.R. Krishnamachary N. Shou M. Ogai A. Parise R.A. Rettie A.E. Gonzalez F.J. Tracey T.S.

Possible mechanisms include multiple ligand binding to a single active site, multiple ligand binding at spatially distinct sites, multiple ligand binding to CYP conformational isomers with distinct kinetic properties, or a combination of these (4Korzekwa K.R.

Although allosteric behavior is now well documented for CYPs, its toxicological advantage, if any, has not been considered. Here, the term toxicological advantage is defined as any change in system parameters that results in a decrease in the integrated area under the curve (AUC) of the toxicity versus time function. “Toxicity” is a substrate- and product-dependent function described within.Allostery is observed usually with complex oligomeric enzymes that control key regulatory processes in intermediary metabolism. These regulatory mechanisms rely on highly specific molecular recognition of allosteric “effector” molecules or specific homotropic interactions and have evolved because the allosteric properties of such enzymes yield physiological advantages. Thus, functional allostery is generally coupled to biological specificity. In most cases, the allosteric behavior affords control of an enzymatic reaction or metabolic pathway for which the advantage of allostery is easily rationalized. However, these allosteric traits are obscured with CYPs. Has there been an evolutionary selective pressure for CYPs to exhibit non-hyperbolic reaction kinetics? If so, how can functional allostery be achieved in the absence of specific molecular recognition? These questions are not entirely insignificant; an understanding of the biological advantage of CYP cooperativity could yield insight into their allosteric mechanisms, and it could aid in metabolism-based drug design. Here we examine through kinetic simulations the possibility that allosteric kinetic behavior provides a detoxification advantage when bioactivated toxic products are a significant threat.Elegant theoretical analyses of “optimized” enzymes have focused predominantly on features that maximize flux of substrate through an enzymatic cycle or through a metabolic pathway (10Albery W.J. Knowles J.R. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 5631-5640Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar, 11Burbaum J.J. Raines R.T. Albery J. Knowles J.R.

Although the details of these analyses differ, a common focus has been the utility for an enzyme to optimizekcat/Km while not loweringKm much below the physiological concentration of substrate. Extremely low Km values may result in “wasted” binding energy. A second common feature of optimized enzymes and enzymatic pathways is their tendency to have multiple steps with similar rate, so no single intermediate accumulates. Knowles and co-workers (10Albery W.J. Knowles J.R. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 5631-5640Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar) have stressed that the optimal kinetic parameters must take into account the biological niche of the enzyme being considered. Wolfenden and colleagues (12Wolfenden R. Snider M.J. Acc. Chem. Res. 2001; 34: 938-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (703) Google Scholar) have emphasized that limits of enzymatic “proficiency” are determined by the kinetics of the uncatalyzed reaction. These benchmarks don’t seem to apply to detoxification enzymes, which have no “specific” substrate and often yield multiple products from a single substrate. Even if a specific substrate is considered, what is a physiologically relevant concentration around which to optimizekcat/Km? The situation becomes further complicated in light of the possibility of bioactivation, wherein substrates are actually metabolized to more toxic products (16van Iersel M.L. Verhagen H. van Bladeren P.J. Mutat. Res. 1999; 443: 259-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 17Castagnoli N., Jr. Rimoldi J.M. Bloomquist J. Castagnoli K.P. Chem. Res.

Rettie A.E. Nelson S.D. Drug Metab. Dispos. 2000; 28: 1397-1400PubMed Google Scholar). Apparently, the existing theories must be expanded to understand CYP allostery.Bioactivation processes underscore the fact that, for changes in the xenobiotics to which we are exposed on the evolutionary time scale,naive species can not “know” which metabolites of any compound will be toxic. Therefore, evolutionary pressure may not eliminate completely the possibility of bioactivation of previously unencountered xenobiotics. Instead, for enzymatic detoxification evolutionary optimization of enzyme parameters becomes a probabilistic process. Therefore, when considering whether the allostery observed for CYP-dependent reactions can be rationalized in terms of their detoxification role, we must account for inadvertent bioactivation.We have suggested previously that detoxification enzymes such as CYPs may evolve, not only to metabolize a wide range of structurally unrelated xenobiotics, but also to minimize the probability of bioactivation of previously unencountered xenobiotics by distributing the toxic load into multiple products (20Cook D. Atkins W.M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10801-10806Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). We have referred to this probabilistic process as “distributive catalysis.” Distributive catalysis will provide a detoxification advantage if the toxicity of a compound and its metabolites exhibit sublinear, or threshold, dose-response relationships. The existence of sublinear toxic dose-response curves at low toxin concentration has been suspected or documented for many cases and may be a general feature of toxic responses in higher organisms (21Cassee F.R. Groton J.P. van Bladderen P.J. Feron V.J. Crit. Rev. Toxicol. 1998; 28: 73-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 22Gaylor D.W.

Schwetz B.A. Environ. Health Perspect. 1998; 106 Suppl. 1: 391-395PubMed Google Scholar). Here, results of theoretical simulations are described in which the kinetics of substrate turnover and product formation are compared with two indices of toxicity: the total toxin concentration and the relative toxicity of their sum. The results suggest that non-hyperbolic velocityversus [substrate] curves, for CYP metabolism of toxins, can sometimes afford a toxicological advantage when toxic thresholds exist. At low substrate concentration, this advantage exists when the overall clearance of the total toxin load is slower than with a corresponding non-allosteric enzyme. This advantage results from the fact that the allosteric kinetics provide a type of distributive catalysis. At high substrate concentrations, the distributive advantage is best accomplished with faster turnover, as achieved by allostery. Thus, the CYPs may represent functional allostery in the absence of highly specific molecular recognition.MATERIALS AND METHODSModels were created and simulations performed with Kinecyte (Raintown Biotech, Seattle, WA), a cell biological kinetic modeling program, as described previously (20Cook D. Atkins W.M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10801-10806Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The initial velocities are based on simulations of 1–2 min of steady-state product formation, for which the rate of product formation was linear versustime. For all models used here, the free substrate is in rapid equilibrium with the enzyme-bound species. For calculation of area under the curve (AUC) of ΣTox, the output from Kinecyte was exported to the program Origin.In the previously described model for distributive catalysis (20Cook D. Atkins W.M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10801-10806Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), we defined two parameters to monitor the toxicity that may be expected due to a xenobiotic, as other system parameters change. The “total toxin concentration” (Σ[Toxi]) is the sum of the concentrations of free substrate and free product throughout the simulation. In an isolated conversion of S ⇒ P during steady state, this sum differs from the starting concentration of substrate only by the amount of substrate and product sequestered in complexes with the enzyme, which we have defined as “non-toxic,” because compounds sequestered by the enzyme are unlikely to contribute to toxicity. For the cases examined here, the sequestration effect is negligible, but it may be an interesting additional device exploited by detoxification enzymes, and we include this parameter as a check for internal consistency. The second parameter, ΣTox is the “relative toxicity” that results, assuming that each free substrate and free product has an equal a priori probability of being toxic. Obviously, in a real system either S or P is likely to be more toxic. However, the condition in which S and P are equally toxic emphasizes the probabilistic nature of detoxification systems and the need to optimize the likelihood of detoxification in the absence of prior experience with a given substrate/product pair. For the case here, where a single product is generated from the substrate, the relative toxicity is ΣTox = [([S]/[S]0)K + ([P]/[S]0)K], where [S] is the concentration of free substrate at time t, [P] is the free product concentration at time t, [S]0 is the initial substrate concentration, and K is a Hill coefficient for the toxic responses of S and P. The relative toxicity represents the probabilistic sum of toxicity that results when S or P are toxic, and their toxicity is proportional to [S]K or [P]K, respectively. This definition does not depend on any specific molecular events nor a specific toxic end point. Any toxic end point that is dependent on concentration is applicable. The exponential termK is introduced to reflect the fact that many toxins exhibit thresholds in their dose-response functions, i.e. low concentrations are tolerated with no toxicity. In fact, low dose toxin-response curves have been modeled as similar power functions by others (24Gaylor D.W. Bolger P.M. Schwetz B.A. Environ. Health Perspect. 1998; 106 Suppl. 1: 391-395PubMed Google Scholar). The slope of the threshold increases with K, as shown in Fig. 1. Note that K is not a Hill coefficient for the CYP enzyme catalyzing the conversion of S to P but, rather, for the toxic responses of S and P. As discussed previously, this definition of relative toxicity provides a convenient method for calculating the “probable toxicity” with varying threshold steepness (K), when no a priori knowledge for the toxicities of S or P is available, and when their toxicities are assumed to be equal. Note that when K = 1, no threshold exists. We have suggested that a species with no prior exposure to a toxin, S, will have not experienced selective pressure favoring or disfavoring its conversion to P, and it must be assumed a priori that their toxicities are equal. The rate equations used to calculate the change in concentration of each species were as follows, δ[S]/δt=−k1[CYP·S]+k−1×[CYP·S]+k−1×[CYP·S]Equation 1 −k2×[CYP·S]+k−2×[CYP·S·S] δ[P]/δt=−[P]×kelim+kcat1×[CYP·S]+kcat2×[CYP·S·S]Equation 2 δ[CYP]/δt=−k1×[CYP]×[S]+k−1×[CYP·S]Equation 3 +kcat1×[CYP·S] δ[CYP·S]/δt=k1×[CYP·S]−k1×[CYP·S]−k2×[CYP·S]×[S]+k−2×[CYP·S·S]−kcat1×[CYP·S]+kcat2×[CYP·S·S]Equation 4 δ[CYP·S·S]/δt=k2×[CYP·S]×[S]−k−2×[CYP·S·S]−kcat2×[CYP·S·S]Equation 5 RESULTSConstruction of a ModelAs described under “Materials and Methods,” the model for the toxin dose-response curve is shown in Fig.1. The toxicity function that yields the responses is also described under “Materials and Methods.” For the case of CYP-dependent metabolism with allosteric kinetics, it is assumed that two substrate molecules bind simultaneously to a single CYP molecule. However, no other assumptions are made, concerning the mechanism of allostery. The models do not attempt to distinguish between simultaneous binding at a single active site or at separate catalytic and regulatory sites as discussed by others. For all positive homotropic models considered, the kinetic scheme shown in Fig.2A was used, and each of the individual rate constants, k1,k−1, k2,k−2, kcat1, andkcat2, was explicitly defined. The reactions leading to product formation (kcat1 andkcat2) were considered to be irreversible, and they comprise multiple steps, including the rate-limiting steps of the CYP reaction cycle after substrate binding.Figure 2A, generic allosteric kinetic scheme for CYPs. Both the [CYP·S] and [CYP·S·S] complexes yield P. The individual parameters have been manipulated as described in the text to mimic either positive homotropic (sigmoidal) kinetics or negative homotropic (biphasic) kinetics. B, plots of velocityversus [substrate] for models compared in this manuscript. The Michaelis-Menten enzyme (MM) yields hyperbolic kinetics, whereas the V system yields sigmoidal kinetics. The slow MMenzyme is a hyperbolic enzyme with parameters that yield the same velocity as the V system at [S]0 = 1 μm, the concentration used for comparison in the ΣTox function.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To compare the toxicological consequences of positive homotropic effects (sigmoidal kinetics) with standard Michaelis-Menten kinetics, three models were constructed based on the general allosteric scheme in Fig. 2A. These models mimic: 1) an enzyme with non-interacting sites, which displays “normal” Michaelis-Menten kinetics. This model allows for substrates to bind simultaneously, but each binds with the same dissociation constant,KS, and the turnover rate is the same whether one substrate is bound or two are bound. This enzyme yields a hyperbolic velocity versus [substrate] plot, as shown in Fig. 2B. This enzyme, characterized by Michaelis-Menten kinetics is referred to as “MM.” For the MM enzyme, the rate constants for binding and dissociation of product were 1 × 106m−1 s−1 and 2.0 s−1, respectively, for both substrates. The turnover rate for both [CYP·S] and [CYP·S·S] was 1 s−1. This model provides the “parent” MM system from which allosteric enzymes are obtained, by manipulation of various parameters. 2) an allosteric enzyme with interacting sites, in which the [CYP·S] complex has a 100-fold slower turnover rate than the [CYP·S·S] complex, resulting in sigmoidal kinetics. Both substrates have the same affinity for the enzyme (KS). This represents an allosteric “V” system, wherein the allostery is due to an increase in reaction velocity upon binding the second substrate, with no change in KS. Here, thek1 = k2 = 1 × 106m−1 s−1 andk−1 = k−2 = 2 s−1, kcat1 = 0.01 s−1, and kcat2 = 1.0 s−1, orkcat2 = 100 kcat1. 3) A slow Michaelis-Menten enzyme that matches the velocity of the V system at a single low value of [S]0, i.e. it intersects the V system at low [S]0. The allosteric V system is compared with the “slow MM” and MM systems from which it is derived in Fig. 2. For the first limiting case, [S]0 = 0.95 μm, which is arbitrarily chosen as a “low” [S]0 below the Km or S0.5. For the following models we use the terms Km and S0.5 according to their standard meanings. Specifically,Km is the substrate concentration affording 1/2·Vmax for a MM enzyme, and S0.5is the substrate concentration which affords 1/2·Vmax for the V allosteric systems.As shown in Fig. 2A, P may be subsequently metabolized or “cleared” by other enzymatic, chemical, or physical process, which are left unspecified. Obviously, the rate constant for this elimination, kelim, will be a determinant of steady-state concentrations of P. Although this parameter is not controlled by the detoxification enzymes modeled here,kelim is part of their biologicalniche, and a range of values is included.Having constructed kinetic models that mimic CYP-dependent metabolism, the relative toxicity expected for a substrate can be studied for different enzyme parameters. Simulations are presented below that track the relative toxicity when a model enzyme is presented with a single dose of a toxic substrate.Positive Homotropic EffectsLow [S]0, kelim = 0, Positive Homotropic EffectsThe first case considered is administration of a single dose of toxin S, at a concentration below its Km for the MM enzyme, or below its S0.5 for a V system allosteric enzyme. For the first case,kelim = 0, to emphasize the importance of toxin distribution. To ensure the predictive accuracy of the models for the parameters we have defined, we first monitor [S], [P], [total toxin] = Σ[Ti], and relative toxicity (ΣTox) for different values of K, with the parent MM enzyme described above. Results are summarized in Fig. 3. As expected for the case where K has no effect on the properties of the CYP enzyme, but only on the toxic response of S or P, Fig. 3 (A and B) demonstrates the depletion of substrate and accumulation of product for an initial concentration of [S]0 = 0.95 μm. Because the enzymatic reaction is irreversible, all of the substrate is converted to product. Also, as expected, the [total toxin] remains nearly constant at 1 μm, except for the subtle “dip” at ∼10–20 s (Fig.3C), which reflects the detoxification due to sequestration of substrate and product by the enzyme (at 0.01 μm) prior to complete conversion of S to P. Fig. 3D demonstrates that for K = 1 (no threshold in the toxic response of S or P) the relative toxicity in consistent with the [total toxin], and there is no significant detoxification as a result of converting S to P. However, as K increases, even a modest threshold effect (K = 2) results in a significant, but transient, decrease in the relative toxicity, due to the distribution of toxic species in two forms, each with a threshold. As all of the substrate is converted to P, this advantage due to distribution is lost by 200–300 s, and the relative toxicity ends at the same level at which it began. For each K value, the minimum relative toxicity is at ∼50 s, which corresponds to the point at which one-half of the substrate has been converted to P ([S]/ [P] = 1). Note that K is not a property of the CYP enzyme, so changing K does not change the rate at which this minimum is reached. However, as the toxic threshold increases with K, the toxicity decreases further when [S]/[P] = 1.Figure 3Comparison of system components at low [S]0 = 0.95 μmfor a closed MM system where kelim = 0.A, rate of elimination of S at varying K values.

With increasingK, the advantage of distribution increases.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)In the next set of simulations, the MM enzyme is converted to a sigmoidal V system by decreasing the value forkcat1. At low concentrations of S, we expect a slower overall conversion of S to P, due to a decrease in velocity, as shown in Fig. 4. Whereas the MM enzyme converted all of S to P within 400 s, this V system requires more than 1000 s. Fig. 4C demonstrates that the [total toxin] remains nearly constant except for the transient small dip, due to sequestration at short times. As with the MM system, the relative toxicity (Fig. 4D) exhibits a transient decrease, with the minimum value of relative toxicity decreasing with increasingK. Each value of K affords a minimum at the same time point, which corresponds to one-half reaction completion. In comparison to the MM system, the relative toxicity reaches its minimum value later in the process (∼200 s) and takes much longer to reach the value of 1, corresponding to complete conversion of S to P. In essence, all of the processes observed for the MM enzyme (Fig. 3) are qualitatively the same as in Fig. 4, but they occur more slowly for the V system, and this appears to provide a detoxification advantage by extending the period over which the relative toxicity remains below a value of 1.Figure 4Comparison of system components at low [S]0 = 0.95 μmfor a closed allosteric V system where kelim = 0.A, rate of elimination of S at varying Kvalues. B, rate of formation of P at varying Kvalues. The rate is not affected by changes in K. C, Σ[Toxi], the sum of toxins. Because the system is closed, the only change in Σ[Toxi] is due to sequestration of S by CYP, yielding a slight dip. D, the relative toxicity function, which reaches a minimum at maximal distribution of [S] and [P] ([S]/[P] = 1). With increasingK, the advantage of distribution increases, and for the allosteric system the toxicity remains low for an extended period compared with the MM system.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Together, these simulations indicate that a toxic advantage is gained for the allosteric V system, where the relative toxicity is transiently reduced for a longer period than for the MM enzyme. In fact, this can be quantitatively compared as integrated area under the curve (AUC), the index of toxic effect. The AUC values of the toxicity function (ΣTox) for the MM enzyme versus the V system are plotted in Fig. 5. At K > 1, there is a dramatic decrease in the toxic AUC when sigmoidal kinetics apply to the CYP responsible for toxin metabolism. The resulting difference in AUC (AUCMM − AUCsig) is positive and advantageous. This is the simple result of extending the period during which the toxins are distributed in two pools, S and P. This, in turn, appears to result from slowing down the rate of conversion. That is, the slower enzymes are advantageous when there is an equal probability that S or P is toxic and when the concentration dependence of their toxicities exhibits a threshold. Interestingly, the slow enzyme could provide an advantage also if P were more toxic than S, askelim approaches zero.Figure 5Toxic advantage for the sigmoidal enzyme in a closed system. The difference in AUC (AUCMM − AUCsig) of the ΣTox function at varying K forkelim = 0.

VN also interacts with two-chain high molecular weight kininogen (HKa), particularly its His-Gly-Lys-rich domain 5, and both HKa and PAI-1 are antiadhesive factors that have been shown to compete for binding to VN. In this study the influence of HKa and domain 5 on the antifibrinolytic function of PAI-1 was investigated. In a purified system, HKa and particularly domain 5 inhibited the binding of PAI-1 to VN and promoted PAI-1 displacement from both isolated VN as well as subendothelial extracellular matrix-associated VN. The sequence Gly486-Lys502 of HKa domain 5 was identified as responsible for this inhibition. Although having no direct effect on PAI-1 activity itself, HKa domain 5 or the peptide Gly486-Lys502 markedly destabilized the VN·PAI-1 complex interaction, resulting in a significant reduction of PAI-1 inhibitory function on plasminogen activators, resembling the effect of VN antibodies that prevent stabilization of PAI-1. Furthermore, high affinity fibrin binding of PAI-1 in the presence of VN as well as the VN-dependent fibrin clot stabilization by the inhibitor were abrogated in the presence of the kininogen forms mentioned. Taken together, our data indicate that the peptide Gly486-Lys502 derived from domain 5 of HKa serves to interfere with PAI-1 function. Based on these observations potential low molecular weight PAI-1 inhibitors could be designed for the use in therapeutic interventions against thromboembolic complications.

Lewis A. Circulation. 1994; 90: 2126-2146Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Physiological thrombus formation is balanced between the procoagulant pathway involving platelets and coagulation factors as well as the anticoagulant and fibrinolytic systems including intrinsic thrombin inhibition and clot dissolution. Intravascular fibrinolysis is initiated primarily by the protease tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA),1 which generates plasmin from its inactive precursor plasminogen in a fibrin-specific manner (2Collen D. Lijnen H.R. Blood. 1994; 78: 3114-3124Crossref Google Scholar). Regulation of plasminogen activation in a fibrin-specific fashion is achieved by plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), which forms a stable inactive complex with tPA (3Loskutoff D.J. Sawdey M. Mimuro J. Prog. Hemostasis Thromb. 1989; 9: 87-115PubMed Google Scholar). The majority of clot-responsive PAI-1 is provided during platelet degranulation and accumulates within the forming thrombus rendering it initially resistant to fibrinolysis (4Fay W.P. Eitzman D.T.

In contrast, PAI-1 deficiency in humans is associated with abnormal bleeding, indicating an important role of PAI-1 in stabilization of the hemostatic clot (10Schleef R.R. Higgins D.L. Pillemer E.

Only in complex with vitronectin (VN), an abundant plasma and wound matrix-associated glycoprotein, PAI-1 becomes functionally stabilized by high affinity binding within the N-terminal region of the multifunctional adhesive glycoprotein (13Preissner K.T.

Moreover, VN plays a critical role in PAI-1 binding to fibrin (18Podor T.J. Peterson C.B. Lawrence D.A. Stefansson S. Shaughnessy S.G. Foulon D.M. Butcher M. Weitz J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19788-19794Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). It is believed that PAI-1 may also induce conformational changes in VN leading to multimerization (19Seiffert D. Loskutoff D.J. J. Biol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 13705-13710Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Finally, PAI-1 serves as an important antiadhesive factor for VN-dependent cell adhesion reactions involving either integrins or the urokinase receptor (21Kjoller L. Kanse S.M. Kirkegaard T.

Nature. 1996; 383: 441-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar). Similar to PAI-1, the six domain-containing high molecular weight kininogen (HK), and especially the kinin-free two-chain form (HKa) (23Nishikawa K. Shibayama Y. Kuna P. Calcaterra E. Kaplan A.P. Reddigari S.R. Blood. 1992; 80: 1980-1988Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), binds to VN and serves as an additional antiadhesive protein for both integrin- and urokinase receptor-dependent cellular interactions (24Chavakis T.

The antiadhesive function of HKa is mediated by the His-Gly-Lys-rich domain 5, enabling HKa also to bind to anionic or cellular surfaces, to zinc or heparin (25Retzios A.D. Rosenfeld R. Schiffman S.

We have demonstrated previously that HKa and PAI-1 compete for proximal binding sites within the N-terminal “somatomedin B” domain of VN (24Chavakis T. Kanse S.M. Lupu F. Hammes H.P. Mu¨ller-Esterl W. Pixley R.A. Colman R.W. Preissner K.T. Blood. 2000; 96: 514-522Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Experimental evidence from in vitro and in vivostudies renders HK anti- rather than prothrombotic; a prothrombotic phenotype was reported for kininogen-deficient rats (30Colman R.W. White J.V. Scovell S. Stadnicki A. Sartor R.B. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1999; 19: 2245-2250Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), and patients deficient in kininogen or other proteins of the contact phase system are at increased risk for thrombosis (31Lammle B.

In particular, HK/HKa may regulate pericellular plasmin generation by modulating plasma kallikrein-dependent formation of urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA) (35Lin Y. Harris R.B. Yan W. McCrae K.R. Zhang H. Colman R.W. Blood. 1997; 90: 690-697Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), a reaction dependent on the binding of plasma prekallikrein to HK domain 6 (36Tait J.F. Fujikawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 15396-15401Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The competition between HKa and PAI-1 for proximal binding sites on VN prompted us to investigate whether HKa can interfere with the VN-stabilized functions of PAI-1. Our results indicate that HKa, domain 5, and especially a particular peptide Gly486-Lys502 can inhibit the function of PAI-1 as a primary inhibitor of fibrinolysis thereby providing a novel plausible mechanism for the recently described antithrombotic properties of kininogen. Finally, based on the sequence Gly486-Lys502 within domain 5 of HKa, potential low molecular weight PAI-1 inhibitors could be designed for therapeutic interventions in thrombotic vascular complications. Single- and two-chain high molecular weight kininogen (HK and HKa) were purchased from Enzyme Research Laboratories (South Bend, IN). The purified HK and HKa (>95%) appeared as major bands of 140 and 110 kDa, respectively, on nonreduced SDS-gels. HK was digested with plasma kallikrein (HK:kallikrein, 100:1, mol/mol) for 20 min at 37 °C to obtain HKa, which appears as two bands of 62 and 46 kDa when analyzed by reduced SDS-gel electrophoresis. GlutathioneS-transferase (GST) fused to domain 3, 5, or 6 of HK or to sequences derived from domain 5 were produced as described previously (37Kunapuli S.P. DeLa Cadena R.A. Colman R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2486-2492Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). GST was N-terminally attached to the following sequences of HK: Gly235-Met357 (domain 3), Lys420-Ser513 (domain 5), Thr503-Ser626 (domain 6), as well as Lys420-Asp474 and His475-Lys502 (N-terminal and C-terminal regions of domain 5) and purified on a glutathione column reaching more than 90% purity. Synthesis of peptides and purification by high performance liquid chromatography to more than 95% purity were performed by Dr. J. Lambris (University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia). Refolding of cysteine-containing peptides was carried out by air oxidation for 3 days at 4 °C with continuous agitation in buffer containing 50 mmol/liter ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8.5, at a final concentration of 100 μg/ml followed by freeze drying. In addition to peptides HK406 (Gly406-Asn422), HK440 (Gly440-His455), HK475 (His475-His485), HK483 (His483-Gly497), and HK486 (Gly486-Lys502), the following scrambled peptides were used: HK483M (GHHGHKKNGKKKGNK) and HK486M (KGHKKNGKKNKGNHWGK). The properties of all peptides have been described previously (38Chavakis T. Kanse S.M. Pixley R.A. May A.E. Isordia-Salas I. Colman R.W. Preissner K.T.

Active PAI-1 and murine monoclonal antibodies 13H1 (against human VN) and 12A4 (against PAI-1) were kindly provided by Dr. P. Declerck (University of Leuven, Belgium) (41Stockmann A. Hess S.

The chromogenic substrate S-2251 was from Chromogenix (Mo¨lndal, Sweden). Thrombin, CaCl2, and ZnCl2 were from Sigma, and peroxidase-conjugated secondary anti-mouse and anti-rabbit immunoglobulins were from DAKO (Hamburg, Germany). Cultures of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) were established, characterized, and grown exactly as described previously (43Chavakis T. Kanse S.M. Yutzy B. Lijnen H.R. Preissner K.T. Blood. 1998; 91: 2305-2312Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All cell culture media were from Invitrogen. Maxisorp plates (high binding capacity; Nunc) were coated with 5 μg/ml multimeric VN (dissolved in bicarbonate buffer, pH 9.6) for 16 h at 4 °C and then blocked with 3% (w/v) BSA. Binding of 2 μg/ml PAI-1 was performed in a final volume of 50 μl of Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20, 0.3% (w/v) BSA, for 2 h at 22 °C in the absence or presence of 10 μm ZnCl2 and different competitors as indicated in the figure legends. After the incubation period and a washing step, bound PAI-1 was quantitated by anti-human PAI-1 monoclonal antibody 12A4 followed by the addition of 1:1,000 diluted peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG. The conversion of the substrate 2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline)-6-sulfonic acid (Roche) was monitored at 405 nm in a Thermomax microtiter plate reader (Molecular Devices, Menlo Park, CA). Nonspecific binding to BSA-coated wells was used as blank and was subtracted to calculate the specific binding. To test PAI-1 displacement from VN, binding of the inhibitor was performed as described above, and after unbound PAI-1 had been washed off, different competitors were incubated for 2 h in the wells, as indicated in the figure legends, followed by quantitation of bound PAI-1 as described above. The preparation of the extracellular matrix was performed exactly as described previously (43Chavakis T. Kanse S.M. Yutzy B. Lijnen H.R. Preissner K.T. Blood. 1998; 91: 2305-2312Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 44Preissner K.T. Grulich-Henn J. Ehrlich H.J. Declerck P. Justus C. Collen D. Pannekoek H. Mu¨ller-Berghaus G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18490-18498Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, HUVEC were grown to confluence in 96-well plates and washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline containing 2% (w/v) BSA and 1 mmCaCl2. Cells were removed with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.5% (w/v) Triton X-100 for 15 min followed by incubation with 0.5% (w/v) Triton X-100 and 0.1 m NH3 for another 15 min at 22 °C. PAI-1-depleted extracellular matrix was obtained by subsequent incubation with 0.1 m glycine, pH 2.3, for 2 h at 25 °C. Finally, wells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and blocked with phosphate-buffered saline containing 3% (w/v) BSA before proceeding with binding assays. The extracellular matrix was then incubated without or together with different competitors, as indicated in the figure legends, and the remaining PAI-1 was detected as described above. Binding of PAI-1 to PAI-1-depleted extracellular matrix was performed exactly as described above. 0.1–40 nm PAI-1 or buffer alone was incubated without or together with 1 μg/ml multimeric VN in the absence or presence of different competitors and for different time periods (as indicated in the figure legends) in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% (w/v) Tween 20 and 0.1% (w/v) BSA at 37 °C. After different time intervals, aliquots of reaction mixtures were transferred into microtiter wells, and uPA or tPA (concentrations indicated in the figure legends) was added. After an incubation period of 30 min at 22 °C, a mixture of 0.22 μm plasminogen (final concentration) and 0.8 mm substrate S-2251 was added, and the rate of plasmin generation was followed for 1 h at 405 nm. To examine the influence of different HK forms on tPA-dependent plasmin generation on fibrin matrices, experiments were performed according to a protocol published previously (18Podor T.J. Peterson C.B. Lawrence D.A. Stefansson S. Shaughnessy S.G. Foulon D.M. Butcher M. Weitz J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19788-19794Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In microtiter wells fibrin was generated by mixing aliquots of a 375 nm fibrinogen solution containing 0.5 μg/ml multimeric VN or buffer alone together with 30 nm thrombin and 1 mm CaCl2 in a total volume of 50 μl. After incubation for 3 h at 22 °C, the fibrin-coated plates were stored at 4 °C until use. To block nonspecific binding, phosphate-buffered saline containing 3% (w/v) BSA and 0.05% (w/v) Tween 20 (blocking buffer) was added to the wells. The fibrin-coated wells were then preincubated for 1 h at 37 °C with 0.01–100 nm PAI-1 diluted in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% (w/v) BSA, 0.1% (w/v) Tween 20 in the absence or presence of different competitors as indicated in the figure legends. After washing three times, the wells were incubated with 2.5 nm tPA, 0.54 μm plasminogen, and 1 mm S-2251 at 37 °C, and the rate of plasmin generation was followed at 405 nm. Lysis of fibrin clots was studied according to a protocol described previously based on a fluorogenic assay (45Wu J.H. Diamond S.L. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1995; 74: 711-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 46Wu J.H. Diamond S.L. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 224: 83-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Briefly, a solution of fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled fibrinogen (100 nm) and plasminogen (50 nm), diluted in a buffer containing 0.05 mTris-HCl, 0.15 m NaCl, and 5 mmCaCl2, 10 μm Zn2+, pH 7.4, was mixed with 5 nm thrombin. Fibrin clots were also formed in the presence of 1–100 nm PAI-1 and/or 1 μg/ml VN. After clots were allowed to age for 2 h at 37 °C, they were then incubated with 2.5 nm tPA or Tris-buffered saline alone at 37 °C. The extent of tPA-induced clot lysis was quantified by following the increase in fluorescence in a fluorescent plate reader (TECAN Spectrafluor, Crailsheim, Germany) compared with base-line fluorescence of clots incubated with Tris-buffered saline alone. We have demonstrated previously that PAI-1 competes with the Zn2+-dependent binding of HKa to VN, which is attributed to HK domain 5. Here, peptides derived from this domain were used to identify further the sequence epitope on HK responsible for inhibition of the PAI-1/VN interaction. Only the C-terminal portion of the domain 5, His475-Lys502 fused to GST, but not the N-terminal portion of domain 5, Lys420-Asp474 fused to GST, could reproduce the function of the whole domain 5 at 10 μm Zn2+(minimal required concentration). Two of five synthetic peptides derived from domain 5, namely HK486 (sequence Gly486-Lys502) and HK483 (sequence His483-Gly497) to a lower extent inhibited the binding of PAI-1 to VN, whereas peptides HK406 (Gly406-Asn422), HK440 (Gly440-His455), and HK475 (His475-His485) were not inhibitory. The sequence specificity of the peptides HK486 and HK483 containing a high proportion of Gly/His/Lys was proven by comparing them with the respective scrambled peptides, HK486M and HK483M, which exerted substantially reduced inhibitory activity (TableI).Table IInfluence of different HK forms on the binding of PAI-1 to immobilized VNAdditivesSpecific bindingNo Zn2+Zn2+% of controlNone100.0 ± 9.8102.7 ± 16.4HK97.3 ± 4.876.5 ± 11.4HKa64.4 ± 14.824.7 ± 13.7GST-domain 394.4 ± 1.997.5 ± 19.3GST-domain 568.4 ± 9.421.6 ± 1.3GST-Lys420-Asp474100.6 ± 16.296.0 ± 8.7GST-His475-Lys50265.3 ± 13.338.4 ± 1.7GST103.8 ± 4.499.6 ± 11.0HK40694.4 ± 13.192.3 ± 11.2HK44096.0 ± 2.393.4 ± 3.9HK475101.9 ± 6.991.5 ± 2.3HK48372.8 ± 4.249.7 ± 11.8HK48645.5 ± 5.227.6 ± 5.0The specific binding of PAI-1 to immobilized VN was carried out without or together with 10 μm Zn2+, as well as in the absence (no additives) or presence of HK, HKa, GST-domain 3, GST-domain 5, the fusion peptides GST Lys420-Asp474, GST-His475-Lys502, or GST alone (each 250 nm) or the peptides derived from HK domain 5, HK406, HK440, HK475, HK483, and HK486 (each 500 nm).

To investigate whether preformed PAI-1·VN complexes can be dissociated by different forms of HK, PAI-1 was allowed to bind to immobilized VN followed by incubation with various HK-based competitors. Consistent with the competition studies shown before, in a concentration-dependent manner, HKa domain 5 and peptide HK486 but not HK or the scrambled peptide HK486M were able to release bound PAI-1 from VN to an appreciable degree (Fig.1). Incubation of HUVEC subendothelial extracellular matrix with HKa domain 5 or the peptide HK486 resulted in partial PAI-1 dissociation from the matrix, whereas HK domain 3 or the scrambled peptide HK486M had no effect (data not shown). Finally, HKa domain 5 and the peptide HK486 also inhibited the binding of PAI-1 to PAI-1-depleted extracellular matrix (Fig.2), an effect that was comparable with the inhibition provided by the antibody 13H1 against VN, described previously to block the PAI-1/VN-interaction. These data demonstrate that the sequence Gly486-Lys502 of HK domain 5 entails an epitope that inhibits the PAI-1 binding to both isolated and endothelial extracellular matrix associated-VN and also promotes the displacement of PAI-1 from VN or the extracellular matrix.Figure 2Influence of kininogen on the binding of PAI-1 to VN in PAI-1-depleted HUVEC extracellular matrix.

Incubation of PAI-1 alone for 3 h at 37 °C results in a complete loss of inhibitory activity, a phenomenon that can be prevented by coincubation of PAI-1 with 1 μg/ml multimeric VN (data not shown and Ref. 18Podor T.J.

The VN-dependent inhibitory activity of PAI-1 was attenuated markedly in the presence of HKa, whereas HK had no effect at all, and the effect of HKa was reminiscent of the inhibition by the monoclonal antibody 13H1 against VN. Again, domain 5 and especially the peptide HK486 could duplicate the inhibitory activity of HKa (TableII and Fig.3). A 10-fold molar excess of HK forms over PAI-1 was required to inhibit almost completely VN-dependent PAI-1 antifibrinolytic activity (Fig. 3). In the absence of VN, HKa domain 5 or the peptide HK486 had no effect on activity of PAI-1. The different HK forms also did not affect the activity of uPA or tPA, respectively. Thus, the inhibition of PAI-1 function by HKa is the result of dissociation of PAI-1 from VN and thereby leads to rapid inactivation of the inhibitor.Table IIInfluence of different competitors on the activity of PAI-1PAI-1AdditivesuPA-induced plasmin formation, VmaxNo VNVNmOD/min−−8.40 ± 0.408.52 ± 0.30+−8.27 ± 0.100.81 ± 0.06+HK7.98 ± 0.100.88 ± 0.06+HKa7.96 ± 0.066.35 ± 1.01+GST-domain 38.31 ± 0.261.08 ± 0.15+GST-domain 58.43 ± 0.186.53 ± 0.45+13H18.57 ± 0.234.71 ± 1.03+HK4068.47 ± 0.290.79 ± 0.03+HK4408.43 ± 0.150.75 ± 0.02+HK4758.14 ± 0.220.86 ± 0.06+HK4838.31 ± 0.173.80 ± 0.33+HK4868.20 ± 0.075.69 ± 0.66+HK483M8.24 ± 0.061.35 ± 0.24+HK486M8.37 ± 0.111.50 ± 0.0510 nm uPA-induced plasmin formation was tested without or together with 1 μg/ml VN as well as in the absence or presence of 40 nm PAI-1 and the indicated additives HK, HKa, GST-domain 3, GST-domain 5 (each 500 nm), a monoclonal antibody against VN (13H1, 30 μg/ml), or the peptides derived from HK domain 5, HK406, HK440, HK475, HK483, HK486, or the scrambled control peptides HK483M and HK486M (each 500 nm) in a buffer containing 10 μm Zn2+.

To investigate the effects of BCR-ABL on multipotent hematopoietic cells, a temperature sensitive BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase was expressed in the cell line, FDCP-Mix. BCR-ABL mediated an increase in c-kit expression that correlated with an enhanced mitogenic response to SCF. This was not observed in the absence of Bcr-Abl kinase activity or presence of the BCR-ABL inhibitor STI571, which also inhibits c-kit. When cultured in a combination of SCF plus G-CSF the FDCP-Mix cells undergo neutrophilic differentiation over a 7-10 day period. When BCR-ABL was active there was a marked inhibition of cell maturation compared to control cells in which BCR-ABL was either inactive or not present. However, BCR-ABL did not block differentiation as the cells eventually undergo terminal maturation. These data argue that BCR-ABL is directly responsible for the enhanced response to SCF reported in CML progenitor cells. Furthermore, although the primary effect of STI571 is via direct inhibition of BCR-ABL, STI571 additionally reduces the enhanced response to SCF. Thus there are two sites of STI571 action of potential importance in Bcr-Abl expressing cells."

Activating FGFR mutations cause several craniosynostoses and dwarfism syndromes in humans. Here we show that the Xenopus homolog of mammalian FRS-2 (XFRS2) is essential for the induction of oocyte maturation by an XFGFR1 harboring an activating mutation (XFGFR1act). Using a dominant-negative form of kinase suppressor of Ras, we show the Mek activity is required for germinal vesicle breakdown (GVBD) induced by co-expression of XFGFR1act and XFRS2, but this activity is not required for progesterone-induced GVBD. Furthermore, Mek/MAPK activity is critical for the induction and/or maintenance of H1 kinase activity at metaphase of meiosis II in progesterone-treated oocytes. An activated XFGFR1 containing a mutation in the phospholipase Cγ binding site (XFGFR1actY672F) displayed a reduced ability to induce cell-cycle progression in oocytes, suggesting phospholipase Cγ may not be necessary but that it augments XFGFR signaling in this system. Oocytes co-expressing XFGFR1act and XFRS2 showed substantial H1 kinase activity, but this activity was blocked when the oocytes were treated with the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor LY294002. Although phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activity is essential for XFGFR1act/XFRS2-induced oocyte maturation, this activity is not required for maturation induced by progesterone. Finally, ectopic expression of Xspry2, a negative regulator of XFGFR signaling, greatly reduced MAPK activation and GVBD induced by the expression of either XFGFR1act plus XFRS2 or activated Ras (H-RasV12). In contrast, Xspry2 did not prevent GVBD induced by an activated form of Raf1, suggesting that Xspry2 exerts its inhibitory function upstream or parallel to Raf and downstream of Ras.

The FGF receptor signaling pathway has been extensively studied in cultured cells, whereas the role of associated signaling components during development are beginning to emerge. Targeted disruption of FGFs and FGF receptors indicates a crucial role for these polypeptides during mouse development.

For example, mutations in FGFR3 are associated with various forms of dwarfism (for review, see Ref. 24Kannan K. Givol D. IUBMB Life. 2000; 49: 197-205Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and those in the FGFR1 and FGFR2 have been associated with craniofacial and limb deformities (24Kannan K. Givol D. IUBMB Life. 2000; 49: 197-205Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the mouse system, creation of gain-of-function mutations in FGFR2 and -3 cause similar phenotypes to the human syndromes (24Kannan K.

The Xenopus embryo system has also provided valuable information regarding the role of FGFs and their receptors during development. Members of the FGF family control mesoderm production and maintenance as well as morphogenetic movements during gastrulation inXenopus embryos.

Although signal transduction by progesterone and RTKs results in the synthesis of Mos and the induction of MPF, the two pathways differ in several aspects.

Furthermore, maturation-signaling cascades induced by IGF-1, but not those induced by progesterone, require the specific involvement of p21ras, GAP, and protein kinase Cζ (60Deshpande A.K. Kung H.F.

To further investigate the signaling events elicited by an activatedXenopus FGFR1 harboring mutations identified in human dysmorphic syndromes, we expressed these activated mutant receptors inXenopus oocytes. Our results indicate that the activated receptor can induce cell-cycle progression only when co-expressed with FRS2. Furthermore, Mek activity and PI 3-kinase activity are essential for GVBD mediated by an activated XFGFR1 and XFRS2, whereas PLCγ assists but is not required for this event. Moreover, we show that the natural inducer of oocyte maturation, progesterone, does not require Mek activity or PI 3-kinase for GVBD. Finally, overexpression of Xsprouty2, a negative regulator of RTK signaling, can block GVBD and MAPK activation by the activated FGFR1 but not progesterone. This block appears to influence a point upstream or parallel to Raf and downstream of Ras. Xenopus laevisfemales were purchased from Nasco (Fort Atkinson, WI) and prepared as described previously (63Fabian J.R. Morrison D.K. Daar I.O. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 645-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). All XFGFR1 mutants were generated as previously described (30Neilson K.M. Friesel R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25049-25057Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). These mutants were inserted into SP64T3 for this study, except XFGFR1K562E was inserted in pCS2+. XFRS2 (38Akagi K. Park E-K. Mood K. Daar I.O. Dev. Dynamics. 2002; 223: 216-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) and Xspry2 cDNAs were inserted into the pCS2+ plasmid. RafY340D, DnKSR (gift from Deborah Morrison), and H-RasV12 cDNAs are inserted into the SP64T plasmid. All capped mRNA was made using the SP6 mMessage mMachine kit as specified by the manufacturer (Ambion). 18 h after oocyte isolation, microinjections were performed using the attocyte injector (ATTO Instruments, Rockville, MD) with an injection volume of 30 nl. Specific amounts of various RNAs were injected into each oocyte: XFGFR1, XFGFR1act, XFGFR1kd, and XFGFR1actY672F at 14 ng, XFRS2 RNA at 7 ng, Tpr-met RNA at 0.5 ng, H-RasV12 RNA at 2 ng, and Raf1act RNA at 7 ng. Experiments employing XFGFR1act contained the activating mutation K562E or C289R. Experiments using DnKSR RNA or Xspry2 RNA were performed by microinjection of these RNAs (14 ng/oocyte) and culturing the oocytes for 2–4 h in 50% L-15 media with 1% bovine serum albumin before the second set of RNAs was injected. The experiments involving these proteins were performed in this manner to ensure adequate translation of these proteins. Oocytes were generally scored 16–20 h later for GVBD, as evidenced by the appearance of a white spot at the animal pole. This observation was verified in many cases by manual dissection of oocytes after fixation in 8% trichloroacetic acid. Oocytes were homogenized with 10 μl per oocyte of lysis buffer (137 mmNaCl, 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 2 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40) containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, aprotinin (0.15units/ml), 20 μm leupeptin, and 0.5 μm sodium vanadate. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C followed by extraction with Freon (Sigma) at a 1:1 (vol:vol) ratio. All immunoprecipitations were conducted on 20 oocyte equivalents using the indicated antibodies (XFGFR1 mouse monoclonal) at 4 °C for 4–16 h and protein-A/G-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for one additional hour. All immunoprecipitations were washed in lysis buffer. Two oocyte equivalents were examined for direct lysate analysis. Immune complexes and lysates were resolved by SDS-PAGE and electrophoretically transferred to Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore). Blots were probed in TBST buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20) containing 5% milk. Primary antibodies were used at the following dilutions: Ras (mouse clone Ras10, Upstate Biotechnology Inc.) at 1:2000; XFRS2 at 1:1000 (rabbit polyclonal, Daar Lab); phospho-MAP kinase (mouse monoclonal, Sigma) at 1:5000; ERK2 (rabbit polyclonal, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at 1:2000; FGFR1 at 1:1000 (Hybridoma cell line 5G11, Friesel Lab); PLCγ (mouse monoclonal, Upstate Biotechnology Inc.) at 1:1000; Raf1 (rat monoclonal, Upstate Biotechnology Inc.) at 1:1000; Myc (mouse monoclonal, Upstate Biotechnology Inc.) 1:2000. The membrane was washed three times with TBST, incubated for 1 h with an appropriate secondary antibody coupled to horseradish peroxidase, washed three times with TBST, and followed by application of ECL reagents according to the manufacturer (Amersham Biosciences). Crude MPF extracts were prepared and assayed as described previously (63Fabian J.R. Morrison D.K. Daar I.O. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 645-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE (16% polyacrylamide gel), and phosphorylated histone H1 was detected by autoradiography.

The endogenous FGF receptor1 transcripts are stored as stable untranslated maternal mRNA in fully grown oocytes until translationally activated at meiotic maturation (64Robbie E.P. Peterson M. Amaya E. Musci T.J. Development. 1995; 121: 1775-1785PubMed Google Scholar). We reasoned that a signaling molecule specific to the XFGFR may be present at limiting levels in immature oocytes, since other activated RTKs can induce oocyte maturation. Thus, we expressed Xenopus FRS2 alone or with activated (XFGFR1act, wild-type (XFGFR1), and kinase-dead (XFGFR1kd) forms of the XFGFR1 in stage 6 oocytes. Injection of XFRS2 RNA (7 ng) alone or with XFGFR1kd (14 ng) had no observable effect on the oocytes (Table I), but when XFRS2 was co-injected with the activated XFGFR1 (XFGFR1act) RNA (14 ng), GVBD was initiated in 76% of oocytes (Table I, Fig.1A). Oocytes displayed the hallmark “white spot” on the animal pole, and H1 kinase assays performed on extracts from these oocytes confirmed the morphological data. H1 kinase activity is only present in extracts from oocytes co-injected with XFRS2 and XFGFR1act RNA (Fig. 1B). Western analysis demonstrates that approximately equivalent levels of the normal and mutant forms of XFGFR1 are expressed in the oocytes (Fig.1C). These results suggest that the expression of XFRS2 is sufficient to allow only activated forms of XFGFR1 to induce oocyte maturation.Table ICo-expression of XFRS2 and activated XFGFR1 induces GVBDNo. displaying GVBDNo. injectedGVBD%Uninjected01260R1act01100R1act/FRS29312376R1kd0950R1kd/FRS20950R101080R1/FRS201100Progesterone656797FRS201060Oocytes were either injected with XFGFR1act (R1act), XFGFR1kd (R1kd), XFGFR1 (R1) RNA, or coinjected with XFRS2 (FRS2) RNA.

Oocytes were later scored for GVBD by internal examination. These results represent five independent experiments. These data are in contrast to a previous study (65Browaeys-Poly E. Cailliau K. Vilain J.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 6256-6263Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) showing that expression of the Pleurodeles FGFR1 in Xenopusoocytes induces maturation upon exposure to FGF-1 and when a platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGF) extracellular domain/Pleurodeles FGFR1 fusion protein is expressed and activated by PDGF. It may be possible that the differences in results may be attributed to species (Pleurodeles or Xenopus) differences, receptor expression levels, or possibly due to an intrinsic activity difference in XFGFR1 receptors that are activated as a result of mutations found in human disorders. To explore whether an intrinsic difference between the wild-type and activated XFGFR1 exists in the oocyte system, we examined whether the wild-type or mutant Xenopus FGFR1 can induce oocyte maturation upon ligand stimulation in the absence or presence of XenopusFRS2. Oocytes were injected with RNA encoding XFGFR1 or XFGFR1act alone (14 ng) or co-injected with XFRS2 (7 ng) and either left untreated or treated with basic FGF (200 ng/ml). Oocytes co-expressing XFGFR1 and XFRS2 underwent GVBD (80%; Table II) after stimulation with bFGF, whereas the unstimulated oocytes or bFGF-stimulated oocytes that were only injected with XFGFR1 RNA or XFGFR1kd plus XFRS2 RNA did not mature (Table II). As expected, oocytes injected with XFGFR1act and XFRS2 displayed GVBD regardless of whether the oocytes were treated with bFGF (93% ± bFGF; Table II), suggesting that there is no obvious intrinsic difference between the constitutively active or ligand-activated XFGFR1 regarding induction of oocyte maturation.Table IILigand-stimulated wild-type and activated XFGFR1 display similar activitiesNo. displaying GVBDNo. injectedGVBD%Uninjected0450R10450R1/FRS20450R1/FRS2/FGF334180R1/FGF0440R1act0400R1act/FRS2404393R1act/FRS2/FGF404393R1kd/FRS2/FGF0400Oocytes were injected with the indicated RNAs and cultured in the presence or absence of bFGF as noted.

FGFR-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of FRS-2 causes activation of the Ras/MAP kinase pathway via recruitment of Grb-2, SOS, and Shp-2. It has also been recently shown that in response to FGF stimulation, FRS2 and Gab1 associate indirectly via Grb2, resulting in tyrosine phosphorylation of Gab1 and activation of the PI 3-kinase/Akt pathway (7Ong S.H.

https://openalex.org/W2022222317,"The Ras oncogene transforms cultured murine fibroblasts into malignant, focus-forming cells, whose lack of contact inhibition is evidenced by high saturation densities. In order to investigate the reversibility of Ras transformation, as well as the kinetics of Ras-induced changes, cell lines that conditionally express oncogenic Ras were constructed. Both focus formation and increased saturation density were inducible and fully reversible. In exponentially growing cells, oncogenic Ras-expression had no effect on proliferation rates, Erk phosphorylation, or the level of cyclin D1, and Ras-induction did not confer serum-independent growth. As expected, growth to high density in uninduced cells led to quiescence with a low level of cyclin D1 and no active Erk; in this setting, Ras induction prevented full downregulation of cyclin D1 and inactivation of Erk. Our results show that Ras expression to a level sufficient for transformation leads to relatively subtle effects on known downstream targets, and that the focus formation and increased saturation density growth induced by Ras is not a result of growth factor independence."

The reduction of the blue type 1 copper (T1Cu) center of NiR preparations that contained both type 1 and type 2 copper atoms, followed biphasic kinetics. In contrast, NiR that was deficient in type 2 copper (T2DNiR), followed monophasic kinetics with a second-order rate constant T2Dk = 3.06 × 106m−1s−1. In all cases the SO2O radical rather thanS2O42− was the effective reductant. The observed kinetics were compatible with a reaction mechanism in which the T1Cu of the fully loaded protein is reduced both directly by dithionite and indirectly by the type 2 Cu (T2Cu) site via intramolecular electron transfer. Reduction kinetics of the T2Cu were consistent with SO2O binding first to the T2Cu center and then transferring electrons (112 s−1) to reduce it.

Chem. 1995; 270: 27458-27474Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar) and AxNiR (8Dodd F.E. Hasnain S.S. Abraham Z.H.L. Eady R.R. Smith B.E. Acta Crystallogr. Sect.

Biol. 1998; 282: 369-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) resulted in the bound H2O (or OH−) of the type 2 center being displaced by NO2− that bound to the copper asymmetrically through both oxygen atoms. This is consistent with the extensive perturbation of the 1H and 14N features of the ENDOR spectra of the type 2 centers of AxNiR (17Howes B.D. Abraham Z.H.L. Lowe D.J. Bru¨ser T. Eady R.R. Smith B.E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3171-3177Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), andRhodopseudomonas sphaeroidies NiR (RsNiR) (18Veselov A. Olesen K. Sienkiewicz A. Shapleigh J.P. Scholes C.P. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 6095-6105Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) in the presence of NO2−. Difference copper EXAFS of AxNiR (19Strange R.W. Dodd F.E. Abraham Z.H.L.

Biol. 1995; 2: 287-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) showed an increase in the average His-copper bond length of 0.08 Å in the presence of NO2−. These changes, together with the increase in redox potential of the type 2 site with NO2− bound may trigger internal electron transfer from the type 1 center during catalysis. Comparative EXAFS, EPR, and UV-visible spectroscopy of reduced and oxidized AxNiR (20Strange R.W. Murphy L.M. Dodd F.E. Abraham Z.H.L. Eady R.R. Smith B.E. Hasnain S.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 287: 1001-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) showed that the reduced type 2 center lacked the liganded H2O molecule seen in the oxidized state, and had assumed trigonal geometry similar to that of reduced superoxide dismutase. Additionally, the competitive inhibitor azide could no longer bind to the reduced site. These data, together with crystallographic data for AcNiR showing a low occupancy of NO2− in crystals of the reduced enzyme (14Suzuki S. Furusawa H. Katoka K. Yamaguchi K. Kobayashi K. Tagawa S. Inorg. React. Mech. 2000; 2: 129-135Google Scholar), strongly suggest that NO2− does not bind to the reduced center, consistent with the observation that reduction of AxNiR with ascorbate/phenazine methosulfate in the absence of NO2− resulted in the inactivation of the enzyme. Based on these findings an ordered mechanism was proposed for AxNiR (20Strange R.W. Murphy L.M. Dodd F.E. Abraham Z.H.L. Eady R.R. Smith B.E. Hasnain S.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 287: 1001-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) in which NO2− binds to the oxidized type 2 copper center to trigger electron transfer from the reduced type 1 center. Despite the wealth of structural information for these enzymes, few detailed kinetic studies have been undertaken. The enzymes are located in the periplasmic space and a number of putative electron donors have been identified and characterized, including cytochrome 551, and the cupredoxins azurin and pseudoazurin (see Ref. 1Zumft W.G. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1997; 61: 533-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (2897) Google Scholar). In the case ofA. xylosoxidans two distinct azurins have been structurally characterized and shown to function as electron donors to AxNiR (21Dodd F.E. Hasnain S.S. Hunter W.N. Abraham Z.H.L. Debenham M. Kanzler H. Eldridge M. Eady R.R. Ambler R.P. Smith B.E. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10180-10186Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). However, we have recently shown that the kinetics of the reduced cupredoxin-dependent activity of both blue and green NiRs are unexpectedly complex (22Murphy L.M. Dodd F.E. Yousafzai F.K. Eady R.R. Hasnain S.S. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 315: 859-871Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Under pseudo first-order conditions ([cupredoxin]/[NiR] = 16), progress curves for the reactions did not follow Michalis-Menten kinetics, and depending on the system under investigation, were bi- or triphasic. The reduction kinetics for NiR reacting with artificial electron donors are also complex. An early report of the reduction of AcNiR by ascorbate (23Kashem M.A. Dunford H.B. Lui M-Y. Payne W.J. LeGall J. Biochim. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1987; 145: 563-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) showed biphasic kinetics, with only the first phase being faster in the presence of the mediator phenazine methosulfate. As part of a study to gain insight to electron flux in these systems, we report a study of the transient kinetics of the reduction of AxNiR by dithionite ion. The organism used was A. xylosoxidans subsp. xylosoxidans(NCIMB 11015). Conditions of growth harvesting and purification of AxNiR from crude extracts that had been activated by the addition of CuSO4 were as previously described (24Thorneley R.N.F. Lowe D.J. Biochem. J. 1983; 215: 393-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The type 2-deficient AxNiR (T2D NiR) was purified using similar procedures, from extracts that had not been activated by the addition of copper (19Strange R.W. Dodd F.E. Abraham Z.H.L. Gro¨ssman J.G. Bru¨ser T. Eady R.R. Smith B.E. Hasnain S.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 287-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined by the microbiuret method and the copper content was determined by inductively coupled plasma analysis carried out by Southern Science Ltd., Sussex Laboratory, Brighton, United Kingdom, Ax NiR with a specific activity of 236 μmol of NO2− reduced min−1mg−1 contained 6.3 copper atoms per trimer, whereas T2D NiR with a specific activity of 20 μmol of NO2− reduced min−1mg−1 contained 2.7 copper atoms per trimer of the enzyme. Sodium dithionite and NaCl were purchased from BDH, whereas Tris and HEPES were purchased from Sigma. All chemicals were used as supplied and solutions were prepared in Milli-Q water. Sodium dithionite solutions were prepared in oxygen-free 50 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.4, in a glove box with oxygen concentration less than 1 ppm maintained by circulation of N2 gas over BASF catalyst columns. Dithionite concentrations were determined from the absorbance at 315 nm using a molar extinction coefficient of 8043 m−1cm−1. In a typical kinetic experiment, first a concentrated stock solution of dithionite was prepared in 50 mm HEPES buffer and its ionic strength adjusted to 0.1m with NaCl. All other working solutions were then prepared by dilution of the stock solution with 50 mm HEPES buffer,I = 0.1 m (NaCl). The reduction of NiR using dithionite as a reducing agent was recorded at 595 nm by monitoring the decay of the blue color of the type 1 copper centers of the enzyme. The kinetic traces were acquired at 25 °C using a Hi-Tech SF-61 stopped-flow rapid-scan spectrophotometer (High Tech Scientific, Salisbury, Wilts., UK) in the single wavelength mode of the machine. The mixing and reaction chamber of the stopped-flow spectrophotometer was installed in an anaerobic glove box with oxygen levels less than 1 ppm. The temperature of the reaction mixture was controlled with a Techne-400 circulator (Techne (Cambridge) Ltd., Oxford, Cambridge). A pseudo first-order condition was maintained by keeping dithionite in excess over the NiR concentration. Typically, syringe A of the stopped-flow contained 11 μm NiR, whereas syringe B contained 0.3–2.2 mm dithionite solution. The rate constants were determined by fitting the kinetic traces to exponential functions using KinetAsyst-3. Sodium dithionite is widely used as a reductant in assays for nitrite reductase activity, either directly, or in the presence of the mediator methyl viologen. The major path for electron flow under these conditions is via the type 1 copper site. However, studies of mutated NiR from several sources have shown that when the type 1 center of NiR is nonfunctional (e.g. AfNiR-M150E (5Kukimoto M. Nishyama M. Murphy M.E.P. Turley S. Adman E.T. Horinuchi S. Beppu T. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5246-5252Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) or AxNiR-H139A (16Prudêncio M. Sawers G. Fairhurst S.A. Yousafzai F.K. Eady R.R. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 3430-3438Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar)), methyl viologen or dithionite can support a decreased, but significant, level of activity (5–20%) by the direct reduction of the type 2 site. Other than the determination of the apparentKm for dithionite (25Abraham Z.H.L. Lowe D.J. Smith B.E. Biochem. J. 1993; 285: 587-593Crossref Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 26Abraham Z.H.L. Smith B.E. Howes B.D. Lowe D.J. Eady R.R. Biochem. J. 1997; 324: 511-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), there has been little published work on artificial electron donors in these systems. The kinetics of reduction of AxNiR by dithionite ion were studied under the pseudo first-order conditions with [S2O42−] > [NiR] and the reaction was monitored by recording the bleaching of the blue color of NiR at 595 nm in a stopped-flow spectrophotometer. Unusual kinetics were observed because the reaction exhibited two phases (Fig.1). The initial rapid phase was associated with an amplitude of ∼10% of the total absorbance change. Although the observed rate constants of the fast and slow phases of the reaction kobs1 and kobs2, respectively, were dependent on dithionite concentration, neither constant was linearly related to [S2O42−] (Fig.2). The reduction of a number of proteins has been shown to involve a prior dissociation of dithionite to form SO2O as the effective reductant in which case a square root dependence on [S2O42−] is expected. In the present case, when kobs1 andkobs2 were plotted against the square root of [S2O42−], a linear plot was observed for kobs2 only (Fig.3). This shows that the slow step (kobs2) of the reduction process is consistent with Equation 2, where the monomeric SO2O radical of dithionite is the reacting species; KDT is the equilibrium constant for the dissociation of S2O42− to SO2O. It also shows that the fast step (kobs1) is a more complex process because although kobs1 was dependent on [S2O42−], neither plot was linear (Figs. 2 and 3).kobs2=k2KDT1/2[S2O42]1/2Equation 2 We considered the possibility that the fastkobs1 step of the reduction process involved a rapid pre-equilibration between the enzyme and S2O42− (or its monomeric SO2O radical) to form an adduct (Equation 3), followed by the rate-limiting electron transfer step, Equation 4. TheXr in these equations is S2O42− or SO2O.NiRox+Xr*→KND*NiRox·XrEquation 3 NiRox·Xr*→k*NiRr+XoxEquation 4 In this case kobs1 will follow saturation kinetics and the straight-line Equations 5 (if Xr = S2O42−) or 6 (ifXr = SO2O) apply. KNDis the equilibrium constant for formation of the NiRox·Xr adduct.1kobs1=1kKND[S2O42]+1kEquation 5 1kobs1=1kKNDKDT1/2[S2O42]1/2+1KEquation 6 The plot of 1/kobs1versus1/[S2O42−] was not linear, but the plot of 1/kobs1versus1/[S2O42−]1/2was (Fig. 4). This result indicated that the SO2O radical rather than the S2O42− species was the effective reducing agent. More importantly, it also showed that the fast phase of the reaction (kobs1) involved formation of an adduct between NiR and SO2O before electron transfer occurred.Figure 3The dependence ofkobs1 andkobs2 on the square root of the concentration of [S2 O22−] used to ascertain the nature of the effective reducing agent. The plot ofkobs2versus[S2Or2−]1/2is linear, indicating that the SO2O radical is the effective reducing agent. The slope of the line was used to calculate the value of the second-order rate constant k2 = 3.33 × 107m−1 s−1, see text for further details. Values of [SO2O] were calculated from [SO2O] =KDT1/2[S2O42−], where KDT = 1.6 × 10−9. A similar plot of kobs1 is nonlinear, seeinset, indicating a more complex mechanism.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 4The observed rate constantkobs1 follows saturation kinetics. A plot of the reciprocal of kobs1versus the reciprocal of the square root of S2O42− is linear, indicating that kobs1 follows saturating kinetics as outlined in Equations 3 and 4. The y intercept of the line gave the valueT1oxk1 = 122 s−1, whereas the slope was used to calculateT1oxKND = 5.58 × 105m−1. As a similar plot for S2O42− (rather the square root of S2O42−) is nonlinear, see inset, it indicates that the effective reducing agent is the SO2O radical rather than the dimeric species S2O42−.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The dependence of kobs1 andkobs2 on the [S2O42−], discussed above, shows that the slow phase of the reaction follows simple bimolecular kinetics, whereas the initial fast phase follows a more complicated path of saturation kinetics. It also identifies the SO2O radical as the effective reductant for both the fast and slow phases of the reaction. This finding contrasts with data for AcNiR, where kobs = a [S2O42−] + b [S2O42−]1/2, consistent with both S2O42−and the SO2O radical apparently being effective donors (23Kashem M.A. Dunford H.B. Lui M-Y. Payne W.J. LeGall J. Biochim. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1987; 145: 563-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). In the present case, our data do not fit this plot. What are the specific reactions of dithionite with AxNiR that are responsible for the observed kinetics of decay of the blue color in two different ways? Studies of the H139A mutant form of AxNiR in which the type 1 center is reduced and is no longer in redox equilibrium with the type 2 centers (16Prudêncio M. Sawers G. Fairhurst S.A. Yousafzai F.K. Eady R.R. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 3430-3438Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) because of an elevated redox potential in excess of 700 mV shows that the oxidized type 2 copper centers do not contribute to theA594. Thus, in our studies the decrease in absorbance at 595 nm observed during the two phases of the reaction is assigned to reductive reactions of the type 1 copper center only. In other words the T1Cu center is reduced in two different ways. Earlier pulse radiolysis studies of AxNiR showed that the type 1 and type 2 copper ions were in redox equilibrium and that the redox potentials of the two centers were very similar with midpoint potentials of 240 and 230 mV, respectively. If the same equilibration occurs on dithionite reduction of the enzyme then the two phases of the reduction kinetics can be explained by Scheme 1, which assumes the three active sites of the enzyme (where each site is composed of a pair of T1Cu and T2Cu centers) function independently. In this scheme, the initial reaction is the spectroscopically silent reduction of the type 2 copper center in a relatively fast step (k1), followed by even faster redox equilibrations (k4 andk5) to yield the two partially reduced redox species of the enzyme, T1Cu(II)T2Cu(I) and T1Cu(I)T2Cu(II). The formation of the latter species is responsible for the observed decrease in absorbance. This reaction sequence (k1, k4, andk5) is responsible for the fast phase of the kinetics, with k1, which is far smaller than the equilibration rate {(k4 +k5)}, being the rate-limiting step. The enzyme in the two semireduced states is then further reduced in relatively slow steps (k3 and k2, respectively) to yield the fully reduced species T1Cu(I)T2Cu(I). This reaction constitutes the slower phase of the reaction kinetics. A detailed mathematical analysis of this scheme is available as Supplementary Materials. According to Equation IVc of the Supplementary Materials,kobs1=k1[S2O42−]Equation 7 thus a plot of kobs1versus[S2O42−] should yield a linear line with slope equal to k1. However, as discussed above, this plot is nonlinear (see Fig. 2), whereas a plot of 1/kobs1versus1/[S2O42−]1/2gives a straight line, Fig. 4 and Equation 6 applies. This indicates that the SO2O radical first binds to NiR and then transfers an electron to reduce the type 2 copper center. At this point it is important to mention that in subsequent discussions, the rate constants, T1oxk1 andT1redk1, or equilibrium constants,T1oxKND andT1redKND, have the same meaning ask1 (or KND) but designate the oxidation state of the type 1 center. According to Equation 6, the y intercept of the linear line in Fig. 4 is equal to 1/k1, which gives a value ofk1 = T1oxk1 = 112 s−1 for the rate of reduction of the type 2 center. Slope of the line is equal to 1/k1T1oxKNDKDT1/2, which together with the literature value of KDT = 1.6 × 10−9m (24Thorneley R.N.F. Lowe D.J. Biochem. J. 1983; 215: 393-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), yields the value ofT1oxKND = 5.58 × 105m−1, the equilibrium constant for formation of the T1Cu(II)T2Cu(II)-SO2O adduct of the enzyme. The observed kinetics are unable to define the exact position at which SO2O binds to NiR. However, as both SO2O and NO2− are anionic species and structural analogues with angular structures; the O–S–O angle in SO2being 129° whereas the O–N–O angle in NO2− range from 120 to 130°, it is likely that SO2O binds directly to the solvent-accessible type 2 copper atom. The value of 1/T1oxKND, which in enzyme kinetics is equivalent to the Michaelis constant, Km, is equal to 1.79 × 10−6m. Surprisingly, this value is at least 20 times smaller than the apparentKm of 3.6 × 10−5m of the biological substrate NO2− of NiR determined from the steady-state kinetic studies. This difference indicates that SO2O binds to the substrate-binding site (type 2 copper) tighter than the substrate NO2−does. In this context it is important to note that the tighter binding of SO2O is obtained for the oxidized T1Cu(II)T2Cu(II) state of the enzyme, whereas the Michaelis constant of NO2− is reported for the turnover conditions of the enzyme where it may bind to a different redox state of the enzyme, see below. According to Equation VIIf of the Supplementary Materials,kobs2 of the slow phase is given by Equation 8, where KNR =k4/k5 = T1Cu(I)T2Cu(II)/T1Cu(II)T2Cu(I).kobs2=(k3+k2KNR)1+(KNR)kDT1/2[S2O42-]1/2Equation 8 This equation clearly shows that the value of {k3 + k2KNR/1 + KNR} can be evaluated from the slope of the plot of kobs1versus[S2O42−]1/2, provided the value of KDT is known. The literature value of KDT = 1.6 × 10−9m was used to derive a value of {k3 + k2KNR/1 + KNR}, which was calculated to be 5.56 × 106m−1 s−1. This value is used below to calculate the value of the second-order rate constant,k2. As discussed above, Scheme 1 successfully explains the observed kinetics, but it does not provide an answer to the important question as to why the fast phase of the reduction process (k1) should be assigned to the reduction of type 2 copper rather than type 1 copper. This question was addressed by a separate kinetic study of type 2-depleted NiR, T2DNiR. This species of AxNiR essentially lacks copper in the type 2 center and has low catalytic activity, attributed to residual occupancy of copper in the catalytic center. Small angle x-ray scattering studies have shown that T2DAxNiR is trimeric (19Strange R.W. Dodd F.E. Abraham Z.H.L. Gro¨ssman J.G. Bru¨ser T. Eady R.R. Smith B.E. Hasnain S.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 287-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) and the crystal structure of T2DAcNiR has a similar structure to enzyme with a full complement of occupied copper sites (6Adman E.T. Godden J.W. Turley S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27458-27474Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). T2DNiR reacted with S2O42− in apparently a single exponential process that corresponds to the slower reaction observed with NiR, indicating that the fast phase of the reduction kinetics is associated with the type 2 center. The dithionite dependence of the observed rate constant for T2DNiR (T2Dkobs) is consistent with Equation 9. T2Dkobs=T2Dk*KDT1/2[S2O42−*1/2Equation 9 The slope of the plot ofT2Dkobsversus[S2O42−]1/2(see Fig. 5), together with theKDT = 1.6 × 10−9 was used to calculate the value of the second-order rate constantT2Dk = 3.06 × 106m−1 s−1. If we assume that T2Dk is independent of the absence/presence and redox state(s) of type 2 copper, thenT2Dk = k3. This value and the value of 5.56 × 106m−1 s−1 calculated above for the composite rate {k3 + k2KNR/1 + KNR} enables the value of k2 to be calculated, provided the value of KNR is known. Although values ofKNR determined from pulse radiolysis studies are reported in the literature (10Inoue T. Gotowda M. Deligeer Kataoka K. Yamaguchi K. Suzuki S. Watanabe H. Gohow M. Kai Y. J. Biochem.
