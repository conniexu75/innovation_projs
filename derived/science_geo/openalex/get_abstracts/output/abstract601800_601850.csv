Ulloa Ulloa et al. present a comprehensive and integrated compilation of all known native New World vascular plant species (see the Perspective by Givnish). This compilation, in a publicly available, searchable database, includes 124,993 species—about one-third of the worldwide total. They further present details of the distribution of species across families and genera, the geographical foci of diversity, and the floristic relationships between regions. The rate of plant species discovery in the Americas averages almost 750 annually, so this valuable resource will continue to grow. Science , this issue p. 1614 ; see also p. 1535"

One approach to estimating the future impacts of climate change is to look at the effects of weather fluctuations. These transient shocks can be interpreted analytically as randomly distributed treatments applied to countries around the world. Missirian and Schlenker analyzed the relation between these localized shocks to agriculture and applications by that country's migrants for asylum in the European Union. When temperatures in the source country deviated from a moderate optimum around 20°C that is best for agriculture, asylum applications increased. Thus, the net forecast is for asylum applications to increase as global temperatures rise. Science , this issue p. 1610"

The histone methyltransferase KMT2D, a frequently aberrant epigenetic modifier in various tumors, has an undefined role in PCa. Moreover, little is known regarding KMT2D's mutation in Chinese patients or its downstream signaling pathways and targets. Here, we profiled the mutational spectrum of 32 significantly PCa-associated genes by using disease-targeted sequencing, and found that KMT2D was highly mutated (63.04%, 29/46) in Chinese patients. Moreover, high KMT2D transcription was also associated with poor prognosis in an independent cohort (n = 51). In KMT2D-knockdown PC-3 and DU145 cells, cell proliferation (P < 0.01), invasion (P < 0.001), and migration (P < 0.01) were consequently suppressed. KMT2D depletion effectively suppressed tumor growth by 92.21% in vivo. Notably, integrative analyses of RNAseq and ChIPseq characterized two crucial genes downregulated by KMT2D, leukemia inhibitory factor receptor (LIFR) and Kruppel-like factor-4 (KLF4), which are regulators in PI3K/Akt and EMT, respectively. Our present study revealed that KMT2D epigenetically activates PI3K/Akt pathway and EMT by targeting LIFR and KLF4 and thus serves as a putative epigenetic-based target for treating PCa."

Yet, there have been few quantitative assessments of the health impacts of displacement. The objective of this paper is to assess the association between displacement and healthcare access and mental health among the original residents of gentrifying neighborhoods in New York City.We used 2 data sources: 1) 2005-2014 American Community Surveys to identify gentrifying neighborhoods in New York City, and 2) 2006-2014 Statewide Planning and Research Cooperative System. Our cohort included 12,882 residents of gentrifying neighborhoods in 2006 who had records of emergency department visits or hospitalization at least once every 2 years in 2006-2014. Rates of emergency department visits and hospitalizations post-baseline were compared between residents who were displaced and those who remained.During 2006-2014, 23% were displaced. Compared with those who remained, displaced residents were more likely to make emergency department visits and experience hospitalizations, mainly due to mental health (Rate Ratio = 1.8, 95% confidence interval = 1.5, 2.2), after controlling for baseline demographics, health status, healthcare utilization, residential movement, and the neighborhood of residence in 2006.These findings suggest negative impacts of displacement on healthcare access and mental health, particularly among adults living in urban areas and with a history of frequent emergency department visits or hospitalizations."
https://openalex.org/W2777564704,"Exercise has been recommended to improve motor function in Parkinson patients, but its value in altering progression of disease is unknown. In this study, we examined the neuroprotective effects of running wheel exercise in mice. In adult wild-type mice, one week of running wheel activity led to significantly increased DJ-1 protein concentrations in muscle and plasma. In DJ-1 knockout mice, running wheel performance was much slower and Rotarod performance was reduced, suggesting that DJ-1 protein is required for normal motor activity. To see if exercise can prevent abnormal protein deposition and behavioral decline in transgenic animals expressing a mutant human form of α-synuclein in all neurons, we set up running wheels in the cages of pre-symptomatic animals at 12 months old. Activity was monitored for a 3-month period. After 3 months, motor and cognitive performance on the Rotarod and Morris Water Maze were significantly better in running animals compared to control transgenic animals with locked running wheels. Biochemical analysis revealed that running mice had significantly higher DJ-1, Hsp70 and BDNF concentrations and had significantly less α-synuclein aggregation in brain compared to control mice. By contrast, plasma concentrations of α-synuclein were significantly higher in exercising mice compared to control mice. Our results suggest that exercise may slow the progression of Parkinson’s disease by preventing abnormal protein aggregation in brain."
https://openalex.org/W2777877617,"Many mutant p53 proteins exert oncogenic gain-of-function (GOF) properties that promote cancer cell invasive growth and metastasis, yet the mechanisms mediating these functions still largely remain elusive. We show here that overexpression of the GOF mutant p53 G245D and other GOF p53 mutants enhances the invasive cell growth of p53-deficient head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) UM-SCC-1 cells both in in vitro three-dimensional culture and in an in vivo orthotopic nude mouse model of HNSCC through a novel transcription-independent mechanism. We demonstrate that the expression of the oncogenic forkhead transcription factor FOXM1 is upregulated by GOF mutant p53s. Moreover, we show that overexpression of GOF mutant p53 G245D decreases the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)-mediated phosphorylation of FOXO3a, a tumor suppressive forkhead transcription factor, leading to its cytoplasmic accumulation. This downregulation of FOXO3a’s activity, in turn, leads to de-repression of FOXM1 expression. Importantly, we show that either overexpression of FOXO3a or downregulation of FOXM1 impairs both GOF mutant p53-mediated cell invasion in vitro and pulmonary metastases of UM-SCC-1 cells in vivo. Finally, not only do oral cancer patients with p53 mutations exhibit higher levels of FOXM1 expression than patients with wild-type p53, but also HNSCC patients with TP53 mutations and high levels of FOXM1 expression have the poorest survival outcomes. Given our prior demonstration that GOF mutant p53s inhibit AMPK, our current study, establishes and demonstrates a novel transcription-independent GOF mutant p53-AMPK-FOXO3a-FOXM1 signaling cascade that plays an important role in mediating mutant p53s’ gain-of-function activities in HNSCCs."
https://openalex.org/W2780383363,"Background and aim The doctor–patient relationship has been a major focus of society. Hospitals’ efforts to improve the quality of their medical services have been to reduce the probability of doctor–patient conflicts. In this study, we aimed to determine the gap between expectations and perceptions of service quality according to patients to provide reference data for creating strategies to improve health care quality. Methods Twenty–seven hospitals in 15 provinces (municipalities directly beneath the central government) were selected for our survey; we sent out 1,589 questionnaires, of which 1,520 were collected (response rate 95.65%) and 1,303 were valid (85.72% effective recovery rate). Paired t-tests were used to analyze whether there were significant differences between patients' expectations and perceived service quality. A binary logistic regression analysis was used to determine whether there were significant differences in the gap between expectation and perception of service quality according to patients' demographic characteristics. Results There was a significant difference between the expected and perceived service quality (p < 0.05) according to patients both before and after receiving medical services. Furthermore, the service quality gap of each service dimension was negative. Specifically, the gaps in service quality were as follows: economy, responsiveness, empathy, assurance, reliability, and tangibles. Overall, we can conclude that patients’ perceptions of service quality are lower than their expectations. Conclusions According to the study results, the quality of health care services as perceived by patients was lower than expected. Hospitals should make adjustments according to the actual situation and should strive to constantly improve the quality of medical services for patients."
https://openalex.org/W2780778728,"We used a robotic exoskeleton to quantify specific patterns of abnormal upper limb motor behaviour in people who have had transient ischemic attack (TIA). A cohort of people with TIA was recruited within two weeks of symptom onset. All individuals completed a robotic-based assessment of 8 behavioural tasks related to upper limb motor and proprioceptive function, as well as cognitive function. Robotic task performance was compared to a large cohort of controls without neurological impairments corrected for the influence of age. Impairment in people with TIA was defined as performance below the 5th percentile of controls. Participants with TIA were also assessed with the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score, Chedoke-McMaster Stroke Assessment (CMSA) of the arm, the Behavioural Inattention Test (BIT), the Purdue pegboard test (PPB), and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). Age-related white matter change (ARWMC), prior infarction and cella-media index (CMI) were assessed from baseline CT scan that was performed within 24 hours of TIA. Acute infarction was assessed from diffusion-weighted imaging in a subset of people with TIA. Twenty-two people with TIA were assessed. Robotic assessment showed impaired upper limb motor function in 7/22 people with TIA patients and upper limb sensory impairment in 4/22 individuals. Cognitive tasks involving robotic assessment of the upper limb were completed in 13 participants, of whom 8 (61.5%) showed significant impairment. Abnormal performance in the CMSA arm inventory was present in 12/22 (54.5%) participants. ARWMC was 11.8 ± 6.4 and CMI was 5.4 ± 1.5. DWI was positive in 0 participants. Quantitative robotic assessment showed that people who have had a TIA display a spectrum of upper limb motor and sensory performance deficits as well as cognitive function deficits despite resolution of symptoms and no evidence of tissue infarction."
https://openalex.org/W2779304466,"In complex real-world scenes, image content is conveyed by a large collection of intertwined visual features. The visual system disentangles these features in order to extract information about image content. Here, we investigate the role of one integral component: the content of spatial frequencies in an image. Specifically, we measure the amount of image content carried by low versus high spatial frequencies for the representation of real-world scenes in scene-selective regions of human visual cortex. To this end, we attempted to decode scene categories from the brain activity patterns of participants viewing scene images that contained the full spatial frequency spectrum, only low spatial frequencies, or only high spatial frequencies, all carefully controlled for contrast and luminance. Contrary to the findings from numerous behavioral studies and computational models that have highlighted how low spatial frequencies preferentially encode image content, decoding of scene categories from the scene-selective brain regions, including the parahippocampal place area (PPA), was significantly more accurate for high than low spatial frequency images. In fact, decoding accuracy was just as high for high spatial frequency images as for images containing the full spatial frequency spectrum in scene-selective areas PPA, RSC, OPA and object selective area LOC. We also found an interesting dissociation between the posterior and anterior subdivisions of PPA: categories were decodable from both high and low spatial frequency scenes in posterior PPA but only from high spatial frequency scenes in anterior PPA; and spatial frequency was explicitly decodable from posterior but not anterior PPA. Our results are consistent with recent findings that line drawings, which consist almost entirely of high spatial frequencies, elicit a neural representation of scene categories that is equivalent to that of full-spectrum color photographs. Collectively, these findings demonstrate the importance of high spatial frequencies for conveying the content of complex real-world scenes."
https://openalex.org/W2780527730,"Vitamin D provides a significant benefit to human health, and its deficiency has been linked to a variety of diseases including cancer. Vitamin D exhibits anticancer effects perhaps through inhibition of angiogenesis. We previously showed that the active form of vitamin D (1, 25(OH)2D3; calcitriol) is a potent inhibitor of angiogenesis in mouse model of oxygen-induced ischemic retinopathy (OIR). Many of vitamin D’s actions are mediated through vitamin D receptor (VDR). However, the role VDR expression plays in vascular development and inhibition of neovascularization by 1, 25(OH)2D3 remains unknown. Here using wild type (Vdr +/+) and Vdr-deficient (Vdr -/-) mice, we determined the impact of Vdr expression on postnatal development of retinal vasculature and retinal neovascularization during OIR. We observed no significant effect on postnatal retinal vascular development in Vdr -/- mice up to postnatal day 21 (P21) compared with Vdr +/+ mice. However, we observed an increase in density of pericytes (PC) and a decrease in density of endothelial cells (EC) in P42 Vdr -/- mice compared with Vdr +/+ mice, resulting in a significant decrease in the EC/PC ratio. Although we observed no significant impact on vessel obliteration and retinal neovascularization in Vdr -/- mice compared with Vdr +/+ mice during OIR, the VDR expression was essential for inhibition of retinal neovascularization by 1, 25(OH)2D3. In addition, the adverse impact of 1, 25(OH)2D3 treatment on the mouse bodyweight was also dependent on VDR expression. Thus, VDR expression plays a significant role during retinal vascular development, especially during maturation of retinal vasculature by promoting PC quiescence and EC survival, and inhibition of ischemia-mediated retinal neovascularization by 1, 25(OH)2D3."

Among them, the ubiquitin-specific protease 36 (USP36) has been implicated in the regulation of nucleolar activity. However, its functional relevance in vivo has not yet been fully described. Here, we report the generation of an Usp36-deficient mouse model to examine the function of this enzyme. We show that Usp36 depletion is lethal in preimplantation mouse embryos, where it blocks the transition from morula to blastocyst during embryonic development. USP36 reduces the ubiquitination levels and increases the stability of the DEAH-box RNA helicase DHX33, which is critically involved in ribosomal RNA synthesis and mRNA translation. In agreement with this finding, O-propargyl-puromycin incorporation experiments, Northern blot, and electron microscopy analyses demonstrated the role of USP36 in ribosomal RNA and protein synthesis. Finally, we show that USP36 down-regulation alters cell proliferation in human cancer cells by inducing both apoptosis and cell cycle arrest, and that reducing DHX33 levels through short hairpin RNA interference has the same effect. Collectively, these results support that Usp36 is essential for cell and organism viability because of its role in ribosomal RNA processing and protein synthesis, which is mediated, at least in part, by regulating DHX33 stability.

https://openalex.org/W2777736689,"Background In previous work, we found that intensive amplitude training successfully improved micrographia in Parkinson’s disease (PD). Handwriting abnormalities in PD also express themselves in stroke duration and writing fluency. It is currently unknown whether training changes these dysgraphic features. Objective To determine the differential effects of amplitude training on various hallmarks of handwriting abnormalities in PD. Methods We randomized 38 right-handed subjects in early to mid-stage of PD into an experimental group (n = 18), receiving training focused at improving writing size during 30 minutes/day, five days/week for six weeks, and a placebo group (n = 20), receiving stretch and relaxation exercises at equal intensity. Writing skills were assessed using a touch-sensitive tablet pre- and post-training, and after a six-week retention period. Tests encompassed a transfer task, evaluating trained and untrained sequences, and an automatization task, comparing single- and dual-task handwriting. Outcome parameters were stroke duration (s), writing velocity (cm/s) and normalized jerk (i.e. fluency). Results In contrast to the reported positive effects of training on writing size, the current results showed increases in stroke duration and normalized jerk after amplitude training, which were absent in the placebo group. These increases remained after the six-week retention period. In contrast, velocity remained unchanged throughout the study. Conclusion While intensive amplitude training is beneficial to improve writing size in PD, it comes at a cost as fluency and stroke duration deteriorated after training. The findings imply that PD patients can redistribute movement priorities after training within a compromised motor system."

PLHIV with NTM disease may clinically present with one of the four symptoms consistent with tuberculosis (TB). We describe the prevalence of NTM and Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC) isolated among PLHIV who presented for HIV care and treatment.All PLHIV patients presenting for HIV care and treatment services at 22 clinical sites in Botswana were offered screening for TB and were recruited. Patients who had ≥1 TB symptom were asked to submit sputa for Xpert MTB/RIF and culture. Culture growth was identified as NTM and MTBC using the SD-Bioline TB Ag MPT64 Kit and Ziehl Neelsen microscopy. NTM and MTBC isolates underwent species identification by the Hain GenoType CM and AS line probe assays.Among 16, 259 PLHIV enrolled 3068 screened positive for at least one TB symptom. Of these, 1940 submitted ≥1 sputum specimen, 427 (22%) patients had ≥1 positive-culture result identified phenotypically for mycobacterial growth. Of these 247 and 180 patients were identified as having isolates were NTM and MTBC, respectively. Of the 247 patients identified with isolates containing NTM; 19 were later excluded as not having NTM based on additional genotypic testing. Among the remaining 408 patients 228 (56%, 95% confidence interval, 46-66%) with NTM. M. intracellulare was the most common isolated (47.8%). Other NTMs commonly associated with pulmonary disease included M. malmoense (3.9%), M. avium (2.2%), M. abscessus (0.9%) and M. kansasii (0.4%). After excluding NTM isolates that were non-speciated and M. gordonae 154 (67.5%) of the NTM isolates were potential pathogens.In the setting of HIV care and treatment, over-half (56%) of a positive sputum culture among PLHIV with TB symptoms was NTM. Though we were not able to distinguish in our study NTM disease and colonization, the study suggests culture and species identification for PLHIV presenting with TB symptoms remains important to facilitate NTM diagnosis and hasten time to appropriate treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2779019429,"Duck enteritis virus (DEV) can infect ducks, geese, and many other poultry species and leads to acute, septic and highly fatal infectious disease. Autophagy is an evolutionarily ancient pathway that plays an important role in many viral infections. We previously reported that DEV infection induces autophagy for its own benefit, but how this occurs remains unclear. In this study, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress was triggered by DEV infection, as demonstrated by the increased expression of the ER stress marker glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78) and the dilated morphology of the ER. Pathways associated with the unfolded protein response (UPR), including the PKR-like ER protein kinase (PERK) and inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1) pathways, but not the activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6) pathway, were activated in DEV-infected duck embryo fibroblast (DEF) cells. In addition, the knockdown of both PERK and IRE1 by small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) reduced the level of LC3-II and viral yields, which suggested that the PERK-eukaryotic initiation factor 2α (eIF2α) and IRE1-x-box protein1 (XBP1) pathways may contribute to DEV-induced autophagy. Collectively, these data offer new insight into the mechanisms of DEV -induced autophagy through activation of the ER stress-related UPR pathway."

During mouse corticogenesis, the progressive increase of neuron production results from a slowing down of cell-cycle progression (15Dehay C. Kennedy H. Cell-cycle control and cortical development.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2007; 8 (17514197): 438-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). To reveal the mechanism by which Otx1 affects the cortical neurogenesis, this study employed in utero electroporation to alter the expression of Otx1 in the progenitor cells of developing mouse cortex. We found that reducing Otx1 enhances the proliferation at the expense of neural differentiation. The increase in the proliferative progenitors raises the postnatal production of astrocytes. In contrast, overexpression of wildtype (WT) Otx1, but not a glioblastoma-related mutant, suppresses the cell cycle re-entry. The results demonstrate that the transcription factor OTX1 is one of the key elements regulating proliferation and differentiation of cortical progenitors. A previous study by immunofluorescence found that OTX1 appeared in the cytoplasm of VZ cells during embryonic development (11Zhang Y.A. Okada A. Lew C.H. McConnell S.K. Regulated nuclear trafficking of the homeodomain protein otx1 in cortical neurons.Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2002; 19 (11906214): 430-44610.1006/mcne.2001.1076Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). To ascertain the cellular location of this transcription factor, we isolated cytoplasm and nucleus of E13.5 cortical cells, and measured OTX1 by Western blotting. GAPDH and Lamin-B1 were, respectively, determined as markers of the cytoplasmic and nuclear fraction. A band of 31 kDa, the predicted size of OTX1, was found in the GAPDH-enriched cytoplasmic fraction. Noticeably, however, the nuclear fraction that was marked by high Lamin-B1 and low GAPDH contained a significant amount of OTX1 (Fig. 1, A and B), indicating that the transcription factor OTX1 was also present in the nucleus during early development. The specificity of the OTX1 signal measured by Western blot was validated by transfection of pCAGEN-Otx1 into Neuroblastoma N2a cells; the expected band was not detectable until the ectopic expression of Otx1 (Fig. 1C). To investigate the role of Otx1 in cortical neurogenesis, we semiquantified its expression in the embryonic cortices of mice. Cortical tissues were collected from brains at E11.5, E13.5, and E15.5 (Fig. 1, D and E), the period when the cortical progenitors undergo proliferation and generate neurons. OTX1 expression gradually increased as the development proceeded (Fig. 1, D and E). To explore the function of Otx1, we aimed to inhibit its expression by using shRNA. The efficacy of inhibition was first assessed by Western blotting in vitro. Otx1–shRNA, a construct of Otx1 interference RNA was introduced into the cortical cells prepared from E12.5 dorsal telencephalon. Compared with a scramble RNA (scr-RNA), the Otx1–shRNA reduced OTX1 expression in the primary culture (Fig. 2, A and B). Direct quantification of the inhibition in vivo was not conclusive due to the weak and varied immunofluorescent signal of endogenous OTX1 (data not shown). The RNA interference was thus tested by co-electroporating Otx1–shRNA and V5-tagged Otx1 into the embryonic brain at E13.5. The control group received scr-RNA in place of Otx1–shRNA. We analyzed the expression of V5 in the telencephalon at E15.5 by immunofluorescence. The ratio of V5 positive cells in the transfected population was much less in the cortex receiving Otx1–shRNA compared with that of scr-RNA (Fig. 2, C and D; Otx1–shRNA: 24.5 versus scr-RNA: 48.3%). The results indicate that the shRNA construct was able to inhibit the expression of Otx1. To explore whether the increase in OTX1 is essential for cortical neurogenesis, we electroporated the Otx1–shRNA along with RFP-pCAGGS into the embryonic brains at E13.5, when APs are generating the deep-layer cortical neurons. Two days after electroporation, the proliferating cells with active DNA synthesis were scored by pulse labeling with EdU that was injected 3 h before harvesting the brains. OTX1 knockdown (KD) increased the proportions of proliferating cells in the developing cortex. The E15.5 brains transfected with Otx1–shRNA had 15.8% of EdU+ cells in the germinal zone, which rose from 4.8% in the corresponding regions of control brains receiving scr-RNA (Fig. 3, A and B). The generation of upper-layer cortical neurons was similarly examined by electroporating the shRNA into E15.5 brains. Otx1 KD up-regulated the EdU+ population at E17.5 (Fig. 3, C and D). These results indicate that inhibition of OTX1 increased the number of proliferating cells that incorporated EdU during the S-phase of the cell cycle. To exclude possible off-target effects of vector-driven small interference RNA, we disrupted the fourth exon of mouse Otx1 with CRISPR/Cas9, a powerful tool for genome editing in eukaryotic cells (16Cong L. Ran F.A. Cox D. Lin S. Barretto R. Habib N. Hsu P.D. Wu X.B. Jiang W. Marraffini L.A. Zhang F.

To determine whether expression of the CRISPR/Cas9 system can achieve cleavage of the Otx1 gene, we transfected N2a cells with pX330–gOtx1 and amplified the region spanning the guide RNA sequence from the genomic DNA of N2a cells. By sequencing, we found noisy signals underneath the sequence peaks adjacent to the PAM motif (Fig. 4A). The noise represents the random indel mutations that had been introduced into the genome of N2a cells by pX330–gOtx1. In contrast, N2a cells expressing pX330 without the Otx1-targeting RNA reported a clean sequence of WT Otx1 (Fig. 4A). Furthermore, the primary culture of cortical neurons transfected with pX330–gOtx1 had a reduced level of OTX1 protein compared with that expressing pX330 (Fig. 4, B and C), suggesting that the pX330–gOtx1 was capable of inhibiting Otx1. To knock-out Otx1 in vivo, pX330–gOtx1 was electroporated into E13.5 brains. Otx1 knock-out increased the EdU+ cells in the germinal zone after 2 days of electroporation (control pX330: 6.9 versus pX330-gOtx1: 15.4%) (Fig. 4, D and E). The EdU+ population at E17.5 was also increased by the knock-out introduced at E15.5 (Fig. 4, F and G). The data suggest that the Otx1 mutation enlarged the S phase population, similar to that produced by the KD with the shRNA. An enhanced S phase may result from either a blockage of G2/M entry or an acceleration of G1-S phase transition. The G1 phase was evaluated by cyclin D1, which was synthesized in the G1 and degraded rapidly as the cell entered the S phase. We studied the expression of cyclin D1 in the embryonic brain electroporated with the Otx1–shRNA, or the scramble, in the presence of RFP–pCAGGS. In E13.5–E15.5 when peak cortical neurogenesis occurs, about half of cells in germinal compartments from the control brain expressed cyclin D1 (50.5%). On the contrary, only 13.3% of the cells with Otx1 KD were cyclin D1 positive (Fig. 5, A and B). The cyclin D1+ population was similarly reduced in the E17.5 brain, 2 days after the transfection with Otx1–shRNA (Fig. 5, C and D). The data suggests that the progenitors had a decreased entry into G1 or an increased exit to S phase when the Otx1 expression was reduced. The mitotic index (the percentage of transfected cells in mitosis) was examined by phosphorylated histone 3 (pH3), which marks the mitotic cells with condensed chromosomes. When E13.5-electroporated brains were examined at E15.5, the proportion of pH3+ cells were higher in the brain transfected with Otx1–shRNA than that with the control (control scr-RNA: 4.3 versus Otx1–shRNA 8.2%, Fig. 6, A and B). Similarly, Otx1 KD almost doubled the ratio of pH3+ cells in the germinal zone of the E17.5 brain (Fig. 6, C and D). Taken together, our results show that Otx1 KD enhanced the cell cycle progression by increasing cells in S and M phases while reducing the G1 population during cortical development. Our data are consistent with previous studies that the cortical precursors with a shortened G1 phase and a fastened G1/S transition prefer to stay in rather than to exit from the cell cycle (1Gotz M.

Pax6, Tbr2, and Tbr1 are expressed sequentially by radial glia, intermediate progenitor cells, and postmitotic neurons in developing neocortex.J.

Tbr2+ cells represent intermediate progenitor cells that have not yet exited the cell cycle. To verify the identity of the proliferative cells that were increased by the Otx1 KD, we first measured the proportions of Pax6-expressing cells at E15.5, 2 days after the electroporation. The percentage of Pax6+ cells in the Otx1–shRNA-electroporated populations was increased from that of control (Otx1–shRNA: 83.7 versus shRNA-Scr: 62%) (Fig. 7B), suggesting that Otx1 KD expands the progenitor pool in the germinal zone. Pax6+ APs asymmetrically divide to give birth to either a neuron or a basal progenitor (BP) (2Haubensak W. Attardo A. Denk W. Huttner W.B. Neurons arise in the basal neuroepithelium of the early mammalian telencephalon: A major site of neurogenesis.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 3196-320110.1073/pnas.0308600100Crossref PubMed Scopus (737) Google Scholar). Newborn BPs are characterized by Tbr2+ and Pax6+, the latter of which inherits from APs and remains to be down-regulated (18Englund C. Fink A. Lau C. Pham D. Daza R.A. Bulfone A. Kowalczyk T. Hevner R.F. Pax6, Tbr2, and Tbr1 are expressed sequentially by radial glia, intermediate progenitor cells, and postmitotic neurons in developing neocortex.J.

We observed an increase in the proportion of Pax6 and Tbr2 double positive cells in the electroporated populations compared with the control (Otx1–shRNA: 30.4 versus shRNA-Scr: 13.5%) (Fig. 7, A and C). Notably, expansion of the Tbr2+ Pax6+ population (16.9%) accounted for most of the increase in the Pax6+ cells (20.5%) at E15.5, indicating a shift toward the production of Tbr2+ precursors in the Pax6 progeny. Furthermore, the BPs with a reduced Otx1 were more likely proliferative because of the percentage of EdU+ cycling cells in the Tbr2+; transfected population was higher in the KD group than in control (Fig. 7, D and E, control: 5.1 versus KD: 15.8%). The results indicate that knocking down Otx1 favors the generation of Tbr2+ precursors rather than exiting from the mitotic cell cycle. The BPs may be held at the transit-amplifying stage by the Otx1 KD. An extension of the proliferative cell division during the period of neurogenesis will invariably reduce the number of differentiating neurons. To assess whether Otx1 regulates the cortical neurogenesis, we introduced the interference RNA into the E13.5 brains and examined the expression of Tbr1, a marker of early postmitotic neuron in the cortex (18Englund C. Fink A. Lau C. Pham D. Daza R.A. Bulfone A. Kowalczyk T. Hevner R.F. Pax6, Tbr2, and Tbr1 are expressed sequentially by radial glia, intermediate progenitor cells, and postmitotic neurons in developing neocortex.J.

Tbr1+ neurons cannot be labeled and quantified until 3 days of electroporation (data not shown). E16.5 brains transfected with Otx1–shRNA had a reduced Tbr1+ population in the emerging cortical plate (Otx1–shRNA: 2.8 versus shRNA-Scr: 17.2%) (Fig. 8, A and B). Our results establish that Otx1 KD increases the proliferative divisions at the expense of neurogenic cell divisions in the cerebral cortex. The cortical progenitors differentiate into neurons during the embryonic development, yet around the birth, they start to transform into astrocytes, the largest glial population in the mammalian brain (20Kriegstein A. Alvarez-Buylla A. The glial nature of embryonic and adult neural stem cells.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2009; 32 (19555289): 149-18410.1146/annurev.neuro.051508.135600Crossref PubMed Scopus (1631) Google Scholar). To determine the fate of the proliferative progenitors that were increased by the Otx1 KD, we traced the lineage of the cortical progenitors that had received Otx1 shRNA with Tol2 transposon. With the Tol2 transposase, a transgene flanked by Tol2 cis-sequences is integrated into the genomic DNA of the mitotic progenitor and inherited by all progeny including neurons and glial cells (21Yoshida A. Yamaguchi Y. Nonomura K. Kawakami K. Takahashi Y. Miura M. Simultaneous expression of different transgenes in neurons and glia by combining in utero electroporation with the Tol2 transposon-mediated gene transfer system.Genes Cells. 2010; 15 (20384787): 501-512PubMed Google Scholar). This method allowed the labeling of glial cells after birth by the expression of GFP or RFP (22Sato Y. Kasai T. Nakagawa S. Tanabe K. Watanabe T. Kawakami K. Takahashi Y. Stable integration and conditional expression of electroporated transgenes in chicken embryos.Dev. Biol. 2007; 305 (17362912): 616-62410.1016/j.ydbio.2007.01.043Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Otx1 shRNA or scr-RNA was introduced into the cortex by in utero electroporation in the presence of pT2K–CAGGS–EGFP and pCAGGS–T2TP. The shRNA without Tol2 cis-sequences was diluted and lost following multiple cell divisions before the progenitors produced the differentiated glial cells. Glia generation was determined at the early neonatal stage P3 when the local proliferation of glia had not fully begun (23Ge W.P. Jia J.M. Local production of astrocytes in the cerebral cortex.Neuroscience. 2016; 323 (26343293): 3-910.1016/j.neuroscience.2015.08.057Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Most GFAP-positive astrocytes appeared in the vicinity of white matter (23Ge W.P. Jia J.M. Local production of astrocytes in the cerebral cortex.Neuroscience. 2016; 323 (26343293): 3-910.1016/j.neuroscience.2015.08.057Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The percentage of progeny (GFP positive) that expressed GFAP were almost doubled in the cortex (Fig. 8, C and D), suggesting that the early inhibition of Otx1 increased the gliogenesis. Taken together, we conclude that the Otx1 KD reduced the neuron but increased glia production in the brain. The KD experiments suggest that Otx1 is essential for the embryonic progenitors to exit from the cell cycle. We sought to determine whether Otx1 overexpression is sufficient to increase the mitotic exit leading to neuron generation. Otx1-pCAGEN was transfected into mouse brains at E12.5. Brains with the ectopic expression of OTX1 were examined at E14.5 with immunofluorescence. Overexpression of Otx1 led to dramatic decreases in the proportions of G1 and S phase cells as measured by the expression of cyclin D1 and the incorporation of EdU, respectively (cyclin D1: control 19.6 versus overexpression 0.5%; EdU: control 16.7 versus overexpression 0.4%) (Fig. 9, A–D). The mitotic index as measured by pH3 staining was concurrently diminished (control 6.9 versus overexpression 0.98%) (Fig. 9, E and F). The lack of cells in G1, S, and M phases upon Otx1 overexpression imply that the progenitors may have exited from the cell cycle. Indeed, the postmitotic neurons as labeled by Tuj1 staining were increased in the Otx1 overexpression brain (control 8.8 versus overexpression 21.3%) (Fig. 9, G and H). To explore whether a transcriptional regulation is involved in Otx1 control of the cell cycle, we studied the structure of the OTX1 protein. The C terminus of the Drosophila Otd protein harbors a conservative transcriptional activation domain (24Bellipanni G. Murakami T. Weinberg E.S. Molecular dissection of Otx1 functional domains in the zebrafish embryo.J. Cell. Physiol. 2010; 222 (19890851): 286-29310.1002/jcp.21944Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Mutations in the C terminus of human OTX1 (D318H, Y319C, K320T) have been identified in astrocytoma samples isolated from different patients (http://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/cosmic). 3Please note that the JBC is not responsible for the long-term archiving and maintenance of this site or any other third party hosted site. To test whether this region is crucial to the function of OTX1, we introduced mutant Y320C, a mouse homolog of human Y319C, into the E12.5 brain by in utero electroporation (IUE). Otx1–Y320C was unable to reduce the proportion of EdU+ cells in the transfected cells the same as WT Otx1. In fact, Y320C increased EdU+ cells slightly (Fig. 9, I and J). The result indicates that the C terminus of Otx1 may participate in controlling the mitotic cycle of the cortical progenitors in vivo. Homeobox-containing transcription factors are indispensable for the development of the central nervous system. Transcription factor OTX1 is a murine homolog of the Drosophila orthodenticle (otd) gene containing a bicoid-like DNA-binding homeodomain. In the developing human brain, OTX1 expression was located in the proliferative zones of the neocortex (25Larsen K.B. Lutterodt M.C. Mollgård K. Møller M. Expression of the homeobox genes OTX2 and OTX1 in the early developing human brain.J. Histochem. Cytochem. 2010; 58 (20354145): 669-67810.1369/jhc.2010.955757Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). During murine embryonic development, increasing expression of Otx1 was observed in the ventricular cells (10Frantz G.D. Weimann J.M. Levin M.E. McConnell S.K. Otx1 and Otx2 define layers and regions in developing cerebral cortex and cerebellum.J. Neurosci. 1994; 14 (7931541): 5725-5740Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We confirmed the expression of Otx1 from E11.5 to E15.5 when the neural progenitors undergo the shifting from a self-expanding to a neuron-generating model of cell division (Fig. 1). By preventing the increase of the Otx1 expression, we found that Otx1 KD expanded the proliferative pool while shrinking the number of newborn neurons in the embryonic cortex. The proliferative progenitors increased during pregnancy cannot give rise to neurons but produces glial cells after birth. The results indicate that the altered balance of proliferation and differentiation of cortical progenitors may account for the impaired neuron generation and brain hypoplasia in Otx1 knock-out mice (12Acampora D. Mazan S. Avantaggiato V. Barone P. Tuorto F. Lallemand Y. Brûlet P. Simeone A. Epilepsy and brain abnormalities in mice lacking the Otx1 gene.Nat.

https://openalex.org/W2949873741,"The increased usage of whole-genome selection (WGS) and other molecular evaluation methods in plant breeding relies on the ability to genotype a very large number of untested individuals in each breeding cycle. Many plant breeding programs evaluate large biparental populations of homozygous individuals derived from homozygous parent inbred lines. This structure lends itself to parent-progeny imputation, which transfers the genotype scores of the parents to progeny individuals that are genotyped for a much smaller number of loci. Here we introduce a parent-progeny imputation method that infers individual genotypes from non-barcoded pooled samples of DNA of multiple individuals using a Hidden Markov Model (HMM). We demonstrate the method for pools of simulated maize double haploids (DH) from biparental populations, genotyped using a genotyping by sequencing (GBS) approach for 3,000 loci at 0.125x to 4x coverage. We observed high concordance between true and imputed marker scores and the HMM produced well-calibrated genotype probabilities that correctly reflected the uncertainty of the imputed scores. Genomic estimated breeding values (GEBV) calculated from the imputed scores closely matched GEBV calculated from the true marker scores. The within-population correlation between these sets of GEBV approached 0.95 at 1x and 4x coverage when pooling two or four individuals, respectively. Our approach can reduce the genotyping cost per individual by a factor up to the number of pooled individuals in GBS applications without the need for extra sequencing coverage, thereby enabling cost-effective large scale genotyping for applications such as WGS in plant breeding."

But none of this gave a clearly pathologic mechanism. We aimed to explore the independent relationship between serum ferritin levels and dyslipidemia. Methods We performed multivariable logistic regression analyses to estimate the odds ratios (ORs) for dyslipidemia, lipid parameters, the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) and the risk of diabetes, according to sex-specific quartiles of serum ferritin by using the data of China Health and Nutrition Survey (2009 CHNS). We used three models to estimate the strength of the correlation. The basic model (Model 1) is without adjustment and the Model 2 and Model 3 are adjusted for demographic, anthropometric, and lifestyle confounding factors. Results In both genders, the ORs for high TG level, TC level and LDL-C level increased progressively and for HDL-C decreased across the ferritin quartiles (P<0.001 for trend). After adjustment for confounding factors in different logistic regression models, the results remained unchanged. The ORs for the risk of diabetes and high HOMA-IR level in the highest quartile group of serum ferritin levels were significantly increased in Model 1, but after adjustment for lipid parameters, the ORs for the risk of diabetes was decreased from 1.91 (95% CI: 1.37–2.67; P<0.001 for trend) to 1.48 (95% CI: 1.03–2.12; P = 0.036 for trend) in men, and from 5.40 (95% CI: 3.38–8.63; P<0.001 for trend) to 1.43 (95% CI: 0.83–2.43; P = 0.498 for trend) in women, and the ORs for IR was decreased from 1.86 (95% CI: 1.57–2.20; P<0.001 for trend) to 1.25 (95% CI: 1.05–1.50; P = 0.114 for trend) in men, and from 1.93 (95% CI: 1.63–2.28; P<0.001 for trend) to 1.24 (95% CI: 1.01–1.51; P = 0.012 for trend) in women. Conclusion Our results provide evidence that serum ferritin levels are significantly associated with lipid parameters, independent of glucose metabolism disorders and components of metabolic syndrome (MetS). Thus, serum ferritin plays a key role in energy metabolism disorders and may affect glucose metabolism through lipid metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W2777693277,"Rottlerin is a natural polyphenolic compound that was initially indicated as a PKCδ inhibitor. However, it was recently revealed that it may target a number of molecules and have biological effects on various cell types and is considered as a possible agent for tumor and cell proliferative diseases. Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory cutaneous disorder with undefined etiology and is characterized by abnormal cellular proliferation, angiogenesis, and inflammation. Therefore, this paper investigates the regulatory effects of rottlerin on normal human epidermal keratinocytes (NHEKs) and imiquimod (IMQ)-induced psoriasiform (IPI) lesions. In vitro results showed that rottlerin inhibited cell proliferation in NHEKs through growth arrest and NFκB inhibition. It may also induce apoptosis in an autophagy-dependent pathway. We found that rottlerin inhibited human microvascular endothelial cells tube formation on matrigel. Rottlerin also decreased the cell senescence of keratinocytes and intracellular ROS generation, which indicated its antioxidant effect. We also showed that rottlerin affects the expression of keratinocyte proliferation biomarkers. In 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol13-acetate (TPA)-induced keratinocytes, rottlerin significantly inhibited the expression of the induced pro-inflammatory cytokines in keratinocytes. An animal experiment provided the corresponding evidence based on this evidence in vitro, by using IPI model, we found that rottlerin could relieve the psoriasiform of BALB/c mice by inhibiting keratinocyte proliferation, inflammatory cell infiltration, and vascular proliferation. In conclusion, our results suggest that rottlerin may prove useful in the development of therapeutic agents against psoriasis. However, the deep mechanism still requires further study."
https://openalex.org/W2778304168,"The Soundwatch Boater Education Program is a vessel monitoring and public education outreach program. Soundwatch has been run by The Whale Museum (TWM) during the whale watch season (May through September) in the Haro Strait Region of the Central Salish Sea since 1993. Data collection has been in a consistent manner since 1998 and is presented here. The program compiles data on vessel types and vessel interactions with marine mammals with a focus on the Southern Resident killer whale (SRKW), Orcinas orca, which was listed as endangered under the U.S. Endangered Species Act (ESA) in 2005. The primary goal of the Soundwatch program is to reduce vessel disturbance to SRKWs and other marine wildlife through the education of boaters on regional, local and federal guidelines and regulations and the systematic monitoring of vessel activities around cetaceans. Since 1998, the number of active commercial whale watching vessels has increased over time; ranging from a low of 63 in 1999, to a high of 96 in 2015. In addition, the number of vessel incidents or violation of regulations and guidelines has also increased; ranging from a low of 398 in 1998 to a high of 2621 in 2012. Soundwatch collected data on 23 incident types, some remaining the same over the 18-year data set and some changing over time. The most common incidents over the 18 years were “Within 880 m of Lime Kiln” and “Crossing the path of whales”. The numbers of people kayaking near whales also significantly increased since 2004 with the incident “kayaks spread out” with a significantly increasing trend making it difficult for whales to avoid vessels. These results suggest a need for further outreach for effective education and enforcement of whale watching guidelines and regulations in the Central Salish Sea."
https://openalex.org/W2778529615,"Background Huntington’s disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative condition caused by an expanded CAG repeat in the gene encoding huntingtin (HTT). Optimizing peripheral quantification of huntingtin throughout the course of HD is valuable not only to illuminate the natural history and pathogenesis of disease, but also to detect peripheral effects of drugs in clinical trial. Rationale We previously demonstrated that mutant HTT (mHTT) was significantly elevated in purified HD patient leukocytes compared with controls and that these levels track disease progression. Our present study investigates whether the same result can be achieved with a simpler and more scalable collection technique that is more suitable for clinical trials. Methods We collected whole blood at 133 patient visits in two sample sets and generated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Levels of mHTT, as well as N-, and C-terminal and mid-region huntingtin were measured in the PBMCs using ELISA-based Meso Scale Discovery (MSD) electrochemiluminescence immunoassay platforms, and we evaluated the relationship between different HTT species, disease stage, and brain atrophy on magnetic resonance imaging. Conclusions The assays were sensitive and accurate. We confirm our previous findings that mHTT increases with advancing disease stage in patient PBMCs, this time using a simple collection protocol and scalable assay."

Endothelial cells cultured under physiologic O2 conditions (5% O2) exhibit a reduced cytosolic Ca2+ response to stimulation. The mechanism for reduced plateau [Ca2+]i upon stimulation was due to increased sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase (SERCA)-mediated reuptake rather than changes in Ca2+ influx capacity. Agonist-stimulated phosphorylation of the SERCA regulatory protein phospholamban was increased in cells cultured under 5% O2. Elevation of cytosolic and mitochondrial [Ca2+] and cell death after prolonged ionomycin treatment, as a model of Ca2+ overload, were lower when cells were cultured long-term under 5% compared with 18% O2. This protection was abolished by cotreatment with the SERCA inhibitor cyclopiazonic acid. Taken together, these results demonstrate that culturing cells under hyperoxic conditions reduces their ability to efficiently regulate [Ca2+]i, resulting in greater sensitivity to cytotoxic stimuli.-Keeley, T. P., Siow, R. C. M., Jacob, R., Mann, G. E. Reduced SERCA activity underlies dysregulation of Ca2+ homeostasis under atmospheric O2 levels."

Notably, we have recently demonstrated that insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF1R) deficiency in mice attenuates airway hyperresponsiveness and mucus secretion after chronic house dust mite (HDM) exposure. On this basis, inbred C57BL/6 and Igf1r-deficient mice were given HDM extract to study the acute inflammatory profile and implication of Igf1r in acute asthma pathobiology. Additionally, Igf1r-deficiency was therapeutically induced in mice to evaluate the resolution of HDM-induced inflammation. Acute HDM exposure in inbred C57BL/6 mice led to a progressive increase in inflammation, airway remodeling and associated molecular indicators. Preventively-induced Igf1r-deficiency showed reduced neutrophil and eosinophil numbers in BALF and bone marrow, a significant reduction of airway remodeling and decreased levels of related markers. In addition, therapeutic targeting of Igf1r promoted the resolution of HDM-induced-inflammation. Our results demonstrate for the first time that Igf1r is important in acute asthma pathobiology and resolution of HDM-induced inflammation. Thus, IGF1R is suggested to be a promising candidate for future therapeutic approaches for the treatment and prevention of asthma."

The risk of atrial fibrillation may depend on the interaction between n-3 and n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids as both types of fatty acids are involved in the regulation of systemic inflammation.We investigated the association between dietary intake of long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (individually and in combination) and the risk of atrial fibrillation with focus on potential interaction between the two types of polyunsaturated fatty acids.The risk of atrial fibrillation in the Diet, Cancer and Health Cohort was analyzed using the pseudo-observation method to explore cumulative risks on an additive scale providing risk differences. Dietary intake of long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids was assessed by food frequency questionnaires. The main analyses were adjusted for the dietary intake of n-3 α-linolenic acid and n-6 linoleic acid to account for endogenous synthesis of long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids. Interaction was assessed as deviation from additivity of absolute association measures (risk differences).Cumulative risks in 15-year age periods were estimated in three strata of the cohort (N = 54,737). No associations between intake of n-3 or n-6 long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids and atrial fibrillation were found, neither when analyzed separately as primary exposures nor when interaction between n-3 and n-6 long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids was explored.This study suggests no association between intake of long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids and risk of atrial fibrillation."
https://openalex.org/W2780209029,"In the face of plans for increased construction of dams and reservoirs in the Mekong River Basin, it is critically important to better understand the primary-producer community of phytoplankton, especially the warm-water cyanobacteria. This is because these algae can serve as the primary source of carbon for higher trophic levels, including fishes, but can also form harmful blooms, threatening local fisheries and environmental and human health. We monitored the dynamics of three cyanobacteria-Synechococcus spp., Microcystis aeruginosa, and Dolichospermum spp.-for two years in nine large lakes and reservoirs in the Mekong River Basin. The densities of these algae were largely system-specific such that their abundance was uniquely determined within individual water bodies. However, after accounting for the system-specific effect, we found that cell densities of Synechococcus spp., M. aeruginosa, and Dolichospermum spp. varied in response to changes in photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), total nitrogen, and water level, respectively. Because both PAR and water level tend to fluctuate concordantly over a wide geographic area, Synechococcus spp., and to a lesser extent Dolichospermum spp., varied synchronously among the water bodies. Sustaining the production of pico-sized primary producers while preventing harmful algal blooms will be a key management goal for the proposed reservoirs in the Mekong Basin."
https://openalex.org/W2777341867,"Previous research has suggested that bribery is more normative in some countries than in others. To understand the underlying process, this paper examines the effects of social norm and gender on bribe-giving behavior. We argue that social norms provide information for strategic planning and impression management, and thus would impact participants’ bribe amount. Besides, males are more agentic and focus more on impression management than females. We predicted that males would defy the norm in order to win when the amount of their bribe was kept private, but would conform to the norm when it was made public. To test this hypothesis, we conducted two studies using a competitive game. In each game, we asked three participants to compete in five rounds of creative tasks, and the winner was determined by a referee’s subjective judgment of the participants’ performance on the tasks. Participants were allowed to give bribes to the referee. Bribe-giving norms were manipulated in two domains: norm level (high vs. low) and norm context (private vs. public), in order to investigate the influence of informational and affiliational needs. Studies 1 and 2 consistently showed that individuals conformed to the norm level of bribe-giving while maintaining a relative advantage for economic benefit. Study 2 found that males gave larger bribes in the private context than in the public, whereas females gave smaller bribes in both contexts. We used a latent growth curve model (LGCM) to depict the development of bribe-giving behaviors during five rounds of competition. The results showed that gender, creative performance, and norm level all influence the trajectory of bribe-giving behavior."
https://openalex.org/W2777265403,"Objective Women with high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) are at increased risk for developing cervical cancer. We examine how women with high-grade CIN perceive their own risk, and about pertinent knowledge concerning human high-risk papillomavirus (HPV), CIN and cervical cancer. Methods All patients who underwent first-time treatment of high-grade CIN (grade 2+) were followed-up at 6-months at the Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden and were invited to participate in the present study. This included completion of a questionnaire examining sociodemographic characteristics, self-perceived risk of cervical cancer without regular gynecologic follow-up, and 14 queries about HPV, CIN and cervical cancer knowledge, inter alia. Results The participation rate was 96.6%, with 479 women enrolled in this study. Over 75% were age 40 or younger, over half had completed university education. Most were married or co-living with their partner and were gainfully employed. On a scale scored from 10 (highest self-perceived risk of cervical cancer without regular gynecologic follow-up) to 1 (lowest self-perceived risk), 64% rated their risk ≥ 7; almost 30% viewed their risk ≤ 6 and 7.5% did not rate their risk. A Specific Knowledge Scale with six of the queries explained 58.3% of the total variance. Nearly 30% of the women answered four or fewer of the six queries correctly. The Specific Knowledge Scale predicted self-perceived cervical cancer risk (Odds ratio = 11.3, 95% Confidence Interval 5.6 − 22.6) after adjusting for age, income and education. Most of the women with low self-perceived cervical cancer risk did not rate their HPV-related knowledge as good. However, 32 predominantly university-educated women, with low self-perceived cervical cancer risk, considered their HPV-related knowledge good. Conclusion It is vital to effectively convey accurate information about these patients’ cervical cancer risk, needed preventive and follow-up measures, together with the relevant specific knowledge, for these women at increased risk for developing cervical cancer. Tailored programming to address these knowledge gaps is needed."
https://openalex.org/W2780390236,"Background Brain connectivity in autism spectrum disorders (ASD) has proven difficult to characterize due to the heterogeneous nature of the spectrum. Connectivity in the brain occurs in a complex, multilevel and multi-temporal manner, driving the fluctuations observed in local oxygen demand. These fluctuations can be characterized as fractals, as they auto-correlate at different time scales. In this study, we propose a model-free complexity analysis based on the fractal dimension of the rs-BOLD signal, acquired with magnetic resonance imaging. The fractal dimension can be interpreted as measure of signal complexity and connectivity. Previous studies have suggested that reduction in signal complexity can be associated with disease. Therefore, we hypothesized that a detectable difference in rs-BOLD signal complexity could be observed between ASD patients and Controls. Methods and findings Anatomical and functional data from fifty-five subjects with ASD (12.7 ± 2.4 y/o) and 55 age-matched (14.1 ± 3.1 y/o) healthy controls were accessed through the NITRC database and the ABIDE project. Subjects were scanned using a 3T GE Signa MRI and a 32-channel RF-coil. Axial FSPGR-3D images were used to prescribe rs-BOLD (TE/TR = 30/2000ms) where 300 time points were acquired. Motion correction was performed on the functional data and anatomical and functional images were aligned and spatially warped to the N27 standard brain atlas. Fractal analysis, performed on a grey matter mask, was done by estimating the Hurst exponent in the frequency domain using a power spectral density approach and refining the estimation in the time domain with de-trended fluctuation analysis and signal summation conversion methods. Voxel-wise fractal dimension (FD) was calculated for every subject in the control group and in the ASD group to create ROI-based Z-scores for the ASD patients. Voxel-wise validation of FD normality across controls was confirmed, and non-Gaussian voxels were eliminated from subsequent analysis. To maintain a 95% confidence level, only regions where Z-score values were at least 2 standard deviations away from the mean (i.e. where |Z| > 2.0) were included in the analysis. We found that the main regions, where signal complexity significantly decreased among ASD patients, were the amygdala (p = 0.001), the vermis (p = 0.02), the basal ganglia (p = 0.01) and the hippocampus (p = 0.02). No regions reported significant increase in signal complexity in this study. Our findings were correlated with ADIR and ADOS assessment tools, reporting the highest correlation with the ADOS metrics. Conclusions Brain connectivity is best modeled as a complex system. Therefore, a measure of complexity as the fractal dimension of fluctuations in brain oxygen demand and utilization could provide important information about connectivity issues in ASD. Moreover, this technique can be used in the characterization of a single subject, with respect to controls, without the need for group analysis. Our novel approach provides an ideal avenue for personalized diagnostics, thus providing unique patient specific assessment that could help in individualizing treatments."

We describe retention in care and factors associated with loss to follow-up (LTFU) among women initiated on Option B+ as part of an evaluation of the effectiveness of the national program.We conducted a retrospective cohort analysis of data abstracted from records of 2,169 women enrolled on Option B+ between January and March 2013 from a representative sample of 145 health facilities in all 24 districts of the Central region of Uganda. We defined retention as ""being alive and receiving ART at the last clinic visit"". We used Kaplan-Meier analysis to estimate retention in care and compared differences between women retained in care and those LTFU using the chi-squared test for dichotomized or categorical variables.The median follow-up time was 20.2 months (IQR 4.2-22.5). The proportion of women retained in HIV care at 6, 12 and 18 months post-ART initiation was 74.2%, 66.7% and 62.0%, respectively. Retention at 18 months varied significantly by level of health facility and ranged from 70.0% among those seen at hospitals to 56.6% among those seen at lower level health facilities. LTFU was higher among women aged less than 25 years, 59.3% compared to those aged 25 years and above, 40.7% (p = 0.02); among those attending care at lower level facilities, 44.0% compared to those attending care at hospitals, 34.1% (p = 0.01), and among those who were not tested for CD4 cell count at ART initiation, 69.4% compared to those who were tested, 30.9% (p = 0.002).Retention of women who were initiated on Option B+ during the early phases of roll-out was only moderate, and could undermine the effectiveness of the program. Identifying reasons why women drop out and designing targeted interventions for improved retention should be a priority."
https://openalex.org/W2776696608,"In this study, transplanting cotton seedlings grown in artificial substrate is considered due to recent increased interest in cotton planting labor saving approaches. The nursery methods used for growing cotton seedlings affect root growth. However, the underlying functional responses of root growth to variations in cotton seedling transplanting methods are poorly understood. We assessed the responses of cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) roots to different planting methods by conducting cotton field experiments in 2012 and 2013. A one-factor random block design was used with three replications and three different cotton planting patterns (substrate seedling transplanted cotton (SSTC), soil-cube seedling transplanted cotton (ScSTC) and directly sown cotton (DSC). The distributions and variances of the root area density (RAD) and root length density (RLD) at different cotton growing stages and several yield components were determined. Overall, the following results were observed: 1) The RAD and RLD were greatest near the plants (a horizontal distance of 0 cm) but were lower at W20 and W40 cm in the absence of film mulching than at E20 and E40 cm with film mulching. 2) The roots were confined to shallow depths (20-40 cm), and the root depths of SSTC and DSC were greater than the root depths of ScSTC. 3) Strong root growth was observed in the SSTC at the cotton flowering and boll setting stages. In addition, early onset root growth occurred in the ScSTC, and vigorous root growth occurred throughout all cotton growth stages in DSC. 4) The SSTC plants had more lateral roots with higher root biomass (RB) than the ScSTC, which resulted in higher cotton yields. However, the early onset root growth in the ScSTC resulted in greater pre-frost seed cotton (PFSC) yields. These results can be used to infer how cotton roots are distributed in soils and capture nutrients."
https://openalex.org/W2777652817,"Avian monitoring strategies are usually linked to bird singing or calling behavior. Individual availability for detection can change as a result of conspecific factors affecting bird behavior, though the magnitude of these effects is difficult to quantify. We evaluated behavioral and temporal factors affecting Northern Bobwhite (Colinus virginianus) breeding season individual availability for detection during three common survey times (3 min, 5 min, 10 min). We conducted 10-minute surveys associated with radio-collared male Northern Bobwhites on Peabody Wildlife Management Area, Kentucky, from 2010–2011. We homed to within 50 m of radio-collared males and recorded number of distinct Northern Bobwhite whistles (singing rate) per 1-minute interval, number of other males calling during the survey, minutes-since-sunrise, and day-of-season. We also recorded the number of minutes during a 10-minute survey that radio-collared male Northern Bobwhites called. We used logistic regression to estimate availability of radio-collared individuals for 3-minute, 5-minute, and 10-minute surveys. We also modeled number of minutes during 10-minute surveys that radio-collared Northern Bobwhites called, and we modeled singing rate. Individual availability for detection of radio-collared individuals during a 10-minute survey increased by 100% when at least 1 other Northern Bobwhite called during a survey (6.5% to 13.1%) and by 626% when 6 other Northern Bobwhites were calling (6.5% to 47.6%). Individual availability was 30% greater for 10-minute surveys than 5-minute surveys or 55% greater for 10-minute surveys than 3-minute surveys. Northern Bobwhite called most (2.8 ± 0.66 minutes/10-min survey) and at a greater rate (11.8 ± 1.3 calls/10-min period) when at least 5 other Northern Bobwhites called. Practitioners risk biasing population estimates low if individual availability is unaccounted for because species with low populations will not be stimulated by other calling males, are less likely to call, call less frequently, and call fewer times per minute, reducing their individual availability and likelihood to be counted on a survey even when they are present."
https://openalex.org/W2781235851,"To assess changes in the retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) and macula in subjects with cardiovascular risk factors or subclinical ischemia.Prospective and observational study.A total of 152 healthy men underwent cardiovascular examination, including quantification of subclinical atheroma plaques by artery ultrasound scans, blood analysis, and a complete ophthalmic evaluation, including spectral-domain optical coherence tomography. The variables registered in cardiovascular examination were quantification of classic major risk factors, subclinical atheroma plaques by artery ultrasound scans, and analytical records. The ophthalmic evaluation registered RNFL and macular thickness.Mean subject age was 51.27±3.71 years. The 40 subjects without classic cardiovascular risk factors did not show differences in RNFL and macular thicknesses compared with the 112 subjects with at least one risk factor (except in sector 9 that showed higher thicknesses in subjects with ≥1 risk factor). Comparison between the group of subjects with and without atheroma plaques revealed no differences in RNFL and macular thicknesses. The sub-analysis of subjects with subclinical atheroma plaques in the common carotid artery revealed a significant reduction in central macular thickness in the left eye compared with the right eye (p = 0.016), RNFL in the superior quadrant (p = 0.007), and the 11 o'clock sector (p = 0.020). Comparison between smokers and nonsmokers revealed that smokers had significant thinning of the central macular thickness (p = 0.034), the nasal RNFL quadrant (p = 0.006), and the 3 and 5 o'clock sectors (p = 0.016 and 0.009).Classic cardiovascular risk factors do not cause RNFL or macular thickness reduction, but tobacco smoking habit reduces nasal RNFL thickness. Subclinical atherosclerosis in the common carotid artery associates a reduction in central macular and nasal RNFL quadrant thicknesses in the left eye compared with the right eye."
https://openalex.org/W2776311197,"Cross-presentation of apoptotic cell associated antigens by immature dendritic cells prevents the activation of self reactive CD8 T cells. Tolerized self reactive CD8 T cells down-regulate IL-7R expression on their surface. Whether over-expression of IL-7R can reverse their fate and function has not been examined. In this paper, we showed forced expression of IL-7R in OT-I T cells by a transgene enhanced CD8 T cell mediated diabetes in the RIP-mOVA model. Although IL-7R Tg (transgenic) did not completely reverse the deletion of OT-I T cells, it provided a significant survival advantage over w.t OT-I T cells. Furthermore, IL7R Tg OT-I T cells isolated from diabetic pancreata displayed increased production of IFN-γ, higher expression of T-bet, and increased externalization of CD107a. We also found that immature DCs containing apoptotic cells expressed high levels of PDL-1 on their surface. Although IL-7R Tg did not change PD1 expression on activated OT-I cells in vivo, the transgene enabled a significantly lower number of OT-I T cells to induce diabetes in the absence of PDL-1. Our results demonstrated that forced expression of IL-7R not only improved the functionality of tolerized CD8 T cells, it also acted in synergy with PDL-1 deficiency to further promote CD8 T cell cytotoxicity to self antigens."
https://openalex.org/W2778183387,"Both veterinarians caring for dolphins in managed populations and researchers monitoring wild populations use blood-based diagnostics to monitor bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) health. Quantitative PCR (qPCR) can be used to assess cytokine transcription patterns of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). This can supplement currently available blood tests with information on immune status. Full realization of this potential requires establishment of normal ranges of cytokine gene transcription levels in bottlenose dolphins. We surveyed four dolphins over the span of seven months by serial bleeds. PBMC were stimulated with phytohaemagglutinin (1, 5, and 10 μg/mL) and concanavalin A (1 μg/mL) for 48 H in vitro. RNA from these cultures was probed by qPCR using Tursiops truncatus-specific primers (IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-1RA, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12p40, IL-13, IL-18, IFN-γ and TNF-α). Two blood samples from an additional bottlenose dolphin diagnosed with acute pulmonary disease add further perspective to the data. We observed that mitogen choice made a significant difference in the magnitude of gene transcription observed. On the other hand, most cytokines tested exhibited limited intra-animal variation. However, IL-6 and IL-12p40 differed between older and younger dolphins. Furthermore, the magnitude of mitogenic response clusters the tested cytokines into three groups. The data provide a reference for the selection of target cytokine mRNAs and their expected range of mitogen-stimulated cytokine gene transcription for future studies."

Using a series of continuous changes in the complex network topology statistics, the characteristics of regional high-end talent development efficiency system are analyzed. And the results show that the average development efficiency of high-end talent in the western region is at a low level. After 2005, the national regional high-end talent development efficiency network has both short-range relevance and long-range relevance in the evolution process. The central region plays an important intermediary role in the national regional high-end talent development system. And the western region has high clustering characteristics.

https://openalex.org/W2780873421,"Background Differential trends in mortality suggest that stillbirths may dominate neonatal mortality in the medium to long run. Brazil has made major efforts to improve data collection on health indicators at granular geographic levels, and provides an ideal environment to test this hypothesis. Our goals were to examine levels and trends in stillbirths and neonatal deaths and the extent to which the mortality burden caused by stillbirths dominates neonatal mortality at the municipality- and state-level. Methods We used data from the Brazilian Ministry of Health’s repository on births, fetal, and neonatal deaths (2010–2014) to calculate stillbirth and neonatal mortality rates for São Paulo state’s 645 municipalities. Results At the state level, 7.9 per 1000 pregnancies ended in stillbirth (fetal death >22 weeks gestation or fetal weight >500g), but this varied from 0.0 to 28.4 per 1000 across municipalities. 7.9 per 1000 live births also died within the first 28 days. 42% of municipalities had a higher stillbirth rate than neonatal mortality rate, and in 61% of areas with low neonatal mortality (<8.0 per 1000), stillbirth rates exceeded neonatal mortality rates. Conclusions This analysis suggests large variability and inequality in mortality outcomes at the sub-national level. The results also imply that stillbirth mortality may exceed neonatal mortality in Brazil and similar settings in the next few decades, which suggests a need for a shift in policy. This work further underscores the importance of continued research into causes and prevention of stillbirth."

During the proton irradiation of thorium targets, large amounts of 103Ru are generated through proton induced fission. The development of a two part chemical separation process to isolate 103Ru in high yield and purity from a proton irradiated thorium matrix on an analytical scale is described herein. The first part employed an anion exchange column to remove cationic actinide/lanthanide impurities along with the majority of the transition metal fission products. Secondly, an extraction chromatographic column utilizing diglycolamide functional groups was used to decontaminate 103Ru from the remaining impurities. This method resulted in a final radiochemical yield of 83 ± 5% of 103Ru with a purity of 99.9%.

We aimed to identify variables that prompt Canadian physicians to administer magnesium sulphate to women with pre-eclampsia.Data were used from the Canadian Perinatal Network (2005-11) of women hospitalized at <29 weeks' who were thought to be at high risk of delivery due to pre-eclampsia (using broad Canadian definition). Unadjusted analyses of relative risks were estimated directly and population attributable risk percent (PAR%) calculated to identify variables associated with magnesium sulphate use. A multivariable model was created and a generalized estimating equation was used to estimate the adjusted RR that explained magnesium sulphate use in pre-eclampsia. The adjusted PAR% was estimated by bootstrapping.Of 631 women with pre-eclampsia, 174 (30.1%) had severe pre-eclampsia, of whom 131 (75.3%) received magnesium sulphate. 457 (69.9%) women had non-severe pre-eclamspia, of whom 291 (63.7%) received magnesium sulphate. Use of magnesium sulphate among women with pre-eclampsia could be attributed to the following clinical factors (PAR%): delivery for 'adverse conditions' (48.7%), severe hypertension (21.9%), receipt of antenatal corticosteroids (20.0%), maternal transport prior to delivery (9.9%), heavy proteinuria (7.8%), and interventionist care (3.4%).Clinicians are more likely to administer magnesium sulphate for eclampsia prophylaxis in the presence of more severe maternal clinical features, in addition to concomitant antenatal corticosteroid administration, and shorter admission to delivery periods related to transport from another institution or plans for interventionist care."

In this paper, we employ information entropy to describe the uncertain degree of gene-gene links and propose a strategy for data integration of weighted networks. We use this method to integrate four existing human weighted gene association networks and construct a much larger WGAN, which includes richer biology information while still keeps high functional relevance between linked gene pairs. The new WGAN shows satisfactory performance in disease gene prediction, which suggests the reliability of our integration strategy. Compared with existing integration methods, our method takes the advantage of the inherent characteristics of the component networks and pays less attention to the biology background of the data. It can make full use of existing biological networks with low computational effort."
https://openalex.org/W2780852578,"Functional neuroimaging is widely used to examine changes in brain function associated with age, gender or neuropsychiatric conditions. FMRI (functional magnetic resonance imaging) studies employ either laboratory-designed tasks that engage the brain with abstracted and repeated stimuli, or resting state paradigms with little behavioral constraint. Recently, novel neuroimaging paradigms using naturalistic stimuli are gaining increasing attraction, as they offer an ecologically-valid condition to approximate brain function in real life. Wider application of naturalistic paradigms in exploring individual differences in brain function, however, awaits further advances in statistical methods for modeling dynamic and complex dataset. Here, we developed a novel data-driven strategy that employs group sparse representation to assess gender differences in brain responses during naturalistic emotional experience. Comparing to independent component analysis (ICA), sparse coding algorithm considers the intrinsic sparsity of neural coding and thus could be more suitable in modeling dynamic whole-brain fMRI signals. An online dictionary learning and sparse coding algorithm was applied to the aggregated fMRI signals from both groups, which was subsequently factorized into a common time series signal dictionary matrix and the associated weight coefficient matrix. Our results demonstrate that group sparse representation can effectively identify gender differences in functional brain network during natural viewing, with improved sensitivity and reliability over ICA-based method. Group sparse representation hence offers a superior data-driven strategy for examining brain function during naturalistic conditions, with great potential for clinical application in neuropsychiatric disorders."

Data (n = 348) were analyzed using descriptive statistics, Pearson's Chi-square test and Gamma correlation tests.Pharmacists had 1-4 electronic devices for personal use, mainly smartphones (84.8%; n = 295) and laptops (81.6%; n = 284). At work, pharmacists had access to a computer (89.4%; n = 311), mostly connected to the internet (83.9%; n = 292). They felt competent (very capable/capable) searching for a web page/web site on a specific subject (100%; n = 348), downloading files (99.7%; n = 347), using spreadsheets (90.2%; n = 314), searching using MeSH terms in PubMed (97.4%; n = 339) and general searching for articles in bibliographic databases (such as Medline/PubMed: 93.4%; n = 325). Pharmacists did not feel competent in using statistical analysis software (somewhat capable/incapable: 78.4%; n = 273). Most pharmacists reported that they had not received formal education to perform most of these actions except searching using MeSH terms. Access to bibliographic databases was available in Brazilian hospitals, however, most pharmacists (78.7%; n = 274) reported daily use of a non-specific search engine such as Google. This result may reflect the lack of formal knowledge and training in the use of bibliographic databases and difficulty with the English language. The need to expand knowledge about information search tools was recognized by most pharmacists in clinical practice in Brazil, especially those with less time dedicated exclusively to clinical activity (Chi-square, p = 0.006).These results will assist in defining minimal competencies for the training of pharmacists in the field of information technology to support clinical practice.

Local public sector health services provided free of charge are the main source of primary health and dental care for this population. Participants included South African adults (age 18-35) recently diagnosed with HIV who had a CD4 count >350 cells/mm3.Many participants had little to no experience with dental care, did not know which health care providers are appropriate to address oral health concerns, were not aware of available dental services, utilized home remedies to treat oral health problems, harbored many misperceptions of dental care, avoided dental services due to fear, and experienced poverty as a barrier to dental services.Our findings suggest that integration of oral healthcare into medical care may increase patient knowledge about oral health and access to care. Leveraging the relatively robust HIV infrastructure to address oral disease may also be an effective approach to reaching these participants and those living in resource poor communities generally."
https://openalex.org/W2779094038,"Background The World Health Organisation estimates disabling hearing loss to be around 5.3%, while a study of hearing impairment and auditory pathology in Limpopo, South Africa found a prevalence of nearly 9%. Although Sign Language Interpreters (SLIs) improve the communication challenges in health care, they are unaffordable for many signing Deaf people and people with disabling hearing loss. On the other hand, there are no legal provisions in place to ensure the provision of SLIs in the health sector in most countries including South Africa. To advocate for funding of such initiatives, reliable cost estimates are essential and such data is scarce. To bridge this gap, this study estimated the costs of providing such a service within a South African District health service based on estimates obtained from a pilot-project that initiated the first South African Sign Language Interpreter (SASLI) service in health-care. Methods The ingredients method was used to calculate the unit cost per SASLI-assisted visit from a provider perspective. The unit costs per SASLI-assisted visit were then used in estimating the costs of scaling up this service to the District Health Services. The average annual SASLI utilisation rate per person was calculated on Stata v.12 using the projects’ registry from 2008–2013. Sensitivity analyses were carried out to determine the effect of changing the discount rate and personnel costs. Results Average Sign Language Interpreter services’ utilisation rates increased from 1.66 to 3.58 per person per year, with a median of 2 visits, from 2008–2013. The cost per visit was US$189.38 in 2013 whilst the estimated costs of scaling up this service ranged from US$14.2million to US$76.5million in the Cape Metropole District. These cost estimates represented 2.3%-12.2% of the budget for the Western Cape District Health Services for 2013. Conclusions In the presence of Sign Language Interpreters, Deaf Sign language users utilise health care service to a similar extent as the hearing population. However, this service requires significant capital investment by government to enable access to healthcare for the Deaf."
https://openalex.org/W2780565677,"Allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) enhances coagulation via endothelial perturbation and inflammation. Role of natural anticoagulants in interactions between coagulation and inflammation as well as in acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) are not well known. The purpose of this study was to define changes in natural anticoagulants over time in association with GVHD.This prospective study included 30 patients who received grafts from siblings (n = 19) or unrelated donors (n = 11). Eight patients developed GVHD. Standard clinical assays were applied to measure natural anticoagulants, represented by protein C (PC), antithrombin (AT), protein S (PS), complex of activated PC with its inhibitor (APC-PCI) and by markers of endothelial activation: Factor VIII coagulant activity (FVIII:C) and soluble thrombomodulin (s-TM) at 6-8 time points over three months.Overall, PC, AT and FVIII:C increased in parallel after engraftment. Significant correlations between PC and FVIII:C (r = 0.64-0.82, p<0.001) and between PC and AT (r = 0.62-0.81, p<0.05) were observed at each time point. Patients with GVHD had 21% lower PC during conditioning therapy and 55% lower APC-PCI early after transplantation, as well as 37% higher values of s-TM after engraftment. The GVHD group had also increases of PC (24%), FVIII: C (28%) and AT (16%) three months after transplantation.The coordinated activation of natural anticoagulants in our longitudinal study indicates the sustained ability of adaptation to endothelial and inflammatory activation during allogenic SCT treatment. The suboptimal control of coagulation by natural anticoagulants at early stage of SCT may contribute to onset of GVHD."
https://openalex.org/W2585764814,"The sampling of scale-free networks in Molecular Biology is usually achieved by growing networks from a seed using recursive algorithms with elementary moves which include the addition and deletion of nodes and bonds. These algorithms include the Barabasi-Albert algorithm. Later algorithms, such as the Duplication-Divergence algorithm, the Sol\'e algorithm and the iSite algorithm, were inspired by biological processes underlying the evolution of protein networks, and the networks they produce differ essentially from networks grown by the Barabasi-Albert algorithm. In this paper the mean field analysis of these algorithms is reconsidered, and extended to variant and modified implementations of the algorithms. The degree sequences of scale-free networks decay according to a powerlaw distribution, namely $P(k) \sim k^{-\gamma}$, where $\gamma$ is a scaling exponent. We derive mean field expressions for $\gamma$, and test these by numerical simulations. Generally, good agreement is obtained. We also found that some algorithms do not produce scale-free networks (for example some variant Barabasi-Albert and Sol\'e networks)."

Voluntary Medical Male Circumcision (VMMC) is an effective method for HIV prevention and the World Health Organization (WHO) has recommended its expansion in 14 African countries with a high prevalence of HIV and low prevalence of male circumcision. The WHO has recently pre-qualified the PrePex device, a non-surgical male circumcision device, which reduces procedure time, can increase acceptability of VMMC, and can expand the set of potential provider cadres. The PrePex device was introduced in Zimbabwe as a way to scale-up VMMC services in the country. With the rapid scale-up of the PrePex device, as well as other similar devices, a strong surveillance system to detect adverse events (AE) is needed to monitor the safety profile of these devices. We performed a systems-based evaluation of the PrePex device AE active surveillance system in Zimbabwe.


Methods 
The evaluation was based on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Updated Guidelines for Evaluating Public Health Surveillance Systems. We adapted these guidelines to fit our local context. The evaluation incorporated the review of the standard operating procedures and surveillance system documents. Additionally, structured, in-person interviews were performed with key stakeholders who were users of the surveillance system at various levels. These key stakeholders were from the Ministry of Health, implementing partners, and health facilities in Harare.


Results 
Clients were requested to return to the facility for follow-up on days 7, 14 and 49 after placement of the device. In the event of a severe AE, a standard report was generated by the health facility and relayed to the Ministry of Health Child and Care and donor agencies through predefined channels within 24 hours of diagnosis. Clinic staff reported difficulties with the amount of documentation required to follow up with clients and to report AEs. The surveillance system’s acceptability among users interviewed was high, and users were motivated to identify all possible AEs related to this device. The surveillance system was purely paper-based and both duplicate and discrepant reporting forms between sites were identified.


Conclusion 
The PrePex AE active surveillance system was well accepted among participants in the health system. However, the amount of documentation which was required to follow-up with patients was a major barrier within the system, and might lead to decreased timeliness and quality of reporting. A passive surveillance system supported by electronic reporting would improve acceptance of the program."
https://openalex.org/W2780335606,"The aim of this study was to analyse the change in aerobic capacity from disease onset of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) over 16.2 years, and its associations with disease activity and cardiovascular risk factors. Twenty-five patients (20 f/5 m), diagnosed with RA 1995-2002 were tested at disease onset and after mean 16.2 years. Parameters measured were: sub-maximal ergometer test for aerobic capacity, functional ability, self-efficacy, ESR, CRP and DAS28. At follow-up, cardiovascular risk factors were assessed as blood lipids, glucose concentrations, waist circumference, body mass index (BMI), body composition, pulse wave analysis and carotid intima-media thickness. Aerobic capacity [median (IQR)] was 32.3 (27.9-42.1) ml O2/kg x min at disease onset, and 33.2 (28.4-38.9) at follow-up (p>0.05). Baseline aerobic capacity was associated with follow-up values of: BMI (rs = -.401, p = .047), waist circumference (rs = -.498, p = .011), peripheral pulse pressure (rs = -.415, p = .039) self-efficacy (rs = .420, p = .037) and aerobic capacity (rs = .557, p = .004). In multiple regression models adjusted for baseline aerobic capacity, disease activity at baseline and over time predicted aerobic capacity at follow-up (AUC DAS28, 0-24 months; β = -.14, p = .004). At follow-up, aerobic capacity was inversely associated with blood glucose levels (rs = -.508, p = .016), BMI (rs = -.434, p = .030), body fat% (rs = -.419, p = .037), aortic pulse pressure (rs = -.405, p = .044), resting heart rate (rs = -.424, p = .034) and self-efficacy (rs = .464, p = .020) at follow-up. We conclude that the aerobic capacity was maintained over 16 years. High baseline aerobic capacity associated with favourable measures of cardiovascular risk factors at follow-up. Higher disease activity in early stages of RA predicted lower aerobic capacity after 16.2 years."
https://openalex.org/W2776502312,"Analyses of imperfectly assessed time to event outcomes give rise to biased hazard ratio estimates. This bias is a common challenge for studies of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) because AD neuropathology can only be identified through brain autopsy and is therefore not available for most study participants. Clinical AD diagnosis, although more widely available, has imperfect sensitivity and specificity relative to AD neuropathology. In this study we present a sensitivity analysis approach using a bias-adjusted discrete proportional hazards model to quantify robustness of results to misclassification of a time to event outcome and apply this method to data from a longitudinal panel study of AD. Using data on 1,955 participants from the Adult Changes in Thought study we analyzed the association between average glucose level and AD neuropathology and conducted sensitivity analyses to explore how estimated hazard ratios varied according to AD classification accuracy. Unadjusted hazard ratios were closer to the null than estimates obtained under most scenarios for misclassification investigated. Confidence interval estimates from the unadjusted model were substantially underestimated compared to adjusted estimates. This study demonstrates the importance of exploring outcome misclassification in time to event analyses and provides an approach that can be undertaken without requiring validation data."
https://openalex.org/W2780375777,"Tomato yellow leaf curl virus (TYLCV) causes great losses in tomato production. In addition to tomato, TYLCV infects many crops or weeds as alternative hosts. These alternative hosts may serve as reservoirs for TYLCV survival and spread. Here, we tested the capability of cultivated, flue-cured tobacco to act as a reservoir host plant for TYLCV. TYLCV DNA was detected in nine flue-cured tobacco cultivars inoculated with an infectious TYLCV clone, although no visible symptoms developed on TYLCV-infected tobacco plants. The percentage of whiteflies with viral DNA increased with an increasing acquisition access period (AAP) and reached 100% after a 12 h AAP on infected tobacco plants. Using infected tobacco plants as virus resources, TYLCV was capable of being transmitted to tobacco and tomato plants by whiteflies, and typical symptoms of TYLCV infection were observed on infected tomato plants but not on infected tobacco plants. Our results suggest that flue-cured tobacco can serve as a reservoir host plant for TYLCV and may play an important role in the spread of TYLCV epidemics in China."
https://openalex.org/W2781066378,"On the basis of advanced concentration and velocity profiles above a mobile seabed, an instantaneous analytical model is derived for sediment transport in asymmetric oscillatory flow. The applied concentration profile is obtained from the classical exponential law based on mass conservation, and asymmetric velocity profile is developed following the turbulent boundary layer theory and the asymmetric wave theory. The proposed model includes two parts: the basic part that consists of erosion depth and free stream velocity, and can be simplified to the total Shields parameter power 3/2 in accordance with the classical empirical models, and the extra vital part that consists of phase-lead, boundary layer thickness and erosion depth. The effects of suspended sediment, phase-lag and asymmetric boundary layer development are considered particularly in the model. The observed instantaneous transport rate proportional to different velocity exponents due to phase-lag is unified and summarised by the proposed model. Both instantaneous and half period empirical formulas are compared with the developed model, using extensive data on a wide range of flow and sediment conditions. The synchronous variation in instantaneous transport rate with free stream velocity and its decrement caused by increased sediment size are predicted correctly. Net transport rates, especially offshore transport rates with large phase-lag under velocity skewed flows, which existing instantaneous type formulas failed to predict, are predicted correctly in both direction and magnitude by the proposed model. Net sediment transport rates are affected not only by suspended sediment and phase-lag, but also by the boundary layer difference between onshore and offshore."
