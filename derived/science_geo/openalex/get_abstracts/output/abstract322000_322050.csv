https://openalex.org/W2024499680,"The planetary radio astronomy experiment on board the Voyager spacecraft has detected bursts of nonthermal radio noise from Saturn occurring near 200 kilohertz, with a peak flux density comparable to higher frequency Jovian emissions. The radiation is right-hand polarized and is most likely emitted in the extraordinary magnetoionic mode from Saturn's northern hemisphere. Modulation that is consistent with a planetary rotation period of 10 hours 39.9 minutes is apparent in the data."

The WARF-derived positions for Anita agreed to within +/- 19 kilometers of the coincident temporal positions along the National Hurricane Center's smooth track. Hurricane Anita passed near the open ocean-moored buoy EB-71 of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and measurements of wind direction, wind speed, and significant wave height made during this period at the WARF and in situ at the buoy showed agreement of 7 degrees , 0.4 meter per second, and 0.5 meter, respectively. The WARF estimates of longshore coastal surface currents showed good agreement with measurements made at a moored current meter."

These compounds are metabolized during embryonic development, as shown by differential acid hydrolysis and experiments with phosphorus-33-labeled phosphoric acid. Further, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy indicates phosphonic acid involvement in related snail families, including the schistosomal vector Biomphalaria glabrata."

https://openalex.org/W1979116117,"The performance of the 20 materials research laboratories (MRL's) at universities funded with institutional grants by the National Science Foundation, Department of Energy, and National Aeronautics and Space Administration is evaluated in comparison with 15 other universities (non-MRL's) receiving individually funded projects for materials research. Performance is measured by peer review and citation frequency analysis of publications, subjective evaluation of research achievements and researcher reputation by a panel of experts, review of equipment purchases and utilization, and analysis of administrative costs. The study concludes that there are no significant differences between the MRL's and non-MRL's with respect to innovation, interdisciplinarity, utilization of specialized equipment, concentration of funding, rate of turnover, duration of research areas, and level of effort per research paper. The MRL's have a greater number of major achievements and attract researchers with higher reputations. The MRL's tend to emphasize experimental work, and in about 70 percent of the materials research areas sponsored by the National Science Foundation there is no overlap between the two groups. Institutional grants involve much less total (federal plus university) administrative cost per grant dollar than project grants."

https://openalex.org/W1996700672,"The new program to commercialize synthetic fuels has already committed $5 billion to DOE even though it lacks a clear direction and top management for the Synthetic Fuels Corporation (SFC). Political differences have disqualified many candidates having appropriate technical and business experience. Interim planning by DOE involves a broad-based support of all proposals from the private sector that will produce synthetic fuel and that can demonstrate commercial and technical viability. The definition of synthetic fuel has been broadened to include alternative naturally-occurring fuels which are difficult or costly to produce. DOE programs have covered unconventional gas, heavy oil, and what critics call an unwarranted focus on alcohol fuels. Other projects are developing coal liquefaction and gasification. Once the SFC program is launched, it will separate itself from DOE and concentrate its support on truly synthetic fuels. (DCK)"
