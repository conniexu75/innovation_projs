https://openalex.org/W3186956315,"Coronavirus 3′-to-5′ exoribonuclease (ExoN), residing in the nonstructural protein (nsp) 10–nsp14 complex, boosts replication fidelity by proofreading RNA synthesis and is critical for the virus life cycle. ExoN also recognizes and excises nucleotide analog inhibitors incorporated into the nascent RNA, undermining the effectiveness of nucleotide analog–based antivirals. Here we present cryo–electron microscopy structures of both wild-type and mutant severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) nsp10-nsp14 in complex with an RNA substrate bearing a 3′-end mismatch at resolutions ranging from 2.5 to 3.9 angstroms. The structures reveal the molecular determinants of ExoN substrate specificity and offer insight into the molecular mechanisms of mismatch correction during coronavirus RNA synthesis. Our findings provide guidance for rational design of improved anticoronavirus therapies."

We used human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived cerebral organoids expressing tau-V337M and isogenic corrected controls to discover early alterations because of the mutation that precede neurodegeneration. At 2 months, mutant organoids show upregulated expression of MAPT, glutamatergic signaling pathways, and regulators, including the RNA-binding protein ELAVL4, and increased stress granules. Over the following 4 months, mutant organoids accumulate splicing changes, disruption of autophagy function, and build-up of tau and P-tau-S396. By 6 months, tau-V337M organoids show specific loss of glutamatergic neurons as seen in individuals with FTD. Mutant neurons are susceptible to glutamate toxicity, which can be rescued pharmacologically by the PIKFYVE kinase inhibitor apilimod. Our results demonstrate a sequence of events that precede neurodegeneration, revealing molecular pathways associated with glutamate signaling as potential targets for therapeutic intervention in FTD.

Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) encompasses a spectrum of disorders accounting for 5%–6% of all dementias and 20% of cases under the age of 65 (Bird et al., 2003Bird T. Knopman D. VanSwieten J. Rosso S. Feldman H. Tanabe H. Graff-Raford N. Geschwind D. Verpillat P. Hutton M. Epidemiology and genetics of frontotemporal dementia/Pick’s disease.Ann.

Rep. 2016; 16: 107Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). FTD is heritable, with around 50% of cases having a family history, 10%–20% of which show autosomal dominant inheritance because of mutations in the microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT) gene (FTD-tau) (Benussi et al., 2015Benussi A.

Pathologic studies reveal accumulation of filamentous, hyperphosphorylated tau protein (P-tau) in cerebral cortical and hippocampal neurons and glia, and tau redistribution from axons to the somatodendritic compartment. These changes correlate with degeneration of synapses and neuronal loss in frontal and temporal cortices (Bodea et al., 2016Bodea L.G. Eckert A. Ittner L.M. Piguet O. Götz J.

There is great need to identify molecular changes and disease biomarkers that precede cell death when therapeutic intervention will likely have the most effect. MAPT is alternatively spliced, resulting in two major isoforms, 3R and 4R tau, defined by exclusion or inclusion of exon 10, respectively. To date, 111 unique MAPT variants have been identified (https://www.alzforum.org/mutations/mapt), of which 35 pathogenic mutations are outside exon 10. This is important because little 4R tau is expressed in induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived models without a splice-site mutation (Iovino et al., 2015Iovino M. Agathou S. González-Rueda A.

In iPSC-derived induced neurons, tau-V337M disrupts neuronal activity regulation and excitability (Sohn et al., 2019Sohn P.D. Huang C.T.L. Yan R. Fan L. Tracy T.E. Camargo C.M. Montgomery K.M.

Brain organoids derived from iPSCs develop in culture along a trajectory mimicking key features of fetal brain development and can be patterned toward specific brain regions affected in tauopathy (Camp et al., 2015Camp J.G.

Increasing evidence showing that early alterations in brain development contribute to later manifestation of neurodegenerative diseases (Faravelli et al., 2020Faravelli I. Costamagna G. Tamanini S. Corti S. Back to the origins: Human brain organoids to investigate neurodegeneration.Brain Res. 2020; 1727: 146561Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar) further encourages use of iPSC-based organoid systems to study FTD-tau. Here we report characterization of over 6,000 cerebral organoids derived from three tau-V337M mutation carriers and respective isogenic CRISPR-corrected lines (Karch et al., 2019Karch C.M. Kao A.W. Karydas A. Onanuga K. Martinez R. Argouarch A. Wang C. Huang C. Sohn P.D.

We show that tau-V337M organoids exhibit earlier expression of glutamatergic signaling pathways and synaptic genes, progressive accumulation of total and phosphorylated tau (P-tau S396), alteration of autophagy and lysosomal proteins, formation of stress granules, and widespread changes in splicing with later selective death of glutamatergic neurons. Finally, we demonstrate that glutamate-induced cell death in these organoids can be pharmacologically blocked by apilimod treatment, predicted to target autophagy-lysosomal function and glutamate receptor recycling through PIKFYVE kinase inhibition (Cai et al., 2016Cai X. Xu Y. Cheung A.K. Tomlinson R.C. Alcázar-Román A. Murphy L. Billich A. Zhang B. Feng Y.

FTD-tau is associated with glutamatergic neuronal loss in frontal and temporal cortices (Benussi et al., 2019Benussi A. Alberici A. Buratti E. Ghidoni R. Gardoni F. Di Luca M. Padovani A. Borroni B.

To determine whether this is recapitulated in cerebral tau-V337M organoids, we assessed changes in the proportions of different neural cell types over 6 months of differentiation. Tau-V337M iPSC lines derived from three donors and corresponding isogenic corrected (V337V) controls, totaling seven lines (Table S1; Karch et al., 2019Karch C.M. Kao A.W. Karydas A. Onanuga K.

Methods. 2019; 16: 75-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) and assessed at 2, 4, and 6 months using multiple phenotypic assays (Figure 1A). We performed bulk RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) on 239 individual organoids and single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) on 339 individual organoids (>370,000 cells, ∼800–1,000 cells per organoid). Oligonucleotide-tagged antibodies against cell surface markers (cell hashing) (Stoeckius et al., 2018Stoeckius M. Zheng S. Houck-Loomis B. Hao S. Yeung B.Z. Mauck 3rd, W.M. Smibert P. Satija R. Cell Hashing with barcoded antibodies enables multiplexing and doublet detection for single cell genomics.Genome Biol. 2018; 19: 224Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) barcoded organoid samples prior to multiplex sequencing to reveal replicable effects. Following scRNA-seq data normalization, reduction, and clustering, automated annotation with SingleR (Aran et al., 2019Aran D. Looney A.P. Liu L. Wu E. Fong V. Hsu A. Chak S. Naikawadi R.P. Wolters P.J. Abate A.R. et al.Reference-based analysis of lung single-cell sequencing reveals a transitional profibrotic macrophage.Nat.

Transcriptional signatures in the human frontal cortex at this age correlate highly with gene expression profiles of organoids (Qian et al., 2016Qian X. Nguyen H.N. Song M.M. Hadiono C. Ogden S.C.

Organoid development followed the expected temporal changes (Lancaster et al., 2013Lancaster M.A. Renner M. Martin C.A. Wenzel D. Bicknell L.S. Hurles M.E. Homfray T. Penninger J.M. Jackson A.P.

Methods. 2019; 16: 75-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar; Figures 1B–1D; Figure S1A). At 2 months, all organoids had a similar cell composition with a large proportion of deep-layer excitatory (ExDp2) neurons (Figures 1B and 1C). Over time, the proportion of upper cortical layer-enriched (ExM-U) neurons increased, as did inhibitory neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes (all p < 2.2 × 10−16; Figures 1B–1D). Although all lines showed the same overall maturation pattern, variability between lines and individual organoids increased over time (Figures 1C and 1D; Figure S1A), indicating donor and clonal effects on long-term maturation. There was no batch-specific effect on differentiation over three replicates assessed by uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) (Figure S1B) and no clustering because of mutation at 2 or 4 months (Figure S1C). Immunostaining of organoid sections confirmed the progressive maturation of organoids observed by scRNA-seq (Figure 1E; Figures S1D and S1E). We examined whether tau-V337M affects excitatory neuron survival, as observed in the FTD brain (Benussi et al., 2019Benussi A. Alberici A. Buratti E. Ghidoni R. Gardoni F. Di Luca M. Padovani A. Borroni B. Toward a glutamate hypothesis of frontotemporal dementia.Front. Neurosci. 2019; 13: 304Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Although there were no differences in neuronal proportions at 2 or 4 months, there was a significant reduction in excitatory neurons in deep-layer (ExDp2, p = 0.004), maturing (ExM, p = 0.003), and newborn (ExN, p = 0.0001) categories in 6-month tau-V337M organoids relative to V337V (Figure 2A). These differences were validated by immunohistochemistry (IHC) analysis, which showed a reduction in neuronal nuclear protein+ (NeuN+) neurons at 4 and 6 months (Figures 2B and 2C) and in MAP2+ neurons at 6 months (Figures S2A and S2B). In contrast, there was no effect on interneuron or astrocyte numbers (Figure S2C). Differential gene expression and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) of tau-V337M-enriched astrocyte clusters in scRNA-seq data revealed upregulation of interleukin-6 (IL-6) signaling (Z score = 0.54–1.46, p = 2.26 × 10−1–1.8 – 10−2), interleukin-8 (IL-8) signaling (Z score = 0.67–1.28, p = 5.73 × 10−4–9.64 × 10−5) and neuroinflammation signaling (Z score = 0.13–3.0, p = 2 × 10−1–2.6 × 10−3) pathways across all three isogenic pairs at 4–6 months, suggesting increased neuroinflammation in mutant organoids (Figures S2D–S2F). These results demonstrate that tau-V337M cerebral organoids recapitulate aspects of the selective excitatory neuron vulnerability and glial inflammatory response observed in the human tauopathy brain (Benussi et al., 2019Benussi A.

To examine whether the tau-V337M mutation was associated with early disruption of this pathway (Figure 2D), we used electron microscopy (EM) to visualize morphological features of ALP vesicles in 2-month organoids (Figures 2E and 2F). Lysosome-related multi-membrane lamellar bodies were rare in healthy neurons (Figure 2E) but more frequent in tau-V337M neurons, including those showing early signs of apoptosis (Figure 2F), suggesting ALP dysfunction. The key ALP markers LAMP1 and CTSD were increased significantly in tau-V337M organoids compared with isogenic controls at 2 months (Figures 2G and 2I), indicating alterations in lysosomal degradation and proteolytic cleavage of pro-CTSD. High-molecular-weight (HMW) ubiquitinated species were increased significantly in tau-V337M organoids at 2 months, suggesting disrupted degradation and accumulation of poly-ubiquitinated proteins and, thus, increased proteostasis stress in mutant organoids. In contrast, pro-CTSD was increased significantly at 6 months in the absence of increased active CTSD, whereas sequestosome 1 (p62) and microtubule-associated protein 1A/1B-light chain 3 (LC3-II) were reduced significantly at the same time point (Figures 2H and 2I), suggesting defects in proteolytic cleavage and activity. IHC of 2-month cerebral organoids revealed LAMP1 and p62 primarily in neurons, similar to the staining pattern in the brain from an adult individual, indicating that the predominant ALP dysfunction is neuronal (Figures S3A and S3B), consistent with increased lamellar bodies observed in neurons by EM (Figures 2E and 2F). Notably, we did not observe significant dysregulation of ALP in our transcriptomics data, indicating dysfunction at the protein level. These findings demonstrate that iPSC-tau-V337M organoids phenocopy aspects of ALP dysfunction seen in the FTD brain, which may be triggered by expression of mutant tau protein in neurons early in disease development. Because tau accumulation is a key hallmark of FTD-tau, we examined this in mutant organoids over time. Tau-V337M organoids showed no genotype-dependent differences at 2 months (Figure 2J), but a significant increase in total tau and the P-tau S396/total tau ratio emerged between 4 and 6 months compared with isogenic controls (Figures 2J–2L). The increased tau burden with age mirrors prior observations in 2D iPSC-derived neuronal models (Ehrlich et al., 2015Ehrlich M. Hallmann A.L. Reinhardt P. Araúzo-Bravo M.J. Korr S. Röpke A.

NAD+ is an important metabolite that regulates diverse cellular pathways by acting as a cofactor for redox reactions, as well as a substrate for enzymes such as poly(ADP-ribosyl) transferases (PARPs) and sirtuins (Chiarugi et al., 2012Chiarugi A. Dölle C. Felici R. Ziegler M. The NAD metabolome--a key determinant of cancer cell biology.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2012; 12: 741-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). Unlike in redox reactions where NAD+ is converted to its reduced form (NADH), PARPs consume NAD+ by cleaving the ADP-ribose (ADPR) moiety and covalently attaching it to amino acids in specific substrate proteins. PARPs are the major consumers of NAD+ in the cell and their activity is dependent on the cell’s ability to replenish NAD+. NAD+ can be re-synthesized from nicotinamide (NAM), a byproduct of ADP-ribosylation (ADPRylation) reactions, through a salvage pathway. The final step in the synthesis of NAD+ in this pathway is mediated by nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyl transferases (NMNATs) that have distinct subcellular localizations, expression levels, and functions (Mori et al., 2014Mori V.

NMNAT-1 is nuclear, whereas NMNAT-2 is associated with the Golgi and acts in the cytoplasm (Berger et al., 2005Berger F. Lau C. Dahlmann M. Ziegler M.

Nmnat3 Is dispensable in mitochondrial NAD level maintenance in vivo.PLoS ONE. 2016; 11: e0147037Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). We recently demonstrated that NAD+ synthesis and function is compartmentalized in cells (e.g., with NMNAT-1 supporting nuclear PARP-1 activity during adipogenesis) (Ryu et al., 2018Ryu K.W. Nandu T. Kim J. Challa S. DeBerardinis R.J. Kraus W.L. Metabolic regulation of transcription through compartmentalized NAD+ biosynthesis.Science. 2018; 360: eaan5780Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), but NAD+ compartmentalization and its functional significance in cancer has yet to be investigated. The PARP family of enzymes contains 17 members, each of which has distinct subcellular localizations, enzymatic activities (PARP versus MART), and protein substrates (Vyas et al., 2013Vyas S. Chesarone-Cataldo M. Todorova T. Huang Y.H. Chang P. A systematic analysis of the PARP protein family identifies new functions critical for cell physiology.Nat. Commun. 2013; 4: 2240Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). As such, the PARP family of enzymes collectively regulates a wide range of molecular mechanisms and cellular functions, including transcription, mRNA processing and stability, and DNA damage responses (Kim et al., 2020Kim D.S. Challa S. Jones A. Kraus W.L. PARPs and ADP-ribosylation in RNA biology: from RNA expression and processing to protein translation and proteostasis.Genes Dev. 2020; 34: 302-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Although the majority of research to date has been focused on understanding the biological importance of poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation (PARylation), predominantly mediated by the nuclear PARPs (PARP-1 and PARP-2), little is known about the biological importance of mono(ADP-ribosyl)ation (MARylation) and the enzymes that catalyze these reactions. Most PARP family members are monoenzymes that mediate substrate MARylation, and most of these enzymes are localized to the cytosol (Daugherty et al., 2014Daugherty M.D. Young J.M. Kerns J.A. Malik H.S. Rapid evolution of PARP genes suggests a broad role for ADP-ribosylation in host-virus conflicts.PLoS Genet. 2014; 10: e1004403Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar; Vyas et al., 2013Vyas S.

Commun. 2013; 4: 2240Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Therefore, we hypothesized that compartmentalized NAD+ synthesis regulates the activity of PARP monoenzymes that are involved in cytosolic processes dysregulated in cancer. Fast dividing cells, such as cancer cells, must maintain optimum protein levels. Ribosomes are a hub for this regulation: they are the molecular machines that synthesize proteins, and they also recruit a plethora of proteins to assist in protein clearance. Dysregulation of ribosome function is causative for several disorders, such as neurodegeneration and cancer (Klinge and Woolford, 2019Klinge S. Woolford Jr., J.L. Ribosome assembly coming into focus.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2019; 20: 116-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Recent studies have shown that the central components of the ribosome, including the repertoire of ribosomal proteins, can be regulated and diversified to control protein translation (Sauert et al., 2015Sauert M. Temmel H. Moll I. Heterogeneity of the translational machinery: Variations on a common theme.Biochimie. 2015; 114: 39-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). This regulation is mediated, in part, by post-translational modifications (PTMs) of ribosomal proteins, including phosphorylation, acetylation, and ubiquitylation, among others (Simsek and Barna, 2017Simsek D. Barna M. An emerging role for the ribosome as a nexus for post-translational modifications.Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2017; 45: 92-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Recent studies have begun to link ribosome biogenesis, ribosome function, and translation to cellular outcomes in cancers (Brighenti et al., 2015Brighenti E. Treré D. Derenzini M.

Interestingly, ADP-ribosylation of the translation machinery is a well-characterized outcome of intoxication by several human bacterial pathogens (e.g., Corynebacterium diphtheria, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Vibrio cholerae), whose toxins (diphtheria toxin, exotoxin A, and cholix toxin, respectively) ADP-ribosylate elongation factor-2 (eEF2), an essential component of the protein translation machinery, on a unique diphthamide residue in domain IV (Deng and Barbieri, 2008Deng Q.

Here, we explore the relationships between cytosolic NAD+ synthesis, ribosome MARylation, protein synthesis, and proteostasis in ovarian cancer. Ovarian cancers have a unique expression pattern of the NMNATs; the levels of NMNAT2 mRNA are upregulated and NMNAT3 mRNA levels are downregulated in ovarian cancers when compared to noncancerous ovarian tissue (Figure 1A). We previously showed that compartmentalized NMNAT-1 and NMNAT-2 compete for their shared substrate, nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN), during adipocyte differentiation (Ryu et al., 2018Ryu K.W. Nandu T. Kim J. Challa S. DeBerardinis R.J. Kraus W.L. Metabolic regulation of transcription through compartmentalized NAD+ biosynthesis.Science. 2018; 360: eaan5780Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). To determine if compartmentalization of NAD+ synthesis occurs in ovarian cancer cells, we generated human OVCAR3 ovarian cancer cells with short hairpin RNA (shRNA)-mediated knockdown of NMNAT1 or NMNAT2. Knockdown of either had no observable effect on the total cellular NAD+ level (Figure S1A). To analyze the effects of NMNAT1 or NMNAT2 knockdown on the subcellular levels of NAD+, we used genetically encoded, nuclear- or cytosol-specific NAD+ sensors and live-cell imaging (Cambronne et al., 2016Cambronne X.A. Stewart M.L. Kim D. Jones-Brunette A.M. Morgan R.K. Farrens D.L. Cohen M.S. Goodman R.H.

DeBerardinis R.J. Kraus W.L. Metabolic regulation of transcription through compartmentalized NAD+ biosynthesis.Science. 2018; 360: eaan5780Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). NMNAT2 knockdown reduced the cytosolic NAD+ levels and elevated the nuclear NAD+ levels in OVCAR3 cells, whereas NMNAT1 knockdown had the opposite effect (Figures 1B, 1C, S1B, and S1C). Ectopic expression of wild-type (WT) mouse NMNAT-2 or a catalytically dead mutant (H24D) (Ali et al., 2016Ali Y.O. Allen H.M. Yu L. Li-Kroeger D. Bakhshizadehmahmoudi D. Hatcher A. McCabe C. Xu J.

In contrast, ectopic expression of NMNAT-1 reduced cytosolic NAD+ levels, but enhanced nuclear NAD+ levels (Figure S1D). Together, these data indicate that NMNAT-2 is required for cytosolic NAD+ synthesis and affects NAD+ homeostasis in ovarian cancer cells.Figure S1NMNATs mediate compartmentalized NAD+ synthesis, related to Figures 1 and 2Show full caption(A) Depletion of NMNAT-1 or NMNAT-2 does not affect total cellular NAD+ levels in OVCAR3 cells.

NMNAT-1 co-localizes with PARP-1 on chromatin in the nucleus and regulates PARP-1 activity by providing NAD+ for localized consumption (Zhang et al., 2012Zhang T. Berrocal J.G. Yao J. DuMond M.E.

Because NMNAT-2 regulates cytosolic NAD+ levels, we hypothesized that NMNAT-2 supports the activity of cytosolic PARPs/MARTs in ovarian cancer cells. To test this, we monitored cellular MAR and PAR levels by immunofluorescent staining after NMNAT1 or NMNAT2 knockdown using MAR and PAR detection reagents that we developed previously (Gibson et al., 2017Gibson B.A. Conrad L.B.

The results from these assays demonstrate that: (1) MAR localizes primarily to the cytosol and PAR localizes primarily to the nucleus, (2) NMNAT-2 depletion reduces cytosolic MAR levels, but does not affect nuclear PAR levels, and (3) NMNAT-1 depletion reduces nuclear PAR levels, but does not affect cytosolic MAR levels (Figures 1D and S1E). Surprisingly, the majority of the MAR signal co-localized with a ribosomal protein, RPS6 (Figure 1D). These results suggest that NAD+ synthesized by NMNAT-2 regulates MARylation in ovarian cancer cells. To explore this in more detail in a cancer context, we performed immunohistochemistry (IHC) analysis of ovarian cancer tissue microarrays to evaluate NMNAT-2 and MAR levels in ovarian cancer patient samples. We observed a positive correlation between NMNAT-2 and MAR levels, with high-grade ovarian cancers having the highest levels of NMNAT-2 and MAR (Figures 1E and S1F). Of note, MAR staining in 49 high grade serous ovarian cancer patient samples from UT Southwestern Medical Center revealed that patients with high MAR levels have poor progression-free survival outcomes (Figures 1F and S1G). Following up on our observation that a majority of MAR signal co-localized with the ribosomal protein RPS6, we isolated ribosomes from OVCAR3 cells and blotted for MAR and PAR. We found that ribosomal proteins are highly MARylated, but not PARylated (Figure 2A). Depletion of NAD+ using an NAD+ synthesis inhibitor (i.e., FK866, which inhibits NAMPT) (Figure S1A) demonstrated that decreased NAD+ levels can abrogate ribosomal protein MARylation (Figure 2B). Indeed, NMNAT-2 depletion in OVCAR3 cells reduced ribosomal protein MARylation, whereas NMNAT-1 depletion had little effect (Figure 2C). Moreover, ectopic expression of an RNAi-resistant WT mouse NMNAT-2 (Nmnat2), but not the catalytically dead mutant, enhanced ribosomal protein MARylation in OVCAR3 cells subjected to NMNAT2 knockdown (Figure 2D), indicating that NMNAT-2 catalytic activity is required for ribosomal protein MARylation. Interestingly, NMNAT1 knockdown enhanced ribosome MARylation, and re-expression of an RNAi-resistant WT mouse NMNAT-1 (Nmnat1), but not a catalytically dead mutant, inhibited ribosomal protein MARylation (Figure S1H). Collectively, these results suggest that cytosolic NAD+ synthesis by NMNAT-2 is required for ribosomal protein MARylation. To examine the effects of NMNAT-2-regulated ribosomal MARylation on mRNA translation, we used puromycin incorporation as a measure of protein synthesis levels in OVCAR3 cells with NMNAT-2 depletion. Surprisingly, we observed that puromycin incorporation, as determined by western blotting, was higher in cells with NMNAT2 knockdown (Figure 2E). Furthermore, puromycin incorporation was inhibited by the ectopic expression of WT NMNAT-2, but not by the catalytically dead mutant (Figure 2F). In contrast, NMNAT-1 enhanced protein synthesis in a catalytic-dependent manner (Figure S1I). Together, these data indicate that NMNAT-2, which supports ribosomal protein MARylation, acts to inhibit protein synthesis in a manner that depends on its catalytic activity. To identify the MART(s) required for NMNAT-2-regulated ribosomal protein MARylation, we used a small interfering RNA (siRNA) knockdown screen targeting cytosolic MARTs expressed in OVCAR3 cells (Figures S2A and S2B). The effects of knockdown were assayed by immunofluorescent staining (Figures 3A, S2C, and S2E) and western blotting of ribosomal fractions (Figures 3B and S2D) for MAR and RPS6. This screen identified PARP-16 as the only MART whose knockdown had a significant effect on bulk cytosolic and ribosomal protein MARylation. These results were confirmed by shRNA-mediated depletion of PARP-16 in OVCAR3 cells. Similar to NMNAT-2 depletion, PARP-16 depletion dramatically reduced ribosomal protein MARylation (Figure 3C) and stimulated protein synthesis (Figure 3D). PARP-16 is a tail-anchored, endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-resident protein that regulates the ER stress response by modifying the key enzymes in the pathway, such as PERK (Jwa and Chang, 2012Jwa M. Chang P. PARP16 is a tail-anchored endoplasmic reticulum protein required for the PERK- and IRE1α-mediated unfolded protein response.Nat. Cell Biol. 2012; 14: 1223-1230Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). It also regulates the nuclear translocation machinery by MARylation of KAPß1 (Di Paola et al., 2012Di Paola S. Micaroni M. Di Tullio G. Buccione R. Di Girolamo M.

We found that PARP-16 is highly enriched in ribosomal fractions from OVCAR3 cells (Figure 3E). Importantly, NMNAT-2 and PARP-16 interact in cells in a manner that is independent of NMNAT-2 catalytic activity, but only WT and not catalytically dead mutant NMNAT-2 (W92G) enhances PARP-16 auto-MARylation (Figures 3F and S3A), providing a direct link between NMNAT-2 catalytic activity and PARP-16 catalytic activity through NAD+ production.Figure 3PARP-16 and NMNAT-2 regulate ribosomal protein MARylation-dependent protein homeostasisShow full caption(A and B) PARP-16 mediates ribosomal protein MARylation.

COVID-19 convalescent plasma (CCP) is a potential therapeutic, but there is limited data for patients with moderate-to-severe disease.What are outcomes associated with administration of CCP in patients with moderate-to-severe COVID-19 infection?We conducted a propensity score-matched analysis of patients with moderate-to-severe COVID-19. The primary endpoints were in-hospital mortality. Secondary endpoints were number of days alive and ventilator-free at 30 days; length of hospital stay; and change in WHO scores from CCP administration (or index date) to discharge. Of 151 patients who received CCP, 132 had complete follow-up data. Patients were transfused after a median of 6 hospital days; thus, we investigated the effect of convalescent plasma before and after this timepoint with 77 early (within 6 days) and 55 late (after 6 days) recipients. Among 3,217 inpatients who did not receive CCP, 2,551 were available for matching.Early CCP recipients, of whom 31 (40%) were on mechanical ventilation, had lower 14-day (15% vs 23%) and 30-day (38% vs 49%) mortality compared to a matched unexposed cohort, with nearly 50% lower likelihood of in-hospital mortality (HR 0.52, [95% CI 0.28-0.96]; P = 0.036). Early plasma recipients had more days alive and ventilator-free at 30 days (+3.3 days, [95% CI 0.2 to 6.3 days]; P = 0.04) and improved WHO scores at 7 days (-0.8, [95% CI: -1.2 to -0.4]; P = 0.0003) and hospital discharge (-0.9, [95% CI: -1.5 to -0.3]; P = 0.004) compared to the matched unexposed cohort. No clinical differences were observed in late plasma recipients.Early administration of CCP improves outcomes in patients with moderate-to-severe COVID-19, while improvement was not observed with late CCP administration. The importance of timing of administration should be addressed in specifically designed trials."
https://openalex.org/W3186393771,"Background The COVID-19 pandemic challenges neurologists in counselling patients with multiple sclerosis (pwMS) regarding their risk by SARS-CoV-2 and in guiding disease-modifying treatment (DMT). Objective To characterize the prevalence and outcome of COVID-19 in pwMS specifically associated with different DMT in a nationwide population-based study. Methods We included patients aged ≥18 years with a confirmed diagnosis of MS and a diagnosis of COVID-19 established between January 1, 2020 and December 31, 2020. We classified COVID-19 course as either mild, severe or fatal. Impact of DMT and specifically immunosuppressants (alemtuzumab, cladribine, fingolimod, ocrelizumab or rituximab) on COVID-19 outcome was determined by multivariable models, adjusted for a-priori-risk. Results Of 126 MS patients with COVID-19 (mean age 43.2 years [SD 13.4], 71% female), 86.5% had a mild course, 9.5% a severe course and 3.2% died from COVID-19. A-priori-risk significantly predicted COVID-19 severity (R 2 0.814; p&lt;0.001) and mortality (R 2 0.664; p&lt;0.001). Adjusting for this a-priori-risk, neither exposure to any DMT nor exposure to specific immunosuppressive DMT were significantly associated with COVID-19 severity (odds ratio [OR] 1.6; p = 0.667 and OR 1.9; p = 0.426) or mortality (OR 0.5; p = 0.711 and 2.1; 0.233) when compared to no DMT. Conclusions In a population-based MS cohort, COVID-19 outcome was not associated with exposure to DMT and immunosuppressive DMT when accounting for other already known risk factors. This provides reassuring evidence that COVID-19 risk can be individually anticipated in MS and–except for a very small proportion of high-risk patients–treatment decisions should be primarily focused on treating MS rather than the pandemic."
https://openalex.org/W3183521958,"The ability to form a variety of cell-matrix connections is crucial for angiogenesis to take place. Without stable anchorage to the extracellular matrix (ECM), endothelial cells (ECs) are unable to sense, integrate and disseminate growth factor stimulated responses that drive growth of a vascular bed. Neuropilin-2 (NRP2) is a widely expressed membrane-bound multifunctional non-tyrosine kinase receptor, which has previously been implicated in influencing cell adhesion and migration by interacting with α5-integrin and regulating adhesion turnover. α5-integrin, and its ECM ligand fibronectin (FN) are both known to be upregulated during the formation of neo-vasculature. Despite being descriptively annotated as a candidate biomarker for aggressive cancer phenotypes, the EC-specific roles for NRP2 during developmental and pathological angiogenesis remain unexplored. The data reported here support a model whereby NRP2 actively promotes EC adhesion and migration by regulating dynamic cytoskeletal remodeling and by stimulating Rab11-dependent recycling of α5-integrin-p-FAK complexes to newly assembling adhesion sites. Furthermore, temporal depletion of EC-NRP2 in vivo impairs primary tumor growth by disrupting vessel formation. We also demonstrate that EC-NRP2 is required for normal postnatal retinal vascular development, specifically by regulating cell-matrix adhesion. Upon loss of endothelial NRP2, vascular outgrowth from the optic nerve during superficial plexus formation is disrupted, likely due to reduced FAK phosphorylation within sprouting tip cells."
https://openalex.org/W3183860376,"Structural and thermodynamic factors which may influence burnt bone survivorship in archaeological contexts have not been fully described. A highly controlled experimental reference collection of fresh, modern bone burned in temperature increments 100-1200˚C is presented here to document the changes to bone tissue relevant to preservation using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction. Specific parameters investigated here include the rate of organic loss, amount of bone mineral recrystallization, and average growth in bone mineral crystallite size. An archaeological faunal assemblage ca. 30,000 years ago from Tolbor-17 (Mongolia) is additionally considered to confirm visibility of changes seen in the modern reference sample and to relate structural changes to commonly used zooarchaeological scales of burning intensity. The timing of our results indicates that the loss of organic components in both modern and archaeological bone burnt to temperatures up to 700˚C are not accompanied by growth changes in the average crystallite size of bone mineral bioapatite, leaving the small and reactive bioapatite crystals of charred and carbonized bone exposed to diagenetic agents in depositional contexts. For bones burnt to temperatures of 700˚C and above, two major increases in average crystallite size are noted which effectively decrease the available surface area of bone mineral crystals, decreasing reactivity and offering greater thermodynamic stability despite the mechanical fragility of calcined bone. We discuss the archaeological implications of these observations within the context of Tolbor-17 and the challenges of identifying anthropogenic fire."
https://openalex.org/W3185246005,"Slow-wave sleep is characterized by near-synchronous alternation of active Up states and quiescent Down states in the neocortex. Although the cortex itself can maintain these oscillations, the full expression of Up-Down states requires intact thalamocortical circuits. Sensory thalamic input can drive the cortex into an Up state. Here we show that midline thalamic neurons terminate Up states synchronously across cortical areas. Combining local field potential, single-unit, and patch-clamp recordings in conjunction with optogenetic stimulation and silencing in mice in vivo, we report that thalamic input mediates Down transition via activation of layer 1 neurogliaform inhibitory neurons acting on GABAB receptors. These results strengthen the evidence that thalamocortical interactions are essential for the full expression of slow-wave sleep, show that Down transition is an active process mediated by cortical GABAB receptors, and demonstrate that thalamus synchronizes Down transitions across cortical areas during natural slow-wave sleep."
https://openalex.org/W3184676225,"B-Myb is an important transcription factor that plays a critical role in gene expression regulation and tumorigenesis. However, its functional implication in colorectal cancer remains elusive. In this study, we found that B-Myb was significantly upregulated at both mRNA and protein levels in colorectal cancer samples compared to non-tumor counterparts. B-Myb overexpression accelerated cell proliferation, cell cycle progression and cell motility in colorectal cancer cells, and promoted tumor growth in orthotopic nude mouse models in vivo. In contrast, B-Myb depletion inhibited these malignant phenotypes. Mechanistic investigations revealed that E2F2 was a novel transcriptional target of B-Myb and is essential to B-Myb-induced malignant phenotypes. Notably, B-Myb and E2F2 exhibited positive expression correlation, and interacted with each other in colorectal cancer cells. In addition to their autoregulatory mechanisms, B-Myb and E2F2 can also directly transactivate each other, thus constituting consolidated reciprocal feed-forward transactivation loops. Moreover, both B-Myb and E2F2 are required for the activation of ERK and AKT signaling pathways in colorectal cancer cells. Taken together, our data clarified a critical role for B-Myb in colorectal cancer and unraveled an exquisite mutual collaboration and reciprocal cross regulation between B-Myb and E2F2 that contribute to the malignant progression of human colorectal cancer."
https://openalex.org/W3186429542,"Rotavirus infection is a dilemma for developing countries, including Malaysia. Although commercial rotavirus vaccines are available, these are not included in Malaysia's national immunization program. A scarcity of data about rotavirus genotype distribution could be partially to blame for this policy decision, because there are no data for rotavirus genotype distribution in Malaysia over the past 20 years. From January 2018 to March 2019, we conducted a study to elucidate the rotavirus burden and genotype distribution in the Kota Kinabalu and Kunak districts of the state of Sabah. Stool specimens were collected from children under 5 years of age, and rotavirus antigen in these samples was detected using commercially available kit. Electropherotypes were determined by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of genomic RNA. G and P genotypes were determined by RT-PCR using type specific primers. The nucleotide sequence of the amplicons was determined by Sanger sequencing and phylogenetic analysis was performed by neighbor-joining method. Rotavirus was identified in 43 (15.1%) children with watery diarrhea. The male:female ratio (1.9:1) of the rotavirus-infected children clearly showed that it affected predominantly boys, and children 12-23 months of age. The genotypes identified were G3P[8] (74% n = 31), followed by G1P[8] (14% n = 6), G12P[6](7% n = 3), G8P[8](3% n = 1), and GxP[8] (3% n = 1). The predominant rotavirus circulating among the children was the equine-like G3P[8] (59.5% n = 25) with a short electropherotype. Eleven electropherotypes were identified among 34 strains, indicating substantial diversity among the circulating strains. The circulating genotypes were also phylogenetically diverse and related to strains from several different countries. The antigenic epitopes present on VP7 and VP4 of Sabahan G3 and equine-like G3 differed considerably from that of the RotaTeq vaccine strain. Our results also indicate that considerable genetic exchange is occurring in Sabahan strains. Sabah is home to a number of different ethnic groups, some of which culturally are in close contact with animals, which might contribute to the evolution of diverse rotavirus strains. Sabah is also a popular tourist destination, and a large number of tourists from different countries possibly contributes to the diversity of circulating rotavirus genotypes. Considering all these factors which are contributing rotavirus genotype diversity, continuous surveillance of rotavirus strains is of utmost importance to monitor the pre- and post-vaccination efficacy of rotavirus vaccines in Sabah."
https://openalex.org/W3184579305,"Interstitial lung diseases (ILDs) are chronic, parenchymal lung diseases with a variable clinical course and a poor prognosis. Within various clinical courses, acute exacerbation (AE) is a devastating condition with significant morbidity and high mortality. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of interleukin-6 (IL-6) to predict AE and prognosis in patients with ILD.Eighty-three patients who were diagnosed with ILD from 2016 to 2019 at the Haeundae Paik Hospital, Busan, South Korea, were included and their clinical data were retrospectively analyzed.The median follow-up period was 20 months. The mean age was 68.1 years and 65.1% of the patients were men with 60.2% of patients being ever-smokers. Among ILDs, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis was the most common disease (68.7%), followed by connective tissue disease-associated ILD (14.5%), cryptogenic organizing pneumonia (9.6%), and nonspecific interstitial pneumonia (6.0%). The serum levels of IL-6 were measured at diagnosis with ILD and sequentially at follow-up visits. During the follow-ups, 15 (18.1%) patients experienced an acute exacerbation (AE) of ILD and among them, four (26.7%) patients died. In the multivariable analysis, high levels of IL-6 (OR 1.014, 95% CI: 1.001-1.027, p = 0.036) along with lower baseline saturations of peripheral oxygen (SpO2) were independent risk factors for AE. In the receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, the area under the curve was 0.815 (p < 0.001) and the optimal cut-off value of serum IL-6 to predict AE was 25.20 pg/mL with a sensitivity of 66.7% and specificity of 80.6%. In the multivariable Cox analysis, a high level of serum IL-6 (HR 1.007, 95% CI: 1.001-1.014, p = 0.018) was only an independent risk factor for mortality in ILD patients.In our study, a high level of serum IL-6 is a useful biomarker to predict AE and poor prognosis in patients with ILD."
https://openalex.org/W3185487316,"Objective Limited evidence suggests that higher levels of serum vitamin D (25(OH)D) protect against SARS-CoV-2 virus (COVID-19) infection. Black women commonly experience 25(OH)D insufficiency and are overrepresented among COVID-19 cases. We conducted a prospective analysis of serum 25(OH)D levels in relation to COVID-19 infection among participants in the Black Women’s Health Study. Methods Since 1995, the Black Women’s Health Study has followed 59,000 U.S. Black women through biennial mailed or online questionnaires. Over 13,000 study participants provided a blood sample in 2013–2017. 25(OH)D assays were performed in a certified national laboratory shortly after collection of the samples. In 2020, participants who had completed the online version of the 2019 biennial health questionnaire were invited to complete a supplemental online questionnaire assessing their experiences related to the COVID-19 pandemic, including whether they had been tested for COVID-19 infection and the result of the test. We used logistic regression analysis to estimate odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the association of 25(OH)D level with COVID-19 positivity, adjusting for age, number of people living in the household, neighborhood socioeconomic status, and other potential confounders. Results Among 5,081 eligible participants whose blood sample had been assayed for 25(OH)D, 1,974 reported having had a COVID-19 test in 2020. Relative to women with 25(OH)D levels of 30 ng/mL (75 nmol/l) or more, multivariable-adjusted ORs for COVID-19 infection in women with levels of 20–29 ng/mL (50–72.5 nmol/l) and &lt;20 ng/mL (&lt;50 nmol/l) were, respectively, 1.48 (95% CI 0.95–2.30) and 1.69 (95% CI 1.04–2.72) (p trend 0.02). Conclusion The present results suggest that U.S. Black women with lower levels of 25(OH)D are at increased risk of infection with COVID-19. Further work is needed to confirm these findings and determine the optimal level of 25(OH)D for a beneficial effect."
https://openalex.org/W3183356662,"Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales (CRE) represent a serious threat to public health due to the lack of treatment and high mortality. The rate of antimicrobial resistance of Enterobacterales isolates to major antimicrobials, including carbapenems, is much higher in Vietnam than in Western countries, but the reasons remain unknown due to the lack of genomic epidemiology research. A previous study suggested that carbapenem resistance genes, such as the carbapenemase gene blaNDM, spread via plasmids among Enterobacterales in Vietnam. In this study, we characterized blaNDM-carrying plasmids in Enterobacterales isolated in Vietnam, and identified several possible cases of horizontal transfer of plasmids both within and among species of bacteria. Twenty-five carbapenem-nonsusceptible isolates from a medical institution in Hanoi were sequenced on Illumina short-read sequencers, and 13 blaNDM-positive isolates, including isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Citrobacter freundii, Morganella morganii, and Proteus mirabilis, were further sequenced on an Oxford Nanopore Technologies long-read sequencer to obtain complete plasmid sequences. Almost identical 73 kb IncFII(pSE11)::IncN hybrid plasmids carrying blaNDM-1 were found in a P. mirabilis isolate and an M. morganii isolate. A 112 kb IncFII(pRSB107)::IncN hybrid plasmid carrying blaNDM-1 in an E. coli isolate had partially identical sequences with a 39 kb IncR plasmid carrying blaNDM-1 and an 88 kb IncFII(pHN7A8)::IncN hybrid plasmid in a C. freundii isolate. 148-149 kb IncFIA(Hl1)::IncA/C2 plasmids and 75-76 kb IncFII(Yp) plasmids, both carrying blaNDM-1 were shared among three sequence type 11 (ST11) isolates and three ST395 isolates of K. pneumoniae, respectively. Most of the plasmids co-carried genes conferring resistance to clinically relevant antimicrobials, including third-generation cephalosporins, aminoglycosides, and fluoroquinolones, in addition to blaNDM-1. These results provide insight into the genetic basis of CRE in Vietnam, and could help control nosocomial infections."
https://openalex.org/W3185532377,"Drusen are known to be the important hallmark to predict the development of age-related macular degeneration (AMD). The prevalence of drusen is lower in Asians compared with Caucasians so that the role of signs constituting early AMD is not well established in Asian populations as in Western countries. In this study, we retrospectively investigated clinical characteristics and 5-year incidence of neovascular AMD (nAMD) in the fellow eye of unilateral nAMD patients. Of 296 consecutive unilateral nAMD patients who had been followed up more than 5 years, 170 typical AMD, 119 polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy, and 7 retinal angiomatous proliferation were included. To examine factors associated with nAMD occurrence in the fellow eye, drusen and pigmentary abnormality in the fellow eye were classified into 4 categories; Category 1: no or small drusen < 63 μm (37.2%), Category 2: 63-125 μm medium drusen or pigmentary abnormality (22.2%), Category 3: large drusen > 125 μm (25.0%), Category P: pachydrusen (15.5%). The mean sub-foveal choroidal thickness (SFCT) was Category 1: 276 μm, Category 2: 308 μm, Category 3: 246 μm, and Category P: 302 μm, respectively. Of note, SFCT in Category 2 and Category P was significantly larger than those of Category 3. Finally, the 5-year incidence of nAMD in the fellow eye was 32/296 (10.8%); Category 1: 0/110 (0%), Category 2: 12/66 (18.2%), Category 3: 20/74 (27.0%), and Category P: 0/46 (0%). Thus, signs of intermediate AMD (large drusen) as well as those of early AMD, especially the pigmentary abnormality, may contribute to development of bilateral nAMD in Japanese patients."
https://openalex.org/W3183431599,"Declines in period life expectancy at birth (PLEB) provide seemingly intuitive indicators of the impact of a cause of death on the individual lifespan. Derived under the assumption that future mortality conditions will remain indefinitely those observed during a reference period, however, their intuitive interpretation becomes problematic when period conditions reflect a temporary mortality “shock”, resulting from a natural disaster or the diffusion of a new epidemic in the population for instance. Rather than to make assumptions about future mortality, I propose measuring the difference between a period average age at death and the average expected age at death of the same individuals (death cohort): the Mean Unfulfilled Lifespan (MUL). For fine-grained tracking of the mortality impact of an epidemic, I also provide an empirical shortcut to MUL estimation for small areas or short periods. For illustration, quarterly MUL values in 2020 are derived from estimates of COVID-19 deaths that might substantially underestimate overall mortality change in affected populations. These results nonetheless illustrate how MUL tracks the mortality impact of the pandemic in several national and sub-national populations. Using a seven-day rolling window, the empirical shortcut suggests MUL peaked at 6.43 years in Lombardy, 8.91 years in New Jersey, and 6.24 years in Mexico City for instance. Sensitivity analyses are presented, but in the case of COVID-19, the main uncertainty remains the potential gap between reported COVID-19 deaths and actual increases in the number of deaths induced by the pandemic in some of the most affected countries. Using actual number of deaths rather than reported COVID-19 deaths may increase seven-day MUL from 6.24 to 8.96 years in Mexico City and from 2.67 to 5.49 years in Lima for instance. In Guayas (Ecuador), MUL is estimated to have reached 12.7 years for the entire month of April 2020."
https://openalex.org/W3184372255,"In this study geogenic radon potential (GRP) mapping was carried out on the bases of field radon in soil gas concentration and soil gas permeability measurements by considering the corresponding geological formations. The spatial pattern of soil gas radon concentration, soil permeability, and GRP and the relationship between geological formations and these parameters was studied by performing detailed spatial analysis. The radon activity concentration in soil gas ranged from 0.11 to 434.5 kBq m-3 with a mean of 18.96 kBq m-3, and a standard deviation was 55.38 kBq m-3. The soil gas permeability ranged from 5.2×10-14 to 5.2×10-12 m2, with a mean of 5.65×10-13 m2. The GRP values were computed from the 222Rn activity concentration and soil gas permeability data. The range of GRP values was from 0.04 to 154.08. Locations on igneous granite rock geology were characterized by higher soil radon gas activity and higher GRP, making them radon-prone areas according to international standards. The other study locations fall between the low to medium risk, except for areas with high soil permeability, which are not internationally classified as radon prone. A GRP map was created displaying radon-prone areas for the study location using Kriging/Cokriging, based on in situ and predicted measured values. The GRP map assists in human health risk assessment and risk reduction since it indicates the potential of the source of radon and can serve as a vital tool for radon combat planning."

Despite many clinical and biological risk markers having been associated with variable survival in cancer, assessing the interplay of these markers through Machine Learning (ML) algorithms still remains to be fully explored. Here, we present a Multi Learning Training approach (MuLT) combining supervised, unsupervised and self-supervised learning algorithms, to examine the predictive value of heterogeneous treatment outcomes for Multiple Myeloma (MM). We show that gene expression values improve the treatment sensitivity prediction and recapitulates genetic abnormalities detected by Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) testing. MuLT performance was assessed by cross-validation experiments, in which it predicted treatment sensitivity with 68.70% of AUC. Finally, simulations showed numerical evidences that in average 17.07% of patients could get better response to a different treatment at the first line."
https://openalex.org/W3186364327,"Understanding the processes by which the mammalian embryo implants in the maternal uterus is a long-standing challenge in embryology. New insights into this morphogenetic event could be of great importance in helping, for example, to reduce human infertility. During implantation the blastocyst, composed of epiblast, trophectoderm and primitive endoderm, undergoes significant remodelling from an oval ball to an egg cylinder. A main feature of this transformation is symmetry breaking and reshaping of the epiblast into a ""cup"". Based on previous studies, we hypothesise that this event is the result of mechanical constraints originating from the trophectoderm, which is also significantly transformed during this process. In order to investigate this hypothesis we propose MG# (MechanoGenetic Sharp), an original computational model of biomechanics able to reproduce key cell shape changes and tissue level behaviours in silico. With this model, we simulate epiblast and trophectoderm morphogenesis during implantation. First, our results uphold experimental findings that repulsion at the apical surface of the epiblast is essential to drive lumenogenesis. Then, we provide new theoretical evidence that trophectoderm morphogenesis indeed can dictate the cup shape of the epiblast and fosters its movement towards the uterine tissue. Our results offer novel mechanical insights into mouse peri-implantation and highlight the usefulness of agent-based modelling methods in the study of embryogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W3185046510,"Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) is a prevalent and serious mental health condition. People can experience recovery or remission after receiving psychotherapy for BPD; however, it is estimated that about 45% of people in well conducted treatment trials do not respond adequately to current psychological treatments.To further advance psychotherapies for BPD by identifying the factors that contribute to the problem of non-response.184 consecutive participants with BPD in community treatment were naturalistically followed up over 12 months and measures of personality and social functioning were examined. Logistic regressions were used to determine which baseline factors were associated with the likelihood of being a non-responder after 12 months of psychotherapy. After 12 months, 48.4% of participants were classed as non-responders due to a lack of reduction in BPD symptoms according to the Reliable Change Index (RCI) method.At baseline intake, patients who endorsed an adult preoccupied attachment relationship style and increased anger were more likely to be a non-responder regarding BPD symptoms at 12 months. In addition, those with preoccupied attachment patterns in their adult relationships were more likely to be non-responders regarding general psychological distress at follow up. Higher baseline levels of paranoia and endorsement of a dismissive adult relationship style was associated with being a non-responder in regard to global functioning.Consistent with previous research, almost half of the sample did not achieve reliable change at 12-month follow up. A relationship style characterised by preoccupied insecurity and high anger seemed to be particularly challenging in being able to benefit from psychotherapy. This style may have affected both relationships outside, but also inside therapy, complicating treatment engagement and alliance with the therapist. Early identification and modification of treatment based on challenges from these relationship styles may be one way to improve psychotherapy outcomes for BPD."
https://openalex.org/W3185507134,"Degradation in the polymeric insulators is caused due to the environmental stresses. The main aim of this paper is to explore the improved aging characteristics of hybrid samples by adding nano/micro silica in High Temperature Vulcanized Silicone Rubber (HTV-SiR) under long term accelerated aging conditions for 9000 hours. As HTV-SiR is unable to sustain environmental stresses for a long time, thus a long term accelerated aging behavior is an important phenomenon to be considered for field application. The aging characteristics of nano/micro filled HTV-SiR are analyzed by using techniques such as Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Leakage Current (LC), Fourier Transform Infrared Microscopy (FTIR), Hydrophobicity Classification (HC), and breakdown strength for the aging time of 9000 hours. FTIR and leakage currents are measured after every cycle. All the co-filled samples revealed escalated aging characteristics as compared to the neat sample except the SN8 sample (8% nano-silica+20% micro-silica) after 9000 hours of aging. The highest loading of 6% and 8% nano-silica with 20% micro-silica do not contribute to the improved performance when compared with the neat and hybrid samples. However, from the critical experimental analysis, it is deduced that SN2 sample (2% nano-silica+20% micro-silica) is highly resistant to the long term accelerated aging conditions. SN2 has no cracks, lower loss percentages in the important FTIR absorption peaks, higher breakdown strength and superior HC after aging as compared to the unfilled and hybrid samples."
https://openalex.org/W3186193846,"Barth syndrome (BTHS) is an X-linked disorder of mitochondrial phospholipid metabolism caused by pathogenic variants in TAFFAZIN, which results in abnormal cardiolipin (CL) content in the inner mitochondrial membrane. To identify unappreciated pathways of mitochondrial dysfunction in BTHS, we utilized an unbiased proteomics strategy and identified that complex I (CI) of the mitochondrial respiratory chain and the mitochondrial quality control protease presenilin-associated rhomboid-like protein (PARL) are altered in a new HEK293-based tafazzin-deficiency model. Follow-up studies confirmed decreased steady state levels of specific CI subunits and an assembly factor in the absence of tafazzin; this decrease is in part based on decreased transcription and results in reduced CI assembly and function. PARL, a rhomboid protease associated with the inner mitochondrial membrane with a role in the mitochondrial response to stress, such as mitochondrial membrane depolarization, is increased in tafazzin-deficient cells. The increased abundance of PARL correlates with augmented processing of a downstream target, phosphoglycerate mutase 5, at baseline and in response to mitochondrial depolarization. To clarify the relationship between abnormal CL content, CI levels, and increased PARL expression that occurs when tafazzin is missing, we used blue-native PAGE and gene expression analysis to determine that these defects are remediated by SS-31 and bromoenol lactone, pharmacologic agents that bind CL or inhibit CL deacylation, respectively. These findings have the potential to enhance our understanding of the cardiac pathology of BTHS, where defective mitochondrial quality control and CI dysfunction have well-recognized roles in the pathology of diverse forms of cardiac dysfunction."
https://openalex.org/W3186781371,"Ovarian high grade serous carcinoma (HGSC) is a lethal form of ovarian cancer (OVCA). In most cases it is detected at late stages as the symptoms are non-specific during early stages. Emerging information suggests that the oviductal fimbria is a site of origin of ovarian HGSC. Currently available tests cannot detect ovarian HGSC at early stage. The lack of a preclinical model with oviductal fimbria that develops spontaneous ovarian HGSC is a significant barrier to developing an early detection test for this disease. The goal of this study was to examine if the oviductal fimbria in hens is a site of origin of HGSC and whether it expresses several putative markers expressed in ovarian HGSC in patients. A total of 135 laying hens (4 years old) were selected from a flock using transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS) imaging, followed by euthanasia and gross examination for the presence of solid masses and ascites. Histological types of carcinomas were determined by hematoxylin and eosin staining. Expression of WT-1, mutant p53, CA-125, PAX2 and Ki67 in normal or malignant fimbriae or ovaries were examined using immunohistochemistry, immunoblotting and gene expression assays. This study detected tumors in oviductal fimbriae in hens and routine staining revealed ovarian HGSC-like microscopic features in these tumors. These tumors showed similarities to ovarian HGSC in patients in expressing several markers. Compared with normal fimbriae, intensities of expression of WT-1, mutant p53, CA-125, and Ki67 were significantly (P<0.05) higher in fimbrial tumors. In contrast, expression of PAX2 decreased gradually as the tumor progressed to late stages. The patterns of expression of these markers were similar to those in ovarian HGSC patients. Thus, tumors of the oviductal fimbria in hens may offer a preclinical model to study different aspects of spontaneous ovarian HGSC in women including its early detection."
https://openalex.org/W3184660395,"Fractures and deviations to the keel bone are common in commercial laying hens, with reported variations in occurrence across strains and breeds. The aetiology is not fully understood, however, modern genetics and selection for efficient egg production has been claimed to be important factors for the keel bone fractures. To explore this further, we investigated keel bones from two different breeds, representing different degrees of selection for egg production: Red jungle fowl (n = 82), and White Leghorn (n = 32), where the latter is a selected laying breed which is the origin for many modern laying hen hybrids. Keel bones from a total of 116 birds, 53 hens and 63 roosters, were examined by necropsy at 80 weeks of age. All birds were raised in modified aviaries in the same holding facility. Overall, 24.5% of the hens had one or more fractures to the keel, with a difference in the prevalence between hens from the two breeds (p<0.01): 10% (95% CI: 3.7-24%) in the Red Jungle fowl hens and 69% (95% CI: 37-90%) in the White Leghorn hens. No roosters, regardless of breed, had keel bone fractures. Mild to moderate keel bone deviations were present in 54% (95% CI: 25-80%) of the hens and 4.7% (95% CI: 0.5-30%) of the roosters, all White Leghorns."
https://openalex.org/W3185763966,"Wearing a facial mask can limit COVID-19 transmission. Measurements of communities' mask use behavior have mostly relied on self-report. This study's objective was to devise a method to measure the prevalence of improper mask use and no mask use in indoor public areas without relying on self-report. A stratified random sample of retail trade stores (public areas) in Louisville, Kentucky, USA, was selected and targeted for observation by trained surveyors during December 14-20, 2020. The stratification allowed for investigating mask use behavior by city district, retail trade group, and public area size. The total number of visited public areas was 382 where mask use behavior of 2,080 visitors and 1,510 staff were observed. The average prevalence of mask use among observed visitors was 96%, while the average prevalence of proper use was 86%. In 48% of the public areas, at least one improperly masked visitor was observed and in 17% at least one unmasked visitor was observed. The average prevalence of proper mask use among staff was 87%, similar to the average among visitors. However, the percentage of public areas where at least one improperly masked staff was observed was 33. Significant disparities in mask use and its proper use were observed among both visitors and staff by public area size, retail trade type, and geographical area. Observing unmasked and improperly masked visitors was more common in small (less than 1500 square feet) public areas than larger ones, specifically in food and grocery stores as compared to other retail stores. Also, the majority of the observed unmasked persons were male and middle-aged."
https://openalex.org/W3186020591,"The preoperative distinction between uncomplicated and complicated appendicitis is important to determine the appropriate treatments, such as antibiotics, surgery, or interval appendectomy. Computed tomography (CT) plays an important role; however, combining clinical and imaging factors may make preoperative evaluation more reliable. This study evaluated and analyzed cases and the usefulness of several preoperative factors and clinical scoring models to detect complicated appendicitis.A total of 203 patients preoperatively diagnosed with acute appendicitis at our facility were included. Complicated appendicitis was defined as appendicitis with gangrene, perforated appendix, and/or abscess formation. Preoperative factors were collected from published clinical scoring models; patient information, symptoms, signs, results of laboratory tests, and findings of CT. Factors were analyzed using a chi-squared test and the Mann-Whitney U test.The preoperative factors were compared between 151 uncomplicated and 52 complicated appendicitis patients. The significant factors were age ≥40, duration of symptoms >24 hours, body temperature ≥37.3°C, high levels of CRP, findings in CT scan (appendix diameter ≥10 mm, stranding of the adjacent fat, presence of fluid collection, and suspicion of abscess or perforation). We also evaluated the usefulness of clinical scoring models for the detection of complicated appendicitis and found the Appendicitis Inflammatory Response score and two prediction models (Atema score and Imaoka score) showed significance (p < 0.05). High serum CRP level was significantly associated with complicated appendicitis (p < 0.001), and the predicted existence rates of complicated appendicitis were 52.7% for serum CRP level ≥50mg/L, 74.4% for ≥100mg/L, and 82.6% for ≥150mg/L.The results demonstrated several preoperative factors and clinical scoring models to increase suspicion of complicated appendicitis. Specifically, high serum levels of CRP may be a useful factor in predicting complicated appendicitis prior to surgery when supported by clinical findings and imaging; however, further research is needed."
https://openalex.org/W3186299238,"According to the theories of rockburst based on butterfly-shaped plastic zones, a plane strain mechanical model was established for stress distribution around the holes in homogeneous elastoplastic media. Based on the Mohr-Coulomb yield criterion and the generalized form of Hooke's law, the equation for the elastic strain-energy density of units at a 3D stress state was deduced. On this basis, the energy absorption and release in rocks surrounding a roadway during the evolution thereof in a coal reservoir tend to rock bursting were quantified. Through Flac3D 5.0 numerical simulation software, the energy released from a homogeneous circular roadway at different development states of plastic zones was investigated. By investigating conditions at the 21141 working face in Qianqiu Coal Mine, Henan Province, China, subjected to rockburst, a numerical model was established to calculate the energy released by a rockburst working face. The calculated results approximated the data monitored at the outburst site, with the same energy level recorded. The theoretical calculation for energy release from the rock surrounding a roadway is expected to reference engineering practice."

In addition to maintaining the basic functions, new air-conditioning should also add air purification functions to improve indoor air quality and reduce the possibility of virus transmission. Nowadays, there is lack of research results on the innovation of air-conditioning. The aim of this study is to present a two-stage mathematical model for identifying critical manufacturing factors in the innovation process of air conditioning. In this paper, Kano and quality function deployment (QFD) are used to analyze the critical factors affecting air-conditioning innovation. Some studies have proposed using Kano-QFD model to analyze product innovation, but the study only studies one stage, which loses the analysis of the subsequent stages of product innovation. Based on this, this paper studies the priority method of two-stage critical factors for air-conditioning innovation. Firstly, the questionnaire survey and fuzzy sets are used to collect demand information of multi-agent (customers and professional technicians). Secondly, the Kano model is used to classify and calculate satisfaction of multi-agent. Then, QFD is used to transform multi-agent demands into engineering property indexes (first stage) and technical property indexes (second stage) and calculate the weight of each index. Finally, the applicability and superiority of this method is illustrated by taking the central air-conditioning as an example."
https://openalex.org/W3184317500,"The aim of this study was to investigate the atomic composition and the proteome of the salivary proteins adsorbed on the surface of orthodontic metallic bracket. For this, the atomic composition of orthodontic metallic brackets was analyzed with X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS). The acquired bracket pellicle was characterized after brackets were immersed in human whole saliva supernatant for 2 hours at 37°C. Hydroxyapatite (HA) discs were used as a control. Acquired pellicle was harvested from the HA discs (n = 12) and from the metallic brackets (n = 12). Proteomics based on mass spectrometry technology was used for salivary protein identification and characterization. Results showed that most of the proteins adsorbed on the surface of orthodontic metallic brackets and on the HA discs were identified specifically to each group, indicating a small overlapping between the salivary proteins on each study group. A total of 311 proteins present on the HA discs were unique to this group while 253 proteins were unique to metallic brackets, and only 45 proteins were common to the two groups. Even though most proteins were unique to each study group, proteins related to antimicrobial activity, lubrication, and remineralization were present in both groups. These findings demonstrate that the salivary proteins adsorbed on the bracket surface are dependent on the material molecular composition."
https://openalex.org/W3185671608,"Ribonucleotide reductases (RNRs) catalyze the reduction of ribonucleotides to the corresponding deoxyribonucleotides, the building blocks of DNA. RNRs are specific for either ribonucleoside diphosphates or triphosphates as substrates. As far as is known, oxygen-dependent class I RNRs (NrdAB) all reduce ribonucleoside diphosphates, and oxygen-sensitive class III RNRs (NrdD) are all ribonucleoside triphosphate reducers, whereas the adenosylcobalamin-dependent class II (NrdJ) contains both ribonucleoside diphosphate and triphosphate reducers. However, it is unknown how this specificity is conveyed by the active site of the enzymes and how this feature developed in RNR evolution. By structural comparison of the active sites in different RNRs, we identified the apical loop of the phosphate-binding site as a potential structural determinant of substrate specificity. Grafting two residues from this loop from a diphosphate- to a triphosphate-specific RNR caused a change in preference from ribonucleoside triphosphate to diphosphate substrates in a class II model enzyme, confirming them as the structural determinants of phosphate specificity. The investigation of the phylogenetic distribution of this motif in class II RNRs yielded a likely monophyletic clade with the diphosphate-defining motif. This indicates a single evolutionary-split event early in NrdJ evolution in which diphosphate specificity developed from the earlier triphosphate specificity. For those interesting cases where organisms contain more than one nrdJ gene, we observed a preference for encoding enzymes with diverse phosphate specificities, suggesting that this varying phosphate specificity confers a selective advantage."
https://openalex.org/W3184130140,"The bioactive lipid intermediate palmitoyl CoA (PCoA) can inhibit mitochondrial ADP/ATP transport, though the physiological relevance of this regulation remains unclear. We questioned whether myocardial ischemia provides a pathological setting in which PCoA regulation of ADP/ATP transport would be beneficial, and secondly, whether the chronically elevated lipid content within the diabetic heart could make mitochondria less sensitive to the effects of PCoA. PCoA acutely decreased ADP-stimulated state 3 respiration and increased the apparent Km for ADP twofold. The half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of PCoA in control mitochondria was 22 µM. This inhibitory effect of PCoA on respiration was blunted in diabetic mitochondria, with no significant difference in the Km for ADP in the presence of PCoA, and an increase in the IC50 to 32 µM PCoA. The competitive inhibition by PCoA was localised to the phosphorylation apparatus, particularly the ADP/ATP carrier (AAC). During ischemia, the AAC imports ATP into the mitochondria, where it is hydrolysed by reversal of the ATP synthase, regenerating the membrane potential. Addition of PCoA dose-dependently prevented this wasteful ATP hydrolysis for membrane repolarisation during ischemia, however, this beneficial effect was blunted in diabetic mitochondria. Finally, using 31P-magnetic resonance spectroscopy we demonstrated that diabetic hearts lose ATP more rapidly during ischemia, with a threefold higher ATP decay rate compared with control hearts. In conclusion, PCoA plays a role in protecting mitochondrial energetics during ischemia, by preventing wasteful ATP hydrolysis. However, this beneficial effect is blunted in diabetes, contributing to the impaired energy metabolism seen during myocardial ischemia in the diabetic heart."
https://openalex.org/W3185142368,"Photons during the dark period delay flowering in short-day plants (SDP). Red photons applied at night convert phytochromes to the active far-red absorbing form (Pfr), leading to inhibition of flowering. Far-red photons (greater than 700 nm) re-induce flowering when applied after a pulse of red photons during the dark period. However, far-red photons at sufficiently high intensity and duration delay flowering in sensitive species. Mechanistically, this response occurs because phytochrome-red (Pr) absorbance is not zero beyond 700 nm. We applied nighttime photons from near infrared (NIR) LEDs (peak 850 nm) over a 12 h dark period. Flowering was delayed in Glycine max and Cannabis sativa (two photosensitive species) by 3 and 12 days, respectively, as the flux of photons from NIR LEDs was increased up to 83 and 116 μmol m-2 s-1. This suggests that long wavelength photons from NIR LEDs can activate phytochromes (convert Pr to Pfr) and thus alter plant development."

All subjects were screened for PTSD and HRQL using the PTSD Checklist Specific and the HeartQoL questionnaire. We used a generalized structural equation model (GSEM) to examine the independent predictive association of PTSD at baseline with HRQL at follow-up. We also examined the mediating roles of depression, anxiety, and stress at baseline.The prevalence of moderate-to-high PTSD symptoms among 1022 patients at baseline was 27∙0%. Patients with PTSD symptoms reported an approximate 20∙0% lower HRQL at follow-up. The PTSD and HRQL relationship was largely mediated by depressive and anxiety symptoms. It was not materially altered by adjustment for socio-demographic, clinical, and lifestyle factors.Our findings suggest that individuals with a combination of PTSD and depression, or anxiety are potentially faced with poor HRQL as a longer-term outcome of their cardiac disease. In Palestine, psychological disorders are often stigmatized; however, integration of mental health care with cardiac care may offer an entry door for addressing psychological problems in the population. Further studies need to assess the effective mental health interventions for improving quality of life in cardiac patients."
https://openalex.org/W3186478344,"Keyword extraction refers to the process of detecting the most relevant terms and expressions in a given text in a timely manner. In the information explosion era, keyword extraction has attracted increasing attention. The importance of keyword extraction in text summarization, text comparisons, and document categorization has led to an emphasis on graph-based keyword extraction techniques because they can capture more structural information compared to other classic text analysis methods. In this paper, we propose a simple unsupervised text mining approach that aims to extract a set of keywords from a given text and analyze its topic diversity using graph analysis tools. Initially, the text is represented as a directed graph using synonym relationships. Then, community detection and other measures are used to identify keywords in the text. The set of extracted keywords is used to assess topic diversity within the text and analyze its sentiment. The proposed approach relies on grouping semantically similar candidate words. This approach ensures that the set of extracted keywords is comprehensive. Differing from other graph-based keyword extraction approaches, the proposed method does not require user parameters during graph construction and word scoring. The proposed approach achieved significant results compared to other keyword extraction techniques."

This cross-sectional study included all test results obtained at the centre between 25 March 2016 and 24 March 2019. The Alere™ HIV Combo (now rebranded to Determine™ HIV Ultra, from Abbott) was used to detect p24 antigen (p24 Ag) and/or immunoglobulin M (IgM) and G (IgG) antibodies to HIV-1/HIV-2 (HIV Ab). Rapid polymerase chain reaction (PCR) confirmatory testing and Western blot (WB) were performed for clients with a positive rapid test result. Confirmed HIV cases were promptly referred to the HIV unit for care and cART prescription.A total of 12,961 clients attended BCN Checkpoint during the study and 27,298 rapid tests were performed. 450 tests were found to be reactive, of which 430 confirmed as HIV-positive, representing a prevalence of 3.32%. Four confirmed cases (0.93%) were detected as ""p24 Ag only"", nine (2.09%) as ""both p24 and HIV Ab"" and 417 (96.98%) as ""HIV Ab only"". The ""p24 Ag only"" group had a 1-log higher viral load than the other groups and initiated treatment on the following working day. Overall, there were 20 false-positive results (0.07% and 4.44% of total and reactive tests, respectively), of which 10 positive for ""p24 Ag only"" and 10 for ""HIV Ab only"".Four Acute HIV Infections (AHI), with very high viral loads, have been detected with the ""p24 Ag only"" while the HIV Ab were still absent.

https://openalex.org/W3186752232,"Background Nephrotic syndrome (NS) is associated with increased risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE). Guidelines suggest prophylactic anticoagulants to patients with high risk of thrombosis and low risk of bleeding, but the evidence behind this is poor. This study aims to investigate the effectiveness and risks of prophylactic anticoagulants (PAC) and investigate risk factors for VTE and bleeding in NS. Methods A retrospective medical records study including adults with NS, biopsy proven glomerular disease in the county of Västernorrland, Sweden. Outcomes were VTE, bleeding and death. Patients divided into PAC- and no PAC group were compared using Fisher’s exact test. Patient time was divided into serum/plasma(S/P)-albumin intervals (&lt;20g/L and ≥20g/L) and VTE- and bleeding rates were calculated. Results In 95 included NS patients (PAC = 40, no PAC = 55), 7 VTE (7.4%) and 17 bleedings (18%) were found. Outcomes didn’t differ significantly between the PAC and no PAC group. Time with S/P-albumin &lt;20g/L conferred higher rates/100 years of VTE (IRR 21.7 (95%CI 4.5–116.5)) and bleeding (IRR 5.0 (1.4–14.7)), compared to time with S/P-albumin&gt;20g/L. Conclusion Duration of severe hypoalbuminemia (S/P-albumin &lt;20g/L) in NS is a risk factor for both VTE and bleeding. There is a need for randomized controlled studies regarding the benefit of PAC in NS as well as risk factors of thrombosis and bleeding in NS."

There is a high risk of self-medication on the general population, mainly in South America. This phenomenon has been increasing with the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, generating concerns, and anxieties in people, especially during the period of confinement. The present study used an online survey to determine the standard self-medication practices, risk, and medication-severity-index of the Ecuadorian confinement population. This study is a quantitative descriptive analysis survey designed by pharmacists and medical professionals for the self-medication during the confinement. A total of 400 Ecuadorian adults were recruited, and 380 adults accepted the digital informed consent, regardless of whether or not they had had symptoms of COVID19 during the quarantine. The survey platform used was Google Forms, and the digital social networks (WhatsApp, Facebook) were its broadcast medium. The inclusion criteria were adults who respect the confinement conditions. We excluded health professionals or who were already taking long-term medication. The data were analyzed by R, and the Hazard-Risk-Assessment-Score (HRAS) used the analysis of clinically relevant questions. There is a high risk of drug-related problems, despite the high level of education of the surveyed population (63.1% third level and 26.72% 4th level). The 55% of the surveyed Ecuadorian population had an extreme risk of self-medication (HRAS25 points), 35% prefer a drug therapy recommendation of TV, Social networks, and influencer, instead of Health professional (HRAS 20 points, moderate risk), and 39% ends up their medication before recommendations of a health professional (doctor or pharmaceutical), meaning in a moderate risk of self-medication (HRAS 12 points).

Investigating this in developing communities such as ours helps to contribute to existing understanding of these lesions. Methods and findings Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded CRC colectomy tissues and their corresponding non-tumour margins of resected tissues were sectioned and stained with COX-2 antibody. Adenomatous polyp tissues from non-cancer bearing individuals were similarly processed for comparison. COX-2 expression was scored for percentage (&lt; 5% = 0; 6%-25% = 1; 26%-50% = 2; 51%-75% = 3; 76%-100% = 4) and intensity (no staining = 0; yellow = 2; yellowish-brown = 3, brown = 4). Total immunoscore (percentage + intensity score) ≥ 2 was regarded as positive COX-2 expression. Outcome was statistically evaluated with clinicopathological data to determine COX-2 expression-associated and predictor variables. Ninety-five CRC cases and 27 matched non-tumour tissues as well as 31 adenomatous polyps met the inclusion criteria. Individuals with CRC had a mean age of 56.1 ± 12.6 years while those with adenomatous polyps had a median age of 65 years (range 43–88). COX-2 was differentially overexpressed in CRCs (69/95; 72.6%) and in adenomatous polyps (17/31; 54.8%) than in non-tumour tissues 5/27 (18.5%); p &lt; 0.001). The difference in COX-2 expression between CRC and polyps was non-significant ( p &gt; 0.065). Tumour grade, advanced pT-stage, tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes, and dirty necrosis were also significantly associated with COX-2 expression ( p &lt; 0.035; 0.043, 0.035 and 0.004, respectively). Only dirty necrosis and Crohns-like lymphocytic aggregates predicted COX-2 expression ( p &lt; 0.05). Conclusion This study showed a progressive increase in COX-2 expression from normal to adenomatous polyp and CRC tissues, this being associated with poorer prognostic indicators. Although COX-2 appears early in CRC, it may play a secondary role in promoting tumour growth and invasiveness."

Given the vast unmet need for obesity treatment, an important question is whether PIGB treatment is cost-effective-either stand-alone or as a bridge to bariatric surgery.We developed a microsimulation model to compare the costs and effectiveness of six treatment strategies: PIGB, gastric bypass or sleeve gastrectomy as stand-alone treatments, PIGB as a bridge to gastric bypass or sleeve gastrectomy, and no treatment.PIGB as a bridge to bariatric surgery is less costly and more effective than bariatric surgery alone as it helps to achieve a lower post-operative BMI. Of the six strategies, PIGB as a bridge to sleeve gastrectomy is the most cost-effective with an ICER of $3,781 per QALY gained. While PIGB alone is not cost-effective compared with bariatric surgery, it is cost-effective compared with no treatment with an ICER of $21,711 per QALY.PIGB can yield cost savings and improve health outcomes if used as a bridge to bariatric surgery and is cost-effective as a stand-alone treatment for patients lacking access or unwilling to undergo surgery."

The Ministry of Health Tobacco Control Unit proposed increasing WL size to 80%, removing colours and flavour imagery from WTPs, and plain packaging to help curb the rising epidemic of waterpipe tobacco smoking. Therefore, we measured the perceived efficacy of existing against novel enhanced (generic and waterpipe-specific) WTP WLs and the associated factors among Egyptian waterpipe smokers and nonsmokers.A purposive quota sample of 2014 adults was surveyed in two rounds using face interviews. At each round, participants were randomly shown one of four existing WLs, then one of four novel WLs. Participants rated the perceived efficacy of existing and novel WLs regarding the salience, depth of processing, affective reactions, credibility, relevance, perceived harm and perceived behavioural control. Data were analysed using Generalized Estimating Equations.Participants rated novel WTP WLs with higher mean perceived efficacy scores than existing WLs for all measures, although both sets collectively scored modestly (59.7; 95% CI: 58.9-60.5 vs 53.0; 95% CI: 52.1-54.0, respectively; p<0.001). Relative to the existing WTP WLs, novel WLs were particularly able to induce higher salience, affective reactions, and depth of processing. Relative to the generic novel WTP WLs, waterpipe-specific WLs induced higher relevance, perceived harm, and affective reactions. Nonsmokers scored higher than waterpipe tobacco smokers, specifically for perceived behavioral control (65.0±32.5 vs 43.6±19.8, respectively; p<0.001). WTP WLs featuring proximal risks, such as dental effects (β = 9.70; 95% CI: 7.00-12.40), fetal harm (β = 9.42; 95% CI: 6.75-12.10), or toxic contents (β = 9.14; 95% CI: 6.58-11.70) were strongly associated with participants' perceived efficacy scores. Among other independent factors, rural residence (β = 24.09; 95% CI: 22.21-25.97), being a nonsmoker (β = 10.51; 95% CI: 8.92-12.10), survey round 2 (β = 6.96, 95% CI: 5.73-8.19), the novel WTP WL set (β = 6.68; 95% CI: 6.19-7.17), and having higher education (β = 6.31; 95% CI: 4.34-8.27) were highly associated with participants' perceived efficacy scores.Waterpipe-specific WLs on plain WTPs that feature proximal risks and address different population subgroups need to be developed in conjunction with awareness raising campaigns on WTS harms to reinforce the credibility of WTP WLs. Our findings suggest the proposed WTP WL enhancements by the Tobacco Control Unit may support a more effective WTP labelling policy within a comprehensive waterpipe-specific tobacco control framework."
https://openalex.org/W3183880804,"The large intestine provides a compensatory role in energy recovery when surgical interventions such as extensive small intestinal resections or bypass operations lower the efficiency of nutrient absorption in the upper gastrointestinal (GI) tract. While microorganisms in the colon are known to play vital roles in recovering energy, their contributions remain to be qualified and quantified in the small intestine resection.We develop a mathematical model that links nutrient absorption in the upper and lower GI tract in two steps.First, we describe the effects of small intestine resection on the ileocecal output (ICO), which enters the colon and provides food for microbes. Second, we describe energy recovered by the colon's microorganisms via short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) production. We obtain model parameters by performing a least-squares regression analysis on clinical data for subjects with normal physiology and those who had undergone small intestine resection.For subjects with their intestines intact, our model provided a metabolizable energy value that aligns well with the traditional Atwater coefficients. With removal of the small intestine, physiological absorption became less efficient, and the metabolizable energy decreased. In parallel, the inefficiencies in physiological absorption by the small intestine are partly compensated by production of short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) from proteins and carbohydrates by microorganisms in the colon. The colon recovered more than half of the gross energy intake when the entire small intestine was removed. Meanwhile, the quality of energy absorbed changed, because microbe-derived SCFAs, not the original components of food, become the dominant form of absorbed energy.The mathematical model developed here provides an important framework for describing the effect of clinical interventions on the colon's microorganisms."
https://openalex.org/W3185619559,"While biologging tags have answered a wealth of ecological questions, the drivers and consequences of movement and activity often remain difficult to ascertain, particularly marine vertebrates which are difficult to observe directly. Basking sharks, the second largest shark species in the world, aggregate in the summer in key foraging sites but despite advances in biologging technologies, little is known about their breeding ecology and sub-surface behaviour. Advances in camera technologies holds potential for filling in these knowledge gaps by providing environmental context and validating behaviours recorded with conventional telemetry. Six basking sharks were tagged at their feeding site in the Sea of Hebrides, Scotland, with towed cameras combined with time-depth recorders and satellite telemetry. Cameras recorded a cumulative 123 hours of video data over an average 64-hour deployment and confirmed the position of the sharks within the water column. Feeding events only occurred within a metre depth and made up ¾ of the time spent swimming near the surface. Sharks maintained similar tail beat frequencies regardless of whether feeding, swimming near the surface or the seabed, where they spent surprisingly up to 88% of daylight hours. This study reported the first complete breaching event and the first sub-surface putative courtship display, with nose-to-tail chasing, parallel swimming as well as the first observation of grouping behaviour near the seabed. Social groups of sharks are thought to be very short term and sporadic, and may play a role in finding breeding partners, particularly in solitary sharks which may use aggregations as an opportunity to breed. In situ observation of basking sharks at their seasonal aggregation site through animal borne cameras revealed unprecedented insight into the social and environmental context of basking shark behaviour which were previously limited to surface observations."
https://openalex.org/W3185742321,"Objectives The aim of this study was to examine the effect of speed on mechanical energy fluctuations and propulsion mechanics in the double-poling (DP) technique of cross-country skiing. Methods Kinematics and dynamics were acquired while fourteen male skiers performed roller-skiing DP on a treadmill at increasing speeds (15, 21 and 27 km∙h -1 ). Kinetic (E kin ), potential (E pot ), and total (E body ) body mechanical energy and pole power (P pole ) were calculated. Inverse dynamics was used to calculate arm power (P arm ). Trunk+leg power (P T+L ) was estimated, as was the power associated with body movements perpendicular to goal-direction ( <mml:math xmlns:mml=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"" display=""inline"" id=""M1""><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mover><mml:mtext>E</mml:mtext><mml:mo>.</mml:mo></mml:mover></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>body</mml:mtext></mml:mrow><mml:mo>⊥</mml:mo></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:math> ). Results E kin and E pot fluctuated out-of-phase throughout the cycle, at first sight indicating that pendulum-like behaviour occurs partly in DP. However, during the swing phase, the increase in E pot (body heightening) was mainly driven by positive P T+L , while the decrease in E kin was lost to rolling friction, and during the poling phase, considerable positive P arm generation occurs. Thus, possible exchange between E kin and E pot seem not to occur as directly and passively as in classic pendulum locomotion (walking). During the poling phase, <mml:math xmlns:mml=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"" display=""inline"" id=""M2""><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mover><mml:mtext>E</mml:mtext><mml:mo>.</mml:mo></mml:mover></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>body</mml:mtext></mml:mrow><mml:mo>⊥</mml:mo></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:math> fluctuated out-of-phase with P pole , indicating a transfer of body energy to P pole . In this way, power generated by trunk+leg mainly during the swing phase (body heightening) can be used in the poling phase as pole power. At all speeds, negative P T+L occurred during the poling phase, suggesting energy absorption of body energy not transferred to pole power. Thus, DP seem to resemble bouncing ball-like behaviour more than pendulum at faster speeds. Over the cycle, P arm contribution to P pole (external power) was 63% at 15 km∙h -1 and 66% at 21 and 27 km∙h -1 , with the remainder being P T+L contribution. Conclusions When speed increases in level DP, both power production and absorption by trunk+leg actions increase considerably. This enhanced involvement of the legs at faster speeds is likely a prerequisite for effective generation of pole power at high speeds with very short poling times. However, the relative trunk+leg power contribution did not increase at the speeds studied here."
https://openalex.org/W3186457495,"Excessive sodium intake is known to increase the risk for hypertension, heart disease, and stroke. Individuals who are more susceptible to the effects of high salt are at higher risk for cardiovascular diseases even independent of their blood pressure status. Local activation of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) in the brain, among other mechanisms, has been hypothesized to play a key role in contributing to salt balance. We have previously shown that deletion of the alternative renin isoform termed renin-b disinhibits the classical renin-a encoding preprorenin in the brain resulting in elevated brain RAS activity. Thus, we hypothesized that renin-b deficiency results in higher susceptibility to salt-induced elevation in blood pressure. Telemetry implanted Ren-bNull and wildtype littermate mice were first offered a low salt diet for a week and subsequently a high salt diet for another week. A high salt diet induced a mild blood pressure elevation in both Ren-bNull and wildtype mice, but mice lacking renin-b did not exhibit an exaggerated pressor response. When renin-b deficient mice were exposed to a high salt diet for a longer duration (4 weeks), there was a trend for increased myocardial enlargement in Ren-bNull mice when compared with control mice, but this did not reach statistical significance. Multiple studies have also demonstrated the association of environmental stress with hypertension. Activation of the RAS in the rostral ventrolateral medulla and the hypothalamus is required for stress-induced hypertension. Thus, we next questioned whether the lack of renin-b would result in exacerbated response to an acute restraint-stress. Wildtype and Ren-bNull mice equally exhibited elevated blood pressure in response to restraint-stress, which was similar in mice fed either a low or high salt diet. These studies suggest that mechanisms unrelated to salt and acute stress alter the cardiovascular phenotype in mice lacking renin-b."

It belongs to the Badis badis species group but can be easily distinguished from its congeners, except from B. kanabos and B. tuivaiei, in having a dark blotch on the dorsal fin between the base of 3rd to 5th spines. It is further distinguished from B. kanabos in having more scales in lateral row (27-30 vs. 25-26), more circumpeduncular scale rows (18-20 vs. 16-17) and smaller eye (7.5-8.9% SL vs. 9.5-12.7); and from B. tuivaiei in having fewer vertebrae (28-29 vs. 30-31) and more rakers on the first gill arch (9 vs. 6-8). The analysis of the mitochondrial DNA (coi and cytb) revealed the distinctness of B. kaladanensis from all other Badis species with the interspecific distance ranges from 5.4-20.4%.

https://openalex.org/W3184246896,"Continuous monitoring of an electrocardiogram (ECG) in private diagnostic spaces such as vehicles or apartments allows early detection of cardiovascular diseases. We will use an armchair with integrated capacitive electrodes to record the capacitive electrocardiogram (cECG) during everyday activities. However, movements and other artifacts affect the signal quality. Therefore, an artifact index is needed to detect artifacts and classify the cECG. The unavailability of cECG data and reliable ground truth information requires new recordings to develop an artifact index. This study is designed to test the hypothesis: an artifact index can be devised, which intends to estimate the signal quality of segments and classify signals. In a single-arm study with 44 subjects, we will record two activities of 11-minute duration: reading and watching television. During recording, we will capture cECG, ECG, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) with time synchronization as well as keypoint-based movement indicators obtained from a video camera. SpO2 provides additional information on the subject's health status. The keypoint-based movements indicate artifacts in the cECG. We will combine all ground truth data to evaluate the index. In the future, we aim at using the artifact index to exclude cECG segments with artifacts from further analysis. This will improve cECG technology for the measurement of cardiovascular parameters."
https://openalex.org/W3186612004,"Stable flies (Stomoxys calcitrans) are blood-sucking insects commonly associated with cattle production systems worldwide and are known to cause severe irritation to cattle due to painful bites. Cattle react to biting stable flies with an aggregating behavior known as bunching. Bunching behavior reduces grazing or feed consumption and thus reduces cattle productivity and welfare. Cattle's fly-repelling behaviors include foot stomping, head tossing, tail switching and skin twitching. A longitudinal study was conducted in 2017 on 20 California dairies (average lactating herd size = 2,466 (SE±28.392)) during the stable fly season from April to July. The study objectives were to estimate the association between environmental factors and dairy characteristics including facility design, feed and manure management, total mixed ration (TMR) components fed to cattle, and operational pest management procedures and the outcome stable fly activity on California dairies. Stable fly activity was measured by counting stable flies on cow forelimbs (leg count) and on Alsynite traps (trap count) over the 13-week study period. Weekly leg counts were performed for cattle in lactating cow pens (31 pens from 10 study dairies) with counts made during the morning (AM) and again during the afternoon (PM). Trap counts were performed on all 20 study dairies. Data were analyzed using linear mixed models which revealed temporal variation in the average leg and trap counts with stable fly activity increasing from May to June and then decreasing to the lowest activity in July. Leg counts were higher during the afternoon compared to morning. Ambient temperatures ≤30⁰C and relative humidity (RH) measurements <50% were associated with higher leg and trap counts. Traps located at the periphery of study dairies had higher stable fly counts compared to traps located in the interior of the dairy. Cow pens with trees on the periphery had higher leg counts in comparison to pens away from trees. Specific TMR components were associated with both leg and trap counts. Dairies feeding by-products including almond hulls, wet distillers' grain, fruits, and vegetables had higher trap counts compared to dairies that did not feed these ingredients. At the pen level, pens with rations that contained straw had lower average leg counts compared to pens fed with rations that did not contain straw. A similar association was observed for pens with rations that contained wheat silage when ambient temperatures were ≤30⁰C. In contrast, pens with water added to the TMR while the RH was ≥50% had higher average leg counts compared to pens without water added to the TMR. Dairies that applied insecticides for fly control to their entire facility had lower trap counts compared to dairies that did not apply insecticides. Stable fly activity measured on California dairies using leg and trap counts varied according to the month, environmental factors, pen surroundings, trap location, TMR components, and insecticide use."

https://openalex.org/W3185888377,"Previous literature has shown that social identity influences consumer decision-making towards branded products. However, its influence on ones’ own sensory perception of an ingroup (or outgroup) associated brand’s product (i.e. sponsor) is seldom documented and little understood. Here, we investigate the impact of social identity (i.e. team identification) with a football team on the sensorial experience and willingness to buy a beverage, said to be sponsoring the ingroup or the outgroup team. Ninety subjects participated in one of three sensorial experience conditions (matched identity: ingroup beverage; mismatched identity: outgroup beverage; control: no group preference). Each participant tasted the new sponsoring beverage and answered a questionnaire about their subjective sensorial experience of the beverage. EEG and BVP were synchronously collected throughout. Analyses revealed that team identification does not influence subjective responses and only slightly modulates physiological signals. All participants reported high valence and arousal values while physiological signals consistently translated negative affects across groups, which showed that participants reported to be happy/excited about trying the beverage while their physiological signals showed that they were feeling sad/depressed/angry. Crucially, despite a similar sensorial experience, and similar socially desirable report of the subjective experience, only participants in the matched identity group demonstrate higher willingness to buy, showing that the level of team identification, but not taste or beverage quality, influences willingness to buy the said sponsor’s product."
https://openalex.org/W3186197684,"Pull-out testing was carried out to evaluate the effects of shape, size and concentration of steel aggregates on anchorage performance. Steel grit with particle sizes of 1.5, 2.0, and 2.8 mm and steel shot diameters of 1.4, 2.0, and 2.5 mm were used as steel aggregates and were added into the resin anchoring agent. For each kind of steel aggregate, either 30, 40 or 50 aggregates were used to evaluate the effects of different steel aggregate densities. Anchorage specimens were prepared using ϕ20mm rebar bolts and steel sleeves. Compressive and shear strengths of resin containing steel aggregates, the pullout curve, and the circumferential strain of the sleeves were measured, and the energy consumption was calculated. Results show that compressive and shear strengths of resin containing steel grit and steel shot are increased by 8.4%-17.0% compared to pure resin. For the aggregate numbers of 30, 40 and 50, the anchoring force is increased by 7.9%, 7.5% and 6.5%; energy consumption is increased by 19.2%, 15.0% and 18.6%; and the circumferential strain of the specimen is increased by 28.4%, 25.1% and 39.5%, respectively. The effect of aggregate size on anchoring performance is significant; that is, the aggregate sizes of 1.4~1.5, 2.0 and 2.5~2.8 mm increase the anchoring force, energy consumption and sleeve circumferential strain by 8.5%, 4.6% and 8.7%, 16.0%, 8.4% and 28.4%, and 17.9%, 23.3% and 51.9%, respectively. The relationships of the anchoring force, energy consumption, and circumferential strain with steel aggregate quantity and size are formulated. Results show that the addition of steel aggregates increases the compressive and shear strengths of the resin, and steel aggregate quantity and size have significant impact on anchoring performance. This paper provides the basis for optimization of resin anchoring agents used in the mining industry. The impact of anchoring agent shear strength and residual shear strength on the anchoring effect were also discussed based on the failure analysis of the anchoring section."
