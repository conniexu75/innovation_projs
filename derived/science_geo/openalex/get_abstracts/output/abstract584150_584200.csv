Polyakov et al. show that this region is also evolving toward a state of weakened stratification with increased vertical mixing, release of oceanic heat, and less sea ice. These changes could have considerable impacts on other geophysical and biogeochemical aspects of the Arctic Ocean system and presage a fundamentally new Arctic climate state.

Here, we show that, during necroptosis, MLKL-dependent calcium (Ca2+) influx and phosphatidylserine (PS) exposure on the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane preceded loss of PM integrity. Activation of MLKL results in the generation of broken, PM ""bubbles"" with exposed PS that are released from the surface of the otherwise intact cell. The ESCRT-III machinery is required for formation of these bubbles and acts to sustain survival of the cell when MLKL activation is limited or reversed. Under conditions of necroptotic cell death, ESCRT-III controls the duration of plasma membrane integrity. As a consequence of the action of ESCRT-III, cells undergoing necroptosis can express chemokines and other regulatory molecules and promote antigenic cross-priming of CD8+ T cells."
https://openalex.org/W2604200375,"Chromatin architecture is fundamental in regulating gene expression. To investigate when spatial genome organization is first established during development, we examined chromatin conformation during Drosophila embryogenesis and observed the emergence of chromatin architecture within a tight time window that coincides with the onset of transcription activation in the zygote. Prior to zygotic genome activation, the genome is mostly unstructured. Early expressed genes serve as nucleation sites for topologically associating domain (TAD) boundaries. Activation of gene expression coincides with the establishment of TADs throughout the genome and co-localization of housekeeping gene clusters, which remain stable in subsequent stages of development. However, the appearance of TAD boundaries is independent of transcription and requires the transcription factor Zelda for locus-specific TAD boundary insulation. These results offer insight into when spatial organization of the genome emerges and identify a key factor that helps trigger this architecture."

Here, we developed a culture medium with polar metabolite concentrations comparable to those of human plasma (human plasma-like medium [HPLM]). Culture in HPLM, relative to that in traditional media, had widespread effects on cellular metabolism, including on the metabolome, redox state, and glucose utilization. Among the most prominent was an inhibition of de novo pyrimidine synthesis-an effect traced to uric acid, which is 10-fold higher in the blood of humans than of mice and other non-primates. We find that uric acid directly inhibits uridine monophosphate synthase (UMPS) and consequently reduces the sensitivity of cancer cells to the chemotherapeutic agent 5-fluorouracil. Thus, media that better recapitulates the composition of human plasma reveals unforeseen metabolic wiring and regulation, suggesting that HPLM should be of broad utility."
https://openalex.org/W2605003947,"Of all known cultured stem cell types, pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) sit atop the landscape of developmental potency and are characterized by their ability to generate all cell types of an adult organism. However, PSCs show limited contribution to the extraembryonic placental tissues in vivo. Here, we show that a chemical cocktail enables the derivation of stem cells with unique functional and molecular features from mice and humans, designated as extended pluripotent stem (EPS) cells, which are capable of chimerizing both embryonic and extraembryonic tissues. Notably, a single mouse EPS cell shows widespread chimeric contribution to both embryonic and extraembryonic lineages in vivo and permits generating single-EPS-cell-derived mice by tetraploid complementation. Furthermore, human EPS cells exhibit interspecies chimeric competency in mouse conceptuses. Our findings constitute a first step toward capturing pluripotent stem cells with extraembryonic developmental potentials in culture and open new avenues for basic and translational research.

This study uncovers a general and widespread link between transcription and translation that is governed by epigenetic modification of mRNAs. Transcription of genome-encoded information into mRNA and translation of mRNA into a functional protein are the main layers of gene expression. Due to the existential need to adjust gene expression to both intracellular requirements and extracellular stimuli, both processes are subject to regulation at multiple levels. Transcription is a highly controlled process that is extensively regulated at the levels of initiation, elongation, and termination. Recent studies in eukaryotes have linked transcription to other levels of mRNA regulation, such as alternative splicing (Dujardin et al., 2014Dujardin G. Lafaille C. de la Mata M. Marasco L.E.

Although splicing and polyadenylation are thought to be co-transcriptional, and therefore could be directly affected by the RNAPII dynamics, the effect on translation and degradation, which have distinct spatial and temporal dynamics, is more complicated to perceive. A recently formulated model explains the imprinting role of transcription by co-transcriptional recruitment of coordinator proteins (Haimovich et al., 2013Haimovich G. Choder M. Singer R.H. Trcek T.

Acta. 2013; 1829: 643-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), which accompany the synthesized transcript and are capable of regulating its future fate. Translation of mRNAs is controlled mainly via initiation (Sonenberg and Hinnebusch, 2009Sonenberg N. Hinnebusch A.G.

In general, transcription and translation are still regarded as mutually independent processes, characterized by different timings, cellular locations, functional complexes, and mechanisms of action. N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is considered to be one of the most abundant RNA modifications, detected in thousands of human transcripts (Dominissini et al., 2012Dominissini D. Moshitch-Moshkovitz S.

Overall, a growing body of evidence suggests that m6A plays an important role in multiple levels of mRNA regulation. In this study, we tested a hypothesis suggesting a direct flow of information from transcription to translation. Combining an unbiased screen for examination of the effect of human promoters on mRNA translation and genome-wide analyses, we identified a positive correlation between mRNA expression and translation efficiency (TE) and found that rate of transcription positively affects TE. Moreover, we observed that transcriptional dynamics are reflected in the relative deposition of m6A on mRNAs that affects translation. This study establishes a general and robust link between transcription and translation of mRNAs and provides a mechanistic insight regarding the way transcription epigenetically imprints mRNA molecules. To examine the relationship between transcription and translation, we set out to determine the effect of different human promoters on the translation of a reporter gene (Renilla luciferase [Rluc]). For this purpose, we defined promoters as 0.5- to 2.5-Kb-long regions characterized by high H3K4Me3 and low H3K4Me1 epigenetic marks upstream of transcriptional start sites (TSSs), supported by RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data of MCF7 cells (Loayza-Puch et al., 2013Loayza-Puch F. Drost J. Rooijers K. Lopes R. Elkon R. Agami R. p53 induces transcriptional and translational programs to suppress cell proliferation and growth.Genome Biol. 2013; 14: R32Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). To make our screen versatile and diverse, we cloned promoters from genes connected to stress response, autophagy, ER metabolism, and metastasis, as well as multiple transcription factors. While cloning the promoter sequences, we avoided regions extending downstream the respective TSSs, as these might result in the inclusion of additional 5′ UTRs into the reporter transcripts, potentially complicating the interpretation of results. Because each of the cloned promoters drives the expression of the same reporter gene, we affiliated every promoter with a unique 10 nt barcode (cloned in the 3′ UTR of Rluc) in order to follow its expression in a pool of Rluc mRNAs (Figure S1A). Following these guidelines, we cloned 135 human promoters (Table S1) in order to create a library named Pro-Lib, where most of the promoters were associated with two or more different barcodes to provide higher experimental confidence. As expected, cloned promoter regions substantially induced Rluc expression (Figure S1B). For normalization of expression, Pro-Lib included an additional reporter gene, Firefly luciferase (Fluc), used as an inner control (Figure S1A). Last, we employed an Flp-FRT recombination system and used competent Flp-In MCF7 cells to stably integrate a single copy of a Pro-Lib vector per cell in the identical genetic locus in order to avoid any possible influence of different chromatin neighborhoods on the reporter gene expression. After establishing the library in a stable population, we performed a polysomal profiling experiment by using sucrose gradients, a classical method to separate mRNAs according to the amount of bound ribosomes. Since we examined only the barcoded Rluc mRNAs, their relative segregation in the gradient indicates ribosome density and TE estimation. We named the whole procedure barcoded polysomal profiling, or BPP (Figure 1A). Relative enrichment of Pro-Lib barcodes in the various fractions of the gradient showed that most Rluc mRNAs are localized in the initial polysomal fractions (i.e., 9–12; Figure 1B). Control total RNA segregation showed a characteristic pattern of polysomes and EDTA sensitivity, in line with the known dependence of polysomes on the availability of Mg2+ ions (Figures S1C and S1D). Next, we tested whether BPP can detect changes in TE. For this purpose, we employed Rluc mRNA containing 5′-terminal oligopyrimidine tracts (5′ TOP) derived from RPL37a. Translation of mRNAs possessing 5′ TOP is highly dependent on mTOR activity, resulting in a rapid translational arrest after mTOR inhibition, as compared to other mRNAs (Thoreen et al., 2012Thoreen C.C. Chantranupong L. Keys H.R. Wang T. Gray N.S. Sabatini D.M. A unifying model for mTORC1-mediated regulation of mRNA translation.Nature. 2012; 485: 109-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (975) Google Scholar). Indeed, inhibition of mTORC1 resulted in a global moderate shift of the Rluc mRNAs to fractions 9–11 (e.g., SPTBN1 promoter), whereas a 5′ TOP-containing transcript was depleted from the translated fractions of the gradient (Figure 1C). Interestingly, we also identified several additional Rluc transcripts exhibiting similar hypersensitivity toward the inhibition of mTORC1 (Figure S1E). Further analysis of the sequences adjacent to their TSSs (Figure S1F) identified stretches of pyrimidines that could serve as 5′ TOP signals, providing a probable explanation for their dramatic response. To further test detection capabilities of BPP, we examined the effect of splicing on TE. Indeed, we observed that spliced Rluc mRNA shifts to heavier polysomal fractions and yields more protein (Figure 1D), as expected from the known positive effect of splicing on translation (Nott et al., 2004Nott A. Le Hir H. Moore M.J. Splicing enhances translation in mammalian cells: an additional function of the exon junction complex.Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 210-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). Altogether, our control experiments demonstrate that BPP is capable of examining multiple Rluc mRNAs in bulk and detecting changes in TE of individual transcripts. Inspecting the segregation of the barcoded Rluc mRNAs on sucrose gradients, we identified 12 promoters that caused a shift of the reporter transcript toward higher ribosomal occupancy fractions in at least two independent experiments. Intriguingly, four of these promoters contained a TATA-box element (Figure 2A) and four others had TA-rich sequences that could potentially serve as non-canonical TATA boxes (Figure S2A), indicating that this promoter element could positively influence translation. To test this possibility, we supplied several TATA-less promoters with an artificial TATA element (consisting of the TATA sequence followed by the short downstream sequence derived from human ACTB). In all cases, this manipulation resulted in Rluc transcripts occupying denser fractions of the gradient (i.e., 11–13; Figures 2B and S2B), supporting the previous observations. Taking the ASNSD1 promoter as a model, we observed a positive effect of TATA addition on TE under various conditions (Figure S2C), thus indicating a robust phenomenon.Figure S2Effect of TATA Box on TE, Related to Figure 2Show full caption(A) Pro-Lib vectors encoding for promoters with TA-rich regions at their 3′ ends result in Rluc mRNAs shifted to the denser fractions of the gradient, compared to other transcripts (e.g., under SPTBN1 promoter).(B) Average standardized profiles of polysome fractions for the TATA+/TATA- paired constructs in Pro-Lib.(C) Promoter region of ASNSD1 gene yields better translated Rluc mRNAs when supplemented with an artificial TATA box at its 3′end.

Because artificial introduction of TATA may alter the TSS, possibly impacting translational capacity (Rojas-Duran and Gilbert, 2012Rojas-Duran M.F. Gilbert W.V. Alternative transcription start site selection leads to large differences in translation activity in yeast.RNA. 2012; 18: 2299-2305Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), we investigated in detail the 5′ UTRs produced from the TATA-containing and TATA-less promoter pairs. By northern blotting, we observed that most of the tested promoters resulted in reporter transcripts of a similar length, with a noticeable enhancement of mRNA levels in TATA-containing promoters (Figure 2C). To establish precisely the 5′ ends of the transcripts, we performed 5′ rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) analyses, which showed a very narrow peak ∼25 nt downstream of the inserted TATA element (Figures S3A and S3B). To test whether these alterations in the 5′ UTRs could explain the observed changes in translation, we in vitro synthesized Rluc transcripts bearing the different 5′ UTRs and examined their relative TE (Figure S3C). Given that the 5′ UTR generated after the insertion of TATA sequence did not confer higher TE, we conclude that the observed positive effect of TATA on translation is unlikely to stem from the differences in the 5′ UTRs of Rluc mRNAs. So far, we have inferred TE from ribosome occupancy measurements reflected by migration within sucrose gradients. Next, we tested TE changes by measuring separately the levels of the reporter mRNA and protein in the promoter pairs. As expected, we observed significantly more mRNA produced from TATA-containing promoters (7- to 9-fold, Figure 2D), consistent with the levels measured by northern blotting (Figure 2C). In contrast, the increase in the level of protein activity was significantly higher (>20-fold), supporting the connection between the presence of TATA in promoter and enhanced protein production. To further test the role of the TATA element in translation, we mutagenized it within the SV40 promoter. Remarkably, loss of TATA reduced the reporter mRNA expression by ∼14-fold and protein activity by ∼80-fold (Figure 2E), suggesting reduced TE. Indeed, mRNA produced by a TATA-mutated promoter was enriched in the lighter polysomal fractions (Figure 2F), further supporting this indication. We observed similar results upon mutagenesis of TATA in other promoters (Figures S2D and S2E), suggesting that this effect is not restricted to any particular promoter. Next, we tested whether the positive effect of TATA on TE also applies to the endogenous mammalian gene expression. For this purpose, we chose c-Myc, a ubiquitously expressed gene with a single active TATA-positive promoter in MCF7 cells (Figure S2F) and used the CRISPR-Cas9 system to alter its TATA sequence (Figure 2G). This strategy yielded isolated cell clones with disrupted c-Myc TATA on most of their alleles (Figure 2G and Figure S2G). Examination of c-Myc expression in these clones revealed a reduction of ∼25% in c-Myc mRNA and ∼50% in both protein activity and expression (Figures 2H and 2I and S2I and S2J). Moreover, polysomal profiling of c-Myc transcripts showed reduced ribosomal occupancy upon mutation of the TATA element (Figures 2J and S2H), whereas a control transcript displayed very similar profiles in both clones (Figure S2K), indicating a c-Myc-specific effect. Thus, we conclude that the presence of the TATA element in a promoter enhances the efficiency of mRNA translation and note the validity of this observation to multiple promoters and genes. In all the cases we studied, presence of TATA in a promoter stimulated both mRNA expression levels and TE. To examine whether TE positively correlates with mRNA expression levels, we clustered the Pro-Lib BPP data to separate the transcripts of our library into two relative groups, one with lower TE (Figures S4A and S4B) and another with higher TE (Figures S4C and S4D), and compared the expression levels between these two groups. Indeed, we found that transcripts with higher TE tend to be more abundant (Figure 3A). To test whether this coupling is TATA dependent, we repeated this analysis while omitting the promoters with artificially added TATA elements. Notably, this analysis yielded similar albeit less significant results (Figure 3B), thus suggesting a positive correlation between the abundance of Rluc transcripts and their TE, with no dependency on TATA. To further test this observation, we employed cells expressing an inducible version of the barcoded reporter gene (TRex-Rluc), in which the levels of Rluc mRNA are stimulated ∼17-fold after induction (Figure 3C). Importantly, induction of this gene yielded a significantly greater enhancement of protein activity (∼60-fold, Figure 3C), suggesting a translational boost. Indeed, subsequent BPP analysis revealed a strong increase in the ribosome occupancy of the induced reporter mRNA (Figure 3D and Figure S5A), supporting the notion that increased expression results in higher TE. Notably, we performed 5′ RACE analysis of both induced and non-induced TRex-Rluc mRNAs and found the scattering of TSSs to be very similar (Figure S3D). Altogether, we conclude that the observed link between the expression levels of mRNAs and their TE is not restricted to the TATA element and might therefore represent a more general phenomenon.Figure 3Levels of mRNAs Positively Correlate with TE but Do Not Dictate ItShow full caption(A) Reporter mRNAs from the Pro-Lib screen were separated into groups with relatively high or low TE (derived from the polysomal profiles, see Figure S4) and compared with their expression levels (estimated from read counts observed for each vector over all fractions). p values calculated using Wilcoxon’s test.(B) Same comparison as described in (A) was performed after exclusion of mRNAs transcribed from promoters with artificial TATA element.(C) Levels of mRNA and protein resulting from the induced TRex-Rluc gene were measured and plotted relatively to the non-induced condition; data are represented as mean ± SEM of n = 3.(D) BPP examination of either induced or non-induced TRex-Rluc mRNAs; data are represented as mean ± SEM of a characteristic gradient; n > 5, see also Figure S5A.(E) Upper panels: paired RNA-seq and Ribo-seq datasets from different human cell lines were examined for relationship between mRNA expression level and TE (calculated as the (log2) ratio between densities of ribosome footprint and RNA-seq reads).

https://openalex.org/W2604738787,"Cells operate through protein interaction networks organized in space and time. Here, we describe an approach to resolve both dimensions simultaneously by using proximity labeling mediated by engineered ascorbic acid peroxidase (APEX). APEX has been used to capture entire organelle proteomes with high temporal resolution, but its breadth of labeling is generally thought to preclude the higher spatial resolution necessary to interrogate specific protein networks. We provide a solution to this problem by combining quantitative proteomics with a system of spatial references. As proof of principle, we apply this approach to interrogate proteins engaged by G-protein-coupled receptors as they dynamically signal and traffic in response to ligand-induced activation. The method resolves known binding partners, as well as previously unidentified network components. Validating its utility as a discovery pipeline, we establish that two of these proteins promote ubiquitin-linked receptor downregulation after prolonged activation."

Myofibers form when muscle precursor cells, or myoblasts, differentiate and fuse together during embryogenesis. The fusion process is not fully understood. Studying cell culture and mouse models, Bi et al. identified an 84–amino acid peptide that promotes myoblast fusion. This small peptide, called Myomixer, physically interacts with and stimulates the activity of a fusogenic membrane protein called Myomaker. Notably, the Myomaker-Myomixer pair can also promote the fusion of nonmuscle cells, such as fibroblasts. Science , this issue p. 323"
https://openalex.org/W2604831109,"RNA editing, a post-transcriptional process, allows the diversification of proteomes beyond the genomic blueprint; however it is infrequently used among animals for this purpose. Recent reports suggesting increased levels of RNA editing in squids thus raise the question of the nature and effects of these events. We here show that RNA editing is particularly common in behaviorally sophisticated coleoid cephalopods, with tens of thousands of evolutionarily conserved sites. Editing is enriched in the nervous system, affecting molecules pertinent for excitability and neuronal morphology. The genomic sequence flanking editing sites is highly conserved, suggesting that the process confers a selective advantage. Due to the large number of sites, the surrounding conservation greatly reduces the number of mutations and genomic polymorphisms in protein-coding regions. This trade-off between genome evolution and transcriptome plasticity highlights the importance of RNA recoding as a strategy for diversifying proteins, particularly those associated with neural function.

https://openalex.org/W2604924504,"G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) play critical roles in regulating physiological processes ranging from neurotransmission to cardiovascular function. Current methods for tracking GPCR signaling suffer from low throughput, modification or overexpression of effector proteins, and low temporal resolution. Here, we show that peroxidase-catalyzed proximity labeling can be combined with isobaric tagging and mass spectrometry to enable quantitative, time-resolved measurement of GPCR agonist response in living cells. Using this technique, termed GPCR-APEX, we track activation and internalization of the angiotensin II type 1 receptor and the β2 adrenoceptor. These receptors co-localize with a variety of G proteins even before receptor activation, and activated receptors are largely sequestered from G proteins upon internalization. Additionally, the two receptors show differing internalization kinetics, and we identify the membrane protein LMBRD2 as a potential regulator of β2 adrenoceptor signaling, underscoring the value of a dynamic view of receptor function."

Liu et al. found that such communication can also occur between adjacent colonies (see the Perspective by Gordon). Furthermore, colonies that would normally oscillate in synchrony adapted to an environment in which the nutrient supply was limited by growing out of phase with one another. Mathematical modeling and further experiments showed that this kept the colonies from having to compete for the limited nutrient and, counterintuitively, allowed the colonies to grow more quickly than they did with a higher nutrient concentration.

The OM of most Gram-negative bacteria is asymmetric, with an outer leaflet rich in lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and an inner leaflet composed of phospholipids. Much research has uncovered a detailed, but still evolving, picture of how LPS is synthesized, trafficked, and inserted into the OM (May et al., 2015May J.M. Sherman D.J. Simpson B.W. Ruiz N. Kahne D. Lipopolysaccharide transport to the cell surface: periplasmic transport and assembly into the outer membrane.Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol.

Yet, the mechanisms and structural basis of how nascent phospholipids are trafficked between the inner membrane (IM) and OM and how asymmetry between the leaflets of the OM is maintained remain unclear. Proteins of the MCE superfamily (originally thought to mediate mammalian cell entry in M. tuberculosis [Arruda et al., 1993Arruda S. Bomfim G. Knights R. Huima-Byron T. Riley L.W.

MCE proteins are ubiquitous among double-membraned bacteria (Casali and Riley, 2007Casali N. Riley L.W.

MCE systems are thought to drive the transport of hydrophobic molecules from the OM to the IM, although it has also been suggested that they may function as exporters to move molecules toward the OM and the outside of the cell (Kim et al., 1998Kim K. Lee S. Lee K. Lim D. Isolation and characterization of toluene-sensitive mutants from the toluene-resistant bacterium Pseudomonas putida GM73.J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 3692-3696Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Here we report the X-ray and EM structures for the three MCE proteins from E. coli. One MCE protein, MlaD, forms a homo-hexameric ring, is part of a larger multi-protein complex in the IM, and interacts with a periplasmic lipid-carrying protein, which likely shuttles lipids between transport complexes in the IM and OM. In contrast, MCE proteins YebT and PqiB form two different, more elongated structures by stacking hexameric rings together to form barrels and tubes, which result in continuous channels that are of sufficient length to directly span the distances between the IM and OM, without the need for a periplasmic shuttle protein. The distinct architectures of these MCE proteins suggest multiple strategies for moving lipids through the hydrophilic environment of the periplasm. E. coli strain MG1655 contains three MCE genes (Figure 1B): mlaD (maintenance of OM lipid asymmetry D), pqiB (paraquat inducible B), and yebT (also known as MAM7 [Krachler et al., 2011Krachler A.M. Ham H. Orth K. Outer membrane adhesion factor multivalent adhesion molecule 7 initiates host cell binding during infection by gram-negative pathogens.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2011; 108: 11614-11619Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar]). These MCE genes are part of three different operons, each of which also encodes a multipass transmembrane (TM) protein (MlaE, PqiA, and YebS) (Figure 1B). The mla operon also encodes an ABC-type (ATP binding cassette) ATPase (MlaF), a periplasmic protein MlaC, and a STAS domain protein, MlaB, and functions together with an OM lipoprotein, MlaA, encoded elsewhere in the genome (Figure 1B) (Malinverni and Silhavy, 2009Malinverni J.C. Silhavy T.J. An ABC transport system that maintains lipid asymmetry in the gram-negative outer membrane.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2009; 106: 8009-8014Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Mutations in mla genes result in increased sensitivity to a combination of SDS and EDTA (SDS+EDTA), suggestive of an OM defect, which has been attributed to a loss of OM asymmetry (Malinverni and Silhavy, 2009Malinverni J.C. Silhavy T.J. An ABC transport system that maintains lipid asymmetry in the gram-negative outer membrane.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2009; 106: 8009-8014Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). The presence of an ATPase and a multi-pass TM protein in some MCE operons has led to the hypothesis that MCE systems encode a family of ABC transporters (Carpenter et al., 2014Carpenter C.D. Cooley B.J. Needham B.D. Fisher C.R. Trent M.S. Gordon V. Payne S.M. The Vps/VacJ ABC transporter is required for intercellular spread of Shigella flexneri.Infect.

Microbiol. 2012; 83: 1006-1023Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been shown that MlaF, MlaE, MlaD, and MlaB interact to form a complex (MlaFEDB) and that the MCE subunit MlaD binds phospholipids (Thong et al., 2016Thong S. Ercan B. Torta F. Fong Z.Y. Wong H.Y.A. Wenk M.R. Chng S.-S. Defining key roles for auxiliary proteins in an ABC transporter that maintains bacterial outer membrane lipid asymmetry.eLife. 2016; 5: e19042Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), supporting a role in lipid transport. To assess whether other MCE proteins from E. coli may also be involved in lipid transport for the OM, we assayed binding of phospholipids to all three E. coli MCE proteins. Purified MlaD, PqiB, and YebT proteins expressed in E. coli were subjected to chloroform-methanol extraction, and the organic phase was analyzed by thin-layer chromatography (Figure 1C). MlaD, PqiB, and YebT each bound phospholipid species that co-migrated with phosphatidylglycerol (PG), cardiolipin (CL), and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) standards. PG and PE were found to be present in the samples by mass spectrometry and no CL was observed. Thus, all three MCE proteins in E. coli interact with phospholipids, suggesting that the Mla, Pqi, and Yeb systems may all function in lipid transport. To understand how the Mla, Pqi, and Yeb systems may function together to maintain OM integrity, we constructed a triple deletion mutant lacking the putative permease subunit from each operon (ΔmlaE ΔpqiA ΔyebS). The ΔmlaE ΔpqiA ΔyebS mutant is viable and shows no discernible growth defect relative to wild type in liquid LB medium (Figure S1A). Thus, the Mla, Pqi, and Yeb systems are non-essential for E. coli growth in culture despite being critical for resistance to environmental stresses, such as those encountered by pathogens during infection. Like the ΔmlaE single mutant (Figure S1G), the ΔmlaE ΔpqiA ΔyebS mutant was also sensitive to SDS+EDTA (Figure S1H). However, the ΔmlaE ΔpqiA ΔyebS mutant is more susceptible to other OM stressors, such as 5% SDS alone or 100 mM CaCl2 (Figure S1B and S1C). As divalent cations are important for the stabilization of interactions between LPS molecules in the OM, the mutant may be more sensitive to CaCl2 due to an already weakened OM. Exposure of ΔmlaE ΔpqiA ΔyebS mutant cells to the DNA stain DAPI resulted in strong nucleoid staining, whereas staining of wild-type cells was weaker and largely confined to the cell periphery (Figure S1E). This suggests that the barrier function of the OM is compromised in the mutants. Indeed, uptake of ethidium bromide was also elevated in the ΔmlaE ΔpqiA ΔyebS mutant relative to the wild type (Figure S1F), consistent with previous work suggesting that E. coli MCE mutants are more susceptible to hydrophobic antibiotics (Nichols et al., 2011Nichols R.J. Sen S. Choo Y.J. Beltrao P. Zietek M. Chaba R. Lee S. Kazmierczak K.M. Lee K.J. Wong A. et al.Phenotypic landscape of a bacterial cell.Cell. 2011; 144: 143-156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). Staining of live cells with propidium iodide (PI), a DNA dye that only stains cells with a disrupted plasma membrane, confirmed that only a small population of PI-positive cells was present in the ΔmlaE ΔpqiA ΔyebS mutant cultures, suggesting that the IM remains intact (Figure S1E). Overall, these results are consistent with a more severe OM defect in the triple mutant, suggesting that the Mla, Pqi, and Yeb systems, or a combination thereof, act in concert to maintain the integrity of the OM barrier. To better understand the nature of the OM defect in these mutants, we examined intact ΔmlaE ΔpqiA ΔyebS triple-mutant E. coli cells by cryo transmission electron microscopy. Strikingly, most triple-mutant ΔmlaE ΔpqiA ΔyebS cells exhibited cell-surface ruffling, suggestive of gross disorganization of the OM, whereas the IM and OM of wild-type cells were smooth with a well-defined periplasm in between (Figures 1D, S1I, and S1J). This is consistent with results from Streptomyces coelicolor in which mutations in the single MCE gene cluster led to global changes in the cell surface (Clark et al., 2013Clark L.C. Seipke R.F. Prieto P. Willemse J. van Wezel G.P. Hutchings M.I. Hoskisson P.A. Mammalian cell entry genes in Streptomyces may provide clues to the evolution of bacterial virulence.Sci. Rep. 2013; 3: 1109Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), as well as other work suggesting that MCE mutants have altered OM lipid composition (Cantrell et al., 2013Cantrell S.A. Leavell M.D. Marjanovic O. Iavarone A.T. Leary J.A. Riley L.W. Free mycolic acid accumulation in the cell wall of the mce1 operon mutant strain of Mycobacterium tuberculosis.J.

An ABC transport system that maintains lipid asymmetry in the gram-negative outer membrane.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2009; 106: 8009-8014Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Thus, MCE proteins are important for maintaining the morphology of the OM and the uniform spacing between the IM and OM. As MCE proteins have no detectable similarity to proteins of known structure or function, we obtained structural information using a combination of X-ray crystallography and electron microscopy (EM). MlaD is predicted to be anchored to the IM by a single N-terminal TM helix, with its MCE domain residing in the periplasm (Figure 2A). We determined the crystal structure of the complete periplasmic domain of E. coli MlaD (residues 32–183) at 2.85 Å resolution and its core MCE domain at 2.15 Å resolution (Tables S1 and S2; Figure S2B). The MCE core domain adopts a seven-stranded β-barrel fold, encompassing just over 100 residues (Figures 2B and 2C). A search of the Protein Data Bank for structural homologs using DALI (Holm and Rosenström, 2010Holm L. Rosenström P. Dali server: conservation mapping in 3D.Nucleic Acids Res. 2010; 38: W545-W549Crossref PubMed Scopus (3061) Google Scholar) did not identify any other proteins that share this fold, although we identified two classes of similar domains that differ in the arrangement of β strands (Figure S2A).Figure S2Structure of MCE Protein, MlaD, Related to Figure 2Show full caption(A) Topology diagrams highlighting the differences between the MCE domain and the closest structural neighbors in the PDB.(B) Initial electron density map for the core MCE domain of MlaD [32-140] after phasing and density modification using SHELX C/D/E pipeline.

We believe the hexamer is the predominant and perhaps the only functional form in vivo, for three reasons. 1) The complete periplasmic domain crystal structure is hexameric, and it is also hexameric in the context of the larger MlaFEDB complex. Second, PqiB and YebT, two other MCE proteins from E. coli, are only hexameric.

(C) The full-length MlaD ectodomain, which includes an additional ∼45 amino acids at the C terminus that associate to form a helical bundle, forms a single hexameric ring.

(G) 2D class averages from single particle, negative stain electron microscopy are also consistent with a 14 subunit, stacked ring organization for the MCE core domain from MlaD, suggesting that the 14-mer observed in the crystal is also stable in solution. We believe the hexamer is the predominant and perhaps the only functional form in vivo, for three reasons. 1) The complete periplasmic domain crystal structure is hexameric, and it is also hexameric in the context of the larger MlaFEDB complex. Second, PqiB and YebT, two other MCE proteins from E. coli, are only hexameric. Third, the “head-to-head” arrangement of the two stacked rings in the 14-mer places the C-terminal helical bundle from each ring at the interface, resulting in major steric overlap. The six copies of MlaD are assembled into a homo-hexameric ring with the C-terminal α-helical domain extending from one face of the ring (Figure 2D). The interface between subunits consists of two main parts. First, the core MCE domains interact in a “head-to-tail” fashion, mediated primarily by the connecting loops at each end of the β-barrel fold, accounting for more than half (∼900 Å2) of the total interface (1,660 Å2). Second, the C-terminal helical regions from each protomer come together to form a six-helix bundle at the center of the ring (760 Å2 interface). Truncation of the C-terminal α-helical region led to the formation of heptameric instead of hexameric rings (Figures S2C–S2G), suggesting that interactions between the C-terminal α helices may play a role in determining the overall oligomeric state and packing of the MCE subunits. The N terminus of each MCE domain is connected by a short linker to a TM helix, which places the N-terminal face of the ring in close proximity to the negatively charged phospholipid head groups (Figure 2F). Consistent with this orientation, the membrane-facing surface of the ring is considerably more basic than the C-terminal, periplasm-facing side (Figure 2E). The C-terminal helix from each subunit associates to form a hollow six-helix coiled coil, leaving a solvent-accessible channel running through the center of the ring (Figure 2G). This channel is lined with hydrophobic residues and has two notable constriction points: the first is formed by Leu106 and Leu107 at the tip of the β5-β6 loop and the second by Phe150 in the C-terminal helix (Figure 2G). These narrowings, in particular the constriction formed by the Phe150 ring, are reminiscent of the Phe427 Φ clamp in the central pore of anthrax protective antigen, where they play a key role in the transport of protein toxins through the PA translocon (Jiang et al., 2015Jiang J. Pentelute B.L. Collier R.J. Zhou Z.H. Atomic structure of anthrax protective antigen pore elucidates toxin translocation.Nature. 2015; 521: 545-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). At the narrowest point, the channel diameter is ∼6–8 Å, large enough to allow the passage of small hydrophobic molecules like phospholipids or sterols. It should also be noted that the weaker electron density in this region of the crystal structure suggests that these loops are at least somewhat flexible and, therefore, may allow somewhat larger molecules to pass through. Outside of these constriction points, several other residues from the C-terminal helices contribute to the hydrophobic pore lining, including Met141, Leu143, Leu146, Ile147, and Leu149. Based upon its orientation relative to the IM (Figure 2F), this hydrophobic pore through the MlaD ring is poised to function as a channel to facilitate trafficking of small hydrophobic molecules to or from the IM. To test the functional relevance of these pore-lining residues, we made a panel of mutant constructs and asked whether these complement a ΔmlaD mutant strain. MlaD constructs with mutations in the β5-β6 loop were unable to complement a ΔmlaD deletion (approximately isosteric mutation L106N/L107N and L106N/L107N combined with a two- or four-residue loop-shortening deletion; Mut1, Mut2, and Mut3, respectively), suggesting that these pore-lining residues may be especially important for MlaD function (Figure 2H). Removal of the C-terminal helices and disordered region (residues 141–183; Mut5), including most of the hydrophobic residues that make up the pore, also failed to complement the ΔmlaD mutant (Figure 2H). In contrast, mutation of the final pore-lining residue, Phe150, did complement the ΔmlaD mutant (F150N; Mut4; Figure 2H). An MCE protein implicated in lipid transport in plants, TRIGALACTOSYLDIACYLGLYCEROL 2 (TGD2), forms part of a high-molecular-weight complex in the chloroplast IM (Awai et al., 2006Awai K. Xu C.

To assess whether MlaD forms a complex with any of the other Mla proteins, we overexpressed the full mlaFEDCB operon in E. coli (Figure 3A) and determined whether any other Mla proteins co-purify with His-tagged MlaD. After affinity purification and gel filtration (Figure 3B), SDS-PAGE analysis of the purified MlaD sample revealed the presence of three additional proteins forming a stable complex with MlaD (Figure 3C), which were identified by mass spectrometry to be MlaF, MlaE, and MlaB; the co-expressed MlaC protein, however, was absent. Independently, similar results were recently reported (Thong et al., 2016Thong S. Ercan B. Torta F. Fong Z.Y. Wong H.Y.A. Wenk M.R. Chng S.-S.

https://openalex.org/W2604845045,"Effective antiviral protection in multicellular organisms relies on both cell-autonomous and systemic immunity. Systemic immunity mediates the spread of antiviral signals from infection sites to distant uninfected tissues. In arthropods, RNA interference (RNAi) is responsible for antiviral defense. Here, we show that flies have a sophisticated systemic RNAi-based immunity mediated by macrophage-like haemocytes. Haemocytes take up dsRNA from infected cells and, through endogenous transposon reverse transcriptases, produce virus-derived complementary DNAs (vDNA). These vDNAs template de novo synthesis of secondary viral siRNAs (vsRNA), which are secreted in exosome-like vesicles. Strikingly, exosomes containing vsRNAs, purified from haemolymph of infected flies, confer passive protection against virus challenge in naive animals. Thus, similar to vertebrates, insects use immune cells to generate immunological memory in the form of stable vDNAs that generate systemic immunity, which is mediated by the vsRNA-containing exosomes."

We were able to predict causal variants for these expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) that disrupt transcription factor binding and validated a subset of them experimentally. We also identified copy-number variant (CNV) eQTLs, including some that appear to affect gene expression by altering the copy number of intergenic regulatory regions. In addition, we were able to identify effects on gene expression of rare genic CNVs and regulatory single-nucleotide variants and found that reactivation of gene expression on the X chromosome depends on gene chromosomal position. Our work highlights the value of iPSCs for genetic association analyses and provides a unique resource for investigating the genetic regulation of gene expression in pluripotent cells."

These findings endorse an iPSC-based experimental framework to discover functional variants and genes contributing to complex human traits. Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have emerged as a robust unbiased approach to identify SNPs associated with incidence of a particular phenotype or disease (Manolio, 2010Manolio T.A. Genomewide association studies and assessment of the risk of disease.N. Engl. J. Med. 2010; 363: 166-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (1116) Google Scholar). Only a small fraction of GWAS lead variants lie within coding sequence and thus directly implicate a functional gene at a locus; the vast majority of lead SNPs fall in noncoding sequence. Moreover, most of these SNPs are not themselves functional but exist in linkage disequilibrium (LD) with the true functional variants. Because many human disease-associated variants are believed to regulate gene expression, expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) and allele-specific expression (ASE) studies may illuminate potential downstream targets of functional variants. These regulated genes then become candidates for experimental manipulation to ascertain their relevance to the phenotype of interest. However, functional studies elucidating the mechanisms of identified variants have remained a challenge due to the need for laborious experiments and the lack of suitable model systems for noncoding sequence studies. Recently emergent technologies make it feasible to identify and interrogate the function of noncoding variants at eQTL and ASE loci in human model systems. Human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs), especially induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), make it possible to generate cohorts of person-specific, renewable, differentiated cell lines in vitro (Zhu et al., 2011Zhu H. Lensch M.W. Cahan P. Daley G.Q. Investigating monogenic and complex diseases with pluripotent stem cells.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2011; 12: 266-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In theory, when drawn from a population with diverse genotypes of common genetic variants, these cohorts might offer the opportunity to validate known eQTL/ASE loci and discover new eQTL/ASE loci “in the dish.” Massively parallel reporter assays (MPRAs) allow investigators to generate high-complexity pools of reporter constructs where each regulatory element or variant of interest is linked to a synthetic reporter gene that carries an identifying barcode (Melnikov et al., 2012Melnikov A. Murugan A. Zhang X. Tesileanu T. Wang L. Rogov P. Feizi S. Gnirke A. Callan Jr., C.G.

The reporter construct pools are introduced into cells, and the relative transcriptional activities of the individual elements or variants are measured by sequencing the transcribed reporter mRNAs and counting their specific barcodes. This approach can be used to rapidly profile the regulatory activity of thousands of variants at GWAS loci (Tewhey et al., 2016Tewhey R. Kotliar D. Park D.S. Liu B. Winnicki S. Reilly S.K. Andersen K.G. Mikkelsen T.S. Lander E.S. Schaffner S.F. Sabeti P.C.

Systematic functional dissection of common genetic variation affecting red blood cell traits.Cell. 2016; 165: 1530-1545Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Finally, advances in genome-editing technologies—most notably clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-CRISPR-associated 9 (Cas9) systems—have opened up new avenues to rigorously assess the functional impact of genetic variation (Musunuru, 2013Musunuru K. Genome editing of human pluripotent stem cells to generate human cellular disease models.Dis. Model. Mech. 2013; 6: 896-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). In this study, we asked two overarching questions. First, can population cohorts of iPSCs and iPSC-differentiated cells be used to perform unbiased genome-wide eQTL/ASE studies in a manner that is complementary to traditional primary tissue-based studies such as the Gene-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project? Second, can we better understand the functional role of human genetic variation in influencing quantitative phenotypic traits, particularly those related to liver metabolism such as blood lipid levels? As part of the NHLBI Next Generation Genetic Association Studies Consortium, we generated population-based cohorts of iPSCs and iPSC-differentiated hepatocyte-like cells (HLCs) to perform genome-wide mapping and characterize known and new eQTL/ASE loci. We thereafter employed gene overexpression mouse models as well as a combination of MPRAs and CRISPR-Cas9 in hPSCs, other types of cultured cells, and mouse models to screen, identify, and validate functional variants and/or genes in several blood lipid-associated eQTL/ASE loci. We generated iPSCs from peripheral blood mononuclear cells isolated from 91 individuals, predominantly African Americans (43%) and European Americans (55%), with more women (60%) than men (40%) (Table S1). All established iPSC lines were confirmed to be free of exogenous Sendai viral reprogramming factor expression and then tested for pluripotency by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) staining for SSEA4 and Tra-1-60 (Figure S1A; Table S1). Samples passing these criteria were differentiated into HLCs. Differentiated HLCs were morphologically similar to primary hepatocytes, and for a subset of HLC samples, expression of HNF4α was confirmed by immunofluorescence (Figure S1B). The HLCs also secreted apolipoprotein B (apoB), triglycerides, and albumin (Figure S2A), a set of properties unique to functional hepatocytes. In addition to molecular and qualitative assessments of pluripotency and differentiation efficiencies, we used computational means to further validate the iPSCs and HLCs used for our study. We generated RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data from iPSCs (n = 89), HLCs (n = 86), and primary human hepatocytes (n = 4). In addition, we used RNA-seq data of human whole-liver samples from GTEx (n = 96) (Aguet et al., 2016Aguet F. Brown A.A. Castel S. Davis J.R. Mohammadi P. Segre A.V. Zappala Z. Abell N.S. Fresard L. Gamazon E.R. et al.Local genetic effects on gene expression across 44 human tissues.bioRxiv. 2016; https://doi.org/10.1101/074450Crossref Google Scholar). With the use of singular value decomposition (SVD), expression levels of a panel of differentiation markers (Carcamo-Orive et al., 2017Carcamo-Orive I. Hoffman G.E. Cundiff P. Beckmann N.D. D’Souza S.L. Knowles J.W. Patel A. Papatsenko D. Abbasi F. Reaven G.M. et al.Analysis of transcriptional variability in a large human iPSC library reveals genetic and non-genetic determinants of heterogeneity.Cell Stem Cell. 2017; 20 (this issue): 518-532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) demonstrated that our iPSCs were extremely similar to other iPSCs and human embryonic stem cells (ESCs) with previously published gene expression data (Choi et al., 2015Choi J. Lee S. Mallard W. Clement K. Tagliazucchi G.M. Lim H. Choi I.Y. Ferrari F. Tsankov A.M. Pop R. et al.A comparison of genetically matched cell lines reveals the equivalence of human iPSCs and ESCs.Nat. Biotechnol. 2015; 33: 1173-1181Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar) (Figure S3A). We characterized the global gene expression profiles of the iPSCs, HLCs, primary hepatocytes, and GTEx livers and in general found that the HLCs had been successfully differentiated from the iPSCs and approximated the gene expression profiles of the primary hepatocytes more closely than the profiles of the livers (Figure S3B). We specifically assessed the expression levels of six hepatocyte-specific genes in the HLCs (Figure S2B), using these levels as compared to levels in primary human hepatocytes as a means to assess the quality of the HLCs (scored from zero to five) (Table S1). Fully understanding the underlying variance between HLCs and whole livers merits further investigation, as hepatocytes constitute only one of several cell types in the liver. We quantified differential gene expression using DESeq2 (Love et al., 2014Love M.I. Huber W. Anders S. Moderated estimation of fold change and dispersion for RNA-seq data with DESeq2.Genome Biol. 2014; 15: 550Crossref PubMed Scopus (32370) Google Scholar). We identified 3,709 genes more highly expressed in livers compared to iPSCs and 2,040 genes more highly expressed in HLCs compared to iPSCs at false discovery rate (FDR) < 5%. We sought to assess the liver-specific functions associated with 1,349 genes that were common to both sets (differentially expressed in both HLCs and livers compared to iPSCs) by estimating the enrichment of these genes for gene ontology (GO) terms. We identified 126 common GO terms including functions specific to hepatic regulation and lipid metabolism (Table S2). With a goal of identifying hepatic cis-regulatory variation, we mapped genome-wide cis-eQTLs in the iPSCs, HLCs, and GTEx livers using linear models as implemented in Matrix eQTL (Shabalin, 2012Shabalin A.A. Matrix eQTL: ultra fast eQTL analysis via large matrix operations.Bioinformatics. 2012; 28: 1353-1358Crossref PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar) (Figure 1A). We identified a total of 3,587 eGenes in the iPSCs, 2,392 eGenes in the HLCs, and 1,511 eGenes in the GTEx livers at FDR < 5% (Table S3). The HLCs and livers shared a total of 477 eGenes, 176 of which were not associated in the iPSCs at FDR < 5% (Figure 1B). The eQTLs were primarily associated with protein coding genes (83%), and the majority of eGenes were nominally associated (p < 0.05) in more than one cell type. To complement the eQTL analyses, and to assess the effects of cis-regulatory variants at lower frequencies that eQTL analyses are underpowered to detect, we quantified allele-specific expression (ASE) in iPSCs and HLCs (individual-level data not provided in the manuscript due to privacy concerns). Genome-wide, we identified 1,721 independent SNPs in 494 genes that exhibited significant ASE in iPSCs (FDR < 5%) and 2,137 independent SNPs in 631 genes that exhibited significant ASE in HLCs. Furthermore, 876 independent SNPs in 541 genes exhibited differential ASE (FDR < 5%) between iPSCs and HLCs (Table S4), indicating cell-type-specific regulatory effects. Genes exhibiting differential ASE were significantly enriched for cell-type-specific eGenes (odds ratio = 3.3, p < 1.8 × 10−13), independently confirming the cell-type-specific regulatory effects identified with the two methodologies. To further refine cell-type-specific effects of cis-eQTLs between iPSCs and HLCs, we conducted a mixed model meta-analysis. Considering our paired sample design, we used METASOFT (Han and Eskin, 2012Han B. Eskin E. Interpreting meta-analyses of genome-wide association studies.PLoS Genet. 2012; 8: e1002555Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) and Meta-Tissue (Sul et al., 2013Sul J.H. Han B. Ye C. Choi T. Eskin E. Effectively identifying eQTLs from multiple tissues by combining mixed model and meta-analytic approaches.PLoS Genet. 2013; 9: e1003491Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) to estimate effect sizes of each variant-gene pair accounting for covariates used in single-tissue analyses as well as tissue sharing among individuals. All SNPs within 100 kb of 20,488 genes expressed in either iPSCs or HLCs were used for meta-analysis. The probability of tissue specificity was estimated using m values (Han and Eskin, 2012Han B. Eskin E. Interpreting meta-analyses of genome-wide association studies.PLoS Genet. 2012; 8: e1002555Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Briefly, m values indicate the posterior probability that the effect exists in each study or cell type. We considered m values ≥ 0.9 as indicating a particular variant had a molecular effect in each cell type. The most significant HLC eGenes with respect to meta-analysis p values were AMDHD1, FA2H, and ACAA2 (Table S5). We assessed tissue specificity of HLC and iPSC eGenes by selecting SNP-eGene pairs (the most significant single-tissue SNP per gene) (Table S5). Among 2,392 HLC eGenes, we found 267 HLC-specific eGenes (HLC m value ≥ 0.9; iPSC m value < 0.1) and 1,051 eGenes with evidence of tissue specificity in both HLCs and iPSCs (HLC m value ≥ 0.9; iPSC m value ≥ 0.9). Among 3,587 iPSC eGenes, we found 474 iPSC-specific eGenes (HLC m value < 0.1; iPSC m value ≥ 0.9) and 1,279 eGenes with evidence of effects in both HLCs and iPSCs (HLC m value ≥ 0.9; iPSC m value ≥ 0.9). We also indirectly assessed potential HLC and iPSC specificity of GTEx liver eGenes by comparing GTEx liver eGenes to m values estimated from our data. We found 24 GTEx liver eGenes (HLC m value ≥ 0.9; iPSC m value < 0.1) and 10 GTEx liver eGenes (HLC m value < 0.1; iPSC m value ≥ 0.9) that potentially share HLC or iPSC tissue specificity, respectively. Our identified 267 HLC-specific eGenes were significantly enriched for genes with known functions in decreased cholesterol level (MP:0003983; Benjamini-Hochberg FDR = 0.03), decreased sterol level (MP:0012225; FDR = 0.03), and decreased circulating cholesterol level (MP:0005179; FDR = 0.04) (Table S6). Perhaps not surprisingly, these HLC-specific eGenes were also enriched for liver-selective genes as defined by MSigDB (M13283; FDR = 0.04). In order to assess whether the eQTL/ASE analyses could identify new functional variants and genes at GWAS loci, we chose to focus on blood lipid traits (total cholesterol [TC], LDL-C, HDL-C, and triglyceride [TG] levels) because of the major influence of the liver on these traits, as well as the ability to interrogate the functional effects of candidate genes on blood lipid levels in mice. To identify potential functional variants and genes in the HLC, iPSC, and GTEx liver cohorts, we interrogated 7,240 SNPs across 157 loci associated with one or more of the four lipid traits (p < 5 × 10−8) from the Global Lipids Genetics Consortium (GLGC) (Willer et al., 2013Willer C.J. Schmidt E.M. Sengupta S. Peloso G.M. Gustafsson S. Kanoni S. Ganna A. Chen J. Buchkovich M.L. Mora S. et al.Global Lipids Genetics ConsortiumDiscovery and refinement of loci associated with lipid levels.Nat. Genet. 2013; 45: 1274-1283Crossref PubMed Scopus (1875) Google Scholar) for association with the expression of any gene within 1 Mb (eQTL FDR < 5%). Across the 157 loci, there were 32 eGenes in the HLCs, 43 eGenes in the iPSCs, and 30 eGenes in the GTEx livers (Figure 2A; Table S7). In the HLCs, 205 genes at the GLGC loci exhibited significant ASE (FDR < 5%) in at least one individual, potentially identifying additional candidate functional genes that were missed by the eQTL analyses. We were particularly interested in the HLC eGenes, irrespective of whether they were found only in HLCs or were shared by iPSCs (i.e., not exclusive to HLCs), because of their potential to modulate hepatocyte lipid metabolism. We rank-ordered the identified GLGC HLC eGenes by strength of association, judged by eQTL p value (Figure 2B). Among the top GLGC HLC eGenes, we deferred studying SYPL2 and IGF2R; for each of these genes, the best eQTL SNP is in weak LD with an extremely strongly lipid-associated SNP in the SORT1 locus (r2 = 0.01 between rs10857787 and rs12740374 in Europeans) and the LPA locus (r2 = 0.035 between rs3777404 and rs1564348 in Europeans), respectively—so strongly that the SYPL2 and IGF2R SNPs meet the statistical threshold of p < 5 × 10−8 for lipid association even though they are located in different loci than the SORT1 and LPA lead SNPs, simply by being in weak LD with them. We also deferred studying FUT2, since its best eQTL SNP is a coding variant in the gene. Among the other top GLGC HLC eGenes, we sought to identify functional regulatory variants in the loci of CPNE1, ANGPTL3, and FRK, as described below. We note that in eQTL analyses performed only on higher-quality HLCs (the 63 HLC samples with scores of at least three in Table S1, out of the total 86 HLC samples), all of the top GLGC HLC eGenes remained strongly associated with SNPs in their loci (Figure 2B). To assess the hypothesis that lipid and eQTL associations are driven by the same variant, we assessed colocalization of each of eight top GLGC HLC eGenes and the four relevant GLGC traits (Giambartolomei et al., 2014Giambartolomei C. Vukcevic D. Schadt E.E. Franke L. Hingorani A.D. Wallace C. Plagnol V. Bayesian test for colocalisation between pairs of genetic association studies using summary statistics.PLoS Genet. 2014; 10: e1004383Crossref PubMed Scopus (880) Google Scholar). Fifteen trait-eGene pairs exhibited moderate to strong evidence of colocalization (PP.H4.ABF > 0.4; Table S8). In particular, VKORC1 showed strong evidence of colocalization in both HLCs (TG, PP.H4.ABF = 0.97; LDL-C, PP.H4.ABF = 0.52) and GTEx livers (TG, PP.H4.ABF = 0.98; LDL-C, PP.H4.ABF = 0.65), but not in iPSCs (TG, PP.H4.ABF = 0.07; LDL-C, PP.H4.ABF = 0.006). ANGPTL3 colocalized in HLCs with all four GLGC traits (LDL-C, PP.H4.ABF = 0.77; TG, PP.H4.ABF = 0.76; TC, PP.H4.ABF = 0.49; HDL-C, PP.H4.ABF = 0.48). ANGPTL3 did not show evidence of colocalization in iPSCs or GTEx livers (Table S8). We focused first on the locus of CPNE1 (Figure 3A), an HLC eGene that did not independently qualify as an eGene in the GTEx liver cohort (i.e., did not have any associated SNPs with FDR < 5%), although it qualified as an eGene in a cohort of ∼1,000 liver samples (Teslovich et al., 2010Teslovich T.M. Musunuru K. Smith A.V. Edmondson A.C. Stylianou I.M. Koseki M. Pirruccello J.P. Ripatti S. Chasman D.I. Willer C.J. et al.Biological, clinical and population relevance of 95 loci for blood lipids.Nature. 2010; 466: 707-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (2781) Google Scholar). To identify candidate functional variants among all the SNPs in LD within the CPNE1 locus in an unbiased fashion, we performed MPRA experiments to rapidly profile the regulatory activity of 239 variants linked (r2 ≥ 0.5) to the lead SNP at the locus. Duplicate MPRAs were performed, and we rank-ordered SNPs by magnitude of allele-specific regulatory activity as measured by reporter expression (Table S9). The top MPRA SNP in the locus was rs2277862 (Figure 2C). Of note, rs2277862 was also the lead SNP for TC in the locus in the GLGC study, with each alternate allele copy associated with a 1.19 mg/dL change in TC (Teslovich et al., 2010Teslovich T.M. Musunuru K. Smith A.V. Edmondson A.C. Stylianou I.M. Koseki M. Pirruccello J.P. Ripatti S. Chasman D.I. Willer C.J. et al.Biological, clinical and population relevance of 95 loci for blood lipids.Nature. 2010; 466: 707-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (2781) Google Scholar). The locus harbors eGenes in the HLC cohort (CPNE1), the iPSC cohort (CPNE1), and the GTEx liver cohort (ERGIC3); CPNE1 exhibited ASE in HLCs and iPSCs (lowest CPNE1 HLC p = 3 × 10−8; lowest CPNE1 iPSC p = 6 × 10−9). The functions of these genes are poorly understood. We reasoned that rs2277862 might modulate transcription of CPNE1 in both HLCs and undifferentiated hPSCs. To test if rs2277862 regulates CPNE1 and/or ERGIC3 expression, we performed four types of experiments, two based in hPSCs. First, in an hPSC line, HUES 8 (C/C, major/major at rs2277862), we used CRISPR-Cas9 to knock in one minor allele (Figure 3B). Using a single-strand DNA oligonucleotide as a repair template, we obtained only a single recombinant heterozygous (C/T) clone at a frequency of 0.15% (1 out of 672 clones screened), highlighting the inefficiency of the procedure. We observed significantly decreased CPNE1 expression in both undifferentiated knockin hPSCs (down 19%) and differentiated knockin HLCs (down 10%), with non-significant effects on ERGIC3 (Figure 3C). Second, in two hPSC lines, HUES 8 and H7 (T/T, minor/minor at rs2277862), we used multiplexed CRISPR-Cas9 to cleanly and efficiently delete ∼38 bp around the SNP (168/285 clones) (Figure 3B), which was far more efficient than knockin. Homozygous deletion of 38 bp in undifferentiated HUES 8 cells decreased expression of CPNE1 (down 31%) and ERGIC3 (down 20%), whereas homozygous deletion in undifferentiated H7 cells did not affect CPNE1 and decreased expression of ERGIC3 to a lesser degree (down 10%) (Figure 3C). These data are concordant with the data from the heterozygous knockin clone. Third, we used catalytically dead Cas9 (dCas9) with three different guide RNAs (gRNAs) at the site of the SNP to attempt CRISPR interference, or CRISPRi (Qi et al., 2013Qi L.S. Larson M.H. Gilbert L.A. Doudna J.A. Weissman J.S. Arkin A.P. Lim W.A. Repurposing CRISPR as an RNA-guided platform for sequence-specific control of gene expression.Cell. 2013; 152: 1173-1183Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2996) Google Scholar), in HEK293T cells (C/C, major/major at rs2277862). The rationale was that if the variant were truly functional and lay within a transcriptional regulatory element, then the presence of the bulky Cas9 protein at the site should sterically hinder recruitment of transcription factors to the regulatory site and thus interfere with transcriptional regulation. We found that the gRNAs generally resulted in decreased expression of CPNE1, but not ERGIC3 (Figure 3D). Fourth, we noted that, atypically, the noncoding region encompassing rs2277862 is well conserved in mouse (Figures 3A and 3E), and the orthologous nucleotide in mouse also displays naturally occurring variation and has been previously cataloged as rs27324996, with the same two alleles (C and T) as in humans. We used CRISPR-Cas9 in single-cell mouse embryos of the C57BL/6J strain (C/C at rs27324996) to generate a knockin mouse with a minor allele (T) as well as four additional nucleotide changes both to prevent CRISPR-Cas9 re-cleavage of the knockin allele and to “humanize” the sequence (i.e., make a perfect match to the orthologous human sequence) (Figure 3E). There was decreased expression of Cpne1 (down 37%) and Ergic3 (down 34%, albeit not with p < 0.05) in the liver in homozygous knockin (T/T) mice compared to wild-type (C/C) littermates (Figure 3F); cholesterol levels were unchanged, as expected from the small effect in humans (1.19 mg/dL change in cholesterol per allele). These data are highly concordant with the data from the genome-edited hPSC clones with respect to both the direction and magnitude of effects. Taken together, all of these findings support rs2277862-CPNE1 as a functional SNP-gene set. We next focused on the locus of ANGPTL3 (Figure 4A), another HLC eGene that did not independently qualify as an eGene in the GTEx liver cohort, although it qualified as an eGene in a cohort of ∼1000 liver samples (Teslovich et al., 2010Teslovich T.M. Musunuru K. Smith A.V. Edmondson A.C. Stylianou I.M. Koseki M. Pirruccello J.P. Ripatti S. Chasman D.I. Willer C.J. et al.Biological, clinical and population relevance of 95 loci for blood lipids.Nature. 2010; 466: 707-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (2781) Google Scholar). In duplicate MPRA experiments, we profiled the regulatory activity of 210 variants linked (r2 ≥ 0.5) to the lead SNP at the locus (Table S9). The top MPRA SNP in the locus was rs10889356 (Figure 2C). In Europeans, rs10889356 is tightly linked to rs2131925 (r2 = 0.90), the lead SNP in the locus in the GLGC study, with each alternate allele copy of rs2131925 associated with a 4.9 mg/dL change in TG (Teslovich et al., 2010Teslovich T.M. Musunuru K. Smith A.V. Edmondson A.C. Stylianou I.M. Koseki M. Pirruccello J.P. Ripatti S. Chasman D.I. Willer C.J. et al.Biological, clinical and population relevance of 95 loci for blood lipids.Nature. 2010; 466: 707-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (2781) Google Scholar). ANGPTL3, which is generally believed to be the functional gene at this locus, encodes a liver-specific secreted protein that increases blood cholesterol and triglyceride levels in mice (Koishi et al., 2002Koishi R. Ando Y. Ono M. Shimamura M. Yasumo H. Fujiwara T. Horikoshi H. Furukawa H. Angptl3 regulates lipid metabolism in mice.Nat. Genet. 2002; 30: 151-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar) and in humans (Musunuru et al., 2010Musunuru K. Pirruccello J.P. Do R. Peloso G.M. Guiducci C. Sougnez C. Garimella K.V. Fisher S. Abreu J. Barry A.J. et al.Exome sequencing, ANGPTL3 mutations, and familial combined hypolipidemia.N. Engl. J. Med. 2010; 363: 2220-2227Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar). ANGPTL3 lies within an intron of DOCK7, a poorly understood non-liver-specific gene. As with the CPNE1/ERGIC3 locus, we used several complementary approaches to interrogate the relationship of rs10889356 with ANGPTL3 and DOCK7. First, in the H7 hPSC line (G/G, major/major at rs10889356), we used CRISPR-Cas9 to knock in the minor allele (Figure 4B). We attempted to use a single-strand DNA oligonucleotide as a repair template but were unsuccessful in obtaining any heterozygous or homozygous knockin clones after screening a large number of clones. We thereafter used a targeting vector with 500-bp homology arms and a puromycin resistance cassette on a transposon that could undergo scarless removal from a TTAA site with piggyBac (Figure 4B). The closest endogenous TTAA site to rs10889356 was 200 bp away. We obtained several clones in which puromycin selection facilitated knockin of the rs10889356 minor allele into both chromosomes (i.e., homozygous knockin). We pooled these clones and introduced piggyBac, which yielded a large number of clones in which scarless excision was achieved. Homozygous knockin (A/A) clones had decreased expression of DOCK7 compared to wild-type clones (down 16%) (Figure 4D). When differentiated into HLCs, homozygous knockin cells had decreased expression of DOCK7 (down 36%) and substantially increased ANGPTL3 expression (up 60%) (Figure 4D). Second, in the same H7 hPSC background (G/G, major/major), we used multiplexed CRISPR-Cas9 to delete 36–39 bp around the SNP (Figure 4C). Homozygous deletion of 36–39 bp in undifferentiated H7 cells decreased expression of DOCK7 (down 8%) (Figure 4E). When differentiated into HLCs, homozygous deleted H7 cells had decreased expression of DOCK7 (down 32%) and increased ANGPTL3 expression (up 67%) (Figure 4E). These data are extremely concordant with the data from the homozygous knockin clones. Third, CRISPRi with three gRNAs in HepG2 cells (G/G, major/major at rs10889356; used because being of hepatic origin they express ANGPTL3) both decreased DOCK7 expression and increased ANGPTL3 expression (Figure 4F). These data are concordant with the data from the genome-edited hPSC clones with respect to the direction of effects for both genes. Taken together, all of these findings support rs10889356-DOCK7 and rs10889356-ANGPTL3 as functional SNP-gene sets. We investigated a third locus with a hig"

Here we describe an approach to functionally validate identified variants through differentiation of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) to study cellular pathophysiology. We collected peripheral blood cells from Framingham Heart Study participants and reprogrammed them to iPSCs. We then differentiated 68 iPSC lines into hepatocytes and adipocytes to investigate the effect of the 1p13 rs12740374 variant on cardiometabolic disease phenotypes via transcriptomics and metabolomic signatures. We observed a clear association between rs12740374 and lipid accumulation and gene expression in differentiated hepatocytes, in particular, expression of SORT1, CELSR2, and PSRC1, consistent with previous analyses of this variant using other approaches. Initial investigation of additional SNPs also highlighted correlations with gene expression. These findings suggest that iPSC-based population studies hold promise as tools for the functional validation of GWAS variants."

The Next Generation Genetic Association Studies consortium was developed to provide a functional dimension to the genomic study of cardiovascular disease. The primary goal of this initiative is to exploit the power of cellular reprogramming to generate induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from thousands of patients with defined genetic variations that correlate with cardiovascular disease. To date, iPSC lines produced by the consortium are available from genotyped patients with coronary artery disease, platelet aggregation deficiencies, lipid disorders, QT interval and ECG cardiac traits, pulmonary hypertension, insulin resistance, left ventricular hypertrophy, myocardial infarction, and sickle cell anemia (http://www.wicell.org/home/stem-cell-lines/collections/collections.cmsx). Having banks of patient-specific iPSCs provide investigators with cells for functional studies and drug discovery. As proof of feasibility we, therefore, sought to use iPSC-derived hepatocyte-like cells (referred to here as hepatocytes) from a familial hypercholesterolemia patient for a screen to identify pharmaceuticals that could be used to treat hypercholesterolemia in a low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR)-independent manner. Familial hypercholesterolemia is a disease caused primarily by mutations in the LDLR. The disease is characterized by elevated serum LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C). In patients with compound heterozygous or homozygous mutations in the LDLR (referred to collectively as hoFH), LDL-C levels reach >500 mg/dL, which lead to the formation of xanthomas, severe cardiovascular disease, and early death (Rader et al., 2003Rader D.J. Cohen J. Hobbs H.H. Monogenic hypercholesterolemia: new insights in pathogenesis and treatment.J. Clin. Invest. 2003; 111: 1795-1803Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). Importantly, although the LDLR is broadly expressed, the disease can be cured by liver transplantation, indicating that the hepatic LDLR is the primary regulator of serum LDL-C levels (Alphonse and Jones, 2016Alphonse P.A. Jones P.J. Revisiting human cholesterol synthesis and absorption: The reciprocity paradigm and its key regulators.Lipids. 2016; 51: 519-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Most drugs that lower serum LDL-C work on the liver through upregulation of LDLR transcription (statins) or stability of the LDLR protein (proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 [PCSK9] inhibitors) (Nissen et al., 2016Nissen S.E.

As a consequence, such drugs are relatively ineffective in patients with hoFH (Cuchel et al., 2014Cuchel M. Bruckert E. Ginsberg H.N. Raal F.J. Santos R.D. Hegele R.A. Kuivenhoven J.A.

However, therapies that limit hepatic production of VLDL, the precursor to LDL, are effective in reducing LDL-C in patients with hoFH (Rader and Kastelein, 2014Rader D.J. Kastelein J.J. Lomitapide and mipomersen: two first-in-class drugs for reducing low-density lipoprotein cholesterol in patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia.Circulation. 2014; 129: 1022-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, Davidson, 2009Davidson M.H. Novel nonstatin strategies to lower low-density lipoprotein cholesterol.Curr. Atheroscler. Rep. 2009; 11: 67-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Lomitapide inhibits the microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTTP), which is critical for hepatic VLDL assembly and reduces LDL-C by approximately 40%–50%. Mipomersen is an antisense oligonucleotide that targets the mRNA encoding apoB, the essential core protein of VLDL, in the liver and reduces LDL-C by approximately 25% in hoFH patients. Both of these drugs reduce hepatic secretion of VLDL and apoB independently of the LDLR, but unfortunately result in increased fat in the liver (Rader and Kastelein, 2014Rader D.J. Kastelein J.J. Lomitapide and mipomersen: two first-in-class drugs for reducing low-density lipoprotein cholesterol in patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia.Circulation. 2014; 129: 1022-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). To demonstrate the utility of using iPSC-derived hepatocytes as a platform to identify drugs that could be used to treat metabolic liver disease, we used hoFH iPSC-derived hepatocyte-like cells for a screen of a library of existing drugs that could potentially be repurposed (Strittmatter, 2014Strittmatter S.M. Overcoming drug development bottlenecks with repurposing: Old drugs learn new tricks.Nat. Med. 2014; 20: 590-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Drugs that reduce apoB levels in the media of hoFH hepatocytes should act independently of the LDLR and so we reasoned that success could provide an alternative treatment for hoFH and other forms of difficult-to-treat hypercholesterolemia. Success in identifying drugs that can be used to target a rare disease relies on the development of screening assays. Unfortunately, primary hepatocytes rapidly de-differentiate upon culture and given the variability in the genetics of the donors pose challenges for use in high throughput drug discovery (Binda et al., 2003Binda D. Lasserre-Bigot D. Bonet A. Thomassin M. Come M.P. Guinchard C. Bars R. Jacqueson A. Richert L.

We have previously described the generation of iPSCs from a hoFH patient (Cayo et al., 2012Cayo M.A. Cai J. DeLaForest A. Noto F.K. Nagaoka M. Clark B.S. Collery R.F. Si-Tayeb K. Duncan S.A. JD induced pluripotent stem cell-derived hepatocytes faithfully recapitulate the pathophysiology of familial hypercholesterolemia.Hepatology. 2012; 56: 2163-2171Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The patient has a deletion in exon 17 of the maternal allele, which is a null mutation, and an A-G transition in exon 17 of the paternal allele, which encodes a receptor that is unable to internalize LDL (Davis et al., 1986Davis C.G. Lehrman M.A. Russell D.W. Anderson R.G. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. The J.D. mutation in familial hypercholesterolemia: amino acid substitution in cytoplasmic domain impedes internalization of LDL receptors.Cell. 1986; 45: 15-24Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). When hepatocyte-like cells are generated from these hoFH iPSCs, they faithfully recapitulate the pathophysiology associated with the liver of hoFH patients (Cayo et al., 2012Cayo M.A. Cai J. DeLaForest A. Noto F.K. Nagaoka M. Clark B.S. Collery R.F. Si-Tayeb K. Duncan S.A. JD induced pluripotent stem cell-derived hepatocytes faithfully recapitulate the pathophysiology of familial hypercholesterolemia.Hepatology. 2012; 56: 2163-2171Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). In these experiments, hoFH hepatocytes failed to traffic exogenous LDL to endosomes and were unable to increase LDL clearance in response to statin treatment. Moreover, compared to controls, the hoFH iPSC-derived hepatocytes had elevated levels of apoB in the culture medium (Cayo et al., 2012Cayo M.A. Cai J. DeLaForest A. Noto F.K. Nagaoka M. Clark B.S. Collery R.F. Si-Tayeb K. Duncan S.A. JD induced pluripotent stem cell-derived hepatocytes faithfully recapitulate the pathophysiology of familial hypercholesterolemia.Hepatology. 2012; 56: 2163-2171Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The high level of apoB in the medium of hoFH iPSC-derived hepatocytes potentially offers a screenable phenotype for identification of new LDL-C lowering drugs. Any drug capable of reducing LDL-C in the medium of hoFH iPSC-derived hepatocytes must act through a mechanism that is independent of the LDLR. We, therefore, measured apoB in the media by ELISA as our primary assay. A comparison of the ELISA performance on positive and negative control cells confirmed that the assay was appropriate for screening (Z-factor = 0.88) (Figure 1A). Moreover, the ELISA could distinguish the effect of treating iPSC-derived hepatocytes with vehicle or the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide as a positive control (p = 9.7 × 10−28) (Figure 1B). We have previously described the production of hepatocyte-like cells from iPSCs using monolayer culture and completely defined conditions (Si-Tayeb et al., 2010aSi-Tayeb K. Noto F.K. Nagaoka M. Li J.

The procedure is efficient with approximately 80% of cells expressing hepatocyte markers and is highly reproducible with minimal well-to-well variation (Figure 1A). The hoFH iPSCs were differentiated into hepatocyte-like cells in 96-well plates and the levels of apoB measured before and after the application of 2,320 small molecules from the Spectrum collection drug library (Figure 1C). The library was selected because it contains ∼1,300 drugs that have reached clinical trials in the USA, Europe, or Japan. Also, the library has ∼800 compounds that are natural products. Compounds in the library are structurally diverse and include oxygen heterocycles, diterpenes, sequiterpenes, pentercyclic triterpenes, and alkaloids.

The pre- to post-drug treatment ratio of apoB was established for each compound (Figure 1D) and hits identified by Z score analysis (Figure 1E) as described by Zhang, 2011Zhang X.D. Illustration of SSMD, z score, SSMD∗, z∗ score, and t statistic for hit selection in RNAi high-throughput screens.J. Biomol. Screen. 2011; 16: 775-785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar. Ratios that had a z score of ≤−3 (decreased apoB) or ≥3 (increased apoB), based on the 3-sigma rule, were considered primary hits. Using these criteria, we found eight drugs that increased and 21 that decreased apoB levels in the culture medium (Table S1). Next, the effect of each drug on apoB levels was compared to vehicle (DMSO) controls (n = 3 biological replicates). Of the 29 drugs identified in the initial screen, 55% were reproducible (p ≤ 0.05), with 13 compounds decreasing the level of apoB (Figure 2A). Of the compounds that reproducibly decreased apoB secretion, five were cardiac glycosides, sharing a similar molecular structure (Figure 2B). If we reduced the stringency of the z score to ≤−2.0 in the primary screen, 7 of 9 cardiac glycosides present in the library were identified (Figure 2C). We, therefore, tested all nine of the cardiac glycosides in the Spectrum collection in triplicate assays to determine whether they all reduced levels of apoB in the medium of iPSC-derived hepatocytes (Figure 2A). Remarkably, every cardiac glycoside tested reduced apoB compared to pre-treatment levels and DMSO-treated controls (p ≤ 0.05). Reductions ranged from 29% (ouabain) to 73% (gitoxin) (Figure 2C). We predicted that the ability of cardiac glycosides to lower apoB should not be restricted to hoFH cells. To determine whether the cardiac glycosides also reduced apoB levels in wild-type hepatocytes, we established dose-response curves using HepG2 hepatoma cells (Figure 3A), primary human hepatocytes (Figure 3B), and hepatocyte-like cells derived from control (K3) iPSCs (Figure S1) (Si-Tayeb et al., 2010bSi-Tayeb K. Noto F.K. Sepac A. Sedlic F. Bosnjak Z.J. Lough J.W. Duncan S.A. Generation of human induced pluripotent stem cells by simple transient transfection of plasmid DNA encoding reprogramming factors.BMC Dev. Biol. 2010; 10: 81Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). With the exception of strophanthidin, which was less efficient, the cardiac glycosides reduced apoB levels with an EC50 ≤20 nM. Based on these data, we conclude that cardiac glycosides have an unappreciated ability to lower the levels of apoB in culture medium from both LDLR-deficient and wild-type hepatocytes. We sought to address the mechanism through which the cardiac glycosides reduced the concentration of apoB in the medium. Since apoB is the central protein component of VLDL and LDL particles, we first determined whether cardiac glycoside treatment resulted in a reduction in VLDL/LDL. Lipoprotein production was measured by [3H]-glycerol labeling of triglycerides followed by FPLC in primary human hepatocytes treated with either DMSO, digoxin, or proscillaridin (Figure 4A). As expected, both digoxin and proscillaridin dramatically reduced VLDL triglyceride levels in the medium of glycoside treated hepatocytes. We next examined the kinetics of apoB accumulation in the culture medium of hoFH iPSC-derived hepatocytes in the presence and absence of digoxin, proscillaridin, or convallatoxin over time. As shown in Figure 4B, hoFH cells treated with each of the glycosides exhibited a reduction in the concentration of apoB in the medium compared to DMSO within 60 min of treatment. This rapid response to glycoside administration implied that the effect of the drug was direct rather than an indirect change in cell behavior. Based on this implication, we reasoned that the drug could influence either expression of the APOB gene, apoB protein synthesis, post-translational control of apoB protein, or secretion. Steady-state mRNA levels encoding apoB were determined in wild-type (K3) iPSC-derived hepatocytes by qRT-PCR and found to be unaffected by treatment with either digoxin or proscillaridin (Figure 4C). We next determined whether synthesis of apoB protein was affected by metabolic labeling of nascent proteins followed by immunoprecipitation in the presence or absence of digoxin (Figure 4D). We first confirmed the specificity of antibodies used to precipitate apoB. As expected, proteins were not precipitated by anti-apoB antibody from lysates of undifferentiated iPSCs that do not express apoB. Similarly, protein was undetected when lysates from iPSC-derived hepatocytes were subjected to precipitation using an anti-FLAG control antibody. When precipitations of apoB were performed on lysates from iPSC-derived hepatocytes labeled with [35S]-Methionine, nascent apoB protein levels were indistinguishable between untreated- and digoxin-treated cells despite the fact that digoxin reduced the level of apoB in the cell medium. Based on these studies, we conclude that cardiac glycosides have no effect on expression of APOB or the synthesis of apoB protein and that these drugs must act post-translationally. Post-translational control of apoB-100 protein has been studied in detail and has been shown to be highly regulated and crucial for the formation and secretion of lipoprotein particles (Ginsberg and Fisher, 2009Ginsberg H.N.

Recent progress in understanding protein and lipid factors affecting hepatic VLDL assembly and secretion.Nutr. Metab. (Lond.). 2010; 7: 35Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). We, therefore, examined the steady-state intracellular levels of apoB protein by immunoblot analyses of iPSC-derived hepatocytes treated for 24 hr with either DMSO, the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide as a control for protein turnover, digoxin, or proscillaridin. As expected, compared to DMSO-treated control cells, cycloheximide resulted in an 8-fold reduction in the cellular level of apoB protein as the intracellular pool of apoB was degraded or secreted (Figure 4E). Strikingly, treatment of the cells with either digoxin or proscillaridin resulted in a similar reduction in the level of intracellular apoB (Figure 4E). When cells were treated with both cycloheximide and a cardiac glycoside, the reduction in apoB protein level was exacerbated. Using ELISA, we confirmed that digoxin and proscillaridin reduced the level of apoB (p < 0.05, n = 3 biological replicates) in the media of samples used for immunoblot and qRT-PCR analyses (Figure 4F). The observation that intracellular apoB levels were reduced even though synthesis of apoB protein was unaffected by cardiac glycoside treatment implied that the glycosides act by promoting apoB degradation. Degradation of newly synthesized apoB occurs predominantly by the proteasome and regulates lipoprotein production (Fisher and Ginsberg, 2002Fisher E.A. Ginsberg H.N.

Chem. 1998; 273: 35216-35221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). We, therefore, addressed whether glycoside-mediated reduction in apoB levels could be rescued by pharmacological inhibition of proteasome activity. Hepatocytes were produced from wild-type iPSCs and treated for 8 hr with either DMSO, digoxin, or digoxin plus the proteasome inhibitor MG132 before measuring apoB by immunoblot (Figure 4G). Although we observed variation between different experiments, in all cases (Figure 4H; n = 4 biological replicates), we found that the addition of MG132 to digoxin-treated hepatocytes increased the level of intracellular apoB. From these data, we conclude that the cardiac glycosides enhance the turnover of apoB at least in part through promoting proteasome-mediated degradation. Cardiac glycosides are used to treat congestive heart failure and atrial fibrillation (Hothi et al., 2013Hothi S.S. Chinnappa S.

Although the use of cardiac glycosides has declined, at its peak, digoxin was used to treat 80% of patients with heart failure (Hothi et al., 2013Hothi S.S. Chinnappa S.

Despite the clinical use of cardiac glycosides for over 200 years, their ability to reduce human LDL-C levels has not been reported. We, therefore, examined whether cardiac glycosides had LDL-C lowering properties in humans by examining the medical records of patients who had entered the Froedtert Hospital/Medical College of Wisconsin clinics. We first identified a cohort of patients who had historically been prescribed with a cardiac glycoside (n = 5,493). Within this group, we also identified patients who had been prescribed an angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, which should have no effect on cholesterol levels, or a statin, which served as a positive control group. Since the time frame during which a patient was prescribed a particular medication was known, it was possible to retrieve serum LDL-C and serum albumin measurements that had been recorded when patients were either “on” or “off” of drug treatment (Figure 5). Patients prescribed with each drug were therefore split into cohorts depending on whether they were on or off of drug when their LDL-C or albumin was measured. An ACE-inhibitor had no significant impact on the serum levels of either LDL-C (off drug n = 165 and on drug n = 180, p = 0.44) or albumin (off drug n = 763 and on drug n = 1,767, p = 0.24) (Figures 5A and 5B). As expected, treatment with a statin was associated with a reduction in the mean serum LDL-C from 103.6 ± 2.2 mg/dL in off drug patients to 89.8 ± 1.9 mg/dL in on drug patients (off drug n = 204 and on drug n = 221, p < 0.0001), while albumin levels were unaffected (off drug n = 906 and on drug n = 1,865) (Figures 5A and 5B). Strikingly, patients prescribed a cardiac glycoside displayed a reduction in serum LDL-C levels that was similar to patients treated with a statin, 103.1 ± 1.8 mg/dL in off drug to 94.0 ± 2.3 mg/dL in on drug patients (off drug n = 205 and on drug n = 324, p = 0.0019), with no effect on serum albumin (off drug n = 2,116 and on drug n = 770) (Figures 5A and 5B). The above analysis relied on cohorts of patients in which LDL-C measurements were taken either inside (on drug) or outside (off drug) the window of an active prescription. However, the LDL-C measurements of on drug and off drug cohorts were not necessarily from the same patients. We recognized that definitive human data would require us to retrieve on drug and off drug LDL-C measurements that could be matched to individuals. This would allow us to"

https://openalex.org/W2604944651,"Phenotypic variability is a hallmark of diseases involving chromosome gains and losses, such as Down syndrome and cancer. Allelic variances have been thought to be the sole cause of this heterogeneity. Here, we systematically examine the consequences of gaining and losing single or multiple chromosomes to show that the aneuploid state causes non-genetic phenotypic variability. Yeast cell populations harboring the same defined aneuploidy exhibit heterogeneity in cell-cycle progression and response to environmental perturbations. Variability increases with degree of aneuploidy and is partly due to gene copy number imbalances, suggesting that subtle changes in gene expression impact the robustness of biological networks and cause alternate behaviors when they occur across many genes. As inbred trisomic mice also exhibit variable phenotypes, we further propose that non-genetic individuality is a universal characteristic of the aneuploid state that may contribute to variability in presentation and treatment responses of diseases caused by aneuploidy."

To achieve this objective, field experiments were conducted in 2013 and 2014, using a randomized complete block design, with three replications. Nitrogen was applied at planting at rates of 0, 25, 50, and 75 kg N ha-1. In both years, starter nitrogen fertilizer benefited root activity, leaf photosynthesis, and consequently its yield. Statistically significant correlation was found among root activity, leaf photosynthetic rate, and grain yield at the developmental stage. The application of N25, N50, and N75 increased grain yield by 1.28%, 2.47%, and 1.58% in 2013 and by 0.62%, 2.77%, and 2.06% in 2014 compared to the N0 treatment. Maximum grain yield of 3238.91 kg ha-1 in 2013 and 3086.87 kg ha-1 in 2014 were recorded for N50 treatment. Grain yield was greater for 2013 than 2014, possibly due to more favorable environmental conditions. This research indicated that applying nitrogen as starter is necessary to increase soybean yield in Sangjiang River Plain in China."

This study investigates the optimal conditions for the biosorption of neodymium (Nd) from an aqueous solution derived from hard drive disk magnets using green microalgae (Chlorella vulgaris). The parameters considered include solution pH, temperature and biosorbent dosage. Best-fit equilibrium as well as kinetic biosorption models were also developed. At the optimal pH of 5, the maximum experimental Nd uptakes at 21, 35 and 50°C and an initial Nd concentration of 250 mg/L were 126.13, 157.40 and 77.10 mg/g, respectively. Analysis of the optimal equilibrium sorption data showed that the data fitted well (R2 = 0.98) to the Langmuir isotherm model, with maximum monolayer coverage capacity (qmax) of 188.68 mg/g, and Langmuir isotherm constant (KL) of 0.029 L/mg. The corresponding separation factor (RL) is 0.12 indicating that the equilibrium sorption was favorable. The sorption kinetics of Nd ion follows well a pseudo-second order model (R2>0.99), even at low initial concentrations. These results show that Chlorella vulgaris has greater biosorption affinity for Nd than activated carbon and other algae types such as: A. Gracilis, Sargassum sp. and A. Densus."
https://openalex.org/W2605233579,"Sirtuin 6 (SIRT6) is a sirtuin family member involved in a wide range of physiologic and disease processes, including cancer and glucose homeostasis. Based on the roles played by SIRT6 in different organs, including its ability to repress the expression of glucose transporters and glycolytic enzymes, inhibiting SIRT6 has been proposed as an approach for treating type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). However, so far, the lack of small-molecule Sirt6 inhibitors has hampered the conduct of in vivo studies to assess the viability of this strategy. We took advantage of a recently identified SIRT6 inhibitor, compound 1, to study the effect of pharmacological Sirt6 inhibition in a mouse model of T2DM (i.e., in high-fat-diet-fed animals). The administration of the Sirt6 inhibitor for 10 d was well tolerated and improved oral glucose tolerance, it increased the expression of the glucose transporters GLUT1 and -4 in the muscle and enhanced the activity of the glycolytic pathway. Sirt6 inhibition also resulted in reduced insulin, triglycerides, and cholesterol levels in plasma.

https://openalex.org/W2604942240,"Background Whereas there are numerous studies on unintentional weight loss (UWL), these have been limited by small sample sizes, short or variable follow‐up, and focus on older patients. Although some case series have revealed that malignancies escaping early detection and uncovered subsequently are exceptional, reported follow-ups have been too short or unspecified and necropsies seldom made. Our objective was to examine the etiologies, characteristics, and long-term outcome of UWL in a large cohort of outpatients. Methods We prospectively enrolled patients referred to an outpatient diagnosis unit for evaluation of UWL as a dominant or isolated feature of disease. Eligible patients underwent a standard baseline evaluation with laboratory tests and chest X-ray. Patients without identifiable causes 6 months after presentation underwent a systematic follow-up lasting for 60 further months. Subjects aged ≥65 years without initially recognizable causes underwent an oral cavity examination, a videofluoroscopy or swallowing study, and a depression and cognitive assessment. Results Overall, 2677 patients (mean age, 64.4 [14.7] years; 51% males) were included. Predominant etiologies were digestive organic disorders (nonmalignant in 17% and malignant in 16%). Psychosocial disorders explained 16% of cases. Oral disorders were second to nonhematologic malignancies as cause of UWL in patients aged ≥65 years. Although 375 (14%) patients were initially diagnosed with unexplained UWL, malignancies were detected in only 19 (5%) within the first 28 months after referral. Diagnosis was established at autopsy in 14 cases. Conclusion This investigation provides new information on the relevance of follow-up in the long-term clinical outcome of patients with unexplained UWL and on the role of age on this entity. Although unexplained UWL seldom constitutes a short-term medical alert, malignancies may be undetectable until death. Therefore, these patients should be followed up regularly (eg yearly visits) for longer than reported periods, and autopsies pursued when facing unsolved deaths."
https://openalex.org/W2604933769,"Dysbalance in gut microbiota has been linked to increased microbial translocation, leading to chronic inflammation in HIV-patients, even under effective HAART. Moreover, microbial translocation is associated with insufficient reconstitution of CD4+T cells, and contributes to the pathogenesis of immunologic non-response. In a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial, we recently showed that, compared to placebo, 12 weeks treatment with probiotic Saccharomyces boulardii significantly reduced plasma levels of bacterial translocation (Lipopolysaccharide-binding protein or LBP) and systemic inflammation (IL-6) in 44 HIV virologically suppressed patients, half of whom (n = 22) had immunologic non-response to antiretroviral therapy (<270 CD4+Tcells/μL despite long-term suppressed viral load). The aim of the present study was to investigate if this beneficial effect of the probiotic Saccharomyces boulardii is due to modified gut microbiome composition, with a decrease of some species associated with higher systemic levels of microbial translocation and inflammation. In this study, we used 16S rDNA gene amplification and parallel sequencing to analyze the probiotic impact on the composition of the gut microbiome (faecal samples) in these 44 patients randomized to receive oral supplementation with probiotic or placebo for 12 weeks. Compared to the placebo group, in individuals treated with probiotic we observed lower concentrations of some gut species, such as those of the Clostridiaceae family, which were correlated with systemic levels of bacterial translocation and inflammation markers. In a sub-study of these patients, we observed significantly higher parameters of microbial translocation (LBP, soluble CD14) and systemic inflammation in immunologic non-responders than in immunologic responders, which was correlated with a relative abundance of specific gut bacterial groups (Lachnospiraceae genus and Proteobacteria). Thus, in this work, we propose a new therapeutic strategy using the probiotic yeast S. boulardii to modify gut microbiome composition. Identifying pro-inflammatory species in the gut microbiome could also be a useful new marker of poor immune response and a new therapeutic target."
https://openalex.org/W2604160120,"Rhipicephalus microplus is widely distributed in tropical and subtropical areas of the world where livestock is a principal activity with great veterinary and economic importance. In Ecuador, this hematophagous ectoparasite has been observed between 0 and 2600 masl. One of the main tick control measures is the use of acaricides, which have been indiscriminately used worldwide and in Ecuador. In this country, no studies on acaricide resistance in Rhipicephalus microplus have been published. The current study aims to characterise the level of resistance of R. microplus against three main acaricides commonly used in Ecuador i.e. amitraz, alpha-cypermethrin and ivermectin to determine the level and pattern of dose-responses for R. microplus in 12 field populations (farms). The level of acaricide resistance was evaluated using three different bioassays: adult immersion test (AIT), larval package test (LPT) and larval immersion test (LIT), as recommended by the FAO. The predictive dose-responses were analysed by binomial logistics regression of the larval survival rate (resistance). In general, we found resistance of 67% for amitraz; 50% for alpha-cypermethrin and from 25 to 42% for ivermectin in the twelve field populations analysed. Resistance levels were studied in larval and adult bioassays, respectively, which were slightly modified for this study. For larval bioassays based on corrected mortality i.e. high (above 51%), medium (21-50%) and low (11-20%) resistance, percentages less than 10% were considered as susceptible. For the adult test, two resistance levels were used i.e. high (more than 76%) and medium (51 to 75%) resistance. Percentages lower than 50% were considered as susceptible. In this context, for larval bioassays, amitraz showed 21%, 38% and 8% for high, medium and low resistance, respectively. Alpha-cypermethrin presented 8%, 4 and 38% for high, medium and low resistance, respectively. Ivermectin presented 8%, 25% and 8% for high, medium and low resistance, respectively. For adult tests with amitraz 50% and 17% of the field populations showed average and high resistance, with evidences of average resistance to alpha-cypermethrin in 50% of the samples and average resistance against ivermectin in 25% of the farms. No statistical difference amongst the three bioassays was found and acaricide resistance was confirmed by logistic regression analysis; hence resistance (dose-responses) in each field populations differed, depending on the choice of the acaricide, frequent usage, frequency of treatment and farm management. The effective estimated dose needed to eliminate 99% of ticks is higher than dose recommended by the manufacturer. In conclusion, amitraz showed the highest resistance followed by ivermectin and alpha-cypermethrin and reveals differences on resistance in each individual field population. This information is important in order to establish the monitoring of resistance on each farm individually, contributing to the rational use of acaricides included in an integrated control program for R. microplus."

The Reproducibility Project Psychology (RPP) and Experimental Economics Replication Project (EE-RP) both replicated a large number of published studies in psychology and economics. The original study and replication were statistically significant in 36.1% in RPP and 68.8% in EE-RP suggesting many null effects among the replicated studies. However, evidence in favor of the null hypothesis cannot be examined with null hypothesis significance testing. We developed a Bayesian meta-analysis method called snapshot hybrid that is easy to use and understand and quantifies the amount of evidence in favor of a zero, small, medium and large effect. The method computes posterior model probabilities for a zero, small, medium, and large effect and adjusts for publication bias by taking into account that the original study is statistically significant. We first analytically approximate the methods performance, and demonstrate the necessity to control for the original study's significance to enable the accumulation of evidence for a true zero effect. Then we applied the method to the data of RPP and EE-RP, showing that the underlying effect sizes of the included studies in EE-RP are generally larger than in RPP, but that the sample sizes of especially the included studies in RPP are often too small to draw definite conclusions about the true effect size. We also illustrate how snapshot hybrid can be used to determine the required sample size of the replication akin to power analysis in null hypothesis significance testing and present an easy to use web application (https://rvanaert.shinyapps.io/snapshot/) and R code for applying the method."

Methods Thirty-five patients with SIVD, 40 patients with AD, and 33 cognitively normal control (NC) subjects matched by age and education level were consecutively recruited and underwent cognitive function assessments and DTI examinations. Comparisons among these three subgroups with regards to cognitive performance and DTI parameters including fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) values were performed. Partial correlation analysis after controlling for age and education was used to evaluate associations between cognitive performance and DTI parameters. Results With regards to cognitive performance, the patients with SIVD had lower total scores in frontal assessment battery (FAB) compared to those with AD (p < 0.05) in the context of comparable Mini-Mental Status Examination and Cognitive Abilities Screening Instrument scores. With regards to DTI parameters, there were more regions of significant differences in FA among these three subgroups compared with MD. Compared with NC group, the patients with SIVD had significant global reductions in FA (p < 0.001 ~ 0.05), while significant reductions in FA among the patients with AD were regionally confined within the left superior longitudinal fasciculus, genu and splenium of the corpus callosum, and bilateral forceps major, and the anterior thalamic radiation, uncinate fasciculus, and cingulum of the left side (p < 0.01 ~ 0.05). Analysis of FA values within the left forceps major, left anterior thalamic radiation, and genu of the corpus callosum revealed a 71.8% overall correct classification (p < 0.001) with sensitivity of 69.4%, specificity of 73.8%, positive predictive value of 69.4%, and negative predictive value of 73.8% in discriminating patients with SIVD from those with AD. In combined analysis of the patients with SIVD and AD (n = 75), the total FAB score was positively correlated with FA within the bilateral forceps minor, genu of the corpus callosum, left forceps major, left uncinate fasciculus, and right inferior longitudinal fasciculus (p = 0.001 ~ 0.038), and inversely correlated with MD within the right superior longitudinal fasciculus, genu and body of the corpus callosum, bilateral forceps minor, right uncinate fasciculus, and right inferior longitudinal fasciculus (p = 0.003 ~ 0.040) Conclusions Our findings suggest the effectiveness of DTI measurements in distinguishing patients with early-stage AD from those with SIVD, with discernible changes in spatial distribution and magnitude of significance of the DTI parameters. Strategic FA assessments provided the most robust discriminative power to differentiate SIVD from AD, and FAB may serve as an additional cognitive marker. We also identified the neuronal substrates responsible for FAB performance."
https://openalex.org/W2605202107,"Although several in vitro and ex vivo evidence support the existence of lactate exchange between astrocytes and neurons, a direct demonstration in vivo is still lacking. In the present study, a lentiviral vector carrying a short hairpin RNA (shRNA) was used to downregulate the expression of the monocarboxylate transporter type 2 (MCT2) in neurons of the rat somatosensory cortex (called S1BF) by ~ 25%. After one hour of whisker stimulation, HRMAS 1H-NMR spectroscopy analysis of S1BF perchloric acid extracts showed that while an increase in lactate content is observed in both uninjected and shRNA-control injected extracts, such an effect was abrogated in shMCT2 injected rats. A 13C-incorporation analysis following [1-13C]glucose infusion during the stimulation confirmed that the elevated lactate observed during activation originates from newly synthesized [3-13C]lactate, with blood-derived [1-13C]glucose being the precursor. Moreover, the analysis of the 13C-labeling of glutamate in position C3 and C4 indicates that upon activation, there is an increase in TCA cycle velocity for control rats while a decrease is observed for MCT2 knockdown animals. Using in vivo localized 1H-NMR spectroscopy, an increase in lactate levels is observed in the S1BF area upon whisker stimulation for shRNA-control injected rats but not for MCT2 knockdown animals. Finally, while a robust BOLD fMRI response was evidenced in control rats, it was absent in MCT2 knockdown rats. These data not only demonstrate that glucose-derived lactate is locally produced following neuronal activation but also suggest that its use by neurons via MCT2 is probably essential to maintain synaptic activity within the barrel cortex."
https://openalex.org/W2605212331,"LPS has been shown to induce hepatocyte autophagy, but little is known about how LPS is able to do this during acute toxic liver injury. Our aim was to determine the existence of any selective Ca2+ signaling coupling to hepatocyte autophagy in response to LPS. LPS increased the autophagic process in hepatocytes, and CD38 knockdown prevented this response. Ned19, a specific inhibitor for nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NAADP), prevented LPS-mediated Ca2+ signaling and autophagosome formation in hepatocytes. CD38 overexpression protected the liver from LPS/d-galactosamine (GalN)-induced injury, and NAADP administration promoted autophagosome formation and protected hepatocytes from injury induced by LPS/GalN. Autophagy was promoted by the up-regulation of autophagy-related gene expression via NAADP-mediated Ca2+ signaling in response to LPS. However, CD38-knockout mice displayed down-regulation in hepatocyte gene expression. Ned19 also inhibited the NAADP-stimulated induction of gene expression by inhibiting the LPS-induced nuclear translocation of transcription factor EB (TFEB). Hepatocyte autophagy protects against LPS-induced liver injury via the CD38/NAADP/Ca2+/TFEB pathway. The role of NAADP-mediated Ca2+ signaling in the autophagic process will help elucidate the complexities of autophagy regulation, which is essential toward the discovery of new therapeutic tools against acute liver injury.-Rah, S.-Y., Lee, Y.-H., Kim, U.-H. NAADP-mediated Ca2+ signaling promotes autophagy and protects against LPS-induced liver injury."
https://openalex.org/W2604539796,"Can CSR theory, in conjunction with a recently proposed globally calibrated CSR ordination (“StrateFy”), using only three easily measured leaf traits (leaf area, specific leaf area and leaf dry matter content) predict the functional signature of herbaceous vegetation along experimentally manipulated gradients of soil fertility and disturbance? To determine this, we grew 37 herbaceous species in mixture for five years in 24 experimental mesocosms differing in factorial levels of soil resources (stress) and density-independent mortality (disturbance). We measured 16 different functional traits and then ordinated the resulting vegetation within the CSR triangle using StrateFy. We then calculated community-weighted mean (CWM) values of the competitor (CCWM), stress-tolerator (SCWM) and ruderal (RCWM) scores for each mesocosm. We found a significant increase in SCWM from low to high stress mesocosms, and an increase in RCWM from lowly to highly disturbed mesocosms. However, CCWM did not decline significantly as intensity of stress or disturbance increased, as predicted by CSR theory. This last result likely arose because our herbaceous species were relatively poor competitors in global comparisons and thus no strong competitors in our species pool were selectively favoured in low stress and low disturbed mesocosms. Variation in the 13 other traits, not used by StrateFy, largely argeed with the predictions of CSR theory. StrateFy worked surprisingly well in our experimental study except for the C-dimension. Despite loss of some precision, it has great potential applicability in future studies due to its simplicity and generality."
https://openalex.org/W2605051162,"Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) show variable methylation patterns between lines, some of which reflect aberrant differences relative to embryonic stem cells (ESCs). To examine whether this aberrant methylation results from genetic variation or non-genetic mechanisms, we generated human iPSCs from monozygotic twins to investigate how genetic background, clone, and passage number contribute. We found that aberrantly methylated CpGs are enriched in regulatory regions associated with MYC protein motifs and affect gene expression. We classified differentially methylated CpGs as being associated with genetic and/or non-genetic factors (clone and passage), and we found that aberrant methylation preferentially occurs at CpGs associated with clone-specific effects. We further found that clone-specific effects play a strong role in recurrent aberrant methylation at specific CpG sites across different studies. Our results argue that a non-genetic biological mechanism underlies aberrant methylation in iPSCs and that it is likely based on a probabilistic process involving MYC that takes place during or shortly after reprogramming."
https://openalex.org/W2605275656,"As the atmosphere warms, precipitation events are becoming less frequent but more intense. A three-year experiment in Kruger National Park, South Africa, found that fewer, more intense precipitation events encouraged woody plant encroachment. To test whether or not these treatment responses persisted over time, here, we report results from all five years of that experiment. Grass growth, woody plant growth, total fine root number and area and hydrologic tracer uptake by grasses and woody plants were measured in six treated plots (8 m by 8 m) and six control plots. Treatment effects on soil moisture were measured continuously in one treated and one control plot. During the fourth year, increased precipitation intensity treatments continued to decrease water flux in surface soils (0-10 cm), increase water flux in deeper soils (20+ cm), decrease grass growth and increase woody plant growth. Greater root numbers at 20-40 cm and greater woody plant uptake of a hydrological tracer from 45-60 cm suggested that woody plants increased growth by increasing root number and activity (but not root area) in deeper soils. During the fifth year, natural precipitation events were large and intense so treatments had little effect on precipitation intensity or plant available water. Consistent with this effective treatment removal, there was no difference in grass or woody growth rates between control and treated plots, although woody plant biomass remained higher in treated than control plots due to treatment effects in the previous four years. Across the five years of this experiment, we found that 1) small increases in precipitation intensity can result in large increases in deep (20-130 cm) soil water availability, 2) plant growth responses to precipitation intensity are rapid and disappear quickly, and 3) because woody plants accumulate biomass, occasional increases in precipitation intensity can result in long-term increases in woody plant biomass (i.e., shrub encroachment). While results are likely to be site-specific, they provide experimental evidence of large ecohydrological responses to small changes in precipitation intensity."
https://openalex.org/W2605067878,"Asian pangolins are a highly-threatened species group, mainly due to the perceived medicinal value of their scales. Increased demand from China has resulted in pangolins being the most trafficked mammal in the world. Three pangolin species are reported to occur in Bangladesh: Manis pentadactyla, M. crassicaudata, and M. javanica. No peer-reviewed studies exist detailing these species' current distribution or status within Bangladesh. A literature review was conducted resulting in the clarification of conflicting reports and misidentified observations and specimen records. In this paper, we also report the current status of pangolins (Manis spp.) in Bangladesh based on semi-structured interviews, camera trapping, media queries, and field surveys employing traditional ecological knowledge and non-randomized transect surveys. Ethnozoological knowledge pertaining to the natural history of M. pentadactyla is also reported from experienced Mro tribal hunters. The critically endangered M. pentadactyla was verified to occur in northwest, northeast, and southeast Bangladesh in natural and degraded habitats. Interviews with the Mro tribe in the southeast indicate that pangolin populations there were likely extirpated in 2014 due to skilled commercial collection beginning in 2010. Evidence of extant M. crassicaudata and M. javanica populations remain unverified and questionable, and historical records of M. crassicaudata and M. javanica are likely a result of misidentification."
https://openalex.org/W2604716615,"We are fortunate to be living in an era of twin biomedical data surges: a burgeoning representation of human phenotypes in the medical records of our healthcare systems, and high-throughput sequencing making rapid technological advances. The difficulty representing genomic data and its annotations has almost by itself led to the recognition of a biomedical ""Big Data"" challenge, and the complexity of healthcare data only compounds the problem to the point that coherent representation of both systems on the same platform seems insuperably difficult. We investigated the capability for complex, integrative genomic and clinical queries to be supported in the Informatics for Integrating Biology and the Bedside (i2b2) translational software package. Three different data integration approaches were developed: The first is based on Sequence Ontology, the second is based on the tranSMART engine, and the third on CouchDB. These novel methods for representing and querying complex genomic and clinical data on the i2b2 platform are available today for advancing precision medicine."
https://openalex.org/W2605167562,"The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute’s Next Generation Genetic Association Studies Consortium has used induced pluripotent stem cell technology to study the effects of common genetic variants in vitro. This issue of Cell Stem Cell and affiliated journals include several manuscripts describing the results of the consortium’s efforts. The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute’s Next Generation Genetic Association Studies Consortium has used induced pluripotent stem cell technology to study the effects of common genetic variants in vitro. This issue of Cell Stem Cell and affiliated journals include several manuscripts describing the results of the consortium’s efforts. In the late 2000s and early 2010s, technological innovations enlivened the fields of molecular profiling, computational biology, induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) reprogramming, and genome editing. In parallel to these developments, discoveries potentiated by the genome-wide association study (GWAS) and quantitative trait locus (QTL) methodologies highlighted the influence of common genetic variants on polygenic diseases and quantitative traits. These scientific advancements inspired speculation about modeling GWAS and QTL phenotypes in vitro with iPSCs. Supported by funding from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), the Next Generation Genetic Association Studies (NextGen) Consortium convened in 2011 to test a promising experimental paradigm: using iPSCs derived from extensively phenotyped participants to study the complex genetics of common diseases in clinical studies and population cohorts. The NextGen Consortium was loosely organized around the idea of using iPSCs to model causal effects of human genetic variation on a range of heart, lung, and blood cellular phenotypes. Based on a funding announcement released in 2010, several studies were funded to use this approach and were asked by the NHLBI to work together to address shared challenges. This coordination resulted in the NextGen Consortium, whose primary goals included the development and quantitative assessment of over 2,000 iPSC lines, complementation of GWASs and QTLs with in vitro data, and modeling the phenotypes of complex genetic syndromes using differentiated cells. At the outset of the study, many hurdles stood in the way of investigating common genetic variants with iPSCs. The experimental design required massive cohorts of iPSC lines, differentiation into functional cell types at scale, and the looming question of whether the field possessed sufficient mastery over iPSC technology to accurately perform population-based genetics experiments in vitro. The NextGen Consortium chose to investigate a wide array of genotypes and phenotypes (Table 1) relevant to the NHLBI’s mission. Here we will describe the rationale behind the NextGen Consortium’s efforts, highlight our resulting publications, and look toward the future of in vitro population genetics and iPSC applications. The papers included in this coordinated release fall into three overall categories: studies of iPSC variability, in vitro tissue-specific eQTL studies, and investigations of functional cardiovascular disease phenotypes using iPSC differentiation.Table 1Focus of the NextGen Consortium’s StudiesLead InvestigatorInstitutionCell Type of FocusGenetic Modeling AimLewis BeckerJohns Hopkins Universitymegakaryocytesgenetic determinants of platelet aggregationUlrich BroeckelMedical College of Wisconsincardiomyocytesleft ventricular hypertrophyChad CowanHarvard Universityhepatocyteshepatic phenotypes associated with the 1p13 locusKelly FrazerUniversity of California, San Diegocardiomyocyteslong QT syndromeThomas QuertermousStanford Universityendothelial cellsinsulin resistanceMarlene RabinovitchStanford Universityendothelial cellsfamilial pulmonary arterial hypertensionDaniel RaderUniversity of Pennsylvaniahepatocyteshepatic eQTLs and lipid handlingMartin SteinbergBoston Universityerythroid cellssickle-cell anemiaEric TopolScripps Research Instituteendothelial cellsthe 9p21 locus in atherosclerosis Open table in a new tab The first hurdle in any iPSC project is reprogramming somatic cells to pluripotency, and variability is an inherent part of this process. Previous studies have identified common sources of iPSC variability including cell type of origin, reprogramming method, culture method, lab of origin, and genetic background. Several of the papers in this initial feature describe the NextGen Consortium’s efforts to assess iPSC variability, focused on the contribution of common genetic variants to expression (eQTLs), epigenetic memory, and methods for eliminating experimental variability during reprogramming. eQTL analyses performed in vivo using primary tissues have revealed the contribution of common genetic variants to tissue-specific gene expression profiles. These phenotypes are often subtle, and for this reason eQTL analyses require hundreds of primary samples in order to discover new eQTL genes. Until now, insufficient cohort sizes have precluded eQTL analyses using iPSCs. However, with a large enough cohort of iPSC lines, it would be possible to assess QTL phenotypes in pluripotent cells. Studies headed by the Quertermous and Frazer laboratories have generated hundreds of clonal iPSC lines to identify iPSC-specific eQTL genes (Carcamo-Orive et al., 2017Carcamo-Orive I. Hoffman G.E. Cundiff P. Beckmann N.D. D’Souza S.L. Knowles J.W. Patel A. Papatsenko D. Abbasi F.

Their analyses describe the transcriptional variation inherent in their iPSC cohort, and use genome-wide sequencing and genotyping to identify the fraction of variability that is derived from the genetic background of the iPSC lines. The strength of this design lies in the size of the population sample and the depth of transcriptional coverage. Both studies go beyond the performance of iPSC-specific eQTLs and make deeper discoveries including identification of causal variants and using computational techniques to identify secondary drivers of iPSC variability. Epigenetic state has been implicated in iPSC variability in the past, with the term “epigenetic memory” conveying the concept that iPSCs will in some cases retain the epigenetic landscape of the original donor cells. The NextGen Consortium project includes an ongoing effort to profile methylated regions of the genome in our entire iPSC cohort. We will compare transcriptional and methylation profiles in our iPSCs, and correlate with genotype and differentiation in certain datasets. One of the current studies compared DNA methylation in iPSCs reprogrammed from monozygotic twins, discovering a phenomenon driving variation between otherwise genetically matched clonal iPSC lines (Panopoulos et al., 2017aPanopoulos A.D. Smith E.N. Arias A.D. Shepard P.J. Hishida Y. Modesto V. Diffenderfer K.E. Conner C. Biggs W. Sandoval E. et al.Cell Stem Cell. 2017; 20 (this issue): 505-517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). These results will be built upon using DNA methylation data from the whole consortium’s iPSC lines. Our aim is to use computational biology to identify genetic motifs and cell signaling pathways common to certain epigenetic states and predictive of iPSC function, to allow a priori selection of iPSC lines well-suited to future experiments. While this consortium’s findings offer insights into the genetic and epigenetic drivers of iPSC variability, experimental variation also contributes to iPSC identity. As part of their work with the consortium, the Frazer lab has prepared a methodology to reduce variability in iPSC lines by streamlining quality control of newly reprogrammed iPSCs (D’Antonio et al., 2017D’Antonio M. Woodruff G. Nathanson J.L. D’Antonio-Chronowska A. Arias A. Matsui H. Williams R. Herrera C. Reyna S.M. Yeo G.W. et al.Stem Cell Reports. 2017; (in press. Published online April 11, 2017)https://doi.org/10.1016/j.stemcr.2017.03.011Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Innovation of this sort was one of the intended outcomes of the consortium’s efforts, in the hope of spurring larger and more standardized reprogramming efforts in the iPSC field. GWASs and QTLs have garnered insights into the genetic drivers of human biology. Based on these approaches, the scientific community now appreciates the polygenic nature of many common diseases and traits, including the hundreds of loci attributed to cardiovascular disease risk (Kathiresan and Srivastava, 2012Kathiresan S. Srivastava D. Cell. 2012; 148: 1242-1257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Large community cohorts have enabled GWASs and QTLs, but one weakness of these studies is the lack of biological material for the investigation of cellular phenotypes associated with risk loci. Using directed differentiation, the NextGen Consortium has tested the capacity of iPSCs to provide such a complementary cellular resource to support the robust experimental toolkit of population genetics and functional genomics. In addition to the study of iPSC variability, a core goal of the consortium is to differentiate functional cell types to study cell-type-specific effects of common genetic variants. In so doing, we aim to determine the value of iPSC-derived functional cell types for performing various QTLs impossible to perform in vivo or ex vivo. A significant advantage of this study design over traditional population genetics is readily available cellular material for functional assays, known as functional QTL (fQTL) studies. Primary cell types that are difficult to procure would be ideal candidates for in vitro fQTLs because iPSCs can, in principle, generate any somatic cell type. In the current publications, we have focused on cell types of interest to the mission of the NHLBI, including hepatocyte-like cells (HLCs), cardiomyocytes, adipocytes, endothelial cells, vascular smooth muscle cells, and myeloid cells. One of the intended outputs of the NextGen Consortium’s efforts was to spur improvement in directed differentiation protocols. When the study began, many of these techniques were undeveloped or non-existent. We now have adequate expertise to differentiate large cohorts of iPSCs to various cell types, and have used these protocols to carry out eQTL and fQTL analyses. In vitro cell-type-specific eQTL analyses performed by the Cowan, Musunuru, and Frazer labs are presented here (Warren et al., 2017Warren C.R. O’Sullivan J.F. Friesen M. Becker C.E. Zhang X. Liu P.

Because we are developing a new approach, we initially recruited one cohort with the intent to replicate an eQTL study performed in vivo. This proof-of-principle study accurately recreated the in vivo phenotype, validating the in vitro approach to performing biologically relevant eQTLs (Warren et al., 2017Warren C.R. O’Sullivan J.F.

In vitro QTLs are distinguished from in vivo QTLs in that phenotypes in vitro must be cell autonomous. We expect that effective in vitro QTL cohorts used for discovery will be smaller than those required using primary tissue because of purification of the target cell type from the various cell types constituting tissues. Forthcoming manuscripts will focus on QTL analyses using other cell types of interest. iPSCs have proved particularly valuable in modeling rare diseases. In contrast to polygenic disease, rare Mendelian disease has a simple monogenic provenance; mutation of a single gene drives disease phenotypes. For this reason, modeling Mendelian disease in iPSCs using directed differentiation often requires no more than a small cohort of participants and cognate reprogrammed cells. The challenge for the NextGen Consortium in modeling polygenic disease was managing the reprogramming and differentiation of a large cohort of iPSCs for detection of the effect of common SNPs on cellular functions. Many common diseases such as “cardiovascular disease” comprise a suite of distinct but related diseases of various genetic etiologies. Several manuscripts produced by our consortium have used relatively large iPSC cohorts to dissect the genetic contribution to specific subtypes of common disease. Our iPSC cohort designs reflected the various areas of focus for each lab group. The “Wellderly” cohort included elderly participants free of conspicuous disease, whereas other cohorts included carriers of particular subtypes of common disease, such as left ventricular hypertrophy, sickle cell anemia (Park et al., 2017Park S. Gianotti-Sommer A. Molina-Estevez F.J. Vanuytsel K. Skvir N. Leung A. Rozelle S.S. Shaikho E.M. Weir I.

One study used a familial hypercholesterolemia cohort to perform a “trial in a dish,” screening the effect of chemical compounds on hepatic LDL uptake (Cayo et al., 2017Cayo M.A. Mallanna S.K.

Two other studies discovered novel underlying mechanisms of Tangier disease (Bi et al., 2017Bi X. Pashos E.E. Cuchel M. Lyssenko N.N. Hernandez M. Picataggi A. McParland J. Yang W. Liu Y. Yan R. et al.EBioMedicine. 2017; (Published online March 14, 2017)https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ebiom.2017.03.018Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (21) Google Scholar) and familial pulmonary arterial hypertension (Gu et al., 2017Gu M. Shao N.Y. Sa S. Li D. Termglinchan V. Ameen M. Karakikes I. Sosa G. Grubert F. Lee J. et al.Cell Stem Cell. 2017; 20 (this issue): 490-504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) using transcriptomics and genome editing. We expect that the “trial-in-a-dish,” molecular profiling, and genome editing methodologies employed in these manuscripts will be attractive strategies for studying common diseases with iPSCs. In the course of these studies, we have established many resources that will be of value to the field. Our laboratories have developed the expertise and techniques to perform large-scale reprogramming and differentiation efforts, as detailed in our publications. The molecular profiling datasets produced here will be publically available and should provide insights into the identity of iPSCs and their functional characteristics relevant to differentiation and disease modeling. As an auxiliary product of the consortium, we are making available hundreds of the iPSC lines reprogrammed during these studies. They represent a variety of ethnicities and cell types of origin, were reprogrammed using several different protocols, and have been differentiated into various functional cell types. Although the characterization of these cell lines is not comprehensive, we are happy to provide them in the hope that they will ease the burden of reprogramming for future studies. These iPSC lines will be made available through WiCell in line with standard policies for academic and corporate users. We believe that this consortium’s results should encourage ambitious iPSC-driven genetic studies. Collaborative projects are ongoing among our groups, with several manuscripts forthcoming. Although the NextGen Consortium’s efforts were constrained by budget and funding period, it is formally possible to reprogram iPSC lines from every member of the population. Population-scale iPSC reprogramming initiatives will allow for the selection of any imaginable cohort, facilitating any in vitro QTL study or GWAS of interest. With support from funding agencies and industrial collaborations, fQTL analyses performed with iPSCs have the potential to bridge the gap between population genetics and studies of cellular mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W2605211328,"Urban biodiversity conservation often aims to promote the quality of life for urban residents by providing ecosystem services as well as habitats for diverse wildlife. However, biodiversity inevitably brings some disadvantages, including problems and nuisances caused by wildlife. Although some studies have reported that enhancement of nature interaction among urban children promotes their affective attitude toward of favorable animals, its effect on tolerance toward problem-causing wildlife is unknown. In this study, we assessed the tolerance of 1,030 urban residents in Japan toward hornets and wild boar, and analyzed the effects of childhood experience with nature on tolerance using a structural equation model. The model used sociodemographic factors and childhood nature experience as explanatory variables, affective attitude toward these animals as a mediator, and tolerance as a response variable. The public tolerance toward hornets and boars was low; over 60% of the respondents would request the removal of hornets and wild boar from nearby green spaces by government services, even when the animals had not caused any damage. Tolerance was lower in females and elderly respondents. Childhood experience with nature had a greater influence on tolerance than did sociodemographic factors in the scenario where animals have not caused any problems; however, its effect was only indirect via promoting positive affective attitude toward wildlife when the animals have caused problems. Our results suggest that increasing people's direct experience with nature is important to raise public tolerance, but its effect is limited to cases where wildlife does not cause any problems. To obtain wider support for conservation in urban areas, conservationists, working together with municipal officials, educators and the media, should provide relevant information on the ecological functions performed by problem-causing wildlife and strategies for avoiding the problems that wildlife can cause."
https://openalex.org/W2604453249,"Tubulin alpha 8 (Tuba8) is the most divergent member of the highly conserved alpha tubulin family, and uniquely lacks two key post-translational modification sites. It is abundantly expressed in testis and muscle, with lower levels in the brain. We previously identified homozygous hypomorphic TUBA8 mutations in human subjects with a polymicrogyria (PMG) syndrome, suggesting its involvement in development of the cerebral cortex. We have now generated and characterized a Tuba8 knockout mouse model. Homozygous mice were confirmed to lack Tuba8 protein in the testis, but did not display PMG and appeared to be neurologically normal. In response to this finding, we re-analyzed the human PMG subjects using whole exome sequencing. This resulted in identification of an additional homozygous loss-of-function mutation in SNAP29, suggesting that SNAP29 deficiency, rather than TUBA8 deficiency, may underlie most or all of the neurodevelopmental anomalies in these subjects. Nonetheless, in the mouse brain, Tuba8 specifically localised to the cerebellar Purkinje cells, suggesting that the human mutations may affect or modify motor control. In the testis, Tuba8 localisation was cell-type specific. It was restricted to spermiogenesis with a strong acrosomal localization that was gradually replaced by cytoplasmic distribution and was absent from spermatozoa. Although the knockout mice were fertile, the localisation pattern indicated that Tuba8 may have a role in spermatid development during spermatogenesis, rather than as a component of the mature microtubule-rich flagellum itself."

Methods A population-based cohort of new statin users (ages 40-79, years 1999-2012) was derived from a large Israeli healthcare services organization. Data included history of statin purchases and low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels. Personal statin adherence was measured annually by the proportion of days covered (PDC). PD was detected employing a drug-tracer approach. Stratified (by sex, LDL-C levels at baseline and age) Cox proportional hazards models with time-dependent covariates were used to compute adjusted Hazard Ratio (HR) with 95%CI. Results The cohort included 232,877 individuals, 49.3% men. Mean age at first statin purchase was 56.5 (±9.8) years for men and 58.7 (±9.2) years for women. PDC distribution for the whole follow up period differed between men and women: medians 58.3% and 54.1% respectively. During a mean follow up of 7.6 (±3.4) years, 2,550 (1.1%) PD cases were identified. In a 1-year lagged analysis, we found no association between annual statin adherence and PD risk in all age-groups regardless of statin type and potency. Age-pooled HR (95%CI) for men and women with LDL-C levels at baseline ≤160mg/dL were: 0.99 (0.99-1.01), 1.01 (1.00-1.02); and for men and women with LDL-C >160mg/dL levels: 0.99 (0.98-1.01), 0.97 (0.98-1.01). Conclusions Our findings suggest that statin adherence over time does not affect PD risk. Future studies should use large-scale cohorts and refining assessments of long-term profiles in statin adherence."
https://openalex.org/W2604481818,"Research on social processes in the production of scientific output suggests that the collective research agenda of a discipline is influenced by its structural features, such as “invisible colleges” or “groups of collaborators” as well as academic “stars” that are embedded in, or connect, these research groups. Based on an encompassing dataset that takes into account multiple publication types including journals and chapters in edited volumes, we analyze the complete co-authorship network of all 1,339 researchers in German political science. Through the use of consensus graph clustering techniques and descriptive centrality measures, we identify the ten largest research clusters, their research topics, and the most central researchers who act as bridges and connect these clusters. We also aggregate the findings at the level of research organizations and consider the inter-university co-authorship network. The findings indicate that German political science is structured by multiple overlapping research clusters with a dominance of the subfields of international relations, comparative politics and political sociology. A small set of well-connected universities takes leading roles in these informal research groups."
https://openalex.org/W2604222668,"Numerous environmental factors can influence body size. Comparing populations in different ecological contexts is one potential approach to elucidating the most critical of such factors. In the current study, we found that the body size of the land hermit crab Coenobita rugosus was significantly larger on Dongsha Island in the South China Sea than on other eco-islands around Southern Taiwan. We hypothesized that this could be due to differences in (1) shell resources, (2) parasite impact, (3) competition, (4) predation, and (5) food. We found no supporting evidence for the first three hypotheses; the shells used by the hermit crabs on Dongsha were in poorer condition than were those used elsewhere, extremely few individuals in the region had ectoparasites, and the density of hermit crabs varied considerably among localities within each island. However, significantly higher percentages of C. rugosus reached age 3 years on Dongsha than at Siziwan bay in Taiwan. Two growth rate indices inferred from size structures suggested faster growth on Dongsha than at Siziwan. The condition index (i.e., the body mass/shield length ratio of C. rugosus) was also greater on Dongsha than at Siziwan. Therefore, Dongsha hermit crabs seem to have superior diet and growth performance. Seagrass debris accumulation at the shore of Dongsha was considerable, whereas none was observed at Siziwan or on the other islands, where dicot leaves were the dominant food item for the vegetarian hermit crabs. We then experimentally evaluated the possible role of seagrass as food for C. rugosus. The crabs on Dongsha preferred seagrass to dicot leaves, and their growth increment was faster when they fed on seagrass than when they fed on dicot leaves; no such differences were found in the Siziwan hermit crabs. The aforementioned results are compatible with the food hypothesis explaining the size differences among the islands. The predator hypothesis could explain the greater life span but not the other findings. Populations of C. rugosus on islands with seagrass debris piles probably contribute more to the gene pool of the species because higher proportions of these populations could achieve high fecundity. The fate of these terrestrial hermit crabs may rely on the health of underwater seagrass ecosystems that are under threat from global change."
https://openalex.org/W2604956851,"Atlantic Sturgeon is listed under the U.S. Endangered Species Act as five Distinct Population Segments (DPS). The endangered New York Bight (NYB) DPS is thought to only harbor two populations; one in the Hudson River and a second smaller one in the Delaware River. Historically, the Connecticut River probably supported a spawning population of Atlantic Sturgeon that was believed extirpated many decades ago. In 2014, we successfully collected pre-migratory juvenile specimens from the lower Connecticut River which were subjected to mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) control region sequence and microsatellite analyses to determine their genetic relatedness to other populations coastwide. Haplotype and allelic frequencies differed significantly between the Connecticut River collection and all other populations coastwide. Sibship analyses of the microsatellite data indicated that the Connecticut River collection was comprised of a small number of families that were likely the offspring of a limited number of breeders. This was supported by analysis of effective population size (Ne) and number of breeders (Nb). STRUCTURE analysis suggested that there were 11 genetic clusters among the coastwide collections and that from the Connecticut River was distinct from those in all other rivers. This was supported by UPGMA analyses of the microsatellite data. In AMOVA analyses, among region variation was maximized, and among population within regions variation minimized when the Connecticut River collection was separate from the other two populations in the NYB DPS indicating the dissimilarity between the Connecticut River collection and the other two populations in the NYB DPS. Use of mixed stock analysis indicated that the Connecticut River juvenile collection was comprised of specimens primarily of South Atlantic and Chesapeake Bay DPS origins. The most parsimonious explanation for these results is that the Connecticut River hosted successful natural reproduction in 2013 and that its offspring were descendants of a small number of colonizers from populations south of the NYB DPS, most notably the South Atlantic DPS. Our results run contrary to the belief that re-colonizers of extirpated populations primarily originate in proximal populations."
https://openalex.org/W2605160347,"Inflammatory processes play critical roles in epileptogenesis, but the exact mechanisms that underlie these processes are still not completely understood. In this study, we investigated the role of forkhead transcription factor 3 (Foxp3), a transcription factor that is involved in T-cell differentiation, in epileptogenesis. In both human epileptic tissues and experimental seizure models, we found significant up-regulation of Foxp3 in neurons and glial cells. Of importance, Foxp3-/- mice were susceptible to kainic acid-induced seizures, whereas overexpression of Foxp3 reduced acute seizure occurrence and decreased chronic seizure recurrence. In addition, in vitro experiments revealed that Foxp3 inhibited neuronal excitability via glial cells and not neurons. The protective effects of Foxp3 were manifested as a reduction in glial cell activation and proinflammatory cytokine production and increased neuronal survival. Moreover, we showed that beneficial effects of Foxp3 involved the attenuation of TLR4 signaling and inflammation, which led to the inactivation of NR2B-containing NMDA receptors. These results suggest that Foxp3 in glial cells may play an antiepileptic role in epileptogenesis and may act as a modulator of TLR4. Taken together, our results indicate that Foxp3 may represent a novel therapeutic target for achieving anticonvulsant effects in patients with epilepsy that is currently resistant to drugs.-Wang, F.-X., Xiong, X.-Y., Zhong, Q., Meng, Z.-Y., Yang, H., Yang, Q.-W. Foxp3 exhibits antiepileptic effects in ictogenesis involved in TLR4 signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2604454272,"NAD+ has emerged as a crucial element in both bioenergetic and signaling pathways since it acts as a key regulator of cellular and organismal homeostasis. Among the enzymes involved in its recycling, nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) deamidase is one of the key players in the bacterial pyridine nucleotide cycle, where it catalyzes the conversion of NMN into nicotinic acid mononucleotide (NaMN), which is later converted to NAD+ in the Preiss-Handler pathway. The biochemical characteristics of bacterial NMN deamidases have been poorly studied, although they have been investigated in some firmicutes, gamma-proteobacteria and actinobacteria. In this study, we present the first characterization of an NMN deamidase from an alphaproteobacterium, Agrobacterium tumefaciens (AtCinA). The enzyme was active over a broad pH range, with an optimum at pH 7.5. Moreover, the enzyme was quite stable at neutral pH, maintaining 55% of its activity after 14 days. Surprisingly, AtCinA showed the highest optimal (80°C) and melting (85°C) temperatures described for an NMN deamidase. The above described characteristics, together with its high catalytic efficiency, make AtCinA a promising biocatalyst for the production of pure NaMN. In addition, six mutants (C32A, S48A, Y58F, Y58A, T105A and R145A) were designed to study their involvement in substrate binding, and two (S31A and K63A) to determine their contribution to the catalysis. However, only four mutants (C32A, S48A Y58F and T105A) showed activity, although with reduced catalytic efficiency. These results, combined with a thermal and structural analysis, reinforce the Ser/Lys catalytic dyad mechanism as the most plausible among those proposed."
https://openalex.org/W2605323293,"Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection may induce inflammatory cytokines or adipokines that influence bone turnover and bone fracture risk. This study aimed to evaluate the association among H. pylori infection, adipokines, and 10-year fracture risk using the Fracture Risk Assessment Tool scale. From August 2013 to February 2016, a community-based cohort was surveyed by Keelung Chang-Gung Memorial Hospital. Subjects were included if they were older than 40 years and not pregnant. All participants underwent a standardized questionnaire survey, physical examination, urea breath test, and blood tests. A total of 2,689 participants (1,792 women) were included in this cross-sectional study. In both sexes, participants with a high fracture risk were older and had higher adiponectin values than participants without a high fracture risk (mean age, female: 72.9 ± 5.6 vs. 55.8 ± 7.3 years, P < 0.0001; male: 78.9 ± 4.7 vs. 58.1 ± 8.9 years, P < 0.001) (adiponectin, female: 10.8 ± 6.3 vs. 8.7 ± 5.2 ng/ml, P < 0.001; male: 9.7 ± 6.1 vs. 5.5 ± 3.8 ng/ml, P < 0.001). Adiponectin was correlated with high fracture risk in both sexes, but H. pylori infection and leptin was not. In logistic regression analysis, adiponectin could not predict high fracture risk when adjusting the factor of body mass index (BMI) in men group. In conclusion, H. pylori infection and leptin could not predict 10-year fracture risk in either sex. Adiponectin was correlated with bone fracture risk in both sexes and the correlation might be from the influence of BMI."
https://openalex.org/W2604913906,"Determining the extent of reproductive isolation in cryptic species with dynamic geographic ranges can yield important insights into the processes that generate and maintain genetic divergence in the absence of severe geographic barriers. We studied mating patterns, propensity to hybridize in nature and subsequent fertilization rates, as well as survival and development of hybrid F1 offspring for three nominal species of the Engystomops petersi species complex in Yasuní National Park, Ecuador. We found at least two species in four out of six locations sampled, and 14.3% of the wild pairs genotyped were mixed-species (heterospecific) crosses. We also found reduced fertilization rates in hybrid crosses between E. petersi females and E. “magnus” males, and between E. “magnus” females and E. “selva” males but not in the reciprocal crosses, suggesting asymmetric reproductive isolation for these species. Larval development times decreased in F1 hybrid crosses compared to same species (conspecific) crosses, but we did not find significant reduction in larval survival or early metamorph survival. Our results show evidence of post-mating isolation for at least two hybrid crosses of the cryptic species we studied. The general decrease in fertilization rates in heterospecific crosses suggests that sexual selection and reinforcement might have not only contributed to the pattern of call variation and behavioral isolation we see between species today, but they may also contribute to further signal divergence and behavioral evolution, especially in locations where hybridization is common and fertilization success is diminished."

https://openalex.org/W2604959386,"The combination external-beam radiotherapy and high-dose-rate brachytherapy is a standard form of treatment for patients with locally advanced uterine cervical cancer. Personalized radiotherapy in cervical cancer requires efficient and accurate dose planning and assessment across these types of treatment. To achieve radiation dose assessment, accurate mapping of the dose distribution from HDR-BT onto EBRT is extremely important. However, few systems can achieve robust dose fusion and determine the accumulated dose distribution during the entire course of treatment. We have therefore developed a toolbox (FZUImageReg), which is a user-friendly dose fusion system based on hybrid image registration for radiation dose assessment in cervical cancer radiotherapy. The main part of the software consists of a collection of medical image registration algorithms and a modular design with a user-friendly interface, which allows users to quickly configure, test, monitor, and compare different registration methods for a specific application. Owing to the large deformation, the direct application of conventional state-of-the-art image registration methods is not sufficient for the accurate alignment of EBRT and HDR-BT images. To solve this problem, a multi-phase non-rigid registration method using local landmark-based free-form deformation is proposed for locally large deformation between EBRT and HDR-BT images, followed by intensity-based free-form deformation. With the transformation, the software also provides a dose mapping function according to the deformation field. The total dose distribution during the entire course of treatment can then be presented. Experimental results clearly show that the proposed system can achieve accurate registration between EBRT and HDR-BT images and provide radiation dose warping and fusion results for dose assessment in cervical cancer radiotherapy in terms of high accuracy and efficiency."
https://openalex.org/W2604947021,"When we think of the word “contagious,” we often think of something negative, like the flu. But transmitted diseases aren’t the only thing that can quickly spread within a society—certain feelings, emotions, and behaviors can be easier to catch than the common cold. Does seeing others laugh or yawn make you want to do it too? You’re definitely not alone—“behavioral contagion,” or the tendency for a behavior exhibited by one or more people to be rapidly copied by others, is a well-documented phenomenon in psychology."
