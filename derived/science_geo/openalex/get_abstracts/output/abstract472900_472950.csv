https://openalex.org/W2091210052,"Here we show that Mst1, a proapoptotic kinase, impairs protein quality control mechanisms in the heart through inhibition of autophagy. Stress-induced activation of Mst1 in cardiomyocytes promoted accumulation of p62 and aggresome formation, accompanied by the disappearance of autophagosomes. Mst1 phosphorylated the Thr108 residue in the BH3 domain of Beclin1, which enhanced the interaction between Beclin1 and Bcl-2 and/or Bcl-xL, stabilized the Beclin1 homodimer, inhibited the phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase activity of the Atg14L-Beclin1-Vps34 complex and suppressed autophagy. Furthermore, Mst1-induced sequestration of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL by Beclin1 allows Bax to become active, thereby stimulating apoptosis. Mst1 promoted cardiac dysfunction in mice subjected to myocardial infarction by inhibiting autophagy, associated with increased levels of Thr108-phosphorylated Beclin1. Moreover, dilated cardiomyopathy in humans was associated with increased levels of Thr108-phosphorylated Beclin1 and signs of autophagic suppression. These results suggest that Mst1 coordinately regulates autophagy and apoptosis by phosphorylating Beclin1 and consequently modulating a three-way interaction among Bcl-2 proteins, Beclin1 and Bax."

https://openalex.org/W2060631152,"Long-term ex vivo live imaging combined with unbiased sampling of cycling precursors shows that macaque outer subventricular zone (OSVZ) includes four distinct basal radial glial (bRG) cell morphotypes, bearing apical and/or basal processes in addition to nonpolar intermediate progenitors (IPs). Each of the five precursor types exhibits extensive self-renewal and proliferative capacities as well as the ability to directly generate neurons, albeit with different frequencies. Cell-cycle parameters exhibited an unusual stage-specific regulation with short cell-cycle duration and increased rates of proliferative divisions during supragranular layer production at late corticogenesis. State transition analysis of an extensive clonal database reveals bidirectional transitions between OSVZ precursor types as well as stage-specific differences in their progeny and topology of the lineage relationships. These results explore rodent-primate differences and show that primate cortical neurons are generated through complex lineages by a mosaic of precursors, thereby providing an innovative framework for understanding specific features of primate corticogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2046385403,"Sirtuin 1 (Sirt1), a NAD(+)-regulated deacetylase with numerous known positive effects on cellular and whole-body metabolism, is expressed in the renal cortex and medulla. It is known to have protective effects against age-related disease, including diabetes. Here we investigated the protective role of Sirt1 in diabetic renal damage. We found that Sirt1 in proximal tubules (PTs) was downregulated before albuminuria occurred in streptozotocin-induced or obese (db/db) diabetic mice. PT-specific SIRT1 transgenic and Sirt1 knockout mice showed prevention and aggravation of the glomerular changes that occur in diabetes, respectively, and nondiabetic knockout mice exhibited albuminuria, suggesting that Sirt1 in PTs affects glomerular function. Downregulation of Sirt1 and upregulation of the tight junction protein Claudin-1 by SIRT1-mediated epigenetic regulation in podocytes contributed to albuminuria. We did not observe these phenomena in 5/6 nephrectomized mice. We also demonstrated retrograde interplay from PTs to glomeruli using nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) from conditioned medium, measurement of the autofluorescence of photoactivatable NMN and injection of fluorescence-labeled NMN. In human subjects with diabetes, the levels of SIRT1 and Claudin-1 were correlated with proteinuria levels. These results suggest that Sirt1 in PTs protects against albuminuria in diabetes by maintaining NMN concentrations around glomeruli, thus influencing podocyte function."
https://openalex.org/W1988903229,"Regeneration and homeostasis in the adult intestinal epithelium is driven by proliferative resident stem cells, whose functional properties during organismal development are largely unknown. Here, we show that human and mouse fetal intestine contains proliferative, immature progenitors, which can be expanded in vitro as Fetal Enterospheres (FEnS). A highly similar progenitor population can be established during intestinal differentiation of human induced pluripotent stem cells. Established cultures of mouse fetal intestinal progenitors express lower levels of Lgr5 than mature progenitors and propagate in the presence of the Wnt antagonist Dkk1, and new cultures can be induced to form mature intestinal organoids by exposure to Wnt3a. Following transplantation in a colonic injury model, FEnS contribute to regeneration of colonic epithelium by forming epithelial crypt-like structures expressing region-specific differentiation markers. This work provides insight into mechanisms underlying development of the mammalian intestine and points to future opportunities for patient-specific regeneration of the digestive tract."
https://openalex.org/W2084881895,"Many organs with a high cell turnover (for example, skin, intestine and blood) are composed of short-lived cells that require continuous replenishment by somatic stem cells. Ageing results in the inability of these tissues to maintain homeostasis and it is believed that somatic stem-cell ageing is one underlying cause of tissue attrition with age or age-related diseases. Ageing of haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) is associated with impaired haematopoiesis in the elderly. Despite a large amount of data describing the decline of HSC function on ageing, the molecular mechanisms of this process remain largely unknown, which precludes rational approaches to attenuate stem-cell ageing. Here we report an unexpected shift from canonical to non-canonical Wnt signalling in mice due to elevated expression of Wnt5a in aged HSCs, which causes stem-cell ageing. Wnt5a treatment of young HSCs induces ageing-associated stem-cell apolarity, reduction of regenerative capacity and an ageing-like myeloid-lymphoid differentiation skewing via activation of the small Rho GTPase Cdc42. Conversely, Wnt5a haploinsufficiency attenuates HSC ageing, whereas stem-cell-intrinsic reduction of Wnt5a expression results in functionally rejuvenated aged HSCs. Our data demonstrate a critical role for stem-cell-intrinsic non-canonical Wnt5a signalling in HSC ageing."
https://openalex.org/W2093101127,"Recent genomic profiling of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) identified a high-risk subtype with an expression signature resembling that of Philadelphia chromosome-positive ALL and poor prognosis (Ph-like ALL). However, the role of inherited genetic variation in Ph-like ALL pathogenesis remains unknown. In a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of 511 ALL cases and 6,661 non-ALL controls, we identified a susceptibility locus for Ph-like ALL (GATA3, rs3824662; P = 2.17 × 10(-14), odds ratio (OR) = 3.85 for Ph-like ALL versus non-ALL; P = 1.05 × 10(-8), OR = 3.25 for Ph-like ALL versus non-Ph-like ALL), with independent validation. The rs3824662 risk allele was associated with somatic lesions underlying Ph-like ALL (CRLF2 rearrangement, JAK gene mutation and IKZF1 deletion) and with variation in GATA3 expression. Finally, genotype at the GATA3 SNP was also associated with early treatment response and risk of ALL relapse. Our results provide insights into interactions between inherited and somatic variants and their role in ALL pathogenesis and prognosis."
https://openalex.org/W2005617468,"Mouse epiblast stem cells (EpiSCs) can be derived from a wide range of developmental stages. To characterize and compare EpiSCs with different origins, we derived a series of EpiSC lines from pregastrula stage to late-bud-stage mouse embryos. We found that the transcriptomes of these cells are hierarchically distinct from those of the embryonic stem cells, induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), and epiblast/ectoderm. The EpiSCs display globally similar gene expression profiles irrespective of the original developmental stage of the source tissue. They are developmentally similar to the ectoderm of the late-gastrula-stage embryo and behave like anterior primitive streak cells when differentiated in vitro and in vivo. The EpiSC lines that we derived can also be categorized based on a correlation between gene expression signature and predisposition to differentiate into particular germ-layer derivatives. Our findings therefore highlight distinct identifying characteristics of EpiSCs and provide a foundation for further examination of EpiSC properties and potential."
https://openalex.org/W2059833435,"Cyclic di-adenosine monophosphate (c-di-AMP) is a recently discovered bacterial second messenger implicated in the control of cell wall metabolism, osmotic stress responses and sporulation. However, the mechanisms by which c-di-AMP triggers these physiological responses have remained largely unknown. Notably, a candidate riboswitch class called ydaO associates with numerous genes involved in these same processes. Although a representative ydaO motif RNA recently was reported to weakly bind ATP, we report that numerous members of this noncoding RNA class selectively respond to c-di-AMP with subnanomolar affinity. Our findings resolve the mystery regarding the primary ligand for this extremely common riboswitch class and expose a major portion of the super-regulon of genes that are controlled by the widespread bacterial second messenger c-di-AMP."
https://openalex.org/W2163919991,"In this report we describe how common brain networks within the medial frontal cortex (MFC) facilitate adaptive behavioral control in rodents and humans. We demonstrate that after errors, low-frequency oscillations below 12 Hz are modulated over the midfrontal cortex in humans and within the prelimbic and anterior cingulate regions of the MFC in rats. These oscillations were phase locked between the MFC and motor areas in both rats and humans. In rats, single neurons that encoded prior behavioral outcomes were phase coherent with low-frequency field oscillations, particularly after errors. Inactivating the medial frontal regions in rats led to impaired behavioral adjustments after errors, eliminated the differential expression of low-frequency oscillations after errors and increased low-frequency spike-field coupling within the motor cortex. Our results describe a new mechanism for behavioral adaptation through low-frequency oscillations and elucidate how medial frontal networks synchronize brain activity to guide performance."
https://openalex.org/W2046486037,"Visual-object processing culminates in inferior temporal cortex (IT). To assess the organization of IT, we measured functional magnetic resonance imaging responses in alert monkeys to achromatic images (faces, fruit, bodies and places) and colored gratings. IT contained multiple color-biased regions, which were typically ventral to face patches and yoked to them, spaced regularly at four locations predicted by known anatomy. Color and face selectivity increased for more anterior regions, indicative of a broad hierarchical arrangement. Responses to non-face shapes were found across IT, but were stronger outside color-biased regions and face patches, consistent with multiple parallel streams. IT also contained multiple coarse eccentricity maps: face patches overlapped central representations, color-biased regions spanned mid-peripheral representations and place-biased regions overlapped peripheral representations. These results show that IT comprises parallel, multi-stage processing networks subject to one organizing principle."
https://openalex.org/W2057613360,"Telomerase activation through induction of its catalytic component telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) expression is essential for malignant transformation. TERT promoter mutations namely C228T and C250T that stimulate TERT transcription and telomerase activation have recently been identified in many human malignancies. We thus determined these mutations and their biological and clinical implications in thyroid carcinomas in the present study. The TERT promoter was sequenced in 10 thyroid cancer cell lines and 144 tumors from 20 patients with anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC), 51 with papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC), 36 with follicular thyroid carcinoma (FTC), and 37 with medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC). We identified C228T or C250T mutation in 6/8 of ATC cell lines, as well as in tumor tissue from 10/20, 13/51, 8/36 and 0/37 patients with ATC, PTC, FTC and MTC, respectively. In PTC patients, these mutations were exclusively present in the group with age >45 years (P<0.0001), and highly correlated shorter telomeres (P<0.0001) and distant metastasis (P=0.028). The previous radioactivity exposure did not induce the mutation. The presence of C228T or C250T was an independent predictor associated with shorter disease-related survival (DRS) in the entire cohort (P<0.0001), as well as among patients >45 years (P=0.021). ATC patients carrying the mutation survived shorter than those without mutations, although not statistically significant (P=0.129). The TERT promoter mutation was associated with overall survival (P=0.038) and DRS (P=0.058) of FTC patients. Taken together, age- and shorter telomere-dependent TERT promoter mutations occur frequently in follicular cell-derived thyroid carcinoma (ATC, PTC and FTC) but not in parafollicular cell-originated MTC, and may serve as a marker for aggressive disease and poor outcome."

These experiments extend the reach of in vivo two-photon imaging to chronic, simultaneous monitoring of entire cortical columns. Two-photon microscopy has become a key tool for monitoring the structure, function, and plasticity of neurons, glia, and vasculature in vivo. For all its strengths, this method suffers from two important limitations: (1) high-speed imaging is often confined to a single focal plane parallel to the cortical surface, and (2) light scattering makes it difficult to image deep cortical layers. Although deep layers of cortex such as layer 6 play a major role in regulating response amplitudes in superficial layers (Olsen et al., 2012Olsen S.R. Bortone D.S. Adesnik H. Scanziani M. Gain control by layer six in cortical circuits of vision.Nature. 2012; 483: 47-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar) and in distributing information to a variety of cortical and subcortical targets (Thomson, 2010Thomson A.M. Neocortical layer 6, a review.Front Neuroanat. 2010; 4: 13PubMed Google Scholar), existing methods for two-photon imaging are more effective in imaging superficial as opposed to deeper cortical layers. Further, methods currently do not exist for cellular or subcellular imaging across multiple cortical layers simultaneously. Optical scattering degrades image quality at increasing imaging depths within brain tissue. Regenerative amplifiers (Mittmann et al., 2011Mittmann W. Wallace D.J. Czubayko U. Herb J.T. Schaefer A.T.

Blunt-ended gradient index (GRIN) lenses have been used as implantable micro-optics for deep imaging (Barretto et al., 2011Barretto R.P. Ko T.H. Jung J.C. Wang T.J. Capps G. Waters A.C. Ziv Y.

Traditional multiphoton imaging in certain thinner cortical areas in mice (e.g., mouse visual cortex; Glickfeld et al., 2013Glickfeld L.L. Andermann M.L. Bonin V. Reid R.C. Cortico-cortical projections in mouse visual cortex are functionally target specific.Nat. Neurosci. 2013; 16: 219-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar) can reach layers 4 and 5, but this solution often requires high average power and/or sparse labeling of neurons. Half-millimeter prisms have been used with one-photon excitation to measure the net fluorescence emission from layer 5 apical dendrites in superficial cortical layers in rats (Murayama et al., 2007Murayama M. Pérez-Garci E. Lüscher H.R. Larkum M.E. Fiberoptic system for recording dendritic calcium signals in layer 5 neocortical pyramidal cells in freely moving rats.J. Neurophysiol. 2007; 98: 1791-1805Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), but these fluorescence images lacked cellular or subcellular resolution. Current methods allow two-photon imaging of small volumes typically spanning 50–250 μm in depth within a cortical layer, using piezoelectric scanners (Göbel et al., 2007Göbel W. Kampa B.M.

Methods. 2011; 8: 139-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). To rapidly obtain two-photon imaging data from a larger range of depths, we have previously shown that insertion of a sharp, 1 mm glass microprism into the neocortex of an anesthetized mouse can be used for acute, single-session two-photon imaging of anatomical structures across all six cortical layers, including the soma and dendrites of cortical layer 5 pyramidal cells, in a single field-of-view (Chia and Levene, 2009aChia T.H. Levene M.J. In vivo imaging of deep cortical layers using a microprism.J. Vis.

Protoc. 2010; (Published online August 1, 2010)https://doi.org/10.1101/pdb.prot5476Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Here, we describe an improved approach that has enabled chronic anatomical and functional imaging of hundreds of individual neurons and neuronal processes simultaneously across all cortical layers. The structure and function of neurons at distances >150 μm from the prism face were not qualitatively different after prism insertion and remained stable for months after prism insertion. We also demonstrate that microprisms can be used for simultaneous, high-speed calcium imaging from neurons in layers 2 to 6 during locomotion and for imaging visual responses in long-range axon terminals in deep cortical layers. This approach complements traditional in vivo electrophysiological methods by enabling high-yield, simultaneous chronic monitoring of subcellular structure and neural activity in superficial and deep-layer cortical neurons in behaving mice. Two parallel approaches have dominated the study of neocortical circuits. One approach involves recordings in living coronal brain slices (typically ∼400 μm thick). Although many long-range axonal inputs to the cortical columns within each slice are severed, this reductionist approach has provided a wealth of insights regarding the layer-specific physiological properties of neurons and the interlaminar flow of neural impulses, using multiple intracellular and extracellular recordings (e.g., Adesnik and Scanziani, 2010Adesnik H.

Functionally independent columns of rat somatosensory barrel cortex revealed with voltage-sensitive dye imaging.J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 8435-8446PubMed Google Scholar). A second common approach involves neuronal recordings from the intact brain, where it is possible to correlate neural activity with sensory perception and with behavior. Two-photon imaging has provided a means for monitoring neural activity and structural plasticity across days and weeks in awake animals (e.g., Dombeck et al., 2007Dombeck D.A. Khabbaz A.N. Collman F.

However, many aspects of cortical processing remain out of reach because of the challenges in imaging deep-layer neurons and in simultaneous in vivo imaging across all layers. Although such laminar recordings are possible using electrophysiological approaches (Adesnik and Scanziani, 2010Adesnik H. Scanziani M.

Stryker M.P. Highly selective receptive fields in mouse visual cortex.J.

Chronic two-photon imaging through a microprism combines the optical access of ex vivo brain slice preparations with in vivo behavioral context. This procedure involves insertion of a microprism attached to a cranial window (Figure 1A and Figure S1 available online). The hypotenuse of the microprism is coated with aluminum and thus serves as a right-angled mirror or “microperiscope,” with a vertical field-of-view parallel to the prism face. In different experiments, we implanted a microprism into either mouse somatosensory barrel cortex or visual cortex. As described in detail below (see Experimental Procedures and Figures S1A–S1D), a microprism (barrel cortex: 1.5 × 1.5 mm2 imaging face; visual cortex: 1 × 1 mm2 imaging face) was glued to a coverslip. A craniotomy and durotomy were performed under sterile conditions, a small incision was made orthogonal to the cortical surface, and the microprism assembly was carefully inserted into cortex. Wide-field epifluorescence and two-photon images parallel to the cortical surface showed a vertical field-of-view across cortical layers 2–6 through the prism, revealing radial blood vessels and the expected laminar pattern of GCaMP3 expression (Figures 1B and 1C) or YFP expression (Figure 1D). The procedure for microprism insertion in the primary visual cortex (V1) (Figures 1B and 1C) involved an ∼20% vertical compression of cortex (to ∼675 μm in area V1) to decrease brain motion and prevent dural regrowth at the cortical surface, as in previous studies (Andermann et al., 2011Andermann M.L.

Imaging large-scale neural activity with cellular resolution in awake, mobile mice.Neuron. 2007; 56: 43-57Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (748) Google Scholar). We first used microprisms for chronic two-photon structural imaging of genetically labeled cortical neurons across the depth of cortex. Somata and dendrites of layer 5 neurons in barrel cortex of anesthetized Thy1-YFP-H mice were imaged immediately following and for up to 2 months after prism insertion (n = 5; Figure 1D). Large field-of-view imaging with a 4× objective immediately following prism insertion revealed labeled neurons in layers 2/3 and 5 (Figure 1D, left panel). Consistent with our earlier studies (Chia and Levene, 2009bChia T.H. Levene M.J. Microprisms for in vivo multilayer cortical imaging.J. Neurophysiol. 2009; 102: 1310-1314Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), images included dendrites of hundreds of neurons up to depths ∼900 μm below the pial surface. Imaging with a 40× objective, 29 and 68 days following prism insertion, yielded progressively clearer images, allowing visualization of fine structural details in proximal portions of layer 5 pyramidal neuron basal dendrites (Figure 1D, middle and right panels; Movie S1). The population of labeled neurons was stable over time, as demonstrated by tracking of over 40 neurons in one field-of-view across imaging sessions spaced 13 days apart (Figures S1E and S1F). We found that when the surface of the cortex around the prism was unobstructed, the fluorescence collection efficiency was improved and “shadow” effects of radial vessels located between the image plane and the prism face were reduced. This is likely due to the diffuse nature of emitted fluorescent light, which can reach the objective through a clear cranial window surrounding the prism as well as through the prism (Figures S1G and S1H). The above results indicate that neurons near the microprism face (100–300 μm away) survived prism insertion and maintained their structural integrity for months. In addition, histological evaluation with staining for hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) (Figures 1E and 1G), Nissl (Figure 1C), and DAPI (data not shown) indicated that the imaged regions were comparable to more distant brain tissue (400–500 μm away) and to neurons from nonimplanted mice (not shown). Small but significant increases in cell density were observed within the first 50 μm from the prism face (p < 0.05, n = 7 samples from 5 mice), followed by small but significant decreases at 50–100 μm and 100–150 μm away (p < 0.05) and a return to normal density beyond 150 μm from the prism (Figure 1G, all p > 0.05). Staining for astrocytes (anti-GFAP) and microglia (anti-CD11b), indicators of brain trauma, did not show evidence of chronic tissue scarring at 27 days after surgery (Figure 1F). These data are consistent with studies showing a persistent macrophage response <50 μm from chronically implanted electrodes with decreased neuronal density at 0–150 μm from the electrode (Biran et al., 2005Biran R. Martin D.C. Tresco P.A. Neuronal cell loss accompanies the brain tissue response to chronically implanted silicon microelectrode arrays.Exp. Neurol. 2005; 195: 115-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar). These data are also consistent with our previous studies using acute microprism implants, in which propidium iodide staining demonstrated that neuronal damage was limited to <150 μm from the prism face (Chia and Levene, 2009bChia T.H. Levene M.J. Microprisms for in vivo multilayer cortical imaging.J. Neurophysiol. 2009; 102: 1310-1314Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, a key question is whether the prism implant causes spreading depression, silencing, or other major changes in activity of local cortical neurons at distances >150 μm from the microprism face. We confirmed the sustained presence of generally normal spontaneous activity at distances of ∼100–200 μm from a chronically implanted prism using multi-unit recordings of endogenous and stimulus-evoked activity in cortical layer 5 using repeated penetrations with tungsten microelectrodes in ketamine/xylazine anesthetized mice (see Figure S2A; Supplemental Experimental Procedures; n = 3 animals). Neurons showed similar characteristic fluctuations between Up and Down states of spontaneous activity (e.g., Ros et al., 2009Ros H. Sachdev R.N. Yu Y. Sestan N. McCormick D.A. Neocortical networks entrain neuronal circuits in cerebellar cortex.J. Neurosci. 2009; 29: 10309-10320Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), before prism implantation, as little as 10 min after prism implantation, as well as 3 days and 120 days after implantation (Figures S2B–S2E). Multiunit responses to air-puff stimulation of facial vibrissae revealed that tactile sensory inputs to neurons near the prism face also remained largely intact, demonstrating localized and spatially specific responses with similar response latency (∼15–20 ms following air-puff onset) and dynamics between recordings prior to and immediately following implantation (Figures S2F and S2G). Together, these data suggest that the thalamic and cortico-cortical input that generates the short and long latency components of the sensory-evoked responses were generally intact in neurons >100–150 μm from the prism face. These results provided the impetus for determining whether two-photon imaging of calcium activity in neurons via a microprism could be achieved in the visual cortex of awake behaving mice. We obtained stable, chronic recordings of calcium activity across cortical layers as follows: first, a headpost was affixed to the skull and a 5 mm craniotomy was performed over mouse visual cortex. A standard cranial window was then installed (8 mm round coverslip glued above two 5 mm round coverslips to slightly compress the brain, reducing brain motion and regrowth; see Figures S1A–S1D; Andermann et al., 2011Andermann M.L.

Cortical expression of the genetically-encoded calcium indicator, GCaMP3 (Tian et al., 2009Tian L. Hires S.A. Mao T. Huber D. Chiappe M.E. Chalasani S.H. Petreanu L. Akerboom J. McKinney S.A. Schreiter E.R. et al.Imaging neural activity in worms, flies and mice with improved GCaMP calcium indicators.Nat. Methods. 2009; 6: 875-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (1458) Google Scholar), was achieved using adeno-associated virus (AAV) injection in layers 2/3, 5, and 6. Following recovery from surgery, mice were trained to tolerate several hours of head restraint (see Experimental Procedures and Andermann et al., 2011Andermann M.L. Kerlin A.M. Roumis D.K. Glickfeld L.L. Reid R.C. Functional specialization of mouse higher visual cortical areas.Neuron. 2011; 72: 1025-1039Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Subsequently, the original cranial window (Figures S1A and S1B) was removed under anesthesia and replaced by a microprism assembly (Figures S1C and S1D; Experimental Procedures) consisting of a microprism glued to three layers of coverglass. Gluing the microprism in a specific, predetermined location relative to the cranial window allowed (1) targeted insertion in posterior V1 near the site of GCaMP3 expression, (2) minimization of damage to large surface vasculature, and (3) orientation toward posterior and lateral cortex (Figure 1B) to minimize damage to thalamocortical axons from the lateral geniculate nucleus (which traverse cortex from lateral to medial, below layer 6, before ascending into their target cortical column; Antonini et al., 1999Antonini A. Fagiolini M. Stryker M.P. Anatomical correlates of functional plasticity in mouse visual cortex.J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 4388-4406PubMed Google Scholar). Before imaging GCaMP3 activity through a microprism, we evaluated how the implant of a prism influences the sensory response properties of nearby neurons. We first measured the visual response properties of neurons through a standard cranial window and then assessed the response properties of the same neurons following insertion of a microprism at a distance of 350 μm away (Figure 2A, white dashed squares, and 2B). We used an identical approach across sessions—two-photon volume imaging of visual responses of GCaMP3-expressing layer 2/3 neurons through the cranial window in an awake, head-fixed mouse that was free to run on a linear trackball (Experimental Procedures; Glickfeld et al., 2013Glickfeld L.L. Andermann M.L. Bonin V. Reid R.C. Cortico-cortical projections in mouse visual cortex are functionally target specific.Nat. Neurosci. 2013; 16: 219-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). The insertion of the microprism resulted in the accumulation of some blood at the brain surface and prism surface, which cleared up over the course of several days (Figures 2A and S2H–S2M). Major surface vessels >150 μm from the prism face remained intact, and no obvious changes in blood flow through these vessels were observed during or after prism insertion. In the volume of imaged neurons (330 μm × 350 μm, 70–163 μm below the cortical surface), surface vascular patterns and baseline GCaMP3 expression in neurons were also similar prior to and in the days following prism insertion (Figure 2B; see also Figures S2H–S2L). Perfusion was maintained over days at the prism surface by persistence of some local vasculature as well as neovascularization (Figure S2M). We evaluated visual response properties of neurons near the prism by presenting drifting gratings in one of 16 directions and one of two spatial frequencies (0.04 and 0.16 cycles/deg; Andermann et al., 2011Andermann M.L.

Cortico-cortical projections in mouse visual cortex are functionally target specific.Nat. Neurosci. 2013; 16: 219-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar) allowed accurate correction for small changes in imaging depth within and across sessions. During the session prior to prism implant, we found 44 neurons with significant visual responses (Bonferroni-corrected t tests) and measurable preferences for stimulus direction (bootstrapped confidence interval <60°, see Andermann et al., 2011Andermann M.L. Kerlin A.M. Roumis D.K. Glickfeld L.L. Reid R.C. Functional specialization of mouse higher visual cortical areas.Neuron. 2011; 72: 1025-1039Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Reimaging at 1 day following prism implant yielded 27 neurons that met the same criteria, of which 23 were confirmed (by inspection of baseline GCaMP3 volume stacks) to match neurons that were driven preimplant (see below). Example polar plots of normalized direction tuning from three of these neurons (Figure 2C) show consistent tuning properties that also persisted in subsequent imaging sessions (4 and 5 days postimplant). Direction preferences were remarkably similar for all neurons characterized 2 days prior to and 1 day after prism implant (Figure 2D, top panel). The small residual mean absolute difference in preference (8.1° ± 1.6°) was smaller than our sampling resolution (22.5°) and persisted in later imaging sessions (Figure 2F). Our index of direction selectivity, defined as the relative response strength for preferred versus antipreferred directions, showed a marginal increase following prism implant (Figure 2E, middle; paired t test, p = 0.048 1 day postimplant, p > 0.05 at 4 and 5 days postimplant; see also Figure 2G; Experimental Procedures). Peak responses decreased by 30%–35% following prism implant (Figure 2E, bottom; paired t test, p = 0.038, 0.036, 0.007 at 1, 4, and 5 days postimplant; Figure 2H). Although this decrease in response strength could, in principle, influence direction selectivity (given the sublinear properties of GCaMP3 at low spike rates; Tian et al., 2009Tian L. Hires S.A. Mao T. Huber D. Chiappe M.E. Chalasani S.H. Petreanu L. Akerboom J. McKinney S.A. Schreiter E.R. et al.Imaging neural activity in worms, flies and mice with improved GCaMP calcium indicators.Nat. Methods. 2009; 6: 875-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (1458) Google Scholar), we found no correlation between changes in peak response strength and changes in direction selectivity in any postimplant imaging session (all p values > 0.05). However, this decrease in response strength, coupled with the rectifying properties of GCaMP3, may contribute to the concomitant decrease in number of significantly driven neurons observed following prism implant (Figure 2I). Specifically, we found that of the neurons with significant responses and measurable direction tuning preimplant, 75% (33/44) were also responsive in at least one of the three imaging sessions postimplant. Our inability to recharacterize the remaining 25% of these neurons postimplant may be due to the reduction in response strength, as well as session-to-session changes unrelated to prism implant, including variations in arousal and eye position. Critically, none of the observed changes in direction preference, direction selectivity or peak response amplitude were correlated with distance from the prism face during any of the three postimplant sessions (Figure 2E, Pearson’s correlation, all p values > 0.05). These results are consistent with our anatomical results (Figure 1) indicating uniform cell health at distances >150 μm from the prism face. To test whether we"
https://openalex.org/W2018917995,"Linear ubiquitin chains are important regulators of cellular signalling pathways that control innate immunity and inflammation through nuclear factor (NF)-κB activation and protection against tumour necrosis factor-α-induced apoptosis. They are synthesized by HOIP, which belongs to the RBR (RING-between-RING) family of E3 ligases and is the catalytic component of LUBAC (linear ubiquitin chain assembly complex), a multisubunit E3 ligase. RBR family members act as RING/HECT hybrids, employing RING1 to recognize ubiquitin-loaded E2 while a conserved cysteine in RING2 subsequently forms a thioester intermediate with the transferred or 'donor' ubiquitin. Here we report the crystal structure of the catalytic core of HOIP in its apo form and in complex with ubiquitin. The carboxy-terminal portion of HOIP adopts a novel fold that, together with a zinc-finger, forms a ubiquitin-binding platform that orients the acceptor ubiquitin and positions its α-amino group for nucleophilic attack on the E3∼ubiquitin thioester. The C-terminal tail of a second ubiquitin molecule is located in close proximity to the catalytic cysteine, providing a unique snapshot of the ubiquitin transfer complex containing both donor and acceptor ubiquitin. These interactions are required for activation of the NF-κB pathway in vivo, and they explain the determinants of linear ubiquitin chain specificity by LUBAC."

Eighty percent of UMs harbor mutations in the Gαq family members GNAQ and GNA11. Understanding the effector pathways downstream of these oncoproteins is important to identify opportunities for targeted therapy. We report consistent activation of the protein kinase C (PKC) and MAPK pathways as a consequence of GNAQ or GNA11 mutation. PKC inhibition with AEB071 or AHT956 suppressed PKC and MAPK signalling and induced G1 arrest selectively in melanoma cell lines carrying GNAQ or GNA11 mutations. In contrast, treatment with two different MEK inhibitors, PD0325901 and MEK162, inhibited the proliferation of melanoma cell lines irrespective of their mutation status, indicating that in the context of GNAQ or GNA11 mutation MAPK activation can be attributed to activated PKC. AEB071 significantly slowed the growth of tumors in an allograft model of GNAQQ209L-transduced melanocytes, but did not induce tumor shrinkage. In vivo and in vitro studies showed that PKC inhibitors alone were unable to induce sustained suppression of MAP-kinase signaling. However, combinations of PKC and MEK inhibition, using either PD0325901or MEK162, led to sustained MAP-kinase pathway inhibition and showed a strong synergistic effect in halting proliferation and in inducing apoptosis in vitro. Furthermore, combining PKC and MEK inhibition was efficacious in vivo, causing marked tumor regression in a UM xenograft model. Our data identify PKC as a rational therapeutic target for melanoma patients with GNAQ or GNA11 mutations and demonstrate that combined MEK and PKC inhibition is synergistic, with superior efficacy compared to treatment with either approach alone."

We investigated where and how this combinatorial code is read out deeper in the brain. We exploited the unique morphology of neurons in the Drosophila mushroom body, which receive input on large dendritic claws. Imaging odor responses of these dendritic claws revealed that input channels with distinct odor tuning converge on individual mushroom body neurons. We determined how these inputs interact to drive the cell to spike threshold using intracellular recordings to examine mushroom body responses to optogenetically controlled input. Our results provide an elegant explanation for the characteristic selectivity of mushroom body neurons: these cells receive different types of input and require those inputs to be coactive to spike. These results establish the mushroom body as an important site of integration in the fly olfactory system."
https://openalex.org/W2171392588,"Fic proteins are ubiquitous in all of the domains of life and have critical roles in multiple cellular processes through AMPylation of (transfer of AMP to) target proteins. Doc from the doc-phd toxin-antitoxin module is a member of the Fic family and inhibits bacterial translation by an unknown mechanism. Here we show that, in contrast to having AMPylating activity, Doc is a new type of kinase that inhibits bacterial translation by phosphorylating the conserved threonine (Thr382) of the translation elongation factor EF-Tu, rendering EF-Tu unable to bind aminoacylated tRNAs. We provide evidence that EF-Tu phosphorylation diverged from AMPylation by antiparallel binding of the NTP relative to the catalytic residues of the conserved Fic catalytic core of Doc. The results bring insights into the mechanism and role of phosphorylation of EF-Tu in bacterial physiology as well as represent an example of the catalytic plasticity of enzymes and a mechanism for the evolution of new enzymatic activities."

Although numerous studies have queried the genetic basis of common disease, contradictory hypotheses have been advocated about features of genetic architecture (for example, the contribution of rare versus common variants). We developed an integrated simulation framework, calibrated to empirical data, to enable the systematic evaluation of such hypotheses. For type 2 diabetes (T2D), two simple parameters--(i) the target size for causal mutation and (ii) the coupling between selection and phenotypic effect--define a broad space of architectures. Whereas extreme models are excluded by the combination of epidemiology, linkage and genome-wide association studies, many models remain consistent, including those where rare variants explain either little (<25%) or most (>80%) of T2D heritability. Ongoing sequencing and genotyping studies will further constrain the space of possible architectures, but very large samples (for example, >250,000 unselected individuals) will be required to localize most of the heritability underlying T2D and other traits characterized by these models."
https://openalex.org/W2075876263,"Osteosarcoma is one of the most common bone tumors. However, the genetic basis for its pathogenesis remains elusive. Here, we investigated the roles of Hedgehog (Hh) signaling in osteosarcoma development. Genetically-engineered mice with ubiquitous upregulated Hh signaling specifically in mature osteoblasts develop focal bone overgrowth, which greatly resembles the early stage of osteosarcoma. However, these mice die within three months, which prohibits further analysis of tumor progression. We therefore generated a mouse model with partial upregulated Hh signaling in mature osteoblasts and crossed it into a p53 heterozygous background to potentiate tumor development. We found that these mutant mice developed malignant osteosarcoma with high penetrance. Isolated primary tumor cells were mainly osteoblastic and highly proliferative with many characteristics of human osteosarcomas. Allograft transplantation into immunocompromised mice displayed high tumorigenic potential. More importantly, both human and mouse tumor tissues express high level of yes-associated protein 1 (Yap1), a potent oncogene that is amplified in various cancers. We show that inhibition of Hh signaling reduces Yap1 expression and knockdown of Yap1 significantly inhibits tumor progression. Moreover, long non-coding RNA H19 is aberrantly expressed and induced by upregulated Hh signaling and Yap1 overexpression. Our results demonstrate that aberrant Hh signaling in mature osteoblasts is responsible for the pathogenesis of osteoblastic osteosarcoma through Yap1 and H19 overexpression."

The mechanism by which gamma is generated in the awake rodent and its functional significance are still unclear. We combined pharmacological and genetic approaches in the awake mouse olfactory bulb to show that gamma oscillations required the synaptic interplay between excitatory output neurons and inhibitory interneurons. Gamma oscillations were amplified, or abolished, after optogenetic activation or selective lesions to the bulbar output neurons. In response to a moderate increase of the excitation/inhibition ratio in output neurons, long-range gamma synchronization was selectively enhanced while the mean firing activity and the amplitude of inhibitory inputs both remained unchanged in output neurons. This excitation/inhibition imbalance also impaired odor discrimination in an olfactory learning task, suggesting that proper fast neuronal synchronization may be critical for the correct discrimination of similar sensory stimuli."

Axo-axonic cells (AACs) regulate action potential generation through GABAergic synapses on the axon initial segment. We found that CA3 AACs in anesthetized rats and AACs in freely moving rats stopped firing during sharp waves, when pyramidal cells fire most. AACs fired strongly and rhythmically around the peak of theta oscillations, when pyramidal cells fire at low probability. Distinguishing AACs from other parvalbumin-expressing interneurons by their lack of detectable SATB1 transcription factor immunoreactivity, we discovered a somatic GABAergic input originating from the medial septum that preferentially targets AACs. We recorded septo-hippocampal GABAergic cells that were activated during hippocampal sharp waves and projected to CA3. We hypothesize that inhibition of AACs, and the resulting subcellular redistribution of inhibition from the axon initial segment to other pyramidal cell domains, is a necessary condition for the emergence of sharp waves promoting memory consolidation."
https://openalex.org/W2099545905,"Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder caused by loss of the translational repressor protein FMRP. Now, Joel D. Richter and his colleagues report that knocking down the expression of the translational activator protein CPEB can restore normal levels of translation and rescue behavioral deficits in a mouse model of FXS. Fragile X syndrome (FXS), the most common cause of inherited mental retardation and autism, is caused by transcriptional silencing of FMR1, which encodes the translational repressor fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP). FMRP and cytoplasmic polyadenylation element–binding protein (CPEB), an activator of translation, are present in neuronal dendrites, are predicted to bind many of the same mRNAs and may mediate a translational homeostasis that, when imbalanced, results in FXS. Consistent with this possibility, Fmr1−/y; Cpeb1−/− double-knockout mice displayed amelioration of biochemical, morphological, electrophysiological and behavioral phenotypes associated with FXS. Acute depletion of CPEB1 in the hippocampus of adult Fmr1−/y mice rescued working memory deficits, demonstrating reversal of this FXS phenotype. Finally, we find that FMRP and CPEB1 balance translation at the level of polypeptide elongation. Our results suggest that disruption of translational homeostasis is causal for FXS and that the maintenance of this homeostasis by FMRP and CPEB1 is necessary for normal neurologic function."
https://openalex.org/W2009627966,"Aberrant expression of microRNAs (miRNAs) has been involved in the development and progression of malignancy. MicroRNA-9 (miR-9) has been confirmed to be underexpressed in many types of cancers. However, the relationship between miR-9 and the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) remains largely unknown. Here we showed that the miR-9 was underexpressed in patients with OSCC and several OSCC cell lines. Lentivirus-mediated miR-9 overexpression in highly aggressive (Tca8113 and SCC-9) tumor cells significantly inhibited proliferation of the two cell lines in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, we found that the CXC chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4) gene was a direct target of miR-9. RNA interference silencing of CXCR4 proved that miR-9 underexpression led to constitutive activation of β-catenin through activation of CXCR4 expression in OSCC cells. Finally, we also analyzed the possible relationship between miR-9 and the genes downstream of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway in OSCC development and progression.

https://openalex.org/W1985889132,"Heterozygous carriers of germ-line mutations in the BRCA2/FANCD1, PALB2/FANCN and RAD51C/FANCO DNA repair genes have an increased lifetime risk of developing breast, ovarian and other cancers; bi-allelic mutations in these genes clinically manifest as Fanconi anemia (FA). Here, we demonstrate that RAD51C is part of a novel protein complex that contains PALB2 and BRCA2. Further, the PALB2 WD40 domain can directly and independently bind RAD51C and BRCA2. To understand the role of these homologous recombination (HR) proteins in DNA repair, we functionally characterize effects of missense mutants of the PALB2 WD40 domain that have been reported in breast cancer patients. In contrast to large truncations of PALB2, which display a complete loss of interaction, the L939W, T1030I and L1143P missense mutants/variants of the PALB2 WD40 domain are associated with altered patterns of direct binding to the RAD51C, RAD51 and BRCA2 HR proteins in biochemical assays. Further, the T1030I missense mutant is unstable, whereas the L939W and L1143P proteins are stable but partially disrupt the PALB2–RAD51C–BRCA2 complex in cells. Functionally, the L939W and L1143P mutants display a decreased capacity for DNA double-strand break-induced HR and an increased cellular sensitivity to ionizing radiation. As further evidence for the functional importance of the HR complex, RAD51C mutants that are associated with cancer susceptibility and FA also display decreased complex formation with PALB2. Together, our results suggest that three different cancer susceptibility and FA proteins function in a DNA repair pathway based upon the PALB2 WD40 domain binding to RAD51C and BRCA2."

We recorded neural activity in the hippocampus of freely behaving mice that had a forebrain-specific knockout of the synaptic plasticity-mediating phosphatase calcineurin and were previously shown to exhibit behavioral and cognitive abnormalities, recapitulating the symptoms of schizophrenia. Calcineurin knockout (KO) mice exhibited a 2.5-fold increase in the abundance of sharp-wave ripple (SWR) events during awake resting periods and single units in KO were overactive during SWR events. Pairwise measures of unit activity, however, revealed that the sequential reactivation of place cells during SWR events was completely abolished in KO. Since this relationship during postexperience awake rest periods has been implicated in learning, working memory, and subsequent memory consolidation, our findings provide a mechanism underlying impaired information processing that may contribute to the cognitive impairments in schizophrenia."
https://openalex.org/W2028748220,"FOXM1 is implicated in genotoxic drug resistance but its mechanism of action remains elusive. We show here that FOXM1-depletion can sensitize breast cancer cells and mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) into entering epirubicin-induced senescence, with the loss of long-term cell proliferation ability, the accumulation of γH2AX foci, and the induction of senescence-associated β-galactosidase activity and cell morphology. Conversely, reconstitution of FOXM1 in FOXM1-deficient MEFs alleviates the accumulation of senescence-associated γH2AX foci. We also demonstrate that FOXM1 regulates NBS1 at the transcriptional level through an forkhead response element on its promoter. Like FOXM1, NBS1 is overexpressed in the epirubicin-resistant MCF-7Epi(R) cells and its expression level is low but inducible by epirubicin in MCF-7 cells. Consistently, overexpression of FOXM1 augmented and FOXM1 depletion reduced NBS1 expression and epirubicin-induced ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM)phosphorylation in breast cancer cells. Together these findings suggest that FOXM1 increases NBS1 expression and ATM phosphorylation, possibly through increasing the levels of the MRN(MRE11/RAD50/NBS1) complex. Consistent with this idea, the loss of P-ATM induction by epirubicin in the NBS1-deficient NBS1-LBI fibroblasts can be rescued by NBS1 reconstitution. Resembling FOXM1, NBS1 depletion also rendered MCF-7 and MCF-7Epi(R) cells more sensitive to epirubicin-induced cellular senescence. In agreement, the DNA repair-defective and senescence phenotypes in FOXM1-deficent cells can be effectively rescued by overexpression of NBS1. Moreover, overexpression of NBS1 and FOXM1 similarly enhanced and their depletion downregulated homologous recombination (HR) DNA repair activity. Crucially, overexpression of FOXM1 failed to augment HR activity in the background of NBS1 depletion, demonstrating that NBS1 is indispensable for the HR function of FOXM1. The physiological relevance of the regulation of NBS1 expression by FOXM1 is further underscored by the strong and significant correlation between nuclear FOXM1 and total NBS1 expression in breast cancer patient samples, further suggesting that NBS1 as a key FOXM1 target gene involved in DNA damage response, genotoxic drug resistance and DNA damage-induced senescence."

Here we identified a rare population of neuronal progenitors in mouse developing cerebellum that expresses Nestin. Although Nestin is widely considered a marker for multipotent stem cells, these Nestin-expressing progenitors (NEPs) are committed to the granule neuron lineage. Unlike conventional GNPs, which reside in the outer EGL and proliferate extensively, NEPs reside in the deep part of the EGL and are quiescent. Expression profiling revealed that NEPs are distinct from GNPs and, in particular, express markedly reduced levels of genes associated with DNA repair. Consistent with this, upon aberrant activation of Sonic hedgehog (Shh) signaling, NEPs exhibited more severe genomic instability and gave rise to tumors more efficiently than GNPs. These studies revealed a previously unidentified progenitor for cerebellar granule neurons and a cell of origin for medulloblastoma."
https://openalex.org/W2051137253,"Cancer cells acquire several traits that allow for their survival and progression, including the ability to evade the host immune response. However, the mechanisms by which cancer cells evade host immune responses remain largely elusive. Here we study the phenomena of immune evasion in malignant melanoma cells. We find that the tumor suppressor phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) is an important regulator of the host immune response against melanoma cells. Mechanistically, PTEN represses the expression of immunosuppressive cytokines by blocking the phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway. In melanoma cells lacking PTEN, signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 activates the transcription of immunosuppressive cytokines in a PI3K-dependent manner. Furthermore, conditioned media from PTEN-deficient, patient-derived short-term melanoma cultures and established melanoma cell lines blocked the production of the interleukin-12 (IL-12) in human monocyte-derived dendritic cells. Inhibition of IL-12 production was rescued by restoring PTEN or using neutralizing antibodies against the immunosuppressive cytokines. Furthermore, we report that PTEN, as an alternative mechanism to promote the host immune response against cancer cells, represses the expression of programmed cell death 1 ligand, a known repressor of the host immune response. Finally, to establish the clinical significance of our results, we analyzed malignant melanoma patient samples with or without brisk host responses. These analyses confirmed that PTEN loss is associated with a higher percentage of malignant melanoma samples with non-brisk host responses compared with samples with brisk host responses. Collectively, these results establish that PTEN functions as a melanoma tumor suppressor in part by regulating the host immune response against melanoma cells and highlight the importance of assessing PTEN status before recruiting melanoma patients for immunotherapies."

This can be seen at a simple level in our capacity to predict novel outcomes in new situations. The ability to anticipate outcomes never before received can also influence learning if those imagined outcomes are not received. The orbitofrontal cortex is a key candidate for where the process of imagining likely outcomes occurs; however, its precise role in generating these estimates and applying them to learning remain open questions. Here we address these questions by showing that single-unit activity in the orbitofrontal cortex reflects novel outcome estimates. The strength of these neural correlates predicted both behavior and learning, learning that was abolished by temporally specific inhibition of orbitofrontal neurons. These results are consistent with the proposal that the orbitofrontal cortex is critical for integrating information to imagine future outcomes."

Previously, we reported that ribosomal protein (RP) L11 binds to c-Myc and inhibits its transcriptional activity in response to ribosomal stress. Here, we show that RPL5, co-operatively with RPL11, guides the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) to c-Myc mRNA and mediates the degradation of the mRNA, consequently leading to inhibition of c-Myc activity. Knocking down of RPL5 induced c-Myc expression at both mRNA and protein levels, whereas overexpression of RPL5 suppressed c-Myc expression and activity. Immunoprecipitation revealed that RPL5 binds to 3'UTR of c-Myc mRNA and two subunits of RISC, TRBP (HIV-1 TAR RNA-binding protein) and Ago2, mediating the targeting of c-Myc mRNA by miRNAs. Interestingly, RPL5 and RPL11 co-resided on c-Myc mRNA and suppressed c-Myc expression co-operatively. These findings uncover a mechanism by which these two RPs can co-operatively suppress c-Myc expression, allowing a tightly controlled ribosome biogenesis in cells."
https://openalex.org/W2042673772,"Basal-like breast tumors are aggressive cancers associated with high proliferation and metastasis. Chemotherapy is currently the only treatment option; however, resistance often occurs resulting in recurrence and patient death. Some extremely aggressive cancers are also associated with hypoxia, inflammation and high leukocyte infiltration. Herein, we discovered that the neural-specific transcription factor, Engrailed 1 (EN1), is exclusively overexpressed in these tumors. Short hairpin RNA (shRNA)-mediated knockdown of EN1 triggered potent and selective cell death. In contrast, ectopic overexpression of EN1 in normal cells activated survival pathways and conferred resistance to chemotherapeutic agents. Exogenous expression of EN1 cDNA reprogrammed the breast epithelial cells toward a long-lived, neural-like phenotype displaying dopaminergic markers. Gene expression microarrays demonstrated that the EN1 cDNA altered transcription of a high number of inflammatory molecules, notably chemokines and chemokine receptors, which could mediate prosurvival pathways. To block EN1 function, we engineered synthetic interference peptides (iPeps) comprising the EN1-specific sequences that mediate essential protein-protein interactions necessary for EN1 function and an N-terminal cell-penetrating peptide/nuclear localization sequence. These EN1-iPeps rapidly mediated a strong apoptotic response in tumor cells overexpressing EN1, with no toxicity to normal or non EN1-expressing cells. Delivery of EN1-iPeps into basal-like cancer cells significantly decreased the fifty percent inhibitory concentrations (IC50) of chemotherapeutic drugs routinely used to treat breast cancer. Lastly, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry and immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated that EN1-iPeps captured targets involved in transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation. Importantly, the EN1-iPeps bound the glutamyl-prolyl tRNA synthetase (EPRS) target, which has been associated with the transcript-specific translational control of inflammatory proteins and activation of amino-acid stress pathways. This work unveils EN1 as an activator of intrinsic inflammatory pathways associated with prosurvival in basal-like breast cancer. We further build upon these results and describe the engineering of iPeps targeting EN1 (EN1-iPeps) as a novel and selective therapeutic strategy to combat these lethal forms of breast cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2009693910,"The role of the epithelial cell adhesion molecule EpCAM in cancer progression remains largely unclear. High expression of EpCAM in primary tumors is often associated with more aggressive phenotypes and EpCAM is the prime epithelial antigen in use to isolate circulating tumor cells (CTCs) and characterize disseminated tumor cells (DTCs). However, reduced expression of EpCAM was associated with epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and reports on a lack of EpCAM on CTCs emerged. These contradictory observations might reflect a context-dependent adaption of EpCAM expression during metastatic progression. To test this, EpCAM expression was monitored in esophageal cancer at different sites of early systemic disease. Although most of the primary esophageal tumors expressed high levels of EpCAM, the majority of DTCs in bone marrow lacked EpCAM. In vitro, downregulation of EpCAM expression at the plasma membrane was observed in migrating and invading cells, and was associated with a partial loss of the epithelial phenotype and with significantly decreased proliferation. Accordingly, induction of EMT through the action of TGFβ resulted in substantial loss of EpCAM cell surface expression on esophageal cancer cells. Knock-down or natural loss of EpCAM recapitulated these effects as it reduced proliferation while enhancing migration and invasion of cancer cells. Importantly, expression of EpCAM on DTCs was significantly associated with the occurrence of lymph node metastases and with significantly decreased overall survival of esophageal cancer patients. We validated this observation by showing that high expression of EpCAM promoted tumor outgrowth after xenotransplantation of esophageal carcinoma cells. The present data disclose a dynamic expression of EpCAM throughout tumor progression, where EpCAMhigh phenotypes correlate with proliferative stages, whereas EpCAMlow/negative phenotypes associated with migration, invasion and dissemination. Thus, differing expression levels of EpCAM must be taken into consideration for therapeutic approaches and during clinical retrieval of disseminated tumor cells."
https://openalex.org/W2160410866,"Mutation is a fundamental process in tumorigenesis. However, the degree to which the rate of somatic mutation varies across the human genome and the mechanistic basis underlying this variation remain to be fully elucidated. Here, we performed a cross-cancer comparison of 402 whole genomes comprising a diverse set of childhood and adult tumors, including both solid and hematopoietic malignancies. Surprisingly, we found that the inactive X chromosome of many female cancer genomes accumulates on average twice and up to four times as many somatic mutations per megabase, as compared to the individual autosomes. Whole-genome sequencing of clonally expanded hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) from healthy individuals and a premalignant myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) sample revealed no X chromosome hypermutation. Our data suggest that hypermutation of the inactive X chromosome is an early and frequent feature of tumorigenesis resulting from DNA replication stress in aberrantly proliferating cells."

https://openalex.org/W2091836916,"Glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78), a molecular chaperone widely elevated in human cancers, is critical for endoplasmic reticulum (ER) protein folding, stress signaling and PI3K/AKT activation. Genetic knockout models of GRP78 revealed that GRP78 maintains homeostasis of metabolic organs, including liver, pancreas and adipose tissues. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and cholangiocarcinoma (CC) are the most common liver cancers. There is a lack of effective therapeutics for HCC and CC, highlighting the need to further understand liver tumorigenic mechanisms. PTEN (phosphatase and tenson homolog deleted on chromosome 10), a tumor suppressor that antagonizes the PI3K/AKT pathway, is inactivated in a wide range of tumors, including 40–50% of human liver cancers. To elucidate the role of GRP78 in liver cancer, we created a mouse model with biallelic liver-specific deletion of Pten and Grp78 mediated by Albumin-Cre-recombinase (cPf/f78f/f). Interestingly, in contrast to PTEN, deletion of GRP78 was progressive but incomplete. At 3 months, cPf/f78f/f livers showed hepatomegaly, activation of lipogenic genes, exacerbated steatosis and liver injury, implying that GRP78 protects the liver against PTEN-null-mediated pathogenesis. Furthermore, in response to liver injury, we observed increased proliferation and expansion of bile duct and liver progenitor cells in cPf/f78f/f livers. Strikingly, bile duct cells in cPf/f78f/f livers maintained wild-type (WT) GRP78 level, whereas adjacent areas showed GRP78 reduction. Analysis of signaling pathways revealed selective JNK activation, β-catenin downregulation, along with PDGFRα upregulation, which was unique to cPf/f78f/f livers at 6 months. Development of both HCC and CC was accelerated and was evident in cPf/f78f/f livers at 8–9 months, coinciding with intense GRP78 expression in the cancer lesions, and GRP78 expression in adjacent normal areas reverted back to the WT level. In contrast, c78f/f livers showed no malignancy even at 14 months. These studies reveal that GRP78 is a novel regulator for PTEN-loss-mediated liver injury and cancer progression."
https://openalex.org/W2118166534,"Transnuclear mice are generated from B cells with a receptor specific for the haemagglutinin of influenza A virus; the authors show that influenza virus can infect and deplete haemagglutinin-specific B cells in the lung, which might confer a replicative advantage to the virus and allow it to evade an early neutralizing response. Using FluBI mice, a transgenic system containing B cells with a cellular receptor specific for the HA antigen of influenza, Hidde Ploegh and colleagues show that influenza virus can infect and deplete HA-specific B cells in the lung. The authors speculate that by targeting and killing influenza-specific B cells, the virus may gain a replicative advantage sufficient for it to evade an early neutralizing response and to become established in the lung. Influenza A virus-specific B lymphocytes and the antibodies they produce protect against infection1. However, the outcome of interactions between an influenza haemagglutinin-specific B cell via its receptor (BCR) and virus is unclear. Through somatic cell nuclear transfer we generated mice that harbour B cells with a BCR specific for the haemagglutinin of influenza A/WSN/33 virus (FluBI mice). Their B cells secrete an immunoglobulin gamma 2b that neutralizes infectious virus. Whereas B cells from FluBI and control mice bind equivalent amounts of virus through interaction of haemagglutinin with surface-disposed sialic acids, the A/WSN/33 virus infects only the haemagglutinin-specific B cells. Mere binding of virus is not sufficient for infection of B cells: this requires interactions of the BCR with haemagglutinin, causing both disruption of antibody secretion and FluBI B-cell death within 18 h. In mice infected with A/WSN/33, lung-resident FluBI B cells are infected by the virus, thus delaying the onset of protective antibody release into the lungs, whereas FluBI cells in the draining lymph node are not infected and proliferate. We propose that influenza targets and kills influenza-specific B cells in the lung, thus allowing the virus to gain purchase before the initiation of an effective adaptive response."
https://openalex.org/W1992761930,"DNA damage found in prostate cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAF) promotes tumor progression. In the absence of somatic mutations in CAF, epigenetic changes dictate how stromal coevolution is mediated in tumors. Seventy percent of prostate cancer patients lose expression of transforming growth factor-beta type II receptor (TGFBR2) in the stromal compartment (n=77, P-value=0.0001), similar to the rate of glutathione S-transferase P1 (GSTP1) silencing. Xenografting of human prostate cancer epithelia, LNCaP, resulted in the epigenetic Tgfbr2 silencing of host mouse prostatic fibroblasts. Stromal Tgfbr2 promoter hypermethylation, initiated by LNCaP cells, was found to be dependent on interleukin 6 expression, based on neutralizing antibody studies. We further found that pharmacologic and transgenic knockout of TGF-β responsiveness in prostatic fibroblasts induced Gstp1 promoter methylation. It is known that TGF-β promotes DNA stability, however, the mechanism is not well understood. Both prostatic human CAF and mouse transgenic knockout of Tgbr2 had elevated DNA methyltransferase I (DNMT1) activity and histone H3 lysine 9 trimethylation (H3K9me3) to suggest greater promoter methylation. Interestingly, the conditional knockout of Tgfbr2 in mouse prostatic fibroblasts, in modeling epigenetic silencing of Tgfbr2, had greater epigenetic gene silencing of multiple DNA damage repair and oxidative stress response genes, based on promoter methylation array analysis. Homologous gene silencing was validated by reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR in mouse and human prostatic CAF. Not surprisingly, DNA damage repair gene silencing in the prostatic stromal cells corresponded with the presence of DNA damage. Restoring the expression of the epigenetically silenced genes in wild-type fibroblasts with radiation-induced DNA damage reduced tumor progression. Tumor progression was inhibited even when epigenetic silencing was reversed in the Tgfbr2-knockout prostatic fibroblasts. Taken together, fibroblastic epigenetic changes causative of DNA damage, initiated by association with cancer epithelia, is a dominant mediator of tumor progression over TGF-β responsiveness."

https://openalex.org/W2118678999,"MMP-11 is a bad prognosis paracrine factor in invasive breast cancers. However, its mammary physiological function remains largely unknown. In the present study we have investigated MMP-11 function during postnatal mammary gland development and function using MMP-11-deficient (MMP-11-/-) mice. Histological and immunohistochemical analyses as well as whole-mount mammary gland staining show alteration of the mammary gland in the absence of MMP-11, where ductal tree, alveolar structures and milk production are reduced. Moreover, a series of transplantation experiments allowed us to demonstrate that MMP-11 exerts an essential local paracrine function that favors mammary gland branching and epithelial cell outgrowth and invasion through adjacent connective tissues. Indeed, MMP-11-/- cleared fat pads are not permissive for wild-type epithelium development, whereas MMP-11-/- epithelium transplants grow normally when implanted in wild-type cleared fat pads. In addition, using primary mammary epithelial organoids, we show in vitro that this MMP-11 pro-branching effect is not direct, suggesting that MMP-11 acts via production/release of stroma-associated soluble factor(s). Finally, the lack of MMP-11 leads to decreased periductal collagen content, suggesting that MMP-11 has a role in collagen homeostasis. Thus, local stromal MMP-11 might also regulate mammary epithelial cell behavior mechanically by promoting extracellular matrix stiffness. Collectively, the present data indicate that MMP-11 is a paracrine factor involved during postnatal mammary gland morphogenesis, and support the concept that the stroma strongly impact epithelial cell behavior. Interestingly, stromal MMP-11 has previously been reported to favor malignant epithelial cell survival and promote cancer aggressiveness. Thus, MMP-11 has a paracrine function during mammary gland development that might be harnessed to promote tumor progression, exposing a new link between development and malignancy."
https://openalex.org/W1998681243,"During embryogenesis, the Activin/Nodal pathway promotes the mesendodermal lineage and inhibits neural fate. The molecular mechanisms underlying this role of the Activin/Nodal pathway are not clear. In this study, we report a role for protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) in Activin-mediated early fate decisions during ESC differentiation and show that PTP1B acts as an effector of the Activin pathway to specify mesendodermal or neural fate. We found that the Activin/ALK4 pathway directly recruits PTP1B and stimulates its release from the endoplasmic reticulum through ALK4-mediated cleavage. Subsequently, PTP1B suppresses p-ERK1/2 signaling to inhibit neural specification and promote mesendodermal commitment. These findings suggest that a noncanonical Activin signaling pathway functions in lineage specification of mouse and human embryonic stem cells."
https://openalex.org/W2029964602,"Haeme-responsive gene (HRG)-1 encodes a 16-kDa transmembrane protein that is induced by insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and associates with the vacuolar-(H+) ATPase (V-ATPase). We previously reported that HRG-1 is essential for V-ATPase activity in endosomal acidification and receptor trafficking. Here, we show that in highly invasive and migratory cancer cell lines, HRG-1 and the V-ATPase are co-expressed at the plasma membrane, whereas in less invasive cell lines and non-transformed cells HRG-1 over-expression remains confined to intracellular compartments. Stable suppression of HRG-1 in invasive breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells decreases extracellular pH, cell growth, migration and invasion. Ectopic expression of HRG-1 in non-invasive MCF-7 cells enhances V-ATPase activity, lowers the extracellular pH and increases the pH-dependent activity of MMP2 and MMP9 matrix metalloproteinases. HRG-1 enhances trafficking of the glucose transporter-1 (GLUT-1) with a concomitant increase in glucose uptake and lactate production. HRG-1 also promotes trafficking of the insulin-like growth factor I receptor (IGF-1R), β1-integrin and IGF-1 signalling. Taken together, our findings indicate that HRG-1 expression at the plasma membrane enhances V-ATPase activity, drives glycolytic flux and facilitates cancer cell growth, migration and invasion. Thus, HRG-1 may represent a novel target for selectively disrupting V-ATPase activity and the metastatic potential of cancer cells."
https://openalex.org/W2002833372,"Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common and invasive adult brain cancer. The rapid invasion of cancer cells into the normal brain is a major cause of treatment failure, yet the mechanisms that regulate this process are poorly understood. We have identified a novel mechanism of brain cancer invasion. We show that downregulated in renal cell carcinoma (DRR), which is newly expressed in invasive gliomas, recruits AKT to focal adhesions. This DRR- induced pathological relocalization of AKT bypasses commonly altered upstream signaling events and leads to AKT activation and invasion. We also developed an oligonucleotide therapeutic that reduces DRR expression and prevents glioma invasion in an in vivo preclinical model of the disease. Our findings identify DRR as a novel GBM target and show that oligonucleotides targeting DRR is a novel therapeutic approach for the treatment of DRR-positive GBMs."
https://openalex.org/W2128264853,"Nerves and vessels often run parallel to one another, a phenomenon that reflects their functional interdependency. Previous studies have suggested that neurovascular congruency in planar tissues such as skin is established through a ""one-patterns-the-other"" model, in which either the nervous system or the vascular system precedes developmentally and then instructs the other system to form using its established architecture as a template. Here, we find that, in tissues with complex three-dimensional structures such as the mouse whisker system, neurovascular congruency does not follow the previous model but rather is established via a mechanism in which nerves and vessels are patterned independently. Given the diversity of neurovascular structures in different tissues, guidance signals emanating from a central organizer in the specific target tissue may act as an important mechanism to establish neurovascular congruency patterns that facilitate unique target tissue function."
https://openalex.org/W2031995640,"FGFR1 (fibroblast growth factor receptor 1) regulates many key cellular responses including proliferation, migration and differentiation through activation of signaling pathways. Irregularities in FGFR1 signaling have been implicated in several pathological conditions, including human cancer. In order to discover novel regulators of FGFR1 signaling, we performed yeast two-hybrid screens and identified RSK2 (p90 ribosomal S6 kinase 2) as a potential FGFR1 interaction partner. RSK2 belongs to the family of serine/threonine kinases that are activated through the Ras-MAPK signal transduction pathway. Both in vitro and in vivo experiments confirmed the interaction and we show that phosphorylated RSK2 binds to and phosphorylates serine 789 in the C-terminal tail of FGFR1. Inhibition of RSK2 activity led to prolonged tyrosine transphosphorylation of FGFR1. Furthermore, prevention of FGFR1 phosphorylation by inhibition of RSK2 activity or mutation of serine 789 to alanine reduced FGFR1 endocytosis and ubiquitination explaining mechanistically the prolonged signaling activity. We propose a novel regulatory mechanism whereby activated RSK2 directly interacts with and phosphorylates FGFR1, thereby modulating receptor signaling through regulation of endocytosis."

https://openalex.org/W1978811765,"The stimulatory NKG2D lymphocyte receptor together with its tumor-associated ligands enable the immune system to recognize and destroy cancer cells. However, with dynamic changes unfolding, cancers exploit NKG2D and its ligands for immune evasion and suppression. Recent findings have added yet another functional dimension, wherein cancer cells themselves co-opt NKG2D for their own benefit to complement the presence of its ligands for self-stimulation of parameters of tumorigenesis. Those findings are here extended to in vivo tumorigenicity testing by employing orthotopic xenotransplant breast cancer models in mice. Using human cancer lines with ectopic NKG2D expression and RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated protein depletion among other controls, we show that NKG2D self-stimulation has tumor-promoting capacity. NKG2D signals had no notable effects on cancer cell proliferation and survival but acted at the level of angiogenesis, thus promoting tumor growth, tumor cell intravasation and dissemination. NKG2D-mediated effects on tumor initiation may represent another factor in the observed overall enhancement of tumor development. Altogether, these results may have an impact on immunotherapy approaches, which currently do not account for such NKG2D effects in cancer patients and thus could be misdirected as underlying assumptions are incomplete."
