https://openalex.org/W2011467252,"We report here the identification of thyroid hormone response elements (TREs) that consist of a direct repeat, not a palindrome, of the half-sites. Unlike palindromic TREs, direct repeat TREs do not confer a retinoic acid response. The tandem TRE can be converted into a retinoic acid response element by increasing the spacing between the half-sites by 1 nucleotide, and the resulting retinoic acid response element is no longer a TRE. Decreasing the half-site spacing by 1 nucleotide converts the TRE to a vitamin D3 response element, while eliminating response to T3. These results correlate well with DNA-binding affinities of the thyroid hormone, retinoic acid, and vitamin D3 receptors. This study points to the general importance of tandem repeat hormone response elements and suggests a simple physiologic code exists in which half-site spacing plays a critical role in achieving selective hormonal response."

https://openalex.org/W2094799975,"Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) not only induces growth transformation in human B lymphocytes, but has more recently been shown to enhance B cell survival under suboptimal conditions where growth is inhibited; both effects are mediated through the coordinate action of eight virus-coded latent proteins. The effect upon cell survival is best recognized in EBV-positive Burkitt's lymphoma cell lines where activation of full virus latent gene expression protects the cells from programmed cell death (apoptosis). Here we show by DNA transfection into human B cells that protection from apoptosis is conferred through expression of a single EBV latent protein, the latent membrane protein LMP 1. Furthermore, we demonstrate that LMP 1 mediates this effect by up-regulating expression of the cellular oncogene bcl-2. The interplay between EBV infection and expression of this cellular oncogene has important implications for virus persistence and for the pathogenesis of virus-associated malignant disease."
https://openalex.org/W2057857889,"Although neurotrophic factors were originally isolated on the basis of their ability to support the survival of neurons, these molecules are now thought to influence many aspects of the development and maintenance of the nervous system. Identifying the receptors for these neurotrophic factors should aid in identifying the cells on which these factors act and in understanding their precise mechanisms of action. A ""tagged-ligand panning"" procedure was used to clone a receptor for ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF). This receptor is expressed exclusively within the nervous system and skeletal muscle. The CNTF receptor has a structure unrelated to the receptors utilized by the nerve growth factor family of neurotrophic molecules, but instead is most homologous to the receptor for a cytokine, interleukin-6. This similarity suggests that the CNTF receptor, like the interleukin-6 receptor, requires a second, signal-transducing component. In contrast to all known receptors, the CNTF receptor is anchored to cell membranes by a glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol linkage."
https://openalex.org/W2075232957,"Characterization of several thyroid hormone (T3), retinoic acid, and estrogen response elements has led to the identification of conserved DNA half-sites (core binding motifs). We present evidence that differences in both the relative orientation and spacing of these motifs within hormone response elements determine the distinct transcriptional responses of three members of the nuclear receptor superfamily. When separated by 3 bp, direct repeat, palindromic, and inverted palindromic arrangements of these motifs impart selective transcriptional responses to retinoic acid, estrogen, and T3 receptors, respectively. Varying the spacing between core motifs alters the specificity. Without spacing, a direct repeat of the core motif paradoxically configures the T3 receptor to confer transactivation in the absence of T3 and repression in its presence. Such an element occurs naturally in the mouse beta-thyrotropin promoter, physiologically under negative regulation by T3. The orientation and spacing of core binding motifs may thus function in concert as a code that accounts for the selective patterns of transcriptional responses of hormonally regulated promoters."
https://openalex.org/W2099628695,"The product of the trk proto-oncogene encodes a receptor for nerve growth factor (NGF). Here we show that NGF is a powerful mitogen that can induce resting NIH 3T3 cells to enter S phase, grow in semisolid medium, and become morphologically transformed. These mitogenic effects are absolutely dependent on expression of gp140trk receptors, but do not require the presence of the previously described low affinity NGF receptor. gp140trk also serves as a receptor for the related factor neurotrophin-3 (NT-3), but not for brain-derived neurotrophic factor. Both NGF and NT-3 induce the rapid phosphorylation of gp140trk receptors and the transient expression of c-Fos proteins. However, NT-3 appears to elicit more limited mitogenic responses than NGF. These results indicate that the product of the trk proto-oncogene is sufficient to mediate signal transduction processes induced by NGF and NT-3, at least in proliferating cells."
https://openalex.org/W2172295889,"The release of stored Ca2+ from intracellular pools triggers a variety of important neuronal processes. Physiological and pharmacological evidence has indicated the presence of caffeine-sensitive intracellular pools that are distinct from the well-characterized inositol 1,4,5,-trisphosphate (IP3)-gated pools. Here we report that the brain ryanodine receptor functions as a caffeine- and ryanodine-sensitive Ca2+ release channel that is distinct from the brain IP3 receptor. The brain ryanodine receptor has been purified 6700-fold with no change in [3H]ryanodine binding affinity and shown to be a homotetramer composed of an approximately 500 kd protein subunit, which is identified by anti-peptide antibodies against the skeletal and cardiac muscle ryanodine receptors. Our results demonstrate that the brain ryanodine receptor functions as a caffeine-sensitive Ca2+ release channel and thus is the likely gating mechanism for intracellular caffeine-sensitive Ca2+ pools in neurons."
https://openalex.org/W2051789222,A number of pharmacologically and electrophysiologically distinct voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels have been identified in mammalian neurons. Two rat brain Ca2+ channel alpha 1 subunits (rbC-I and rbC-II) have been isolated by molecular cloning and shown to be highly related (95%) to the cardiac dihydropyridine-sensitive Ca2+ channel. The rbC-II protein is distinct from rbC-I in that it contains a 3 amino acid insert in the putative cytoplasmic loop between domains II and III and a 28 amino acid substitution corresponding to the third transmembrane segment (S3) of the fourth domain. We show that rbC-I and rbC-II transcripts are generated by alternative splicing and that they are differentially expressed in the rat CNS.
https://openalex.org/W2006519779,"CD45 is a member of a family of membrane proteins that possess phosphotyrosine phosphatase activity, and is the source of much of the tyrosine phosphatase activity in lymphocytes. In view of its enzymatic activity and high copy number, it seems likely that CD45 functions in transmembrane signal transduction by lymphocyte receptors that are coupled to activation of tyrosine kinases. The B cell antigen receptor was found to transduce a Ca2+-mobilizing signal only if cells expressed CD45. Also, both membrane immunoglobulin M (mIgM) and CD45 were lost from the surface of cells treated with antibody to CD45, suggesting a physical interaction between these proteins. Finally, CD45 dephosphorylated a complex of mIg-associated proteins that appears to function in signal transduction by the antigen receptor. These data indicate that CD45 occurs as a component of a complex of proteins associated with the antigen receptor, and that CD45 may regulate signal transduction by modulating the phosphorylation state of the antigen receptor subunits."
https://openalex.org/W2154471477,"Genomic imprinting is a regulatory process that requires a cell to recognize the parental origin of alleles. To understand how these alleles are distinguished, we have assessed changes in the DNA methylation of an imprinted transgene as it switches from one inheritance pattern to another while moving through gametogenesis and embryogenesis. We find that both maternally and paternally inherited methylation patterns are erased in primordial germ cells and that distinctive patterns emerge during germ cell maturation. In the case of the maternal allele, the methylation pattern is fully acquired during oogenesis. In the case of the paternal allele, the methylation pattern found in sperm undergoes further modification during embryogenesis. Thus, the distinction between ""erased"" maternal and paternal alleles is first established during their residence in different germ cells and then may be maintained by the recognition of the distinctive patterns that each allele displays in the zygote."
https://openalex.org/W2047634049,"The maternal gene dorsal encodes a nuclear protein acting as a morphogen that determines the size and fate of regions along the dorsal-ventral axis of the Drosophila embryo. From previous genetic and biochemical studies it was hypothesized that dorsal might be responsible for the activation of the zygotic gene twist. In this report, regulatory sequences required for correct spatial and quantitative expression of twist are defined, by using phenotypic rescue and studying twist-beta-galactosidase expression. In addition, by transient cotransfection assays, we show that the dorsal protein specifically activates expression from the twist promoter. We demonstrate that dorsal is a sequence-specific DNA-binding protein that recognizes a motif similar to that recognized by the mammalian transcriptional activator NF-kappa B."

https://openalex.org/W1558047875,"Transformed human fibroblasts secrete two structurally and functionally related inhibitors of matrix metalloproteinases, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases (TIMP) 1 and 2. In assays measuring the relative inhibitory capability of TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 against autoactivated 72-kDa gelatinase, which consists of two major active peptides and several inactive fragments, TIMP-2 was more effective than TIMP-1. The isolated 42.5-kDa active fragment that formed as a result of the autoactivation of 72-kDa gelatinase showed the greatest preference for TIMP-2; at half-maximal inhibition, TIMP-2 was greater than 10-fold more effective than TIMP-1. TIMP-2 was also greater than 2-fold more effective than TIMP-1 at inhibiting 72-kDa gelatinase-TIMP-2 complexes activated with 4-aminophenylmercuric acetate, and greater than 7-fold more effective than TIMP-1 at inhibiting 92-kDa gelatinase activated with 4-aminophenylmercuric acetate. Furthermore, these active gelatinases preferentially bound 125I-TIMP-2 when incubated with equal amounts of radiolabeled TIMP-1 and TIMP-2. The ratios of 125I-TIMP-2/125I-TIMP-1 binding to 92-kDa gelatinase, autoactivated 72-kDa gelatinase, and 42.5-kDa fragment were 4.4, 10, and 33, respectively. On the other hand, interstitial collagenase was inhibited by TIMP-1 greater than 2-fold more effectively than TIMP-2 in assays measuring cleavage of loose collagen fibrils."
https://openalex.org/W2009292400,"Amino acid substitutions at a site in the center of the bacteriophage protein P22 tailspike polypeptide chain suppress temperature-sensitive folding mutations at many sites throughout the chain. Characterization of the intracellular folding and chain assembly process reveals that the suppressors act in the folding pathway, inhibiting the aggregation of an early folding intermediate into the kinetically trapped inclusion body state. The suppressors alone increase the folding efficiency of the otherwise wild-type polypeptide chain without altering the stability or activity of the native state. These amino acid substitutions identify an unexpected aspect of the protein folding grammar--sequences within the chain that carry information inhibiting unproductive off-pathway conformations. Such mutations may serve to increase the recovery of protein products of cloned genes."
https://openalex.org/W2086273425,"Several cDNAs encoding an isoform of the alpha 1 subunit of the voltage-dependent calcium channel were isolated from rat brain cDNA libraries. The complete nucleotide sequence of 6975 bp encodes a protein of 1634 amino acids, which corresponds to an Mr of 186,968. The protein exhibits 71% and 76% homology to skeletal and cardiac alpha 1 subunits, respectively. When compared with skeletal and cardiac alpha 1 isoforms, the rat brain protein is intermediate in size at the amino terminus and shorter at the carboxyl terminus. Multiple subtypes of this alpha 1 isoform cDNA were characterized. These are indicative of alternative splicing of a primary transcript and encode three variants between motif I and motif II and two within the S3 region of motif IV. Thus, multiple isoforms of this rat brain alpha 1 subunit are possible."

https://openalex.org/W1966765851,"Central to transposition of phage Mu are two reactions mediated by the MuA protein. First, MuA introduces single-stranded cuts at the ends of the Mu DNA to generate 3′ OH termini. In the subsequent strand-transfer step, the MuA-Mu DNA end complex cuts a target DNA and joins the Mu 3′ ends to the 5′ ends of the target. DNA containing chiral phosphorothioates was used to demonstrate inversion of the chirallty during the course of strand transfer. This result strongly supports a one-step transesterification mechanism in which the 3′ OH of the cleaved donor DNA is the attacking nucleophile. Furthermore, this donor 3′ OH group was essential for target DNA cleavage. In contrast, during λ integration the phosphate chirallty was retained, as expected for a two-step transesterification involving a covalent protein-DNA intermediate."
https://openalex.org/W2167144831,"Injury to the rat sciatic nerve leads to the induction of nerve growth factor (NGF) receptors on the denervated Schwann cells and their disappearance on the regenerating axons of the axotomized, normally NGF-sensitive sensory and sympathetic neurons. This disappearance in the axonal expression and retrograde transport of NGF receptors is associated with a similarly dramatic reduction in the axonal uptake and retrograde transport of NGF following axotomy and during regeneration. In view of the massive NGF synthesis occurring in the injured nerve, these results suggest that, while sensory and sympathetic neurons are the primary targets of NGF in the normal peripheral nervous system, the denervated Schwann cells may become its primary target in the aftermath of nerve injury."
https://openalex.org/W1485952666,"In 32PO4-labeled adipocytes, isoproterenol (ISO) or physiologically relevant concentrations of insulin rapidly increased phosphorylation of a particulate 135-kDa protein which has been identified as a cGMP-inhibited low Km cAMP phosphodiesterase (CGI-PDE) by several criteria, including selective immunoprecipitation with anti-CGI-PDE IgG (Degerman, E., Smith, C.J., Tornqvist, H., Vasta, V., Belfrage, P., and Manganiello, V.C. (1990) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 87, 533-537). The time courses and concentration dependences for phosphorylation of CGI-PDE by ISO and insulin correlated with CGI-PDE activation in the presence of these agents; effects of ISO were somewhat more rapid than those of insulin. Adenosine deaminase, which metabolizes the adenylate cyclase inhibitor adenosine, also rapidly induced phosphorylation and activation of CGI-PDE. Phenylisopropyladenosine (an adenosine deaminase-resistant adenosine analog) prevented or reversed both adenosine deaminase-stimulated phosphorylation and activation of CGI-PDE (IC50 approximately 0.2 nM). Incubation of adipocytes with 0.1 nM insulin in the presence of ISO rapidly produced 30-200% greater activation and phosphorylation of CGI-PDE than the expected added effects of insulin and ISO individually; both effects preceded the insulin-induced decreases in protein kinase A activity and inhibition of lipolysis. These and other results indicate that CGI-PDE can be phosphorylated at distinct sites and activated by cAMP-dependent and insulin-dependent serine kinase(s), that the activation state of CGI-PDE reflects its relative phosphorylation state, and that synergistic phosphorylation/activation of CGI-PDE may be important in the antilipolytic action of insulin."
https://openalex.org/W1566615106,"We determined the effects of superoxide anion, produced by addition of xanthine oxidase to hypoxanthine, on the intracellular pH (pHi) and intracellular free calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) and release of arachidonate in human cultured amnion cells. Superoxide anion induced a prompt increase of pHi and subsequent increase of [Ca2+]i. The evoked pHi was inhibited by pretreatment with anion channel blockers but not affected by omission of extracellular Na+ or addition of amiloride. The increase of [Ca2+]i was inhibited significantly by the absence of extracellular calcium or by the addition of a calcium channel blocker, cobalt. NH4Cl, which can generally increase pHi, also increased [Ca2+]i of amnion cells. But the increase of [Ca2+]i induced by the NH4Cl was significantly less than that induced by the amount of superoxide anion causing a similar increase in pHi. These results show that superoxide anion, crossed through anion channel in membrane, increased [Ca2+]i at least partially via increase of pHi and that the calcium mobilization was dependent on both extracellular and intracellular sources. Superoxide anion induced the release of arachidonate in a dose-dependent manner and this induction was inhibited by omission of extracellular calcium. These data suggest that the release of arachidonate was dependent on the increase of [Ca2+]i. We also determined the viability of cells in the presence of superoxide anion by flow cytometry. Superoxide anion at the levels used in these experiments did not change the percentage of viable cells. These findings suggested that superoxide anion may regulate biological functions in amnion cells via pHi, [Ca2+]i mobilization, and the release of arachidonate without damaging the cells."
https://openalex.org/W2011593319,"rab3A is a small neuronal GTP-binding protein specifically localized to synaptic vesicles. Membrane-bound rab3A behaves like an intrinsic membrane protein in vitro, but reversibly dissociates from synaptic vesicles after exocytosis in vivo. Here we demonstrate that rab3A is attached to synaptic vesicle membranes by a carboxy-terminal Cys-X-Cys sequence that is posttranslationally modified. This modification is inhibited by compactin in a mevalonate-dependent manner, suggesting that the Cys-X-Cys sequence represents a novel polyisoprenylation sequence. Isolation of a rab3 homolog from D. melanogaster reveals high evolutionary conservation of rab3A, including its carboxy-terminal Cys-X-Cys sequence. The posttranslational modifications of soluble and membrane-bound rab3A are biochemically different, but both require the carboxy-terminal Cys-X-Cys sequence and are faithfully reproduced in nonneuronal cells. Our results suggest that the carboxy-terminal Cys-X-Cys sequence of rab3A is polyisoprenylated and is used as its regulatable membrane anchor. Furthermore, the hydrophobic modification of rab3A and its correct intracellular targeting to synaptic vesicles are independent, presumably consecutive events."
https://openalex.org/W1603832006,"To understand the specificity and efficiency of protein-protein interactions promoting electron transfer, we evaluated the role of electrostatic forces in precollision orientation by the development of two new methods, computer graphics alignment of protein electrostatic fields and a systematic orientational search of intermolecular electrostatic energies for two proteins at present separation distances. We applied these methods to the plastocyanin/cytochrome c interaction, which is faster than random collision, but too slow for study by molecular dynamics techniques. Significant electrostatic potentials were concentrated on one-fourth (969 A2) of the plastocyanin surface, with the greatest negative potential centered on the Tyr-83 hydroxyl within the acidic patch, and on one-eighth (632 A2) of the cytochrome c surface, with the greatest positive potential centered near the exposed heme edge. Coherent electrostatic fields occurred only over these regions, suggesting that local, rather than global, charge complementarity controls productive recognition. The three energetically favored families of pre-collision orientations all directed the positive region surrounding the heme edge of cytochrome c toward the acidic patch of plastocyanin but differed in heme plane orientation. Analysis of electrostatic fields, electrostatic energies of precollision orientations with 12 and 6 A separation distances, and surface topographies suggested that the favored orientations should converge to productive complexes promoting a single electron-transfer pathway from the cytochrome c heme edge to Tyr-83 of plastocyanin. Direct interactions of the exposed Cu ligand in plastocyanin with the cytochrome c heme edge are not unfavorable sterically or electrostatically but should occur no faster than randomly, indicating that this is not the primary pathway for electron transfer."
https://openalex.org/W2109245267,"The lutropin (LH) receptor, which belongs to the family of G-protein coupled receptors, consists of an extracellular hydrophilic N-terminal extension of 341 amino acids and a membrane-embedded C-terminal region of 333 amino acids. This C-terminal region comprises a short N terminus, seven transmembrane domains, three cytoplasmic loops, three exoplasmic loops, and a C terminus. Recently, it was reported that the N-terminal extension of the LH receptor alone or a naturally occurring variant LH receptor similar to the N-terminal extension is capable of binding the hormone with an affinity slightly higher than that of the native receptor. This finding raises a question as to whether the N-terminal extension represents the entire hormone binding site and, if so, how is hormone binding transduced to the activation of a G-protein? In an attempt to answer this important question, we have prepared truncated receptors containing an N-terminal extension as short as 10 amino acids. Surprisingly, the truncated receptors were not only capable of binding the hormone, albeit with low affinities, but also capable of stimulating cAMP synthesis. These results suggest a possibility that the hormone, at least in part, interacts with the membrane-embedded C-terminal region and modulates it to activate adenylate cyclase. The low hormone binding affinities of the truncated receptors taken together with high affinity hormone binding to the N-terminal extension of the LH receptor indicate the existence of two or more contact points between the receptor and the hormone."
https://openalex.org/W1501517919,"Protein phosphatase 2A consists of a heterotrimeric complex composed of a catalytic subunit (C) and two associated subunits (A and B). Limited tryptic digestion of the heterotrimeric ABC form resulted in the selective degradation of the Mr = 55,000 B subunit to a 48-kDa polypeptide. The cleavage sites were determined to be within a 3-7-kDa region of the COOH terminus. Proteolysis led to dissociation of the B subunit from the enzyme complex and correlated with an increase in cardiac myosin light chain, smooth muscle myosin light chain peptide, and Leu-Arg-Arg-Ala-Ser-Leu-Gly (Kemptide) phosphatase activity. Purification of the digestion products and native gel electrophoresis indicated that dissociation of the B subunit was responsible for the increase in phosphatase activity. Kinetic analyses with several substrates revealed that dissociation of the B subunit resulted in a 2-7-fold increase in Vmax and a 1.6-5 fold increase in Km. Proteolytic dissociation of the B subunit increased the sensitivity of protein phosphatase 2A to inhibition by okadaic acid. Inhibition of the trypsinized enzyme was very similar to that observed for the purified AC form of protein phosphatase 2A. Incubation of the ABC complex with N-ethylmaleimide resulted in dissociation of the C subunit and generation of an AB complex. Selective release of the C subunit indicated that the B subunit interacts directly with the A subunit and that one or more free sulfhydryls are required to maintain the heterotrimeric structure of protein phosphatase 2A. Treatment of the enzyme with heparin resulted in an increase in specific activity that was due to the release of the B subunit from the complex. These results provide evidence that the B subunit binds directly to the A subunit to modulate enzyme activity and substrate specificity and that the COOH-terminal region of this protein is important for interaction with the AC complex. Dissociation of the B subunit by polyanionic substances related to heparin may represent a mechanism for regulating the activity of this enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1506931619,"Activation of epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptors stimulates inositol phosphate production in rat hepatocytes via a pertussis toxin-sensitive mechanism, suggesting the involvement of a G protein in the process. Since the first event after receptor-G protein interaction is exchange of GTP for GDP on the G protein, the effect of EGF was measured on the initial rates of guanosine 5‘-O-(3-[35S]thiotriphosphate) [( 35S]GTP gamma S) association and [alpha-32P]GDP dissociation in rat hepatocyte membranes. The initial rate of [35S]GTP gamma S binding was stimulated by EGF, with a maximal effect observed at 8 nM EGF. EGF also increased the initial rate of [alpha-32P]GDP dissociation. The effect of EGF on [35S]GTP gamma S association was blocked by boiling the peptide for 5 min in 5 mM dithiothreitol or by incubation of the membranes with guanosine 5‘-O-(2-thiodiphosphate) (GDP beta S). EGF-stimulated [35S]GTP gamma S binding was completely abolished in hepatocyte membranes prepared from pertussis toxin-treated rats and was inhibited in hepatocyte membranes that were treated directly with the resolved A-subunit of pertussis toxin. The amount of guanine nucleotide binding affected by occupation of the EGF receptor was approximately 6 pmol/mg of membrane protein. Occupation of angiotensin II receptors, which are known to couple to G proteins in hepatic membranes, also stimulated [35S]GTP gamma S association with and [alpha-32P]GDP dissociation from the membranes. The effect of angiotensin II on [alpha-32P]GDP dissociation was blocked by the angiotensin II receptor antagonist [Sar1,Ile8]angiotensin II, demonstrating that the guanine nucleotide binding was receptor-mediated. In A431 human epidermoid carcinoma cells, EGF stimulates inositol lipid breakdown, but the effect is not blocked by treatment of the cells with pertussis toxin. In these cells, EGF had no effect on [35S]GTP gamma S binding. Occupation of the beta-adrenergic receptor in A431 cell membranes with isoproterenol did stimulate [35S] GTP gamma S binding, and the effect could be completely blocked by l-propranolol. These results support the concept that in hepatocyte membranes, EGF receptors interact with a pertussis toxin-sensitive G protein via a mechanism similar to other hormone receptor-G protein interactions, but that in A431 human epidermoid carcinoma cells, EGF may activate phospholipase C via different mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W1570295242,"A DNA helicase, dependent on the multisubunit human single-stranded DNA binding protein (HSSB), was isolated from HeLa cells. At low levels of helicase, only the multisubunit SSBs, HSSB and yeast SSB, stimulated DNA helicase activity. At high levels of the helicase Escherichia coli SSB partially substituted for HSSB whereas other SSBs such as T4 gene 32 and adenovirus DNA binding protein did not stimulate the enzyme activity. Maximal activation of helicase activity occurred in the presence of one molecule of HSSB for every 20 nucleotides of single-stranded DNA. The addition of E. coli SSB significantly lowered the amount of HSSB required for strand displacement, suggesting that the HSSB plays at least two roles in the activation of the helicase. One is to bind single-stranded DNA, thereby preventing sequestration of the helicase, the other involves the interaction of the HSSB with the helicase. Monoclonal antibodies that interact with the 70- and 34-kDa subunits of HSSB inhibited its stimulation of the helicase activity. The DNA helicase acted catalytically in displacing duplex DNA and translocated in the 3' to 5' direction. The helicase displaced fragments from both ends of a DNA substrate that contained duplex region at both termini, but the 3' to 5' fragment was displaced 20 times faster than the 5' to 3' fragment. Since this helicase also displaced fully duplex DNA, the release of the 5' to 3' fragment may have occurred by entry of the helicase through the duplex end in a 3' to 5' direction."
https://openalex.org/W1588687595,"We recently developed a procedure for immunoisolating insulin-responsive membrane vesicles that contain the muscle/fat glucose transporter isoform, GLUT 4, from rat adipocytes. Utilizing this methodology, we are analyzing the components of these vesicles to gain an understanding of how they are regulated by insulin. In this report we identify a phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns) 4-kinase as a constituent of glucose transporter vesicles (GTVs). This kinase has the biochemical and immunological properties of a type II PtdIns 4-kinase as classified by Endeman et al. (Endemann, G., Dunn, S. N., and Cantley, L. C. (1987) Biochemistry 26, 6845-6852). A monoclonal antibody, 4C5G, which specifically inhibits the type II PtdIns 4-kinase, suppresses 80% of the GTV-PtdIns 4-kinase activity. In addition, the GTVs-PtdIns 4-kinase is maximally activated by the nonionic detergent Triton X-100, at a concentration of 0.2% and is inhibited by adenosine with a Ki of approximately 20-30 microM. We find that the GTVs do not contain any PtdIns4P 5-kinase or diacylglycerol kinase activities, whereas these activities were detected in the plasma membrane. An analysis of the subcellular distribution of PtdIns 4-kinase activity in the rat adipocyte shows that there are similar levels of activity in GTVs, plasma membranes, and the high and low density microsomal fractions, whereas the mitochondria- and nuclei-containing fractions have less than 5% of the activity seen in other fractions. Low density microsomes were subfractionated by sucrose density gradient centrifugation and PtdIns 4-kinase activity was found to correlate closely with the distribution of membrane protein, indicating that the activity is equally distributed throughout this heterogenous population of membranes. PtdIns 4-kinase activity measured in GTVs, plasma membranes, and low density microsomes, was not affected by prior treatment of the intact adipocytes with 35 nM insulin. We postulate that while the GTV-PtdIns 4-kinase is not regulated by insulin, it may play a role in defining the fusogenic properties necessary to mediate membrane movement between the GTVs, plasma membranes, and microsomes."
https://openalex.org/W1592400272,"The first 4 residues of parathyroid hormone (PTH) are highly conserved in evolution and are important for biological activity. We randomly mutated codons 1-4 of human PTH (hPTH) with degenerate oligonucleotides and, after expression in COS cells, screened the mutants for receptor binding and cAMP-stimulating activity using ROS 17/2.8 cells. This survey identified Glu4 and Val2 as important determinants of receptor binding and activation, respectively. Positions 1 and 3 were more tolerant of substitutions indicating that these sites are less vital to hormone function. Activities of synthetic hPTH(1-34) analogs further demonstrated the importance of positions 2 and 4. The binding affinity of [Ala4,Tyr34] hPTH(1-34)NH2 was 100-fold reduced relative to [Tyr34]hPTH(1-34)NH2 (Kd values = 653 +/- 270 and 4 +/- 1 nM, respectively), and [Arg2, Tyr34]hPTH(1-34)NH2 was a weak partial agonist which bound well to the ROS cell receptor (Kd = 31 +/- 10 nM). The Arg2 analog was nearly as potent as PTH(3-34) as an in vitro PTH antagonist in osteoblast derived cells. However, unlike PTH(3-34), [Arg2]PTH was a full agonist in opossum kidney (OK) cells. These observations suggest that the activation domains of the OK and ROS cell PTH receptors are different. Thus, amino-terminal PTH analogs may be useful as probes for distinguishing properties of PTH receptors."
https://openalex.org/W1480298386,"The vectorial transport of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) G protein between the ER and the cis and medial Golgi compartments has been reconstituted using semi-intact (perforated) cells. The transport of VSV-G protein between successive compartments is measured by the sequential processing of the two N-linked oligosaccharide chains present on VSV-G protein to the endoglycosidase (endo) H-resistant structures which have unique electrophoretic mobilities during sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis. The appearance of a form of VSV-G which contains only one endo H-resistant oligosaccharide chain (GH1) is kinetically and biochemically indistinguishable from the appearance of the Man5, endo D-sensitive form (GD), the latter being a processing reaction diagnostic of transport from the ER to the cis Golgi compartment. These results provide evidence that the cis Golgi compartment may contain in addition to alpha-1,2-mannosidase I, both N-acetylglueosamine transferase I and alpha-1,2-mannosidase II. VSV-G protein is subsequently processed to the form which contains two endo H-resistant oligosaccharides (GH2) after a second wave of vesicular transport. Processing of GH1 to GH2 in vitro occurs only after a lag period following the appearance of GH1; processing is sensitive to N-ethylmaleimide, guanosine-5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate), and a synthetic peptide homologous to the rab1 protein effector domain, and processing is inhibited in the absence of free Ca2+ (in the presence of EGTA), reagents which potently inhibit ER to cis Golgi transport. These results suggest that VSV-G protein proceeds through at least two rounds of vesicular transport from the ER to the medial Golgi compartment for processing to the GH2 form, providing a model system to study the regulation of the vectorial membrane fission and fusion events involved in vesicular trafficking and organelle dynamics in the early stages of the secretory pathway."
https://openalex.org/W1539429836,"The reduction potentials of the hydroxylase component of the soluble methane monooxygenase from Methylococcus capsulatus (Bath) have been investigated through potentiometric titrations. The potentials were determined by EPR spectroscopic quantitation of the mixed valent hydroxylase as a function of added sodium dithionite in the presence of appropriate mediators. The reduction of the oxidized Fe(III).Fe(III) form to the mixed valent Fe(II).Fe(III) form occurs at 48 mV versus NHE while the potential for the formation of the fully reduced Fe(II).Fe(II) species from the mixed valent form was determined to be -135 mV. Addition of the substrate propylene to the hydroxylase did not have a major effect on the reduction potentials. Introduction of the protein B and the reductase components, however, completely inhibited reduction of the hydroxylase at potentials as far negative as -200 mV. Addition of propylene to all three methane monooxygenase components greatly facilitated hydroxylase reduction. Under these conditions, the fully reduced form of the protein was obtained at potentials of greater than 150 mV. This high redox potential indicates that the oxidized form of the protein is highly reactive, as required for methane oxidation. The present results reveal aspects of how both protein B and substrate can regulate electron transfer into and out of the hydroxylase component of methane monooxygenase."
https://openalex.org/W1597658819,"We have reported previously that NB-598 competitively inhibits human squalene epoxidase and strongly inhibits cholesterol synthesis from [14C]acetate in cultured cells. Furthermore, multiple oral administration of NB-598 decreased serum cholesterol levels in dogs (Horie, M., Tsuchiya, Y., Hayashi, M., Iida, Y., Iwasawa, Y., Nagata, Y., Sawasaki, Y., Fukuzumi, H., Kitani, K., and Kamei, T. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 18075-18078). In the present study, the effects of NB-598 on 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase and low-density-lipoprotein (LDL) receptor were examined using a human hepatoma cell line Hep G2. Incubation of Hep G2 cells with NB-598 for 18 h increased HMG-CoA reductase activity in a dose-dependent manner. However, the increase in activity induced by NB-598 was lower than that induced by L-654,969 (a potent HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor), although NB-598 inhibited cholesterol synthesis more potently than L-654,969. On the other hand, HMG-CoA reductase mRNA was increased to the same extent by both inhibitors. These results demonstrate that NB-598 does not inhibit the synthesis of non-sterol derivative(s) of mevalonate, which regulate HMG-CoA reductase activity at the post-transcriptional level. NB-598 increased the binding of 125I-LDL to Hep G2 cells. LDL receptor mRNA was also induced by NB-598. In the presence of LDL or cycloheximide, NB-598 did not increase LDL receptor activity. These results demonstrate that the induction of LDL receptor activity by NB-598 is due to increases in mRNA and protein through the inhibition of cholesterol synthesis at the squalene epoxidase step. From these observations, squalene epoxidase inhibitor is expected to be highly effective in the treatment of hypercholesterolemia and also is very useful as a research tool for studying the regulation of cholesterol metabolism."

https://openalex.org/W1568213552,"Interactions between GABAA and GABAB receptors were studied using muscimol-stimulated uptake of 36Cl− by membrane vesicles from mouse cerebellum. Baclofen inhibited muscimol-stimulated 36Cl− uptake and this action was more pronounced with longer flux times (30 vs. 3 s) and after predesensitization of GABAA receptors. Baclofen also inhibited 36Cl− flux by cortical membranes but was more effective with cerebellar preparations. The action of baclofen was stereoselective, calcium-dependent, and blocked by the GABAB receptor antagonist 2-OH-saclofen. It was mimicked by GTP-γ-S but not by GDP-β-S, which suggests that baclofen may be acting via a G protein. The action of baclofen was inhibited by U73122, an inhibitor of phospholipase C. However, the potassium channel blockers tetraethylammonium or Ba2+ did not affect the action of baclofen. The results show that activation of GABAB receptors can inhibit the function of GABAA receptors and suggest that this action involves either a nondesensitizing subtype of GABAA receptor or the rate of recycling of desensitized to nondesensitized receptors. We speculate that this action of baclofen results from activation of phospholipase C and phosphorylation of a subtype of GABAA receptor by protein kinase C.—Hahner, L.; McQuilkin, S.; Harris, R. A.

https://openalex.org/W1595469067,"Abstract A serine protein kinase that phosphorylates the beta-subunit of the insulin receptor has been partially purified 5,000-fold from HeLa cell membranes. The enzyme has been purified by ion-exchange and hydroxylapatite chromatography and sucrose gradient centrifugation; it has an apparent molecular weight of 36,000-43,000 daltons. It exhibits the following properties: (a) it catalyzes the phosphorylation of the autophosphorylated insulin receptor more efficiently than the nonautophosphorylated insulin receptor, (b) it decreases insulin receptor phosphorylation of tubulin but has no effect on insulin receptor phosphorylation of microtubule-associated proteins or reduced and carboxyamidomethylated lysozyme. The enzyme also phosphorylates casein and ribosomal protein S6 and shares many properties with casein kinase I: (a) similar molecular weight, (b) utilization of ATP but not GTP as phosphoryl donor, and (c) sensitivity to inhibition by heparin. Based on several criteria the receptor serine kinase is neither protein kinase C nor the cAMP-dependent protein kinase."
https://openalex.org/W1594491781,"Human platelets were loaded with the fluorescent Na(+)-sensitive dye sodium-binding benzofuran isophtalate (SBFI), and changes in the fluorescence excited at 345 and 385 nm were analyzed after manipulations that evoked predictable changes in the cytosolic Na+ concentration ([Na+]i). Raising [Na+]i by either gramicidin D or monensin specifically increased the fluorescence excited at 345 nm and decreased that excited at 385 nm. Hence, calculation of changes in the 345/385 nm excitation ratio yields an estimate of actual changes in [Na+]i. A transient activation of Na+/H+ exchange evoked by addition of acidified platelets to buffer, pH 7.4, evoked a transient rise in [Na+]i. The re-establishment of basal [Na+]i could be prevented by ouabain, indicating an involvement of the Na+,K(+)-ATPase. Upon stimulation by 0.5 unit/ml of thrombin, [Na+]i immediately increased by 16 +/- 4 mM and this rise continued for at least 60 min after addition of agonist, albeit at a lower rate. This latter sustained rise could not be curtailed by scavenging thrombin by means of hirudin. Addition of ouabain or the phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate induced a comparable slow rise in the 345/385 excitation ratio. This may indicate a protein kinase C-mediated inhibition by thrombin of the Na+,K(+)-ATPase. In the absence of extracellular Ca2+ (Ca2+o), the [Na+]i gain was augmented to 38 +/- 9 mM. This additional uptake of Na+ was prevented by (i) Mn2+ ions, (ii) La3+ ions, (iii) the blocker of receptor-mediated Ca2+ entry (1-[beta[3-(4-methoxyphenyl)propoxyl]-4-methoxyphenethyl]-1H-im ida zole hydrochloride), and (iv) by hirudin which reversed receptor occupancy by thrombin. These findings suggest that the additional thrombin-induced [Na+]i gain in the absence of Ca2+o is due to Na+ influx through a Ca2+ entry pathway. The increase in [Na+]i in the presence of Ca2+o results from Na+ influx via Na+/H+ exchange."
https://openalex.org/W2017045939,"Although nerve growth factor (NGF) action is mediated by the slow, high affinity NGF receptor, little is known regarding its molecular composition or mode of action. We have used reversible chemical cross-linkers and affinity chromatography strategies to purify the slow NGF receptor covalently cross-linked to its NGF ligand. Subsequent uncoupling of the cross-links reveals that the receptor-ligand complex is composed of only a novel 135 kd polypeptide interacting with NGF. The previously characterized 85 kd fast, low affinity NGF receptor is not a component of the cross-linked slow receptor-ligand complex. This newly identified 135 kd polypeptide is either the entire slow NGF receptor, or it might be one component of a larger, multisubunit slow NGF holo-receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1563311338,"Bradykinin stimulates Cl- secretion by airway epithelia, but different patterns of secretion result from addition to the mucosal and submucosal surfaces. Earlier work suggested that bradykinin activates two second messenger pathways: increasing inositol phosphates (InsP) via phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate hydrolysis and increasing cAMP via arachidonic acid metabolism. In this study, we measured arachidonic acid release and InsP production in cultured canine tracheal epithelial cells. Bradykinin increased the two second messengers via independent mechanisms: (a) dose-response curves with different incubation media demonstrated that each second messenger could be generated independently of the other; (b) phorbol ester inhibited InsP production but stimulated arachidonic acid release; (c) for polarized cultures, submucosal bradykinin stimulated production of both second messengers but mucosal bradykinin stimulated only arachidonic acid release. To determine if differences in second messenger formation at the two membranes resulted from differences in hormone-receptor interactions, we compared bradykinin binding to the apical and basolateral membranes. Both the binding capacities and affinity constants (KD) were different (basolateral KD, 257 +/- 53 pM; apical KD, 39 +/- 3 pM). These data demonstrate polarized coupling of bradykinin receptors to second messenger pathways in airway epithelial cells and suggest that this polarized coupling is due to different bradykinin receptors at the two membranes."
https://openalex.org/W1504766666,"Previous studies from our laboratory (Seetharam, B., Levine, J. S., Ramasamy, M., and Alpers, D. H. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 4443-4449; Fyfe, J. C., Ramanujam, K. S., Ramaswamy, K., Patterson, D. F., and Seetharam, B. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 4489-4494) have identified and isolated a 230-kDa receptor from rat and canine kidney which binds with high affinity [57Co]cyanocobalamin (Cbl) complexed to gastric intrinsic factor (IF). Although these studies have identified a renal receptor which binds intrinsic factor-cobalamin (IFCR), it is not known whether the binding is specific for IF-Cbl and whether renal cells internalize [57Co]Cbl bound to IF and transport [57Co]Cbl across the cell. Using a variety of renal cells, our results show that IF-[57Co]Cbl binding activity is detected in proximal tubular-derived epithelial cells from opossum (OK) and porcine kidney (LLC-PK1) but not in distal tubular-derived cells from canine kidney cells (MDCK). Metabolic labeling studies with Tran 35S-label confirmed the presence of a 230-kDa IFCR in OK and LLC-PK1 cells. Cell surface labeling and binding studies demonstrated that IFCR is targeted to the apical membrane. This apical expression of IFCR in OK cells is inhibited by the microtubule-disruptive drugs, colchicine and nocodazole. Opossum kidney cells when grown on culture inserts are polarized and transport [57Co]Cbl only when bound to IF and not to other Cbl binders. Furthermore, the transport of [57Co]Cbl occurred unidirectionally from the apical to the basolateral surface. Treatment of cells with colchicine or nocodazole inhibited the surface binding of IF-[57Co]Cbl as well as the transcytosis of [57Co]Cbl by 70-75%. IFCR retained intracellualarly by incubation of cells with colchicine or nocodazole is degraded by leupeptin-sensitive proteases. Based on these results, we suggest that proximal tubular-derived epithelial cells transport [57Co]Cbl bound to IF in a saturable way via receptor-mediated endocytosis."
https://openalex.org/W1523324823,"Incubation of fetal rat hepatocytes (FRH) with transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-beta 1) resulted in growth arrest and a biphasic effect on epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor. After 2 h of exposure, EGF receptor (EGFR) was reduced by 43%. From 6 to 24 h, TGF-beta 1 exposure resulted in progressive increase in EGFR up to 74% over control. The increased binding was due to increase in high affinity EGF binding sites. FRH grown in medium containing EGF exhibited down-regulated EGFR with loss of high affinity EGF binding sites. With TGF-beta 1 exposure, high affinity EGFR was not down-regulated by EGF. Since down-regulation of EGFR involves internalization, the kinetics of EGF receptor-mediated endocytosis were examined. In TGF-beta 1-exposed FRH, EGF endocytosis was inhibited, with a reduction in the first order rate constant for the process from 0.078 to 0.043 min-1. Despite inhibition of growth, receptor down-regulation, and EGF endocytosis after TGF-beta 1 exposure, EGF-induced receptor autophosphorylation was preserved as demonstrated by [32P]phosphate-labeling of immunoprecipitated EGFR. These observations provide direct evidence that TGF-beta 1 regulates growth of fetal cells. Further, they suggest that TGF-beta 1 regulates endocytosis of EGF and possibly of other ligands."
https://openalex.org/W2116328799,"Combined optical and conductimetric measurements in aqueous solution indicate that at high pH (210) 'OH radicals react with the phenoxide form of 2,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid to form transiently phenoxy1 radicals and a small amount of hydroxycyclohexadienyl (HCHD) radicals by 150 ns. The respective yields of 88 and 12% of the total 'OH radical yield were deduced from conductance and optical changes as well as from studies using a low potential reductant. The HCHD radical possesses a pK, of 8.0 f 0.1 and the constructed spectrum of the deprotonated forms of HCHD has a X,,, at 420 nm with a minimum extinction coefficient of -7250 M cm. The red shift in X,,, and increase in extinction coefficient compared to the revised spectral properties of the protonated form of the HCHD radical (X,,, at 390 nm with extinction coefficient of -4500 M cm), together with the pK, of the HCHD radical, provide an explanation for the pH-dependent spectral changes of the so-called highly absorbing intermediate I1 species, observed in the functioning of the enzymep-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase. These results add further to the evidence in support of the proposal that intermediate I1 is composed of species which absorb similarly to the flavin 4(a)-hydroxide and a form of the substrate/product such as the HCHD radical (Anderson, R. F., Patel, K. B., and Stratford, M. R. L. (1987) J. Biol. Chern. 262,17475-17479)."
https://openalex.org/W1573313516,"In human neutrophils approximately 500 ligand-occupied beta-adrenergic receptors almost completely inhibit the superoxide production generated by at least 50,000 formyl peptide receptors, suggesting a massive amplification of the inhibitory receptor signals. We estimated two stages of amplification. In the first stage, we quantitated the ligand-dependent GTPase activities. For the formyl peptide receptor, the number of phosphates released from GTP in the presence of the saturating ligand is relatively modest, i.e. approximately 1/min/receptor, even though there are approximately 200 Gn (Gi type II) proteins/formyl peptide receptor in neutrophil membranes. In contrast, the number of GTPs cleaved in the presence of a beta-adrenergic agonist is approximately 100/min/beta-adrenergic receptor, and there are about 700 Gs/beta-adrenergic receptor in membranes. Thus the signal of the beta-adrenergic receptor is already massively amplified at the G protein, whereas the signal of the formyl peptide receptor is likely to be amplified at subsequent steps. New kinetic evidence from intact cells and biochemical evidence from permeabilized cells is provided that the second messenger of the inhibitory pathway is cAMP. To estimate the amplification of this step, we determined the cAMP concentration necessary to maximally inhibit superoxide anion production of formyl peptide-stimulated electropermeabilized cells, and we compare these concentrations to previously determined values of cAMP production in neutrophils. We conclude that each receptor may generate up to 10,000 molecules of cAMP."

https://openalex.org/W1539235351,"We investigated whether semidehydroascorbic acid was an intermediate in norepinephrine synthesis in chromaffin granules and in electron transfer across the chromaffin granule membrane. Semidehydroascorbic acid was measured in intact granules by electron spin resonance. In the presence of intragranular but not extragranular ascorbic acid, semidehydroascorbic acid was formed within granules in direct relationship to dopamine beta-monooxygenase activity. However, semidehydroascorbic acid was not generated when granules were incubated with epinephrine instead of the substrate dopamine, with dopamine beta-monooxygenase inhibitors, without oxygen, and when intragranular ascorbic acid was depleted. Experiments using the impermeant paramagnetic broadening agents [K3 [Cr(C2O4)3].3H2O] and Ni(en)3(NO3)2 provided further evidence that semidehydroascorbic acid was generated only within granules. We also investigated semidehydroascorbic acid formation in the presence of intragranular and extragranular ascorbic acid. Under these conditions, semidehydroascorbic acid was formed on both sides of the granule membrane, and formation was coupled to dopamine beta-monooxygenase activity. These data indicate that dopamine beta-monooxygenase is reduced by single electron transfer from intragranular ascorbic acid, that transmembrane electron transfer occurs by single electron transfer, and that transmembrane electron transfer is directly coupled to formation of intragranular semidehydroascorbic acid via dopamine beta-monooxygenase activity."
https://openalex.org/W1543790289,"The kinetics of cytochrome oxidase reconstituted into small phospholipid vesicles (COV) has been followed by transient optical spectroscopy under steady-state and pre-steady-state conditions, in the presence and absence of ionophores. The effect of valinomycin on the activity of reconstituted cytochrome oxidase is shown to depend on the absolute concentration of the ionophore and on the number of turnovers elapsed by the enzyme; this novel observation, which escaped previous investigations, may account for important differences in results and therefore in interpretation of the mechanism of control of the enzyme activity as between Brunori et al. (Brunori, M., Sarti, P., Colosimo, A., Antonini, G., Malatesta, F., Jones, M.G., and Wilson, M.T. (1985) EMBO J. 4, 2365-2368), Gregory and Ferguson-Miller (Gregory, L., and Ferguson-Miller, S.

Quantitative analysis of the optical spectra acquired within 10 ms over a large wavelength and time range (500-650 nm and 5 ms to 60 s) under different experimental conditions, indicates that the electrical component of the transmembrane electrochemical gradient controls the rate of the internal electron transfer from cytochrome a-CuA to cytochrome a3-CuB as well as the cytochrome c to cytochrome a electron transfer. The slow down of cytochrome oxidase activity observed in the presence of valinomycin after several (greater than 10) turnovers is attributed to alkalinization of the vesicle interior, which affects the internal electron transfer rate. These two mechanisms of control act most likely independently. A cubic scheme, which illustrates the effect of the electrochemical gradient on two states of cytochrome oxidase characterized by different redox and proton pumping activities is presented and discussed."

A comparison of 1H NMR spectra of approximately 48- and approximately 38-kDa forms of enzyme (the latter generated by tryptic deletion of approximately 10 kDa from the carboxyl terminus of the approximately 48-kDa protein) allows a correlation of observed mobile tyrosine resonances to two of the known sites of autophosphorylation (residues 1328 and 1334). Furthermore, spectra acquired during autophosphorylation of the approximately 48-kDa enzyme reveal a rapid downfield shift in the resonances of these mobile tail tyrosines consistent with their phosphorylation (as confirmed by two-dimensional tryptic phosphopeptide mapping performed under identical conditions). This experimental strategy now provides a means by which to monitor protein-tyrosine kinase autophosphorylation in solution in real time."
https://openalex.org/W1540213023,"Transcription through the late simian virus 40 (SV40) sequences have been examined in vivo and in vitro for identifying attenuation signals involved in regulating late RNA transcription. In addition to the previously identified and characterized attenuator 1 situated 93 nucleotides downstream from the major late transcription start site, a second attenuator, attenuator 2, situated 55 nucleotides downstream from it, has been identified. Attenuated transcripts mapping to this site have been observed in vivo as well as in several different in vitro transcription systems. The signal inducing transcription attenuation has been localized to a 21-base pair DNA fragment and has been found to function independently of the promoter directing transcription or its distance from the transcription start site. Furthermore, this attenuator, unlike that preceding it, does not include a region of dyad symmetry or A+T-rich sequences. Also, similar to the adenovirus 2 attenuator, but in contrast to SV40 attenuator 1, the block to elongation at the SV40 attenuator 2 appears to be modulated by the general transcription factors. It is concluded that in SV40 there are at least two types of attenuators: one that is dependent on RNA secondary structure and a second that is sequence specific and is modulated, at least in part, by the general transcription factors."
