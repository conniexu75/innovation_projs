https://openalex.org/W1534812446,"Abstract Proteolysis was assessed during perfusion of isolated livers of nonfasted rats from the turnover of free valine, measured after single pulse additions of l-valine-1-14C to the perfusate, and from the release of label from livers previously labeled with l-valine-1-14C in vivo and then perfused with 15 mm unlabeled valine to minimize reincorporation. Since valine is not synthesized in the rat and was shown not to be metabolized significantly in these experiments, it could be assumed that any net gain or loss of free valine would reflect net changes in the protein content of the system. In control experiments, free valine accumulated slowly for 15 to 30 min; the rate then spontaneously increased rather abruptly and remained elevated. Since the utilization of extracellular valine by protein synthesis did not fall off with time, the spontaneous increase in valine accumulation was ascribed to an enhancement of proteolysis. Insulin in vitro completely inhibited this spontaneous net increase and also inhibited the release of label from previously labeled livers. No specific hormonal effects were noted on the incorporation of free valine into protein or its distribution in intra- and extracellular water. The inhibitory effect of insulin, which was sustained for periods up to 180 min of perfusion, was estimated to represent 1.0% of total liver protein per hour."

https://openalex.org/W2084114964,"A highly encephalitogenic peptide whose structure resembles the sequence of amino acids surrounding the single tryptophan residue in the encephalitogenic A1 protein from bovine myelin was synthesized. This peptide is similar in the sequence to peptic peptide E and tryptic T27, derived directly from the A1 protein, and is as active on a molar basis as the A1 protein. The major disease-inducing site of the A1 protein resides in a linear sequence of nine amino acids: H-Phe-Ser-Trp-Gly-Ala-Glu-Gly-Gln-Lys-OH. This region of the A1 protein is apparently the major encephalitogenic determinant since specific modification of the tryptophan residue in the A1 protein with 2-hydroxy-5-nitrobenzyl bromide destroyed its encephalitogenic activity."
https://openalex.org/W1601356325,"By use of carboxyl-labeled α-ketoisocaproic, α-ketoisovaleric, and α-keto-β-methylvaleric acids, branched chain keto acid dehydrogenase activities were measured in rat tissues. α-Ketoisocaproic acid dehydrogenase was shown to be a mitochondrial enzyme and was found almost exclusively in liver, in contrast to leucine-α-ketoglutarate aminotransferase which was found predominantly in kidney. α-Ketoisocaproic, α-ketoisovaleric, and α-keto-β-methylvaleric acid dehydrogenase specific activities in liver increased linearly and in constant proportion to each other as the protein content of the diets was increased from 0 to 30%. Modulation of dehydrogenase activity appears to be the resultant of at least two superimposable mechanisms. One, cycloheximide-sensitive, is apparently an adaptation to dietary protein intake. The other, cycloheximide-insensitive, involves a daily activation-deactivation cycle."

The first is the reaction of ferrous peroxidase with H2O2 to form Compound II; the second is the reaction of Compound II with H2O2 to form oxyperoxidase. Both reactions follow second order kinetics, being first order with respect to each of the reactants. They proceed without detectable intermediates, and, therefore, appear to be single step 2-electron oxidations."
https://openalex.org/W1495305222,"Abstract Antibodies specific for each of the F1, F2a1, F2a2, and F2b calf thymus histone fractions were induced by immunization of rabbits with varying histone-nucleic acid complexes. At appropriate dilution, each serum reacted in quantitative complement fixation with only one homologous fraction. With very much higher serum concentrations, cross-reactions with other fractions occurred and were estimated to be approximately 5% in all but one case, in which 20% cross-reactivity was observed. Antibodies induced by F3 histone-RNA complexes were less specific than the other four types of sera. The more specific sera were effective as reagents for the identification of individual histone fractions obtained by preparative electrophoresis, column chromatography, and dissociation of histones from nucleoprotein by increasing salt concentrations. With each of the anti-F2a1, anti-F2a2, and anti-F2b sera, comparisons were made of the corresponding fractions from human, calf, chicken, frog, and lobster tissues. With any one fraction and the corresponding antiserum, little or no difference was seen in the reactivity of the protein isolated from any of these species."

https://openalex.org/W1493101497,"Abstract Deoxycytidine kinase has been purified 500-fold from calf thymus. It is concluded that the enzyme will catalyze the phosphorylation of deoxycytidine, 1-β-d-arabinofuranosyl cytosine, deoxyguanosine, and deoxyadenosine since the protein catalyzing these activities showed coincident purification. Also, this protein could not be further fractionated by isoelectric focusing, gel filtration, or sucrose density gradient centrifugation, and the nucleosides mutually inhibited each other's phosphorylation. However, the deoxycytidine-phosphorylating capacity of the preparation is considerably more stable than all other nucleoside-phosphorylating activities. The sedimentation constant, partial specific volume, and Stokes radius of the enzyme were estimated by zonal centrifugation, isodensity centrifugation, and gel filtration, respectively. These parameters were then used to calculate the molecular weight (56,000) and frictional ratio (1.36) of deoxycytidine kinase. The enzyme is very sensitive to sulfhydryl group inhibitors and is unstable in the absence of thiol; activity can be restored by incubating the enzyme with thiol compounds. Enzyme activity is fairly constant over the pH range 6 to 10, but there are marked effects of pH on nucleotide inhibition and heat stability. UDP, dTDP, dCMP, dCDP, and dCTP are all inhibitors of deoxycytidine kinase, but these inhibitions are reversed by UTP, dUTP, and dTTP."
https://openalex.org/W1605785913,"Radioactive leucine was administered to male Sprague-Dawley rats in order to measure the rate of release and decay of newly synthesized apoceruloplasmin and holoceruloplasmin in copper-deficient and normocupremic rats, respectively. Anticeruloplasmin antisera were used to isolate the protein from rat plasma. In copper-deficient rats the release of apoceruloplasmin into the circulation proceeded at the same rate as that of the copper-containing protein in normocupremic rats, although the concentration of apoceruloplasmin in copper-deficient rats was only 25% that of normal. This reduction was accounted for by the more rapid disappearance of apoceruloplasmin from the circulation. When copper was administered to copper-deficient rats no increase in the rate of release of either newly synthesized ceruloplasmin or preformed ceruloplasmin was observed, although the ceruloplasmin oxidase concentration rose over 8-fold by 8 hours. This rise was accounted for by the enhanced stability of the copper-containing protein. When 64Cu was administered to copper-deficient rats none of it was bound to circulating apoceruloplasmin, indicating that copper bound to the protein before it was released into the circulation."

This enzyme catalyzes the reaction: [see PDF for equation] From previous studies it had been inferred that this enzyme was cytoplasmic. Studies are reported here that describe the following. (a) The purity of the nuclei that were used in these investigations. Nuclei were isolated from hypertonic sucrose solutions from the retina of the hog and from liver, kidney, spleen, and brain of the rat. Nuclear purity (i.e. absence of cytoplasmic contamination) was established on the basis of enzymatic, chemical, and morphological criteria. (b) The activity of CMP-sialic acid synthetase in these nuclei. The yields of CMP-sialic acid synthetase in the nuclei recovered from the different tissues varied from 18 to 53% of the activities present in the initial homogenates. When corrected for the yield of nuclei, based on DNA content, the yields of enzyme ranged from 54 to 90%. This was accompanied by increases in specific activities of 3- to 13-fold. CMP-sialic acid synthesized by nuclei from the retina of the hog was identified by chemical, enzymatic, chromatographic, and electrophoretic procedures. (c) Some of the properties of nuclear CMP-sialic acid synthetase are described. The following apparent Km values were observed for the enzyme from nuclei of rat liver: N-acetylneuraminic acid, 0.72 mm; N-glycolylneuraminic acid, 1.4 mm; CTP, 0.48 mm; Mg2+, 6.75 mm. The optimal pH for the reaction is between 8.3 and 8.6 in Tris buffer. The effect of other metals and nucleotide triphosphates on the activity of the enzyme was measured."

https://openalex.org/W2105702284,"Abstract An ATP:d-glucose 6-phosphotransferase (EC 2.7.1.2) or glucokinase from Saccharomyces cerevisiae is described. The enzyme has been purified about 100-fold from the crude extracts of a hexokinaseless mutant derived from a haploid strain of S. cerevisiae. The Km values for glucose and ATP are 28 and 50 µm, respectively. The maximal velocity of this enzyme toward fructose is 0.4% of that of glucose. The enzyme showed a marked heterogeneity when sedimented in a sucrose density gradient, its molecular weight ranging from 144,000 to a value in excess of 200,000. Yeast glucokinase shares a number of properties with yeast hexokinase (EC 2.7.1.1) in the semiconstitutive nature of its synthesis with glucose, its broad pH optima, and inhibition with ADP and N-acetylglucosamine. Its mode of reaction with glucose and ATP, as indicated by initial velocity patterns, appears to be random."

https://openalex.org/W1551315916,"Abstract A quantitative assay for the glutamine-dependent carbamyl phosphate synthetase (Synthetase II) that depends upon the conversion of bicarbonate-14C to citrulline-14C in the presence of excess ornithine carbamyltransferase has been used to investigate the properties of the enzyme and its distribution in relation to growth rates in normal tissues and transplanted tumors of the rat that lack the hepatic type enzyme, ammonia-dependent carbamyl phosphate synthetase (Synthetase I). The rate of the enzyme reaction in the tissues studied was a small fraction of the rate of Synthetase I found in liver. Synthetase II is distinguished from Synthetase I by its utilization of glutamine as substrate, its inhibition by 6-diazo-5-oxo-l-norleucine, its lack of requirement for N-acetylglutamate, and its presence in the soluble fraction. It can also utilize NH3 as substrate but the affinity for glutamine is 600 times greater. Under optimal conditions the rate of reaction is proportional to tissue concentration and constant with time. Rapidly growing normal tissues (fetal liver, spleen, and testis) had much more Synthetase II activity than other tissues tested (lung, uterus, heart, brain, and muscle). Tumors were more active than most normal tissues and did not contain detectable Synthetase I. The Synthetase II activities in tumors were proportional to the measured rates of growth in volume of seven tumors, and significantly so when the enzyme was expressed per tumor cell."

https://openalex.org/W1581510294,"The chemistry of the reaction of 2-hydroxy-5-nitrobenzyl bromide (HNB-Br) with tryptophan ethyl ester to form monosubstitution adducts has been elucidated. The initial compounds are formed by addition at position 3 of the indole ring to form two diastereomeric indolenines. These compounds can then cyclize and rearrange in a number of ways. The absolute stereochemistries of the products have been determined. The 2-hydroxy-5-nitrobenzyl moiety has been shown to form complexes with amino acid esters and the spectral shifts of the complexes can be correlated with the hydrophobicity of the amino acid side chains. The specificity of HNB-Br for tryptophan in proteins can be explained by a combination of a hydrophobic attraction and a specific charge-transfer complex of the quinone methide form of the reagent. The hydrophobic affinity of the HNB group, the specificity of HNB-Br for tryptophan, and the number of potential reaction products of HNB-Br lead to a number of possible modes of reaction of HNB-Br with tryptophan in proteins which enhance the value of the reagent as an environmental probe."

https://openalex.org/W1544855424,"Abstract Glucosamine 6-phosphate synthesis has been examined in young adult houseflies (Musca domestica Linnaeus) at a time of active feeding and chitin production and shown to be dependent upon fructose 6-phosphate and inorganic ammonia in a reaction catalyzed by glucosamine phosphate isomerase (2-amino-2-deoxy-d-glucose 6-phosphate ketol isomerase (deaminating), EC 5.3.1.10). The 580-fold purified enzyme is specific for fructose 6-phosphate and some form of inorganic ammonia, and the product has been identified as glucosamine 6-phosphate. The molecular weight of the enzyme is about 154,000. The pH optimum of the enzyme for amination of fructose 6-phosphate is 7.1 to 7.3 in Tris-HCl and Tris-maleate buffers, between 7.7 and 8.2 in Tris-HCl containing inorganic phosphate, and 8.3 in Tris-HCl containing glucose 6-phosphate. The shift in the pH optimum in the presence of inorganic phosphate and glucose 6-phosphate accompanies the activation of the enzyme in the direction of amination by these two compounds. The pH optimum for the deamination of glucosamine 6-phosphate appears to occupy a broad region between pH 6.8 and 8.3 and is almost unaffected by either inorganic phosphate or glucose 6-phosphate, as is the rate of the reaction. The Km values for fructose 6-phosphate, ammonia, and glucosamine 6-phosphate are 36 mm, 25 mm, and 17 mm, respectively. In the presence of 5 mm glucose 6-phosphate, the Km values for fructose 6-phosphate and ammonium chloride are 3 mm and 3.3 mm, respectively, the Km for glucosamine 6-phosphate remaining unchanged. The activation constant for glucose 6-phosphate is 9.5 mm and the data indicate binding at one allosteric site only. N-Acetylglucosamine 6-phosphate activates the enzyme in both directions, the Km for glucosamine 6-phosphate being less than 0.5 mm. The equilibrium constant is in the range of 0.096 to 0.18 m for Keq = (fructose 6-phosphate) (ammonium chloride)/ (glucosamine 6-phosphate). In the presence of saturating concentrations of substrates and activators, the initial rate of amination in the presence of N-acetylglucosamine 6-phosphate is 3.8 times the rate of deamination. The initial rate of amination in the presence of glucose 6-phosphate is 3.1 times the rate of deamination in the presence of N-acetylglucosamine 6-phosphate, glucose 6-phosphate not altering the rate of deamination. Mannose 6-phosphate inhibits the amination of fructose 6-phosphate, but this is partially reversed by glucose and N-acetylglucosamine 6-phosphates. In the presence of N-acetylglucosamine 6-phosphate, glucose 6-phosphate has no effect on amination of fructose 6-phosphate. It is not clear whether glucose and N-acetylglucosamine 6-phosphates bind at the same site. Inorganic phosphate, itself an activator, partially inhibits activation by glucose 6-phosphate. Glucosamine 6-phosphate has no effect on the enzyme other than as a substrate. The absence in these animals of an enzyme which catalyzes formation of glucosamine 6-phosphate from l-glutamine and fructose 6-phosphate, the activation of the enzyme by glucose 6-phosphate only in the direction of amination of fructose 6-phosphate, and the higher initial rates of amination (3.8 times) than of deamination are evidence that the enzyme is a link in the synthetic pathway leading to chitin."

After 6 to 48 hours, triiodothyronine induced a marked reduction in leucine uptake into the proteins of the gills, intestine, kidney, and tail. No significant effect of triiodothyronine on the leucine uptake was observed in the lungs or heart but a cyclic effect was noted in the liver. The possibility that this effect in vivo was due to changes in the specific activity of the amino acid pool was excluded. It was concluded that there is a decrease in vivo in the biosynthesis of tail proteins after triiodothyronine injection during the period before regression even though certain specific enzyme proteins of the tail increase during this time. The possibility of a similar mechanism in gill, intestine, and kidney tissue is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1598200664,"Abstract The biosynthesis in vitro of tetrahymanol (II) from squalene (I) by enzyme preparations of the protozoan Tetrahymena pyriformis is described. The enzyme system involved has been obtained in a soluble, cell-free, lipid-free form, and remains active after freeze-drying. As with the live protozoa, the biosynthesis of tetrahymanol in vitro does not proceed via the intermediacy of 2,3-oxidosqualene; instead a nonoxidative, enzymatic cyclization of squalene occurs. This is an anaerobic process, and has been shown by isotopic labeling experiments with D2O and H218O to result in the acquisition of a hydrogen atom from the medium, presumably at C-3 of tetrahymanol and an oxygen atom from the medium at C-21 of tetrahymanol. The biogenetic implications of these findings are discussed."

https://openalex.org/W1606526748,"Abstract The significance of the synthesis and degradation of enzymes in the regulation of differentiation in intestinal epithelial cells has been investigated. The effects of actionmycin D, an inhibitor of RNA synthesis, and of cycloheximide, an inhibitor of protein synthesis, on the activities of adenosine deaminase, thymidine phosphorylase, and purine nucleoside phosphorylase were studied. Although all of these enzymes exhibit several-fold increases in activity as the cells migrate from the intestinal crypts to the villus tips, there are different effects of the two inhibitors on each of the enzymes. Purine nucleoside phosphorylase is relatively stable in the villus cells, but in the crypt cells is labile, and its synthesis is subject to inhibition by cycloheximide. Both adenosine deaminase and thymidine phosphorylase undergo rapid turnover, although their rate of synthesis exceeds their rate of degradation. Adenosine deaminase, unlike many differentiation-specific proteins, is synthesized from an unstable template, in contrast to thymidine phosphorylase which is synthesized from a template which is stable for more than 3 hours. Each of these enzymes is apparently under a different type of regulatory control. There are probably a variety of regulatory mechanisms operating in the differentiating intestinal epithelial cells to control the variations in the enzyme content as the cells migrate up the villi. This intestinal model may be a useful tool for investigating these mechanisms."

https://openalex.org/W1578530920,"Abstract Primer-dependent polynucleotide phosphorylase catalyzes the polymerization of ADP even in the absence of oligonucleotide primer. The reaction is very slow compared to the rate in the presence of primer, but the extent of reaction is directly proportional to time. Autocatalytic kinetics and long lags, observed earlier with cruder enzyme preparations, are absent with highly purified enzyme. The products of the reaction are very long polymer chains and do not serve as primers. No short chain intermediates are detectable and polymerization is therefore processive. Polymerization by primer-independent enzyme is also processive. In unprimed synthesis the apparent Km for ADP with dependent enzyme is several orders of magnitude higher than that found with independent enzyme. In the presence of oligonucleotide primer, dependent enzyme catalyzes the addition of mononucleotide residues to the primer. The reaction is not processive; no very long chain polymer is made and short chain intermediates are readily detected. On the other hand, primer-independent enzyme does not incorporate primer, if supplied, into long chain polymer; under these conditions polymer synthesis de novo continues in a processive fashion."

The normal histidine-containing sequences and the Gly46 analogues generated similar levels of DNase and RNase activities when mixed with an equimolar amount of native peptide containing Residues 49 or 50 to 149 (P3). The activities for all synthetic peptides, in the crude state, were about 4 to 5% of that given by the noncovalent complex (native nuclease-T) formed by an equimolar mixture of native P2 (Residues 6 to 48) with native P3. The active, semisynthetic nuclease-T species for both analogue and normal peptides were similar not only in activity but in resistance to trypsin digestion and in fluorescence emission characteristics. The semisynthetic nuclease-T species generated by both 6–47 and 6–47, Gly46 were purified, after trypsin digestion in the presence of deoxythymidine 3',5'-diphosphate and Ca++, by phosphocellulose chromatography. Both forms, after such purification, exhibited about 50 to 60% of the DNase activity of native nuclease-T.

These cytochromes exhibited an apparent positive Cotton effect in the Soret region characteristically different from other c-types cytochromes. The experimental ORD curves were resolved into individual Cotton effects plus the protein backbone rotations which were then also transformed into circular dichroic spectra. The results showed that in all three states, the anomalous rotations occurring within the Soret band were composed of at least two or three positive Cotton effects of relatively narrow band width and large rotational strength; a negative Cotton effect, evidently composed of multiple transitions, was resolved in the 300- to 330-nm region. For both the reduced and the carbon monoxide-reduced forms, the main Cotton effects were shifted towards longer wave length and in the carbon monoxide-reduced form, with the exception of R. rubrum, these Cotton effects occurred at positions close to the absorption maximum of the cytochrome and possessed very narrow band width. The net rotational strength (sum of Cotton effects I, II, and III) was significantly decreased for R. palustris cytochrome c' when reduced and for Chromatium and R. rubrum cytochrome cc' when reacted with carbon monoxide. The Shechter-Blout parameters (A'193 nm and A'225 nm) were found, in general, to be dependent upon not only the oxidation state of the cytochromes but also the ligand coordinated with the heme iron. These observations suggested that changes in the heme chromophore or chromophores also resulted in alterations of the heme environment. No evidence of heme-heme interactions was evident for the diheme cytochromes from Chromatium, R. rubrum and P. dinitrificans in contrast to a diheme cytochrome from Chromatium, cytochrome c552. Distinct differences were noted in the optical rotatory dispersion spectra and in the resolved Cotton effects between cytochrome cc' from Chromatium and R. rubrum, and between the monoheme (R. palustris) and the diheme cytochromes."
https://openalex.org/W2076407001,"IT is commonly believed that malignant tumours do not retain their capacity to metastasize when grown in alien hosts. We have shown, however, that a number of histopathologically diverse neoplasms of human origin can become serially transplantable as highly invasive and metastatic tumours in unconditioned, adult golden hamsters1–3. To explain this unusual event, I have considered the hypothesis that the malignant progression of certain neoplasms in a foreign species is related to a fusion of the genome of donor tumour cells with that of host cells; that is, the production of heterokaryons4. Those heterotransplantable tumours that still retain characteristics of their species of origin seem to be more limited in their malignant potential. Nevertheless, Greene and Harvey5 have shown that even these are capable of vascular invasion and subsequent blood passage in xenogeneic hosts, but not true metastasis. We report that a usually non-metastatic neoplasm can, in certain circumstances, exhibit metastasis in a xenogeneic host, even while retaining its original species identity."
