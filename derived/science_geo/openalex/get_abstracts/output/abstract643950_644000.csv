https://openalex.org/W2992915999,"There is extensive evidence of gender inequality in research leading to insufficient representation of women in leadership positions. Numbers revealing a gender gap in research are periodically reported by national and international institutions but data on perceptions of gender equality within the research community are scarce. In the present study, a questionnaire based on the British Athena Survey of Science, Engineering and Technology (ASSET 2016) was distributed among researchers working in Spain. Consistent with the original UK-based study, women in research perceived a greater degree of gender inequality than men. This difference was consistent from junior to senior positions, within public and private universities as well as research centres, and across all research disciplines. When responses were compared with the existing UK-based questionnaire, researchers in Spain felt that women and men are treated more equally in the workplace, yet they perceived their home departments to be less supportive regarding matters of gender equality. The results of this study provide clear evidence that men and women do not share the same perceptions of gender equality in science and that their differing perceptions are relatively consistent across two major European countries. The fact that men occupy the majority of senior positions while not perceiving the same inequality as women do, may be critical when it comes to ensuring the fair ascent of women to senior positions in an academic system. These data encourage the implementation of measures to ensure that both men and women are aware of gender biases in research."

Machine learning, and more specifically deep neural networks, have been shown to have great efficacy in this domain. These algorithms often use neurological imaging data such as MRI and PET, but a comprehensive and balanced comparison of these modalities has not been performed. In order to accurately determine the relative strength of each imaging variant, this work performs a comparison study in the context of Alzheimer's dementia classification using the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset. Furthermore, this work analyzes the benefits of using both modalities in a fusion setting and discusses how these data types may be leveraged in future AD studies using deep learning."
https://openalex.org/W2994593711,"The planktonic foraminifera genus Globigerinoides provides a prime example of a species-rich genus in which genetic and morphological divergence are uncorrelated. To shed light on the evolutionary processes that lead to the present-day diversity of Globigerinoides, we investigated the genetic, ecological and morphological divergence of its constituent species. We assembled a global collection of single-cell barcode sequences and show that the genus consists of eight distinct genetic types organized in five extant morphospecies. Based on morphological evidence, we reassign the species Globoturborotalita tenella to Globigerinoides and amend Globigerinoides ruber by formally proposing two new subspecies, G. ruber albus n.subsp. and G. ruber ruber in order to express their subspecies level distinction and to replace the informal G. ruber ""white"" and G. ruber ""pink"", respectively. The genetic types within G. ruber and Globigerinoides elongatus show a combination of endemism and coexistence, with little evidence for ecological differentiation. CT-scanning and ontogeny analysis reveal that the diagnostic differences in adult morphologies could be explained by alterations of the ontogenetic trajectories towards final (reproductive) size. This indicates that heterochrony may have caused the observed decoupling between genetic and morphological diversification within the genus. We find little evidence for environmental forcing of either the genetic or the morphological diversification, which allude to biotic interactions such as symbiosis, as the driver of speciation in Globigerinoides."
https://openalex.org/W2992722859,"Temozolomide (TMZ) is a first-line alkylating agent for glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). Clarifying the mechanisms inducing TMZ insensitivity may be helpful in improving its therapeutic effectiveness against GBM. Insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1 signaling and micro (mi)RNAs are relevant in mediating GBM progression. However, their roles in desensitizing GBM cells to TMZ are still unclear. We aimed to identify IGF-1-mediated miRNA regulatory networks that elicit TMZ insensitivity for GBM. IGF-1 treatment attenuated TMZ cytotoxicity via WNT/β-catenin signaling, but did not influence glioma cell growth. By miRNA array analyses, 93 upregulated and 148 downregulated miRNAs were identified in IGF-1-treated glioma cells. miR-513a-5p from the miR-513a-2 gene locus was upregulated by IGF-1-mediated phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling. Its elevated levels were also observed in gliomas versus normal cells, in array data of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), and the GSE61710, GSE37366, and GSE41032 datasets. In addition, lower levels of neural precursor cell-expressed developmentally downregulated 4-like (NEDD4L), an E3 ubiquitin protein ligase that inhibits WNT signaling, were found in gliomas by analyzing cells, arrays, and RNA sequencing data of TCGA glioma patients. Furthermore, a negative correlation was identified between miR-513a-5p and NEDD4L in glioma. NEDD4L was also validated as a direct target gene of miR-513a-5p, and it was reduced by IGF-1 treatment. Overexpression of NEDD4L inhibited glioma cell viability and reversed IGF-1-repressed TMZ cytotoxicity. In contrast, miR-513a-5p significantly affected NEDD4L-inhibited WNT signaling and reduced TMZ cytotoxicity. These findings demonstrate a distinct role of IGF-1 signaling through miR-513a-5p-inhibited NEDD4L networks in influencing GBM's drug sensitivity to TMZ."
https://openalex.org/W2993170101,"What relationship with nature shapes children’s desire to protect the environment? This study crosses conventional disciplinary boundaries to explore this question. I use qualitative and quantitative methods to analyse experiential, psychological, and contextual dimensions of Human-Nature Connection (HNC) before and after children participate in a project of nature conservation. The results from the interviews (N = 25) suggest that experiential aspects of saving animals enhance children’s appreciation and understanding for animals, nature, and nature conservation. However, the analysis of children’s psychological HNC (N = 158) shows no statistical difference before and after children participate in the project. Analysing the third dimension–children’s contextual HNC–provides further insights. Including children’s contextual relations with home, nature, and city, not only improves the prediction of their desire to work for nature, but also exposes a form of Human-Nature Disconnection (HND) shaped by children’s closeness to cities that negatively influence it. Overall, combining experiential, psychological, and contextual dimensions of HNC provides rich insights to advance the conceptualisation and assessment of human-nature relationships. People’s relationship with nature is better conceived and analysed as systems of relations between mind, body, culture, and environment, which progress through complex dynamics. Future assessments of HNC and HND would benefit from short-term qualitative and long-term quantitative evaluations that explicitly acknowledge their spatial and cultural contexts. This approach would offer novel and valuable insights to promote the psychological and social determinants of resilient sustainable society."
https://openalex.org/W2993243017,"Dual Energy X-Ray Absorptiometry (DXA) is currently the most widely adopted non-invasive clinical technique to assess bone mineral density and bone mineral content in human research and represents the primary tool for the diagnosis of osteoporosis. DXA measures areal bone mineral density, BMD, which does not account for the three-dimensional structure of the vertebrae and for the distribution of bone mass. The result is that longitudinal DXA can only predict about 70% of vertebral fractures. This study proposes a complementary tool, based on Finite Element (FE) models, to improve the DXA accuracy. Bone is simulated as elastic and inhomogeneous material, with stiffness distribution derived from DXA greyscale images of density. The numerical procedure simulates a compressive load on each vertebra to evaluate the local minimum principal strain values. From these values, both the local average and the maximum strains are computed over the cross sections and along the height of the analysed bone region, to provide a parameter, named Strain Index of Bone (SIB), which could be considered as a bone fragility index. The procedure is initially validated on 33 cylindrical trabecular bone samples obtained from porcine lumbar vertebrae, experimentally tested under static compressive loading. Comparing the experimental mechanical parameters with the SIB, we could find a higher correlation of the ultimate stress, σULT, with the SIB values (R2adj = 0.63) than that observed with the conventional DXA-based clinical parameters, i.e. Bone Mineral Density, BMD (R2adj = 0.34) and Trabecular Bone Score, TBS (R2adj = -0.03). The paper finally presents a few case studies of numerical simulations carried out on human lumbar vertebrae. If our results are confirmed in prospective studies, SIB could be used—together with BMD and TBS—to improve the fracture risk assessment and support the clinical decision to assume specific drugs for metabolic bone diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2993934313,"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a highly prevalent neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by impairments in social reciprocity and communication together with restricted interest and stereotyped behaviors. The Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS) is considered a 'gold standard' instrument for diagnosis of ASD and mainly depends on subjective assessments made by trained clinicians. To develop a quantitative and objective surrogate marker for ASD symptoms, we investigated speech features including F0, speech rate, speaking time, and turn-taking gaps, extracted from footage recorded during a semi-structured socially interactive situation from ADOS. We calculated not only the statistic values in a whole session of the ADOS activity but also conducted a block analysis, computing the statistical values of the prosodic features in each 8s sliding window. The block analysis identified whether participants changed volume or pitch according to the flow of the conversation. We also measured the synchrony between the participant and the ADOS administrator. Participants with high-functioning ASD showed significantly longer turn-taking gaps and a greater proportion of pause time, less variability and less synchronous changes in blockwise mean of intensity compared with those with typical development (TD) (p<0.05 corrected). In addition, the ASD group had significantly wider distribution than the TD group in the within-participant variability of blockwise mean of log F0 (p<0.05 corrected). The clinical diagnosis could be discriminated using the speech features with 89% accuracy. The features of turn-taking and pausing were significantly correlated with deficits of ASD in reciprocity (p<0.05 corrected). Additionally, regression analysis provided 1.35 of mean absolute error in the prediction of deficits in reciprocity, to which the synchrony of intensity especially contributed. The findings suggest that considering variance of speech features, interaction and synchrony with conversation partner are critical to characterize atypical features in the conversation of people with ASD."
https://openalex.org/W2994414460,"Background Sepsis is a major healthcare challenge globally. However, epidemiologic data based on population studies are scarce. Methods During a 9-month prospective, population-based study, the Swedish Sepsis-2 criteria were used to investigate the incidence of community onset severe sepsis in adults aged ≥18 years (N = 2,196; mean age, 69; range, 18–102 years). All the patients who were admitted to the hospital and started on intravenous antibiotic treatment within 48 hours were evaluated. Retrospectively the incidence of sepsis according to Sepsis-3 criteria was calculated on this cohort. Results The annual incidence of community onset severe sepsis in adults at first admission was 276/100,000 (95% CI, 254–300). The incidence increased more than 40-fold between the youngest and the oldest age group, and was higher for men than for women. The respiratory tract was the most common site of infection (41% of cases). Using the Sepsis-3 criteria, the annual incidence of sepsis was 838/100,000 (95% CI, 798–877), which is 3-fold higher than that of severe sepsis. The main reason for the discrepancy in incidences is the more generous criteria for respiratory dysfunction used in Sepsis-3. Bacteremia was seen in 13% of all the admitted patients, giving an incidence of 203/100,000/year (95%, CI 184–223), which is among the highest incidences reported. Conclusions We found a high incidence of community onset severe sepsis, albeit lower than that seen in previous Scandinavian studies. The incidence increased markedly with age of the patient. The incidence of community onset sepsis according to the Sepsis-3 definition is the highest reported to date. It is 3-fold higher than that for severe sepsis, due to more generous criteria for respiratory dysfunction. A very high incidence of bacteremia was noted, partly explained by the high frequency of blood cultures."
https://openalex.org/W2992153307,"Tuberculosis (TB) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) are the leading causes of infectious-disease-related deaths in Ethiopia, but little is known about their spatial distribution across the country. The aim of this study was to investigate the spatial patterns of TB and HIV co-infection in Ethiopia at the district level.We conducted an ecological study using TB and HIV data reported from all regions of Ethiopia through the national Health Management Information System (HMIS), between June 2015 and June 2017. Spatial clustering was assessed using Moran's I statistic and Getis-Ord statistic. Spatial binomial regression models were constructed separately for the prevalence of TB among people living with HIV and for the prevalence of HIV among TB patients, with and without spatial components using a Bayesian approach.A total of 1,830,880 HIV and 192,359 TB patients were included in the analysis. The prevalence of HIV among TB patients was 7.34%; hotspots were observed in districts located in Amhara, Afar, and Gambela regions, and cold spots were observed in Oromiya and Southern Nations, Nationalities, and People (SNNP) regions. The prevalence of TB among people living with HIV varied from 0.7% in Oromia region to 14.5% in Afar region. Hotspots of TB prevalence among people living with HIV were observed in districts located in Gambela, Afar, Somali, and Oromiya regions; whereas the cold spots were observed in districts located in Amhara and Tigray regions. The ecological-level factors associated with the prevalence of TB among people living with HIV were low wealth index (OR: 1.49; 95% CrI: 1.05, 2.05), low adult literacy rate (OR: 0.67; 95% CrI: 0.46, 0.94), and distance to an international border (OR: 0.61; 95% CrI: 0.40, 0.91). The factors associated with the prevalence of HIV among TB patients were poor health care access (OR: 0.76; 95% CrI: 0.59, 0.95), low wealth index (OR: 1.31; 95% CrI: 1.01, 1.67), and low adult literacy rate (OR: 1.37; 95% CrI: 1.03, 1.78).Our study provides evidence for geographic clustering of TB/HIV co-infection in Ethiopia. Health care access, proximity to international borders, and demographic factors such as low wealth index and adult literacy were significantly associated with the prevalence of TB/HIV co-infection."
https://openalex.org/W2992956411,"Given the increasing realization of the important functions of the gut microbial community in human health, it is important to determine whether the increased age of the host coupled with inevitable environmental changes can alter the stability of individual microbial strains of the gut microbial community. Since early studies demonstrated that pairs of twins possess the related gut microbial communities, to gain insights into the temporal stability of the reservoir of gut microbial strains in humans, we have assessed the strain relatedness of samples from two previously published data sets that were obtained from twin children and adults (36-80 years old) who have been either living together or apart for different times.We analyzed the two data sets; twin children (n = 24) and adults (n = 50) using our previously developed strain-tracking program called Window-based Single Nucleotide Variant (SNV) Similarity (WSS) that can distinguish a related strain pair from a non-related strain pair based on the overall genome-wide SNV similarity. To independently substantiate the identification of distinct microbial genomic variants (herein strains) observed from WSS analysis, we used analysis by StrainPhlAn.Analysis of the twin children data set revealed a significantly (P-value <0.05) higher number of the shared strain pairs with a predominance of Bacteroides vulgatus between individual sets of twin pairs than the twin adult data set. Additional analysis on the adult twins showed that twins who have been living apart less than 10 years shared significantly more related strain pairs than twins living apart between 10 to 60 years. Eighty-year-old twins who had been living together for 79 years then separated for 1 year showed the highest number of related strain pairs consisting of B. vulgatus, Eubacterium eligens, and Bifidobacterium adolescentis. The next highest number of related strain pairs was found in 56-year-old twins who had been living together for 51 years then separated for 5 years (B. vulgatus and Coprococcus eutactus as related strains), 73-year-old twins living together for 66 years and then separated for 7 years (Bacteroides uniformis and Clostrium sp. L2-50 as related strains) and 36-year-old twins separated for 19 years (shared strains of Alistipes shahii and E. eligens). Finally, a sporadic appearance of a single shared strain that did not show a correlation with time of separation was observed in three twin sets that had separation times between 22 to 54 years.We conclude from our strain-tracking analysis of twins that certain gut microbial strains can be shared between individuals in some cases for decades. Changes in the host environmental conditions over time can impact the stability landscape of the gut microbial community resulting in the appearance of new strains that could potentially impact microbe interactions that are essential for function in human health."
https://openalex.org/W2991854573,"Background Personality traits have been associated with a series of dysfunctional behaviors, ranging from violence to drug abuse and other risky behaviors. However, few studies have investigated motorcycle riders’ personality traits, and no research using the psychobiological model of personality was found. Thus, we investigated the association between temperament and character traits and the occurrence of Motorcycle Accidents (MAs). Methods This cross-sectional study was conducted with a randomly selected of 153 Brazilian motorcycle riders (116 male and 37 female) with a mean age of 31.8randomly selected from the driver’s license register, between 2015 and 2018. A sociodemographic questionnaire and the Temperament and Character Inventory (TCI) were used. Results Of the 153 participants, 146 (95.4%) reported having been involved in previous accidents, with the main causes as follows: “other drivers’ careless behavior” (34.9%); “personal disrespect of traffic rules” (18.5%) and “personal careless behavior” (20.6%). Motorcyclists exhibited higher scores for the temperament factors of novelty seeking and persistence and lower scores for harm avoidance and reward dependence in comparison to the Brazilian population). Considering the reason for motorcycle use, the group of riders that used their motorcycles for work exhibited more temperament factors associated with risk behaviors than those who did not. It was observed that 68.9% of them had low Harm Avoidance (HA) factor scores, whereas 72.1% had high Novelty Seeking (NS) factor scores. Discussion The present study highlighted the influences of different personality traits on behaviors, decision-making and risk attitudes that can be potentially harmful to an individual and others. The results provided evidence that a lack of knowledge and experience in riding a motorcycle or any other vehicle, combined with personality traits, contribute to the adoption of risky behaviors that may act as triggers for most causes of Motorcycle Accidents."
https://openalex.org/W2993402860,"Amiselimod (MT-1303) is a novel sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor-1 (S1P1 receptor) modulator with a more favorable cardiac safety profile than other S1P1 receptor modulators. MT-1303 phosphate (MT-1303-P), an active metabolite of MT-1303, exhibits S1P1 receptor agonism at a lower EC50 value than other S1P1 receptor modulators currently being developed. We aimed to evaluate the efficacy of MT-1303 and its mode of action in chronic colitis using an inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) model. Oral administration of MT-1303 (0.3 mg/kg) once daily for 3 days to mice almost completely abolished S1P1 receptor expression on CD4+ T cells from mesenteric lymph nodes, which corresponded to a marked decrease in CD4+ T cell count in peripheral blood, indicating that MT-1303-P acts as a functional antagonist of the S1P1 receptor. The potential benefit of MT-1303 for IBD was assessed using immunodeficient SCID mice with chronic colitis induced by adoptive transfer of CD4+CD45RBhigh T cells from BALB/c mice. An oral dose of 0.1 and 0.3 mg/kg MT-1303 administered daily one week after the cell transfer inhibited the development of chronic colitis with an efficacy comparable to that of an anti-mTNF-α mAb (250 μg/mouse). In addition, MT-1303 administration significantly reduced the number of infiltrating Th1 and Th17 cells into the lamina propria of the colon in colitis mice. Our results suggest that MT-1303 acts as a functional antagonist of the S1P1 receptor on lymphocytes, regulates lymphocyte trafficking, and inhibits infiltration of colitogenic Th1 and Th17 cells into the colon to inhibit the development of chronic colitis."
https://openalex.org/W2993068218,"Coronary heart disease (CHD) is one of the leading causes of death worldwide; if suffering from CHD and being in its end-stage, the most advanced treatments are required, such as heart surgery and heart transplant. Moreover, it is not easy to diagnose CHD at the earlier stage; hospitals diagnose it based on various types of medical tests. Thus, by predicting high-risk people who are to suffer from CHD, it is significant to reduce the risks of developing CHD. In recent years, some research works have been done using data mining to predict the risk of developing diseases based on medical tests. In this study, we have proposed a reconstruction error (RE) based deep neural networks (DNNs); this approach uses a deep autoencoder (AE) model for estimating RE. Initially, a training dataset is divided into two groups by their RE divergence on the deep AE model that learned from the whole training dataset. Next, two DNN classifiers are trained on each group of datasets separately by combining a RE based new feature with other risk factors to predict the risk of developing CHD. For creating the new feature, we use deep AE model that trained on the only high-risk dataset. We have performed an experiment to prove how the components of our proposed method work together more efficiently. As a result of our experiment, the performance measurements include accuracy, precision, recall, F-measure, and AUC score reached 86.3371%, 91.3716%, 82.9024%, 86.9148%, and 86.6568%, respectively. These results show that the proposed AE-DNNs outperformed regular machine learning-based classifiers for CHD risk prediction."
https://openalex.org/W2992025463,"Quantifying the spatial pattern of landscapes has become a common task of many studies in landscape ecology. Most of the existing software to compute landscape metrics is not well suited to be used in interactive environments such as Jupyter notebooks nor to be included as part of automated computational workflows. This article presents PyLandStats, an open-source Pythonic library to compute landscape metrics within the scientific Python stack. The PyLandStats package provides a set of methods to quantify landscape patterns, such as the analysis of the spatiotemporal patterns of land use/land cover change or zonal analysis. The implementation is based on the prevailing Python libraries for geospatial data analysis in a way that they can be forthwith integrated into complex computational workflows. Notably, the provided methods offer a large variety of options so that users can employ PyLandStats in the way that best supports their needs. The source code is publicly available, and is organized in a modular object-oriented structure that enhances its maintainability and extensibility."
https://openalex.org/W2993570577,"Animal movement networks are essential in understanding and containing the spread of infectious diseases in farming industries. Due to its confidential nature, movement data for the US swine farming population is not readily available. Hence, we propose a method to generate such networks from limited data available in the public domain. As a potentially devastating candidate, we simulate the spread of African swine fever virus (ASFV) in our generated network and analyze how the network structure affects the disease spread. We find that high in-degree farm operations (i.e., markets) play critical roles in the disease spread. We also find that high in-degree based targeted isolation and hypothetical vaccinations are more effective for disease control compared to other centrality-based mitigation strategies. The generated networks can be made more robust by validation with more data whenever more movement data will be available."
https://openalex.org/W2992330841,"The timing of both flowering and maturation determine crop adaptability and productivity. Soybean (Glycine max) is cultivated across a wide range of latitudes. The molecular-genetic mechanisms for flowering in soybean have been determined for photoperiodic responses to long days (LDs), but remain only partially determined for the delay of flowering under short-day conditions, an adaptive trait of cultivars grown in lower latitudes. Here, we characterized the late-flowering (LF) habit introduced from the Thai cultivar K3 into a photoperiod-insensitive genetic background under different photo-thermal conditions, and we analyzed the genetic basis using quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping. The LF habit resulted from a basic difference in the floral induction activity and from the suppression of flowering, which was caused by red light-enriched LD lengths and higher temperatures, during which FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) orthologs, FT2a and FT5a, were strongly down-regulated. QTL mapping using gene-specific markers for flowering genes E2, FT2a and FT5a and 829 single nucleotide polymorphisms obtained from restriction-site associated DNA sequencing detected three QTLs controlling the LF habit. Of these, a QTL harboring FT2a exhibited large and stable effects under all the conditions tested. A resequencing analysis detected a nonsynonymous substitution in exon 4 of FT2a from K3, which converted the glycine conserved in FT-like proteins to the aspartic acid conserved in TERMINAL FLOWER 1-like proteins (floral repressors), suggesting a functional depression in the FT2a protein from K3. The effects of the remaining two QTLs, likely corresponding to E2 and FT5a, were environment dependent. Thus, the LF habit from K3 may be caused by the functional depression of FT2a and the down-regulation of two FT genes by red light-enriched LD conditions and high temperatures."
https://openalex.org/W2993245987,"Vaccination-induced Escherichia coli O157:H7-specific immune responses have been shown to reduce E. coli O157:H7 shedding in cattle. Although E. coli O157:H7 colonization is correlated with perturbations in intestinal microbial diversity, it is not yet known whether vaccination against E. coli O157:H7 could cause shifts in bovine intestinal microbiota. To understand the impact of E. coli O157:H7 vaccination and colonization on intestinal microbial diversity, cattle were vaccinated with two doses of different E. coli O157:H7 vaccine formulations. Six weeks post-vaccination, the two vaccinated groups (Vx-Ch) and one non-vaccinated group (NonVx-Ch) were orally challenged with E. coli O157:H7. Another group was neither vaccinated nor challenged (NonVx-NonCh). Fecal microbiota analysis over a 30-day period indicated a significant (FDR corrected, p <0.05) association of bacterial community structure with vaccination until E. coli O157:H7 challenge. Shannon diversity index and species richness were significantly lower in vaccinated compared to non-vaccinated groups after E. coli O157:H7 challenge (p < 0.05). The Firmicutes:Bacteroidetes ratio (p > 0.05) was not associated with vaccination but the relative abundance of Proteobacteria was significantly lower (p < 0.05) in vaccinated calves after E. coli O157:H7 challenge. Similarly, Vx-Ch calves had higher relative abundance of Paeniclostridium spp. and Christenellaceae R7 group while Campylobacter spp., and Sutterella spp. were more abundant in NonVx-Ch group post-E. coli O157:H7 challenge. Only Vx-Ch calves had significantly higher (p < 0.001) E. coli O157:H7-specific serum IgG but no detectable E. coli O157:H7-specific IgA. However, E. coli O157:H7-specific IL-10-producing T cells were detected in vaccinated animals prior to challenge, but IFN-γ-producing T cells were not detected. Neither E. coli O157:H7-specific IgG nor IgA were detected in blood or feces, respectively, of NonVx-Ch and NonVx-NonCh groups prior to or post vaccinations. Both Vx-Ch and NonVx-Ch animals shed detectable levels of challenge strain during the course of the study. Despite the lack of protection with the vaccine formulations there were detectable shifts in the microbiota of vaccinated animals before and after challenge with E. coli O157:H7."
https://openalex.org/W2994375512,"In response to noxious stimuli, planarians cease their typical ciliary gliding and exhibit an oscillatory type of locomotion called scrunching. We have previously characterized the biomechanics of scrunching and shown that it is induced by specific stimuli, such as amputation, noxious heat, and extreme pH. Because these specific inducers are known to activate Transient Receptor Potential (TRP) channels in other systems, we hypothesized that TRP channels control scrunching. We found that chemicals known to activate TRPA1 (allyl isothiocyanate (AITC) and hydrogen peroxide) and TRPV (capsaicin and anandamide) in other systems induce scrunching in the planarian species Dugesia japonica and, except for anandamide, in Schmidtea mediterranea. To confirm that these responses were specific to either TRPA1 or TRPV, respectively, we tried to block scrunching using selective TRPA1 or TRPV antagonists and RNA interference (RNAi) mediated knockdown. Unexpectedly, co-treatment with a mammalian TRPA1 antagonist, HC-030031, enhanced AITC-induced scrunching by decreasing the latency time, suggesting an agonistic relationship in planarians. We further confirmed that TRPA1 in both planarian species is necessary for AITC-induced scrunching using RNAi. Conversely, while co-treatment of a mammalian TRPV antagonist, SB-366791, also enhanced capsaicin-induced reactions in D. japonica, combined knockdown of two previously identified D. japonica TRPV genes (DjTRPVa and DjTRPVb) did not inhibit capsaicin-induced scrunching. RNAi of DjTRPVa/DjTRPVb attenuated scrunching induced by the endocannabinoid and TRPV agonist, anandamide. Overall, our results show that although scrunching induction can involve different initial pathways for sensing stimuli, this behavior’s signature dynamical features are independent of the inducer, implying that scrunching is a stereotypical planarian escape behavior in response to various noxious stimuli that converge on a single downstream pathway. Understanding which aspects of nociception are conserved or not across different organisms can provide insight into the underlying regulatory mechanisms to better understand pain sensation."
https://openalex.org/W2992351026,"Platynereis dumerilii is a marine segmented worm (annelid) with externally fertilized embryos and it can be cultured for the full life cycle in the laboratory. The accessibility of embryos and larvae combined with the breadth of the established molecular and functional techniques has made P. dumerilii an attractive model for studying development, cell lineages, cell type evolution, reproduction, regeneration, the nervous system, and behavior. Traditionally, these worms have been kept in rooms dedicated for their culture. This allows for the regulation of temperature and light cycles, which is critical to synchronizing sexual maturation. However, regulating the conditions of a whole room has limitations, especially if experiments require being able to change culturing conditions. Here we present scalable and flexible culture methods that provide ability to control the environmental conditions, and have a multi-purpose culture space. We provide a closed setup shelving design with proper light conditions necessary for P. dumerilii to mature. We also implemented a standardized method of feeding P. dumerilii cultures with powdered spirulina which relieves the ambiguity associated with using frozen spinach, and helps standardize nutrition conditions across experiments and across different labs. By using these methods, we were able to raise mature P. dumerilii, capable of spawning and producing viable embryos for experimentation and replenishing culture populations. These methods will allow for the further accessibility of P. dumerilii as a model system, and they can be adapted for other aquatic organisms."
https://openalex.org/W2994222260,"Wind energy is one of the most important renewable resources and plays a vital role in reducing carbon emission and solving global warming problem. Every country has made a corresponding energy policy to stimulate wind energy industry development based on wind energy production, consumption, and distribution. In this paper, we focus on forecasting wind energy consumption from a macro perspective. A novel power-driven fractional accumulated grey model (PFAGM) is proposed to solve the wind energy consumption prediction problem with historic annual consumption of the past ten years. PFAGM model optimizes the grey input of the classic fractional grey model with an exponential term of time. For boosting prediction performance, a heuristic intelligent algorithm WOA is used to search the optimal order of PFAGM model. Its linear parameters are estimated by using the least-square method. Then validation experiments on real-life data sets have been conducted to verify the superior prediction accuracy of PFAGM model compared with other three well-known grey models. Finally, the PFAGM model is applied to predict China’s wind energy consumption in the next three years."
https://openalex.org/W2990516994,"Classroom-based physical activity (PA) interventions offer the opportunity to increase PA without disrupting the curriculum. We aimed to explore the feasibility and potential effectiveness of a classroom-based intervention on moderate to vigorous PA (MVPA) and total PA. The secondary aim was to assess the acceptability and sustainability of the intervention. In a mixed-methods, non-randomised, exploratory controlled before-and-after study, 152 children (10 ± 0.7 years) were recruited from five schools; two intervention (n = 72) and three control (n = 80) schools. School teachers delivered an 8-week classroom-based intervention, comprising of 10 minutes daily MVPA integrated into the curriculum. The control schools maintained their usual school routine. Mean daily MVPA (min), total PA (mean cpm), physical fitness, and health-related quality of life measurements were taken at baseline, end of intervention, and 4-weeks post-intervention (follow-up). Data were analysed using a constrained baseline longitudinal analysis model accounting for the hierarchical data structure. For the primary outcomes (MVPA and total PA) the posterior mean difference and 95% compatibility interval were derived using a semi-Bayesian approach with an explicit prior. The acceptability and sustainability of the intervention was explored via thematic content analysis of focus group discussions with teachers (n = 5) and children (n = 50). The difference in mean daily MVPA (intervention-control) was 2.8 (-12.5 to 18.0) min/day at 8 weeks and 7.0 (-8.8 to 22.8) min/day at follow-up. For total PA, the differences were -2 (-127 to 124) cpm at 8-weeks and 11 (-121 to 143) cpm at follow-up. The interval estimates indicate that meaningful mean effects (both positive and negative) as well as trivial effects are reasonably compatible with the data and design. The intervention was received positively with continuation reported by the teachers and children. Classroom-based PA could hold promise for increasing average daily MVPA, but a large cluster randomised controlled trial is required."
https://openalex.org/W2993745642,"Plasmodium (P.) falciparum malaria during pregnancy has been frequently associated with severe consequences such as maternal anemia, abortion, premature birth, and reduced birth weight. Placental damage promotes disruption of the local homeostasis; though, the mechanisms underlying these events are still to be elucidated. Autophagy is a fundamental homeostatic mechanism in the natural course of pregnancy by which cells self-recycle in order to survive in stressful environments. Placentas from non-infected and P. falciparum-infected women during pregnancy were selected from a previous prospective cohort study conducted in the Brazilian Amazon (Acre, Brazil). Newborns from infected women experienced reduced birth weight (P = 0.0098) and placental immunopathology markers such as monocyte infiltrate (P < 0.0001) and IL-10 production (P = 0.0122). The placentas were evaluated for autophagy-related molecules. As a result, we observed reduced mRNA levels of ULK1 (P = 0.0255), BECN1 (P = 0.0019), and MAP1LC3B (P = 0.0086) genes in placentas from P. falciparum-infected, which was more striking in those diagnosed with placental malaria. Despite the protein levels of these genes followed the same pattern, the observed reduction was not statistically significant in placentas from P. falciparum-infected women. Nevertheless, our data suggest that chronic placental immunopathology due to P. falciparum infection leads to autophagy dysregulation, which might impair local homeostasis during malaria in pregnancy that may result in poor pregnancy outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W2994113398,"Introduction Surgical site infections are infections that take place within 30 days of an operative procedure. Worldwide, 23% of patients develop surgical site infections among all surgeries annually with the worst complications causing prolonged hospital stays, increased resistance of microorganisms to antimicrobials, higher health system costs, emotional stress for patients and their families, and substantial economic burdens on hospitals. Therefore, this study was created to assess the magnitude and associated factors of surgical site infection at Wolaita Sodo University Teaching and Referral Hospital. Method We conducted a hospital-based cross-sectional study on patients who underwent a surgical procedure in 2018 at Wolaita Sodo University Teaching and Referral Hospital. We applied a systematic random sampling technique to obtain 261 patient records from all records of surgical patients from January 1, 2018, to December 30, 2018. We collected data using a pretested checklist. We used bivariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis to identify factors associated with surgical site infection. We considered a P-value < 0.05 as statistically significant. Summary measures, texts, tables, and figures present the results of the analysis. Result Among the 261 patients, 34 or 13% (95% CI = 9.2%, 17.2%) developed surgical site infection. Patients younger than 40 years old [AOR 6.45; 95% CI (1.56, 26.67)], illiterate [AOR 4.25; 95% CI (1.52, 11.84)], with a history of previous hospitalization [AOR 4.50; 95% CI (1.44, 14.08)], with a prolonged preoperative hospital stay (≥ 7 days) [AOR 3.88; 95% CI (1.46, 10.29)], and admitted to the public wing of the ward [AOR 0.24; 95% CI (0.07, 0.79)] possessed factors associated with surgical site infection. Conclusion The magnitude of surgical site infection in this study was high. Shortening preoperative hospital stays, delivering intravenous antimicrobial prophylaxis before surgery, and giving wound care as ordered would significantly reduce the incidence of surgical site infection."
https://openalex.org/W2993459435,"Non-structural carbohydrates (NSCs) are an important energy source for plant growth and metabolism. Analysis of NSC changes can provide important clues to reveal the adaptation mechanisms of plants to a specific environment. Although considerable differences have been reported in NSCs in response to nitrogen (N) application among crop species and cultivars, previous studies have mostly focused on the differences in leaves and stems. However, the effects of N on the characteristics of accumulation and translocation of NSC in maize with different levels of N tolerance remain unclear. To determine differences in the N levels, two cultivars (N-efficient ZH311 and N-inefficient XY508) were grown in field pots (Experiment I) and as hydroponic cultures (Experiment II) and were supplemented with different concentrations of N fertilizer. In both experiments, low-N stress significantly increased the accumulation of NSCs in maize vegetative organs and increased the translocation rate of NSCs in the stems and their apparent contribution to yield, thereby reducing the yield loss caused by low-N stress. N application had a greater effect on starch content in the vegetative organs of ZH311, but had less effect on soluble sugar (SS) and NSC content in the whole plant and starch content in the ears. ZH311 could convert more starch into SS under low N conditions to adapt to low N environments than XY508, while ensuring that grain yield and starch quantity were not affected. This is evidently an important physiological mechanism involved in this cultivar's tolerance to low N conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2993931248,"The grassland soils of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP) store a large amount of organic carbon because of the cold, humid climate, and topsoil organic carbon is quite sensitive to global climate changes. However, the spatio-temporal dynamics and factors that influence the soil organic carbon (SOC) on the QTP's grassland are not understood well. Moreover, there are few comparative analyses of different approaches to estimate the QTP' SOC. In this study, we estimated the storage and patterns of SOC density (SOCD) using several methods, including MODIS (moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer) retrieval, field data and previous empirical models (Models1-4, and soil organic matter (SOM)). And their relations with aboveground biomass, soil moisture, temperature, elevation, and soil conductivity were further explored. The results showed that SOC showed a similar variation trend in the different models, in which it decreased with increasing bulk density (BD) in the topsoil at 30 cm. For meadow and steppe grasslands, Models 1, 2, and 4 showed similar estimated values of SOCD, while Model3 had a lower value than them. SOC storage in the BD 3 and SOM methods had abnormal values, while the MODIS-NDVI, BD 1, 2, and 4 methods had similar SOC stock values for meadow and steppe grassland. Moreover, meadow grassland had a higher SOC storage than did steppe grassland, with means values of 397.9×1010 kg and 242.2×1010 kg, respectively. SOCD's spatial distribution using MODIS-NDVI method differed clearly from the empirical models, with a significant tendency for spatial variation that increased from the northwestern to southeastern regions on the QTP. Therefore, based on the values estimated and spatial variation features, the MODIS-NDVI method may be a more feasible and valid model to estimate SOC. Moreover, the mean annual SOCD values during 2000-2015 showed an increasing trend, with a higher mean value in meadow and a lower mean value in steppe. Further, SOCD was correlated significantly and positively with aboveground biomass and soil moisture, and negatively correlated with elevation and soil conductivity. Increasing temperature had negative effects on SOCD, which was consistent with the global trend. These results indicated that topsoil moisture plays a key role in SOCD spatial patterns. Our results provide valuable support for the long-term estimation of SOCD in future research on the QTP."
https://openalex.org/W2991954278,"The utility of echo decorrelation imaging feedback for real-time control of in vivo ultrasound thermal ablation was assessed in rabbit liver with VX2 tumor. High-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) and unfocused (bulk) ablation were performed using 5 MHz linear image-ablate arrays. Treatments comprised up to nine lower-power sonications, followed by up to nine higher-power sonications, ceasing when the average cumulative echo decorrelation within a control region of interest exceeded a predefined threshold (− 2.3, log10-scaled echo decorrelation per millisecond, corresponding to 90% specificity for tumor ablation prediction in previous in vivo experiments). This threshold was exceeded in all cases for both HIFU (N = 12) and bulk (N = 8) ablation. Controlled HIFU trials achieved a significantly higher average ablation rate compared to comparable ablation trials without image-based control, reported previously. Both controlled HIFU and bulk ablation trials required significantly less treatment time than these previous uncontrolled trials. Prediction of local liver and VX2 tumor ablation using echo decorrelation was tested using receiver operator characteristic curve analysis, showing prediction capability statistically equivalent to uncontrolled trials. Compared to uncontrolled trials, controlled trials resulted in smaller thermal ablation regions and higher contrast between echo decorrelation in treated vs. untreated regions. These results indicate that control using echo decorrelation imaging may reduce treatment duration and increase treatment reliability for in vivo thermal ablation."
https://openalex.org/W2994174509,"Sophora alopecuroides (Faboideae) is an endemic species, mainly distributed in northwest China. However, the limited molecular markers range for this species hinders breeding and genetic studies. A total of 20,324 simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers were identified from 118,197 assembled transcripts and 18 highly polymorphic SSR markers were used to explore the genetic diversity and population structure of S. alopecuroides from 23 different geographical populations. A relatively low genetic diversity was found in S. alopecuroides based on mean values of the number of effective alleles (Ne = 1.81), expected heterozygosity (He = 0.39) and observed heterozygosity (Ho = 0.55). The results of AMOVA indicated higher levels of variation within populations than between populations. Bayesian-based cluster analysis, principal coordinates analysis and Neighbor-Joining phylogeny analysis roughly divided all genotypes into four major groups with some admixtures. Meanwhile, geographic barriers would have restricted gene flow between the northern and southern regions (separated by Tianshan Mountains), wherein the two relatively ancestral and independent clusters of S. alopecuroides occur. History trade and migration along the Silk Road would together have promoted the spread of S. alopecuroides from the western to the eastern regions of the northwest plateau in China, resulting in the current genetic diversity and population structure. The transcriptomic SSR markers provide a valuable resource for understanding the genetic diversity and population structure of S. alopecuroides, and will assist effective conservation management."
https://openalex.org/W2994283297,"Collagen accumulation and remodeling in the vascular wall is a cardinal feature of vascular fibrosis that exacerbates the complications of hypertension, aging, diabetes and atherosclerosis. With no specific therapy available to date, identification of mechanisms underlying vascular fibrogenesis is an important clinical goal. Here, we tested the hypothesis that Discoidin Domain Receptor 2 (DDR2), a collagen-specific receptor tyrosine kinase, is a determinant of arterial fibrosis. We report a significant increase in collagen type 1 levels along with collagen and ECM remodeling, degradation of elastic laminae, enhanced fat deposition and calcification in the abdominal aorta in a non-human primate model of high-fat, high-sucrose diet (HFS)-induced metabolic syndrome. These changes were associated with a marked increase in DDR2. Resveratrol attenuated collagen type I deposition and remodeling induced by the HFS diet, with a concomintant reduction in DDR2. Further, in isolated rat vascular adventitial fibroblasts and VSMCs, hyperglycemia increased DDR2 and collagen type I expression via TGF-β1/SMAD2/3, which was attenuated by resveratrol. Notably, gene knockdown and overexpression approaches demonstrated an obligate role for DDR2 in hyperglycemia-induced increase in collagen type I expression in these cells. Together, our observations point to DDR2 as a hitherto unrecognized molecular link between metabolic syndrome and arterial fibrosis, and hence a therapeutic target."
https://openalex.org/W2994110738,"Background Flexible sigmoidoscopy and colonoscopy are both recommended colorectal cancer screening options, but their relative effectiveness needs clarification. The aim of this study was to compare the effectiveness of colonoscopy and flexible sigmoidoscopy for reduction of colorectal cancer incidence. Methods We conducted a case-control study within the linked Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-Medicare database. Cases were subjects age 70-85 years in the SEER-Medicare database diagnosed with CRC during 2004-2013. Up to 3 controls were matched to each case by birth year, sex, race, and SEER region. Receipt of screening colonoscopy or flexible sigmoidoscopy was ascertained from Medicare claims. Conditional logistic regression models were developed to estimate the odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for a history of screening in cases vs. controls. We conducted secondary analyses by sex, race, endoscopist characteristics, and with varying timing and duration of the look-back period. Results Receipt of screening colonoscopy and sigmoidoscopy was associated with a 59% (OR 0.41, 95%CI 0.39, 0.43) and 22% reduction (OR 0.78, 95%CI 0.67, 0.92) in colorectal cancer incidence, respectively. Colonoscopy was associated with greater reduction in the distal colorectal cancer incidence (OR 0.22, 95%CI 0.20, 0.24) than proximal colorectal cancer incidence (OR 0.62, 95%CI 0.59, 0.66). Sigmoidoscopy was associated with a 52% reduction in distal colorectal cancer incidence (OR 0.48, 95%CI 0.37, 0.63), but with no reduction in proximal colorectal cancer incidence. These associations were stronger in men than in women. No differences by race or endoscopist characteristics were observed. Conclusion Both screening colonoscopy and sigmoidoscopy were associated with reductions in overall colorectal cancer incidence, with a greater magnitude of reduction observed with colonoscopy."
https://openalex.org/W2992362188,"Background Only a very few studies had compared the differences in topographic patterns of cerebral infarcts between middle cerebral artery (MCA) and internal carotid artery (ICA) disease. Besides, the comparison of clinical features and outcomes between MCA and ICA disease had rarely been reported. Objectives To compare the clinical, imaging features and outcome of MCA versus ICA disease. Methods We prospectively enrolled 1172 patients with noncardiogenic ischemic stroke in ipsilateral ICA or MCA territory. Clinical, neuroradiologic and outcome of the two groups were compared in this observational cohort study. Results The ICA group more frequently presented with decreased alertness, gaze palsy, aphasia, and neglect than the MCA group at admission, and more often had higher National Institute of Health stroke scale score at admission and discharge. Meanwhile, the ICA group more frequently had multiple acute infarcts, watershed infarcts, territorial infarct, small cortical infarct, and responsible artery stenosis ≥70%. Whereas penetrating artery infarct and parent artery occluding penetrating artery was more often associated with MCA disease. The ICA group more frequently had inhospital complications of pneumonia and deep vein thrombosis, more often had disability at discharge, and had more recurrent ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack in 1 Year. Multivariable logistic regression identified male (OR, 1.99; 95% CI, 1.30 to 3.05; P = 0.002), history of coronary heart disease (OR, 1.85; 95% CI, 1.03 to 3.32; P = 0.041), multiple acute infarcts (OR, 4.18; 95% CI, 2.07 to 8.45; P<0.0001), and territorial infarct (OR, 2.23; 95% CI, 1.52 to 3.27; P<0.0001) was more often associated with ICA territory disease. Conclusions The clinical, radiologic characteristics and outcome are distinctively different between ICA and MCA disease. Compared to MCA disease, ICA disease has more serious clinical and radiologic manifestation, and poorer outcome."
https://openalex.org/W2993086379,"In order to perform difficult vaults in artistic gymnastics, athletes have to achieve high run-up speeds within the limited run-up distance (25m). However, the physical parameters that contribute to a high run-up speed and their age-related differences remain elusive. Hence, the aim of this study was 1) to investigate interrelations between difficulty value (D-score) and run-up kinematics of Handspring/Tsukahara and Yurchenko vaults as well as lower body power (25m-sprint, explosive and reactive strength) and 2) to explore age-related differences of these parameters across junior and elite gymnasts performing Handspring/Tsukahara vaults. For this purpose, the data (of the above mentioned parameters) of 47 top-level male elite and junior gymnasts aged 14.3 to 28.3 of performance testing, gathered over three years, were analysed. We found that D-score of Handspring/Tsukahara (n = 33) was strongly correlated with run-up speed (r = 0.79; p < 0.01). Further, 25m sprint speed (r = 0.85; p < 0.01) was significantly associated with run-up speed of Handspring/Tsukahara-vaults. There were no significant relationships with the D-score of Yurchenko (n = 14). Looking at the age-related differences of Handspring/Tsukahara, D-score increased significantly from junior to elite level (+11.6%; p < 0.01). The comparison between consecutive age-groups revealed that the U19 group had higher run-up speeds, step lengths, body weights and heights than the U17 group, while the U21 group achieved significantly higher speeds (run-up, 25m-sprint) and explosive strength than the U19 group. We concluded 1) that the optimization of important physical determinants may increase the potential to perform more difficult Handspring/Tsukahara vaults and 2) that first growth and maturation and later improvements of lower body power led to higher run-up speeds of Handspring/Tsukahara in the subsequent age-group. Therefore, based on performance testing of the lower limbs, training recommendations should be given specifically to the requirements of the competition vault."
https://openalex.org/W2994179415,"The reproductive biology of only a small fraction of Neotropical freshwater fishes has been described, and detailed comparative studies of reproductive life-history variation in the Neotropical ichthyofauna are lacking. Here we describe interspecific variation in reproductive life history for a multi-species assemblage of the electric knifefish genus Brachyhypopomus (Hypopomidae: Gymnotiformes: Ostariophysi) from Amazonian floodplain and terra firme stream systems. During a year-round quantitative sampling program, we collected and measured key life-history traits from 3,410 individuals. Based on oocyte size distributions, and on circannual variation in gonadosomatic indices, hepatosomatic indices, and capture-per-unit-effort abundance of reproductive adults, we concluded that all species exhibit a single protracted annual breeding season during which females spawn fractionally. We found small clusters of post-larval individuals in one floodplain species and one terra firme stream species, but no signs of parental care. From analyses of body size-frequency distributions and otolith growth increments, we concluded that five species in our study area have approximately one-year (annual) semelparous life history with a single reproductive period followed by death, while two species have a two-year iteroparous life history, with breeding in both year-groups. Despite predictions from life-history theory we found no salient correlations between life history strategy (semelparity or iteroparity) and habitat occupancy (floodplain or terra firme stream). In the iteroparous species B. beebei, we documented evidence for reproductive restraint in the first breeding season relative to the second breeding season and argue that this is consistent with age-regulated terminal investment."
https://openalex.org/W2992051836,"When loss of heterozygosity (LOH) is correlated with loss or gain of a disease phenotype, it is often necessary to identify which gene or genes are involved. Here, we developed a region-specific LOH-inducing system based on mitotic crossover in human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs). We first tested our system on chromosome 19. To detect homozygous clones generated by LOH, a positive selection cassette was inserted at the AASV1 locus of chromosome 19. LOHs were generated by the combination of allele-specific double-stranded DNA breaks introduced by CRISPR/Cas9 and suppression of Bloom syndrome (BLM) gene expression by the Tet-Off system. The BLM protein inhibitor ML216 exhibited a similar crossover efficiency and distribution of crossover sites. We next applied this system to the short arm of chromosome 6, where human leukocyte antigen (HLA) loci are located. Genotyping and flow cytometric analysis demonstrated that LOHs associated with chromosomal crossover occurred at the expected positions. Although careful examination of HLA-homozygous hiPSCs generated from parental cells is needed for cancer predisposition and effectiveness of differentiation, they may help to mitigate the current shortcoming of hiPSC-based transplantation related to the immunological differences between the donor and host."
https://openalex.org/W2992454282,"Due to the limited host range of orf virus (ORFV), primary cells derived from its natural hosts, such as goats and sheep, are recommended for isolation and propagation of wild type ORFV. This situation limits the option for the study of virus-host interaction during ORFV infection since primary cells only support a few numbers of passages. SV40 T antigen is a viral oncoprotein that can abrogate replicative senescence, leading to an extended life span of cells. In this study, the transformation of two goat primary cells, fibroblast (FB) and testis (GT) cells, were achieved by stably expressing SV40 T antigen using the lentiviral technique. The presence of the gene encoding SV40 T antigen was validated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and western blot analyses. As evidenced by immunofluorescent microscopy, the two types of cells expressing SV40 T antigen (namely, FBT and GTT) were purified to homogeneity. Moreover, faster growth kinetics and a lower serum dependency were noticed in FBT and GTT, as compared with their counterpart parental cells. FBT and GTT remain permissive and can form plaque of ORFV, despite with different profiles; generally speaking, with SV40 T expression, ORFV forms plaques with smaller size and distinct margin. Most importantly, the prolonged life span of goat FBT and GTT serves as an ideal cell culture resource for ORFV isolation from the field, studies of ORFV pathogenesis and efficient vaccine development."
https://openalex.org/W2993345434,"In early-onset generalized torsion dystonia, caused by a GAG deletion in TOR1A (DYT1), enhanced striatal cholinergic activity has been suggested to be critically involved. Previous studies have shown increased acetylcholine levels in the striatum of DYT1 knock-in (KI) mice. Ex vivo data indicated that muscarinic receptor antagonists normalize the activity of striatal cholinergic interneurons. Currently receptor subtype specific antagonists are developed for therapy, however, it is yet unknown whether the levels of targeted receptors are unaltered. In the present study, we firstly examined the expression of M1 and M4 receptors in DYT1 KI mice in comparison to wildtype mice. While no changes in mRNA were found in the motor cortex, the expression of M1 was higher in the striatum of DYT1 KI. However, M1 protein did not differ in striatum and cortex between the animal groups as shown by immunohistochemistry and western blot. M4 receptor protein, unaltered in the cortex, was slightly lower in lateral subparts of the striatum, but unchanged in somata of cholinergic interneurons and substance P immunoreactive projection neurons. Functional alterations of the cholinergic system and of aberrant striatal plasticity, demonstrated by previous studies, seem not to be related to overt changes in M1 and M4 expression. This critically informs the ongoing development of respective antagonists for therapy of dystonia."
https://openalex.org/W2993817291,"The objective of this study was to investigate the relationship between fat infiltration in the cervical multifidi and fat infiltration measured in the lower extremities to move further into understanding the complex signs and symptoms arising from a whiplash trauma. Thirty-one individuals with chronic whiplash associated disorders, stratified into a mild/moderate group and a severe group, together with 31 age- and gender matched controls were enrolled in this study. Magnetic resonance imaging was used to acquire a 3D volume of the neck and of the whole-body. Cervical multifidi was used to represent muscles local to the whiplash trauma and all muscles below the hip joint, the lower extremities, were representing widespread muscles distal to the site of the trauma. The fat infiltration was determined by fat fraction in the segmented images. There was a linear correlation between local and distal muscle fat infiltration (p<0.001, r2 = 0.28). The correlation remained significant when adjusting for age and WAD group (p = 0.009) as well as when correcting for age, WAD group and BMI (p = 0.002). There was a correlation between local and distal muscle fat infiltration within the severe WAD group (p = 0.0016, r2 = 0.69) and in the healthy group (p = 0.022, r2 = 0.17) but not in the mild/moderate group (p = 0.29, r2 = 0.06). No significant differences (p = 0.11) in the lower extremities’ MFI between the different groups were found. The absence of differences between the groups in terms of lower extremities’ muscle fat infiltration indicates that, in this particular population, the whiplash trauma has a local effect on muscle fat infiltration rather than a generalized."
https://openalex.org/W2992998741,"Groin pain is a common problem in athletes which results in loss of playing time. Moreover, it can be for the cause of athletic career termination. A common cause of groin pain in athletes is inguinal disruption; pain in the groin area near the pubic tubercle were no obvious other pathology exists to explain the symptoms. Aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of endoscopic totally extraperitoneal (TEP) hernia repair in athletes with inguinal disruption.Thirty-one athletes with chronic groin pain due to inguinal disruption, who had undergone conservative therapy without any effect, were included in this prospective cohort study. Prior to surgery patients were assessed by clinical examination, ultrasound of the inguinal region, x-ray and a radionuclide bone scan with single photon-emission computed tomography and CT (SPECT-CT). TEP hernia repair was performed and a lightweight polypropylene mesh was placed pre-peritoneally. Additionally the athletes' perception about their groin disability was assessed preoperatively and 6 weeks postoperatively by means of the Hip and Groin Outcome Score (HAGOS). The HAGOS consists of six subscales: Pain, Symptoms, Physical function in daily living, Physical function in Sport and Recreation, Participation in Physical Activities, and hip and/or groin-related Quality of Life.No complications occurred during and after surgery. After six weeks patients improved in all the separate subscales of the Hip and Groin Outcome Score (HAGOS). Within 6 weeks of surgery, 26 patients (84%) returned to sports activities with no or less groin pain.This study showed that endoscopic totally extraperitoneal (TEP) hernia repair is an effective surgical treatment of inguinal disruption in athletes with chronic groin pain."

We amplified and sequenced the hypervariable V4 region of the 18S rRNA gene of Babesia and Theileria and the heat shock protein gene (groEL) of Ehrlichia/Anaplasma in DNA extracted from elephant blood (n = 104) and from elephant ticks (n = 52). Our results showed that the African elephants were infected with a novel Babesia spp. while A. thollonii was infected with Theileria bicornis and Theileria cf. velifera. This is the first record of T. bicornis; a protozoan that is linked to fatal infection in rhinoceros in a tick. Elephants and their ticks were all infected with a species of Ehrlichia like that identified in Japanese deer. The prevalence of Babesia spp., Theileria spp. and Ehrlichia spp. in ticks was higher than that of their elephant hosts. About 13.5% of elephants were positive for Theileria or Babesia while 51% of A. thollonii ticks and 27% of R. humeralis ticks were positive for Theileria or Babesia. Moreover, 5.8% of elephants were positive for Ehrlichia or Anaplasma compared to 19.5% in A. thollonii and 18% in R. humeralis. There was no association between the positive result in ticks and that of their elephant hosts for either Babesia spp., Theileria spp. or Ehrlichia spp. Our study reveals that the African elephants are naturally infected with Babesia spp and Ehrlichia spp and opens up an opportunity for further studies to determine the role of elephant as reservoirs of tick-borne pathogens, and to investigate their potential in spreading these pathogens as they range extensively. The presence of T. bicornis in A. thollonii also suggests a need for experiments to confirm its vector competence."
https://openalex.org/W2992542720,"Background Maternal nutrition status (e.g. dietary/nutrient intake) during pregnancy has been associated with pregnancy outcomes including birth weight, infant survival and metabolic health of the offspring during later life. During the past few years, maternal dietary intake, at least three months before conception, has been shown to affect pregnancy outcomes also. However, literature investigating this link is still scarce. The studies that have looked at preconception dietary intake in relation to pregnancy outcome were either animal studies, had small sample sizes or focused on only selected macronutrient intake rather than complete (macro)nutrient composition or dietary intakes (e.g. food groups). Therefore, we aim to investigate the association between preconception diet and pregnancy outcomes in a linked birth cohort. The main objective of this manuscript is to describe the methodology of establishing this birth cohort and to describe both the characteristics of the study population included as well as the representativeness in terms of dietary intake. Methods We created the birth cohort by linking two existing databases; a large population-based cohort study in the Netherlands (The Lifelines Cohort study) and the Dutch national birth registry (Perined), through a ‘trusted third party’. The birth cohort contains information on maternal dietary intake during preconception as well as pregnancy outcomes. Results and discussion In the Lifelines Cohort study, 3,418 pregnancies were available for linking with Perined. In total, 2,368 pregnancies (86.9%) were linked with Perined, resulting in the birth cohort. With this linked cohort we are able to provide insights on the associations between dietary intake before conception and pregnancy outcomes. Such data could potentially improve nutritional care for women of childbearing age. Lifestyle changes in the period preceding pregnancy may be most effective in improving pregnancy outcomes. A focus on this window of opportunity may provide both sufficient time, as well as a period when women are potentially motivated to adopt health optimizing behaviours."
https://openalex.org/W2993795354,"Self-defining memories (SDM) are autobiographical memories associated with the construction and maintenance of identity, and which play a core role in establishing and achieving goals in life. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effort required in retrieving SDM as reflected by physiological activity. We examined the neurovegetative responses associated with three dimensions of SDM: specificity, integrative meaning and emotional valence. Electrodermal activity (skin conductance response frequency, phasic driver) and the high frequency component of heart rate variability (HF-HRV) were recorded during the retrieval of SDM in 36 healthy participants to assess the activation of the sympathetic and parasympathetic systems, respectively. SDM were characterized by three independent investigators with satisfactory inter-rater reliability. Linear mixed effects analyses showed that only the integrative meaning dimension led to a main effect on electrodermal activity. In addition, an interaction effect showed that the retrieval of non-integrative and specific memories was associated with a higher level of electrodermal activity than the retrieval of integrative specific memories. No effects were obtained regarding the HRV indicators. The higher activation of the sympathetic nervous system associated with the retrieval of non-integrative SDM suggests that the ability to derive meaning from personal experiences plays a regulatory role and is a fundamental component in personal adjustment."
https://openalex.org/W2989607686,"The cytokinin dehydrogenase gene HvCKX2.1 is the regulatory target for the most abundant heterochromatic small RNAs in drought-stressed barley caryopses. We investigated the diversity of HvCKX2.1 in 228 barley landraces and 216 wild accessions and identified 14 haplotypes, five of these with ten or more members, coding for four different protein variants. The third largest haplotype was abundant in wild accessions (51 members), but absent from the landrace collection. Protein structure predictions indicated that the amino acid substitution specific to haplotype 3 could result in a change in the functional properties of the HvCKX2.1 protein. Haplotypes 1-3 have overlapping geographical distributions in the wild population, but the average rainfall amounts at the collection sites for haplotype 3 plants are significantly higher during November to February compared to the equivalent data for plants of haplotypes 1 and 2. We argue that the likelihood that haplotype 3 plants were excluded from landraces by sampling bias that occurred when the first wild barley plants were taken into cultivation is low, and that it is reasonable to suggest that plants with haplotype 3 are absent from the crop because these plants were less suited to the artificial conditions associated with cultivation. Although the cytokinin signalling pathway influences many aspects of plant development, the identified role of HvCKX2.1 in the drought response raises the possibility that the particular aspect of cultivation that mitigated against haplotype 3 relates in some way to water utilization. Our results therefore highlight the possibility that water utilization properties should be looked on as a possible component of the suite of physiological adaptations accompanying the domestication and subsequent evolution of cultivated barley."
https://openalex.org/W2993777847,"The single photon response (SPR) in vertebrate photoreceptors is inherently variable due to several stochastic events in the phototransduction cascade, the main one being the shutoff of photoactivated rhodopsin. Deactivation is driven by a random number of steps, each of random duration with final quenching occurring after a random delay. Nevertheless, variability of the SPR is relatively low, making the signal highly reliable. Several biophysical and mathematical mechanisms contributing to variability suppression have been examined by the authors. Here we investigate the contribution of local depletion of cGMP by PDE*, the non linear dependence of the photocurrent on cGMP, Ca2+ feedback by making use of a fully space resolved (FSR) mathematical model, applied to two species (mouse and salamander), by varying the cGMP diffusion rate severalfold and rod outer segment diameter by an order of magnitude, and by introducing new, more refined, and time dependent variability functionals. Globally well stirred (GWS) models, and to a lesser extent transversally well stirred models (TWS), underestimate the role of nonlinearities and local cGMP depletion in quenching the variability of the circulating current with respect to fully space resolved models (FSR). These distortions minimize the true extent to which SPR is stabilized by locality in cGMP depletion, nonlinear effects linking cGMP to current, and Ca2+ feedback arising from the physical separation of E* from the ion channels located on the outer shell, and the diffusion of these second messengers in the cytoplasm."
https://openalex.org/W2993814597,"Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) have been suggested to be involved in the regulation of one-carbon metabolism. Previously we have reported effects on plasma concentrations of metabolites along these pathways as well as markers of B-vitamin status in rats following treatment with a pan-PPAR agonist. Here we aimed to investigate the effect on these metabolites after specific activation of the PPARα and PPARγ subtypes.For a period of 12 days, Male Wistar rats (n = 20) were randomly allocated to receive treatment with the PPARα agonist WY-14.643 (n = 6), the PPARγ agonist rosiglitazone (n = 6) or placebo (n = 8). The animals were sacrificed under fasting conditions, and plasma concentration of metabolites were determined. Group differences were assessed by one-way ANOVA, and planned comparisons were performed for both active treatment groups towards the control group.Treatment with a PPARα agonist was associated with increased plasma concentrations of most biomarkers, with the most pronounced differences observed for betaine, dimethylglycine, glycine, nicotinamide, methylnicotinamide, pyridoxal and methylmalonic acid. Lower levels were observed for flavin mononucleotide. Fewer associations were observed after treatment with a PPARγ agonist, and the most notable was increased plasma serine.Treatment with a PPARα agonist influenced plasma concentration of one-carbon metabolites and markers of B-vitamin status. This confirms previous findings, suggesting specific involvement of PPARα in the regulation of these metabolic pathways as well as the status of closely related B-vitamins."
https://openalex.org/W2994346245,"We bilaterally injected 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) into the medial forebrain bundle of rats and developed bilateral Parkinson's disease (PD) model rats in order to experimentally investigate the neural mechanisms underlying the alteration of nociception in the orofacial region of patients with PD. We explored the effects of dopamine depletion on nociception by investigating behavioral responses (face rubbing) triggered by subcutaneous administration of formalin into the vibrissa pad. We also assessed the number of c-Fos-immunoreactive (c-Fos-IR) cells in the superficial layers of the trigeminal spinal subnucleus caudalis (Vc). Subcutaneous formalin administration evoked a two-phase increase in face rubbing. We observed the first increase 0-5 min after formalin administration (first phase) and the second increase 10-60 min after administration (second phase). The number of face rubbing behaviors of 6OHDA-injected rats did not significantly change compared with saline-injected rats in both phases. Significant increase of c-Fos-IR cells in the Vc was found in 6-OHDA-injected rats after formalin administration compared with those in saline-injected rats after formalin administration. We also assessed expression of c-Fos-IR cells in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN), and significant decrease of c-Fos-IR cells in the PVN of 6-OHDA-injected rats was found. Taken together, these findings suggest that bilateral dopaminergic denervation evoked by 6-OHDA administration causes hyperalgesia in the trigeminal region and the PVN may be involved in the hyperalgesia."
https://openalex.org/W2993182236,"This study investigates the bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus, Montagu 1821) habitat use in the Portofino marine protected area (NW Italy) and adjacent waters, a core area for the dolphins and a highly touristic area in the Mediterranean Sea. A permanent automated real-time passive acoustic monitoring system, able to detect and track dolphins continuously, was tested in the area within the activities of the Life+ Nature project ARION. The habits of bottlenose dolphins was investigated considering the resident rate inside the area, which quantifies the amount of time dolphins spent in these waters, by means of random forest regression. The dependency of dolphin resident rate was analyzed in relation to four explanatory variables: sea surface temperature, season, time of day, and proximity to the coast. Dolphins spent more time in the area during spring and when sea surface temperature ranged between 15-16°C. Summer resulted the season with lower dolphin residency with significant difference between working day and weekend, in the last the lowest residency was recorded. Main findings provide important information to properly manage the area in order to protect bottlenose dolphins."
https://openalex.org/W2993461117,"This study aimed at illustrating how direct measurements, mobile laser scanning and hydraulic modelling can be combined to quantify environmental drivers, improve vegetation models and increase our understanding of vegetation patterns in a sub-arctic river valley. Our results indicate that the resultant vegetation models successfully predict riparian vegetation patterns (Rho = 0.8 for total species richness, AUC = 0.97 for distribution) and highlight differences between eight functional species groups (Rho 0.46-0.84; AUC 0.79-0.93; functional group-specific effects). In our study setting, replacing the laser scanning-based and hydraulic modelling-based variables with a proxy variable elevation did not significantly weaken the models. However, using directly measured and modelled variables allows relating species patterns to e.g. stream power or the length of the flood-free period. Substituting these biologically relevant variables with proxies mask important processes and may reduce the transferability of the results into other sites. At the local scale, the amount of litter is a highly important driver of total species richness, distribution and abundance patterns (relative influences 49, 72 and 83%, respectively) and across all functional groups (13-57%; excluding lichen species richness) in the sub-arctic river valley. Moreover, soil organic matter and soil water content shape vegetation patterns (on average 16 and 7%, respectively). Fluvial disturbance is a key limiting factor only for lichen, bryophyte and dwarf shrub species in this environment (on average 37, 6 and 10%, respectively). Fluvial disturbance intensity is the most important component of disturbance for most functional groups while the length of the disturbance-free period is more relevant for lichens. We conclude that striving for as accurate quantifications of environmental drivers as possible may reveal important processes and functional group differences and help anticipate future changes in vegetation. Mobile laser scanning, high-resolution digital elevation models and hydraulic modelling offer useful methodology for improving correlative vegetation models."
https://openalex.org/W2994326888,"The objectives of this study were to assess gastrointestinal transit times, sedation, and signs of nausea associated with intravenous lidocaine infusions in dogs following targeted acupuncture at Pericardium-6 (PC6) and Stomach-36 (ST36). In a randomized, blind crossover design, 6 healthy, adult Beagles were fed thirty 1.5 mm barium-impregnated polyethylene spheres (BIPS), then were subject to 30 minutes of: 1) no acupuncture, 2) bilateral targeted acupuncture at PC6 and ST36, or 3) bilateral non-target acupuncture at Lung-5 (LU5) and Bladder-55 (BL55). Lidocaine was immediately administered at 1 mg/kg intravenously followed by 50 μg/kg/min. BIPS were tracked radiographically; sedation and nausea were scored at baseline (Time 0) and for 11 hours during lidocaine infusions. Transit times and sedation and nausea scores were analyzed with a linear mixed-effects model; the number of BIPS at defined time points was analyzed with a piecewise linear mixed-effects model. All P values were two-sided and P < 0.05 was considered significant. Sedation and nausea scores did not differ between treatments at any time point (all P > 0.05). However, nausea scores in all groups were significantly greater at Times 5 through 7 and at Time 11 compared to Time 0 whereas sedation scores in all groups were significantly greater at Times 2 through 11 compared to Time 0 (all P < 0.05). The number of BIPs found out of the stomach, the number found in the large intestine, gastric emptying and gastrointestinal transit times did not differ between treatments (all P > 0.05). Acupuncture at PC6 and ST36 did not alleviate nausea and sedation associated with lidocaine infusions in clinically normal animals or affect gastric emptying and gastrointestinal transit."
https://openalex.org/W2994304481,"This study looked at eye movements in relation to source memory in older adults. Participants first studied images of common objects appearing in different quadrants of a screen. After a delay, they were shown cues one at a time presented in all four quadrants. Participants stated whether or not the cue had been seen before and in which location. Participants also rated level of confidence in their responses. In trials where participants either claimed they have not seen a previously presented cue or placed it in an incorrect location, they looked significantly more at the correct quadrant. The proportion of time looking at the correct quadrants during incorrect responses was not related to confidence ratings. These results suggest that eye gaze during the memory task does not reflect memory retrieval below the threshold of verbal report. They instead point to an implicit form of source memory in humans that is accessible to eye movements but not to verbal responses."
https://openalex.org/W2994421585,"Understanding the regulation of development can help elucidate the pathogenesis behind many developmental defects found in humans and other vertebrates. Evidence has shown that alternative splicing of messenger RNA (mRNA) plays a role in developmental regulation, but our knowledge of the underlying mechanisms that regulate alternative splicing are incomplete. Notably, a subset of small noncoding RNAs known as scaRNAs (small cajal body associated RNAs) contribute to spliceosome maturation and function through guiding covalent modification of spliceosomal RNAs with either methylation or pseudouridylation on specific nucleotides, but the developmental significance of these modifications is not well understood. Our focus is on one such scaRNA, known as SNORD94 or U94, that guides methylation on one specific cytosine (C62) on spliceosomal RNA U6, thus potentially altering spliceosome function during embryogenesis. We previously showed that in the myocardium of infants with heart defects, mRNA is alternatively spliced as compared to control tissues. We also demonstrated that alternatively spliced genes were concentrated in the pathways that control heart development. Furthermore, we showed that modifying expression of scaRNAs alters mRNA splicing in human cells, and zebrafish embryos. Here we present evidence that SNORD94 levels directly influence levels of methylation at its target region in U6, suggesting a potential mechanism for modifying alternative splicing of mRNA. The potential importance of scaRNAs as a developmentally important regulatory mechanism controlling alternative splicing of mRNA is unappreciated and needs more research."
https://openalex.org/W2994342484,"The seismic vibrator has become a main energy source for land seismic exploration. For a seismic vibrator, a piston is installed in the vertical direction in the reaction mass, and the reaction mass moves up and down along the piston. Because of vibrator dynamic disturbances in the reaction mass and baseplate system, the vibrator output force is contaminated by harmonic distortion. This distorted output force results in poor quality of seismic data. This paper studies the dynamics and disturbances of the piston as well as the reaction mass. The results show that the reaction mass disturbance is mainly caused by the horizontal oil flow inlet going to the reaction mass chamber. Precisely speaking, the ideal vertical motion of the reaction mass is disturbed by a combination of a reaction mass rotational motion along the piston and a bending motion of the piston. Changing the oil flow inlet from the horizontal direction to the vertical direction significantly reduces these disturbances. In the disturbance test of the vertical oil flow inlet, the disturbance of the reaction mass in XOZ and YOZ is reduced by 73.943% and 54.232%, respectively, and the disturbance of the vibrator is obviously weakened. The motion of the reaction mass is close to the ideal vertical direction. This change of the oil flow inlet direction further improves the accuracy and reliability of the vibrator output force."
