https://openalex.org/W2014988241,"Pancreatic cancers use a novel glutamine metabolism pathway, regulated by oncogenic KRAS, to maintain redox balance; these findings add to the understanding of the mechanisms by which oncogenic alterations reprogram cellular metabolism to promote tumour growth. Pancreatic tumours often carry activating KRAS mutations. This study describes a novel KRAS-regulated pathway that is critical to the metabolism of glutamine by human pancreatic cancer cells and is required for tumour growth. The pathway appears to maintain redox homeostasis but is dispensable in normal cells, providing a possible avenue for pursuing antitumour compounds that might act in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, an extremely aggressive cancer that is highly refractory to chemotherapy, radiation and targeted therapies. Cancer cells have metabolic dependencies that distinguish them from their normal counterparts1. Among these dependencies is an increased use of the amino acid glutamine to fuel anabolic processes2. Indeed, the spectrum of glutamine-dependent tumours and the mechanisms whereby glutamine supports cancer metabolism remain areas of active investigation. Here we report the identification of a non-canonical pathway of glutamine use in human pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) cells that is required for tumour growth. Whereas most cells use glutamate dehydrogenase (GLUD1) to convert glutamine-derived glutamate into α-ketoglutarate in the mitochondria to fuel the tricarboxylic acid cycle, PDAC relies on a distinct pathway in which glutamine-derived aspartate is transported into the cytoplasm where it can be converted into oxaloacetate by aspartate transaminase (GOT1). Subsequently, this oxaloacetate is converted into malate and then pyruvate, ostensibly increasing the NADPH/NADP+ ratio which can potentially maintain the cellular redox state. Importantly, PDAC cells are strongly dependent on this series of reactions, as glutamine deprivation or genetic inhibition of any enzyme in this pathway leads to an increase in reactive oxygen species and a reduction in reduced glutathione. Moreover, knockdown of any component enzyme in this series of reactions also results in a pronounced suppression of PDAC growth in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, we establish that the reprogramming of glutamine metabolism is mediated by oncogenic KRAS, the signature genetic alteration in PDAC, through the transcriptional upregulation and repression of key metabolic enzymes in this pathway. The essentiality of this pathway in PDAC and the fact that it is dispensable in normal cells may provide novel therapeutic approaches to treat these refractory tumours."

Common variants at 27 loci have been identified as associated with susceptibility to breast cancer, and these account for ∼9% of the familial risk of the disease. We report here a meta-analysis of 9 genome-wide association studies, including 10,052 breast cancer cases and 12,575 controls of European ancestry, from which we selected 29,807 SNPs for further genotyping. These SNPs were genotyped in 45,290 cases and 41,880 controls of European ancestry from 41 studies in the Breast Cancer Association Consortium (BCAC). The SNPs were genotyped as part of a collaborative genotyping experiment involving four consortia (Collaborative Oncological Gene-environment Study, COGS) and used a custom Illumina iSelect genotyping array, iCOGS, comprising more than 200,000 SNPs. We identified SNPs at 41 new breast cancer susceptibility loci at genome-wide significance (P < 5 × 10(-8)). Further analyses suggest that more than 1,000 additional loci are involved in breast cancer susceptibility."
https://openalex.org/W2024809912,"Interindividual variation in mean leukocyte telomere length (LTL) is associated with cancer and several age-associated diseases. We report here a genome-wide meta-analysis of 37,684 individuals with replication of selected variants in an additional 10,739 individuals. We identified seven loci, including five new loci, associated with mean LTL (P < 5 × 10(-8)). Five of the loci contain candidate genes (TERC, TERT, NAF1, OBFC1 and RTEL1) that are known to be involved in telomere biology. Lead SNPs at two loci (TERC and TERT) associate with several cancers and other diseases, including idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Moreover, a genetic risk score analysis combining lead variants at all 7 loci in 22,233 coronary artery disease cases and 64,762 controls showed an association of the alleles associated with shorter LTL with increased risk of coronary artery disease (21% (95% confidence interval, 5-35%) per standard deviation in LTL, P = 0.014). Our findings support a causal role of telomere-length variation in some age-related diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2093141907,"The genome sequence and its analysis of the diploid wild wheat Triticum urartu (progenitor of the wheat A genome) represent a tool for studying the complex, polyploid wheat genomes and should be a valuable resource for the genetic improvement of wheat. The hexaploid genome of bread wheat Triticum aestivum, designated AABBDD, evolved as a result of hybridization between three ancestral grasses. Two papers published in the issue of Nature present genome sequences and analysis of two of these wheat progenitors. First, the genome sequence of the diploid wild wheat T. urartu (ancestor of the A genome), which resembles cultivated wheat more strongly than either Aegilops speltoides (the B ancestor) or Ae. tauschii (the D donor). And second, the Ae. tauschii genome, together with an analysis of its transcriptome. These genomes and their analyses will be powerful tools for the study of complex, polyploid wheat genomes and a valuable resource for genetic improvement of wheat. Bread wheat (Triticum aestivum, AABBDD) is one of the most widely cultivated and consumed food crops in the world. However, the complex polyploid nature of its genome makes genetic and functional analyses extremely challenging. The A genome, as a basic genome of bread wheat and other polyploid wheats, for example, T. turgidum (AABB), T. timopheevii (AAGG) and T. zhukovskyi (AAGGAmAm), is central to wheat evolution, domestication and genetic improvement1. The progenitor species of the A genome is the diploid wild einkorn wheat T. urartu2, which resembles cultivated wheat more extensively than do Aegilops speltoides (the ancestor of the B genome3) and Ae. tauschii (the donor of the D genome4), especially in the morphology and development of spike and seed. Here we present the generation, assembly and analysis of a whole-genome shotgun draft sequence of the T. urartu genome. We identified protein-coding gene models, performed genome structure analyses and assessed its utility for analysing agronomically important genes and for developing molecular markers. Our T. urartu genome assembly provides a diploid reference for analysis of polyploid wheat genomes and is a valuable resource for the genetic improvement of wheat."
https://openalex.org/W2133857310,"Stig Bojesen, Georgia Chenevix-Trench, Alison Dunning and colleagues report common variants at the TERT-CLPTM1L locus associated with mean telomere length measured in whole blood. They also identify associations at this locus to breast or ovarian cancer susceptibility and report functional studies in breast and ovarian cancer tissue and cell lines. TERT-locus SNPs and leukocyte telomere measures are reportedly associated with risks of multiple cancers. Using the Illumina custom genotyping array iCOGs, we analyzed ∼480 SNPs at the TERT locus in breast (n = 103,991), ovarian (n = 39,774) and BRCA1 mutation carrier (n = 11,705) cancer cases and controls. Leukocyte telomere measurements were also available for 53,724 participants. Most associations cluster into three independent peaks. The minor allele at the peak 1 SNP rs2736108 associates with longer telomeres (P = 5.8 × 10−7), lower risks for estrogen receptor (ER)-negative (P = 1.0 × 10−8) and BRCA1 mutation carrier (P = 1.1 × 10−5) breast cancers and altered promoter assay signal. The minor allele at the peak 2 SNP rs7705526 associates with longer telomeres (P = 2.3 × 10−14), higher risk of low-malignant-potential ovarian cancer (P = 1.3 × 10−15) and greater promoter activity. The minor alleles at the peak 3 SNPs rs10069690 and rs2242652 increase ER-negative (P = 1.2 × 10−12) and BRCA1 mutation carrier (P = 1.6 × 10−14) breast and invasive ovarian (P = 1.3 × 10−11) cancer risks but not via altered telomere length. The cancer risk alleles of rs2242652 and rs10069690, respectively, increase silencing and generate a truncated TERT splice variant."

They identify 23 new prostate cancer susceptibility loci, 20 of which are associated with both aggressive and non-aggressive disease. Prostate cancer is the most frequently diagnosed cancer in males in developed countries. To identify common prostate cancer susceptibility alleles, we genotyped 211,155 SNPs on a custom Illumina array (iCOGS) in blood DNA from 25,074 prostate cancer cases and 24,272 controls from the international PRACTICAL Consortium. Twenty-three new prostate cancer susceptibility loci were identified at genome-wide significance (P < 5 × 10−8). More than 70 prostate cancer susceptibility loci, explaining ∼30% of the familial risk for this disease, have now been identified. On the basis of combined risks conferred by the new and previously known risk loci, the top 1% of the risk distribution has a 4.7-fold higher risk than the average of the population being profiled. These results will facilitate population risk stratification for clinical studies."

https://openalex.org/W2132559433,"Montserrat Garcia-Closas and colleagues report a meta-analysis of three genome-wide association studies for estrogen receptor (ER)-negative breast cancer, including 4,193 ER-negative breast cancer cases and 35,194 controls, with replication using the iCOGS custom genotyping array in 40 studies, including 6,514 cases and 41,455 controls. They identify four loci associated with ER-negative but not ER-positive breast cancer. Estrogen receptor (ER)-negative tumors represent 20–30% of all breast cancers, with a higher proportion occurring in younger women and women of African ancestry1. The etiology2 and clinical behavior3 of ER-negative tumors are different from those of tumors expressing ER (ER positive), including differences in genetic predisposition4. To identify susceptibility loci specific to ER-negative disease, we combined in a meta-analysis 3 genome-wide association studies of 4,193 ER-negative breast cancer cases and 35,194 controls with a series of 40 follow-up studies (6,514 cases and 41,455 controls), genotyped using a custom Illumina array, iCOGS, developed by the Collaborative Oncological Gene-environment Study (COGS). SNPs at four loci, 1q32.1 (MDM4, P = 2.1 × 10−12 and LGR6, P = 1.4 × 10−8), 2p24.1 (P = 4.6 × 10−8) and 16q12.2 (FTO, P = 4.0 × 10−8), were associated with ER-negative but not ER-positive breast cancer (P > 0.05). These findings provide further evidence for distinct etiological pathways associated with invasive ER-positive and ER-negative breast cancers."

They identify three new ovarian cancer susceptibility loci, including one specific to the serous subtype, and their integrated molecular analysis of genes and regulatory regions at these loci suggests disease mechanisms. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified four susceptibility loci for epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC), with another two suggestive loci reaching near genome-wide significance. We pooled data from a GWAS conducted in North America with another GWAS from the UK. We selected the top 24,551 SNPs for inclusion on the iCOGS custom genotyping array. We performed follow-up genotyping in 18,174 individuals with EOC (cases) and 26,134 controls from 43 studies from the Ovarian Cancer Association Consortium. We validated the two loci at 3q25 and 17q21 that were previously found to have associations close to genome-wide significance and identified three loci newly associated with risk: two loci associated with all EOC subtypes at 8q21 (rs11782652, P = 5.5 × 10−9) and 10p12 (rs1243180, P = 1.8 × 10−8) and another locus specific to the serous subtype at 17q12 (rs757210, P = 8.1 × 10−10). An integrated molecular analysis of genes and regulatory regions at these loci provided evidence for functional mechanisms underlying susceptibility and implicated CHMP4C in the pathogenesis of ovarian cancer."

https://openalex.org/W2017249589,"Nori, a marine red alga, is one of the most profitable mariculture crops in the world. However, the biological properties of this macroalga are poorly understood at the molecular level. In this study, we determined the draft genome sequence of susabi-nori (Pyropia yezoensis) using next-generation sequencing platforms. For sequencing, thalli of P. yezoensis were washed to remove bacteria attached on the cell surface and enzymatically prepared as purified protoplasts. The assembled contig size of the P. yezoensis nuclear genome was approximately 43 megabases (Mb), which is an order of magnitude smaller than the previously estimated genome size. A total of 10,327 gene models were predicted and about 60% of the genes validated lack introns and the other genes have shorter introns compared to large-genome algae, which is consistent with the compact size of the P. yezoensis genome. A sequence homology search showed that 3,611 genes (35%) are functionally unknown and only 2,069 gene groups are in common with those of the unicellular red alga, Cyanidioschyzon merolae. As color trait determinants of red algae, light-harvesting genes involved in the phycobilisome were predicted from the P. yezoensis nuclear genome. In particular, we found a second homolog of phycobilisome-degradation gene, which is usually chloroplast-encoded, possibly providing a novel target for color fading of susabi-nori in aquaculture. These findings shed light on unexplained features of macroalgal genes and genomes, and suggest that the genome of P. yezoensis is a promising model genome of marine red algae."
https://openalex.org/W2094243402,"Protein N-myristoylation is a 14-carbon fatty-acid modification that is conserved across eukaryotic species and occurs on nearly 1% of the cellular proteome. The ability of the myristoyl group to facilitate dynamic protein-protein and protein-membrane interactions (known as the myristoyl switch) makes it an essential feature of many signal transduction systems. Thus pathogenic strategies that facilitate protein demyristoylation would markedly alter the signalling landscape of infected host cells. Here we describe an irreversible mechanism of protein demyristoylation catalysed by invasion plasmid antigen J (IpaJ), a previously uncharacterized Shigella flexneri type III effector protein with cysteine protease activity. A yeast genetic screen for IpaJ substrates identified ADP-ribosylation factor (ARF)1p and ARF2p, small molecular mass GTPases that regulate cargo transport through the Golgi apparatus. Mass spectrometry showed that IpaJ cleaved the peptide bond between N-myristoylated glycine-2 and asparagine-3 of human ARF1, thereby providing a new mechanism for host secretory inhibition by a bacterial pathogen. We further demonstrate that IpaJ cleaves an array of N-myristoylated proteins involved in cellular growth, signal transduction, autophagasome maturation and organelle function. Taken together, these findings show a previously unrecognized pathogenic mechanism for the site-specific elimination of N-myristoyl protein modification."
https://openalex.org/W2153507803,"Neonatal seizures can be refractory to conventional anticonvulsants, and this may in part be due to a developmental increase in expression of the neuronal Na+-K+-2 Cl− cotransporter, NKCC1, and consequent paradoxical excitatory actions of GABAA receptors in the perinatal period. The most common cause of neonatal seizures is hypoxic encephalopathy, and here we show in an established model of neonatal hypoxia-induced seizures that the NKCC1 inhibitor, bumetanide, in combination with phenobarbital is significantly more effective than phenobarbital alone. A sensitive mass spectrometry assay revealed that bumetanide concentrations in serum and brain were dose-dependent, and the expression of NKCC1 protein transiently increased in cortex and hippocampus after hypoxic seizures. Importantly, the low doses of phenobarbital and bumetanide used in the study did not increase constitutive apoptosis, alone or in combination. Perforated patch clamp recordings from ex vivo hippocampal slices removed following seizures revealed that phenobarbital and bumetanide largely reversed seizure-induced changes in EGABA. Taken together, these data provide preclinical support for clinical trials of bumetanide in human neonates at risk for hypoxic encephalopathy and seizures."
https://openalex.org/W1999826501,"Human glioblastomas (GBM) are thought to be initiated by glioma stem-like cells (GSLCs). GSLCs also participate in tumor neovascularization by transdifferentiating into vascular endothelial cells. Here, we report a critical role of GSLCs in the formation of vasculogenic mimicry (VM), which defines channels lined by tumor cells to supply nutrients to early growing tumors and tumor initiation. GSLCs preferentially expressed vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 (VEGFR-2) that upon activation by VEGF, mediated chemotaxis, tubule formation and increased expression of critical VM markers by GSLCs. Knockdown of VEGFR-2 in GSLCs by shRNA markedly reduced their capacity of self-renewal, forming tubules, initiating xenograft tumors, promoting vascularization and the establishment of VM. Our study demonstrates VEGFR-2 as an essential molecule to sustain the “stemness” of GSLCs, their capacity to initiate tumor vasculature, and direct initiation of tumor."
https://openalex.org/W2014962014,"Cognitive impairments are prominent sequelae of prolonged continuous seizures (status epilepticus; SE) in humans and animal models. While often associated with dendritic injury, the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. The mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) pathway is hyperactivated following SE. This pathway modulates learning and memory and is associated with regulation of neuronal, dendritic, and glial properties. Thus, in the present study we tested the hypothesis that SE-induced mTORC1 hyperactivation is a candidate mechanism underlying cognitive deficits and dendritic pathology seen following SE. We examined the effects of rapamycin, an mTORC1 inhibitor, on the early hippocampal-dependent spatial learning and memory deficits associated with an episode of pilocarpine-induced SE. Rapamycin-treated SE rats performed significantly better than the vehicle-treated rats in two spatial memory tasks, the Morris water maze and the novel object recognition test. At the molecular level, we found that the SE-induced increase in mTORC1 signaling was localized in neurons and microglia. Rapamycin decreased the SE-induced mTOR activation and attenuated microgliosis which was mostly localized within the CA1 area. These findings paralleled a reversal of the SE-induced decreases in dendritic Map2 and ion channels levels as well as improved dendritic branching and spine density in area CA1 following rapamycin treatment. Taken together, these findings suggest that mTORC1 hyperactivity contributes to early hippocampal-dependent spatial learning and memory deficits and dendritic dysregulation associated with SE."
https://openalex.org/W2029587433,"Little is known about how bacteria sense or respond to reactive chlorine species, such as bleach.NemR is a redox-regulated transcription factor which senses bleach.NemR controls expression of genes encoding electrophile detoxification enzymes, which increase bleach resistance.We demonstrate a bleach-sensing bacterial response system and a new mechanism contributing to bacterial bleach survival. Hypochlorous acid (HOCl), the active component of household bleach, also functions as a powerful antimicrobial during the innate immune response. Despite its widespread use, surprisingly little is known about how cells sense or respond to HOCl. We now demonstrate that Escherichia coli NemR is a redox-regulated transcriptional repressor, which uses the oxidation status of HOCl-sensitive cysteine residues to respond to bleach and related reactive chlorine species. NemR controls bleach-mediated expression of two enzymes required for detoxification of reactive electrophiles: glyoxalase I and N-ethylmaleimide reductase. Both enzymes contribute to bacterial bleach survival. These results provide evidence that bleach resistance relies on the capacity of organisms to specifically sense reactive chlorine species and respond with the up-regulation of enzymes dedicated to detoxification of methylglyoxal and other reactive electrophiles."
https://openalex.org/W1978355068,"The relationships between facial mimicry and subsequent psychological processes remain unclear. We hypothesized that the congruent facial muscle activity would elicit emotional experiences and that the experienced emotion would induce emotion recognition.To test this hypothesis, we re-analyzed data collected in two previous studies. We recorded facial electromyography (EMG) from the corrugator supercilii and zygomatic major and obtained ratings on scales of valence and arousal for experienced emotions (Study 1) and for experienced and recognized emotions (Study 2) while participants viewed dynamic and static facial expressions of negative and positive emotions. Path analyses showed that the facial EMG activity consistently predicted the valence ratings for the emotions experienced in response to dynamic facial expressions. The experienced valence ratings in turn predicted the recognized valence ratings in Study 2.These results suggest that facial mimicry influences the sharing and recognition of emotional valence in response to others' dynamic facial expressions."
https://openalex.org/W2036676990,"Background Immune evasion is one of the recognized hallmarks of cancer. Inflammatory responses to cancer can also contribute directly to oncogenesis. Since the immune system is hardwired to protect the host, there is a possibility that cancers, regardless of their histological origins, endow themselves with a common and shared inflammatory cancer-associated molecular pattern (iCAMP) to promote oncoinflammation. However, the definition of iCAMP has not been conceptually and experimentally investigated. Methods and Findings Genome-wide cDNA expression data was analyzed for 221 normal and 324 cancer specimens from 7 cancer types: breast, prostate, lung, colon, gastric, oral and pancreatic. A total of 96 inflammatory genes with consistent dysregulation were identified, including 44 up-regulated and 52 down-regulated genes. Protein expression was confirmed by immunohistochemistry for some of these genes. The iCAMP contains proteins whose roles in cancer have been implicated and others which are yet to be appreciated. The clinical significance of many iCAMP genes was confirmed in multiple independent cohorts of colon and ovarian cancer patients. In both cases, better prognosis correlated strongly with high CXCL13 and low level of GREM1, LOX, TNFAIP6, CD36, and EDNRA. An “Inflammatory Gene Integrated Score” was further developed from the combination of 18 iCAMP genes in ovarian cancer, which predicted overall survival. Noticeably, as a selective nuclear import protein whose immuno-regulatory function just begins to emerge, karyopherin alpha 2 (KPNA2) is uniformly up-regulated across cancer types. For the first time, the cancer-specific up-regulation of KPNA2 and its clinical significance were verified by tissue microarray analysis in colon and head-neck cancers. Conclusion This work defines an inflammatory signature shared by seven epithelial cancer types and KPNA2 as a consistently up-regulated protein in cancer. Identification of iCAMP may not only serve as a novel biomarker for prognostication and individualized treatment of cancer, but also have significant biological implications."
https://openalex.org/W2031341823,"Antihypertensive drugs are among the most commonly prescribed drugs for chronic disease worldwide. The response to antihypertensive drugs varies substantially between individuals and important factors such as race that contribute to this heterogeneity are poorly understood. In this study we use metabolomics, a global biochemical approach to investigate biochemical changes induced by the beta-adrenergic receptor blocker atenolol in Caucasians and African Americans. Plasma from individuals treated with atenolol was collected at baseline (untreated) and after a 9 week treatment period and analyzed using a GC-TOF metabolomics platform. The metabolomic signature of atenolol exposure included saturated (palmitic), monounsaturated (oleic, palmitoleic) and polyunsaturated (arachidonic, linoleic) free fatty acids, which decreased in Caucasians after treatment but were not different in African Americans (p<0.0005, q<0.03). Similarly, the ketone body 3-hydroxybutyrate was significantly decreased in Caucasians by 33% (p<0.0001, q<0.0001) but was unchanged in African Americans. The contribution of genetic variation in genes that encode lipases to the racial differences in atenolol-induced changes in fatty acids was examined. SNP rs9652472 in LIPC was found to be associated with the change in oleic acid in Caucasians (p<0.0005) but not African Americans, whereas the PLA2G4C SNP rs7250148 associated with oleic acid change in African Americans (p<0.0001) but not Caucasians. Together, these data indicate that atenolol-induced changes in the metabolome are dependent on race and genotype. This study represents a first step of a pharmacometabolomic approach to phenotype patients with hypertension and gain mechanistic insights into racial variability in changes that occur with atenolol treatment, which may influence response to the drug."

https://openalex.org/W2069100609,"Background Microbial communities in floral nectar have been shown to be characterized by low levels of species diversity, yet little is known about among-plant population variation in microbial community composition. Methodology/Principal Findings We investigated the microbial community structure (yeasts and bacteria) in floral nectar of ten fragmented populations of the bee-pollinated forest herb Pulmonaria officinalis. We also explored possible relationships between plant population size and microbial diversity in nectar, and related microbial community composition to the distance separating plant populations. Culturable bacteria and yeasts occurring in the floral nectar of a total of 100 plant individuals were isolated and identified by partially sequencing the 16S rRNA gene and D1/D2 domains of the 26S rRNA gene, respectively. A total of 9 and 11 yeast and 28 and 39 bacterial OTUs was found, taking into account a 3% (OTU0.03) and 1% sequence dissimilarity cut-off (OTU0.01). OTU richness at the plant population level (i.e. the number of OTUs per population) was low for yeasts (mean: 1.7, range: 0–4 OTUs0.01/0.03 per population), whereas on average 6.9 (range: 2–13) OTUs0.03 and 7.9 (range 2–16) OTUs0.01 per population were found for bacteria. Both for yeasts and bacteria, OTU richness was not significantly related to plant population size. Similarity in community composition among populations was low (average Jaccard index: 0.14), and did not decline with increasing distance between populations. Conclusions/Significance We found low similarity in microbial community structure among populations, suggesting that the assembly of nectar microbiota is to a large extent context-dependent. Although the precise factors that affect variation in microbial community structure in floral nectar require further study, our results indicate that both local and regional processes may contribute to among-population variation in microbial community structure in nectar."
https://openalex.org/W2162132726,"Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most frequent inherited form of human mental retardation. It is characterized by cognitive impairment and physical and behavioral problems and is caused by the silencing of fmr1 transcription and the absence of the fmr1 protein (FMRP). Recently, animal models of FXS have greatly facilitated the investigation of the molecular and cellular mechanisms of this loss-of-function disorder. The present study was aimed to further characterize the role of FMRP in behavior and synaptic function by using fmr1 knockout zebrafish. In adult zebrafish, we found that fmr1 knockout produces the anxiolytic-like responses of increased exploratory behavior in light/dark and open-field tests and avoidance learning impairment. Furthermore, electrophysiological recordings from telencephalic slice preparations of knockout fish displayed markedly reduced long-term potentiation and enhanced long-term depression compared to wild-type fish; however, basal glutamatergic transmission and presynaptic function at the lateral (Dl) and medial (Dm) division of the dorsal telencephalon synapse remained normal. Taken together, our study not only evaluates the mechanism of FRMP but also suggests that zebrafish have valuable potential as a complementary vertebrate model in studying the molecular pathogenesis of human fragile X syndrome."
https://openalex.org/W2009725995,"The mechanisms underlying rapamycin-induced Akt phosphorylation have not been fully elucidated.Inhibition of PP2A or DNA-PK attenuates or abrogates rapamycin-induced Akt phosphorylation and co-inhibition of mTOR and DNA-PK enhances anticancer activity.PP2A-dependent and DNA-PK-mediated mechanism is involved in rapamycin-induced Akt phosphorylation.A previously unknown mechanism underlying rapamycin-induced Akt phosphorylation and a novel strategy to enhance mTOR-targeted cancer therapy may be suggested. Inhibition of mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1), for example with rapamycin, increases Akt phosphorylation while inhibiting mTORC1 signaling. However, the underlying mechanisms have not been fully elucidated. The current study has uncovered a previously unknown mechanism underlying rapamycin-induced Akt phosphorylation involving protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A)-dependent DNA protein kinase (DNA-PK) activation. In several cancer cell lines, inhibition of PP2A with okadaic acid, fostriecin, small T antigen, or PP2A knockdown abrogated rapamycin-induced Akt phosphorylation, and rapamycin increased PP2A activity. Chemical inhibition of DNA-PK, knockdown or deficiency of DNA-PK catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs), or knock-out of the DNA-PK component Ku86 inhibited rapamycin-induced Akt phosphorylation. Exposure of cancer cells to rapamycin increased DNA-PK activity, and gene silencing-mediated PP2A inhibition attenuated rapamycin-induced DNA-PK activity. Collectively these results suggest that rapamycin induces PP2A-dependent and DNA-PK-mediated Akt phosphorylation. Accordingly, simultaneous inhibition of mTOR and DNA-PK did not stimulate Akt activity and synergistically inhibited the growth of cancer cells both in vitro and in vivo. Thus, our findings also suggest a novel strategy to enhance mTOR-targeted cancer therapy by co-targeting DNA-PK."
https://openalex.org/W2013528479,"Purpose To evaluate the effects of aerobic (AER) or aerobic plus resistance exercise (COMB) sessions on glucose levels and glucose variability in patients with type 2 diabetes. Additionally, we assessed conventional and non-conventional methods to analyze glucose variability derived from multiple measurements performed with continuous glucose monitoring system (CGMS). Methods Fourteen patients with type 2 diabetes (56±2 years) wore a CGMS during 3 days. Participants randomly performed AER and COMB sessions, both in the morning (24 h after CGMS placement), and at least 7 days apart. Glucose variability was evaluated by glucose standard deviation, glucose variance, mean amplitude of glycemic excursions (MAGE), and glucose coefficient of variation (conventional methods) as well as by spectral and symbolic analysis (non-conventional methods). Results Baseline fasting glycemia was 139±05 mg/dL and HbA1c 7.9±0.7%. Glucose levels decreased immediately after AER and COMB protocols by ∼16%, which was sustained for approximately 3 hours. Comparing the two exercise modalities, responses over a 24-h period after the sessions were similar for glucose levels, glucose variance and glucose coefficient of variation. In the symbolic analysis, increases in 0 V pattern (COMB, 67.0±7.1 vs. 76.0±6.3, P = 0.003) and decreases in 1 V pattern (COMB, 29.1±5.3 vs. 21.5±5.1, P = 0.004) were observed only after the COMB session. Conclusions Both AER and COMB exercise modalities reduce glucose levels similarly for a short period of time. The use of non-conventional analysis indicates reduction of glucose variability after a single session of combined exercises.

https://openalex.org/W1971888755,"During chromosome replication, coupled polymerases introduce topological changes that cause lower processivity and transient lagging-strand polymerase dissociation from DNA. The coupled leading- and lagging-strand polymerase complexes (replisomes) that drive chromosome replication in phage and bacteria introduce a topological problem that must be resolved. One solution would be the release of the lagging-strand polymerase from the Okazaki fragment; this model proposes that a protein such as primase would trigger release. Mike O'Donnell and colleagues show now that there is no such signal. Rather, the lagging-strand polymerase, when present within a tethered replisome, has reduced processivity that accounts for its periodic dissociation. In this model, signal release is caused by DNA topology possibly resulting from superhelical tension in the newly synthesized DNA. Chromosomal replication machines contain coupled DNA polymerases that simultaneously replicate the leading and lagging strands1. However, coupled replication presents a largely unrecognized topological problem. Because DNA polymerase must travel a helical path during synthesis, the physical connection between leading- and lagging-strand polymerases causes the daughter strands to entwine, or produces extensive build-up of negative supercoils in the newly synthesized DNA2,3,4. How DNA polymerases maintain their connection during coupled replication despite these topological challenges is unknown. Here we examine the dynamics of the Escherichia coli replisome, using ensemble and single-molecule methods, and show that the replisome may solve the topological problem independent of topoisomerases. We find that the lagging-strand polymerase frequently releases from an Okazaki fragment before completion, leaving single-strand gaps behind. Dissociation of the polymerase does not result in loss from the replisome because of its contact with the leading-strand polymerase. This behaviour, referred to as ‘signal release’, had been thought to require a protein, possibly primase, to pry polymerase from incompletely extended DNA fragments5,6,7. However, we observe that signal release is independent of primase and does not seem to require a protein trigger at all. Instead, the lagging-strand polymerase is simply less processive in the context of a replisome. Interestingly, when the lagging-strand polymerase is supplied with primed DNA in trans, uncoupling it from the fork, high processivity is restored. Hence, we propose that coupled polymerases introduce topological changes, possibly by accumulation of superhelical tension in the newly synthesized DNA, that cause lower processivity and transient lagging-strand polymerase dissociation from DNA."

In this study, we inserted into a replication defective PanAd3 a transgene expressing a fusion protein of conserved influenza antigens nucleoprotein (NP) and matrix 1 (M1). We then studied antibody and T cell responses as well as protection from challenge infection in a mouse model. A single intranasal administration of PanAd3-NPM1 vaccine induced strong antibody and T cell responses, and protected against high dose lethal influenza virus challenge. Thus PanAd3 is a promising candidate vector for vaccines, including universal influenza vaccines."
https://openalex.org/W2082818461,"Fusarium crown rot (FCR), caused by various Fusarium species, is a destructive disease of cereal crops in semiarid regions worldwide. As part of our contribution to the development of Fusarium resistant cultivars, we identified several novel sources of resistance by systematically assessing barley genotypes representing different geographical origins and plant types. One of these sources of resistance was investigated in this study by generating and analysing two populations of recombinant inbred lines. A major locus conferring FCR resistance, designated as Qcrs.cpi-4H, was detected in one of the populations (mapping population) and the effects of the QTL was confirmed in the other population. The QTL was mapped to the distal end of chromosome arm 4HL and it is effective against both of the Fusarium isolates tested, one F. pseudograminearum and the other F. graminearum. The QTL explains up to 45.3% of the phenotypic variance. As distinct from an earlier report which demonstrated co-locations of loci conferring FCR resistance and plant height in barley, a correlation between these two traits was not detected in the mapping population. However, as observed in a screen of random genotypes, an association between FCR resistance and plant growth rate was detected and a QTL controlling the latter was detected near the Qcrs.cpi-4H locus in the mapping population. Existing data indicate that, although growth rate may affect FCR resistance, different genes at this locus are likely involved in controlling these two traits."
https://openalex.org/W2058767625,"Inflammation and fibrosis are intertwined in multiple disease processes. We have previously found that over-expression of urokinase plasminogen activator in macrophages induces spontaneous macrophage accumulation and fibrosis specific to the heart in mice. Understanding the relationship between inflammation and fibrosis in the heart is critical to developing therapies for diverse myocardial diseases. Therefore, we sought to determine if uPA induces changes in macrophage function that promote cardiac collagen accumulation.We analyzed the effect of the uPA transgene on expression of pro-inflammatory (M1) and pro-fibrotic (M2) genes and proteins in hearts and isolated macrophages of uPA overexpressing mice. We found that although there was elevation of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-6 in hearts of transgenic mice, IL-6 is not a major effector of uPA induced cardiac fibrosis. However, uPA expressing bone marrow-derived macrophages are polarized to express M2 genes in response to IL-4 stimulation, and these M2 genes are upregulated in uPA expressing macrophages following migration to the heart. In addition, while uPA expressing macrophages express a transcriptional profile that is seen in tumor-associated macrophages, these macrophages promote collagen expression in cardiac but not embryonic fibroblasts.Urokinase plasminogen activator induces an M2/profibrotic phenotype in macrophages that is fully expressed after migration of macrophages into the heart. Understanding the mechanisms by which uPA modulates macrophage function may reveal insights into diverse pathologic processes."
https://openalex.org/W2153682492,"Although ovarian cancer is often initially chemotherapy-sensitive, the vast majority of tumors eventually relapse and patients die of increasingly aggressive disease. Cancer stem cells are believed to have properties that allow them to survive therapy and may drive recurrent tumor growth. Cancer stem cells or cancer-initiating cells are a rare cell population and difficult to isolate experimentally. Genes that are expressed by stem cells may characterize a subset of less differentiated tumors and aid in prognostic classification of ovarian cancer. The purpose of this study was the genomic identification and characterization of a subtype of ovarian cancer that has stem cell-like gene expression. Using human and mouse gene signatures of embryonic, adult, or cancer stem cells, we performed an unsupervised bipartition class discovery on expression profiles from 145 serous ovarian tumors to identify a stem-like and more differentiated subgroup. Subtypes were reproducible and were further characterized in four independent, heterogeneous ovarian cancer datasets. We identified a stem-like subtype characterized by a 51-gene signature, which is significantly enriched in tumors with properties of Type II ovarian cancer; high grade, serous tumors, and poor survival. Conversely, the differentiated tumors share properties with Type I, including lower grade and mixed histological subtypes. The stem cell-like signature was prognostic within high-stage serous ovarian cancer, classifying a small subset of high-stage tumors with better prognosis, in the differentiated subtype. In multivariate models that adjusted for common clinical factors (including grade, stage, age), the subtype classification was still a significant predictor of relapse. The prognostic stem-like gene signature yields new insights into prognostic differences in ovarian cancer, provides a genomic context for defining Type I/II subtypes, and potential gene targets which following further validation may be valuable in the clinical management or treatment of ovarian cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2037510579,"Background The aim of this study was to investigate the molecular mechanisms involved in the production of Th1 cytokines, namely IL-12 and IL-27, when the intra-macrophage redox state was altered by different chemical entities such as GSH-C4, which is reduced glutathione carrying an aliphatic chain, or I-152, a pro-drug of N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC) and beta-mercaptoethylamine. We had already demonstrated that GSH-C4 and I-152 could shift the immune response towards Th1 in Ovalbumin-immunized mice as well as enhance Th1 response in HIV-1 Tat-immunized mice. Methodology/Principal Findings By a new high performance liquid chromatography method, we found that 20 mM GSH-C4 provided a number of thiol species in the form of GSH, while 20 mM I-152 decreased GSH and increased the thiols in the form of NAC and I-152. Under these experimental conditions, GSH-C4 and I-152 enhanced and suppressed respectively the mRNA expression levels of IL-12 p40 induced by LPS/IFN-γ as assessed by Real-Time PCR. The protein production of IL-12 p40 was increased by GSH-C4 and decreased by I-152 as determined by Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Western immunoblot and electrophoretic mobility shift assays revealed that Nuclear Factor -kB (NF-kB) activation was inhibited by I-152 and prolonged by GSH-C4. Twenty mM I-152 stimulated IL-27 p28 gene expression and sustained Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription (STAT)-mediated interferon regulator factor 1 (IRF-1) de novo synthesis. By contrast, 20 mM GSH-C4 did not exert any effect on IL-27 p28 gene expression. Conclusions and Significance an increase in the intra-macrophage redox state by GSH-C4 and I-152 enhances Th1 cytokine production although the chemical structure and the intra-cellular metabolism influence differently signalling pathways involved in IL-27 or IL-12 production. GSH-C4 and I-152 may be used as Th1 immunomodulators in some pathologies and in ageing where GSH depletion may contribute to the Th1/Th2 imbalance, and in new immunization strategies."
https://openalex.org/W2080360554,"CXCL4L1 is a highly potent anti-angiogenic and anti-tumor chemokine, and its structural information is unknown.CXCL4L1 x-ray structure is determined, and it reveals a previously unrecognized chemokine structure adopting a novel C-terminal helix conformation.The alternative helix conformation enhances the anti-angiogenic activity of CXCL4L1 by reducing the glycosaminoglycan binding ability.Chemokine C-terminal helix orientation is critical in regulating their functions. Chemokines, a subfamily of cytokines, are small, secreted proteins that mediate a variety of biological processes. Various chemokines adopt remarkable conserved tertiary structure comprising an anti-parallel β-sheet core domain followed by a C-terminal helix that packs onto the β-sheet. The conserved structural feature has been considered critical for chemokine function, including binding to cell surface receptor. The recently isolated variant, CXCL4L1, is a homologue of CXCL4 chemokine (or platelet factor 4) with potent anti-angiogenic activity and differed only in three amino acid residues of P58L, K66E, and L67H. In this study we show by x-ray structural determination that CXCL4L1 adopts a previously unrecognized structure at its C terminus. The orientation of the C-terminal helix protrudes into the aqueous space to expose the entire helix. The alternative helix orientation modifies the overall chemokine shape and surface properties. The L67H mutation is mainly responsible for the swing-out effect of the helix, whereas mutations of P58L and K66E only act secondarily. This is the first observation that reports an open conformation of the C-terminal helix in a chemokine. This change leads to a decrease of its glycosaminoglycan binding properties and to an enhancement of its anti-angiogenic and anti-tumor effects. This unique structure is recent in evolution and has allowed CXCL4L1 to gain novel functional properties."
https://openalex.org/W2004913096,"It is unclear how DNA-damaging agents target cancer cells over normal somatic cells.Arf/p53-dependent down-regulation of H2AX enables normal cells to survive after DNA damage.Transformed cells, which harbor mutations in either Arf or p53, are more sensitive to DNA-damaging agents.Cellular transformation renders cells more susceptible to some DNA-damaging agents. Anti-cancer drugs generally target cancer cells rather than normal somatic cells. However, the factors that determine this differential sensitivity are poorly understood. Here we show that Arf/p53-dependent down-regulation of H2AX induced the selective survival of normal cells after drug treatment, resulting in the preferential targeting of cancer cells. Treatment with camptothecin, a topoisomerase I inhibitor, caused normal cells to down-regulate H2AX and become quiescent, a process mediated by both Arf and p53. In contrast, transformed cells that harbor mutations in either Arf or p53 do not down-regulate H2AX and are more sensitive to drugs unless they have developed drug resistance. Such transformation-associated changes in H2AX expression rendered cancer cells more susceptible to drug-induced damage (by two orders of magnitude). Thus, the expression of H2AX and γH2AX (phosphorylated form of H2AX at Ser-139) is a critical factor that determines drug sensitivity and should be considered when administering chemotherapy."

The primers used for PCR amplification of the mouse Nur77 promoter region were 5′-CTGCGGGCACGGATTTACAACACC-3′ and 5′-GGCGAGCCCGACCCACATCTT-5′. Behavioral analysis was carried out by utilizing the computer-assisted beam break, MicroMax system (Accuscan, Columbia, OH). Animals were monitored for a 24 h at 8 weeks of age as described (38Hayley S. Crocker S.J. Smith P.D. Shree T. Jackson-Lewis V. Przedborski S. Mount M. Slack R. Anisman H. Park D.S.

Histochemical and monoamine data analysis was carried out using one-way ANOVA, followed by a Newman-Keuls post hoc test. Our previous evidence indicated that loss of MEF2 activity, mediated by CDK5, was critical for dopaminergic loss induced by MPTP in vivo (7Smith P.D. Mount M.P. Shree R. Callaghan S. Slack R.S.

Several reports suggested Nur77 as a candidate for MEF2 regulation (17Liu W. Youn H.D. Liu J.O. Thapsigargin-induced apoptosis involves Cabin1-MEF2-mediated induction of Nur77.Eur. J.

Therefore, we initially ascertained whether loss of Nur77 expression could be detected in normal WT animals with MPTP treatment. We first assessed the levels of Nur77 transcripts from nigral extracts from an MPTP time course by quantitative real-time PCR.

However, employing quantitative real-time PCR, we observed a dramatic loss of Nur77 transcript expression in comparison with basal levels at 6 h to 7 days post initial MPTP treatment, ranging from a 44 to 80% reduction in Nur77 mRNA (Fig. 1A). These results were corroborated via in situ hybridization analysis in the dorsolateral and ventrolateral striatum (Fig. 1, B–D). We next assessed whether MEF2D binding on the endogenous Nur77 promoter may be affected by conditions that lead to neuronal loss using ChIP analysis.

The evaluation of the effect of an acute intervention on endothelial response is only valid if the measurement does not change significantly in the short term under normal conditions. Using 3.0 Tesla (T) MRI, we non-invasively compared two coronary artery endothelial function measurements separated by a ten minute interval in healthy subjects and patients with coronary artery disease (CAD).Twenty healthy adult subjects and 12 CAD patients were studied on a commercial 3.0 T whole-body MR imaging system. Coronary cross-sectional area (CSA), peak diastolic coronary flow velocity (PDFV) and blood-flow were quantified before and during continuous IHG stress, an endothelial-dependent stressor. The IHG exercise with imaging was repeated after a 10 minute recovery period.In healthy adults, coronary artery CSA changes and blood-flow increases did not differ between the first and second stresses (mean % change ±SEM, first vs. second stress CSA: 14.8%±3.3% vs. 17.8%±3.6%, p = 0.24; PDFV: 27.5%±4.9% vs. 24.2%±4.5%, p = 0.54; blood-flow: 44.3%±8.3 vs. 44.8%±8.1, p = 0.84). The coronary vasoreactive responses in the CAD patients also did not differ between the first and second stresses (mean % change ±SEM, first stress vs. second stress: CSA: -6.4%±2.0% vs. -5.0%±2.4%, p = 0.22; PDFV: -4.0%±4.6% vs. -4.2%±5.3%, p = 0.83; blood-flow: -9.7%±5.1% vs. -8.7%±6.3%, p = 0.38).MRI measures of CorEndoFx are unchanged during repeated isometric handgrip exercise tests in CAD patients and healthy adults. These findings demonstrate the repeatability of noninvasive 3T MRI assessment of CorEndoFx and support its use in future studies designed to determine the effects of acute interventions on coronary vasoreactivity."

Our study setting consisted of 24 houses, 12 subjected to two rounds of ITF and 12 kept as control. During 15 months (April 2010– June 2011) we monitored sand fly species composition and abundance with modified HP light traps inside (domicile) and outside (peridomicile) the studied houses. From 5628 sand flies collected, we were able to identify 5617 of the samples into 24 species, a number of species close to 25±1.6, the estimate from the Chao2 Index. The most abundant species were Lutzomya trapidoi (20%), Lu. gomezi (20%) and Lu. triramula (20%). Cluster analyses showed that most of the 24 houses had high similarity in relative abundance patterns of the six most common species, with only few peripheral houses not following the main cluster pattern. We also found that species richness was decreased to 22 species in the fogged houses, of which only 19 were found in the domiciliary environment. Changes in species richness were especially notorious at the end of the wet season. Our results suggest that species richness can decrease following ITF in domiciliary environments, primarily affecting the less common species."
https://openalex.org/W2067448271,"Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), the phenotypical change of cells from an epithelial to a mesenchymal type, is thought to be a key event in invasion and metastasis of adenocarcinomas. These changes involve loss of keratin expression as well as loss of cell polarity and adhesion. We here aimed to determine whether the loss of keratin expression itself drives increased invasion and metastasis in adenocarcinomas and whether keratin loss leads to the phenotypic changes associated with EMT. Therefore, we employed a recently described murine model in which conditional deletion of the Keratin cluster II by Cre-recombinase leads to the loss of the entire keratinmultiprotein family. These mice were crossed into a newly generated Cre-recombinase inducible KRAS-driven murine lung cancer model to examine the effect of keratin loss on morphology, invasion and metastasis as well as expression of EMT related genes in the resulting tumors. We here clearly show that loss of a functional keratin cytoskeleton did not significantly alter tumor morphology or biology in terms of invasion, metastasis, proliferation or tumor burden and did not lead to induction of EMT. Further, tumor cells did not induce synchronously expression of vimentin, which is often seen in EMT, to compensate for keratin loss. In summary, our data suggest that changes in cell shape and migration that underlie EMT are dependent on changes in signaling pathways that cause secondary changes in keratin expression and organization. Thus, we conclude that loss of the keratin cytoskeleton per se is not sufficient to causally drive EMT in this tumor model."

Replacement of Phe960 at the correct helical position depolarizes activation.Radial tuning of the activation gate is critical to the activation of NaV1.7 channel.Structural modeling guided electrophysiology reveals the functional importance of radial tuning of the S6 segment. Voltage-gated sodium (NaV) channels are membrane proteins that consist of 24 transmembrane segments organized into four homologous domains and are essential for action potential generation and propagation. Although the S6 helices of NaV channels line the ion-conducting pore and participate in channel activation, their functional architecture is incompletely understood. Our recent studies show that a naturally occurring in-frame deletion mutation (Del-L955) of NaV1.7 channel, identified in individuals with a severe inherited pain syndrome (inherited erythromelalgia) causes a substantial hyperpolarizing shift of channel activation. Here we took advantage of this deletion mutation to understand the role of the S6 helix in the channel activation. Based on the recently published structure of a bacterial NaV channel (NaVAb), we modeled the WT and Del-L955 channel. Our structural model showed that Del-L955 twists the DII/S6 helix, shifting location and radial orientation of the activation gate residue (Phe(960)). Hypothesizing that these structural changes produce the shift of channel activation of Del-L955 channels, we restored a phenylalanine in wild-type orientation by mutating Ser(961) (Del-L955/S961F), correcting activation by ∼10 mV. Correction of the displaced Phe(960) (F960S) together with introduction of the rescuing activation gate residue (S961F) produced an additional ∼6-mV restoration of activation of the mutant channel. A simple point mutation in the absence of a twist (L955A) did not produce a radial shift and did not hyperpolarize activation. Our results demonstrate the functional importance of radial tuning of the sodium channel S6 helix for the channel activation."
https://openalex.org/W2054840507,"Keratinocytes are the major building blocks of the human epidermis. In many physiological and pathophysiological conditions, keratinocytes release adenosine triphosphate (ATP) as an autocrine/paracrine mediator that regulates cell proliferation, differentiation, and migration. ATP receptors have been identified in various epidermal cell types; therefore, extracellular ATP homeostasis likely determines its long-term, trophic effects on skin health. We investigated the possibility that human keratinocytes express surface-located enzymes that modulate ATP concentration, as well as the corresponding receptor activation, in the pericellular microenvironment. We observed that the human keratinocyte cell line HaCaT released ATP and hydrolyzed extracellular ATP. Interestingly, ATP hydrolysis resulted in adenosine diphosphate (ADP) accumulation in the extracellular space. Pharmacological inhibition by ARL 67156 or gene silencing of the endogenous ecto-nucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolase (NTPDase) isoform 2 resulted in a 25% reduction in both ATP hydrolysis and ADP formation. Using intracellular calcium as a reporter, we found that although NTPDase2 hydrolyzed ATP and generated sustainable ADP levels, only ATP contributed to increased intracellular calcium via P2Y2 receptor activation. Furthermore, knocking down NTPDase2 potentiated the nanomolar ATP-induced intracellular calcium increase, suggesting that NTPDase2 globally attenuates nucleotide concentration in the pericellular microenvironment as well as locally shields receptors in the vicinity from being activated by extracellular ATP. Our findings reveal an important role of human keratinocyte NTPDase2 in modulating nucleotide signaling in the extracellular milieu of human epidermis."

Here we show that KChIP2, which is abundantly expressed in hippocampal pyramidal cells, is essential for IA regulation in hippocampal neurons and that deletion of Kchip2 affects susceptibility to limbic seizures. The specific effects of Kchip2 deletion on IA recorded from isolated hippocampal pyramidal neurons were a reduction in amplitude and shift in the V½ for steady-state inactivation to hyperpolarized potentials when compared with WT neurons. Consistent with the relative loss of IA, hippocampal neurons from Kchip2−/− mice showed increased excitability. WT cultured neurons fired only occasional single action potentials, but the average spontaneous firing rate (spikes/s) was almost 10-fold greater in Kchip2−/− neurons. In slice preparations, spontaneous firing was detected in CA1 pyramidal neurons from Kchip2−/− mice but not from WT. Additionally, when seizures were induced by kindling, the number of stimulations required to evoke an initial class 4 or 5 seizure was decreased, and the average duration of electrographic seizures was longer in Kchip2−/− mice compared with WT controls.

Kv4 α subunits, the major targets of KChIP2, are pore-forming subunits of the neuronal somatodendritic A-type K current (IA). IA regulates neuronal activity mainly through effects on excitatory postsynaptic potentials and back-propagated action potentials (3Hoffman D.A. Magee J.C. Colbert C.M. Johnston D.

By severely dampening dendritic excitability, IA influences dendritic integration and propagation of information and modulates the input and output relationship of electrical signals.

Whether any one KChIP plays a distinctive and essential role in IA regulation or whether there is functional redundancy among the KChIPs is not known. Knock-out of KChIP2 or KChIP3 is associated with compensatory up-regulation of other KChIPs in posterior cortical neurons. IA density was unaffected by KChIP2 knock-out but mildly reduced by KChIP3 knock-out regardless of the expression levels of other KChIPs (10Norris A.J. Foeger N.C. Nerbonne J.M. Interdependent roles for accessory KChIP2, KChIP3, and KChIP4 subunits in the generation of Kv4-encoded IA channels in cortical pyramidal neurons.J. Neurosci. 2010; 30: 13644-13655Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). This suggests that KChIP3 may have a more prominent role in posterior neurons. Distinctive roles in IA regulation for individual KChIPs in other areas have not been tested, however, and not all neurons may be capable of the same compensatory changes present in posterior cortical neurons. Specifically, whether the absence of KChIP2 affects function of neurons outside of the posterior cortex or has physiological effects has not been reported. Here, we investigated the role of KChIP2 in hippocampal neurons and in epilepsy. We focused specifically on hippocampal neurons because KChIP2 is concentrated in their apical and basal dendrites, where it co-localizes with Kv4.2 (11Rhodes K.J. Carroll K.I. Sung M.A. Doliveira L.C. Monaghan M.M. Burke S.L. Strassle B.W. Buchwalder L. Menegola M. Cao J. An W.F. Trimmer J.S.

Neurosci. 2004; 24: 7903-7915Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar), yet the effect of KChIP2 deletion on IA in hippocampal neurons has not been investigated. We also evaluated the physiological consequences of KChIP2 deletion, considering the hypothesis that an effect on IA might influence the development of limbic seizures because of the importance of the hippocampus in networks involving limbic seizures. The generation of Kchip2+/− mice was previously described (12Kuo H.C. Cheng C.F. Clark R.B. Lin J.J. Lin J.L. Hoshijima M. Nguyêñ-Trân V.T. Gu Y. Ikeda Y. Chu P.H. Ross J. Giles W.R. Chien K.R.

Heterozygotes were bred to generate WT or Kchip2−/− animals, which were then maintained as separate lines. WT and Kchip2−/− mice used for the experiments in this report have the identical genetic background, and any differences in responses between WT and Kchip2−/− mice to the kindling induced seizures are background-independent. Adult (male, 7–10 months) and 5–6-week-old (male and female) WT and Kchip2−/− mice were used for kindling and brain slice experiments, respectively. Dissociated hippocampal neuron cultures were obtained from newborn (postnatal days 1 and 2) pups. The animals were handled according to National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. The study was approved by Duke University and Durham Veterans Affairs Medical Center Animal Care and Welfare Committees. Procedures for surgery and kindling were performed as described previously (14He X.P. Kotloski R. Nef S. Luikart B.W. Parada L.F. McNamara J.O.

Briefly, under pentobarbital (60 mg/kg) anesthesia, a bipolar electrode used for stimulation and recording was stereotactically implanted in the right amygdala. Following a postoperative recovery period of ∼1 week, the electrographic seizure threshold in the amygdala was determined, and stimulations at the intensity of the electrographic seizure threshold were subsequently administered twice daily, 5 days per week. Electroencephalographic and behavioral manifestations of seizures were classified according to a modification of the description of Racine (16Racine R.J.

The mice were stimulated until fully kindled as defined by the occurrence of three consecutive seizures of class 4 or greater. Unstimulated control animals of each genotype underwent surgical implantation of an electrode in amygdala and were handled identically but were not stimulated. Accuracy of electrode placement was verified by histological analysis, and only animals with correct electrode placement in the amygdala were included in the statistical analysis for kindling experiment. Hippocampi from 1–2-day newborn WT and Kchip2−/− mice were dissociated through enzymatic treatment with 0.25% trypsin and subsequent trituration. The cells were plated on glass coverslips previously coated with poly-d-lysine and laminin in 12-well cell culture plate in the density of 100,000/ml. Hippocampal cells were grown in neurobasal A medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 2% B27, 2 mm glutamine, 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin in 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C overnight, and then this medium was replaced by one containing 2% B27, 0.5 mm glutamine, 1% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 70 μm uridine, and 25 μm 5-fluorodeoxyuridine. Electrophysiological recordings were performed at room temperature. Inhibitory and excitatory synapses form and maturate within 12 days in vitro (d.i.v.) in dissociated hippocampal neuronal cultures (17Basarsky T.A. Parpura V. Haydon P.G. Hippocampal synaptogenesis in cell culture. Developmental time course of synapse formation, calcium influx, and synaptic protein distribution.J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 6402-6411Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To conduct multiple experiments (i.e., obtain IA parameters, quantify spontaneous firing and evoked action potentials, and measure synaptic currents) from cultures plated at same day and thereby eliminate culture selection bias from the different parameters evaluated, we performed experiments sequentially in the following time frames: IA recordings were performed on cultures at 10–13 d.i.v.; analysis of spontaneous firing and action potential was performed on cultures at 14–18 d.i.v.; and miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents (mIPSCs) and miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs) were performed on cultures at 16–19 d.i.v. IA, mIPSCs, and mEPSCs were obtained from hippocampal pyramidal shape neurons in the whole cell voltage patch clamp configuration with an Axopatch 200B amplifier at a holding potential of −70 mV. Spontaneous firing and action potential were recorded in the whole cell current patch clamp mode. The current clamp recordings were held at 0 current. Currents and potentials were sampled at 10 kHz and filtered at 2 kHz. For IA, spontaneous firing, action potential, and mEPSC recordings, the pipette internal solution contained 120 mm potassium gluconate, 10 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.6 mm EGTA, 5 mm HEPES, 0.006 mm CaCl2, 10 mm phosphocreatine disodium, 2 mm Mg-ATP, 0.2 mm GTP, and 50 units/ml creatine phosphokinase, pH 7.2 adjusted with KOH; for mIPSC recordings, the pipette internal solution contained 115 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm EGTA, 5 mm HEPES, 2 mm Mg-ATP, 0.2 mm Na-ATP, 5 mm phosphocreatine disodium, pH 7.3, adjusted with KOH. External solution for IA contained 119 mm NaCl, 3 mm KCl, 20 mm HEPES, 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 30 mm glucose, 0.0005 mm tetrodotoxin, 2 mm CsCl, 5 mm tetraethylammonium chloride, 0.1 mm CdCl2, and synaptic blockers, 0.05 mm 2-amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid (APV), 0.02 mm 6,7-dinitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (DNQX), and 0.1 mm picrotoxin, pH 7.3, adjusted with NaOH. Basic external solution for spontaneous firing, action potential, and mIPSC and mEPSC recordings contained 126 mm NaCl, 3 mm KCl, 20 mm HEPES, 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 30 mm glucose, pH 7.3, adjusted with NaOH. For spontaneous firing and action potential, 0.002 mm glycine was added to the basic solution; for mIPSC recording, 0.001 mm tetrodotoxin, 0.05 mm APV, and 0.02 mm DNQX were added; for mEPC recording, 0.001 mm tetrodotoxin, 0.002 mm glycine, and 0.1 mm picrotoxin were added. To isolate IA, total outward K+ currents and the slow activating and slow inactivating components were recorded separately in the same neuron with two different protocols (18Bourdeau M.L. Morin F. Laurent C.E. Azzi M. Lacaille J.-C. Kv4.3-mediated A-type K+ currents underlie rhythmic activity in hippocampal interneurons.J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 1942-1953Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Total outward K+ currents were induced by steps from −90 to +50 mV in 10-mV increments over 400 ms after a 100-ms step to −130 mV from the holding potential. Slowly activating and slowly inactivating components were obtained with a 100-ms prepulse to −10 mV before the steps from −90 to +50 mV. IA was yielded by subtracting the slowly activating and inactivating components from the total K+ currents. Activation curves were obtained using a Boltzmann function: G/Gmax = (1 + exp(−(V − V½)/k))−1, where G/Gmax is the conductance normalized to its maximal value, V is the membrane potential, V½ is the membrane voltage at which the current amplitude is half-maximal, and k is the slope factor. Steady-state inactivation was tested by a two-pulse protocol with the first pulse of 400 ms from −100 to −10 mV in 10-mV increments followed by a second pulse fixed at +10 mV. IA induced by the second pulse was normalized to the maximal current and plotted as the function of the voltages initiated by the first pulse, which was fitted with the Boltzmann function: I/Imax = (1 + exp((V − V½)/k))−1, where I/Imax is the normalized value. Another two-pulse protocol was adopted to test A-type channel recovery from inactivation. Both pulses 1 and 2 were depolarized to +10 mV with various intervals ranging from 1 to 600 ms between them. IA were separated from noninactivating sustained K+ currents by setting the base line as the current level at the end of P2 at the shortest interval of 1 ms. Currents induced by P2 over that by P1 (I2/I1 ratios) were plotted as a function of the various intervals. Recovery τ was estimated with first order exponential decay: y = y0 + Ae−x/t, where y0 indicates y offset, A indicates amplitude, and t indicates time constant. Series resistance for voltage patch clamp experiments ranged from 6 to 15 MΩ (WT, 10.0 ± 1.0 mΩ; Kchip2−/−, 10.6 ± 0.9 mΩ) with 40–60% correction. Junction potential in current patch clamp experiments was measured immediately after recording by quickly detaching pipette from the recorded cell. The measured junction potential was 2.0 ± 0.5 mV for WT neurons and 2.1 ± 0.9 mV for Kchip2−/− neurons, which was not corrected. The animals were deeply anesthetized with isoflurance. The brain was quickly removed from the skull after decapitation and immediately chilled in an ice-cold, oxygenated artificial cerebrospinal fluid containing 120 mm NaCl, 3.3 mm KCl, 25 mm NaHCO3, 1.23 mm NaH2PO4, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 1.2 mm MgSO4, and 10 mm glucose. Coronal slices (300-μm thickness) containing the hippocampus or the basolateral nucleus of the amygdala (BLA) were cut with a moving blade microtome and were kept in normal oxygenated artificial cerebrospinal fluid at 35 °C for 60 min. The slices were then kept at room temperature until used for recording. A single slice was transferred to the recording chamber constantly perfused (∼3 ml/min) with oxygenated artificial cerebrospinal fluid at 35 °C. The neurons were viewed under a Zeiss upright microscope equipped with a 40× water immersion objective and an enhanced differential interference contrast video microscope system. Recording electrodes with resistance of 4–8 MΩ were pulled from borosilicate glass capillaries (1.5 mm outer diameter) using a P87 electrode puller. Access resistance and input capacitance were electronically compensated by ∼60–70% and monitored throughout the experiment to confirm the stability of the recording. The signals were filtered at 5 kHz and digitized at 10 kHz through a Digidata1440 interface controlled by pClamp10 software (Molecular Devices). Spontaneous and evoked action potentials in CA1 and BLA pyramidal neurons were recorded under whole cell current clamp configuration. Evoked action potentials were induced by injecting a series of depolarization current with 600-ms duration in 10-pA increments from a holding potential of −70 mV. The minimal current injected that could evoke action potentials was defined as the current threshold for individual neurons from WT or Kchip2−/− mice. Spontaneous inhibitory and excitatory postsynaptic currents (sIPSCs and sEPSCs) were recorded from soma in hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons under whole cell voltage clamp mode at a holding potential of −70 mV. sIPSCs were isolated in the presence of APV (50 μm) and DNQX (20 μm), and sEPSCs were obtained in the presence of APV (50 μm) and picrotoxin (75 μm). All internal pipette solutions for slice recording were same as those used in the experiments with cultured hippocampal neurons. Total mRNA was purified from hippocampal tissue from 5-month-old mice using the RNAeasy Plus mini kit (Qiagen). The primers are: for Kchip1, forward 5′-TCAAAAACGAGTGCCCTAGC, reverse 5′-CAGAGCAGTCACAAAGTCCTCG; for Kchip2, forward 5′-ATGGCTGTATCACGAAGGAGG, reverse 5′-CCGTCCTTGTTTCTGTCCATC; for Kchip3, forward 5′-GGAGATCCTGGGCGCATAC, reverse 5′-GTGAACCGTGGCCTTTGC; for Kchip4, forward 5′-AGCAGTTCTGATCGTCATTGTGC, reverse 5′-GCTGTCTTCTAAACCTGCTTCAATC; and for β-actin, forward 5′-GATCAAGATCATTGCTCCTCCTG, reverse 5′-AGGGTGTAAAACGCAGCTCA. Real time PCR quantification was performed using the Applied Biosystems 7300 Real-Time PCR System (Invitrogen). The relative amount of target message in each reaction was determined from the detection threshold cycle number (Ct), which is inversely correlated with the abundance of the initial level of the message, after normalization to the Ct for actin, obtained in the same experiment. The numerical averages are presented as the means ± S.E. The cumulative amplitude distributions of synaptic currents were analyzed with Kolmogorov-Smirnov comparisons, and statistical significance for other parameters was calculated using the unpaired two-sample Student's t test. Because loss of IA via deletion of Kv4.2 increased susceptibility to seizures in response to convulsant stimuli (19Barnwell L.F. Lugo J.N. Lee W.L. Willis S.E. Gertz S.J. Hrachovy R.A. Anderson A.E. Kv4.2 knockout mice demonstrate increased susceptibility to convulsant stimulation.Epilepsia. 2009; 50: 1741-1751Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that deletion of KChIP2 protein might similarly enhance susceptibility to seizures evoked by brief, low intensity trains of electrical stimulation applied to the right amygdala in the kindling model, if KChIP2 were a significant regulator of IA. There were no observable behavioral alterations in KChIP2−/− mice, and there were no spontaneous seizures observed while handling WT or Kchip2−/− mice before kindling. In electroencephalographic recordings, no significant differences were detected in the current required to evoke an initial electrographic seizure (210 ± 25 μA versus 168 ± 28 μA, respectively; p = 0.31) between WT and Kchip2−/− mice (n = 5 and 9, respectively). Likewise no significant differences were detected in the duration of the initial evoked electrographic seizure (16.0 ± 4.5 versus 12.6 ± 1.8 s; p = 0.54) between WT and Kchip2−/− mice. However, striking increases in behavioral and electrographic seizure responses to subsequent stimulations were evident in Kchip2−/− compared with WT mice (Fig. 1). The number of stimulations required to evoke the initial class 4 or 5 seizure was decreased by >2-fold in Kchip2−/− mice (5.0 ± 1.0) compared with WT controls (11.4 ± 1.2; p = 0.005). Likewise the number of stimulations required to induce the third consecutive clonic tonic seizure (class 4 or greater) was significantly decreased (9.1 ± 1.6 for Kchip2−/− and 16.0 ± 1.4 for WT mice, respectively; p = 0.01) (Fig. 1B). The duration of electrographic seizures accompanying the behavioral seizures in Kchip2−/− mice exceeded that of WT controls (Fig. 1, A and C), evident in the average duration accompanying the first class 4 or 5 seizure of 59.4 s in Kchip2−/− mice compared with 34.8 s in WT mice (p = 0.04). Thus, despite similar excitability in the naïve condition as assessed by electrographic seizure threshold and duration of the initial electrographic seizure, the absence of KChIP2 enhanced epileptogenesis as revealed by a more rapid rate of development of kindling. These stark differences strongly implicate KChIP2 as nonredundant in at least some sets of neurons. Although a previous study has suggested a lack of effect of KChIP2 deletion on IA in posterior cortical neurons, we asked whether IA in hippocampal neurons might be sensitive to the absence of KChIP2. Among the KChIP proteins, KChIP2 is especially highly expressed within the apical and basal dendrites of hippocampal pyramidal cells (11Rhodes K.J. Carroll K.I. Sung M.A. Doliveira L.C. Monaghan M.M. Burke S.L. Strassle B.W. Buchwalder L. Menegola M. Cao J. An W.F. Trimmer J.S. KChIPs and Kv4 α subunits as integral components of A-type potassium channels in mammalian brain.J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 7903-7915Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). We therefore recorded IA in cultured hippocampal neurons from Kchip2−/− and WT animals using a two-step procedure (18Bourdeau M.L. Morin F. Laurent C.E. Azzi M. Lacaille J.-C. Kv4.3-mediated A-type K+ currents underlie rhythmic activity in hippocampal interneurons.J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 1942-1953Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). After recording total K+ current, we isolated the residual slowly activating component in the same neuron by eliminating the fast activating IA component with a prepulse to a −10 mV. We then subtracted the slowly activating component from the total K+ current to yield IA. As shown in the inset of Fig. 2A, we confirmed the identity of this current as IA by showing that it was completely blocked by 4-aminopyridine in WT and KChIP2−/− neurons. With this method, Fig. 2 (A and B) shows that KChIP2 deletion reduced IA amplitude with the strongest depolarizations (>40 mV; p = 0.04), but the overall effect was mild. Previous studies have demonstrated that KChIP proteins increase Kv4 channel availability (depolarizing shift in steady-state inactivation) and enhance channel recovery from inactivation while having a minimal effect upon channel activation (1An W.F. Bowlby M.R. Betty M. Cao J. Ling H.P. Mendoza G. Hinson J.W. Mattsson K.I. Strassle B.W. Trimmer J.S. Rhodes K.J.

Regulation of Kv4.3 voltage-dependent gating kinetics by KChIP2 isoforms.J. Physiol. 2004; 557: 19-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). We therefore assessed whether any of these IA gating kinetics were altered by elimination of KChIP2. Consistent with those previous observations, deletion of KChIP2 did not affect channel activation (Fig. 2C) but did shift the V½ for steady-state inactivation (−54.7 ± 1.1 versus −59.7 ± 1.1 mV; p = 0.004) (Fig. 3, A and B) and slowed recovery from inactivation (τ = 23.2 ± 2.5 versus 32.3 ± 2.2 ms, respectively; p = 0.01) (Fig. 3, C and D). Although these data suggest that the absence of KChIP2 imparts only a mild decrease to IA amplitude, they demonstrate significant effects upon IA availability and recovery from inactivation in hippocampal neurons. To test whether other Kv currents were affected, we analyzed the residual slowly activating component. No significant difference was found between WT and Kchip2−/− neurons (data not shown). Together, these observations show that KChIP2 is an important regulator of IA in hippocampal ne"
https://openalex.org/W2049946868,"Previously, we have reported that most, if not all, of the Scyphozoan jellyfish venoms contain multiple components of metalloproteinases, which apparently linked to the venom toxicity. Further, it is also well known that there is a positive correlation between the inflammatory reaction of dermal tissues and their tissue metalloproteinase activity. Based on these, the use of metalloproteinase inhibitors appears to be a promising therapeutic alternative for the treatment of jellyfish envenomation.Tetracycline (a metalloproteinase inhibitor) has been examined for its activity to reduce or prevent the dermal toxicity induced by Nemopilema nomurai (Scyphozoa: Rhizostomeae) jellyfish venom (NnV) using in vitro and in vivo models. HaCaT (human keratinocyte) and NIH3T3 (mouse fibroblast) incubated with NnV showed decreases in cell viability, which is associated with the inductions of metalloproteinase-2 and -9. This result suggests that the use of metalloproteinase inhibitors, such as tetracycline, may prevent the jellyfish venom-mediated local tissue damage. In vivo experiments showed that comparing with NnV-alone treatment, tetracycline pre-mixed NnV demonstrated a significantly reduced progression of dermal toxicity upon the inoculation onto rabbit skin.It is believed that there has been no previous report on the therapeutic agent of synthetic chemical origin for the treatment of jellyfish venom-induced dermonecrosis based on understanding its mechanism of action except the use of antivenom treatment. Furthermore, the current study, for the first time, has proposed a novel mechanism-based therapeutic intervention for skin damages caused by jellyfish stings."
https://openalex.org/W2110181906,"This study offers evidence of the robustness of farmer rice varieties (Oryza glaberrima and O. sativa) in West Africa. Our experiments in five West African countries showed that farmer varieties were tolerant of sub-optimal conditions, but employed a range of strategies to cope with stress. Varieties belonging to the species Oryza glaberrima – solely the product of farmer agency – were the most successful in adapting to a range of adverse conditions. Some of the farmer selections from within the indica and japonica subspecies of O. sativa also performed well in a range of conditions, but other farmer selections from within these two subspecies were mainly limited to more specific niches. The results contradict the rather common belief that farmer varieties are only of local value. Farmer varieties should be considered by breeding programmes and used (alongside improved varieties) in dissemination projects for rural food security."

https://openalex.org/W1973859758,"Background and Aims Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is associated with systemic oxidative stress. Since the heme catabolic pathway plays an important role in antioxidant protection, we attempted to assess the gene expression of key enzymes of heme catabolism, heme oxygenase 1 (HMOX1), heme oxygenase 2 (HMOX2), and biliverdin reductase A (BLVRA) in the liver and peripheral blood leukocytes (PBL) of patients chronically infected with HCV. Methods Gene expressions (HMOX1, HMOX2, BLVRA) and HCV RNA were analyzed in PBL of HCV treatment naïve patients (n = 58) and controls (n = 55), with a subset of HCV patients having data on hepatic gene expression (n = 35). Based upon the therapeutic outcome, HCV patients were classified as either responders (n = 38) or treatment-failure patients (n = 20). Blood samples in HCV patients were collected at day 0, and week 12, 24, 36, and 48 after the initiation of standard antiviral therapy. Results Compared to the controls, substantially increased BLVRA expression was detected in PBL (p<0.001) of therapeutically naïve HCV patients. mRNA levels of BLVRA in PBL closely correlated with those in liver tissue (r2 = 0.347,p = 0.03). A marked difference in BLVRA expression in PBL between the sustained responders and patients with treatment failure was detected at week 0 and during the follow-up (p<0.001). Multivariate analysis revealed that BLVRA basal expression in PBL was an independent predictor for sustained virological response (OR 15; 95% CI 1.05–214.2; P = 0.046). HMOX1/2 expression did not have any effect on the treatment outcome. Conclusion Our results suggest that patients with chronic HCV infection significantly upregulate BLVRA expression in PBL. The lack of BLVRA overexpression is associated with non-responsiveness to standard antiviral therapy; whereas, HMOX1/2 does not seem to have any predictive potential."
https://openalex.org/W1989020887,"Endothelial lipase (EL) plays a pivotal role in HDL metabolism. We sought to characterize EL and its interaction with HDL as well as its natural variants genetically, functionally and structurally. We screened our biethnic population sample (n = 802) for selected missense mutations (n = 5) and identified T111I as the only common variant. Multiple linear regression analyses in Hispanic subjects revealed an unexpected association between T111I and elevated LDL-C (p-value = 0.012) and total cholesterol (p-value = 0.004). We examined lipase activity of selected missense mutants (n = 10) and found different impacts on EL function, ranging from normal to complete loss of activity. EL-HDL lipidomic analyses indicated that EL has a defined remodeling of HDL without exhaustion of the substrate and a distinct and preference for several fatty acids that are lipid mediators and known for their potent pro- and anti-inflammatory properties. Structural studies using homology modeling revealed a novel α/β motif in the C-domain, unique to EL. The EL dimer was found to have the flexibility to expand and to bind various sizes of HDL particles. The likely impact of the all known missense mutations (n = 18) on the structure of EL was examined using molecular modeling and the impact they may have on EL lipase activity using a novel structure-function slope based on their structural free energy differences. The results of this multidisciplinary approach delineated the impact of EL and its variants on HDL. Moreover, the results suggested EL to have the capacity to modulate vascular health through its role in fatty acid-based signaling pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2061091085,"Growth arrest and DNA damage (GADD) 45α is a member of GADD inducible gene family, and is inducible in cell response to oxidative stress. GADD45α upregulation induces MKK4/JNK activation in some published experimental systems. However, we found here that the depletion of GADD45α (GADD45α−/−) in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) resulted in an increase in the phosphorylation of MKK4/7, MKK3/6 and consequently specific up-regulated the activation of JNK/p38 and their downstream transcription factors, such as c-Jun and ATF2, in comparison to those in GADD45α+/+ MEFs cell following nickel exposure. This up-regulation of MKK-JNK/p38 pathway in GADD45α−/− cell could be rescued by the reconstitutional expression of HA-GADD45α in GADD45α−/− MEFs, GADD45α−/−(HA-GADD45α). Subsequent studies indicated that GADD45α deletion repressed expression of PP2Cα, the phosphotase of MKK3/6 and MKK4/7, whereas ectopic expression of HA-PP2Cα in GADD45α−/− cells attenuated activation of MKK3/6-p38 and MKK4/7-JNK pathways. Collectively, our results demonstrate a novel function and mechanism responsible for GADD45α regulation of MKK/MAPK pathway, further provides insight into understanding the big picture of GADD45α in the regulation of cellular responses to oxidative stress and environmental carcinogens."

Therefore, understanding signal-induced gene regulatory pathways involved during B cell activation is important to tackle pathologies associated with altered B cell function. Primary response genes (PRGs) are rapidly induced upon signaling in B cells and other cell types and often encode oncogenic transcription factors, which are associated with various malignancies. However, an important issue that remains unclear is whether the fundamental mechanism of activation of these genes is essentially the same under such diverse conditions. c-fos is a PRG that is induced rapidly upon activation of B cells in response to a wide variety of stimuli. Using the c-fos gene as a candidate PRG, we addressed here how it is regulated in response to tumor-promoting and antigen-mimicking signals. Our results show that although the mRNA was induced and extinguished within minutes in response to both signals, surprisingly, apparently full-length unspliced pre-mRNA persisted for several hours in both cases. However, although the mitogenic signal resulted in a more sustained mRNA response that persisted for 4 h, antigenic signaling resulted in a more robust but very transient response that lasted for <1 h.

B cells are essential components of our immune system, and they respond to various cell extrinsic signals to mount an immune response. However, stimulation through different receptors will result in engagement of different signaling pathways and subsequently will result in qualitative differences in programs that initiate the proliferative process (1Fowler T.

Thus, BCR signaling in immature B cells results in cell death, whereas BCR signaling in mature B cells results in survival and proliferation of these cells (2Kurosaki T. Shinohara H. Baba Y.

Interestingly, although the early kinetics (1–2 h) of expression of most primary response genes (PRGs) are very similar in both transient and sustained signaling, some of the PRGs are expressed for an extended period (6–9 h) only after sustained signaling (5Damdinsuren B.

B cells activated by anti-IgM also transiently express the c-fos mRNA within 0.5 h and then enter into S phase of the cell cycle within 4–8 h (9Huo L. Rothstein T.L.

Most information regarding c-fos regulation has been obtained in fibroblasts. Transcription of the c-fos mRNA peaks within 15–30 min after the addition of fresh serum or growth factor to the culture medium and then declines abruptly, returning to initial low levels by ∼60 min (15Chen T.A. Allfrey V.G. Rapid and reversible changes in nucleosome structure accompany the activation, repression, and superinduction of murine fibroblast protooncogenes c-fos and c-myc.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1987; 84: 5252-5256Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Although these events take place long before DNA synthesis and changes in nucleosome structure during nucleosome assembly at the replication fork, it is a challenge to understand both the basal and induced chromatin status of this gene (16Clayton A.L.

Given that induction of c-fos plays a critical role in driving signal-induced B cell proliferation, we sought to study its transcriptional and epigenetic regulation in response to anti-IgM and P+I stimulation using a mature murine B cell line as a model system. Although both signals regulate c-fos expression in similar ways, there are differences in c-fos expression in response to these signals particularly in terms of unspliced pre-RNA generation. In addition, we show that another PRG, egr-2, is regulated in a similar fashion as c-fos, whereas c-myc is not. Our results reveal an unexpected regulatory step of PRG expression at the level of primary transcription. The mature mouse B cell lymphoma BAL17 was cultured in RPMI medium with HEPES (Invitrogen) supplemented with 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 0.5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol solution (all Invitrogen) and 10% fetal calf sera (Atlanta Biologicals). 1–2 × 106 cells were used for RNA-based assays, and 2 × 107 cells were used for ChIP. 10 ng/ml phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (Sigma) and 150 nm ionomycin (Sigma) were added to cell medium for P+I induction of transcription. For BCR induction, goat IgG Fab fragments specific for mouse IgM (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) were added at 10 μg/ml to cells for various times. 5,6-Dichloro-1-β-d-ribofuranosyl-1H-benzimidazole (DRB; Sigma) was used at 100 μm for 10 min prior to stimulation.

Mouse primary splenic cells were isolated from 8-week-old C57BL/6 male mice (The Jackson Laboratory) following normal procedures. Resting B cells were isolated by labeling splenocytes with antibody against the activation marker CD43 (Miltenyi) and isolating the negative population (CD43−) as resting B cells following the manufacturer's protocol. The cells were incubated on ice for 30 min with or without ligands, 25 μg/ml Salmonella typhimurium typhi LPS (Sigma) or 10 μg/ml goat IgG Fab fragments specific for mouse IgM, before incubation at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for the times indicated. RNA was isolated with the Ambion® PureLink RNA mini kit (Invitrogen), followed by digestion with DNase I (Ambion) and purification with a secondary PureLink RNA column. Random primers and reverse transcriptase (Applied Biosystems) were employed to produce cDNA, which was then digested with RNase (Sigma). Samples were diluted in SYBR Green solution (Applied Biosystems) following the manufacturer's instructions. Primers were kept at 900 nm, and samples were run in triplicate with a thermal profile of 95 °C for 10 min and 40 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 45 s with the recommended thermal dissociation curve provided by the Applied Biosystems 7300 real-time PCR system. The RT-PCR signals were monitored for consistent dissociation curves and temperatures. All analyses were performed in triplicate. The following primers were used: c-fos mRNA, GGATTTGACTGGAGGTCTG and TGGGCTCAGGGTCGTTGA; c-myc mRNA, TCTCCACTCACCAGCACAACTACG and ATCTGCTTCAGGACCCT; egr-2 mRNA, ATCCTGCGACCTCGAAAGTA and TCAGAGCGTGAGAACCTCCT; and β-actin mRNA, CCTCTATGCCAACACAGTGCGTGCTA and GGAGCCAGAGCAG. The primary transcript primers were as follows: fos, GGCTCTCCTGTCAACACACA and TCCAGAGCGAAAAAGGAAGA (exon 1 to intron 1), CCTGTGCTGGAACCTCCTC and TGTCACCGTGGGGATAAGT (intron 1 to exon 2), GAATGGTGAAGACCGTGTCA and AGCCCCACAAAGGTCCAGAAT (exon 2 to intron 2), ACTGGGGTGACTGAATGGAG and CCTTCGGATTCTCCGTTTCT (intron 2 to exon 3), AGAAACGGAGAATCCGAAGG and GTTCAACCTACCGCTTGGAG (exon 3 to intron 3), and GTTGGAGCTTGGGACTATGG and TGCAACGCAGACTTCTCATC (intron 3 to exon 4); c-myc, AGAGCTCCTCGAGCTGTTTG and CGCTACATTCAAGACGCAGA (intron 1 to exon 1) and AGACTTGCTTCCCTTGCTGT and AGGGCTGTACGGAGTCGTAG (intron 2 to exon 2); and egr-2, GACCATCTTCCCCAATGGT and CCACAAGCTCCGAAGAAGAC (exon 1 to intron 1) and CTCATTGTCCCACCTCTTCC and GGAGATCCAGGGGTCTCTTC (intron 1 to exon 2). To prepare chromatin, 2 × 107 BAL17 cells were washed twice with PBS and chromatin cross-linked by 1% formaldehyde exposure, followed by the addition of 0.125 m glycine to stop cross-linking. Cells were then washed twice with 10 ml of cold PBS and stored at −80 °C for subsequent processing. For processing, cell pellets were resuspended in 1 ml of ice-cold cell lysis buffer (5 mm PIPES (pH 8.0), 85 mm KCl, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40) supplemented with protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma). After centrifugation, the remaining nuclei were resuspended in 200 μl of ice-cold nuclear lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8.1), 10 mm EDTA, and 1% SDS) supplemented with protease inhibitor mixture. After a short incubation on ice, the sample volume was increased to 500 μl with ChIP dilution buffer (1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, and 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.1)) supplemented with protease inhibitor mixture. Chromatin was sonicated with a Branson 350 Sonifier at a continuous setting of 2 for 10 cycles of 20 s each. After centrifugation, chromatin was precleared with protein A-Agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and the samples were diluted to 2 ml with ChIP dilution buffer and incubated overnight at 4 °C with protein A-agarose prelinked to various antibodies (see below). Thereafter, chromatin-agarose was washed with 1 ml of cold buffer containing 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8), and 150 mm NaCl; with 1 ml of cold buffer containing 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8), and 500 mm NaCl; with 1 ml of cold radioimmune precipitation assay buffer containing 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.6), 1 mm EDTA, 0.7% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Nonidet P-40, and 0.5 m LiCl; and twice with Tris/EDTA (pH 7.5). Chromatin was then eluted with 100 μl 1% SDS and 0.1 m NaHCO3 for 30 min at room temperature. Eluted chromatin and input DNA (5% of the pre-immunoprecipitation sample) were incubated for 15 h at 65 °C. DNA was purified using PureLink PCR purification kits (Invitrogen), treated with RNase mixture (Sigma), and quantified with the Qubit dsDNA HS system (Invitrogen). Samples were then analyzed by real-time PCR as described above. The following antibodies were used: 2 μg of rabbit anti-acetyl-histone 3 antibody (Upstate); 4 μg of rabbit anti-mouse RNA polymerase II (Pol II) polyclonal antibody N-20 (sc-899 X), 4 μg of mouse anti-phospho-Ser5 Pol II monoclonal antibody (sc-47701 X), 5 μg of rabbit anti-cyclin T1 antibody H-245 (sc-10750 X), and 5 μg of rabbit anti-Spt5 polyclonal antibody H-300 (sc-28678) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology); 2 μg of rabbit anti-H3K4me3 (histone 3, lysine 4 trimethylation) polyclonal antibody and 2 μg of rabbit anti-H3K36me3 polyclonal antibody (Abcam); and 5 μg of mouse anti-mouse U2AF65 monoclonal antibody (clone MC3, Sigma). The ChIP primers used were as follows: fos−339, CCTTTACACAGGATGTCCATATTAGGA and CGTGTAGGATTTCGGAGATGGT; fos+116, GGCTTTCCCCAAACTTCGA and GCTACTGCAGCGGGAGGAT; fos+1016, CTGTCCGTCTCTAGTGCCAACTT and GAGACCAGAGTGGGCTGCA; fos+1694, CTCCTGAAGAGGAAGAGAAACG and GTGTATCTGTCAGCTCCCTCCT; and fos+2667, GGACCTTACCTGTTCGTGAAACA and TGAGGACTGGAGGCCAGATG. To analyze the signal-specific induction kinetics of c-fos mRNA in the BAL17 B cell line, we stimulated these cells either with P+I (Fig. 1A) or with anti-IgM (BCR) (Fig. 1B). In both experiments, the basal levels of c-fos mRNA were insignificant without induction (Fig. 1). However, as noted previously (9Huo L. Rothstein T.L. Receptor-specific induction of individual AP-1 components in B lymphocytes.J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 3300-3309PubMed Google Scholar, 10Klemsz M.J. Justement L.B. Palmer E. Cambier J.C.

Induction of early response genes by cross-linking membrane Ig on B lymphocytes.J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 4822-4832PubMed Google Scholar), the mRNA levels were induced sharply after 30 min of stimulation. Although BCR induced much greater c-fos expression compared with P+I stimulation, the mRNA levels were sharply decreased and were undetectable beyond 2 h, whereas significant levels of mRNA persisted for 4 h upon P+I stimulation. Importantly, similar kinetics and expression patterns were observed in freshly isolated murine splenic B cells. Although BCR induced c-fos mRNA with essentially identical kinetics as observed with the B cell line, LPS, which stimulates via TLR4 (Toll-like receptor-4) (19Doyle S.L. O'Neill L.A.

Overall, these data agree with previous reports (9Huo L. Rothstein T.L. Receptor-specific induction of individual AP-1 components in B lymphocytes.J.

Thus, PRGs show a high level of pre-existing H3K4me3 across the promoter region as well as H3K36me3 in the coding region. In addition, there is a dynamic turnover of histone acetylation by the action of histone acetyltransferases and histone deacetylases, which affects all K4me3-modified histone H3, which is also detectable in the absence of signaling (16Clayton A.L.

Therefore, to further understand the signal-specific regulation of c-fos, we sought to analyze how the chromatin marks are altered upon induction of B cells with either P+I or BCR by employing ChIP assays. First, we looked at H3K4me3 throughout the gene (Fig. 2A) with an H3K4me3-specific antibody. As noted previously (16Clayton A.L. Hazzalin C.A. Mahadevan L.C. Enhanced histone acetylation and transcription: a dynamic perspective.Mol. Cell. 2006; 23: 289-296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar, 17Edmunds J.W. Mahadevan L.C.

Dynamic histone H3 methylation during gene induction: HYPB/Setd2 mediates all H3K36 trimethylation.EMBO J. 2008; 27: 406-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar), significant levels of constitutive H3K4me3 were observed. However, signal-induced enhancement of H3K4me3 was observed upon both stimulations and in a time-dependent manner. In accordance with H3K4me3 being predominantly associated with promoter activation, the highest signal was observed around the promoter region spanning the transcription start site (TSS) and dropped precipitously farther downstream and was barely detectable at the 3′-end of the gene (Fig. 2A). In addition to the H3K4me3 mark, significant levels of constitutive H3 acetylation (total) were also observed (Fig. 2B), and the signals were sharply enhanced upon both stimulations. Once again, the H3 acetylation signals were reduced drastically at downstream regions (Fig. 2). In summary, although minor differences were noted, no dramatic chromatin changes were observed in c-fos upon P+I versus BCR stimulation. We subsequently analyzed the recruitment of Pol II at the c-fos gene upon P+I or BCR stimulation. Previous studies indicated that a transcriptional pausing/elongation block regulates many genes, including c-fos (21Adelman K. Lis J.T.

Elongation by RNA polymerase II: the short and long of it.Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2437-2468Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar). Collectively, these studies suggest that in the basal/uninduced state, Pol II is engaged at the promoter-proximal region of these genes, pausing at ∼40 nucleotides downstream of the TSS. Mitogenic signals remove the elongation block and induce an elongation-competent complex that completes elongation and gene expression (22Collart M.A. Tourkine N. Belin D. Vassalli P. Jeanteur P. Blanchard J.M. c-fos gene transcription in murine macrophages is modulated by a calcium-dependent block to elongation in intron 1.Mol. Cell.

Regulation of c-fos expression by RNA polymerase elongation competence.J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 280: 785-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In agreement with these observations, we noticed a significant level of total Pol II signal in the absence of any signaling (Fig. 2C). As expected, Pol II recruitment at the promoter region spanning the TSS and the first exon was greatly enhanced upon both types of signaling, and a noticeable amount of Pol II persisted in this region even at 4 h post-stimulation when mRNA was undetectable (Fig. 1). This was most apparent upon BCR stimulation (Fig. 2C, right panel). However, the Pol II density at downstream regions (particularly at exon 3, position 1694) was drastically reduced (Fig. 2C). Therefore, significant levels of Pol II persisted around the c-fos promoter region well after mRNA expression was extinguished. Interestingly, there appeared to be a low but above background level of Pol II accumulation at the 3′-end of the gene in both cases. Because phosphorylation of the C-terminal domain of Pol II is associated with regulation of transcriptional initiation and elongation at many promoters (26Buratowski S. The CTD code.Nat. Struct.

https://openalex.org/W2048481876,"In this paper we use empirical loudness modeling to explore a perceptual sub-category of the dynamic range problem of auditory neuroscience. Humans are able to reliably report perceived intensity (loudness), and discriminate fine intensity differences, over a very large dynamic range. It is usually assumed that loudness and intensity change detection operate upon the same neural signal, and that intensity change detection may be predicted from loudness data and vice versa. However, while loudness grows as intensity is increased, improvement in intensity discrimination performance does not follow the same trend and so dynamic range estimations of the underlying neural signal from loudness data contradict estimations based on intensity just-noticeable difference (JND) data. In order to account for this apparent paradox we draw on recent advances in auditory neuroscience. We test the hypothesis that a central model, featuring central adaptation to the mean loudness level and operating on the detection of maximum central-loudness rate of change, can account for the paradoxical data. We use numerical optimization to find adaptation parameters that fit data for continuous-pedestal intensity change detection over a wide dynamic range. The optimized model is tested on a selection of equivalent pseudo-continuous intensity change detection data. We also report a supplementary experiment which confirms the modeling assumption that the detection process may be modeled as rate-of-change. Data are obtained from a listening test (N = 10) using linearly ramped increment-decrement envelopes applied to pseudo-continuous noise with an overall level of 33 dB SPL. Increments with half-ramp durations between 5 and 50,000 ms are used. The intensity JND is shown to increase towards long duration ramps (p<10−6). From the modeling, the following central adaptation parameters are derived; central dynamic range of 0.215 sones, 95% central normalization, and a central loudness JND constant of 5.5×10−5 sones per ms. Through our findings, we argue that loudness reflects peripheral neural coding, and the intensity JND reflects central neural coding."

This study aims at analyzing economic value of chronic hepatitis B (CHB) treatment options, which are available in Korea. Methods CHB infection was simulated using a health-state transition model with disease states defined as mild disease (Ishak F0/F1), fibrosis (F2/F3/F4), advanced fibrosis/cirrhosis (>F4), and complicated disease states (decompensated cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, liver transplant and death) based on available natural history data. The value of treatment-specific attributes on disease progression/regression was estimated based on published data in terms of events and costs avoided. 5-year treatment duration was assumed except for treatment initiation. Primary model output is the estimated cost savings of entecavir per patient per day of treatment versus the comparator in question for a given CHB patient. Results The simulation of treating with entecavir versus no treatment predicted improved clinical outcomes for entecavir-treatment patients. In the long term, these clinical benefits translate into cost savings of $3.10 per day of treatment. In naive patient treatment, daily cost savings of using entecavir versus lamivudine or telbivudine was estimated at $2.89 and $1.72, respectively. In the case of suboptimal responders who pre-treated with lamivudine, daily cost saving for patients switching to entecavir was $1.38 per day of treatment compared to patients maintaining on lamivudine. Conclusions Entecavir exhibits characteristics of a favourable CHB treatment, which directly translates into economic and therapeutic value as opposed to either no treatment or alternative strategies."

We used a Holstein-Friesian x Jersey F2 crossbred pedigree to undertake a genome-wide search for QTL influencing IgA concentration and yield in colostrum and milk. We identified a single genome-wide significant QTL on chromosome 16, maximising at 4.8 Mbp. The polymeric immunoglobulin receptor gene (PIGR) was within the confidence interval of the QTL. In addition, mRNA expression analysis revealed a liver PIGR expression QTL mapping to the same locus as the IgA quantitative trait locus. Sequencing and subsequent genotyping of the PIGR gene revealed three divergent haplotypes that explained the variance of both the IgA QTL and the PIGR expression QTL. Genetic selection based on these markers will facilitate the production of bovine herds producing milk with higher concentrations of IgA."
https://openalex.org/W1983698603,"In optical printed Chinese character recognition (OPCCR), many classifiers have been proposed for the recognition. Among the classifiers, support vector machine (SVM) might be the best classifier. However, SVM is a classifier for two classes. When it is used for multi-classes in OPCCR, its computation is time-consuming. Thus, we propose a neighbor classes based SVM (NC-SVM) to reduce the computation consumption of SVM. Experiments of NC-SVM classification for OPCCR have been done. The results of the experiments have shown that the NC-SVM we proposed can effectively reduce the computation time in OPCCR."
