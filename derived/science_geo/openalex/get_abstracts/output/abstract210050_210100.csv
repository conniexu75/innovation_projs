https://openalex.org/W2098688509,"From the Division of Physical Chemistry, Commonwealth ScientiJic and Industrial Research Organization, Melbourne, Australia (Received for publication, September 27, 1962) The chemical behavior of metmyoglobin has received con- siderable attention, notably by Keilin and Hartree (1) and by George (2) and George and Irvine (3-5), on the grounds that it has the same prosthetic group as peroxidase and catalase and reacts with II&&, but at a rate more convenient for kinetic investigation. Although the mechanism of HzOz decomposition has proved t.o be different, this in itself is of interest if we can correlate the observed chemical behavior with the nature of the amino acid side chains which surround the iron-porphyrin- histidine-water complex. For such studies the myoglobin molecule is particularly appropriate, since its structure is known with more certainty than that of any other metalloprotein (6). By a combination of electron spin resonance, manometric, and moderately rapid spectrophotometric techniques, applied at low temperatures to slow the reactions, we have found that the complexity of metmyoglobin oxidation is considerably greater than generally believed. The present paper is concerned mainly with the formation and subsequent reaction of the com- plex described by Keilin and Hartree (1) which is characterized by an absorption peak at 545 mp, and with the extent of osida- tion of the protein in the vicinity of the iron atom. In a later paper we shall discuss the nature of the free radical observed by Gibson, Ingram, and Nicholls (7). As an essential part of the argument of the present paper, we show that the free radical is formed extensively at pH 6 and provide evidence for the mech- anism of its appearance and subsequent loss. We wish to point out that the conclusions reached do not necessarily apply below pH 6 or above pH 8."

https://openalex.org/W1965144514,"A peptidase with a high degree of specificity for angiotensin II occurs in normal human plasma and red cells. Preparations from both sources have the same pH optimum, require calcium ions, and hydrolyze valyl(5)- or isoleucyl(5)-angiotensin II, but do not hydrolyze beta-aspartyl(1)-angiotensin II, arginyl(1)-angiotensin II or deaminoangiotensin II. This enzyme, given the name angiotensinase A, requires alpha-L-aspartic acid or alpha-L-asparagine as the N-terminal amino acid in its angiotensin substrate, and thus differs from kidney leucine aminopeptidase. Other peptidases known to hydrolyze angiotensin also hydrolyze at least one of the other angiotensin analogs with substitution in the one position."

Two different sequential tasks were presented. The experimental animals were significantly inferior on both problems to six control animals. Since no impairment appeared on simple visual discriminations presented with intertrial intervals from 5 seconds to 6 minutes, simple sensory deficits and ""short-term"" memory impairments appear unlikely. The results strengthen the interpretation that bilateral hippocampal lesions interfere with the acquisition of those behaviors which involve the execution of sequential responses."

The critical period of gestation for administration was from the 12th to 15th day. Anomalies were produced in the tongue, palatal closure, mouth, lower jaw, vertebrae and limbs."

https://openalex.org/W1990018847,"Randomly labeled tritiated angiotensin has been prepared with a specific activity of 300 microc/mg and with undiminished pressor and oxytocic activity. After infusion, angiotensin accumulated in the kidneys, adrenal glands, and uterus. Thirty minutes after infusion high levels of radioactivity appeared in brain, but the electrophoretic mobility differed from that of angiotensin II. Incubation of angiotensin with hemolyzed human red blood cells or diluted human plasma rapidly inactivated the pressor activity with production of metabolic products separable by paper chromatography. But if undiluted plasma is used with incubation up to 6 hours, no loss of activity occurs."

https://openalex.org/W2035747863,"Weaning age in deer mice is defined as the age at which the young mice maintain or gain weight during a 24-hour period of isolation; mice younger than weaning age lose weight. Two subspecies of deer mice differed in weaning age; the age for Peromyscus maniculatus bairdii was 18 days; for P. m. gracilis, 24 days. Age and food consumption were better predictors of the weaning condition, as defined in terms of weight change with isolation, than body weight."
https://openalex.org/W2065073957,The learning of a list of stimulus-response items is a two-stage process involving response learning and association. It is assumed that both stages are learned in an all-or-none fashion. Subjects were trained to learn a list of paired-associate items with Rock's substitution procedure. Their performance could be predicted from the all-or-none theory with parameter estimates based upon the performance of a different group of subjects who learned the same items under normal conditions.

https://openalex.org/W2066075636,"The type and fate of mononuclear cells of guinea pigs hypersensitive to tuberculin were studied by means of purified protein derivative labeled with I(125) and mononuclear cells labeled with tritiated thymidine. Purified protein derivative labeled with I(125) was taken up in vitro by lymphocytes and neutrophils from animals that were either sensitive or nonsensitive to tuberculin, but it was bound more frequently by the cells of sensitive animals. Passive transfer of tuberculin hypersensitivity by means of lymphocytes labeled with tritiated thymidine indicated that significant numbers of radioactive cells migrated to the site where the skin was tested with purified protein derivative only when the test was made immediately after transfusion. Although skin reactions from tests made with purified protein derivative 24 hours after transfusion were comparable to those from tests made immediately, the number of labeled cells at the sites of the later tests was not consistently larger than it was in controls (Histoplasmin reactions). Thus transfused tuberculin-sensitive cells are neither always attracted to the sites of the test with purified protein derivative nor are they required in large numbers at the site for a positive reaction to develop."

https://openalex.org/W2017771945,Immunoelectrophoretic comparison of maternal and fetal rat serum proteins with antiserum to adult rat serum proteins showed a unique protein in the fetal serum. The fetal protein exhibited in agar gel electrophoresis a variable mobility that was dependent on concentration. The fetal protein reacted strongly with a nonspecific antiserum.
https://openalex.org/W2070991364,Injection of C(14)-labeled amino acids intraperitoneally into rat fetuses in utero results in greater labeling of fetal serum proteins than when the amino acid is injected into the mother. Maternal partial hepatectomy leads to only minimal changes in serum protein synthesis. Rat fetuses synthesize at least some of their serum proteins during the last 3 days of gestation.

https://openalex.org/W1988898845,"PHAGE fr (formerly ft 5 (ref. 1)) in its characteristics2 is related to f-phages described by Loeb and Zinder3. For the initiation of genetical studies, attempts were made to obtain mutants from phage-suspensions treated with nitrous acid. Conditions of treatment were essentially those described by Schuster and Schramm4. Single-hit kinetics of inactivation was established over a range of 5 logarithmic cycles. Standard phage techniques5 were used. Since the rate of inactivation is exponential in relation to the time of incubation in nitrous acid, the inactivation is characterized by the ‘reduced time’ τ= e−1. When suspensions of fr were inactivated at 37° C and pH 4.28 by 0.5 M sodium nitrite, τ equalled 3.5 min. A comparison with the rates of inactivation by nitrous acid as reported for other viruses is shown in Table 1. It demonstrates that the τ of inactivation of phage fr is more closely of the order of the τ of tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) than that of DNA-phages."

https://openalex.org/W2106538408,"RECENT investigations suggest that release of histamine from isolated mast cells of the albino rat by an antigen–antibody reaction is due to an enzymatic process1,2. Further experiments with inhibitors which are more selective reveal that certain specific chymotrypsin substrates or inhibitors prevent the reaction, whereas substrates and inhibitors of carboxypeptidase, leucine-aminopeptidase or trypsin do not3–5. Toxic organic phosphorus compounds such as diisopropylfluorophosphate (DFP) or ‘Paraoxon’ also inhibit in relatively high concentration6. By virtue of these findings we have concluded that the enzyme responsible for the antigen–antibody reaction of isolated tissue mast cells of the albino rat is a chymotrypsin-like peptidase having pronounced esterolytic properties5."

https://openalex.org/W1973650511,A modified comparison microscope assembly was developed for quantitative cytochemical analysis of stained or naturally pigmented objects. Test and control objects were photographed simultaneouslyon the same frame of color film. Pigments in the film image were then extracted and analyzed in a recording spectrophotometer. The total procedure is an extension and simplification of existing methods.
