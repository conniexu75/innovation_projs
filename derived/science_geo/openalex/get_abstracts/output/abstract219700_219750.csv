https://openalex.org/W2034618205,"Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) are nuclear receptors exerting several functions in development and metabolism. The physiological functions of PPARdelta remain elusive. By using a CRE-Lox recombination approach, we generated an animal model for muscle-specific PPARdelta overexpression to investigate the role of PPARdelta in this tissue. Muscle-specific PPARdelta overexpression results in a profound change in fiber composition due to hyperplasia and/or shift to more oxidative fiber and, as a consequence, leads to the increase of both enzymatic activities and genes implicated in oxidative metabolism. These changes in muscle are accompanied by a reduction of body fat mass, mainly due to a large reduction of adipose cell size. Furthermore, we demonstrate that endurance exercise promotes an accumulation of PPARdelta protein in muscle of wild-type animals. Collectively, these results suggest that PPARdelta plays an important role in muscle development and adaptive response to environmental changes, such as training exercise. They strongly support the idea that activation of PPARdelta could be beneficial in prevention of metabolic disorders, such as obesity or type 2 diabetes."

https://openalex.org/W2072363405,"Animals that roam over a large territory in the wild do not take kindly to being confined. Some species — ring-tailed lemurs and snow leopards, for example — apparently thrive in captivity, whereas others, such as Asian elephants and polar bears, are prone to problems that include poor health, repetitive stereotypic behaviour and breeding difficulties. Here we investigate this previously unexplained variation in captive animals' welfare by focusing on caged carnivores, and show that it stems from constraints imposed on the natural behaviour of susceptible animals, with wide-ranging lifestyles in the wild predicting stereotypy and the extent of infant mortality in captivity. Our findings indicate that the keeping of naturally wide-ranging carnivores should be either fundamentally improved or phased out."

Recently the Sec6/8 complex, or exocyst, a multisubunit complex facilitating post-Golgi targeting of distinct subclasses of secretory vesicles, has been identified as a bona fide Ral effector complex. Ral GTPases regulate exocyst-dependent vesicle trafficking and are required for exocyst complex assembly. Sec5, a membrane-associated exocyst subunit, has been identified as a direct target of activated Ral; however, the mechanism by which Ral can modulate exocyst assembly is unknown. Here we report that an additional component of the exocyst, Exo84, is a direct target of activated Ral. We provide evidence that mammalian exocyst components are present as distinct subcomplexes on vesicles and the plasma membrane and that Ral GTPases regulate the assembly interface of a full octameric exocyst complex through interaction with Sec5 and Exo84.

High fidelity targeting of secretory vesicles to discreet plasma membrane domains is critically important for a diverse array of cellular activities. These include establishment and maintenance of cell polarity, synapse formation and synaptic plasticity, controlled release of neurotransmitters, enzymes, hormones, and cytokines, and regulation of levels of plasma membrane receptors, transporters, and lipids. Although much is known about the cellular machinery responsible for docking and fusion of secretory vesicles once at the plasma membrane, far less is understood about mechanisms responsible for targeting secretory vesicles to specific plasma membrane domains (6Jahn R.

Multiple cellular machines are likely required for sorting, targeting, and tethering of discreet classes of secretory vesicles. One these, the Sec6/8 complex or exocyst, has emerged as a core facilitator of vesicle delivery to sites of rapid membrane expansion (10Guo W. Sacher M. Barrowman J. Ferro-Novick S. Novick P. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 251-255Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), of membrane remodeling (11Hsu S.C. Hazuka C.D. Foletti D.L. Scheller R.H.

Hsu S.C. Rodriguez-Boulan E. Scheller R.H. Nelson W.J. Cell. 1998; 93: 731-740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). The exocyst is a multi-protein complex conserved from yeast to humans that includes Sec3, Sec5, Sec6, Sec8, Sec10, Sec15, Exo70, and Exo84 (10Guo W. Sacher M. Barrowman J. Ferro-Novick S. Novick P.

Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 150-153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). In budding yeast, this complex is essential for exocytosis and has been shown to direct vectoral targeting of Golgi-derived secretory vesicles to the growing bud-tip or to the developing mother/bud septum (10Guo W. Sacher M. Barrowman J. Ferro-Novick S. Novick P. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 251-255Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, the Sec6 and Sec8 components of the exocyst have been localized to lateral plasma membranes near the tight junctions of polarized epithelial cells (12Grindstaff K.K. Yeaman C. Anandasabapathy N. Hsu S.C. Rodriguez-Boulan E. Scheller R.H. Nelson W.J. Cell. 1998; 93: 731-740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar), in sites of developing synapses of neuronal cells, and in growth cones of differentiating PC12 cells (11Hsu S.C. Hazuka C.D. Foletti D.L. Scheller R.H. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 150-153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Like yeast, the mammalian exocyst has been directly implicated in post-Golgi targeting of secretory vesicles to discreet membrane sites (11Hsu S.C. Hazuka C.D. Foletti D.L. Scheller R.H. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 150-153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). For example, blocking exocyst complex formation by delivery of neutralizing antibodies to permeabilized epithelial cells resulted in mis-sorting of basolateral membrane proteins to the apical surface without affecting the appropriate spatial delivery of apical membrane proteins (12Grindstaff K.K. Yeaman C. Anandasabapathy N. Hsu S.C. Rodriguez-Boulan E. Scheller R.H. Nelson W.J. Cell. 1998; 93: 731-740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which the exocyst promotes vesicle targeting has not been resolved. Work in yeast suggests that the exocyst is required for vesicle tethering before assembly of exocytic SNARE (soluble NSF (N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor) attachment protein receptors) complexes and membrane fusion. A subset of exocyst subunits likely forms a targeting patch on the plasma membrane, whereas a sub-complex acts to bridge vesicles with the targeting patch (10Guo W. Sacher M. Barrowman J. Ferro-Novick S. Novick P. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 251-255Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 13Guo W. Roth D. Walch-Solimena C. Novick P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1071-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). The targeting and assembly of these complexes is dynamically regulated by Sec4 and Rho1 GTPases in yeast through discreet subunit interactions (10Guo W. Sacher M. Barrowman J. Ferro-Novick S. Novick P. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 251-255Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 13Guo W. Roth D. Walch-Solimena C. Novick P.

Ral (Ras like) GTPases have recently been defined as critical components of the cellular machinery regulating post-Golgi targeting of distinct subsets of secretory vesicles in mammalian cells through direct interaction with the exocyst (1Moskalenko S. Henry D.O. Rosse C. Mirey G. Camonis J.H. White M.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 66-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). Activated Ral proteins bind the Sec5 subunit of the exocyst, and appropriate regulation of this interaction is apparently required for exocyst function (1Moskalenko S. Henry D.O. Rosse C. Mirey G. Camonis J.H. White M.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 66-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar, 15Brymora A. Valova V.A. Larsen M.R. Roufogalis B.D. Robinson P.J. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 73-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). A mechanistic understanding of the contribution of Ral GTPases to exocyst function remains to be developed, but clues come from observations that Ral proteins are located on plasma membrane domains and secretory vesicles, and Ral expression is required for appropriate assembly of the full octameric exocyst complex (1Moskalenko S. Henry D.O. Rosse C. Mirey G. Camonis J.H. White M.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 66-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). Here we show that Ral GTPases regulate exocyst assembly through direct interactions with two distinct subunits of the exocyst complex, Sec5 and Exo84. Like Sec5, the interaction of Ral with Exo84 is direct and selective for the GTP-bound “activated” conformation of the GTPase. Remarkably, the Ral binding domain of Exo84 completely overlaps with a pleckstrin homology (PH) 1The abbreviations used are: PHpleckstrin homologyGTPγSguanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphatesiRNAsmall interfering RNAPI3,4,5P3phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3,4,5-trisphosphateGSTglutathione S-transferase. domain, and RalGTP competes with phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate for interaction with Exo84. Cell fractionation data and analysis of exocyst complex assembly suggests that, as in yeast, a significant fraction of Sec5 and Exo84 is present in distinct subcomplexes. We propose that Ral GTPases function at the interface between these subcomplexes through dual effector interactions to regulate assembly of the full exocyst complex during a vesicle-targeting event. pleckstrin homology guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate small interfering RNA phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3,4,5-trisphosphate glutathione S-transferase. Plasmids—pGAD352X-Exo84 and pGAD352X-Exo84-(122-333) encode full-length and the Ral binding domain of human Exo84 as SpeI/XhoI fragments in pGad352X. pGEX4T-2-Exo84-(122-333) was derived from the pGAD insert as a blunted SpeI/XhoI fragment in the SmaI/XhoI sites of pGEX4T-2 vector. pGEX4T-3-Exo84 contains the full Exo84 coding sequence as an EcoR1/NotI fragment. PCAN-MycExo84 contains the full Exo84 coding sequence as a blunt SpeI/NotI fragment in the EcoRV/NotI sites of pCan-Myc. The remaining plasmids used in this study are as described previously (1Moskalenko S. Henry D.O. Rosse C. Mirey G. Camonis J.H. White M.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 66-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). Antibodies and Other Materials—Exo84 and Sec5 rabbit polyclonal antibodies were raised against peptide antigens (BioCarta). The antibodies were validated using whole cell lysates expressing Myc-tagged Exo84 or hemagglutinin-tagged Sec5 and by using lysates from cells treated with siRNA targeting Exo84 or Sec5. Commercial mouse monoclonal anti-synaptophysin (clone SVP-38) (Sigma S5768) and mouse monoclonal anti-Na,K-ATPase α-1 (Upstate Biotechnology 05-369) were used. The remaining antibodies are as described previously (1Moskalenko S. Henry D.O. Rosse C. Mirey G. Camonis J.H. White M.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 66-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). Phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3,4,5-trisphosphate, dipalmitoyl (PI3,4,5P3), phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate, dipalmitoyl, phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate, dipalmitoyl, and phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate, dipalmitoyl were obtained from Matreya, Inc. l-α-Phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (brain), l-α-phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (brain), l-α-phosphatidylinositol (liver), l-α-phosphatidylcholine (egg or brain), and l-α-phosphatidylserine (brain) were obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids Inc. l-3-Phosphatidyl[N-methyl-3H]choline, 12-dipalmitoyl (specific activity, 112 mCi/mg) was from Amersham Biosciences. Nycodenz and sucrose were obtained from Sigma. siRNAs targeting Exo84 were synthesized from 5′-GGUGCCACUUUACUCUAUAdTdT-3′ and 5′-UAUAGAGUAAAGUGGCACCdTdT-3′. Cell Culture and Transfection—293T cells were maintained in sodium pyruvate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium cell culture medium (Invitrogen) with 10% fetal bovine serum Invitrogen). Transfection of 293T cells was performed using calcium phosphate precipitation as previously described (1Moskalenko S. Henry D.O. Rosse C. Mirey G. Camonis J.H. White M.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 66-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). PC12 cells were maintained in RPMI1640 medium with 10% horse serum (heat-inactivated) and 5% fetal bovine serum on collagen-coated dishes. Cells were transfected using Pfx-1 according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). HeLa cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum. siRNAs were transfected with Oligofectamine (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's optimized protocol. Yeast Two-hybrid Analysis—Two-hybrid screens and pairwise mating assays were performed using standard procedures (2Vojtek A.B. Hollenberg S.M. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 255: 331-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Protein Complex Analysis—In vitro binding assays and coimmunoprecipitation assays were performed as previously described (1Moskalenko S. Henry D.O. Rosse C. Mirey G. Camonis J.H. White M.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 66-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). Preparation of 3H-Labeled Liposomes—Phospholipids (total of 1.75 mg) dissolved in chloroform were mixed in a glass tube and dried under a nitrogen stream. Liposomes were made from 1.25 mg of phosphatidylcholine (Avanti Polar Lipids) mixed with 0.5 mg of phosphatidylserine, PI, l-α-phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (Avanti Polar Lipids), phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate, phosphatidylinositol 3,4,-bisphosphate, and phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (Matreya). Liposomes also contained 20 μCi of l-3-phosphatidyl[N-methyl-3H]choline, 12-dipalmitoyl (Amersham Biosciences, specific activity, 112 mCi/mg) as a tracer. Dried phospholipids were dissolved in 10 ml of hydration buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.1, 100 mm NaCl). After 40 min of incubation in hydration buffer lipids were re-suspended by vigorous shaking for 1 min. The resulting suspensions were sonicated for 30 s (VibraCell, Sonics and Materials) at 70% energy output and briefly centrifuged (700 × g for 5 min) to remove aggregates. Liposome suspensions were stored on ice and used within 2 weeks. Phospholipid Binding Assays—Liposome precipitation assays were performed essentially described by Davletov and Sudhof (3Davletov B.A. Sudhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26386-26390Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 400 pmol of GST-Exo84-(122-333) immobilized on glutathione-agarose beads were prewashed and re-suspended in 0.2 ml of hydration buffer containing 3H-labeled liposomes (17.5 μg of lipids; ∼120,000 cpm). The mixture was incubated at room temperature with vigorous shaking for 21 min. The beads were washed 3 times with hydration buffer and incubated with 10% SDS for 5 min. Liposome binding was then quantified by liquid scintillation counting. To assess the consequences of Ral on the PH/phosphoinositide interactions, recombinant His6-Ral was eluted from nickel-agarose beads and loaded with GDP or GTPγS. In vitro binding assays using 400 pmol of GST-Exo84-(122-333) and 2400 pmol of Ral were performed as described (1Moskalenko S. Henry D.O. Rosse C. Mirey G. Camonis J.H. White M.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 66-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). Phospholipid binding measurements were performed as described above. To assess the association of Exo84 with liposomes by density gradient fractionation, a modification of the procedure described by Matsuoka et al. (4Matsuoka K. Orci L. Amherdt M. Bednarek S.Y. Hamamoto S. Schekman R. Yeung T. Cell. 1998; 93: 263-275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar) was used. Lipids were hydrated with 65% Nycodenz buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.1, 50 mm potassium acetate, 10% glycerol, 65% Nycodenz (Sigma)). Liposomes, prepared as described above, were made with a ratio of 90:30:10 phosphatidylcholine:phosphatidylserine:phosphoinositide (PI, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate, or phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate). 1 μg of recombinant GST-Exo84-(122-333) was eluted from Sepharose beads and mixed with 30 μl of liposomes, giving a final Nycodenz concentration of 50%. Binding reactions were incubated 15 min on ice and then overlaid with 61 μl of 45% Nycodenz buffer, 77 μl of 40% Nycodenz buffer, and 14 μl of 0% Nycodenz buffer. The resulting step gradient was centrifuged in a Beckman MLA-130 rotor for 3 h at 70,000 rpm. 30-μl fractions were collected from the top of the tube and analyzed by Western blotting. Immunofluorescence—PC12 cells were plated on poly-l-lysine (Sigma; P-1399)-coated coverslips and transfected as described previously (1Moskalenko S. Henry D.O. Rosse C. Mirey G. Camonis J.H. White M.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 66-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). At 24 h post-transfection cells were incubated in reduced serum medium (0.5% horse serum) for 24 h. At 48 h post-transfection, cells were washed in low potassium saline (145 mm NaCl, 5.6 mm KCl, 2.2 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 5.6 mm glucose, 15 mm HEPES, pH 7.4). Cells were then incubated in low potassium saline or high potassium saline (95 mm NaCl, 56 mm KCl, 2.2 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 5.6 mm glucose, 15 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) at 37 °C followed by fixation with 3.7% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline. Fixed cells were permeabilized with 0.25% Triton X-100 and 1% bovine serum in phosphate-buffered saline. For the detection of Exo84 Ral binding domain, cells were incubated with anti-Myc 9E10 antibodies (1:75 dilution) followed by a 1:750 dilution of fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME). Fluorescence images were acquired on a Leica inverted laser-scanning confocal microscope equipped with a multiband confocal imaging spectrophotometer. Density Gradient Fractionation—Sucrose density gradient fractionation was performed essentially as described by Kippenberger et al. (5Kippenberger A.G. Palmer D.J. Comer A.M. Lipski J. Burton L.D. Christie D.L. J. Neurochem. 1999; 73: 1024-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). 90% confluent cultures of PC12 cells from 2 10-cm plates were combined and homogenized in 1.4 ml of homogenization buffer (0.32 m sucrose, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.1, 0.5 mm EDTA, protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science)) using a ball-bearing cell cracker (17 passes, clearance 0.0007 in). Lysates were cleared of nuclei and unbroken cells with low speed spins (2× 10 min at 2010 × g), and 500 μl was layered over a 15-ml linear gradient of 0.6-1.6 m sucrose buffered with 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.1. Gradients were then centrifuged at 99,000 × g for 17-19 h at 4 °C (Beckman SW 40Ti rotor). One-milliliter fractions were collected from the top of tube. A high complexity yeast two-hybrid screen for Ral23V-interacting proteins resulted in the isolation of the previously characterized Ral-interacting proteins RalBP1/RLIP76 (18Jullien-Flores V. Dorseuil O. Romero F. Letourneur F. Saragosti S. Berger R. Tavitian A. Gacon G. Camonis J.H. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 66-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar, 17Sugihara K. Asano S. Tanaka K. Iwamatsu A. Okawa K. Ohta Y. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 73-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar) and revealed a novel candidate Ral effector, Exo84 (not shown). Iterative pairwise analysis revealed a specific interaction between human Exo84 and the human Ral GTPases (RalA and RalB) (Fig. 1A). Exo84 did not interact with any other tested GTPase (H-Ras, K-Ras, Rap1, Rap2, Arf1, Arf6, Rac1, Cdc42, Rab5, or Rab7), and Ral did not display an interaction with any other tested exocyst component other than Sec5 (human Sec3, Sec6, Sec8, Sec10, Sec15, and Exo70 were tested; not shown). Truncation analysis identified an aminoterminal domain (amino acids 122-333) as sufficient to interact with Ral in yeast (Fig. 1B). This domain completely overlaps with a predicted PH domain (SMART/PFAM) (Fig. 1C). As has been shown for the yeast orthologs, Exo84 associates with Sec5, a component of the exocyst we have previously defined as a Ral effector protein. As shown in Fig. 1B, the domain in Exo84 mediating interaction with Sec5 is non-overlapping with the Ral binding domain. In vitro binding assays using purified recombinant RalA and purified recombinant full-length Exo84 or the Ral binding domain of Exo84, Exo84-(122-333), established that RalA-GTP but not RalA-GDP can interact directly with Exo84 (Fig. 2A). In addition, activated Ral can associate with endogenous Exo84 in mammalian cells (Fig. 2B). Coimmunoprecipitation analysis using Ral effector domain variants reveals that the Ral/Exo84 interaction requires an intact Ral effector domain and reveals a pattern of mutation sensitivity identical to that previously observed with Ral/Sec5 interactions (Fig. 2C) (1Moskalenko S. Henry D.O. Rosse C. Mirey G. Camonis J.H. White M.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 66-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). KCl-induced membrane depolarization results in RalA activation in PC12 cells (1Moskalenko S. Henry D.O. Rosse C. Mirey G. Camonis J.H. White M.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 66-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). Consistent with an interaction between Exo84 and activated Ral in cells, membrane depolarization resulted in recruitment of the minimal Ral binding domain to membrane-proximal regions, and this was blocked by co-expression of a cytosolic activated Ral variant lacking carboxyl-terminal prenylation (Fig. 2D). These observations demonstrate that Ral forms activation-dependent complexes with two distinct subunits of the exocyst.Fig. 2Exo84 interacts with activated Ral GTPases.A, The Ral binding domain of Exo84 as defined in yeast (amino acids 122-333) or full-length Exo84 were expressed and purified from Escherichia coli as GST fusions. RalB was expressed and purified from E. coli as a poly-His6 fusion. Recombinant Ral protein was loaded in vitro with GDP or GTPγS and incubated with the indicated immobilized GST fusions. After extensive washing, complexes were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-RalB and anti-GST. B, ectopically expressed Myc-tagged RalB23V was immunoprecipitated (IP) with the 9E10 anti-myc antibody. The immunoprecipitates and whole cell lysates (WCL) were probed for the presence of Exo84 using a polyclonal anti-Exo84 antibody. C, 293T cells were transfected with the indicated untagged Ral variants together with Myc-tagged Exo84. Anti-Myc immunoprecipitates were probed for the presence of Ral and Exo84. D, PC12 cells were transfected with an Myc-tagged Ral binding domain of Exo84 (Exo84 (122-33)) alone or together with RalBΔCAAX. Cells were stimulated or not with KCl. Representative confocal images of anti-Myc immunofluorescence are shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We have previously established that amino acids 1-120 of Sec5 are sufficient to interact with Ral-GTP in vitro and in cells (1Moskalenko S. Henry D.O. Rosse C. Mirey G. Camonis J.H. White M.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 66-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3A, an adjacent non-overlapping region of Sec5 (amino acids 120-333) is sufficient to interact with Exo84. Together with the observation of non-overlapping Ral binding domains and Sec5 binding domains in Exo84, this suggests that Sec5 and Exo84 may have the capacity to independently associate with each other and with activated Ral proteins. Consistent with this, we see no inhibition of the formation of Exo84/Sec5 complexes in cells upon expression of activated RalA (Fig. 3B) despite the presence of significant amounts of RalA in the immunoprecipitates. Therefore, Ral activation likely does not restrict Exo84/Sec5 association. Rather, it may facilitate native complex assembly through stimulus-dependent recruitment of the Sec5 and Exo84 subunits. As described above, SMART (20Schultz J. Copley R.R. Doerks T. Ponting C.P. Bork P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 231-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (1057) Google Scholar) and PFAM (21Yaffe M.B. Leparc G.G. Lai J. Obata T. Volinia S. Cantley L.C. Nat. Biotechnol. 2001; 19: 348-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar) algorithms predict a PH domain in Exo84 located in the middle of the empirically defined Ral binding domain (122-333). PH domains can associate with phosphatidylinositides and have been implicated in regulating recruitment of proteins to membranes and in regulating conformational changes within molecules containing PH domains that can modulate activity (22Lemmon M.A. Ferguson K.M. Schlessinger J. Cell. 1996; 85: 621-624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar, 23Ingley E. Hemmings B.A. J. Cell.

Sci. 1999; 24: 441-445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The presence of a bona fide PH domain in Exo84 could contribute to compartmentalization of the protein and/or to regulation of assembly of Exo84 into an exocyst complex. We first tested the capacity of the predicted PH domain in Exo84 to interact with phospholipids in vitro. Radiolabeled liposomes (20 μCi of l-3-phosphatidyl[N-methyl-H3]choline,12-dipalmitoyl) containing either phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate or PI3,4,5P3 could be precipitated with recombinant GST-Exo84-(122-333) glutathione-agarose (Fig. 4A) with a small preference for PI3,4,5P3. In addition, incubation of Exo84-(122-333) with PI3,4,5P3-containing liposomes allowed a significant fraction of the Exo84 to float up a Nycodenz density gradient (Fig. 4B, compare PI liposomes (bottom panel) to PI3,4,5P3 liposomes (top panel)). Because the PH domain of Exo84 overlaps with the Ral binding domain, we examined the consequences of recombinant Ral-GTP and Ral-GDP on in vitro association of Exo84-(122-333) with phosphoinositides. As shown in Fig. 4C, Ral-GTP can compete with PI3,4,5P3-containing liposomes for association with Exo84. As far as we are aware, this is the first observation of an activation-dependent association of a small G-protein with a PH domain and may represent a novel mechanism for GTPase-dependent regulation of protein/lipid interactions. Work in yeast suggests that the exocyst may be a dynamic complex, with subsets of components forming both a targeting patch on the plasma membrane and a subcomplex on secretory vesicles (10Guo W. Sacher M. Barrowman J. Ferro-Novick S. Novick P. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 251-255Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 13Guo W. Roth D. Walch-Solimena C. Novick P.

Chem. 1999; 274: 23558-23564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Analysis of protein interactions and subunit compartmentalization suggests that yeast Sec 15, Sec10, and Exo84 are on a vesicle-associated subcomplex that may function as a bridge between secretory vesicles and their sites of fusion (13Guo W. Roth D. Walch-Solimena C. Novick P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1071-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar, 25Guo W. Grant A. Novick P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23558-23564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). In yeast, formation of this bridge appears to be regulated by the Sec4 GTPase (13Guo W. Roth D. Walch-Solimena C. Novick P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1071-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). Loss of RalA expression in human cells inhibits assembly of Sec10 into a complex with Sec6 but does not affect plasma membrane compartmentalization of Sec6 (1Moskalenko S. Henry D.O. Rosse C. Mirey G. Camonis J.H. White M.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 66-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). This together with the observation that Ral GTPases can interact with two different components of the exocyst (Sec5 and Exo84) suggests that, like yeast, the human exocyst may be a dynamic complex, the assembly of which is regulated by Ral GTPases. To begin to address the possibility that components of the mammalian exocyst may exist in subcomplexes before secretory vesicle targeting, we examined the relative distribution of endogenous exocyst components on linear 0.6-1.2 m sucrose gradients. We chose to examine PC12 cells given our earlier observations implicating Ral in the regulation of stimulus-dependent exocytosis (1Moskalenko S. Henry D.O. Rosse C. Mirey G. Camonis J.H. White M.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 66-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). Fractions from detergent-free mechanical lysates were blotted with synaptophysin as a secretory/dense core vesicle marker and (Na+K+)-ATPase as a plasma membrane marker and with the indicated exocyst subunits. As shown in Fig. 5A, the Sec5 signal peaks together with Sec6, although Sec5 shows a tighter distribution on the gradient. In contrast, the majority of Exo84 is in the top half of the gradient together with Sec10. This migration is most likely due to the association of Exo84 and Sec10 with a light membrane fraction, because Exo84 sediments during differential centrifugation (Fig. 5B). RalA protein appears to be distributed across the gradient with two peaks, one of which co migrates with the secretory vesicle marker synaptophysin. A population of slower migrating RalA, which may lack prenyl group modification, remains in the top of the gradient together with Sec10 and Exo84. The distinct distribution of Exo84 relative to Sec5 suggests that, as in yeast, exocyst subunits exist in subcomplexes in cells. Cofractionation of Exo84 together with Sec10 versus cofractionation of Sec5 together with Sec6 places the two Ral effectors on each of the presumed exocyst subcomplexes, suggesting that a subpopulation of Ral may regulate the full complex assembly interface. Consistent with action of Exo84 at the octameric exocyst complex assembly interface, inhibition of native Exo84 expression reduced complex formation between Sec6 and Sec10 (Fig. 6).Fig. 6Exo84-dependent assembly of Sec6·Sec10 complexes. HeLa cells were transfected with siRNAs targeting human Exo84 or mouse caveolin1 (mCav). 72 h post-transfection cells were harvested, and endogenous Sec6 was immunoprecipitated from non-denaturing lysates. The immunoprecipitates were probed for the presence of Sec6 and Sec10. Whole cell lysates (WCL) were probed with anti-Exo84 to monitor effectiveness of siRNA treatment.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In yeast, Exo84 is required for exocytosis and interacts with Sec10 and Sec5. Exo84 localization with sites of active exocytosis on the plasma membrane is Sec5-dependent. However, Exo84 association with Sec10 is not (25Guo W. Grant A. Novick P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23558-23564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Sec10 in turn is associated with Sec15, an exocyst subunit localized to secretory vesicles (13Guo W. Roth D. Walch-Solimena C. Novick P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1071-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar), whereas Sec5 is plasma membrane localized independently of Exo84 (25Guo W. Grant A. Novick P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23558-23564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). As mentioned above these observations suggest that in yeast there may be a subcomplex of Exo84, Sec10, and Sec15 required to bridge secretory vesicles to an exocyst-targeting patch on the plasma membrane (that includes Sec5, Sec6, Sec8, Sec3, and Exo70) (10Guo W. Sacher M. Barrowman J. Ferro-Novick S. Novick P. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 251-255Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Exo84 and Sec5 may function at the assembly interface, because overexpression of Exo84 can partially complement the secretion defect of a temperature-sensitive Sec5 mutant. The observations described in this study are consistent with a similar exocyst anatomy in mammalian cells and suggest a rough working hypothesis for the contribution of Ral GTPases to exocyst function; that is, that the dual association of Ral-GTP with Exo84 and Sec5 regulates the assembly of a full exocyst complex to tether secretory vesicles before docking and fusion (Fig. 7). Recent observations suggest that subsequent coupling of the exocyst to fusion machinery may be regulated by another small G-protein, TC10, through interaction with Exo70 (26Inoue M. Chang L. Hwang J. Chiang S.H. Saltiel A.R. Nature. 2003; 422: 629-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). The biophysical nature of dynamic Ral-dependent exocyst assembly remains to be determined. However, the observations described here will facilitate further studies directed at defining dynamic control of exocyst function and the contribution of Ral GTPases to regulated vesicle trafficking.

In the canonical signaling pathway, receptor activation triggers the exchange of GTP for GDP by the Gα subunit of the heterotrimeric G-protein, causing a conformational change in the Gα subunits. GTP-bound Gα and free Gβγ subunits then bind and activate downstream effectors (18.Gutkind J.S. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1331-1342Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar).

Lipid products of PI 3-kinase have been implicated in diverse cellular processes such as membrane ruffling and cell growth (32.Krugmann S. Welch H. Curr.

Downstream of PI 3-kinase is the serine-threonine kinase, protein kinase B/Akt, which like PI 3-kinase has been implicated in a wide array of cellular processes (33.Coffer P.J. Jin J. Woodgett J.R.

Moreover, recent data suggest that the Akt pathway may be involved in endothelin signaling pathways that control cell survival (36.Su X. Wang P. Ibitayo A. Bitar K.N. Am. J.

The relationship between NO and endothelins in the control of vascular tone, although physiologically important (38.Luscher T.F. Yang Z. Tschudi M. von Segesser L. Stulz P. Boulanger C. Siebenmann R.

In particular, the link between ETB receptor activation and NO synthesis and the signaling cascade that leads to NO genesis remains poorly characterized. Given data suggesting that GPCRs can signal to PI 3-kinase, and that ET-1 is capable of signaling to Akt, we have hypothesized that one potential link between ET-1, ETB receptor, and NO synthesis is the Akt signaling pathway. We have examined primary isolates of sinusoidal endothelial cells, which, as for vascular endothelial cells, are known to possess only ETB receptors and to express eNOS (39.Rockey D.C. Chung J.J.

Endothelial cells, present in the lower layer, were further purified by centrifugal elutriation (18 ml/min flow) and were grown in medium containing 20% serum (10% horse/calf). To verify the purity of endothelial cells, we routinely document their uptake of fluorescently labeled di-I-acetoacetylated low density lipoprotein as described (43.Pitas R.E. Boyles J. Mahley R.W. Bissell D.M. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 100: 103-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Additionally, endothelial isolates were probed with anti-CD31 (BD Biosciences, San Diego, CA). Contamination with stellate cells and/or Kupffer cells was detected by immunolabeling with anti-desmin (Dako, Carpenteria, CA) (44.Yokoi Y. Namihisa T. Kuroda H. Komatsu I. Miyazaki A. Watanabe S. Usui K. Hepatology. 1984; 4: 709-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar) and a specific antibody (45.Bodenheimer H.C.J. Faris R.A. Charland C. Hixson D.C. Hepatology. 1988; 8: 1667-1672Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) as described (46.Rockey D.C. Chung J.J. J. Investig. Med. 1994; 42: 660-670PubMed Google Scholar). These methods demonstrated that the purity of primary endothelial cell isolates was greater than 95%; all experiments were performed with primary cells. Adenoviral Gene Transfer—Recombinant adenovirus particles were purified from infected 293 cells by lysis in virus storage buffer followed by two sequential rounds of ultracentrifugation in CsCl gradients. Viral titers were measured by standard plaque assay using 293 cells. Sinusoidal endothelial cells were infected with a replication defective adenovirus that expresses myristoylated constitutively active Akt (Ad-myr.Akt), a dominant negative Akt construct (Ad-dn.Akt) containing mutations at amino acid 308 (T → A) and amino acid 473 (S → A) (provided by Dr. Ken Walsh, Boston University Medical Center) (47.Fujio Y. Guo K. Mano T. Mitsuuchi Y. Testa J.R. Walsh K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5073-5082Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar) or an identical adenovirus without vector DNA (Ad-EV) at a multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) of 250. Recombinant adenovirus containing a construct encoding a cDNA corresponding to the carboxyl terminus fragment of bovine GRK2 (48.Koch W.J. Inglese J. Stone W.C. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8256-8260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Ad-GRK2CT) was used to infect cells (also m.o.i. of 250). Recombinant adenovirus containing a construct encoding a cDNA corresponding to PTEN, and an identical adenovirus without cDNA was as described (49.Huang J. Kontos C.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10760-10766Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar) (each at an m.o.i. of 100). For cellular transduction of adenovirus, sinusoidal endothelial cell were plated at a density of 1 × 106 cells/ml in 35- or 60-mm collagen-coated culture dishes and exposed to adenovirus in 2% serum for 16 h at 37 °C. Subsequently, adenovirus-containing medium was exchanged and cells were harvested at the indicated time points. NO Measurement—Medium was collected from sinusoidal endothelial cells after indicated treatment. To assess NO production, we analyzed the release of nitrite, the stable breakdown product of NO, using a Sievers Chemiluminescence NO Analyzer (Sievers Instruments, Inc., Boulder, CO). Measurements of known concentrations of nitrite were used to generate a standard curve between 25 and 500 pmol of nitrite. Immunoblotting—Sinusoidal endothelial cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and total cell lysates were prepared by scraping cells in lysis buffer (137 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0) containing protease inhibitors (1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm NaF, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin). Lysates were subjected to SDS-PAGE, proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose, and specific epitopes were detected with specific primary antibody. Bound primary antibody was detected using a chemiluminescent detection kit (Tropix, Inc., Bedford, MA) over a linear range. Specific bands were scanned and quantitated by densitometry (Quantity One, Bio-Rad). Statistics—All results were expressed as the mean ± S.E. All experiments were performed in replicates utilizing cell isolates from different rats. Statistical analysis was performed using the two-tailed Student's t test, and p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Endothelin Receptor Activation Leads to Akt Phosphorylation—We initially investigated whether endothelin receptor activation led to Akt phosphorylation in sinusoidal endothelial cells. Exposure of sinusoidal endothelial cells to ET-1 (which has equal affinity for either the ETA or ETB receptor) or sarafotoxin S6C (which binds only to the ETB receptor) (50.Sakurai T. Yanagisawa M. Masaki T. Trends. Pharmacol. Sci. 1992; 13: 103-108Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar), led to significant increases in Akt phosphorylation at serine 473 (Fig. 1, A and B). PDGF leads to phosphorylation of tyrosine residues (Tyr-740 and Tyr-751) on the PDGF B-receptor and activates the lipid kinase activity of PI 3-kinases, formation of PI (3,4,5)-P3 and activation of Akt. Importantly, PDGF also stimulated Akt phosphorylation, consistent with previous data (9.Dimmeler S. Fleming I. Fisslthaler B. Hermann C. Busse R. Zeiher A.M. Nature. 1999; 399: 601-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (3056) Google Scholar, 10.Fulton D. Gratton J.P. McCabe T.J. Fontana J. Fujio Y. Walsh K. Franke T.F. Papapetropoulos A. Sessa W.C. Nature. 1999; 399: 597-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (2239) Google Scholar). As expected, blockade of the ETB receptor with the specific ETB receptor antagonist BQ-788 inhibited ET-1-mediated Akt phosphorylation (Fig. 1B), emphasizing that in sinusoidal endothelial cells, ET-1-mediated Akt activation proceeds via ETB activation rather than ETA receptor signaling. A unique property of the endothelin and endothelin receptor interaction is tight binding and a slow rate of dissociation (51.Hirata Y. Yoshimi H. Takaichi S. Yanagisawa M. Masaki T. FEBS Lett. 1988; 239: 13-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). This property results in prolonged physiologic activity of ET-1, despite a relatively short half-life (52.Anggard E. Galton S. Rae G. Thomas R. McLoughlin L. de Nucci G. Vane J.R. J. Cardiovasc. Pharmacol. 1989; 13 (–S49; discussion S74): S46Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Furthermore, dissociation rates and signaling activity vary among cells from different tissues (53.Galron R. Bdolah A. Kochva E. Wollberg Z. Kloog Y. Sokolovsky M. FEBS Lett. 1991; 283: 11-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In sinusoidal endothelial cells, Akt phosphorylation occurred within minutes of endothelin receptor binding, peaked at 30 min, and subsequently declined (Fig. 1C), consistent with rapid signaling as well as rapid induction of inhibitory pathways. ETB Activation Induces eNOS Phosphorylation and NO Production—A number of studies have indicated that endothelial nitric-oxide synthase (eNOS) is an important Akt substrate and that eNOS is activated by phosphorylated Akt (9.Dimmeler S. Fleming I. Fisslthaler B. Hermann C. Busse R. Zeiher A.M. Nature. 1999; 399: 601-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (3056) Google Scholar, 10.Fulton D. Gratton J.P. McCabe T.J. Fontana J. Fujio Y. Walsh K. Franke T.F. Papapetropoulos A. Sessa W.C. Nature. 1999; 399: 597-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (2239) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined whether ET-1-induced Akt activation led to phosphorylation of eNOS as well as NO release in sinusoidal endothelial cells. We found that ETB receptor activation led to Akt phosphorylation and caused eNOS to be phosphorylated at serine 1179 (Fig. 2A). ET-1 induced not only Akt phosphorylation, but it also led to production of nitrite, indicative of NO synthesis (Fig. 2B). Likewise, stimulation of ETB receptors with sarafotoxin S6C led to eNOS phosphorylation (not shown) and NO synthesis (Fig. 2B). Interestingly, PDGF did not induce NO production in sinusoidal endothelial cells (Fig. 2B). Furthermore, exposure to endothelins and PDGF did not alter the level of total Akt protein expression or total eNOS protein expression (Fig. 1A). These results further substantiate the finding that ET-1 causes NO production in sinusoidal endothelial cells as a result of Akt activation and eNOS phosphorylation. ET-1 Induces NO Synthesis via a PI 3-Kinase/Akt Pathway—To further characterize the role of the PI 3-kinase/Akt pathway in endothelin-mediated NO synthesis, we examined ETB-induced Akt and eNOS phosphorylation and NO synthesis after PI 3-kinase inhibition. LY29004, a specific inhibitor of PI 3-kinase, prevented ET-1-mediated Akt phosphorylation (Fig. 3A), including at all time points after exposure to ET-1 (Fig. 3B). Additionally, LY29004 efficiently inhibited NO production (Fig. 3C); of note, NO appeared to be produced rapidly after ETB receptor activation (nitrite levels were measured in conditioned medium so that total nitrite levels increased incrementally over time). As expected, LY29004 inhibited PDGF-induced Akt phosphorylation (Fig. 3A) but had no effect on total Akt expression. Modulation of PI 3-Kinase Activation by PTEN—The inositol 3′-phosphatase, PTEN, which hydrolyzes PI 3-kinase lipid products phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate and phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate, functions in opposition to PI 3-kinase (54.Myers M.P. Stolarov J.P. Eng C. Li J. Wang S.I. Wigler M.H. Parsons R. Tonks N.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9052-9057Crossref PubMed Scopus (738) Google Scholar, 55.Cantley L.C. Neel B.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4240-4245Crossref PubMed Scopus (1754) Google Scholar). Therefore, to further assess the role of ET-1 in activation of PI 3-kinase, we examined the effect of overexpression of a wild-type PTEN construct in sinusoidal endothelial cells stimulated with ET-1. ET-1-mediated phosphorylation of Akt in sinusoidal endothelial cells was inhibited by overexpression of wild-type PTEN (Fig. 4), further confirming that ET-1-mediated activation of Akt is PI 3-kinase-dependent. A Direct Effect of Akt on NO Production—To assess the specific role of Akt activation in ETB receptor-mediated signaling to NO, we examined the effect of dominant negative and dominant active Akt constructs (47.Fujio Y. Guo K. Mano T. Mitsuuchi Y. Testa J.R. Walsh K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5073-5082Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 56.Pierce K.L. Premont R.T. Lefkowitz R.J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 639-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (2125) Google Scholar). Expression of a dominant negative Akt construct inhibited ET-1-mediated Akt phosphorylation (Fig. 5A) and NO production (Fig. 5B). As expected, overexpression of dominant active Akt led to enhanced Akt phosphorylation; this subsequently led to an increase in NO synthesis (Fig. 5, A and B). A negative control (an identical adenovirus vector without insert DNA) failed to induce Akt phosphorylation or NO synthesis. Interestingly, the additional effect of ET-1 on both Akt phosphorylation and NO synthesis was minimal when active Akt was expressed (Fig. 5, A and B). ET-1 Stimulated Akt Phosphorylation Is Pertussis Toxin-sensitive—Sequence homology and hydropathic analysis of endothelin receptor primary structure suggests that the known endothelin receptors belong to the rhodopsin class of GPCRs (41.Sakurai T. Yanagisawa M. Takuwa Y. Miyazaki H. Kimura S. Goto K. Masaki T. Nature. 1990; 348: 732-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (2366) Google Scholar, 56.Pierce K.L. Premont R.T. Lefkowitz R.J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 639-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (2125) Google Scholar, 57.Arai H. Hori S. Aramori I. Ohkubo H. Nakanishi S. Nature. 1990; 348: 730-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (2513) Google Scholar). Pathways downstream of GPCRs have been classified as either pertussis toxin (PTX)-sensitive (i.e. coupled to Gαi/o) or PTX-insensitive (i.e. coupled to Gαq/11, Gαs, or Gα12/13) (56.Pierce K.L. Premont R.T. Lefkowitz R.J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 639-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (2125) Google Scholar, 58.Albert P.R. Robillard L. Cell Signal. 2002; 14: 407-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 59.Ribas C. Sato M. Hildebrandt J.D. Lanier S.M. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 344: 140-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). PTX catalyzes the ADP-ribosylation of the alpha subunits of heterotrimeric guanine regulatory proteins Gi, Go, and Gt. This prevents these specific G-proteins from interacting with their activating receptors and thus prevents propagation of downstream receptor signals. We found that PTX pretreatment inhibited ET-1-induced Akt phosphorylation (Fig. 6), suggesting that Akt phosphorylation after ETB receptor stimulation is linked to Gi/o. Notably, PTX did not influence basal Akt or phospho-Akt levels (Fig. 6). G-proteins Are Critically Linked to NO Signaling—We demonstrated that ET-1 stimulates Akt and eNOS through a Gi/o-coupled mechanism. Because activation of Gi/o-coupled receptors leads to dissociation of activated Gαi/o and G-protein βγ subunits (56.Pierce K.L. Premont R.T. Lefkowitz R.J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 639-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (2125) Google Scholar, 59.Ribas C. Sato M. Hildebrandt J.D. Lanier S.M. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 344: 140-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar, 60.Clapham D.E. Neer E.J. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1997; 37: 167-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that Akt phosphorylation was dependent on G-protein βγ subunit signaling in this system. To test this postulate, we utilized a construct coding for the carboxyl terminus of G-protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 (GRK2CT), which binds to G-protein βγ subunits and prevents their downstream signaling (48.Koch W.J. Inglese J. Stone W.C. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8256-8260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Transduction of sinusoidal endothelial cells with an adenovirus expressing this construct abrogated ET-1-induced Akt phosphorylation and NO production (Fig. 7, A and B). These findings suggest that G-protein βγ subunits rather than Gαi/o subunits contribute to the ET-1-dependent activation of Akt. ET-1 Stimulation of eNOS Is Protein-tyrosine Kinase-independent—Non-receptor tyrosine protein kinases have been shown to exhibit cross-talk with G-protein coupled receptor-signaling cascades (31.Luttrell L.M. Ferguson S.S. Daaka Y. Miller W.E. Maudsley S. Della Rocca G.J. Lin F. Kawakatsu H. Owada K. Luttrell D.K. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Science. 1999; 283: 655-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (1264) Google Scholar). Therefore, we postulated that non-receptor tyrosine protein kinases might have a role in ET-1-mediated signaling. However, we found that, although the tyrosine kinase inhibitor, genistein, inhibited PDGF (a well known inducer of Akt)-mediated Akt phosphorylation, it had no effect on ET-1-mediated activation of Akt (Fig. 8A). Additionally, inhibition of protein-tyrosine kinases with genistein had no effect on NO production by sinusoidal endothelial cells (Fig. 8B). These data support the concept that ET-1-mediated Akt phosphorylation and NO production is G-protein-dependent and does not involve a tyrosine kinase pathway. The endothelins comprise a family of 21-amino acid peptides that activate specific G-protein-coupled receptors in a variety of cell types to regulate blood flow and multiple other physiologic effects (61.Rubanyi G.M. Polokoff M.A. Pharmacol. Rev. 1994; 46: 325-415PubMed Google Scholar). The physiologic effects of ET-1 are mediated by at least two types of endothelin receptors, designated ETA and ETB. It is commonly accepted that stimulation of ETB receptors leads to NO production in endothelial cells. However, the signaling pathways linking the ETB receptor to NO have been poorly characterized. In this study, we have elucidated a potential mechanism linking endothelin-mediated activation of ETB receptors and eNOS (and thus, NO). We show that Akt plays a central role in this process, consistent with previous data demonstrating that Akt phosphorylation leads to eNOS phosphorylation and subsequent activation of eNOS enzymatic activity (10.Fulton D. Gratton J.P. McCabe T.J. Fontana J. Fujio Y. Walsh K. Franke T.F. Papapetropoulos A. Sessa W.C. Nature. 1999; 399: 597-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (2239) Google Scholar, 62.Luo Z. Fujio Y. Kureishi Y. Rudic R.D. Daumerie G. Fulton D. Sessa W.C. Walsh K. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 106: 493-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Moreover, we reveal that heterotrimeric G-protein βγ subunits released from receptors-activated Gi/o-coupled receptors represent the critical connection to Akt, and thus eNOS. Previous data have shown that ET-1 activates several intracellular signal pathways, including adenylyl cyclase, phospholipase C, protein kinase Cs, and the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades (20.Simonson M.S. Herman W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9347-9357Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21.Herman W.H. Simonson M.S. J. Biol.

Iourgenko V. Fouassier L. Dhumeaux D. Mavier P. Lotersztajn S. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 2771-2778Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Here, we have extended the ET-1 signaling paradigm to include Akt, eNOS, and NO. We utilized several different approaches to elucidate the critical role of Akt in endothelin-mediated activation of eNOS. First, we demonstrated that Akt phosphorylation paralleled closely eNOS phosphorylation after stimulation with ET-1. Second, we showed that a dominant negative Akt construct abrogated ET-1 phosphorylation of Akt and eNOS. A central role for Akt in endothelin-mediated NO production was further supported by pharmacologic inhibition of PI 3-kinase with LY294002, because Akt activation is known to be PI 3-kinase-dependent. Finally, we demonstrated that ET-1-mediated activation of Akt was inhibited by the potent lipid phosphatase, PTEN (54.Myers M.P. Stolarov J.P. Eng C. Li J. Wang S.I. Wigler M.H. Parsons R. Tonks N.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9052-9057Crossref PubMed Scopus (738) Google Scholar, 64.Tamura M. Gu J. Matsumoto K. Aota S. Parsons R. Yamada K.M. Science. 1998; 280: 1614-1617Crossref PubMed Scopus (1082) Google Scholar), which dephosphorylates the 3′-phosphoinositide products of PI 3-kinase, phosphatidylinositol 3,4-biphosphate, and phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-triphosphate (55.Cantley L.C. Neel B.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4240-4245Crossref PubMed Scopus (1754) Google Scholar) and has been shown to regulate vascular epidermal growth factor-mediated PI 3-kinase signaling in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (49.Huang J. Kontos C.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10760-10766Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Inhibition of endothelin-mediated eNOS activation by PTEN indicates that this process is dependent on 3-phosphoinositide production by PI 3-kinase. Extensive data from previous studies (56.Pierce K.L. Premont R.T. Lefkowitz R.J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 639-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (2125) Google Scholar, 61.Rubanyi G.M. Polokoff M.A. Pharmacol. Rev. 1994; 46: 325-415PubMed Google Scholar) have linked ET-1 to canonical GPCR signaling pathways. Here, we have extended this work to emphasize the central role not only of βγ subunits, but also GRK2. Additionally, we demonstrated that PTX, which catalyzes the ADP-ribosylation of the Gi family alpha subunits and thereby interrupts Gi βγ subunit function, effectively abrogates ET-1-mediated Akt phosphorylation and NO production. Taken together, these data point to a critical role for βγ subunits in the signaling cascade. Although the data using the dominant negative GRK2CT construct, which selectively binds to and inhibits the function of βγ subunits, provides convincing evidence for the involvement of βγ subunits in the signaling cascade, it should be emphasized that our studies do not unequivocally exclude a role for Gα subunits. Selective inhibition of Gαi/o would be an attractive approach; however, it is not possible to inhibit Gαi/o without also inhibiting βγ. Nonetheless, βγ subunits appear to be necessary for Akt phosphorylation and eNOS activation after endothelin binding. Our data as well as previous work emphasize a mechanism by which GPCR activation leads to Akt phosphorylation; for example, PI 3-kinase activation appears to proceed via heterotrimeric G-protein βγ signaling (Fig. 9). Supporting the presence of this signaling pathway are previous data that demonstrate a direct interaction of βγ subunits with the catalytic domain of the PI 3-kinase γ isoform (65.Lopez-Ilasaca M. Gutkind J.S. Wetzker R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2505-2508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). In addition, cardiac hypertrophy led to βγ subunit-dependent activation of PI 3-kinase (66.Naga Prasad S.V. Esposito G. Mao L. Koch W.J. Rockman H.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4693-4698Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Such data are highly consistent with our findings, which emphasize a specific and novel endothelin-mediated pathway involving βγ subunit recruitment and activation of PI 3-kinase with downstream phosphorylation of Akt and eNOS. Although GPCR activation has been shown to lead to Akt activation via PI 3-kinase γ (67.Naga Prasad S.V. Barak L.S. Rapacciuolo A. Caron M.G. Rockman H.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18953-18959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), PI 3-kinase/Akt is well known to be linked to tyrosine kinase phosphorylation (55.Cantley L.C. Neel B.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4240-4245Crossref PubMed Scopus (1754) Google Scholar). For example, PDGF, a classic tyrosine kinase inducer, stimulates recruitment and activation of PI 3-kinase α via its p85 regulatory subunit and subsequent Akt phosphorylation (68.van Weering D.H. de Rooij J. Marte B. Downward J. Bos J.L. Burgering B.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1802-1811Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 69.Kohn A.D. Takeuchi F. Roth R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21920-21926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). We found that endothelin-mediated Akt activation and NO production were not affected by the tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein, supporting the observation that ETB receptors signal through PI 3-kinase γ. Furthermore, in our system, PDGF activated Akt but had no effect on eNOS. To our knowledge, this is the first report documenting a mechanism linking ETB receptor activation directly to Akt and eNOS activation in an endothelial cell system. The work extends that of others in which it has been shown that ET-1 can stimulate NO synthesis in isolated endothelial cells (14.Tsukahara H. Ende H. Magazine H.I. Bahou W.F. Goligorsky M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21778-21785Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is notable that we have failed to identify NO production in a variety of transformed endothelial cell lines. 2S. Liu, R. T. Premont, C. D. Kontos, J. Huang, and D. C. Rockey, unpublished observation. Thus, a major advantage of the current study is that it utilized only primary cell isolates. In the context of the data presented, we further postulate that primary cells and cell lines possess dissimilar endothelin signaling pathways. Finally, the current data not only emphasize an important endothelin signaling pathway but also highlight a unique system with which to examine endothelin/NO-coupled signaling.

The involvement of Cdx-1 and Cdx-2 in the intestinal development and their role in transcription of several intestinal genes support the hypothesis that Cdx-1 and/or Cdx-2 play important roles in the aberrant intestinal differentiation program of intestinal metaplasia and gastric carcinoma. To clarify the mechanisms of transcriptional regulation of the MUC2 mucin gene in gastric cells, pGL3 deletion constructs covering 2.6 kb of the human MUC2 promoter were used in transient transfection assays, enabling us to identify a relevant region for MUC2 transcription in all gastric cell lines. To evaluate the role of Cdx-1 and Cdx-2 in MUC2 transcription we performed co-transfection experiments with expression vectors encoding Cdx-1 and Cdx-2. In two of the four gastric carcinoma cell lines and in all colon carcinoma cell lines we observed transactivation of the MUC2 promoter by Cdx-2. Using gel shift assays we identified two Cdx-2 binding sites at –177/–171 and –191/–187. Only simultaneous mutation of the two sites resulted in inhibition of Cdx-2-mediated transactivation of MUC2 promoter, implying that both Cdx-2 sites are active. Finally, stable expression of Cdx-2 in a gastric cell line initially not expressing Cdx-2, led to induction of MUC2 expression. In conclusion, this work demonstrates that Cdx-2 activates the expression of MUC2 mucin gene in gastric cells, inducing an intestinal transdifferentiation phenotype that parallels what is observed both in intestinal metaplasia and some gastric carcinomas.

There is consistent data indicating that in human stomach as well as in other organs mucin genes are expressed in a regulated cell- and tissue-specific manner and that altered mucin gene expression occurs in cancer and precancerous lesions (1Van Seuningen I.

However, information on MUC2 transcriptional regulation in gastric cells, in relation with the overexpression of MUC2 in intestinal metaplasia and gastric carcinoma, is essentially unknown.The intestine-specific homeobox genes Cdx-1 1The abbreviations used are: Cdx-1caudal-related homeobox factor 1GAPDHglyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenaseSIF1sucrase-isomaltase footprint 15′-UTR5′-untranslated regionEMSAelectrophoretic mobility shift assayRTreverse transcriptase.1The abbreviations used are: Cdx-1caudal-related homeobox factor 1GAPDHglyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenaseSIF1sucrase-isomaltase footprint 15′-UTR5′-untranslated regionEMSAelectrophoretic mobility shift assayRTreverse transcriptase. and Cdx-2 were also recently shown to be aberrantly expressed in intestinal metaplasia and in a subset of gastric carcinomas. Both in intestinal metaplasia and in gastric carcinoma, expression of Cdx-1 and Cdx-2 is closely associated with the expression of mucin MUC2 (23Almeida R. Silva E. Santos-Silva F. Silberg D.G. Wang J. de Bolós C. David L. J. Pathol. 2003; 199: 36-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Altogether, these observations suggest that Cdx-1 and/or Cdx-2 play important roles in the aberrant intestinal differentiation program of intestinal metaplasia and some gastric carcinomas, partly due to MUC2 regulation at the transcriptional level (23Almeida R. Silva E. Santos-Silva F. Silberg D.G. Wang J. de Bolós C. David L. J. Pathol. 2003; 199: 36-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). This hypothesis is further supported by the direct involvement of Cdx-1 and Cdx-2 in the differentiation of intestinal epithelial cells (24Suh E. Traber P.G. Mol. Cell.

In this study we show that Cdx-2 is a regulator of MUC2 expression both in gastric and intestinal cancer cells whereas Cdx-1 only transactivates MUC2 in intestinal cells. The implications in intestinal metaplasia and gastrointestinal cell differentiation are discussed.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture—Human gastric carcinoma cell lines were cultured at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator. GP202, GP220, and MKN45 cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium (with Glutamax and 25 mm Hepes) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and gentamicin (50 μg/ml). KATOIII cell line was maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum and gentamicin (50 μg/ml). AGS cell line was cultured in Nutrient Mixture Ham's F12 (with l-Glutamine) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and gentamicin (50 μg/ml).

Four microliters of this mixture was PCR-amplified in a 25-μl reaction using AmpliTaq DNA polymerase (Applied Biosystems). The sequences of the primers used to amplify MUC2, Cdx-1 and Cdx-2 are indicated in Table I. GAPDH was used as an internal standard.

Cells were harvested at 100% of confluence and 1.5 μg of total RNA was used to prepare cDNA (Advantage™ RT-for-PCR kit, Clontech) as described before (34Van Seuningen I. Perrais M. Pigny P. Porchet N. Aubert J.P. Biochem. J. 2000; 348: 675-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). PCR was performed on 2 μl of cDNA using specific pairs of primers (MWG-Biotech, Germany) for MUC2, Cdx-1, Cdx-2, and 28 S rRNA as described in Table I. PCR reactions were carried out in 50-μl final solutions (5 μl of 10× PCR buffer containing MgCl2, 4 μl 2.5 mm dNTPs, 10 pmol of each primer, 1 unit of Taq polymerase (Roche Applied Science)). Cycling conditions were as follows: 1) denaturation: 94 °C, 2 min for one cycle; 2) denaturation: 94 °C, 45 s; annealing: 60 °C, 1 min; and extension: 72 °C, 1 min for 30 cycles; and 3) final extension: 72 °C, 10 min. PCR products were analyzed on 2% ethidium bromide-agarose gels run in 1× Tris borate-EDTA buffer.MUC2/Luciferase Plasmid Construction and Transient Transfection Assays—pGL3-MUC2 promoter constructs covering the –947/–1, –2096/+27, and –2627/–1 regions of MUC2 promoter were previously described and used to study MUC2 regulation in the mucoepidermoid NCI-H292 lung cancer cell line (19Perrais M.

Chem. 2002; 277: 32258-32267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). –371/+27 and –947/+27 deletion mutants used in this study were prepared as described in Perrais et al. (19Perrais M. Pigny P. Copin M.C. Aubert J.P. Van Seuningen I. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32258-32267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). For the transient transfection assays, gastric carcinoma cell lines were seeded at 2.5 × 105/well in 24-well plates. Transfections and co-transfections were performed the next day by mixing 0.8 μg of the pGL3 construct of interest, and 0.4 μg of expression vector in the co-transfections, with tfx-50 reagent (Promega) (tfx-50:DNA ratio of 4:1) in 200 μl of serum-free and antibiotic-free medium. Cells were incubated with the transfection mixture for 1 h at 37 °C followed by the addition of 1 ml of complete medium. Total cell extracts were prepared after a 48 h incubation at 37 °C using 1× reporter lysis buffer (Promega), as described in the manufacturer's instruction manual. 20 μl of cell extract were mixed with 100 μl of luciferase assay reagent (Promega) to determine luciferase activity in a 1450 Microbeta luminescence counter (Wallac). The β-galactosidase activity was measured using 50 μl of cell extract. The luciferase activity of test plasmids is expressed as fold of induction of the test plasmid activity compared with that of the corresponding empty vector (pGL3 basic, Promega), after correction for transfection efficiency as measured by the β-galactosidase activity. Each plasmid was assayed in triplicate in two separate experiments. Transfection of colon carcinoma cell lines was performed as described in Perrais et al. (19Perrais M. Pigny P. Copin M.C. Aubert J.P. Van Seuningen I. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32258-32267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar).Stable Transfections with Cdx-2—The gastric carcinoma cell line, GP202, was transfected at confluence with 10 μg of the Cdx-2 expression vector (pRC/CMV-Cdx-2), or the empty vector pRC/CMV (mock cells). Transfections were performed with tfx-50 reagent (Promega) (tfx-50:DNA ratio of 4:1) and the procedure was as previously described for transient transfections. After 48 h, transfected cells were selected with the antibiotic G418 (Sigma) at a final concentration of 0.5 mg/ml.Site-directed Mutagenesis—QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) was used to generate site-specific mutations in the two Cdx-2 binding sites in the MUC2 promoter constructs –371/+27 and –947/+27. Single and double mutations were realized for each construct. Oligonucleotides containing the desired mutations were designed according to the manufacturer's instructions and their sequences are depicted in Table I.Nuclear Extract Preparation and Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—Nuclear extracts from GP220 cells were prepared as described by Van Seuningen et al. (37Van Seuningen I. Ostrowski J. Bustelo X.R. Sleath P. Bomsztyk K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26976-26985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) and kept at –80 °C until use. Protein content (2 μl of cell extracts) was measured using the bicinchoninic acid method (Pierce), as described in the manufacturer's instruction manual. The sequences of the oligonucleotides used for EMSAs are indicated in Table I. They were synthesized by MWG-Biotech (Germany). SIF1 (sucrase-isomaltase footprint 1) probe, corresponding to an evolutionarily conserved Cdx-2 cis-element of the sucrase isomaltase gene (26Suh E. Chen L. Taylor J. Traber P.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7340-7351Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar), was used as a positive control. Equimolar amounts of single-stranded oligonucleotides were annealed and radiolabeled using T4 polynucleotide kinase (Promega) and [γ-32P]dATP. Radiolabeled probes were purified by chromatography on a Bio-Gel P-6 column (Bio-Rad). Nuclear proteins (8 μg) were preincubated for 20 min on ice in 20 μl of binding buffer with 1 μg of poly(dI-dC) (Sigma) and 1 μg of sonicated salmon sperm DNA. Radiolabeled DNA probe was added (60,000 cpm), and the reaction was left for another 20 min on ice. For competition experiments 50× excess of the cold probe was added 20 min before adding the radiolabeled probe. For supershift analyses, 1 μl of the Cdx-2 antibody (Biogenex) was added to the proteins and left for 30 min at room temperature before adding the radiolabeled probe. Reactions were stopped by adding 2 μl of loading buffer. Samples were loaded onto a 4% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel, and electrophoresis conditions were as described in Van Seuningen et al. (34Van Seuningen I. Perrais M. Pigny P. Porchet N. Aubert J.P. Biochem. J. 2000; 348: 675-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Gels were vacuum-dried and autoradiographed for 48 h at –80 °C.Immunofluorescence—GP220 and GP202 cells, Cdx-2 transfected GP202 clones and GP202 mock cells were trypsinized, fixed in Preserv-Cyt solution (Cytyc) and layed on slides in a ThinPrep2000, according to the manufacturer. Cells were treated with neuraminidase, for 2 h at 37 °C, and blocked with non immune serum diluted at 1:5 in a 10% bovine serum albumin solution for 20 min. Excess normal serum was removed and replaced with anti-MUC2 PMH1 antibody (10Reis C.A. David L. Correa P. Carneiro F. de Bolós C. Garcia E. Mandel U. Clausen H. Sobrinho-Simões M. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 1003-1007PubMed Google Scholar). Slides were incubated overnight at 4 °C. After three washes with 1× phosphate-buffered saline, the slides were incubated at room temperature with fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled secondary antibody (DAKO) diluted at 1:200 with a 5% bovine serum albumin solution, for 30 min in the dark, mounted in vectashield with DAPI (Vector, Burlingame, CA), and analyzed with a Leica DMIRE2 fluorescent microscope.RESULTSExpression of MUC2, Cdx-1, and Cdx-2 in Human Gastric and Colon Carcinoma Cell Lines—Expression of MUC2, Cdx-1, and Cdx-2 was studied by RT-PCR. As shown in Fig. 1A, MUC2 mRNA is expressed in all gastric carcinoma cell lines, except for GP202. Cdx-1 is expressed in GP220 gastric carcinoma cell line. These cells also express low levels of Cdx-2 (Fig. 1A). In colon carcinoma cell lines, MUC2 is expressed in mucus-secreting LS174T cells and these cells also express Cdx-1 and Cdx-2. Caco-2 enterocytes and HT-29 STD undifferentiated cells do not express MUC2 or Cdx-1. Cdx-2 is expressed in Caco-2 cells and to a lower extent in HT-29 STD cells (Fig. 1B).Characterization of the Promoter Activity of MUC2 Gene in Gastric Cancer Cells—A panel of deletion mutants covering 2.6 kb of the promoter of MUC2 were constructed in promoterless pGL3 basic vector (Fig. 2A). They were used in transient transfection experiments in four gastric carcinoma cell lines (KATOIII, MKN45, GP220, and AGS) (Fig. 2B). Transient transfection of a pGL3 basic reporter construct containing nucleotides –371 to +27 of the MUC2 gene resulted in low levels of luciferase activity. Addition of the next 576 nucleotides up to nucleotide –947 (–947/+27) led to a significant increase in promoter activity in all cell lines (about 4-fold activation on average) (Fig. 2B). Addition of the distal region up to nucleotide –2096 (–2096/+27) increased normalized luciferase activity by 2-fold in AGS cells and in MKN45 cells to a lower extent (1.2-fold). No further increase in activity was observed when the –2627/–1 construct was used in either of the cell lines tested (Fig. 2B). The presence of the 5′-UTR in construct –947/+27 did not modify the activity of the corresponding construct devoid of the 5′-UTR (–947/–1). This suggests that the 5′-UTR does not play a major role in regulating MUC2 gene in gastric cancer cells.Fig. 2Analysis of the activity of the promoter of MUC2 gene by transient transfections.A, schematic representation and localization of the different constructs covering 2627 nucleotides of the MUC2 promoter. B, transcriptional activity in gastric carcinoma cell lines (KATOIII, MKN45, GP220, and AGS). The values obtained in cells transfected with the empty vector were referred as to 1. The results are means ± S.D. and represent two separate experiments in triplicate for each fragment.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)In conclusion, these results suggest that, in the four gastric cancer cell lines studied, essential positive regulatory elements for MUC2 promoter activity are present within the –947/–372 region. In AGS cells, a second distal active region, stretching over the –2096/–948 nucleotides, contains enhancer elements.Cdx-1 and Cdx-2 Transactivate the MUC2 Promoter in a Cell-specific Manner—The involvement of Cdx-1 and Cdx-2 in the intestinal development and differentiation and their role as transcription factors for several intestinal genes support the hypothesis that Cdx-1 and/or Cdx-2 could regulate MUC2 transcription. Adding to this, four putative binding sites for Cdx-1 and Cdx-2 were identified in MUC2 promoter at –177/–171, –191/–187, –1010/–1006, and –2614/–2610 that all contain Cdx consensus sequence TTTAT/C (Fig. 3A). Co-transfection experiments were performed to study the biological effect of these transcription factors on MUC2 transcriptional activity using pGL3-MUC2 deletion constructs in the presence of expression vectors encoding Cdx-1 or Cdx-2. The luciferase activity was compared with the one obtained in the co-transfection experiments carried out with the corresponding empty vector. Cdx-1 did not have any significant effect on MUC2 promoter activity in any of the gastric carcinoma cell lines, except for a 30% inhibition of the luciferase activity observed with the –371/+27 fragment in AGS cells (Fig. 3B, black bar). In MKN45 (gray bars), co-transfection with Cdx-2 induced luciferase activity of the four MUC2 promoter constructs (4–7 fold induction) (Fig. 3B). In KATOIII cells (hatched bars), Cdx-2 co-transfection resulted in a 2.5-fold transcriptional activation of the –947/+27 construct. Cdx-2 had no effect on the other two gastric carcinoma cell lines tested (GP220 and AGS), except for a 70% inhibitory effect with the –371/+27 fragment in the AGS cell line (black bars).Fig. 3Regulation of the MUC2 promoter activity by Cdx-1 and Cdx-2 transcription factors.A, schematic representation and localization of the different constructs used in co-transfection experiments with Cdx-1 and Cdx-2 expression vectors.

In HT-29 STD (23-fold), LS174T (55-fold), and Caco-2 (15-fold), Cdx-2 transactivation is much stronger with the smaller construct (–371/+27) when compared with the longer construct (–2627/–1) (Fig. 3C). One can note that the levels of activation vary greatly between the different cell lines indicating cell-specific activity of Cdx-2. Unlike gastric cells, we observed transactivation of MUC2 promoter by Cdx-1 in colon cancer cells. Transactivation was more efficient on the short construct –371/+27 in HT-29 STD (4.5-fold) and LS174T (10-fold) cells whereas it was more active on the long construct –2627/–1 in Caco-2 cells (10-fold). The transactivation is however much less important than with Cdx-2. From these studies it can be concluded that the MUC2 promoter is strongly transactivated by Cdx-2 in KATO-III and MKN45 gastric carcinoma cell lines as well as in all colon carcinoma cell lines. Cdx-1 appears more specific as it only transactivates MUC2 promoter in colon cancer cells.Identification of Two Cdx-2 cis-Elements within the MUC2 Promoter—In order to demonstrate that the Cdx-2 transcription factor binds to the MUC2 promoter, EMSAs were performed in the presence of GP220 nuclear extracts and probe wild type –201/–161, that contains the two putative Cdx-2 binding sites at –177/–171"
https://openalex.org/W2039439643,"Retinal rods and cones share a phototransduction pathway involving cyclic GMP. Cones are typically 100 times less photosensitive than rods and their response kinetics are several times faster, but the underlying mechanisms remain largely unknown. Almost all proteins involved in phototransduction have distinct rod and cone variants. Differences in properties between rod and cone pigments have been described, such as a 10-fold shorter lifetime of the meta-II state (active conformation) of cone pigment and its higher rate of spontaneous isomerization, but their contributions to the functional differences between rods and cones remain speculative. We have addressed this question by expressing human or salamander red cone pigment in Xenopus rods, and human rod pigment in Xenopus cones. Here we show that rod and cone pigments when present in the same cell produce light responses with identical amplification and kinetics, thereby ruling out any difference in their signalling properties. However, red cone pigment isomerizes spontaneously 10,000 times more frequently than rod pigment. This high spontaneous activity adapts the native cones even in darkness, making them less sensitive and kinetically faster than rods. Nevertheless, additional factors are probably involved in these differences."
https://openalex.org/W2051386839,"EGb 761, a standardized extract of Ginkgo biloba leaves, has been shown to have antioxidative properties. We have previously demonstrated that EGb 761 increases stress resistance and mean life span in the model organism Caenorhabditis elegans. In this study, the molecular mechanism of EGb 761 on alleviating effects of oxidative stress is further investigated using transgenic C. elegans expressing a jellyfish green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged inducible small heat-shock protein gene (hsp-16-2). The expression of hsp-16-2 induced by the pro-oxidant juglone and by heat shock was significantly suppressed by 86% and 33%, respectively, in the transgenic nematode fed with EGb 761. These effects of EGb 761 correlate with its ability to increase mean survival rate of the nematode in response to acute oxidative and thermal stresses, as well as to attenuate the basal levels of hydrogen peroxide in the organism. Thus, we interpret the suppression of hsp-16-2/GFP expression as an indication that EGb 761 decreases cellular stress resulting from exogenous treatments, therefore leading to a decreased transcriptional induction of the reporter transgene. These results support the hypothesis that EGb 761 augments the natural antistress system of C. elegans, thus increasing stress resistance and life span."
https://openalex.org/W2011929115,"Although a number of secreted factors have been demonstrated to be bone regulators, none of these are unique to bone. Using a viral-based signal-trap strategy we have identified a novel gene we have termed “osteocrin.” A 1280-bp mRNA encodes osteocrin producing a mature protein of 103 amino acids with a molecular mass of 11.4 kDa. Osteocrin shows no homology with any known gene except for two conserved sequence motifs reminiscent of dibasic cleavage sites found in peptide hormone precursors. Immunofluorescence and Western blot analysis confirmed the secretory nature of osteocrin. Two protein species were identified in the medium of cells overexpressing osteocrin, a full-length 11.4 kDa species and a processed ∼5 kDa species. Mutation of the 76KKKR79 dibasic cleavage site abolished the appearance of this smaller osteocrin fragment. By in situ hybridization in mouse embryos, osteocrin was expressed specifically in Cbfa-1-positive, osteocalcin-negative osteoblasts. Immunohistochemistry on adult mouse bone showed osteocrin localization in osteoblasts and young osteocytes. By Northern blot analysis, osteocrin expression was only detected in bone, expression peaking just after birth and decreasing markedly with age. In primary osteoblastic cell cultures osteocrin expression coincided with matrix formation then decreased in very mature cultures. Treatment of cultures with 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 resulted in a rapid dose-dependent down-regulation of osteocrin expression, suggesting direct regulation. Chronic treatment of primary cultures with osteocrin-conditioned media inhibited mineralization and reduced osteocalcin and alkaline phosphatase expression. These results suggest that osteocrin represents a novel, unique vitamin D-regulated bone-specific protein that appears to act as a soluble osteoblast regulator.

Bone is a dynamic tissue that is continually being modeled and remodeled through the coordinated actions of the bone forming osteoblasts and bone resorbing osteoclasts. Such remodeling is necessary to respond to the continually changing mechanical and regulatory demands placed upon the skeleton (1.Vaananen H.K. Ann.

The balance of the activity of the osteoblasts and osteoclasts is tightly regulated at both the systemic and local levels through the actions of a number of secreted molecules.

More recently, it has been reported that the peptide hormone leptin exerts a strong systemic anti-osteogenic effect when activating the sympathetic nervous system through a hypothalamic relay (14.Amling M.

Res. 2001; 16: 1583-1585Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Osteoblasts also secrete abundant amounts of non-collagenous proteins, which play key roles in the maturation and mineralization of the bone matrix (18.Robey P.G.

In addition to building bone, the osteoblasts are directly and indirectly involved in regulating bone metabolism. Osteoblasts secrete molecules that regulate osteoclastogenesis and/or osteoclast activity, such as receptor activator of NFκB ligand and osteoprotegerin (20.Suda T. Takahashi N. Udagawa N. Jimi E. Gillespie M.T. Martin T.J. Endocr.

Mohan S. Baylink D.J. Bone. 1996; 19: 1S-12SCrossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). These factors are thought to be stored and released during successive remodeling cycles to control local bone formation and resorption (21.Linkhart T.A. Mohan S. Baylink D.J.

In fact, currently, only four highly bone-specific genes have been identified, two key transcription factors (Cbfa-1 (28.Ducy P. Zhang R. Geoffroy V. Ridall A.L. Karsenty G.

To identify novel potential bone-specific regulatory molecules, we undertook to screen cDNA libraries from bone using a viral-based signal trap technology (33.Moffatt P. Salois P. Gaumond M.H. St-Amant N. Godin E. Lanctot C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 4285-4294Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). We report here the identification of a novel gene specifically expressed in osteoblasts. The protein contains dibasic cleavage sites conserved in vertebrate homologues and reminiscent of those found in hormonal precursors. Functionally, this novel protein appears able to modulate osteoblastic differentiation.MATERIALS AND METHODSCloning of Full-length Mouse Osteocrin cDNA—We have previously developed a screening system that allows the rapid identification of nucleic acids encoding signal peptides from complex libraries of cDNA fragments (33.Moffatt P. Salois P. Gaumond M.H. St-Amant N. Godin E. Lanctot C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 4285-4294Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). A library enriched in 5′ fragments of cDNAs derived from developing calvaria (33.Moffatt P. Salois P. Gaumond M.H. St-Amant N. Godin E. Lanctot C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 4285-4294Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) was obtained using a protocol adapted from the “oligo-capping” method (34.Maruyama K. Sugano S. Gene. 1994; 138: 171-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar).The original osteocrin fragment retrieved from this screening protocol comprised nt 1-430 of the corresponding full-length clone (Fig. 1), which was subsequently obtained using a modified 3′-RACE strategy as follows. Five μg of e15.5 mouse calvaria total RNA was reverse-transcribed with Superscript II™ (Invitrogen) using a dT15 primer-linker. cDNA was subjected to 25 cycles of PCR with the Titan™ RT-PCR kit (Roche) using forward primer 25-10G (see Table I for primer sequences) and reverse primer 18-30V, complementary to the 5′ portion of the dT15 primer-linker (underlined). The PCR products were cloned in place of green fluorescent protein into the pQBI25fc3 cytomegalovirus-based expression vector (qBiogene, Montreal, Canada) and the coding sequence of osteocrin amplified by RT-PCR using Titan™ and primers 25-10G and 24-10G. The cDNA encoding the mutant osteocrin protein (mut-osteocrin, 128 aa), in which the 76KKKR79 was changed into 76AS77, was constructed by mismatch PCR. Briefly, the wild-type mouse osteocrin expression vector was used as a template for two separate amplifications with Vent DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada) and the following primer pairs 25-10G (forward) and 24-10Gmut (reverse), and 25-10Gmut (forward) and 24-10G (reverse). Each PCR product generated was digested with NheI, purified, and rejoined with T4 DNA ligase. All PCR products were cloned into the pQBI25fc3 vector and verified by dye terminator cycle sequencing (DTCS™ sequencing kit, Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA) on a Beckman CEQ 2000 automated sequencer.Table ISummary of primers used in PCR amplification under “Materials and Methods”Primer identifierPrimer sequence 5′—3′dT15 primer-linkerGAGATGAATTCCTCGAGCTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT25—10GAAACGCTCTGACTTCTCACAAGATG18—30VGAGATGAATTCCTCGAGC24—10GCCATCAGCCTCTGGAACTGGAGAG24—10GmutCTTGCTAGCGGTCTCAAATACGTCATTC25—10GmutTTCGCTAGCAGCTTCTCTGGCTTTGGG18—131GAGATGCTCGACTGGAGAT19—9GGAATCAATTAGCCTCTGGA21—9GGGAAAGAACTTCACTGAAGTG19—14GGCTCCTCAACGAATTGGTG23—4V (degenerate)ACI (GA) (TC) I (CAT) (GC) IGA (AG) G (CA) GAA (GA) TC (AG) GC23—6V (degenerate)CT (AG) TCIA (TAG) (GC) GG (AG) (GC) (AT) ICC (AG) AAICC21—14GAGATGCTGGACTGGAGATTGG21—15GTTCTACCAATCCGATCCATGG18—9GGTCATTGAGAGCAATGCC19—12GCAAGGTCATCCATGACAAC Open table in a new tab Cloning of Vertebrate Homologues of Osteocrin—Human and rat osteocrin were cloned by standard RT-PCR starting from 50 ng of bone marrow poly(A) RNA (Clontech Inc, Palo Alto, CA) or 5 μg UMR106 osteosarcoma cell total RNA (ATCC, Manassas, VA), respectively. RTPCR was performed with Titan™ with a common forward primer (18-131G) and specific reverse primers (human, 19-9G; rat, 21-9G). For snake osteocrin, total RNA was extracted from the vertebrae and surrounding muscles of a 2-month-old (∼130 g) Burmese python using Trizol™ (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. First-strand cDNA was synthesized using dT15 primer-linker and Superscript II™. cDNA was then subjected to 33 cycles of PCR using rTaq DNA polymerase (NEB) with forward primer 23-4V and reverse primer 23-6V. 3′-RACE was then performed as described above with forward primer 19-14G and reverse primer 18-30G.Production of Antibodies—A synthetic peptide (120CMDRIGRNRL SNSRG133) corresponding to the last 14 residues of human osteocrin preceded by an extra cysteine, was conjugated to activated keyhole limpet hemocyanin via sulfhydryl groups. The peptide/carrier complex was mixed with complete Freund's adjuvant and injected into rabbits according to standard protocols (Affinity Bioreagents, Golden, CO).Cell Culture and Transfections—Primary calvarial osteoblasts were cultured from 19-20-day-old embryonic rats based on a previously described protocol (35.Aronow M.A. Gerstenfeld L.C. Owen T.A. Tassinari M.S. Stein G.S. Lian J.B. J. Cell. Physiol. 1990; 143: 213-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). Briefly, calvaria were subjected to 5 sequential 20 min digests in 1 mg/ml collagenase (Worthington, Lakewood, NJ)/0.25% trypsin (Roche)/0.05% EDTA). Cells from digests 2-5 were pooled and seeded at 10000 cells/cm2 in α-minimal essential medium containing 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 40 mg/ml gentomycin, 20 mm HEPES, 2 mm glutamine, 50 μg/ml ascorbic acid (all Invitrogen) with or without 10 mm β-glycerophosphate (βGP) (Sigma) depending on experimental conditions. Media was changed after 2 days and every 2-3 days thereafter. Cultures were treated with 1,25(OH)2D3 (Sigma) or ethanol vehicle at various concentrations and for differing time periods as noted for each experiment. For transfections experiments, HEK293 (qBiogen) and UMR106 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. Cells were transiently transfected with 500 ng of plasmid DNA/106 cells using Effectene™ (Qiagen, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Media was changed after 6 h, and cells were left for an additional 16 h before washing with phosphate-buffered saline and accumulation in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 48 h for analysis of secreted products. For conditioned media treatment of primary osteoblast cultures, media from osteocrin or mock-transfected HEK293 cells were diluted 1:6 in normal culture media and replenished every 2-3 days from day 2 until the termination of the experiment at day 18. To measure 45Ca uptake, 45CaCl2 (1μCi/ml)(Amersham Biosciences) was added to the medium for the last 48 h of the experiment. Medium was collected and the cells scraped into 5% (v/v) trichloroacetic acid. Cell/matrix-associated 45Ca incorporation was calculated as a percentage of the total input in the cellular and medium fractions.Immunofluorescence and Western Analysis—For immunofluorescence detection, cells grown on coverslips were fixed with 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m phosphate buffer (PB), pH 7.2, and permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100™ in PB for 4 min. Cells were then blocked with PB supplemented with 5% (w/v) dried milk for 30 min. Cells were then incubated for 1 h with a mix of 1/100 dilution (v/v) of goat anti-human osteocrin antisera and a 1/50 dilution (v/v) of mouse anti-rat Golgi 58K protein antibody (Sigma) in PB. Cells were then incubated in a mix of goat anti-rabbit coupled to AlexaFluor 594 and goat anti-mouse AlexaFluor 488 (both Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) in PB for 1 h. Cells were washed twice and observed by fluorescence microscopy. All steps were performed at room temperature.For Western blotting, protein in the conditioned medium was precipitated by adding trichloroacetic acid to a final concentration of 10% (w/v) and incubated on ice for 1 h. After centrifugation at 12000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C, the pellet was washed once with chilled acetone, dried briefly, and resuspended directly in 2× Laemli loading buffer (Bio-Rad, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada) and boiled. For cell extracts, cells were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline and solubilized in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCL, pH8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1% IGEPAL-630™, and 1% (v/v) protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma)). Cell debris and insoluble material were pelleted by centrifugation at 12000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. The soluble proteins were mixed with 1 volume of 2× Laemli loading buffer and boiled. Proteins were electrophoresed on a 16.5% denaturing Tris-Tricine polyacrylamide gel (Bio-Rad) and transferred onto 0.2 μm nitrocellulose (Protran, Schleicher, and Schuell, Keene, NH) according to standard Western blot protocols. All subsequent incubations were performed at room temperature. The membrane was incubated in a 1/800 dilution (v/v) of osteocrin-antiserum in Tris-buffered saline, 0.1% Tween 20 with 2.5% (w/v) dried milk followed by goat anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase (Sigma) diluted 1/30000 in TBST with 2.5% (w/v) dried milk and the signal visualized with ECL™ reagent (Amersham Biosciences).In Situ Hybridization—In situ hybridization was performed on mouse embryonic tissue sections from e16.5 to e17.5 as described previously (36.Lanctot C. Lamolet B. Drouin J. Development. 1997; 124: 2807-2817PubMed Google Scholar). The mouse cRNA antisense probes used were as follows: an 815-bp cbfa-1 fragment (nt 931-1746 of GenBank™ accession number AF10284), an 187-bp osteocalcin fragment (nt 1-187 of GenBank™ accession number U11542), and a 431-bp osteocrin fragment (nt 1-431 of sequence shown in Fig. 1A). Cbfa-1 and osteocalcin were exposed for 21 days and osteocrin for 30 days.Northern and RT-PCR Analysis—RNA was isolated from whole bones or osteoblastic cell cultures using Trizol™ with glycogen (5 μg/ml) as carrier according to the manufacturer's instructions. For RT-PCR, cDNAs were generated with Superscript II™ reverse transcriptase and oligo-dT18 priming, and PCR amplification carried out with gene-specific primers using rTaq DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs). Gene-specific primers and conditions were as follows: osteocrin, forward 21-14G and reverse 21-15G (annealing temp = 52 °C, 28 cycles, product 378-bp); GAPDH, forward 18-9G and reverse 19-12G (annealing temp = 56 °C, 33 cycles, product 398-bp).Northern blots were generated on nylon membranes (Osmonics, Westborough, MA) by standard methods (37.Sambrook J. Fritsch E. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 7.45-7.52Google Scholar). Filters were prehybridized for 4 h and hybridized overnight in Church buffer (38.Church G.M. Gilbert W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 1991-1995Crossref PubMed Scopus (7258) Google Scholar) at 65 °C. The rat osteocrin cDNA probe corresponded to the full coding sequence (Fig. 1A). For rat osteocalcin, a cDNA corresponding to the full coding sequence (GenBank™ accession number M25490) was generated by PCR. A 681-bp mouse fragment corresponding to GenBank™ accession number J04806 was cloned for the osteopontin cDNA probe. For alkaline phosphatase, a 341-bp fragment corresponding to GenBank™ accession number NM013059 was generated. A mouse GAPDH cDNA probe corresponding to -21 to 956 bp of GenBank™ accession number M32599 was generated by PCR. Probes were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using a standard random priming protocol (37.Sambrook J. Fritsch E. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 7.45-7.52Google Scholar).Immunohistochemistry—Immunohistochemistry was as described previously (39.Miao D. Bai X. Panda D. McKee M. Karaplis A. Goltzman D. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 926-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Briefly, decalcified tibial sections were stained with primary osteocrin antibody or preimmune rabbit serum overnight at room temperature followed by biotinylated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Sigma) and stained using the avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex technique.RESULTSIdentification and Cloning of Osteocrin—We previously reported the application of a novel technology, based on a signal-trap, to identify cDNAs encoding secreted and membrane-bound proteins (33.Moffatt P. Salois P. Gaumond M.H. St-Amant N. Godin E. Lanctot C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 4285-4294Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Screening of a mouse e15.5 calvarial bone library identified a 433-bp fragment encoding a putative translation product containing a signal peptide deriving from a novel unannotated gene. A modified 3′-RACE strategy was used to obtain the full-length cDNA. Sequences from at least five different clones were aligned to reconstitute the full-length cDNA sequence shown in Fig. 1A. This mouse cDNA is 1280-bp containing an open reading frame of 393 bp flanked by 61 bp and 826 bp of untranslated sequences at the 5′ and 3′ ends, respectively. A polyadenylation signal is found 14 bp upstream of a poly(A) stretch. The putative initiator ATG codon is found in an adequate Kozak context (AAGATGC). Delineation of the corresponding genomic locus was enabled by BLAST searches of the mouse genome sequence (www.ensembl.org). The gene is located at chromosome 16B2 (syntenic to human chromosome region 3q28). Covering ∼44 kb, the mouse gene locus is unusually large for a 1280 mRNA derived from only 5 exons (Fig. 1B).Protein Structure and Secretion of Osteocrin—The novel mouse cDNA encoded a protein of 130 residues containing a signal peptide (Fig. 1A, underlined). The SignalP v2.0 server (40.Nielsen H. Engelbrecht J. Brunak S. von Heijne G. Protein Eng. 1997; 10: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (4920) Google Scholar) predicted two possible signal peptidase cleavage sites, at Ala-25 and Ser-27 (Fig. 1A, arrowheads). Initial mass spectrometric analyses on a semi-purified preparation gave a size of 11371 Daltons favoring Ser-27 as the predominant cleavage site. Such a size also matched exactly the predicted molecular weight from the sequence suggesting no post-translational modifications. The mature 11.4-kDa protein has an isoelectric point of 10.02. Extensive in silico analysis suggested that the protein presented no strong homology with any known protein or protein domains. However, two sequence motifs reminiscent of dibasic cleavage sites found in peptide hormone precursors were evident: KKKR at position 76-79 and KKR at position 110-112 (Fig. 1A, boxed). Such putative cleavage sites could create peptides of 48, 30, and 18 aa, respectively. Because of these features and its bone-specific expression (see “Restricted Expression of Osteocrin”), we tentatively named this novel gene osteocrin.To further investigate the significance of the putative processing sites in mouse osteocrin, we determined whether the dibasic sites were conserved in other species. Rat and human full-length cDNAs and a partial cDNA from snake were cloned using RT-PCR. In addition, in silico searches (GenBank™) identified a single bovine EST (accession number BF045261) and two chicken ESTs (accession numbers ChEST861c21 and ChEST83i24) (41.Boardman P.E. Sanz-Ezquerro J. Overton I.M. Burt D.W. Bosch E. Fong W.T. Tickle C. Brown W.R. Wilson S.A. Hubbard S.J. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 1965-1969Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). Overall amino acid homology between different species is high (Fig. 2A), for example human and mouse sequences are 74% identical (84% similar) and human and chicken sequences are 59% identical (71% similar). Further, the dibasic cleavage sites are conserved across species (Fig. 2A) with the C-terminal half of the protein from the KKKR dibasic site being the most conserved. For instance, the C-terminal portion of the human protein (residues 116-133) differs by only 3 amino acids from that of the snake protein (C-terminal 90% similarity, full-length similarity of 79%).Fig. 2Predicted osteocrin protein structure and secretion.A, predicted amino acid sequences from human, bovine, mouse, rat, chicken, and snake (partial) cDNAs (see “Materials and Methods”). The two dibasic cleavage sites, 76KKKR79 and 110KKR112, are well conserved (boxed). Shaded residues represent non-conserved residues from the human sequence. Note that the C-terminal half of the protein is highly conserved. B, immunofluorescent localization with a human osteocrin-specific antibody demonstrates overexpressed osteocrin is clearly visible in the secretory apparatus of HEK293A fibroblasts and UMR106 osteosarcoma cells (×400) colocalizing with the 58K Golgi protein-specific antibody. C, the majority of osteocrin is detected in the medium of HEK293 cells by Western blot when transiently transfected (lanes 1 and 2). Residual protein in the secretory apparatus is detected in the cell lysate (lanes 4 and 5). Two exposures of the Western blot are shown to illustrate the underrepresented smaller processed fragments, with the lower panel representing a longer exposure. A doublet can be seen at the expected full-length size of 11.4 kDa and smaller processed fragments at ∼5 kDa (lane 1). Mutation of the KKKR site to AS abolishes processing of the protein leaving only full-length 11.4 kDa bands (lane 2). Equal proportions of media or cell lysate from cultured cells were loaded.

Rather, several lines of evidence suggest that UCP3 is related to cellular long-chain fatty acid homeostasis. If long-chain fatty acids enter the mitochondrial matrix in their non-esterified form, they cannot be metabolized and may exert deleterious effects. To test the feasibility that UCP3 exports fatty acid anions, we systematically interfered at distinct steps in the fatty acid metabolism pathway, thereby creating conditions in which the entry of (non-esterified) fatty acids into the mitochondrial matrix is enhanced. First, reducing the cellular fatty acid binding capacity, known to increase cytosolic concentrations of non-esterified fatty acids, up-regulated UCP3 5.3-fold. Second, inhibition of mitochondrial entry of esterified long-chain fatty acids up-regulated UCP3 by 1.9-fold. Third, high-fat diets, to increase mitochondrial supply of non-esterified long-chain fatty acids exceeding oxidative capacity, up-regulated UCP3 twofold. However, feeding a similar amount of medium-chain fatty acids, which can be oxidized inside the mitochondrial matrix and therefore do not need to be exported from the matrix, did not affect UCP3 protein levels. These data are compatible with a physiological function of UCP3 in facilitating outward transport of long-chain fatty acid anions, which cannot be oxidized, from the mitochondrial matrix."

We previously identified Bro1 as a protein essential to this down-regulation. In this study, we show that Bro1 is essential neither to ubiquitination nor to the early steps of Gap1 endocytosis. Bro1 rather intervenes at a late step of the multivesicular body (MVB) pathway, after the core components of the endosome-associated ESCRT-III protein complex and before or in conjunction with Doa4, the ubiquitin hydrolase mediating protein deubiquitination prior to their incorporation into MVB vesicles. Bro1 markedly differs from other class E vacuolar protein sorting factors involved in MVB sorting as lack of Bro1 leads to recycling of the internalized permease back to the plasma membrane by passing through the Golgi. This recycling seems to be accompanied by deubiquitination of the permease and unexpectedly requires a normal endosome-to-vacuole transport function.

This recycling seems to be accompanied by deubiquitination of the permease and unexpectedly requires a normal endosome-to-vacuole transport function. The machineries responsible for endocytosis and degradation of plasma membrane proteins are crucial to normal regulation of cell surface-associated functions such as transport, signaling, and adhesion (1.D'Hondt K. Heese-Peck A. Riezman H. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2000; 34: 255-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 2.Rotin D. Staub O. Haguenauer-Tsapis R. J. Membr. Biol. 2000; 176: 1-17Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The proteins are first internalized from the cell surface into small endocytic vesicles, a step that generally requires prior ubiquitination of cargo proteins at the plasma membrane. The endocytosed proteins then move through early and late endosomes to finally reach the lysosomal/vacuolar lumen where they are degraded. The last steps of this endocytic pathway, from endosome to vacuolar lumen, are shared with a subset of biosynthetic membrane proteins derived from the late secretory pathway (3.Bryant N.J. Stevens T.H. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 230-247Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Namely, the delivery of both endocytic and biosynthetic membrane proteins to the lysosomal/vacuolar lumen requires their prior sorting into the multivesicular body (MVB) 1The abbreviations used are: MVBmultivesicular bodyVpsvacuolar protein sortingESCRTendosomal sorting complex required for transportt-SNAREtarget-soluble N-ethylmaleimide attachment protein receptorTGNtrans-Golgi networkCPScarboxypeptidase SGFPgreen fluorescent protein.1The abbreviations used are: MVBmultivesicular bodyVpsvacuolar protein sortingESCRTendosomal sorting complex required for transportt-SNAREtarget-soluble N-ethylmaleimide attachment protein receptorTGNtrans-Golgi networkCPScarboxypeptidase SGFPgreen fluorescent protein. pathway (4.Futter C.E.

Cell. 1998; 95: 847-858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar). MVBs arise from endosomes, as the protein-carrying endosomal membrane invaginates and buds into the endosome, forming internal vesicles. The proteins sorted to these MVB vesicles are ultimately delivered to the lumen of the lysosome/vacuole when the MVB fuses with this organelle. Besides its role in the early steps of endocytosis, ubiquitin is also important for MVB sorting, as entry of several proteins into MVB vesicles depends on their prior ubiquitination (6.Katzmann D.J. Babst M. Emr S.D. Cell. 2001; 106: 145-155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1110) Google Scholar, 7.Reggiori F. Pelham H.R.

In yeast mutants defective in the class E Vps factors, proteins normally targeted to the vacuolar lumen accumulate in an aberrant late endosome, referred to as the class E compartment, as well as at the limiting membrane of the vacuole (5.Odorizzi G. Babst M. Emr S.D. Cell. 1998; 95: 847-858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar, 9.Raymond C.K. Howald-Stevenson I. Vater C.A. Stevens T.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 1389-1402Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar). Several of these Vps factors are organized in three distinct endosome-associated protein complexes. The ESCRT-I complex participates in recognition of ubiquitinated proteins that are targeted into the MVB pathway (6.Katzmann D.J. Babst M. Emr S.D. Cell. 2001; 106: 145-155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1110) Google Scholar).

Cell. 2002; 3: 271-282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar). The MVB pathway involves several other factors as follows: the Vps27-Hse1 complex to recruit the ESCRT-I complex and to recognize ubiquitinated MVB cargo proteins (12.Bilodeau P.S. Urbanowski J.L. Winistorfer S.C. Piper R.C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 534-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar, 13.Shih S.C. Katzmann D.J. Schnell J.D. Sutanto M. Emr S.D. Hicke L. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 389-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar); the AAA-type ATPase Vps4 to dissociate the ESCRT complexes from the endosomal membrane; and the ubiquitin hydrolase Doa4, recruited by ESCRTIII, to deubiquitinate proteins prior to their sorting into MVB vesicles (6.Katzmann D.J. Babst M. Emr S.D. Cell. 2001; 106: 145-155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1110) Google Scholar, 14.Babst M. Wendland B. Estepa E.J. Emr S.D.

Cell. 2000; 11: 3365-3380Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). The MVB sorting machinery appears well conserved, because most of the yeast class E Vps proteins have mammalian homologues whose functions are probably similar to those of their yeast counterparts (16.Pornillos O. Garrus J.E. Sundquist W.I. Trends Cell Biol. 2002; 12: 569-579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar).We use the yeast general amino acid permease Gap1 as a model to gain further insight into the process of regulated trafficking of membrane proteins. Gap1 is suitable for this purpose, as its membrane trafficking is tightly controlled by the nature of the nitrogen source. Under conditions of poor nitrogen supply (proline or urea), Gap1 is abundantly synthesized and accumulates in a highly active and stable form at the plasma membrane. Upon addition of a preferential nitrogen source like ammonium (NH4+), the GAP1 gene is repressed, and the permease present at the cell surface is rapidly poly-ubiquitinated on two lysine residues in the N-terminal tail (Lys-9 and Lys-16). This ubiquitination triggers Gap1 endocytosis followed by sorting to the vacuole/lysosome lumen for degradation (17.Grenson M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 133: 135-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 18.Jauniaux J.C. Grenson M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 190: 39-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 19.Hein C.

Ubiquitination of Gap1 at the cell surface is dependent on the ubiquitin ligase Rsp5/Npi1, the Bul proteins, and the Doa4/Npi2 ubiquitin hydrolase, the latter being required to maintain a normal level of free ubiquitin (19.Hein C. Springael J.Y. Volland C. Haguenauer-Tsapis R. André B. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 18: 77-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 20.Springael J.Y. André B. Mol. Biol.

Cell. 1999; 10: 2583-2594Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). The nitrogen source controls Gap1 trafficking also in the late secretory pathway (24.Roberg K.J. Rowley N. Kaiser C.A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1469-1482Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Although newly synthesized Gap1 is sorted from the Golgi to the plasma membrane in proline- or urea-grown cells, it is directed to the vacuole, bypassing the cell surface, when glutamate (24.Roberg K.J. Rowley N. Kaiser C.A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1469-1482Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), ammonium (22.Soetens O. De Craene J.O. André B. J. Biol.

A. 2002; 99: 14837-14842Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) are present. The same direct sorting of Gap1 to the vacuole occurs on proline or urea medium in cells lacking a functional Npr1 (26.De Craene J.O. Soetens O. André B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43939-43948Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), a protein kinase inhibited under favored nitrogen supply (17.Grenson M. Eur. J.

Like endocytosis, this direct vacuolar sorting of Gap1 requires ubiquitination (22.Soetens O. De Craene J.O. André B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43949-43957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar) or even polyubiquitination (29.Helliwell S.B. Losko S. Kaiser C.A. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 649-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar) of the permease.Down-regulation of Gap1 also requires the NPI3 gene: in npi3 mutant cells, the permease stays mainly at the plasma membrane after ammonium addition. The cells also show an apparent defect in Gap1 ubiquitination (30.Springael J.Y. Nikko E. André B. Marini A.M. FEBS Lett. 2002; 517: 103-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The npi3 mutant was initially isolated together with npi1 and npi2 strains in a screen for mutations restoring high Gap1 activity in the npr1 mutant (17.Grenson M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 133: 135-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Accordingly, Npi3 is also required for direct sorting of Gap1 to the vacuole that occurs in the absence of Npr1, indicating that the Npi3 function is not limited to Gap1 endocytosis (30.Springael J.Y. Nikko E. André B. Marini A.M. FEBS Lett. 2002; 517: 103-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Cloning of NPI3 revealed that it is identical to BRO1, a gene originally described to interact genetically with components of the Pkc1-mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway (31.Nickas M.E. Yaffe M.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2585-2593Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). BRO1/NPI3 has also been identified as ASI6; the asi6 mutation restores amino acid uptake in cells defective in a signaling pathway that induces transcription of several amino acid permease genes (32.Forsberg H. Hammar M. Andreasson C. Moliner A. Ljungdahl P.O. Genetics. 2001; 158: 973-988PubMed Google Scholar). Bro1/Npi3/Asi6 has also been isolated in two separate screens for factors required for vacuolar protein sorting (5.Odorizzi G. Babst M. Emr S.D. Cell. 1998; 95: 847-858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar, 33.Robinson J.S. Klionsky D.J. Banta L.M. Emr S.D. Mol. Cell.

Cell. 2002; 13: 2486-2501Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar) and was named Vps31. For simplicity, the protein will hereafter be referred to as Bro1. In a recent study, Bro1 was shown to be a soluble class E Vps factor associating with endosomes and required for the MVB sorting of the vacuolar hydrolase carboxypeptidase S (CPS) (35.Odorizzi G. Katzmann D.J. Babst M. Audhya A. Emr S.D. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 1893-1903Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Bro1 is conserved throughout the eukaryotic kingdom, and its homologues include mouse AIP1/Alix, a cytosolic protein involved in apoptosis but whose function has remained unclear (36.Missotten M. Nichols A. Rieger K. Sadoul R. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 124-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 37.Vito P. Pellegrini L. Guiet C. D'Adamio L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1533-1540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar).Here we report that Bro1 is not essential for ubiquitination or for endocytosis of Gap1. Instead, the protein intervenes at a late step of MVB sorting, likely after the ESCRT-III core components and before or in conjunction with the Doa4-deubiquitinating enzyme. In contrast to other class E Vps factors of the ESCRT-I, -II, and -III complexes, a deficiency in Bro1 leads to recycling of the permease back to the cell surface via the trans-Golgi. Interestingly, this recycling requires normal endosometo-vacuole transport. Furthermore, we provide evidence that recycling of Gap1 is accompanied by deubiquitination of the permease.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESStrains, Plasmids, and Media—The Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains used in this study (Table I) are isogenic with Σ1278b (38.Béchet J.

Andre, unpublished data Open table in a new tab Permease Assays—Cells carrying the gap1Δ mutation were transformed with the YCpGap1 or YCpGap1K9K16 plasmid. Gap1 permease activity was determined by measuring the initial rate of incorporation of 14C-labeled citrulline (20 μm), a specific substrate of the permease (40.Grenson M. Mousset M. Wiame J.M. Bechet J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1966; 127: 325-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Gap1 was inactivated by adding (NH4)2SO4 (10 mm) to the culture. The permease activity was determined in each strain at least three times.Yeast Cell Extracts and Immunoblotting—Cells bearing the gap1Δ mutation were transformed with plasmid YCpGap1 or YCpGap1K9K16. Crude extracts (19.Hein C. Springael J.Y. Volland C. Haguenauer-Tsapis R. André B. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 18: 77-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar) and membrane-enriched preparations (20.Springael J.Y. André B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 1253-1263Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) were obtained as described previously. Gap1 immunoblotting was performed as described (22.Soetens O. De Craene J.O. André B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43949-43957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Extract preparation and Gap1 immunoblotting were performed a minimum of three times for each strain.Fluorescence Microscopy—Cells transformed with the pJOD10 plasmid were grown in minimal buffered medium (pH 6.1) with 3% galactose and 0.3% glucose as carbon sources and 0.1% proline as the nitrogen source. Glucose was added to the final concentration of 3% 2.5 h before starting the experiment in order to stop Gap1-GFP synthesis. Gap1-GFP internalization was induced by adding (NH4)2SO4 (10 mm)to the culture. To visualize vacuoles, cells were incubated in medium containing 40 μm FM4-64 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR), shaken for 15 min at 30 °C, transferred to fresh medium, and chased for ∼1 h. Cells were viewed with a Nikon Eclipse E600 microscope equipped with appropriate fluorescence light filter sets. Images were captured with a Nikon DXM1200 digital camera and processed using Adobe Photoshop 5.0 (Adobe Systems, Mountain View, CA). All the Gap1 location experiments were performed at least three times.RESULTSGap1 Is Sorted into the MVB Pathway—To date, a number of yeast proteins have been shown to reach the vacuolar lumen via the MVB pathway (e.g. CPS, Ste2, and Fur4) (5.Odorizzi G. Babst M. Emr S.D. Cell. 1998; 95: 847-858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar, 41.Marchal C. Dupré S. Urban-Grimal D. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 217-226PubMed Google Scholar). The sorting of these proteins into intra-endosomal vesicles necessitates the interplay of several class E Vps factors, many of which are organized in complexes (6.Katzmann D.J. Babst M. Emr S.D. Cell. 2001; 106: 145-155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1110) Google Scholar, 10.Babst M. Katzmann D.J. Snyder W.B. Wendland B. Emr S.D. Dev.

Cell. 2002; 3: 271-282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar). In class E vps mutants, membrane proteins normally transiting through the MVB pathway mainly accumulate in an aberrant late endosome referred to as the class E compartment and/or are missorted to the vacuole limiting membrane. We thus sought to determine the fate of Gap1 after ammonium addition to various mutants lacking one of the following class E Vps factors: Vps23, Vps36, Snf7/Vps32 (components of the ESCRT-I, -II, and -III complexes, respectively), or Vps4 (the AAA-type ATPase required for ESCRT complex dissociation from the endosomal membrane) (6.Katzmann D.J.

Cell. 2002; 3: 271-282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar).The presence of Gap1 at the cell surface is reflected by permease activity that is easily monitored by 14C-labeled citrulline uptake assay. In accordance with previous studies (19.Hein C. Springael J.Y. Volland C. Haguenauer-Tsapis R. André B. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 18: 77-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 20.Springael J.Y. André B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 1253-1263Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), we observed high Gap1 activity in proline-grown wild type cells; this activity decreases rapidly after addition of 20 mmNH4+ (Fig. 1A). In end3Δ cells defective in endocytosis (42.Raths S. Rohrer J. Crausaz F. Riezman H. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 55-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar), however, the permease activity remained substantially high (Fig. 1A), as shown previously with thermosensitive act1 mutant cells (20.Springael J.Y. André B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 1253-1263Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). The internalization process was also studied by using a green fluorescent protein-tagged version of the permease (Gap1-GFP). The Gap1-GFP protein is correctly directed to the cell surface where it is functional and largely sensitive toNH4+-triggered down-regulation. Internalization of the chimeric protein is somewhat delayed, however, compared with native Gap1, so that 2 h afterNH4+ addition some permease activity is still measured. 2J.-O. De Craene, E. Nikko, and B. André, unpublished observations. In proline-grown wild type cells (t = 0 min), Gap1-GFP was present mainly at the plasma membrane. Addition ofNH4+ induced progressive removal of the permease from the cell surface and its targeting to the vacuolar lumen (t = 120 min) (Fig. 1B). Immunodetection of Gap1 in crude extracts indeed showed degradation of the permease in response toNH4+ (Fig. 1C) (20.Springael J.Y. André B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 1253-1263Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar).Addition ofNH4+ resulted in a significant loss of Gap1 activity also in the various class E vpsΔ cells (Fig. 1A), but the internalized permease did not reach the lumen of the vacuole. Instead,NH4+ addition led to a progressive shift of Gap1-GFP in all vpsΔ cells from the cell surface to compartments next to the vacuole, with weak fluorescence on the vacuole limiting membrane, as indicated by FM4-64 staining (Fig. 1B). The structures adjacent to the vacuole likely represent the class E compartment (43.Vida T.A. Emr S.D. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 779-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (1127) Google Scholar), and the internalized Gap1 thus appears to accumulate mainly on the membrane limiting this compartment instead of being sorted to the vacuolar lumen. Accordingly, immunoblots showed that the Gap1 protein was not degraded in the various vpsΔ mutants (Fig. 1C). In all vpsΔ cells, addition ofNH4+ also induced the appearance of several additional bands above the main Gap1 signal. These were sustained during the whole experiment. As discussed below, these upper bands correspond to ubiquitin-conjugated forms of Gap1.Hence, Gap1 is normally internalized but not targeted to the vacuolar lumen in mutants lacking components of the ESCRT complexes. Instead, the permease accumulates in a limited number of punctate structures likely corresponding to the class E compartment, whereas a fraction of the protein also reaches the limiting vacuolar membrane.Gap1 Is Internalized but Recycled Back to the Cell Surface in bro1Δ Cells—Bro1 was recently described as a class E Vps factor associated with endosomal membranes and required for MVB sorting of CPS (35.Odorizzi G. Katzmann D.J. Babst M. Audhya A. Emr S.D. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 1893-1903Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Interestingly, we independently identified Bro1 as a factor essential to normal ubiquitination and subsequent down-regulation of Gap1 and other permeases including the uracil permease Fur4 (30.Springael J.Y. Nikko E. André B. Marini A.M. FEBS Lett. 2002; 517: 103-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). After ammonium addition to bro1Δ mutant cells, Gap1 remains highly active and is not degraded (Fig. 2, A and C) (30.Springael J.Y. Nikko E. André B. Marini A.M. FEBS Lett. 2002; 517: 103-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Consistently, most of the Gap1-GFP remained at the cell surface even 2 h afterNH4+ addition (Fig. 2B). However, some fluorescence was clearly found also on the vacuole limiting membrane, as indicated by staining with the lipophilic dye FM4-64. This suggests that in bro1Δ cells a fraction of the Gap1 is internalized but that its sorting to the vacuolar lumen is impaired. This phenotype is markedly different from that displayed by the above-mentioned class E Vps-factor mutants, where Gap1 is internalized and accumulates largely in the class E compartment, whereas only a fraction of the permease reaches the limiting membrane of the vacuole.Fig. 2A recycling defect restores ubiquitin-dependent internalization of Gap1 in bro1Δ cells.A, Gap1 activity was measured in wild type (Wt) (▪, EK008), bro1Δ (□, EN076), ypt6Δ (•, CJ013), and bro1Δ ypt6Δ cells (○, 36216b) transformed with plasmid YCpGap1 and in bro1Δ ypt6Δ cells transformed with the YCpGap1K9K16 plasmid (▴, 36216b) before (t = 0 min) and several times afterNH4+ addition, as in Fig. 1. B, location of Gap1-GFP before (t = 0 min) and after (t = 120 min)NH4+ addition to wild type (EK008), bro1Δ (EN076), and bro1Δ ypt6Δ cells (36216b) transformed with plasmid pJOD10. Note the absence of fluorescence in the vacuolar lumen both in bro1▵ and bro1▵ ypt6▵ cells. Cells were labeled with FM4-64 to stain the vacuolar membrane and endosomal compartments. C, Western analysis of Gap1 in total protein extracts prepared before (t = 0 min) and at several times after addition ofNH4+. Strains were as in A.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)That Gap1 resides largely at the plasma membrane in bro1Δ cells afterNH4+ addition suggests that Bro1 might play a role in some early steps of endocytosis (e.g. in Gap1 ubiquitination) in addition to MVB sorting. Alternatively, Gap1 might be efficiently internalized in bro1Δ cells but not correctly sorted to the vacuole. As a consequence, the permease would largely recycle back to the cell surface, a smaller fraction being missorted to the limiting vacuolar membrane (Fig. 2B). To test the latter hypothesis, we isolated bro1Δ strains containing additional mutations that impair transport from the endosomes to the trans-Golgi network (TGN), a step required for recycling of Chs3 (chitin synthase III) and Snc1 (v-SNARE) from the endocytic pathway back to the plasma membrane (44.Holthuis J.C.

Cell. 2000; 11: 23-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Endosome-to-Golgi transport depends on several factors, such as the Golgi-associated GTPase Ypt6, the VFT complex (Vps51-Vps52-Vps53-Vps54), and the late Golgi/endosomal SNARE proteins Tlg1 and Tlg2 (44.Holthuis J.C.

https://openalex.org/W2105380293,"We identified Neisseria meningitidis lipooligosaccharide (LOS) as an acceptor for complement component C4b (C4b). Phosphoethanolamine (PEA) residues on the second heptose (HepII) residue in the LOS core structure formed amide linkages with C4b. PEA at the 6-position of HepII (6-PEA) was more efficient than 3-PEA in binding C4b. Strains bearing 6-PEA bound more C4b than strains with 3-PEA and were more susceptible to complement-mediated killing in serum bactericidal assays. Deleting 3-PEA from a strain that expressed both 3- and 6-PEA simultaneously on HepII did not decrease C4b binding. Glycose chain extension of the first heptose residue (HepI) influenced the nature of the C4b-LOS linkage. Predominantly ester C4b-LOS bonds were seen when lacto-N-neotetraose formed the terminus of the glycose chain extension of HepI with 3-PEA on HepII in the LOS core. Related LOS species with more truncated chain extensions from HepI bound C4b via amide linkages to 3-PEA on HepII. However, 6-PEA in the LOS core bound C4b even when the glycose chain from HepI bore lacto-N-neotetraose at the terminus. The C4A isoform exclusively formed amide linkages, whereas C4B bound meningococci preferentially via ester linkages. These data may serve to explain the preponderance of 3-PEA-bearing meningococci among clinical isolates, because 6-PEA enhances C4b binding that may facilitate clearance of 6-PEA-bearing strains resulting from enhanced serum killing by the classical pathway of complement.

Complement forms an important arm of the innate immune system that combats neisserial infections. Deficiencies of terminal complement components (C5-C9) predispose individuals to recurrent neisserial infections (1Ross S.C. Densen P. Medicine (Baltimore). 1984; 63: 243-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar, 2Fijen C.A. Kuijper E.J. te Bulte M.T. Daha M.R. Dankert J. Clin. Infect. Dis. 1999; 28: 98-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The classical pathway of complement is essential to mediate in vitro killing by serum (3Ingwer I. Petersen B.H. Brooks G. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1978; 92: 211-220PubMed Google Scholar). Activation of the classical pathway is initiated by binding of the C1 complex to antibodies bound to an antigen on the bacterial surface. Activated C1s in the complex first cleaves C4 to C4b, which binds covalently to the bacterial surface, and then cleaves C2 that binds to C4b, leading to the formation of the C4b2a complex, which is the C3-convertase of the classical pathway. Binding of a C3 molecule to or close to the classical pathway C3-convertase imparts C5-convertase activity to the enzyme complex (reviewed in Ref. 4Walport M.J. N. Engl. J. Med. 2001; 344: 1058-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (2427) Google Scholar). Activation of C4 results from the separation of 77 amino acids (C4a) from the N-terminal end of the C4 α-chain by C1s, resulting in the formation of the metastable C4b molecule. This results in the activation of the internal thioester bond of C4b (5Law S.K. Lichtenberg N.A. Levine R.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 7194-7198Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), so that the carbonyl group linked to sulfur (the native thioester) becomes more electrophilic (i.e. an electron acceptor) and reacts readily with nucleophilic groups (i.e. electron-donating groups) such as -OH to form an ester linkage or with -NH2 to form an amide linkage (6Dodds A.W. Ren X.D. Willis A.C. Law S.K. Nature. 1996; 379: 177-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Alternatively, the carbonyl group can react with water and become hydrolyzed. There are two isoforms of C4 present in normal human serum, called C4A and C4B (7Awdeh Z.L. Alper C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 3576-3580Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). A histidine residue in the α-chain at position 1106 imparts to C4B the ability to form ester linkages. The presence of an aspartic acid residue at position 1106 results in C4A functionality and preferential amide bond formation with target -NH2 groups (8Carroll M.C. Fathallah D.M. Bergamaschini L. Alicot E.M. Isenman D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6868-6872Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). C4A plays an important role in the clearance of immune complexes from serum, and deficiency of this molecule predisposes individuals to autoimmune disorders (9Hartmann D. Fremeaux-Bacchi V. Weiss L.

We have characterized (in detail) the role of the position of phosphoethanolamine (PEA) on the distal heptose (HepII) chain, and the influence of glycose extensions of HepI chain in determining the nature of the C4b-LOS linkage.

Vogel U. Muhlenhoff M. Gerardy-Schahn R. Frosch M. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1997; 257: 28-34PubMed Google Scholar). We first constructed a derivative of plasmid pHC4 (24Claus H. Vogel U. Muhlenhoff M. Gerardy-Schahn R. Frosch M. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1997; 257: 28-34PubMed Google Scholar) that contained the siaD gene of a serogroup W-135 strain, called strain 171, cloned at the HindIII site of pHC4. TnMax5 was inserted at position 2570 of the siaD gene using the pTnMax5 system (25Haas R. Kahrs A.F. Facius D. Allmeier H. Schmitt R. Meyer T.F. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 130: 23-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The resulting plasmid was designated pHC4siaD::TnMax5 and was used to insertionally inactivate the siaD gene of serogroup Y strain 2220 to yield the unencapsulated mutant called Y2220 siaD in this study. The gene coding for the enzyme responsible for LOS sialylation, called α(2,3)-sialyltransferase (lst), was inactivated using pCR-Script-lst/Kan, as described previously (27Vogel U. Claus H. Heinze G. Frosch M. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 954-957Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). LOS mutants with a single Glc residue on the HepI chain (Glc → HepI; phenotypically similar to galE mutants) were constructed by insertional inactivation of the lgtE gene as described previously (28Minor S.Y. Banerjee A. Gotschlich E.C. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 6526-6534Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) (plasmid was the kind gift of Dr. Asesh Banerjee, Catholic University). lgtA mutants (Gal → Glc → HepI) were constructed according to previously published methods (29Jennings M.P. Hood D.W. Peak I.R. Virji M. Moxon E.R. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 18: 729-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. Using MC58 DNA as the template, the products of a PCR using primers GH1 (5′-ATT GCG CGC ACC GAT GCA-3′) and GH2 (5′-ATC TAC CGC TTT ATC CAC TC-3′) were cloned into vector pPCR-Script Amp SK(+) from the pPCR-Script Amp cloning kit (Stratagene). The cloned PCR product contains the lgtA, lgtB, and lgtE genes. To interrupt the lgtA gene by homologous recombination, we constructed a plasmid (pNT2) using the HincII fragment containing the kanamycin resistance cassette from pUC4Kan (Amersham Biosciences) that was then cloned into a StyI site in the lgtA gene. Kanamycin-resistant transformants of N. meningitidis were screened by reactivity with mAb L8 (30Schneider H. Hale T.L. Zollinger W.D. Seid Jr., R. Hammack C.A. Griffiss J.M. Infect. Immun. 1984; 45: 544-549Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Zollinger W.D. Mandrell R.E. Infect. Immun. 1983; 40: 257-264Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) in whole cell enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays and by migration distance of LOS assessed by silver-stained 16% Tricine gels (32Schägger H. Von-Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10505) Google Scholar). To make pLgtF in order to interrupt the lgtF gene, we amplified chromosomal DNA from the Neisseria gonorrhoeae strain FA19 with primers RFAK147 (5′-AAG CCC GGG CGT ATG TTT GGG CTT TTT TGC-3′) and RFAK3780 (5′-GTG AAG CTT ATA TTG CAT CCA ATA ATT TGT CG-3′). This amplicon was cloned into the SmaI/HindIII site of pK18up (33Levin J.C. Stein D.C. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 4571-4575Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A PstI site was introduced into this plasmid at the beginning of the lgtF coding sequence using primers LGTF-PSTIF (5′-CAA CTG CAG ACA ATA TTT CAA CAA GTT CAA CAA-3′) and LGTF-PSTIR (5′-TGT CTG CAG TTG TCG TAC GTA TAA TGG TAC-3′). This yielded an intermediate plasmid, pRFAK2-1(pstI). We amplified a region of the ω-interposon that confers resistance to spectinomycin (34Prentki P. Krisch H.M. Gene (Amst.). 1984; 29: 303-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (1342) Google Scholar) using primers Omega-F (5′-CCA CTG CAG CAA TTC CCC TGC TCG CGC AGG-3′) and Omega-R (5′-CCA CTG CAG CAG CTT AGT AAA GCC CTC GCT-3′) (PstI sites underlined). Amplification with these primers removed the transcriptional stop signals contained within this interposon, such that the insertion would not disrupt the expression of the downstream rfaK gene. PEA at the 3-position of HepII was deleted by insertional inactivation of the lpt-3 (lipopolysaccharide phosphoethanolamine transferase-3) gene. The construction of MC58 galE and its isogenic mutant lacking 3-PEA on HepII (MC58 galE lpt-3) has been described previously (35Mackinnon F.G. Cox A.D. Plested J.S. Tang C.M. Makepeace K. Coull P.A. Wright J.C. Chalmers R. Hood D.W. Richards J.C. Moxon E.R. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 43: 931-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Chromosomal DNA prepared from MC58 lpt-3 was used to transform the siaD, siaD lst, and siaD lgtA derivatives of Y2220 to interrupt the lpt-3 gene. The presence of a remaining single PEA in the inner core of LOS purified from the three lpt-3 mutants was confirmed by mass spectrometric analysis of O-deacylated LOS (described below). Sera and Complement Reagents—Normal human serum (NHS) was pooled from 10 healthy volunteers with no history of gonococcal or meningococcal infections or vaccination and stored at -80 °C. Serum containing either only C4A or C4B (C4B- and C4A-deficient, respectively) was obtained from individuals without deficiencies in other known complement components, as described in detail previously (36Seppanen M. Lokki M.L. Timonen T. Lappalainen M. Jarva H. Jarvinen A. Sarna S. Valtonen V. Meri S. Clin. Infect. Dis. 2001; 33: 1604-1607Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Pure C4b was purchased from Advanced Research Technologies (San Diego, CA) for use as a control in Western blotting experiments. Antibodies—Polyclonal sheep anti-human C4 (Biodesign, Saco, ME) was used in Western blotting experiments. mAb L8 that is specific for the Gal→ Glc→ HepI LOS epitope (30Schneider H. Hale T.L. Zollinger W.D. Seid Jr., R. Hammack C.A. Griffiss J.M. Infect. Immun. 1984; 45: 544-549Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was used as hybridoma supernatant (containing ∼20 μg/ml specific mAb). C4b bound to bacteria was quantified using fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled polyclonal sheep anti-human C4 antibody (Biodesign, Saco, ME). IgG and IgM bound to bacteria were measured using fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-human IgG or anti-human IgM (both from Sigma), respectively. Western Blotting—3 × 108 bacteria suspended in Hanks' balanced salt solution (HBSS) containing 0.15 mm CaCl2 and 1 mm MgCl2 (HBSS2+) were incubated with NHS (concentration specified for each experiment) in a final reaction volume of 500 μl for 30 min at 37 °C. Bacteria were washed twice in HBSS2+ and divided into two aliquots that were treated with either buffer alone (to detect C4b bound to targets via ester and amide linkages), or 1 m methylamine, pH 11, for 1 h at 37 °C, in a final reaction volume of 40 μl, which releases ester-linked but not amide-linked C4b (37Law S.K.

Direct determination of the specific amide-bound C4b is not possible, because it cannot be separated intact from acceptor surfaces without altering its primary structure. Samples were then digested with lithium dodecyl sulfate sample buffer (NuPAGE® LDS sample buffer; Invitrogen) containing 2-mercaptoethanol (10% final concentration) and resolved on NuPAGE® Novex 4-12% Bis-Tris gradient gels using NuPAGE® MOPS running buffer (Invitrogen) (100 mV for 15 h at 4 °C). Western blotting was performed as described previously (40Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44939) Google Scholar). C4b was detected using anti-C4 at a dilution of 1:1000 in PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 and disclosed as previously described (41Blake M.S. Johnston K.H. Russell-Jones G.J. Gotschlich E.C. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 136: 175-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (1631) Google Scholar). L8 LOS was detected using undiluted tissue culture supernatant containing mAb L8. Flow Cytometry—Quantitative analysis of C4b, IgG, and IgM bound to bacteria that were incubated with NHS (concentration specified for each experiment) was carried out using flow cytometry as described previously (42Ram S. Cullinane M. Blom A. Gulati S. McQuillen D. Monks B. O'Connell C. Boden R. Elkins C. Pangburn M. Dahlback B. Rice P. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 193: 281-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Purification of LOS—LOS was purified from bacterial suspensions by the hot water-phenol extraction method, as described previously (43Westphal O. Luderitz O. Bister F. Z. Naturforsch. [B]. 1952; 7: 148-155Crossref Scopus (1044) Google Scholar). O-Deacylated LOS was prepared as described previously (44Cox A.D. Li J. Brisson J.R. Moxon E.R. Richards J.C. Carbohydr. Res. 2002; 337: 1435-1444Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) in ∼50% yield from the LOS. Core oligosaccharides were prepared according to the following procedure. LOS was hydrolyzed at 100 °C for 2 h in 2% acetic acid. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation (8000 × g, 20 min), and the supernatant solution was lyophilized, yielding core oligosaccharide (OS) in ∼50% yield. Mass Spectrometry—All ES-MS analyses were carried out as described previously (44Cox A.D. Li J. Brisson J.R. Moxon E.R. Richards J.C. Carbohydr. Res. 2002; 337: 1435-1444Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). CE-MS analysis was performed on a crystal model 310 CE instrument (AYI Unicam, Boston, MA) coupled to an API 3000 mass spectrometer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences/Sciex, Concord, Canada) via a microionspray interface. NMR Spectroscopy—Nuclear magnetic resonance experiments were performed on Varian INOVA NMR spectrometers. Measurements were made at 25 °C in D2O, subsequent to several lyophilizations with D2O. For the proton chemical shift reference, the methyl resonance of internal acetone at 2.225 ppm was used. Serum Bactericidal Assay—Serum bactericidal assays were performed as described previously (45McQuillen D.P. Gulati S. Rice P.A. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 236: 137-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Briefly, ∼2000 colony-forming units of bacteria grown to the midlog phase were resuspended in Gey's balanced salt solution (Invitrogen), and NHS was added to a final concentration as specified. The final volume of the reaction mixture was 150 μl. Duplicate 25-μl aliquots of the mixture were inoculated onto chocolate agar plates at the start of the assay (0 min) and after 30-min incubation at 37 °C. Survival was expressed as a percentage of bacteria surviving at 30 min relative to bacterial counts at 0 min. A Low Molecular Mass Molecule Is the Main Target for C4b: Evidence for Amide Linkages between C4b and the Target—In preliminary experiments, we observed that C4b targets on wild-type serogroup B strains MC58 and H44/76 (capsulated; LOS sialylated) (46Virji M. Kayhty H. Ferguson D.J. Alexandrescu C. Heckels J.E. Moxon E.R. Mol. Microbiol. 1991; 5: 1831-1841Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 47Holten E. J. Clin. Microbiol. 1979; 9: 186-188PubMed Google Scholar) and their siaD lst mutants (unencapsulated; LOS not sialylated) that were incubated with NHS were qualitatively identical in Western blot assays (data not shown); capsular polysaccharide only decreased the amount of C4b binding (48Ram S. Vogel U. Getzlaff S. Gulati S. Van der Ley P. Rice P.A. Twelfth International Pathogenic Neisseria Conference. Galveston, TX2000: 38Google Scholar). We proceeded to use the unencapsulated derivatives (siaD, siaD lst, and siaD lgtA deletion mutants) of group Y strain 2220. These mutants bound the highest amounts of C4b in flow cytometry assays (∼3-fold more fluorescence intensity than the corresponding derivatives of serogroup B meningococcal strain, MC58; data not shown). The siaD, siaD lst, and siaD lgtA mutants of strain Y2220 were incubated with 10% NHS, and after extensive washing to remove unbound C4/C4b, bacterial lysates were treated with 1 m methylamine, pH 11, to dissociate ester-linked, but not amide-linked, C4b from its target(s) prior to electrophoresis, Western blotting, and probing with anti-human C4 Ab. Organisms that were treated with NHS and then lysed in sample buffer served as controls with all their covalent linkages to C4b intact. Fig. 1 shows that samples treated with buffer alone, the major C4b target adduct has a molecular mass that lies between 87 kDa (the mass of the α′-chain of C4b, as seen in the lane marked as pure C4b) and 95 kDa (molecular mass of the intact C4 α-chain, as seen in the NHS lanes). The adducts formed with siaD lgtA migrated faster than the complexes seen with siaD or siaD lst (Fig. 1). This pattern suggested that LOS was the possible acceptor molecule, because the three isogenic mutants differed only in their LOS molecule, with the siaD lgtA mutant possessing the lowest and the siaD mutant possessing the highest Mr LOS. As expected, methylamine treatment resulted in the appearance of the released C4b α′-chain (87 kDa) previously ester-linked to organisms (Fig. 1). The C4b low Mr acceptors on the siaD lgtA strains were least affected by methylamine treatment, and most of the C4b bound to this strain was via amide linkages, as evidenced by minimal “released” C4b α′-chain (87 kDa) (Fig. 1). The faint adducts seen at ∼135 and ∼140 kDa also resisted methylamine treatment, suggesting that these acceptors too formed amide linkages with C4b (Fig. 1). LOS Is the low MrAcceptor Molecule for C4b as Well as C3b—The results above suggested that LOS was the likely acceptor for C4b. To confirm this, we used anti-LOS mAb L8 (specific for the LOS of the siaD lgtA mutant) to co-localize LOS with C4b-related (co-migrating) bands on Western blots. Fig. 2 shows the presence of L8-reactive bands migrating at the same velocity as C4-reactive bands. Organisms alone and organisms incubated with EDTA-treated serum (which blocks complement activation) showed no bands at that site. Methylamine treatment did not diminish the intensity of the L8-reactive band that co-migrated with the C4-reactive bands. A fainter L8- and C4-reactive band was seen at ∼74 kDa. This could represent LOS bound to a partially processed form of C4b, called C4b′ (49Nagasawa S. Ichihara C. Stroud R.M. J. Immunol. 1980; 125: 578-582PubMed Google Scholar). C4b′ (also termed “nicked” C4b) is generated by (incomplete) cleavage of the α′-chain of C4b ∼17 kDa from the C-terminal end by factor I and C4b-binding protein and retains the ability to form C3-convertases (50Yamazaki M. Ichihara C. Nagasawa S. FEBS Lett. 1986; 208: 147-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). The “α′-chain” of C4b′ that is attached to the target comprises the N-terminal α3 (∼25 kDa) and the central C4d (∼45 kDa) fragments of the α′-chain of the C4b molecule. Attempts were made to co-localize the LOS of the siaD lst strain with the C4-reactive bands using anti-LOS mAb 3F11 (specific for the unsialylated lacto-N-neotetraose structure) (51Apicella M.A. Bennett K.M. Hermerath C.A. Roberts D.E. Infect. Immun. 1981; 34: 751-756Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) but were not successful, probably because C4b sterically hinders or obscures the 3F11 epitope. L8 reactivity was also seen corresponding to the higher molecular mass C4-reactive band at ∼170 kDa. This probably represented convertases assembled on LOS (covalent C3bα′-C4bα′ heterodimers coupled to LOS). We also observed mAb L8 reactivity in the lane containing opsonized organisms at ∼70 kDa (marked by an asterisk in Fig. 2), the intensity of which was markedly reduced by methylamine treatment. The molecular mass of this band was consistent with an adduct formed between the α1′-chain of iC3b (∼68 kDa) and the 3.6-kDa L8 LOS molecule. This was verified in a separate experiment showing that this adduct reacted with anti-iC3b mAb G-3E (52Iida K. Mitomo K. Fujita T. Tamura N. Immunology. 1987; 62: 413-417PubMed Google Scholar) (data not shown). PEA on LOS Is the Primary Amine That Participates in Forming Amide Linkages with C4b—The only commonly encountered primary amine on LOS that can participate in forming an amide linkage with C4b is PEA. To test the hypothesis that PEA was the acceptor site on LOS for C4b, we analyzed C4b binding to the siaD galE and siaD galE lpt-3 mutants of MC58 (the latter lacks 3-PEA from its LOS) (35Mackinnon F.G. Cox A.D. Plested J.S. Tang C.M. Makepeace K. Coull P.A. Wright J.C. Chalmers R. Hood D.W. Richards J.C. Moxon E.R. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 43: 931-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Strains were incubated with 30% NHS and treated with methylamine or buffer, and Western blotting was performed as described above. 30% serum concentration was used to enhance C4b deposition, thereby ensuring that C4b-LOS adducts on the PEA-less strains, if any, were visualized, and also because 3-PEA on HepII binds C4b less efficiently than 6-PEA (see below). Low Mr target-C4b adducts were seen in the lanes containing MC58 siaD galE, but not siaD galE lpt-3, when samples were treated with buffer alone (Fig. 3). The C4b-LOS adducts on MC58 siaD galE resisted methylamine treatment. In contrast, methylamine treatment of the siaD galE lpt-3 mutant resulted in the appearance of free (or released) C4b α′-chain, suggesting that C4b bound to this strain predominantly via ester linkages. Collectively, these data suggest tha"

Although the impact of smoking on human health is well defined from the medical point of view, surprisingly little is known about the mechanisms by which tobacco smoke mediates its disastrous effects. Here, we demonstrate that tobacco smoke dramatically changes vascular endothelial cell and tissue morphology, leading to a loss of endothelial barrier function within minutes. Long-term exposure of endothelial cells to tobacco smoke extracts induces necrosis that may trigger a pro-inflammatory status of the vessel wall. Pre-incubation of the extracts without cells for 6 h at 37 degrees C led to a complete loss of activity. Further, the endothelium could be rescued by changing to fresh medium even at times when the extracts had lost their activity. Finally, we show that N-acetyl cysteine and statins inhibit the adverse tobacco smoke effects."
https://openalex.org/W1993442551,"Mice lacking type XVIII collagen have defects in the posterior part of the eye, including delayed regression of the hyaloid vasculature and poor outgrowth of the retinal vessels. We report here that these mice also have a fragile iris and develop atrophy of the ciliary body. The irises of Col18a1-/- mice can be seen to adhere to the lens and cornea. After the pupils begin to function, the double layer of epithelial cells separates at the apical cell contacts, leading to defoliation of its posterior pigment epithelial cell layer, and extracellular material begins to accumulate in the basement membrane zones of the iris. In contrast to the iris epithelia, where no clear signs of cellular atrophy were detected, the lack of type XVIII collagen resulted in atrophy of the pigmented epithelial cells of the ciliary body, and there were also ultrastructural abnormalities in the basement membrane zones. These changes did not lead to chronically elevated intraocular pressures, however. Our results indicate that type XVIII collagen is needed for the integrity of the epithelial basement membranes of the iris and the ciliary body and that its gene should therefore be taken into account as a new potential cause of anterior segment disorders in the eye."

Moreover, clinical trials demonstrated an improved collateralization after injection of bone marrow cells. In the present study, the expression of arteriogenic factors in bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDM) was measured to verify the potential of these cells to influence collateral artery growth. GM-CSF induced in BMDM the expression of monocyte chemoattractive protein (MCP)-1, matrix-metalloproteinase (MMP)-12, and arginase-1-the latter also showing a remarkable increase in activity. During in vivo induced arteriogenesis, the accumulation rate of macrophages around proliferating collaterals was significantly increased. We also show that MCP-1 is found to be mainly expressed in the media of the vessel wall, MMP-12 in macrophages of the adventitia, and arginase at both locations. This study provides for the first time a comprehensive analysis of GM-CSF/TGFbeta1-regulated arteriogenic factors in BMDM and supports the hypothesis that arteriogenesis is a multistage mechanism, including monocyte/macrophage adhesion and transmigration, pro-arteriogenic cytokine expression, degradation of connective tissue, and collagen synthesis regulation. Selective modulation of these mechanisms as well as cell-based therapies supplying arteriogenic factors in vivo point toward new strategies to influence collateral artery growth."
https://openalex.org/W2136229980,"Ligands that stabilize the telomeric G-rich single-stranded DNA overhang into G-quadruplex can be considered as potential antitumor agents that block telomere replication. Ligand 12459, a potent G-quadruplex ligand that belongs to the triazine series, has been previously shown to induce both telomere shortening and apoptosis in the human A549 cell line as a function of its concentration and time exposure. We show here that A549 clones obtained after mutagenesis and selected for resistance to the short term effect of ligand 12459 frequently displayed hTERT transcript overexpression (2–6-fold). Overexpression of hTERT was also characterized in two resistant clones (JFD10 and JFD18) as an increase in telomerase activity, leading to an increase in telomere length. An increased frequency of anaphase bridges was also detected in JFD10 and JFD18, suggesting an alteration of telomere capping functions. Transfection of either hTERT or DN-hTERT cDNAs into A549 cells did not confer resistance or hypersensitivity to the short term effect of ligand 12459, indicating that telomerase expression is not the main determinant of the antiproliferative effect of ligand 12459. In contrast, transfection of DN-hTERT cDNA into resistant JFD18 cells restored sensitivity to apoptotic concentrations of ligand 12459, suggesting that telomerase does participate in the resistance to this G-quadruplex ligand.

Telomeres are essential to maintain the stability of chromosome ends and are synthesized by a specialized enzyme called telomerase. Telomerase is overexpressed in a large number of tumors and is involved in cell immortalization and tumorigenesis, whereas it is not described as being expressed in most somatic cells (1.McEachern M.J. Krauskopf A. Blackburn E.H. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2000; 34: 331-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar). A recent work showed that telomerase was efficiently expressed in S phase from normal cycling cells and played an important function to delay the onset of replicative senescence by maintaining the 3′ telomeric overhang integrity independently from overall telomere length regulation (2.Masutomi K. Yu E.Y. Khurts S. Ben-Porath I. Currier J. Metz G.B. Brooks M.W. Kaneto S. Murakami S. DeCaprio J.A. Weinberg R.A. Stewart S.A. Hahn W.C.

Differential expression of telomerase between normal and cancer cells was the initial rationale for the evaluation of telomerase inhibitors as potential anticancer agents (3.Sharma S. Raymond E.

Since telomerase is expressed in normal proliferating human cells, the useful therapeutic index of these inhibitors has to be carefully determined in future studies. Folding of the telomeric G-rich single-stranded overhang into a quadruplex DNA has been found to inhibit telomerase activity.

The intracellular existence of G-quadruplexes was recently demonstrated in the telomeres from ciliates (9.Schaffitzel C. Berger I. Postberg J. Hanes J. Lipps H.J. Pluckthun A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8572-8577Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). G-quadruplex could also be formed from duplex telomeric DNA under appropriate ionic and pH conditions (10.Phan A.T. Mergny J.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 4618-4625Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar) or in the presence of specific ligands (11.Kim M.Y. Gleason-Guzman M. Izbicka E. Nishioka D. Hurley L.H. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 3247-3256PubMed Google Scholar). The c-myc gene promotor sequence allowed the formation of a G-quadruplex that corresponded to the first demonstration of the physiologic relevance of such a structure in mammalian cells (12.Siddiqui-Jain A. Grand C.L. Bearss D.J. Hurley L.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 11593-11598Crossref PubMed Scopus (1795) Google Scholar). The 2,4,6-triamino-1,3,5-triazine derivatives are potent telomerase inhibitors that bind to telomeric G-quadruplexes (13.Riou J.F. Guittat L. Mailliet P. Laoui A. Renou E. Petitgenet O.

In this series, 12459 (Fig. 1a) is one of the most selective G-quadruplex-interacting compounds and it displayed a 25-fold selectivity when telomerase inhibition was compared with the Taq polymerase inhibition by using the TRAP 1The abbreviations used are: TRAPtelomere repeat amplification protocolFISHfluorescence in situ hybridizationTRFtelomeric restriction fragmentRTreverse transcriptaseDAPI4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindoleCHAPS3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acidhTERThuman TERThTRhuman TRhnRNPA1heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1Gygrays.-G4 assay (14.Gomez D.

Guittat and J.-L. Mergny, unpublished results. In addition, 12459 is able to induce both telomere shortening and apoptosis in the human lung adenocarcinoma A549 cell line as a function of its concentration and time exposure (13.Riou J.F.

Telomerase inhibition usually resulted in a long term inhibition of cell proliferation because of the delay in eroding telomere to a critical length that impairs cell division (1.McEachern M.J. Krauskopf A. Blackburn E.H. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2000; 34: 331-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar). However, inhibition of telomerase activity could induce dramatic and rapid consequences on cell viability in cell lines bearing critically short telomeres (15.Zhang X. Mar V. Zhou W. Harrington L. Robinson M.O. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2388-2399Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar) or mutations in the telomerase RNA template (16.Guiducci C. Cerone M.A. Bacchetti S.

Furthermore, inactivation of hTERT in normal human cells was recently shown to decrease cell proliferation and cell cycle progression (2.Masutomi K. Yu E.Y. Khurts S. Ben-Porath I. Currier J. Metz G.B. Brooks M.W. Kaneto S. Murakami S. DeCaprio J.A. Weinberg R.A. Stewart S.A. Hahn W.C. Cell. 2003; 114: 241-253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar). Therefore, the peculiar feature of 12459 to inhibit telomerase activity and to induce short term inhibition of proliferation in A549 cells prompted us to determine whether such telomerase inhibition has a link with the antiproliferative effect of this class of G-quadruplex ligands. For that purpose, we have established 12459-resistant clones, using the short term antiproliferative activity of 12459 as a selection criterion and investigated their resistance phenotype. Induction of resistance to 12459 is characterized by a functional overexpression of telomerase activity in half of the clones analyzed. Resistant clones presented an increased incidence of anaphase bridges that reflected telomere capping dysfunctions. We also showed that transfection of hTERT in A549 cells was not sufficient to confer resistance to 12459. In contrast, transfection of DN-hTERT in a resistant clone abolished resistance to 12459. Oligonucleotides and Compounds—All oligonucleotides were synthesized and purified by Eurogentec (Seraing, Belgium). Triazine derivatives 12459 and 115405 were synthesized according to Ref. 45Mailliet, P., Riou, J. F., Mergny, J. L., Laoui, A., Lavelle, F., and Petitgenet, O. (2001) Patent WO 0140218Google Scholar. Telomestatin was purified according to Ref. 18.Shin-ya K. Wierzba K. Matsuo K. Ohtani T. Yamada Y. Furihata K. Hayakawa Y. Seto H. J. Am. Chem.

Solutions of compounds were prepared in 10 mm Me2SO, except telomestatin, which was prepared at 5 mm in MeOH/Me2SO (50:50). Further dilutions were made in water. Telomerase Assay—Telomerase extracts were prepared from A549, JFD10, and JFD18 cells as described before (20.Fu W. Begley J.G. Killen M.W. Mattson M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7264-7271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). The TRAP assay was performed in the presence of an internal control (internal telomerase assay standard) corresponding to the 36-mer (5′-AATCCGTCGAGCAGAGTTAAAAGGCCGAGAAGCGAT-3′) according to Ref. 21.Krupp G. Kuhne K. Tamm S. Klapper W. Heidorn K. Rott A. Parwaresch R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 919-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar. Cell Culture Conditions and Selection of Resistant Clones—A549 human lung carcinoma cell line was from the American Type Culture Collection. These cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with Glutamax (Invitrogen), supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and antibiotics. 50 × 106 cells were seeded into 10 tissue culture flasks and were treated for 48 h with 300 μg/ml ethyl methyl sulfonate. Cells were washed and cultured in ethyl methyl sulfonate-free medium for 4 days and then treated with 10 μm12459 for 4 weeks. Every 4 days, medium and 12459 were changed in order to eliminate dead cells and cellular debris. Remaining cells were further cloned in soft agar (104 cells/dishes) containing either 5 or 10 μm12459. After 2 weeks, surviving clones (100 clones from each selection condition) were collected from agar using a 1-ml tip and were individually plated in 96-well culture plates in the presence or absence of 12459 (10 μm). 15 of 200 clones (JFD1, JFD2, JFD3, JFD4, JFD5, JFD7, JFD8, JFD9, JFD10, JFD11, JFD12, JFD14, JFD15, JFD16, and JFD18) were able to grow in the presence of 12459 and were further cultured in drug-free medium. An 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide survival assay (4 days) in the presence of various cytotoxic compounds was performed in 96-well plates, each point in quadruplicate, as recommended by the manufacturer (Sigma). Due to an interference of 12459 with the coloration induced by the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide, a survival assay for this compound was performed in 6-well plates, each point in triplicate. The number of viable cells was counted after trypan blue dye exclusion in a hematocytometer. For apoptosis determination, A549 cells were seeded on 4-well coverslides and treated with 12459. Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and stained with Hoechst 33342 at 1 μg/ml. cells with apoptotic nuclei were counted in a different part of the slide by fluorescence microscopy. Results corresponded to the mean of three separate determinations ± S.D. relative to control untreated cells. Radiation survival was determined by clonogenic assays. Cells were irradiated in culture medium at room temperature in an IBL-637 (137Cs) irradiator (CIS-Biointernational, Saclay, France) at a dose rate of 1.05 Gy/min. Experiments were performed in triplicate or more. Colonies were allowed to grow for 8 days and then fixed with methanol, stained, and scored. Small colonies (<50 cells) were disregarded. Radiation survival curves were drawn for best fit to a linear quadratic equation, as usual: ln S/S0 = –αD – βD2, where S0 represents the clonogenic efficiency, S is the residual survival, D is the radiation dose, and α and β are numerical parameters characterizing the radiosensitivity of the cell line. Infections of A549 and JFD18 Cells—Lentiviral supernatants containing hTERT, DN-hTERT cDNAs, or control HPV vector were a generous gift from Dr. Annelise Bennaceur-Griscelli (Institut Gustave Roussy, Villejuif, France). A549 or JFD18 cells at 1.5 × 105 cells/ml were infected at a multiplicity of infection equal to 50 in the presence of 4 μg/ml Polybrene in complete culture medium. Enhanced green fluorescent protein-positive cells were sorted 5 days later by flow cytometry according to a high or low intensity of fluorescence. Populations that expressed a high intensity of fluorescence were seeded in 25-cm2 flasks and cultivated for up to 81 days. Cytotoxicity and clonogenic survival experiments were performed on cultures between days 60 and 80 after infection. Clonogenic survival assays were performed with 5 × 103 cells from A549- or JFD18-transfected cell lines according to the previously published procedure (22.Riou J.F. Naudin A. Lavelle F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 187: 164-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) in the presence or absence of 5 μm12459. Results represent the mean value ± S.D. of triplicate determinations. RNA Preparation and RT1-PCR Assays—Total RNA was isolated from 1 × 106 cells using Tri-Reagent (Sigma) as recommended by the manufacturer. One μg of total RNA was reverse transcribed in a 20-μl reaction volume using random hexamers, avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase, and the reaction buffer provided in the reverse transcription kit (Promega). The volume of the sample was adjusted to 200 μl with diethylpyrocarbonate-treated water at the end of the reaction. A 10-μl aliquot of cDNA was used for PCR amplifications. hTERT was amplified using the forward TERT2109 primer (5′-GCCTGAGCTGTACTTTGTCAA-3′) and the reverse TERT2531R primer (5-AGGCTGCAGAGCAGCGTGGAGAGG-3′) according to Ref. 23.Yi X. Shay J.W. Wright W.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 4818-4825Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, with the following cycling conditions: 94 °C for 2 min, followed by 30 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 58 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s. Amplification of β2-microglobulin was performed as a control using the same PCR conditions with primer forward (5′-ACCCCCACTGAAAAAGATGA-3′) and primer reverse (5′-ATCTTCAAACCTCCATGATG-3′). Amplifications of the different genes were performed using the same PCR cycle conditions using the following primers: hTR, forward primer (5′-TCTAACCCTAACTGAGAAGGGCGTAG-3′) and reverse primer (5′-GTTTGCTCTAGAATGAACGGTGGAAG-3′); TRF1, forward primer (5′-AGCAGAAGAGCCACTGAAAGCA-3′) and reverse primer (5′-CTTCGCTGTCTGAGGAAATCAG-3′); TRF2, forward primer (5′-TGAAAACGAAACTTCAGCCCCG-3′) and reverse primer (5′-GTGCTGCCTGAACTTGAAACAG-3′); hPot1, forward primer (5′-CCAGCTCTGCTTTGCATCTTT-3′) and reverse primer (5′-CAAGAGCTGACAAGTCAGGTCA-3′); BLM, forward primer (5′-GCCCTACAGGGAATTCTATG-3′) and reverse primer (5′-GTTTCAGCCCAGTTGCTACT-3′); WRN, forward primer (5′-CTTCCACCAACTCTCTGTTTG-3′) and reverse primer (5′-CTGTGATAATTGCAGGTCCAG-3′); NCL, forward primer (5′-AATGAGGGCAGAGCAATCAGG-3′) and reverse primer (5′-GTCAGTAACTATCCTTGCCCG-3′); hnRNPA1, forward primer (5′-ACGAAACCAAGGTGGCTATG-3′) and reverse primer (5′-AGCGTCACGATCAGACTGTT-3′). Amplified products were resolved on 6% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels in 1× TBE and stained with SYBR Green I (Roche Applied Science). Quantification was performed by a CCD camera (Bioprint) and a BioCapt software analysis, relative to the signal of β2-microglobulin. Results represent the mean value of two or three independent RNA extractions, as indicated. Telomeric Restriction Size Fragment Determination—Genomic DNA was digested with HinfI/RsaI restriction enzymes and electrophoresed in 0.8% agarose gels in 1× TBE buffer. DNA were transferred onto hybond N+ membrane (Amersham Biosciences) and then prehybridized for 2 h at 65 °C in 7% SDS, 1% bovine serum albumin, and 0.5 m NaPO4, pH 8.0. A 0.7-kb telomere DNA probe (pUCTelo; a gift from Prof. E. Gilson, Ecole Normale Supèrieure, Lyon, France) was labeled with [α-32P]dCTP by random priming and was added to the solution. Hybridization was performed overnight at 65 °C. Membranes were washed twice with 0.2× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 65 °C for 15 min and then twice with 2× SSC, 0.1% SDS at room temperature. Telomeric smears were revealed by autoradiography, and the mean length of the telomere restriction fragment (TRF) corresponds to the peak of the densitometric integration curve from two separate experiments. FISH Analysis—Metaphase chromosome spreads were prepared from cells treated with colcemid (0.1 μg/ml, 1 h; Eurobio) and then hypotonic KCl and fixed in methanol/acetic acid (3:1, v/v). Fixed cells were dropped onto clean slides and left to dry overnight prior to hybridization with a telomeric specific (CCCTAA)3-Cy3 PNA probe (PerSeptive Biosystems) as described (24.Zijlmans J.M. Martens U.M. Poon S.S. Raap A.K. Tanke H.J. Ward R.K. Lansdorp P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7423-7428Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar) and staining with DAPI. Fluorescent signals were visualized under a UV microscope (Axioplan2; Zeiss) equipped with a computer-piloted filter wheel and were captured with a CCD camera (Photometrics-Sensys) using the Smart-Capture software (Vysis) (settings: gain = 3 (red), 1 (blue); binning = 4) and a fixed exposure time of 2 s. A flat field template was used to correct for unevenness in field illumination. Merged DAPI-Cy3 pseudocolor images were used to colocalize chromosomes and telomere signals. Original grayscale Cy3 images were saved for quantitative analysis using the Iplab Spectrum P software (Skanalytics). Overall telomere fluorescence was estimated by calculating the mean pixel value of the metaphase using an automatic segmentation protocol provided by the software. For the FISH localization of hTERT, metaphase preparations were cohybridized with a biotin-labeled BAC carrying the whole hTERT locus (25.Leem S.H. Londono-Vallejo J.A. Kim J.H. Bui H. Tubacher E. Solomon G. Park J.E. Horikawa I. Kouprina N. Barrett J.C. Larionov V. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 769-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) and a digoxigenin-labeled chromosome 5 painting. The probes were revealed using Texas Red-coupled avidin (Vector) and a fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated antidigoxigenin antibody (Sigma), respectively. Chromosomes were counterstained with DAPI, and fluorescent signals were visualized and captured as above. Merged DAPI-fluorescein isothiocyanate-Texas Red images were then obtained to count and localize hTERT loci. Anaphase Bridge Analysis—To determine the presence of anaphase bridges, cells were seeded on microscope slides and stained with Chromomycin A3 (Sigma). Images of anaphases were recorded with a confocal microscope (Bio-Rad MRC 1024) with excitation at 457 nm and emission at 530 nm. At least 50 metaphases were examined for sensitive A549 and JFD10- or JFD18-resistant clones. Resistant clones were obtained after ethyl methyl sulfonate mutagenesis and soft agar cloning selection (26.Gupta R.S. Gupta R. Eng B. Lock R.B. Ross W.E. Hertzberg R.P. Caranfa M.J. Johnson R.K. Cancer Res. 1988; 48: 6404-6410PubMed Google Scholar) in the presence of 10 μm12459 (Fig. 1b), a concentration of drug able to induce apoptosis with a 72–96-h delay (Fig. 2a). After the initial selection procedure, clones were plated and maintained in the absence of 12459. Among 200 clones isolated, 15 were confirmed for 12459 resistance in a 96-h cytotoxicity assay with resistance indexes varying from 3- to 5-fold (Fig. 2b). The resistance phenotype of the selected clones is stable for at least 6 months, when cells are grown in the absence of 12459. The level of hTERT transcripts was investigated in the resistant clones by RT-PCR analysis. hTERT presents a complex splicing pattern that includes an active +α, +β transcript and several inactive species including one major –β transcript and two minor –α and –α, –β transcripts that were barely detectable by RT-PCR (Fig. 3, a and b) (23.Yi X. Shay J.W. Wright W.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 4818-4825Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 27.Wick M. Zubov D. Hagen G. Gene (Amst.). 1999; 232: 97-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). The results indicated that the majority of the clones (8 of 13) presented an overexpression of the active +α, +β transcript, as evidenced for JFD1, JFD2, JFD3, JFD5, JFD10, JFD12, and JFD18 in Fig. 3, a and b. Three independent RT-PCR quantitative experiments indicated that hTERT expression was increased by 2-fold or 6-fold in JFD10 and JFD18, respectively, whereas it remained unchanged in JFD9 and JFD11 (Fig. 3c). The two hTERT-overexpressing clones, JFD10 and JFD18, were further analyzed for transcriptional levels of hTR (telomerase RNA subunit), hPot1, TRF1, TRF2 (telomere-binding proteins), BLM, WRN (RecQ helicases), nucleolin (NCL), and hnRNPA1 (Figs. 4 and 5). No significant modification of the transcript levels was found for these genes in the resistant clones, as compared with the parental cells.Fig. 4Expression of telomere-associated genes transcript in 12459-resistant clones.

In agreement with its (+α, +β) hTERT mRNA increase, telomerase activity was found augmented in JFD18 and JFD10 cells as compared with parental cells (Fig. 6a). In contrast, JFD9 and JFD11 did not present variations of telomerase activity, as compared with A549 cells (results not shown). The in vitro inhibitory effect of 12459 was also measured by the TRAP-G4 assay (14.Gomez D. Mergny J.L. Riou J.F. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 3365-3368PubMed Google Scholar) on extracts from A549 and JFD10-and JFD18-resistant cells. 12459 and telomestatin were found to inhibit TRAP-G4 with equal IC50 values for sensitive and resistant extracts (results not shown). These results excluded qualitative alterations of telomerase that could modify the sensitivity of the enzyme to the in vitro effect of these inhibitors. Treatment of A549 cells with 12459 was previously shown to down-regulate telomerase activity (13.Riou J.F. Guittat L. Mailliet P. Laoui A. Renou E. Petitgenet O. Megnin-Chanet F. Hélène C. Mergny J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 2672-2677Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). We have determined whether resistance phenotype is altering the effect of 12459 to down-regulate telomerase activity in JFD10 and JFD18 clones. As shown in Fig. 6b, telomerase activity measured by TRAP from A549-treated cells was strongly decreased. In contrast, telomerase activity measured by TRAP in JFD10 and JDF18 cells under 12459 treatment remained detectable with levels comparable with that from untreated resistant cells (Fig. 6, b and c), thus indicating that JFD10 and JFD18 are resistant to the 12459-induced down-regulation of telomerase activity. An expected consequence for the clones that presented increased (+α, +β) hTERT transcript levels is a gain in telomere length. We analyzed the telomere length in JFD10 and JFD18 after 3 months in culture in the absence of 12459. These two clones presented a mean length TRF of 8–9 kb, as compared with 6.5 kb measured in the parental A549 cells (Fig. 7a). Quantitative FISH analysis also indicated a 42% increase in the PNA probe hybridization intensity at telomeres for the JFD18 clone, as compared with A549 (Fig 7, b and c). Altogether, these data are consistent with an increase in telomerase activity in these clones due to hTERT overexpression. FISH analysis showed three copies of the chromosome 5, each bearing one copy of the hTERT gene in both A549 and JFD18 metaphases, suggesting that the hTERT overexpression did not result from locus amplification or chromosome duplication (Fig. 7d). The presence of increased anaphase bridges has been associated with a disruption of the capping function of the telomere (28.Reichenbach P. Hoss M. Azzalin C.M. Nabholz M. Bucher P. Lingner J. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 568-574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 29.van Steensel B. Smogorzewska A. de Lange T. Cell. 1998; 92: 401-413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1454) Google Scholar). Also, another G-quadruplex ligand, TMPyP4, has been found to induce anaphase bridges in sea urchin oocytes (30.Izbicka E. Nishioka D. Marcell V. Raymond E. Davidson K.K. Lawrence R.A. Wheelhouse R.T. Hurley L.H. Wu R.S. Von Hoff D.D. Anticancer Drug Des. 1999; 14: 355-365PubMed Google Scholar). We have determined whether 12459 may induce the formation of anaphase bridges in A549 and resistant clones. We were not able to detect a significant presence of anaphase bridges (<5%) for concentrations of 12459 ranging from 0.1 to 10 μm after a 48-h treatment with the drug in both sensitive and resistant cells (not shown). In contrast, untreated JFD10- and JFD18-resistant cells presented a higher basal level of anaphase bridges (25–30%) as compared with the A549-sensitive cell line (less than 5%). Typical images of anaphase bridges obtained with A549, JFD10, and JFD18 cell lines are shown in Fig. 8a. In the JFD18 clon"
https://openalex.org/W2126941248,"The cardiac potassium channel encoded by the human ether-à-go-go related gene (HERG) is blocked by a diverse array of common therapeutic compounds. Even transient exposure to such agents may provoke the life-threatening cardiac arrhythmia torsades de pointes in some, but not all, individuals. Although the molecular and genetic factors predicting such wide variability in drug response remain unclear, known sequence variations within the coding region of HERG do not explain the adverse drug response in many cases. Although other proteins can modulate HERG function, no studies have identified protein partners capable of limiting the pharmacological sensitivity of HERG. Here we show that KCR1, a protein identified previously in rat cerebellum, is a plasma membrane-associated protein expressed at the RNA level in the human heart and can be immunoprecipitated with HERG. Functionally, KCR1 reduces the sensitivity of HERG to classic proarrhythmic HERG blockers (sotalol, quinidine, dofetilide) in both cardiac and noncardiac cell lines. We propose that KCR1, when coupled to HERG, may limit the sensitivity of HERG to proarrhythmic drug blockade and may be a rational target for modifying the proarrhythmic effects of otherwise clinically useful compounds."
https://openalex.org/W2161907482,"Nitrite occurs ubiquitously in biological fluids such as blood and sweat, representing an oxidation product of nitric oxide. Nitrite has been associated with a variety of adverse effects such as mutagenicity, carcinogenesis, and toxicity. In contrast, here we demonstrate that the presence of nitrite, but not nitrate, during irradiation of endothelial cells in culture exerts a potent and concentration-dependent protection against UVA-induced apoptotic cell death. Protection is half-maximal at a concentration of 3 mM, and complete rescue is observed at 10 mM. Nitrite-mediated protection is mediated via inhibition of lipid peroxidation in a similar manner as seen with butylated hydroxytoluene, a known inhibitor of lipid peroxidation. Interestingly, nitrite-mediated protection is completely abolished by coincubation with the NO scavenger cPTIO. Using electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy or Faraday modulation spectroscopy, we directly prove UVA-induced NO formation in solutions containing nitrite. In conclusion, evidence is presented that nitrite represents a protective agent against UVA-induced apoptosis due to photodecomposition of nitrite and subsequent formation of NO."
https://openalex.org/W2137923596,"Sorbitol dehydrogenase (SDH) is a polyol pathway enzyme that catalyzes conversion of sorbitol to fructose. Recent studies have demonstrated that activation of aldose reductase, the first enzyme of the polyol pathway, is a key response to ischemia and that inhibition of aldose reductase reduces myocardial ischemic injury. In our efforts to understand the role of pathway in affecting metabolism under normoxic and ischemic conditions, as well as in ischemic injury in myocardium, we investigated the importance of SDH by use of a specific inhibitor (SDI), CP-470,711. SDH inhibition increased glucose oxidation, whereas palmitate oxidation remained unaffected. Global ischemia increased myocardial SDH activity by approximately 1.5 fold. The tissue lactate/pyruvate ratio, a measure of cytosolic NADH/NAD+, was reduced by SDH inhibition under both normoxic and ischemic conditions. ATP was higher in SDI hearts during ischemia and reperfusion. Creatine kinase release during reperfusion, a marker of myocardial ischemic injury, was markedly attenuated in SDH-inhibited hearts. These data indicate that myocardial SDH activation is a component of ischemic response and that interventions that inhibit SDH protect ischemic myocardium. Furthermore, these data identify SDH as a novel target for adjunctive cardioprotective interventions."
https://openalex.org/W2089464868,"Among the many reported effects of irradiation in cells is activation of the stress-activated protein kinase, c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), which has been shown to result in apoptotic cell death. The trigger that leads to JNK activation has not been identified, although, in rat hippocampus at least, irradiation-induced apoptosis has been coupled with increased accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Significantly, irradiation-induced changes in hippocampus are abrogated by treatment of rats with the polyunsaturated fatty acid, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA). A close coupling between ROS accumulation and concentration of the pro-inflammatory cytokine, interleukin-1β (IL-1β) in hippocampus has been reported, and the evidence suggests that IL-1β may be responsible for the enhanced ROS production. Here we set out to assess the possibility that whole body γ-irradiation increases IL-1β concentration in hippocampus and to investigate the consequences of such a change. We present evidence that reveals that the irradiation-induced increase in IL-1β concentration in hippocampus is accompanied by increased expression of IL-1 type I receptor and IL-1 accessory protein and increased activation of IL-1 receptor-activated kinase. These changes, which were coupled with increased activation of JNK and evidence of apoptotic cell death, were absent in hippocampus of rats that received EPA treatment. Significantly, EPA treatment enhanced hippocampal IL-10 concentration that was inversely correlated with IL-1β concentration. The data are consistent with the idea that EPA exerts anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects in the central nervous system.

Greene C. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1998; 63: 650-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar)), although recent evidence has revealed actions of IL-1β that are independent of interaction with IL-1RI (2Touzani O. Boutin H. LeFeuvre R. Parker L. Miller A. Luheshi G. Rothwell N. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 38-43Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). IL-1RI activation by IL-1β initiates formation of a complex that requires recruitment of IL-1 accessory protein (IL-1AcP), an adaptor protein, MyD88, and a kinase, IL-1 receptor-associated kinase (IRAK (1O'Neill L.A. Greene C. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1998; 63: 650-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar)). Phosphorylation of IRAK is a pivotal step in activating the cascade of events that lead to the IL-1β-induced response; events in this cascade include activation of the stress-activated protein kinase, c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK). Increased IL-1β concentration in hippocampus is associated with impairment in synaptic function, and activation of JNK significantly contributes to this; for example, deficits in synaptic transmission, and consequently in long-term potentiation (LTP), have been coupled with increased IL-1β concentration and increased JNK activation in aged rats (3O'Donnell E.

Asada H. Surg. Neurol. 2000; 53 (discussion 506-507): 503-506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Although several changes have been observed following irradiation, the cell signaling events leading to irradiation-induced cell loss have not been explained. In a recent study, we have coupled irradiation-induced impairment in synaptic function with accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in hippocampus and with apoptotic changes (10Lonergan P.E. Martin D.S. Horrobin D.F. Lynch M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20804-20811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Significantly, treatment of rats with eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) prevented these changes. Others have reported that inflammatory changes occur in brain following irradiation and increases in IL-1β and tumor necrosis factor α mRNA expression have been described previously (18Chiang C.S. Hong J.H. Stalder A. Sun J.R. Withers H.R. McBride W.H. Int. J. Radiat. Biol. 1997; 72: 45-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Interestingly, a close correlation between inflammation, as assessed by IL-1β concentration, and accumulation of ROS has been identified in hippocampus. Specifically, IL-1β increases activity of superoxide dismutase (but not catalase and glutathione peroxidase) resulting in increased ROS accumulation (3O'Donnell E. Vereker E. Lynch M.A. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2000; 12: 345-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 19Vereker E. O'Donnell E. Lynch A. Kelly A ́. Nolan Y. Lynch M.A. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2001; 14: 1809-1819Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Here we have investigated the possibility that exposure of rats to whole body irradiation induces an increase in hippocampal IL-1β concentration and IL-1β-induced signaling. The data suggest that the irradiation-induced apoptotic changes in hippocampus are a consequence of increased IL-1β concentration and the subsequent up-regulation of JNK activation. We report that these changes are prevented by treatment with EPA, which increases hippocampal concentrations of the anti-inflammatory cytokine, IL-10.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESAnimals—Thirty-six adult (3 months) male Wistar rats were housed in groups of six in the BioResources Unit, Trinity College, Dublin and maintained under a 12-h light schedule (ambient temperature 22-23 °C) with veterinary supervision for the duration of the study. Rats were randomly assigned to one of six treatment groups. Food and water intake was measured daily for 2 weeks, and at the end of this period, 12 rats were fed on normal laboratory chow supplemented with ethyl eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA; 250 mg (1%), dissolved in corn oil; Laxdale, UK), 12 rats were fed on laboratory chow supplemented with 500 mg (2%) of EPA, and the remaining 12 rats received control diet (laboratory chow to which only corn oil was added). Sufficient diet was prepared for 2 or 3 days at a time, and rats were offered 100% of their average daily food intake so that the full daily allowance of EPA would be ingested; dietary supplementation continued for 4 weeks. Food and water intake, and weight gained did not vary between groups, and there was no significant difference in daily food and water intake before and after dietary modifications were made.At the end of this 4-week period, six rats from each treatment groups were exposed to whole body irradiation (10 Gy at a rate of 10 Gy/min; Nordion Gammacell cesium137 irradiator). The remaining rats were sham-irradiated. Rats were monitored for 4 days following irradiation and were then killed by cervical dislocation and decapitation. Hippocampal tissue was dissected free, sliced (350 × 350 μm) using a McIlwain tissue chopper, and stored at -80 °C in Krebs solution containing 10% dimethyl sulfoxide as previously described (3O'Donnell E. Vereker E. Lynch M.A. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2000; 12: 345-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) until required for analysis.The experimental conditions were chosen on the basis of findings from preliminary experiments in which irradiation dose and changes in hippocampal IL-1β concentration at 1, 2, and 4 days following irradiation were assessed. The data from these experiments indicated that 10 Gy at 10 Gy/min was not associated with weight loss or gastrointestinal disturbance, which occurred at higher doses. The data also indicated that the increase in hippocampal IL-1β concentration was maximal 4 days after irradiation.Analysis of Hippocampal Concentrations of IL-1β and IL-10—Hippocampal slices were thawed by agitation in a water bath at 37 °C for 1.5-2 min. Tissue was homogenized in Krebs solution containing 2 mm CaCl2, and samples were analyzed for concentrations of IL-1β and IL-10 by ELISA (R&D Systems) as previously described (4Lynch A.M. Lynch M.A. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2002; 15: 1779-1788Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Briefly, in the case of IL-1β, antibody-coated (100 μl; 1.0 μg/ml final concentration, diluted in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.3; goat anti-rat IL-1β antibody) 96-well plates were incubated overnight at room temperature, washed several times with PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20, blocked for 1 h at room temperature with 300 μl of blocking buffer (PBS, pH 7.3, containing 5% sucrose, 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA), and 0.05% NaN3), and washed. IL-1β standards (100 μl; 0-1000 pg/ml in PBS containing 1% BSA) or samples were added, and incubation proceeded for 2 h at room temperature. Secondary antibody (100 μl; biotinylated goat anti-rat IL-1β antibody; final concentration 350 ng/ml in PBS containing 1% BSA and 2% normal goat serum) was added, and the mixture was incubated for 2 h at room temperature. Wells were washed, detection agent (100 μl; horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin; 1:200 dilution in PBS containing 1% BSA) was added, and the mixture was incubated for 20 min at room temperature. Substrate solution (100 μl; 1:1 dilution of H2O2 and tetramethylbenzidine) was added, and the mixture was incubated at room temperature in the dark for 1 h after which time the reaction was stopped using 50 μl of 1 m H2SO4.A similar ELISA procedure was used for analysis of IL-10; in this case the coating antibody was mouse anti-rat IL-10 (100 μl; 4 μg/ml final concentration). IL-10 standards ranged from 0 to 4000 pg/ml (100 μl), and the secondary antibody was biotinylated goat anti-rat IL-10 (100 μl; final concentration, 100 ng/ml). Unfortunately, due to a technical difficulty, samples prepared from rats treated with 2% EPA could not be analyzed. For both cytokines, absorbance was read at 450 nm, values were corrected for protein and expressed as picograms of IL-1β or IL-10/mg of protein, and the detection limit was 5 pg/mg.In one set of in vitro experiments, IL-1β was measured from primary hippocampal neuronal cultures (see below for preparatory details). Hippocampal neurons were divided into two pretreatment groups: control (culture media) or IL-10 (100 ng/ml). 1 h later, half of each group was either sham- or γ-irradiated (20 Gy; n = 6 per group). Twenty-four hours later, the supernatant was harvested and the IL-1β concentration was measured by ELISA and expressed as picograms of IL-1β/ml of supernatant.Analysis of IL-1RAcP Expression, PARP Cleavage, IRAK, JNK, p38, and ERK Phosphorylation—In all cases hippocampal samples were homogenized in Krebs solution (containing 2 mm CaCl2), equalized for protein concentration (20Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (213177) Google Scholar), and diluted so that the same concentration of protein was loaded onto each lane (0.7 mg/ml). Aliquots (10 μl, 1 mg/ml) were added to sample buffer (5 μl; Tris-HCl, 0.5 mm, pH 6.8; glycerol, 10%; SDS, 10%; β-mercaptoethanol, 5%; bromphenol blue, 0.05% w/v), boiled for 5 min, and loaded onto gels (10% SDS for IL-1RAcP, PARP, IRAK, JNK, and ERK; 12% for p38). Proteins were separated by application of 30-mA constant current for 25-30 min, transferred onto nitrocellulose strips (225 mA for 75 min), blocked for 2 h at room temperature in 2% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in Tris-buffered saline (TBS), and immunoblotted overnight at 4 °C with the appropriate antibody diluted in 0.1% BSA in TBS-T (0.1% Tween 20).IL-1RAcP expression was determined by immunoblotting with a rabbit anti-rat IL-1RAcP antibody (1:500; QED Biosciences Inc., San Diego, CA). PARP cleavage was detected by incubating nitrocellulose strips with an antibody to both the cleaved and uncleaved forms of PARP (1:1000; BIOSOURCE). To estimate IRAK activity, proteins were immunoblotted with a rabbit polyclonal anti IRAK-1 antibody (1:500; Stressgen Biotechnologies Corp., Canada). To assess ERK, JNK, or p38 activity, proteins were immunoblotted with antibodies that specifically target either phosphorylated ERK (1:500; mouse monoclonal IgG, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), phosphorylated JNK (G-7, 1:300; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or phosphorylated p38 (1:1000; mouse monoclonal IgG, Cell Signaling Technology). These nitrocellulose blots were stripped and reprobed for ERK (1:500; mouse monoclonal IgG, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), JNK (F-3, 1:200, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and p38 (A-12, 1:100; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) to assess expression of total ERK, JNK, and p38.In all cases, nitrocellulose strips were washed in TBS-T and incubated for 2 h at room temperature with secondary antibody diluted in TBS-T containing 0.1% BSA (horseradish peroxidase-linked anti-rabbit antibody (Amersham Biosciences, UK) at 1:500, 1:1000, and 1:2000 dilution for IRAK, IL-1RAcP, and PARP, respectively). Nitrocellulose strips were incubated with a peroxidase-linked anti-mouse IgG (Sigma, UK) in the cases of anti-active p-ERK (1:1000), the unphosphorylated form of ERK (1:1000), anti-active p-JNK (1:300), the unphosphorylated form of JNK (1:400), phosphorylated p38 (1:2000), and p38 (1:800). Protein complexes were visualized with SuperSignal (Pierce), and nitrocellulose strips were exposed to film for 5 s to 5 min depending on the antibody and processed using a Fuji x-ray processor. Quantitation of protein bands was achieved by densitometric analysis using two software packages, Grab It (Grab It Annotating Grabber 2.04.7, Synotics, UVP Ltd.) and Gelworks (Gelworks ID, Version 2.51, UVP Ltd.) for photography and densitometry, respectively. Gelworks provides a single value (in arbitrary units) representing the density of each blot, and the values presented here are means of data generated from six separate experiments.Analysis of IL-1RI Expression and Cytochrome c Translocation—IL-1RI expression was assessed in the membrane fraction, whereas cytochrome c analysis was performed on the cytosolic fraction. Samples were prepared by homogenizing hippocampal slices in lysis buffer, followed by centrifugation (15,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C). The resulting pellet (membrane fraction) was resuspended in lysis buffer, equalized for protein, and added to half the volume of sample buffer (final concentration, 0.5 mg/ml). Similarly the supernatant (i.e. cytosolic fraction) was equalized, sample buffer added, and the final concentration was 300 μg/ml. Both preparations were boiled for 5 min, and 10 μl was loaded onto either 10% (IL-1RI) or 12% (cytochrome c) gels. Proteins were separated, transferred onto nitrocellulose strips, and immunoblotted.IL-1RI membrane expression was assessed by incubating the nitrocellulose strips in the primary antibody (1:600; rabbit anti-rat IL-1RI IgG, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) in 0.1% BSA in TBS-T, whereas cytochrome c translocation was determined by incubating the nitrocellulose strips in cytochrome c (1:1250 in PBS-T containing 2% nonfat dried milk, rabbit polyclonal IgG, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Immunoreactive bands were detected using peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody (1:1000; Sigma) and SuperSignal (Pierce) and quantified by densitometry as before.TUNEL Staining in Acutely Dissociated Cells—Hippocampal slices (350 μm) were washed in oxygenated Krebs solution, incubated in PBS containing collagenase (0.025%) for 30 min at room temperature, and washed in PBS to terminate collagenase digestion. Samples were triturated using a fire-polished glass pipette and passed through a nylon mesh filter to remove tissue clumps. Dissociated cells were resuspended in PBS, and 100-μl aliquots were cytospun (600 rpm for 2 min) onto glass microslides (Shandon Cytospin III). Cells were fixed in methanol and stored at room temperature for later use. Apoptotic cell death was assessed using the DeadEnd colorimetric apoptosis detection system (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Staining was developed by addition of the chromogen 3,3′-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride and H2O2 for 10 min. Apoptotic nuclei were stained dark brown, whereas negative cells were viewed by counter staining with 3% methyl green. Cells were dehydrated through alcohol to xylene and mounted, and 400 cells were counted per slide (∼80 cells/field; 5 fields/slide) at ×40 magnification. TUNEL-positive cells were expressed as a percentage of the total cell number; six slides were assessed per experimental group.Preparation of Primary Hippocampal Neuronal Cultures—Primary hippocampal neurons were established from 1-day postpartum Wistar rats and maintained in neurobasal medium (Invitrogen). Four experimental groups (n = 6/group) were assessed, which comprised sham-irradiated or γ-irradiated cells, with/without inhibitor (specific details below). Rats were decapitated, and the hippocampus was dissected free and incubated in sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, Sigma) containing trypsin (0.25%; Sigma) for 20 min at 37 °C. The tissue was triturated five times in PBS containing trypsin inhibitor (0.1%; Sigma) and DNase (0.2 mg/ml; Sigma) and gently filtered through a sterile mesh filter (40 μm). Following centrifugation (2000 × g for 3 min) at 20 °C, the pellet was resuspended in neurobasal medium supplemented with heat-inactivated horse serum (10%; Sigma), penicillin (100 units/ml; Invitrogen), and glutamax (2 mm; Invitrogen). Suspended cells were plated out at a density of 1 × 105 cells on circular 10-mm diameter coverslips, coated with poly-l-lysine (40 μg/ml; Sigma), and incubated in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2:95% O2 at 37 °C. After 48 h, cytosinearabinofuranoside (5 ng/ml; Sigma) was incubated in the culture medium to prevent proliferation of non-neuronal cells. Twenty-four hours later, preparations were randomly divided into one of four treatment groups: sham-irradiated or γ-irradiated hippocampal neurons incubated in the presence or absence of the caspase-1 inhibitor, Ac-YVAD-CMK. In the case of those to be treated with caspase-1 inhibitor, neurons were pretreated for 1 h with Ac-YVAD-CMK (100 nm; Calbiochem). Cells that were assigned to the irradiated group underwent γ-irradiation of 20 Gy at a rate of 10 Gy/min in a Nordion Gammacell cesium137 irradiator. The following day, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in TBS and stored at 4 °C in TBS until required for immunocytochemistry. In a separate set of experiments, neurons were preincubated with the specific JNK inhibitor DJNKI1 (1 μm; Alexis) for 1 h prior to γ-irradiation and processed as above.Immunocytochemistry and TUNEL Staining of Hippocampal Neurons—Sham- and γ-irradiated hippocampal neuronal cultures, which were pretreated with either Ac-YVAD-CMK (100 nm) or DJNKI1 (1 μm), were immunostained for either p-JNK or anti-active caspase-3. Cells were permeabilized in 0.1% Triton X-100 and 20 μg/ml proteinase K in TBS for 10 min and then washed in TBS. Non-reactive sites were blocked with TBS containing 10% normal goat serum (Vector, UK) and incubated for 2 h at room temperature. Cells were washed and incubated overnight at 4 °C in primary antibody; p-JNK (1:150; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or anti-active caspase-3 antibody (1:150; Promega) diluted in 2.5% normal goat serum in TBS. Endogenous peroxidases were blocked by immersion in 0.3% hydrogen peroxide for 10 min at room temperature, and cells were washed in TBS. Cells were incubated for 2 h at room temperature in secondary antibody; biotinylated anti-mouse IgG in the case of p-JNK (1:150; Vector Laboratories) and biotinylated anti-rabbit IgG (1:150; BIOSOURCE) for anti-active caspase-3. In all cases, cells were reacted with streptavidin-conjugated horseradish peroxidase (1:50 in TBS) for 30 min, and staining was developed by addition of the chromogen 3,3′-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride and H2O2 for 8 min. Cells were rinsed, counterstained with 3% methyl green, dehydrated, and mounted. Approximately 400 cells were counted per slide (30-50 cells/field; 8 fields/slide) at ×100 magnification, and six slides were analyzed per experimental condition. Positively immunostained cells were expressed as a percentage of the total number of cells counted.In the case of p-JNK immunostaining a further distinction was made within the JNK-positive group. In some cells, JNK immunostained in a punctate manner and was localized throughout the cell. A second population of JNK-positive cells was also evident. These appeared smaller in morphology and were more densely stained, which was consistent with apoptotic changes (condensed nuclei and shrunken cell body).Negative controls in which p-JNK and anti-active caspase-3 antibodies were heat-inactivated (i.e. boiling both antibodies for 10 min prior to primary antibody incubation) were conducted in parallel in each experiment. In addition, the primary antibody was omitted, and cells were incubated with TBS alone; this constituted another negative control.Hippocampal neurons were also assessed for DNA fragmentation by TUNEL labeling. The protocol was identical to that described above, for acutely dissociated cells.Statistical Analysis—Data are expressed as the mean ± S.E. A one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed to determine whether there were significant differences between conditions. When this analysis indicated significance (at the 0.05 level), post hoc Student Newman-Keuls test analysis was used to determine which conditions were significantly different from each other (Prism, GraphPad Software).RESULTSFig. 1A shows that IL-1β concentration was similar in hippocampal tissue prepared from the three groups of sham-irradiated rats. Exposure to irradiation significantly enhanced IL-1β concentration in rats that received control diet by over 50% (p < 0.05; ANOVA, compared with sham-irradiated rats that received control diet). A preliminary time-course study demonstrated that, when the concentration of IL-1β was assessed 1, 2, and 4 days after γ-irradiation, the levels increased significantly with time. 2A. M. Lynch, M. Moore, S. Craig, P. E. Lonergan, D. S. Martin, and M. A. Lynch, unpublished observation. Treatment with EPA prevented the irradiation-induced increase in IL-1β concentration. These findings were paralleled by changes in expression of membrane-associated IL-1RI (Fig. 1B). Thus receptor expression was similar in hippocampal tissue prepared from the three groups of sham-irradiated rats, and although exposure to irradiation significantly increased IL-1RI in hippocampus of rats that received control diet (p < 0.05; ANOVA), there was no significant change in irradiated rats that were treated with EPA. Consistent with the developing theme that irradiation up-regulated IL-1β-associated signaling is the finding that IL-1RAcP expression, which was similar in hippocampus of all sham-irradiated rats, was significantly enhanced in tissue prepared from irradiated rats that were maintained on the control diet (Fig. 1C; p < 0.001; ANOVA). Analysis of IRAK (80 and 100 kDa) revealed that irradiation enhanced the expression of the phosphorylated (100 kDa) form but did not alter expression of the unphosphorylated (80 kDa) form. Fig. 1D presents the data obtained from analysis of the ratio of 100- to 80-kDa IRAK. The data demonstrate that the mean ratio was enhanced in hippocampal tissue prepared from rats that were exposed to irradiation (although this did not reach statistical significance; p < 0.11) but that treatment with EPA attenuated this change.That increased IL-1β concentration is positively correlated with components of the IL-1β signaling pathway is illustrated in Fig. 2. A significant correlation exists between IL-1β concentration and IL-1RI expression (A; p < 0.04; r2 = 0.16), IL-1RAcP expression (B; p < 0.0001; r2 = 0.71) and IRAK activity (C; p < 0.01; r2 = 0.21). In addition, γ-irradiation enhanced the interaction between IL-1RI and IL-1RAcP, whereas the correlation between these measures was not statistically significant when data from sham-irradiated animals was assessed, there was a significant positive correlation in data obtained from irradiated rats (Fig. 2D; p < 0.001; r2 = 0.81).Fig. 2IL-1β con"

We herein show that sonic hedgehog signaling molecules are differentially regulated by dopamine depletion in the basal ganglia of adult animals and specifically that sonic hedgehog levels are reduced in an animal model of Parkinson's disease. In addition, we show that sonic hedgehog protein inhibits electrical activity in the subthalamic nucleus, a key element of basal ganglia, within minutes of application. As the subthalamic nucleus is overactive in parkinsonism, we suggest that enhancement of sonic hedgehog signaling in the subthalamic nucleus may be of therapeutic value in Parkinson's disease."

Despite the need for an increased workforce to carry out the expansion in biomedical research, there has not been an increase in new U.S. doctorates awarded, and time-to-degree in the biomedical sciences is no longer increasing. Furthermore, both the frequency and length of postdoctoral appointments are decreasing for U.S. biomedical science recipients. There has been, however, continued growth in the number of foreign postdoctorals. Industrial employment of biomedical scientists continues to increase, but there has been only modest growth in tenured or tenure-track academic jobs."
https://openalex.org/W2093234098,"We investigated the inter-relationship between two downstream effectors of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), the serine threonine kinase Akt (also known as protein kinase B) and the transcription factor ETS1, during tubulogenesis. Human endothelial cell culture and the in vivo Drosophila tracheal systems are employed in comparative analysis. We show that VEGF stimulates the expression of ETS1 through a phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt-dependent pathway in primary endothelial cells. Activation of Akt results in vessel formation in vitro, a process that is blocked by expression of antisense ETS1. The functional relationship between ETS and Akt was then tested in the homologous tubular system in Drosophila. Contrary to expectation, ETS1 and Akt did not form a linear positive regulatory pathway in vivo. Instead, genetic analyses suggest that the Drosophila ETS1 homologue Pointed is required for cell motility per se while Drosophila Akt (Dakt1) is responsible for organized and restricted cell movement that is essential for tubule formation. Taken together, our results show that ETS1 and Akt control different aspects of cell motility that are integrated in the precise regulation of vascular tubule formation."
https://openalex.org/W2136442016,"Nitric oxide (NO) is an antiviral effector of the innate immune system, but few of the viral targets of NO have been identified. We now show that NO inhibits adenovirus replication by targeting the adenovirus proteinase (AVP). NO generated from diethylamine NONOate (DEA-NONOate) or spermine NONOate (Sp-NONOate) inhibited the AVP. Inhibition was reversible with dithiothreitol. The equilibrium dissociation constant for reversible binding to the AVP by Sp-NONOate, or Ki, was 0.47 mM, and the first-order rate constant for irreversible inhibition of the AVP by Sp-NONOate, or ki, was 0.0036 s(-1). Two hallmarks of a successful adenovirus infection were abolished by the NO donors: the appearance of E1A protein and the cleavage of cytokeratin 18 by AVP. Treatment of infectious virus by DEA-NONOate dramatically decreased viral infectivity. These data suggest that NO may be a useful antiviral agent against viruses encoding a cysteine proteinase and in particular may be an antiadenovirus agent."
https://openalex.org/W2046282516,"Phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome ten (PTEN) is a dual-specificity phosphatase that has activity toward both phosphorylated peptides and phospholipids. PTEN inhibits activation of Akt, the downstream effector of PI 3-kinase, which is integral to cell proliferation, migration, survival, and angiogenesis essential for tissue injury healing. PTEN expression and activation during injury healing remain unexplored. Portal hypertensive (PHT) gastric mucosa has impaired injury healing, but the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. We investigated whether impaired healing of injured PHT gastric mucosa is due to abnormal PTEN expression/activation that leads to decreased Akt activation. We also investigated the possible involvement of Egr-1, which regulates PTEN in some cells (e.g., fetal kidney epithelial cells), and TNF-alpha, which can induce Egr-1 expression. In PHT gastric mucosa 6 h after injury, PTEN protein levels were increased by 2.7-fold; unphosphorylated PTEN (reflecting activated PTEN) was increased by 2.4-fold; Akt phosphorylation (reflecting Akt activation) was reduced by 2-fold; and Egr-1 expression was increased by 3.3-fold vs. normal gastric mucosa. TNF-alpha neutralization reversed all of the above abnormalities in PHT gastric mucosa, reduced mucosal injury, and enhanced healing. We conclude that, in injured PHT gastric mucosa, overexpressed/activated PTEN leads to the reduced activation of the PI 3-kinase/Akt pathway that results in impaired injury healing."

T cell tolerance to self-antigens is acquired during thymic education which eliminates high affinity auto-reactive clones and allows the maturation and emigration of selected clones to the periphery. There, they respond to foreign antigens with high affinity and self-antigens with low affinity below the activation threshold (1Kappler J.W. Roehm N. Marrack P.

However, the thymic selection process is normal in lpr mice (11Singer G.G. Abbas A.K. Immunity. 1994; 1: 365-371Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (703) Google Scholar), and it is generally accepted that the disease in lpr mice is caused by the lack of Fas/FasL-mediated regulation in the periphery. Whether Treg cells play a role and how the low affinity auto-reactive T cells are expanded are unclear. Mice whose Il2 gene has been eliminated by a targeted mutation (IL-2 KO or Il2–/–) develop mild lymphadenopathy, severe anemia, and ulcerative colitis (10Sadlack B. Merz H. Schorle H. Schimpl A. Feller A.C. Horak I. Cell. 1993; 75: 253-261Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1532) Google Scholar). The development of ulcerative colitis in IL-2 KO mice depends on T cells and the presence of intestinal flora (12Schultz M. Tonkonogy S.L. Sellon R.K. Veltkamp C. Godfrey V.L. Kwon J. Grenther W.B. Balish E. Horak I. Sartor R.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: G1416-G1472Google Scholar). Whether IL-2 KO mice have a defect in negative selection has not been resolved (13Kramer S. Mamalaki C. Horak I.

The expansion of organ-specific T cells due to the absence of Treg cells has been implicated as a major cause for ulcerative colitis (16Papiernik M. de Moraes M.L. Pontoux C. Vasseur F. Penit C. Int.

The molecular mechanism by which the intestinal flora-dependent T cells cause colon organ failure in IL-2 KO mice has not been established (16Papiernik M. de Moraes M.L. Pontoux C. Vasseur F.

Immunol. 2002; 169: 4850-4860Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). IL-2 KO mice have been shown to have a defect in FasL expression, an interpretation that would preclude a role of FasL in the pathology, end organ failure, and lethality observed in IL-2 KO mice (19Refaeli Y. Van Parijs L. London C.A. Tschopp J. Abbas A.K. Immunity. 1998; 8: 615-623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). Unlike lpr mice, IL-2 KO mice do not produce anti-dsDNA antibodies and rheumatoid factors and do not exhibit immune complex-mediated glomerulonephritis (10Sadlack B. Merz H. Schorle H. Schimpl A. Feller A.C. Horak I. Cell. 1993; 75: 253-261Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1532) Google Scholar). These differences suggest that the disease manifestations of lpr and IL-2 KO mice are the results of different mechanisms. We hypothesize that IL-2 has a dual role in the development of auto-reactive T cells. As a powerful lymphokine, IL-2 is both a positive regulator required for the expansion of the low affinity auto-reactive T cells and a negative regulator necessary for the development of Treg cells and the induction of FasL for AICD in highly activated T cells. On the other hand, IL-2 is not required for the expansion of T cells that respond to intestinal flora stimulation, and IL-2 is not necessary for the induction of FasL on these activated T cells. To test our hypothesis, we generated mutant mice defective in both fas and Il2 genes, i.e. Il2–/–lpr+/+ mice (we use lpr+/+ to refer to the lpr mutant genotype). Unlike Il2–/– mice, these mice do not die at a young age. Furthermore, they do not develop the lethal autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome characteristic of lpr mice. The data reported herein support our working hypothesis and implicate IL-2 and Fas as potential targets for immunotherapy against lupus and ulcerative colitis, respectively. Breeding and Genotyping—C57BL/6.Il2+/– mice and B6.lpr (lpr+/+) mice were obtained from The Jackson Laboratories, Bar Harbor, ME. Il2+/– mice (homozygous mice are sterile) were mated with lpr+/+ mice to obtain Il2+/–lpr+/– F1 offspring. We intercrossed them to obtain Il2–/–lpr+/+ and Il2+/–lpr+/+ mice. We then bred the Il2+/–lpr+/+ × Il2+/–lpr+/+ pair to increase the frequency of Il2–/–lpr+/+ offspring. Tail DNA was used for genotyping by PCR. The primers used for fas PCR analysis are as follows: fasF1 (Fas forward primer 1, 5′-GTAAATAATTGTGCTTCGTCAG-3′), fasR1 (Fas reverse primer 1, 5′-TAGAAAGGTGCACGGGTGTG-3′), fasR2 (Fas reverse primer 2, 5′-CAAATCTAGGCATTAACAGTG-3′). The primers used for PCR analysis of the Il2 gene are as follows: IL-2-P1 (IL-2 primer 1, 5′-TCGAATTCGCCAATGACAAGACGCT-3′), IL-2-P2 (IL-2 primer 2, 5′-CTAGGCCACAGAATTGAAAGATCT-3′), IL-2-P3 (IL-2 primer 3, 5′-GTAGGTGGAAATTCTAGCATCATCC-3′). Amplification was performed under standard conditions for 35 cycles with 94 °C for 1 min to melt the DNA, 65 °C for 1 min to anneal the DNA, and 72 °C for 1 min to extend the DNA. PCR products were as follows: 218 bp for fas mutant lpr (fasF1 and fasR2), 182 bp for the normal fas (fasF1 and fasR1), about 500 bp for the Il2 mutant (IL-2P1 and IL-2P3), and 324 bp for the normal Il2 (IL-2P2 and IL-2P3). DNA samples from B6, IL-2 KO, and B6.lpr mice were used as controls. General Examination of Mice—Mice were examined twice weekly and weighed once weekly. Blood samples were collected weekly once the mice were 4 weeks old. Ten μl of blood were collected and immediately diluted in 90 μl of cold PBS, pH 7.2. Aliquots were used to determine hemoglobin levels and white blood cell counts. Cell-free samples were collected by centrifugation and used for the determination of anti-dsDNA Ab and Ig levels. In some experiments mice were sacrificed, and various tissues were collected for analyses as described in specific experiments (see Figs. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7) in the text.Fig. 3Colitis of Il2–/– mice is prevented in Il2–/–lpr+/+ mice. H/E staining of colon sections from mice with various genotypes was carried out as described under “Experimental Procedures.” H/E stained sections of colons from Wt and lpr mice showed normal mucosal glands with mucin containing goblet cells (brown arrows). Sample from an Il2–/– mouse showed destruction of epithelial architecture (green arrow), and loss of goblet cells along with severe lymphocytic infiltration (red arrows) in the lamina propria.

Serum of a 6-month-old female lpr mouse was used as a positive control. Bound anti-dsDNA Abs were measured with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse IgG using a 2,2′-azinobis(3-ethylbenz-thiazolone-6-sulfonic acid) substrate (Sigma). The results were expressed as absorbance at 405 nm. Determination of Hemoglobin Level—Blood samples were diluted with a 100-fold excess of dilution buffer (3 mm K3Fe(CN)6, 1.5 mm KCN, 5 mm Na2BO4, 0.1% Nonidet P-40). Released hemoglobin was converted to cyanomethemoglobin, and the relative hemoglobin concentrations were determined photometrically at 546 nm (20Kuhn R. Lohler J. Rennick D. Rajewsky K. Muller W. Cell. 1993; 75: 263-274Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3596) Google Scholar). Immunohistochemical and Immunofluorescence Staining—Mice of various groups were euthanized. Immune complex deposition on fixed kidney sections was determined using alkaline phosphatase-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse IgG antibodies. Frozen sections of kidneys were used for immunofluorescence staining. Immune complex deposits were determined using FITC-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse IgM (BD Biosciences). Sections of paraffin-embedded colon were stained with hematoxylin and eosin. FasL staining was carried out according to the manufacturer's protocol using rabbit anti-mouse FasL Ab (N20, Santa Cruz Biotechnology., Santa Cruz, CA) followed by biotinylated-goat anti-rabbit Ig and horseradish peroxidase-avidin. The horseradish peroxidase-stained slides were counterstained with hematoxylin. Apoptosis was determined using a terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase (TdT)-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay kit (Apoptag Plus Peroxidase in situ apoptosis detection kit, Intergen, Purchase, New York). We followed the manufacturer's protocol and included the positive control provided by the manufacturer. Colonsections were freed from paraffin and dehydrated in graded alcohol. Endogenous peroxidase activity was quenched in 3% hydrogen peroxide in PBS for 5 min. After rinsing, slides were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h with TdT in reaction buffer in a humidity chamber. Background staining was determined by incubation with buffer in the absence of TdT. Enzymatic reactions were stopped with a stop/wash buffer, and the slides were washed with PBS. Sections were then incubated with an anti-digoxigenin-peroxidase conjugate for 30 min. After washing with PBS, sections were incubated with a 0.05% 3,3-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride to develop the TUNEL+ cells. Slides were counter-stained with hematoxylin. TUNEL+ cells developed a characteristic brown/black color in the nuclear region. For confocal microscopy CD4+FasL+ cells were stained with rat anti-mouse CD4 mAb followed by Alexa 488-conjugated goat anti-rat Ab and rabbit anti-FasL followed by Alexa 546-conjugated goat anti-rabbit Ab (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). For a negative control we used rat IgG and rabbit IgG in place of anti-CD4 mAb and anti-FasL Ab, respectively. The slides were examined using a Carl Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss Inc., Thornwood, NY). Data presented are representative of two or more experiments. Flow Cytometric Analysis—Cells (106) were suspended in 100 μl of PBS containing 4% bovine serum albumin and incubated with 1 μg of various fluorescent antibodies (BD Biosciences) for 45 min at 4 °C. At least 1 × 104 stained cells were analyzed using a FACScan (BD Biosciences) equipped with Cellquest software. To stain antibody-coated red blood cells (RBC), a mixture of FITC-conjugated anti-IgG and anti-IgM was used. To stain the abnormal DN T cells, a single-cell suspension depleted of RBC was prepared from lymph nodes and double-stained with FITC-anti-Thy1.2 and PE-anti-B220 mAbs. To stain for CD4+CD25+ Treg cells, lymph node cells were double-stained with FITC-anti-CD4 and PE-anti-CD25 mAbs. To stain for cytokine-producing T cells, single cell suspensions prepared from spleens were depleted of RBC and then activated (107 cells in 4 ml) with 20 ng/ml phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and 1 μm ionomycin for 6 h in the presence of 2 μm monensin (Sigma). Activated cells were first stained with PE-anti-CD4 mAb at 4 °C. After washing, labeled cells were fixed for 30 min in PBS containing 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.1% saponin, and then stained with FITC-conjugated anti-IL-2, anti-IL-10, or isotype control mAb (Southern Biotechnology, Birmingham, AL). Mutual Protection from Lethality—We have generated 39 Il2–/–lpr+/+ mice, 75 Il2–/– mice, 80 lpr+/+ mice, and 120 B6 mice by breeding B6.Il2+/– mice and B6.lpr mice (all mice are in the B6 background). Fig. 1 shows a representative genotyping result from various progeny of (Il2+/–lpr+/– × Il2+/–lpr+/–)F1 and (Il2+/–lpr+/+ × Il2+/–lpr+/+)F1 breeding. The life spans of these mice were determined and compiled (Fig. 2a). Less than 50% of the Il2–/– mice were alive at 12 weeks of age, and none of them survived beyond 8 months. In sharp contrast, none of the Il2–/–lpr+/+ mice died before 8 months. The data demonstrate that Il2–/–-imposed lethality is critically dependent on host Fas expression. On the other hand, the Il2–/– gene also prolongs the life span of lpr+/+ mice. Those lpr+/+ mice bearing either an Il2+/– or Il2+/+ genotype began to die about 6 months after birth, whereas no death was observed for Il2–/–lpr+/+ mice. At 1 year after birth, ∼35% of lpr+/+ mice (mostly female) died, whereas more than 90% of the Il2–/–lpr+/+ mice remained alive. Restoration of Body Weight by lpr+/+Gene—A major clinical manifestation of Il2–/– mice is the lack of weight gain during growth (Fig. 2b). There were no major differences in weight until 5–6 weeks postnatal. Although a sharp increase in body weight was observed in B6 mice, there was a decline of body weight in the Il2–/–mice. By contrast, there was a significant gain in body weight by the Il2–/–lpr+/+ mice. The body weight gain was noticeably lower than that observed in B6 and lpr+/+ mice, suggesting that lpr+/+-dependent protection, although considerable, remained incomplete. Prevention of Anemia in Il2–/–Mice by the lpr+/+Gene— Anemia and ulcerative colitis have been implicated as causes for the lack of weight gain and the high mortality of IL-2 KO mice (10Sadlack B. Merz H. Schorle H. Schimpl A. Feller A.C. Horak I. Cell. 1993; 75: 253-261Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1532) Google Scholar). If so, an association between these phenotypes should be observed. This is indeed the case. Severe anemia developed early in life with great variability in Il2–/– mice. In contrast, severe anemia failed to occur in the Il2–/–lpr+/+ mice, although mild anemia was occasionally detected in a few individuals (Fig. 2c). The reasons for the severe anemia observed in Il2–/– mice have not been resolved. Certain Il2–/– strains, especially Balb/c.Il2–/– mice, develop a potent immune response to RBC (21Sadlack B. Lohler J. Schorle H. Klebb G. Haber H. Sickel E. Noelle R.J. Horak I. Eur. J. Immunol. 1995; 25: 3053-3059Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). The autoimmune anti-RBC response, ulcerative colitis, and RBC differentiation defect are potential causes for the severe anemic condition. We tested RBC for coated antibodies and sera for the ability to coat RBC but could not detect an anti-RBC response in Il2–/–lpr+/+ or Il2–/– mice. We could, however, detect antibodies on the RBC of old NZB male mice that were used as a positive control (Fig. 2d). Protection from Colon Damage by lpr+/+Gene—If lpr+/+ gene prolongs the life span of Il2–/– mice, then one must conclude that FasL-mediated cytotoxicity functions in vivo in the absence of IL-2 and is responsible for the susceptibility of Il2–/– mice to lethal ulcerative colitis. Both Il2–/– and the Il2–/–lpr+/+ mice developed colitis according to histological criteria, which include inflammation and infiltration of leukocytes in the lamina propria (Fig. 3). The 4-month old Il2–/– mouse showed a severe destruction of colon architecture with atrophic epithelial cells, dilated mucous glands, and a marked reduction of mucin-secreting cells. By contrast, in the colon of the 4-month old Il2–/–lpr+/+ mouse, the glandular structure was preserved with apparently normal goblet cells and epithelial linings, albeit with some reduction in mucin-secreting cells. The mild inflammation was associated with mucosal hypertrophy. A clear dissociation of inflammation from end organ failure is suggested from studies of a 12-month-old Il2–/–lpr+/+ mouse. Although the colon was more heavily inflamed and the mucosal layer more thickened, the general architecture was maintained, and the intestinal epithelial cells remained intact. These results suggest that the Fas-mediated apoptotic pathway plays a critical role in the death of colon epithelial cells, leading to the destruction of colon structure, end organ failure, and lethality of Il2–/– mice. FasL Expression in the Inflamed Colon of Il2–/–and Il2–/–lpr+/+Mice—To provide direct evidence that the inflamed colon expresses FasL, colon sections were stained for FasL (Fig. 4a). Infiltrating leukocytes of Il2–/–lpr+/+ mice were strongly stained with affinity-purified rabbit anti-FasL Ab. Weak staining of epithelial cells was also observed. The staining is specific because sections from B6 and lpr+/+ controls displayed essentially undetectable staining. Moreover, normal rabbit IgG failed to stain colon sections of Il2–/–lpr+/+ mice. Similar results were observed with Il2–/– mouse colon samples, although the extent of staining was weaker than that observed in Il2–/–lpr+/+ mice. As reported in other colitis models (22Simpson S.J. Mizoguchi E. Allen D. Bhan A.K. Terhorst C. Eur. J. Immunol. 1995; 25: 2618-2625Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 23Strater J. Wellisch I. Riedl S. Walczak H. Koretz K. Tandara A. Krammer P.H. Moller P. Gastroenterology. 1997; 113: 160-167Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar), the FasL-expressing leukocytes contain CD4+ T cells, as determined by double staining using fluorescent Abs and confocal microscopy (Fig. 4b). The results provide evidence that Il2–/– mice are capable of producing FasL at least in the inflamed areas of colon. Protection of Colon Epithelial Cell Apoptosis by lpr+/+Gene—We used a TUNEL assay to determine the apoptosis of colon epithelial cells in Il2–/– mice and the protection of colon epithelial cell apoptosis in Il2–/–lpr+/+ mice (Fig. 5). TUNEL+ epithelial cells were evident and frequent in the Il2–/– samples. By contrast, TUNEL+ epithelial cells were not observed in the Il2–/–lpr+/+ colon, indicating that Fas-mediated apoptosis is responsible for the colon epithelial cell death. TUNEL+ leukocytes were observed not only in Il2–/– mice but also in Il2–/–lpr+/+ mice. The latter observation demonstrates the Fas-independent apoptosis of infiltrating leukocytes. The staining is DNA nick-specific because TUNEL+ cells could not be detected in control mice or in Il2–/– mice in the absence of TdT. A role of FasL in intestinal epithelial cell apoptosis has been implicated in intestinal graft versus host disease (24Lin T. Brunner T. Tietz B. Madsen J. Bonfoco E. Reaves M. Huflejt M. Green D.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 570-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Our data provide strong evidence that FasL expressed on the infiltrating leukocytes is the key effector molecule responsible for colon damage, end organ failure, and lethality in Il2–/– mice. Significantly, the protection occurs concurrently with severe inflammation, emphasizing that Fas-mediated apoptosis is the critical component for lethality and a good target candidate for therapy. Protection from lpr+/+-imposed Lymphadenopathy by Il2–/–Gene—Interestingly, Il2–/– also protected lpr+/+-imposed lethality and this coincided with an inhibition of the autoimmune syndrome associated with lpr+/+ mice. There was a remarkable difference in the size of lymph nodes between old lpr+/+ and old Il2–/–lpr+/+ mice. Without exception, Il2–/–lpr+/+ mice failed to develop lymphadenopathy. Fluorescent Ab staining of the lymph node lymphocytes revealed that the former, but not the latter, is dominated by the presence of the abnormal DN T cells (CD4–CD8–Thy1+TCR+B220+). This indicates that the development of abnormal DN T cells characteristically associated with lpr+/+ mice was inhibited in the absence of IL-2, i.e. the development of the abnormal DN T cells is critically dependent on normal Il2 gene expression (Fig. 6a). The abnormal DN T cells are derived from “mis-selected” CD8+ T cells that are normally expanded in the periphery by self-antigens and then quickly eliminated by AICD (25Pestano G.A. Zhou Y. Trimble L.A. Daley J. Weber G.F. Cantor H. Science. 1999; 284: 1187-1191Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Because AICD of auto-reactive T cells is necessary to maintain peripheral tolerance, our observat"

However, in the present study, we show that an extracellular gate at the selectivity filter is critical for agonist activation of the Kir3.1/Kir3.4 channel. Increasing the flexibility of the selectivity filter, by disrupting a salt bridge that lies directly behind the filter, abolished both selectivity for K+ and agonist activation of the channel. Other mutations within the filter that altered selectivity also altered agonist activation. In contrast, mutations within the filter that did not affect selectivity had little if any effect on agonist activation. Interestingly, mutation of bulky side chain phenylalanine residues at the bundle crossing also altered both agonist activation and selectivity. These results demonstrate a significant correlation between agonist activation and selectivity, which is determined by the selectivity filter, and suggests, therefore, that the selectivity filter may act as the agonist-activated gate in the Kir3.1/Kir3.4 channel.

K+ channels open and close in response to a number of stimuli including voltage or intracellular ligands such as G proteins.

However, other parts of the channels may be associated with channel opening, because although access of large MTS reagents (such as MTSET; radius ∼2.9 Å) to the inner vestibule of a Ca2+-activated K+ channel (SK) is state-dependent, smaller MTS reagents (such as MTSEA; radius ∼1.8 Å, compared with K+ radius of 1.33 Å) can access as far as the selectivity filter equally well in open and closed channel states (11.Bruening-Wright A. Schumacher M.A. Adelman J.P. Maylie J. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 6499-6506Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, access of large MTS reagents to a cyclic nucleotide-gated channel (CNG1) is gated, while Ag+ (radius 1.27 Å) has state-independent access (12.Flynn G.E. Zagotta W.N. Neuron. 2001; 30: 689-698Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). This suggests that, in some channels at least, the bundle crossing may not be sufficient to impede the passage of permeant ions through the pore. On channel activation, other than the large movements of the TM2 domains that are described above, small movements at the inner portion of the selectivity filter of the KcsA channel have been observed in spin labeling experiments (1.Perozo E. Cortes D.M. Cuello L.G. Science. 1999; 285: 73-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). It is therefore possible that this region of the channel may also act as a gate. Other observations are consistent with this. For example, C-type inactivation, which occurs in many voltage-gated K+ channels, closes the channel by constriction of the outer mouth of the selectivity filter (13.Lopez-Barneo J. Hoshi T. Heinemann S.H. Aldrich R.W. Recept. Channels. 1993; 1: 61-71PubMed Google Scholar, 14.Yellen G. Sodickson D. Chen T.Y. Jurman M.E. Biophys.

Channels. 1998; 5: 273-289PubMed Google Scholar, 17.Lu T. Ting A.Y. Mainland J. Jan L.Y. Schultz P.G. Yang J. Nat.

Furthermore, a naturally occurring mutation within the selectivity filter of the G protein-activated Kir3.2 channel (Weaver mutation) alters channel sensitivity to agonist and G protein activation (20.Kofuji P. Hofer M. Millen K.J. Millonig J.H. Davidson N. Lester H.A. Hatten M.E. Neuron. 1996; 16: 941-952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 21.Slesinger P.A. Patil N. Liao Y.J. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Cox D.R. Neuron. 1996; 16: 321-331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). In this study, we show that mutations that alter the structure of the selectivity filter affect the response of the G protein-activated Kir3.1/Kir3.4 channel to agonist. While some mutations within the selectivity filter had minimal effects, disruption of a salt bridge that maintains tension in the selectivity filter abolished agonist activation. We describe a correlation between selectivity, which is determined by the selectivity filter, and agonist activation that suggests that agonist activation of the Kir3.1/Kir3.4 channel may occur at the selectivity filter. We also address the role of a putative intracellular gate in inward rectifier K+ channels (as suggested by the KirBac1.1 crystal structure, Ref. 22.Kuo A. Gulbis J.M. Antcliff J.F. Rahman T. Lowe E.D. Zimmer J. Cuthbertson J. Ashcroft F.M. Ezaki T. Doyle D.A. Science. 2003; PubMed Google Scholar), formed by a ring of bulky hydrophobic residues. We show that these residues also contribute to agonist activation of the channel in a way that may be coupled to the gate at the selectivity filter. Molecular Biology—Mutations in the Kir3.1 or Kir3.4 channel subunits were made using site-directed PCR mutagenesis and confirmed by sequencing. Plasmids (pTLNII or pGES) containing wild-type or mutant Kir3.1 or Kir3.4 channel subunits or the hD2 (human dopamine) or M2 (muscarinic acetylcholine (ACh)) receptor (required for agonist activation of the channel) were linearized using MluI or NotI (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) and transcribed in vitro using SP6 or T7 RNA polymerase (Riboprobe®; Promega, Madison, WI). Electrophysiology—Xenopus oocytes were prepared as described previously (23.Lancaster M.K. Dibb K.M. Quinn C.C. Leach R. Lee J.K. Findlay J.B. Boyett M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35831-35839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Oocytes were injected with 50 nl of cRNA encoding wild-type or mutant Kir3.1 (30 ng/μl) and Kir3.4 (30 ng/μl) as well as hD2 (3.8 ng/μl). In a few experiments, M2 (3.8 ng/μl) was injected instead of hD2; there was no difference in the behavior of the wild-type Kir3.1/Kir3.4 channel with the hD2 and M2 receptors (and relevant agonist). In the case of the mutations, Kir3.4[E145Q], Kir3.4[R155E], Kir3.4[E145R,R155E], Kir3.4[T148A], Kir3.1[F181A], and Kir3.4[F187A], cRNA was injected at 10 times the concentration to obtain adequate currents. Oocytes were incubated for 36–96 h at 19 °C in Barth's medium (in mm): 88 NaCl, 1 KCl, 2.4 NaHCO3, 0.82 MgSO4, 0.33 Ca(NO3)2, 0.41 CaCl2, 20 HEPES, 1.25 sodium pyruvate, 0.1 mg/ml neomycin (Sigma, Poole, UK), 100 units/0.1 mg/ml penicillin/streptomycin mix (Sigma), pH 7.4 (NaOH). Currents were recorded using the two-electrode voltage clamp technique using a GeneClamp 500B amplifier (Axon Instruments, Union City, CA) filtering at 500 Hz and sampling at 2 kHz. Voltage protocols were generated using pClamp software (Axon Instruments) with a Digidata 1200 D/A converter (Axon Instruments). Electrodes were filled with 3 m KCl (tip resistance, 1–3 MΩ). Experiments were performed at 20–25 °C. Recordings were made in solution consisting of (mm): 90 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 5 HEPES, pH 7.4 (KOH). Oocytes were placed in a small bath (∼5 × 5 × 4 mm; ∼100 μl in volume) and were directly perfused at ∼5 ml/min with a large bore manifold (∼1 mm in diameter) placed ∼1 mm from the cell. To record current-voltage relationships, currents were recorded firstly in the absence of the agonist dopamine and then following 30 s perfusion of solution containing 10 μm dopamine (along with 10 μm ascorbic acid to prevent dopamine oxidation). Oocytes were held at 0 mV and 750 ms voltage pulses were applied from -130 to + 60 mV in 10 mV increments. Currents were measured at the end of each voltage pulse. To study Rb+ permeation, the 90 mm KCl in the solution was replaced with 90 mm RbCl (pH titrated using RbOH). To measure the rate of channel activation on application of agonist and the effect of Gαi3, solution without agonist was rapidly exchanged for solution containing 10 μm dopamine (to measure channel activation) or 10 μm ACh (to measure the effect of Gαi3) and current was recorded continuously at -80 mV. To test the ability of our perfusion system to rapidly change the solution around each oocyte, we measured the rate of current activation in the constitutively active Kir3.1[S170P]/Kir3.4[S176P] mutant channel on switching from ND96 to solution containing 90 mm K+. Current activated in 0.7 ± 0.1 s (n = 5) and this is >10x faster than current activation on application of dopamine. In all experiments with mutant channels, data were also collected from the wild-type channel expressed in the same batch of oocytes. Data analysis was performed using Clampfit (Axon Instruments) and SigmaPlot (SPSS Science, Chicago, IL) software. Data are given as means ± S.E. (n = number of oocytes). Statistical analysis was performed using a Student's t test or ANOVA as appropriate. p values of <0.05 were considered to signify a significant difference. Modeling—A comparative model of the Kir3.1/Kir3.4 tetrameric channel was constructed based on the crystal structure of KcsA as described previously (24.Claydon T.W. Rose T. Nichols C.G. Boyett M.R. Biophys. J. 2003; 84: 80aGoogle Scholar, 25.Dibb K.M. Makary S.Y. Leach R. Rose T. Nichols C.G. Boyett M.R. Biophys. J. 2003; 84: 80aGoogle Scholar). Effect of Mutation of the Bulky Hydrophobic Residues at the Bundle Crossing—The comparative model of the Kir3.1/Kir3.4 channel (Fig. 1) shows a narrowing of the permeation pathway at the bundle crossing formed by the large side chains of the phenylalanine residues at position 181 in Kir3.1 and 187 in Kir3.4 (Fig. 1, A and C). The recently crystallized KirBac1.1 bacterial inward rectifier K+ channel also possesses phenylalanine residues at the equivalent position (F146 (22.Kuo A. Gulbis J.M. Antcliff J.F. Rahman T. Lowe E.D. Zimmer J. Cuthbertson J. Ashcroft F.M. Ezaki T. Doyle D.A. Science. 2003; PubMed Google Scholar)). Because their large hydrophobic side chains are ideally positioned to prevent movement of water through the narrow bundle crossing, the four phenylalanine residues in KirBac1.1 were proposed to be involved in channel activation (22.Kuo A. Gulbis J.M. Antcliff J.F. Rahman T. Lowe E.D. Zimmer J. Cuthbertson J. Ashcroft F.M. Ezaki T. Doyle D.A. Science. 2003; PubMed Google Scholar). We have investigated the role of these phenylalanine residues in agonist activation of the Kir3.1/Kir3.4 channel. Fig. 2 shows the effect of replacement of the phenylalanine residues with either methionine residues, the equivalent residue in the constitutively active Kir2.1 channel, or alanine residues, which have relatively small hydrophobic side chains. The left hand panel shows currents through the wild-type channel recorded in the presence of 90 mm K+ during 750 ms voltage pulses to -130 to +60 mV from a holding potential of 0 mV. The top set of traces was recorded in the absence of agonist, the middle set was recorded in the presence of agonist (10 μm dopamine) and the bottom set shows the agonist-activated current, the difference in current with and without agonist. Mean current-voltage relationships are also shown. In the absence of agonist, current was recorded through the wild-type channel (Fig. 2). Basal current is thought to be due to a high level of free Gβγ and/or a low level of Gαi within the Xenopus oocyte (26.Peleg S. Varon D. Ivanina T. Dessauer C.W. Dascal N. Neuron. 2002; 33: 87-99Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, wild-type current was substantially increased, by 60.7 ± 6.4%, on application of agonist (Fig. 2). Replacement of both pairs of phenylalanine residues with methionine residues (Kir3.1[F181M]/Kir3.4[F187M]) had no effect on the agonist dependence of the channel. This can be seen in Fig. 2, which shows current traces and mean current-voltage relationships for the mutant channel, and also in Fig. 3A (bar 4), which shows the agonist-activated current (at -130 mV) of various mutant channels normalized to that of the wild-type channel recorded from the same batch of oocytes. Although mutation to a methionine residue in all four subunits had no effect, mutation in either Kir3.1 or Kir3.4 alone did have a modest effect on agonist dependence (Fig. 3A, bars 2 and 3). The mutation, Kir3.1[F181M], reduced agonist activation by 30.9 ± 2.3% (n = 15; ANOVA, p < 0.05) compared with that of the wild-type channel, while the mutation, Kir3.4[F187M], increased agonist activation by 42.1 ± 3.9% (n = 5; ANOVA, p < 0.05) compared with that of the wild-type channel (Fig. 3A, bars 2 and 3). The effect of replacement of the phenylalanine residues with small alanine residues (Kir3.1[F181A]/Kir3.4[F187A]) was much greater (Figs. 2 and 3A, bar 5). The double mutation, Kir3.1[F181A]/Kir3.4[F187A], abolished agonist activation; the agonist-activated current was reduced by 114 ± 4% (n = 6; ANOVA, p < 0.05) compared with that of the wild-type channel. In proline-scanning experiments of the TM2 domain (7.Jin T. Peng L. Mirshahi T. Rohacs T. Chan K.W. Sanchez R. Logothetis D.E. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 469-481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), introduction of proline residues affected agonist activation with an α-helical periodicity (residues highlighted in blue in Fig. 1D). The double mutation, Kir3.1[S170P]/Kir3.4[S176P], had the greatest effect on agonist activation and produced this by introducing a kink into the helix of the TM2 domains (7.Jin T. Peng L. Mirshahi T. Rohacs T. Chan K.W. Sanchez R. Logothetis D.E. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 469-481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). In the present study, the double mutation, Kir3.1[S170P]/Kir3.4[S176P], reduced agonist activation by 80.5 ± 4.9% (Fig. 2; n = 5, ANOVA, p < 0.05) compared with that of the wild-type channel (Fig 3A, bar 6). As a control, we investigated the effect of the mutation of an aspartate residue within the TM2 domain (D173 in Kir3.1; equivalent to D172 in Kir2.1) that is thought to be involved with polyamine block of inward rectifier K+ channels. The mutation, Kir3.1[D173Q], had no effect on agonist activation; agonist-activated current through the Kir3.1[D173Q]/Kir3.4 mutant channel was 93.1 ± 1.0% that of the wild-type channel (n = 2; ANOVA, not significant). Mutations that Disrupt the Selectivity Filter Abolish Agonist Activation—Fig. 1B shows an enlarged view of the part of the P-loop that forms the selectivity filter of the Kir3.1/Kir3.4 channel. As in the Kir2.1 channel (27.Yang J. Yu M. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1568-1572Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), a salt bridge is thought to exist behind the selectivity filter between the negatively charged glutamate residue at position 139 (Glu-139) and the positively charged arginine residue at position 149 (Arg-149) in the Kir3.1 subunit and between Glu-145 and Arg-155 in the Kir3.4 subunit (see also the alignment in Fig. 1D). Fig. 4 shows the effect of agonist application on mutant Kir3.1/Kir3.4 channels in which the salt bridge behind the selectivity filter had been broken by neutralizing or reversing the charges at Glu-139/Glu-145 (in Kir3.1 and Kir3.4, respectively) and/or Arg-155 (in Kir3.4). Currents were recorded under the same conditions as described in Fig. 2. Disruption of the salt bridge in the Kir3.4 subunit (but not the Kir3.1 subunit, see below), by the Kir3.4[E145Q], Kir3.4[R155E] and Kir3.4[E145R,R155E] mutations, had dramatic effects on agonist activation. Current through these mutant channels was not activated by agonist, and the channels were constitutively active (Fig. 4). Again, this can also be seen in Fig. 3A (bars 8–10). The agonist-activated current was reduced by 89.5 ± 1.9, 109.4 ± 11.2 and 120.4 ± 1.3% in the Kir3.1/Kir3.4[E145Q], Kir3.1/Kir3.4[R155E] and Kir3.1/Kir3.4[E145R,R155E] mutant channels, respectively (n = 5–6; ANOVA, p < 0.05) when compared with that of the wild-type channel. Interestingly, only breaking the salt bridge in the Kir3.4 subunit made the channel constitutively active. Breaking the salt bridge in Kir3.1, by the mutation Kir3.1[E139Q], did not affect agonist activation (Fig. 3A, bar 7). To investigate the effect of disrupting the salt bridge on channel activation further, we measured the sensitivity of the wild-type channel and the Kir3.1/Kir3.4[E145Q] mutant channel (taken as an example of a mutant channel that lacks agonist activation) to Gβγ activation. Fig. 5A shows current through the wild-type channel and the Kir3.1/Kir3.4[E145Q] mutant channel recorded with and without injection of 3 ng/oocyte of Gβγ. Injection of 3 ng/oocyte of Gβγ activated the wild-type channel, but had no effect on the Kir3.1/Kir3.4[E145Q] mutant channel. Panels B and C of Fig. 5 show mean current-voltage relationships and dose-response curves for a range of Gβγ concentrations. At each concentration tested, Gβγ activated the wild-type channel, but failed to activate the Kir3.1/Kir3.4[E145Q] mutant channel (Fig. 5, B and C). These data show that the Kir3.1/Kir3.4[E145Q] mutant channel, in which the salt bridge has been broken, is insensitive to Gβγ activation as well as to agonist activation. Thus far, we have described mutant channels that do not respond to agonist, such as Kir3.1/Kir3.4[E145Q], as being constitutively active. However, it is possible that these channels are instead highly sensitive to Gβγ. Mutant channels may be maximally activated by endogenous Gβγ and so do not respond to agonist. To distinguish between these two possibilities, we co-expressed Gαi3, which sequesters endogenous Gβγ and abolishes basal current through the wild-type channel (26.Peleg S. Varon D. Ivanina T. Dessauer C.W. Dascal N. Neuron. 2002; 33: 87-99Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Fig. 6A shows continuous current recordings at -80 mV from oocytes injected with wild-type or Kir3.1/Kir3.4[E145Q] mutant channels in the absence or presence of 3 ng/oocyte of Gαi3. These experiments were performed with the M2 muscarinic ACh receptor. In the absence of Gαi3, substantial basal current was recorded through the wild-type channel and on application of agonist (10 μm ACh), current was increased (Fig. 6A, left as observed previously e.g.Fig. 2). Co-expression of Gαi3 abolished basal current, but not the agonist-activated current, through the wild-type channel (Fig. 6A, left). In contrast, basal current through the Kir3.1/Kir3.4[E145Q] mutant channel was not affected by Gαi3 (Fig. 6A, right). Furthermore, in the absence and presence of Gαi3, agonist application still failed to activate the channel (Fig. 6A, right). These results are confirmed by the mean data in Fig. 6B, which shows mean current amplitudes in the absence and presence of ACh for the wild-type and mutant channels with and without Gαi3. These data suggest that the Kir3.1/Kir3.4[E145Q] mutant channel is indeed constitutively active and not highly sensitive to Gβγ. Also highlighted in Fig. 1B are the alanine residue at position 142 in Kir3.1 and the threonine residue that is in the equivalent position in Kir3.4 (Thr-148). In Kir2.1, this site has been shown to be important in high affinity block of the channel by Cs+, Rb+, and Ba2+ (28.Thompson G.A. Leyland M.L. Ashmole I. Sutcliffe M.J. Stanfield P.R. J. Physiol. 2000; 526: 231-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 29.Alagem N. Dvir M. Reuveny E. J. Physiol. 2001; 534: 381-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Fig. 7 shows the effect of mutation at this site on agonist activation. Replacement of the alanine residue in Kir3.1 with a threonine residue (Kir3.1[A142T]; Fig. 7left), or the threonine residue in Kir3.4 with an alanine residue (Kir3.4[T148A]; Fig. 7middle) significantly reduced the extent of channel activation on application of agonist. This effect was modest in the case of the Kir3.1[A142T]/Kir3.4 mutant channel and large in the case of the Kir3.1/Kir3.4[T148A] mutant channel. Fig. 3A (bars 11 and 12) shows that the agonist-activated current at -130 mV was reduced by 32.6 ± 3.8% and 61.5 ± 1.3%, in the case of the Kir3.1[A142T]/Kir3.4 and Kir3.1/Kir3.4[T148A] mutant channels, respectively, (n = 5; ANOVA, p < 0.05) when compared with that of the wild-type channel. Curiously, the double mutation, Kir3.1[A142T]/Kir3.4[T148A], had no effect on agonist activation (Fig. 3A, bar 13; Fig. 7; n = 5; not significant). Correlation between Agonist Activation and Selectivity—The salt bridge behind the selectivity filter is likely to be important for the correct conformation of the selectivity filter (30.Berneche S. Roux B. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 2900-2917Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). The dramatic effect of disruption of the salt bridge in Kir3.4 could, therefore, be the result of the disruption of the selectivity filter, rather than the salt bridge per se. It is possible that the effects of the mutation of Ala-142 and Thr-148 in Kir3.1 and Kir3.4 may again be the result of disruption of the selectivity filter. To test this, the effect of the various mutations on channel selectivity as well as agonist activation was investigated. Fig. 3B shows a measure of channel selectivity. In these experiments, the 90 mm K+ in the extracellular solution was replaced with 90 mm Rb+. Rb+ permeated the wild-type channel to a certain extent; at -130 mV, Rb+ current was 0.35 ± 0.01 (n = 5) the size of the K+ current. However, in the case of the mutant channels in which the salt bridge in Kir3.4 had been broken and in the case of the Kir3.1/Kir3.4[T148A] mutant channel, Rb+ permeation was dramatically increased; Rb+ current was 0.88 ± 0.06, 1.33 ± 0.07, 0.92 ± 0.02, and 0.58 ± 0.03 the size of the K+ current in Kir3.1/Kir3.4[E145Q], Kir3.1/Kir3.4[R155E], Kir3.1/Kir3.4[E145R, R155E], and Kir3.1/Kir3.4[T148A] mutant channels, respectively (n = 5–6; ANOVA, p < 0.05), suggesting that, in these channels, selectivity was reduced or abolished (see also Ref. 31.Dibb K.M. Leach R. Findlay J.B. Boyett M.R. Biophys. J. 2001; 80: 624aGoogle Scholar). Interestingly, selectivity was also altered by the double mutation, Kir3.1[F181A]/Kir3.4[F187A]; Rb+ current was 0.64 ± 0.02 the size of the K+ current (n = 5; ANOVA, p < 0.05). However, selectivity was not affected in the Kir3.1[S170P]/Kir3.4[S176P] or Kir3.1[D173Q] mutant channels; Rb+ currents were 0.29 ± 0.02 and 0.32 ± 0.01 the size of the K+ current, respectively (n = 2–5; ANOVA, not significant). Fig. 3C shows that agonist dependence and channel selectivity are significantly correlated (r2 = 0.47, p < 0.02). These data suggest that the selectivity filter of the Kir3.1/Kir3.4 channel may be the agonist-activated gate. Rate of Agonist Activation—In Fig. 3C, the Kir3.1[E139Q]/Kir3.4 mutant channel (point 7) is an outlier: whereas disrupting the salt bridge in the Kir3.1 subunit by the mutation, Kir3.1[E139Q], had no effect on the size of the agonist-activated current, it did reduce selectivity; Rb+ current was 0.81 ± 0.06 the size of the K+ current (n = 5; ANOVA, p < 0.05). However, although the size of the agonist-activated current was not altered, the rate of agonist activation of the Kir3.1[E139Q]/Kir3.4 mutant channel was. Fig. 8 shows the rate of agonist activation in the wild-type channel and those mutant channels (including the Kir3.1[E139Q]/Kir3.4 mutant channel) in which agonist dependence was not completely abolished. Typical continuous current traces recorded at -80 mV during the rapid application of the agonist, dopamine, are shown in Fig. 8A. Cells were perfused initially with solution containing no agonist. This was then rapidly exchanged with solution containing dopamine. Fig. 8B shows the mean 10–90% rise time of agonist-activated current in the wild-type and mutant channels. Wild-type current activated in 7.7 ± 0.6 s (n = 13) on application of agonist. Activation was significantly slowed by the mutation Kir3.1[E139Q]; current activated in 11.1 ± 1.2 s (n = 6; ANOVA, p < 0.05). The rate of agonist activation was also slowed by a number of other mutations. Channels in which one of the pairs of phenylalanine residues was replaced (the Kir3.1[F181M]/Kir3.4 and Kir3.1/Kir3.4[F187M] mutant channels) activated more slowly on application of agonist; current activated in 10.8 ± 1.1 s and 12.0 ± 1.0 s, respectively (n = 4–5; ANOVA, p < 0.05). Also the mutations Kir3.4[T148A] and Kir3.1[A142T]/Kir3.4[T148A] slowed channel activation; current activated within 13.6 ± 0.6 s and 12.0 ± 0.3 s, respectively (n = 5; ANOVA, p < 0.05). In contrast, mutation of both of the pairs of phenylalanine residues to methionine residues (Kir3.1[F181M]/Kir3.4[F187M]) or of the alanine residue in Kir3.1 to a threonine residue (Kir3.1[A142T]) had no effect on the rate of agonist activation (n = 6–8; not significant). Spermine Can Permeate the Channel in the Absence of Agonist—We have previously shown that polyamines, such as spermine, can permeate the Kir3.1/Kir3.4 channel (32.Makary S.Y. Dibb K.M. Claydon T.W.

Our results suggest that the interaction of c-Myc with this promoter region is an important regulatory element controlling α7 integrin expression during muscle development and myotendinous junction formation. The α7 integrin is the dominant laminin-binding integrin in muscle and plays diverse roles during the different stages of development. Myoblasts and satellite cells express relatively low levels of the integrin, which promotes their rapid cell movement during development and after injury (1.Bao Z.Z. Lakonishok M. Kaufman S.

As differentiation proceeds, the elevation of α7 expression facilitates myoblast immobilization, fusion, and terminal differentiation. In mature muscle, as the α7-rich myotendinous junctions are formed, the muscle fiber uses extra copies of the integrin for formation of stable adhesion contacts as it inserts into the tendon. It is therefore important to understand how α7 is regulated, not only for its role in modulating cellular functions but also because defects in its expression are associated with certain types of muscular dystrophy (5.Hayashi Y.K.

Our goal in the present study was to identify regulatory promoter elements of α7 expression and understand how they cooperate to fine-tune expression in myoblasts and terminally differentiated myotubes. The expression of α7 integrin during skeletal muscle differentiation is regulated primarily at the transcriptional level (20.Ziober B.L. Kramer R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22915-22922Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The expression of this gene is driven by an upstream promoter (>2.8 kb) that lacks both TATA and CCAAT boxes but contains multiple consensus protein-binding sites. Deletion analysis indicates that the promoter consists of both positive and negative regulatory elements, which are believed to be important for tissue-specific expression of the integrin. Although the promoter activity is up-regulated by the muscle-specific transcription factors MyoD and myogenin and although the expression levels of the α7 mRNA and protein increase following myogenic differentiation, the mechanism governing the regulation of tissue- and differentiation-specific expression of α7 is unclear. Even less is known about how this gene is tightly controlled in undifferentiated myoblasts. It is important to identify specific signaling mechanisms involved in this regulation process. The α7 promoter contains multiple putative protein-binding sites that are highly conserved in the mouse and the human, suggesting that these protein-binding sites are essential for regulating expression of the α7 gene at the transcriptional level. Analysis of the human and mouse α7 promoters has revealed multiple consensus E-box sequences that are binding sites for the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) 1The abbreviations used are: bHLHbasic helix loop helixCATchloramphenicol acetyltransferaseSV40simian virus 40UREupstream regulatory element. transcription factors. One potential consensus binding site has been identified for c-Myc, which is known to be a strong inhibitor of myogenic differentiation (7.Denis N. Blanc S. Leibovitch M.P. Nicolaiew N. Dautry F.

Because there are at least eight consensus E-box sequences in the α7 promoter region, it is possible that c-Myc and other bHLH proteins may be involved in regulating α7 expression through these sequences (7.Denis N.

Consistent with this is the finding that levels of α7 protein expression are strongly elevated as C2C12 cells undergo terminal differentiation (20.Ziober B.L. Kramer R.H. J. Biol.

To understand the mechanisms that regulate the tissue- and differentiation-specific expression of α7, i.e. whether c-Myc is important for control of α7 gene expression in undifferentiated C2C12 myoblasts, we further analyzed the function of the upstream regulatory element of the α7 promoter and explored the potential role of c-Myc in down-regulating α7 expression. Cell Culture—C2C12 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum (Sigma). Differentiation of these cells was induced by replacing fetal bovine serum with 2% horse serum. Murine breast carcinoma cells, HtLM2, were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Cell Culture Facility, University of California at San Francisco) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. To preserve cells in an undifferentiated state, they were cultured in fresh growth medium containing 20% fetal bovine serum every 24 h. Cell differentiation was induced as previously described (20.Ziober B.L. Kramer R.H. J. Biol.

Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2988-2993Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar) was used for DNA transfections. Briefly, plasmid DNA was prepared using the Qiagen plasmid Maxi kit. The cells were plated into 10-cm cell culture dishes 16–20 h before transfection at 5 × 106 cells/plate. For each transfection, a total of 25 μg of plasmid DNA was diluted in 500 μl of 300 mm CaCl2 solution and then mixed with 500 μl of 2× HBS (280 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm Na2HPO4, 100 mm HEPES, pH 7.12). Cell medium was replaced with fresh growth medium (7 ml/plate) 30 min before transfection. The DNA-CaPO4 mixture was then added to each plate and cultured for 48–96 h or selected for stable expression using G-418 (Geneticin; Invitrogen). For chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) assays, a plasmid expressing the β-galactosidase protein was cotransfected with other expression vectors in each transfection to be used as an internal control for transfection efficiency. For stable expression of transfected genes, transfectants were selected with 500 μg/ml G-418 for 2 weeks, followed by single-cell cloning. The positive clones were maintained in growth medium containing 200 μg/ml G-418. For transient expression, the cells were harvested 48 h after transfection. Plasmid Construction—The full 2.8-kb α7 promoter was previously cloned into the CAT reporter construct (pCAT2.8) (20.Ziober B.L. Kramer R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22915-22922Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The plasmid expressing the mouse c-Myc was kindly provided by Dr. Steven Hann (22.Hann S.R. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1995; 375: 107-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The dominant-negative c-Myc plasmid Madmyc was a generous gift from Dr. Rene Bernards (The Netherlands Cancer Institute). The CAT reporter vector pCAT3-promoter (Promega, Madison, WI) containing the CAT gene driven by the simian virus 40 (SV40) promoter without a downstream enhancer was used as a cloning vector for analyzing regulatory functions of the α7 promoter fragments. To analyze the functions of different regions of the α7 promoter, the full promoter was amplified as five individual fragments by PCR using specific primers (Table I). The PCR fragments were then cloned into the plasmid pCAT3 promoter between MluI and XhoI restriction sites. Five constructs were created: pCAT0–0.5, pCAT0.5–1.0, pCAT1.0–1.5, pCAT1.5–2.0, and pCAT2.0–2.6. Deletion of protein-binding sites A/T-rich (AT), E-box-A/T-rich (EAT), and double E-box (E-E) was carried out using a site-specific mutagenesis method originally described by Rashtchian et al. (23.Rashtchian A. Thornton C.G. Heidecker G. PCR Methods Appl. 1992; 2: 124-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) and modified by Xiao and Buehring (24.Xiao J. Buehring G.C. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 5994-6003Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, two sets of dUTP-containing primers (Table I) were used to amplify the entire plasmid in two separate reactions. Each PCR fragment was obtained by using a universal primer (which anneals to the vector sequence) and a mutagenic primer (which contains the desired mutation). Overlapping sequences of 14–16 bp were used for both mutagenic and universal primers. After treating the PCR fragments with uracil DNA glycosylase to digest the dU-containing primer sequences, the PCR fragments were then reannealed to form a circularized plasmid, which was then used directly to transform competent Escherichia coli DH5α cells. The template plasmid DNA was digested with multiple restriction enzymes so that no colonies would result from the parental plasmid DNA after transformation. Three mutants were constructed: pCATdAT, pCATdEAT, and pCATdE-E.Table IPrimers used for constructing promoter-reporter plasmidsPrimer nameConstructSequencesA7p0.5-3′pCAT 0-0.5ATCCTCGAGAAGCTTGGGAGCACCG GCTCGGCA7p0.5-5′ATAACGCGTGGTACCTCTGAATGCTCACGTTGA7p0.5-3′pCAT 0.5-1.0TCCTCGAGAAGCTTCAGAGGACCAGAAAGAAGA7p1.0-5′ATAACGCGTGGTACCAATTCACTATGTAGCTTA7p1.-3′pCAT 1.0-1.5CACCTCGAGAAGCTTGGTCTCTGCCTGAATCAACA7p1.5-5′ATAACGCGTGGTACCAGTGGGGCTGTAGAGATGA7p1.5-3′pCAT 1.5-2.0ACCTCGAGAAGCTTAACCTCTGAGCCATCTCA7p2.0-5′CATAACGCGTGGTACCCATCTCTTTTATAGCACA7p2.0.-3′pCAT 2.0-2.6CACCTCGAGAAGCTTCAGTGTTCCCCAGTATTCA7p2.6-5′ATAACGCGTGGTACCTATAAGGGTTTGAAGTGdAt-5′pCATdATAGGAGGUCAGAAGCAGATTCdAT-3′ACCUCCUAGTCACCTCACCCGCCACAGGdEAT-5′pCATdEATAAGCAGAUTCTUGGGAAGCTGGTGdEAT-3′AAGAAUCUGCTUCTGACCTCCTCTd2E-5′pCATdE-EAGGCAAGCCAAGCUGGCATTTTGACTCd2E-3′AGCTUGGCTTGCCUCTGTCTGCACT Open table in a new tab CAT Assays—The cells were rinsed once with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed with 500 μl of lysis buffer/dish (Roche Applied Science), collected, and clarified by microcentrifugation. The supernatants were stored at –80 °C until use. CAT activity was detected and measured by assaying 10–50 μl of each cell lysate, using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit according to the manufacturer's protocol (Roche Applied Science). CAT activity in cell lysates was determined from a standard curve (obtained for each experiment using the method provided by the manufacturer). Transfection efficiency and CAT activity between transfections were normalized by cotransfection of the β-galactosidase plasmid DNA and by detection of β-galactosidase activity in each cell lysate using a Turner luminometer and a β-galactosidase assay kit (Promega). Super Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays—The nuclear extracts were prepared according to the method of Dyer and Herzog (25.Dyer R.B. Herzog N.K. BioTechniques. 1995; 19: 192-195PubMed Google Scholar) with some modifications. Briefly, monolayer cells were trypsinized and washed once with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, resuspended in sucrose buffer I (0.32 m sucrose, 3 mm CaCl2, 2 mm magnesium acetate, 0.1 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5% (v/v) Nonidet P-40), and centrifuged at 500 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. The nuclear extracts were obtained according to the published protocol (25.Dyer R.B. Herzog N.K. BioTechniques. 1995; 19: 192-195PubMed Google Scholar). The probes were labeled with [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Biosciences) using T4 polynucleotide kinase according to a standard protocol (26.Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000: 152-167Google Scholar). For DNA-protein binding, 10 μl (50 μg) of each nuclear extract was incubated with 50,000 cpm of radioactive probe in 50 μl of binding buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm KCl, 6.25 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 20% glycerol, and 1 mm dithiothreitol) at 4 °C for 30 min; 5 μl of antibody or 5 μl of phosphate-buffered saline was then added to the DNA-protein mix, and the reaction mix was incubated further at 4 °C for 12 h or at room temperature for 1 h. The DNA-protein complex was separated by electrophoresis on an 8% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel in Tris-borate-EDTA buffer at room temperature for 2 h. The gel was vacuum-dried onto Whatman 3MM filter paper. Then DNA-protein binding was detected by autoradiography for 24–48 h. The following probes are synthesized as double-stranded oligonucleotides (the consensus E-box is underlined; only the forward strands are shown here): A/T-rich, GGTGACTTCTCAAATATTTGGGCAGAGG; E-box-A/T-rich, GAAGCAGATTCTTGGGAAGCTGGTG; double E-box, GGCAAGCTGCAGGTGGAGAAAGGAAGGCAGCTGGAGCTCTAA; scrambled double E-box, AAGCTGATGGTAGAGAAAGGAAGGATGGTAGAGCTC; and consensus c-Myc, GGAAGCAGACCACGTGGTCTGCTTCC. Southwestern Blot Analysis—Nuclear extracts (100 μg/sample) were denatured at 100 °C for 5 min in 4% SDS and 50 mm DDT and then separated by SDS-PAGE. After electrophoresis, the proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA). The filters were washed in denaturing buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 25 mm Tris-HCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol) with 6 m guanidine HCl and then renatured by successive washing (five times for 10 min each at 4 °C) in 2-fold dilutions of guanidine HCl in denaturing buffer, with a final incubation in denaturing buffer without guanidine HCl. The membrane was then blocked by 5% nonfat dry milk in binding buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm dithiothreitol) for 1 h at room temperature and followed by overnight incubation with 5 × 106 cpm/ml of labeled probes in binding buffer containing 0.25% nonfat dry milk. Competition was performed by adding 1 μg/ml of unlabeled probe (about 200-fold in excess). The membranes were then washed with binding buffer with 0.25% nonfat dry milk at 4 °C for 30 min. Autoradiography was carried out at –80 °C with Kodak X-Omat AR film (Eastman Kodak Co.). Western Blotting—For detection of protein expression, the cells were rinsed once with 1× phosphate-buffered saline, lysed with 0.5 ml/10-cm dish of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.02% sodium azide, 100 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1% Triton X-100 or 1% Nonidet P-40), collected, and clarified by microcentrifugation at maximum speed. Fifty micrograms of total proteins (10 μl) of each sample was mixed with 10 μl of 2× sample buffer and loaded onto a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride transfer membranes (Millipore), blotted with specific antibodies, and detected with an ECL-Western blotting kit (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Antibodies included mouse anti-c-Myc monoclonal antibody, rabbit anti-human β1 cytodomain (polyclonal antibody 22778), and rabbit anti-mouse α7 light chain (polyclonal antibody 1211) (27.Yao C.C. Breuss J. Pytela R. Kramer R.H. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 1477-1487Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28.Vizirianakis I.S. Yao C.C. Chen Y. Ziober B.L. Tsiftsoglou A.S. Kramer R.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2001; 385: 108-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). For sequential blotting, the antibodies were stripped using reblot buffer (Amersham Biosciences) after each ECL detection according to the manufacturer's protocol. Quantitative PCR—High pressure liquid chromatography-purified salt-free primer for target gene mouse α7 (forward primer, AACCAATGGCTGGGAGTCAG; reverse primer, ATCCCGAGTCTCCAAAGCCT) were synthesized by the Bimolecular Resource Center (University of California at San Francisco). These primers were designed so that the melting temperature was 10 °C lower than the specific probes and were optimized with regard to AmpliTaq Gold (ABI) and MgCl2 concentration at 60 °C. Total RNA was extracted from C2C12 myoblasts (ATCC) as described previously. Total RNA (5 μg) was reverse transcribed with 250 units of murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) in a volume of 100 μl, using 5 μm random hexamer primers (Invitrogen) according to the following protocol: 25 °C for 10 min, 48 °C for 40 min, 95 °C for 5 min, with 1 mm dNTP, 7.5 mm MgCl2, and RNase inhibitor). The efficiency of probes was checked over a range of cDNA concentrations for quantitative PCR. FAM(5′)- and TAMRA(3′)-tagged probes were purchased from ABI (Athens, GA), the probe for α7 was CAAGATTGTTACGTGTGCACACCGATATG. Relative expression values were obtained in reference to mouse Gus gene expression. Each sample was assayed in triplicate on an ABI PRISM 7700 with Sequence Detection Software version 1.6. For the determination of relative expression from mRNA it was necessary to determine the threshold cycle (Ct) for each transcript. The Ct was defined as the point (in terms of cycle number) at which the fluorescence rises appreciably above the background fluorescence. This value was determined by the software automatically. α7 Expression Is Suppressed in Myoblasts but Is Up-regulated during Myogenic Differentiation—Using quantitative real time PCR, we found that as C2C12 cells differentiate into myotubes, α7 mRNA expression increased linearly to more than five times that of undifferentiated myoblasts (Fig. 1A). This increase continued up to 9–10 days when the α7 mRNA reached a plateau with more than a 20-fold increase compared with myoblasts (data not shown). To confirm that the increased transcription was responsible for this change in mRNA levels, we detected promoter activity in myoblasts using the CAT reporter gene driven by the full-length α7 promoter. In differentiated compared with undifferentiated C2C12 cells, CAT activity of the α7 promoter increased by about 1.5- and 3-fold at 48 and 96 h, respectively (Fig. 1B). Localization of Positive and Negative Regulatory Elements in the α7 Promoter—To study the mechanisms involved in regulation of α7 integrin expression, we tested various regions of the α7 promoter (Fig. 2A) for silencer and enhancer activities by using the pCAT3-promoter vector in which DNA fragments are inserted upstream of the SV40 promoter driving the CAT gene. We dissected the 2.8-kb α7 promoter into five fragments, cloned them into the pCAT3-promoter vector (Fig. 2B), and assessed enhancer and silencer activities by transient transfection and CAT-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays in C2C12 cells. As shown in Fig. 2C, the –1 to –500-bp DNA fragment increased the activity of the SV40 promoter nearly 4-fold, indicating that it functions as an enhancer for the SV40 promoter. However, the 2.0–2.6-kb fragment decreased CAT activity by 80%, suggesting that this region may act as a silencer for the SV40 promoter. In contrast, no change in promoter activity was found for the other three fragments, pCAT0.5–1.0, pCAT1.0–1.5, and pCAT1.5–2.0, suggesting that these fragments lack enhancer or silencer activity over the SV40 promoter. Because we were interested in the mechanisms involved in down-regulation, we focused on the 2.0–2.6-kb fragment, which is called the upstream regulatory element (URE). As shown in Fig. 2D, more than 90% of the URE sequence is highly conserved between the mouse and the human α7 integrin gene, suggesting that this region and the partially conserved motifs may be important for regulating expression of this gene. Of particular interest is the conserved CAGGTG E-box that is similar to the consensus sequence of c-Myc. Deletion Analysis of the α7 Promoter in Myoblasts and Differentiated Myotubes—As shown in Fig. 2D, the URE (–2 to –2.6 kb) contains two A/T-rich regions and three E-box regions that are potential binding sites for bHLH family proteins including c-Myc. To explore the possibility of involvement of c-Myc in regulation of α7 expression, we detected endogenous c-Myc expression in C2C12 cells undergoing differentiation. We found that c-Myc expression rapidly decreased to undetectable levels 96 h after the cells were cultured in differentiation medium (Fig. 3A). Our data are consistent with the literature showing that c-Myc is down-regulated during myodifferentiation. To investigate the mechanisms of gene regulation of the α7 integrin involving this region, we constructed the wild-type pCAT2.8 and three mutated CAT reporter plasmid vectors: pCATdAT, pCATdEAT, and pCATdEE. In these plasmids, the CAT gene is driven by mutated forms of the α7 promoter, each with a specific deletion at one of the three consensus protein-binding sites (Fig. 3B). To test whether MyoD and c-Myc can regulate promoter function through these protein-binding sites, we cotransfected each of the reporter constructs into undifferentiated C2C12 myoblasts, with the empty pcDNA3 vector, MyoD, c-Myc, dominant-negative Madmyc, MyoD and c-Myc (MyoD/Myc), or c-Myc and Madmyc (c-Myc/Mad). Promoter activities were then detected by CAT-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Co-transfection of MyoD enhanced the wild-type α7 promoter activity in myoblasts by about 2-fold (Fig. 3C). Conversely, the c-Myc oncoprotein inhibited expression of the CAT gene in myoblasts by over 50%. Deletion of the A/T-rich sequence produced no change in promoter activity in response to either MyoD or c-Myc, indicating that this region of the promoter is probably not relevant for these transcription factors (Fig. 3C, , pCATdAT). However, deletion of the E-box-A/T-rich region resulted in a loss of response to MyoD but not c-Myc (Fig. 3C, pCATdEAT), suggesting that this region may be important for the MyoD function in regulating integrin promoter activity. Next, deletion of the double E-box resulted in a loss of response to c-Myc (Fig. 3C, pCATdEE). To determine whether low levels of α7 expression are due to the effect of endogenous c-Myc in C2C12 myoblasts, we cotransfected these cells with the dominant-negative c-Myc (Madmyc) construct with the wild-type or the mutant α7 promoter constructs into C2C12 myoblasts and analyzed the promoter activity by CAT assay. Interestingly, Madmyc increased the promoter activity of the wild-type α7 promoter and two of the mutant α7 promoters (pCATdEAT and pCATdAT) but not the mutant with deletion at the double E-box. Furthermore, cotransfection with c-Myc and Madmyc (Myc/Mad) tended to neutralize the inhibitory activity of c-Myc. In cotransfection experiments with MyoD and c-Myc, the stimulating effects of MyoD on the α7 promoter were repressed by c-Myc, indicating that high levels of MyoD cannot completely override the effects of c-Myc. When the double E-box deletion mutant (pCATdEE) was tested with MyoD/Myc, strong stimulation of the promoter was detected. This is consistent with the conclusion that the double E-box is the primary sequence in the promoter where c-Myc exerts its repressor activity. Following differentiation of myoblasts into myotubes, transfection of MyoD failed to further enhance α7 gene promoter activity (Fig. 4, pCAT2.8, right panel). This is explained by the fact that endogenous MyoD expression is already elevated in myotubes and is sufficient to drive maximum α7 expression. However, c-Myc overexpression strongly decreased wild-type promoter activity in the differentiated myotubes. Deletion of the E-box-A/T-rich region resulted in loss of response to MyoD but not c-Myc, which is also especially evident in myotubes. Because this mutant also failed to respond to c-Myc in myotubes, we speculate that c-Myc may also function at this site through complex protein-protein interaction (Fig. 4, pCAT-dEAT). Both in myoblasts and in myotubes, deletion of the double E-box resulted in a loss of response to c-Myc (Fig. 4, pCATdEE), and this was particularly relevant in differentiating myotubes (Fig. 4, pCATdEE, right panel). This suggests that the double E-box may be important in mediating the down-regulation of α7 expression by the c-Myc oncoprotein and implicates this region as the binding site for c-Myc-like protein complexes.
