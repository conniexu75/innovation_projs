Using genetic-lineage tracing, Cedric Blanpain and colleagues for the first time clonally trace tumour cells in vivo in an unperturbed solid tumour. In a carcinogen-induced papilloma mouse model, they find that the cells in these benign lesions mirror the clonal hierarchy organization of normal tissue. Only a fraction of papilloma cells with a higher proliferative potential is able to sustain a second, slower-cycling transient population that gives rise to the differentiated tumour cells that form the bulk of the papillomas. But when lesions progress to squamous cell carcinomas, there is a switch to mainly self-renewing divisions and limited differentiation, suggesting that these cells may represent a cancer stem cell population. Evidence for cancer stem cells — a subset of tumour cells able to maintain tumour growth — has previously been demonstrated only in solid tumours in transplantation experiments. Recent studies using the isolation of a subpopulation of tumour cells followed by their transplantation into immunodeficient mice provide evidence that certain tumours1,2, including squamous skin tumours3,4,5, contain cells with high clonogenic potential that have been referred to as cancer stem cells (CSCs). Until now, CSC properties have only been investigated by transplantation assays, and their existence in unperturbed tumour growth is unproven. Here we make use of clonal analysis of squamous skin tumours using genetic lineage tracing to unravel the mode of tumour growth in vivo in its native environment. To this end, we used a genetic labelling strategy that allows individual tumour cells to be marked and traced over time at different stages of tumour progression. Surprisingly, we found that the majority of labelled tumour cells in benign papilloma have only limited proliferative potential, whereas a fraction has the capacity to persist long term, giving rise to progeny that occupy a significant part of the tumour. As well as confirming the presence of two distinct proliferative cell compartments within the papilloma, mirroring the composition, hierarchy and fate behaviour of normal tissue, quantitative analysis of clonal fate data indicates that the more persistent population has stem-cell-like characteristics and cycles twice per day, whereas the second represents a slower cycling transient population that gives rise to terminally differentiated tumour cells. Such behaviour is shown to be consistent with double-labelling experiments and detailed clonal fate characteristics. By contrast, measurements of clone size and proliferative potential in invasive squamous cell carcinoma show a different pattern of behaviour, consistent with geometric expansion of a single CSC population with limited potential for terminal differentiation. This study presents the first experimental evidence for the existence of CSCs during unperturbed solid tumour growth."

https://openalex.org/W2090442368,"Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD(+)) is an essential electron transporter in mitochondrial respiration and oxidative phosphorylation. In genomic DNA, NAD(+) also represents the sole substrate for the nuclear repair enzyme, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) and the sirtuin family of NAD-dependent histone deacetylases. Age associated increases in oxidative nuclear damage have been associated with PARP-mediated NAD(+) depletion and loss of SIRT1 activity in rodents. In this study, we further investigated whether these same associations were present in aging human tissue. Human pelvic skin samples were obtained from consenting patients aged between 15-77 and newborn babies (0-1 year old) (n = 49) previously scheduled for an unrelated surgical procedure. DNA damage correlated strongly with age in both males (p = 0.029; r = 0.490) and females (p = 0.003; r = 0.600) whereas lipid oxidation (MDA) levels increased with age in males (p = 0.004; r = 0.623) but not females (p = 0.3734; r = 0.200). PARP activity significantly increased with age in males (p<0.0001; r = 0.768) and inversely correlated with tissue NAD(+) levels (p = 0.0003; r = -0.639). These associations were less evident in females. A strong negative correlation was observed between NAD(+) levels and age in both males (p = 0.001; r = -0.706) and females (p = 0.01; r = -0.537). SIRT1 activity also negatively correlated with age in males (p = 0.007; r = -0.612) but not in females. Strong positive correlations were also observed between lipid peroxidation and DNA damage (p<0.0001; r = 0.4962), and PARP activity and NAD(+) levels (p = 0.0213; r = 0.5241) in post pubescent males. This study provides quantitative evidence in support of the hypothesis that hyperactivation of PARP due to an accumulation of oxidative damage to DNA during aging may be responsible for increased NAD(+) catabolism in human tissue. The resulting NAD(+) depletion may play a major role in the aging process, by limiting energy production, DNA repair and genomic signalling."
https://openalex.org/W2109590624,"Using intravital microscopy, this study visualizes HIV-1-infected T cells within the lymph nodes of humanized mice, demonstrating that infected cells have reduced motility and long membrane processes; treating infected mice with a lymphocyte egress inhibitor prevents HIV-1 from spreading to the circulation during the course of treatment. This study provides a first glimpse of the behaviour of HIV-infected cells in a living animal, revealing completely unanticipated events. Using multiphoton intravital microscopy, Thomas Murooka et al. visualize HIV-1 infected T cells in the lymph nodes of humanized mice. The authors observe reduced cell motility, and the presence of long membrane processes on infected cells. Treating infected mice with a lymphocyte-egress inhibitor prevented the spread of HIV-1 into the circulation, although this inhibition persisted only during treatment. After host entry through mucosal surfaces, human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) disseminates to lymphoid tissues to establish a generalized infection of the immune system. The mechanisms by which this virus spreads among permissive target cells locally during the early stages of transmission and systemically during subsequent dissemination are not known1. In vitro studies suggest that the formation of virological synapses during stable contacts between infected and uninfected T cells greatly increases the efficiency of viral transfer2. It is unclear, however, whether T-cell contacts are sufficiently stable in vivo to allow for functional synapse formation under the conditions of perpetual cell motility in epithelial3 and lymphoid tissues4. Here, using multiphoton intravital microscopy, we examine the dynamic behaviour of HIV-infected T cells in the lymph nodes of humanized mice. We find that most productively infected T cells migrate robustly, resulting in their even distribution throughout the lymph node cortex. A subset of infected cells formed multinucleated syncytia through HIV envelope-dependent cell fusion. Both uncoordinated motility of syncytia and adhesion to CD4+ lymph node cells led to the formation of long membrane tethers, increasing cell lengths to up to ten times that of migrating uninfected T cells. Blocking the egress of migratory T cells from the lymph nodes into efferent lymph vessels, and thus interrupting T-cell recirculation, limited HIV dissemination and strongly reduced plasma viraemia. Thus, we have found that HIV-infected T cells are motile, form syncytia and establish tethering interactions that may facilitate cell-to-cell transmission through virological synapses. Migration of T cells in lymph nodes therefore spreads infection locally, whereas their recirculation through tissues is important for efficient systemic viral spread, suggesting new molecular targets to antagonize HIV infection."

Numerous PCR primers have been designed to amplify nifH, but a comprehensive evaluation of nifH PCR primers has not been performed. We performed an in silico analysis of the specificity and coverage of 51 universal and 35 group-specific nifH primers by using an aligned database of 23,847 nifH sequences. We found that there are 15 universal nifH primers that target 90% or more of nitrogen fixers, but that there are also 23 nifH primers that target less than 50% of nifH sequences. The nifH primers we evaluated vary in their phylogenetic bias and their ability to recover sequences from commonly sampled environments. In addition, many of these primers will amplify genes that do not mediate nitrogen fixation, and thus it would be advisable for researchers to screen their sequencing results for the presence of non-target genes before analysis. Universal primers that performed well in silico were tested empirically with soil samples and with genomic DNA from a phylogenetically diverse set of nitrogen-fixing strains. This analysis will be of great utility to those engaged in molecular analysis of nifH genes from isolates and environmental samples."
https://openalex.org/W2054446926,"Oxidative stress is a major cause of defective sperm function in cases of male infertility. Such stress is known to be associated with high levels of superoxide production by the sperm mitochondria; however, the causes of this aberrant activity are unknown. Here we show that electrophilic aldehydes such as 4-hydroxynonenal (4HNE) and acrolein, generated as a result of lipid peroxidation, target the mitochondria of human spermatozoa and stimulate mitochondrial superoxide generation in a dose- and time-dependent manner. The activation of mitochondrial electron leakage by 4HNE is shown to involve the disruption of succinate dehydrogenase activity and subsequent activation of an intrinsic apoptotic cascade beginning with a loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and terminating in oxidative DNA adduct formation, DNA strand breakage, and cell death. A tight correlation between spontaneous mitochondrial superoxide generation and 4HNE content (R(2) = 0.89) in untreated populations of human spermatozoa emphasized the pathophysiological significance of these findings. The latter also provide a biochemical explanation for the self-perpetuating nature of oxidative stress in the male germ line, with the products of lipid peroxidation stimulating free radical generation by the sperm mitochondria in a positive feedback loop."

Atg18 plays a critical role in autophagosome formation as a complex with Atg2 and phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PtdIns(3)P). However, little is known about the structure of Atg18 and its recognition mode of Atg2 or PtdIns(3)P.

Mutational analyses of Atg18 based on the K. marxianus Hsv2 structure suggested that Atg18 has two phosphoinositide-binding sites at blades 5 and 6, whereas the Atg2-binding region is located at blade 2. Point mutations in the loops of blade 2 specifically abrogated autophagy without affecting another Atg18 function, the regulation of vacuolar morphology at the vacuolar membrane.

Macroautophagy (hereafter referred to as autophagy) is an intracellular degradation system conserved among eukaryotes from yeast to mammals. During autophagy, a double-membrane structure called an autophagosome sequesters a portion of the cytoplasm and fuses with a vacuole (or lysosome in the case of mammalian autophagy) to deliver its inner contents to the lumen of the organelle (1Mizushima N. Yoshimori T. Ohsumi Y. The role of Atg proteins in autophagosome formation.Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2011; 27: 107-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (2153) Google Scholar). Autophagy is important in a wide range of physiological processes, such as adaptation to starvation, quality control of intracellular proteins and organelles, embryonic development, elimination of intracellular microbes, and prevention of neurodegeneration and tumor formation (2Mizushima N.

Currently, >30 genes involved in autophagy have been isolated in yeast and termed autophagy-related (ATG) genes. Among these genes, ATG1–10, ATG12–14, ATG16–18, ATG29, and ATG31 are essential for autophagosome formation during starvation-induced autophagy, and the 18 Atg proteins they encode are classified into six functional groups (1Mizushima N.

Besides Atg2, Atg18 also binds to PtdIns(3)P and PtdIns(3,5)P2 and is therefore considered to be one of the effectors of these molecules (11Dove S.K. Piper R.C. McEwen R.K. Yu J.W. King M.C.

These observations suggest that the interaction of Atg18 with Atg2 and PtdIns(3)P at the PAS is essential for the formation of autophagosomes. In addition to autophagy, Atg18 also has a role in regulating the vacuolar morphology of yeast, for which Atg18 localizes to the vacuolar membrane through its interaction with PtdIns(3,5)P2, but not with PtdIns(3)P (11Dove S.K.

Moreover, they were also predicted to have a seven-bladed β-propeller similar to Atg18. To reveal the architecture of Atg18, we herein report the crystal structure of Hsv2 from a thermotolerant yeast, Kluyveromyces marxianus (KmHsv2), at a resolution of 2.6 Å. The structure reveals a seven-bladed β-propeller fold. Mutational analyses of Atg18 based on the structure of KmHsv2 showed that Atg18 possesses two binding sites for phosphoinositides at blades 5 and 6, whereas the loop regions in blade 2 are specifically required for recognizing Atg2 and thus for autophagy. These results suggest that Atg18 tethers Atg2 to the PAS and autophagic membranes through its simultaneous interaction with Atg2 and PtdIns(3)P, thus playing a critical role in the formation of autophagosomes. KmHsv2 was amplified by PCR and cloned into the pGEX-6P-1 vector (GE Healthcare) to produce GST fusion proteins. The construct was sequenced to confirm its identity and expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells that were cultured in 2× YT medium containing 10 g/liter yeast extract, 16 g/liter Tryptone, and 5 g/liter sodium chloride. After cell lysis by sonication, GST-fused proteins were purified by affinity chromatography using a glutathione-Sepharose 4B column (GE Healthcare). The GST tag was then cleaved with PreScission protease (GE Healthcare) and removed by affinity chromatography using a glutathione-Sepharose 4B column. This process left a Gly-Pro-Leu-Gly-Ser sequence at the N terminus of Hsv2. Further purification was performed using a Superdex 200 gel filtration column (GE Healthcare) and elution with 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 150 mm NaCl. Crystallization of Hsv2 was performed using the sitting drop vapor diffusion method at 20 °C. Drops of 10 mg/ml Hsv2 in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, and 2 mm dithiothreitol were mixed with equal amounts of reservoir solution (1.2 m (NH4)2SO4 and 100 mm acetate buffer at pH 5.5) and equilibrated against 100 μl of the same reservoir solution by vapor diffusion. Crystals, typically with dimensions of 0.30 × 0.25 × 0.25 mm, were obtained within one week. Diffraction data of the native and selenomethionine-labeled crystals were collected on an ADSC Quantum 210 charge-coupled device detector using beamline AR-NW12A at KEK (Ibaraki, Japan). The diffraction data were indexed, integrated, and scaled using the HKL2000 program suite (21Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Processing of x-ray diffraction data collected in oscillation mode.Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38526) Google Scholar). The initial phasing was performed by the multiwavelength anomalous dispersion method using the peak, edge, and remote data from the selenomethionine-labeled crystals.

Autophagosome formation can be achieved in the absence of Atg18 by expressing engineered PAS-targeted Atg2.FEBS Lett. 2012; 586: 2473-2478Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Point mutations were introduced by PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis using the pRS316-based plasmid for Atg18-HG as a template. The successful introduction of the point mutations was confirmed by sequencing. The intracellular localization of monomeric red fluorescent protein (mRFP)- or EGFP-tagged proteins was visualized using an inverted fluorescence microscope (IX-71, Olympus) equipped with an EM-CCD digital camera (ImagEM, Hamamatsu Photonics K.K.). Images were acquired using AquaCosmos 2.6 software (Hamamatsu Photonics K.K.) and processed using Photoshop CS4 software (Adobe Systems). To observe the PAS, yeast cells were treated with rapamycin (final concentration, 0.2 μg/ml) for 1 h to induce autophagy. Cells at the logarithmic phase were loaded with 2 μg/ml FM4-64 (Invitrogen) for 30 min, washed, and chased with FM4-64-free medium for 30 min. To quantify bulk autophagic activity, we utilized the Pho8Δ60 alkaline phosphatase assay as described previously (31Noda T. Matsuura A. Wada Y. Ohsumi Y. Novel system for monitoring autophagy in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 210: 126-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). Yeast protein extracts were prepared as reported previously (30Kobayashi T. Suzuki K. Ohsumi Y.

Immunoblotting was performed using anti-Ape1 (API-2), anti-HA (3F10), or anti-Pgk1 antibodies (Invitrogen). Chemiluminescence detection was performed using Pierce Western blotting substrate (Thermo Scientific) and detected using an LAS-4000 mini image analyzer (GE Healthcare). Cells were treated with 200 μg/ml Zymolyase 100T (07665-55, Nacalai Tesque) for 45 min at 30 °C in spheroplasting buffer (50 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.2), 1 m sorbitol, 1% yeast extract, 2% Bacto-peptone, 1% glucose, and 10 mm DTT). The spheroplasts were washed once with spheroplasting buffer, grown for 20 min at 30 °C, and then treated with 0.5 μg/ml rapamycin for 1 h at 30 °C. The spheroplasts were harvested and treated with 0.5% Triton X-100 for 30 min on ice in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 50 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, and protease inhibitor mixture (P8340, Sigma)). The total lysate was centrifuged at 17,400 × g for 20 min at 4 °C, and the resulting supernatant was incubated with GFP-Trap_M (gtm-20, ChromoTek) or rabbit IgG-conjugated magnetic beads (Dynabeads M-270 epoxy, Invitrogen) for 3 h at 4 °C. The bound materials were washed three times with lysis buffer and then eluted with SDS-PAGE sample buffer for 15 min at 65 °C. We first tried to crystallize S. cerevisiae Atg18 but failed to obtain good diffracting crystals, so we adopted a strategy to obtain crystals from various Atg18 homologs/paralogs, including S. cerevisiae Atg21, Pichia pastoris Atg18, Arabidopsis thaliana Atg18b, and Homo sapiens Atg18 homologs (WIPI-1–4). However, these trials also failed. Recently, we succeeded in determining the solution structure of Atg10 by switching the target from S. cerevisiae Atg10 to K. marxianus Atg10 (32Yamaguchi M. Noda N.N. Yamamoto H. Shima T. Kumeta H. Kobashigawa Y. Akada R. Ohsumi Y. Inagaki F. Structural insights into Atg10-mediated formation of the autophagy-essential Atg12-Atg5 conjugate.Structure. 2012; 20: 1244-1254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). K. marxianus is a thermotolerant yeast, so the homologs in this yeast could be expected to have higher stability than those in other eukaryotes. We thus attempted to crystallize K. marxianus Atg18 paralogs and succeeded in obtaining good diffracting crystals of KmHsv2 (referred to simply as Hsv2 hereafter), and we determined the crystal structure of Hsv2 by the multiwavelength anomalous dispersion method using a selenomethionine-substituted crystal (supplemental Fig. S1). The structure was refined against 2.6 Å data to an R-factor of 0.224 and a free R-factor of 0.252 (Table 1). The asymmetric unit of the crystal contains two Hsv2 molecules (Hsv2A and Hsv2B). The Hsv2 model obtained lacks 13 N-terminal residues and some loop regions (residues 164–181 in Hsv2A and residues 163–181 and 268–284 in Hsv2B) due to undefined electron density. Hsv2 possesses a seven-bladed β-propeller fold, in which each blade consists of a four-β-stranded antiparallel β-sheet, resembling each other (Fig. 1A). Circular permutation, which is frequently observed in β-propeller proteins, is not observed in this fold. Residues 263–289 of Hsv2A form a large extended loop connecting the C and D β-strands (CD loop) in blade 6, which protrudes from the β-propeller fold as far as ∼25 Å. The ordered conformation of this loop is stabilized by crystal packing. In contrast, the electron density of the equivalent residues of Hsv2B is disordered, suggesting that these residues have a flexible conformation in solution. The phosphoinositide-binding FRRG motif (residues 229–232) of Hsv2 is located at the D β-strand in blade 5 and the loop connecting blades 5 and 6. Intriguingly, the side chains of the two arginine residues of the motif, Arg-230 and Arg-231, point in opposite directions (Fig. 1B). In the proximity of Arg-230, there is a basic pocket composed of Ser-209, Thr-213, and Arg-216 from blade 5 and His-189, Thr-190, and Asn-191 from the loop connecting blades 4 and 5. A sulfate ion is bound to this basic pocket, suggesting that it has a role in accommodating phosphoinositides; thus, this pocket was named site 1. The structure of site 1 is very similar between Hsv2A and Hsv2B (Fig. 1B). Arg-231 is involved in the construction of another basic pocket composed of Ser-254, Lys-256, Thr-258, and His-260 from blade 6. The structure of this second pocket is somewhat distinct between Hsv2A and Hsv2B. In Hsv2A, the loop connecting blades 5 and 6 has a conformation closer to blade 6, and the side chain of Asp-234 on the loop is bound deeply in the pocket, whereas in Hsv2B, the pocket is occupied by the side chain of Glu-336 of the crystallographically adjacent Hsv2 molecule. In both cases, the basic pocket is occupied by a negatively charged carboxyl group, suggesting that it has a similar role to site 1 in accommodating phosphoinositides; thus, the second pocket was named site 2. The residues constituting sites 1 and 2 are highly conserved among the Atg18 homologs/paralogs, suggesting the possibility that Atg18 and its relatives possess two binding pockets for phosphoinositides.

U.S.A. 2012; 109: E2042-E2049Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) reported the crystal structure of Kluyveromyces lactis Hsv2. The overall structure of K. lactis Hsv2 is similar to that of KmHsv2, and it possesses two basic pockets similar to sites 1 and 2 in KmHsv2. They showed that both pockets are important for recognizing phosphoinositides according to in vitro mutational analyses. We also observed that a single mutation at either Arg-230 (site 1) or Arg-231 (site 2) resulted in a partial defect, and simultaneous mutation at both residues resulted in a more severe defect in autophagy (supplemental Fig. S2), suggesting that both sites are important for recognizing PtdIns(3)P. Besides two binding pockets, Baskaran et al. (33Baskaran S. Ragusa M.J. Boura E. Hurley J.H. Two-site recognition of phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate by PROPPINs in autophagy.Mol.

Structurally annotated multiple sequence alignment of KmHsv2 with Atg18 orthologs (S. cerevisiae, K. marxianus, P. pastoris, and H. sapiens WIPI-1) showed that the residues in blades 2, 3, 5, and 6 are highly conserved among the Atg18 orthologs (Fig. 2A).

https://openalex.org/W2042985193,"FOXO3 is a transcription factor involved in the regulation of multiple physiological processes including cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, oxidative stress-response and energy metabolism. Although much is known about its post-translational modification, the transcriptional regulation of FOXO3, as well as the cross-talk between transcription and post-translational events, is still poorly understood. In the present study, we show that FOXO3 is an immediate early glucocorticoid receptor (GR) target, whose transcription is even further enhanced by conditions that mimic metabolic stress. Induction of FOXO3 transcription by GR-binding steroids was reversed by concomitant treatment with the GR antagonist RU-486, but further enhanced by stimuli that activate the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). Analysis of genomic DNA and chromatin immunoprecipitation, as well as luciferase reporter assays, revealed two functional glucocorticoid responsive elements within the FOXO3 promoter. Furthermore, we provide functional evidence for a phosphorylation switch that explains how glucocorticoids induce transcriptional activation of the gene but subsequently inactivate the corresponding protein by site-specific phosphorylation. Only when AMPK is stimulated, pre-existing FOXO3 becomes reverted toward an active form. Energy deprived conditions thus activate FOXO3 on two different levels, namely transcriptional and post-translational. In that way, FOXO3 acts as a metabolic stress sensor that coordinates expression of LKB1, the master upstream kinase involved in metabolic sensing, depending on the energy status of the cell. Additionally, we show that FOXO3 binds and activates its own promoter via a positive autoregulatory feedback loop. In conclusion, our data explain how catabolic glucocorticoid hormones and high intracellular AMP levels cooperate in inducing FOXO3 transcription and in activating the corresponding protein."
https://openalex.org/W2046538350,"Starch digestion involves the breakdown by α-amylase to small linear and branched malto-oligosaccharides, which are in turn hydrolyzed to glucose by the mucosal α-glucosidases, maltase-glucoamylase (MGAM) and sucrase-isomaltase (SI). MGAM and SI are anchored to the small intestinal brush-border epithelial cells, and each contains a catalytic N- and C-terminal subunit. All four subunits have α-1,4-exohydrolytic glucosidase activity, and the SI N-terminal subunit has an additional exo-debranching activity on the α-1,6-linkage. Inhibition of α-amylase and/or α-glucosidases is a strategy for treatment of type 2 diabetes. We illustrate here the concept of “toggling”: differential inhibition of subunits to examine more refined control of glucogenesis of the α-amylolyzed starch malto-oligosaccharides with the aim of slow glucose delivery. Recombinant MGAM and SI subunits were individually assayed with α-amylolyzed waxy corn starch, consisting mainly of maltose, maltotriose, and branched α-limit dextrins, as substrate in the presence of four different inhibitors: acarbose and three sulfonium ion compounds. The IC50 values show that the four α-glucosidase subunits could be differentially inhibited. The results support the prospect of controlling starch digestion rates to induce slow glucose release through the toggling of activities of the mucosal α-glucosidases by selective enzyme inhibition.

However, few studies have investigated the relationship between cold spells and pediatric outpatient visits for asthma.To examine the association between cold spells and pediatric outpatient visits for asthma in Shanghai, China.We collected daily data on pediatric outpatient visits for asthma, mean temperature, relative humidity, and ozone from Shanghai between 1 January 2007 and 31 December 2009. We defined cold spells as four or more consecutive days with temperature below the 5(th) percentile of temperature during 2007-2009. We used a Poisson regression model to examine the impact of temperature on pediatric outpatient visits for asthma in cold seasons during 2007 and 2009. We examined the effect of cold spells on asthma compared with non-cold spell days.There was a significant relationship between cold temperatures and pediatric outpatient visits for asthma. The cold effects on children's asthma were observed at different lags. The lower the temperatures, the higher the risk for asthma attacks among children.Cold temperatures, particularly cold spells, significantly increase the risk of pediatric outpatient visits for asthma. The findings suggest that asthma children need to be better protected from cold effects in winter."
https://openalex.org/W2093918399,"Decoding others' intentions is a crucial aspect of social cognition. Neuroimaging studies suggest that inferring immediate goals engages the neural system for action understanding (i.e. mirror system), while the decoding of long-term intentions requires the system subserving the attribution of mental states (i.e. mentalizing). A controversial issue, stimulated by recent inconsistent results, concerns whether the two systems are concurrently vs. exclusively involved in intention understanding. This issue is particularly relevant in the case of social interactions, whose processing has been mostly, but not uncontroversially, associated with the mentalizing system. We tested the alternative hypothesis that the relative contribution of the two systems in intention understanding may also depend on the shared goal of interacting agents. To this purpose, 27 participants observed social interactions differing in their cooperative vs. affective shared goal during functional-Magnetic-Resonance-Imaging. The processing of both types of interactions activated the right temporo-parietal junction involved in mentalizing on action goals. Additionally, whole-brain and regions-of-interest analyses showed that the action understanding system (inferior prefrontal-parietal cortex) was more strongly activated by cooperative interactions, while the mentalizing-proper system (medial prefrontal cortex) was more strongly engaged by affective interactions. These differences were modulated by individual differences in empathizing. Both systems can thus be involved in understanding social intentions, with a relative weighting depending on the specific shared goal of the interaction."
https://openalex.org/W2081262930,"Pyrrolysine is represented by an amber codon in genes encoding proteins such as the methylamine methyltransferases present in some Archaea and Bacteria. Pyrrolysyl-tRNA synthetase (PylRS) attaches pyrrolysine to the amber-suppressing tRNA(Pyl). Archaeal PylRS, encoded by pylS, has a catalytic C-terminal domain but an N-terminal region of unknown function and structure. In Bacteria, homologs of the N- and C-terminal regions of archaeal PylRS are respectively encoded by pylSn and pylSc. We show here that wild type PylS from Methanosarcina barkeri and PylSn from Desulfitobacterium hafniense bind tRNA(Pyl) in EMSA with apparent K(d) values of 0.12 and 0.13 μM, respectively. Truncation of the N-terminal region of PylS eliminated detectable tRNA(Pyl) binding as measured by EMSA, but not catalytic activity. A chimeric protein with PylSn fused to the N terminus of truncated PylS regained EMSA-detectable tRNA(Pyl) binding. PylSn did not bind other D. hafniense tRNAs, nor did the competition by the Escherichia coli tRNA pool interfere with tRNA(Pyl) binding. Further indicating the specificity of PylSn interaction with tRNA(Pyl), substitutions of conserved residues in tRNA(Pyl) in the variable loop, D stem, and T stem and loop had significant impact in binding, whereas those having base changes in the acceptor stem or anticodon stem and loop still retained the ability to complex with PylSn. PylSn and the N terminus of PylS comprise the protein superfamily TIGR03129. The members of this family are not similar to any known RNA-binding protein, but our results suggest their common function involves specific binding of tRNA(Pyl)."
https://openalex.org/W2045683294,"Community Q fever epidemics occurred in the Netherlands in 2007–2009, with dairy goat and dairy sheep farms as the implicated source. The aim of the study was to determine the seroprevalence and risk factors for seropositivity in dairy goat farmers and their household members living or working on these farms. Sera of 268 people living or working on 111 dairy goat farms were tested for Coxiella burnetii IgG and IgM antibodies using immunofluorescence assay. Seroprevalences in farmers, spouses and children (12–17 years) were 73.5%, 66.7%, and 57.1%, respectively. Risk factors for seropositivity were: performing three or more daily goat-related tasks, farm location in the two southern provinces of the country, proximity to bulk milk-positive farms, distance from the nearest stable to residence of 10 meters or less, presence of cats and multiple goat breeds in the stable, covering stable air spaces and staff not wearing farm boots. Goat farmers have a high risk to acquire this occupational infection. Clinicians should consider Q fever in this population presenting with compatible symptoms to allow timely diagnosis and treatment to prevent severe sequelae. Based on the risk factors identified, strengthening general biosecurity measures is recommended such as consistently wearing boots and protective clothing by farm staff to avoid indirect transmission and avoiding access of companion animals in the goat stable. Furthermore, it provides an evidence base for continuation of the current vaccination policy for small ruminants, preventing spread from contaminated farms to other farms in the vicinity. Finally, vaccination of seronegative farmers and household members could be considered."
https://openalex.org/W2045555270,"Animal models are essential to study the pathophysiological changes associated with focal occlusive stroke and to investigate novel therapies. Currently used rodent models have yielded little clinical success, however large animal models may provide a more suitable alternative to improve clinical translation. We sought to develop a model of acute proximal middle cerebral artery (MCA) ischemic stroke in sheep, including both permanent occlusion and transient occlusion with reperfusion.18 adult male and female Merino sheep were randomly allocated to one of three groups (n = 6/gp): 1) sham surgery; 2) permanent proximal MCA occlusion (MCAO); or 3) temporary MCAO with aneurysm clip. All animals had invasive arterial blood pressure, intracranial pressure and brain tissue oxygen monitoring. At 4 h following vessel occlusion or sham surgery animals were killed by perfusion fixation. Brains were processed for histopathological examination and infarct area determination. 6 further animals were randomized to either permanent (n = 3) or temporary MCAO (n = 3) and then had magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at 4 h after MCAO.Evidence of ischemic injury in an MCA distribution was seen in all stroke animals. The ischemic lesion area was significantly larger after permanent (28.8%) compared with temporary MCAO (14.6%). Sham animals demonstrated no evidence of ischemic injury. There was a significant reduction in brain tissue oxygen partial pressure after permanent vessel occlusion between 30 and 210 mins after MCAO. MRI at 4 h demonstrated complete proximal MCA occlusion in the permanent MCAO animals with a diffusion deficit involving the whole right MCA territory, whereas temporary MCAO animals demonstrated MRA evidence of flow within the right MCA and smaller predominantly cortical diffusion deficits.Proximal MCAO can be achieved in an ovine model of stroke via a surgical approach. Permanent occlusion creates larger infarct volumes, however aneurysm clip application allows for reperfusion."
https://openalex.org/W2045638357,"Background The acute assessment of patients with suspected ischemic stroke remains challenging. The use of brain biomarker assays may improve the early diagnosis of ischemic stroke. The main goal of the study was to evaluate whether the NR2 peptide, a product of the proteolytic degradation of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors, can differentiate acute ischemic stroke (IS) from stroke mimics and persons with vascular risk factors/healthy controls. A possible correlation between biomarker values and lesion sizes was investigated as the secondary objective. Methods and Findings A total of 192 patients with suspected stroke who presented within 72 h of symptom onset were prospectively enrolled. The final diagnosis was determined based on clinical observations and radiological findings. Additionally gender- and age-matched healthy controls (n = 52) and persons with controlled vascular risk factors (n = 48) were recruited to compare NR2 peptide levels. Blinded plasma was assayed by rapid magnetic particles (MP) ELISA for NR2 peptide within 30 min and results for different groups compared using univariate and multivariate statistical analyses. There was a clinical diagnosis of IS in 101 of 192 (53%) and non-stroke in 91 (47%) subjects. The non-stroke group included presented with acute stroke symptoms who had no stroke (n = 71) and stroke mimics (n = 20). The highest NR2 peptide elevations where found in patients with IS that peaked at 12 h following symptom onset. When the biomarker cut off was set at 1.0 ug/L, this resulted in a sensitivity of 92% and a specificity of 96% to detect IS. A moderate correlation (rs = 0.73) between NR2 peptide values and acute ischemic cortical lesions (<200 mL) was found. Conclusions This study suggests that the NR2 peptide may be a brain specific biomarker to diagnose acute IS and may allow the differentiation of IS from stroke mimics and controls. Additional larger scale clinical validation studies are required."

A series of 116 NSCLC DNA samples investigated by Sanger Sequencing (SS), including 106 samples carrying exon 19 EGFR deletions and 10 without deletions (control samples), were subjected to deep next generation sequencing (NGS). All samples with deletions at SS showed deletions with NGS. No deletions were seen in control cases. In 93 (88%) cases, deletions detected by NGS were exactly corresponding to those identified by SS. In 13 cases (12%) NGS resolved deletions not accurately characterized by SS. In 21 (20%) cases the NGS showed presence of complex (double/multiple) frameshift deletions producing a net in-frame change. In 5 of these cases the SS could not define the exact sequence of mutant alleles, in the other 16 cases the results obtained by SS were conventionally considered as deletions plus insertions. Different interpretative hypotheses for complex mutations are discussed. In 46 (43%) tumors deep NGS showed, for the first time to our knowledge, subpopulations of DNA molecules carrying EGFR deletions different from the main one. Each of these subpopulations accounted for 0.1% to 17% of the genomic DNA in the different tumors investigated. Our findings suggest that a region in exon 19 is highly unstable in a large proportion of patients carrying EGFR deletions. As a corollary to this study, NGS data were compared with those obtained by immunohistochemistry using the 6B6 anti-mutant EGFR antibody. The immunoreaction was E746-A750del specific. In conclusion, NGS analysis of EGFR exon 19 in NSCLCs allowed us to formulate a new interpretative hypothesis for complex mutations and revealed the presence of subpopulations of deletions with potential pathogenetic and clinical impact."

https://openalex.org/W1972629692,"Background To prevent and control infectious diseases, it is important to understand how sex and age influence morbidity rates, but consistent clear descriptions of differences in the reported incidence of infectious diseases in terms of sex and age are sparse. Methods and Findings Data from the Japanese surveillance system for infectious diseases from 2000 to 2009 were used in the analysis of seven viral and four bacterial infectious diseases with relatively large impact on the Japanese community. The male-to-female morbidity (MFM) ratios in different age groups were estimated to compare incidence rates of symptomatic reported infection between the sexes at different ages. MFM ratios were >1 for five viral infections out of seven in childhood, i.e. male children were more frequently reported as infected than females with pharyngoconjunctival fever, herpangina, hand-foot-and-mouth disease, mumps, and varicella. More males were also reported to be infected with erythema infectiosum and exanthema subitum, but only in children 1 year of age. By contrast, in adulthood the MFM ratios decreased to <1 for all of the viral infections above except varicella, i.e. adult women were more frequently reported to be infected than men. Sex- and age-related differences in reported morbidity were also documented for bacterial infections. Reported morbidity for enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli infection was higher in adult females and females were reportedly more infected with mycoplasma pneumonia than males in all age groups up to 70 years. Conclusions Sex-related differences in reported morbidity for viral and bacterial infections were documented among different age groups. Changes in MFM ratios with age may reflect differences between the sexes in underlying development processes, including those affecting the immune, endocrine, and reproductive systems, or differences in reporting rates."
https://openalex.org/W1966901182,"The leading cause of pregnancy-associated mortality and morbidity is pre-eclampsia (PE). Although information regarding the etiology of this disease is scant, its pathophysiology is characterized by abnormal placentation, endothelial dysfunction as well as an exaggerated inflammatory response. Clinical evidence also indicates that the abundance of many immune cells at the feto-maternal interface and in the circulation of PE patients is abnormal, when compared with normal pregnant (NP) controls. In addition, the phenotype and function of some of these cells is altered. To further characterize the systemic effects of PE on circulating cells, we analyzed monocytic subpopulations in NP and PE patients by flow cytometry. We found that non-classical CD14lowCD16+ monocytes are significantly increased in women with PE and they display irregular expression of several chemokine receptors and antigen presentation molecules. The most striking phenotypic difference among the cell surface molecules was the marked upregulation of TLR4 expression, where both CD14highCD16+ and CD14lowCD16+ monocytes demonstrated higher levels than their NP counterparts. Stimulation of PE monocytes with TLR ligands resulted in profound secretion of various cytokines in comparison with NP controls. These data suggest that PE monocytes are hyper-responsive to TLR ligands and this may contribute to exacerbation of the disease."
https://openalex.org/W2005004872,"Connexins (Cx) form gap junctions and allow the coordination of cellular behaviour. In vessels, expression of Cx40, Cx37, and Cx43 is well established and specifically Cx40 serves important functions in endothelial cells. In contrast, expression and physiological functions of Cx45 is unclear although its expression has been suggested in vascular smooth muscle (VSM). Therefore, we studied expression and function of Cx45 in vessels using different mice models allowing to identify and delete Cx45. Smooth muscle cell (SMC)-specific deletion was achieved by the Cre/loxP system using Cre-recombinase driven by a Nestin promoter. Deletion of Cx45 leads concomitantly to the expression of enhanced green fluorescence protein (EGFP) in these mice. Conduction of vasomotor responses was studied in cremasteric arterioles using intravital microscopy and arterial pressure was measured telemetrically. Cx45 is transcriptionally expressed in VSM as detected by EGFP expression in SMC-specific Cx45-deficient mice (Cx45fl/fl:Nestin-Cre) but not in endothelial cells (Cx45fl/fl:TIE2-Cre). Moreover, EGFP was located at VSM cell borders in arterioles of transgenic mice carrying an EGFP-tagged Cx45. Expectedly, arteriolar conduction of dilations evoked by the endothelium-dependent agonist acetylcholine were not different between Cx45fl/fl:Nestin-Cre mice and controls carrying homozygously a floxed Cx45 gene (Cx45fl/fl). Surprisingly, the amplitude of locally initiated endothelium-independent constrictions (K(+)) and dilations (adenosine) declined similarly with distance in both genotypes indicating an intact VSM conduction pathway also in mice being deficient for Cx45 in VSM. Arterial pressure was not different between freely moving Cx45fl/fl and Cx45fl/fl:Nestin-Cre mice during day or night. We conclude that Cx45 is physiologically expressed in VSM, but not in EC in murine arterioles. However, Cx45 is dispensable for the conduction of vasomotor responses along these arterioles. Possibly, other Cx functionally replace the lack of Cx45 in VSM. The reported role of Cx45 in renin secretion does not seem to alter arterial pressure in freely moving mice."
https://openalex.org/W2136835089,"Pattern recognition receptors (PRR), like Toll-like receptors (TLR) and NOD-like receptors (NLR), are involved in the detection of microbial infections and tissue damage by cells of the innate immune system. Recently, we and others have demonstrated that TLR2 can additionally function as a costimulatory receptor on CD8 T cells. Here, we establish that the intracytosolic receptor NOD1 is expressed and functional in CD8 T cells. We show that C12-iEDAP, a synthetic ligand for NOD1, has a direct impact on both murine and human CD8 T cells, increasing proliferation and effector functions of cells activated via their T cell receptor (TCR). This effect is dependent on the adaptor molecule RIP2 and is associated with an increased activation of the NF-κB, JNK and p38 signaling pathways. Furthermore, we demonstrate that NOD1 stimulation can cooperate with TLR2 engagement on CD8 T cells to enhance TCR-mediated activation. Altogether our results indicate that NOD1 might function as an alternative costimulatory receptor in CD8 T cells. Our study provides new insights into the function of NLR in T cells and extends to NOD1 the recent concept that PRR stimulation can directly control T cell functions."
https://openalex.org/W1988204057,"Hormone regulation of ion transport in the kidney tubules is essential for fluid and electrolyte homeostasis in vertebrates. A large body of evidence has suggested that transporters and channels exist in multiprotein regulatory complexes; however, relatively little is known about the composition of these complexes or their assembly. The epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) in particular is tightly regulated by the salt-regulatory hormone aldosterone, which acts at least in part by increasing expression of the serine-threonine kinase SGK1. Here we show that aldosterone induces the formation of a 1.0-1.2-MDa plasma membrane complex, which includes ENaC, SGK1, and the ENaC inhibitor Nedd4-2, a key target of SGK1. We further show that this complex contains the PDZ domain-containing protein connector enhancer of kinase suppressor of Ras isoform 3 (CNK3). CNK3 physically interacts with ENaC, Nedd4-2, and SGK1; enhances the interactions among them; and stimulates ENaC function in a PDZ domain-dependent, aldosterone-induced manner. These results strongly suggest that CNK3 is a molecular scaffold, which coordinates the assembly of a multiprotein ENaC-regulatory complex and hence plays a central role in Na(+) homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W2043641875,"We have used selective inhibitors to determine whether the molecular chaperone heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) has an effect on both recombinant and native human P2X1 receptors. P2X1 receptor currents in HEK293 cells were reduced by ∼70-85% by the selective HSP90 inhibitor geldanamycin (2 μM, 20 min). This was associated with a speeding in the time course of desensitization as well as a reduction in cell surface expression. Imaging in real time of photoactivatable GFP-tagged P2X receptors showed that they are highly mobile. Geldanamycin almost abolished this movement for P2X1 receptors but had no effect on P2X2 receptor trafficking. P2X1/2 receptor chimeras showed that the intracellular N and C termini were involved in geldanamycin sensitivity. Geldanamycin also inhibited native P2X1 receptor-mediated responses. Platelet P2X1 receptors play an important role in hemostasis, contribute to amplification of signaling to a range of stimuli including collagen, and are novel targets for antithrombotic therapies. Platelet P2X1 receptor-, but not P2Y1 receptor-, mediated increases in intracellular calcium were reduced by 40-45% following HSP90 inhibition with geldanamycin or radicicol. Collagen stimulation leads to ATP release from platelets, and calcium increases to low doses of collagen were also reduced by ∼40% by the HSP90 inhibitors consistent with an effect on P2X1 receptors. These studies suggest that HSP90 inhibitors may be as effective as selective antagonists in regulating platelet P2X1 receptors, and their potential effects on hemostasis should be considered in clinical studies."
https://openalex.org/W2004790978,"Nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NAADP) is a ubiquitous second messenger providing a Ca(2+) trigger in a wide range of cell types. However, its metabolism is not well understood. Here, we demonstrate the presence of endogenous NAADP in HeLa cells. CD38, a promiscuous enzyme described to be involved in NAADP metabolism, was not detectable in HeLa cells. In cell-free extracts of HeLa cells, NAADP was degraded to nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide (NAAD). The enzyme was enriched in membranes (10,000 × g pellet) and displayed characteristics typical of alkaline phosphatase (AP), e.g. pH optimum at 8-9 and sensitivity to the inhibitors L-homoarginine and L-leucine. Importantly, NAADP at physiological concentrations (50-100 nM) was degraded to NAAD. Expression of AP isoenzymes was analyzed in HeLa cells. Based on the results together with inhibitor studies, the placental AP isoform emerged as the best candidate for NAADP degradation in HeLa cells. In contrast to HeLa cells, Jurkat T cells or HEK293 cells did not express any AP isoenzymes and did not display any NAADP 2'-phosphatase activity. Finally, the placental AP isoform was expressed heterologously in HEK293 cells, resulting in reconstitution of NAADP 2'-phosphatase activity in cell-free extracts. On the basis of the results, we provide evidence for AP as the metabolizing enzyme of NAADP in cells that do not express CD38."
https://openalex.org/W1967419778,"Nuclear factor erythroid-derived 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) is a master regulator of cellular antioxidant defense systems, and activation of this transcription factor is a promising strategy for protection of skin and other organs from environmental insults. To identify efficient Nrf2 activators in keratinocytes, we combined a chemical library screen with computer-based virtual screening. Among 14 novel Nrf2 activators, the most potent compound, a nitrophenyl derivative of 2-chloro-5-nitro-N-phenyl-benzamide, was characterized with regard to its molecular mechanism of action. This compound induced the expression of cytoprotective genes in keratinocytes isolated from wild-type but not from Nrf2-deficient mice. Most importantly, it showed low toxicity and protected primary human keratinocytes from UVB-induced cell death. Therefore, it represents a potential lead compound for the development of drugs for skin protection under stress conditions. Our study demonstrates that chemical library screening combined with advanced computational similarity searching is a powerful strategy for identification of bioactive compounds, and it points toward an innovative therapeutic approach against UVB-induced skin damage."
https://openalex.org/W2086730575,"Purpose To implement and characterize a fluorine-19 (19F) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technique and to test the hypothesis that the 19F MRI signal in steady state after intravenous injection of a perfluoro-15-crown-5 ether (PCE) emulsion may be exploited for angiography in a pre-clinical in vivo animal study. Materials and Methods In vitro at 9.4T, the detection limit of the PCE emulsion at a scan time of 10 min/slice was determined, after which the T1 and T2 of PCE in venous blood were measured. Permission from the local animal use committee was obtained for all animal experiments. 12 µl/g of PCE emulsion was intravenously injected in 11 mice. Gradient echo 1H and 19F images were obtained at identical anatomical levels. Signal-to-noise (SNR) and contrast-to-noise (CNR) ratios were determined for 33 vessels in both the 19F and 1H images, which was followed by vessel tracking to determine the vessel conspicuity for both modalities. Results In vitro, the detection limit was ∼400 µM, while the 19F T1 and T2 were 1350±40 and 25±2 ms. The 19F MR angiograms selectively visualized the vasculature (and the liver parenchyma over time) while precisely coregistering with the 1H images. Due to the lower SNR of 19F compared to 1H (17±8 vs. 83±49, p<0.001), the 19F CNR was also lower at 15±8 vs. 52±35 (p<0.001). Vessel tracking demonstrated a significantly higher vessel sharpness in the 19F images (66±11 vs. 56±12, p = 0.002). Conclusion 19F magnetic resonance angiography of intravenously administered perfluorocarbon emulsions is feasible for a selective and exclusive visualization of the vasculature in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2147606553,"Defining context specific requirements for proteins and pathways is a major challenge in the study of signal transduction. For example, the stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK) pathways are comprised of families of closely related transducers that are activated in a variety of tissues and contexts during development and organismal homeostasis. Consequently, redundant and pleiotropic effects have hampered a complete understanding of the individual contributions of transducers in distinct contexts. Here, we report on the function of a context-specific regulatory phosphorylation site, PXSP, in the Drosophila mixed lineage kinase protein, Slpr, a mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase (MAP3K) in the Jun Kinase (JNK) pathway. Genetic analysis of the function of non-phosphorylatable (PXAP) and phosphomimetic mutant (PXEP) Slpr transgenes in several distinct contexts revealed minimal effects in JNK-dependent tissue closure processes but differential requirements in heat stress response. In particular, PXAP expression resulted in sensitivity of adults to sustained heat shock, like p38 and JNK pathway mutants. In contrast, PXEP overexpression conferred some resistance. Indeed, phosphorylation of the PXSP motif is enriched under heat shock conditions and requires in part, the p38 kinases for the enrichment. These data suggest that coordination of signaling between p38 and Slpr serves to maintain JNK signaling during heat stress. In sum, we demonstrate a novel role for JNK signaling in the heat shock response in flies and identify a posttranslational modification on Slpr, at a conserved site among MAP3K mixed lineage kinase family members, which bolsters stress resistance with negligible effects on JNK-dependent developmental processes."
https://openalex.org/W2070922677,"Background Systematic reviews are increasingly informing policies in tuberculosis (TB) care and control. They may also be a source of questions for future research. As part of the process of developing the International Roadmap for TB Research, we did a systematic review of published systematic reviews on TB, to identify research priorities that are most frequently suggested in reviews. Methodology/Principal Findings We searched EMBASE, MEDLINE, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library for systematic reviews and meta-analyses on any aspect of TB published between 2005 and 2010. One reviewer extracted data and a second reviewer independently extracted data from a random subset of included studies. In total, 137 systematic reviews, with 141 research questions, were included in this review. We used the UK Health Research Classification System (HRCS) to help us classify the research questions and priorities. The three most common research topics were in the area of detection, screening and diagnosis of TB (32.6%), development and evaluation of treatments and therapeutic interventions (23.4%), and TB aetiology and risk factors (19.9%). The research priorities determined were mainly focused on the discovery and evaluation of bacteriological TB tests and drug-resistant TB tests and immunological tests. Other important topics of future research were genetic susceptibility linked to TB and disease determinants attributed to HIV/TB. Evaluation of drug treatments for TB, drug-resistant TB and HIV/TB were also frequently proposed research topics. Conclusions Systematic reviews are a good source of key research priorities. Findings from our survey have informed the development of the International Roadmap for TB Research by the TB Research Movement."
https://openalex.org/W1980037281,"Cell-free synthesis is an open and powerful tool for high-yield protein production in small reaction volumes predestined for high-throughput structural and functional analysis. Membrane proteins require addition of detergents for solubilization, liposomes, or nanodiscs. Hence, the number of parameters to be tested is significantly higher than with soluble proteins. Optimization is commonly done with respect to protein yield, yet without knowledge of the protein folding status. This approach contains a large inherent risk of ending up with non-functional protein. We show that fluorophore formation in C-terminal fusions with green fluorescent protein (GFP) indicates the folding state of a membrane protein in situ, i.e. within the cell-free reaction mixture, as confirmed by circular dichroism (CD), proteoliposome reconstitution and functional assays. Quantification of protein yield and in-gel fluorescence intensity imply suitability of the method for membrane proteins of bacterial, protozoan, plant, and mammalian origin, representing vacuolar and plasma membrane localization, as well as intra- and extracellular positioning of the C-terminus. We conclude that GFP-fusions provide an extension to cell-free protein synthesis systems eliminating the need for experimental folding control and, thus, enabling rapid optimization towards membrane protein quality."
https://openalex.org/W2009141581,"Multiple mechanisms have been proposed by which tumors induce T cell apoptosis to circumvent tumor immune-surveillance. Although sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase (SERCA) have long been known to regulate intracellular Ca(2+) homeostasis, few studies have examined the role of SERCA in processes of T lymphocyte survival and activation. In this context it remains largely unexplored as to how tumors jeopardize SERCA function to disable T cell-mediated anti-tumor immunity. Here, we show that human CD4(+) T cells in the presence of tumor conditions manifested an up-regulation of SERCA3 expression that resulted in development of endoplasmic reticulum stress leading to CD4(+) T cell apoptosis. Prostaglandin E(2) produced by the tumor cell plays a critical role in up-regulating SERCA3 by enhancing the binding of its transcription factor Sp1. Gene manipulation and pharmacological approaches further established that an increase in SERCA expression also resulted in subsequent inhibition of PKCα and -θ and retention of NFκB in the cytosol; however, down-modulation of SERCA3 expression by a dihydropyrimidone derivative, ethyl-4-(3-nitro)-phenyl-6-methyl-2-oxo-1,2,3,4-tetrahydropyrimidine-5 carboxylate (nifetepimine), protected the CD4(+) T cells from tumor-induced apoptosis. In fact, nifetepimine-mediated restoration of PKC activity resulted in nuclear translocation of p65NFκB, thereby ensuring its survival. Studies further undertaken in a tumor-bearing mice model revalidated the immunoprotective role of nifetepimine. Our present study thus strongly suggests that imbalance in cellular calcium homeostasis is an important factor leading to CD4(+) T cell death during cancer and holds promise that nifetepimine may have the potential to be used as an immunorestoring agent in cancer bearers."

https://openalex.org/W2085753678,"Mitochondrially mediated apoptosis is characterized by redistribution of proteins from mitochondria to cytoplasm following permeabilization of the outer mitochondrial membrane. We applied flow cytometry to quantify simultaneously the redistribution of two apoptogenic proteins, cytochrome c (cyt c) and Smac/DIABLO (Smac). Mammalian cells were treated with digitonin that selectively permeabilizes the plasma membrane. Following fixation, treated cells were infused successively with primary and secondary antibodies (the latter fluorescently tagged) enabling independent detection of cyt c and Smac. Digitonin-treated cells that retain cyt c or Smac in mitochondria generate strong fluorescence signals in flow cytometry. Cells in which cyt c or Smac have transited the outer mitochondrial membrane show greatly reduced fluorescence because the proteins are lost from the digitonin-permeabilized cells. Quantitative flow cytometry revealed that in 143B TK(-) cells treated with staurosporine, cyt c and Smac exit mitochondria asymmetrically, with cyt c redistribution preceding that of Smac. However, in HeLa cells likewise treated, cyt c and Smac exit mitochondria concurrently. Under other conditions of apoptotic induction, for example, 143B TK(-) cells treated with MT-21 (an apoptotic inducer that binds to the mitochondrial adenine nucleotide transporter), redistribution of Smac precedes that of cyt c. The various patterns of redistribution of these proteins were confirmed by immunocytochemical analysis and confocal microscopy. We conclude that flow cytometry can be employed effectively to quantify simultaneously the redistribution of cyt c and Smac from mitochondria to the cytosol. Moreover, differential redistribution of cyt c and Smac occurs under various conditions, thereby reflecting constraints on availability of these proteins to exit mitochondria after permeabilization of the outer membrane."

The glutaminase domain (residues 1–239) generates ammonia from glutamine, which is transferred through an 18-Å-long channel to the synthase domain (residues 249–608), where Fru6P is aminated and isomerized to GlcN6P or simply isomerized to d-glucose 6-phosphate (Glc6P). glucosamine-6-phosphate synthase dynamic light scattering 6-diazo-5-oxo-l-norleucine d-fructose 6-phosphate d-glucose 6-phosphate d-glucosamine 6-phosphate multiangle laser light scattering size exclusion chromatography 1,3-bis[tris(hydroxymethyl)methylamino]propane 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol refractive index hydrodynamic radius Protein Data Bank.

One synthase monomer consists of two topologically identical subdomains with a flavodoxin fold, suggesting that this domain has evolved through gene duplication (5Teplyakov A. Obmolova G.

Accordingly, the amino-terminal cysteine residue has a crucial role in catalysis, as demonstrated by results of chemical modification by specific covalent inhibitors (8Badet B. Vermoote P.

Thus, the first catalytic step at the glutaminase site involves the nucleophilic attack of the thiol group of Cys1 on the carboxamide group of glutamine to release ammonia and yield a γ-glutamyl-thioester intermediate. The structures of full-length E. coli GlmS alone, in complex with Fru6P, with Glc6P and 6-diazo-5-oxo-l-norleucine (DON, a glutamine analog), or with GlcN6P have previously been determined (12Teplyakov A.

Biol. 2009; 385: 653-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) has shed light on the conformational changes required for sugar isomerization as well as for the formation and opening of the ammonia channel. In the absence of ligands, the ammonia channel is not shaped. Fru6P binding leads to the formation of the channel, which remains closed until glutamine binds. Two particular loops in the synthase domain are crucial for catalysis: the C-loop (residues 600–608) and the His-loop from the synthase domain of the second monomer (residues 503*–505*); the former closes the synthase site once Fru6P is bound and is a major building block of the channel, whereas in the latter, Lys-503* is another constituent of the channel, and His-504* is responsible for sugar isomerization (supplemental Fig. S1). In the glutaminase domain, the Q-loop (residues 73–81) closes the glutaminase site upon glutamine binding and bears Trp-74, which acts as the gate of the channel (13Mouilleron S. Badet-Denisot M.A. Golinelli-Pimpaneau B. Glutamine binding opens the ammonia channel and activates glucosamine-6P synthase.J. Biol.

The synthase active site is actually located at the dimer interface formed by two synthase domains (supplemental Fig. S1A). The two glutaminase domains are located on opposite sides of the synthase dimer. Because the glutamine mimic DON has one extra carbon compared with the true substrate, the GlmS·Glc6P·DON structure represented only an approximation of the active GlmS form in complex with its two substrates (13Mouilleron S. Badet-Denisot M.A. Golinelli-Pimpaneau B. Glutamine binding opens the ammonia channel and activates glucosamine-6P synthase.J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 4404-4412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In an attempt to more closely approach this complex, we have determined the structure of the inactive C1A mutant of E. coli GlmS (C1A-GlmS), crystallized in the presence of Fru6P and Gln. Unexpectedly, the C1A-GlmS structure is organized as a hexamer, which led us to investigate the quaternary structure of E. coli wild-type GlmS in solution. We show that the enzyme is regulated by a morpheein-type allosteric mechanism, in which functional dimeric GlmS is in equilibrium with the inactive hexamer. The C1A mutant of GlmS was purified as described previously for the wild type protein (13Mouilleron S. Badet-Denisot M.A. Golinelli-Pimpaneau B. Glutamine binding opens the ammonia channel and activates glucosamine-6P synthase.J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 4404-4412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). After gel filtration on a Superdex 200 column, the protein was followed by SDS-PAGE, and the fractions corresponding to the main peak were pooled. The Bradford method was used to quantify the protein concentration. Crystals were grown at 18 °C in hanging drops by vapor diffusion. 5 μl of a solution containing 20 mg/ml protein, 10 mm Fru6P, and 10 mm glutamine in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 0.3 m NaCl was mixed with 5 μl of a 1-ml reservoir solution (22% PEG 3350, 0.2 ammonium acetate, 0.1 m HEPES, pH 7.0). Crystals grew to a size of 0.5 × 0.5 × 0.5 mm in a few days. After soaking for a few min in the same solution containing 28% PEG 3350 and 10% PEG 400, crystals were flash frozen in a cold nitrogen stream at 100 K. The DON-GlmS covalent complex was formed by incubating GlmS (9 mg/ml) with 10 mm DON and 2 mm Fru6P for 1 h in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, at room temperature. The removal of DON by dialysis at 4 °C against 50 mm MES, pH 6.0, 50 mm NaCl was monitored by following the 280 nm absorbance of the dialyzing buffer. Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry analysis indicates that all of the protein is modified in these conditions (data not shown). Diffraction data were collected on beamline ID14-EH2 at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (Grenoble) using a MarCCD detector. Data were processed with MOSFLM (20Leslie A.G.W. Powell H.R. Processing diffraction data with Mosflm.Evolving Methods for Macromolecular Crystallography. 2007; 245: 41-51Crossref Google Scholar) and SCALA (21Evans P. Scaling and assessment of data quality.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2006; 62: 72-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (3754) Google Scholar) (supplemental Table S1). The structure was solved by molecular replacement (supplemental Table S2), and refinement was carried out with PHENIX (22Adams P.D. Afonine P.V. Bunkóczi G. Chen V.B. Davis I.W. Echols N. Headd J.J.

Crystallogr. 2010; 66: 213-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (16496) Google Scholar) using tight noncrystallographic symmetry restraints. The hinge regions (residues 240–248) of the different monomers appear to be very flexible and were not fully modeled. The hydrodynamic radius was measured with a Wyatt DynaPro NanoStar. Various concentrations of wild-type GlmS in 50 mm MES, pH 6.0, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT were centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 30 min prior to measurements to remove dust and large aggregates. Samples (10 μl) were then pipetted into a 1-μl quartz cuvette. Measurements were performed at 25 °C in triplicate with at least three readings and an acquisition time of 8 s. The viscosity and refraction index of the solvent were set to 1.02 and 1.33, respectively. The hydrodynamic radius and polydispersity indexes were calculated by regularization using the averaged correlation functions in the Dynamics software (version 7.0.3.12) and size distribution by mass. Similar hydrodynamic radius (Rh) values were obtained in 50 mm Bistris propane, pH 7.0, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT. Wild type GlmS at various concentrations was analyzed by multiangle laser light scattering coupled (MALLS) with size exclusion chromatography (SEC) using a SEC-MALLS/UV/RI/quasi-elastic light scattering Wyatt instrument. 30 μl of protein solution was injected, and separation was performed using a Shimadzu liquid chromatography system (Prominence) equipped with a Bioseps 3000 column (Phenomenex) before light-scattering measurements. Isocratic elution was performed at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min in 50 mm MES, pH 6.0, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT at 25 °C. Light scattering was monitored using a mini DAWNTM TREOS system equipped with a quasi-elastic light scattering module (Wyatt Technology, Santa Barbara, CA) and refractometer (Optilab rEX, Wyatt Technology). The concentration of the molecule in solution was determined using a specific refractive index increment (dn/dc) of 0.183 at 658 nm. The absolute refractive index of the solution was measured using the refractive index detector. The light scattering detector was calibrated with toluene. The detector was controlled and the data were analyzed using the ASTRA V software (version 5.3.4.20; Wyatt Technology). Sedimentation velocity and equilibrium measurements were carried out using a Beckman Optima XL-A ultracentrifuge equipped with a UV-visible detection system using an AN60-Ti four-hole rotor and cells with two-channel 12-mm or 3-mm path length centerpieces. For sedimentation velocity measurements, 400 μl of protein was spun at 35,000 rpm (89,000 × g) and at 15 °C. Absorbance (at 280 or 290 nm) displacement profiles were recorded every 5 min. Data were analyzed with the program SEDFIT (model C(S)) (23Schuck P. Size distribution analysis of macromolecules by sedimentation velocity ultracentrifugation and Lamm equation modeling.Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 1606-1619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3056) Google Scholar). Blue native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed using NativePAGETM gels (Invitrogen) and dark blue or light blue cathode buffer containing 0.02 or 0.002% G-250, respectively (24Schägger H. Cramer W.A. von Jagow G.

Biochem. 1994; 217: 220-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (1038) Google Scholar). Proteins were transferred onto a PVDF membrane (Immobilon-P, Millipore) for 1 h (Mini Trans-blot, Bio-Rad). The membrane was saturated with TTBS (Tris-buffered saline, 0.1% Tween), 10% low fat milk overnight at 4 °C and then was soaked for 1 h with monoclonal antibody (0.5 μg/ml) in TTBS, 10% low fat milk at room temperature. After washing with TTBS, the membrane was incubated for 1 h at room temperature with a goat antiserum to rat IgG-HRP conjugated (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) in TTBS, 10% low fat milk (1:5000 dilution). The Western blot was revealed after a 5-min incubation in a solution containing the two substrates at a 1:1 ratio (Supersignal West Pico chemiluminescent substrate, Thermo Scientific) before exposure to x-ray film. Enzyme activity was measured following two established protocols (8Badet B. Vermoote P. Haumont P.Y. Lederer F. LeGoffic F. Glucosamine synthetase from Escherichia coli. Purification, properties, and glutamine-utilizing site location.Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 1940-1948Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). One enzyme unit is defined as 1 μmol of Glu or GlcN6P produced/min. GlmS (0.007–7.15 μm) was incubated at 15 °C in 100 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.2, 1 mm EDTA, 50 mm KCl, 70 mm glutamine, 70 mm Fru6P for 10 min before GlcN6P detection. The reaction was initiated by adding GlmS. The quantity of GlcN6P formed was measured using the colorimetric microplate Morgan-Elson assay. In addition, the amount of Glu produced was followed spectrophotometrically at 365 nm at 37 °C on an aliquot of the incubation mixture using the glutamate dehydrogenase-catalyzed appearance of acetylpyridine adenine dinucleotide (an NADH analog). The assay mixture contained 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.2, 1 mm EDTA, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm APAD, 13 units of glutamate dehydrogenase, 70 mm Fru6P, 70 mm Gln. Although the E. coli C1A-GlmS mutant was crystallized in the presence of Fru6P and Gln, cyclic Glc6P and Glu were observed at the synthase and glutaminase catalytic sites, respectively (supplemental Fig. S2). The C1A-GlmS mutant crystallized in space group H32 with huge unit cell parameters (a = b = 247 Å, c = 630 Å) and eight copies of the 67-kDa monomer in the asymmetric unit (supplemental Table S1). Therefore, the positioning of 16 domains (eight synthase and eight glutaminase domains) of GlmS (supplemental Table S2) as well as structure refinement were laborious tasks. The asymmetric unit of the C1A-GlmS structure contains three GlmS dimers (AB, CD, and GH) that are related by a noncrystallographic 3-fold symmetry and form one hexamer. In addition, another GlmS dimer (EF) forms, in turn, a hexamer with the equivalent dimers in two neighboring asymmetric units (Fig. 1A). The interface corresponding to the specific hexameric contacts covers 1170–1250 Å2, representing half of the GlmS dimer surface area (supplemental Table S3). This value agrees with that for oligomeric proteins, which ranges from 700 to 3000–10,000 Å2 (25Janin J. Miller S. Chothia C. Surface, subunit interfaces and interior of oligomeric proteins.J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 204: 155-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar). Therefore, the C1A-GlmS structure contains two copies of a hexamer constituted by trimers of dimers. The solvation free energy gains upon formation of the two hexamers, and the free energies of hexamer dissociation were estimated from the solvent-accessible surface area with the program PISA (Protein Interfaces, Surfaces, and Assemblies), which is appropriate to identify oligomeric states (supplemental Table S3) (26Krissinel E. Henrick K. Inference of macromolecular assemblies from crystalline state.J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 372: 774-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (6801) Google Scholar). Although more than 10% errors in PISA results at free energies lower than 30 kcal/mol are expected (27Krissinel E. Crystal contacts as nature's docking solutions.J. Comput. Chem. 2010; 31: 133-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar), the large negative solvation free energy gain upon formation of the hexameric assembly and the positive free energy difference between the dissociated and associated states suggest that the hexameric state exists in solution. The calculated free energy of dissociation of the dimeric assembly is similar whether the glutaminase domains are taken into account or not, but that of the hexameric assembly becomes negative when they are not included in the calculation (supplemental Table S3). Indeed, the dimeric contacts are formed almost exclusively by the synthase domains, whereas the glutaminase domains are involved in the stabilization of the hexamer (Fig. 1B). The region preceding the C-loop (residues 589–599), the linker (residues 245–250), and Arg-539 at the extremity of helix CF (residues 520–540) are crucial elements involved in the formation of the hexameric contacts (Fig. 1, C and D). Wild-type GlmS in complex with Fru6P or in complex with Glc6P and DON crystallized as a dimer (13Mouilleron S. Badet-Denisot M.A. Golinelli-Pimpaneau B. Glutamine binding opens the ammonia channel and activates glucosamine-6P synthase.J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 4404-4412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). However, both the wild-type full-length protein, either alone or in complex with cyclic GlcN6P (15Mouilleron S. Badet-Denisot M.A. Golinelli-Pimpaneau B.

Badet-Denisot M.A. Badet B. The mechanism of sugar phosphate isomerization by glucosamine-6-phosphate synthase.Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 596-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) were shown to crystallize in the H32 space group but with different cell parameters compared with the C1A-GlmS structure. In these cases, the cell parameters (a = b = 144 Å, c = 173 Å) were very similar, and the asymmetric unit contained one GlmS monomer. Although not pointed out previously, a hexamer can be formed in these structures by packing six monomers belonging to neighboring asymmetric units using the crystallographic symmetry. The hexamer formed by the synthase domains in these structures of wild-type GlmS superimposes well with that of the C1A-GlmS structure, especially when region 417–429, which contains a flexible loop, is omitted (Fig. 2A). Superposition of one synthase domain of one monomer of the hexameric C1A-GlmS structure with one of the dimeric GlmS·Fru6P structure reveals that helix CF adopts different conformations in the two structures (Fig. 2B). The shift of helix CF by one helix turn in the C1A-GlmS structure, compared with the dimeric GlmS·Fru6P structure, was previously observed in the structures of the wild-type enzyme crystallized in space group H32 (15Mouilleron S. Badet-Denisot M.A. Golinelli-Pimpaneau B. Ordering of C-terminal loop and glutaminase domains of glucosamine-6-phosphate synthase promotes sugar ring opening and formation of the ammonia channel.J. Mol. Biol. 2008; 377: 1174-1185Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). It is accompanied by a major conformational change of Lys-503* from the His-loop, whose side chain constitutes one of the building blocks of the ammonia channel in the dimeric structure (Fig. 2C). Thus, because of the shift of helix CF, the ammonia channel is not formed in the structures of GlmS alone or in complex with GlcN6P; nor is it formed in the C1A-mutant structure. Interestingly, the active dimer of wild-type GlmS, as observed in the dimeric GlmS·Fru6P structure, cannot assemble as a hexamer because of steric hindrance between the glutaminase domains (Fig. 2D). However, the synthase domains of the active dimer can be superimposed on the hexamer without overlapping, which indicates that the synthase domains with helix CF in both positions are able to form a hexamer. The glutaminase domains appear to be highly dynamic in the hexameric structures, as shown by the absence of electron density corresponding to these domains in the structures of wild-type GlmS alone or in complex with GlcN6P (15Mouilleron S. Badet-Denisot M.A. Golinelli-Pimpaneau B. Ordering of C-terminal loop and glutaminase domains of glucosamine-6-phosphate synthase promotes sugar ring opening and formation of the ammonia channel.J.

We aimed to determine the diagnostic performance of human observers to visually evaluate COPD presence on CT images, in comparison to automated evaluation using quantitative CT measures.This study was approved by the Dutch Ministry of Health and the institutional review board. All participants provided written informed consent. We studied 266 heavy smokers enrolled in a lung cancer screening trial. All subjects underwent volumetric inspiratory and expiratory chest computed tomography (CT). Pulmonary function testing was used as the reference standard for COPD. We evaluated the diagnostic performance of eight observers and one automated model based on quantitative CT measures.The prevalence of COPD in the study population was 44% (118/266), of whom 62% (73/118) had mild disease. The diagnostic accuracy was 74.1% in the automated evaluation, and ranged between 58.3% and 74.3% for the visual evaluation of CT images. The positive predictive value was 74.3% in the automated evaluation, and ranged between 52.9% and 74.7% for the visual evaluation. Interobserver variation was substantial, even within the subgroup of experienced observers. Agreement within observers yielded kappa values between 0.28 and 0.68, regardless of the level of expertise. The agreement between the observers and the automated CT model showed kappa values of 0.12-0.35.Visual evaluation of COPD presence on chest CT images provides at best modest accuracy and is associated with substantial interobserver variation. Automated evaluation of COPD subjects using quantitative CT measures appears superior to visual evaluation by human observers."
https://openalex.org/W2032963658,"NPM1 is a ubiquitously expressed nucleolar phosphoprotein, the gene for which maps to chromosome 5q35 in close proximity to a commonly deleted region associated with (del)5q, a type of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). This region is also a frequent target of deletions in de novo and therapy-related MDS/acute myeloid leukemia. Previous studies have shown that Npm1+/− mice develop an MDS-like disease that transforms to acute myeloid leukemia over time. To better understand the mechanism by which NPM1 haploinsufficiency causes an MDS phenotype, we generated factor-dependent myeloid cell lines from the bone marrow of Npm1+/+ and Npm1+/− mice and demonstrated compromised neutrophil-specific gene expression in the MNPM1+/− cells. We attribute these observations to increased levels of the shorter, dominant negative leukemogenic isoform (p30) of CCAAT enhancer-binding protein α (C/EBPα). We show that this increase is caused, in part, by elevated levels of the activated translation initiation factor eIF4E, overexpression of which also increases translation of C/EBPαp30 in HEK293 cells. In a positive feedback loop, eIF4E expression is further elevated both at the mRNA and protein levels by C/EBPαp30 but not by the full-length C/EBPαp42. Re-expression of C/EBPαp42 or NPM1 but not C/EBPαp30 in MNPM1+/− cells partially rescues the myeloid phenotype. Our observations suggest that the aberrant feed-forward pathway that keeps eIF4E and C/EBPαp30 elevated in NPM1+/− cells contributes to the MDS phenotype associated with NPM1 deficiency. NPM1 is a ubiquitously expressed nucleolar phosphoprotein, the gene for which maps to chromosome 5q35 in close proximity to a commonly deleted region associated with (del)5q, a type of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). This region is also a frequent target of deletions in de novo and therapy-related MDS/acute myeloid leukemia. Previous studies have shown that Npm1+/− mice develop an MDS-like disease that transforms to acute myeloid leukemia over time. To better understand the mechanism by which NPM1 haploinsufficiency causes an MDS phenotype, we generated factor-dependent myeloid cell lines from the bone marrow of Npm1+/+ and Npm1+/− mice and demonstrated compromised neutrophil-specific gene expression in the MNPM1+/− cells. We attribute these observations to increased levels of the shorter, dominant negative leukemogenic isoform (p30) of CCAAT enhancer-binding protein α (C/EBPα). We show that this increase is caused, in part, by elevated levels of the activated translation initiation factor eIF4E, overexpression of which also increases translation of C/EBPαp30 in HEK293 cells. In a positive feedback loop, eIF4E expression is further elevated both at the mRNA and protein levels by C/EBPαp30 but not by the full-length C/EBPαp42. Re-expression of C/EBPαp42 or NPM1 but not C/EBPαp30 in MNPM1+/− cells partially rescues the myeloid phenotype. Our observations suggest that the aberrant feed-forward pathway that keeps eIF4E and C/EBPαp30 elevated in NPM1+/− cells contributes to the MDS phenotype associated with NPM1 deficiency."
https://openalex.org/W2139742430,"Signaling via the type 4-melanocortin receptor (MC4R) is an important determinant of body weight in mice and humans, where loss of function mutations lead to significant obesity. Humans with mutations in the MC4R experience an increase in lean mass. However, the simultaneous accrual of fat mass in such individuals may contribute to this effect via mechanical loading. We therefore examined the relationship of fat mass and lean mass in mice lacking the type-4 melanocortin receptor (MC4RKO). We demonstrate that MC4RKO mice display increased lean body mass. Further, this is not dependent on changes in adipose mass, as MC4RKO mice possess more lean body mass than diet-induced obese (DIO) wild type mice with equivalent fat mass. To examine potential sources of the increased lean mass in MC4RKO mice, bone mass and strength were examined in MC4RKO mice. Both parameters increase with age in MC4RKO mice, which likely contributes to increases in lean body mass. We functionally characterized the increased lean mass in MC4RKO mice by examining their capacity for treadmill running. MC4R deficiency results in a decrease in exercise performance. No changes in the ratio of oxidative to glycolytic fibers were seen, however MC4RKO mice demonstrate a significantly reduced heart rate, which may underlie their impaired exercise performance. The reduced exercise capacity we report in the MC4RKO mouse has potential clinical ramifications, as efforts to control body weight in humans with melanocortin deficiency may be ineffective due to poor tolerance for physical activity."
https://openalex.org/W2000077588,"Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a sensorimotor neurological disorder characterized by an irresistible urge to move the legs. It has been reported that RLS patients show cognitive deficits, presumably due to hyperactivity causing loss of attention, or malfunctions in the frontal region resulting from sleep deprivation. However, the mechanism underlying cognitive deficits in RLS patients is mostly unknown. As an effort to clarifying this, we investigated the differences in neural activity and phase synchrony between healthy controls and RLS patients during cognitive task performances.Seventeen female drug-naive RLS patients were enrolled in the study, and an age-matched group of thirteen healthy female volunteers served as controls. Multichannel event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded from RLS patients and normal controls while performing a visual oddball task. In addition to conventional analyses of ERP waveforms and spectra, interregional gamma-band phase synchrony (GBPS) was investigated to observe the differences in interregional neural synchronies between normal and RLS patient groups. Strong GBPS was observed primarily between anterior and posterior regions along the midline for both groups. Along with significant reduction and delay of P300 ERP and induced gamma-band activity (GBA), the GBPS was considerably decreased in RLS patients compared to normal subjects, especially at frontal region.Overall, our results support that cognitive dysfunction in RLS patients is associated with reduced interregional neural synchrony as well as alterations in local neural activity."
https://openalex.org/W2031153595,"The transition of plant growth from vegetative to reproductive phases is one of the most important and dramatic events during the plant life cycle. In Arabidopsis thaliana, flowering promotion involves at least four genetically defined regulatory pathways, including the photoperiod-dependent, vernalization-dependent, gibberellin-dependent, and autonomous promotion pathways. Among these regulatory pathways, the vernalization-dependent and autonomous pathways are integrated by the expression of FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC), a negative regulator of flowering; however, the upstream regulation of this locus has not been fully understood. The SYP22 gene encodes a vacuolar SNARE protein that acts in vacuolar and endocytic trafficking pathways. Loss of SYP22 function was reported to lead to late flowering in A. thaliana plants, but the mechanism has remained completely unknown. In this study, we demonstrated that the late flowering phenotype of syp22 was due to elevated expression of FLC caused by impairment of the autonomous pathway. In addition, we investigated the DOC1/BIG pathway, which is also suggested to regulate vacuolar/endosomal trafficking. We found that elevated levels of FLC transcripts accumulated in the doc1-1 mutant, and that syp22 phenotypes were exaggerated with a double syp22 doc1-1 mutation. We further demonstrated that the elevated expression of FLC was suppressed by ara6-1, a mutation in the gene encoding plant-unique Rab GTPase involved in endosomal trafficking. Our results indicated that vacuolar and/or endocytic trafficking is involved in the FLC regulation of flowering time in A. thaliana."
https://openalex.org/W2083042382,"Passive transfer studies using monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies in the macaque model have been valuable for determining conditions for antibody protection against immunodeficiency virus challenge. Most studies have employed hybrid simian/human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV) challenge in conjunction with neutralizing human monoclonal antibodies. Passive protection against SIV, particularly the pathogenic prototype virus SIVmac239, has been little studied because of the paucity of neutralizing antibodies to this virus. Here, we show that the antibody-like molecule CD4-IgG2 potently neutralizes SIVmac239 in vitro. When administered by an osmotic pump to maintain concentrations given the short half-life of CD4-IgG2 in macaques, the molecule provided sterilizing immunity/protection against high-dose mucosal viral challenge to a high proportion of animals (5/7 at a 200 mg dose CD4-IgG2 and 3/6 at a 20 mg dose) at serum concentrations below 1.5 µg/ml. The neutralizing titers of such sera were predicted to be very low and indeed sera at a 1∶4 dilution produced no neutralization in a pseudovirus assay. Macaque anti-human CD4 titers did develop weakly at later time points in some animals but were not associated with the level of protection against viral challenge. The results show that, although SIVmac239 is considered a highly pathogenic virus for which vaccine-induced T cell responses in particular have provided limited benefit against high dose challenge, the antibody-like CD4-IgG2 molecule at surprisingly low serum concentration affords sterilizing immunity/protection to a majority of animals."
https://openalex.org/W2022731417,"In vertebrates, polysialic acid (PSA) is typically added to the neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) in the Golgi by PST or STX polysialyltransferase. PSA promotes plasticity, and its enhanced expression by viral delivery of the PST or STX gene has been shown to promote cellular processes that are useful for repair of the injured adult nervous system. Here we demonstrate a new strategy for PSA induction on cells involving addition of a purified polysialyltransferase from Neisseria meningitidis (PST(Nm)) to the extracellular environment. In the presence of its donor substrate (CMP-Neu5Ac), PST(Nm) synthesized PSA directly on surfaces of various cell types in culture, including Chinese hamster ovary cells, chicken DF1 fibroblasts, primary rat Schwann cells, and mouse embryonic stem cells. Similarly, injection of PST(Nm) and donor in vivo was able to produce PSA in different adult brain regions, including the cerebral cortex, striatum, and spinal cord. PSA synthesis by PST(Nm) requires the presence of the donor CMP-Neu5Ac, and the product could be degraded by the PSA-specific endoneuraminidase-N. Although PST(Nm) was able to add PSA to NCAM, most of its product was attached to other cell surface proteins. Nevertheless, the PST(Nm)-induced PSA displayed the ability to attenuate cell adhesion, promote neurite outgrowth, and enhance cell migration as has been reported for endogenous PSA-NCAM. Polysialylation by PST(Nm) occurred in vivo in less than 2.5 h, persisted in tissues, and then decreased within a few weeks. Together these characteristics suggest that a PST(Nm)-based approach may provide a valuable alternative to PST gene therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2084511688,"The γ-secretase complex is an appealing drug target when the therapeutic strategy is to alter amyloid-β peptide (Aβ) aggregation in Alzheimer disease. γ-Secretase is directly involved in Aβ formation and determines the pathogenic potential of Aβ by generating the aggregation-prone Aβ42 peptide. Because γ-secretase mediates cleavage of many substrates involved in cell signaling, such as the Notch receptor, it is crucial to sustain these pathways while altering the Aβ secretion. A way of avoiding interference with the physiological function of γ-secretase is to use γ-secretase modulators (GSMs) instead of inhibitors of the enzyme. GSMs modify the Aβ formation from producing the amyloid-prone Aβ42 variant to shorter and less amyloidogenic Aβ species. The modes of action of GSMs are not fully understood, and even though the pharmacology of GSMs has been thoroughly studied regarding Aβ generation, knowledge is lacking about their effects on other substrates, such as Notch. Here, using immunoprecipitation followed by MALDI-TOF MS analysis, we found that two novel, second generation GSMs modulate both Notch β and Aβ production. Moreover, by correlating S3-specific Val-1744 cleavage of Notch intracellular domain (Notch intracellular domain) to total Notch intracellular domain levels using immunocytochemistry, we also demonstrated that Notch intracellular domain is not modulated by the compounds. Interestingly, two well characterized, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug), R-flurbiprofen and sulindac sulfide, affect only Aβ and not Notch β formation, indicating that second generation GSMs and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug-based GSMs have different modes of action regarding Notch processing."
https://openalex.org/W1975167276,"The HIV vaccine strategy that, to date, generated immune protection consisted of a prime-boost regimen using a canarypox vector and an HIV envelope protein with alum, as shown in the RV144 trial. Since the efficacy was weak, and previous HIV vaccine trials designed to generate antibody responses failed, we hypothesized that generation of T cell responses would result in improved protection. Thus, we tested the immunogenicity of a similar envelope-based vaccine using a mouse model, with two modifications: a clade C CN54gp140 HIV envelope protein was adjuvanted by the TLR9 agonist IC31®, and the viral vector was the vaccinia strain NYVAC-CN54 expressing HIV envelope gp120. The use of IC31® facilitated immunoglobulin isotype switching, leading to the production of Env-specific IgG2a, as compared to protein with alum alone. Boosting with NYVAC-CN54 resulted in the generation of more robust Th1 T cell responses. Moreover, gp140 prime with IC31® and alum followed by NYVAC-CN54 boost resulted in the formation and persistence of central and effector memory populations in the spleen and an effector memory population in the gut. Our data suggest that this regimen is promising and could improve the protection rate by eliciting strong and long-lasting humoral and cellular immune responses."
https://openalex.org/W2100096115,"Background Yersinia pestis causes severe disease in natural rodent hosts, but mild to inapparent disease in certain rodent predators such as dogs. Y. pestis initiates infection in susceptible hosts by parasitizing and multiplying intracellularly in local macrophages prior to systemic dissemination. Thus, we hypothesize that Y. pestis disease severity may depend on the degree to which intracellular Y. pestis overcomes the initial host macrophage imposed stress. Methodology/Principal Findings To test this hypothesis, the progression of in vitro infection by Y. pestis KIM62053.1+ of mouse splenic and RAW264.7 tissue culture macrophages and dog peripheral blood-derived and DH82 tissue culture macrophages was studied using microscopy and various parameters of infection. The study showed that during the early stage of infection, intracellular Y. pestis assumed filamentous cellular morphology with multiple copies of the genome per bacterium in both mouse and dog macrophages. Later, in mouse macrophages, the infection elicited spacious vacuolar extension of Yersinia containing vacuoles (YCV), and the filamentous Y. pestis reverted to coccobacillary morphology with genomic equivalents approximately equaling colony forming units. In contrast, Y. pestis infected dog macrophages did not show noticeable extension of YCV, and intracellular Y. pestis retained the filamentous cellular morphology for the entire experiment in DH82 cells or were killed by blood-derived macrophages. In addition, during the later stage of infection, Y. pestis infected mouse macrophages exhibited cell lysis whereas dog macrophages did not. Conclusion/Significance Overall, these results support our hypothesis that Y. pestis in mouse macrophages can overcome the initial intracellular stress necessary for subsequent systemic infection. However, in dogs, failure of Y. pestis to overcome macrophage imposed stress may result in mild or in apparent disease in dogs."

The largest component of HVA channels, α1-subunit (CaVα1), contains the ion conduction pore, the voltage sensor, and multiple intracellular domains that regulate calcium influx and provide interaction sites for regulatory proteins. Two subfamilies of HVA CaVα1 are recognized as follows: CaV1.x or L-type channels and CaV2.x, also referred as to neuronal channels (CaV2.1 encoding P/Q-type; CaV2.2 encoding N-type; and CaV2.3 encoding R-type) (3Catterall W.A. Structure and regulation of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels.Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 521-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (1945) Google Scholar). Following strong depolarization and calcium permeation, HVA channels enter into an inactivated nonconducting state that constrains the amount of calcium influx and protects the cells from the cytotoxic effects of an excessive calcium rise. Inactivation of HVA channels is triggered by both calcium increase and prolonged membrane depolarization, referred as to calcium-dependent inactivation and voltage-dependent inactivation (VDI), respectively (4Cens T.

The prevalent view is that anchoring of β2a to the membrane slows down channel inactivation by immobilizing the inactivation machinery and therefore preventing it from occluding the conduction pathway (19Restituito S.

However, it was shown later that the slow inactivation-conferring phenotype can be manifested in nonmembrane-anchored CaVβ, suggesting that this is not the only mechanism that contributes to slowing down VDI (7Qin N. Olcese R. Zhou J. Cabello O.A. Birnbaumer L. Stefani E. Identification of a second region of the β-subunit involved in regulation of calcium channel inactivation.Am. J.

Chem. 2004; 279: 3793-3800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The same studies also implicate the linker joining the SH3 and GK domains in VDI regulation. Among the possible mechanisms that come to mind is that the linker contributes to anchoring the β-subunit to the plasma membrane, so that it interacts directly with the inactivation machinery or modifies the interaction of the SH3-GK core with the channel protein. Here, we used Xenopus oocytes to study the effect of different CaVβ derivatives on VDI and tsA-201 cells to investigate the intracellular localization of these protein constructs. The rationale is that although mammalian cells are well suited for confocal microscopy, they are too small for protein injection. The opposite is true for Xenopus oocytes. Moreover, expression of CaVα1 in mammalian cells is sensitive to the co-expression of the β-subunit. In contrast, in Xenopus oocytes association with the CaVβ does not seem to be a requirement for the pore-forming subunit to reach the plasma membrane. In fact, CaV2.3 bearing a mutation in the primary β-subunit anchoring site expresses as well as wild-type channels (24Berrou L. Klein H. Bernatchez G. Parent L.

Using this approach, we identified within the linker region of the β-subunit a positively charged segment, 12 amino acids long, that slows down inactivation without conferring membrane anchoring to the protein. The effect of this linker segment was abolished by neutralizing the charged residues and is masked by the upstream linker region but not by the other variable (N and C terminus) segments of the protein. We propose the existence of electrostatic interactions between the polybasic linker segment and the channel inactivation machinery itself or its regulatory components that contribute to the inhibition of VDI by the β2a-subunit. The exposition of this segment appears to be regulated by the palmitoylated state of the N terminus of β2a. cDNA encoding all CaVβ2a (Swiss-Prot accession number Q8VGC3-2, described elsewhere (27Hidalgo P.

Proteins were concentrated to 0.7–5.0 mg/ml by ultrafiltration, fast frozen, and stored at −80 °C until use. For confocal fluorescence microscopy, the same cDNAs encoding for the different CaVβ2a derivatives used for protein expression were subcloned into pcDNA 3.1 vector and fused to YFP. All constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. The human form of the CaV2.3 subunit (Swiss-Prot accession number Q15878) used in this study has been previously described (28Schneider T. Wei X.

For Western blot analysis of β2a-derivative protein constructs, five noninjected control oocytes and five oocytes were injected with purified His-β2a protein constructs 5 days before recording. Oocytes were transferred to a 1.5-ml tube and homogenized by pipetting up and down with 50 μl of lysis buffer (100 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.2), supplemented with 0.1% Triton X-100 and protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma). After incubation on ice for 15 min (15 s vortexing every 5 min), the samples were centrifuged twice at 12,000 rpm in a microcentrifuge for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was diluted with 5× SDS loading buffer and loaded on a 12% acrylamide gel. After SDS-PAGE, the proteins were electrically transferred to ECL Plex membranes (GE Healthcare) for 1 h. Membranes were blocked using 3% BSA in TBS buffer (10 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.5) and incubated with primary antibody diluted according to the manufacturer's instructions in TBS supplemented with 1% BSA. Three primary antibodies were used depending on the β-construct to be detected as follows: anti-calcium channel β2-subunit antibody (Sigma) when the C terminus was present (β2a C3S,C4S, β2a SH3-PBLK-GK + CT, and β2a ΔPBLK), anti-CACNB2 antibody (Abcam) only when the full linker sequence was present (β2a SH3-LK-GK), and anti-Xpress antibody (Invitrogen) for the rest of the constructs (β2a SH3-PBLK-GK, β2a SH3-PBLK-GK + ΝΤC3S,C4S, β2a SH3-PBLKAla-GK, and β2a SH3-GK). Immunodetection was carried out using HRP-conjugated secondary antibody (Pierce Antibodies, Thermo Scientific) diluted 1:40,000 to 1:60,000 and a chemiluminescent detection kit (SuperSignal West Femto Chemiluminescent Substrate, Thermo Scientific). Membranes were exposed between 15 and 60 s into a GeneGnome chemiluminescence imaging system (SYNGENE). The cRNA encoding for CaV2.3 α1-subunit was synthesized using a capping RNA transcription kit (mMESSAGE mMACHINETM, Ambion) and injected into Xenopus laevis oocytes, as reported previously (30Neely A. Garcia-Olivares J. Voswinkel S. Horstkott H. Hidalgo P. Folding of active calcium channel β(1b)-subunit by size-exclusion chromatography and its role on channel function.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 21689-21694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). To minimize cRNA degradation, the protein was injected 1 h after cRNA injection, using the same method as for cRNA injection. Electrophysiological recordings were performed using the cut-open oocyte technique (31Taglialatela M. Toro L. Stefani E. Novel voltage clamp to record small, fast currents from ion channels expressed in Xenopus oocytes.Biophys. J. 1992; 61: 78-82Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) with a CA-1B amplifier (Dagan Corp., Minneapolis, MN), as described previously (27Hidalgo P. Gonzalez-Gutierrez G. Garcia-Olivares J. Neely A. The α-β subunit interaction that modulates calcium channel activity is reversible and requires a competent α-interaction domain.J. Biol.

Data acquisition and analysis were performed using the pCLAMP system and software (Axon Instruments Inc., Foster City, CA). Linear components were eliminated by P/−4 pre-pulse protocol. All experiments were carried out in at least two batches of X. laevis oocytes from two different frogs. The external solution contained (in mm), 10 Ba2+, 96 n-methylglucamine, and 10 HEPES, and the internal solution contained 120 n-methylglucamine, 10 EGTA, and 10 HEPES. Both solutions were adjusted to pH 7.0 with methanesulfonic acid. Live cell confocal imaging was carried out with a ×40 oil immersion objective on a Leica inverted confocal microscope equipped with an argon ion laser using transiently transfected tsA201 cells. Cells were cultivated on a glass coverslip and imaged 18–48 h after transfection using LipofectamineTM (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For excitation of YFP, the 514-nm laser was used, and the emitted light was monitored between 520 and 560 nm. β2a-YFP has been described elsewhere (32Miranda-Laferte E. Gonzalez-Gutierrez G.

Instead of injecting the cRNA encoding for CaVα1 and CaVβ, i.e. the widespread strategy to study β-modulation of calcium channels, we injected β-derived constructs as purified proteins together with the cRNA encoding the α1-subunit (27Hidalgo P.

With this strategy we were able to study isolated domains and short constructs of β2a that are not functional when injected as cRNA (29Gonzalez-Gutierrez G. Miranda-Laferte E. Nothmann D. Schmidt S. Neely A. Hidalgo P. The guanylate kinase domain of the β-subunit of voltage-gated calcium channels suffices to modulate gating.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

To confirm the integrity and folding of the recombinant proteins, all constructs used in this study were subjected to SDS-reducing PAGE and size-exclusion chromatography (supplemental Fig. S3). Fig. 1 illustrates the strategy followed in this study to investigate the effect of different β-subunit derivatives on VDI of R-type CaV2.3 channels. Protein constructs were injected into Xenopus oocytes 1 h later than the cRNA encoding the α1-subunit, so as to avoid RNA degradation. Electrophysiological recordings were performed 5–6 days after cRNA/protein injection, corresponding to the time necessary for the α1-subunit to be assembled in the plasma membrane (Fig. 1A). As observed from earlier co-injection experiments of cRNA encoding α1 and β-subunits, β2a inhibits VDI of CaV2.3 channels expressed in Xenopus oocytes, and β3xo stimulates it (8Jones L.P. Wei S.K.

Kluwer Academic/Plenum Publishers, New York2005: 95-112Google Scholar). This effect is reflected in much greater values of T0.5 for CaV2.3/β2a channel complexes than CaV2.3/β3xo and in steady-state inactivation curves, exhibiting opposing voltage shifts with respect to the CaV2.3 α1-subunit alone (Fig. 1, B and C, and Table 1). see Equation 1,I(V)=Imax•(Ires+(1-Ires)1+ez1FRT(Vm-V2)•(1+ez2FRT(Vm-V2)))(Eq. 1) where Imax is the current at peak; Ires is the noninactivating current; F is the Faraday's constant; R the universal constant of gases; t is temperature (298 K), and Vm is the membrane voltage. V1, V2, z1, and z2 are the parameters defining each Boltzmann component. V½ is then obtained by solving numerically I(V) = Imax/2. Ires corresponds to the fraction of channels that do not inactivate at extreme positive voltages. Moreover, by shifting the steady-state inactivation curve to more depolarizing potentials, β2a also induces a residual noninactivating current component that is unique to this isoform (Fig. 1C). In contrast to their differences in the channel inactivation curve, β2a and β3xo shift the activation curve to the same extent and direction (Fig. 1D and supplemental Table S1). This change in the midpoint of the activation curve toward more hyperpolarizing potentials is the signature of β-subunit modulation of HVA calcium channels (33Olcese R. Neely A. Qin N. Wei X.

https://openalex.org/W2035680076,"22Rv1 is a common prostate cancer cell line used in xenograft mouse experiments as well as in vitro cell culture assays to study aspects of prostate cancer tumorigenesis. Recently, this cell line was shown to harbor multiple copies of a gammaretrovirus, called XMRV, integrated in its genome. While the original prostate cancer xenograft CWR22 is free of any retrovirus, subsequently generated cell lines 22Rv1 and CWR-R1, carry this virus and additionally shed infectious gammaretroviral particles in their supernatant. Although XMRV most likely was generated by recombination events in cell culture this virus has been demonstrated to infect human cells in vitro and 22Rv1 as well as CWR-R1 cells are now considered biosafety 2 reagents. Here, we demonstrate that 22Rv1 cells with reduced retroviral transcription show reduced tumor angiogenesis and increased necrosis of the primary tumor derived from xenografted cells in scid mice when compared to the parental cell line. The presence of XMRV transcripts significantly increases secretion of osteopontin (OPN), CXCL14, IL13 and TIMP2 in 22Rv1 cells. Furthermore, these data are supported by in vitro cell invasion and differentiation assays. Collectively, our data suggest that the presence of XMRV transcripts at least partially contributes to 22Rv1 characteristics observed in vitro and in vivo with regard to migration, invasion and tumor angiogenesis. We propose that data received with 22Rv1 cells or equivalent cells carrying xenotropic gammaretroviruses should be carefully controlled including other prostate cancer cell lines tested for viral sequences."
https://openalex.org/W2033190042,"Single-cell pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (SCPFGE) with dual electrode pairs was developed to detect the early stage of DNA fragmentation in human sperm. The motile sperm were purified by the commonly used density-gradient centrifugation technique and subsequent swim-up. The sperm were embedded in a thin film of agarose containing bovine trypsin (20 µg/mL) and were then lysed. Prior to SCPFGE, proteolysis of DNA-binding components, such as protamine and the nuclear matrix was essential to separate the long chain fibers from the fibrous and granular fragments derived from a single nucleus. The overall electrophoretic profiles elucidated the course of DNA fragmentation. A few large fibrous fragments were observed at the beginning of the process, however, as the fragmentation advanced, the long chain fibers decreased and shortened, and, conversely, the granular fragments increased until finally almost all the DNA was shredded. Although the ejaculate contained sperm with heterogeneous stages, the purified motile sperm exhibited several dozens of uniformly elongated fibers arising from the tangled DNA at the origin, whereas a part of these fibers gave rise to fibrous fragments beyond the tip of the elongated fibers, and their numbers and sizes varied among the sperm. Conventional intra-cytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) usually depends on intra-operative light microscopic observation to select a sperm for injection. The present results revealed that sperm motility could not give full assurance of DNA integrity. SCPFGE is likely to serve an important role in the preoperative differential diagnosis to determine the competence of the sperm population provided for injection."
https://openalex.org/W2059065861,"Background The composition vector (CV) method has been proved to be a reliable and fast alignment-free method to analyze large COI barcoding data. In this study, we modify this method for analyzing multi-gene datasets for plant DNA barcoding. The modified method includes an adjustable-weighted algorithm for the vector distance according to the ratio in sequence length of the candidate genes for each pair of taxa. Methodology/Principal Findings Three datasets, matK+rbcL dataset with 2,083 sequences, matK+rbcL dataset with 397 sequences and matK+rbcL+trnH-psbA dataset with 397 sequences, were tested. We showed that the success rates of grouping sequences at the genus/species level based on this modified CV approach are always higher than those based on the traditional K2P/NJ method. For the matK+rbcL datasets, the modified CV approach outperformed the K2P-NJ approach by 7.9% in both the 2,083-sequence and 397-sequence datasets, and for the matK+rbcL+trnH-psbA dataset, the CV approach outperformed the traditional approach by 16.7%. Conclusions We conclude that the modified CV approach is an efficient method for analyzing large multi-gene datasets for plant DNA barcoding.

https://openalex.org/W2013541675,"We have used oriS-dependent transient replication assays to search for species-specific interactions within the herpes simplex virus replisome. Hybrid replisomes derived from herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) and equine herpesvirus type 1 (EHV-1) failed to support DNA replication in cells. Moreover, the replisomes showed a preference for their cognate origin of replication. The results demonstrate that the herpesvirus replisome behaves as a molecular machine relying on functionally important interactions. We then searched for functional interactions in the replisome context by subjecting HSV-1 UL8 protein to extensive mutagenesis. 52 mutants were made by replacing single or clustered charged amino acids with alanines. Four mutants showed severe replication defects. Mutant A23 exhibited a lethal phenotype, and mutants A49, A52 and A53 had temperature-sensitive phenotypes. Mutants A49 and A53 did not interact with UL52 primase as determined by co-immunoprecipitation experiments. Using GFP-tagged UL8, we demonstrate that all mutants were unable to support formation of ICP8-containing nuclear replication foci. Extended mutagenesis suggested that a highly conserved motif corresponding to mutant A49 serves an important role for establishing a physical contact between UL8 and UL52. The replication-defective mutations affected conserved amino acids, and similar phenotypes were observed when the corresponding mutations were introduced into EHV-1 UL8."
https://openalex.org/W1999650424,"The ADPRibase-Mn-like protein family, that belongs to the metallo-dependent phosphatase superfamily, has different functional and structural prototypes. The functional one is the Mn2+-dependent ADP-ribose/CDP-alcohol diphosphatase from Rattus norvegicus, which is essentially inactive with Mg2+ and active with low micromolar Mn2+ in the hydrolysis of the phosphoanhydride linkages of ADP-ribose, CDP-alcohols and cyclic ADP-ribose (cADPR) in order of decreasing efficiency. The structural prototype of the family is a Danio rerio protein with a known crystallographic structure but functionally uncharacterized. To estimate the structure-function correlation with the same protein, the activities of zebrafish ADPRibase-Mn were studied. Differences between zebrafish and rat enzymes are highlighted. The former showed a complex activity dependence on Mn2+, significant (≈25%) Mg2+-dependent activity, but was almost inactive on cADPR (150-fold less efficient than the rat counterpart). The low cADPR hydrolase activity agreed with the zebrafish genome lacking genes coding for proteins with significant homology with cADPR-forming enzymes. Substrate-docking to zebrafish wild-type protein, and characterization of the ADPRibase-Mn H97A mutant pointed to a role of His-97 in catalysis by orientation, and to a bidentate water bridging the dinuclear metal center as the potential nucleophile. Finally, three structural elements that delimit the active site entrance in the zebrafish protein were identified as unique to the ADPRibase-Mn-like family within the metallo-dependent phosphatase superfamily."
