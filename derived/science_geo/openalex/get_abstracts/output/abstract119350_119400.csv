https://openalex.org/W2068843202,"It has been proposed that the cell-mediated activation of progelatinase A requires binding of the C-terminal domain of the proenzyme to a membrane-associated complex of the membrane type matrix metalloproteinase MT1-MMP and TIMP-2. Subsequent sequential proteolysis of the propeptide by MT1-MMP and gelatinase A is thought to generate the active form of gelatinase A. We have prepared the proform of the catalytic domain of the MT1-MMP and demonstrated that this may be activated in vitro by trypsin proteolysis to yield a functional proteinase capable of cleaving typical metalloproteinase peptide substrates, gelatin and casein. The active catalytic domain of MT1-MMP was also shown to activate progelatinase A to a fully active form. Using the inactive mutant pro-E375A gelatinase A, we dissected the propeptide processing events that occur. MT1-MMP cleaves the propeptide at the sequence Asn37-Leu38 only. Further cleavage of the mutant enzyme propeptide at Asn80-Tyr81, equivalent to that of the active wild type gelatinase A, could only be effected by addition of gelatinase A to the system. TIMP-1 was essentially unable to prevent MT1-MMP processing of wild type or E375A progelatinase A, whereas TIMP-2 and TIMP-3 were good inhibitors of these events. Analysis of the rate of binding of TIMPs to the catalytic domain of MT1-MMP using kinetic methods showed that TIMP-1 is an extremely poor inhibitor of MT1-MMP. In comparison, TIMP-2 and TIMP-3 are excellent inhibitors, binding more rapidly to the catalytic domain of MT1-MMP than to the catalytic domain of gelatinase A. These data demonstrate the basic mechanism of MT1-MMP action on progelatinase A and the reason for the lack of inhibition by TIMP-1 previously demonstrated in cell-based activation studies.

Like other MMPs, gelatinase A is secreted as an inactive proenzyme, and it has been postulated that the proteolytic cascades associated with the activation process are a significant regulatory feature of these enzymes. Progelatinase A is unique in that the plasmin generation cascade implicated for other pro-MMPs does not effect activation (5Okada Y. Morodomi T. Enghild J.J. Suzuki K. Yasui A. Nakanishi I.

We reported that human skin fibroblasts stimulated by concanavalin A can bind, proteolytically process, and activate progelatinase A. The importance of the C-terminal domain of the enzyme for both the binding to cell membranes and subsequent activation was demonstrated (12Ward R.V. Atkinson S.J. Reynolds J.J. Murphy G. Biochem.

Cell membrane-mediated cleavage of progelatinase A to the Mr 66,000 active form (N terminus Tyr81) occurs via a Mr 68,000 intermediate (N terminus Leu38 (14Strongin A.Y. Marmer B.L. Grant G.A.

Okada Y. Cao J. Shinagawa A. Yamamoto E. Seiki M. Nature. 1994; 370: 61-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (2368) Google Scholar) reported the cloning of a novel transmembrane member of the MMP family, membrane type 1 MMP (MT1-MMP), and showed that cells transfected with MT1-MMP cDNA can activate progelatinase A. Using an inactive mutant of progelatinase A, we have shown that cell membrane-mediated activation is, by analogy with other MMPs, likely to be a complex activation cascade involving MT1-MMP which can be induced in fibroblasts by treatment with concanavalin A, followed by bimolecular autolysis (17Atkinson S.J.

It was proposed that the resulting MT1-MMP·TIMP-2 complex acted as a receptor for progelatinase A, potentiating cleavage by active MT1-MMP at adjacent sites. In this article, we look more closely at the biochemical properties of MMT1-MMP particularly in relation to its ability to process progelatinase A and the effects of tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases as regulators. A soluble recombinant form of pro-MT1-MMP consisting of the catalytic domain alone has been expressed into the periplasm of Escherichia coli and purified. The active form of this enzyme, which is a weak general proteinase, exhibits limited cleavage of the progelatinase A propeptide, leading to autoproteolytic activation of gelatinase A. The activity of MT1-MMP is tightly regulated by TIMP-2 and TIMP-3, whereas TIMP-1 is not an effective inhibitor. The proform of the catalytic domain of human MT1-MMP (Δ269-559, N-MT1-MMP) was expressed using the pectate lyase B of Erwinia carotova (pel B) system as a soluble protein with a His tag in the periplasm of E. coli (18Will H.

The enzyme was purified using a nickel chelate matrix and generally appeared either as a single band of Mr 31000 on SDS-PAGE or a closely spaced doublet. Full-length progelatinase A, its inactive form E375A, and the C-terminal domain truncated form, Δ418-631 gelatinase A, were prepared from a myeloma expression system and purified as described previously (13Murphy G.

Recombinant forms of human TIMP-1, TIMP-2, and TIMP-3 were prepared as described previously (21Murphy G. Houbrechts A. Cockett M.I. Williamson R.A. O'Shea M. Docherty A.J.P.

The activation of pro-MT1-MMP was effected using 5 µg/ml L-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone-treated trypsin (Sigma) at 25°C and stopped using 50 µg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor (SBTI). Conversion of the proenzyme to the active form with time was studied using SDS-PAGE, and activity was monitored continuously by hydrolysis of a quenched fluorescent peptide substrate (7-methoxycoumarin-4-yl)acetyl-Pro-Leu-Gly-Leu-[3-(2,4-dinitrophenyl)-L-2,3-diaminopropionyl)]-Ala-Arg-NH2 (Mca-PLGL-DpaAR (24Knight C.G. Willenbrock F. Murphy G. FEBS Lett. 1992; 296: 263-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar)). (Active site titration gave a maximal value of 8 nmol of active molecules per mg of trypsin-treated proenzyme, see below.) The pH optimum of active MT1-MMP had previously been determined as pH 9.0 using this substrate; assays were therefore generally carried out using 20 mM sodium tetraborate, pH 9.0, 10 mM CaCl2, 100 mM NaCl, 0.02% NaN3, 0.025% Brij 35 at 37°C, except where TIMP association studies were involved, when 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, was used instead of borate. The processing and activation of the proforms of gelatinase A and its mutants by active N-MT1-MMP were studied at pH 7.5 (50 mM Tris-HCl, 100 mM NaCl, 10 mM CaCl2) at 37°C and monitored by SDS-PAGE and silver staining, gelatin zymography, and by gelatinase activity assay using the Mca-PLGL-Dpa-AR or [14C]gelatin hydrolysis assays at pH 7.5 in the same buffer at 37°C. Where appropriate, different concentration of TIMPs were included in the incubations. Activated gelatinase samples were purified by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography on a Vydac 218T P54 column using a linear gradient of 5-95% acetonitrile prior to automated sequencing using an Applied Biosystems 470A sequencer with on-line 190A high performance liquid chromatography for phenylthiohydantoin-derivative analysis. Inhibition of the MT1-MMP catalytic domain by TIMP preparations was analyzed under pseudo first-order conditions. Using 50 pM trypsin-activated enzyme (active site titrated using TIMP-2 of known concentration, 22Willenbrock F. Crabbe T. Slocombe P.M. Sutton C.W. Docherty A.J.P. Cockett M.I. O'Shea M.

Crabbe T. Slocombe P.M. Sutton C.W. Docherty A.J.P. Cockett M.I. O'Shea M. Brocklehurst K. Phillips I.R. Murphy G.

Chem. 1994; 269: 14967-14973Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Data were analyzed to obtain the apparent first-order rate constant kobs, and the second order rate constant kon was derived by linear regression of kobs on TIMP concentration (22Willenbrock F. Crabbe T. Slocombe P.M. Sutton C.W. Docherty A.J.P. Cockett M.I. O'Shea M. Brocklehurst K. Phillips I.R. Murphy G. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 4330-4337Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). The purified catalytic domain of pro-MT1-MMP, N-MT1-MMP, was rapidly activated by treatment with trypsin at pH 7.5. Maximal activity against the quenched fluorescent substrate Mca-PLGL-Dpa-AR was observed after 10 min incubation with 5 µg/ml trypsin at 25°C (Fig. 1a). The rate of substrate hydrolysis decreased slightly after longer exposure to trypsin but was essentially stable for up to 120 min. Approximately 40% of the maximum activity was retained even after overnight incubation. SDS-PAGE analysis of the processing of N-MT1-MMP in the presence of trypsin revealed that maximal activation was associated with a reduction in molecular weight of the majority of the Mr 31,000 starting material (appearing in Fig. 1b as a closely spaced doublet) to 25,000 and 23,000 bands (Fig. 1b). These two products were generated by trypsin treatment whether the starting material appeared as a single band (not shown) or a doublet, indicating that they do not each arise from a different protein species present in the N-MT1-MMP preparation. Control incubation of N-MT1-MMP alone or of trypsin-SBTI alone had no activity against the substrate after 120 min incubation at 25°C, although N-MT1-MMP displayed 19% of maximal activity after overnight incubation alone (data not shown). The inclusion of an excess of TIMP-2 during the trypsin incubation period did not alter the pattern of active N-MT1-MMP generation (data not shown). N-terminal sequence analysis showed that the proenzyme had the sequence SLGSAQSS as would be expected from the cDNA construct used for expression. Both trypsin-processed forms had the N-terminal sequence YAIQGLKW, suggesting that the lower Mr 23,000 form was generated by tryptic hydrolysis at Arg253-Arg254 peptide bond at the C terminus of the molecule. N-MT1-MMP could not be efficiently activated by incubation with 4-aminophenylmercuric acetate (APMA). After about 0.5-10 min incubation at 25°C with 1 mM APMA, about 25% of maximal activity (trypsin treatment) could be detected, but this subsequently declined with increasing incubation time (Fig. 1a). SDS-PAGE analysis showed that a number of lower Mr species were generated; however, none of these were associated with any significant enzyme activity (Fig. 1c). N-MT1-MMP hydrolyzed Mca-PLGL-Dpa-AR with a kcat/Km value at 37°C of 2.63 × 105M−1·s−1 at pH values between 8.5 and 9.5. Activity fell rapidly above pH 9.5 but was 60% of maximum at pH 7.5. This proteinase was unable to hydrolyze the quenched fluorescent substrate mimicking the described cleavage site of pro-tumor necrosis factor α Mca-LAQAVRSSK-Dnp NH2 (where Dnp indicates dinitrophenyl), a peptide substrate covering the “aggrecanase” cleavage site of aggrecan, Mca-GTQGQEARGS-Dpa NH2, or the collagenase substrate Mca-PChaNva HADpa NH2 (where Cha indicates 3-cyclohexylalanyl and Nva indicates norvalyl) (26Knäuper V. Lopez-Otin C. Smith B. Knight G. Murphy G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1544-1550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (784) Google Scholar) (data not shown). Active N-MT1-MMP exhibited rather low but detectable activity against [14C]casein, 152 µg/min/mg and [14C]gelatin, 38.4 µg/min/mg at pH 7.5, 37°C. Progelatinase A incubation with trypsin-activated N-MT1-MMP at a ratio of 10:1 elicited maximal gelatinase activity against Mca-PLGL-Dpa-AR after about 120 min at 37°C (Fig. 2a). Further incubation caused a slight loss of gelatinase activity, but this was essentially stable overnight (data not shown). By comparison, activation of progelatinase A at 37°C with 2 mM APMA occurred more rapidly over the first 40 min of incubation but then stabilized and correlated well with the activity achieved by N-MT1-MMP activation after 120 min (Fig. 2a). SDS-PAGE analysis of the progelatinase A (Mr 72,000) showed that maximal activation of progelatinase A in the presence of N-MT1-MMP coincided with complete conversion to the Mr 66,000 active form (Fig. 2b). N-terminal sequencing of the latter showed that it had the sequence YNFFPR. A Mr 68,000 intermediate was transiently present at low levels during the first 40 min of activation. When progelatinase A was incubated at a molar ratio of 10:1 with a (preformed) equimolar N-MT1-MMP·TIMP-2 complex, progelatinase A processing and activation was completely inhibited (Fig. 3, a and b). However, when progelatinase A was incubated at a molar ratio of 10:1 with N-MT1-MMP preincubated with equimolar TIMP-1 (which do not form a complex) activation still proceeded but at a reduced rate (Fig. 3a). SDS-PAGE analysis of the reaction products (Fig. 3b) showed that progelatinase A propeptide processing was occurring in the presence of TIMP-1 with an initial build up of the Mr 68,000 intermediate (lanes 6 and 7), but final conversion to the Mr 66,000 form was not inhibited (lane 8). By contrast, activation of the same amount of progelatinase A in the presence of APMA was unaffected or only slightly inhibited by the equivalent amounts of the TIMPs (data not shown). TIMP-3 inhibited both processing and activation of progelatinase A by N-MT1-MMP in the same manner as TIMP-2 (data not shown). Incubation of pro-E375A gelatinase A with active N-MT1-MMP yielded the Mr 68,000 intermediate form only (Fig. 4), even after prolonged incubation at high levels of N-MT1-MMP (data not shown). The product had the N-terminal sequence LFVLKDTLKKMQXFF. In the presence of low levels of progelatinase A, further processing to a Mr 66,000 form with the N-terminal sequence YNFFPRXPXXD occurred (Fig. 4). The initial processing of pro-E375A gelatinase A by N-MT1-MMP in the presence of progelatinase A was very poorly inhibited by TIMP-1 but efficiently inhibited by TIMP-2 and TIMP-3 (Fig. 4). The C-terminal domain of progelatinase A was apparently not required for processing of the enzyme by active N-MT1-MMP. Incubation of the mutant pro-Δ418-613 gelatinase A, which can self-activate in the presence of organomercurials to a full, catalytically competent form (13Murphy G. Willenbrock F. Ward R.V. Cockett M.I. Eaton D. Docherty A.J.P. Biochem. J. 1992; 283: 637-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar), with N-MT1-MMP led to the rapid loss of the propeptide (Fig. 5). TIMP-1 was not an effective inhibitor (Fig. 5), but TIMP-2 and TIMP-3 were (data not shown). To investigate the large differences in the ability of the TIMPs-1, −2, and −3 to prevent N-MT1-MMP processing of the different forms of progelatinase A, we studied the rate of association of each TIMP with N-MT1-MMP using the quenched fluorescent substrate assay developed previously (24Knight C.G. Willenbrock F. Murphy G. FEBS Lett. 1992; 296: 263-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar). TIMP-2 and TIMP-3 showed very rapid binding to the catalytic domain of MT1-MMP, comparable with their binding to gelatinase A and its catalytic domain. By comparison, TIMP-1 showed very little ability to associate with N-MT1-MMP (Table I). Even under conditions of prolonged preincubation it was very difficult to detect TIMP-1 inhibition, and no accurate estimates of the kon value could be made.Table IRate constants for the inhibition of active N-MT1 MMP with TIMPskon (m·s−1)&×&10−6TIMP-1∼0.000053&(n=1)TIMP-24.2&±&0.22&(n=6)TIMP-33.07&±&0.17&(n=6) Open table in a new tab In order to assess the relationship between MT1-MMP and progelatinase A in the activation of the latter, we have examined the ability of the soluble catalytic domain of MT1-MMP to process the propeptide of gelatinase A. Pro-N-MT1-MMP was expressed in a soluble form into the periplasm of E. coli. Although this proenzyme was very poorly activated by exposure to organomercurials, it could be very rapidly converted to the active form by trypsin treatment. Because of our inability to detect any intermediates of activation and the lack of TIMP-2 inhibition of the propeptide processing, we conclude that trypsin cleaved at the C terminus of the putative “furin cleavage site” (16Sato H. Takino T. Okada Y. Cao J. Shinagawa A. Yamamoto E. Seiki M. Nature. 1994; 370: 61-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (2368) Google Scholar), viz. RRKR-Y89AIQ. However, we cannot rule out the concept that trypsin may cleave at a residue N-terminal to this site, followed by MT1-MMP self-cleavage, since our PAGE system would not be able to detect differences of 1-2 residues in the product of propeptide processing. The active form of N-MT1-MMP displayed a general proteolytic capacity similar to many other MMPs, including weak turnover of several peptide substrates and hydrolysis of gelatin and β-casein. Active N-MT1-MMP was able to efficiently effect the removal of the propeptide of gelatinase A resulting in activation which was initially slower than exposure of the latter to APMA. We have shown activation data for a molar ratio of N-MT1-MMP:progelatinase A of 1:10, when complete activation took about 120 min. However, at equimolar ratios, activation could be achieved in 10-15 min (data not shown). Progelatinase A was processed under all conditions to the Mr 66,000 form previously described. Levels of a transient Mr 68,000 intermediate could be significantly enhanced by the inclusion of TIMP-1 in the activation reaction. We previously demonstrated a build up of the Mr 68,000 species when TIMP-1 was present during progelatinase A processing by concanavalin A-stimulated fibroblasts (17Atkinson S.J. Crabbe T. Cowell S.

(14Strongin A.Y. Marmer B.L. Grant G.A. Goldberg G.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14033-14039Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) showed that HT1080 membrane processing of progelatinase A could also be delayed by the presence of TIMP-1, with the accumulation of a similar intermediate. In contrast, both TIMP-2 and TIMP-3 were efficient inhibitors of the progelatinase A processing in the presence of N-MT1-MMP. No evidence for an enhancement effect of very low levels TIMP-2 could be detected, as has been described by Strongin et al. (15Strongin A.Y. Collier I. Bannikov G. Marmer B.L. Grant G.A.

This does not, however, obviate their proposal that membrane-bound MT1-MMP uses TIMP-2 to generate a “receptor” which leads to the accumulation of progelatinase A on the cell surface prior to processing by adjacent active MT1-MMP. We have simply demonstrated that the catalytic domain of MT1-MMP can activate/process progelatinase A in solution at relatively high concentrations in the absence of TIMP-2. Using cell-mediated systems the activation of very low levels of progelatinase A (<15 ng/ml) can be effected in 24 h (11Ward R.V. Atkinson S.J. Slocombe P.M. Docherty A.J.P. Reynolds J.J. Murphy G.

In this soluble phase study we were unable to activate such low concentrations of gelatinase with equimolar concentrations of N-MT1-MMP over the same time period. This would explain the data of Cao et al. (27Cao J. Sato H. Takino T. Seiki M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 801-805Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar) who showed that the transmembrane domain deletion mutant of MT1-MMP which was secreted into the medium was unable to activate progelatinase A, i.e. when acting at a low concentration in the soluble phase. We recently presented data that concanavalin A-stimulated fibroblast membrane-associated activation of progelatinase A was likely to be a two-step process, initiated by cell surface MT1-MMP cleavage within the propeptide domain and completed by bimolecular autolysis (17Atkinson S.J.

The inactive mutant pro-E375A gelatinase A was largely processed by isolated fibroblast membrane preparations to an intermediate Mr 68,000 form only. Limited further processing occurred due to low levels of active wild type gelatinase A contaminating the membrane preparations. Addition of exogenous gelatinase A gave complete conversion of the E375A mutant to the Mr 66,000 form. Our present studies confirm these observations since N-MT1-MMP was only able to convert pro-E375A gelatinase to the Mr 68,000 form, even after prolonged incubation. The N-terminal sequence of this form was identical to that described for TIMP-1 arrested processing of wild type gelatinase by HT1080 membranes (14Strongin A.Y. Marmer B.L. Grant G.A. Goldberg G.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14033-14039Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Inclusion of small amounts of wild type progelatinase A led to E375A gelatinase A processing to the Mr 66,000 form with the same N-terminal sequence as active wild type enzyme. We noted that the action of N-MT1-MMP on pro-E375A gelatinase A could not be inhibited by TIMP-1 but was prevented by TIMP-2 or TIMP-3. This was in agreement with the previous observation that wild type proenzyme could still be processed in the presence of TIMP-1 by N-MT1-MMP, with an accumulation of the Mr 68,000 intermediate form, but all conversion was prevented by the other TIMP inhibitors. To analyze this effect further, we studied TIMP inhibition of N-MT1-MMP using the kinetic methods that we described previously (22Willenbrock F. Crabbe T. Slocombe P.M. Sutton C.W. Docherty A.J.P. Cockett M.I. O'Shea M. Brocklehurst K. Phillips I.R. Murphy G. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 4330-4337Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). As we discussed in our previous paper (19Knäuper V. Will H. Lopez-Otin C. Smith B. Atkinson S.J. Stanton H. Hembry R.M. Murphy G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17124-17131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar), the use of quenched fluorescent peptide substrates to monitor TIMP-MMP interactions is limited to the determination of association constants. However, such data give an excellent indication of the affinity of individual TIMPs for each of the MMPs. Our study showed that whereas TIMP-2 and TIMP-3 are rapid binding inhibitors of N-MT1-MMP, TIMP-1 is not a significant inhibitor. Although it is likely that the C-terminal domain of MT1-MMP is involved in TIMP binding, the association of the catalytic domain (N-terminal domain) with TIMPs-2 and −3 is remarkably efficient. We previously showed that active gelatinase A binds to TIMP-2 with a kon value (at 25°C) of 38 × 106M−1·s−1, falling to 0.3 × 106M−1·s−1, for the catalytic domain Δ418-631 gelatinase A (22Willenbrock F. Crabbe T. Slocombe P.M. Sutton C.W. Docherty A.J.P. Cockett M.I. O'Shea M. Brocklehurst K. Phillips I.R. Murphy G. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 4330-4337Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). It will be interesting to monitor the positive effect of the presence of the MT1-MMP C-terminal domain on binding, as well as the possible negative effects of insertion of MTI-MMP into the cell membrane where a “privileged environment” might be established. Further studies of this, as well as the importance of the C-terminal three loops of the TIMPs in binding to MT1-MMP, are required. Immunolocalization studies of activating fibroblasts using epitope-specific antibodies have indicated that TIMP-2 may associate with membrane-bound MT1-MMP such that the C-terminal tail is free for potential progelatinase A binding. 2S. J. Atkinson, R. M. Hembry, and G. Murphy, unpublished observations. We can conclude from our observations that MT1-MMP can initiate the activation of progelatinase A, in a process that could be regulated by either TIMP-2 or TIMP-3. Further questions about the topology of this process in relation to the cell membrane and the proposal of Strongin et al. (15Strongin A.Y. Collier I. Bannikov G. Marmer B.L. Grant G.A. Goldberg G.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5331-5338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1436) Google Scholar) that MT1-MMP-TIMP-2 is a progelatinase A receptor remain for future study.

https://openalex.org/W1971244052,"Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and interleukin 1 (IL-1) are implicated in inflammation and tissue destruction, where IL-1 is a potent stimulator of connective tissue cells to produce the extracellular matrix-degrading MMPs. Here, we report that IL-1beta, but not IL-1alpha, is degraded by MMP-1 (interstitial collagenase), MMP-2 (gelatinase A), MMP-3 (stromelysin 1), and MMP-9 (gelatinase B). This degradation was effectively blocked by tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases (TIMP)-1. When IL-1beta was treated with MMPs it lost the ability to enhance the synthesis of prostaglandin E2 and pro-MMP-3 in human fibroblasts. The primary cleavage site of IL-1beta by MMP-2 was identified at the Glu25-Leu26 bond. These results suggest that IL-1beta stimulates connective tissue cells to produce MMPs, but activated MMPs in turn negatively regulate the activity of IL-1beta."

We have recently identified palmitoyl-protein thioesterase as the defective enzyme in the recessive hereditary neurological degenerative disorder infantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (Vesa, J., Hellsten, E., Verkruyse, L. A., Camp, L. A., Rapola, J., Santavuori, P., Hofmann, S. L., and Peltonen, L. (1995) Nature 376, 584–587). A defect in a lysosomal enzyme had been postulated for the disease, but until recently, the relevant defective lysosomal enzyme had not been identified.In this paper, we present evidence for the lysosomal localization of palmitoyl-protein thioesterase. We show that COS cells take up exogenously supplied palmitoyl-protein thioesterase intracellularly and that the cellular uptake is blocked by mannose 6-phosphate, a hallmark of lysosomal enzyme trafficking. The enzyme contains endoglycosidase H-sensitive oligosaccharides that contain phosphate groups. Furthermore, palmitoyl-protein thioesterase cosediments with lysosomal enzyme markers by Percoll density gradient centrifugation. Interestingly, the pH optimum for the enzyme is in the neutral range, a property shared by two other lysosomal enzymes that remove post-translational protein modifications.

Many proteins involved in signal transduction are dependent on covalently attached lipids for membrane localization and function (1Casey P.J. Science. 1995; 268: 221-225Google Scholar). The major classes of lipid modification include N-myristoylation, S-acylation (usually palmitoylation), S-prenylation (farnesylation or geranylgeranylation), and glypiation, which is the attachment of a glycolipid anchor to externally oriented cell-surface proteins. S-Acylation is unique among these modifications because it is a reversible reaction and therefore a potential target for metabolic regulation. In fact, the β-adrenergic receptor (2Mouillac B. Caron M. Bonin H. Dennis M. Bouvier M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21733-21737Google Scholar), the endothelial nitric-oxide synthetase (3Robinson L.J. Busconi L. Michel T. J. Biol.

FASEB J. 1994; 8 (abstr.): A1430Google Scholar) have all recently been shown to contain covalently bound palmitate that exhibits accelerated turnover in response to agonists. A mutated form of αs that cannot be palmitoylated is functionally uncoupled from activation (7Wedegaertner P.B. Chu D.H. Wilson P.T. Levis M.J. Bourne H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25001-25008Google Scholar); therefore, depalmitoylation may be regarded as a potential mechanism for decreasing the signaling activity of αs. The mechanism for regulated palmitate turnover, including the identification of key enzymes, has yet to be defined. In fact, the eventual fate of any of the protein-bound lipid anchors is unknown. In an initial attempt to study the mechanism of deacylation of Ha-Ras (a farnesylated and palmitoylated protein), we purified and molecularly cloned a thioesterase (palmitoyl-protein thioesterase (PPT) 1The abbreviations used are: PPTpalmitoyl-protein thioesteraseINCLinfantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosisPBSphosphate-buffered salineMDBKMadin-Darby bovine kidneyEndo Hendoglycosidase HPNGase Fpeptide-N4-(N-acetyl-β-D-glucosaminyl)asparagine amidase. ) that removes palmitate groups from proteins in vitro (8Camp L.A.

We recently identified PPT as the enzyme defective in a neurovisceral storage disorder common in Finland, infantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (INCL) (10Vesa J. Hellsten E. Verkruyse L.A. Camp L.A. Rapola J. Santavuori P. Hofmann S.L. Peltonen L. Nature. 1995; 376: 584-587Google Scholar). The disease is characterized by early visual loss and progressive mental deterioration, resulting in a flat electroencephalogram by age 3, with death by 8–11 years of age (11Santavuori P. Haltia M. Rapola J. Dev. Med. Child Neurol. 1974; 16: 644-653Google Scholar). Marked neuronal loss in the cortex and cerebellum is seen, whereas brainstem neurons are relatively spared. A characteristic finely granular autofluorescent sudanophilic storage material is found throughout the brain and other tissues (12Rapola J. Haltia M. Brain. 1973; 96: 833-840Google Scholar). The material is similar to lipofuscin resulting from normal aging, and INCL has been proposed as a model for accelerated aging in the human brain (13Armstrong D. Koppang N. Sohal R.S. Age Pigments. Elsevier Science Publishing Co. Inc., New York1981: 355Google Scholar). Biochemical analysis of the storage material has not been particularly revealing, showing a mixture of protein, lipid, and carbohydrate (14Tyynela J. Palmer D.N. Baumann M. Haltia M. FEBS Lett. 1993; 330: 8-12Google Scholar). In INCL, saposins A and D appear to be the predominant proteins (14Tyynela J. Palmer D.N. Baumann M. Haltia M. FEBS Lett. 1993; 330: 8-12Google Scholar), but the significance of this finding is unclear since saposins accumulate in a number of diverse storage diseases (15Tayama M. O'Brien J.S. Kishimoto Y. J. Mol. Neurosci. 1992; 3: 171-175Google Scholar). Because a lysosomal enzyme had not been identified as defective in the disease, it has not been classified historically as a lysosomal storage disorder. In this paper, we demonstrate that PPT is a lysosomal enzyme. Recombinant PPT produced in COS cells is taken up into untransfected cells by a process inhibited by mannose 6-phosphate, and endogenous PPT cosediments with dense lysosomes. These findings provide strong evidence that PPT is indeed a lysosomal enzyme and that INCL is a lysosomal storage disease. Three New Zealand White rabbits were each immunized with 300 µg of recombinant bovine brain PPT (9Camp L.A. Verkruyse L.A. Afendis S.J. Slaughter C.A. Hofmann S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23212-23219Google Scholar). The antigen was injected intradermally in Freund's complete adjuvant, and the rabbits were boosted once after a 6-week interval with 150 µg of antigen in Freund's incomplete adjuvant. An IgG fraction was prepared from preimmune and immune sera by protein A-Sepharose CL-4B (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) chromatography. IgG was affinity-purified by specific binding to a column consisting of bovine PPT coupled to CNBr-activated Sepharose CL-4B (5 mg of protein/ml of gel). Purified IgG was eluted with 0.1 M ammonium hydroxide (pH 10.5), neutralized immediately with glacial acetic acid, and dialyzed overnight at 4°C against 1 liter of borate-buffered saline. The construction of pCMV-PPT, which contains the full-length bovine PPT coding region in the eukaryotic expression vector pCMV5, was described previously (9Camp L.A. Verkruyse L.A. Afendis S.J. Slaughter C.A. Hofmann S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23212-23219Google Scholar). Simian COS-1 cells were maintained in monolayer culture in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (high glucose) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 µg/ml streptomycin, and 0.25 µg/ml amphotericin B and transfected using Lipofectin reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) using 3 µg of DNA and 10 µl of Lipofectin per 60-mm dish according to the directions supplied by the manufacturer. Cells were harvested or used in metabolic labeling experiments at 48–72 h after transfection. For pulse-chase analysis using [35S]cysteine/methionine, cells were washed twice with 2 ml of prewarmed methionine-free medium (ICN) and incubated for 1 h. [35S]Cysteine/methionine (50 µCi/ml; Tran35S-label, ICN) was added for a 15-min incubation, and the cells were washed three times in culture medium containing 300 µg/ml L-methionine and chased for varying times up to 24 h. The culture medium was collected; the cells were washed three times in cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), scraped into 3 ml of PBS, and centrifuged at 1200 rpm in a Sorvall RT6000B centrifuge for 5 min to pellet the cells; and the cells and medium were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −85°C. For phosphate labeling, cells were incubated in phosphate-deficient medium for 1 h and then labeled for 3 h with 400 µCi/ml [32P]orthophosphate (American Radiolabeled Chemicals) and incubated in fresh culture medium for 3 h. Cell lysates were prepared by the addition of 0.5 ml of lysis buffer consisting of Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (without calcium or magnesium) containing 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 1 µg/ml leupeptin, 1 µg/ml pepstatin, and 0.2 mM phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride for 1 h on ice and centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 30 min at 4°C in a microcentrifuge. To immunoprecipitate recombinant expressed PPT, cell lysates and harvested culture medium from transfected cells were precleared by incubation with 5 µg of nonimmune IgG and 15 µl of a 50:50 slurry of protein A-Sepharose in lysis buffer for 2 h on a laboratory rotator at 4°C. Protein A-Sepharose was removed by centrifugation at 3000 rpm in a microcentrifuge for 5 min. An affinity-purified polyclonal anti-bovine PPT antibody (1 µg/50 µg of total cell protein) or preimmune antibody was added to the precleared cell lysates and culture medium, and the samples were incubated for 14–16 h on a laboratory rotator at 4°C. Immunoprecipitates were collected by the addition of 15 µl of a 50:50 slurry of protein A-Sepharose in lysis buffer, incubation for 2 h on a laboratory rotator at 4°C, and centrifugation at 5000 rpm for 3 min. Pellets were washed three times with 1 ml of buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 1 mM EDTA, 0.25% (w/v) gelatin, and 0.02% sodium azide and then with 1 ml of 50 mM sodium phosphate (pH 6.0) containing 0.01% (v/v) Nonidet P-40. Bound proteins were eluted by boiling for 5 min in 15 µl of a solution containing 50 mM sodium phosphate (pH 5.5), 1.0% (w/v) SDS, and 60 mM 2-mercaptoethanol. Released proteins were added to 20 µl of 50 mM sodium phosphate (pH 5.5) and incubated with or without 1 µl (0.025 units) of endoglycosidase H (Glyco, Novato, CA) overnight at 37°C. Samples were then diluted into Laemmli gel loading buffer (16Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar) containing 5% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol, subjected to electrophoresis on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide slab gels, treated with Entensify (Dupont NEN) fluorography enhancer, and exposed to Kodak XAR-5 film at −85°C. COS-1 cells were transfected with pCMV-PPT as described above. At 50 h post-transfection, the conditioned medium (in a mixture consisting of 5 ml of conditioned medium and 5 ml of fresh medium) was added to untransfected COS-1 cells that had been plated at a density of 0.5 × 105 cells/ml 1 day prior to the experiment. Incubations were carried out for 20 h at 37°C. The cells were washed three times in cold PBS and harvested into a buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.0), 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA, 1 µg/ml leupeptin, 1 µg/ml pepstatin A, and 0.2 mM phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride. After a brief sonication, the whole cell extracts were subjected to electrophoresis on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, transferred to nitrocellulose filters, and analyzed by immunoblotting as described below. Crude COS-1 cell lysates or immunoprecipitated proteins were electrophoresed on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide slab gels, and the proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose as described previously (17Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Google Scholar). Filters were blocked for 1 h in PBS-T (0.25% (v/v) Tween 20 in PBS) containing 5% (w/v) nonfat dry milk, washed in PBS-T, and incubated for 2 h with purified antibody (1.0 µg/ml) in PBS-T. The filters were washed and incubated for 1 h with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG (Amersham Corp.) diluted 1:2000 in PBS-T and developed using ECL chemiluminescence reagents (Amersham Corp.). Madin-Darby bovine kidney (MDBK) cells were maintained in monolayer culture in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (high glucose) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 µg/ml streptomycin, and 0.25 µg/ml amphotericin B. Cells were plated at a density of 5 × 105 cells/ml in 100-mm dishes and incubated for 9 h. The culture medium was replaced with fresh medium containing 1.5 mM mannose 6-phosphate, and the cells were incubated overnight at 37°C. Two confluent dishes of cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and once with homogenization buffer (0.25 M sucrose, 1 mM EDTA (pH 7.5)), and each dish was scraped into 1.2 ml of homogenization buffer and passed 20 times through a ball-bearing homogenizer (H and Y Enterprise, Redwood City, CA) with a clearance of 51 µm. The homogenate was centrifuged for 10 min at 400 × g, and the resulting postnuclear supernatant was layered over a discontinuous gradient consisting of a 1.2-ml cushion of 10 × homogenization buffer and 8.5 ml of an 18% Percoll solution in homogenization buffer. The gradient was centrifuged for 60 min at 27,000 rpm (67,000 × gmax) in a Sorvall T1270 rotor. The cushion and nine 1.2-ml fractions were collected from the bottom of the tube, and the Percoll was removed by centrifugation for 40 min at 70,000 rpm in a Beckman TL 100.3 rotor. The samples were adjusted to 0.5% Triton X-100, passed five times through a 25-gauge needle, and incubated on ice for 30 min. β-Hexosaminidase activity (lysosomal marker) was determined as described (18Rohrer J. Schweizer A. Johnson K.F. Kornfeld S. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 1297-1306Google Scholar). Assays for enzymes for other subcellular organelles (cytochrome c oxidase, alkaline phosphodiesterase I, and α-mannosidase II for mitochondria, plasma membranes, and Golgi apparatus, respectively) were performed exactly as described (19Storrie B. Madden E.A. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 182: 203-225Google Scholar). For determination of the location of endosomes, the endosomal compartment was labeled with horseradish peroxidase in a parallel experiment by incubation of cells for 5 min at 37°C in medium containing 10 mg/ml horseradish peroxidase, processed, and assayed as described (19Storrie B. Madden E.A. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 182: 203-225Google Scholar). COS-1 cells in 60-mm dishes were transfected with pCMV-PPT, and at 48 h post-transfection, the cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated in 0.8 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.5 mM glucose, 2 mML-glutamine, 10% dialyzed bovine serum, 12.5 mM ammonium chloride (to promote secretion of lysosomal enzymes), and 200 µCi of [3H]mannose (D-[2-3H]mannose, American Radiolabeled Chemicals) for 4 h at 37°C. Normal maintenance medium was added to the dishes, and the medium was adjusted to 5 mM glucose and 5 mM mannose to inhibit further uptake of [3H]mannose. After an additional 4 h, the medium was harvested and dialyzed overnight at 4°C against 500 ml of a buffer containing 25 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mM NaCl, and 0.2% sodium azide. The dialysate was subjected to immunoprecipitation using anti-bovine PPT antibodies, and the [3H]mannose-labeled immune complexes were analyzed after Endo H or N-glycanase treatment by QAE-Sephadex chromatography (for determination of the degree of phosphorylation) and concanavalin A chromatography (for determination of high-mannose and bi-, tri-, and tetraantennary complex oligosaccharides) exactly as described (20Dustin M.L. Baranski T.J. Sampath D. Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 170-179Google Scholar). The synthesis and secretion of bovine recombinant PPT were examined in a transient transfection assay using simian COS cells that were pulse-labeled with [35S]cysteine/methionine and chased for varying periods of time using unlabeled medium (Fig. 1). 35S-Labeled PPT was immunoprecipitated and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and fluorography either before (Fig. 1, upper panels) or after (lower panels) treatment with Endo H, a treatment that releases high mannose-type, but not complex, oligosaccharides from the polypeptide backbone. Newly synthesized PPT appeared as a doublet at 38.5 and 36 kDa (Fig. 1, first lane). Labeled enzyme appeared in the medium by 30 min of chase, and by 1 h of chase, half of the label had appeared in the culture medium, with a peak for the appearance of labeled PPT in the medium at 3 h. All of the labeled enzyme associated with the cells was sensitive to Endo H treatment (Fig. 1, lower left panel), while the medium contained a mixture of Endo H-sensitive and Endo H-resistant enzyme (Fig. 1, lower right panel), with a predominance of the Endo H-resistant form. Many proteins normally targeted to intracellular compartments are secreted into the culture medium when overexpressed in COS or other transfected cells. To determine whether PPT is destined for secretion or whether it might be targeted to an intracellular organelle, we added culture medium from PPT-overexpressing COS cells to untransfected COS cells and found that PPT was taken up and internalized by the untransfected cells (Fig. 2, lane 1). Furthermore, cellular uptake was inhibited by mannose 6-phosphate (Fig. 2, lanes 5–7), but not by mannose alone (lanes 2–4). This result is diagnostic of uptake through mannose 6-phosphate receptor-mediated endocytosis, a distinguishing feature of lysosomal enzyme transport (21Kornfeld S. Mellman I. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1989; 5: 483-525Google Scholar). To further support this observation, an experiment was performed to demonstrate that phosphorylated high-mannose oligosaccharides are bound to PPT (Fig. 3). COS cells were transiently transfected with bovine recombinant PPT and incubated in the presence of [32P]orthophosphate. Cell lysates and culture medium were subjected to immunoprecipitation and analysis on SDS-polyacrylamide slab gels and autoradiography. In the presence of immune serum, a clear 32P-labeled doublet was seen in the cells (Fig. 3, lane 2) and culture medium (lane 5). The 32P label was removed completely following incubation of the immunoprecipitates with endoglycosidase H, which removes high-mannose oligosaccharide chains, thus confirming the presence of the mannose 6-phosphate modification of PPT. A quantitative oligosaccharide analysis of bovine recombinant PPT immunoprecipitated from COS cell-conditioned medium (Table I) was undertaken to further characterize these modifications. The transfected cells were cultured in the presence of ammonium chloride, which promotes the secretion of lysosomal enzymes (18Rohrer J. Schweizer A. Johnson K.F. Kornfeld S. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 1297-1306Google Scholar). We found that 30.4 ± 1.1% of the total oligosaccharide chains were monophosphorylated, and 21.1% were diphosphorylated (all of the high-mannose type); furthermore, 44.6 ± 1.8% of the oligosaccharides were of the complex type. The majority of these complex oligosaccharides were of the biantennary form.Table IOligosaccharide analysis of bovine recombinant PPT from COS cell-conditioned medium% of total (mean ± S.E.)Endo H-sensitive oligosaccharidesUnphosphorylated3.9 ± 1.2Monophosphorylated30.4 ± 1.1Diphosphorylated21.2 ± 2.1Endo H-resistant oligosaccharidesTri- and tetraantennary complexes7.0 ± 5.3Biantennary complex25.6 ± 2.2Endo H-resistant high-mannose12.0 ± 3.6Total Endo H-resistant oligosaccharides44.6 ± 1.8Total phosphorylated oligosaccharides51.5 ± 2.0 Open table in a new tab The lysosomal localization of endogenous PPT in MDBK cells was confirmed by Percoll density gradient centrifugation (Fig. 4). MDBK cells growing in monolayer culture were disrupted using a ball-bearing homogenizer and loaded onto a self-forming Percoll gradient. Following centrifugation, fractions were collected for marker enzyme analysis and immunoblotting with anti-bovine PPT antibodies. Using this technique, dense lysosomes pelleted in the bottom fraction, whereas mitochondrial, endocytic, Golgi, and plasma membrane markers were included in the gradient (Fig. 4, upper panel). PPT immunoreactivity was essentially entirely restricted to the bottom fraction, a result consistent with a lysosomal localization (Fig. 4, lower panel). The fractions were also analyzed for PPT enzymatic activity using [3H]palmitate-labeled Ha-Ras as a substrate (data not shown). The vast majority of the activity correlated exactly with PPT immunoreactivity, while a minor activity peaked with the plasma membrane marker (and probably represents an N-ethylmaleimide- and phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride-sensitive membrane-bound thioesterase described previously (8Camp L.A. Hofmann S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22566-22574Google Scholar)). This activity is currently being characterized further. A study of the biosynthesis of endogenous PPT in MDBK cells was not technically feasible owing to the low abundance of the protein. However, an examination of the migration pattern of PPT by immunoblotting of cell lysates and conditioned medium from the MDBK cells (Fig. 5) revealed evidence for processing of the oligosaccharide chains from high mannose-type to complex oligosaccharides during the maturation of the endogenous enzyme. Digestion of cell-associated PPT with Endo H caused a large shift of PPT immunoreactive bands (Fig. 5, compare lanes 1 and 3), indicating that most of the cell-associated enzyme contains high-mannose oligosaccharides. However, very little enzyme was completely deglycosylated by this treatment (compare lanes 3 and 2, which was PNGase F-treated), indicating that most molecules contain both high-mannose and complex oligosaccharide chains. This result would be expected in the case of a protein that contains multiple glycosylation sites, with only a subset subjected to phosphorylation and the remainder being processed to complex Endo H-resistant forms. (PPT has three potential N-linked glycosylation sites, and all of these are utilized to some degree. 2J.-Y. Lu and S. L. Hofmann, unpublished results. ) PPT recovered from the medium migrated at an even higher molecular mass, as expected for a lysosomal enzyme that has escaped mannose 6-phosphate receptor uptake and has been processed to complex forms (Fig. 5, lane 4). Consistent with this prediction is the result shown in Fig. 5 (lane 6), in which a larger proportion of the secreted enzyme appears to be Endo H-resistant as compared with the cell-associated enzyme. Many lysosomal enzymes undergo extensive proteolytic processing during maturation (reviewed in 22Hasilik A. Experientia (Basel). 1992; 48: 130-151Google Scholar). However, we did not find evidence for significant proteolytic processing of PPT during synthesis or reuptake. This is best seen by a comparison of the 35S-labeled bands during the pulse and chase phases of biosynthetic labeling (Fig. 1) and by a comparison of the migration of cellular, secreted, and endocytosed forms of recombinant PPT in COS cells (Fig. 6, lanes 1–3), particularly following deglycosylation with Endo H or PNGase F (lanes 4–9). No shift in the migration of deglycosylated PPT was seen either after secretion or after endocytosis (Fig. 6, lanes 4–6 and 7-9). We cannot rule out a small amount of proteolytic processing occurring at either end of the mature protein; in fact, PPT purified from brain has two fewer N-terminal amino acids as compared with recombinant bovine PPT expressed in the insect cell-baculovirus expression system (see “Discussion”). This minor form of processing would not have been detected in these experiments. The Sf9 cell-derived enzyme is not phosphorylated on mannose residues and is not competent for uptake through the mannose 6-phosphate receptor (data not shown). In addition to proteolytic processing in the lysosome, lysosomal enzymes often lose some of their carbohydrate by the action of lysosomal exoglycosidases (23Neufeld E.F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 257-280Google Scholar). However, the trimming of terminal carbohydrate residues is not necessary for the function of these enzymes, and the significance of these alterations is unknown. The shift in migration seen when the secreted form of PPT is taken up by the untransfected cells (Fig. 6, compare lanes 2 and 3) may be attributed to this type of processing; alternatively, it is also possible that only a small fraction of enzyme molecules bearing mannose 6-phosphate residues are subject to endocytosis, and the apparent shift results from the selection of only this fraction, which may migrate at a lower apparent molecular mass. A more sophisticated analysis of the oligosaccharides bound to PPT at various stages of maturation will be needed to distinguish between these possibilities. We had previously reported (8Camp L.A. Hofmann S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22566-22574Google Scholar) that the pH optimum of PPT using Ha-Ras as a substrate is around 7.0, an unusual finding for lysosomal enzymes, which usually have pH optima in the acidic range. We have confirmed and extended this observation in thioesterase assays using both [3H]palmitate-labeled Ha-Ras and [3H]palmitoyl-CoA as substrates (Fig. 7). The pH optimum using Ha-Ras as a substrate is broad, but clearly peaks at pH 7.0 (Fig. 7A). However, significant residual activity was seen at lower pH values (10–20% at pH 4.5 and ∼25-50% of maximal at pH 5.5, with some variations due to buffer effects). The pH optimum using the model substrate palmitoyl-CoA (Fig. 7B) is pH 7.5, but activity was half-maximal in the range 4.5-5.5. In this paper, we provide evidence for the lysosomal localization and targeting of palmitoyl-protein thioesterase. Recombinant PPT expressed in COS cells was found to contain Endo H-sensitive phosphate and to be taken up by COS cells in a manner blocked by mannose 6-phosphate, but not by mannose alone, which is a distinguishing feature of lysosomal enzyme targeting. The localization of PPT to lysosomes was further confirmed by Percoll density gradient ultracentrifugation, in which all of the PPT in MDBK cells was found to cosediment with dense lysosomes. Lysosomal enzymes undergo a number of modifications during synthesis and processing on their way to the lysosomal compartment. These modifications are classified as early (pre-lysosomal) or late (post-lysosomal) processing events (reviewed in 22Hasilik A. Experientia (Basel). 1992; 48: 130-151Google Scholar). Soluble lysosomal enzymes are synthesized in the rough endoplasmic reticulum. The nascent polypeptides are cotranslationally separated from signal sequences and then glycosylated in the lumen of the rough endoplasmic reticulum. The early oligosaccharides are of the high-mannose type. In the endoplasmic reticulum and in the Golgi apparatus, the oligosaccharides of lysosomal proteins are subjected to further processing. In the cis-Golgi, a signal “patch” on the lysosomal enzyme directs the addition of an N-acetylglucosaminyl phosphate to the C-6 hydroxyl groups of one or two mannose residues of oligosaccharides at particular glycosylation sites (24Dahms N.M. Lobel P. Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12115-12118Google Scholar). If this phosphorylation is not allowed to proceed (as in the case of overexpression of recombinant proteins, in which protein production may exceed the capacity of phosphoryl transfer), the oligosaccharides may be further processed and come to contain predominantly complex or hybrid forms that are resistant to Endo H. Unphosphorylated enzymes are secreted, as are a small proportion of phosphorylated enzymes that escape capture by the mannose 6-phosphate receptor. These events are referred to as early forms of lysosomal enzyme processing (22Hasilik A. Experientia (Basel). 1992; 48: 130-151Google Scholar). Lysosomal enzyme precursors that are targeted to lysosomes are also subjected to late processing, which may consist of fragmentation of the protein (in rare cases, leading to activation of a latent form of the enzyme), trimming of the oligosaccharide side chains, or both. In a few instances, the fragmentation process involves activation of a zymogen, as is the case for several of the cathepsins (D, L, H, and B). Little if any N-terminal processing (beyond removal of the signal sequence) is seen in a number of other human lysosomal enzymes (22Hasilik A. Experientia (Basel). 1992; 48: 130-151Google Scholar). In this study, PPT was shown to undergo both early and late processing events characteristic of lysosomal enzymes. We know that the signal peptide is removed by comparison of the deduced amino acid sequence of PPT with the N-terminal sequence of purified brain and recombinant forms of the enzyme. In this study, evidence for the modification of oligosaccharides by mannose 6-phosphate and further processing to complex and hybrid forms is presented. We saw little evidence for proteolytic fragmentation of PPT; however, we know that two amino acids are removed from the N terminus in a late processing event because the mature form purified from bovine brain begins at residue 28, and the recombinant form derived from the Sf9 insect cell-baculovirus system begins at residue 26. We have also previously shown that the Sf9 form is fully active, and this minor proteolytic trimming does not serve to activate the protein. In many respects, PPT is synthesized and processed like a “typical” lysosomal enzyme. However, the neutral pH optimum we observed for the enzyme is puzzling. Why should a lysosomal enzyme have a neutral pH optimum? We are aware of only two other lysosomal enzymes (aspartylglucosaminidase (25Tollersrud O.K. Aronson N.N.J. Biochem. J. 1989; 260: 101-108Google Scholar), the enzyme defective in aspartylglucosaminuria, another “Finnish disease heritage” enzyme, and a lysosomal sialic acid-specific O-acetylesterase (26Higa H.H. Manzi A. Varki A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19435-19442Google Scholar)). Interestingly, all three of these enzymes have been postulated to have a role in the removal of post-translational protein modifications in the lysosome. Butor et al. (27Butor C. Griffiths G. Aronson N.N.J. Varki A. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 2213-2219Google Scholar) have recently presented evidence for the intermittent cycling of lysosomes to more neutral pH. These investigators have put forth the interesting idea that periodic pH fluctuations would promote protein denaturation, allowing access of degradative enzymes to the modified amino acid residues. Such an explanation is attractive in the case of PPT, which recognizes palmitate residues that modify cysteines in proteins, and in the case of the sialic-acid esterase, which removes sialic acid residues from modified proteins. However, aspartylglucosaminidase recognizes the modified asparagine only after it has been liberated from the protein backbone, and so would not be aided in its action by protein denaturation. Defective PPT function leads to the storage disorder infantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (10Vesa J. Hellsten E. Verkruyse L.A. Camp L.A. Rapola J. Santavuori P. Hofmann S.L. Peltonen L. Nature. 1995; 376: 584-587Google Scholar). The disease is characterized by the accumulation of membrane-delimited intracellular inclusion bodies that stain with antibodies directed against acid hydrolases by immunohistochemistry (28Haltia M. Rapola J. Santavuori P. Keranen A. J. Neurol. Sci. 1973; 18: 269-285Google Scholar). Therefore, the demonstration that PPT is a lysosomal enzyme conclusively supports the classification of INCL as a lysosomal storage disease. Therapeutic strategies designed to target defective lysosomal enzymes to the central nervous system (23Neufeld E.F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 257-280Google Scholar) should therefore be relevant to INCL. We thank Won Yi for excellent technical assistance and Drs. Stuart Kornfeld, Jack Rohrer, Anja Schweizer, Walter Gregory, Barbara Barylko, and Mike Roth for helpful discussions."
https://openalex.org/W1996526473,"Recently, a second member of the protease-activated receptor (PAR) family, named PAR-2, has been identified. Similar to the thrombin receptor, PAR-2 appears to be activated by proteolytic-mediated exposure of a “tethered ligand” sequence and can also be activated by the corresponding synthetic peptides. Similarities in the amino acid sequence of the receptors' tethered ligand sequences suggest that their respective agonist peptides might not be absolutely specific for their particular receptors. To test this, the receptor specificity of each agonist has been determined by measuring the responses of Xenopus oocytes expressing the thrombin receptor or PAR-2 to agonist peptides or enzymes.

https://openalex.org/W2082566182,"Cell adhesion to the extracellular matrix triggers a cascade of intracellular biochemical signals regulated by the integrin family of receptors. Recent evidence suggests that integrin engagement may activate a mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase cascade that may cooperate with more clearly defined mitogenic signaling pathways to regulate cell proliferation, adhesion, and migration. Here we report that the adhesion-dependent activation of the MAP kinase Erk2 (extracellular signal-regulated kinase 2) occurs in serum-starved NIH3T3 cells, and that this activation of Erk2 is preceded by the activation of the small GTP-binding protein Ras in fibronectin-adherent cells. Inhibition of Ras signaling by expression of a dominant-inhibitory mutant of Ras (N17Ras) in NIH3T3 cells blocked adhesion-dependent activation of Erk2, although the focal adhesion kinase (FAK) was still activated in these cells. Furthermore, activation of this Ras-MAP kinase pathway activated cytosolic phospholipase A2, leading to the release of arachidonic acid metabolites, and N17Ras also inhibited these events. However, N17Ras expression does not inhibit cell adhesion, spreading, or focal contact and stress fiber formation. These results suggest that, while integrin-dependent activation of this MAP kinase pathway is Ras-dependent, the integrin-dependent activation of FAK and several morphological events are Ras-independent. Thus, integrin-mediated signals involved in regulating cell morphology appear to diverge from those regulating MAP kinase activation at a level upstream of Ras activation. Cell adhesion to the extracellular matrix triggers a cascade of intracellular biochemical signals regulated by the integrin family of receptors.

These results suggest that, while integrin-dependent activation of this MAP kinase pathway is Ras-dependent, the integrin-dependent activation of FAK and several morphological events are Ras-independent. Thus, integrin-mediated signals involved in regulating cell morphology appear to diverge from those regulating MAP kinase activation at a level upstream of Ras activation. Integrins are the major family of transmembrane receptors that mediate attachment to the extracellular matrix (ECM). 1The abbreviations used are: ECMextracellular matrixMAPmitogen-activated proteinErk2extracellular signal-regulated kinase 2FAKfocal adhesion kinasecPLA2cytosolic phospholipase A2DMEMDulbecco's modified Eagle's mediumRIPAradioimmunoprecipitation assayPBSphosphate-buffered salinePDGFplatelet-derived growth factor. Engagement and clustering of integrins lead to the formation of structures, called focal adhesions, where integrins link to intracellular cytoskeletal complexes and bundles of actin filaments. These structures form a scaffolding for the association of signaling molecules that regulate signal transduction pathways leading to integrin-induced changes in cell behavior. Recently, much has been learned about the interactions between integrins and the ECM, although significantly less is known about the intracellular biochemical pathways that integrins regulate and the cellular functions that are thereby controlled (reviewed in 1Clark E.A. Brugge J.S. Science. 1995; 268: 233-239Google Scholar, 2Schwartz M.A. Schaller M.D. Ginsberg M.H. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1995; 11: 549-599Google Scholar, 3Yamada K.M. Miyamoto S. Curr. Opin.

One family of proteins whose role in integrin-mediated signaling has only recently begun to be examined is the Ras superfamily of small GTP-binding proteins. Ras, the canonical member of the superfamily, is activated in response to numerous soluble growth and serum factors. Subsequently, Ras activates a signaling pathway that includes the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases Erk1 and Erk2 which eventually regulate transcription, translation, and the cytoskeleton (4Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14553-14556Google Scholar). Erk1 and Erk2 are also activated when cells adhere to the ECM proteins fibronectin, laminin, collagen, and vitronectin (5Chen Q. Kinch M.S. Lin T.H. Burridge K. Juliano R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26602-26605Google Scholar, 6Schlaepfer D.D. Hanks S.K. Hunter T. van der Geer P. Nature. 1994; 372: 786-791Google Scholar, 7Zhu X. Assoian R.K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 273-282Google Scholar), suggesting that integrin-matrix interactions activate a MAP kinase cascade that may be related to that activated by soluble growth factors. Adhesion to fibronectin also stimulates the tyrosine phosphorylation of the focal adhesion kinase (FAK) as well as its association with other signaling molecules (Src and Grb2/SOS) that may promote activation of the Ras signaling pathway (6Schlaepfer D.D. Hanks S.K. Hunter T. van der Geer P. Nature. 1994; 372: 786-791Google Scholar). If so, then integrin-mediated activation of Ras would be expected downstream of FAK and upstream of Erk1/Erk2 activation. Downstream targets for Erk1/Erk2 in the Ras-MAP kinase pathway include numerous potential substrates that fall into one of several categories (4Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14553-14556Google Scholar): first, protein kinases such as p90rsk that are involved in protein translation; second, a group that includes nuclear proteins such as Elk1, a ternary complex factor involved in c-fos induction; finally, cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2), an enzyme that liberates arachidonic acid and its metabolites from glycerolphospholipids. This final group is especially interesting in light of the observation that integrin clustering in HeLa cells induces the release of arachidonic acid metabolites and cell spreading, events that are inhibited by the PLA2 inhibitor bromophenacyl bromide (8Chun J.-S. Jacobson B.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 481-492Google Scholar). What role, if any, signaling molecules of the Ras-MAP kinase pathway play in each of these events remains to be examined, although a role for Ras in integrin-mediated signaling appears likely for two reasons. First, Ras can be found at sites of integrin-clustering (9Miyamoto S. Teramoto H. Coso O.A. Gutkind J.S. Burbelo P.D. Akiyama S.K. Yamada K.M. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 791-805Google Scholar), and, second, treatment of Jurkat cells with integrin antibodies activates Ras (10Kapron-Bras C. Fitz-Gibbon L. Jeevaratnam P. Wilkins J. Dedhar S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20701-20704Google Scholar). However, matrix-dependent activation of Ras has not been shown, and a role for Ras in integrin-dependent activation of MAP kinases remains to be established. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to examine signaling through the Ras-MAP kinase pathway and to determine whether or not this pathway plays a role in integrin-mediated cellular responses such as cell adhesion, spreading, and focal contact and stress fiber formation. We found that Ras is rapidly and transiently activated in fibronectin-adherent NIH3T3 cells, and that this activation precedes the peak of Erk2 activation. To test if integrin-mediated Erk2 activation is Ras-dependent, we expressed a dominant-inhibitory Ras mutant (N17Ras) in NIH3T3 cells and found that it inhibits matrix-dependent activation of Erk2 and cPLA2 and arachidonic acid release, while integrin-dependent activation of FAK is not inhibited by N17Ras. Finally, although N17Ras appears to block the integrin-mediated Ras-MAP kinase pathway, it does not inhibit the formation of focal adhesions and stress fibers. These results suggest that, while integrin-mediated adhesion can activate the Ras-MAP kinase pathway, this pathway is not necessary for integrin-dependent focal contact and stress fiber formation.

After 18 h, the cells were washed with PBS, trypsinized for 1 min, washed twice with DMEM containing 0.5 mg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor and 0.1% bovine serum albumin, and finally suspended in DMEM for 30 min at 37°C before plating the cells on polylysine (0.5 mg/ml)- or fibronectin (10 µg/ml)-coated dishes (prepared as described (11Guan J.-L. Trevithick J.E. Hynes R.O. Cell Regul. 1991; 2: 951-964Google Scholar)). To initiate adhesion, the cells were added to the coated dishes and centrifuged for 30 s at 50 × g. NIH3T3 cells expressing the N17Ras protein under the control of the murine mammary tumor virus promoter were created by cotransfection of pMMRasDN and pLENneo and selected in 500 µg/ml G418. Neomycin-resistant colonies were screened for dexamethasone-inducible expression of N17Ras by immunoblotting using an anti-Ras antibody. Cells were stimulated with 300 nM dexamethasone for 18 h to induce expression of N17Ras. In addition to the two N17Ras-expressing clonal cell lines used for this report (DN1 and DN2), two other clones expressing high levels of N17Ras show results similar to those published herein. Adherent cells were washed twice in PBS and lysed in radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer (1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 158 mM NaCl, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 500 µg/ml leupeptin, 1 mM sodium orthovanadate, 50 mM NaF) for 30 min on ice. The lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 10 min at 4°C, and protein concentration was then determined using a Pierce Micro BCA protein assay kit. One part 4× SDS sample buffer (8% SDS, 2%β-mercaptoethanol, 266 mM Tris, pH 7.2, 40 mM EDTA) was then added to three parts RIPA lysate, the sample was heated to 100°C for 5 min, and 10 µg of protein were run on a 10% acrylamide SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gel. FAK immunoprecipitation was performed using 50 µg of RIPA lysate, the polyclonal antiserum CK, and protein A-Sepharose. Immunoblotting of total cell lysates or immunoprecipitates was performed as described (12Clark E.A. Brugge J.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1863-1871Google Scholar). Serum-starved NIH3T3 cells were labeled for 6 h at 37°C with 300 µCi of 32PO4 per 100-mm dish, trypsinized, washed, and resuspended for 30 min at 37°C in phosphate-free DMEM containing 300 µCi of 32PO4. Next, the cells were added to fibronectin- or polylysine-coated dishes, centrifuged for 30 s at 50 × g, and allowed to adhere at 37°C as described above. Activation of Ras was then assessed by measuring the level of associated guanine nucleotides as described previously (13Vaillancourt R.R. Harwood A.E. Winitz S. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 238: 255-258Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation/kinase assays were performed using 50 µg of RIPA-cell lysates prepared as described above. Erk2 was immunoprecipitated with 10 µg (25 µl) of agarose-conjugated antibody for 90 min at 4°C, and the immunoprecipitates were washed twice in RIPA buffer and twice in kinase wash buffer (20 mM Hepes, pH 7.2, 10 mM MgCl2, 1 mM dithiothreitol). The kinase assays were then performed using the MAP Kinase Assay Kit (Upstate Biotech) according to the manufacturer's directions. Duplicate immunoprecipitates of Erk2 were immunoblotted with the pan-Erk antibody to ensure that equal amounts of Erk2 protein were used in these in vitro kinase assays. Cells labeled with 0.4 µCi/ml [3H]arachidonic acid for 18 h were washed, trypsinized, and replated on fibronectin- or polylysine-coated dishes as described above. After allowing the cells to adhere for 5 min at 37°C, the dishes were rinsed once with prewarmed DMEM, and fresh DMEM was added to the dishes. The cells were returned to the incubator for 0, 5, 10, 15, or 35 additional minutes, and 50 µl of media were removed for scintillation counting. To ensure that equivalent amounts of radiolabeled lipids were present in the parental NIH3T3- and N17Ras-expressing cells, equal numbers of cells were extracted with chloroform, and the radioactivity was determined by scintillation counting. Adherent cells were fixed, permeabilized, and stained as described previously (11Guan J.-L. Trevithick J.E. Hynes R.O. Cell Regul. 1991; 2: 951-964Google Scholar). Several studies have suggested a link between integrin-mediated signaling and the Ras-MAP kinase pathway. Specifically, adhesion of cells to ECM components such as fibronectin induces the activation, tyrosine phosphorylation, and nuclear translocation of MAP kinases through an integrin-dependent mechanism (5Chen Q. Kinch M.S. Lin T.H. Burridge K. Juliano R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26602-26605Google Scholar, 6Schlaepfer D.D. Hanks S.K. Hunter T. van der Geer P. Nature. 1994; 372: 786-791Google Scholar, 7Zhu X. Assoian R.K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 273-282Google Scholar). However, a recent study has concluded that integrin engagement of the ECM is not sufficient to trigger the activation of Erk1 and Erk2 in serum-starved Swiss 3T3 cells (14Hotchin N.A. Hall A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1857-1865Google Scholar). To examine the serum dependence of integrin-mediated MAP kinase activation, NIH3T3 cells were incubated in media containing 0, 0.5, or 10% serum for 18 h before replating in serum-free media on fibronectin-coated dishes for 0 to 40 min. MAP kinase activation was examined by mobility shift assay. As shown in Fig. 1A, we observed an upward gel mobility shift in Erk2 characteristic of its activation and phosphorylation on tyrosine and threonine residues. The shift was rapid, occurring as early as 5 min after plating the cells onto a matrix, and was maximal between 10 and 20 min. The activation of Erk2 was observed even in serum-starved (0%) cell lysates, although activation was somewhat enhanced when cells were maintained in even low levels of serum (0.5%), and higher concentrations of serum (10%) appeared to dampen integrin-mediated Erk2 activation. The observed fibronectin-induced activation of MAP kinase suggested a potential role for activated Ras in integrin-mediated signal transduction (1Clark E.A. Brugge J.S. Science. 1995; 268: 233-239Google Scholar). Therefore, we analyzed the activity state of Ras by quantitating the levels of GTP and GDP associated with Ras in lysates from suspended or fibronectin-adherent NIH3T3 cells (Fig. 1B). A rapid and transient activation of Ras was observed in cells plated onto fibronectin, with the peak of GTP associated with Ras occurring as early as measurable (5 min). Although the percentage of GTP associated with Ras in fibronectin-adherent cells was less than that observed in PDGF-stimulated cells, it was significantly greater than that in suspended or polylysine-adherent cells (Fig. 1B). This peak of Ras activation precedes both cell spreading (which can first be observed 15 min after the cells have been plated onto fibronectin) and the peak of Erk2 activation (see Fig. 1A), suggesting that Ras could regulate integrin-mediated Erk2 activation. However, this correlation does not ensure that Erk2 activation is Ras-dependent. To examine the regulation of fibronectin-induced MAP kinase activation by Ras, NIH3T3 cells were transfected with a dominant-inhibitory mutant of Ras (N17Ras). Expression of N17Ras in cells inhibits the activation of endogenous Ras, presumably by interfering with the exchange of GTP for GDP, and has been shown to block Ras-mediated growth factor signaling (15deVries-Smits A.M.M. Burgering B.M.T. Leevers S.J. Marshall C.J. Bos J.L. Nature. 1992; 357: 602-604Google Scholar). Expression of N17Ras was controlled in these cells by the dexamethasone-inducible murine mammary tumor virus promoter. Parental NIH3T3 cells and two separate clones which expressed relatively low (DN1) and high (DN2) levels of N17Ras when stimulated with dexamethasone for 18 h (see Fig. 2A) were used in subsequent experiments. As shown in Fig. 2A, expression of N17Ras at relatively high levels (DN2) completely inhibited both PDGF- and matrix-dependent upward gel mobility shift characteristic of Erk2 activation. Furthermore, N17Ras inhibited the activation of Erk2 kinase activity (Fig. 2B). Expression of lower levels of N17Ras (DN1) delayed activation of Erk2 (Fig. 2A). The ability of the dominant-inhibitory N17Ras to inhibit fibronectin-mediated activation of Erk2 places this MAP kinase downstream of Ras in integrin as well as growth factor signaling. In an attempt to delineate further the signaling pathway from integrins to Erk2, we examined whether the activation of FAK, a potential upstream mediator of integrin-dependent Ras and MAP kinase activation (6Schlaepfer D.D. Hanks S.K. Hunter T. van der Geer P. Nature. 1994; 372: 786-791Google Scholar), is Ras-dependent. Expression of N17Ras did not inhibit the tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK in fibronectin-adherent cells (Fig. 2C). In fact, when expressed at the highest levels, N17Ras enhanced the tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK. We next examined a potential downstream target for Erk2, cPLA2. Phosphorylation of cPLA2 by MAP kinase, which causes an electrophoretic mobility shift that correlates with an increase in enzymatic activity, is believed to account for the agonist-stimulated activation of cPLA2 (16Lin L.-L. Wartmann M. Lin A.Y. Knopf J.L. Seth A. Davis R.J. Cell. 1993; 72: 269-278Google Scholar). However, several recent studies suggest that MAP kinase-independent pathways exist for cPLA2 activation (17Kramer R.M. Roberts E.F. Hyslop P.A. Utterback B.G. Hui K.Y. Jakubowski J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14816-14823Google Scholar, 18Borsch-Haubold A.G. Kramer R.M. Watson S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25885-25892Google Scholar). When cell lysates from NIH3T3 cells plated onto fibronectin were examined, we observed an upward gel mobility shift characteristic of cPLA2 activation (Fig. 3A), and this activation correlated with the release of arachidonic acid metabolites (Fig. 3B). These results are in agreement with studies in HeLa cells where integrin clustering is believed to induce integrin-dependent arachidonic acid release through activation of cPLA2 (8Chun J.-S. Jacobson B.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 481-492Google Scholar). Expression of the dominant-inhibitory N17Ras completely blocked the upward gel mobility shift indicative of cPLA2 activation and significantly inhibited the release of arachidonic acid metabolites (by 80% at the 20-min time point; see Fig. 3), indicating that Ras mediates integrin-dependent cPLA2 activation and arachidonic acid release in NIH3T3 cells. Having established that integrin-mediated activation of both Erk2 and cPLA2 is Ras-dependent while FAK phosphorylation is not, we next addressed the question of how these signaling events might control morphological events such as cell spreading or focal contact and stress fiber formation. Since microinjection of Ras stimulates focal contact and stress fiber formation (19Ridley A.J. Paterson H.F. Johnston C.L. Diekmann D. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 401-410Google Scholar), it is plausible that Ras might control some aspect of integrin-mediated morphology. In addition, arachidonic acid metabolites are reported to be necessary for cell spreading (8Chun J.-S. Jacobson B.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 481-492Google Scholar) and actin remodeling (20Peppelenbosch M.P. Tertoolen L.G.J. Hage W.J. de Laat S.W. Cell. 1993; 74: 565-575Google Scholar), suggesting a role for Ras in these morphological changes. However, cells expressing the highest levels of N17Ras (DN2) were fully able to adhere, spread, and form focal contacts and stress fibers when plated on fibronectin (see Fig. 4). In fact, expression of N17Ras appears to enhance slightly vinculin-containing focal contacts, although heterogeneity is observed in the morphology of these cells. These results suggest that the Ras-MAP kinase-cPLA2-arachidonic acid pathway described in this report is not necessary for the formation of integrin-dependent morphological structures in NIH3T3 cells. Although many cellular processes are known to be matrix-dependent, the contributions of signals transduced by integrins have only begun to be explored. The ability of integrins to activate MAP kinases suggested a link to the Ras signaling pathway (5Chen Q. Kinch M.S. Lin T.H. Burridge K. Juliano R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26602-26605Google Scholar, 6Schlaepfer D.D. Hanks S.K. Hunter T. van der Geer P. Nature. 1994; 372: 786-791Google Scholar, 7Zhu X. Assoian R.K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 273-282Google Scholar). In this report, we have shown directly that adhesion of fibroblastic cells to a defined matrix can indeed activate Ras. This result is in agreement with another study in which treatment of lymphoid cells with integrin antibodies activates Ras (10Kapron-Bras C. Fitz-Gibbon L. Jeevaratnam P. Wilkins J. Dedhar S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20701-20704Google Scholar) and suggests a potential pathway for integrin-dependent activation of MAP kinases. Using a dominant-inhibitory strategy, we have shown directly that integrin-dependent, growth factor-independent activation of Erk2 in NIH3T3 cells is Ras-dependent. Furthermore, cPLA2 appears to be a substrate for a Ras-activated kinase, presumably Erk2, and the release of arachidonic acid metabolites upon matrix adhesion is, in large part, Ras-dependent. However, in contrast with some previous suggestions, this pathway does not appear to regulate integrin-dependent morphological changes that occur when cells engage the ECM. Why is integrin-dependent activation of the Ras-MAP kinase pathway important? First, it may play a role in regulating integrin-dependent gene expression. Adhesion of suspension-arrested cells induces the rapid expression of several genes including c-fos, a component of AP1 complexes (21Dike L.E. Farmer S.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 6792-6796Google Scholar). Activation of the Ras-MAP kinase cascade is known to induce MAP kinase phosphorylation of Elk1 and increase the transcriptional activation of c-fos. These events then regulate the activity of the AP-1 complex, thereby controlling cell proliferation (22Karin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16483-16486Google Scholar). In this way, integrin-dependent activation of this pathway could regulate adhesion-dependent cell growth. Our results suggest that this integrin-dependent MAP kinase pathway converges with growth factor signaling at least at the level of Ras, perhaps through the formation of signaling complexes that integrate signals from integrins and growth factor receptors (23Plopper G.E. McNamee H.P. Dike L.E. Bojanowski K. Ingber D.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 1349-1365Google Scholar). Second, Ras might be responsible for regulating cytoskeletal rearrangements involved in cell adhesion, spreading, and/or focal contact and stress fiber formation. Activated Ras can trigger a cascade which induces morphological changes such as membrane ruffling (19Ridley A.J. Paterson H.F. Johnston C.L. Diekmann D. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 401-410Google Scholar). However, Ras appears to do so through a MAP kinase-independent pathway (24Joneson T. White M.A. Wigler M.H. Bar-Sagi D. Science. 1996; 271: 810-812Google Scholar). Furthermore, while there is considerable evidence that Ras can activate a signaling cascade (that includes the Rho family of small GTP-binding proteins) which regulates cytoskeletal dynamics (25Vojtek A.B. Cooper J.A. Cell. 1995; 82: 527-529Google Scholar), our observation that Ras inhibition does not prevent integrin-dependent cell adhesion, spreading, or focal contact and stress fiber formation in NIH3T3 cells suggests that a Ras-MAP kinase-independent pathway exists for these morphological events. Ras has also been implicated in the growth factor-induced release of arachidonic acid (26Bar-Sagi D. Feramisco J.R. Science. 1986; 233: 1061-1068Google Scholar, 27Warner L.C. Hack N. Egan S.E. Goldberg H.J. Weinberg R.A. Scorecki K.L. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 3249-3255Google Scholar), and this is supported by our observation that the adhesion-dependent activation of cPLA2 and subsequent arachidonic acid release are Ras-dependent. However, our results suggest that this pathway is not essential for integrin-dependent adhesion or spreading of NIH3T3 cells on a fibronectin matrix. This observation is in contrast with previous studies in which arachidonic acid metabolites were reported to be essential for the spreading of HeLa cells on a collagen matrix (8Chun J.-S. Jacobson B.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 481-492Google Scholar, 28Auer K.L. Jacobson B.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 1305-1313Google Scholar). The observed differences may be due to the different cell types, matrix proteins, and/or integrin receptors engaged in these studies; it is also possible that the reduced levels of arachidonic acid released by our cells expressing N17Ras may be sufficient to allow the cells to spread. While our results indicate that actin rearrangements induced by engagement of integrins are Ras-independent, these events may nonetheless be mediated by Rho family members Rac and Rho which are essential for epidermal growth factor-induced actin stress fiber formation (29Peppelenbosch M.P. Qui R.-G. deVries-Smits A.M.M. Tertoolen L.G.J. de Laat S.W. McCormick F. Hall A. Symons M.H. Bos J.L. Cell. 1995; 81: 849-856Google Scholar). Both Rac and Rho stimulate actin polymerization through regulation of phosphatidylinositol metabolism, although the precise targets remain to be identified (30Hartwig J.H. Bokoch G.M. Carpenter C.L. Janmey P.A. Taylor L.A. Toker A. Stossel T.P. Cell. 1995; 82: 643-653Google Scholar, 31Chong L.D. Traynor-Kaplan A. Bokoch G.M. Schwartz M.A. Cell. 1994; 79: 507-513Google Scholar). Hotchin and Hall (14Hotchin N.A. Hall A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1857-1865Google Scholar) have recently shown that the formation of focal contacts requires an interaction of integrins with the ECM and a functionally active Rho which, in Swiss 3T3 cells, must be activated by serum factors. However, in NIH3T3 cells it appears either that serum starvation is not sufficient to turn off Rho or that Rho is activated upon engagement of integrins, or that integrin-dependent actin rearrangements are Rho-independent. Although it is presently unknown how actin rearrangements induced by integrin engagement and clustering may be mediated by Rho family members, future studies may aid in defining where integrin-dependent signaling pathways regulating cell morphology diverge from those regulating cell growth; we now know that they do so upstream of the Ras-MAP kinase pathway. We are grateful to Joan Brugge for the gift of pMMRasDN, to Jun-Lin Guan for the anti-FAK antibody, to members of the Hynes laboratory for critical reading of the manuscript, and to Colleen Leslie."
https://openalex.org/W1968956158,"Abstract A Mg2+-independent phosphatidate phosphohydrolase was purified from rat liver plasma membranes in two distinct forms, an anionic protein and a cationic protein. Both forms of the enzyme dephosphorylated phosphatidate, ceramide 1-phosphate, lysophosphatidate, and sphingosine 1-phosphate. When assayed at a constant molar ratio of lipid to Triton X-100 of 1:500, the apparent Km values of the anionic phosphohydrolase for the lipid substrates was 3.5, 1.9, 0.4, and 4.0 μM, respectively. The relative catalytic efficiency of the enzyme for phosphatidate, ceramide 1-phosphate, lysophosphatidate, and sphingosine 1-phosphate was 0.16, 0.14, 0.48, and 0.04 liter (min·mg)−1, respectively. The hydrolysis of phosphatidate was inhibited competitively by ceramide 1-phosphate, lysophosphatidate, and sphingosine 1-phosphate. The Ki(app) values were 5.5, 5.9, and 4.0 μM, respectively. The hydrolysis of phosphatidate by the phosphohydrolase conformed to a surface dilution kinetic model. It is concluded that the enzyme is a lipid phosphomonoesterase that could modify the balance of phosphatidate, ceramide 1-phosphate, lysophosphatidate, and sphingosine 1-phosphate relative to diacylglycerol, ceramide, monoacylglycerol, and sphingosine, respectively. The enzyme could thus play an important role in regulating cell activation and signal transduction."
https://openalex.org/W2054390123,"We have previously shown that oxidized low density lipoprotein (LDL) but not native LDL stimulated DNA synthesis in cultured smooth muscle cells (SMC) and that α-tocopherol (vitamin E) inhibited this proliferative response (Lafont, A., Chai, Y.

The moiety of oxidized LDL that stimulates DNA synthesis and the cellular mechanism for this potentially mitogenic effect are not known. We now report that lipid fractions containing lysophospholipids from oxidized LDL or phospholipase A2-treated native LDL stimulated SMC DNA synthesis as did palmitoyl lysophosphatidylcholine (lysoPC). Protein kinase C inhibitors and down-regulation of protein kinase C activity by phorbol ester inhibited oxidized LDL- and lysoPC-induced DNA synthesis. A neutralizing monoclonal antibody against fibroblast growth factor-2 significantly inhibited oxidized LDL and lysoPC-induced DNA synthesis in SMC; irrelevant antibodies were ineffective. Vitamin E inhibited the DNA synthesis stimulated by lysoPC, an observation that distinguished this effect from DNA synthesis induced by another detergent, digitonin. These results suggest that oxidized LDL and its lysoPC moiety stimulate SMC to enter the cell cycle via an oxidative mechanism that causes the release of fibroblast growth factor-2 and a subsequent autocrine or paracrine response.

Andalibi A. Territo M.C. Berliner J.A. Navab M. Fogelman A.M. Lusis A.J. Nature. 1990; 344: 254-257Google Scholar), and stimulation of increased DNA synthesis in macrophages (22Yui S. Sasaki T. Miyazaki A. Horiuchi S. Yamazaki M. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1993; 13: 331-337Google Scholar) and smooth muscle cells (23Chatterjee S. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1992; 111: 143-147Google Scholar, 24Heery J.M. Kozak M. Stafforini D.M. Jones D.A. Zimmerman G.A. McIntyre T.M. Prescott S.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 2322-2330Google Scholar, 25Lafont A. Chai Y.C. Cornhill J.F. Whitlow P.L. Howe P.H. Chisolm G.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 1018-1025Google Scholar). In some studies oxidized LDL-induced increases in cell number were also reported; however, in some, mitogenic levels of serum were also present (26Auge N. Pieraggi M.-T. Thiers J.-C. Negre-Salvayre A. Salvayre R. Biochem. J. 1995; 309: 1015-1020Google Scholar) and in others cells were not previously rendered quiescent (23Chatterjee S. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1992; 111: 143-147Google Scholar), leaving ambiguous the role of oxidized LDL as a mitogen. In the present studies we sought to elucidate further the oxidized LDL-induced stimulation of DNA synthesis in vascular SMC by testing whether the DNA synthesis led to cell cycle entry, by identifying a lipoprotein moiety responsible for the induction of DNA synthesis, and by determining the mechanism by which this effect is brought about. Our results suggest that oxidized LDL does indeed cause these cells to enter the cell cycle, that lysophosphatidylcholine, a component of oxidized LDL, is a potential contributor to the proliferative stimulation, and that the mechanism does not appear to require grossly detectable cell injury, but it depends at least in part on an autocrine or paracrine response elicited by the release of fibroblast growth factor (FGF-2). [8-14C]Adenine (46-60 mCi/mmol), [methyl-3H]thymidine (6.7 Ci/mmol), and [3H]leucine (130 Ci/mmol) were obtained from ICN (Irvine, CA). EDTA, isopropanol, hexane, ethanol, acetone, methanol, and chloroform were purchased from Fisher. A mixture of equal parts of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) and Ham's F-12 medium (DMEM/F-12) was purchased from Irvine Scientific (Irvine, CA). Phospholipase A2 from bee venom and other reagents were from Sigma. Silica cartridges were obtained from Waters (Millford, MA). A monoclonal neutralizing antibody against FGF-2 and recombinant FGF-2 were obtained from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) was obtained from Austral Biologicals (San Ramon, CA). A neutralizing antibody against TGF-β1 was obtained from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Palmitoyl lysoPC was obtained from Doosan Serdary Research Laboratories (Englewood Cliffs, NJ). Inhibitors of protein kinases, H-7, HA-1004, calphostin C, H-89, and GF 109203X were obtained from BIOMOL Research Laboratories, Inc. (Plymouth Meeting, PA). LDL (1.019 g/ml ≤ solvent density ≤ 1.063 g/ml) was prepared by sequential ultracentrifugation from pooled, citrated human plasma according to a modification (8Chisolm G.M. Ma G. Irwin K.C. Martin L.L. Gunderson K.G. Linberg L.F. Morel D.W. DiCorleto P.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11452-11456Google Scholar) of the method of Hatch and Lees (27Hatch F.T. Lees R.S. Adv. Lipid Res. 1968; 6: 1-68Google Scholar). Oxidized LDL was prepared by dialyzing native LDL against isotonic saline (pH 7.0-8.0) containing 5 µM CuSO4 at room temperature until the characteristic color change occurred from golden to yellow to translucent without color (9Coffey M.D. Cole R.A. Colles S.M. Chisolm G.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 1866-1873Google Scholar). The oxidation was stopped, and the lipoprotein bound metal ion was removed (28Kuzuya M. Naito M. Funaki C. Hayashi T. Asai K. Kuzuya F. J. Lipid Res. 1991; 32: 197-204Google Scholar, 29Thomas C.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1128: 50-57Google Scholar) by dialyzing against isotonic saline containing 0.5 mM EDTA at 4°C with at least three changes of dialysate. LysoPC was measured in two representative preparations of oxidized LDL according to the method of Nakamura and Handa (30Nakamura K. Handa S. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 142: 406-410Google Scholar) and found to be 20 and 25 µg/100 µg of oxidized LDL cholesterol. To hydrolyze LDL phospholipids, EDTA was removed by dialysis from native LDL (4.2 mg cholesterol/ml), which was then incubated with 45 mM Tris, pH 8.5, 2.5 mM CaCl2, and 14 units/ml of phospholipase A2 at 37°C for 2 h according to a modification of the method of Quinn et al. (31Quinn M.T. Parthasarathy S. Steinberg D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2805-2809Google Scholar). To stop the reaction, 50 mM EDTA, pH 8.0, was added to the mixture, and excess EDTA was removed by alternatively washing and concentrating the lipoprotein preparation using centrifugation with Centricon 10 filters (Amicon, Beverly, MA). Lipid extraction from both oxidized LDL and phospholipase A2-LDL were carried out as described (32Mangin Jr., E.L. Kugiyama K. Nguy J.H. Kerns S.A. Henry P.D. Circ. Res. 1993; 72: 161-166Google Scholar) using methanol and chloroform as solvents. The lipid extract from native LDL was used as a control. Lipids were fractionated using silica cartridges and collected as described previously (31Quinn M.T. Parthasarathy S. Steinberg D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2805-2809Google Scholar). Fractions were dissolved in acetone:ethanol (1:1) before adding to cells at solvent concentrations ≤0.4% of medium volume. Vascular SMC (passages 3-10) were obtained from explants of rabbit aorta using procedures described previously (33Ross R. J. Cell Biol. 1971; 50: 172-186Google Scholar). SMC were grown in DMEM/F-12 medium with 10% fetal bovine serum and incubated at 37°C, 5% CO2 in air. Cells were plated into 24-well plates at 20,000-25,000 cells/well and allowed to reach 90% confluence before making them quiescent. In some experiments, quiescence was achieved by replacing the medium with DMEM/F-12 medium containing 0.25% fetal bovine serum for 2 days; in others, serum-free DMEM/F-12 medium was used. [3H]Thymidine incorporation into DNA was determined by adding 1 µCi/ml [methyl-3H]thymidine for the last 6 h of a 26-h exposure to agents being tested for stimulation. After removing radioactive medium, cells were washed twice with ice-cold 10% trichloroacetic acid. Trichloroacetic acid-insoluble material was hydrolyzed by 0.25 N NaOH, and radioactivity was assayed in a liquid scintillation counter. To examine the effects of vitamin E or various antibodies on DNA synthesis, cells were treated with these agents for 2 h before as well as after adding stimuli. A neutralizing antibody against FGF-2 was used that according to the supplier does not cross-react with acidic FGF (FGF-1). SMC were pretreated with phorbol myristate acetate (200 nM) for 48 h or inhibitors of protein kinases, H-7, HA-1004, calphostin C, H-89, and GF 109203X for 30 min to explore the role of protein kinase C in the observed DNA synthesis increases. To evaluate cell protein synthesis as an indirect indicator of cell injury, [3H]leucine (2 µCi/ml) was added 20 h after of addition of lysoPC, inhibitors of protein kinases, or other test agents. After another 6 h, cells were processed and radioactivity incorporated into cells was determined as described above for DNA synthesis. As another assessment of cell injury, cell permeabilization was determined by the specific release of 14C-labeled products from cells previously loaded with [14C]adenine as described (34Shirhatti V. Krishna G. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 147: 410-418Google Scholar). Briefly, quiescent SMC were exposed to [14C]adenine (0.2 µCi/ml) for 16 h. Before treating cells with putatively injurious agents, radioactive medium was removed, and cells were rinsed twice with DMEM/F-12 containing 0.25% fetal bovine serum. After a 26-h incubation, medium was sampled from each well and assayed using a liquid scintillation counter. The maximal 14C release (100%) was obtained from cells lysed with Triton X-100; the minimum release (calculated to be 0%) was from untreated (control) cells. The specific release, expressed as a percentage, was calculated as (cpm released from treated cells − cpm released from untreated cells) divided by (cpm released by Triton − cpm released from untreated cells) (35Kosugi K. Morel D.W. DiCorleto P.E. Chisolm G.M. J. Cell. Physiol. 1987; 130: 311-320Google Scholar). To examine the effect of vitamin E, cells were treated with vitamin E for 2 h before as well as after adding the agents indicated. [3H]Thymidine (1 µCi/ml) was pulsed for the last 6 h of a 26-h incubation with serum or lysoPC. After removing medium, cells were processed for nuclear autoradiography by coating with Kodak type NTB-2 emulsion after fixing cells with cold 100% methanol as described previously (36Howe P.H. Draetta G. Leof E.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 1185-1194Google Scholar). We have previously shown that oxidized LDL increased [3H]thymidine incorporation into DNA in quiescent smooth muscle cells and that vitamin E blunted this response but not the response to serum (25Lafont A. Chai Y.C. Cornhill J.F. Whitlow P.L. Howe P.H. Chisolm G.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 1018-1025Google Scholar). We wished to determine the oxidized LDL entity(ies) responsible for the effect. We performed silica column fractionation of oxidized LDL lipids according to a previously published protocol (31Quinn M.T. Parthasarathy S. Steinberg D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2805-2809Google Scholar), in which various solvents were used to elute four general classes of lipids, containing, respectively, cholesteryl esters and triglycerides, cholesterol, free (and oxidized) fatty acids, and phospholipids. These were collected, dried under nitrogen, redissolved as indicated under “Experimental Procedures,” and added to rabbit SMC at concentrations indexed to the original lipoprotein. The most active among the oxidized LDL fractions in enhancing 3H-thymidine incorporation was the fourth fraction as shown in Fig. 1. This fraction was previously shown (31Quinn M.T. Parthasarathy S. Steinberg D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2805-2809Google Scholar) and confirmed by TLC (30Nakamura K. Handa S. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 142: 406-410Google Scholar) in our laboratory to include phospholipids and lysophospholipids. Lysophospholipids are produced as LDL oxidizes (37Parthasarathy S. Steinbrecher U.P. Barnett J. Witztum J.L. Steinberg D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 3000-3004Google Scholar), and we tested whether the stimulating activity of oxidized LDL could be in part due to lysophospholipids. The lipids of phospholipase A2-treated native LDL were also fractionated and collected according to the same method used for oxidized LDL lipids. Again, the most potent fraction in stimulating DNA synthesis was that containing lysophospholipids (data not shown). In addition, as shown in Fig. 2A, synthetic palmitoyl lysoPC at concentrations approximately within the range expected to be present in the levels of oxidized LDL for which we observed activity (38Locher R. Weisser B. Mengden T. Brunner C. Vetter W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 183: 156-162Google Scholar) also increased DNA synthesis. As expected, at toxic concentrations of lysoPC (e.g. 30 µM), there is no enchanced DNA synthesis. LysoPC thus appeared to be one lipid formed during LDL oxidation that is capable of contributing to the increase in DNA synthesis. This assertion was strengthened by the fact that vitamin E blunted the enhanced DNA synthesis caused by lysoPC, as shown in Fig. 2B, at vitamin E concentrations shown previously to blunt this effect by oxidized LDL (25Lafont A. Chai Y.C. Cornhill J.F. Whitlow P.L. Howe P.H. Chisolm G.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 1018-1025Google Scholar). The inhibition was also observed after overnight treatment of cells with 50 µM vitamin E and extensive washing (three times with medium) prior to adding lysoPC (data not shown).Fig. 2A, DNA synthesis increases in vascular smooth muscle cells after the addition of palmitoyl lysophosphatidylcholine. Quiescent SMC were treated with palmitoyl lysoPC for 26 h, and [3H]thymidine was added between 20 and 26 h. Cell-associated radioactivity was quantified. The data are expressed as the means ± standard deviations. B, vitamin E inhibits the increased DNA synthesis induced by lysophosphatidylcholine. Quiescent SMC were pretreated with 50 µM vitamin E (hatched bar) for 2 h and treated with 15 µM lysoPC and vitamin E for 26 h. Parallel groups of SMC received lysoPC alone, vitamin E alone, or neither. [3H]Thymidine incorporation was quantified between 20 and 26 h. Vitamin E significantly lowered lysoPC-induced DNA synthesis. *, p < 0.01. The data are expressed as the means ± standard deviations.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) We then sought whether the increased DNA synthesis evoked in SMC by oxidized LDL or lysoPC was, in fact, related to cell cycle progression or whether the enhanced [3H]thymidine incorporation was due to a distinct, nonproliferative response. Several approaches were taken. Cells made quiescent by 48 h of serum deprivation were exposed to oxidized LDL, lysoPC, or serum and [3H]thymidine incorporation was measured as a function of time. Although as expected the response of cells to oxidized LDL or lysoPC was not of the same magnitude as that of cells exposed to serum (9Coffey M.D. Cole R.A. Colles S.M. Chisolm G.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 1866-1873Google Scholar), the time course of thymidine incorporation was the same as after serum stimulation; that is, the peak thymidine incorporation occurred at approximately 28 h from the addition of oxidized LDL, lysoPC, or serum (data not shown). Thus, cells responded temporally to oxidized LDL or lysoPC as they respond to known mitogens. As a second approach, autoradiography was performed on cell cultures 26 h after exposure to lysoPC. The number of labeled cells after exposure to lysoPC was significantly higher than that in unstimulated controls (p < 0.01), and the labeling was clearly nuclear (data not shown). Third, we tested pharmacologically whether the enhanced [3H]thymidine incorporation may have been due to DNA repair after lysoPC-induced DNA damage. Inhibitors of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase were added to cell cultures in concentrations shown to inhibit this DNA repair enzyme in other cell systems after exposure to levels of H2O2 that damage DNA (39Schraufstatter I.U. Hyslop P.A. Hinshaw D.B. Spagg R.G. Sklar L.A. Cochrane C.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 4908-4912Google Scholar). Toxicity of the inhibitors, as discerned from 14C release from [14C]adenine loaded cells, was also measured to avoid misinterpreting blunted DNA responses secondary to cell injury as being due to inhibited DNA repair. Nontoxic levels of 3-aminobenzamide and nicotinamide, up to 5 and 2.5 mM, respectively, did not blunt lysoPC- or FGF-2-induced (as control) increases in [3H]thymidine incorporation (data not shown). In control experiments, we verified that these agents inhibited H2O2 (1 mM) induced toxicity in our cell system, as reported by Schraufstatter et al. (39Schraufstatter I.U. Hyslop P.A. Hinshaw D.B. Spagg R.G. Sklar L.A. Cochrane C.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 4908-4912Google Scholar) in P388D1 cells. (They showed that inhibition of H2O2 toxicity was secondary to blocking of DNA repair by poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase.) Finally, we arrested cells late in G1, approximately 2 h prior to the beginning of S phase by exposing the cells to 10 ng/ml TGF-β1 (40Reddy K.B. Howe P.H. J. Cell. Physiol. 1993; 156: 48-55Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3, increased DNA synthesis in TGF-β1-arrested cells was inhibited after exposure to either lysoPC or serum (as control), suggesting further that the increased DNA synthesis observed after lysoPC addition was due to cells entering S phase. Collectively, these four experimental results are consistent with the concept that the increased thymidine incorporation following oxidized LDL or lysoPC exposure reflects transit into S phase of the cell cycle. In order to gain insights into the mechanism, we tested whether stimulation by lysoPC or oxidized LDL followed cell signaling pathways used by well characterized polypeptide growth factors. We examined if the inhibition of PKC activation blunted S phase entry in response to oxidized LDL or lysoPC. Down-regulation of PKC was achieved by a 48-h exposure of cells to phorbol myristate acetate (200 nM) (41Jougasaki M. Kugiyama K. Saito Y. Nakao K. Imura H. Yasue H. Circ. Res. 1992; 71: 614-619Google Scholar), after which cells were exposed to oxidized LDL or lysoPC. Down-regulation of PKC blunted the DNA synthesis response of both agonists (Fig. 4). Consistent with these findings, concentrations of PKC inhibitors that were verified to be nontoxic for these smooth muscle cells, were shown to inhibit DNA synthesis. (Cytotoxicity of the inhibitors was measured using [3H]leucine incorporation into cell protein measured between 20 and 26 h after exposure of cells to the inhibitors, as well as specific 14C release during a 26-h exposure to the inhibitors of cells preloaded with [14C]adenine.) Calphostin C (1 µM) and H7 (20 µM) but not HA-1004 or H-89 (5 µM) markedly inhibited oxidized LDL-induced DNA synthesis. H7 (10 µM) and GF 109203X (5 µM) inhibited lysoPC-induced DNA synthesis. (HA-1004 and H-89, used here as controls, do not typically inhibit PKC at the concentrations used; they predominately inhibit protein kinase G and protein kinase A, respectively.) We then tested whether a polypeptide growth factor might be involved as an intermediate, autocrine, or paracrine mediator of the proliferative response to oxidized LDL or lysoPC. We reasoned that the absence of a delay in DNA synthesis between oxidized LDL or lysoPC and serum reported above suggested that release of a stored growth factor was more likely involved than induction of de novo growth factor synthesis and subsequent release. Because FGF-2 is known to be stored in SMC (42Klagsbrun M. Edelman E. Arteriosclerosis. 1989; 9: 269-278Google Scholar), we stimulated cells with oxidized LDL, lysoPC, or FGF-2 in the presence and the absence of a neutralizing monoclonal antibody to FGF-2, as well as two control antibodies, a neutralizing monoclonal antibody to TGF-β1, and an irrelevant monoclonal IgG preparation. The antibody to FGF-2 but neither of the control antibodies significantly inhibited the DNA synthesis responses to oxidized LDL by 50%, lysoPC by 80%, and FGF-2 by 100%, as shown in Fig. 5. We verified that FGF-2-induced DNA synthesis in SMC is a PKC-dependent pathway as reported by other groups (43Kent K.C. Mii S. Harrington E.O. Chang J.D. Mallette S. Ware J.A. Circ. Res. 1995; 77: 231-238Google Scholar), because at subtoxic concentrations, GF 109203X (10 µM) and H-7 (20 µM) inhibited the mitogenic effect of FGF-2 (data not shown). Interestingly, vitamin E (50 µM), which we showed to be capable of inhibiting lysoPC and oxidized LDL-induced DNA synthesis, did not inhibit the FGF-2-induced response in SMC (data not shown). This suggested that the vitamin E inhibitable step in the oxidized LDL or lysoPC induction was prior to stimulation by FGF-2. To test further the participation of FGF-2, we used an immortalized rabbit SMC line that overproduces FGF-2 that we obtained from Dr. Gene Liau. He and co-workers recently characterized this cell line, validating the overproduction of FGF-2 using RNA gel blot hybridization, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, and Western blotting (44Winkles J.A. Friesel R. Alberts G.F. Janat M.F. Liau G. Am. J. Pathol. 1993; 143: 518-527Google Scholar). The experiment shown in Fig. 6 demonstrated that lysoPC markedly enhanced DNA synthesis in these SMC but to much higher levels than in our typical cultured rabbit SMC. The response was inhibitable by vitamin E and a neutralizing antibody to FGF-2, indicating that the mechanism for increased DNA synthesis by lysoPC is the same in these cells as in typical cultured SMC but that the response is much higher in magnitude. LysoPC added at 15 µM to quiescent cells resulted in a 40% increase in cell number over unstimulated cells in this SMC (p < 0.02). A preparation of oxidized LDL, added at a concentration (80 µg/ml) that did not cause a detectable increase in DNA synthesis when added to typical quiescent SMC, caused a 5-fold increase in DNA synthesis in the FGF-2 overproducing cell line over the unstimulated cells of this line (data not shown). Others have suggested that FGF-2, which lacks a signal peptide for secretion, may be released in response to cell injury (45Fukuo K. Inoue T. Morimoto S. Nakahashi T. Yasuda O. Kitano S. Sasada R. Ogihara T. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 669-676Google Scholar). Both oxidized LDL and lysoPC are known to injure cells, and vitamin E has been shown to inhibit the injury induced by oxidized LDL (9Coffey M.D. Cole R.A. Colles S.M. Chisolm G.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 1866-1873Google Scholar) and lysoPC. 2S. M. Colles and G. M. Chisolm, unpublished data. We thus tested whether the DNA synthesis in response to lysoPC was secondary to and whether it required cell injury or whether vitamin E inhibition of cell cycle progression was secondary to protection against cell injury. Cell injury was inferred from decreased cellular protein synthesis and from increased specific 14C release from cells preloaded with [14C]adenine, a measure of cell membrane permeabilization. Cells were exposed to lysoPC at concentrations ranging from 2.5 to 50 µM with and without treatment with 50 µM vitamin E, which was added 2 h prior to the addition of lysoPC and was also present concurrently. Fig. 7A indicates that very slight (<10%) cell permeabilization was detectable at 15 µM but none was detected at lower concentrations; 14C release approached maximum toxicity at 50 µM. Vitamin E was able to prevent the toxic effects of lysoPC over the time frame examined (26 h) at these concentrations. At 15 µM and lower lysoPC concentrations, there was no decrease in cell protein synthesis measured 20-26 h after lysoPC addition (Fig. 7B). Increased DNA synthesis was clearly detectable at the subtoxic lysoPC concentrations of 10 µM and 15 µM (Fig. 2). Stimulation of [3H]thymidine incorporation at these subtoxic levels is also FGF-2-mediated, because the neutralizing antibody against FGF-2 inhibited this effect (Fig. 5). These results suggested that the mechanism for the proliferative effect of lysoPC did not require mortal cell injury but did not rule out a more subtle, transient membrane destabilization. Increased DNA synthesis due to exposure to lysoPC has been previously reported in rat vascular SMC and attributed to a “detergent” effect on cell membranes by analogy with the effect of the detergent digitonin (46Chen Y. Morimoto S. Kitano S. Koh E. Fukuo K. Jiang B. Chen S. Yasuda O. Hirotani A. Ogihara T. Atherosclerosis. 1995; 112: 69-76Google Scholar). We confirmed that [3H]thymidine incorporation was also enhanced in our smooth mucle cells by digitonin (1 µM), but unlike the effect of lysoPC, the enchanced DNA synthesis by digitonin was not inhibited by vitamin E (Fig. 8), suggesting distinct mechanisms of action. Our results indicate that enhanced DNA synthesis by oxidized LDL is linked to cell cycle entry, that one of the oxidized LDL components that can induce this response is lysoPC, and that the mechanism, at least in part, involves an autocrine or paracrine action of the oxidized LDL- or lysoPC-induced release of FGF-2. The phenomenon may have biological relevance in cell populations in which lipid oxidation products are formed, such as inflammation sites, early vascular lesions, or other situations in which lysoPC is generated, for example, as a result of phospholipase A2 action. Our conclusion that lysoPC was one of the components of oxidized LDL that induced cell cycle entry is based on multiple findings. The fractions from silica column elutions known to contain phospholipids and lysophospholipids were the most active fractions of oxidized LDL and phospholipase A2-treated LDL. (Intact phospholipase A2-LDL did not increase DNA synthesis, consistent with the fact that this preparation would have sufficient vitamin E to inhibit the response.) Palmitoyl lysoPC, reported to be the principal lysophospholipid formed during LDL oxidation (37Parthasarathy S. Steinbrecher U.P. Barnett J. Witztum J.L. Steinberg D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 3000-3004Google Scholar), was effective in increasing DNA synthesis at concentrations shown by other laboratories (38Locher R. Weisser B. Mengden T. Brunner C. Vetter W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 183: 156-162Google Scholar) and confirmed by us using quantitative TLC to be present on oxidized LDL. Furthermore, as with oxidized LDL, the DNA synthesis increase by lysoPC was inhibited by vitamin E and a neutralizing antibody to FGF-2. Proliferative responses to lysoPC have been reported previously but may be cell-specific. Palmitoyl lysoPC alone did not have a mitogenic effect on macrophages (47Sakai M. Miyazaki A. Hakamata H. Sasaki T. Yui S. Yamazaki M. Shichiri M. Horiuchi S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31430-31435Google Scholar) and T-lymphocytes (48Asaoka Y. Oka M. Yoshida K. Sasaki Y. Nishizuka Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6447-6451Google Scholar); however, it stimulated DNA synthesis in rat vascular SMC, and this effect appeared to be related to Ca2+ influx (46Chen Y. Morimoto S. Kitano S. Koh E. Fukuo K. Jiang B. Chen S. Yasuda O. Hirotani A. Ogihara T. Atherosclerosis. 1995; 112: 69-76Google Scholar). That lysoPC is not the sole mediator of the increased DNA synthesis in SMC by oxidized LDL is suggested by the recent report that a platelet-activating factor-like activity present in oxidized LDL, distinct from lysoPC, is also capable of stimulating DNA synthesis increase in SMC (24Heery J.M. Kozak M. Stafforini D.M. Jones D.A. Zimmerman G.A. McIntyre T.M. Prescott S.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 2322-2330Google Scholar). Because of structural similarities between platelet-activating factor and lysoPC, one might speculate that mechanisms of stimulation may be similar for the two, but this awaits further experimentation. Increases in [3H]thymidine incorporation induced by oxidized LDL or lysoPC could theoretically be due to cell responses distinct from the DNA synthesis phase of the cell cycle, for example, DNA strand breaks leading to DNA repair. The following lines of evidence from our results suggest that the DNA synthesis induced by oxidized LDL or lysoPC was, in fact, cell cycle-related. (a) One could expect that if the [3H]thymidine incorporation in oxidized LDL- or lysoPC-treated smooth muscle cells were due to effects other than stimulation into cell cycle, the peak of DNA synthesis would not be contemporaneous with that following known growth factors. Our results reveal that the time course for DNA synthesis, including that the time of peak incorporation of labeled thymidine was the same for oxidized LDL, lysoPC, serum, and FGF-2. (b) Inhibitors of DNA repair enzymes would be expected to block lysoPC-induced DNA synthesis related to the repair of DNA damage but would not be expected to block growth factor-induced DNA synthesis. Neither 3-aminobenzamide nor nicotinamide, given at the concentrations shown to inhibit poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase in other cell systems (39Schraufstatter I.U. Hyslop P.A. Hinshaw D.B. Spagg R.G. Sklar L.A. Cochrane C.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 4908-4912Google Scholar) blocked lysoPC- or FGF-2-induced DNA synthesis. (c) Autoradiography showed that the number of labeled cells after exposure to lysoPC significantly exceeded that in unstimulated wells and that the labeling was in fact in the nuclei of smooth muscle cells. (d) TGF-β1 is known to block cell cycle progression, including in SMC (40Reddy K.B. Howe P.H. J. Cell. Physiol. 1993; 156: 48-55Google Scholar) in late G1, approximately 2 h prior to cell entry into S phase. TGF-β1 will thus inhibit growth factor-induced [3H]thymidine incorporation, but it would not be expected to inhibit [3H]thymidine incorporation in nonmitogenic events. TGF-β1 inhibited lysoPC-induced DNA synthesis, as well as that stimulated by serum. In addition, the inhibition of protein kinase C activation, a step in known mitogenic signaling pathways in smooth muscle cells (49Takagi Y. Hirata Y. Takata S. Yoshimi H. Fukuda Y. Fujuta T. Hidaka H. Atherosclerosis. 1988; 74: 227-230Google Scholar) also inhibited oxidized LDL or lysoPC-induced DNA synthesis. Taken together, our results link the enhanced DNA synthesis with cell cycle entry. Also consistent with our finding that oxidized LDL and lysoPC induced increases in DNA synthesis reflecting cell cycle entry is our observation that this stimulation is mediated by FGF-2. Mechanisms of release of FGF-2 are unknown. FGF-2 lacks a signal peptide required for the cellular release of other secretory proteins (50Abraham J.A. Whang J.L. Tumolo A. Mergia A. Friedman J. Gospodarowicz D. Fiddes J.C. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 2523-2528Google Scholar). Results from a number of studies have suggested that cell injury can release FGF-2 (51D'Amore P.A. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 1990; 9: 227-238Google Scholar), including a report that cell damage is required for FGF-2 secretion in cultured smooth muscle cells (45Fukuo K. Inoue T. Morimoto S. Nakahashi T. Yasuda O. Kitano S. Sasada R. Ogihara T. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 669-676Google Scholar). However, it was reported that FGF-2 can be released from SMC without discernible injury by 25-hydroxycholesterol (52Kraemer R. Pomerantz K.B. Joseph-Silverstein J. Hajjar D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8040-8045Google Scholar). Recently, another report showed that transient mechanical stimuli increased DNA synthesis in human vascular SMC, which was partially due to the release of FGF-2 in the absence of an increase in lactate dehydrogenase activity (53Cheng G.C. Libby P. Grodzinsky A.J. Lee R.T. Circulation. 1996; 93: 99-105Google Scholar). It was also shown that a monoclonal antibody to FGF-2 inhibited most of the mitogenic effect of thombin in rat vascular smooth muscle cells; cell damage was believed unlikely in this effect (54Weiss R.H. Maduri M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5724-5727Google Scholar). Injury was possible in the present context because in addition to their proliferative effects, lysoPC and oxidized LDL have been shown to injure cells at higher concentrations (7Hessler J.R. Morel D.W. Lewis L.J. Chisolm G.M. Arteriosclerosis. 1983; 3: 215-222Google Scholar, 55Weltzien H.U. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1979; 559: 259-287Google Scholar). We attempted to quantify a role for injury by assessing the release of 14C from [14C]adenine-loaded cells and measures of cell protein synthesis between 20 and 26 h after the addition of lysoPC. Our results showed clearly that both 10 and 15 µM lysoPC stimulated DNA synthesis, yet no cell injury was discernible at 10 µM lysoPC. At a concentration of 15 µM, lysoPC caused mild permeabilization by a detectable 14C release but without any decrease in cell protein synthesis. This suggested that lysoPC may transiently influence membrane permeability, an event that may be related to release of FGF-2, but that mortal cell injury is not required for the FGF-2 release and subsequent stimulation of cells into the cell cycle. A permeabilization or mild, reversible form of injury could have been related, for example, to a detergent action of lysoPC as suggested by a report showing that lysoPC and the detergent digitonin similarly increased DNA synthesis (46Chen Y. Morimoto S. Kitano S. Koh E. Fukuo K. Jiang B. Chen S. Yasuda O. Hirotani A. Ogihara T. Atherosclerosis. 1995; 112: 69-76Google Scholar). However, our results showed that vitamin E did not inhibit digitonin-mediated increases in DNA synthesis, indicating that these occur by at least partly different mechanisms. Furthermore, lysoPC effectively increased DNA synthesis at concentrations well below its reported critical micelle concentration, 50 µM (56Weltzien H.U. Arnold B. Reuther R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1977; 466: 411-421Google Scholar). Vitamin E is reported to have cellular actions other than acting as antioxidant; however, it is presumed that vitamin E was not inhibiting DNA synthesis via its putative ability to inhibit PKC activity (57Ozer N.K. Palozza P. Boscoboinik D. Azzi A. FEBS Lett. 1993; 322: 307-310Google Scholar), because FGF-2-induced proliferation, which could be blunted by PKC inhibition, was not inhibited by vitamin E. Our results support the concept that vitamin E blocks lysoPC-induced release of FGF-2 but does not block the effect of the growth factor after its release. Our results are consistent with a scenario in which sublethal levels of oxidized LDL or lysoPC can inflict an antioxidant-inhibitable oxidant stress on cells, which causes FGF-2 release by an unknown means and a FGF-2-mediated proliferative response. However, we cannot rule out certain alternative mechanisms. For example, lysoPC may be releasing FGF-2 from matrix rather than or in addition to releasing it from cells. In addition, the increased DNA synthesis we observed in response to oxidized LDL could be due to multiple mechanisms, only one of which is lysoPC- and FGF-2-mediated. Neutralizing antibody to FGF-2 and down-regulation of PKC by prior treatment of cells with phorbol myristate acetate did not totally block the effects of oxidized LDL. We are grateful to Dr. Gene Liau, American Red Cross, for the generous gift of rabbit SMC that overproduce FGF-2."

Src family catalytic function is required for RPTK mitogenic signaling as evidenced by the SH2-dependent dominant negative phenotype exhibited by kinase-inactive Src and Fyn mutants (Twamley-Stein, G. M., Pepperkok, R., Ansorge, W., and Courtneidge, S. A. (1993) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 90, 7696-7700). Here, we have generated clonal Src− murine fibroblast cell lines overexpressing various murine c-Src mutants and studied the effect of these mutant Src proteins on PDGF- and EGF-induced mitogenesis. Two c-Src SH3 domain mutants, Y133F and Y138F, each inhibited PDGF BB- and EGF-induced DNA synthesis in quiescent cells. This demonstrates an involvement of the Src SH3 domain in PDGFβ and EGF receptor mitogenic signaling. Since both Tyr-133 and Tyr-138 are located on the ligand binding surface of the SH3 domain, these results suggest that the c-Src SH3 domain is required for PDGF and EGF mitogenic signaling. The dominant negative effect of either single mutant on PDGF receptor signaling was reversed by a second SH2-inactivating mutation. We conclude that the c-Src SH3 domain function requires the SH2 domain in the case of the PDGF receptor, presumably because binding of c-Src to the receptor via its SH2 domain is a prerequisite for the SH3 domain function. In contrast, SH2 function is apparently not essential for the SH3 function in EGF receptor signaling.

https://openalex.org/W2156694889,"It has been proposed that lysine 71 of the bovine 70-kDa heat shock cognate protein might participate in catalysis of ATP hydrolysis by stabilizing an H2O molecule or an OH− ion for nucleophilic attack on the γ-phosphate of the nucleotide (Flaherty, K.

INTRODUCTIONThe bovine 70-kDa heat shock protein (Hsc70) 1The abbreviations used are: Hsc7070-kDa heat shock cognate proteinAMPPNPadenosine 5′-(β,γ-imino)triphosphate. is thought to “chaperone” protein folding by, at a minimum, binding to nascent or misfolded segments of polypeptides, thereby inhibiting their aggregation (for reviews, see 3Gething M.J. Sambrook J. Nature. 1992; 355: 33-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (3573) Google Scholar and 4McKay D.B. Adv. Protein Chem. 1993; 44: 67-98Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). ATP-induced release of peptides then allows the opportunity to fold or refold correctly. Hsc70 has an ATPase activity (5Schlossman D.M. Schmid S.L. Braell W.A. Rothman J.E. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 99: 723-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar), a somewhat diverse peptide binding activity (6Flynn G.C. Pohl J. Flocco M.T. Rothman J.E. Nature. 1991; 353: 726-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar, 7Fourie A.M. Sambrook J.F. Gething M.J. J. Biol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 19839-19844Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), and a mechanism for coupling the two. The nucleotide regulates the peptide binding activity; with ADP bound, Hsc70 binds peptides or denatured proteins tightly, but when ATP binds, peptides are released (9Lewis M.J. Pelham H.R.B. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 3137-3143Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar).Within the 650-residue sequence of Hsc70, the ATPase activity is localized in the amino-terminal 385 residues (10Chappell T.G. Konforti B.B. Schmid S.L. Rothman J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 746-751Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a peptide binding activity is spanned by residues 386–550 (11Wang T. Chang J. Wang C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26049-26051Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the function of the carboxyl-terminal 100 residues remains unclear. The ATPase domain can be isolated as an independent, fully functional entity either as a proteolytic fragment from full-length protein (10Chappell T.G. Konforti B.B. Schmid S.L. Rothman J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 746-751Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12DeLuca-Flaherty C. Flaherty K.M. McIntosh L.J. Bahrami B. McKay D.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 200: 749-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) or as a recombinant expression product (2Wilbanks S.M. DeLuca-Flaherty C. McKay D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12893-12898Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13O'Brien M.C. McKay D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24323-24329Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This allows the option of studying the ATPase mechanism on this domain alone, thereby circumventing the complexities encountered in the full-length protein where the ATPase activity is coupled to peptide binding and release.The x-ray crystallographic structure of the ATPase fragment has been reported (14Flaherty K.M. DeLuca-Flaherty C. McKay D.B. Nature. 1990; 346: 623-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar). In crystals, the wild-type ATPase fragment has ADP and Pi (the products of ATP hydrolysis) bound in a complex with a hydrated Mg2+ ion (1Flaherty K.M. Wilbanks S.M. DeLuca-Flaherty C. McKay d.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12899-12907Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Wilbanks S.M. McKay D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2251-2257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Mutagenesis has been carried out on several residues whose proximity to the Mg2+ ion and Pi suggested they might participate in catalysis, and the structural and kinetic properties of the mutant ATPase fragment proteins have been reported (1Flaherty K.M. Wilbanks S.M. DeLuca-Flaherty C. McKay d.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12899-12907Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Wilbanks S.M. DeLuca-Flaherty C. McKay D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12893-12898Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13O'Brien M.C. McKay D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24323-24329Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). None of the mutations that were introduced resulted in a complete loss of ATPase activity. The results suggested a pathway for ATP hydrolysis in which MgATP would first bind with the Mg2+ ion complexed through outer sphere coordination to the carboxyl groups of Asp-10 and Asp-199 and with a nonbonded oxygen of the β-phosphate of ATP bound directly to the ion (1Flaherty K.M. Wilbanks S.M. DeLuca-Flaherty C. McKay d.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12899-12907Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In a subsequent step, the γ-phosphate would rearrange to form a β,γ-bidentate complex with the Mg2+ ion, thereby aligning the terminal phosphorous-oxygen bond for in-line chemical attack by an H2O molecule or OH− ion. In the proposed scenario, Lys-71 could participate by stabilizing and/or accepting a proton from the hydroxide ion or H2O molecule involved in nucleophilic attack. Such a reaction scheme proposes that Lys-71 would be a catalytically essential residue.We have tested this hypothesis by mutating Lys-71 to alanine (K71A), methionine (K71M), and glutamic acid (K71E) in the Hsc70 ATPase fragment. We report the structural and kinetic properties of the three mutant proteins below.RESULTSMutagenesis of Lys-71 of the recombinant 44-kDa ATPase fragment of bovine Hsc70 to glutamic acid, alanine, and methionine was carried out, and the enzymatic properties and crystallographic structures of the mutant proteins have been determined.ATPase ActivityAll three mutants were assayed in the presence of 1 µM ATP, 0.4 µM enzyme for a total time of 320 min. Under these conditions, even a single turnover would have been detected, yet no ADP was produced by any of the three mutant proteins. In order to test for an altered Km of the mutants, ATPase assays were performed in the presence of 50 or 100 µM ATP, also for a total time of 320 min. Again, no enzyme activity was detected. These experiments establish an upper boundary for the ATPase activities of the mutant proteins of <0.003 min−1, at least 3 orders of magnitude slower than that of wild-type protein. The fact that we have observed no activity whatsoever with these proteins combined with the fact that we have previously made reliable measurements of ATPase activities with other mutant proteins whose turnover rates were 100-fold slower than wild-type protein argues strongly that all three Lys-71 mutants are devoid of ATPase activity.Crystallographic StructuresThe starting model for refinement of K71M and K71A was a high resolution structure of the wild-type ATPase fragment refined to 1.7-Å resolution with data collected from a frozen crystal (15Wilbanks S.M. McKay D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2251-2257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The active site nucleotide was truncated to AMP, and residue 71 was replaced with alanine. Inorganic phosphate, potassium and magnesium ions, and all solvent molecules within a 10-Å radius of the inorganic phosphate site were removed from the initial model. A rigid body refinement was performed, followed by three alternating rounds of positional and B-factor refinements. For K71E, since it was apparent in the initial maps that the structure was similar to the other two mutants, the K71A structure was used as the starting model for rigid body refinement. The crystallographic R-factors after the first round of refinement were 0.23 for K71E, 0.23 for K71A, and 0.27 for K71M. Free R-factor values were 0.27, 0.26, and 0.31, respectively, at this point. Electron density corresponding to the mutated side chains was clearly visible at residue 71 in the Fo− Fc and 2Fo− Fc maps for K71E and K71M; the respective residues were therefore built into the models. In all three mutants, electron density corresponding to an ATP molecule, a magnesium ion, and several H2O molecules was observed and modeled. Anomalous difference Fourier maps revealed three strong peaks that were interpreted as K+ ions in each structure (Fig. 1); two of the three K+ ions superimpose on the two K+ ions found earlier in the wild-type structure. Refinement of the structures continued with further cycles of model building and positional refinement until the R-factors showed no further improvement and the models had no significant deviations from acceptable structural parameters. Refinement statistics are summarized in Table I.The overall tertiary structure of the mutant proteins shows little difference from that of the wild-type ATPase fragment; root mean square differences of backbone atomic positions from those of the wild-type protein after superposition were 0.15, 0.16, and 0.32 Å for K71E, K71A, and K71M, respectively. Compared with the wild-type structure with ADP and Pi (15Wilbanks S.M. McKay D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2251-2257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), additional H2O molecules are present in the nucleotide binding cleft, including one near the position of the ε-amino group of the lysine side chain of the wild-type protein. We presume the H2O molecules compensate to fill the void left by the smaller size of the side chains introduced at residue 71 by the mutagenesis.All three mutant proteins have an ATP molecule in the nucleotide binding site. This contrasts with the wild-type ATPase fragment that has ADP and Pi, the products of hydrolysis, bound to it (1Flaherty K.M. Wilbanks S.M. DeLuca-Flaherty C. McKay d.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12899-12907Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Wilbanks S.M. McKay D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2251-2257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). In K71E and K71M, ATP forms a β,γ-bidentate complex with the Mg2+ ion. The axial ligand distances (the distances from the Mg2+ ion to the β-phosphate oxygen and antipodal H2O oxygen) are approximately 2.0 Å, essentially equal to the Mg2+-oxygen ligand distances observed in the wild-type structure (15Wilbanks S.M. McKay D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2251-2257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). However, the distances from the Mg2+ ion to the γ-phosphate oxygen and to the oxygen of its antipodal H2O molecule range from 2.2 to 2.4 Å in the two structures, significantly larger than the range of 1.9 to 2.1 Å typically observed for Mg2+-ligand distances in both proteins and small molecule complexes (21Glusker J.P. Anfinsen C.B. Edsall J.T. Richards F.M. Eisenberg D.S. Advances in Protein Chemistry. Academic Press, Orlando, FL1991: 1Google Scholar). The β,γ-bidentate Mg2+-ATP complex appears somewhat “loose” in these structures.In K71A, there is an interstitial H2O molecule bridging the Mg2+ ion and the γ-phosphate oxygens. In this case, the conformation of the triphosphate is similar to that of AMPPNP bound to the wild-type ATPase fragment and to that of ATP seen in particular mutant proteins (D10N, D10S, D199N, D199S) in the presence of 1 M NaCl (1Flaherty K.M. Wilbanks S.M. DeLuca-Flaherty C. McKay d.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12899-12907Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In some of the structures reported previously, an H2O molecule is also apparent in an interstitial position between the Mg2+ and the ATP γ-phosphate. In others, the electron density in that area was too noisy to unambiguously resolve the Mg2+-ligand details.Three K+ ions are also seen in the nucleotide binding cleft of each of the mutant structures. Two of these (labeled #1 and #2 in Fig. 2) correspond to the two K+ ions found in the wild-type structure with ADP and Pi (15Wilbanks S.M. McKay D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2251-2257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The third K+ ion is at a distance ranging from 4.0 to 4.2 Å from K+#2 in the three mutant structures. It is coordinated by the carboxyl of Asp-206, the hydroxyl of Thr-204, the phenolic hydroxyl of Tyr-149, and at least one H2O molecule in all three mutants. In the wild-type protein, this position is occupied by an H2O molecule.Fig. 2Structures of wild-type and mutant proteins in the triphosphate binding region of the ATPase fragment. Phosphorus atoms are black, carbon atoms are white, and others are gray. Metal ions are labeled. Subsets of the interactions with Mg2+ and K+ are shown by dotted lines. A, K71E; B, K71M; C, K71A; D, active site region in the wild-type protein with ADP and Pi bound.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)There are a few additional, subtle differences between the structures of the mutants. In K71M, the methionine side chain packs against the polypeptide backbone of the β strand that includes residues 10–13, and the side chain of T13 is rotated relative to its orientation in wild-type and other mutant proteins. These minor differences between K71M and the other two mutants do not give rise to any major differences in the interactions of the protein with the nucleotide or metal ions.DISCUSSIONAll three of the proteins in which the lysine at position 71 has been mutated to a different residue are devoid of measurable ATPase activity. This contrasts with the results of earlier work where mutagenesis of any of the four acidic residues in the active site region (Asp-10, Glu-175, Asp-199, and Asp-206) resulted in a 10–100-fold lower ATPase turnover rate, but in all cases, measurable activity was still observed (2Wilbanks S.M. DeLuca-Flaherty C. McKay D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12893-12898Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, ATP is bound in crystals of all three mutant proteins at neutral pH in the presence of 1 M KCl. Although we previously observed ATP bound on other mutants (specifically D10N, D10S, D199N, and D199S) at pH 9 in the presence of 1 M NaCl (1Flaherty K.M. Wilbanks S.M. DeLuca-Flaherty C. McKay d.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12899-12907Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), adapting crystals of at least one of these mutants (D199N) to 1 M KCl at neutral pH (prompted by the observation that the ATPase activity depends on the type of monovalent ion present (22Palleros D.R. Reid K.L. Shi L. Welch W.J. Fink A.L. Nature. 1993; 365: 664-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar, 23O'Brien M.C. McKay D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2247-2250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar)) results in hydrolysis to ADP + Pi. 2S. M. Wilbanks and D. B. McKay, unpublished data. Taken together, the results reported here demonstrate that Lys-71 is essential for ATP hydrolysis. It is notable that all 70-kDa heat shock proteins for which the sequences are known (GenBank™, release 92.0) have a lysine at this position. We presume that the essential function of this lysine is conserved throughout the heat shock protein family.The two conformations of ATP observed in structures of the mutant proteins are consistent with and may represent two steps along the pathway previously proposed for nucleotide hydrolysis (1Flaherty K.M. Wilbanks S.M. DeLuca-Flaherty C. McKay d.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12899-12907Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The manner in which ATP binds in K71A, with an interstitial H2O molecule between the γ-phosphate and the Mg2+ ion, is similar to that observed with AMPPNP bound to wild-type protein and with ATP bound in several mutant proteins. The manner in which ATP binds in K71M and K71E, forming a β,γ-bidentate complex with the Mg2+ ion, was proposed as an intermediate step required to position the γ-phosphate for hydrolysis. Formation of a stable bidentate Mg2+-ATP complex in the crystals, without hydrolysis, is consistent with the suggestion that the ε-amino group of the side chain of Lys-71 participates in the chemical step of the ATPase cycle. Removal of the lysine ε-amino group by mutagenesis allows ATP to bind and the γ-phosphate to rearrange and form the bidentate complex but does not allow hydrolysis.A third K+ ion is found in the mutant structures at a site where an H2O molecule is found in the wild-type protein with ADP and Pi (15Wilbanks S.M. McKay D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2251-2257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) bound. It is conceivable that K+#3 might participate in the hydrolytic reaction and be displaced by an H2O molecule after hydrolysis but before ADP or Pi release. We do not yet have information on whether a third K+ binds at this site in wild-type protein in the presence of nonhydrolyzable ATP analogs, so we cannot rule out this possibility. However, an alternative explanation for its presence is that it may provide electrostatic compensation for the removal of the buried positive charge of the lysine side chain. We have observed a precedent that can be rationalized as electrostatic compensation for removal of a buried charge by mutagenesis of the ATPase fragment. In the D199N mutant protein, which eliminates a carboxyl group (which would presumably be ionized at neutral pH), K+#2 is absent.2It has been demonstrated that binding of ATP induces a conformational change in Hsc70 that switches the protein from a high peptide affinity state to a low peptide affinity state (5Schlossman D.M. Schmid S.L. Braell W.A. Rothman J.E. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 99: 723-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar, 22Palleros D.R. Reid K.L. Shi L. Welch W.J. Fink A.L. Nature. 1993; 365: 664-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). It remains to be seen whether full-length Hsc70 protein with mutations at position 71 can still undergo the ATP-induced conformational change. If so, one would expect that ATP would permanently “lock” such an Hsc70 mutant protein into its peptide release state in the presence of excess ATP, both in vitro and in vivo. If not, one would expect Hsc70 with mutations at position 71 to be in its peptide binding state regardless of the ATP/ADP ratio. In either case, such mutants could prove valuable in characterizing the in vivo activities of representative 70-kDa heat shock proteins. Experiments are currently under way to determine how the ATP hydrolysis and/or knockout mutations at position 71 affect the conformational change that couples the ATPase cycle to peptide binding and release in Hsc70. INTRODUCTIONThe bovine 70-kDa heat shock protein (Hsc70) 1The abbreviations used are: Hsc7070-kDa heat shock cognate proteinAMPPNPadenosine 5′-(β,γ-imino)triphosphate. is thought to “chaperone” protein folding by, at a minimum, binding to nascent or misfolded segments of polypeptides, thereby inhibiting their aggregation (for reviews, see 3Gething M.J. Sambrook J. Nature. 1992; 355: 33-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (3573) Google Scholar and 4McKay D.B. Adv. Protein Chem. 1993; 44: 67-98Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). ATP-induced release of peptides then allows the opportunity to fold or refold correctly. Hsc70 has an ATPase activity (5Schlossman D.M. Schmid S.L. Braell W.A. Rothman J.E. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 99: 723-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar), a somewhat diverse peptide binding activity (6Flynn G.C. Pohl J. Flocco M.T. Rothman J.E. Nature. 1991; 353: 726-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar, 7Fourie A.M. Sambrook J.F. Gething M.J. J. Biol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 19839-19844Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), and a mechanism for coupling the two. The nucleotide regulates the peptide binding activity; with ADP bound, Hsc70 binds peptides or denatured proteins tightly, but when ATP binds, peptides are released (9Lewis M.J. Pelham H.R.B. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 3137-3143Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar).Within the 650-residue sequence of Hsc70, the ATPase activity is localized in the amino-terminal 385 residues (10Chappell T.G. Konforti B.B. Schmid S.L. Rothman J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 746-751Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a peptide binding activity is spanned by residues 386–550 (11Wang T. Chang J. Wang C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26049-26051Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the function of the carboxyl-terminal 100 residues remains unclear. The ATPase domain can be isolated as an independent, fully functional entity either as a proteolytic fragment from full-length protein (10Chappell T.G. Konforti B.B. Schmid S.L. Rothman J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 746-751Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12DeLuca-Flaherty C. Flaherty K.M. McIntosh L.J. Bahrami B. McKay D.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 200: 749-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) or as a recombinant expression product (2Wilbanks S.M. DeLuca-Flaherty C. McKay D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12893-12898Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13O'Brien M.C. McKay D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24323-24329Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This allows the option of studying the ATPase mechanism on this domain alone, thereby circumventing the complexities encountered in the full-length protein where the ATPase activity is coupled to peptide binding and release.The x-ray crystallographic structure of the ATPase fragment has been reported (14Flaherty K.M. DeLuca-Flaherty C. McKay D.B. Nature. 1990; 346: 623-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar). In crystals, the wild-type ATPase fragment has ADP and Pi (the products of ATP hydrolysis) bound in a complex with a hydrated Mg2+ ion (1Flaherty K.M. Wilbanks S.M. DeLuca-Flaherty C. McKay d.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12899-12907Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Wilbanks S.M. McKay D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2251-2257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Mutagenesis has been carried out on several residues whose proximity to the Mg2+ ion and Pi suggested they might participate in catalysis, and the structural and kinetic properties of the mutant ATPase fragment proteins have been reported (1Flaherty K.M. Wilbanks S.M. DeLuca-Flaherty C. McKay d.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12899-12907Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Wilbanks S.M. DeLuca-Flaherty C. McKay D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12893-12898Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13O'Brien M.C. McKay D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24323-24329Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). None of the mutations that were introduced resulted in a complete loss of ATPase activity. The results suggested a pathway for ATP hydrolysis in which MgATP would first bind with the Mg2+ ion complexed through outer sphere coordination to the carboxyl groups of Asp-10 and Asp-199 and with a nonbonded oxygen of the β-phosphate of ATP bound directly to the ion (1Flaherty K.M. Wilbanks S.M. DeLuca-Flaherty C. McKay d.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12899-12907Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In a subsequent step, the γ-phosphate would rearrange to form a β,γ-bidentate complex with the Mg2+ ion, thereby aligning the terminal phosphorous-oxygen bond for in-line chemical attack by an H2O molecule or OH− ion. In the proposed scenario, Lys-71 could participate by stabilizing and/or accepting a proton from the hydroxide ion or H2O molecule involved in nucleophilic attack. Such a reaction scheme proposes that Lys-71 would be a catalytically essential residue.We have tested this hypothesis by mutating Lys-71 to alanine (K71A), methionine (K71M), and glutamic acid (K71E) in the Hsc70 ATPase fragment. We report the structural and kinetic properties of the three mutant proteins below."

The L. donovani A2 genes have been described previously as developmentally expressed in amastigotes but can be induced experimentally in promastigotes by a combination of pH and temperature shifts, conditions that mimic the phagolysosomal compartment of the macrophage cell. Considering the importance of the amastigote stage in human infections, we have examined the molecular basis for amastigote stage-specific gene expression. Our results provide evidence that A2 developmental expression during the promastigote-to-amastigote cytodifferentiation is mediated through differential RNA stability and involves the A2 mRNA 3′-untranslated region. The site of processing in the 3′-untranslated region was a major factor for the accumulation of A2 mRNAs in cells incubated under phagolysosomal conditions. The stability of reporter gene transcripts bearing the A2 3′-untranslated region was increased in cells incubated at low pH, further confirming the importance of pH shift as an inducer for A2 expression. These observations contribute to defining the mechanism of amastigote-specific gene regulation in L. donovani.

Leishmania is a dimorphic protozoan that is responsible for a large spectrum of diseases in humans, ranging from self-curing skin ulcers to the severe pathologies associated with visceral leishmaniasis. This protozoan parasite exists as a flagellated promastigote in the sandfly vector, then as an intracellular amastigote in the mammalian host. The cytodifferentiation from the promastigote to the amastigote form occurs in the phagolysosomal compartment of the macrophage cell, and this transformation is a prerequisite for parasite survival. Amastigotes multiply within the mammalian host macrophages, and this stage of the life cycle is therefore responsible for the pathologies associated with leishmaniasis (for review, see Molyneux and Killick-Kendrick (20Molyneux, D. H., Killick-Kendrick, R., (1987) in Leishmaniasis in Biology and Medicine., Vol. 1, Biology and Epidemiology, (Peters, W., Killick-Kendrick, R., eds) pp. 121–176, Academic Press, New York.Google Scholar)). Leishmaniasis is considered by the World Health Organization to be one of the six major tropical diseases of developing countries (World Health Organization, 30World Health Organization Tropical Disease Research Progress, 1991-1992. Eleventh Program Report of the World Bank/WHO Special Program for Research and Training in Tropical Disease, Geneva1993Google Scholar). The Leishmania donovani A2 genes have been characterized previously as amastigote-specific (Charest and Matlashewski, 6Charest H. Matlashewski G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2975-2984Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The corresponding A2 protein is comprised predominantly of a highly conserved repetitive element and shares some characteristics with major antigens expressed developmentally by pathological forms of several other unrelated human parasites. Of particular relevance for this study, we have shown that the expression of the A2 transcripts could be induced experimentally in cultured promastigotes by a combination of temperature and pH shifts, conditions that mimic the passage from the insect vector to the phagolysosomal compartment of the macrophage cell (Charest and Matlashewski, 6Charest H. Matlashewski G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2975-2984Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The ability to induce A2 expression in vitro, together with the ability to transform and express exogenous DNA in Leishmania cells (Cruz and Beverley, 9Cruz A. Beverley S.M.

To define the molecular mechanisms involved in the developmental expression of A2 transcripts in Leishmania during the promastigote-to-amastigote cytodifferentiation, the arrangement of the A2 genes within the L. donovani genome was determined. DNA sequences flanking the A2 protein coding region were then tested for their ability to modulate a developmental expression of reporter genes in transfected L. donovani cells. Transfection assays demonstrated that the 3′-untranslated region (3′-UTR 1The abbreviations used are: UTRuntranslated regionRTreverse transcriptionPCRpolymerase chain reactionkbkilobase(s)bpbase pair(s)ORFopen reading frame. ) of the A2 mRNA could mediate a differential accumulation of reporter gene transcripts in L. donovani following induction of A2 expression by a combination of temperature and pH shifts. Moreover, reporter genes integrated into the A2 chromosomal locus by homologous recombinations showed the same pattern of developmental expression as the A2 gene. Since stable DNA transfection has only been reported thus far with the promastigote stage in Leishmania, controlling gene expression using A2 untranslated sequences provides a unique system to allow amastigote stage-specific expression of transfected heterologous genes. untranslated region reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction kilobase(s) base pair(s) open reading frame. L. donovani donovani Sudanese 1S2D and L. donovani infantum Ethiopian LV9 promastigotes were cultured at 26°C in RPMI 1640 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% defined heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (HyClone Laboratories Inc., Logan, UT) and 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.3. LV9 amastigotes were purified from infected Gold Syrian hamsters and passaged as described previously (Charest and Matlashewski, 6Charest H. Matlashewski G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2975-2984Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Total RNA was extracted from promastigotes by the phenol-chloroform-guanidinium isothiocyanate method using RNAzol (Cinna/Biotecx Laboratories International, Inc., Friendswood, TX) or TRIzol (Life Technologies, Inc.) reagents. Total DNA and chromosomal DNA samples were prepared from promastigotes according to standard protocols (Sambrook et al., 25Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Leishmania chromosomes were separated at 200 volts on a 1% agarose gel in 0.5 × TBE (1 × TBE is 45 mM Tris, 45 mM boric acid, 2 mM EDTA) using a contour-clamped homogeneous electric field (CHEF) apparatus (Bio-Rad); running conditions were an initial pulsed time of 40 s ramping to 120 s over a period of 35 h at 8°C. Southern and Northern blot analyses were carried out as described previously (Charest and Matlashewski, 6Charest H. Matlashewski G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2975-2984Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar; Descoteaux and Matlashewski, 11Descoteaux A. Matlashewski G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 5223-5227Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Hybridizations were performed in 50% formamide, 6 × SSC (1 × SSC consists in 0.15 M NaCl, 0.015 M sodium citrate), 5 × Denhardt's solution (1 × Denhardt's is 0.02% polyvinylpyrrolidone, 0.02% Ficoll, 0.02% bovine serum albumin), 0.1% SDS, 200 µg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA for 18 h at 42°C; or in 1 M NaCl, 1% SDS, 10% dextran sulfate for 18 h at 65°C. The cDNA library screening and in vivo excision of pBluescript plasmid derivatives from recombinant λZAP II phages were performed as described previously (Charest and Matlashewski, 6Charest H. Matlashewski G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2975-2984Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). DNA probes were prepared from agarose gel-purified fragments labeled with [α-32P]dCTP (ICN; 3,000 Ci/mmol) by nick translation. To amplify 5′ ends of both A2 and A2rel transcripts, LV9 amastigote RNA was used as a template for RT-PCR. Reverse transcription steps were performed with SuperScript RNase H− reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.) following the manufacturer's protocol (10 µg of total RNA/reaction). The PCRs were carried out using Tth polymerase (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) and a GeneAmp 9600 Thermocycler apparatus (Perkin-Elmer Corp.); a quarter of the RT reaction was used as a template in PCRs. Annealing steps were carried out at 40°C (2 min) for the first 20 cycles, and then the temperature was raised to 50°C for 20 subsequent cycles. Elongation and denaturation steps were carried out at 70°C for 3 min and at 95°C for 30 s, respectively. Primers used for the RT and PCR were: SPR, gacgcacaccagcaacaccac (antisense, for the A2 gene); 28 MFX, ccgtgtaaggcagagac (antisense, for the A2rel gene); SL, caacgctatataagtatcagtttctgtactttattg (sense, splice leader sequence). To amplify the 5′ ends of the plasmid-derived transcripts, the following primers were used: SL, the splice leader sequence shown above; atagccgaatagcctctcca (antisense, neo-specific primer); cgaggcttcgtagcggtg (antisense, 3′ end of the Pro sequence). To amplify the 3′ end of the plasmid-derived transcripts, the following primers were used: ggggatccttttttttttttttttttt (antisense, poly(A) site); tgctttggcttcctgac (sense, A2 3′-UTR). Agarose gel-purified PCR products were inserted into the pCR-script SK(+) cloning vector (Stratagene) using the manufacturer's protocol and reagents; recombinant plasmids were identified by colony hybridization analyses (Sambrook et al., 25Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). DNA sequencing of recombinant plasmid inserts and corresponding genomic regions on Geco 90 was performed as described previously (Charest and Matlashewski, 6Charest H. Matlashewski G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2975-2984Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). A plasmid containing the 3′-UTR of the A2 transcript (SKTail) was constructed by combining XbaI/EcoRI (0.7 kb) and EcoRI/PstI (0.45 kb) fragments from the genomic clone Geco 90 into the SK− A9 cDNA recombinant plasmid (XbaI/PstI; refer to Figs. 1A and 2A). The A9 cDNA contains extra bases at the 3′ end compared with other cDNAs of the A2 series and was thought to carry a polyadenylation acceptor site (Charest and Matlashewski, 6Charest H. Matlashewski G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2975-2984Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The SKTail plasmid was then used to purify a XbaI/XhoI 1.7-kb A2 Tail element representing the 3′-UTR (refer to Figs. 1A and 2). The Pro element consisted of a 1.6-kb XhoI fragment from the Geco 90 plasmid. On the pSPYneo plasmid, used as backbone for our constructs, the neo gene was preceded by a 92-bp synthetic element (pyt), which consists of a polypyrimidine tract and an AG trans-splicing acceptor site (Papadopoulou et al., 22Papadopoulou B. Roy G. Ouellette M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1994; 65: 39-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). To construct NEO P(−), NEO T′, and NEO PT′, this synthetic element circumscribed by SstI restriction sites was removed from pSPYneo to create NEO(−). A plasmid construct carrying only the artificial trans-splicing acceptor element (pSPY21) was used to construct NEO T′ and NEO PT′. Plasmids pSPY21 and pSPYneo are gifts from Dr. Papadopoulou and Dr. Ouellette (Laval University, Québec). Plasmid insert maps are depicted in Fig. 2B. In NEO T, NEO P, NEO P(−) and NEO PT(-), the Tail element eluted from an agarose gel was blunt-ended with Klenow fragment of E. coli polymerase I and inserted into the unique EcoRV site of the pSPYneo or NEO (-) vectors; the Pro element was inserted into unique SalI restriction sites. To construct NEO T′ and NEO PT′, inserts from NEO T and NEO PT(-) were excised with XhoI and BglII, and agarose gel purified restriction fragments were inserted into pSPY21 (XhoI/BamHI), upstream of the pyt element. Methods for stable transfections and selection of clones were derived from established protocols 2M. Ouellette, personal communication. (Beverley and Clayton, 2Beverley S.M. Clayton C. Methods Mol. Biol. 1993; 21: 333-348PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, late log phase promastigotes of the L. donovani 1S2D strain were harvested by centrifugation (1,500 × g, 10 min) and resuspended at a concentration of 108/ml in ice-cold transfection buffer (21 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 137 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 0.7 mM Na2HPO4, and 6 mM glucose). Cells (0.4 ml) were mixed with 10-20 µg of CsCl-purified plasmid DNA or agarose gel-purified DNA fragments and were electroporated with a single pulse of 250 microfarads and 0.45 KV. When the concentration of drug-resistant cells reached about 105 cells/ml (2-4 weeks), the concentration of G418 in the culture medium was increased gradually from 10 to 50 µg/ml. Polyclonal populations of recombinant promastigotes were used for experiments with stably transfected cells carrying episomal copies of neo. Recombinant promastigotes carrying neo targeted into the chromosomal A2 gene cluster were cloned by multiple dilutions. Assays were performed as described previously for Leishmania cells (Brandau et al., 5Brandau S. Dresel A. Clos J. Biochem. J. 1995; 310: 225-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Cells were washed once in cold phosphate-buffered saline and suspended at 4°C in lysis buffer (10 mM Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mM NaCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM spermidine, 0.1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, 5 mM dithiothreitol, 0.1 mM phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, and 0.5% Triton X-100) and kept on ice for 10 min. The crude nuclei were then pelleted at 6,000 rpm for 10 min in a Beckman J2-MC centrifuge (JA 17 rotor) at 4°C. The nuclei were washed once in lysis buffer without detergent and resuspended in an equal volume of 2 × nuclei storage buffer (100 mM Tris/HCl, pH 8.3, 80% glycerol, 10 mM MgCl2, and 0.2 mM EDTA). A 100-µl sample of nuclei (109) containing buffer was mixed with an equal volume of nuclear run-on buffer (8 mM MgCl2, 80 mM Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mM NaCl, 50 mM KCl, 0.15 mM spermine, 0.5 mM spermidine, 4 mM ATP, 2 mM CTP, 2 mM GTP, 10 µM UTP, 10 mM phosphocreatine, 20 units/ml creatine kinase, 40 units of RNasin (Promega), 2 mM dithiothreitol) and 0.1 mCi of [α-32P]UTP (400 Ci/mmol; ICN, Canada) and incubated for 10 min at 37°C. The radiolabeled nascent RNA was isolated using RNAzol as described previously (Charest and Matlashewski, 6Charest H. Matlashewski G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2975-2984Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). A 5-µg sample of each DNA probe to be tested was denatured in 0.4 M NaOH and applied onto a nylon membrane using a vacuum slot-blot apparatus. Membrane strips were then subjected to hybridization with the radiolabeled RNA in a solution consisting of 5 × SSC, 5 × Denhardt's solution, 0.05% SDS, 0.5 mM EDTA, and 100 µg of denatured fish sperm DNA for 48 h at 65°C. Subsequently, filters were washed at room temperature for 10 min in 6 × SSC, 1% SDS and a final wash at 65 C in 1 × SSC. A2 gene expression was induced in wild type and transfected promastigotes in the following manner. Promastigotes maintained in RPMI 1640, 10% fetal bovine serum, pH 7.3 and 26°C, were grown to late log phase (107/ml), harvested by centrifugation (1,500 × g, 10 min), and resuspended in the above medium at 37°C containing 20 mM succinate (final pH at 4.5), conditions that mimic the phagolysosomal compartment of the macrophage cell. As a control for conditions that do not induce A2 expression, harvested promastigotes were also transferred into fresh culture medium at pH 7.3 and at 26°C. For the mRNA stability assays, promastigotes maintained at pH 7.3, 26°C, were transferred to medium at 37°C and pH 4.5 or pH 7.3 and allowed to adapt for 30 min before the addition of 10 µg/ml actinomycin D (Sigma). Under these conditions, A2 gene expression is induced in promastigotes at pH 4.5, but not in promastigotes at pH 7.3 (Charest and Matlashewski, 6Charest H. Matlashewski G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2975-2984Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Cells were harvested at 1, 3, and 5 h after the addition of actinomycin D and subjected to Northern blot analysis to detect neo/A2 chimeric transcripts. Preliminary characterization of the A2 multigene family organization in L. donovani infantum LV9 suggested an arrangement in tandem arrays and polymorphism among gene copies (Charest and Matlashewski, 6Charest H. Matlashewski G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2975-2984Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The EcoRI genomic clone Geco 90 (Fig. 1A), previously identified with the A2 cDNA as a probe, was shown to carry parts of two A2 gene copies: the 3′ end of one copy, where the A2 cDNA mapped, followed by the 5′ end of a second copy, in which the A2 protein coding region (A2/ORF II) was identified. To characterize the expression of the A2 gene, it was necessary to define further the genomic organization of the A2 genes by Southern and Northern blot analyses using fragments of the Geco 90 clone as probes (Fig. 1). Southern blot analyses with a XbaI/XhoI double digest (X/O, Fig. 1B; refer to Fig. 1A for probes) clearly showed that the repeated region within the A2 gene was responsible for most of the restriction fragment length polymorphism observed with other restriction digests. Analysis of the XbaI/XhoI double digest with probe E, which delineated the A2 coding regions, revealed a ladder of hybridization bands ranging from 1.6 to 3.0 kb. Similarly, other restriction fragments that contained this portion also produced a ladder of several hybridization bands. However, hybridization with fragment A as a probe revealed only a doublet band at around 3.4 kb, suggesting that A2 copies were indeed arranged similarly within the genome. Thus, the polymorphism was confined to the A2 coding regions. Restriction patterns and karyotypes were compared for two L. donovani strains used in this study: the infective L. donovani infantum Ethiopian LV9 strain, from which the A2 cDNAs and genomic clones were derived, and L. donovani donovani Sudanese 1S2D, the noninfective strain used for subsequent transfection assays. The A2 gene loci showed a high degree of conservation between L. donovani LV9 and 1S2D strains. All of the A2 copies in both strains were contained on a 850-kb chromosome (Fig. 1C). Northern blot analyses using the fragment B as a probe revealed another RNA encoding region (termed A2rel, 2.3 kb) lying between A2 sequences on genomic clone Geco 90. We compared the expression pattern of A2 and A2rel transcripts in promastigotes induced for an A2 developmental expression. We showed previously that a combination of temperature and pH shifts (26°C, pH 7.3, to 37°C, pH 4.5), conditions mimicking the transfer from the insect vector to the phagolysosomal compartment of the mammalian host macrophage cell, induces in cultured promastigotes full expression of A2 mRNAs within 10 h (Charest and Matlashewski, 6Charest H. Matlashewski G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2975-2984Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1D, A2-specific mRNAs accumulated slowly in cells following transfer to the phagolysosomal conditions of 37°C and pH 4.5. In contrast, expression of the A2rel transcripts remained constant throughout the 10-h period. The two higher molecular weight transcripts recognized by the A2rel probe could represent mRNAs derived from copies bordering A2/A2rel clusters or from alternate trans-splicing and polyadenylation. Results of Southern blot analyses with XhoI fragments (Fig. 1B), which contained sequences of both A2 and A2rel, strongly suggest that copies of the two genes are always associated together on the genome, copies of A2 alternating head to tail with copies of A2rel. For the purpose of this study, the A2rel mRNA (2.3 kb) represented an excellent control for constitutive gene expression in L. donovani. To define the sequences involved in A2 developmental expression, it was first necessary to map precisely the 5′ and 3′ ends of the A2 transcripts on the genomic sequences. The mapping of the 5′ end was achieved using RT-PCR and DNA sequencing, and the results are included in Figs. 1A and 2A. The A2-specific antisense oligonucleotide (termed SPR) was used for cDNA synthesis and was subsequently combined for PCR with an oligonucleotide representing the spliced-leader sequence of L. donovani (SL), designed according to Wilson et al. (29Wilson K. Hanson S. Landfear S.M. Ullman B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 5787-5792Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The spliced-leader sequence is added by trans-splicing at the 5′ end of all protein-encoding mRNAs in trypanosomatid cells (for review, see Clayton, 7Clayton C.E. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1992; 43: 37-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar; Pays, 23Pays E. Broda P.M. Oliver S.G. Sims P. The Eukaryotic Microbial Genome. Cambridge University Press, London1993: 99Google Scholar). Southern blot analyses of the PCR samples with an internal probe (probe D, Fig. 1A) revealed a single PCR product that was cloned and characterized. Eight clones containing the PCR product were isolated, and all displayed identical restriction enzyme patterns. The spliced-leader acceptor site was then located precisely by DNA sequencing of the cloned PCR product and the corresponding sequences on the genomic clone Geco 90. In this manner, the A2 trans-splicing acceptor site was located 214 nucleotides upstream from the beginning of the A2 open reading frame as shown in Fig. 2A. The 3′ end of the A2 transcript has been described previously (Charest and Matlashewski, 6Charest H. Matlashewski G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2975-2984Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) and is also represented in Fig. 2A. The 5′ and 3′ ends of the A2rel transcripts were also mapped by RT-PCR, cDNA cloning, restriction endonuclease, and partial sequencing. 3H. Charest, W.-W. Zhang, and G. Matlashewski, manuscript in preparation. The locations of these ends on Geco 90 are also shown in Figs. 1A and 2A. The genomic organization of A2 genes in L. donovani is outlined in Fig. 2A. As demonstrated in previous sections, the polymorphism observed among A2 gene copies is restricted to the A2 protein coding regions, whereas untranslated regions were well conserved among gene copies. Based on RNA mapping results, the A2 open reading frame (ORF II) on the A2 mRNA is preceded by a 214-bp 5′-UTR and is followed by a 2.0-kb 3′-UTR. With this information, it was possible to examine the involvement of the 5′ and the 3′ regions flanking the A2 coding region (A2/ORF II) for their individual roles in controlling A2 gene expression in cells incubated under phagolysosomal conditions (37°C, pH 4.5). A series of plasmids in which the neo gene was combined with 5′- and/or 3′-flanking regions of the A2/ORF II were constructed; maps of plasmid inserts are schematized in Fig. 2B. The A2rel-A2 intergenic region (and the A2rel 3′ region) were included as the A2 5′-flanking element (Pro element; 1.6 kb). Only 70 bp separated the XhoI restriction site from the translational initiating codon of the Geco 90/A2/ORF II. The 1.7-kb Tail element was constructed with sequences from the genomic clone Geco 90 and from the A9 cDNA. About 300 bp separated the translational termination codon of the A2/ORF II downstream from the XbaI restriction site. In these assays, neo was used as both the selectable marker and as a reporter gene. It has been demonstrated recently that the pSPneo plasmid that was used as the backbone for our constructs forms large oligomers that replicate autonomously in transfected Leishmania cells (Papadopoulou et al., 22Papadopoulou B. Roy G. Ouellette M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1994; 65: 39-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). For each plasmid construct, polyclonal populations of stably transfected cells were established and analyzed for the differential expression of neo/A2 chimeric transcripts by Northern blot analyses. Polyclonal populations were used, rather than cloned cell lines, to average out variations that may have been displayed by selected clones. The relative abundance of neo mRNAs was compared in recombinant promastigotes cultured at 26°C, pH 7.4, or transferred into phagolysosomal conditions at 37°C and pH 4.5 for 10 h to induce full expression of A2 in cells. Results from the Northern blot analysis with the neo gene as a probe are presented in Fig. 3A. Duplicate membranes hybridized with A2 gene-specific probes confirmed that the reporter neo transcripts carried relevant sequences from the A2 5′ end and/or the 3′-UTR, when these were included in the plasmid constructs (Fig. 3B). Initially, these experiments were carried out with the plasmid constructs that lacked the pyt element at the end of the 3′-UTR (Fig. 2B, plasmids NEO T, NEO P, NEO P(−), NEO PT(-)). As shown in Fig. 3A, none of these plasmids could mediate a developmental expression of chimeric neo/A2 transcripts in the transfected cells. The sizes of these transcripts were consistent with polyadenylation occurring within the plasmid backbone sequence approximately 400 bp upstream from the pyt element (in the case of plasmid NEO T) or the Pro sequence (in the case of plasmids NEO P, NEO P(−), NEO PT(−)). Because of these initial negative results, the pyt element was added onto the 3′-UTR of plasmids NEO T and NEO PT(−), resulting in plasmids NEO T′ and NEO PT′. The rationale was based on the previous observation (Lebowitz et al., 18Lebowitz J.H. Smith H.Q. Rusche L. Beverley S. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 996-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar) that trans-splicing was linked to polyadenylation, and therefore the pyt element was included to allow trans-splicing to take place within the A2 3′-UTR of transcripts derived from plasmids NEO T′ and NEO PT′. As shown in Fig. 3A, plasmids NEO T′ and NEO PT′ did mediate developmental expression of chimeric neo/A2 transcripts under phagolysosomal conditions, and the sizes of these transcripts (around 2.3 kb) were consistent with 3′ RNA processing involving the artificial trans-splicing acceptor site (pyt), which was added to the Tail element in these plasmid constructs. Densitometric analyses using the A2rel hybridization for normalization estimated the differential expression, for both NEO T′ and NEO PT′, to be about five times (NIH Image, version 1.57). Results with other plasmid constructs varied between 0.75 and 1.3. These results demonstrate that the 3′-UTR together with the pyt element present in plasmids NEO T′ and NEO PT′ is required for differential gene expression induced under phagolysosomal conditions. The expression patterns of the A2 genes arising from chromosomal copies in transfected cells were masked by the high abundance of episome-derived neo/A2 chimeric transcripts (Fig. 3B). This clearly demonstrated that plasmid-derived A2 chimeric transcripts were much more abundant than were chromosome-derived A2 transcripts. To determine whether the high levels of plasmid-derived transcripts carrying A2 sequences could influence the developmental expression of A2 chromosomal genes, a Northern blot analysis was performed with an A2/ORF II probe to reveal only chromosome-derived A2 transcripts. As shown in Fig. 3C, A2 gene developmental expression was still observed in induced NEO T′- and NEO PT′-transfected promastigotes, suggesting that cellular factors involved in the developmental expression were relatively abundant in Leishmania cells and were not titrated out by chimeric neo/A2 reporter gene transcripts. The size of the neo transcripts derived from plasmids NEO T′ and NEO PT′ was consistent with RNA processing taking place at the artificial trans-splicing acceptor si"
https://openalex.org/W2060772749,"Transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) type I (RI) and type II (RII) receptors are essential for TGFβ signal transduction. A human colon carcinoma cell line, designated GEO, is marginally responsive to TGFβ and expresses a low level of RI mRNA relative to colon carcinoma cells, which are highly responsive to TGFβ. Hence, the role of RI as a limiting factor for TGFβ sensitivity and the contribution of low RI levels to the malignant phenotype of GEO cells were examined. Stable transfection of a tetracycline-regulatable rat RI cDNA increased TGFβ1 binding to RI and resulted in increased growth inhibition by exogenous TGFβ1. In contrast, although stable transfection of an RII expression vector into the same GEO cells increased TGFβ1 binding to RII, growth inhibition by exogenous TGFβ1 was not altered. This indicated that the low level of RI is a limiting factor for the growth-inhibitory effects of TGFβ in GEO cells. RI-transfected cells were growth-arrested at a lower saturation density than GEO control cells. They also showed reduced growth and clonogenicity in plating efficiency and soft agarose assays, whereas RII-transfected cells did not show any differences from the NEO control cells in these assays. Tetracycline repressed RI expression in transfected cells and reversed the reduction in plating efficiency of RI-transfected clones, confirming that growth effects were due to increased RI expression in transfected cells. TGFβ1 neutralizing antibody stimulated the proliferation of RI-transfected cells but had little effect on GEO control cells, indicating that increased autocrine-negative TGFβ activity also resulted from increased RI expression. Tumorigenicity in athymic nude mice was significantly delayed in RI-transfected cells. These results indicate that low RI expression can be a limiting factor for response to exogenous TGFβ, as well as TGFβ autocrine-negative activity, and that reduction of RI expression can contribute to malignant progression."

During activation, cytosolic proteins p47phox, p67phox, Rac2, and possibly p40phox translocate to the plasma membrane and associate with flavocytochrome b to form the active superoxide-generating system. To further investigate the role of p67phox in this complex assembly process, experiments were performed to identify possible regions of interaction between p67phox and other NADPH oxidase proteins. Using random sequence peptide phage-display library analysis of p67phox, we identified a novel region in p47phox encompassing residues 323-332 and a previously identified SH3 binding domain encompassing p47phox residues 361-370 as p67phox binding sites. Synthetic peptides mimicking p47phox residues 323-332 inhibited the p47phox-p67phox binding interaction in an affinity binding assay; however, peptides mimicking flanking regions were inactive. Surprisingly, this same region of p47phox was found previously to represent a site of binding interaction for flavocytochrome b (DeLeo, F. R., Nauseef, W. M., Jesaitis, A. J., Burritt, J.

Using affinity binding assays, we also found that p67phox and flavocytochrome b competed for binding to p47phox after activation, suggesting that prior to full NADPH oxidase assembly the 323-332 region of p47phox is associated with p67phox and at some point in the activation process is transferred to flavocytochrome b. Thus, taken together our data demonstrate that both p67phox and flavocytochrome b utilize a common binding site in p47phox, presumably at distinct stages during the activation process, and this p47phox region plays a key role in regulating NADPH oxidase assembly.

INTRODUCTIONHuman neutrophils play an essential role in the body's defense against invasion of pathogenic organisms and are also one of the primary cell types involved in the inflammatory response. Upon exposure to a pathogenic stimulus, the neutrophil becomes activated and generates superoxide anion (O2) and other more potent antimicrobial agents (1Clark R.A. J. Infect. Dis. 1990; 161: 1140-1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 2Chanock S.J. El Benna J. Smith R.M. Babior B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24519-24522Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The generation of these oxidants by neutrophils occurs through the activation of a membrane-associated complex known as the NADPH oxidase. In resting cells, the components of the NADPH oxidase are segregated into cytosolic and membrane compartments; during activation, however, the cytosolic components translocate to the plasma membrane and assemble with membrane-bound components, resulting in the active, O2-generating system (2Chanock S.J.

Our data not only confirmed previous reports that the proline-rich carboxyl-terminal domain of p47phox (residues 361-370) is involved in p67phox binding (28Leto T.L. Adams A.G. de Mendez I. Proc.

Surprisingly, this same region of p47phox also binds to flavocytochrome b (30DeLeo F.R. Nauseef W.M. Jesaitis A.J. Burritt J.B. Clark R.A. Quinn M.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26246-26251Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), and our present studies now provide direct evidence that p47phox 323-332 represents a mutually exclusive binding site for both p67phox and flavocytochrome b and that this p47phox region plays a central role in NADPH oxidase assembly.DISCUSSIONThe nature of the p47phox-p67phox interaction and its function in human neutrophils is not well understood. Activation in neutrophils and in vitro using a cell-free assay system appears to cause a conformational change or unfolding of an active domain(s) in p47phox, allowing it to associate with or form a higher affinity association with p67phox and then translocate en bloc to the membrane where both stably associate with the active NADPH complex. Several recent reports indicate that these p67phox-p47phox complexes may be mediated by SH3 domain interactions (27Sumimoto H. Kage Y. Nunoi H. Sasaki H. Nose T. Fukumaki Y. Ohno M. Minakami S.

Leto T.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 240Google Scholar). However, the requirement for these interactions in initiating O2 production is uncertain as deletion of both p67phox SH3 domains has no effect on in vitro O2 reconstitution (32de Mendez I.

There are eight or nine p47phox phosphorylation sites within residues 303-379, including Ser-320 and Ser-328 which are in close proximity to the site of interaction identified in this report (50El Benna J. Faust L.P. Babior B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23431-23436Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 52Faust L.P. El Benna J. Babior B.M. Chanock S.J. J. Clin.

Chem. 1996; 271: 6374-6378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar), and it has been proposed that phosphorylation may serve to neutralize the p47phox cationic domain encompassing residues 314-347, thus allowing it to interact with the membrane or target protein.In an effort to further understand the interaction between p47phox and p67phox, we have utilized several approaches to identify and characterize potential sites of interaction of these proteins. Our present studies demonstrate the presence of a novel site in p47phox (residues 323-332) that binds p67phox after activation of the NADPH oxidase. This site was mapped using random sequence phage-display library analysis of p67phox and peptide mapping using protein affinity binding assays and in vitro NADPH oxidase assays. These experiments demonstrated that a peptide mimicking p47phox residues 323-332 completely blocked p47phox-p67phox association, whereas peptides representing flanking regions had no inhibitory effect. Thus, in addition to the interaction between the second SH3 domain of p67phox and the proline-rich carboxyl-tail of p47phox, which is present in resting cells, a further interaction between these proteins at p47phox residues 323-332 is induced during activation.Previously, we found that p47phox residues 323-342 represented a site of binding interaction with flavocytochrome b (30DeLeo F.R. Nauseef W.M. Jesaitis A.J. Burritt J.B. Clark R.A. Quinn M.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26246-26251Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), and this observation was confirmed in the present report using two different in vitro assays that were not evaluated previously. Thus, taken together our data suggest that both p67phox and flavocytochrome b utilize a common binding site in p47phox, presumably at distinct stages of the activation process. Using affinity binding assays, we confirmed that p67phox and flavocytochrome b do indeed compete for binding to p47phox and further demonstrated that p47phox 323-332 bound with high affinity to flavocytochrome b after activation and became inaccessible to peptide. Prior to assembly, however, this region of p47phox appears to be associated with p67phox and at some point in the activation process is transferred to flavocytochrome b.Previously, Leto et al. (28Leto T.L. Adams A.G. de Mendez I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10650-10654Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar) reported that a GST-fusion protein containing p47phox residues 280-338 did not bind to recombinant p67phox, and this region of p47phox encompasses the region we have reported here to associate with p67phox. One explanation for this disparity is that GST-fusion proteins of this region of p47phox do not accurately reflect conformational characteristics of the native protein and, therefore, are not capable of mediating a binding interaction between these molecules. In addition, Leto et al. (28Leto T.L. Adams A.G. de Mendez I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10650-10654Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar) tested their interactions using nonactivating or resting cell conditions. In contrast, we observed specific interactions mediated by p47phox 323-332 only after SDS activation, and none of the activation-induced conformational changes and/or charge neutralization in p47phox and p67phox would have been present in the assays of Leto et al.

Thus, studies using only nonactivated binding assays (28Leto T.L. Adams A.G. de Mendez I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10650-10654Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 34Leto T.L.

Med. 1995; 43: 287AGoogle Scholar) seem to provide accurate information about binding interactions occurring between the NADPH oxidase proteins in the resting cell but may fail to detect activation-induced interactive sites. In support of this conclusion, de Mendez et al. (34Leto T.L. Adams A.G. deMendez I. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 241Google Scholar) recently reported that the interaction between the second SH3 domain of p67phox and p47phox residues 358-171 occurs in the resting cell and, using phage-display library analysis, we confirmed their results (see Table I). However, we also report the presence of a novel, higher affinity binding site for p67phox in p47phox that is only utilized under activating conditions.The role of the p47phox-p67phox association in regulating NADPH oxidase assembly and activation is currently unknown. Using the cell-free NADPH oxidase assay, de Mendez et al. (32de Mendez I. Garrett M.C. Adams A.G. Leto T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16326-16332Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and Leusen et al. (33Leusen J.H.W. Fluiter K. Hilarius P.M. Roos D. Verhoeven A.J. Bolscher B.G.J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11216-11221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) found that the interaction between the carboxyl-terminal proline-rich region of p47phox and the second SH3 domain of p67phox was not required for activity in vitro but that this interaction was necessary for in vivo oxidase activity (32de Mendez I. Garrett M.C. Adams A.G. Leto T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16326-16332Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, our peptide analysis in the cell-free NADPH oxidase assay suggests that the association of p47phox with p67phox via p47phox residues 323-332 is also not required for assembly in vitro, and preassembly of p47phox with flavocytochrome b (which sequesters residues 323-332 from p67phox binding) had no effect on oxidase activity when p67phox was subsequently added to the assay (see Table III). Thus, the association of p67phox at this site must have a regulatory role that is only evident in vivo. One explanation, as modeled in Fig. 4, is that p67phox acts as an escort for facilitating the translocation of activated p47phox. As such, p67phox binds to activated p47phox residues 323-332 during translocation and, therefore, might conceal this cationic region from interacting nonspecifically via charge-charge interactions with other cellular proteins. Thus, in resting neutrophil cytosol, p47phox, p67phox, and p40phox reside in a large complex mediated by SH3 domain interactions, including an interaction of the p67phox carboxyl-terminal SH3 domain with the p47phox proline-rich region (represented by box A in Fig. 4), as reported previously (18Wientjes F.B.

This translocation process seems to be mediated both by increased p47phox phosphorylation (49Hayakawa T. Suzuki K. Suzuki S. Andrews P.C. Babior B.M. J. Biol.

Such a distinct regulatory role for p67phox is supported by the significantly higher levels of O2 observed in cell-free NADPH oxidase assays where p67phox was added after assembly of p47phox with flavocytochrome b. Additionally, Tamura et al. (54Tamura M. Takeshita M. Curnutte J.T. Uhlinger D.J. Lambeth J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7529-7538Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) found that chemically cross-linked NADPH oxidase complexes were stabilized by p47phox but were unstable if they contained p67phox in the absence of p47phox.

Chem. 1995; 270: 6543-6548Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) recently reported that p47phox and p67phox played distinct roles in controlling electron flow from NADPH to oxygen, and our present report supports their observations and provides further clues to explain how these proteins carry out their distinct functional roles. INTRODUCTIONHuman neutrophils play an essential role in the body's defense against invasion of pathogenic organisms and are also one of the primary cell types involved in the inflammatory response. Upon exposure to a pathogenic stimulus, the neutrophil becomes activated and generates superoxide anion (O2) and other more potent antimicrobial agents (1Clark R.A. J. Infect. Dis. 1990; 161: 1140-1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 2Chanock S.J. El Benna J. Smith R.M. Babior B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24519-24522Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The generation of these oxidants by neutrophils occurs through the activation of a membrane-associated complex known as the NADPH oxidase. In resting cells, the components of the NADPH oxidase are segregated into cytosolic and membrane compartments; during activation, however, the cytosolic components translocate to the plasma membrane and assemble with membrane-bound components, resulting in the active, O2-generating system (2Chanock S.J.

https://openalex.org/W2065469441,"Cytoplasmic acidification is now recognized as a feature of apoptosis in a variety of systems. However, its relation to other events in the process of apoptosis is not yet characterized. In this work, we examined the effect of BCL-2 overexpression on acidification mediated by cycloheximide treatment or Fas ligation in Jurkat T-lymphoblasts. We find that BCL-2 overexpression attenuates cytoplasmic acidification and apoptosis detected by annexin V labeling. Acidification and phosphatidylserine externalization were found to occur concurrently. We also examined the requirement for protease activation for cytoplasmic acidification to occur and found that inhibition of interleukin-1β converting enzyme/CED-3 family proteases (using carbobenzoxy-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethylketone, an inhibitor of these proteases) prevents acidification and apoptosis mediated by Fas ligation. These studies suggest that BCL-2 acts at a point upstream of acidification and that protease activation is also upstream of acidification."

Diverse phenotypic responses to TNF α reflect, at least in part, its ability to modulate the activity of both ubiquitous and tissue-specific transcription factors.

In macrophages, transcription of c-fos is induced by TNF α-initiated signals that activate microtubule-activated protein early response kinase, microtubule-activated protein early response kinase kinase, and early response kinase, leading to phosphorylation of ELK-1, which, in turn, increases the transcription of c-fos (1Winston B.W.

Minden A. Karin M. Brenner D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26396-26401Google Scholar). TNF α can also induce NF-κβ activity by triggering events that favor redistribution of this transcription factor from the cytosol to the nucleus (3Beg A.A. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Oncogene. 1994; 5: 1487-1492Google Scholar, 4Menon S.D. Guy G.R. Tan Y.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18881-18887Google Scholar, 5O'Connell M.A. Cleere R. Long A. O'Neill L.A. Kelleher D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7399-7404Google Scholar). Taken together, these data demonstrate that TNF α employs several post-transcriptional mechanisms to activate an array of ubiquitous transcription factors, which, in turn, influence the expression of diverse target genes. tumor necrosis factor partial hepatectomy CCAAT/enhancer binding protein interleukin. Evaluation of the regenerating liver after partial hepatectomy (PH) suggests that TNF α may also operate post-transcriptionally to activate members of the CCAAT/enhancer binding protein (C/EBP) family of transcription factors. Nuclear concentrations of C/EBP β and C/EBP δ proteins increase early during the prereplicative period after PH (6Diehl A.M. Yang S.Q. Hepatology. 1994; 19: 447-456Google Scholar, 7Diehl A.M.

Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18123-18132Google Scholar). These increases are inhibited in animals pretreated with neutralizing anti-TNF antibodies, although there is no difference in post-PH induction of their respective mRNAs (7Diehl A.M. Yang S.Q. Yin M. Lin H.Z. Nelson S. Bagby G. Hepatology. 1995; 22: 252-261Google Scholar). Because the C/EBPs regulate tissue-specific gene expression in hepatocytes, TNF-mediated alterations in C/EBP activity are likely to modulate liver-specific functions during liver regeneration. Indeed, during systemic inflammation, another situation that increases TNF α, the profile of hepatocyte gene expression is altered radically (11Akira S. Hirano T. Taga T. Kishimoto T. FASEB J. 1990; 4: 2860-2867Google Scholar). In that setting, TNF α is thought to regulate hepatocyte gene expression indirectly by inducing other cytokines (e.g., interleukins 1 and 6) that can interact directly with hepatocytes to activate C/EBP β and C/EBP δ (11Akira S. Hirano T. Taga T. Kishimoto T. FASEB J. 1990; 4: 2860-2867Google Scholar, 12Alam T. An M.R. Papaconstantinou J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5021-5024Google Scholar, 13Braiser A.R. Ron D. Tate J.E.

Kitao T. Nakamura T. Nakayama H. Fujita J. Imamura M. J. Surg. Res. 1995; 58: 267-274Google Scholar), it is unclear if TNF α or other cytokines are responsible for the observed variations in C/EBP expression that occur in the regenerating liver. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of human recombinant TNF α and synthetic TNF peptides that specifically activate either class 1 or class 2 TNF receptors on nuclear concentrations of C/EBP β and C/EBP δ in cultured hepatocytes and to determine if TNF-induced changes in the nuclear concentrations of these proteins require altered expression of their mRNAs. Our results indicate that activation of both classes of TNF receptors rapidly induce a transient increase in the nuclear concentrations of these C/EBP family members without altering the expression of their mRNAs or increasing total cellular concentrations of these C/EBP isoforms. Immunocytochemistry suggests that TNF-initiated changes in the subcellular distribution of C/EBP β and C/EBP δ are involved in post-transcriptional regulation of C/EBP activity. An adult rat hepatocyte line (RALA255-10G) was obtained from Dr. Janice Yang Chou in NIH (Human Genetics Branch, National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, Bethesda, MD) (17Chou J.Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1983; 3: 1013-1020Google Scholar). Recombinated TNF α was purchased from Genetech (San Francisco, CA). Mutated TNF polypeptides that bind specifically to either the p55 (R32W-S86T) or p75 (D143N-A145R) TNF receptors (18Loetscher H. Stueber D. Banner D. Mackay F. Lesslauer W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26350-26357Google Scholar) were gifts from Dr. Subroto Chatterjee (Dept. of Pediatrics, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD). cDNAs and antibodies to C/EB P α, C/EBP β, and C/EBP δ were generously provided by Dr. M. Daniel Lane (Department of Biological Chemistry, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD) (19MacDougald O.A. Cornelius P. Liu R. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 647-654Google Scholar). Antibodies were prepared by immunizing rabbits with peptides corresponding to an internal amino acid sequence of C/EBP α (present in both p42C/EBP α and p30C/EBP α) or to amino acids 278-295 (LRNLFKQLPEPLLASAGH) of C/EBP β or 115-130 (ARGPLKREPDWGDGDA) of C/EBP δ. As previously reported, affinity-purified antiserum used for Western blots or supershifting was specific for each C/EBP isoform, and interactions with other C/EBP isoforms were not observed (19MacDougald O.A. Cornelius P. Liu R. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 647-654Google Scholar, 20Lin F.T. MacDougald O.A. Diehl A.M. Lane M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9606-9610Google Scholar). All the other chemicals were from Sigma or J. T. Baker Inc. (Phillipsburg, NJ). The SV40 tsA255 virus-transformed rat adult liver cell line RALA255-10G (17Chou J.Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1983; 3: 1013-1020Google Scholar) was initially grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 4% fetal bovine serum for 3-5 days at 33°C. When cells reached about 70% confluence (time 0), cultures were treated with human recombinant TNF α or TNF mutant polypeptides for variable periods of time, ranging from 5 min to 24 h. Total RNA was extracted from cultured cells by the method of Chomczynski and Sacchi (21Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-161Google Scholar). 20 µg/lane of RNA samples was fractionated on denaturing agarose gels and transferred to GeneScreen membranes (NEN Research Products, Boston, MA). Membranes were stained with 0.04% methylene blue to confirm the lane-lane equivalency of RNA loading/transfer and then hybridized with cDNA probes for C/EBP β and C/EBP δ as described previously (7Diehl A.M. Yang S.Q. Yin M. Lin H.Z. Nelson S. Bagby G. Hepatology. 1995; 22: 252-261Google Scholar). After washing under stringent conditions, membranes were exposed to Kodak XAR film with intensifying screens. Autoradiograms from three to four unique experiments were analyzed by scanning laser densitometry (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). Parallel plates of similarly confluent cultures were used to isolated nuclear and whole cell protein. Nuclear protein was isolated by NUN buffer as described (22Lavery D.J. Schibler U. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1871-1884Google Scholar) with some modification. Briefly, cells were lysed in 10 mM Hepes, pH 7.5, 0.5 mM spermidine, 0.15 mM spermine, 5 mM EDTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 0.35 mM sucrose, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40. Nuclei were pelletted by centrifugation at 12000 × g and resuspended in NUN buffer containing 25 mM Hepes, pH 7.5, 300 mM NaCl, 1 M urea, 1% Nonidet P-40, and 1 mM dithiothreitol. Chromatin was removed by centrifugation, and the nuclear protein extract was aliquoted and stored at −70°C. To isolate the whole cell protein, cells were washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed on ice in RIPA buffer (phosphate-buffered saline, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, and 10 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) followed by centrifugation. The soluble protein portion was stored at −70°C. Treatment-related variations in C/EBP proteins were analyzed by Western blot, as described previously (7Diehl A.M. Yang S.Q. Yin M. Lin H.Z. Nelson S. Bagby G. Hepatology. 1995; 22: 252-261Google Scholar). In brief, proteins were separated on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred onto Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore Co. Bedford, MA). The blots were probed with affinity-purified polyclonal anti-C/EBP α, anti-C/EBP β, or anti-C/EBP δ antibodies, and proteins were visualized by the Enhanced Chemiluminescence detection system (Amersham Corp.). Blots obtained from three to four unique experiments were evaluated by scanning laser densitometry (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). Subcellular localization of C/EBPs was examined by fluorescent immunocytochemical staining of RALA cells according to Tse et al. (23Tse C.M. Ma A.I. Yang V.W. Watson A.J.M. Levine S. Montrose M.H. Potter J. Sardet C. Pouyssegur J. Donowitz M. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1957-1967Google Scholar). Cells were cultured on glass slides and fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde, 0.1 M lysine, 0.01 M sodium periodate, and 0.05 M phosphate buffer. After quenching with 0.25% NH4Cl and permeabilizing with 0.06% digitonin, slides were blocked with 0.2% gelatin, immunostained with primary antibodies to C/EBP β or C/EBP δ, and visualized by staining with the fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibody to rabbit IgG (Kirkgaard & Perry Lab. Inc., Gaithersburg, MD). Slides were examined under Zeiss Axioplan fluorescence microscope by two independent observers, and the number of cells with predominately nuclear or predominately cytoplasmic staining were quantitated in 10 high power (400×) fields/slide. Interobserver variation was <2%. Gel mobility shift assays were performed as described by Garner and Revzin (24Garner M.M. Revzin A. Nucleic Acid Res. 1981; 9: 3047-3060Google Scholar) and Fried and Crothers (25Fried Crothers D.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1981; 9: 6505-6525Google Scholar). Each 20-µl reaction mixture contained 8-10 µg of nuclear protein plus a γ-32P-labeled 25-base pair oligonucleotide probe containing the C/EBP binding site in the c-fos promoter (26Metz R. Ziff E. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1754-1766Google Scholar) in binding buffer (10 mM Hepes, pH 7.5, 0.5 mM spermidine, 0.15 mM spermine, 5 mM EDTA, 10 mM dithiothreitol, 0.35 mM sucrose). The reaction mixture was incubated at room temperature for 15 min and loaded directly onto a 6.5% polyacrylamide (49:0.6 acrylamide/bisacrylamide) gel in a buffer of 25 mM Tris borate (pH 8.0), 0.25 mM EDTA. In some experiments, antisera specific for unique C/EBP isoforms or preimmune sera were added to reaction mixtures to determine the composition of protein-probe complexes. For these “supershift” assays, extracts were incubated with 1 µl of preimmune sera or an equal volume of anti-C/EBP α, anti-C/EBP β, and/or anti-C/EBP δ antisera at 4°C for 30 min prior to addition of γ-32P-labeled probe. In all experiments, proteins were separated by electrophoresis at 200 V for 2 h at room temperature. Gels were dried and exposed to Kodak XAR film with intensifying screens. Assays were repeated with nuclear extracts obtained from three unique experiments and evaluated by phosphoimage analysis to ensure reproducibility of results. To determine if TNF α acts directly on hepatocytes to alter nuclear concentrations of C/EBP β and/or C/EBP δ, human recombinant TNF α was added to the SV40 virus conditionally transformed adult rat hepatocyte line (RALA255) during culture at the permissive temperature (33°C). As shown in Fig. 1, nuclear concentrations of C/EBP β and C/EBP δ double within 5 min of TNF treatment and remain 2-4-fold greater than untreated cultures for 30 min. Increased nuclear concentrations of the C/EBPs are not likely to be mediated by increased synthesis of these proteins because mRNA and whole cell protein concentrations of C/EBP β (Fig. 2) and C/EBP δ (data not shown) remain relatively constant during this time. Immunocytochemistry indicates that under these conditions, TNF causes a rapid redistribution of C/EBP β (Fig. 3) and C/EBP δ (Fig. 4) into the nucleus. To determine if these effects of human recombinant TNF α, which predominately activates class 1 TNF receptors, can also result from TNF receptor 2-initiated signals, experiments were repeated with synthetic peptide ligands that have been shown to selectively activate either class 1 (p55) or class 2 (p75) TNF receptors (18Loetscher H. Stueber D. Banner D. Mackay F. Lesslauer W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26350-26357Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 5, nuclear concentrations of C/EBP δ increase within 5 min and remain elevated for 30 min after treatment with either ligand. Increases in nuclear C/EBP β are also short-lived but appear to occur sooner after the addition of the p75 agonist than after addition of the p55 agonist. Thus, both ligands cause a rapid, albeit transient, increase in the nuclear concentrations of C/EBP β and C/EBP δ. In contrast, nuclear concentrations of a closely related transcription factor, C/EBP α, transiently decrease after treatment with either agent (Fig. 5). TNF α-dependent increases in the nuclear concentrations of C/EBP β and C/EBP δ are accompanied by increased binding activity of these C/EBP isoforms. As shown in Fig. 6, complex formation between nuclear extracts and the oligonucleotide probe is increased 3-fold in cells treated with either the p55 or p75 mutein for 10 min. Supershift experiments confirm that this is predominately due to increased C/EBP β and C/EBP δ binding activity (Fig. 6).Fig. 2Effect of TNF α on the expression of C/EBP β mRNA and total cellular C/EBP β protein. Parallel RALA cell cultures were maintained at 33°C and treated with the same concentration of human recombinant TNF α (60 ng/ml) for 0, 10, 30, or 180 min. Total RNA was isolated from one group and treatment-related variations in C/EBP β mRNA levels were evaluated by Northern blot analysis as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Cell lysates were prepared from the other cultures at identical time points, and variations in whole cell C/EBP β protein expression were analyzed by Western blot (100 µg of total cellular protein/lane) as detailed under “Experimental Procedures.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Fig. 3Subcellular localization of C/EBP β protein before and after TNF α treatment. RALA255-10G cells were cultured at 33°C; human recombinant TNF α (60 ng/ml) was added to the plates for 30 min, and then the plates were washed extensively and processed for immunocytochemistry (see “Experimental Procedures”) to detect treatment-related differences in the compartmentalization of C/EBP β protein. In all experiments, parallel cultures treated with preimmune sera or primary anti-C/EBP β antisera that had been preincubated with in vitro translated C/EBP β protein demonstrated no fluorescence after treatment with the secondary fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated antibody (data not shown). A, representative photomicrographs of anti-C/EBP β stained cells before and after TNF α treatment. B, graphical summary of results obtained in four separate experiments. Over 100 positively stained cells were counted in each experiment and ranked for either predominately nuclear or predominately cytoplasmic staining by two independent observers who were unaware whether or not the slides were obtained before or after TNF treatment.

RALA255-10G cells were treated as described in the legend to Fig. 3, and cultures were processed to detect treatment related differences in the compartmentalization of C/EBP δ protein. A, representative photomicrographs of anti-C/EBP δ stained cells before and after TNF α treatment. B, graphical summary of results obtained in three unique experiments. The data were obtained as described in the legend to Fig. 3. The results are expressed as the mean percentages ± S.E.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Fig. 5Effect of mutant TNF ligands on nuclear concentrations of different C/EBP isoforms. 33°C RALA cells were treated with mutant peptides that specifically bind to either TNF class-1 (p55) or TNF class-1 (p75) receptors. Each ligand was used at a final concentration of 60 ng/ml. Nuclear protein was purified from cells before (time 0) or at various time points (5, 10, or 30 min and 3 or 24 h) after addition the of each ligand. Treatment-related variations in C/EBP α (top panel), C/EBP β (middle panel), and C/EBP δ (bottom panel) expression were analyzed by Western blot (40 µg of nuclear protein/lane; see “Experimental Procedures”). The results shown were obtained by reprobing a single blot for each isoform. Densitometric analysis of four unique blots confirms the reproducibility of these results.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Fig. 6DNA binding activities of C/EBPs in RALA cells. A, oligonucleotides containing the C/EBP binding site in c-fos promoter were incubated with nuclear extracts from RALA cells cultured at 33°C without (lanes 1-4) or with p55 TNF muteins (lanes 5-8) or p75 TNF muteins (lanes 9-12) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The DNA-protein complexes were separated from free probe by polyacrymide gel electrophoresis. In some reactions (lanes 2-4, 6-8, and 10-12), specific antibodies against C/EBPs were added to the binding reaction to distinguish the binding specificity. Lanes 2, 6, and 10 include antisera to C/EBP α; lanes 3, 7, and 11 include antisera to C/EBP β; and lanes 4, 8, and 12 include antisera to C/EBP δ. Supershifting of protein-probe complexes is apparent only in lanes that include antisera to C/EBP β or C/EBP δ. B, control experiments confirm specificity of binding reactions with this oligonucleotide. Comparison of lanes 1 (no protein), 2 (10 µg of protein), and 4 (2 µg of protein) demonstrates that binding activity is dependent on protein concentration. The addition of antisera to C/EBP α, C/EBP β, and C/EBP δ (lane 3) or 20-fold molar excess unlabeled C/EBP oligonucleotide (lane 5) significantly reduces binding activity; 20-fold molar excess unlabeled AP-1 oligonucleotide does not (lane 6).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The finding that TNF α receptor activation directly stimulates nuclear accumulation of C/EBP β and C/EBP δ in hepatocytes is novel. Published work in animal models suggests that during acute inflammatory responses, TNF α modulates the hepatocyte phenotype indirectly, by inducing other cytokines such as IL-1 and IL-6 (11Akira S. Hirano T. Taga T. Kishimoto T. FASEB J. 1990; 4: 2860-2867Google Scholar). Although recombinant TNF α can down-regulate C/EBP α expression in several cell lines (27Cornelius P. Marlowe M. Lee M.D. Pekala P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20506-20516Google Scholar), an indirect role for TNF α in C/EBP β and C/EBP δ induction has been presumed because, in vitro, recombinant IL-1 or IL-6 can reproduce most of changes in C/EBP-regulated gene expression that occur in vivo during an acute inflammatory response. In particular, IL-1 and IL-6 have been shown to increase the respective DNA binding activities of C/EBP β and C/EBP δ, important transcriptional regulators of hepatic acute phase response genes (11Akira S. Hirano T. Taga T. Kishimoto T. FASEB J. 1990; 4: 2860-2867Google Scholar, 12Alam T. An M.R. Papaconstantinou J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5021-5024Google Scholar, 13Braiser A.R. Ron D. Tate J.E. Habener J.F. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3933-3944Google Scholar, 14Poli V. Mancini F.P. Cortese R. Cell. 1990; 63: 643-653Google Scholar). The present results demonstrate that at least in this conditionally transformed adult hepatocyte line, TNF α interacts directly with its receptors to rapidly increase nuclear concentrations of these C/EBP isoforms. Indeed, this in vitro response closely mimics the kinetics of C/EBP β and δ induction, which occurs during liver regeneration after PH in intact rats (6Diehl A.M. Yang S.Q. Hepatology. 1994; 19: 447-456Google Scholar, 7Diehl A.M. Yang S.Q. Yin M. Lin H.Z. Nelson S. Bagby G. Hepatology. 1995; 22: 252-261Google Scholar, 8Flodby R. Antonson P. Barlow C. Blanck A. Porsch-Hallstrom I. Xanthopoulos K.G. Exp. Cell Res. 1993; 208: 248-256Google Scholar, 9Mohn K.L. Laz T.M. Melby A.E. Taub R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 265: 21914-21921Google Scholar, 10Rana B. Xie Y. Mischoulon D. Bucher N.L.R. Farmer S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18123-18132Google Scholar). This observation, coupled with the fact that PH induction of these C/EBP isoforms is inhibited by pretreatment with neutralizing anti-TNF antibodies (7Diehl A.M. Yang S.Q. Yin M. Lin H.Z. Nelson S. Bagby G. Hepatology. 1995; 22: 252-261Google Scholar), suggests that TNF α may also directly mediate C/EBP β and C/EBP δ induction in vivo. Although it is apparent that several pro-inflammatory cytokines can increase the activity of C/EBP β and C/EBP δ in hepatocytes, the mechanisms involved have not been identified. To our knowledge, altered compartmentalization of cytokine-inducible C/EBP isoforms have not been reported after treatment with TNF α or TNF-inducible cytokines. Perhaps this is because technical problems are likely to confound efforts to identify variations in the subcellular localization of these C/EBPs in hepatocytes. Commercially available anti-C/EBP β and anti-C/EBP δ antibodies recognize several cross-reacting antigens on immunoblots of liver extracts (28Diehl A.M. Michaelson P. Yang S.Q. Gastroenterology. 1994; 106: 1625-1637Google Scholar), and hence, immunocytochemical variations in antigen expression may be nonspecific. Furthermore, hepatocyte isolation and culture conditions often induce C/EBP β and C/EBP δ (9Mohn K.L. Laz T.M. Melby A.E. Taub R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 265: 21914-21921Google Scholar, 10Rana B. Xie Y. Mischoulon D. Bucher N.L.R. Farmer S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18123-18132Google Scholar), making it difficult to detect further cytokine-mediated induction of these isoforms. The present experiments were designed to minimize these obstacles. The anti-C/EBP β and anti-C/EBP δ antibodies employed were raised against specific internal domains of each C/EBP peptide (19MacDougald O.A. Cornelius P. Liu R. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 647-654Google Scholar, 20Lin F.T. MacDougald O.A. Diehl A.M. Lane M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9606-9610Google Scholar) and affinity-purified, and antibody specificity was validated by immunoblot analysis before proceeding to immunocytochemistry. All immunocytochemical data were also confirmed by immunoblot and gel mobility shift analyses of nuclear extracts prepared from parallel cultures. Studies were done in RALA255 cells, a conditionally transformed adult hepatocyte line that was selected because when cultured at the permissive temperature, this cell line expresses trivial levels of C/EBP β and C/EBP δ proteins in the nucleus (29Diehl A.M. Johns D.C. Yang S.Q. Lin H.Z. Yin M. Matelis L.A. Lawrence J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7343-7350Google Scholar, 30Liu J.-K. DiPersio C.M. Zaret K.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 773-784Google Scholar). In this regard, RALA255 cells cultured at 33°C more closely approximate mature hepatocytes in the healthy liver than do hepatocytes in primary culture, because hepatocytes in the healthy adult liver constitutively express relatively little C/EBP β and C/EBP δ (6Diehl A.M. Yang S.Q. Hepatology. 1994; 19: 447-456Google Scholar, 7Diehl A.M. Yang S.Q. Yin M. Lin H.Z. Nelson S. Bagby G. Hepatology. 1995; 22: 252-261Google Scholar, 8Flodby R. Antonson P. Barlow C. Blanck A. Porsch-Hallstrom I. Xanthopoulos K.G. Exp. Cell Res. 1993; 208: 248-256Google Scholar, 9Mohn K.L. Laz T.M. Melby A.E. Taub R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 265: 21914-21921Google Scholar). Low “background” nuclear expression of these C/EBP isoforms in RALA255 hepatocytes facilitates identification of TNF α-mediated increases in nuclear C/EBP β and C/EBP δ concentrations. TNF α is recognized by a binary system of receptors with apparent molecular masses of 55 (p55) and 75 kDa (p75), which belong to the TNF/nerve growth factor receptor family. Binding of TNF α to either receptor provokes receptor oligomerization and initiates signal transduction. Most cell lines and primary tissues coexpress both receptor types, although distinct mechanisms control expression of p55 and p75. Typically, p55 is constitutively expressed at relatively low levels, whereas p75 expression is induced by external stimuli (31Brockhaus M. Schoenfeld H.J. Schlaeger E.J. Hunziker W. Kesskauer W. Loetscher H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 3127-3131Google Scholar, 32Thoma B. Grell M. Pfizenmaier K. Scheurich P. J. Exp. Med. 1990; 172: 1019-1023Google Scholar). Different cellular proteins associate with the two receptors, suggesting that they may independently regulate separate cellular responses (33Hsu H. Xiong J. Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1995; 81: 495-504Google Scholar, 34Rothe M. Wong S.C. Henzel W.J. Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1994; 78: 681-692Google Scholar). For example, specific activation of p55 typically induces cytotoxicity (35Brakehbusch C. Nophar Y. Kemper O. Engelmann H. Wallach D. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 943-950Google Scholar, 36Tartaglia L.A.

A. 1991; 88: 9292-9296Google Scholar), whereas stimulation of p75 often induces proliferation (37Tartaglia L.A. Weber R.F. Figari I.S. Rdynolds C. Palladino Jr., M.A. Goeddel D.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9292-9296Google Scholar, 38Espevik T. Brockhaus M. Loetscher H. Nonstad U. Shalaby R. J. Exp. Med. 1990; 171: 415-426Google Scholar, 39Naume B. Shalaby R. Lesslauer W. Especvik T. J. Immunol. 1991; 146: 3045-3048Google Scholar), although cooperative interactions between the two classes of receptors have also been documented (40Gehr G. Gentz R. Brockhaus M. Loetscher H. Lesslauer W. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 911-917Google Scholar, 41Grell M. Douni E. Wajant H. Lohden M. Cluss M. Maxeiner B. Georgopoulos S. Lesslauer W. Kollias G. Pfizenmaier K. Scheurich P. Cell. 1995; 83: 793-802Google Scholar). Recent evidence suggests that the two receptors may also differ in their sensitivity to different forms of TNF α. In several cell lines, p55 is activated preferentially by soluble TNF α, whereas membrane-associated TNF α is a better activator of p75 (14Poli V. Mancini F.P. Cortese R. Cell. 1990; 63: 643-653Google Scholar). The present results indicate that in rat hepatocytes, both TNF receptors can initiate signals that result in nuclear localization of C/EBP β and C/EBP δ. Indeed, given the relatively low affinity of rodent p75 receptors for the p75 mutants (18Loetscher H. Stueber D. Banner D. Mackay F. Lesslauer W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26350-26357Google Scholar), similarities in the responses evoked by the two TNF mutants suggest that p75 may play a major role in transducing this TNF α-initiated signal in vivo, particularly after PH when hepatic TNF α expression is relatively modest (42Satoh M. Adachi K. Suda T. Yamazaki M.N. Mizumo D. Mol. Biother. 1991; 3: 136-147Google Scholar). TNF activation of its receptors initiates signals that regulate gene expression at multiple levels. Post-transcriptional mechanisms appear to play particularly important roles in TNF α regulation of transcription factors. For example, TNF α induces Jun nuclear kinase, which phosphorylates c-Jun, increasing the transcriptional activity of AP-1 (2Westwick J.K. Weitzel C. Minden A. Karin M. Brenner D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26396-26401Google Scholar). TNF α also leads to hyperphosphorylation of IκBα, which permits NF-κB to move into the nucleus and activate the transcription of κB-regulated genes (3Beg A.A. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Oncogene. 1994; 5: 1487-1492Google Scholar, 4Menon S.D. Guy G.R. Tan Y.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18881-18887Google Scholar, 5O'Connell M.A. Cleere R. Long A. O'Neill L.A. Kelleher D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7399-7404Google Scholar). Post-transcriptional events have been incriminated in cytokine-dependent induction of C/EBP β and δ because treatment with agents (e.g., bacterial lipopolysaccharide) that increase TNF α and TNF-inducible cytokines stimulates dramatic increases in the DNA binding activities of C/EBP β and C/EBP δ but induces relatively small increases in the transcription of these C/EBPs (12Alam T. An M.R. Papaconstantinou J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5021-5024Google Scholar). C/EBP β can be a target for post-transcriptional regulation. Both protein kinase A (43Trautwein C. Caelles C. Van der Greer P. Hunter T. Karin M. Chojkier M. Nature. 1993; 364: 544-547Google Scholar) and calcium calmodulin-dependent kinase (44Wegner M. Cao Z. Rosenfeld M.G. Science. 1992; 256: 370-373Google Scholar) have been shown to phosphorylate C/EBP β. Phosphorylation modulates the DNA binding and transcriptional activity of C/EBP β, but it is unknown if changes in phosphorylation influence subcellular compartmentalization of this protein. However, in one report, treatments that increased cAMP in PC-12 cells led to a redistribution of C/EBP β from the cytosol to the nucleus (26Metz R. Ziff E. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1754-1766Google Scholar). The present results demonstrate that TNF α induces nuclear localization of C/EBP β. This is unlikely to be mediated by cAMP-dependent mechanisms because TNF α inhibits activation of adenylyl cyclase and reduces intracellular cAMP concentrations (45Chung M.D. Gulick T.S. Rotondo R.E. Schreiner G.F. Lange L.G. Circ. Res. 1990; 67: 753-763Google Scholar). Further investigation of the mechanisms responsible for TNF α-initiated redistribution of cytokine-inducible C/EBP isoforms will be required to clarify the molecular basis for this response. The process has important physiological implications because it permits TNF α to affect rapid changes in hepatocyte gene transcription, enabling these cells to respond immediately to acute inflammatory stress."

However, the intracellular signal transduction pathways by which occupancy of neutrophil adenosine A2A receptors inhibits superoxide anion generation (O2) are not well understood. We, therefore, tested the hypothesis that signaling at polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMN) adenosine receptors proceeds via activation of a serine/threonine protein phosphatase (pp). Both the specific pp1 inhibitor calyculin A (10 nM) and the pp2A inhibitor okadaic acid (10 µM) enhanced O2 generation (185 ± 24 and 189 ± 35% of control, respectively, p < 0.0001 for both, n = 8), as reported previously. Calyculin A, but not okadaic acid, completely reversed inhibition of stimulated O2 generation by the adenosine A2 receptor agonist 5′-N-ethylcarboxamidoadenosine (NECA; IC50 = 30 nM; p < 0.0001, analysis of variance). Calyculin A also reversed the adenosine receptor-mediated desensitization of bound chemoattractant receptors in neutrophils. Treatment of PMNs with NECA increased the pp1 activity of crude membrane preparations in a time- and dose-dependent fashion (EC50 = 40 nM; p < 0.001, analysis of variance, n = 5). NECA inhibited cytosolic protein phosphatase activity by 78 ± 12% (p < 0.003, n = 6) but did not shift pp1 catalytic subunit from cytosol to plasma membrane. Similar changes were observed in neutrophil cytoplasts depleted of organelles and nucleus. Moreover, the selective protein kinase A inhibitor KT5720 (10 µM) reversed the capacity of dibutyryl cAMP but not NECA to increase pp1 activity (p < 0.01, n = 5) in keeping with its effects on O2 generation. Western blot analysis of PMN subcellular fractions demonstrated the presence of pp1α and pp1γ1 but not pp1γ2 isotypes in both cytosol and plasma membrane but not in azurophil or specific granules.

INTRODUCTIONAt the junction between motor neurons and skeletal muscle, the receptor protein for acetylcholine, the nicotinic receptor (AChR), 1The abbreviations used are: AChRacetylcholine receptornlsnuclear localization signalntnucleotide(s)MCKmuscle creatine kinase. displays a highly restricted spatial distribution. Under the motor nerve terminal, its surface density is very high, while it sharply decreases about 3 orders of magnitude a few micrometers from the junctional zones (for a review, see 1Hall Z.W.

This precise localization of the AChR protein at the adult neuromuscular junction results from a progressive evolution from an initial state where the receptor protein is expressed all along the muscle fibers. The compartmentalization of the AChR protein is accompanied by a similar compartmentalization of the mRNAs coding for its different subunits (α, β, γ/ε, δ) (3Fontaine B. Sassoon D. Buckingham M.

The accumulation of AChR mRNAs for α, β, γ, and δ subunits at the level of end plates takes place early on during embryogenesis development (7Piette J. Huchet M. Houzelstein D. Changeux J.P. Dev.

Nature. 1990; 344: 544-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Transgenesis experiments using several AChR gene promoters strongly suggest that mRNA localization might, at least partly, result from a higher transcription rate of AChR genes in synaptic nuclei (8Klarsfeld A.

These studies demonstrated that several regulatory elements contribute to the repression of AChR genes in extrajunctional areas.

Development. 1994; 120: 1799-1804PubMed Google Scholar).The data on the elements responsible for the induction and maintenance of AChR gene transcription at the synapse are still scarce. Fragments of AChR gene promoters confer synapse-specific transgene expression in mouse muscle (8Klarsfeld A. Bessereau J.L. Salmon A.M. Triller A. Babinet C. Changeux J.P. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 625-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 9Sanes J.R. Johnson Y.R. Kotzbauer P.T. Mudd J. Hanley T. Martinou J.C. Merlie J.P.

Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1535-1544Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). At variance with muscle-specific transcription and activity dependent repression, myogenic binding sites seem dispensable for expression in synaptic nuclei (29Tang J. Jo S.A. Burden S.J. Development. 1994; 120: 1799-1804PubMed Google Scholar, 31Duclert A. Savatier N. Changeux J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3043-3047Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). However, an element from the mouse δ-subunit gene promoter which confers synaptic expression was recently discovered (32Koike S. Schaeffer L. Changeux J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10624-10628Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar).We chose to analyze the promoter region of the ε-subunit gene (9Sanes J.R. Johnson Y.R. Kotzbauer P.T. Mudd J. Hanley T. Martinou J.C. Merlie J.P. Development. 1991; 113: 1181-1191PubMed Google Scholar, 17Numberger M. Durr I. Kues W. Koenen M. Witzemann V. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2957-2964Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) for several reasons (31Duclert A. Savatier N. Changeux J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3043-3047Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). First, the ε-subunit mRNA is expressed only a few days before birth (5Brenner H.R. Witzemann V. Sakmann B. Nature. 1990; 344: 544-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 33Brenner H.R. Rotzler S. Kues W.A. Witzemann V. Sakmann B. Dev. Biol. 1994; 165: 527-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Second, from the beginning, its distribution is restricted to regions around synaptic nuclei. Third, denervation which produces a reappearance of other AChR mRNAs in extrajunctional zones (for a review, see 34Laufer R. Changeux J.P. Mol. Neurobiol. 1989; 3: 1-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) does not affect the synaptic localization of ε-mRNAs (5Brenner H.R. Witzemann V. Sakmann B.

Thus, the regulatory region of the ε-subunit gene probably contains elements important for synapse-specific expression, while it might lack some active elements required for muscle-specific expression along the fibers. We have already shown in a preceding paper (31Duclert A. Savatier N. Changeux J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3043-3047Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) that an 83-nucleotide fragment upstream the transcription start site of the ε-subunit gene is able to confer preferential synaptic expression to a LacZ reporter gene in a transient expression assay in whole muscle. Here, we present a detailed study of this promoter region using the same in vivo injection technique. We have identified an element required for preferential synaptic expression and have analyzed its function by point mutagenesis. We also show that this element is able to bind a protein complex with the same binding specificity.

These studies demonstrated that several regulatory elements contribute to the repression of AChR genes in extrajunctional areas.

Fragments of AChR gene promoters confer synapse-specific transgene expression in mouse muscle (8Klarsfeld A. Bessereau J.L. Salmon A.M. Triller A. Babinet C. Changeux J.P.

Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1535-1544Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). At variance with muscle-specific transcription and activity dependent repression, myogenic binding sites seem dispensable for expression in synaptic nuclei (29Tang J. Jo S.A. Burden S.J. Development. 1994; 120: 1799-1804PubMed Google Scholar, 31Duclert A. Savatier N. Changeux J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3043-3047Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). However, an element from the mouse δ-subunit gene promoter which confers synaptic expression was recently discovered (32Koike S. Schaeffer L. Changeux J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10624-10628Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar).We chose to analyze the promoter region of the ε-subunit gene (9Sanes J.R. Johnson Y.R. Kotzbauer P.T. Mudd J. Hanley T. Martinou J.C. Merlie J.P. Development. 1991; 113: 1181-1191PubMed Google Scholar, 17Numberger M. Durr I. Kues W. Koenen M. Witzemann V.

A. 1993; 90: 3043-3047Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). First, the ε-subunit mRNA is expressed only a few days before birth (5Brenner H.R. Witzemann V. Sakmann B. Nature. 1990; 344: 544-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 33Brenner H.R. Rotzler S. Kues W.A. Witzemann V. Sakmann B. Dev. Biol. 1994; 165: 527-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Second, from the beginning, its distribution is restricted to regions around synaptic nuclei. Third, denervation which produces a reappearance of other AChR mRNAs in extrajunctional zones (for a review, see 34Laufer R. Changeux J.P. Mol. Neurobiol. 1989; 3: 1-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) does not affect the synaptic localization of ε-mRNAs (5Brenner H.R. Witzemann V. Sakmann B. Nature. 1990; 344: 544-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 35Witzemann V. Brenner H.R. Sakmann B. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 125-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Thus, the regulatory region of the ε-subunit gene probably contains elements important for synapse-specific expression, while it might lack some active elements required for muscle-specific expression along the fibers. We have already shown in a preceding paper (31Duclert A. Savatier N. Changeux J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3043-3047Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) that an 83-nucleotide fragment upstream the transcription start site of the ε-subunit gene is able to confer preferential synaptic expression to a LacZ reporter gene in a transient expression assay in whole muscle. Here, we present a detailed study of this promoter region using the same in vivo injection technique. We have identified an element required for preferential synaptic expression and have analyzed its function by point mutagenesis. We also show that this element is able to bind a protein complex with the same binding specificity."

Using stably integrated gene fusions comprising the human topoisomerase IIα promoter with a growth hormone reporter gene, we have localized elements required for the differential activity of the topoisomerase IIα promoter in proliferating and confluence-arrested cells. Deletion analysis localized the region of the promoter that responded to changes in the cellular growth state to between −101 and −144 base pairs. Mutation analysis identified an inverted CCAAT box (ICB) located at −108 to −104 as necessary for promoter down-regulation in confluence-arrested cells, while several other potential cis-acting elements, including four additional ICBs, were shown not to be required. The critical ICB was recognized in vitro by the CCAAT box binding factor, NF-Y, with levels of binding activity higher in extracts from proliferating cells than from confluence-arrested cells. We conclude that the differential regulation of topoisomerase IIα gene expression in cycling and confluence-arrested cells is mediated, at least in part, through proliferation-specific binding of factors to an ICB element in the gene promoter.

Topoisomerase II is a homodimeric nuclear enzyme required for many different aspects of DNA metabolism. Mutations in the genes encoding budding and fission yeast topoisomerase II enzymes cause a loss of cell viability due to a failure to segregate newly replicated chromosomes at mitosis (1DiNardo S.

Many of the other roles performed by topoisomerase II are not essential for the maintenance of cell viability, probably because they are shared with topoisomerase I. Included in this latter category are roles as a replication “swivelase” and as a suppressor of chromosome instability in regions of the genome containing repetitive DNA elements (reviewed in 5Wang J.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 665-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (1634) Google Scholar, 6Wang J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6659-6662Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Sharma A. Mondragon A.

Many of the key functional analyses on topoisomerase II have been performed in yeast both because of the availability of temperature-sensitive top2 mutants in these organisms and because yeast cells express only one topoisomerase II protein. In contrast, human cells express two closely related but genetically distinct isozymes of topoisomerase II designated topoisomerase IIα and -β (9Tsai-Pflugfelder M.T. Liu L.F. Liu A.A. Tewey K.M.

The respective roles of the two human isozymes are unknown, although both can functionally substitute for their yeast counterparts (15Wasserman R.A. Austin C.A. Fisher L.M. Wang J.C.

In mammalian cells, topoisomerase IIα and/or -β are among the most important cellular targets for a range of anticancer drugs (reviewed in 17Osheroff N. Zechiedrich E.L. Gale K.C.

High levels of topoisomerase II gene expression correlate with relative sensitivity of cells to these agents, while low levels confer relative drug resistance. For this reason, considerable effort has been devoted to understanding the mechanisms by which topoisomerase II genes are regulated in mammalian cells. Identification of the mechanisms that regulate topoisomerase IIα gene expression in vivo may permit specific modulation of tumor cell chemosensitivity. In addition, the two topoisomerase II genes appear to be differentially regulated both in vivo and in cultured cell lines during changes in cellular growth. The β isozyme of topoisomerase II is expressed ubiquitously in vivo and is present in both proliferating and quiescent cell populations in vitro. In contrast, the α isozyme is one of the best available markers of the proliferative state of cells in vitro and in vivo (21Woessner R.D. Chung T.D.Y. Hofmann G.A. Mattern M.R. Mirabelli M.R.

Topoisomerase IIα protein is virtually absent from cells induced to undergo growth arrest by serum withdrawal. Moreover, after the release of cells from a serum-deprived state, topoisomerase IIα protein appears to accumulate to a significant level only in the G2 and M phases of the subsequent cell cycle (22Woessner R.D. Mattern M.R. Mirabelli C.K. Johnson R.K. Drake F.H. Cell Growth & Differ. 1991; 2: 209-214PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with this, immunohistochemical studies have shown that topoisomerase IIα protein is undetectable in quiescent or differentiated cell populations in vivo but is present in the proliferative cell fraction of all tissues (23Boege F. Andersen A. Jensen S. Zeidler R. Kreipe H. Am. J. Pathol. 1995; 146: 1302-1308PubMed Google Scholar, 24D'Andrea M.R. Farber P.A. Foglesong P.D.

Stanway C.A. Harris A.L. Hickson I.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18961-18965Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have now extended that work to an analysis of the elements in the promoter that are necessary for the differential regulation of the topoisomerase IIα gene in proliferating and confluence-arrested cell populations.

Human MCF-7 breast carcinoma cells and mouse fibroblasts derived from Swiss 3T3 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 3 mM glutamine, and antibiotics in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2 at 37°C. The pHGH plasmid used for all constructs was pGEM-7Zf(+) (Promega), containing the 1.8-kilobase pair cDNA for human growth hormone (HGH) as a reporter gene. pHGH was derived from pSVGH (30Pugh C.W. Ebert B.L. Ebrahim O. Ratcliffe P.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1217: 297-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), which was a generous gift from Dr. J. Firth, Oxford, UK. Deletion constructs containing various truncated forms of the topoisomerase IIα promoter were generated by PCR from the full-length 2.5-kilobase pair fragment of the promoter (26Hochhauser D. Stanway C.A. Harris A.L. Hickson I.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18961-18965Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PCR primers incorporated restriction sites to enable directional cloning via the XbaI and HindIII or the BamHI sites in pHGH. Sequences for the 5′ primers used in generating the promoter truncations were as follows. The 5′ limit of each primer is indicated at the left of the sequence (numbering begins at +1, the transcription start site): −1964, 5′-GATCGAATTCCACTAGTTCTAGAGACACAC-3′; −617, 5′-GATCTCTAGAGCCACCGCACACAGCCTACTT-3′; −249, 5′-GATCTCTAGAGCCTCTCTAACTGTCCCT-3′; −210, 5′-GATCTCTAGATTTGAAGCCTCTCTAGTCC-3′; −144, 5′-GATCTCTAGAAGCCGTTCATAGGTGGATAT-3′; −101, 5′-GATCTCTAGACTTCTGGACGGAGACGGTGA-3′; and −56, 5′-GATCTCTAGAGCTTCGGGCGGGCT-3′. In each case, the 3′ primer that ran up to the translation start site was ATG, 5′-GGATCAAGCTTATGGTGACGGTCGTGAAGG-3′. After directional cloning of the PCR products into pHGH, the orientation and sequence of all promoter fragments were confirmed using nucleotide sequencing. This was performed using the Muta-gene in vitro mutagenesis system (Bio-Rad), which utilizes oligonucleotide primers containing the appropriate point mutations, and a single-stranded template into which uracil residues have been incorporated to permit selection against the template strand of DNA. This protocol was based on the method of Kunkel (31Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (4878) Google Scholar). The pHGH derivative containing the −617 promoter fragment was used to generate single-stranded DNA templates. Primers used for mutating the ICB1, ICB2, and first GC box consensus (termed GC1) elements were as follows: mutant GC1, 5′-GGTCTGCTTCGTGCGTGCTAAAGG-3′; mutant ICB1, 5′-AGTCAGGGATTCCCTGGTCTGCTT-3′; and mutant ICB2, 5′-AAGCTACGATTCCTTCTTCTGGAC-3′. Nucleotide sequencing was performed on double-stranded plasmid templates using the dideoxy chain termination method and Sequenase enzyme, as recommended by the suppliers (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). Transfection was performed using the calcium phosphate precipitation method of Graham and van der Eb (32Graham F.L. van der Eb A.J. Virology. 1973; 54: 536-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). Precipitates were prepared using 20 µg of reporter plasmid and 2 µg of pMAMNeo, the latter being used to permit selection of transfected clones in the presence of G418 at 800 µg/ml. Final concentrations in the precipitates were 1 × Hepes-buffered saline (5 g/liter Hepes, pH 7.1, 8 g/liter NaCl), 0.35 mM Na2HPO4, 35 mM NaH2PO4, and 125 mM CaCl2. Maximal transfection was achieved by leaving the cells in the precipitate for 20 h before washing the cells in phosphate-buffered saline and returning them to fresh Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. G418 was added 24 h after the CaPO4 precipitate was removed. G418-resistant clones were isolated and expanded into cultures. Promoter activity was determined by measuring the level of the HGH gene product in the media of transfected cells in culture. The assay was conducted on aliquots of medium using an immunoradiomimetric assay kit supplied by the North East Thames Radioimmune Assay Co. This assay utilizes a sheep polyclonal anti-HGH solid-phase antibody and a 125I-labeled murine monoclonal anti-HGH tracer antibody. All assays were kindly performed by Gillian Campling at Littlemore Hospital, Oxford, UK. The human topoisomerase IIα probe was prepared as described previously (13Jenkins J.R. Ayton P. Jones T. Davies S.L. Simmons D.L. Harris A.L. Sheer D. Hickson I.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 5587-5592Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar) and generated a 215-bp protected fragment. The HGH and α1-globin probes were a gift from Dr. J. Firth, Oxford, UK. The HGH probe was prepared as described by Pugh et al. (30Pugh C.W. Ebert B.L. Ebrahim O. Ratcliffe P.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1217: 297-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) and generated a 117-bp protected fragment. The α1-globin probe was constructed by Charnay et al. (33Charnay P. Treisman R. Mellon P. Chao M. Axel R. Maniatis T. Cell. 1984; 38: 251-263Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) and generated a 133-bp fragment. The mouse topoisomerase IIα probe was constructed by PCR amplification from a mouse pREP3x cDNA library (kindly provided by Drs. B. Edgar and C. Norbury, Oxford, UK). The region between nucleotides 3378 and 3586 was amplified with the following primers: mouse cDNA 3378, −5′-CACCAGTGACTCTGCAGC; and mouse cDNA 3586, −5′-CTCGACAACCTCCAGTTC. The PCR product was purified using a Geneclean kit (BIO 101, Inc.) and directly cloned into the pGEM-T plasmid (Promega). Antisense transcripts were generated from the construct using SP6 polymerase after linearization with NcoI. This generated a 208-bp protected fragment. RNase protection analyses were performed on 20-50 µg of total RNA, which had been extracted from cells using the RNeasy kit (QIAGEN Inc.). The RNA was analyzed on 1% agarose gels for purity and quantified by spectrophotometry at 260 nm. Total RNA was hybridized with antisense probes for HGH and for human or mouse topoisomerase IIα. In addition, 1 µg of total RNA from K562 cells (which strongly overexpress α1-globin) was spiked into reactions as an exogenous control and detected with the α1-globin antisense probe, as described by Firth and Ratcliffe (34Firth J.D.

An exogenous control of a fixed amount of RNA was felt to be preferable when expression of genes was to be studied under differing conditions of cell growth. The RNase protection assay procedure was otherwise performed as described previously (13Jenkins J.R. Ayton P. Jones T. Davies S.L. Simmons D.L. Harris A.L. Sheer D. Hickson I.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 5587-5592Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). The following oligonucleotides containing the underlined binding motifs were used in the EMSAs that represent putative transcription factor binding sites: ICB2, wild-type sense, GGCAAGCTACGTTCTTCTGGACG; ICB2, wild-type antisense, CGTCCAGAAGAACGTAGCTTGCC; ICB2, mutant (ICB-M) sense, GGCAAGCTACGTTCTTCTGGACG; and ICB2, mutant (ICB-M) antisense, CGTCCAGAAGAACGTAGCTTGCC. These oligonucleotides were purified by electrophoresis on a 20% polyacrylamide gel. 5′-End labeling of the oligonucleotides was performed using phage T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol). Labeled oligonucleotides were purified through a Sephadex G-50 column and then annealed to a 4-fold molar excess of the unlabeled complementary strand. Unlabeled oligonucleotides used as competitors were annealed in molar equivalent quantities. EMSA reactions were performed essentially as described by Firth et al. (35Firth J.D. Ebert B.L. Pugh C.W. Ratcliffe P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6496-6500Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). Briefly, reaction mixtures (20 µl) contained 50 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM EDTA, 5 mM dithiothreitol, 5% (v/v) glycerol, and 1 µg of poly(dI-dC). This mixture was incubated with nuclear extract (5 µg) for 5 min at 20°C before radiolabeled oligonucleotide (approximately 0.1 ng) and specific competitor DNA were added. Incubation was continued for an additional 10 min at 20°C before the samples were electrophoresed on a 5% polyacrylamide gel in 0.5 × TBE (50 mM Tris, 50 mM boric acid, 0.1 mM EDTA, pH 7.9) at 4°C. In order to study the activity of the human topoisomerase IIα gene promoter in different cell lines, we sought a reliable reporter system that permitted quantification of both the mRNA and protein products of the reporter gene. We have previously described fusions of the topoisomerase IIα gene promoter with the bacterial chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene (26Hochhauser D. Stanway C.A. Harris A.L. Hickson I.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18961-18965Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, while analysis of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase protein is straightforward, the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase mRNA is generally of very low abundance due to its short half-life. Moreover, since chloramphenicol acetyltransferase is an intracellular protein, quantification of its activity requires that the experiment be terminated and the cells lysed. In contrast, HGH mRNA is readily detectable using the RNase protection assay (30Pugh C.W. Ebert B.L. Ebrahim O. Ratcliffe P.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1217: 297-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), and the HGH protein is secreted into the culture medium permitting regular sampling of the medium over time from the same cell population for quantification of protein levels via an immunoassay. For these reasons, a series of plasmids was constructed in which various regions of the topoisomerase IIα promoter were cloned upstream of a promoterless growth hormone protein coding region in pHGH (32Graham F.L. van der Eb A.J. Virology. 1973; 54: 536-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). These constructs were then used to study promoter activity in cells that were either proliferating or arrested by growth to confluence. Fig. 1a shows the sequence of the region of the topoisomerase IIα promoter previously demonstrated to exhibit maximal promoter activity in transient transfection experiments (26Hochhauser D. Stanway C.A. Harris A.L. Hickson I.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18961-18965Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Within the promoter sequence are a number of DNA elements that closely match the consensus for transcription factor binding sites, including two GC boxes (potential Sp1 factor binding sites), five ICBs, and a potential ATF binding site (as indicated in Fig. 1). To assess the relevance of these putative cis-acting elements, a series of promoter deletion constructs lacking one or more of these elements, as indicated schematically in Fig. 1b, was stably integrated into the host genome of either human or mouse cell lines. Initially, we tested whether the expression of the topoisomerase IIα mRNA was regulated by cellular growth state. Fig. 2, a and b, shows that the level of mRNA for the endogenous topoisomerase IIα gene was down-regulated approximately 4-fold in confluence-arrested human MCF-7 cells compared with exponentially growing cells. Fig. 2, a and b, also indicates that the HGH mRNA expressed from the full-length 1964-bp topoisomerase IIα promoter fragment was similarly down-regulated in the same population of confluence-arrested MCF-7 cells. In parallel, the level of HGH protein secreted into the medium was monitored over time as the cells grew to confluence and were held in a growth-arrested state for 48 h. Fig. 2c shows that HGH protein levels increased linearly with time during exponential cell growth, but this rise in expression virtually ceased as cells attained full confluence. The data in Fig. 2, a-c, demonstrate that expression of the HGH mRNA and protein reporters accurately reflects the expression of the endogenous topoisomerase IIα gene and suggest that a change in promoter activity is the primary determinant of the differential expression of topoisomerase IIα mRNA in proliferating and confluence-arrested cells. Although MCF-7 and other human cell lines of epithelial origin are useful for demonstrating growth state regulation of genes, 3T3 mouse fibroblasts are significantly more attractive model systems (36Pardee A.B. Science. 1989; 246: 603-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (1836) Google Scholar). This is because 3T3 cells are known to show strong contact inhibition of growth and can be held in a confluence-arrested state for many days without loss of viability. For this reason, we analyzed the growth state regulation of the endogenous topoisomerase IIα gene in Swiss 3T3 cells. Fig. 3, a-c, shows that expression of the mouse topoisomerase IIα gene was virtually ablated in confluence-arrested Swiss 3T3 cells. We conclude, therefore, that topoisomerase IIα gene expression is down-regulated in both human and mouse cell lines in response to cell cycle arrest by growth to confluence. Because of their ability to achieve such tight regulation of topoisomerase IIα gene expression by alterations in growth state, we used Swiss-3T3 cells to study the activity of various deletion or mutated constructs of the topoisomerase IIα gene promoter. For each of the analyses described below, a minimum of two cell clones was tested for each construct stably transfected into the Swiss 3T3 host cell line with experiments performed in triplicate. The expression of HGH protein was monitored in Swiss 3T3-derived cell lines stably transfected with constructs containing various different fragments of the human topoisomerase IIα promoter (see Fig. 1b). Fig. 4, a-d, shows that HGH expression from the −617-bp and −144-bp promoter fragments was switched off as cells attained a confluence-arrested state (indeed, a small decline in protein level was observed, presumably reflecting the protein half-life in medium). However, those transfectants containing the −101-bp or −56-bp fragments of the promoter showed continued expression of HGH for at least 48 h after confluence-induced arrest was attained. These data indicate that all of the essential elements for transcriptional repression in contact-inhibited cells are present within the −144-bp region of the topoisomerase IIα promoter and, furthermore, that elements essential for this regulation are located in the region between −144 and −101 bp of the promoter. The short region of the promoter between −101 and −144 bp that effects growth state regulation of promoter activity contains only one clearly discernible transcription factor binding site, an ICB (ICB2; see Fig. 1) at bp −108 to −104. This putative binding site was, therefore, destroyed by site-directed mutagenesis converting the ICB motif from ATTGG to ATTCC in the −617-bp promoter fragment. The level of expression from this mutated promoter was then quantified in stably transfected 3T3 cells under proliferating and confluence-arrested culture conditions. Fig. 5a shows that mutation of ICB2 completely abrogated the down-regulation of HGH expression normally seen in confluence-arrested cells. We considered the possibility that elements present in the −101-bp fragment, which although not necessary for negative regulation during confluence arrest, might, nevertheless, cooperate with the critical ICB2 element to achieve complete growth state regulation of the topoisomerase IIα gene promoter. In addition to ICB1, the −101-bp fragment contains a consensus GC box that is a potential binding site for the transcription factor Sp1. Fig. 5, b and c, shows that mutation of these two sites did not significantly influence the down-regulation of HGH expression that was seen as cells attained a confluence-arrested state. To confirm that ICB2 was the critical element in the 144-bp promoter fragment, we carried out ribonuclease protection assays on RNA from the transfectants expressing HGH from the mutated ICB2 promoter construct (and from the ICB1 mutant promoter as a control). Fig. 6, a-c, shows that while the level of human growth hormone mRNA expressed from the promoter fragment carrying a mutated ICB1 element was down-regulated in confluence-arrested cells, no such down-regulation was seen in cells expressing growth hormone from the mutated ICB2 promoter construct. The endogenous mouse topoisomerase IIα gene was down-regulated as normal in both of these transfected cell populations (Fig. 6, a and b). These results demonstrate that mutation of the ICB2 promoter element causes the regulation of the HGH reporter gene to be discordant with that of the endogenous topoisomerase IIα gene in the same cell population. Moreover, the ICB1 and ICB2 elements clearly are functionally distinct in their effects on confluence-induced regulation of the topoisomerase IIα promoter. To identify and characterize protein factors that could bind to the ICB2 element in the topoisomerase IIα promoter, EMSAs were performed using a radiolabeled 30-bp double-stranded oligonucleotide spanning ICB2. Nuclear extracts from Swiss 3T3 cells contained a factor that bound specifically to this oligonucleotide (Fig. 7, lane 1). This binding was eliminated by the addition of a 100-fold excess of unlabeled competitor DNA of identical sequence (Fig. 7, lane 2) but not by the addition of a similar excess of oligonucleotide containing a mutated ICB2 (ICB-M; Fig. 7, lane 3). Consistent with the ICB being the only protein recognition element in this oligonucleotide, no protein-DNA complex was obtained when the mutated ICB-M oligonucleotide alone was used in the EMSA (Fig. 7, lane 4). Antibody “supershift” analyses revealed that the ICB binding factor contained two subunits of the NF-Y protein complex (NF-YA and NF-YB; lanes 5 and 6, respectively) but not CTF/NF-1 (lane 7), a second previously identified CCAAT box binding factor. Lanes 8-14 of Fig. 7 show a set of EMSAs equivalent to those in lanes 1-7, with the exception that the extracts were prepared from confluence-arrested Swiss 3T3 cells. Although the result is qualitatively similar to that obtained with an extract from proliferating cells, the level of ICB binding activity was considerably lower (approximately 4-fold) in the extract from the arrested cells. Taken together, these results indicate that ICB2 of the topoisomerase IIα gene promoter is recognized by a protein complex that contains the NF-YA and NF-YB subunits and that this complex is present at a reduced level in confluence-arrested cells. We have shown that the activity of the human topoisomerase IIα gene promoter is strongly down-regulated in cells undergoing confluence-induced growth arrest. We have localized the region of the promoter that responds to the negative growth signals invoked by cell confluence to a short stretch within 144 bp of the major CAP site and have shown that an ICB element within this region is necessary for the observed down-regulation. Furthermore, we have identified the NF-Y transcription factor as a component of a proliferation-induced complex that can bind in vitro to the critical ICB2 element in the topoisomerase IIα gene promoter. The 144-bp fragment of the topoisomerase IIα promoter that is necessary and sufficient for responding to proliferation-specific signals contains only two proximal ICBs out of the five present in the full promoter together with a putative GC box. However, this GC box is an imperfect match to the consensus Sp1 factor binding site due to having only three guanine residues on either side of the central cytosine residue instead of the usual four. The ICB2 located at −108 to −104 clearly plays a pivotal role in the negative regulation of topoisomerase IIα mRNA expression. In contrast, ICB1 is neither necessary nor sufficient for growth state regulation. The features that distinguish the critical ICB2 from ICB1 (and indeed the other three ICBs within the promoter) were not identified in the current study, but they could include either the spacing of the CCAAT motif from other promoter elements or differences within the specific sequences flanking the different ICBs within the promoter. However, we have obtained no clear evidence that the different CCAAT boxes are recognized differentially by protein factors in cell extracts. 4R. J. Isaacs, A. L. Harris, and I. D. Hickson, unpublished data. Ng et al. (37Ng S.-W. Eder J.P. Schnipper L.E. Chan V.T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25850-25858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) have analyzed the role of ICBs in the regulation of basal expression of the Chinese hamster topoisomerase IIα gene. Their data indicate that an approximately 290-bp region of the 5′-flanking region spanning the CAP site of the gene, which is highly conserved in the human gene, contains maximal promoter activity. The three ICBs within this region (equivalent to ICB1, −2, and −3 of the human gene) were each shown to contribute to basal promoter activity, although ICB1 and −3 were relatively more important for this effect than was ICB2. It would appear, therefore, that the ICBs in the topoisomerase IIα promoter play an important role both in regulating basal gene expression and, at least in the case of ICB2, in mediating down-regulation of transcription in response to negative growth signals. We have shown that the CCAAT box-binding protein, NF-Y, is a component of a proliferation-specific complex that bound to ICB2. NF-Y is a heteromeric transcription factor comprising at least three subunits named NF-YA, NF-YB, and NF-YC (28Chodosh L.A. Baldwin A.S. Carthew R.W. Sharp P.A. Cell. 1988; 53: 11-24Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). All three of these subunits appear to be necessary for sequence-specific DNA binding activity (38Sinha S. Kim I. Sohn K. De Crombugghe B. Maity S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 328-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The NF-Y factor has been implicated in controlling the activity of numerous other promoters, including those required for the transcription of the major histocompatibility complex class II gene (39Dorn A. Bollekens J. Staub A. Benoist C. Mathis D. Cell. 1987; 50: 863-872Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar) and the thymidine kinase gene (40Chang Z.F. Liu C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17893-17898Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, NF-Y has been shown to bind to the CCAAT sequence in the promoters of several genes expressed in a tissue-specific manner (16Ronchi A. Bellorini M. Mongelli N. Mantovani R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4565-4572Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 25Myers R.M. Tilly K. Maniatis R. Science. 1986; 232: 613-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 27Raymondjean M. Cereghini S. Yaniv M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 757-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Recently, Ronchi et al. (16Ronchi A. Bellorini M. Mongelli N. Mantovani R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4565-4572Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) showed that NF-Y can induce bends of 62-82° at the site of a CCAAT box in DNA and that the degree of bending is influenced by the flanking sequence. Hence, a possible explanation for our findings is that changes in NF-Y binding to ICB2, either qualitative or quantitative, induce a critical conformational change in the promoter that in turn alters the affinity of cis-acting elements within the minimal promoter for their trans-acting factors. Our data are also consistent with the idea that ICB2 acts as a negative regulator of the topoisomerase IIα promoter in confluence-arrested cells and that this repression may be relieved in proliferating cells by the binding of NF-Y to this element. Nevertheless, it seems likely that this is only one facet of the growth state regulation of topoisomerase IIα gene expression since NF-Y was still detectable in extracts from growth-arrested cells. This regulation cannot simply be a consequence of a lack of binding of a positive regulatory factor to ICB2 since elimination of ICB2 prevents down-regulation of promoter activity in confluent cells. It remains to be determined if modification of NF-Y subunits, such as by phosphorylation, reinforces the effects brought about by alterations in NF-Y levels seen in proliferating and growth-arrested cell population. The growth of cells to confluence could, in principle, induce an arrest via many pathways, including nutrient deprivation and contact inhibition. Nutrient deprivation appeared to play only a very minor role, if at all, in negatively regulating topoisomerase IIα gene expression since actively cycling cells fed conditioned medium taken from cultures held at confluence for 48 h continued to express HGH at nearly normal rates. Moreover, medium taken from confluence-arrested cells did not show a significant change in pH compared with fresh growth medium. 5R. J. Isaacs, A. L. Harris, and I. D. Hickson, unpublished observations. Further work is required to define the signaling pathway leading to a down-regulation of the topoisomerase IIα promoter in confluent cells. It is clear from previous studies that transcription factors other than CCAAT box-binding proteins can mediate down-regulation of some genes during cell cycle arrest brought about by growth to confluence. For example, the ATF binding site in the cyclin A gene promoter plays an important role in the growth state regulation of cyclin A mRNA expression (4Yoshizumi M. Hseih C. Zhou F. Tsai J. Patterson C. Perrella M.A. Lee M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3266-3272Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). This site in the cyclin A promoter is recognized by both the ATF-1 protein and the cAMP response element-binding protein. Our data indicate that the putative ATF site at −227 bp is not necessary for confluence-induced down-regulation of the topoisomerase IIα promoter. In summary, we have shown that the activity of the topoisomerase IIα gene promoter is regulated by the growth state of human and mouse cell lines and that an ICB element plays a critical role in this regulation. The challenge now is to delineate the biochemical changes to transcription factors, such as NF-Y, that occur in confluence-arrested cells to bring about this negative regulation. We thank Dr. R. Mantovani for anti-NF-YA and NF-YB antibodies, Dr. J. Firth for pHGH, Drs. Chris Norbury and B. Edgar for the mouse cDNA library, and E. Clemson for typing the manuscript. We also thank Dr. C.

https://openalex.org/W2129205716,"Lipoprotein lipase (LPL), the major enzyme responsible for the hydrolysis of plasma triglycerides, promotes binding and catabolism of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins by various cultured cells. Recent studies demonstrate that LPL binds to three members of the low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor family, including the LDL receptor-related protein (LRP), GP330/LRP-2, and very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) receptors and induces receptor-mediated lipoprotein catabolism. We show here that LDL receptors also bind LPL and mediate LPL-dependent catabolism of large VLDL with Sf 100-400. Up-regulation of LDL receptors by lovastatin treatment of normal human foreskin fibroblasts (FSF cells) resulted in an increase in LPL-induced VLDL binding and catabolism to a level that was 10-15-fold greater than in LDL receptor-negative fibroblasts, despite similar LRP activity in both cell lines. This indicates that the contribution of LRP to LPL-dependent degradation of VLDL is small when LDL receptors are maximally up-regulated. Furthermore studies in LRP-deficient murine embryonic fibroblasts showed that the level of LPL-dependent degradation of VLDL was similar to that in normal murine embryonic fibroblasts. LPL also promoted the internalization of protein-free triglyceride emulsions; lovastatin-treatment resulted in 2-fold higher uptake in FSF cells, indicating that LPL itself could bind to LDL receptors. However, the lower induction of emulsion catabolism as compared with native VLDL suggests that LPL-induced catabolism via LDL receptors is only partially dependent on receptor binding by LPL and instead is primarily due to activation of apolipoproteins such as apoE. A fusion protein between glutathione S-transferase and the catalytically inactive carboxyl-terminal domain of LPL (GST-LPLC) also induced binding and catabolism of VLDL. However GST-LPLC was not as active as native LPL, indicating that lipolysis is required for a maximal LPL effect. Mutations of critical tryptophan residues in GST-LPLC that abolished binding to VLDL converted the protein to an inhibitor of lipoprotein binding to LDL receptors. In solid-phase assays using immobilized receptors, LDL receptors bound to LPL in a dose-dependent manner. Both LPL and GST-LPLC promoted binding of VLDL to LDL receptor-coated wells. These results indicate that LPL binds to LDL receptors and suggest that the carboxyl-terminal domain of LPL contributes to this interaction.

We show that the rat Pem genomic structure includes three 5′-untranslated (5′-UT) exons and four coding exons, three of which encode the homeodomain. Several alternatively spliced transcripts were identified, including one that skips an internal coding exon, enabling this mRNA to express a novel form of the Pem protein. Other alternatively spliced mRNAs were characterized that possess different 5′-UT regions, including a muscle-specific transcript. The different 5′-UT termini present in Pem transcripts conferred different levels of translatability in vitro. Two promoters containing multiple transcription initiation sites were identified: a distal promoter (Pd) in the first 5′-UT exon and a proximal promoter (Pp) located in the “intron” upstream of the first coding exon. The Pd was active in placenta, ovary, tumor cell lines, and to a lesser extent in skeletal muscle. In contrast, transcripts from the Pp were only detectable in testis and epididymis and were only expressed in epididymis in the presence of testosterone.

INTRODUCTIONAndrogens are of paramount importance to spermatogenesis in the testis and sperm maturation in the epididymis. Testosterone alone maintains spermatogenesis in gonadotropin-deficient animals, including hypophysectomized rats and mutant hypogonadal mice (1Santulli R. Sprando R.L. Awoniyi C.A. Ewing L.L. Zirken B.R. Endocrinology. 1990; 126: 95-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 2Sun Y. Wreford N.G. Robertson D.M. de Kretser D.M. Endocrinology. 1990; 127: 1215-1223Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 3Singh J. O'Neill C. Handelsman D.J. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 5311-5321Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Evidence suggests that testosterone drives spermatogenesis by acting on Sertoli cells and peritubular cells, both of which express androgen receptors (4Sar M. Hall S.H. Wilson E.M. French F.S. Russell L.D. Griswold M.D. The Sertoli Cell. Cache River Press, Clearwater, FL1993: 510Google Scholar, 5Norton J.N. Skinner M.K. Endocrinology. 1989; 124: 2711-2719Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Sertoli cells perform numerous functions critical for spermatogenesis by virtue of their intimate contact with differentiating germ cells within the seminiferous tubule. Androgens have been known to be critical for epididymal function since early in this century. They regulate the proliferation and differentiation of somatic cells in the epididymis and control the microenvironment of the maturing spermatozoa by regulating the synthesis of adhesion proteins in the epididymis, the secretion of proteins into the luminal fluid that are in contact with the spermatozoa, and the transport of ions and small organic molecules across the epididymal epithelium (6Robarie B. Hermo L. Knobil E. Neill J. The Physiology of Reproduction. Raven Press, New York1988: 999Google Scholar, 7Orgebin-Crist M.-C. (Bhasin S. Swevdloff R.S. Pharmacology, Biology, and Clinical Applications of Androgens. Wiley-Liss, Inc., NY1996Google Scholar). Secreted proteins under androgen control in the epididymis include steroid-metabolizing enzymes, polyamine synthesis enzymes, detoxification enzymes, oxidation reduction enzymes, hydrolases, and proteases (6Robarie B. Hermo L. Knobil E. Neill J. The Physiology of Reproduction. Raven Press, New York1988: 999Google Scholar, 7Orgebin-Crist M.-C. (Bhasin S. Swevdloff R.S.

Androl. 1995; 16: 379-383PubMed Google Scholar).The transcription factors that orchestrate androgen-dependent events in the testis and epididymis have not been identified, although the androgen receptor clearly plays a major role in such responses. Homeobox transcription factors are candidates to regulate spermatogenesis and sperm maturation, since they are known to regulate many other developmental events. The distinguishing feature of homeobox proteins is a conserved DNA-binding motif 60 amino acids in length, termed a homeodomain. The homeodomain is comprised of three α-helices; sequence specificity is conferred by key residues in the third helix that direct binding to base contacts in the major groove of DNA. The best understood homeobox proteins are those encoded by the hox/hom, prd/pax, and POU gene families (9Duboule D. Guidebook to the Homeobox Genes. Oxford University Press, Oxford1994Google Scholar). Studies in Drosophila melanogaster, Xenopus laevis, and mice have shown that members of these classical homeobox gene families are required for discrete events during development. For example, studies in null mutant mice have demonstrated that the Pax-6 gene activates a regulatory cascade necessary for eye development (10Gruss P. Walther C. Cell. 1992; 69: 719-722Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar), the Oct-2 POU homeobox gene promotes late stages of B-cell maturation (11Corcoran L.M. Karvelas M. Nossal G.J.V. Ye Z.-S. Jacks T. Baltimore D. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 570-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar), and Hox genes specify axial identity during embryogenesis (12Krumlauf R. Cell. 1994; 78: 191-201Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1730) Google Scholar).Homeobox transcription factor genes have been shown to be expressed in the male reproductive system, but none have been shown to be androgen-regulated. Many of these homeobox genes are expressed in germ cells of the testis. For example, the POU homeobox gene sperm-1 is expressed transiently prior to meiosis in germ cells (13Andersen B. Pearse II, R.V. Schlegel P.N. Cichon Z. Schonemann M.D. Bardin C.W. Rosenfeld M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11084-11088Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), and Hoxa-4 is expressed specifically in postmeiotic germ cells (14Wolgemuth D.J. Viviano C.M. Watrin F. Ann. N. Y. Acad.

Hoxb-4 is expressed by both germ cells and somatic cells in the testis, while Hoxd-4 is expressed by Leydig cells (15Watrin F. Wolgemuth D.J. Dev. Biol. 1993; 156: 136-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Both Hoxb-4 and Hoxd-4 are expressed by other adult organs besides testis (16Featherstone M.S. Baron A. Gaunt S. Mattei M.G.

To our knowledge the only transcription factor genes identified as expressed in the epididymis are the homeobox gene Pax-2 (18Fickenscher H.R. Chalepakis G. Gruss P. DNA Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 381-391Crossref Scopus (54) Google Scholar) and the ETS-like transcription factor PEA3 (19Xin J.-H. Cowie A. Lachance P. Hassell J.A. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 481-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar).In a search for developmentally regulated genes, we used the subtraction hybridization technique to isolate several cDNAs corresponding to novel genes (20MacLeod C.L. Fong A.M. Seal B.S. Walls L. Wilkinson M.F. Cell Growth & Differ. 1990; 1: 271-279PubMed Google Scholar), including the homeobox gene, Pem (21Wilkinson M.F. Kleeman J. Richards J. MacLeod C.L. Dev.

Dev. 1991; 34: 155-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The Pem homeodomain shares modest sequence identity with prd/pax homeodomains (22Sasaki A.W. Doskow J. MacLeod C.L. Rogers M.B. Gudas L.J. Wilkinson M.F. Mech. Dev. 1991; 34: 155-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 23Rayle R.E. Dev. Biol. 1991; 146: 255-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), but its primary amino acid sequence is sufficiently unique to warrant classification in a different subfamily. The Pem gene is expressed in a unique pattern during embryogenesis. Tissues that contribute to the extraembryonic compartment express mouse Pem; the gene remains highly expressed in the placenta and yolk sac until term (21Wilkinson M.F. Kleeman J. Richards J. MacLeod C.L. Dev. Biol. 1990; 141: 451-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 24Lin T.-P. Labosky P.A. Grabel L.B. Kozak C.A. Pitman J.L. Kleeman J. MacLeod C.L. Dev. Biol. 1994; 166: 170-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The in vivo expression pattern of Pem in endodermal tissue is mimicked in pluripotent stem cell lines that differentiate in vitro; F9 embryonal carcinoma stem cells induced to differentiate into either the visceral or endodermal lineage up-regulate Pem mRNA expression (22Sasaki A.W. Doskow J. MacLeod C.L. Rogers M.B. Gudas L.J. Wilkinson M.F. Mech. Dev. 1991; 34: 155-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) and accumulate Pem protein specifically in the outer layer of cells that possess characteristics of extraembryonic endoderm (24Lin T.-P.

Biol. 1993; 159: 232-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Pem gene expression is also dramatically up-regulated in normal diploid embryonic stem cells induced to differentiate in vitro (22Sasaki A.W. Doskow J. MacLeod C.L. Rogers M.B. Gudas L.J. Wilkinson M.F. Mech. Dev. 1991; 34: 155-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), although it is not known which specific differentiated cell types activate Pem gene expression.In this communication, we report that Pem gene expression is not restricted to embryogenesis. We show that in prepubertal and adult rats, the Pem gene is specifically transcribed in both male and female reproductive tissue and to a lesser extent in skeletal muscle. Transcript analyses revealed that Pem transcripts are derived from two promoters and undergo complex alternative splicing events that are regulated in a tissue-specific manner. The alternative splicing events alter both the 5′-UT 1The abbreviations used are: UTuntranslatedPddistal promoterPpproximal promoterPCRpolymerase chain reactionRT-PCRreverse transcriptase-PCR5′ RACE5′ rapid amplification of cDNA endsntnucleotide(s)TricineN-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycinePIPES1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acidDHTdihydrotestosterone. and coding regions of Pem mRNA. We demonstrate androgen-dependent expression of Pem transcripts from the promoter used exclusively by male reproductive tissue. The complex and androgen-dependent pattern of Pem expression by alternative promoter usage and alternative splicing has important implications for the possible role of the Pem homeobox gene in development.DISCUSSIONIn this report, we characterized the genomic structure of the Pem gene, defined two promoters used in a tissue-specific manner, and demonstrated that Pem transcripts undergo alternative RNA splicing events. We showed that an androgen-dependent promoter, Pp, is used exclusively in male reproductive tissue, while the other promoter, Pd, is expressed in female reproductive tissue and at low levels in skeletal muscle (Fig. 2). We found that several different modes of splicing regulation are exerted on Pem transcripts: 1) alternative exon inclusion; 2) alternative exon skipping; and 3) alternative splice acceptor usage (Fig. 2).We showed that mRNAs transcribed from the Pp (T-transcripts) require androgens for expression (Fig. 4), which is likely to explain why the Pp promoter is active in testis and epididymis, and is not used detectably in placenta, muscle, or ovary. The temporal pattern of T-transcript expression during development differed in testis and epididymis. In prepubertal animals, T-transcript levels were very high in epididymis but low in testis. T-transcript levels were high as early as day 23 post partum in epididymis, while in testis T-transcripts remained barely detectable until day 44 and only reached levels similar to that of Pd-derived transcripts at later developmental times (Fig. 5). The explanation for why T-transcripts are regulated differently in testis and epididymis is not known. Since we showed that T-transcript expression in epididymis requires testosterone, it is likely that the early postnatal expression of this transcript in epididymis is due to the known presence of androgens in the lumen of the epididymis at this developmental time point (37Tindall D.J. Vitale R. Means A.R. Endocrinology. 1975; 97: 636-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 38Charest N.J. Petrusz P. Ordronneau P. Joseph D.R. Wilson E.M. French F.S. Endocrinology. 1989; 125: 942-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Less clear is why T-transcript levels are so low in testis. Expression of T-transcripts in the testis in vivo requires testosterone, based on experiments in EDS-treated rats, 2S. Maiti, M. Griswold, and M. F. Wilkinson, unpublished observations. but the available androgens in the testis may be insufficient to trigger strong expression. Androgen-binding protein, which is secreted by Sertoli cells and considered to act as an “androgen sink” in the testis and as an androgen-carrier protein to the epididymis, is known to be expressed at very high levels in rats (50-100-fold higher than in mice; 39Wang Y.-M. Sullivan P.M. Petrusz P. Yarbrough W. Joseph D.R. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1989; 63: 85-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) and thus may depress Pp transcription in rat testis. The specific androgens that are present in the testis at different developmental time points may also influence Pem expression. For example, the decline in the intratesticular levels of 5α-reductase after day 40 (40Preslock J.P. Endocrinol. Rev. 1980; 1: 132-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) would cause a switch in the ratio of dihydrotestosterone to testosterone and thus may influence transcription from the Pp.The Pem gene is unusual in that it contains two promoter regions and three 5′-UT exons upstream of the coding region. As a result of alternative promoter usage and alternative splicing of these 5′-UT exons, Pem transcripts possess at least five different 5′ termini (the number of variants is even greater if one considers the multiple transcriptional initiation sites within both the Pp and the Pd). Since the use of some of these different 5′-UT sequences is regulated in a tissue- or androgen-dependent manner, it is tempting to speculate that they function in a regulatory capacity. We tested the effect of different Pem 5′-UT termini on translatability in vitro (Fig. 9) and found that Pem transcripts from the Pp (T-transcripts) were translated less efficiently than transcripts from the Pd (A-transcripts). Perhaps the male reproductive cell types that express Pp-derived transcripts down-regulate the level of Pem protein that is translated because deleterious effects would be caused by Pem protein overexpression. In skeletal muscle, a unique 5′-UT exon (the M exon) is included in Pem transcripts that is excluded in all other tissues (Fig. 7). We found that inclusion of the M exon depressed translation somewhat (Fig. 9), but since the effect was not dramatic, the M exon may regulate events other than translation. For example, it is known that 5′-UT sequences can regulate mRNA stability (45Peltz S.W. Brewer G. Bernstein P. Hart P.A. Ross J. Crit. Rev. Eukaryotic Gene Expr. 1991; 1: 99-126PubMed Google Scholar). It will be of interest to determine if the M exon plays a role in the dramatic induction of Pem transcripts in 10T1/2 mesenchymal stem cells when they commit to the muscle cell lineage (22Sasaki A.W. Doskow J. MacLeod C.L. Rogers M.B. Gudas L.J. Wilkinson M.F. Mech. Dev. 1991; 34: 155-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Secondary structure analysis by computer suggested that the different 5′ termini present in A-, M-, and T-transcripts possess different secondary structures that may be responsible for the different rates of translation. 3J. Doskow and M. F. Wilkinson, unpublished observations. Tissue-specific factors may be present in vivo that differentially bind to these secondary structure regions and thereby regulate the translation rate of Pem mRNAs that possess these different 5′ termini. Although many studies have demonstrated that translation is highly regulated in germ cells (46Schäfer M. Nayernia K. Engel W. Schäfer U. Dev. Biol. 1995; 172: 344-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 47Hecht N.B. Dev. Genet. 1995; 16: 95-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), little is known about translational regulation in somatic cells of the testis and epididymis, where Pem transcripts are expressed. 4J. S. Lindsey and M. F. Wilkinson, submitted for publication. We identified an alternatively spliced transcript (ΔE4) that encodes a novel form of the Pem protein (Pem-E). Many transcription factors, including homeobox transcription factors, are known to be expressed as multiple isoforms as a result of tissue-specific alternative RNA splicing (41López A.J. Dev. Biol. 1995; 172: 396-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Pem-E shares the amino terminus with the classical Pem protein but lacks the homeodomain and thus may not bind DNA. Since the amino-terminal region of Pem is, by far, the most conserved region of this protein based on comparison of the primary amino acid sequence of mouse and rat Pem (35Maiti S. Doskow J. Sutton K. Nhim R.P. Lawlor D.A. Levan K. Lindsey J.S. Wilkinson M.F. Genomics. 1996; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar), this region may possess functional attributes. For example, the amino-terminal region may serve as a binding interface that permits Pem and Pem-E to bind other proteins. Many homeobox proteins have been shown to use amino acids outside of the homeodomain to interact with other transcription factors, including other homeobox proteins (9Duboule D. Guidebook to the Homeobox Genes. Oxford University Press, Oxford1994Google Scholar, 42Vershon A.K. Jin Y. Johnson A.D. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 182-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 43Kämper J. Reichmann M. Romeis T. Bölker M. Kahmann R. Cell. 1995; 81: 73-83Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). The importance of regions outside of the homeodomain for biological function is underscored by a recent study showing that a mutant Ftz protein completely lacking the homeodomain correctly regulates downstream target genes in vivo, probably because it is still able to bind to other transcription factors (44Copeland J.W.R. Nasiadka A. Dietrich B.H. Krause H.M. Nature. 1996; 379: 162-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Pem-E may act as an inhibitor protein that competes with classical Pem for interaction with another transcription factor, but by virtue of its inability to bind to DNA, it would exert a dominant negative effect. By analogy, the Id inhibitor protein possesses a helix-loop-helix motif and thus can dimerize with other helix-loop-helix proteins, such as myoD, but because Id lacks a DNA-binding domain it prevents these interacting helix-loop-helix proteins from activating the transcription of downstream target genes (41López A.J. Dev. Biol. 1995; 172: 396-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar).Most known examples of alternative transcriptional and posttranscriptional events in male reproductive tissue are known to occur in the germ cells (47Hecht N.B. Dev. Genet. 1995; 16: 95-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). For example, the c-mos, c-abl, pim-1, cytochrome c, cyclin D3, superoxide dismutase, hoxa-4, proopiomelanocortin, and SRY genes use alternative promoters in germ cells of the testis that differ from the promoters used in somatic cells (48Sorrentino V.

Rosenberg M.P. Vande Woude G.F. Trends Genet. 1988; 4: 183-187Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). One hypothesis to explain the common usage of alternative promoters in germ cells is that it results from the changes in the chromatin structure needed to produce spermatozoa. This restructuring would not occur in somatic cells of the testis and epididymis, and thus transcriptional regulation unique to these tissues is not necessarily expected. The Pem gene is expressed by somatic cells of the testis and epididymis,4 and thus it will be of interest to determine how and why it is regulated in such a complex manner at both the transcriptional and post-transcriptional level.Since the Pem gene encodes a homeodomain-containing protein, it is reasonable to suppose that the Pem protein is a transcription factor that regulates specific events during male gametogenesis. The finding that the Pem gene depends on androgen for expression in the epididymis suggests that, in turn, Pem may regulate androgen-dependent events in the epididymis. To our knowledge no transcription factors have previously been shown to be androgen-regulated in the epididymis. The homeobox transcription factor, Pax-2, is clearly regulated by a distinct mechanism, since it is expressed in the epididymis of tfm mice, which lack androgen receptors (18Fickenscher H.R. Chalepakis G. Gruss P. DNA Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 381-391Crossref Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Several candidate downstream genes are known to require androgens for expression in the epididymis (directly or indirectly) and thus may be regulated by Pem, including those encoding 5α-reductase, carboxypeptidase metalloprotein D/E (AEG, CRISP-1), the retinol binding protein B/C (ESPI), the glutathione peroxidase-like protein GPX, the glutamyltranspeptidase GGT, nerve growth factor, and E-cadherin (7Orgebin-Crist M.-C. (Bhasin S. Swevdloff R.S. Pharmacology, Biology, and Clinical Applications of Androgens. Wiley-Liss, Inc., NY1996Google Scholar, 8Cornwall G. Hann S.R. J. Androl. 1995; 16: 379-383PubMed Google Scholar). The epididymis has multiple functions, many of which depend on the presence of androgens and thus may be regulated by Pem: (i) induction of spermatozoa motility capability, (ii) spermatozoa membrane alterations that permit fertilization competence, (iii) changes in the methylation status of spermatozoa genes, and (iv) spermatozoa storage (6Robarie B. Hermo L. Knobil E. Neill J. The Physiology of Reproduction. Raven Press, New York1988: 999Google Scholar, 7Orgebin-Crist M.-C. (Bhasin S. Swevdloff R.S.

McCarrey J. Nat. Genet. 1994; 7: 59-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Since the Pem gene is specifically expressed in the distal corpus/proximal cauda portion of the epididymis,4 the site where spermatozoa gain motility capability and membrane alterations necessary for fertilization competence (57Blaquier J.A.

Reprod. Fertil. 1986; 78: 327-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), it will be of interest to determine whether Pem regulates these final maturation events. INTRODUCTIONAndrogens are of paramount importance to spermatogenesis in the testis and sperm maturation in the epididymis. Testosterone alone maintains spermatogenesis in gonadotropin-deficient animals, including hypophysectomized rats and mutant hypogonadal mice (1Santulli R. Sprando R.L. Awoniyi C.A. Ewing L.L. Zirken B.R. Endocrinology. 1990; 126: 95-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 2Sun Y. Wreford N.G. Robertson D.M. de Kretser D.M. Endocrinology. 1990; 127: 1215-1223Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 3Singh J. O'Neill C. Handelsman D.J. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 5311-5321Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Evidence suggests that testosterone drives spermatogenesis by acting on Sertoli cells and peritubular cells, both of which express androgen receptors (4Sar M. Hall S.H. Wilson E.M. French F.S. Russell L.D. Griswold M.D. The Sertoli Cell. Cache River Press, Clearwater, FL1993: 510Google Scholar, 5Norton J.N. Skinner M.K. Endocrinology. 1989; 124: 2711-2719Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Sertoli cells perform numerous functions critical for spermatogenesis by virtue of their intimate contact with differentiating germ cells within the seminiferous tubule. Androgens have been known to be critical for epididymal function since early in this century. They regulate the proliferation and differentiation of somatic cells in the epididymis and control the microenvironment of the maturing spermatozoa by regulating the synthesis of adhesion proteins in the epididymis, the secretion of proteins into the luminal fluid that are in contact with the spermatozoa, and the transport of ions and small organic molecules across the epididymal epithelium (6Robarie B. Hermo L. Knobil E. Neill J. The Physiology of Reproduction. Raven Press, New York1988: 999Google Scholar, 7Orgebin-Crist M.-C. (Bhasin S. Swevdloff R.S. Pharmacology, Biology, and Clinical Applications of Androgens. Wiley-Liss, Inc., NY1996Google Scholar). Secreted proteins under androgen control in the epididymis include steroid-metabolizing enzymes, polyamine synthesis enzymes, detoxification enzymes, oxidation reduction enzymes, hydrolases, and proteases (6Robarie B. Hermo L. Knobil E. Neill J. The Physiology of Reproduction. Raven Press, New York1988: 999Google Scholar, 7Orgebin-Crist M.-C. (Bhasin S. Swevdloff R.S.

Androl. 1995; 16: 379-383PubMed Google Scholar).The transcription factors that orchestrate androgen-dependent events in the testis and epididymis have not been identified, although the androgen receptor clearly plays a major role in such responses. Homeobox transcription factors are candidates to regulate spermatogenesis and sperm maturation, since they are known to regulate many other developmental events. The distinguishing feature of homeobox proteins is a conserved DNA-binding motif 60 amino acids in length, termed a homeodomain. The homeodomain is comprised of three α-helices; sequence specificity is conferred by key residues in the third helix that direct binding to base contacts in the major groove of DNA. The best understood homeobox proteins are those encoded by the hox/hom, prd/pax, and POU gene families (9Duboule D. Guidebook to the Homeobox Genes. Oxford University Press, Oxford1994Google Scholar). Studies in Drosophila melanogaster, Xenopus laevis, and mice have shown that members of these classical homeobox gene families are required for discrete events during development. For example, studies in null mutant mice have demonstrated that the Pax-6 gene activates a regulatory cascade necessary for eye development (10Gruss P. Walther C.

Notably, SRF has been found to be a key regulator of members of a class of cellular response genes termed immediate-early genes (IEGs), many of which are believed to be involved in regulating cell growth and differentiation. The mechanism by which SRF activates transcription of IEGs in response to mitogenic agents has been extensively studied. Significantly less is known about how expression of the SRF gene itself is mediated. We and others have previously shown that the SRF gene is itself transiently induced by a variety of mitogenic agents and belongs to a class of “delayed” early response genes. We have cloned the SRF promoter and in the present study have analyzed the upstream regulatory sequences involved in mediating serum responsiveness of the SRF gene. Our analysis indicates that inducible SRF expression requires both SRF binding sites located within the first 63 nucleotides upstream from the start site of transcriptional initiation and an Sp1 site located 83 nucleotides upstream from the start site. Maximal transcriptional activity of the promoter also requires two CCAATT box sites located 90 and 123 nucleotides upstream of the start site.

SRF was first identified as a critical factor involved in mediating serum and growth factor-induced transcriptional activation of the c-fos proto-oncogene (reviewed in 1Treisman R. Ammerer G. Curr. Opin. Genet. & Dev. 1992; 2: 221-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The importance of SRF for growth factor-regulated transcription is suggested by the identification of SRF binding sites (serum response elements) within the regulatory region of many other transiently expressed serum-inducible genes.

In addition to its role in mediating activation of genes expressed at early times after stimulation, some studies also suggest that SRF is involved in regulating later events, such as differentiation and cell cycle progression, presumably by regulating expression of key late response genes. Microinjection of anti-SRF antibodies blocks progression of stimulated fibroblasts from G1 to S phase (24Gauthier-Rouviere C. Cavadore J.-C. Blanchard J.-M. Lamb N.J.C. Fernandez A. Cell Regul. 1991; 2: 575-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), suggesting that SRF or an SRF-related factor is important for controlling cell cycle progression. This function of SRF may be conserved through evolution, since genetic analysis has revealed that the yeast SRF homolog, MCM1, is involved in cell cycle progression (25Elble R. Tye B.-K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 971-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The observation that in yeast, MCM1 binding sites are found in the promoters of the cyclin genes cln3 and clnb2, and the gene for a cyclin interacting factor FAR1 (26Kuo M.-H. Grayhack E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 348-359Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), raises the possibility that SRF or a SRF-related factor may perform a similar function in mammalian cells. Other microinjection studies suggest that SRF is also important for differentiation in two myoblast lines, mouse C2 and rat L6. These studies show that SRF antibodies lead to down-regulation of myogenin expression and block differentiation of myoblasts cells to myotubes (27Vandromme M. Gauthier-Rouviere C. Gilles C. Lamb N. Fernandez A. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 1489-1500Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), suggesting that SRF or SRF-related factors directly or indirectly regulate muscle-specific transcription factors important for conferring the myogenic phenotype. Additional support for SRF playing a role in development of the myogenic phenotype comes from numerous studies that have identified SRF binding sites in the promoters of a number of muscle-specific genes. These include the cardiac and skeletal muscle actin (28Muscat G.E. Gustafson T.A. Kedes L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 4120-4133Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 29Phan-Dinh-Tuy F.

Biol. 1993; 13: 2753-2764Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). In the case of the skeletal and cardiac actin and the dystrophin genes, SRF binding sites have been found to act as positive tissue-specific promoter elements. While the role of SRF in tissue-specific gene expression is unclear, it has been suggested that SRF may interact with other transcription factors to confer tissue-specific expression. One model for how SRF can mediate disparate phenotypic consequences suggests that SRF interacts with different classes of cell type-specific accessory proteins to confer distinct phenotypic responses (35Grueneberg D.A. Natesan S. Alexandre C. Gilman M.Z. Science. 1992; 257: 1089-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Consistent with this hypothesis, SRF has been shown to interact with different classes of factors including the homeodomain protein Phox-1 (35Grueneberg D.A. Natesan S. Alexandre C. Gilman M.Z. Science. 1992; 257: 1089-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar) and a class of transcriptional activator proteins known as ternary complex factors (TCFs) that are members of the Elk-1 subfamily of the ETS family of oncoproteins (reviewed in 36Treisman R. Curr. Opin. Genet. & Dev. 1994; 4: 96-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar). It has also recently been reported that SRF and SRF-related proteins can interact through their conserved DNA binding/dimerization domain with myogenic basic helix-loop-helix proteins (37Molkentin J.D. Black B.L. Martin J.F. Olson E.N. Cell. 1995; 83: 1125-1136Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar, 38Groisman R. Masutani H. Leibovitch M.-P. Robin P. Soudant I. Trouche D. Harel-Bellan A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5258-5264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). In the case of SRF-mediated activation of IEGs, extensive studies of c-fos gene expression in fibroblasts indicate that in response to serum stimulation, SRF mediates gene activation by at least two distinct mechanisms (39Hill C.S. Wynne J. Treisman R. Cell. 1995; 81: 1159-1170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1207) Google Scholar). In one case, activation of the p21ras signaling pathway leads to modification and subsequent activation of the TCF family of SRF-associated factors, thereby activating transcription. In a second, less well characterized SRF-dependent pathway, stimulation of cells can activate expression by a pathway that is dependent on members of the Rho subfamily of Ras proteins. This second pathway occurs in a TCF-independent manner. In both the TCF-dependent and -independent pathways, activation can occur in the absence of new protein synthesis and therefore relies on preexisting SRF protein. While much is known about how SRF activates expression of IEGs such as c-fos, little is known about how SRF regulates genes involved in later responses. One possibility is that newly expressed SRF protein may be involved. To begin to address how SRF may be involved in regulating late responses, we have studied expression of the SRF gene and protein. In previous studies (40Misra R.P. Rivera V.M. Wang J.M. Fan P.-D. Greenberg M.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4545-4554Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) we and others (41Norman C. Runswick M. Pollock R. Treisman R. Cell. 1988; 55: 989-1003Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar) found that the SRF gene is itself an IEG since its transcription can be induced in the absence of new protein synthesis. In response to serum and purified growth factors, peak expression of SRF mRNA occurs at 90-120 min after stimulation. The expression of SRF protein closely follows RNA expression. Unlike many IEG protein products SRF protein is relatively stable, having an in vivo half-life of 12-16 h (40Misra R.P. Rivera V.M. Wang J.M. Fan P.-D. Greenberg M.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4545-4554Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The stability of the SRF protein accounts for the apparent paradox that SRF protein is present prior to induction of the gene. In addition, the newly synthesized protein is extensively post-translationally modified by phosphorylation throughout the course of the cell cycle, raising the possibility that these modifications may be involved in regulating SRF's ability to control expression of late acting genes (40Misra R.P. Rivera V.M. Wang J.M. Fan P.-D. Greenberg M.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4545-4554Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The time of appearance of peak SRF mRNA levels suggests that the SRF gene belongs to a class of IEGs whose expression is delayed relative to other well characterized early IEGs such as the c-fos gene, whose peak expression occurs much earlier at 30 min after stimulation (42Greenberg M.E. Ziff E.B. Nature. 1984; 311: 433-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (2009) Google Scholar). Since delayed IEGs can be induced in the absence of new protein synthesis, their expression is not dependent on activation of early IEGs. Paradoxically, the SRF gene is inducible by many of the same agents that activate early IEGs. This suggests that temporal control of SRF expression occurs at a level downstream of the signaling pathways, such as at the level of transcriptional initiation or message stability. We have cloned the murine SRF promoter and in the present study have begun to address these issues by investigating the promoter regulatory sequences involved in mediating activation of the SRF gene. We have found that maximal serum responsiveness of the SRF promoter is dependent on two different types of cis-acting regulatory elements located within the first 300 nucleotides upstream of the start site of transcription. Our mutational analysis indicates that serum responsiveness of the SRF gene is autoregulated since SRF protein binding to its own promoter is necessary for serum inducibility but that binding of additional upstream factors to the SRF promoter is also required for maximal responsiveness. Initially, a λ FIXII library (obtained from Stratagene) containing genomic DNA from mouse strain 129/SVJ was screened using a radioactively labeled probe consisting of DNA corresponding to the N-terminal portion of human SRF protein. λ clones that contained SRF-related sequences were digested with SacI restriction endonuclease, electrophoresed in a 0.75% agarose gel, and transferred by capillary action to HyBond membrane (Amersham Corp.) overnight. Air-dried filters were then wrapped in Saran wrap and UV-irradiated with a total dose of 1.2 joules/cm2 using a Fisher Scientific FB-UVXL-1000 UV cross-linker. Fragments containing the SRF promoter were identified using a radiolabeled probe consisting of a 305-base pair HindIII/DdeI restriction fragment isolated from the human SRF cDNA clone pT7ΔATG (41Norman C. Runswick M. Pollock R. Treisman R. Cell. 1988; 55: 989-1003Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar). Labeling was performed as described by Feinberg and Vogelstein (43Feinberg A.P. Vogelstein B. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 132: 6-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (16651) Google Scholar). Hybridization was performed overnight at 65°C in a Hybaid rotary oven under conditions described by Church and Gilbert (44Church G.M. Gilbert W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 1991-1995Crossref PubMed Scopus (7266) Google Scholar). Restriction fragments that contained SRF N-terminal sequences were cloned into the SacI restriction site of pBluescript (Stratagene). Double-stranded sequencing was performed by the method of Sanger et al. (45Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52769) Google Scholar). The Genetics Computer Group Bestfit software was utilized to identify homology with the human SRF cDNA. SRF-luciferase reporter vectors were constructed by cloning various portions of the SRF promoter into the pGL2 Basic luciferase vector (Promega). Initially, a BglII-HindIII fragment (−2500 to +679) was cloned into the BglII and HindIII restriction sites of pGL2 Basic. The construct was then digested with HindIII (+679) and NotI (+229), and the DNA ends were blunted with Klenow fragment and then religated. Promoter deletion constructs were constructed by using restriction endonuclease cleavage sites present in the SRF promoter. NIH3T3 cells were grown in 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 10% heat-inactivated calf serum, 0.01% penicillin, and 0.01% streptomycin. All transfections were performed with the calcium phosphate co-precipitation technique as described (46Rivera V.M. Sheng M. Greenberg M.E. Genes & Dev. 1990; 4: 255-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) using supercoiled DNA purified by cesium chloride density ultracentrifugation. Eighteen hours before transfection, cells were seeded at a density of 5 × 105 cells/60-mm dish. Transfection mixtures contained 3.5 µg of SRF-reporter and 1 µg of Rous sarcoma virus-β-galactosidase as a transfection efficiency control. In all cases, the DNA concentration was adjusted to 7.5 µg with pUC19 DNA. Cells were incubated 12-16 h with the DNA/calcium phosphate precipitate, washed two times with phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4), and made quiescent by the addition of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 0.5% calf serum, 0.01% penicillin, and 0.01% streptomycin for 48 h. Serum stimulation was achieved by replacing the starvation media with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 20% fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.). Preliminary studies showed that maximum inducible luciferase activity was achieved 2 h after stimulation. Cells were harvested in reporter lysis buffer (Promega), frozen on dry ice, thawed, vortexed for 15 s, and centrifuged for 20 s in a microfuge at 10000 × g. The supernatant was used for analysis. Luciferase assays and β-galactosidase assays were performed as described by Promega. Luciferase activity was measured on a Berthold AutoLumat LB953 luminometer. In all cases, assays were performed in triplicate and experiments were repeated at least three times. Radioactively labeled probes for use in gel mobility shift assays were prepared by polymerase chain reaction using an SRF promoter fragment (−165 to +14) as a template and 32P end-labeled oligonucleotide primers. The products were gel-purified. To ensure that the probes were of equivalent specific activity the same set of primers was used to generate each probe. Primer sequences used in polymerase chain reaction were 5′-GCAGCGAGTTCGGTATGTC-3′ and 5′-GGTATCCCCCAACCCTTCC-3′, respectively. In brief, binding conditions in a 20-µl volume were 0.2 mM dithiothreitol, 16% glycerol, 2 mM spermidine, 20 µg of bovine serum albumin, 2 µg of linear pUC19, 0.2 µg of poly(dI-dC), and 0.1-1 ng of labeled DNA probe (25,000 cpm). In vitro translated SRF was added and incubated at 4°C for 10 min before the addition of labeled probe. After probe addition, incubation was continued 15-20 min at room temperature. The total reaction was electrophoresed in a 4% polyacrylamide gel in 0.5 × Tris borate-EDTA, the gels were dried, and autoradiography was performed. Competition studies were under the same conditions, except competitor DNA was incubated in the binding reaction for 30 min on ice before the addition of the labeled probe. The addition of the probe at later times after preincubation with competitor, or incubation of the probe in the reaction mixture for longer times, gave identical results, suggesting that equilibrium was established under the conditions used. Quantitation of the competition studies was done using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager. Serum-starved and serum-stimulated NIH3T3 nuclear extracts were prepared by the method of Dignam (47Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 5: 1475-1489Crossref Scopus (9164) Google Scholar). For mobility shift reactions using nuclear extracts, 6 µg of protein was used and incubation times were doubled. Conditions for the antibody supershift experiments were identical to the shifts of nuclear extract with the exception that a 1:50 dilution of anti-SRF antibody R1122 (described in 40Misra R.P. Rivera V.M. Wang J.M. Fan P.-D. Greenberg M.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4545-4554Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) was added to the shift reactions 10 min prior to electrophoresis. Site-directed mutations were introduced in context in the SRF promoter by the technique of Deng and Nickoloff (48Deng W.P. Nickoloff J.A. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 200: 81-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar). The template for mutagenesis reactions was region −322 to +229 of the SRF gene in a pUC19 background. The specific base changes were chosen based on their ability to disrupt factor binding in vitro as documented in the following references: CArG box 1, CCATAAAAGG to CCATAAAA (this work); CArG box 2, CCATATAAGG to CCATATAA (this work); SP1/−254, GGGCGGG to GGCGG (49Zhang R.

Cogswell P. Clarke J.B. Ting J.P. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4042-4053Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Combinations of mutations were generated either by performing mutagenesis reactions on a template already containing a mutation or by subcloning DNA fragments containing the appropriate mutation. To isolate sequences corresponding to the mouse SRF gene we used a 305-base pair restriction fragment, derived from the human SRF cDNA clone pT7ΔATG (41Norman C. Runswick M. Pollock R. Treisman R. Cell. 1988; 55: 989-1003Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar), to screen a λ mouse genomic library. This probe contained sequences derived from the 5′ region of a human SRF cDNA clone. Restriction analysis of the products of this screen identified three λ clones that contained overlapping sequences (data not shown). One clone containing a 5-kb fragment of murine genomic DNA was picked for further analysis. To verify that this clone contained the gene encoding the SRF protein and not a family member, a portion was sequenced and compared with the sequence of a partial mouse SRF cDNA clone. The mouse SRF cDNA clone was previously shown to encode a functional SRF protein and to have high homology to human SRF cDNA. 2D. Pak and R. P. Misra, unpublished results. This comparison revealed the λ clone to be 100% homologous to the mouse cDNA over the region corresponding to SRF sequences coding for the first 228 amino acids (data not shown). In addition, the presence of an intron (>1 kb) between the codons for amino acids 167 and 168 was noted. To determine whether the clone we had isolated contained SRF promoter regulatory sequences, the region of the clone 5′ to the protein-coding sequence was sequenced and compared with a full-length human cDNA in which the start site of transcription had been previously mapped (51Dalton S. Treisman R. Cell. 1992; 68: 597-612Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1, there was 93% identity at the nucleotide level between the human cDNA and the mouse genomic clone over this region and 97% identity over the 100 nucleotides immediately 3′ to the start site of transcription of the human gene. Based on this analysis, the start site of transcriptional initiation in the murine clone was assigned, and the 5-kb genomic fragment was determined to contain 1 kb of SRF coding sequence and 4 kb of sequence 5′ to the start site of transcriptional initiation. To measure serum responsiveness of the SRF promoter, a 2.7-kb restriction fragment spanning −2500 to +229 relative to the start site of transcriptional initiation was then isolated from the 5-kb fragment and inserted into a luciferase reporter construct. Previously we have shown that the SRF gene is transiently induced when serum-starved NIH3T3 cells are treated with serum (40Misra R.P. Rivera V.M. Wang J.M. Fan P.-D. Greenberg M.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4545-4554Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) or purified growth factors. 3J. A. Spencer and R. P. Misra, unpublished results. In unstimulated serum-starved NIH3T3 cells SRF mRNA levels are virtually undetectable. SRF mRNA reaches a maximum by 90-120 min after stimulation of cells with 20% fetal calf serum and then returns to nearly basal levels by 6 h after stimulation. To determine the regulatory elements required for transcriptional activation of the SRF gene, progressive 5′ promoter deletion constructs containing different amounts of the SRF promoter and 229 nucleotides of the SRF 5′-untranslated region were fused to a luciferase reporter gene. These constructs, schematically depicted in Fig. 2A, were transiently transfected into NIH3T3 cells, and luciferase activity was measured after serum starvation or 2 h after serum stimulation of starved cells. To normalize for transfection efficiency, each construct was co-transfected with a constitutively expressed Rous sarcoma virus-β-galactosidase reporter. The results of one typical set of experiments are shown in Fig. 2B. Upon serum stimulation of cells containing a reporter with 2500 nucleotides of upstream sequence, there is an approximately 5-fold increase in luciferase activity relative to the unstimulated cells. Roughly the same -fold stimulation is observed for constructs in which all but 111 nucleotides of upstream sequence have been deleted. In contrast, a construct with 35 nucleotides of upstream sequence, containing only the SRF TATA element, is stimulated 1.3-fold. These results indicate that the major sequence determinants of serum responsiveness in the SRF promoter reside between 35 and 111 nucleotides upstream from the start site of transcription. Fig. 2 also shows that while the -fold stimulation of the −111 construct is similar to the −322 and −2500 constructs, there is a dramatic decrease in the absolute level of expression of the −111 construct in both stimulated and unstimulated cells. This effect is even more pronounced in the −35 minimal construct, suggesting that sequences both between −35 and −111 and between −111 and −322 are involved in regulating transcriptional efficiency of the SRF gene. The results presented in Fig. 2 indicate that sequences required for maximal serum-stimulated expression of the SRF gene are present within the first 322 nucleotides upstream of the start site of transcription. Computer analysis of the sequence of this region identified a number of potential regulatory elements that are in boldface type and underlined in Fig. 1. Most notably, two CArG box elements are located within 60 nucleotides of the start site of transcription. In addition, there are potential Sp1 binding sites at −83 and −254, an Ets binding motif at −103, and two CCAAT box elements located at −90 and −123. To begin to determine which of the potential regulatory elements located in the −35 to −322 region mediate serum responsiveness of the SRF promoter, we mutated the Sp1, CCAAT box, or CArG box elements, either alone or in various combinations and then measured luciferase activity before and after serum stimulation. Point mutations of each putative regulatory element, which abolish factor binding, were introduced into the indicated elements in the context of the wild type −322 reporter construct (Fig. 3A), and their effects on expression were tested in transient transfection assays. As seen in Fig. 3B, the most dramatic effect on serum responsiveness occurred when both"

It is composed of three subunits of 70, 34, and 13 kDa (Rpa1, Rpa2, and Rpa3, respectively). Deletion mapping of the Rpa2 subunit identified the domain required for interaction with Rpa1 and Rpa3 which does not include the N-terminal domain that is phosphorylated during S phase. Deletion mapping of Rpa1 defined three domains. The C-terminal third of the Rpa1 polypeptide binds Rpa2 which itself forms a bridge between Rpa1 and Rpa3. The N-terminal third of Rpa1 bound single-stranded DNA under low stringency conditions only (0.1 M NaCl), while a central domain binds to single-stranded DNA under both low and high stringency conditions (0.5 M NaCl). Binding to p53 requires the N-terminal third of Rpa1 with some contribution from the C-terminal third. The evolutionarily conserved putative zinc finger near the C terminus of Rpa1 was not required for binding to single-stranded DNA, Rpa2, or p53. However, all three subdomains of Rpa1 and the zinc finger were essential for supporting DNA replication in vitro.

In addition RPA associates with proteins containing acidic transcriptional activator domains such as p53, VP16, and the DNA repair protein XP-G. These interactions have been proposed to inhibit DNA binding by RPA and to recruit RPA for replication and repair (13He Z. Brinton B.T. Greenblatt J. Hassell J.A. Ingles C.J.

Ruppert J.M. Aster J.C. Winchester W. Nature. 1993; 365: 79-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar).The 70-kDa subunit (Rpa1) can bind to single-stranded DNA on its own but cannot support DNA replication. The 34-kDa subunit (Rpa2) is phosphorylated in a cell cycle-dependent manner by multiple kinases which include the cdk kinases and the DNA-dependent protein kinase (17Dutta A. Stillman B. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2189-2199Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 18Pan Z.-Q. Amin A.A. Gibbs E. Niu H. Hurwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The phosphorylation is also induced by x-irradiation of cells, and this form of phosphorylated RPA fails to support DNA replication (20Carty M.P. Zernik-Kobak M. McGrath S. Dixon K. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2114-2123Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). We have recently discovered a homolog of the middle subunit, Rpa4, which is expressed selectively in some quiescent tissues apparently uncomplexed with Rpa1 and Rpa3 (21Keshav K.F. Chen C. Dutta A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3119-3128Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In order to understand how the various subunits of RPA interact with each other, how RPA binds DNA, and how the activity of the protein may be regulated by protein-protein interactions and post-translational modifications, we have mapped the functional domains of the three subunits of RPA using cloned cDNAs coding for the human RPA subunits (22Erdile L.F.

Chem. 1995; 270: 4534-4543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) have used C-terminal deletions of Rpa1 to map regions required for binding to single-stranded DNA and to Rpa2/Rpa3. This report confirms and extends their results.Three approaches have been taken for studying the mutant forms of RPA subunits. The first uses the yeast two-hybrid/interaction trap method for studying protein-protein interactions between the subunits. The second uses proteins made by in vitro transcription and translation in co-immunoprecipitation and binding assays to analyze protein-protein or protein-nucleic acid interactions. The third uses recombinant RPA holocomplexes to confirm the findings from the earlier assays and to determine the domains of Rpa1 essential for SV40-based DNA replication. Together, these results provide a functional map of the RPA complex and suggest that, beside the binding of single-stranded DNA and the recruitment of Rpa2 and 3 to the replication apparatus, the Rpa1 subunit executes additional functions essential for DNA replication.DISCUSSIONIn order to understand how the trimeric RPA protein complex participates in DNA replication, we have determined some of the functional regions of the Rpa1 and Rpa2 proteins. The C-terminal part of Rpa1 binds to Rpa2 and the middle part binds to single-stranded DNA in a salt resistant manner (Fig. 8). Surprisingly, the N-terminal part of Rpa1 also binds to single-stranded DNA, but only at low salt concentrations. p53 uses amino acids from both the N- and C-terminal portion of Rpa1 to bind to the protein. The C-terminal two-thirds of Rpa2 forms a bridge between Rpa1 and Rpa3, although additional contacts between Rpa1 and 3 cannot be ruled out.Attempts to reconstitute the RPA holocomplex by expression of recombinant polypeptides have suggested that although Rpa1 and Rpa2 can interact to form an easily dissociable complex, Rpa2 and Rpa3 form a stable complex which will associate with Rpa1 to form the Rpa1-2-3 complex (26Henricksen L.H. Umbricht C.B. Wold M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11121-11132Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Stigger E. Dean F.B. Hurwitz J. Lee S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 579-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). We have modified the two-hybrid system to demonstrate that Rpa2 is capable of forming a bridge between Rpa1 and Rpa3. This report is the first demonstration that bridging interaction in a three subunit complex can be studied by a modification of the two-hybrid system. Deletion mapping of Rpa2, however, did not separate the parts of the protein that interact with Rpa1 or Rpa3. Finer mutagenesis may be required to achieve this goal, and since we now have a genetic system for assaying the interaction, it should be possible to mutagenize randomly the cDNA coding for the Rpa2 protein and screen for mutations that selectively affect interaction with Rpa1 or Rpa3. The N-terminal 43 amino acids of Rpa2 containing its sites of phosphorylation by cdk kinases (17Dutta A. Stillman B. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2189-2199Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar) appears to be independent from the region required to associate with Rpa1 and 3.Rpa1 was readily divisible into regions important for one function but not another. The deletions could potentially disrupt the tertiary structure of Rpa1 or produce insoluble proteins. However, since various deletion derivatives of Rpa1 carried out some functions and not others, we believe that the deletions do not result in a global denaturation of the protein. Also the bead-binding assays were confirmed by two-hybrid assays in yeast and by solution binding assays with soluble recombinant proteins to eliminate artifacts due to insoluble deletion derivatives. The regions indicated in Fig. 8 are required for binding the indicated ligands. The Rpa1-Rpa2 interaction requires the C-terminal one-third of Rpa1, a result consistent with that obtained by Gomes and Wold (25Gomes X.V. Wold M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4534-4543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). This region also appears sufficient for association with Rpa2. Although this domain assignment utilized the association of human Rpa1 with rabbit Rpa2 in the reticulocyte lysate the results are the same for the association of human Rpa1 and Rpa2 when the deletions were tested (a) in the yeast two-hybrid assay and (b) for the ability to form the RPA holocomplex when co-expressed with Rpa2 and 3 in bacteria.Approximately the middle third of Rpa1 (278-492) is important for binding of single-stranded DNA in 0.5 M NaCl, a conclusion reached from the properties of 278-616 (+), Δ222-411 (−), 1-492 (+) and 1-372 (±). Definition of the minimal regions of Rpa1 required to bind Rpa2 and single-stranded DNA is also supported by the binding properties of the smaller products obtained during in vitro transcription-translation of Rpa1 (Fig. 4A, lane 1). Assuming that these products are by initiation from internal methionines, polypeptides of 57, 36, and 29 kDa probably correspond to products initiating at methionines 97, 278, and 349. Since Rpa2 is expected to bind to the C-terminal region of these products, immunoprecipitation with anti-Rpa2 antibody should precipitate all the smaller products, consistent with what is observed (Fig. 4A, lane 3). Single-stranded DNA cellulose however, only binds to products containing 278-492, and therefore should bind only to the internally initiated products of 57 and 36 kDa but not of 29 kDa. This is in fact what is observed (Fig. 5A, lane 2). The DNA binding region of Rpa1 does not contain the zinc finger motif or residues 109-145, the reported region of sequence similarity to E. coli single-stranded DNA binding protein (ssb) (23Erdile L.F. Heyer W.-D. Kolodner R. Kelly T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12090-12098Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).DNA binding by Rpa1 at 0.15 M NaCl in a Southwestern assay showed that small N-terminal fragments of Rpa1 (e.g. 1-249, 1-326, and so forth) were capable of binding DNA (25Gomes X.V. Wold M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4534-4543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). It is likely that the DNA binding these authors observe in the Southwestern assay is the equivalent of the DNA binding we see at 0.1 M NaCl, and can be executed by a salt-sensitive DNA binding site near the N terminus of Rpa1. Gomes and Wold (25Gomes X.V. Wold M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4534-4543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) reported a significant drop in affinity when the deletions removed amino acids N-terminal to residue 441 (1-441 had high and 1-326 had low association constants for DNA). The close agreement on the C-terminal limit of the DNA binding region when assaying binding in high salt versus binding with high association constant (residue 492 versus 441) suggests that the salt resistant DNA binding is due to the high affinity binding site. Since 278-616 Rpa1 binds to DNA at high salt, we suggest that the salt-resistant (high affinity?) DNA binding site in the middle of Rpa1 is separate from a salt-sensitive DNA binding site contained in the 1-219 region of the protein.The existence of separate salt-sensitive and -resistant DNA binding sites on Rpa1 was unsuspected. RPA has been reported to bind to single-stranded DNA in two different modes: one with each RPA molecule covering 8 bases, and the other with each RPA molecule covering 30 bases (29Blackwell L.J. Borowiec J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3993-4001Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 30Kim C. Paulus B.F. Wold M.S. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 14197-14206Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Different parts of the Rpa1 molecule with different DNA binding sites could be involved in the two modes of DNA binding. The deletion mapping also shows that the Rpa2 binding region of Rpa1 is dispensable for binding single-stranded DNA with high affinity, implying that Rpa2-3 are not necessary to give Rpa1 a specific structure essential for high affinity association with DNA.In vitro DNA replication reactions are performed at low salt concentrations (less than 50 mM KCl), conditions under which the low affinity DNA binding site is functional. However, the results reported in Fig. 7 suggest that the salt-sensitive DNA binding site (absent in 278-616, but present in Δ222-411 Rpa1) is required but not sufficient to support DNA replication. Of course, the salt-sensitive DNA binding site in the N-terminal third of Rpa1 could actually be used in replication to bind a negatively charged protein and not DNA.Scrutiny of the Rpa1 deletions shows that association with p53 did not correlate with binding to single-stranded DNA or to Rpa2. There was a derivative which bound p53 well but not single-stranded DNA (Δ222-411), others which bound both well (1-522), and a third which bound DNA well but not p53 (278-616). Likewise there were Rpa1 derivatives which bound p53 well but not Rpa2 (1-522 and 1-492), and a derivative which did the reverse (278-616). This confirms our previous observation that the Rpa1-p53 interaction required neither Rpa2 nor single-stranded DNA (15Dutta A. Ruppert J.M. Aster J.C. Winchester W. Nature. 1993; 365: 79-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). The importance of the N-terminal 278 amino acids of Rpa1 for p53 binding is confirmed by a darker exposure of the autoradiogram in Fig. 6A: internally initiated polypeptides in the 1-616, 1-522, and 1-492 input lanes corresponding in size to those expected from initiation at methionine 278 were not bound by GST-p53.Although p53 binds Rpa1 without displacing Rpa2, it excludes single-stranded DNA from the complex (15Dutta A. Ruppert J.M. Aster J.C. Winchester W. Nature. 1993; 365: 79-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). The domain mapping results suggest that the regions of Rpa1 necessary for binding p53 include the N-terminal 221 amino acids and possibly additional residues in the 411-492 region. Therefore p53 could potentially exclude DNA from the N-terminal low affinity DNA binding site (residues 1-219 of Rpa1). Exclusion of DNA from the high affinity DNA binding site (278-492 of Rpa1) could be due to a selective overlap of the DNA and p53 binding sites in the 411-492 region or due to conformation changes induced in Rpa1 by p53. The absence of significant overlap between the p53 and Rpa2 binding sites of Rpa1 explains why p53 does not exclude Rpa2-3 from the p53-Rpa1 complex. Recombinant peptides derived from simple direct repeats of 10-12 amino acid sequences containing bulky hydrophobic residues interspersed with negatively charged residues bind RPA well. 2L. M. Leiter and A. Dutta, unpublished observations. Such sequences are commonly noted in “acidic activation domains” of transcription trans-activators like p53 and VP16. Mutations in bulky hydrophobic residues of p53 abolish interaction with RPA.2 Therefore, the domain of RPA which binds to p53 is likely responsible for more generalized interactions of RPA with other proteins containing “acidic activation domains” such as VP16, yeast Gal4, and the DNA repair protein XP-G.The ability to divide the Rpa1 subunit into subdomains required for essential activities (holocomplex formation and DNA binding) opened the way toward determining whether other subdomains of Rpa1 are essential for DNA replication. Δ222-411 Rpa1 did not support DNA replication indicating that the evolutionary conserved salt-resistant DNA binding activity present in all single-stranded DNA binding replication proteins is essential for replication. The 278-616 and m1-616 form of Rpa1, however, carried out the core activities of the protein: binding to DNA in high salt concentrations and forming a holocomplex with Rpa2 and Rpa3. Yet, neither of these derivatives supported DNA replication suggesting that other activities of Rpa1 are essential for replication. At present we cannot determine whether these mutations selectively remove a functional domain of Rpa1 required only for DNA replication, or selectively misfold the RPA complex such that DNA binding is allowed but not DNA replication. In either case, determination of the step in the DNA replication reaction blocked with these mutants will shed light on what additional activities or properties are required from RPA to support DNA replication.

While the transport of catecholamines into chromaffin granule ghosts has been extensively characterized, there is little information on the mechanism of ATP transport into these structures. Here we show that ATP transport is driven by the electrical component of the electrochemical proton gradient created by the chromaffin granule membrane H+-ATPase, and that the accumulated nucleotide is released from the vesicles by inhibition of the H+-ATPase. GTP and UTP are also substrates for this transporter, distinguishing it from the mitochondrial ADP/ATP exchanger. Accumulation of ADP and ATP (rather than exchange with intravesicular ATP) is demonstrated by high pressure liquid chromatography measurements. The anion transport inhibitor 4,4-diisothiocyanatostilbene-2,2-disulfonic acid (Ki = 27 µM) inhibits ATP transport, while atractyloside, the inhibitor of the mitochondrial ATP/ADP exchanger, is a very poor inhibitor. Finally, we have demonstrated a synergy between the accumulation of ATP and that of serotonin (i.e. more of each solute accumulates when the two are accumulated together), supporting the view that there is an interaction between serotonin and ATP that reduces their effective concentration within the ghosts.

INTRODUCTIONATP is an excitatory neurotransmitter with the unique feature that its final degradation product extracellularly is an inhibitory neurotransmitter, adenosine (1Evans R.J. Derkach V.

In order to control transmitter release, neurons and other secretory cells store neurotransmitters in specialized vesicles, called synaptic vesicles, large dense core vesicles, and chromaffin granules. ATP is stored and cosecreted with positively charged, amine neurotransmitters such as the catecholamines and acetylcholine (4Poisner A.M. Trifaro J.M. The Secretory Granule. Elsevier Biomedical Press, Amsterdam1982Google Scholar). Chromaffin cells of the adrenal medulla store catecholamines, together with ATP, at high concentrations (approximately 500 and 150 mM, respectively) in secretory granules called chromaffin granules (5Hillarp N.A. Acta Physiol. Scand. 1958; 42: 321-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 6Hillarp N.A. Thieme G. Acta Physiol.

It has been proposed that costorage of ATP and catecholamines reduces the effective intragranular osmolarity to that of the cytosol, preventing lysis (8Kopell W.N. Westhead E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 5707-5710Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). An interaction between catecholamines and ATP has also been suggested by experiments showing that depletion of intragranular catecholamine by treatment of chromaffin cells with the granule amine transporter inhibitor, reserpine, causes the depletion of stored ATP (9Caughey B. Kirshner N. J. Neurochem. 1987; 49: 563-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar).The chromaffin granule membrane contains a vacuolar-type (V-type) H+-ATPase, which generates an electrochemical proton gradient, acidifying the granule interior (10Cidon S.

ATP transport into chromaffin granules, on the other hand, requires only the positive inside membrane potential (17Aberer W. Kostron H. Huber E. Winkler H. Biochem. J. 1978; 172: 353-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 18Weber A. Winkler H. Neuroscience. 1981; 6: 2269-2276Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar).Since intact granules contain large amounts of ATP, transport into granules cannot be distinguished from exchange with intragranular ATP. Therefore, we decided to use chromaffin granule ghosts to characterize the vectorial transport of ATP.In this paper, we show that the vectorial transport of ATP into chromaffin granule ghosts results in the accumulation of ATP, and that the transport is not due to exchange with intravesicular ATP. Our results contradict an earlier report describing transport into chromaffin granule ghosts, in which it was concluded that chromaffin granule membranes do not contain a membrane potential-dependent ATP transporter (19Grüninger H.A. Apps D.K. Phillips J.H. Neuroscience. 1983; 9: 917-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). We present a biochemical characterization of this ATP transport and propose a mechanism for the transport of ATP into acidified storage vesicles. We also demonstrate that there is a synergy between the accumulation of ATP and that of 5-HT.DISCUSSIONWe show here that: 1) ATP is transported into chromaffin granule ghosts (Km = 2.9 mM and Vmax = 1.2 nmol/mg/10 min, measured at 2 mM chloride) (Fig. 1, Fig. 2); 2) this transport is due to the accumulation of ADP and ATP and is not due to exchange with intravesicular nucleotide (Table I); 3) the transport requires the membrane potential but not the proton gradient set up by the proton pump (Table I); 4) the trapped nucleotides can be released (Table II); 5) GTP and UTP are also substrates for the transporter (Fig. 3); 6) chloride stimulates ATP transport (Fig. 4); 7) DIDS (Ki = 26 µM) inhibits this ATP transporter (Fig. 5), while atractyloside is a weak inhibitor (Fig. 6); 8) although transport requires magnesium, magnesium concentrations that are equal to or greater than the concentration of ATP inhibit ATP transport (Fig. 6); and 9) the amount of ATP transported can be substantial (6 nmol/mg), up to 38% of the amount of accumulated 5-HT (Fig. 7). These features are considerably different from those of the ATP transport systems in yeast endoplasmic reticulum vesicles (29Mayinger P. Meyer D.I. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 659-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) (Km = 10 µM and Vmax = 1.2 nmol/mg/min), rat liver endoplasmic reticulum vesicles (30Clairmont C.A. De Maio A. Hirschberg C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3983-3990Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Km = 4 µM and Vmax = 6.6 pmol/mg/min) and rat liver Golgi vesicles (31Capasso J.M. Keenan T.W. Abejon C. Hirschberg C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 5233-5240Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Km = 0.9 µM and Vmax = 58 pmol/mg/min).Saturable uptake of nucleotides into intact chromaffin granules has been reported previously (17Aberer W. Kostron H. Huber E. Winkler H. Biochem. J. 1978; 172: 353-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 18Weber A. Winkler H. Neuroscience. 1981; 6: 2269-2276Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 32Weber A. Westhead E.W. Winkler H. Biochem. J. 1983; 210: 789-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). However, this work has been brought into question for two reasons. First, intact granules contain large amounts of ATP; therefore, transport into granules cannot be distinguished from exchange with intragranular ATP. Second, the only report describing ATP transport into chromaffin granule ghosts (which do not contain appreciable amounts of ATP) concluded that chromaffin granule membranes do not contain an ATP transporter and that ATP enters chromaffin granules and ghosts by passive diffusion (19Grüninger H.A. Apps D.K. Phillips J.H. Neuroscience. 1983; 9: 917-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Our clear demonstration of vectorial transport of ATP into chromaffin granule ghosts, resulting in the accumulation of nucleotide, refutes the latter argument. The common characteristics of ATP uptake into chromaffin granules and transport into ghosts are: 1) ATP, GTP, and UTP are all substrates; 2) transport is inhibited by proton ionophores and SCN− and not by ammonium ion; and 3) transport is inhibited by DIDS.Although transport of ATP into chromaffin granule ghosts can be detected in the absence of chloride, and high concentrations of chloride inhibit ATP transport by lowering the membrane potential, chloride stimulates transport at concentrations up to 100 mM (Fig. 4B). One possibility is that chloride stimulates the activity of the V-type, H+-ATPase (26Moriyama Y. Nelson N. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 9175-9180Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Alternatively, chloride may stimulate the ATP transporter directly.ATP transport into chromaffin granule ghosts is similar to that seen for the other negatively charged neurotransmitter, L-glutamate (Km = 1.6 mM and Vmax = 13 nmol/mg/min) (33Naito S. Ueda T. J. Neurochem. 1985; 44: 99-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar, 34Maycox P.R. Deckworth T. Hell J.W. Jahn R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15423-15428Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35Cidon S. Sihra T.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8281-8288Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Shioi J. Naito S. Ueda T. Biochem. J. 1989; 258: 499-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 37Shioi J. Ueda T. Biochem. J. 1990; 267: 63-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Like ATP transport, L-glutamate transport into synaptic vesicles is energized by the membrane potential generated by the synaptic vesicle membrane, V-type, H+-ATPase, and it is inhibited by DIDS. In addition, low concentrations of chloride stimulate L-glutamate transport, while high concentrations of chloride inhibit it. While this effect of chloride may be due to the stimulation of the V-type, H+-ATPase (26Moriyama Y. Nelson N. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 9175-9180Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), chloride does not have this dramatic effect on the transport of other neurotransmitters that are also coupled to the V-type, H+-ATPases (see, for example, the effect of chloride on 5-HT transport into chromaffin granule ghosts; Fig. 4B). Therefore, we propose that the effects of chloride are direct effects on the transporters for ATP and L-glutamate.Since the uptake measured in these experiments is inhibited by bafilomycin A1 and not by oligomycin, we are confident that there is no contribution from the mitochondrial ATP/ADP exchanger. Furthermore, GTP and UTP are also transported into chromaffin granule ghosts; these nucleotides are not substrates for the mitochondrial exchanger (25Klingenberg M. Martinosi A.N. The Enzymes of Biological Membranes. Plenum Press, New York1985: 511Crossref Google Scholar). However, both transporters can be inhibited by atractyloside, although the chromaffin granule system is only very weakly inhibited. In addition, like the ATP transport systems of yeast endoplasmic reticulum and rat liver Golgi vesicles, the chromaffin granule ATP transporter is inhibited by DIDS (Ki = 26 µM) (Fig. 5).Importantly, there is a synergy between ATP and serotonin (5-HT) accumulation in chromaffin granule ghosts (Fig. 7 and Table III). At a given [ATP], there is a proportional increase in ATP accumulation with increasing extravesicular [5-HT]; similarly, at one [5-HT], there is an increase in 5-HT accumulation with an increase in extravesicular [ATP]. Evidently, the amounts of 5-HT and ATP taken up by chromaffin granule ghosts, under the proper conditions, are balanced so that one molecule of ATP with 3-4 negative charges is capable of neutralizing the positive charge of 3-4 5-HT molecules. If ATP4− is the substrate of the transporter, a possibility compatible with the effect of Mg2+ on the transport activity, at an intravesicular pH of 5.5 the accumulated ATP will have three negative charges. This preferential neutralization of accumulated ATP by 5-HT as opposed to protons suggests that there is an interaction between ATP and 5-HT that reduces the effective concentration of the two within the ghosts. The idea that biogenic amines and ATP interact is further supported by the observation that the osmolarity of a solution of 0.6 M epinephrine and 0.15 M ATP is 250 mosm, one third the expected osmolarity (8Kopell W.N. Westhead E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 5707-5710Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).

However, this work has been brought into question for two reasons. First, intact granules contain large amounts of ATP; therefore, transport into granules cannot be distinguished from exchange with intragranular ATP. Second, the only report describing ATP transport into chromaffin granule ghosts (which do not contain appreciable amounts of ATP) concluded that chromaffin granule membranes do not contain an ATP transporter and that ATP enters chromaffin granules and ghosts by passive diffusion (19Grüninger H.A. Apps D.K. Phillips J.H. Neuroscience. 1983; 9: 917-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Our clear demonstration of vectorial transport of ATP into chromaffin granule ghosts, resulting in the accumulation of nucleotide, refutes the latter argument. The common characteristics of ATP uptake into chromaffin granules and transport into ghosts are: 1) ATP, GTP, and UTP are all substrates; 2) transport is inhibited by proton ionophores and SCN− and not by ammonium ion; and 3) transport is inhibited by DIDS.Although transport of ATP into chromaffin granule ghosts can be detected in the absence of chloride, and high concentrations of chloride inhibit ATP transport by lowering the membrane potential, chloride stimulates transport at concentrations up to 100 mM (Fig. 4B). One possibility is that chloride stimulates the activity of the V-type, H+-ATPase (26Moriyama Y. Nelson N. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 9175-9180Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Alternatively, chloride may stimulate the ATP transporter directly.ATP transport into chromaffin granule ghosts is similar to that seen for the other negatively charged neurotransmitter, L-glutamate (Km = 1.6 mM and Vmax = 13 nmol/mg/min) (33Naito S. Ueda T. J. Neurochem. 1985; 44: 99-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar, 34Maycox P.R. Deckworth T. Hell J.W. Jahn R. J. Biol.

Like ATP transport, L-glutamate transport into synaptic vesicles is energized by the membrane potential generated by the synaptic vesicle membrane, V-type, H+-ATPase, and it is inhibited by DIDS. In addition, low concentrations of chloride stimulate L-glutamate transport, while high concentrations of chloride inhibit it. While this effect of chloride may be due to the stimulation of the V-type, H+-ATPase (26Moriyama Y. Nelson N. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 9175-9180Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), chloride does not have this dramatic effect on the transport of other neurotransmitters that are also coupled to the V-type, H+-ATPases (see, for example, the effect of chloride on 5-HT transport into chromaffin granule ghosts; Fig. 4B). Therefore, we propose that the effects of chloride are direct effects on the transporters for ATP and L-glutamate.Since the uptake measured in these experiments is inhibited by bafilomycin A1 and not by oligomycin, we are confident that there is no contribution from the mitochondrial ATP/ADP exchanger. Furthermore, GTP and UTP are also transported into chromaffin granule ghosts; these nucleotides are not substrates for the mitochondrial exchanger (25Klingenberg M. Martinosi A.N. The Enzymes of Biological Membranes. Plenum Press, New York1985: 511Crossref Google Scholar). However, both transporters can be inhibited by atractyloside, although the chromaffin granule system is only very weakly inhibited. In addition, like the ATP transport systems of yeast endoplasmic reticulum and rat liver Golgi vesicles, the chromaffin granule ATP transporter is inhibited by DIDS (Ki = 26 µM) (Fig. 5).Importantly, there is a synergy between ATP and serotonin (5-HT) accumulation in chromaffin granule ghosts (Fig. 7 and Table III). At a given [ATP], there is a proportional increase in ATP accumulation with increasing extravesicular [5-HT]; similarly, at one [5-HT], there is an increase in 5-HT accumulation with an increase in extravesicular [ATP]. Evidently, the amounts of 5-HT and ATP taken up by chromaffin granule ghosts, under the proper conditions, are balanced so that one molecule of ATP with 3-4 negative charges is capable of neutralizing the positive charge of 3-4 5-HT molecules. If ATP4− is the substrate of the transporter, a possibility compatible with the effect of Mg2+ on the transport activity, at an intravesicular pH of 5.5 the accumulated ATP will have three negative charges. This preferential neutralization of accumulated ATP by 5-HT as opposed to protons suggests that there is an interaction between ATP and 5-HT that reduces the effective concentration of the two within the ghosts. The idea that biogenic amines and ATP interact is further supported by the observation that the osmolarity of a solution of 0.6 M epinephrine and 0.15 M ATP is 250 mosm, one third the expected osmolarity (8Kopell W.N. Westhead E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 5707-5710Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We show here that: 1) ATP is transported into chromaffin granule ghosts (Km = 2.9 mM and Vmax = 1.2 nmol/mg/10 min, measured at 2 mM chloride) (Fig. 1, Fig. 2); 2) this transport is due to the accumulation of ADP and ATP and is not due to exchange with intravesicular nucleotide (Table I); 3) the transport requires the membrane potential but not the proton gradient set up by the proton pump (Table I); 4) the trapped nucleotides can be released (Table II); 5) GTP and UTP are also substrates for the transporter (Fig. 3); 6) chloride stimulates ATP transport (Fig. 4); 7) DIDS (Ki = 26 µM) inhibits this ATP transporter (Fig. 5), while atractyloside is a weak inhibitor (Fig. 6); 8) although transport requires magnesium, magnesium concentrations that are equal to or greater than the concentration of ATP inhibit ATP transport (Fig. 6); and 9) the amount of ATP transported can be substantial (6 nmol/mg), up to 38% of the amount of accumulated 5-HT (Fig. 7). These features are considerably different from those of the ATP transport systems in yeast endoplasmic reticulum vesicles (29Mayinger P. Meyer D.I.

Furthermore, prolonged activation of some cells with phorbol esters is associated with the binding of phorbol esters to the kinase and resultant down-regulation. PKCη does not appear to bind phorbol esters (6Ono Y. Fujii T. Ogita K. Kikkawa U. Igarashi K. Nishizuka Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 3099-3103Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar) and is not associated with the down-regulation of PKCη (7Wooten M.W. Zhou G. Seibenhener M.L. Coleman E.S. Cell Growth & Differ. 1994; 5: 395-403PubMed Google Scholar). The Cys-rich region within the C1 domain of PKC consists of two zinc finger motifs with six cysteine residues each and a homologous DNA-binding motif found in transcription factors like GAL4 (8Pan T. Coleman J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2077-2081Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). The use of deletion mutants of different PKC isotypes has revealed that the Cys-rich region is necessary for diacylglycerol and phorbol ester binding (9Burns D.J. Bell R.M. J. Biol.

PKCη contains only one zinc finger and does not bind diacylglycerol or phorbol ester (6Ono Y. Fujii T. Ogita K. Kikkawa U. Igarashi K. Nishizuka Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Moscat J. Cell. 1993; 74: 555-563Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar), and is expressed in the rat mesangial cell (14Huwiler A. Fabbro D. Stabel S. Pfeilschifter J. FEBS Lett. 1992; 300: 259-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) led us to evaluate its role in the signal transduction process resulting in an up-regulation of PGE2 in this cell type and whether this pathway of signaling is relevant to transcriptional activation of the coxII gene by IL-1β.RESULTSTo assess the effects of protein kinase C inhibition on IL-1β-induced expression of coxII, we incubated mesangial cells with and without IL-1β and the protein kinase C inhibitors H7 and staurosporine. Fig. 1 demonstrates that IL-1β induces the message for coxII but not for coxI. In addition, staurosporine at both 10 and 100 nM produced a marked potentiation of coxII induction by IL-1β. Furthermore, staurosporine alone at a concentration of 100 nM induced coxII. Interestingly, H7 alone had no effect on coxII expression; however, it seemed to potentiate the effect of IL-1β on coxII expression although to a lesser extent than staurosporine. Because of these results, we carried out another series of experiments comparing the effects of staurosporine and calphostin C, and in addition, we added a PKC activator, PMA, as a positive control. Fig. 2 shows the results of a Northern analysis of such an experiment. As in Fig. 1, IL-1β stimulated coxII expression (lanes 2 and 3), which was potentiated by 100 nM staurosporine. PMA alone also enhanced expression of coxII (lane 4), but somewhat surprisingly, this effect was potentiated by staurosporine (lane 6). In contrast to the effects of staurosporine, calphostin C inhibited both the effects of IL-1β and PMA on coxII expression (lanes 8 and 9). We considered two possibilities to explain these observations. First, we hypothesized that IL-1β stimulated coxII expression through the participation of protein kinase C since it was calphostin C-inhibitable. We further hypothesized that this protein kinase C was staurosporine-insensitive. Another possibility was that staurosporine was exerting effects on the mesangial cells independent of its protein kinase C inhibitory activity. In an attempt to test whether protein kinase C was involved in IL-1β signaling, we assessed the effects of protein kinase C down-regulation by PMA on IL-1β induction of PGE2. Fig. 3 shows such an experiment. Mesangial cells were first incubated with 500 nM PMA for 24 h followed by IL-1β for an additional 24 h and then compared with untreated cells for their ability to increase PGE2 formation. This experiment demonstrates that down-regulation of PKC does not modify the cellular response to IL-1β. The results thus far were consistent with the involvement of a staurosporine-resistant (12Seynaeve C.M. Kazanietz M.G. Blumberg P.M. Sausville E.A. Worland P.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 45: 1207-1214PubMed Google Scholar), calphostin C-sensitive PKC that was not down-regulated by PMA (7Wooten M.W. Zhou G. Seibenhener M.L. Coleman E.S. Cell Growth & Differ. 1994; 5: 395-403PubMed Google Scholar). PKCη fits these requirements and is expressed in renal mesangial cells (14Huwiler A. Fabbro D. Stabel S. Pfeilschifter J. FEBS Lett. 1992; 300: 259-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Therefore, we evaluated the effect of IL-1β on PKCη translocation from the cytosol in renal mesangial cells by immunoblot analysis. Fig. 4 shows such an experiment. Fig. 4B shows a time course of immunologically detectable PKCη in the cytosol from cells treated with IL-1β for 0 (control), 5, 15, and 30 min. Fig. 4A shows a similar Western blot obtained from cells treated with IL-1β but that had been treated with 100 nM staurosporine 10 min prior to the addition of IL-1β. Fig. 4C shows a Western blot obtained from cells treated with IL-1β in the presence of 2 µM calphostin C 15 min prior to the addition of IL-1β. Fig. 4D shows the densitometric quantitation of the 68-kDa PKCη bands from Fig. 4, A-C (arrow). It can be seen that PKCη was translocated from the cytosol in response to IL-1β, and this translocation was unaffected by staurosporine. In contrast with pretreatment of cells with calphostin C, IL-1β failed to initiate translocation of PKCη. These experiments represent a mean of two in duplicate. Control experiments carried out with a 10-fold molar excess of PKCη carboxyl-terminal peptide completely inhibited antibody detection of the 67-kDa protein (data not shown).Fig. 2Northern analysis of total mesangial cell RNA probed with coxII (COX 2) and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). 50 units/ml IL-1β, 100 nM PMA, 100 nM staurosporine (Stauro), and 5 µM calphostin C (Cal C) were used.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fig. 3PGE2 production by mesangial cells in response to IL-1β.

Fig. 5A shows that IL-1β induces binding of a factor to the oligonucleotide κB motif, and this binding event was not influenced by staurosporine. In contrast, Fig. 5B shows that calphostin C produced a dose-dependent inhibition of binding, again suggesting the involvement of a staurosporine-insensitive but calphostin C-sensitive activation of NFκB in the renal mesangial cell stimulated with IL-1β.Fig. 5Gel shift assays of nuclear extracts.

Experiments using sense oligonucleotides transfected into mesangial cells were used as controls. Fig. 5 shows that the PKCη antisense oligonucleotide inhibited PGE2 formation by 37% (p < 0.05) while the sense control oligonucleotide did not inhibit PGE2 formation in response to IL-1β.

Fig. 8 shows such an experiment. Lane 1 shows the expression of PKCη in 10 µg of cytosolic protein in control cells. Lane 2 shows the levels detected in cytosol from similar amounts of protein from IL-1β-treated cells, and lane 3 represents cytosol from antisense transfected cells.

These experiments demonstrate that staurosporine alone at 100 nM induced mRNA for coxII and markedly potentiated the effects of IL-1β and PMA on inducing coxII mRNA. In contrast, calphostin C alone had no effect on coxII mRNA expression but completely inhibited the ability of IL-1β and PMA to increase coxII mRNA. These surprising results could be explained by suggesting that a PKC isotype that was both calphostin C inhibitable and staurosporine resistant was involved in IL-1β-stimulated coxII expression.Since the renal mesangial cell expresses multiple isotypes including α, γ, ε, and η (14Huwiler A. Fabbro D. Stabel S. Pfeilschifter J. FEBS Lett. 1992; 300: 259-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 19Huwiler A. Fabbro D. Pfeilschifter J. Biochem. J. 1991; 279: 441-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 20Huwiler A. Fabbro D. Pfeilschifter J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 180: 1422-1428Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) and since PKCη is both staurosporine-insensitive (12Seynaeve C.M. Kazanietz M.G. Blumberg P.M. Sausville E.A. Worland P.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 45: 1207-1214PubMed Google Scholar) and calphostin C-sensitive (21Larivée P. Levine S.J. Martinez A. Wu T. Logun C. Shelhamer J.H. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1994; 11: 199-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) and is not down regulated by PMA (7Wooten M.W. Zhou G. Seibenhener M.L. Coleman E.S. Cell Growth & Differ. 1994; 5: 395-403PubMed Google Scholar), we postulated that if PKCη was involved in the IL-1β signaling pathway leading to coxII expression, then down-regulation of PKC with PMA should not influence the response of the mesangial cell to IL-1β. Fig. 3 supports this thesis and demonstrates that exposure of mesangial cells to 500 nM PMA for 24 h does not influence the cellular response to IL-1β with respect to PGE2 formation. It should be stated that this experimental maneuver inhibited both nitrite and inducible nitric oxide synthase expression by 50% (data not shown). This experiment confirms that down-regulation of PKC by PMA does not influence the cellular response to IL-1β and again suggests the involvement of a PKC isotype that is not down-regulated by PMA. Fig. 4 indeed demonstrates that IL-1β initiates a translocation of PKCη from cytosol, presumably to some membrane component, and that incubating the cells with staurosporine does not prevent this translocation phenomenon while translocation was inhibited by calphostin C.Furthermore, staurosporine at 10 and 100 nM did not inhibit the IL-1β-stimulated binding of a nucleoprotein to the κB motif as determined by electromobility shift assays (Fig. 5A). In contrast, calphostin C inhibited the binding event in a dose-dependent manner, again confirming that IL-1β stimulates a staurosporine-insensitive, but calphositin C-sensitive translocation of NFκB to the nucleus.The experiments described thus far have demonstrated that IL-1β induces the mRNA for coxII and that this inductive phenomenon is dependent on a staurosporine-insensitive, calphostin C-sensitive PKC isotype. We have demonstrated that PKCη is translocated from the cytosol in response to IL-1β. Therefore, in an attempt to determine whether or not this activation of PKCη is relevant to CoxII induction of PGE2 formation, we reasoned that if we were able to decrease the activity of PKCη selectively with antisense oligonucleotides to PKCη, then we would be able to close the loop and demonstrate a functional consequence of PKCη in the signal transduction mechanisms involved in PGE2 production. The experiment illustrated by Fig. 6, therefore, demonstrates that while the antisense oligonucleotides to PKCη inhibit PGE2 formation in response to IL-1β by 37%, the sense oligonucleotides had no effect. Similarly, the antisense oligonucleotide inhibited CoxII protein expression by 40% while the sense oligonucleotide did not. Thus, we feel these experiments close the loop and draw a link between the activation of PKCη and the induction of coxII mRNA. Clearly the production of PGE2 in renal mesangial cells is the result of activation and induction of phospholipase A2 (22Pfeilschifter J. Schalkwijk C. Briner V.A. van den Bosch H. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 2516-2523Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar) plus the induction and expression of CoxII. The antisense oligonucleotides that only inhibit PGE2 and CoxII expression by about 40% suggest that the effects of PKCη are exerted entirely at the level of the cyclooxygenase.These experiments, while intriguing, clearly illustrate the complexity of the signal transduction process and point to the fact that there are multiple factors and pathways that are involved in IL-1β signal transduction mechanisms. One key feature of these experiments is the fact that while it could be argued that if the PKCη that is staurosporine-insensitive was the only isotype involved in this signal transduction process, then the use of staurosporine should not have potentiated the effect of IL-1β but rather should have had no effect on coxII message production. In reality, it did potentiate coxII mRNA and suggests that staurosporine was having an additional effect as well as that of failure to inhibit PKCη.We postulate that two additional mechanisms are possible to explain this phenomenon. The first is that staurosporine is having an additional effect that is unrecognized and that somehow leads to the potentiation of the effect of IL-1β on coxII mRNA production. While we cannot rule out this possibility since the use of staurosporine, a pharmacological agent, carries with it the possibility of certain unknown functions, we feel other plausible explanations for this phenomenon should be considered. In experiments not shown but previously reported, IL-1β does not affect coxI expression (16Coyne D.W. Nickols M. Bertrand W. Morrison A.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: F97-F102PubMed Google Scholar, 25Rzymkiewicz D.M. DuMaine J. Morrison A.R. Kidney Int. 1995; 47: 1354-1363Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Second, there may be other staurosporine-sensitive PKC isotypes that are involved in the signaling process and that are inhibited by staurosporine. Such a phenomenon could be linked to the activation of a phosphatase that regulates the activity of another signal transduction process mediated by IL-1β that is also coupled to transcriptional activation leading to an increase of mRNA for coxII. There is evidence from other investigators suggesting that activation of PKC decreases phosphorylation of c-jun at sites that negatively regulate its DNA binding activity (23Boyle W.J. Smeal T. Defize L.H.K. Angel P. Woodgett J.R. Karin M. Hunter T. Cell. 1991; 64: 573-584Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (848) Google Scholar). In addition, there is evidence that activators of protein kinase C stimulate association of the Shc and the PEST tyrosine phosphatases (24Habib T. Herrera R. Decker S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25243-25246Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). While we have no direct evidence that the Shc or PEST tyrosine phosphatases are involved in interleukin signaling mechanisms, we have provided evidence that vanadate alone, an inhibitor of protein tyrosine phosphatases, increases mRNA for coxII and that it potentiates the effect of IL-1β on coxII mRNA levels (25Rzymkiewicz D.M. DuMaine J. Morrison A.R. Kidney Int. 1995; 47: 1354-1363Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The available data at least raise the issue of whether there may be a staurosporine-sensitive isotype that is coupled to the activation of a phosphatase that acts as a breaking phenomenon on the IL-1β stimulatory effect. The result of adding staurosporine to inhibit this protein kinase C would be to inhibit the effect of this phosphatase and, therefore, leave the positive effects mediated through PKCη unchecked. This would clearly explain a potentiation of the effect of IL-1β and will also explain why the drug alone at 100 nM was able to induce the message for the coxII gene. We are currently addressing this issue in the laboratory by designing experiments directed at this possibility. We suggest, therefore, that a PKC isotype that is coupled to the activation of a phosphatase could influence the expression of the mRNA for coxII. Similarly surprising observations have been described in PC12 cells where staurosporine markedly potentiated neurotensin and/or neuromedin mRNA accumulation in combination with other inducers (for example, NGF and PMA) and in some circumstances appeared to substitute for PMA (11Tischler A.S. Ruzicka L.A. Dobner P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1141-1146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, NGF-induced differentiation of PC12 cells utilizes the PMA-insensitive PKCη isotype. This was demonstrated by activation of PKCη by NGF and by attenuation of the effects of NGF on neurite outgrowth by antisense oligonucleotides to PKCη (26Coleman E.S. Wooten M.W. J. Mol. Neurosci. 1994; 5: 39-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar).In summary, we feel we have provided the evidence that PKCη is involved in the signaling mechanism for IL-1β. We feel that this pathway is involved in the ability of IL-1β to increase mRNA expression for coxII. The recent data suggesting that PKCη can phosphorylate IκB (27Diaz-Meco M.T. Dominguez I. Sanz L. Dent P. Lozano J. Municio M.M. Berra E. Hay R.T. Sturgill T.W. Moscat J. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2842-2848Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar) and that inhibition of PKCη blocks the activation of NFκB-like activity in Zenopus laevis oocytes (28Dominguez I. Sanz L. Arenzana-Seisdedos F. Diaz-Meco M.T. Virelizier J.-L. Moscat J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1290-1295Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) suggest that this isotype of PKC may be very relevant to the effect of the transcriptional factor NFκB on PGE2 production in response to IL-1β. This mechanism also has support in the observation that PKCη mediates NFκB activation in human immunodeficiency virus-infected monocytes (29Folgueira L. McElhinny J.A. Bren G.D. MacMorran W.S.

To date there are at least 12 isotypes of PKC described and identified as α, βI, βII, γ, δ, ε, η, η, θ, τ, λ, and µ. These PKC isotypes are unique with respect to their primary structure, expression patterns, subcellular localization, and responsiveness to extracellular ligands. Recent reviews have highlighted the evidence that the isotypes might have separate and unique functions in the cell (2Hug H. Sarre T.F. Biochem. J. 1993; 291: 329-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (1216) Google Scholar). Activation of PKC is associated with its translocation from the cytosolic (soluble) fraction to the particulate (membrane) fraction (4Woelf M. Cuatrecasas P. Sahyoun N. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 15718-15722Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Dang P.M.-C. Hakim J. Périanin A. FEBS Lett. 1994; 349: 338-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Furthermore, prolonged activation of some cells with phorbol esters is associated with the binding of phorbol esters to the kinase and resultant down-regulation. PKCη does not appear to bind phorbol esters (6Ono Y. Fujii T. Ogita K. Kikkawa U. Igarashi K. Nishizuka Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 3099-3103Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar) and is not associated with the down-regulation of PKCη (7Wooten M.W. Zhou G. Seibenhener M.L. Coleman E.S. Cell Growth & Differ. 1994; 5: 395-403PubMed Google Scholar). The Cys-rich region within the C1 domain of PKC consists of two zinc finger motifs with six cysteine residues each and a homologous DNA-binding motif found in transcription factors like GAL4 (8Pan T.

InsP3 receptor down-regulation was not accompanied by parallel changes in the concentrations of several other relevant proteins (endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase, and protein kinases α and ε).

Analysis of InsP3 receptor immunofluorescence confirmed that the receptors are not redistributed prior to or during down-regulation. Finally, of a range of protease inhibitors tested, only N-acetyl-Leu-Leu-norleucinal blocked down-regulation.

Phosphoinositidase C (PC) 1The abbreviations used are: PCphosphoinositidase CInsP3inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphatePKCprotein kinase CERendoplasmic reticulumHMG-CoA reductase3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductaseALLNN-acetyl-Leu-Leu-norleucinal. -mediated phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate hydrolysis leads to the formation of two intracellular signaling molecules, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3) and 1,2-diacylglycerol (1Berridge M.J. Nature. 1993; 361: 315-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (6188) Google Scholar, 2Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28495-28498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1472) Google Scholar). These molecules then bind to and activate, respectively, InsP3 receptors and members of the protein kinase C (PKC) family (1Berridge M.J. Nature. 1993; 361: 315-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (6188) Google Scholar, 2Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28495-28498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1472) Google Scholar). InsP3 receptors play a crucial role in intracellular signaling as they form channels that conduct Ca2+ in an InsP3-sensitive manner (1Berridge M.J. Nature. 1993; 361: 315-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (6188) Google Scholar, 3Berridge M.J. Biochem. J. 1995; 312: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (1050) Google Scholar, 4Furuichi T. Mikoshiba K. J.

Of the InsP3 receptors fully sequenced (types I, II, and III), the type I receptor is the most widely expressed and appears to be ubiquitous in animal tissues (4Furuichi T. Mikoshiba K. J. Neurochem. 1995; 64: 953-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 5Joseph S.K. Cell. Signalling. 1996; 8: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The primary intracellular location of the type I receptor is the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and its primary function appears to be to regulate Ca2+ release from this organelle (3Berridge M.J. Biochem. J. 1995; 312: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (1050) Google Scholar, 4Furuichi T. Mikoshiba K. J. Neurochem. 1995; 64: 953-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 5Joseph S.K. Cell.

The importance of the type I InsP3 receptor is reflected by the extent to which it is regulated; Ca2+, ATP, phosphorylation, and cytoskeletal elements can all regulate receptor function (4Furuichi T. Mikoshiba K. J. Neurochem. 1995; 64: 953-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 5Joseph S.K. Cell. Signalling. 1996; 8: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 6Joseph S.K. Ryan S.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23059-23065Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, receptor concentration can be altered, since activation of certain PC-linked receptors reduces cellular type I InsP3 receptor levels with half-maximal effects at ∼1 h (7Wojcikiewicz R.J.H. Nahorski S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22234-22241Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Wojcikiewicz R.J.H. Nakade S. Mikoshiba K. Nahorski S.R. J.

Chem. 1994; 269: 7963-7969Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This down-regulation has been observed in a number of cell types stimulated with a variety of agonists; for example, in SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells stimulated with carbachol, a muscarinic agonist (7Wojcikiewicz R.J.H. Nahorski S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22234-22241Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Wojcikiewicz R.J.H. Nakade S. Mikoshiba K. Nahorski S.R. J. Neurochem. 1992; 59: 383-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), and in AR4-2J rat pancreatoma cells stimulated with cholecystokinin (9Wojcikiewicz R.J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11678-11683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). As InsP3 receptor down-regulation suppresses Ca2+ mobilization (7Wojcikiewicz R.J.H. Nahorski S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22234-22241Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the down-regulatory process may serve to limit Ca2+-mediated effects during chronic cell stimulation. To date, investigation of the mechanism of InsP3 receptor down-regulation has shown that it results from accelerated receptor degradation (10Wojcikiewicz R.J.H. Furuichi T. Nakade S. Mikoshiba K. Nahorski S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7963-7969Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This acceleration is not mediated by PKC and appears to require persistent receptor activation by InsP3 (7Wojcikiewicz R.J.H. Nahorski S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22234-22241Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Wojcikiewicz R.J.H. Nakade S. Mikoshiba K. Nahorski S.R. J. Neurochem. 1992; 59: 383-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). It also requires InsP3 receptor-mediated Ca2+-flux, since thapsigargin, which discharges ER Ca2+ stores independently of InsP3 receptors (1Berridge M.J. Nature. 1993; 361: 315-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (6188) Google Scholar, 3Berridge M.J. Biochem. J. 1995; 312: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (1050) Google Scholar), blocks carbachol-induced InsP3 receptor down-regulation in SH-SY5Y cells (10Wojcikiewicz R.J.H. Furuichi T. Nakade S. Mikoshiba K. Nahorski S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7963-7969Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). An additional link with Ca2+ comes from a study showing that a Ca2+-dependent cytosolic cysteine protease activity, perhaps calpain (11Croall D.E. Demartino G.N. Physiol. Rev. 1991; 71: 813-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (782) Google Scholar), can cleave purified type I InsP3 receptor (12Magnusson A. Haug L.S. Walaas S.I. Ostvold A.C. FEBS Lett. 1993; 323: 229-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). As yet, however, it is not known whether the InsP3 receptor degradation seen in intact cells (7Wojcikiewicz R.J.H. Nahorski S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22234-22241Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Wojcikiewicz R.J.H. Nakade S. Mikoshiba K. Nahorski S.R. J.

Here we report on the specificity and site of InsP3 receptor degradation in intact cells and provide evidence that a cysteine protease activity, most likely calpain, is responsible for InsP3 receptor down-regulation. SH-SY5Y cells, generously provided by either Dr. J. L. Beidler (Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York) or Dr. S. K. Fisher (University of Michigan), and AR4-2J cells (obtained from ATCC) were cultured routinely as described (9Wojcikiewicz R.J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11678-11683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). When appropriate, stimuli or inhibitors were added directly to culture medium and cells were maintained at 37°C for the time of pretreatment required. Specific type I receptor antiserum was produced from a peptide corresponding to the C-terminal 19 amino acids of rat and human type I InsP3 receptor and was then affinity purified (9Wojcikiewicz R.J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11678-11683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar, 10Wojcikiewicz R.J.H. Furuichi T. Nakade S. Mikoshiba K. Nahorski S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7963-7969Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The other antisera used were: anti-rabbit cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (crude rabbit serum C4, generously provided by Dr. D. H. MacLennan, University of Toronto) (13Lytton J. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15024-15031Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), anti-rat PKCα and ε (mouse monoclonal antibodies, obtained from Transduction Laboratories), and anti-rat 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (HMG-CoA reductase, crude rabbit serum, generously provided by Dr. P. A. Edwards, University of California, Los Angeles). Control or pretreated cell monolayers were harvested in 155 mM NaCl, 10 mM Hepes, 1 mM EDTA, pH 7.4, and were collected by centrifugation at 400 × g for 2 min. Cell pellets were then resuspended in ice-cold homogenization buffer (10 mM Tris, 1 mM EGTA, 0.2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 10 µM leupeptin, 10 µM pepstatin, 0.2 µM soybean trypsin inhibitor, pH 7.4) and were disrupted with a Polytron homogenizer (1 × 10 s). Homogenates were then centrifuged (38,000 × g for 10 min at 4°C) and microsomal preparations obtained were resuspended in homogenization buffer and frozen until required. For analysis of type I InsP3 receptor, Ca2+-ATPase, and PKC isozymes, microsomal preparations were denatured at 100°C for 5 min in SDS gel loading buffer (14Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, NY1989Google Scholar); for HMG-CoA reductase analysis, samples were incubated at 20°C for 45 min in SDS gel loading buffer (14Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, NY1989Google Scholar) plus 6 M urea. Samples (10 µg of protein/lane) and prestained molecular mass markers were then subjected to electrophoresis in polyacrylamide gels, were transferred to nitrocellulose, incubated with antisera, peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies, ECL detection reagents (Amersham), and x-ray film (14Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, NY1989Google Scholar). For permeabilization, pellets of harvested SH-SY5Y cells were resuspended in 120 mM KCl, 1 mM EDTA, 20 mM Tris, pH 7.4 (Buffer A). The suspension was then treated with digitonin (75 µg/ml) for 10 min at 20°C and was centrifuged (1000 × g for 2 min). The pellet of permeabilized cells was then washed and finally resuspended in ice-cold Buffer A. To prepare cytosol, pellets of harvested SH-SY5Y cells were resuspended in ice-cold 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 20 mM Tris, pH 7.4, and were disrupted with 25 strokes of a Dounce tissue grinder. The homogenate was then centrifuged at 40,000 × g for 10 min at 4°C and the supernatant was used as a cytosol preparation. Permeabilized cells and cytosol were then co-incubated without or with Ca2+ and protease inhibitors in 45 mM KCl, 0.375 mM EDTA, 0.375 mM EGTA, 0.375 mM dithiothreitol, 15 mM Tris, pH 7.4 (final volume, 40 µl). After 25 min at 37°C, reactions were quenched with SDS gel loading buffer (14Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, NY1989Google Scholar) and samples were probed for type I receptor immunoreactivity. SH-SY5Y cells, grown on coverslips, were rinsed with Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with Ca2+/Mg2+ and then fixed in the same buffer plus 3.6% paraformaldehyde (Acros Organics). All subsequent steps were performed in Ca2+/Mg2+-free phosphate-buffered saline; cells were washed once for 2 min, permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 for 10 min, washed 3 times (10 min/wash), incubated with type I InsP3 receptor-specific antibody plus 10% fetal calf serum for 1 h, washed 3 times, incubated with rhodamine-labeled donkey anti-rabbit IgG (Chemicon) plus 10% fetal calf serum for 1 h and finally washed 3 times. To define nonspecific fluorescence, cells were incubated with antibody preadsorbed with peptide antigen (10 µg/ml). Coverslips were then rinsed with water, mounted in 90% glycerol, 0.1% p-phenylenediamine and immobilized with nail polish. Photomicrographs were generated from 10 s exposures using a Nikon Microphot-FXA microscope equipped for analysis of rhodamine fluorescence. Peroxidase-conjugated antibodies, molecular mass markers, dithiothreitol, cholecystokinin (Tyr-(SO3H)-fragment 26-33 amide), carbachol, protease inhibitors, brefeldin A, cholesterol, 25-hydroxycholesterol, Triton X-100, p-phenylenediamine, and digitonin were obtained from Sigma. Protein was assayed with Coomassie Blue using bovine serum albumin as a standard (15Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217548) Google Scholar). All data shown are representative of three or more independent experiments. To gain insight into the down-regulatory process, other relevant proteins were quantified. Initially examined were ER Ca2+-ATPase, which like the type I InsP3 receptor is an ER membrane protein involved in Ca2+ homeostasis (3Berridge M.J. Biochem. J. 1995; 312: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (1050) Google Scholar, 13Lytton J. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15024-15031Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and PKC isozymes α and ε, which like InsP3 receptors can be down-regulated during cell stimulation because of accelerated proteolysis (16Young S. Parker P.J. Ullrich A. Stabel S. Biochem. J. 1987; 244: 775-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar, 17Kiley S.C. Parker P.J. Fabbro D. Jaken S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23761-23768Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Shea T.B. Beermann M.L. Griffin W.R. Leli U. FEBS Lett. 1994; 350: 223-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 19Eto A. Akita Y. Saido T.C. Suzuki K. Kawashima S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25115-25120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Fig. 1a shows that while type I InsP3 receptor immunoreactivity in SH-SY5Y cells was dramatically reduced by exposure to carbachol (half-maximal effect at ∼1 h), Ca2+-ATPase and PKCα and ε immunoreactivity remained unchanged for up to 4 h. Thus, InsP3 receptor down-regulation does not reflect a general increase in ER membrane protein degradation and is discrete from the process that leads to PKC degradation. Next, we examined whether HMG-CoA reductase depletion accompanied InsP3 receptor down-regulation, since this ER membrane enzyme can also down-regulate (in response to sterols) because of accelerated degradation (20Gil G. Faust J.R. Chin D.J. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Cell. 1985; 41: 249-258Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 21Inoue S. Simoni R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9080-9086Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Meigs T.E. Simoni R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13547-13552Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Correll C.C. Ng L. Edwards P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17390-17393Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These studies were conducted in AR4-2J cells, in which HMG-CoA reductase was up-regulated 2-3-fold by incubation of cells in serum-free medium for 18 h. 2R. J. H. Wojcikiewicz, unpublished observations. Fig. 1b shows that while cholecystokinin was very effective at down-regulating the type I InsP3 receptor it had no effect on HMG-CoA reductase levels (lanes 3 and 4). Conversely, sterols down-regulated HMG-CoA reductase, but did not alter InsP3 receptor levels (lanes 5 and 6). Thus, the proteolytic mechanisms that control the levels of InsP3 receptors and other ER membrane proteins are highly selective. While the data in Fig. 1 rule out wholesale destruction of the ER as the basis of InsP3 receptor down-regulation, the possibility remains that down-regulation results from the selective destruction of a small portion of ER that is enriched in InsP3 receptors. This is plausible because InsP3 receptors may reside in specialized regions of the ER (24Sitia R. Meldolesi J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 1067-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 25Lievremont P. Hill A. Hilly M. Mauger J. Biochem. J. 1994; 300: 419-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) and Ca2+ mobilizing agents can cause ER fragmentation and can regulate lysosome-mediated ER autophagy (26Booth C. Koch G.L.E. Cell. 1989; 59: 729-737Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar, 27Dunn W.A. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 1935-1945Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar, 28Gordon P.B. Holen I. Fosse M. Rotnes J.S. Seglen P.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26107-26112Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Autophagic consumption of an ER subfraction would be expected to require both vesicularization of that subfraction and lysosomal activity. However, neither brefeldin A, which blocks vesicle and protein transfer from the ER (29Lippincott-Schwartz J. Yuan L.C. Bonifacino J.S. Klausner R.D. Cell. 1989; 56: 801-813Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1315) Google Scholar), nor NH4Cl, which inhibits lysosomal proteases (30Lippincott-Schwartz J. Bonifacino J.S. Yuan L.C. Klausner R.D. Cell. 1988; 54: 209-220Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar), inhibited the effects of carbachol in SH-SY5Y cells (Fig. 2). Whether or not InsP3 receptors are redistributed prior to their degradation was investigated more directly by analyzing receptor immunofluorescence. In unstimulated SH-SY5Y cells (Fig. 3a), a complex pattern of expression was seen; relatively low InsP3 receptor levels distributed evenly throughout the cytoplasm and higher concentrations in discrete areas at the cell margins. However, both the cytoplasmic and punctate staining fell at similar rates during stimulation with carbachol (Fig. 3, b-d). Together with the data in Fig. 2, these results indicate that InsP3 receptors are degraded while resident at their normal cellular locations. First, SH-SY5Y cells were preincubated with a range of protease inhibitors and were then stimulated with carbachol for 2 h (Fig. 4). The agents tested were the cysteine protease inhibitor N-acetyl-Leu-Leu-norleucinal (ALLN, also known as calpain inhibitor I), the metalloprotease inhibitors phosphoramidon and N-carbobenzoxy-Gly-Phe, the aspartic protease inhibitor pepstatin, the serine protease inhibitors 4-amidinophenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride and 3,4-dichloroisocoumarin, and the serine/cysteine protease inhibitor leupeptin. While these agents do not readily cross the plasma membrane, previous studies have shown that ALLN (31Inoue S. Bar-Nun S. Roitelman J. Simoni R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13311-13317Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), phosphoramidon (32Wu-Wong J.R. Chiou W.J. Opgenorth T.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 44: 422-429PubMed Google Scholar), pepstatin (33Wang C.N. Hobman T.C. Brindley D.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24924-24931Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), 3,4-dichloroisocoumarin (34Gardner A.M. Aviel S. Argon Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25940-25947Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and leupeptin (35Nishimura Y. Kato K. Furuno K. Himeno M. Biol. Pharmaceutical Bull. 1995; 18: 945-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) can to an extent enter cells and inhibit proteolysis. Fig. 4 shows that the down-regulatory effect of carbachol (compare lanes 1 and 2) was inhibited by ALLN (lanes 3-5), but not by the other agents (lanes 6-12), and that ALLN alone had no effect on InsP3 receptor immunoreactivity (lane 13). Thus, cysteine protease activity appears to degrade the type I InsP3 receptor. To exclude the possibility that the inhibitory effect of ALLN resulted from nonspecific cytotoxicity, Ca2+ mobilization was measured in fura-2 loaded control and ALLN-treated SH-SY5Y cells as described previously (36Wojcikiewicz R.J.H. Tobin A.B. Nahorski S.R. J. Neurochem. 1994; 63: 177-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Pretreatment with ALLN (100 µg/ml) for 4 h did not significantly alter carbachol-induced increases in cytosolic Ca2+ concentration,2 indicating that ALLN does not interfere with InsP3 generation or its Ca2+-mobilizing potential. Thus, inhibition of down-regulation by ALLN is indeed a consequence of cysteine protease inhibition. To define the protease activity we examined, in permeabilized cells, the effects of calpain inhibitor peptide, a 27-residue derivative of calpastatin (37Ma H. Yang H.Q. Takano E. Hatanaka M. Maki M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24430-24436Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the endogenous inhibitor of calpains (11Croall D.E. Demartino G.N. Physiol. Rev. 1991; 71: 813-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (782) Google Scholar). Calpain inhibitor peptide specifically inhibits the activity of purified µ-calpain with half-maximal effect at ∼0.1 µM (37Ma H. Yang H.Q. Takano E. Hatanaka M. Maki M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24430-24436Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 5 shows that Ca2+ was effective in stimulating InsP3 receptor degradation in digitonin-permeabilized cells only when cytosol was present (compare lanes 3 and 6) and that calpain inhibitor peptide inhibited this proteolysis with half-maximal effect at 0.1-1 µM (lanes 11-13). Thus, calpain activity is responsible for InsP3 receptor degradation under these conditions. As ALLN also inhibited InsP3 receptor proteolysis (lanes 7-9) with similar potency to that seen in intact cells (Fig. 4), it is likely that the inhibitory effect of ALLN in intact cells is also due to inhibition of calpain activity. It remains a possibility, however, that a cysteine protease activity other than calpain degrades the InsP3 receptor in intact cells, since ALLN is also known to inhibit other cysteine proteases (38Figueiredo-Pereira M.E. Banik N. Wilk S. J. Neurochem. 1994; 62: 1989-1994Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The finding that InsP3 receptors are degraded specifically in stimulated intact cells (Fig. 1) immediately places constraints on possible mechanisms that might account for InsP3 receptor down-regulation, since activation of a protease with freedom to degrade a broad range of substrates is clearly untenable. Moreover, as neither brefeldin A nor NH4Cl inhibited down-regulation and the type I InsP3 receptor was not redistributed during cell stimulation (Fig. 2, Fig. 3), it appears that InsP3 receptors are degraded while occupying their normal intracellular sites (i.e. the membranes of intracellular Ca2+ stores). These findings, together with evidence that InsP3 binding initiates receptor degradation (7Wojcikiewicz R.J.H. Nahorski S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22234-22241Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Wojcikiewicz R.J.H. Nakade S. Mikoshiba K. Nahorski S.R. J. Neurochem. 1992; 59: 383-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), restricts the plausible mechanisms that could account for down-regulation to two possibilities; either (i) a protease is stimulated specifically in the vicinity of activated InsP3 receptors, or (ii) a conformational change in InsP3 receptors during InsP3 binding makes them susceptible to proteolysis. Support for the first possibility comes from the findings that Ca2+ mobilization via InsP3 receptors is required for acceleration of InsP3 receptor degradation (10Wojcikiewicz R.J.H. Furuichi T. Nakade S. Mikoshiba K. Nahorski S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7963-7969Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and that certain cytosolic proteases, such as the calpains, are activated by Ca2+ (11Croall D.E. Demartino G.N. Physiol. Rev. 1991; 71: 813-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (782) Google Scholar) and appear to mediate down-regulation (Fig. 4, Fig. 5). Thus, the Ca2+ mobilized during InsP3 receptor activation may provide the signal that stimulates proteolysis. But, would Ca2+ concentration be raised sufficiently to stimulate calpain activity and would such activation lead to selective degradation of InsP3 receptors? The two known forms of calpain, µ-calpain and m-calpain, are activated in vitro by 1-100 µM and 0.1-1 mM Ca2+, respectively, but in vivo may be an order of magnitude more sensitive to Ca2+ due to the presence of co-factors, such as phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (11Croall D.E. Demartino G.N. Physiol. Rev. 1991; 71: 813-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (782) Google Scholar, 39Suzuki K. Saido T.C. Hirai S. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1992; 674: 218-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Furthermore, as total and free Ca2+ concentrations in the ER lumen are, respectively, ∼2 mM and ∼10 µM or above (40Taylor C.W. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1995; 23: 637-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 41Dawson A.P. Rich G.T. Loomis-Husselbee J.W. Biochem. J. 1995; 310: 371-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), and InsP3 receptors form high-conductance channels (40Taylor C.W. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1995; 23: 637-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), concentrations of Ca2+ greater that micromolar should be generated in the cytosol in the vicinity of channel pores. Indeed, experimental estimates of local Ca2+ concentrations near sites of store mobilization are 5-6 µM (42Rizzuto R. Brini M. Murgia M. Pozzan T. Science. 1993; 262: 744-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (1016) Google Scholar) and may be considerably higher in the immediate vicinity of channels. Such concentrations would be sufficient to elevate calpain activity (11Croall D.E. Demartino G.N. Physiol. Rev. 1991; 71: 813-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (782) Google Scholar). These values contrast with “global” increases in cytosolic Ca2+ concentration which would be unlikely to activate calpains. For example, global cytosolic Ca2+ concentration during the sustained phase of Ca2+ mobilization in carbachol-stimulated SH-SY5Y cells is only ∼0.2 µM (36Wojcikiewicz R.J.H. Tobin A.B. Nahorski S.R. J. Neurochem. 1994; 63: 177-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). With regard to the specificity of InsP3 receptor degradation, Ca2+ concentration declines rapidly with increasing distance from channel pores, because of the high buffering capacity of cytosol (40Taylor C.W. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1995; 23: 637-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Thus, Ca2+-dependent protease activation should be confined to the immediate vicinity of InsP3 receptors. Additionally, if InsP3-induced conformational changes in the type I InsP3 receptor (43Mignery G.A. Sudhof T.C. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3893-3898Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar) make the receptor more susceptible to proteolysis, such structural changes could contribute to the selectivity of the down-regulatory process. In summary, the data presented show that persistent activation of PC-linked receptors leads to the selective proteolysis of InsP3 receptors without changes in ER integrity or prior InsP3 receptor redistribution, and that a cysteine protease activity, probably µ- and/or m-calpain, mediates this adaptive response. We suggest that Ca2+ released via InsP3 receptors generates local concentrations of Ca2+ sufficient to stimulate calpain(s). Such a role for calpain(s) concurs with the known calpain-mediated degradation of other targets in response to activation of PC-linked receptors, namely PKCε in pituitary cells in response to thyrotropin-releasing hormone (19Eto A. Akita Y. Saido T.C. Suzuki K. Kawashima S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25115-25120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), and PC-β3 in platelets in response to thrombin and collagen (44Banno Y. Nakashima S. Hachiya T. Nozawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4318-4324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). As yet, however, the factors which govern that these proteins should be targets for calpain(s) are unknown. Perhaps the factor that unifies InsP3 receptors, PKCε and PC-β3 is their localization to membranes; the latter two proteins become membrane-bound upon cell stimulation (19Eto A. Akita Y. Saido T.C. Suzuki K. Kawashima S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25115-25120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 44Banno Y. Nakashima S. Hachiya T. Nozawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4318-4324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Membranes may provide either a lipid co-factor that facilitates calpain activation (39Suzuki K. Saido T.C. Hirai S. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1992; 674: 218-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) or, because of the presence of Ca2+ channels, may be the only sites at which Ca2+ concentration is sufficiently high to raise calpain activity.

CGA has been shown to exist primarily in a tetrameric state at pH 5.5 and primarily in a dimeric state at pH 7.5, and CGB has been shown to exist in a monomeric state at both pH 5.5 and pH 7.5. Using purified CGA and CGB, it recently has been shown that CGA interacts with CGB at pH 5.5 (Yoo, S. H. (1996) J. Biol. Chem. 271, 1558-1565). In expanding this investigation, we have studied the temperature dependence of the pH-dependent interaction of CGA and CGB by analytical ultracentrifugation and found that two molecules of CGA bound to two molecules of CGB at pH 5.5 with ΔG0 values of −43.6 kcal/mol in the absence of Ca2+ at 37°C and −40.3 kcal/mol in the presence of 0.1 mM Ca2+. However, one molecule of CGA bound to one molecule of CGB at pH 7.5 with ΔG0 values of −13.6 kcal/mol in the absence of Ca2+ at 37°C. The magnitude of ΔG0 values increased with increasing temperatures at both pH values. However, the values for enthalpy and entropy changes decreased with increasing temperatures in both pH levels, suggesting formation of more ordered structures. In the absence of Ca2+ at pH 5.5, the heterotetramerization reaction at 37°C was entropically driven, whereas in the presence of Ca2+ (0.1 mM) the heterotetramerization was virtually an enthalpic reaction. On the other hand, the heterodimer formation in the absence of Ca2+ at pH 7.5 showed large negative enthalpy and entropy changes at 37°C, indicating an enthalpic interaction compensated by entropic changes. In view of the interaction of tetrameric CGA with tetrameric inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) receptor and the existence of heterotetrameric IP3 receptor in the cell, the heterotetramer formation by CGA and CGB not only raises the possibility of interaction between the heterotetrameric chromogranin and heterotetrameric IP3 receptor but also appears to reflect their important roles in the cell.

Our characterization of this 66-kDa protein demonstrates that its physiological role is to promote the recycling of hsp 70 by catalyzing the dissociation of hsp 70-bound ADP in exchange for ATP. We have therefore termed the 66-kDa protein RF-hsp 70, a recycling factor for hsp 70. RF-hsp 70 promotes stoichiometric binding of ATP to hsp 70, and it increases about 5-fold the rate of dissociation of hsp 70·ADP in the presence of ATP. This process represents adenine nucleotide exchange, since dissociation of ADP does not occur unless ATP is added; dATP, GTP, and ITP cannot substitute for ATP. The mechanism of action of RF-hsp 70 is to lower the KD of hsp 70 for ATP about 6-7-fold to a value that is close to the KD of hsp 70 for ADP. RF-hsp 70 also stimulates the ATPase activity of hsp 70, including the 42-kDa amino-terminal portion of hsp 70 generated by chymotrypsin, demonstrating that RF-hsp 70 interacts with that part of hsp 70 known to contain the ATP/ADP binding site. Confirming its recycling function, RF-hsp 70 stimulates about 7-10-fold the ability of hsp 70 to reactivate heat-denatured firefly luciferase. In addition, RF-hsp 70 acts catalytically to recycle hsp 70, since, at 0.2 times the molar concentration of hsp 70, RF-hsp 70 increases the rate of renaturation of luciferase by hsp 70 about 3-4-fold. The action of RF-hsp 70 is also partially species-specific since it is most effective with rabbit reticulocyte hsp 70, less effective with bovine brain hsp 70, even less effective with human hsp 70, and ineffective with broad bean hsp 70.

A typical example of the former case is microsomal cytochrome P450 (P450), which is synthesized on the rough ER (1Fujii-Kuriyama Y. Negishi M. Mikawa R. Tashiro Y. J. Cell Biol. 1979; 81: 510-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), and inserted into and anchored to the ER membrane by its amino-terminal hydrophobic sequence (2Bar-Nun S. Kreibich G. Adesnik M. Alterman L. Negishi M. Sabatini D.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 965-969Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Thus, the hydrophobic sequence functions not only as an uncleavable signal sequence for signal recognition particle-dependent insertion into the ER membrane but also as a stop-transfer signal (3Sakaguchi M. Mihara K. Sato R. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 2425-2431Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 4Monier S. Van Luc P. Kreibich G. Sabatini D.D. Adesnik M. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 457-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Recent studies have shown that the hydrophobic domain of P450 spans the ER membrane and that the amino terminus is luminally oriented (5Szczesna-Skorupa E. Kemper B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1757-1762Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Shimozawa O. Sakaguchi M. Ogawa H. Harada N. Mihara K. Omura T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21399-21402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).On the other hand, microsomal aldehyde dehydrogenase (msALDH) has no amino-terminal signal/anchor sequence (7Miyauchi K. Masaki R. Taketani S. Yamamoto A. Akayama M. Tashiro Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19536-19542Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and is synthesized on free ribosomes (8Takagi Y. Ito A. Omura T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1985; 98: 1647-1652Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). This protein has a hydrophobic sequence at its carboxyl terminus (7Miyauchi K. Masaki R. Taketani S. Yamamoto A. Akayama M. Tashiro Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19536-19542Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (see Fig. 1) which functions as a membrane anchor (9Masaki R. Yamamoto A. Tashiro Y. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 1407-1420Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Recently, we showed that two hydrophilic sequences, one on both sides of the membrane binding domain at the carboxyl terminus (see Fig. 1), play important roles in ER targeting (9Masaki R. Yamamoto A. Tashiro Y. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 1407-1420Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Thus, msALDH is post-translationally inserted into the ER membrane, and most of the molecular portion is exposed to the cytoplasm (8Takagi Y. Ito A. Omura T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1985; 98: 1647-1652Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 9Masaki R. Yamamoto A. Tashiro Y. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 1407-1420Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). However, it remains to be determined whether the carboxyl terminus of msALDH is located in the luminal side of the ER (a transmembrane structure) or is oriented toward the cytoplasm (a hairpin loop structure). Elucidation of the membrane topology of msALDH is important for understanding the mechanism of post-translational insertion of tail-anchored proteins.Another unresolved question is how msALDH is retained in the ER. Recent studies have shown that a Lys-Asp-Glu-Leu (KDEL) sequence in soluble luminal ER proteins and a carboxyl-terminal sequence of Lys-Lys-X-X (KKXX) or Lys-X-Lys-X-X (KXKXX) in integral ER membrane proteins function as retrieval signals for the transport of these proteins back to the ER from the intermediate compartment (10Pelham H.R.B. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 913-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 11Lewis M.J. Pelham H.R.B. Cell. 1992; 68: 353-364Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar, 12Jackson M.R. Nilsson T. Peterson P.A. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 317-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). In contrast, P450 seems to be retained in the ER without recycling through the intermediate compartment (5Szczesna-Skorupa E. Kemper B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1757-1762Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Yamamoto A. Masaki R. Tashiro Y. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 101: 1733-1740Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 14Murakami K. Mihara K. Omura T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1994; 116: 164-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). However, nothing is known about the mechanism of ER retention of msALDH.In this study, we have examined the membrane topology and the ER retention of msALDH by adding potential glycosylation sites to the carboxyl terminus of this protein. The resulting chimeric proteins were glycosylated in transfected COS cells, supporting the transmembrane structure of the carboxyl terminus of msALDH. In addition, the sensitivity of the carbohydrate chain to endoglycosidases and glycosidase in addition to immunofluorescence microscopic data suggest that this protein is retained in the ER without recycling between the ER-Golgi compartments.DISCUSSIONNative or artificially introduced N-glycosylation has been used to determine the membrane topology of proteins, especially those with multiple membrane-spanning domains (25Michikawa T. Hamanaka H. Otsu H. Yamamoto A. Miyawaki A. Furuichi T. Tashiro Y. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9184-9189Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). By taking advantage of this strategy, we have shown here that the carboxyl-terminal membrane binding domain of msALDH spans the phospholipid bilayer and that the carboxyl terminus is located in the luminal side of the ER. We have also demonstrated that the efficiency of glycosylation depends on the distance between the N-glycosylation site and the membrane anchor. Asn-488, located at a distance of 8 amino acids from the membrane anchor, was not glycosylated, whereas asparagine located at a distance of 13 or 21 was glycosylated. These data suggest that Asn-488 is too close to the membrane to be glycosylated by the oligosaccharyltransferase, which is composed of ribophorins I and II and a third 48-kDa protein (26Kelleher D.J. Kreibich G. Gilmore R. Cell. 1992; 69: 55-65Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). This result is in agreement with that obtained by Nilsson and von Heijne (27Nilsson I. von Heijne G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5798-5801Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), who showed that the N-glycosylation site should be at least 12-14 amino acids away from the membrane anchor by in vitro transcription/translation of model proteins in the presence of rough microsomes. Since msALDH is post-translationally targeted by the ER-targeting sequences located on either side of the carboxyl-terminal membrane binding domain and inserted into the ER (9Masaki R. Yamamoto A. Tashiro Y. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 1407-1420Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), it is noteworthy that N-glycosylation takes place not only cotranslationally during the translocation of nascent polypeptides but also post-translationally after insertion of the carboxyl-terminal hydrophobic domain of ALDH/OP chimeras into the ER membrane.Recent studies have shown that the carboxyl termini of two tail-anchored proteins, microsomal cytochrome b5 (28Vergères G. Ramsden J. Waskell L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3414-3422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) and synaptobrevin (29Kutay U. Ahnert-Hilger G. Hartmann E. Wiedenmann B. Rapoport T.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 217-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar), exhibit a luminal orientation. After insertion into the ER membrane in a signal recognition particle- and Sec61-independent fashion, synaptobrevin is transported to synaptic-like vesicles through the Golgi apparatus in PC12 cells (29Kutay U. Ahnert-Hilger G. Hartmann E. Wiedenmann B. Rapoport T.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 217-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Additionally, we have shown that HPC-1/syntaxin 1A (30Inoue A. Obata K. Akagawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10613-10619Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) is transported to the plasma membrane after post-translational insertion into the ER through the carboxyl-terminal hydrophobic domain and that this protein has a similar membrane topology. 2R. Masaki, A. Yamamoto, K. Akagawa, and Y. Tashiro, manuscript in preparation. Although the transmembrane topology of only the four tail-anchored proteins has been clarified at present, it appears that most tail-anchored proteins have a similar topology. Fig. 6 shows the alignment of the carboxyl-terminal sequences of six tail-anchored proteins, including the four proteins described above. Since the hydrophobic domains of these proteins differ in length (16-23 amino acids) and the composition of hydrophobic amino acids, it is less likely that these domains are important determinants for the transmembrane topology. Probably, they function as targeting or retention signals to localize to their final destinations after insertion into the ER membrane. Similarly, the carboxyl termini of these proteins exhibit no common feature. Cytochrome b5 (31Ozols J. Heinemann F.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 704: 163-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), msALDH (7Miyauchi K. Masaki R. Taketani S. Yamamoto A. Akayama M. Tashiro Y. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4095-4104Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar) have charged residues, whereas the other three proteins do not. On the contrary, positively charged residues are commonly located on the amino-terminal side of the hydrophobic domain with the exception in cytochrome b5, suggesting the important role of positively charged residues in the translocation of the hydrophobic domains across the ER membrane. This agrees with the positive inside rule (33von Heijne G. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 3021-3027Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which states that positively charged residues are preferentially found on the cytoplasmic sides of membrane proteins. However, the detail mechanism for the targeting of tail-anchored proteins to the ER and for integration of the carboxyl-terminal hydrophobic domains into the ER membrane remains to be resolved.Fig. 6Carboxyl-terminal sequences of tail-anchored proteins.

The carboxyl-terminal KDEL sequence of luminal ER proteins functions as a retrieval signal from the intermediate compartment to the ER (10Pelham H.R.B. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 913-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 11Lewis M.J. Pelham H.R.B. Cell. 1992; 68: 353-364Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). In addition, the di-lysine motif (KKXX or KXKXX) on the cytoplasmic side of some ER membrane proteins also serves as a retrieval signal (12Jackson M.R. Nilsson T. Peterson P.A. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 317-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the ER retention signal of P450 has been defined. P450 is inserted into the ER membrane by its amino-terminal signal/anchor sequence (2Bar-Nun S. Kreibich G. Adesnik M. Alterman L. Negishi M. Sabatini D.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 965-969Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 3Sakaguchi M. Mihara K. Sato R. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 2425-2431Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 4Monier S. Van Luc P. Kreibich G. Sabatini D.D. Adesnik M. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 457-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), which also functions as an ER retention signal (14Murakami K. Mihara K. Omura T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1994; 116: 164-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 34Ahn K. Szczesna-Skorupa E. Kemper B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18726-18733Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, recent studies have shown that the cytoplasmic and amino-terminal transmembrane domains of P450 contain independent redundant signals for retention in the ER (35Szczesna-Skorupa E. Ahn K. Chen C.-D. Doray B. Kemper B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24327-24333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) and that P450 is retained in the ER without recycling through the intermediate or the cis Golgi compartment (5Szczesna-Skorupa E. Kemper B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1757-1762Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Yamamoto A. Masaki R. Tashiro Y. J.

In this study, N-glycosylation of ALDH/OP chimeras provided a powerful tool for determining the mechanism for their ER localization. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on the ER retention of a tail-anchored protein. The carbohydrate chain of ALDH/OP3 was sensitive to endo H but insensitive to endo D, suggesting strongly that this chimera does not reach the cis Golgi. The ER retention of the chimera was checked further by treatment of transfected COS cells with brefeldin A, which effectively blocks membrane transport out of but not back to the ER (24Lippincott-Schwartz J. Yuan L.C. Bonifacino J.S. Klausner R.D. Cell. 1989; 56: 801-813Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1306) Google Scholar). We have shown here that the carbohydrate chain of ALDH/OP3 is processed to an endo H-resistant form by cis/medial Golgi enzymes redistributed in the ER as a result of brefeldin A treatment. These biochemical results are consistent with morphological observations. Recently, we found that overexpression of msALDH in COS cells induced the formation of crystalloid ER (20Yamamoto A. Masaki R. Tashiro Y. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 1727-1738Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), an aggregate of the smooth ER in a regular array. In addition, we showed that the smooth ER proliferated from the rough ER was transformed to the crystalloid ER and that the bulky cytoplasmic domain of msALDH was necessary for the formation of the crystalloid ER. By indirect immunofluorescence microscopy, we have shown here that ALDH/OP chimeras also form the crystalloid ER. Taken together, it appears that msALDH is retained in the ER through the blockading of the exit from the ER and that the smooth ER is assembled into the crystalloid ER through head-to-head association between the cytoplasmic domains of msALDH overexpressed on opposing membranes.In summary, we have found that msALDH has a transmembrane topology and suggest that this protein is retained in the ER without recycling between the ER and the intermediate and cis Golgi compartments. Further investigation is required to elucidate the mechanisms for post-translational integration into the ER and for retention of msALDH in the ER.

A typical example of the former case is microsomal cytochrome P450 (P450), which is synthesized on the rough ER (1Fujii-Kuriyama Y. Negishi M. Mikawa R. Tashiro Y. J. Cell Biol. 1979; 81: 510-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), and inserted into and anchored to the ER membrane by its amino-terminal hydrophobic sequence (2Bar-Nun S. Kreibich G. Adesnik M. Alterman L. Negishi M. Sabatini D.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 965-969Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Thus, the hydrophobic sequence functions not only as an uncleavable signal sequence for signal recognition particle-dependent insertion into the ER membrane but also as a stop-transfer signal (3Sakaguchi M. Mihara K. Sato R. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 2425-2431Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 4Monier S. Van Luc P. Kreibich G. Sabatini D.D. Adesnik M. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 457-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Recent studies have shown that the hydrophobic domain of P450 spans the ER membrane and that the amino terminus is luminally oriented (5Szczesna-Skorupa E. Kemper B. J. Biol.

Chem. 1993; 268: 21399-21402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).On the other hand, microsomal aldehyde dehydrogenase (msALDH) has no amino-terminal signal/anchor sequence (7Miyauchi K. Masaki R. Taketani S. Yamamoto A. Akayama M. Tashiro Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19536-19542Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and is synthesized on free ribosomes (8Takagi Y. Ito A. Omura T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1985; 98: 1647-1652Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). This protein has a hydrophobic sequence at its carboxyl terminus (7Miyauchi K. Masaki R. Taketani S. Yamamoto A. Akayama M. Tashiro Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19536-19542Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (see Fig. 1) which functions as a membrane anchor (9Masaki R. Yamamoto A. Tashiro Y. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 1407-1420Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Recently, we showed that two hydrophilic sequences, one on both sides of the membrane binding domain at the carboxyl terminus (see Fig. 1), play important roles in ER targeting (9Masaki R. Yamamoto A. Tashiro Y. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 1407-1420Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Thus, msALDH is post-translationally inserted into the ER membrane, and most of the molecular portion is exposed to the cytoplasm (8Takagi Y. Ito A. Omura T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1985; 98: 1647-1652Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 9Masaki R. Yamamoto A. Tashiro Y. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 1407-1420Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). However, it remains to be determined whether the carboxyl terminus of msALDH is located in the luminal side of the ER (a transmembrane structure) or is oriented toward the cytoplasm (a hairpin loop structure). Elucidation of the membrane topology of msALDH is important for understanding the mechanism of post-translational insertion of tail-anchored proteins.Another unresolved question is how msALDH is retained in the ER. Recent studies have shown that a Lys-Asp-Glu-Leu (KDEL) sequence in soluble luminal ER proteins and a carboxyl-terminal sequence of Lys-Lys-X-X (KKXX) or Lys-X-Lys-X-X (KXKXX) in integral ER membrane proteins function as retrieval signals for the transport of these proteins back to the ER from the intermediate compartment (10Pelham H.R.B. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 913-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 11Lewis M.J. Pelham H.R.B. Cell. 1992; 68: 353-364Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar, 12Jackson M.R.

DISCUSSIONNative or artificially introduced N-glycosylation has been used to determine the membrane topology of proteins, especially those with multiple membrane-spanning domains (25Michikawa T. Hamanaka H. Otsu H. Yamamoto A. Miyawaki A. Furuichi T. Tashiro Y. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9184-9189Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). By taking advantage of this strategy, we have shown here that the carboxyl-terminal membrane binding domain of msALDH spans the phospholipid bilayer and that the carboxyl terminus is located in the luminal side of the ER. We have also demonstrated that the efficiency of glycosylation depends on the distance between the N-glycosylation site and the membrane anchor. Asn-488, located at a distance of 8 amino acids from the membrane anchor, was not glycosylated, whereas asparagine located at a distance of 13 or 21 was glycosylated. These data suggest that Asn-488 is too close to the membrane to be glycosylated by the oligosaccharyltransferase, which is composed of ribophorins I and II and a third 48-kDa protein (26Kelleher D.J. Kreibich G. Gilmore R. Cell. 1992; 69: 55-65Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). This result is in agreement with that obtained by Nilsson and von Heijne (27Nilsson I. von Heijne G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5798-5801Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), who showed that the N-glycosylation site should be at least 12-14 amino acids away from the membrane anchor by in vitro transcription/translation of model proteins in the presence of rough microsomes. Since msALDH is post-translationally targeted by the ER-targeting sequences located on either side of the carboxyl-terminal membrane binding domain and inserted into the ER (9Masaki R. Yamamoto A. Tashiro Y. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 1407-1420Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), it is noteworthy that N-glycosylation takes place not only cotranslationally during the translocation of nascent polypeptides but also post-translationally after insertion of the carboxyl-terminal hydrophobic domain of ALDH/OP chimeras into the ER membrane.Recent studies have shown that the carboxyl termini of two tail-anchored proteins, microsomal cytochrome b5 (28Vergères G. Ramsden J. Waskell L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3414-3422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) and synaptobrevin (29Kutay U. Ahnert-Hilger G. Hartmann E. Wiedenmann B. Rapoport T.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 217-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar), exhibit a luminal orientation. After insertion into the ER membrane in a signal recognition particle- and Sec61-independent fashion, synaptobrevin is transported to synaptic-like vesicles through the Golgi apparatus in PC12 cells (29Kutay U. Ahnert-Hilger G. Hartmann E. Wiedenmann B. Rapoport T.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 217-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Additionally, we have shown that HPC-1/syntaxin 1A (30Inoue A. Obata K. Akagawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10613-10619Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) is transported to the plasma membrane after post-translational insertion into the ER through the carboxyl-terminal hydrophobic domain and that this protein has a similar membrane topology. 2R. Masaki, A. Yamamoto, K. Akagawa, and Y. Tashiro, manuscript in preparation. Although the transmembrane topology of only the four tail-anchored proteins has been clarified at present, it appears that most tail-anchored proteins have a similar topology. Fig. 6 shows the alignment of the carboxyl-terminal sequences of six tail-anchored proteins, including the four proteins described above. Since the hydrophobic domains of these proteins differ in length (16-23 amino acids) and the composition of hydrophobic amino acids, it is less likely that these domains are important determinants for the transmembrane topology. Probably, they function as targeting or retention signals to localize to their final destinations after insertion into the ER membrane. Similarly, the carboxyl termini of these proteins exhibit no common feature. Cytochrome b5 (31Ozols J. Heinemann F.S. Biochim. Biophys.

Chem. 1991; 266: 19536-19542Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and SSO1 (32Aalto M.K. Ronne H. Keränen S. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4095-4104Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar) have charged residues, whereas the other three proteins do not. On the contrary, positively charged residues are commonly located on the amino-terminal side of the hydrophobic domain with the exception in cytochrome b5, suggesting the important role of positively charged residues in the translocation of the hydrophobic domains across the ER membrane. This agrees with the positive inside rule (33von Heijne G. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 3021-3027Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which states that positively charged residues are preferentially found on the cytoplasmic sides of membrane proteins. However, the detail mechanism for the targeting of tail-anchored proteins to the ER and for integration of the carboxyl-terminal hydrophobic domains into the ER membrane remains to be resolved.It is widely accepted that there are two mechanisms for the localization of ER resident proteins; one is the retrieval mechanism from the intermediate compartment, and the other is the retention mechanism, that is, the blockading of exit from the ER. The carboxyl-terminal KDEL sequence of luminal ER proteins functions as a retrieval signal from the intermediate compartment to the ER (10Pelham H.R.B. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 913-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 11Lewis M.J. Pelham H.R.B. Cell. 1992; 68: 353-364Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). In addition, the di-lysine motif (KKXX or KXKXX) on the cytoplasmic side of some ER membrane proteins also serves as a retrieval signal (12Jackson M.R. Nilsson T. Peterson P.A. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 317-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the ER retention signal of P450 has been defined. P450 is inserted into the ER membrane by its amino-terminal signal/anchor sequence (2Bar-Nun S. Kreibich G. Adesnik M. Alterman L. Negishi M. Sabatini D.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Kreibich G. Sabatini D.D. Adesnik M. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 457-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), which also functions as an ER retention signal (14Murakami K. Mihara K. Omura T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1994; 116: 164-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 34Ahn K. Szczesna-Skorupa E. Kemper B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18726-18733Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, recent studies have shown that the cytoplasmic and amino-terminal transmembrane domains of P450 contain independent redundant signals for retention in the ER (35Szczesna-Skorupa E. Ahn K. Chen C.-D. Doray B. Kemper B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24327-24333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) and that P450 is retained in the ER without recycling through the intermediate or the cis Golgi compartment (5Szczesna-Skorupa E. Kemper B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1757-1762Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Yamamoto A. Masaki R. Tashiro Y. J.

In this study, N-glycosylation of ALDH/OP chimeras provided a powerful tool for determining the mechanism for their ER localization. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on the ER retention of a tail-anchored protein. The carbohydrate chain of ALDH/OP3 was sensitive to endo H but insensitive to endo D, suggesting strongly that this chimera does not reach the cis Golgi. The ER retention of the chimera was checked further by treatment of transfected COS cells with brefeldin A, which effectively blocks membrane transport out of but not back to the ER (24Lippincott-Schwartz J. Yuan L.C. Bonifacino J.S. Klausner R.D. Cell. 1989; 56: 801-813Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1306) Google Scholar). We have shown here that the carbohydrate chain of ALDH/OP3 is processed to an endo H-resistant form by cis/medial Golgi enzymes redistributed in the ER as a result of brefeldin A treatment. These biochemical results are consistent with morphological observations. Recently, we found that overexpression of msALDH in COS cells induced the formation of crystalloid ER (20Yamamoto A. Masaki R. Tashiro Y. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 1727-1738Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), an aggregate of the smooth ER in a regular array. In addition, we showed that the smooth ER proliferated from the rough ER was transformed to the crystalloid ER and that the bulky cytoplasmic domain of msALDH was necessary for the formation of the crystalloid ER. By indirect immunofluorescence microscopy, we have shown here that ALDH/OP chimeras also form the crystalloid ER. Taken together, it appears that msALDH is retained in the ER through the blockading of the exit from the ER and that the smooth ER is assembled into the crystalloid ER through head-to-head association between the cytoplasmic domains of msALDH overexpressed on opposing membranes.In summary, we have found that msALDH has a transmembrane topology and suggest that this protein is retained in the ER without recycling between the ER and the intermediate and cis Golgi compartments. Further investigation is required to elucidate the mechanisms for post-translational integration into the ER and for retention of msALDH in the ER. Native or artificially introduced N-glycosylation has been used to determine the membrane topology of proteins, especially those with multiple membrane-spanning domains (25Michikawa T. Hamanaka H. Otsu H. Yamamoto A. Miyawaki A. Furuichi T. Tashiro Y. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9184-9189Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). By taking advantage of this strategy, we have shown here that the carboxyl-terminal membrane binding domain of msALDH spans the phospholipid bilayer and that the carboxyl terminus is located in the luminal side of the ER. We have also demonstrated that the efficiency of glycosylation depends on the distance between the N-glycosylation site and the membrane anchor. Asn-488, located at a distance of 8 amino acids from the membrane anchor, was not glycosylated, whereas asparagine located at a distance of 13 or 21 was glycosylated. These data suggest that Asn-488 is too close to the membrane to be glycosylated by the oligosaccharyltransferase, which is composed of ribophorins I and II and a third 48-kDa protein (26Kelleher D.J. Kreibich G. Gilmore R. Cell. 1992; 69: 55-65Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). This result is in agreement with that obtained by Nilsson and von Heijne (27Nilsson I. von Heijne G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5798-5801Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), who showed that the N-glycosylation site should be at least 12-14 amino acids away from the membrane anchor by in vitro transcription/translation of model proteins in the presence of rough microsomes. Since msALDH is post-translationally targeted by the ER-targeting sequences located on either side of the carboxyl-terminal membrane binding domain and inserted into the ER (9Masaki R. Yamamoto A. Tashiro Y. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 1407-1420Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), it is noteworthy that N-glycosylation takes place not only cotranslationally during the translocation of nascent polypeptides but also post-translationally after insertion of the carboxyl-terminal hydrophobic domain of ALDH/OP chimeras into the ER membrane. Recent studies have shown that the carboxyl termini of two tail-anchored proteins, microsomal cytochrome b5 (28Vergères G. Ramsden J. Waskell L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3414-3422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) and synaptobrevin (29Kutay U. Ahnert-Hilger G. Hartmann E. Wiedenmann B. Rapoport T.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 217-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar), exhibit a luminal orientation. After insertion into the ER membrane in a signal recognition particle- and Sec61-independent fashion, synaptobrevin is transported to synaptic-like vesicles through the Golgi apparatus in PC12 cells (29Kutay U. Ahnert-Hilger G. Hartmann E. Wiedenmann B. Rapoport T.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 217-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Additionally, we have shown that HPC-1/syntaxin 1A (30Inoue A. Obata K. Akagawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10613-10619Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) is transported to the plasma membrane after post-translational insertion into the ER through the carboxyl-terminal hydrophobic domain and that this protein has a similar membrane topology. 2R. Masaki, A. Yamamoto, K. Akagawa, and Y. Tashiro, manuscript in preparation. Although the transmembrane topology of only the four tail-anchored proteins has been clarified at present, it appears that most tail-anchored proteins have a similar topology. Fig. 6 shows the alignment of the carboxyl-terminal sequences of six tail-anchored proteins, including the four proteins described above. Since the hydrophobic domains of these proteins differ in length (16-23 amino acids) and the composition of hydrophobic amino acids, it is less likely that these domains are important determinants for the transmembrane topology. Probably, they function as targeting or retention signals to localize to their final destinations after insertion into the ER membrane. Similarly, the carboxyl termini of these proteins exhibit no common feature. Cytochrome b5 (31Ozols J. Heinemann F.S. Biochim. Biophys.

Expression of slow MyHC 3 in skeletal muscle is restricted to the embryonic period of development, when the fiber pattern of future fast and slow muscle is established. In embryonic hindlimb development, slow MyHC 3 gene expression coincides with slow muscle fiber formation as distinguished by slow MyHC-specific antibody staining. In addition to expression in embryonic appendicular muscle, slow MyHC 3 is expressed continuously in the atria. Transfection of slow MyHC 3 promoter-reporter constructs into embryonic myoblasts that form slow MyHC-expressing fibers identified two regions regulating expression of this gene in skeletal muscle. The proximal promoter, containing potential muscle-specific regulatory motifs, permits expression of a reporter gene in embryonic slow muscle fibers, while a distal element, located greater than 2600 base pairs upstream, further enhances expression 3-fold. The slow muscle fiber-restricted expression of slow MyHC 3 during embryonic development, and expression of slow MyHC 3 promoter-reporter constructs in embryonic muscle fibers in vitro, makes this gene a useful marker to study the mechanism establishing the slow fiber lineage in the embryo.

The expression of specific MyHC isoform(s) within individual muscle fibers is primarily responsible for the rate of fiber contraction, and, for convenience, each member of the MyHC family can be assigned to either a fast or a slow class based on expression in either fast or slow contracting muscle fibers. Multiple MyHC isoforms of either the fast or slow class can be coexpressed within a single muscle fiber, and some fibers coexpress isoforms of both classes (2Reiser P.J. Greaser M.L. Moss R.L. Dev.

Once formed, skeletal muscle fibers may undergo a process of modulation, whereby extrinsic factors such as innervation and hormones affect changes in the MyHC isoforms expressed (26Stockdale F.E.

In both avian and mammalian limbs, this pattern can be discerned early during myogenesis by the differential expression of slow MyHC isoforms in a subset of primary muscle fibers (3Miller J.B.

Based on immunopeptide mapping, the isoform designated slow MyHC 3 is the principle slow MyHC isoform expressed in slow embryonic muscle fibers of the embryonic chick limb (20Page S. Miller J.B.

In the limb, expression of slow MyHC 3 is largely restricted to the embryonic stage of myogenesis. As development proceeds, slow MyHC 3 is down-regulated and is replaced by the slow MyHC 1 and 2 isoforms in adult slow skeletal fibers (19Kennedy J.M. Kamel S. Tambone W.W. Vrbova G. Zak R. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 977-983Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Similar slow MyHC isoform transitions may occur in mammalian muscle fibers that initially express the β-cardiac/slow gene (16Hughes S.M. Cho M. Karsch-Mizrachi I. Travis M. Silberstein L. Leinwand L.A. Blau H.M. Dev. Biol. 1993; 158: 183-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Thus, expression of slow MyHC 3 marks commitment of embryonic myoblasts to formation of the slow muscle fiber lineage, and an understanding of the regulation of slow MyHC 3 in the slow-fiber subset of embryonic muscle cells may provide an insight into the mechanism(s) that establishes fiber type patterning in the limbs.We have isolated and sequenced overlapping cDNA clones encoding the complete quail slow MyHC 3 message. From cDNA sequence, isoform-specific probes were used to isolate genomic clones comprising the entire slow MyHC 3 gene which was sequenced in its entirety, including greater than 2.5 kb of DNA upstream of the transcription initiation site. Northern analysis and in situ hybridization demonstrate that expression of slow MyHC 3 in developing limb muscle occurs only during the stages of development when the pattern of slow MyHC expression is established and when distinctions between the fast and slow muscle fibers first become apparent. Similar to mammalian β-cardiac/slow MyHC, quail slow MyHC 3 is also expressed in cardiac as well as slow skeletal muscle. In heart development, slow MyHC 3 is expressed initially in both the atria and ventricles, but as development proceeds, expression becomes restricted to the atria. 2Wang, G. F., Nikovits, W., Schleinitz, M., and Stockdale, F. E. (1996) J. Biol. Chem. 271, in press We have identified a region of the slow MyHC 3 promoter, capable of directing muscle-specific expression in slow MyHC-expressing myotubes following transfection into embryonic quail myoblast cultures, which provides a means of dissecting the mechanism(s) that leads to a commitment of cells to the slow muscle cell lineage.DISCUSSIONA family of myosin heavy chain genes have been identified in mammalian (7Parker-Thornburg J.

The expression of different members of this family has been shown to be regulated in developmental stage-specific (5Crow M.T. Stockdale F.E. Dev.

Science. 1986; 231: 597-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar) fashion. In avian skeletal muscle, three MyHC proteins of the slow class can be distinguished by differences in electrophoretic mobility, peptide maps, and reactivity with monoclonal antibodies (5Crow M.T. Stockdale F.E. Dev. Biol. 1986; 113: 238-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 18Matsuda R. Bandman E. Strohman R.C.

Two of the slow MyHC isoforms, slow MyHC 1 and 2, are found in adult slow skeletal fibers (18Matsuda R. Bandman E. Strohman R.C. Differentiation. 1982; 23: 36-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 54Hoh J.F.Y. FEBS Lett. 1979; 98: 267-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The third, slow MyHC 3, was detected during the earliest stages of myogenesis in limb muscle (20Page S. Miller J.B. DiMario J.X. Hager E.J. Moser A. Stockdale F.E. Dev. Biol. 1992; 154: 118-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), and in atrial muscle throughout development (20Page S. Miller J.B. DiMario J.X. Hager E.J. Moser A. Stockdale F.E. Dev. Biol. 1992; 154: 118-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 52Evans D. Miller J.B. Stockdale F.E. Dev. Biol. 1988; 127: 376-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). This pattern of expression was reproduced by Northern blot analysis using 3′ untranslated sequence of a quail MyHC cDNA as a probe (Fig. 4). The probe does not hybridize with RNA isolated from the early post-hatch anterior latissimus dorsi muscle, a slow skeletal muscle expressing slow MyHC 1 and 2 in roughly equal proportions (19Kennedy J.M. Kamel S. Tambone W.W. Vrbova G. Zak R. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 977-983Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), nor does it hybridize to RNA from adult pectoralis, a fast fiber muscle (data not shown). Thus, the concordance in the spatial and temporal patterns of expression support the conclusion that the MyHC gene reported here encodes the previously identified slow MyHC 3 protein (20Page S. Miller J.B. DiMario J.X. Hager E.J. Moser A. Stockdale F.E. Dev. Biol. 1992; 154: 118-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). We believe that slow MyHC 3 is the first avian slow MyHC gene sequenced, and that investigation of the regulation of its expression may provide information on the origin of the slow skeletal muscle cell lineage.Organization of the Quail Slow MyHC 3 GeneBy comparing cDNA and genomic DNA nucleotide sequences, the exon/intron organization of the slow MyHC 3 gene was determined to consist of 40 exons spanning approximately 16 kb of genomic DNA. The first two exons are untranslated, with the putative ATG methionine initiator codon beginning the sequence of exon 3. The last exon of the slow MyHC 3 gene encodes six amino acids plus approximately 100 base pairs of 3′-untranslated sequence.Nucleotide sequence comparison between slow MyHC 3 and MyHC genes in the GenBank/EBI data bases showed that slow MyHC 3 is more closely related to mammalian α-cardiac and β-cardiac/slow isoforms then to the chicken embryonic fast skeletal MyHC, an isoform also expressed during primary fiber formation (6Crow M.T. Stockdale F.E. Dev. Biol. 1986; 118: 333-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 55Gulick J. Kropp K. Robbins J. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1987; 169: 79-84Google Scholar). Consistent with previous results based on more limited sequence (38Yutzey K.E. Rhee J.T. Bader D. Development. 1994; 120: 871-883Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), nucleotide sequence comparison does not resolve whether quail slow MyHC 3 is more likely to be an avian homologue of one or the other mammalian cardiac MyHC genes. Like the α-cardiac MyHC (56Lyons G.E. Schiaffino S. Sassoon D. Barton P. Buckingham M. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 2427-2436Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar), the quail gene is expressed at high levels in the atria (Fig. 4B), yet similar to β-cardiac/slow MyHC (28Narusawa M. Fitzsimons R.B. Izumo S. Nadal-Ginard B. Rubinstein N.A. Kelly A.M. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 104: 447-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 57Lompré A.-M. Nadal-Ginard B. Mahdavi V. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 6437-6446Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the quail gene is expressed in slow skeletal muscles (Figs. 4C and 6A).The greatest divergence among MyHC proteins is found in the amino termini, and quail slow MyHC 3 amino acid sequence in this region is strikingly different from both avian fast MyHC and mammalian β-cardiac/slow MyHC isoforms (Fig. 3B). Unambiguous nucleotide sequence, obtained from both cDNA and genomic DNA clones, suggests that translation of slow MyHC 3 mRNA starts with the methionine codon at the beginning of exon 3. The sequence flanking this putative initiator codon includes both the crucial −3 (A) and +4 (G) nucleotides found in vertebrate mRNAs (58Kozak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 8125-8148Crossref PubMed Scopus (4151) Google Scholar). In contrast, the various avian fast skeletal isoforms show 87-98.5% amino acid homology in this region of the molecule.Regulation of Quail Slow MyHC 3 Gene ExpressionAn examination of sequence in the slow MyHC 3 proximal promoter identified several regions of homology with previously described regulatory elements involved in muscle-specific gene expression. Interestingly, although the 290 bp immediately upstream of the transcription initiation site contains extended homology (10 consecutive nucleotides) to a region (βe2) essential for skeletal and cardiac muscle cell-specific expression of β-cardiac/slow MyHC genes (40Thompson W.R. Nadal-Ginard B. Mahdavi V. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22678-22688Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 41Flink I.L. Edwards J.G. Bahl J.J. Liew C.-C. Sole M. Morkin E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9917-9924Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and significant homology with an essential MEF-2/MHox element in the mouse α-cardiac MyHC promoter (59Adolph E.A. Subramaniam A. Cserjesi P. Olson E.N. Robbins J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5349-5352Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), this portion of the slow MyHC 3 promoter permits expression of a CAT reporter gene at a low but significant level in fibroblast cells. Transfections of the SM3CAT-290 construct, showed less than 5-fold difference in the level of CAT expression between cardiac myocyte and fibroblast cell cultures,2 and only an 8-fold difference between embryonic skeletal muscle and fibroblast cell cultures (Fig. 7B).A substantial (40-fold) difference in expression between skeletal muscle and fibroblast cells is observed when an additional 390 base pairs of the slow MyHC 3 promoter are included in the SM3CAT-680 construct. This region of the promoter contains an MEF-3 binding site motif (44Parmacek M.S. Ip H.S. Jung F. Shen T. Martin J.F. Vora A.J. Olson E.N. Leiden J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1870-1885Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), and a consensus N-box motif (45Asakura A. Fujisawa-Sehara A. Komiya T. Nabeshima Y. Nabeshima Y.-I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7153-7162Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), sequences reported to bind factors that may act as transcriptional inhibitors of contractile protein gene expression in non-muscle and myoblast cells (44Parmacek M.S. Ip H.S. Jung F. Shen T. Martin J.F. Vora A.J. Olson E.N. Leiden J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1870-1885Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 45Asakura A. Fujisawa-Sehara A. Komiya T.

Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 2620-2634Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar). Thus, the MEF-3 and N-box motifs may be important elements in restricting expression of slow MyHC 3 to striated muscle. While the sequence between −680 and −290 has no demonstrable effect on expression in embryonic muscle cultures (Fig. 7B), in cardiac muscle cultures this region dramatically reduces expression when compared with a construct containing only 290 bp of the slow MyHC 3 promoter.2 Thus, sequence elements that confer high level expression of the slow MyHC 3 gene in skeletal muscle fibers appear to differ, in part, from those that are required for expression in cardiac muscle cells.Additional sequence, located more than 2.6 kb upstream of the transcription initiation site, further enhances expression of the reporter in skeletal muscle cultures (Fig. 7, SM3CAT-4500 construct). Experiments in transgenic mice have demonstrated the importance of genomic sequence located many kilobase pairs distal to the transcription initiation site for muscle-specific expression of the mouse α-cardiac MyHC gene (61Subramaniam Jones W.K. Gulick J. Wert S. Neumann J. Robbins J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24613-24620Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Developmental Expression of MyHC GenesDuring skeletal muscle development, a series of MyHC isoform transitions occur in which one member of the family is replaced by another. Although there is no single pattern, sequential expression of different fast MyHC isoforms has been described for all fast muscles (5Crow M.T. Stockdale F.E. Dev. Biol. 1986; 113: 238-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 21Bandman E. Matsuda R. Strohman R.C. Dev. Biol. 1982; 93: 508-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 54Hoh J.F.Y. FEBS Lett. 1979; 98: 267-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In birds, a series of transitions in the expression of the three currently recognized slow MyHC isoforms have also been documented (5Crow M.T. Stockdale F.E. Dev. Biol. 1986; 113: 238-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 20Page S. Miller J.B. DiMario J.X. Hager E.J. Moser A. Stockdale F.E. Dev. Biol. 1992; 154: 118-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 54Hoh J.F.Y. FEBS Lett. 1979; 98: 267-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Furthermore, recent studies suggest that mammals may also express multiple slow MyHC isoforms, and that transitions may occur among various isoforms during development (16Hughes S.M. Cho M. Karsch-Mizrachi I. Travis M. Silberstein L. Leinwand L.A. Blau H.M. Dev. Biol. 1993; 158: 183-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). A previous study of slow MyHC protein isoforms present in the early avian limb (20Page S. Miller J.B. DiMario J.X. Hager E.J. Moser A. Stockdale F.E. Dev. Biol. 1992; 154: 118-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), as well as results on RNA accumulation presented here (Fig. 5A), establish slow MyHC 3 as the first slow MyHC isoform expressed in limb muscles. An analysis of the time course of slow MyHC 3 expression showed a peak at around ED10, coincident with the period of maximal primary skeletal muscle fiber formation in the developing hindlimb musculature.In vitro analyses have shown that the fast and slow muscle phenotypes present in developing avian limbs arise from two distinct populations of embryonic myoblasts: those that form fibers expressing slow MyHC isoforms and those that do not (22Schafer D.A. Miller J.B. Stockdale F.E. Cell. 1987; 48: 659-670Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 23DiMario J.X. Fernyak S.E. Stockdale F.E. Nature. 1993; 362: 165-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 24Miller R.B. Stockdale F.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 3860-3864Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Clonal populations of embryonic myoblasts, when allowed to differentiate, give rise to homogeneous colonies in which every muscle fiber either does or does not express a slow MyHC isoform. Furthermore, when cloned embryonic myoblasts are injected into embryonic limb buds, the introduced cells form a single fiber type regardless of their final position in slow or fast muscle (23DiMario J.X. Fernyak S.E. Stockdale F.E. Nature. 1993; 362: 165-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar).Immunohistological staining of early hindlimb muscle with mAb S58 (5Crow M.T. Stockdale F.E. Dev. Biol. 1986; 113: 238-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar), Northern blot analysis using a slow MyHC 3-specific nucleic acid probe (Fig. 4), and in situ hybridization (Fig. 6A) provide evidence that slow MyHC 3 expression in the embryonic hindlimb is limited to regions that in the adult contain slow muscle fibers. Secondary muscle fibers, which form from the second, or fetal myoblast population, emerging during the fetal phase of muscle development (ED10 to hatching), express predominately fast MyHC isoforms (24Miller R.B. Stockdale F.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 3860-3864Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). During fetal development, expression of slow MyHC 3 in the hindlimb rapidly declines as the gene is down-regulated and/or the percentage of the message decreases as a result of an increase in the amount of fast MyHC mRNA produced in newly forming secondary fibers (Fig. 5B). Together these results distinguish slow MyHC 3 as an exceptional genetic marker of commitment to the slow muscle cell lineage during the earliest stage of myogenesis in the limb.Slow MyHC 3 as a Probe for a Slow Myoblast-specific FactorBy using embryonic myoblasts isolated from ED6 hindlimbs in transfection studies, we have attempted to mimic in vitro events occurring in the early embryo. In our culture system, nearly all of the muscle fibers that form express a slow MyHC reactive with mAb S58 (Fig. 8C). Thus, it is not surprising that muscle fibers in this culture setting express slow MyHC 3 promoter-CAT reporter constructs. Double staining of SM3CAT-680-transfected hindlimb cultures with mAb S58 and a polyclonal antibody against CAT (Fig. 8, C and D), demonstrated that cis-elements in the proximal promoter of the slow MyHC 3 gene are sufficient to direct expression of the CAT reporter in embryonic skeletal muscle fibers.Using sequences in the proximal promoter as a probe, we have now begun to search for factors regulating expression of the slow MyHC 3 gene during embryonic fiber formation. The identification of MEF-3 and N-box sequence motifs in a functionally defined region of the gene, and extended homology between slow MyHC 3 and a region (βe2) essential for muscle cell-specific expression of β-cardiac/slow MyHC genes (40Thompson W.R. Nadal-Ginard B. Mahdavi V. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22678-22688Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 41Flink I.L. Edwards J.G. Bahl J.J. Liew C.-C. Sole M. Morkin E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9917-9924Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggest candidates for testing. We believe that an understanding of slow MyHC 3 gene regulation will provide clues to distinguish differences in the myoblast precursors of fast and slow fibers, and thus provide insight into the mechanism by which different muscle cell lineages are established.

The expression of specific MyHC isoform(s) within individual muscle fibers is primarily responsible for the rate of fiber contraction, and, for convenience, each member of the MyHC family can be assigned to either a fast or a slow class based on expression in either fast or slow contracting muscle fibers. Multiple MyHC isoforms of either the fast or slow class can be coexpressed within a single muscle fiber, and some fibers coexpress isoforms of both classes (2Reiser P.J. Greaser M.L. Moss R.L. Dev.

Science. 1986; 231: 597-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar).The pattern of fast and slow fiber type distribution, evident in the anatomical muscles of the adult, is established in the limb when the first fibers, primary fibers, differentiate (5Crow M.T.

In both avian and mammalian limbs, this pattern can be discerned early during myogenesis by the differential expression of slow MyHC isoforms in a subset of primary muscle fibers (3Miller J.B.

Based on immunopeptide mapping, the isoform designated slow MyHC 3 is the principle slow MyHC isoform expressed in slow embryonic muscle fibers of the embryonic chick limb (20Page S. Miller J.B. DiMario J.X. Hager E.J. Moser A. Stockdale F.E. Dev. Biol. 1992; 154: 118-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In the limb, expression of slow MyHC 3 is largely restricted to the embryonic stage of myogenesis. As development proceeds, slow MyHC 3 is down-regulated and is replaced by the slow MyHC 1 and 2 isoforms in adult slow skeletal fibers (19Kennedy J.M. Kamel S. Tambone W.W. Vrbova G. Zak R. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 977-983Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Similar slow MyHC isoform transitions may occur in mammalian muscle fibers that initially express the β-cardiac/slow gene (16Hughes S.M. Cho M. Karsch-Mizrachi I. Travis M. Silberstein L. Leinwand L.A. Blau H.M. Dev. Biol. 1993; 158: 183-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Thus, expression of slow MyHC 3 marks commitment of embryonic myoblasts to formation of the slow muscle fiber lineage, and an understanding of the regulation of slow MyHC 3 in the slow-fiber subset of embryonic muscle cells may provide an insight into the mechanism(s) that establishes fiber type patterning in the limbs.We have isolated and sequenced overlapping cDNA clones encoding the complete quail slow MyHC 3 message. From cDNA sequence, isoform-specific probes were used to isolate genomic clones comprising the entire slow MyHC 3 gene which was sequenced in its entirety, including greater than 2.5 kb of DNA upstream of the transcription initiation site. Northern analysis and in situ hybridization demonstrate that expression of slow MyHC 3 in developing limb muscle occurs only during the stages of development when the pattern of slow MyHC expression is established and when distinctions between the fast and slow muscle fibers first become apparent. Similar to mammalian β-cardiac/slow MyHC, quail slow MyHC 3 is also expressed in cardiac as well as slow skeletal muscle. In heart development, slow MyHC 3 is expressed initially in both the atria and ventricles, but as development proceeds, expression becomes restricted to the atria. 2Wang, G. F., Nikovits, W., Schleinitz, M., and Stockdale, F. E. (1996) J. Biol. Chem. 271, in press We have identified a region of the slow MyHC 3 promoter, capable of directing muscle-specific expression in slow MyHC-expressing myotubes following transfection into embryonic quail myoblast cultures, which provides a means of dissecting the mechanism(s) that leads to a commitment of cells to the slow muscle cell lineage."
https://openalex.org/W2031147894,"We investigated the expression of differential λ light chains in human B cell lines secreting immunoglobulin (Ig). When these cell lines were cultured with concanavalin A for a long period of time, a subpopulation of some but not all of these cell lines was induced to express new λ light chains replacing the original λ chain (light chain shifting). Production of the new λ chain, which replaces the original λ chain, results from a VJ rearrangement at a previously excluded allele and a dramatic reduction of the original λ chain transcript, although no difference was found in the level of heavy chain transcript. Recombination activating genes <i>RAG-1</i> and <i>RAG-2</i>, which are normally expressed during specific early stages of lymphocyte development, were expressed in not only the light chain shifting-inducible lines but also in the non-inducible cells. Treatment of these Ig secreting cell lines with dibutyryl cAMP, which is known to enhance expression of the <i>RAG</i> genes, could not induce the creation of new λ light chain-producing cells from the inducible lines, suggesting that the expression of the two <i>RAG</i> genes is not sufficient for inducing new λ light chain production. Concanavalin A induced a gradual but significant production lost of the original λ chain in a subpopulation of the light chain shifting-inducible cells but not in the non-inducible cells. Association of new λ light chain production with loss of original λ chain raises the possibility that, when the <i>RAG</i> genes are expressed, concanavalin A may act on a novel intracellular mechanism controlling λ light chain allelic exclusion in these plasma cell lines."

However, the dissociation of Grb2 from Sos observed in response to PMA was not apparent upon ΔRaf-1:ER activation. Furthermore, stimulation of ΔRaf-1:ER did not impair GTP loading of p21ras in response to platelet-derived growth factor or epidermal growth factor.

Proline-rich regions in the COOH terminus of Sos bind src homology 3 (SH3) groups present in adaptor proteins such as Grb2, which also contains an src homology 2 (SH2) group.

GTP-loaded p21ras binds to the amino-terminal part of the protein kinase Raf, which is thereby translocated to the plasma membrane where it undergoes an activation process (17Magnusson N.S. Beck T.

EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3136-3145Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). These events initiate the activation of a cascade of protein kinases. Mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK) is apparently directly phosphorylated by Raf, resulting in its activation. MEK in turn stimulates mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) by causing its phosphorylation on a tyrosine and a threonine residue. Whereas the substrate specificities of Raf and MEK are extremely limited, MAPK can phosphorylate a broad spectrum of proteins and has been shown to regulate numerous cellular enzymes such as phospholipase A2, nuclear transcription factors, and other protein kinases (22Denton R.M. Tavare J.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 227: 597-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). An important aspect of the function of p21ras and other intracellular signaling molecules is that their activation is reversible. The activity of p21ras is typically found to peak 2-5 min after growth factor stimulation, and it declines to near basal levels after 20 min. The deactivation mechanism, however, is not well understood. Grb2 in 3T3-L1 adipocytes and CHO-IR cells partially dissociates from Sos after stimulation with insulin or platelet-derived growth factor, which presumably results in disruption of p21ras-activating complexes (23Cherniack A.D.

After stimulation and desensitization of 3T3-L1 adipocytes with epidermal growth factor (EGF), no such dissociation is seen, but p21ras deactivation in this case may be explained by the rapid down-regulation of EGF receptors observed in this system (24Klarlund J.K. Cherniack A.D. Czech M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23421-23428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). As has been noted by several groups, Sos is highly phosphorylated after growth factor stimulation (12Rozakis-Adcock M. Fernley R. Wade J. Pawson T. Bowtell D.

The time course of this phosphorylation suggests a potential role in the deactivation rather than the activation phase of p21ras regulation. A negative feedback role of MAPK in deactivating p21ras is attractive for several reasons. The existence of negative feedback by a downstream kinase is likely in Saccharomyces cerevisiae since the p21ras exchange factor CDC25 is phosphorylated by protein kinase A, and the exchange factor is concomitantly released from the membrane (29Gross E. Goldberg D. Levitzki A. Nature. 1992; 360: 762-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). A large number of consensus sites for MAPK phosphorylation are found in the COOH-terminal region of Sos protein, and we have previously reported that at least two sites are phosphorylated in vitro and in intact cells heterologously expressing Drosophila Sos (30Cherniack A.D. Klarlund J.K. Czech M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4717-4720Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Inhibition of the Raf/MAPK pathway at the level of MEK either by a cell-permeable inhibitor or by a dominant negative mutant of MEK blocked Grb2/Sos dissociation in response to insulin and the deactivation of p21ras (28Waters S.B. Holt K.H. Ross S.E. Syu L.-J. Guan K.-L. Saltiel A.R. Koretzky G.A. Pessin J.E. J. Biol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 25320-25323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Taken together, these observations strongly imply that MAPK or other protein kinases downstream of MEK are necessary for both Grb2/Sos dissociation and for the deactivation of p21ras seen after the initial activation by insulin. The aim of the work presented here was to assess whether the protein kinases in the Raf/MAPK pathway or other downstream kinases are indeed sufficient to desensitize p21ras to growth factor stimulation or whether other events are also necessary. We report here that activation of the Raf/MAPK pathway, independent of growth factor stimulation, does not cause dissociation of Grb2 from Sos or p21ras desensitization. One or more other regulatory mechanisms must also play a role in mediating disassembly of complexes of Grb2 and Sos in response to growth factors. The anti-phosphotyrosine antibody PY20 and monoclonal anti-Grb2 antibody was from Transduction Laboratories. For immunoprecipitation of Sos, an antibody raised against a peptide corresponding to amino acids 100-120 was used (23Cherniack A.D. Klarlund J.K. Conway B.R. Czech M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1485-1488Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). For immunoblotting of Sos, an antibody to a COOH-terminal part of the Sos-1 was kindly provided by Dr. H. Meisner (32Meisner H. Conway B.R. Hartley D. Czech M.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3571-3578Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). PMA was from LC laboratories. Estrogen was from Sigma. Platelet-derived growth factor-BB (PDGF-BB) and EGF were from Upstate Biotechnology. 3T3ΔRaf-1:ER cells (33Samuels M.L. Weber M.J. Bishop J.M. McMahon M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6241-6252Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar) were grown in 10-cm plates (Corning) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), with 10% fetal calf serum (Upstate Biotechnology), 50 µg/ml penicillin, and 50 µg/ml streptomycin sulfate. -After stimulation, cells were washed in 10 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (1.8 mM KH2PO4, 171 mM NaCl, 1.0 mM Na2HPO4, and 3.4 mM KCl) and lysed in 1 ml of cold lysis buffer (30 mM Hepes, pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mM p-nitrophenyl phosphate, 50 mM NaF, 1 mM Na3VO4, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 µg/ml each of leupeptin, aprotinin and pepstatin, and 1 mM benzamidine). Lysates were spun in a microfuge at 15,000 × g for 10 min at 4°C. The supernatants were removed and assayed for total protein content using the Bradford method (34Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar). Equal amounts of protein from each lysate were then precleared by the addition of 10 µl of protein A-Sepharose (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) and incubated on an end-over-end mixer at 4°C for 1 h. Samples were then centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 2 min at 4°C, and supernatants were incubated on an end-over-end mixer with 10 µl of anti-Sos and 25 µl of protein A-Sepharose for 16 h. The Sepharose was pelleted by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 2 min at 4°C. Pellets were washed five times with cold wash buffer (phosphate-buffered saline with 0.1% Triton X-100, 2 mM P-nitrophenyl phosphate, 50 mM NaF, 1 mM Na3VO4), and the protein was dissolved in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Samples were loaded on SDS-PAGE gels and transferred to nitrocellulose filters. Filters were probed with antibodies, and antibody-bound proteins were visualized using ECL (Amersham) according to the manufacturer's specifications. The cells were transferred to 4.5 ml of phosphate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 0.5% fetal bovine serum when they had just reached confluence and were used 48 h later. 1 mCi of 32Pi (DuPont NEN) was added to each plate for the last 24 h of incubation. Cells were then rapidly washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed by addition of 800 µl of lysis buffer (20 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl chloride, 1 mM benzamidine, 1% Triton X-100, and aprotinin, pepstatin, and leupeptin at 0.5 µg/ml each) with 10% tissue culture supernatant from the hybridoma cell line Y13-259. After clarification by centrifugation, lysates were incubated for 1 h with 5 µl of Sepharose 4B coupled to goat anti-rat antibodies (Organon Teknika, Cappel). Antibody-bound beads were collected by centrifugation and washed extensively in 50 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, 0.5 M NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 0.005% SDS. Bound GDP and GTP was eluted and subjected to chromatography on polyethylenimine cellulose plates (Merck) as described with GDP and GTP as unlabeled markers (35Farnsworth C.L. Marshall M.S. Gibbs J.B. Stacey D.W. Feig L.A. Cell. 1991; 64: 625-633Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The locations of the GDP and GTP were visualized by UV light, and relevant areas were cut out and analyzed for radioactivity in a beta counter. A chimeric protein containing the catalytic domain of oncogenic Raf-1 fused to the hormone binding region of the estradiol receptor (ΔRaf-1:ER) exhibits protein kinase activity that can be rapidly activated by addition of estradiol, resulting in activation of endogenous MEK and MAPK (33Samuels M.L. Weber M.J. Bishop J.M. McMahon M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6241-6252Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar, 36Samuels M.L. McMahon M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7855-7866Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells stably expressing ΔRaf-1:ER therefore allow examination of the effects of activation of Raf-1/MAPK kinase cascade independently of other signaling pathways. We first examined the time course of p21ras activation in response to EGF and PDGF in C7 3T3 cells expressing ΔRaf-1:ER (3T3ΔRaf-1:ER cells) to verify that deactivation does occur in these cells after initial activation by the growth factors. As is seen in Fig. 1, both hormones rapidly induce a 3-4-fold increase in GTP loading of p21ras, and this is followed by a deactivation phase resulting in the return of GTP·p21ras concentrations to basal levels after 20-30 min. As seen in other systems, the deactivation of p21ras occurs in parallel with hyperphosphorylation of mSos as evidenced by its decreased mobility on SDS-PAGE (data not shown). Sos contains numerous consensus sites for MAPK phosphorylation in its COOH-terminal portion and can be phosphorylated by MAP kinase both in vitro and in intact cells (30Cherniack A.D. Klarlund J.K. Czech M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4717-4720Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We thus tested whether MEK inhibition abolishes Sos hyperphosphorylation and Grb2 dissociation from Sos, as reported recently for Chinese hamster ovary cells or rat-1 cells overexpressing the insulin receptor (28Waters S.B. Holt K.H. Ross S.E. Syu L.-J. Guan K.-L. Saltiel A.R. Koretzky G.A. Pessin J.E. J. Biol.

Wiese R.J. Brady M.J. Mastick C.C. Waters S.B. Yamauchi K. Pessin J.E. Cuatrecasas P. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20801-20807Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar), and incubated in the presence or absence of PMA to initiate the phosphorylation and disassembly of Sos from Grb2. Fig. 2 shows that these two previously reported effects of PMA in 3T3-L1 adipocytes are also observed in 3T3ΔRaf-1:ER cells. Importantly, the MEK inhibitor blocked both the retarded electrophoretic mobility of Sos (panel A) as well as the 50% loss of Grb2 from immunoprecipitated Sos (panels B and C) caused by PMA. These data confirm that MEK and presumably MAPK are required for these processes to proceed normally. To determine whether selective activation of the Raf/MAPK pathway downstream of receptor or protein kinase C elements causes phosphorylation of Sos and its dissociation from Grb2, 3T3ΔRaf-1:ER cells were treated with or without estradiol or PMA. Estradiol treatment of 3T3ΔRaf-1:ER cells caused a marked electrophoretic mobility shift of the Sos protein, which was even more extensive than that caused by PMA (Fig. 3A). It is noteworthy that all of the Sos from the untreated cells appears to be converted to the slower migrating species, indicating that virtually all Sos molecules are phosphorylated in response to ΔRaf-1:ER activation. This system therefore allows rigorous testing of the hypothesis that phosphorylation of Sos by protein kinases in the Raf/MAPK pathway constitutes a feedback mechanism that results in Grb2/Sos dissociation and desensitization of p21ras to growth factor stimulation. Surprisingly, the apparent hyperphosphorylation of Sos by ΔRaf-1:ER activation was not accompanied by any detectable dimunition of Grb2 from anti-Sos immune complexes (Fig. 3, B and C). Under these same experimental conditions, PMA treatment of 3T3ΔRaf-1:ER cells elicited release of over half of the Grb2 band to cellular Sos protein. These data lead to the unexpected conclusion that selective stimulation of MAPK via ΔRaf-1:ER activation can cause Sos hyperphosphorylation but is insufficient to signal Grb2/Sos disassembly in 3T3ΔRaf-1:ER cells. Although Sos disassembly from Grb2 does not occur in response to MAP kinase activation (Fig. 3), it is possible that GTP·p21ras levels are regulated by MAP kinase through other mechanisms. We tested this hypothesis by treating 32P-labeled 3T3ΔRaf-1:ER cells with or without estradiol for 30 min prior to a 5-min exposure to either EGF or PDGF and then analyzing the labeled guanosine nucleotide content of p21ras. Fig. 4 demonstrates the failure of estradiol to modulate the extent of p21ras activation by EGF or PDGF under these experimental conditions. Parallel plates of cells treated with estradiol for 30 min were shown to exhibit marked hyperphosphorylation of endogenous Sos, verifying the effectiveness of estradiol to stimulate the Raf/MAPK pathway (data not shown, see Fig. 2, Fig. 3). Thus, activation of MAPK via the ΔRaf-1:ER is not sufficient to cause desensitization of p21ras under these conditions. In this same series of experiments (Fig. 3), the cells were also incubated with or without okadaic acid, a potent phosphatase inhibitor known to induce or potentiate the activation of several cellular protein kinases including MAPK (38Cohen P. Holmes C.F. Tsukitani Y. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 98-102Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1266) Google Scholar, 39Mumby M.C. Walter G. Physiol. Rev. 1993; 73: 673-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar). When added alone to 3T3ΔRaf-1:ER cells, this agent only slightly decreased the electrophoretic mobility of Sos (Fig. 3A) and did not detectably dissociate Grb2 from Sos (Fig. 3, B and C). However, incubation of okadaic acid with estradiol-treated 3T3ΔRaf-1:ER cells potentiated Sos hyperphosphorylation and caused a marked, 60% decrease in Grb2 associated with Sos protein. Thus, the combined signaling pathways elicited by ΔRaf-1:ER and okadaic acid are able to cause disassembly of complexes containing Sos and Grb2, whereas each of these pathways acting alone is insufficient to mediate this response. Previous results showed that prolonged activation of ΔRaf-1:ER in 3T3 cells induces a partial block in activation of endogenous Raf/MAPK pathway by PDGF, which does not appear to be due to impaired function of the PDGF receptor (36Samuels M.L. McMahon M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7855-7866Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, in these cells Sos is heavily phosphorylated in response to ΔRaf-1:ER activation, and it was therefore hypothesized that the block was at the level of p21ras activation. We therefore examined whether prolonged activation of ΔRaf-1:ER results in diminished responsiveness of p21ras to activation by PDGF or EGF (Fig. 4). After activation of ΔRaf-1:ER for 15 h, the cells appeared morphologically transformed as described previously (33Samuels M.L. Weber M.J. Bishop J.M. McMahon M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6241-6252Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). However, GTP·p21ras levels were stimulated to the same extent in estradiol-treated cells as in control cells in response to PDGF under these experimental conditions (Fig. 4). The block of endogenous Raf-1 kinase activation by PDGF seen in ΔRaf-1:ER cells treated for prolonged periods with estradiol is therefore not at the level of GTP loading of p21ras. Rather, the underlying inhibitory mechanism is likely due to modifications of Raf-1 itself or of other components that modulate its protein kinase activity. Interestingly, prolonged treatment of 3T3ΔRaf-1:ER cells with estradiol did inhibit the ability of EGF to activate p21ras (Fig. 4). To examine whether EGF receptors function normally in these cells, extracts were subjected to Western blotting with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies. As shown in Fig. 4C, the tyrosine phosphorylation of the PDGF receptor upon treatment with PDGF was unaffected by the estradiol treatment of the ΔRaf-1:ER cells. In contrast, activation of ΔRaf-1:ER for 15 h, but not for 30 min, resulted in a dramatic reduction of the signal from the EGF receptor (Fig. 4). 2M. L. Samuels and M. McMahon, unpublished results. Such a reduction was not seen in untransfected C7 3T3 cells (data not shown). Thus, the reduction in p21ras activation seen after prolonged activation of ΔRaf-1:ER is likely due to down-regulation of the EGF receptor as a result of activation of the Raf/MAP kinase pathway. Taken together, the data presented here (Fig. 3, Fig. 4) are inconsistent with the simple model that MAP kinase-mediated phosphorylation of Sos proteins causes their disassembly from Grb2 as well as p21ras desensitization. This conclusion is reinforced by the observation that EGF does not cause Grb2/Sos dissociation in 3T3-L1 adipocytes whereas insulin and PMA do, even though EGF activates MAP kinase and induces Sos hyperphosphorylation in these cells (24Klarlund J.K.

On the other hand, MAPK seems necessary for dissociation of Sos from Grb2 to occur (28Waters S.B. Holt K.H. Ross S.E. Syu L.-J. Guan K.-L. Saltiel A.R. Koretzky G.A. Pessin J.E. J. Biol.

One reasonable hypothesis is that insulin and PMA activate another protein kinase or kinases that are necessary for Grb2/Sos dissociation but that this kinase is not activated by other growth factors such as EGF. Thus, activation of both MAP kinase and another unidentified protein kinase might be required to phosphorylate the putative multiple sites on Sos necessary for Grb2 dissociation. This dissociation presumably contributes to the desensitization of p21ras (for detailed discussion, see 24Klarlund J.K. Cherniack A.D. Czech M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23421-23428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The deactivation that occurs after initial p21ras activation in response to EGF could be caused by a different mechanism: down-regulation of EGF receptors (24Klarlund J.K. Cherniack A.D. Czech M.P.

Premature chromatin condensation occurs in the temperature-sensitive rcc1− mutant of the BHK21 cell line, tsBN2, at the restrictive temperature. This observation can be explained if the premature activation of MPF is normally inhibited by GTP-Ran. In the absence of RCC1, GDP-Ran predominates, resulting in MPF activation. However, experiments with Ran mutants to determine whether GTP- or GDP-Ran prevents activation of MPF have yielded conflicting results. In order to clarify this point, we have microinjected nucleotide-bound Ran, instead of mutated Ran, into the nuclei of tsBN2 cells treated to reduce RCC1-mediated guanine nucleotide exchange. GTP-Ran, GTPγS-Ran, and GDP-Ran all inhibited chromatin condensation. However, the inhibition of chromatin condensation by GDP-Ran could be completely abolished by co-injection with GDP, but not GTP.

The cell line tsBN2 is derived from BHK21 cells and contains a temperature-sensitive (ts) mutation in RCC1 (1Uchida S. Sekiguchi T. Nishitani H. Miyauchi K. Ohtsubo M. Nishimoto T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 577-584Google Scholar) which is lost on incubation at 39.5°C, the restrictive temperature (2Nishitani H. Ohtsubo M. Yamashita K. Iida H. Pines J. Yasuda H. Shibata Y. Hunter T.

Thus, RCC1 has been considered to be involved in coupling S phase with mitosis. A ts rcc1− mutant (pim1-d1) of Schizosaccharomyces pombe is arrested at the end of mitosis with condensed chromosomes (3Matsumoto T. Beach D. Cell. 1991; 66: 347-360Google Scholar, 4Sazar S. Nurse P.

RCC1 functions as a guanine nucleotide exchanging factor on Ran/TC4, a Ras-like small nuclear G protein (6Bischoff F.R. Ponstingl H. Nature. 1991; 354: 80-82Google Scholar). Since Ran/TC4 is involved in a nuclear transport (7Moore M.S. Blobel G. Nature. 1993; 365: 661-663Google Scholar, 8Melchior F. Paschal B. Evans J. Gerace L. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1649-1659Google Scholar), the phenotype of rcc1− mutants are considered to be a consequence of a defect in nucleocytoplasmic transport. In fact, tsBN2 cells are defective in both mRNA export and protein import (9Kadowaki Goldfarb D. Spitz L.M. Tartakoff A.M. Ohno M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2929-2937Google Scholar, 10Tachibana T. Imamoto N. Seino H. Nishimoto T. Yoneda Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24542-24545Google Scholar). Similarly to other members of the Ras superfamily, GTP-Ran, but not GDP-Ran, is active in nuclear transport (7Moore M.S. Blobel G. Nature. 1993; 365: 661-663Google Scholar, 8Melchior F. Paschal B. Evans J. Gerace L. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1649-1659Google Scholar) and rescues DNA replication which is otherwise blocked in RCC1-depleted Xenopus extracts (11Dasso M. Seki T. Azuma Y. Ohba T. Nishimoto T. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5732-5744Google Scholar). However, there is conflicting evidence as to which form of Ran prevents the activation of MPF during S phase. The expression of G19V/Q69L-Ran which is blocked in GTP-form, causes a G2 block in cultured cells (12Ren M. Coutavas E. D'Eustachio P. Rush M.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4216-4224Google Scholar), indicating that GTP-Ran prevents an activation of MPF in S phase. In contrast, Kornbluth et al. (13Kornbluth S. Dasso M. Newport J. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 705-719Google Scholar) and Clarke et al. (14Clarke P.R. Klebe C. Wittinghofer A. Karsenti E. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 1217-1225Google Scholar) found that T24N-Ran which is blocked in GDP-form, inhibited an activation of MPF in Xenopus extracts, arguing that GTP-Ran is required for activation of MPF. In order to clarify this disagreement, we have investigated the effect of Ran on premature chromatin condensation (PCC) induced by the RCC1 mutation in the tsBN2 cell line. We used Ran prebound to guanine nucleotides in vitro, instead of Ran mutants, since there is no evidence that mutated Ran proteins behave like a normal GTP- or GDP-bound Ran, in vivo. Incubation of tsBN2 cells at the restrictive temperature prior to microinjection greatly reduces the endogenous guanine nucleotide exchanging activity acting on Ran (15Bischoff F.R. Krebber H. Kempf T. Hermes I. Ponstingl H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1749-1753Google Scholar). This has the effect of stabilizing the injected Ran-guanine nucleotide complexes. The tsBN2 cell line (16Nishimoto T. Basilico C. Somat. Cell Genet. 1978; 4: 323-340Google Scholar) was cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% calf serum in a humidified atmosphere containing 10% CO2, at 33.5°C (the permissive temperature). The restrictive temperature used was 40.5°C. In order to arrest a culture in early S phase, cells were incubated in DMEM medium without isoleucine with 3% dialyzed calf serum for 30 h, and then fed with DMEM medium containing 10% fetal calf serum and 2.5 mM hydroxyurea for 16 h at 33.5°C as described (2Nishitani H. Ohtsubo M. Yamashita K. Iida H. Pines J. Yasuda H. Shibata Y. Hunter T. Nishimoto T. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1555-1564Google Scholar). Ran and RCC1 were expressed in E. coli, BL21(DE3) at 37°C for 6 h, and purified as described (11Dasso M. Seki T. Azuma Y. Ohba T. Nishimoto T. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5732-5744Google Scholar). Purified Ran was incubated with 2.5 mM GDP, GTP, or GTPγS, and nucleotide-bound Ran proteins were further purified as described (11Dasso M. Seki T. Azuma Y. Ohba T. Nishimoto T. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5732-5744Google Scholar). Cells were plated at 7 × 104 cells on 18 × 18 mm glass coverslips in 35-mm dishes and synchronized at early S phase as described above. Ran-guanine nucleotide complexes suspended in buffer containing 50 mM HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.5), 1 mM dithiothreitol, 25 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM MgCl2 were injected into either the cytoplasm or nucleus of individual cells. In every injection, 0.3 mg/ml rabbit IgG was co-injected as an indicator. To maintain the pH of the medium during injection, 20 mM (final concentration) HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.2) was added. 5 h after injection, cells were fixed with cold (−20°C) methanol, stained with rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG antibodies (Tago, Inc.) and then with 1 µg/ml DNA-specific dye, Hoechst 33342 (Calbiochem), as described (17Seki T. Yamashita K. Nishitani H. Takagi T. Russell P. Nishimoto T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 1373-1388Google Scholar). Photomicroscopy was performed using a Zeiss Axiophot. Frequency of cells showing PCC was normalized to that of cells injected with rabbit IgG alone as described (17Seki T. Yamashita K. Nishitani H. Takagi T. Russell P. Nishimoto T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 1373-1388Google Scholar). Human Ran was expressed in E. coli and purified from bacterial cell lysates (Fig. 1). Purified Ran bound to either GTP or GDP with an almost equal efficiency (data not shown), indicating that E. coli-produced Ran behaved like a normal Ran protein as described (18Klebe C. Nishimoto T. Wittinghofer F. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 11923-11928Google Scholar). The preparation of GTP-Ran contained ∼67% of GTP-form and 33% of GDP-form, and that of GTPγS-Ran contained ∼80% of GTPγS-form and 20% of GDP-form, which were analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography as described (11Dasso M. Seki T. Azuma Y. Ohba T. Nishimoto T. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5732-5744Google Scholar). In order to determine an appropriate preincubation time at the restrictive temperature, a series of cultures of tsBN2 cells were incubated at 40.5°C and injected with RCC1 as described (19Seino H. Nishitani H. Seki T. Hisamoto N. Tazunoki T. Shiraki T. Ohtsubo M. Yamashita K. Sekiguchi T. Nishimoto T. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1992; 56: 367-375Google Scholar), to determine the time at which PCC become irreversible. After 90 min, PCC was efficiently inhibited by injection of RCC1 (2 mg/ml), but not after 120 min (data not shown). Thus, we chose 90 min as a maximum length of preincubation at 40.5°C. Under such conditions, the frequency of cells showing PCC was reduced to 1% by nuclear injection of RCC1 (2 mg/ml). Ran-guanine nucleotide complexes were directly injected into nuclei, and as a control, into the cytoplasm. As shown in Fig. 2, GTP-Ran inhibited PCC in both cases in a dose-dependent manner. The inhibition of PCC is more pronounced with nuclear injection, compared to cytoplasmic injection. GDP-Ran also inhibited PCC, weakly but significantly, in a dose-dependent manner. If residual RCC1 exchanges GDP of injected GDP-Ran with GTP, GDP-Ran may inhibit PCC as GTP-Ran. Since the cellular concentration of GTP is much higher than GDP (20Stocchi V. Cucchiarini L. Canestrari F. Piacentini M.P. Fornaini G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 167: 181-190Google Scholar), such an exchange could happen. In order to prevent an exchange of GDP-Ran for GTP-Ran, GDP-Ran was co-injected with more than an equal concentration of GDP and, as a control, GTP. When 1 mM GDP was included with the GDP-Ran, the ability of GDP-Ran to inhibit PCC was completely abolished (Fig. 3). In contrast, co-injection with GTP did not affect the inhibitory activity of GDP-Ran (Fig. 3). Injection of GDP or GTP alone had no effect on PCC induction (Fig. 3). These findings indicate that GTP-Ran, but not GDP-Ran, inhibits PCC induced by loss of RCC1 function.Fig. 3Co-injection of GTP and GDP with GDP-Ran. The injection was carried out as described in Fig. 2. 1 mM GDP or GTP was co-injected with GDP-Ran (10 (□) and 20 (□) mg/ml) as indicated. As a control, 1 mM GDP or GTP alone was also injected. , cytoplasm; ▦, nucleus.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) In order to further investigate whether the hydrolysis of GTP bound to Ran is required for inhibition of PCC, GTPγS-Ran was injected into the nuclei or the cytoplasm of tsBN2 cells. As shown in Fig. 4, PCC was strongly inhibited by GTPγS-Ran, most markedly in the case of nuclear injection. The inhibitory activity of GTPγS-Ran was enhanced by co-injecting with 1 mM GTPγS. Therefore, GTPγS-Ran by itself inhibits PCC induction, indicating that the hydrolysis of GTP bound to Ran is not required in order to inhibit PCC. As could be expected by analogy with other members of the Ras family, GTP-Ran, but not GDP-Ran, strongly inhibited PCC induction. Previously we found that the induction of PCC in tsBN2 cells was correlated with premature activation of MPF (2Nishitani H. Ohtsubo M. Yamashita K. Iida H. Pines J. Yasuda H. Shibata Y. Hunter T. Nishimoto T. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1555-1564Google Scholar). Thus, our present data indicate that the activation of MPF is inhibited by GTP-Ran in S phase. Cdc25C which is essential for PCC induced by loss of RCC1, is localized in the cytoplasm in BHK21 cells (17Seki T. Yamashita K. Nishitani H. Takagi T. Russell P. Nishimoto T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 1373-1388Google Scholar). Therefore, it must enter the nuclei prior to PCC. Since a hydrolysis of GTP-Ran is essential for nuclear import of proteins (7Moore M.S. Blobel G. Nature. 1993; 365: 661-663Google Scholar, 8Melchior F. Paschal B. Evans J. Gerace L. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1649-1659Google Scholar), the PCC inhibitory activity of GTPγS-Ran could be caused by an inhibition of the nuclear import of Cdc25C. However, this is unlikely for the following reasons. First, PCC was inhibited by injection of GTP-Ran and since GTP-Ran facilitates nuclear import, it should enhance the import of Cdc25C which would increase PCC frequency. Thus, GTPγS-Ran is acting in a pathway separate from the nuclear transport of proteins. Second, GTPγS-Ran inhibited PCC more strongly when injected into the nucleus compared with cytoplasmic injection. When a nonhydrolyzable GTP analogue is added to in vitro nuclear import system, Ran accumulates on the cytoplasmic side of the nuclear envelope where a large Ran-binding protein, RanBP2, is located (21Melchior F. Guan T. Yokoyama N. Nishimoto T. Gerace L. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 571-581Google Scholar). If GTPγS-Ran inhibited PCC by blocking the nuclear import, therefore, the cytoplasmic injection should inhibit PCC more strongly than the nuclear injection. The experimental evidences presented here indicate that there may be another Ran pathway which is involved in the regulation of MPF activity in which the hydrolysis of GTP bound to Ran is not required. Our results are consistent with the previous report that Ran blocked in GTP form inhibits the cell cycle progression from G2 to M phase (12Ren M. Coutavas E. D'Eustachio P. Rush M.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4216-4224Google Scholar). In S phase, the inhibition of MPF activation is critical for completion of DNA replication. This inhibition is carried out by the phosphorylation of Cdc2 and possibly a putative inhibitor(s) analogous to those found associated with G1 cyclin-Cdks complexes (22Nasmyth K. Hunt T. Nature. 1993; 366: 634-635Google Scholar). The completion of S phase may inactivate RCC1 and cause an accumulation of GDP-Ran, allowing activation of MPF. These events probably occur in the nucleus and result in the entry of Cdc25C. In support of this is the observation that cycloheximide which inhibits the activation of MPF also inhibits entry of Cdc25C into the nucleus (17Seki T. Yamashita K. Nishitani H. Takagi T. Russell P. Nishimoto T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 1373-1388Google Scholar). It is not yet clear how the GTP-Ran essential for the nuclear import of Cdc25C is produced at the end of S phase when we suppose that RCC1 is inactivated. GTP-Ran or GTPγS-Ran is not as effective as RCC1 in inhibiting PCC. This may be due to GDP-Ran in our preparations of GTP- or GTPγS-Ran (33% and 20% of GDP-Ran, respectively), although we cannot exclude the possibility that RCC1 has action other than the guanine nucleotide exchange that results in the inhibition of MPF activation.

This decrease after phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate was associated with diminished heparin-releasable LPL mass and activity in the culture medium. Addition of the cAMP analog 8-Br-cAMP to NCI-H295 cells resulted in a rapid, but transient dose-dependent induction of LPL mRNA. Treatment with the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide gradually induced, whereas simultaneous addition of cAMP and cycloheximide superinduced LPL mRNA levels. Nuclear run-on analysis indicated that the effects of cAMP and cycloheximide occurred at the transcriptional and post-transcriptional level, respectively. Transient co-transfection assays demonstrated that the first 230 base pairs of the proximal LPL promoter contain a cAMP-responsive element activated by protein kinase A and transcription factors belonging to the CREB/CREM family. These data indicate that LPL is expressed in human adrenal cortex and regulated in NCI-H295 adrenocortical carcinoma cells by activators of the protein kinase A and protein kinase C second messenger pathways in a manner comparable to P450scc, which catalyzes the first step in adrenal steroidogenesis.

These data indicate that LPL is expressed in human adrenal cortex and regulated in NCI-H295 adrenocortical carcinoma cells by activators of the protein kinase A and protein kinase C second messenger pathways in a manner comparable to P450scc, which catalyzes the first step in adrenal steroidogenesis. These observations suggest a role for LPL in adrenal energy and/or lipid metabolism and possibly in steroidogenesis. The adrenal cortex is the major site of the biosynthesis of steroid hormones, such as glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids (for review, see 1Miller W.L. Tyrrell J.B. Felig P. Baxter J. Frohman L. The Adrenal Cortex. McGraw Hill Inc., New York1995Google Scholar). Adrenal steroidogenesis is controlled by the action of specific peptide hormones (2Waterman M.R. Simpson E.R. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 1989; 45: 533-566PubMed Google Scholar). In the adrenal cortex, glucocorticoid synthesis is stimulated by the anterior pituitary-derived adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), 1The abbreviations used are: ACTHadrenocroticotropic hormoneapoapolipoproteinCATchloramphenicol acetyltransferaseCHXcycloheximideGAPDHglyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenaseLPLlipoprotein lipasePKAprotein kinase APKCprotein kinase CPMAphorbol 12-myristate 13-acetateP450scccytochrome P450 side chain cleavage enzymePIPES1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acidVLDLvery low density lipoproteinPCRpolymerase chain reactionbpbase pair(s)RTreverse transcriptaseCREBcAMP response element-binding protein(s)CREMcAMP response element modulator. which, after binding to a specific cell surface receptor, activates adenylate cyclase, resulting in elevated intracellular cAMP concentrations and activation of the protein kinase A (PKA) signal transduction pathway (2Waterman M.R. Simpson E.R. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 1989; 45: 533-566PubMed Google Scholar). Mineralocorticoid synthesis, on the other hand, is induced by angiotensin-II, which activates the protein kinase C (PKC) pathway of intracellular second messengers. The first step in the enzymatic conversion of cholesterol into steroid hormones is catalyzed by the mitochondrial cytochrome P450 side chain cleavage enzyme (P450scc), which catalyzes the conversion of cholesterol into pregnenolone. Long term regulation of steroidogenesis by these peptide hormones occurs via changes in P450scc gene expression and transcription (3John M.E. John M.C. Boggaram V. Simpson E.R. Waterman M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 4715-4719Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 4John M.E. John M.C. Ashley P. MacDonald R.J. Simpson E.R. Waterman M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Human adrenals derive the cholesterol necessary for steroid hormone synthesis mainly by receptor-mediated endocytosis of low density lipoproteins (LDL) and, to a lesser extent, by de novo synthesis, the rate-limiting step of which is catalyzed by the enzyme 3-hydroxy 3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (6Gwynne J.T.

Although patients homozygous for familial hypercholesterolemia have a mild impairment in cortisol secretion during maximal ACTH stimulation (9Illingworth D.R. Lees A.M. Lees R.S. Metabolism. 1983; 30: 1045Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (49) Google Scholar), the absence of adrenal dysfunction in patients with defects in the LDL-receptor pathway treated with hydroxy 3-methylglutaryl-coA reductase inhibitors, such as mevinolin, suggested the existence of alternative pathways of cholesterol delivery to the adrenal for steroid synthesis (10Laue L.

Lipoprotein lipase (LPL) occupies a pivotal position in both lipoprotein and energy metabolism. Located as a homodimer on the capillary endothelium of tissues, LPL hydrolyzes triglycerides in chylomicrons and very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) particles using apoC-II as a co-factor (11Auwerx J. Leroy P. Schoonjans K. Crit. Rev. Clin. Lab. Sci. 1992; 29: 243-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The released free fatty acids are taken up by the underlying tissue for oxidation to generate ATP (muscle), for storage (adipose tissue), or for secretion in milk (mammary gland). In addition to its lipolytic activity on triglyceride-rich lipoprotein particles, LPL functions as a ligand for the VLDL receptor (12Takahashi S. Suzuki J. Kohno M. Oida K. Tamai T. Miyabo S.

LPL is expressed in a number of differentiated tissues, such as adipocytes, macrophages, lactating mammary gland, and muscle (for review, see 11Auwerx J. Leroy P. Schoonjans K. Crit. Rev. Clin. Lab. Sci. 1992; 29: 243-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). In contrast, in liver LPL is only expressed in fetal and neonatal liver and becomes extinguished 3 weeks after birth (22Peinado-Onsurbe J. Staels B. Deeb S. Ramirez I. Llobera M. Auwerx J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1131: 281-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 23Staels B. Auwerx J. Development. 1992; 115: 1035-1043PubMed Google Scholar). In view of the pivotal role of LPL both in energy and lipoprotein metabolism, the main objective of the current investigation was to analyze whether LPL is expressed in the human adrenal cortex, a major cholesterol metabolizing tissue. Our results demonstrate the presence of LPL mRNA both in fetal and adult adrenal cortex. Furthermore, LPL is expressed in the recently characterized human adrenocortical carcinoma cell line, NCI-H295 (24Staels B. Hum D.W. Miller W.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 423-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 25Gazdar A.F. Oie H.K. Shackleton C.H. Chen T.R. Triche T.J. Myers C.E. Chrousos G.P. Brennan M.F. Stein C.A. La-Rocca R.V. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 5488-5496PubMed Google Scholar), where it is located on the plasma membrane and can be released by heparin treatment. LPL expression in NCI-H295 cells is regulated by cAMP and phorbol esters, activators of the PKA and PKC second messenger pathways, respectively, in a manner reminiscent of the regulation of the rate-limiting enzyme in adrenal steroidogenesis, P450scc. These data therefore suggest a role for LPL in adrenal energy and lipoprotein metabolism. Cycloheximide (CHX), transferrin, selenium, insulin and Hepes were obtained from Boehringer Mannheim (Mannheim, Germany) and fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin, dithiothreitol, sucrose, PIPES, glycerol trioleate, 8-Br-cAMP, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), and the calcium ionophore, A-23187, from Sigma. Superscript reverse transcriptase and cell culture media were from Life Technologies (Gaithersburg, MD). Glycerol tri-[9,10-(n)-3H]oleate was obtained from Amersham International and [α-32P]dCTP, [α-32P]UTP, and [3H]chloramphenicol from ICN Nucleotides (Costa Mesa, CA). Human monocyte THP-1, hepatoblastoma HepG2, choriocarcinoma JEG-3, and adrenocortical carcinoma NCI-H295 cells were obtained from the ATCC. NCI-H295, THP-1, JEG-3, and HepG2 cell cultures were maintained exactly as described previously (24Staels B. Hum D.W. Miller W.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 423-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 26Auwerx J. Deeb S. Brunzell J.D. Peng R. Chait A. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 2651-2655Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 27Peinado-Onsurbe J. Staels B. Deeb S. Auwerx J. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 10121-10128Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). PMA and A-23187, dissolved in acetone, and 8-Br-cAMP and CHX, dissolved in sterile H20, were added to the medium at the indicated concentrations and for the indicated periods of time. Control cells received vehicle only. In experiments for LPL protein and activity determination, heparin was added to the culture medium at a concentration of 100 milliunits/ml. Human total fetal adrenals were dissected free and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. Care was taken not to contaminate the samples with adipose tissue. Human adult adrenals were harvested and the tissue layer enriched in fasciculata cells was prepared as described previously (28Guillon G. Trueba M. Joubert D. Grazzini E. Chouinard L. Côté M. Payet M.D. Manzoni O. Barberis C. Robert M. Gallo-Payet N. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 1285-1295Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, adipose tissue was carefully removed from the adrenal gland using scissors and thin tissue slices of the fasciculata layer were obtained using a Stadie-Riggs tissue slicer. Total cellular RNA was prepared by the guanidinium isothiocyanate/cesium chloride procedure (tissues) or by the acid guanidinium thiocyanate/phenol-chloroform method (cell cultures) (29Chirgwin J.M. Przybyla A.E. MacDonald R.J. Rutter W.J. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5294-5299Crossref PubMed Scopus (16648) Google Scholar, 30Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63088) Google Scholar). Poly(A+) RNA was subsequently prepared using Poly(A)Quik push columns (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). For analysis of LPL expression in adult and fetal adrenal and NCI-H295 cells, total RNA (50 ng) was reverse transcribed using random hexamer primers and Superscript reverse transcriptase. LPL mRNA was subsequently PCR amplified (35 cycles of 1 min at 94°C, 1 min at 57°C, 1 min at 72°C) using as primers the sense oligo GCA AGC TTG GTA CCA ATG GAG AGC AAA GCC CTG (containing HindIII/KpnI cloning sites) and the antisense oligo TAC ATT CCT GTT ACC GTC CAG CCA TGG ATC (containing a NcoI cloning site), yielding a fragment of the expected size of 277 bp (18Wion K.L. Kirchgessner T.G. Lusis A.J. Schotz M.C. Lawn R.M. Science. 1987; 235: 1638-1641Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). This fragment spans exons 1 and 2 of the human LPL gene (19Deeb S. Peng R. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 4131-4135Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar), which excludes potential contamination of the RNA samples with genomic DNA. RNA from HepG2 and differentiated THP-1 cells were simultaneously amplified as negative and positive controls for LPL expression, respectively (26Auwerx J. Deeb S. Brunzell J.D. Peng R. Chait A. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 2651-2655Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 27Peinado-Onsurbe J. Staels B. Deeb S. Auwerx J. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 10121-10128Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). GAPDH-specific primers (sense primer: TGA TGA CAT CAA GAA GGT GGT GAA G; antisense primer: TCC TTG GAG GCC ATG TGG GCC AT) were used as control for the RT-PCR reaction (expected fragment size: 239 bp) (31Tokunaga K. Nakaruma Y. Sakata K. Fujimoro K. Ohkubo M. Sawada K. Sakiyama S. Cancer Res. 1987; 47: 5616-5619PubMed Google Scholar). The resulting products were separated on a 2% agarose gel and subsequently subcloned into the pUC19 plasmid vector. Sequence analysis revealed complete identity to the previously reported human LPL cDNA sequence (18Wion K.L. Kirchgessner T.G. Lusis A.J. Schotz M.C. Lawn R.M. Science. 1987; 235: 1638-1641Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). Northern and dot blot hybridizations of total cellular RNA and poly(A+) RNA were performed as described previously (23Staels B. Auwerx J. Development. 1992; 115: 1035-1043PubMed Google Scholar) using the human LPL cDNA clone, pHLPL-26, as a probe (26Auwerx J. Deeb S. Brunzell J.D. Peng R. Chait A. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 2651-2655Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The human P450scc cDNA probe was prepared by RT-PCR amplification based on the published sequence (32Chung B. Matteson K.J. Voutilainen R. Mohandas T.K. Miller W.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 8962-8966Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). A GAPDH probe was used as a control probe (31Tokunaga K. Nakaruma Y. Sakata K. Fujimoro K. Ohkubo M. Sawada K. Sakiyama S. Cancer Res. 1987; 47: 5616-5619PubMed Google Scholar). All cDNA probes were labeled by random primed labeling (Boehringer Mannheim). Filters were hybridized to 1.5 × 106 cpm/ml of each probe as described (23Staels B. Auwerx J. Development. 1992; 115: 1035-1043PubMed Google Scholar). They were washed once in 0.5 × SSC and 0.1% SDS for 10 min at room temperature and twice for 30 min at 65°C and subsequently exposed to x-ray film (X-Omat-AR, Kodak). Autoradiograms were analyzed by quantitative scanning densitometry (Bio-Rad GS670 Densitometer) as described (23Staels B. Auwerx J. Development. 1992; 115: 1035-1043PubMed Google Scholar). Nuclei were prepared from NCI-H295 cells treated with 8-Br-cAMP (300 µM), CHX (10 µg/ml), both 8-Br-cAMP and CHX, or vehicle and transcription run-on assays were performed as described by Nevins (33Nevins J.R. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 152: 234-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Equivalent counts of nuclear RNA labeled with [α-32P]UTP (3000 Ci/mmol) were hybridized for 36 h at 42°C to 5 µg of LPL, P450scc, GAPDH, and vector DNA (pBluescript) immobilized on Hybond-C Extra filters (Amersham). After hybridization, filters were washed at room temperature for 10 min in 0.5 × SSC and 0.1% SDS and twice for 30 min at 65°C and subsequently exposed to x-ray film (X-Omat-AR, Kodak). Quantitative analysis was performed by scanning densitometry (Bio-Rad GS670 densitometer). Cloning of the human LPL gene promoter and construction of the LPL gene promoter CAT vectors were previously described (19Deeb S. Peng R. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 4131-4135Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 34Schoonjans K. Staels B. De Vos P. Szpirer J. Szpirer C. Deeb S. Verhoeven G. Auwerx J. FEBS Lett. 1993; 329: 89-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The different 5′ LPL promoter deletions were subcloned in a luciferase expression vector and were kindly provided by Dr. S. Deeb. The expression vectors pSG5-CREB and pSG5-CREMτ were a kind gift from Dr. P. Sassone-Corsi, and the PKA expression vectors were a kind gift from Dr. S. Mc Knight. NCI-H295 and JEG-3 cells were transfected in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's minimal essential medium by the calcium phosphate co-precipitation procedure with a mixture of plasmids, which contained in addition to the reporter (3 µg) and expression vector(s) (1 µg), a cytomegalovirus driven β-galactosidase vector used as an internal control for transfection efficiency. All samples were complemented to an equal total amount of plasmid DNA using empty pSG5 plasmid vector. After 8 h of incubation cells were changed to fresh medium for another 16 h and cells were subsequently treated with 8-Br-cAMP (300 µM) or solvent for a further 6 h. CAT and luciferase activities were determined on cell extracts as described (35Gorman C.M. Moffat L.F. Howard B.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1982; 2: 1044-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (5292) Google Scholar, 36de Wet J.R. Wood K. DeLuca M. Helinski D.R. Subramani S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 725-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (2474) Google Scholar). LPL mass was determined by a solid phase sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using a chicken polyclonal antibody against LPL for coating and the 5D2 monoclonal antibody for detection as described (37Vilella E. Joven J. Fernandez M. Vilaro S. Brunzell J.D. Olivecrona T. Bengtsson-Olivecrona G. J. Lipid Res. 1993; 34: 1555-1564Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). LPL activity was determined by the method of Ramirez et al. (38Ramirez I. Kryski A.J. Ben-Zeev O. Schotz M.C. Severson D.L. Biochem. J. 1985; 232: 229-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. The assay mixture contained 0.6 mM glycerol tri-[9,10-(n)-3H]oleate (12 Ci/mol), 50 mM MgCl2, 0.05% fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin, 3% rat serum (preheated for 30 min at 56°C), 25 mM PIPES (pH 7.5), and 0.02 ml of sample in a final volume of 0.2 ml. After incubation for 30 min at 25°C, the reaction was stopped and [3H]oleate was separated from the substrate and quantified as described previously (39Burgaya F. Peinado J. Vilaro S. Llobera M. Ramirez M. Biochem. J. 1989; 259: 159-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The amount of enzyme catalyzing the release of 1 µmol/min of oleate is defined as 1 unit. To obtain NCI-H295 cell extracts, cells were lysed in a buffer containing 1% (w/v) Triton X-100, 5 µg/ml leupeptin, 2 mM EDTA, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 unit/ml aprotinin (Sigma) in phosphate-buffered saline. The lysed cells were scraped, rapidly frozen in liquid nitrogen, and sonicated for 30 s at maximum potency. Next, the extract was centrifuged 10 min at 13,000 rpm in an Hereaus Biofuge A centrifuge at 4°C. The supernatant (20 µl) was loaded onto a SDS-polyacrylamide gel. After electrophoresis, the gel was blotted to nitrocellulose (Schleicher and Schuell, Dassel, Germany) at 15 volts for 1 h using the semi-dry system (Bio-Rad). LPL was detected with 10 µg/ml monoclonal antibody against bovine LPL (5D2) (Oncogene, Uniondal, NY) and a secondary peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse antibody at a dilution 1/2000 (Dakopatts, Glostrup, Denmark). The blot was developed with the ECL system from Amersham. As controls, purified bovine LPL (kindly provided by Dr. Gunilla Olivecrona, University of Umeå, Sweden) and cell extracts of COS1 cells transfected with the full-length human LPL cDNA were used (40Buscà R. Pujana M.A. Pognonec P. Auwerx J. Deeb S.S. Reina M. Vilaro S. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 939-951Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For immunofluorescence, cells, grown on glass coverslips, were rinsed briefly in phosphate-buffered saline, fixed with methanol (−20°C) for 2 min, washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline, incubated with a polyclonal antibody against human LPL, and detected using fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated swine anti-rabbit immunoglobulins as described (40Buscà R. Pujana M.A. Pognonec P. Auwerx J. Deeb S.S. Reina M. Vilaro S. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 939-951Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Preimmune rabbit antibodies were used as negative controls. For confocal microscopy studies a Leica TCS 4D (Leica Lasertechnik GmbH, Heidelberg, Germany) confocal scanning laser microscope adapted to an inverted Leitz DMIRBE microscope was used. Relative intensity analysis was made using the Leica TCS software. For flow cytometry NCI-H295 cells were fixed with ethanol (−20°C) for 2 min, washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline, and processed in suspension with the same primary and secondary antibodies used for immunofluorescence. Flow cytometry was done on an Epics Elite flow cytometer (Coulter Electronics Corporation, Hialeah, FL). Excitation was done using a standard 488 nm air-cooled argon-ion laser at 15 milliwatts power. The instrument was set up with the standard configuration. Forward scatter, side scatter, green fluorescence (525 nm BP filter) from fluorescein isothiocyanate, and time were measured. Optical alignment was based on optimized signal from 10-nm fluorescent beads (Immunocheck, Coulter Corp.). To determine whether the LPL gene is expressed in the human adrenal, RNA was extracted from human fetal total adrenal and analyzed by RT-PCR amplification using LPL-specific primers. RT-PCR amplification yielded a DNA fragment of the expected size of 277 bp (18Wion K.L. Kirchgessner T.G. Lusis A.J. Schotz M.C. Lawn R.M. Science. 1987; 235: 1638-1641Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar), indicating the presence of LPL mRNA in human fetal adrenal (Fig. 1, A and B). A fragment of similar size was obtained after RT-PCR amplification of RNA from the human monocyte cell line, THP-1, which expresses the LPL gene when differentiated into macrophages by phorbol ester treatment (26Auwerx J. Deeb S. Brunzell J.D. Peng R. Chait A. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 2651-2655Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). By contrast, no amplification product was obtained using RNA from the human hepatoma cell line, HepG2, which does not express the LPL gene (27Peinado-Onsurbe J. Staels B. Deeb S. Auwerx J. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 10121-10128Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). As a control, GAPDH mRNA could be detected in all cell lines and tissues examined (Fig. 1, A and B). To determine whether LPL is expressed in the steroid-synthesizing part of the adrenal, RNA was prepared from adult adrenal cortex. RT-PCR analysis demonstrated the presence of LPL mRNA in the human adrenal cortex. Similarly to human adrenal cortex, LPL mRNA could be detected by RT-PCR analysis in the recently characterized human adrenocortical carcinoma cell line, NCI-H295, which actively synthesizes the major adrenal steroids (24Staels B. Hum D.W. Miller W.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 423-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1, A and B). Furthermore, Northern blot analysis of NCI-H295 poly(A+) RNA revealed the existence of three distinct LPL mRNA species (Fig. 1C). In contrast to THP-1 cell LPL mRNA (41Auwerx J. Deeb S. Brunzell J.D. Wolfbauer G. Chait A. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 4563-4567Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), however, the largest LPL mRNA species was clearly the most abundant form in NCI-H295 cells. The resulting PCR products from human adrenal and NCI-H295 cells were cloned in pBluescript and sequence analysis revealed complete identity to the previously published human LPL cDNA (not shown) (18Wion K.L. Kirchgessner T.G. Lusis A.J. Schotz M.C. Lawn R.M. Science. 1987; 235: 1638-1641Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar), thereby confirming that LPL is present both in human fetal and adult adrenal cortex and in NCI-H295 cells. To detect whether LPL protein was present in NCI-H295 cells, three different immunochemical approaches were used. By Western blot analysis of total cell extracts using a specific monoclonal antibody against bovine LPL (5D2) a single band of an apparent molecular mass of 58-60 kDa was detected (Fig. 2A). The electrophoretic mobility of this band was identical to human LPL produced in COS1 cells transfected with the human LPL cDNA and was slightly higher when compared to LPL purified from bovine milk. To identify the cellular distribution of LPL in NCI-H295 cells, immunofluorescence analysis using polyclonal antibodies against human LPL was performed (Fig. 2B). Confocal microscopy analysis of immunofluorescence experiments revealed that LPL staining in NCI-H295 cells was intense and preferentially located in the cell periphery (Fig. 2B), suggesting that at least part of the detected LPL is bound to the cell surface. Parallel experiments using paraformaldehyde-fixed and non-permeabilized cells (not shown), indicated that LPL immunostaining could be detected on the surface of NCI-H295 cells. Flow cytometry analysis of the cell population incubated with the same antibodies used in immunofluorescence experiments further confirmed the presence of LPL in NCI-H295 cells (Fig. 2C). To determine whether LPL is secreted by NCI-H295 cells, LPL activity and mass were determined next in the cell culture medium. LPL activity in the medium increased gradually during a 24-h incubation period (Fig. 3A). This increase was most pronounced when NCI-H295 cells were incubated in the presence of heparin (Fig. 3A), which releases LPL from binding to the cell surface he"

H., Vandekerckhove, J., and Celis, J. E. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 8485-8491) and mouse extendin (Blatch, G. L., Lassle, M., Takatori, T., Gandhi, T., Kundra, V., and Zetter, B. R. (1995) Proc. Am. Assoc. Cancer Res. 36, 68). The human and mouse proteins share 97% sequence identity, and sequencing of 20 polypeptides (225 residues) from RF-hsp 70 reveals only 10 differences between the rabbit and human proteins and 13 differences between the rabbit and mouse proteins (96 and 94% identity, respectively). In addition, all three proteins are of similar size, and each contains 11 cysteines. These findings strongly suggest that these three proteins are homologs of the same activity. All differences (but one) between the human and mouse proteins occur within the amino-terminal half of the protein, and there is only one difference among 121 sequenced residues between RF-hsp 70 and the human or mouse protein which occurs within the carboxyl-terminal 70% of the molecule.

Studies of the initial digestion of RF-hsp 70 by trypsin indicate that it is first converted to 58- and 54-kDa components, each of which is then converted to a 43-kDa polypeptide. This 43-kDa component is located in the human and mouse proteins at position 124 to about 470. It is converted subsequently to a 31-kDa polypeptide by trypsin hydrolysis at position 207. This 31-kDa component is finally split into 17- and 14-kDa polypeptides that are located at positions 208 to approximately 351 and 352 to approximately 470, respectively. The 14-kDa polypeptide is relatively resistant to further digestion with trypsin, and seven tryptic peptides from other parts of RF-hsp 70 contain internal lysine and/or arginine residues (as do several tryptic peptides produced from IEF SSP 3521 and chick p60). Both features may be due to interference with trypsin action by secondary structure in the protein, since trypsinization of reduced and carboxymethylated RF-hsp 70 results in hydrolysis of the 14-kDa polypeptide and reduces the level of peptides that contain internal lysine and/or arginine, although it does not eliminate them.

INTRODUCTIONIn the preceding article (1Gross M. Hessefort S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16833-16841Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) we demonstrated that a 66-kDa protein, purified from rabbit reticulocyte lysate and termed RF-hsp 70, 1The abbreviations used are: hsp 70a member of the 70-kDa heat shock protein familyRF-hsp 70a 66-kDa rabbit reticulocyte protein that recycles hsp 70hsp 90a member of the 90-kDa heat shock protein familyRCM-RF-hsp 70reduced and carboxymethylated RF-hsp 70 promotes the recycling of hsp 70 by increasing the rate of dissociation of hsp 70·ADP in the presence of ATP, thus enhancing the folding activity of hsp 70 as measured by the reactivation of heat-denatured luciferase. We suggested that the recycling role of RF-hsp 70 may be similar to that envisioned for the activities termed DnaJ and GrpE in bacteria (2Liberek K. Marszalek J. Ang D. Georgopoulos C. Zylicz M.

Chem. 1992; 267: 20927-20931Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In an effort to identify RF-hsp 70 and to compare it more precisely with proteins described previously, we subjected RF-hsp 70 to trypsin digestion and the purified peptides to sequence analysis. This has permitted us to demonstrate a very high degree of sequence identity between RF-hsp 70 and several proteins described recently. One is the human protein IEF SSP 3521 (4Honoré B. Leffers H. Madsen P. Rasmussen H.H. Vandekerckhove J. Celis J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8485-8491Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a component that is increased 2-fold in SV40-transformed MRC-5 fibroblasts and has 42% amino acid sequence identity to STI1, a stress-inducible mediator of the heat shock response in yeast (5Nicolet C.M. Craig E.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 3638-3646Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). A second is mouse extendin, whose cDNA was isolated from a M27 mouse Louis lung carcinoma cDNA expression library by screening with an antibody to an actin-associated protein from Dictyostelium (6Blatch G.L. Lassle M. Takatori T. Gandhi T. Kundra V. Zetter B.R. Proc. Am. Assoc. Cancer Res. 1995; 36: 68Google Scholar). Purified recombinant extendin was found to associate with actin, hsp 70, and hsp 90; to localize, in part, to extending cellular pseudopodia; and to have 97% sequence identity to IEF SSP 3521 (6Blatch G.L. Lassle M. Takatori T. Gandhi T. Kundra V. Zetter B.R. Proc. Am. Assoc. Cancer Res. 1995; 36: 68Google Scholar).RESULTSA comparison of the amino acid sequence of multiple tryptic peptides derived from RF-hsp 70 with reported sequence data indicates a striking similarity between RF-hsp 70 and the transformation-sensitive human protein IEF SSP 3521, identified by Honoré et al. (4Honoré B. Leffers H. Madsen P. Rasmussen H.H. Vandekerckhove J. Celis J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8485-8491Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and mouse extendin, identified by Blatch et al. (6Blatch G.L. Lassle M. Takatori T. Gandhi T. Kundra V. Zetter B.R. Proc. Am. Assoc. Cancer Res. 1995; 36: 68Google Scholar). Fig. 1 shows the complete translated amino acid sequences deduced from the cDNAs of the human (4Honoré B. Leffers H. Madsen P. Rasmussen H.H. Vandekerckhove J. Celis J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8485-8491Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and mouse (6Blatch G.L. Lassle M. Takatori T. Gandhi T. Kundra V. Zetter B.R. Proc. Am. Assoc. Cancer Res. 1995; 36: 68Google Scholar) proteins with aligned, partial sequences of tryptic peptides derived from RF-hsp 70 (see “Experimental Procedures”). Fig. 1 also includes partial sequences derived from gel-purified IEF SSP 3521 (4Honoré B. Leffers H. Madsen P. Rasmussen H.H. Vandekerckhove J. Celis J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8485-8491Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and from gel-purified chick oviduct p60 (9Smith D.F. Sullivan W.P. Marion T.N. Zaitsu K. Madden B. McCormick D.J. Toft D.O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 869-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). The latter protein immunopurifies with hsp 90 and hsp 70, is found in certain assembly complexes of chick progesterone receptor, and shows 70% sequence identity to IEF SSP 3521 (9Smith D.F. Sullivan W.P. Marion T.N. Zaitsu K. Madden B. McCormick D.J. Toft D.O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 869-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 10Smith D.F. Stensgard B.A. Welch W.J. Toft D.O.

The data in Fig. 1 demonstrate that the amino acid sequence of 20 tryptic peptides (225 residues) from RF-hsp 70 differs from that of the translated cDNA of human IEF SSP 3521 in only 10 positions and from that of mouse extendin at only 13 sites, corresponding to a sequence identity (to 41% of the total protein) of 96 and 94%, respectively. This strongly suggests that RF-hsp 70 is the homolog of the human and mouse proteins in rabbit reticulocytes. Interestingly, all differences (but one at position 209) between RF-hsp 70 and the human and mouse proteins occur within the amino-terminal 30% of the protein so that there is 100% identity (99% to mouse) between 121 residues from position 162 to the carboxyl terminus, position 543. In addition, all differences (but one) between the human and mouse proteins, which show 97% sequence identity to each other, occur within the amino-terminal half of the protein. When the degree of identity to the human protein of RF-hsp 70 and chick p60 (9Smith D.F. Sullivan W.P. Marion T.N. Zaitsu K. Madden B. McCormick D.J. Toft D.O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 869-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar) partial sequences is expressed as a function of the distance from the amino terminus (Fig. 2), both proteins show the greatest difference with the human protein within the amino-terminal portion of the protein and the greatest similarity within the carboxyl-terminal portion. A similar result is obtained when the sequence of mouse extendin is used for comparison. One exception to this is the fact that all four proteins are identical to each other at positions 84-90, and RF-hsp 70 and the human and mouse proteins are identical at positions 78-118 except for differences at positions 104 and 106. It is also of interest that where p60 sequences overlap the differences between RF-hsp 70 and the human protein (positions 13, 17, 24, 25, and 145), the rabbit and chick proteins are the same (Fig. 1). Overall, RF-hsp 70 and the chick p60 partial sequences overlap a total of 54 residues that show 78% identity (Fig. 1). Thus, from the data available, RF-hsp 70 shows much greater sequence identity to human IEF SSP 3521 and mouse extendin than does chick p60, whereas chick p60 shows about the same degree of sequence identity to RF-hsp 70 (78%) as it does to IEF SSP 3521 and mouse extendin (70%).Fig. 2Degree of identity to human IEF SSP 3521 of partial polypeptide sequences from RF-hsp 70 and chick oviduct p60 as a function of distance from the amino terminus of IEF SSP 3521. The percent identity to IEF SSP 3521 of polypeptides from RF-hsp 70 (open circles) or chick oviduct p60 (closed circles) has been plotted at their location within the human protein. Polypeptides containing 7-17 residues have been given a single data point; one containing 25 residues has two points; and two with 35 and 36 residues, respectively, have three points.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We also subjected RF-hsp 70 to amino acid compositional analysis and compared the result with the amino acid composition of IEF SSP 3521 and mouse extendin as deduced from the translation of each cDNA. The results (Table I) demonstrate that the three proteins have a very similar composition. In addition, many of the small differences reflect the known substitutions between RF-hsp 70 and the human and mouse proteins shown in Fig. 1. For example, these substitutions would result in two additional arginines and alanines, two fewer lysines, and three less aspartic acids plus asparagines in RF-hsp 70 when compared with IEF SSP 3521. They would also result in three additional arginines, two more valines, and two fewer leucines in RF-hsp 70 when compared with mouse extendin. In each instance, these substitutions correlate with differences in amino acid composition (Table I). It should also be noted that each protein has 11 cysteines, an amino acid that is not readily identified by sequence analysis. In addition, all cysteines are located identically in the human and mouse proteins, and at least three cysteines appear to be located identically in RF-hsp 70, since no amino acid was identified at three sites in RF-hsp 70 (presumptive cysteines) which would match cysteines at positions 62, 370, and 471 in IEF SSP 3521 and mouse extendin (Fig. 1).Table IAmino acid composition of RF-hsp 70,#human IEF SSP 3521,#and mouse extendinAmino acidResidues inAmino acidResidues inRF-hsp 70IEF SSP 3521ExtendinRF-hsp 70IEF SSP 3521ExtendinAsx626667Met131817Thr182017Ile212119Ser171818Leu495153Glx878385Tyr232928Pro303030Phe111111Gly232020His1199Ala565153Lys616362Val171414Arg312728Cys111111Trp111(Total)542543543 Open table in a new tab Chromatographic separation of the products produced by trypsin digestion of RF-hsp 70 demonstrates a large peak eluting at 38% acetonitrile, considerably later than the other peptide peaks and close to the elution position (at 39.5% acetonitrile) of undigested RF-hsp 70 (data not shown). We sequenced this tryptic product through 35 cycles and found it to correspond to positions 352-386 in IEF SSP 3521 and mouse extendin (Fig. 1). Since no carboxyl terminus was identified, we analyzed this polypeptide by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Fig. 3A, lane 4) and found it to migrate similar to α-lactalbumin (14.4 kDa) (Fig. 3A, lane 2), suggesting a molecular mass of about 14 kDa. This size suggests that the 14-kDa polypeptide extends from position 352 to 470 (arginine in IEF SSP 3521) or 119 amino acids in length. Consistent with this possibility, no other peptide from RF-hsp 70 was isolated from this region of the protein. Electrophoresis of RF-hsp 70, following incubation with the same concentration of trypsin (0.05 mg/ml) as used for the preparative isolation of peptides for sequence analysis, shows that within 1 h there is complete conversion of the 66-kDa protein to the 14-kDa polypeptide and smaller products (Fig. 3A, lane 5). The 14-kDa component is stable to further incubation with trypsin for 3 and 8.5 h (Fig. 3A, lanes 6 and 7). The 14-kDa polypeptide is not completely resistant to trypsin, since its stability to prolonged trypsinization varies somewhat with different RF-hsp 70 preparations (data not shown), and it is hydrolyzed slowly when RF-hsp 70 is incubated with more concentrated trypsin (Fig. 3B, lane 9). Quantitation of the 14-kDa polypeptide, using staining following gel electrophoresis, absorbance at 215 nm, and pmol of amino acids produced when subjected to sequence analysis, indicates that its yield from RF-hsp 70 is approximately 50-80%. These findings indicate that RF-hsp 70 has a 14-kDa polypeptide core that is relatively resistant to a concentration of trypsin which hydrolyzes the remainder of the protein rapidly. This resistance is not due to a lack of tryptic hydrolytic sites in the 14-kDa core, since it has multiple lysine and arginine residues (Fig. 1). In addition, when RF-hsp 70 was digested for 17 h with 0.02 mg/ml trypsin, chymotrypsin, endoproteinase Glu-C, or endoproteinase Lys-C, the 14-kDa band was only seen following digestion with trypsin (Fig. 3B), indicating that it had been hydrolyzed to smaller polypeptides by the other three proteases. Much briefer digestions have indicated that components of about 14 kDa are formed by incubating RF-hsp 70 with chymotrypsin or endoproteinase Lys-C, but they are only transiently stable (data not shown).One possible explanation for the stability of the 14-kDa component to trypsin is that some lysine and arginine residues have undergone post-translational modification, rendering them resistant to cleavage. This explanation would require that such modifications be reversed by the conditions imposed by the amino acid sequence analysis. It also would require that the postulated modification(s) of lysine still permit recognition and cleavage by endoproteinase Lys-C, since this protease hydrolyzes the 14-kDa component of RF-hsp 70 (Fig. 3B). An alternative explanation is that native RF-hsp 70 possesses sufficient secondary structure that its 14-kDa component is rendered relatively inaccessible to trypsin, although not to the other proteases examined. To test this possibility, we reduced and carboxymethylated a sample of RF-hsp 70 and compared its sensitivity to trypsin with that of native RF-hsp 70. We found that trypsin readily hydrolyzes the 14-kDa component in RCM-RF-hsp 70, but not in RF-hsp 70, when analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Fig. 3B, lanes 10 and 11) or reverse-phase chromatography (the large peak eluting at 38% acetonitrile is removed; data not shown). As noted previously (Table I), RF-hsp 70, IEF SSP 3521, and mouse extendin have 11 cysteines each, and 7 of these in the human and mouse proteins occur within or near the region corresponding to the 14-kDa component in RF-hsp 70 (Fig. 1). This result suggests that the 14-kDa core in RF-hsp 70 is relatively resistant to trypsin because of protein folding that may be dependent upon the presence of one or more intramolecular disulfide bonds. Intermolecular disulfides are not involved, since complexes between RF-hsp 70 molecules are not observed when this protein is analyzed by density gradient centrifugation, as shown in the preceding article (1Gross M. Hessefort S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16833-16841Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar).Characterization of the 14-kDa component prompted us to examine the cleavage of RF-hsp 70 by trypsin at earlier times of incubation to determine whether there is discrete processing of this protein. The results in Fig. 4, Fig. 5 demonstrate that this does occur. When incubated with 0.005 mg/ml trypsin, the 66-kDa band of RF-hsp 70 (Fig. 4, lane 2) is reduced by about one-half after approximately 30 s and is almost completely removed after 2 min (Fig. 4, lanes 4-8). It is converted into 58- and 54-kDa components that are formed in approximately equal amounts. These two components are produced at the same time, becoming maximal after 1 min of digestion (Fig. 4, lane 6) and almost completely disappearing after 3.5-5 min (Fig. 4, lanes 9 and 10). The 58- and 54-kDa components are each converted to a 43-kDa product, since this 43-kDa component is almost the only band on the gel after 5 min of digestion (Fig. 4, lane 10), and its staining intensity at this time is close to that predicted if all 66-kDa protein is converted to the 43-kDa polypeptide. To localize the 43-kDa component within the intact 66-kDa protein, a scaled up trypsin digestion of RF-hsp 70, as shown in Fig. 4, was stopped after 5 min and fractionated by reverse-phase chromatography as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The largest peak, eluting at 37% acetonitrile, showed only the 43-kDa band when a small aliquot was subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and silver staining (Fig. 4, lane 13). Amino-terminal sequence analysis of this polypeptide (through seven cycles) corresponds to positions 124-130 in IEF SSP 3521, but with valine substituting for phenylalanine at position 124, as noted in the sequencing of a peptide eluting at 19.5% acetonitrile which was isolated by reverse-phase chromatography of an 18-h trypsin digest of RF-hsp 70 (Fig. 1). Its estimated molecular size from SDS-gel electrophoresis suggests that the 43-kDa component extends from position 124 to about 470 in IEF SSP 3521 and mouse extendin, implying that the 14-kDa component characterized above would comprise the carboxyl-terminal portion of the 43-kDa polypeptide. This is confirmed by the additional digestion and sequencing that is indicated below. This result indicates that the 58- and 54-kDa components are formed from the 66-kDa protein by trypsin hydrolysis at positions 470 and 123, respectively, in IEF SSP 3521 and mouse extendin. The 58- and 54-kDa components would then each be converted to the 43-kDa polypeptide by hydrolysis at positions 123 and 470, respectively. If the 58- and 54-kDa components were formed by trypsin hydrolysis at about positions 73 or 77 and 123, respectively, another intermediate of about 47 kDa should occur, and this is not detected (Fig. 4). Formation of the 58- and 54-kDa components by hydrolysis at about positions 470 and 415 or 428, respectively, is precluded, since this is inconsistent with the formation of the 14-kDa component characterized above and would require that the 43-kDa polypeptide extend from position 124 to about 415 or 428, a length of only 291-304 residues.When incubated with 0.05 mg/ml trypsin, the 66-, 58-, and 54-kDa components are removed completely within the first 20 s of trypsinization, and the 43-kDa polypeptide is the major product (Fig. 5, lanes 2 and 4). The 43-kDa polypeptide is converted relatively quickly into a 31-kDa polypeptide that becomes maximal at about 2 min of trypsinization (Fig. 5, lanes 8 and 13). Finally, as the 31-kDa polypeptide disappears, it appears to be split into 17- and 14-kDa polypeptides (Fig. 5, lanes 13 and 14). The 17-kDa band is only transiently stable in this digestion (Fig. 5, lanes 13-16), but it is partially stable for a much longer time in digests of another preparation of RF-hsp 70 used for the preparative isolation of tryptic peptides for sequence analysis (see Fig. 3B, lanes 3, 10, and 14). Reverse-phase chromatography of such digests has revealed a large absorbance peak eluting at 34% acetonitrile which corresponds to the 17-kDa polypeptide, as identified by gel electrophoresis of this component (data not shown). In addition, reduction and carboxymethylation of RF-hsp 70 eliminates the relative resistance to trypsin hydrolysis of the 17-kDa polypeptide, as observed for the 14-kDa polypeptide (Fig. 3B, lanes 10 and 11). The 17-kDa polypeptide could only be sequenced through 10 cycles (because of a low yield in the sequenator), but the sequence corresponds exactly to positions 208-217 in IEF SSP 3521 and mouse extendin (Fig. 1). Its molecular size suggests that the 17-kDa component extends from position 208 to 351, an arginine in the human and mouse proteins (although it could terminate at a tryptic site located slightly more amino-terminally), which would be continuous with the amino terminus of the 14-kDa polypeptide that extends from position 352 to, approximately, 470. Since the kinetics of trypsin digestion in Fig. 5 show that as the 31-kDa band disappears the 17- and 14-kDa bands emerge (lanes 13-15), the results strongly suggest that the 31-kDa band represents positions 208-470. Formation of the 31-kDa polypeptide from the 43-kDa polypeptide would then occur by cleavage at positions 206-207 (lysines in the human and mouse proteins). The relative sensitivity to trypsin hydrolysis of this site in the 43-kDa polypeptide, when compared with the relative stability of the 17- and 14-kDa components derived from the 43-kDa polypeptide, suggests that the region adjacent to and including this site may be particularly exposed to proteolytic attack. This may be related to the run of four glutamic acids (at positions 192-195) and seven prolines (at positions 199-205) which immediately precede lysines at 206 and 207 (Fig. 1). In contrast to the effect of trypsin and other proteases (Figs. 3, 4, 5), RF-hsp 70 is completely stable to incubation by itself for 17 h at 34°C (data not shown).The digestions in Fig. 5 also show the formation of relatively small amounts of 40- and 23-kDa bands (lanes 4-8 and 13). They appear to be formed in about equal amounts when the contribution of trypsin, which also migrates as a 23-kDa band (Fig. 5, lanes 3, 11, 12, and 17), is subtracted. The 40-kDa component disappears at the same time the 43-kDa component is removed, whereas the 23-kDa component is transiently stable (Fig. 5). One explanation for these findings is that the 40- and 23-kDa components may be generated in an alternative and minor trypsin digestion pathway by initial hydrolysis of the 66-kDa protein at positions 206-207. The 40-kDa component may then be converted to the 31-kDa component by hydrolysis at position 470. Other explanations are also possible. These 40- and 23-kDa bands are not formed at detectable levels when RF-hsp 70 is digested with one-tenth the trypsin concentration (Fig. 4).We have also noted the presence of internal lysine and/or arginine residues in seven tryptic peptides derived from RF-hsp 70 exclusive of the 14- and 17-kDa polypeptides (see Fig. 1). This does not appear to be due to limiting trypsinization conditions, since these peptides are produced in high yield and are at least as abundant after 18 h as after 8.5 h of trypsin digestion (data not shown). In addition, none of these is of exceptional length, in contrast to the 14- and 17-kDa polypeptides, since six were sequenced through the carboxyl terminus (and are 9, 10, 10, 10, 16, and 16 amino acids in length, respectively), whereas the seventh is, at most, 28 amino acids long. Furthermore, this phenomenon is not limited to RF-hsp 70 and our trypsinization conditions, since the partial amino acid sequences of chick p60 obtained by Smith et al. (9Smith D.F. Sullivan W.P. Marion T.N. Zaitsu K. Madden B. McCormick D.J. Toft D.O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 869-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar) and of IEF SSP 3521 obtained by Honoré et al. (4Honoré B. Leffers H. Madsen P. Rasmussen H.H. Vandekerckhove J. Celis J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8485-8491Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) also show tryptic peptides that contain internal lysine or arginine (Fig. 1). We have summarized these data in Table II, excluding the 14- and 17-kDa components of RF-hsp 70. The results demonstrate that internal lysine and arginine residues occur in tryptic peptides from all three proteins and that these internal tryptic sites occur almost as frequently as carboxyl-terminal lysine and arginine residues. In the case of RF-hsp 70, lysine is more often internal than carboxyl-terminal, whereas arginine is more often carboxyl-terminal than internal (Table II). In addition, as can be seen in Fig. 1, peptides with internal tryptic sites are derived from approximately all regions of the protein. Where there are overlapping tryptic polypeptide sequences among the three proteins, there appears to be some correlation in the location of these internal sites. For example, there is an internal arginine at position 87 in RF-hsp 70 and p60, an internal lysine at position 210 in RF-hsp 70 and IEF SSP 3521, and an internal lysine at position 317 in RF-hsp 70 and p60, although arginine in position 153 is internal in p60 but carboxyl-terminal in RF-hsp 70 (Fig. 1). In addition, carboxyl-terminal sites in tryptic peptides also overlap: lysine at position 109 in RF-hsp 70 and IEF SSP 3521; arginine at position 160 in RF-hsp 70 and p60; and lysine at position 325 in RF-hsp 70 and p60 (Fig. 1). These findings suggest that there may be similarities in structural organization among these three proteins.Table IIFrequency of internal and carboxyl-terminal lysine and arginine residues in tryptic peptides generated from RF-hsp 70,#chick oviduct p60, and human IEF SSP 3521#Protein sourceInternalCarboxyl terminusLysineArginineLysineArginineRF-hsp 708166Chick oviduct p602212Human IEF SSP 35211130 Open table in a new tab We tested whether trypsin-resistant lysine and arginine residues might occur at multiple sites in RF-hsp 70 because of protection aff"

INTRODUCTIONIndividuals with sickle cell anemia are homozygous for a mutant form of hemoglobin (Hb S) 1The abbreviations used are: HbhemoglobinrHbrecombinant Hbbis-Tris2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)-propane-1,3-diol. in which Glu at the β6 position is replaced by Val. This substitution is responsible for the abnormally low solubility of deoxy-Hb S. Molecules of Hb S in the deoxygenated T structure associate into long helical fibers that deform the erythrocytes and severely diminish their lifetime. Electron microscopy (1Rodgers D.W. Crépeau R.H.

Chem. 1985; 260: 8272-8279Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have shown that both fibers and crystals are composed of double strands of Hb S molecules. The formation of the double strands requires the stereochemical contact between complementary surfaces involving specifically the Val-β6 and a hydrophobic pocket on an adjacent molecule (lateral contact).In order to further characterize the interactions at the key β6 site, particularly the role of hydrophobicity, it is useful to consider the effects of other amino acid side chains on fiber formation. Gelation studies of deoxygenated mixtures of S and non-S Hbs have provided considerable information about the location of intermolecular contacts in the polymer fibers (4Bookchin R. Nagel R.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1971; 60: 263-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). More recently, studies of recombinant Hbs modified at the fiber contacts have shown that the presence of the hydrophobic leucine or isoleucine residues at the β6 position could also initiate the polymerization process (5Baudin-Chich V. Pagnier J. Marden M. Bohn B. Lacaze N. Kister J. Schaad O. Edelstein S.J. Poyart C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1845-1849Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 6Adachi K. Rappaport E. Eck H.S. Konitzer P. Kim J. Surrey S. Hemoglobin. 1991; 15: 417-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar).In normal Hb A, the residue Glu-β6(A3) is followed by two other charged amino acids, Glu-β7(A4) and Lys-β8(A5). Two natural Hb variants have been described at the β7(A4) position, Hb San Jose and Hb Siriraj, in which Glu-β7 is replaced by Gly and Lys, respectively (7Roth Jr., E.F. Shiliro G. Elbaum D. Musumeci S. Pizzarelli G. Russo G. Nagel R.L. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1977; 90: 837-843PubMed Google Scholar, 8Rhoda M.D. Arous N. Garel M. Mazarin M. Monplaisir N. Braconnier F. Rosa J. Cohen-Solal M. Galacteros F. Hemoglobin. 1986; 10: 21-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). In mixtures with Hb S (trans effect), none of these mutated Hbs has been shown to alter the polymerization process (8Rhoda M.D. Arous N. Garel M. Mazarin M. Monplaisir N. Braconnier F. Rosa J. Cohen-Solal M. Galacteros F. Hemoglobin. 1986; 10: 21-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). The replacement of Glu-β7(A4) for Gly in Hb San Jose results in the loss of a charged residue without introducing a nonpolar side chain. We have associated the Glu-β6(A3) → Val and Glu-β7(A4) → Ala mutations on the same β chain (rHb βE6V/E7A) in order to study the interaction of a hydrophobic β7(A4) side chain, cis to the active residue Val-β6(A3). We have also engineered the single mutant Hb Glu-α2β27(A4) → Ala-(rHb βE7A) as a control.MATERIALS AND METHODSThe βE6V and βE7A mutations were introduced into the β-globin cDNA by site-directed mutagenesis using synthetic primers (Genset, France). The mutated β-globin subunit was produced as a fusion protein in Escherichia coli, using the expression vector pATPrcIIFXβ (9Bihoreau M.T. Baudin V. Marden M. Lacaze N. Bohn B. Kister J. Schaad O. Dumoulin A. Edelstein S.J. Poyart C. Pagnier J. Protein Sci. 1992; 1: 145-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). After extraction and purification, the fusion protein was cleaved by digestion with bovine coagulation factor Xa (10Nagai K. Thøgersen H.C. Nature. 1984; 309: 810-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). The presence of the mutation(s) was confirmed by reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography of the tryptic digests and amino acid analysis of the abnormal peptides. The purified β-subunits were folded in the presence of cyanhemin and the partner α-subunits, prepared from natural Hb A, to form the tetrameric Hb α2β2 (9Bihoreau M.T. Baudin V. Marden M. Lacaze N.

Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 7252-7255Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Electrophoretic studies included electrophoresis on cellulose acetate and isoelectrofocusing of the recombinant Hbs. Fluorescence studies of the rHbs were performed at a concentration of 10 µM on a heme basis, in 10 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, using an SLM 8000 spectrofluorometer. Fluorescence spectra were measured in the region for tyrosine and tryptophan emission, for air-equilibrated samples. The heat stability of the Hbs was determined by incubating the recombinant and native Hbs at 65°C in 10 mM phosphate buffer pH 7.0 according to Wajcman et al. (12Wajcman H. Elion J. Labie D. Nouv. Rev. Fr. Hematol. 1973; 13: 89-94PubMed Google Scholar) at 0.1 mM heme under 1 atm of CO or 1 atm of O2.The oxygen binding curves were recorded at 25°C with a continuous method using the Hemox Analyzer system (TCS, Huntington Valley, PA) (13Kister J. Poyart C. Edelstein S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 12085-12091Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The Hb samples were in 0.05 M bis-Tris buffer, pH 7.2, 0.1 M NaCl, 50 µM EDTA, 20 µg/ml catalase. Hb concentration was 60-70 µM (on a heme basis). Met-Hb content, calculated from the visible absorption spectra was found to be less than 5% at the end of the recordings.Bimolecular recombination of CO was studied after flash photolysis dissociation with 10-ns pulses at 532 nm. Detection was at 436 nm for samples equilibrated under 0.1 atm of CO (14Marden M.C. Kister J. Bohn B. Poyart C. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 1659-1664Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Measurements were made at different concentrations to study the dimer-tetramer equilibrium (15Andersen M.E. Gibson Q.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 4790-4799Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For concentrations above 30 µM (on a heme basis) 1-mm optical cuvettes were used. Below 30 µM, cuvettes of dimension 4 × 10 mm were used with detection along the 10-mm axis and dissociation at 90° along the 4-mm axis.Kinetic studies of the polymerization of mutant deoxy-Hbs were carried out in concentrated potassium phosphate buffer, for different Hb concentrations, following initiation by a temperature jump (0 → 30°C). The solubility and the kinetics of polymerization of the mutated Hb were compared to those of native Hb S. Under these conditions, the assembly of Hb S into fibers results, after a characteristic lag period, in a cooperative increase in turbidity (measured by the absorbance at 700 nm) until a plateau was achieved. The Hb solubility (Csat) was determined by measuring the concentration of the soluble phase after completion of the polymerization process (16Adachi K. Asakura T. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 7765-7771Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Poyart C. Bohn B. Bursaux E. Guesnon P. Nouv. Rev. Fr. Hematol. 1981; 23: 17-25Google Scholar).Molecular graphics models of deoxy-Hb βE7A were performed starting from the crystallographic coordinates of the deoxy structure of Hb A (file 3HHB, Protein Data Bank, Brookhaven National Laboratory) reported by Fermi et al. (18Fermi G. Perutz M.F. Shaanan B. Fourme R. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 174: 159-174Crossref Scopus (671) Google Scholar). Minimization of the potential energy in the mutant and normal Hbs were performed using the CHARMM™ program (version 22) (19Brooks B.R. Bruccoleri R.E. Olafson B.D. States D.J. Swaminathan S. Karplus M. J. Comp. Chem. 1983; 4: 187-217Crossref Scopus (13844) Google Scholar) with a Silicon Graphics Indigo workstation. The mutated residue was initially minimized holding the rest of the structure constant, by starting with a high harmonic constant that was progressively decreased to 0.RESULTSReverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography of the tryptic digest of the purified fusion proteins βE7A or βE6V/E7A revealed the presence of an abnormal peptide. Amino acid analysis of these two peptides confirmed the presence of the expected mutation(s). Reassembled tetramers showed visible absorption spectra identical to those of native Hb A and S in their deoxy and liganded forms. Fluorescence studies did not show significant differences between the two mutated rHbs and native Hb A, indicating correct refolding of the recombinant Hbs.Electrophoretic StudiesCellulose acetate electrophoresis and isoelectrofocusing (Fig. 1) of the purified rHbs βE7A and βE6V/E7A showed a single band migrating at isoelectric points of 7.1 and 7.4, respectively. These values are lower than those observed for Hb S and Hb C with pI at 7.2 and 7.5, respectively. The electrophoretic pattern of βE7A compared to Hb S was similar to that described by Yamashiro et al. (20Yamashiro D.J. Adachi M. Konitzer P. Surrey S. Adachi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23996-23999Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) for the rHb βE7V. The natural mutated Hbs Siriraj βE7K and San-Jose βE7G, also exhibited anomalous electrophoretic mobilities compared to those of Hb C βE6K and Hb S βE6V (8Rhoda M.D. Arous N. Garel M. Mazarin M. Monplaisir N. Braconnier F. Rosa J. Cohen-Solal M. Galacteros F. Hemoglobin. 1986; 10: 21-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). This may be explained by the fact that the β7(A4) residue is partially buried within the molecule, while β6(A3) is exposed.Heat stability of the oxy form of the mutated rHbs was compared to those of human Hbs A and S. We did not observe any difference between oxy-Hb A and oxy-Hb S, while both mutants precipitated rapidly. After 10 min incubation at 65°C, 80% of the mutated oxy-rHbs were denatured, relative to 10-15% for oxy-Hbs A and S. While the CO forms of Hb A and S are stable at this temperature, 15% of the mutated rHbs were denatured after 10 min incubation at 65°C under CO. Yamashiro et al. (20Yamashiro D.J. Adachi M. Konitzer P. Surrey S. Adachi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23996-23999Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) also observed a marked instability of the rHb βE7V, either under heat or mechanical stress. The mutant oxy-Hb San Jose, βE7G, was slightly more heat unstable than oxy-Hb A, while mechanical precipitation rates were similar to those observed for oxy-Hb S (7Roth Jr., E.F. Shiliro G. Elbaum D. Musumeci S. Pizzarelli G. Russo G. Nagel R.L. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1977; 90: 837-843PubMed Google Scholar). The other naturally occurring mutant Hb Siriraj, βE7K, is expressed at only 30-35% in heterozygous patients, which is likely due to its instability as shown by isopropanol test (8Rhoda M.D. Arous N. Garel M. Mazarin M. Monplaisir N. Braconnier F. Rosa J. Cohen-Solal M. Galacteros F. Hemoglobin. 1986; 10: 21-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Thus, all the substitutions described at the β7 position, Gly, Ala, Val, or Lys for Glu, result in instability of the mutated Hb tetramer. It is worth noting that the effect of the mutation is independent of the charge or the stericity of the side chain in promoting the Hb instability.Functional StudiesThe oxygen equilibrium curves showed a lower P50 (partial pressure for half saturation) and reduced cooperativity for both rHbs βE7A and βE6V/E7A relative to native Hb A. Since it is known that the ligand-binding properties of Hb S are similar to that of Hb A, the functional abnormalities could be attributed to the βE7A mutation. The shift to lower P50 values could be due to a change in the tetramer ligand binding parameters, or to an increase in dimer contribution (21Ackers G.K. Doyle M.L. Myers D. Daugherty M.A. Science. 1992; 255: 54-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). The shape of the oxygen equilibrium binding curves suggested an increased amount of dimers.CO recombination kinetics for the rHb βE6V/E7A are shown in Fig. 2. As for Hb A, two bimolecular phases were observed, corresponding globally to the two tetramer conformations. The slow phase is unique to deoxy or T-state tetramers, since the dimers show only the rapid R-like phase. The slow phase is best observed at high dissociation levels where a significant amount of deoxy and singly liganded forms are produced. Under these conditions, the rate of recombination for the T-like phase was faster by a factor of 1.3 for the double mutant relative to Hb A. As the laser intensity is lowered in order to decrease the fraction dissociation, the kinetic curves show more of the rapid phase, since the reaction is then dominated by the transition R3 to R4. The curves in Fig. 2 are normalized to better show the change in the fraction of slow recombination. Compared to Hb A, the double mutant shows less slow phase; even after correction for dimers, there is a slight decrease in the amount of slow phase. The rapid phase had the same recombination rate for Hb A and the double mutant. The oxygen equilibrium curves were therefore analyzed with a model including the dimer contribution (22Edelstein S.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1975; 44: 209-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The resulting parameters for the tetramer fraction of the rHb βE6V/E7A are then more similar to those of Hb A. There is still a decrease in KT and therefore in P50. This is consistent with the kinetic results which showed a faster rate of recombination for the slow (T-state) phase.Fig. 2Recombination of CO to Hb A and rHb βE6V/E7A (bold lines). Three levels of photodissociation are shown; all curves are normalized to better show the fraction of slow phase. At the lowest dissociation level, the reaction is mainly from triply to fully liganded forms and occurs with the rapid rate for both Hbs. The slow phase, typical of binding to deoxy-Hb, increases at higher dissociation levels. The double mutant displays less of the slow phase, in part due to an elevated dimer contribution, as described in Fig. 3. Conditions: 50 mM phosphate buffer at pH 7, 25°C, 100 µM (in heme) for Hb A, and 300 µM for the mutant rHb.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)As the protein concentration is lowered, the dimer contribution increased as evidenced by a loss of the slow (T-like) kinetics. This normally occurs near 1 µM (total heme) for Hb A at pH 7 and it is therefore difficult to observe a full dimerization of Hb A due to the small signal size. However, at higher pH values, or for systems with higher dimer levels, this technique allows one to rapidly demonstrate a concentration dependence of the ligand binding properties (15Andersen M.E. Gibson Q.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 4790-4799Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The results for the double mutant βE6V/E7A are shown in Fig. 3. Compared to the maximum concentration of 300 µM, the amount of slow phase decreases by a factor of 2 near 15 µM. This would correspond to a value of K42 = (dimer)2/(tetramer) of about 10 µM, an order of magnitude larger than for Hb A.Fig. 3Recombination of CO to rHb βE6V/E7A at different protein concentrations, shown on a heme basis in µM. As the protein concentration is lowered, a lower fraction of slow phase is observed, since dimers show only the rapid phase.

Fig. 4 illustrates the variations of ΔA700 as a function of time after the temperature jump. In these conditions, the rHb βE7A did not polymerize at concentration up to 2.7 g/liter. The maximum absorbance at 700 nm for the βE6V/E7A mutant was lower than for Hb S, while the delay time was slightly longer. The Csat value for the double mutant was not significantly different from that of natural Hb S (Fig. 5). The dependence of the delay time of polymerization on the total concentration of deoxy-Hb was also similar for both rHb βE6V/E7A and Hb S, indicating a similar nucleation process for the two Hbs. For both Hbs, the aggregation process was reversible in the presence of CO and in ice water. The variation of the turbidity as a function of the initial Hb concentration for the βE6V/E7A mutant was constantly lower than that recorded for Hb S. This is possibly due to a smaller polymer fraction or to qualitatively different polymers or aggregates.Fig. 4Polymerization of deoxy-Hb S and deoxy-rHb βE6V/E7A. Kinetics of the polymerization of the deoxy-Hbs in 1.8 M phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, were studied by the temperature jump method at 30°C.

Conditions were as described in the legend of Fig. 4.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)DISCUSSIONIn native Hb A, the Glu-β7(A4) residue forms an intrachain salt bridge with the Lys-β132(H10) in both R- and T-state structures (23Fermi G. Perutz M.F. Philips D.C. Richard F.M. Atlas of Molecular Structure in Biology. Clarendon Press, Oxford1981: 56-57Google Scholar). One may attribute the high oxygen affinity of the two mutated rHbs to the loss of this salt bridge, resulting in the formation of a cavity between the A and H helices, as illustrated in Fig. 6. These structural changes may induce a relaxation of the T structure when Glu is replaced by Ala. However, this interpretation is not consistent with the fact that Hb San Jose exhibits functional properties identical to those of Hb A (7Roth Jr., E.F. Shiliro G. Elbaum D. Musumeci S. Pizzarelli G. Russo G. Nagel R.L. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1977; 90: 837-843PubMed Google Scholar). In this natural mutant Hb, the presence of a Gly residue at the βE7 position is likely responsible for similar structural consequences compared to what is observed in the presence of Ala; none of these residues allows the formation of a salt bridge, and Gly is smaller than Ala. Thus, these structural modifications are not sufficient to account for the high oxygen affinity of the rHb βE7A. The data of Yamashiro et al. (20Yamashiro D.J. Adachi M. Konitzer P. Surrey S. Adachi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23996-23999Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) also do not support the importance of the small size of the β7 residue such as Gly or Ala, because the substitution of Val-β7 for Glu slightly increased the oxygen affinity. The authors suggested that “the hydrophobic side chain of Val-β7 may cause a conformational change in helix A and/or affect the linkage between helices A and H compared with Gly-β7” (20Yamashiro D.J. Adachi M. Konitzer P. Surrey S. Adachi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23996-23999Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our results are in agreement with this interpretation. One may speculate that due to the location of the β7(A4)-β132(H10) normal salt bridge, close to the α1-β1 interface, its rupture may favor the dissociation of the tetramer. This has been confirmed by kinetics of CO rebinding to the photodissociated mutant rHb βE6V/E7A.Fig. 6Schematic representation of the region delimited by the A and H helices in the deoxy structures of the minimized Hb mutant βE7A and Hb A. These structures were obtained after potential energy minimization using the CHARMM™ program. In deoxy-Hb A, the oxygen atom of the β7 glutamic carboxylate group is located at 2.0 Å from the lysine β132 ammonium group. This allows the formation of an intrachain salt bridge between the A and H helices. The replacement of the glutamic residue by alanine does not allow the formation of the salt bridge and induces a displacement of the lysine β132 away from the A helix.

Geis I. Hagopian P. Hemoglobin: Structure, Function, Evolution, and Pathology. The Benjamin Cummings Publishing Co. Inc., Menlo Park, CA1983: 118Google Scholar). Information on the location of intermolecular contacts in the polymer have been obtained by studying the in vitro and in vivo interactions of Hb S and natural Hb mutants (4Bookchin R. Nagel R.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1971; 60: 263-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Both Hbs San Jose and Siriraj behave like deoxy-Hb A when interacting with deoxy-Hb S (7Roth Jr., E.F. Shiliro G. Elbaum D.

These results excluded either the inhibition or the potentiation of polymerization by the substitutions Gly-β7 or Lys for Glu in the trans position, which is compatible with the fact that the β7 residue in trans is not involved in the specific lateral contact stabilizing the deoxy-Hb S polymer. Our results show that when associated in cis to the sickle mutation the substitution Glu-β7(A4) → Ala does not increase the hydrophobic interaction between donor and acceptor site, but leads to a decrease in the maximum change in absorption at 700 nm (Fig. 4). The fact that the value of Csat is the same for the rHb βE6V/E7A and Hb S suggests that the polymer size is different. The positioning of the A helix is of crucial importance in the adjustment of the donor and acceptor sites. The comparison of the backbone of the β subunit of deoxy-Hb S which contains the Val-β6 involved in the lateral contact with that of deoxy-Hb A, shows that the main difference is a shift in the A helix (24Dickerson R.E.

Protein Chem. 1990; 40: 63-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). It has been shown that Hb Leiden, in which one of the Glu-A3 or −A4 residues is deleted, inhibits the polymerization of deoxy-Hb S; shortening the A helix and moving the Pro-β5 may perturb the adjustment of the donor and the acceptor sites (26Nagel R.L. Rieder R.F. Bookchin R.M. James G.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1973; 53: 1240-1245Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The βE7A mutation results in the loss of the Glu-β7-Lys-β132 salt bridge which would render the A helix softer (Fig. 6). As a result the β6 Val residue would not not fit well in the EF pocket and the formation of the polymers would be delayed. In this regard, the role of the Glu-β7-Lys-β132 salt bridge in the properties of the two rHb βE7A and βE6V/E7A described in this report will be of major interest for the development of therapeutic agents.

This substitution is responsible for the abnormally low solubility of deoxy-Hb S. Molecules of Hb S in the deoxygenated T structure associate into long helical fibers that deform the erythrocytes and severely diminish their lifetime. Electron microscopy (1Rodgers D.W. Crépeau R.H.

Chem. 1985; 260: 8272-8279Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have shown that both fibers and crystals are composed of double strands of Hb S molecules. The formation of the double strands requires the stereochemical contact between complementary surfaces involving specifically the Val-β6 and a hydrophobic pocket on an adjacent molecule (lateral contact).In order to further characterize the interactions at the key β6 site, particularly the role of hydrophobicity, it is useful to consider the effects of other amino acid side chains on fiber formation. Gelation studies of deoxygenated mixtures of S and non-S Hbs have provided considerable information about the location of intermolecular contacts in the polymer fibers (4Bookchin R. Nagel R.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1971; 60: 263-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). More recently, studies of recombinant Hbs modified at the fiber contacts have shown that the presence of the hydrophobic leucine or isoleucine residues at the β6 position could also initiate the polymerization process (5Baudin-Chich V. Pagnier J. Marden M. Bohn B. Lacaze N. Kister J. Schaad O. Edelstein S.J. Poyart C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1845-1849Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 6Adachi K.

https://openalex.org/W1975791710,"The functional heterogeneity of the ryanodine receptor (RyR) channels in avian cerebellum was defined. Heavy endoplasmic reticulum microsomes had significant levels of ryanodine and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate binding. Scatchard analysis and kinetic studies indicated the existence of at least two distinct ryanodine binding sites. Ryanodine binding was calcium-dependent but was not significantly enhanced by caffeine. Incorporation of microsomes into planar lipid bilayers revealed ion channels with pharmacological features (calcium, magnesium, ATP, and caffeine sensitivity) similar to the RyR channels found in mammalian striated muscle. Despite a wide range of unitary conductances (220-500 picosiemens, symmetrical cesium methanesulfonate), ryanodine locked both channels into a characteristic slow gating subconductance state, positively identifying them as RyR channels. Two populations of avian RyR channels were functionally distinguished by single channel calcium sensitivity. One population was defined by a bell-shaped calcium sensitivity analogous to the skeletal muscle RyR isoform (type I). The calcium sensitivity of the second RyR population was sigmoidal and analogous to the cardiac muscle RyR isoform (type II). These data show that there are at least two functionally distinct RyR channel populations in avian cerebellum. This leads to the possibility that these functionally distinct RyR channels are involved in different intracellular calcium signaling pathways."
